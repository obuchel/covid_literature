489,489,489,Assessment of Virally Vectored Autoimmunity as a Biocontrol Strategy for Cane Toads,13.939682,4.964896,2011-01-25,"BACKGROUND: The cane toad, Bufo (Chaunus) marinus, is one of the most notorious vertebrate pests introduced into Australia over the last 200 years and, so far, efforts to identify a naturally occurring B. marinus-specific pathogen for use as a biological control agent have been unsuccessful. We explored an alternative approach that entailed genetically modifying a pathogen with broad host specificity so that it no longer caused disease, but carried a gene to disrupt the cane toad life cycle in a species specific manner. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The adult beta globin gene was selected as the model gene for proof of concept of autoimmunity as a biocontrol method for cane toads. A previous report showed injection of bullfrog tadpoles with adult beta globin resulted in an alteration in the form of beta globin expressed in metamorphs as well as reduced survival. In B. marinus we established for the first time that the switch from tadpole to adult globin exists. The effect of injecting B. marinus tadpoles with purified recombinant adult globin protein was then assessed using behavioural (swim speed in tadpoles and jump length in metamorphs), developmental (time to metamorphosis, weight and length at various developmental stages, protein profile of adult globin) and genetic (adult globin mRNA levels) measures. However, we were unable to detect any differences between treated and control animals. Further, globin delivery using Bohle iridovirus, an Australian ranavirus isolate belonging to the Iridovirus family, did not reduce the survival of metamorphs or alter the form of beta globin expressed in metamorphs. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: While we were able to show for the first time that the switch from tadpole to adult globin does occur in B. marinus, we were not able to induce autoimmunity and disrupt metamorphosis. The short development time of B. marinus tadpoles may preclude this approach.","Pallister, Jackie A.; Halliday, Damien C.T.; Robinson, Anthony J.; Venables, Daryl; Voysey, Rhonda D.; Boyle, Donna G.; Shanmuganathan, Thayalini; Hardy, Christopher M.; Siddon, Nicole A.; Hyatt, Alex D.",PLoS One,197,1
525,525,525,"Genomic Signatures of Strain Selection and Enhancement in Bacillus atrophaeus var. globigii, a Historical Biowarfare Simulant",14.140522,4.769925,2011-03-25,"BACKGROUND: Despite the decades-long use of Bacillus atrophaeus var. globigii (BG) as a simulant for biological warfare (BW) agents, knowledge of its genome composition is limited. Furthermore, the ability to differentiate signatures of deliberate adaptation and selection from natural variation is lacking for most bacterial agents. We characterized a lineage of BGwith a long history of use as a simulant for BW operations, focusing on classical bacteriological markers, metabolic profiling and whole-genome shotgun sequencing (WGS). RESULTS: Archival strains and two “present day” type strains were compared to simulant strains on different laboratory media. Several of the samples produced multiple colony morphotypes that differed from that of an archival isolate. To trace the microevolutionary history of these isolates, we obtained WGS data for several archival and present-day strains and morphotypes. Bacillus-wide phylogenetic analysis identified B. subtilis as the nearest neighbor to B. atrophaeus. The genome of B. atrophaeus is, on average, 86% identical to B. subtilis on the nucleotide level. WGS of variants revealed that several strains were mixed but highly related populations and uncovered a progressive accumulation of mutations among the “military” isolates. Metabolic profiling and microscopic examination of bacterial cultures revealed enhanced growth of “military” isolates on lactate-containing media, and showed that the “military” strains exhibited a hypersporulating phenotype. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis revealed the genomic and phenotypic signatures of strain adaptation and deliberate selection for traits that were desirable in a simulant organism. Together, these results demonstrate the power of whole-genome and modern systems-level approaches to characterize microbial lineages to develop and validate forensic markers for strain discrimination and reveal signatures of deliberate adaptation.","Gibbons, Henry S.; Broomall, Stacey M.; McNew, Lauren A.; Daligault, Hajnalka; Chapman, Carol; Bruce, David; Karavis, Mark; Krepps, Michael; McGregor, Paul A.; Hong, Charles; Park, Kyong H.; Akmal, Arya; Feldman, Andrew; Lin, Jeffrey S.; Chang, Wenling E.; Higgs, Brandon W.; Demirev, Plamen; Lindquist, John; Liem, Alvin; Fochler, Ed; Read, Timothy D.; Tapia, Roxanne; Johnson, Shannon; Bishop-Lilly, Kimberly A.; Detter, Chris; Han, Cliff; Sozhamannan, Shanmuga; Rosenzweig, C.

686,686,686,Quantifying social distancing arising from pandemic influenza,13.912181,4.783562,2007-10-04,"Local epidemic curves during the 1918–1919 influenza pandemic were often characterized by multiple epidemic waves. Identifying the underlying cause(s) of such waves may help manage future pandemics. We investigate the hypothesis that these waves were caused by people avoiding potentially infectious contacts—a behaviour termed ‘social distancing’. We estimate the effective disease reproduction number and from it infer the maximum degree of social distancing that occurred during the course of the multiple-wave epidemic in Sydney, Australia. We estimate that, on average across the city, people reduced their infectious contact rate by as much as 38%, and that this was sufficient to explain the multiple waves of this epidemic. The basic reproduction number, R(0), was estimated to be in the range of 1.6–2.0 with a preferred estimate of 1.8, in line with other recent estimates for the 1918–1919 influenza pandemic. The data are also consistent with a high proportion (more than 90%) of the population being initially susceptible to clinical infection, and the proportion of infections that were asymptomatic (if this occurs) being no higher than approximately 9%. The observed clinical attack rate of 36.6% was substantially lower than the 59% expected based on the estimated value of R(0), implying that approximately 22% of the population were spared from clinical infection. This reduction in the clinical attack rate translates to an estimated 260 per 100 000 lives having been saved, and suggests that social distancing interventions could play a major role in mitigating the public health impact of future influenza pandemics.","Caley, Peter; Philp, David J; McCracken, Kevin",Journal of The Royal Society Interface,197,22
1109,1109,1109,Clinical Characteristics and Outcomes in Hospitalized Patients with Respiratory Viral Co-Infection during the 2009 H1N1 Influenza Pandemic,13.816827,9.236569,2013-04-09,"BACKGROUND: The clinical consequences of co-infection with two or more respiratory viruses are poorly understood. We sought to determine if co-infection with pandemic 2009–2010 influenza A H1N1 (pH1N1) and another respiratory virus was associated with worse clinical outcomes. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed of all hospitalized patients with a positive respiratory viral panel (RVP) for two or more viruses within 72 hours of admission at our institution from October 2009 to December 2009. We compared patients infected with one respiratory virus to those with respiratory viral co-infection. RESULTS: We identified 617 inpatients with a positive RVP sample with a single virus and 49 inpatients with a positive RVP sample for two viruses (i.e. co-infection). Co-infected patients were significantly younger, more often had fever/chills, tachypnea, and they more often demonstrated interstitial opacities suggestive of viral pneumonia on the presenting chest radiograph (OR 7.5, 95% CI 3.4–16.5). The likelihood of death, length of stay, and requirement for intensive care unit level of care were similar in both groups, but patients with any respiratory virus co-infection were more likely to experience complications, particularly treatment for a secondary bacterial pneumonia (OR 6.8, 95% CI 3.3–14.2). Patients co-infected with pH1N1 and another respiratory virus were more likely to present with chest radiograph changes suggestive of a viral pneumonia, compared to mono-infection with pH1N1 (OR 16.9, 95% CI 4.5–62.7). By logistic regression using mono-infection with non-PH1N1 viruses as the reference group, co-infection with pH1N1 was the strongest independent predictor of treatment for a secondary bacterial pneumonia (OR 17.8, 95% CI 6.7–47.1). CONCLUSION: Patients with viral co-infection, particularly with pH1N1, were more likely to have chest radiograph features compatible with a viral pneumonia and complications during their hospital course, particularly treatment for secondary bacterial pneumonia. Despite this, co-infection was not associated with ICU admission.","Echenique, Ignacio A.; Chan, Philip A.; Chapin, Kimberle C.; Andrea, Sarah B.; Fava, Joseph L.; Mermel, Leonard A.",PLoS One,197,22
1237,1237,1237,Estimating a Markovian Epidemic Model Using Household Serial Interval Data from the Early Phase of an Epidemic,13.918593,4.867611,2013-08-30,"The clinical serial interval of an infectious disease is the time between date of symptom onset in an index case and the date of symptom onset in one of its secondary cases. It is a quantity which is commonly collected during a pandemic and is of fundamental importance to public health policy and mathematical modelling. In this paper we present a novel method for calculating the serial interval distribution for a Markovian model of household transmission dynamics. This allows the use of Bayesian MCMC methods, with explicit evaluation of the likelihood, to fit to serial interval data and infer parameters of the underlying model. We use simulated and real data to verify the accuracy of our methodology and illustrate the importance of accounting for household size. The output of our approach can be used to produce posterior distributions of population level epidemic characteristics.","Black, Andrew J.; Ross, Joshua V.",PLoS One,197,1
2160,2160,2160,Understanding Spatio-Temporal Variability in the Reproduction Ratio of the Bluetongue (BTV-1) Epidemic in Southern Spain (Andalusia) in 2007 Using Epidemic Trees,14.001169,4.5875115,2016-03-10,"Andalusia (Southern Spain) is considered one of the main routes of introduction of bluetongue virus (BTV) into Europe, evidenced by a devastating epidemic caused by BTV-1 in 2007. Understanding the pattern and the drivers of BTV-1 spread in Andalusia is critical for effective detection and control of future epidemics. A long-standing metric for quantifying the behaviour of infectious diseases is the case-reproduction ratio (R(t)), defined as the average number of secondary cases arising from a single infected case at time t (for t>0). Here we apply a method using epidemic trees to estimate the between-herd case reproduction ratio directly from epidemic data allowing the spatial and temporal variability in transmission to be described. We then relate this variability to predictors describing the hosts, vectors and the environment to better understand why the epidemic spread more quickly in some regions or periods. The R(t) value for the BTV-1 epidemic in Andalusia peaked in July at 4.6, at the start of the epidemic, then decreased to 2.2 by August, dropped below 1 by September (0.8), and by October it had decreased to 0.02. BTV spread was the consequence of both local transmission within established disease foci and BTV expansion to distant new areas (i.e. new foci), which resulted in a high variability in BTV transmission, not only among different areas, but particularly through time, which suggests that general control measures applied at broad spatial scales are unlikely to be effective. This high variability through time was probably due to the impact of temperature on BTV transmission, as evidenced by a reduction in the value of R(t) by 0.0041 for every unit increase (day) in the extrinsic incubation period (EIP), which is itself directly dependent on temperature. Moreover, within the range of values at which BTV-1 transmission occurred in Andalusia (20.6°C to 29.5°C) there was a positive correlation between temperature and R(t) values, although the relationship was not linear, probably as a result of the complex relationship between temperature and the different parameters affecting BTV transmission. R(t) values for BTV-1 in Andalusia fell below the threshold of 1 when temperatures dropped below 21°C, a much higher threshold than that reported in other BTV outbreaks, such as the BTV-8 epidemic in Northern Europe. This divergence may be explained by differences in the adaptation to temperature of the main vectors of the BTV-1 epidemic in Andalusia (Culicoides imicola) compared those of the BTV-8 epidemic in Northern Europe (Culicoides obsoletus). Importantly, we found that BTV transmission (R(t) value) increased significantly in areas with higher densities of sheep. Our analysis also established that control of BTV-1 in Andalusia was complicated by the simultaneous establishment of several distant foci at the start of the epidemic, which may have been caused by several independent introductions of infected vectors from the North of Africa. We discuss the implications of these findings for BTV surveillance and control in this region of Europe.","Napp, S.; Allepuz, A.; Purse, B. V.; Casal, J.; García-Bocanegra, I.; Burgin, L.

Airborne diseases may spread rapidly as people visit different indoor environments and are in frequent contact with others. We constructed a simple indoor contact model for an ideal city with 7 million people and 3 million indoor spaces, and estimated the probability and duration of contact between any two individuals during one day. To do this, we used data from actual censuses, social behavior surveys, building surveys, and ventilation measurements in Hong Kong to define eight population groups and seven indoor location groups. Our indoor contact model was integrated with an existing epidemiological Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, and Recovered (SEIR) model to estimate disease spread and with the Wells-Riley equation to calculate local infection risks, resulting in an integrated indoor transmission network model. This model was used to estimate the probability of an infected individual infecting others in the city and to study the disease transmission dynamics. We predicted the infection probability of each sub-population under different ventilation systems in each location type in the case of a hypothetical airborne disease outbreak, which is assumed to have the same natural history and infectiousness as smallpox. We compared the effectiveness of controlling ventilation in each location type with other intervention strategies. We conclude that increasing building ventilation rates using methods such as natural ventilation in classrooms, offices, and homes is a relatively effective strategy for airborne diseases in a large city.","Gao, Xiaolei; Wei, Jianjian; Lei, Hao; Xu, Pengcheng; Cowling, Benjamin J.; Li, Yuguo",PLoS One,197,17

Recent models of Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) have often made assumptions about how the disease spreads, such as uniform transmissibility and homogeneous mixing within a population. In this paper, we test whether these assumptions are necessarily correct, and offer simple solutions that may improve disease model accuracy. First, we use data and models of West African migration to show that EVD does not homogeneously mix, but spreads in a predictable manner. Next, we estimate the initial growth rate of EVD within country administrative divisions and find that it significantly decreases with population density. Finally, we test whether EVD strains have uniform transmissibility through a novel statistical test, and find that certain strains appear more often than expected by chance.","Burghardt, Keith; Verzijl, Christopher; Huang, Junming; Ingram, Matthew; Song, Binyang; Hasne, Marie-Pierre",Sci Rep,197,1
2651,2651,2651,Influenza A H5N1 and H7N9 in China: A spatial risk analysis,14.035047,4.684439,2017-04-04,"BACKGROUND: Zoonotic avian influenza poses a major risk to China, and other parts of the world. H5N1 has remained endemic in China and globally for nearly two decades, and in 2013, a novel zoonotic influenza A subtype H7N9 emerged in China. This study aimed to improve upon our current understanding of the spreading mechanisms of H7N9 and H5N1 by generating spatial risk profiles for each of the two virus subtypes across mainland China. METHODS AND FINDINGS: In this study, we (i) developed a refined data set of H5N1 and H7N9 locations with consideration of animal/animal environment case data, as well as spatial accuracy and precision; (ii) used this data set along with environmental variables to build species distribution models (SDMs) for each virus subtype in high resolution spatial units of 1km(2) cells using Maxent; (iii) developed a risk modelling framework which integrated the results from the SDMs with human and chicken population variables, which was done to quantify the risk of zoonotic transmission; and (iv) identified areas at high risk of H5N1 and H7N9 transmission. We produced high performing SDMs (6 of 8 models with AUC > 0.9) for both H5N1 and H7N9. In all our SDMs, H7N9 consistently showed higher AUC results compared to H5N1, suggesting H7N9 suitability could be better explained by environmental variables. For both subtypes, high risk areas were primarily located in south-eastern China, with H5N1 distributions found to be more diffuse and extending more inland compared to H7N9. CONCLUSIONS: We provide projections of our risk models to public health policy makers so that specific high risk areas can be targeted for control measures. We recommend comparing H5N1 and H7N9 prevalence rates and survivability in the natural environment to better understand the role of animal and environmental transmission in human infections.","Bui, Chau Minh; Gardner, Lauren; MacIntyre, Raina; Sarkar, Sahotra",PLoS One,197,1

Based on Phenolic Profiles, Bioactivity, and HPLC Fingerprint Combined with Chemometrics",13.984075,4.7282977,2017-04-19,"Juniperus rigida (J. rigida) which is endemic to East Asia, has traditionally been used as an ethnomedicinal plant in China. This study was undertaken to evaluate the quality of J. rigida samples derived from 11 primary regions in China. Ten phenolic compounds were simultaneously quantified using reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC), and chlorogenic acid, catechin, podophyllotoxin, and amentoflavone were found to be the main compounds in J. rigida needles, with the highest contents detected for catechin and podophyllotoxin. J. rigida from Jilin (S9, S10) and Liaoning (S11) exhibited the highest contents of phenolic profiles (total phenolics, total flavonoids and 10 phenolic compounds) and the strongest antioxidant and antibacterial activities, followed by Shaanxi (S2, S3). A similarity analysis (SA) demonstrated substantial similarities in fingerprint chromatograms, from which 14 common peaks were selected. The similarity values varied from 0.85 to 0.98. Chemometrics techniques, including hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), principal component analysis (PCA), and discriminant analysis (DA), were further applied to facilitate accurate classification and quantification of the J. rigida samples derived from the 11 regions. The results supported HPLC data showing that all J. rigida samples exhibit considerable variations in phenolic profiles, and the samples were further clustered into three major groups coincident with their geographical regions of origin. In addition, two discriminant functions with a 100% discrimination ratio were constructed to further distinguish and classify samples with unknown membership on the basis of eigenvalues to allow optimal discrimination among the groups. Our comprehensive findings on matching phenolic profiles and bioactivities along with data from fingerprint chromatograms with chemometrics provide an effective tool for screening and quality evaluation of J. rigida and related medicinal preparations.","Liu, Zehua; Wang, Dongmei; Li, Dengwu; Zhang, Shuai",Front Pharmacol,197,1

The N-terminal domain (NTD) of Lsm11, a component of U7 snRNP, interacts with FLASH NTD and these two proteins recruit the histone cleavage complex containing the CPSF-73 endonuclease for the cleavage reaction. Here, we determined crystal structures of FLASH NTD and found that it forms a coiled-coil dimer. Using solution light scattering, we characterized the stoichiometry of the FLASH NTD-Lsm11 NTD complex and found that it is a 2:1 heterotrimer, which is supported by observations from analytical ultracentrifugation and crosslinking.","Aik, Wei Shen; Lin, Min-Han; Tan, Dazhi; Tripathy, Ashutosh; Marzluff, William F.; Dominski, Zbigniew; Chou, Chi-Yuan; Tong, Liang",PLoS One,197,1

In the reaction with BOP, a coumarin‐derived phosphonium ion intermediate seems to form, leading to an O (4)‐(benzotriazolyl)coumarin derivative.

4194,4194,4194,Testing predictability of disease outbreaks with a simple model of pathogen biogeography,14.066276,4.810111,2019-11-13,"Predicting disease emergence and outbreak events is a critical task for public health professionals and epidemiologists. Advances in global disease surveillance are increasingly generating datasets that are worth more than their component parts for prediction-oriented work. Here, we use a trait-free approach which leverages information on the global community of human infectious diseases to predict the biogeography of pathogens through time. Our approach takes pairwise dissimilarities between countries’ pathogen communities and pathogens’ geographical distributions and uses these to predict country–pathogen associations. We compare the success rates of our model for predicting pathogen outbreak, emergence and re-emergence potential as a function of time (e.g. number of years between training and prediction), pathogen type (e.g. virus) and transmission mode (e.g. vector-borne). With only these simple predictors, our model successfully predicts basic network structure up to a decade into the future. We find that while outbreak and re-emergence potential are especially well captured by our simple model, prediction of emergence events remains more elusive, and sudden global emergences like an influenza pandemic are beyond the predictive capacity of the model. However, these stochastic pandemic events are unlikely to be predictable from such coarse data. Together, our model is able to use the information on the existing country–pathogen network to predict pathogen outbreaks fairly well, suggesting the importance in considering information on co-occurring pathogens in a more global view even to estimate outbreak events in a single location or for a single pathogen.","Dallas, Tad A.; Carlson, Colin J.; Poisot, Timothée",R Soc Open Sci,197,17
4242,4242,4242,Modelling and analysing the coexistence of dual dilemmas in the proactive vaccination game and retroactive treatment game in epidemic viral dynamics,13.973615,4.5795674,2019-12-04,"The dynamics of a spreadable disease are largely governed by four factors: proactive vaccination, retroactive treatment, individual decisions, and the prescribing behaviour of physicians. Under the imposed vaccination policy and antiviral treatment in society, complex factors (costs and expected effects of the vaccines and treatments, and fear of being infected) trigger an emulous situation in which individuals avoid infection by the pre-emptive or ex post provision. Aside from the established voluntary vaccination game, we propose a treatment game model associated with the resistance evolution of antiviral/antibiotic overuse. Moreover, the imperfectness of vaccinations has inevitably led to anti-vaccine behaviour, necessitating a proactive treatment policy. However, under the excessively heavy implementation of treatments such as antiviral medicine, resistant strains emerge. The model explicitly exhibits a dual social dilemma situation, in which the treatment behaviour changes on a local time scale, and the vaccination uptake later evolves on a global time scale. The impact of resistance evolution and the coexistence of dual dilemmas are investigated by the control reproduction number and the social efficiency deficit, respectively. Our investigation might elucidate the substantial impacts of both vaccination and treatment in the framework of epidemic dynamics, and hence suggest the appropriate use of antiviral treatment.","Kabir, K.

METHODS: To calculate the preventability, we surveyed in a first step the number and kind of needlestick injuries and in a second step the reasons for the injuries and the working conditions of the healthcare workers. Both data sets were collected in independent anonymous questionnaire covering occupational blood exposure among healthcare workers in a German university hospital. RESULTS: Needlestick injuries were caused through unsafe procedures, difficult working conditions and unsafe devices. On average, 50.3% (n = 492/978) of all needlestick injuries could have been avoided by the use of safety devices, whereas only 15.2% could have been prevented by organizational measures. In our study, 31.5% (n = 503/1598) of participant healthcare workers had sustained at least one needlestick injury in the past twelve months. The rate of underreporting was about 75%. After introduction of safety devices, 91.8% of the healthcare workers reported being satisfied with the anti-needlestick devices and 83.4% believed that safety devices would increase the safety of the work environment. CONCLUSIONS: Occupational exposure to blood is a common problem among healthcare workers. The introduction of safety devises is one of the main starting points for avoidance of needlestick injuries, and acceptance among healthcare workers is high. Further targets for preventive measures, such as training in safe working routines, are necessary for improvement of safe work conditions.","Wicker, Sabine; Ludwig, Ann-Marie; Gottschalk, René; Rabenau, Holger F.",Wien Klin Wochenschr,197,1

The macroarray analyses of expression profiles of isolated floral genes showed that 157 genes out of the 612 unique ESTs tested revealed higher transcript abundance in the floral buds and uppermost leaves. Among them, 78 genes were determined to be differentially expressed in the perianth, 62 in the stamens, and 100 genes in the carpels. Quantitative real-time PCR of selected genes validated the macroarray results.

All survivors had complete remission before transplant though 2 had leptomeningeal spread. We conclude that AHSCT can achieve long-term survival in children with recurrent brain tumor. However, those with macroscopic residual tumor before transplant cannot be salvaged.","Cheuk, Daniel Ka Leung; Lee, Tsz Leung; Chiang, Alan Kwok Shing; Ha, Shau Yin; Chan, Godfrey Chi Fung",J Neurooncol,197,7

METHODS: Forty-seven patients underwent LDLT in our institute, 16 for emergencies and 31 as elective procedures. The emergency LDLT status was applied to cases in which the time period between referral to our institution and transplantation did not exceed 10 days, and in which liver failure was accompanied by the presence of any degree of hepatic encephalopathy. RESULTS: With regard to preoperative factors, age (P = 0.03), the model for end-stage liver disease score (P = 0.001), preoperative tracheal intubation (P = 0.001), ratio between arterial oxygen tension and fractional inspired oxygen (PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio) (P = 0.03), steroid therapy use (P = 0.001), lymphocyte count (P = 0.02), and cases requiring hemodiafiltration (P = 0.001) differed significantly between the two groups. Postoperative pneumonia occurred more frequently in emergency LDLT patients than in elective LDLT patients (P = 0.006). Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) was the main cause of postoperative death in emergency LDLT patients, and, in a univariate analysis, a preoperative status of high serum (1 → 3)-β-d-glucan (>20 pg/ml, P = 0.001), advanced age (>52 years, P = 0.02), and a low PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio (<320, P = 0.01) were identified as factors predictive of IPA. CONCLUSION: Careful perioperative management, including preoperative investigation of aspergillosis and empiric antibiotic therapy, should be considered for emergency LDLT patients who fulfill IPA risk factors.","Takeda, Kazuhisa; Tanaka, Kuniya; Kumamoto, Takafumi; Nojiri, Kazunori; Mori, Ryutaro; Taniguchi, Koichi; Matsuyama, Ryusei; Endo, Itaru",Surg Today,197,11

The objective of this study was to investigate the safety and efficacy of hepatic resection combined with RFA. Methods: Patients with multifocal hepatic malignancies were treated with surgical resection combined with RFA. All patients were followed prospectively to assess complications, treatment response, and recurrence. Results: Seven hundred thirty seven tumors in 172 patients were treated (124 with colorectal metastases; 48 with noncolorectal metastases). RFA was used to treat 350 tumors. Combined modality treatment was well tolerated with low operative times and minimal blood loss. The postoperative complication rate was 19.8% with a mortality rate of 2.3%. At a median follow-up of 21.3 months, tumors had recurred in 98 patients (56.9%). Failure at the RFA site was uncommon (2.3%). A combined total number of tumors treated with resection and RFA >10 was associated with a faster time to recurrence (P = .02). The median actuarial survival time was 45.5 months. Patients with noncolorectal metastases and those with less operative blood loss had an improved survival (P = .03 and P = .04, respectively), whereas radiofrequency ablating a lesion >3 cm adversely impacted survival (HR = 1.85, P = .04). Conclusions: Resection combined with RFA provides a surgical option to a group of patients with liver metastases who traditionally are unresectable, and may increase long-term survival.","Pawlik, Timothy M.; Izzo, Francesco; Cohen, Deborah S.; Morris, Jeffery S.; Curley, Steven A.",Ann Surg Oncol,197,1

But several problems prohibited its spreading: (1) the accuracy and the reproducibility of the inhaled dose (range ca. 1:4); (2) the small amount of inhaled drug in relation to the dose in the aerosol delivery system (range ca. 1%–10%); (3) the fear of allergic reactions of the respiratory system; (4) the variability of the drug transport into the systemic circulation. New approaches and data raise hopes in reducing the problems: (1) aerosol delivery systems with defined particle spectrum and storage systems; slow vital capacity inhaling maneuver; (2) delivery systems that nebulizes nearly the total amount of drug; (3) all studies with the inhalation application of insulin, heparin, ergotamin, ribavirin, aminoglycosides, and “cigarette smoke” do not reveal any relevant allergic reaction; (4) many studies were performed in the last 10 years on the influence of substances and especially of diseases on the transport of molecules through the respiratory tract.

Protection does not involve the suppression of virus replication in the central nervous system (CNS) or via augmentation of the antiviral antibody response. In the present report we have compared the CNS lesions induced by JHMV in lethally infected and T cell clone protected mice. The presence of virus-specific T cell clones induced a transient increase in mononuclear cell infiltration into the parenchyma of the brains of protected mice, consistent with previous data suggesting that a DTH response was responsible for protection. Immunohistochemical studies suggested further that virus was not replicating in the ependyma or cellular infiltrate, but that the presence of the T cell clone prevented neuronal infection. While the mechanism of effectively altering the in vivo cellular tropism is unknown, survival is accompanied by increased specific destruction of target tissues with fulminant CNS demyelination and an increased incidence of persistent infection.","Erlich, Stephanie S.; Matsushima, Glenn K.; Stohlman, Stephen A.",J Neurol Sci,197,12

New targeted and individualized therapies and drugs provide a survival benefit for an increasing number of patients, but can also cause severe side effects. An increasing number of oncology patients are admitted to intensive care units (ICU) because of cancer-related complications or treatment-associated side effects. Postoperative care, respiratory distress and sepsis are the leading causes for admission. Tumor mass syndromes and tumor lysis may require urgent treatment. Traditional anticancer chemotherapy is associated with infections and immunosuppression. Newer agents are generally well-tolerated and side effects are mild or moderate, but overwhelming inflammation and autoimmunity can also occur. Cellular treatment, such as with chimeric antigen receptor modified T‑cells, monoclonal and bispecific antibodies targeting immune effectors and tumor cells are associated with cytokine release syndrome (CRS) with hypotension, skin reactions and fever. It is related to excessively high levels of inflammatory cytokines. Immune checkpoint inhibitors can lead to immune-related adverse events (IRAEs), such as colitis and endocrine disorders.

That process can be explored by examining patterns of nestedness. Species composition for a set of communities exhibits a nested pattern if species present in progressively richer assemblages form a series of subsets. Nestedness can form as a result of the dynamic processes of extinction or colonization. It can also reflect a nested distribution of habitats among the sites or the differential abundance properties of species through passive sampling. This study investigated whether Sonoran Desert woody vegetation in remnant islands within metropolitan Phoenix is nested and explored which mechanisms are responsible for the pattern. It also examined whether vegetation is nested in similar habitat types across islands, and how species abundance relates to the nested pattern and hypothesized mechanisms. All data sets were significantly nested, indicating a nested pattern at the island and habitat levels. Community‐level analyses did not indicate a primary mechanism leading to the nested pattern. Among species with abundances correlated with the nested rank‐order of sites, abundance properties were significantly related to different variables. This suggests that individual taxa respond to divergent ecological mechanisms, leading to nestedness. Thus, nestedness in plant communities can result from a complex set of contributors and may not be attributable to a single factor.","Stiles, Arthur; Scheiner, Samuel M.",Ecology,197,1

A data set consisting of twenty‐eight anatomical characters scored for twenty‐eight terminal taxa representing the world fauna of Signiphoridae was analysed using parsimony and compatibility methods. The Coccophaginae (Aphelinidae) and the Azotinae (Aphelinidae) were used as outgroups to establish polarity of character state changes. Relationships of Signiphoridae to other Chalcidoidea are discussed. Several multistate characters were treated in the parsimony analyses either as unordered or as ordered into transformation series using additive binary coding, which in some cases drastically reduced the number of equally parsimonious solutions. Monophyly of Signiphoridae is supported by seven synapomorphies. Four genera, Chartocerus, Thysanus, Clytina and Signiphora, are recognized within Signiphoridae based on synapomorphies. Rozanoviella syn.n. and Kerrichiella syn.n. are synonymized under Signiphora. Species of Signiphora are further assigned to four species groups, three of which are demonstrably monophyletic.

Treatment with both vitamins significantly up-regulated the gene encoding cysteine synthase A. Additionally, only BCG that was treated with V(C) showed m4c modifications. Genes harboring this methylation were up-regulated, suggesting that m4c methylation can promote gene transcription to some extent.

Identifying the individual oscillatory components that constitute an observed biological signal leads to profound understanding about the biological system. The instantaneous frequency (IF), the amplitude modulation (AM), and their temporal variability are widely used to describe these oscillatory phenomena. In addition, the shape of the oscillatory pattern, repeated in time for an oscillatory component, is also an important characteristic that can be parametrized appropriately. These parameters can be viewed as phenomenological surrogates for the hidden dynamics of the biological system. To estimate jointly the IF, AM, and shape, this paper applies a novel and robust time-frequency analysis tool, referred to as the synchrosqueezing transform (SST). The usefulness of the model and SST are shown directly in predicting the clinical outcome of ventilator weaning. Compared with traditional respiration parameters, the breath-to-breath variability has been reported to be a better predictor of the outcome of the weaning procedure. So far, however, all these indices normally require at least [Formula: see text] min of data acquisition to ensure predictive power. Moreover, the robustness of these indices to the inevitable noise is rarely discussed. We find that based on the proposed model, SST and only [Formula: see text] min of respiration data, the ROC area under curve of the prediction accuracy is [Formula: see text]. The high predictive power that is achieved in the weaning problem, despite a shorter evaluation period, and the stability to noise suggest that other similar kinds of signal may likewise benefit from the proposed model and SST.","Wu, Hau-Tieng; Hseu, Shu-Shua; Bien, Mauo-Ying; Kou, Yu Ru; Daubechies, Ingrid",IEEE Trans Biomed Eng,197,1

RECENT FINDINGS: Both central interventions such as non-invasive brain stimulation and peripheral interventions such as electrical stimulation to peripheral tissues are conducted to enhance swallowing. Recent studies have paid more attention to generating neuroplasticity to produce long-lasting facilitative effect on swallowing. SUMMARY: Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), pharyngeal electrical stimulation (PES), transcutaneous electrical stimulation, and somatic and chemical stimulation were introduced. Considerable evidence supports the therapeutic potential of TMS and PES. Other approaches need further studies to verify their efficacy (e.g., duration of the effect and a limit of effectiveness) and/or possible risk of adverse effects.","Yamamura, Kensuke; Kurose, Masayuki; Okamoto, Keiichiro",Curr Phys Med Rehabil Rep,197,11

Although Cuvier’s beaked whales (Ziphius cavirostris) are widely distributed, little is known of their behavior and population structure throughout much of their range. We conducted a series of five combined visual-acoustic marine mammal surveys from 2006 to 2008 in the southern San Nicolas Basin, a site of frequent naval activity off the southern California coast, west of San Clemente Island. The study area was defined by a 1,800 km(2) array of 88 bottom-mounted hydrophones at depths up to 1,850 m. The array was used to vector visual observers toward vocalizing marine mammal species. Thirty-seven groups of Cuvier’s beaked whales were encountered during the study period. The overall encounter rate was one group for every 21.0 h of survey effort, and was as high as one group per 10.2 h of effort during the October 2007 survey. Whales were encountered in the deepest portion of the study area, at a mean bottom depth of 1,580 m (SD 138). The average group size was 3.8 individuals (SD 2.4), which was higher than has been reported from other studies of this species. Twenty-four groups were observed over multiple surfacings (median = 4 surfacings, range 2–15). The mean encounter duration of extended sightings was 104 min (SD 98, range 12–466 min) and the mean distance moved over the course of sightings was 1.66 km (SD 1.56, range 0.08–6.65 km). Temporal surfacing patterns during extended encounters were similar to dive behavior described from Cuvier’s beaked whales carrying time-depth recording tags. Seventy-eight photographic identifications were made of 58 unique individuals, for an overall resighting rate of 0.26. Whales were sighted on up to 4 days, with duration from first to last sighting spanning 2–79 days. For those whales sighted on subsequent days, the mean distance between subsequent sightings was 8.6 km (SD 7.9). Individuals resighted over 2–3 days were usually in association with previous group members. Approximately one-third of groups contained more than one adult male, and many of the repeated associations involved adult males. These observations suggest the basin west of San Clemente Island may be an important region for Cuvier’s beaked whales, and also one which affords an unusual opportunity to collect detailed data on this species. Given its status as an active military range, it can also provide the ability to monitor the behavior of individuals in the presence of naval sonar, a critical step in the management of this and other beaked whale populations worldwide.","Falcone, Erin A.; Schorr, Gregory S.; Douglas, Annie B.; Calambokidis, John; Henderson, Elizabeth; McKenna, Megan F.; Hildebrand, John; Moretti, David",Mar Biol,197,1

A number of factors may influence tumor rates in rodent carcinogenicity studies, including the animal room environment, genetic differences, food consumption/weight gain, survival/age of the animals, identification of gross lesions, pathology sampling procedures and preparation of the histology slides, and histopathologic diagnosis The relative importance of these factors is evaluated, making use of laboratory animal carcinogenicity data from the National Toxicology Program and from other sources. An investigator must be aware of these potentially confounding factors, so that appropriate measures can be taken to reduce or eliminate their impact on the interpretation of study results. Certain potential sources of within-study variability can be controlled by appropriate experimental design and by proper conduct according to standard operating procedures. The effect of certain factor influencing tumor prevalence may be magnified when variability from study to study is considered, and thus it may be difficult to formulate a biologically meaningful statistical analysis that uses historical control data in a formal testing framework.","HASEMAN, J.

AIM: Overview of current digital approaches in headache treatment and presentation of two specific examples (App M‑sense and DMKG headache registry). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Literature research, product information, and presentations by the project managers. RESULTS: Most digital offers for headache treatment are currently headache calendars, mostly as a smartphone app. However, there are also promising extensions (e.g. trigger analysis) and new approaches such as digital instructions for relaxation and endurance sports, chatbots for patients, as well as support for doctors through structured collection of patient data and processing for diagnostic purposes. CONCLUSION: Different digital approaches could support practitioners and patients effectively in headache treatment and therapy guidance in the near future.

In this regard, the Coriolis(®) µ cyclonic air sampler is a practical, commercial collector that can be used with various analysis methods to monitor pathogens in air. However, information on how to operate this unit under optimal sampling and biosafety conditions is limited. We investigated Coriolis performance in aerosol dispersal experiments with polystyrene microspheres and Bacillus globigii spores. We report inconsistent sample recovery from the collector cone due to loss of material when sampling continuously for more than 30 min. Introducing a new collector cone every 10 min improved this shortcoming. Moreover, we found that several surfaces on the device become contaminated during sampling. Adapting a high efficiency particulate air-filter system to the Coriolis prevented contamination without altering collection efficiency or tactical deployment. A Coriolis modified with these operative and technical improvements was used to collect aerosols carrying microspheres released inside a Biosafety Level-3 laboratory during simulations of microbiological spills and aerosol dispersals. In summary, we provide operative and technical solutions to the Coriolis that optimize microbiological air sampling and improve biosafety.","Rufino de Sousa, Nuno; Shen, Lei; Silcott, David; Call, Charles J; Rothfuchs, Antonio Gigliotti",Ann Work Expo Health,197,1

These changes are also characteristic for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) neuropathology. Our aim was to evaluate gene expression patterns in the mouse hippocampus (MH) by using microarray technology 12 and 96 h after SIR evoked by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The results were compared with microarray analysis of human postmortem hippocampal AD tissues. It was found that 12 h after LPS administration the expression of 231 genes in MH was significantly altered (FC > 2.0); however, after 96 h only the S100a8 gene encoding calgranulin A was activated (FC = 2.9). Gene ontology enrichment analysis demonstrated the alteration of gene expression related mostly to the immune-response including the gene Lcn2 for Lipocalin 2 (FC = 237.8), involved in glia neurotoxicity. The expression of genes coding proteins involved in epigenetic regulation, histone deacetylases (Hdac4,5,8,9,11) and bromo- and extraterminal domain protein Brd3 were downregulated; however, Brd2 was found to be upregulated. Remarkably, the significant increase in expression of Lcn2, S100a8, S100a9 and also Saa3 and Ch25h, was found in AD brains suggesting that early changes of immune-response genes evoked by mild SIR could be crucial in AD pathogenesis.","Czapski, Grzegorz A.; Zhao, Yuhai; Lukiw, Walter J.; Strosznajder, Joanna B.",Int J Mol Sci,197,1

In the present study, we compared audiology training outcomes between a traditional approach and a recently developed immersive virtual reality (VR) approach in audiology students. Twenty-nine first-year audiology students participated in the study; 14 received traditional training (“TT group”), and 15 received the VR training (“VRT group”). Pre- and post-training evaluation included a 20-item test developed by an audiology educator. Post-training satisfaction and self-confidence were evaluated using Likert scales. Mean post-training test scores improved by 6.9±9.8 percentage points in the TT group and by 21.1±7.8 points in the VRT group; the improvement in scores was significant for both groups. After completing the traditional training, the TT group was subsequently trained with the VR system, after which mean scores further improved by 7.5 points; there was no significant difference in post-VR training scores between the TT and VRT groups. After training, the TT and VRT groups completed satisfaction and self-confidence questionnaires. Satisfaction and self-confidence ratings were significantly higher for the VR training group, compared to the traditional training group. Satisfaction ratings were “good” (4 on Likert scale) for 74% of the TT group and 100% of the VRT group. Self-confidence ratings were “good” for 71% of the TT group and 92% of the VRT group. These results suggest that a VR training approach may be an effective alternative or supplement to traditional training for audiology students.","Bakhos, David; Galvin, John; Aoustin, Jean-Marie; Robier, Mathieu; Kerneis, Sandrine; Bechet, Garance; Montembault, Norbert; Laurent, Stéphane; Godey, Benoit; Aussedat, Charles",PLoS One,197,7

Despite the recommendations of the World Health Organization, UNICEF, and the Ministry of Health of Iran to use C-KMC for eligible hospitalized neonates, this type of care is not performed due to implementation problems. This protocol aims to describe the design, implementation, and assessment of C-KMC in one tertiary hospital by means of participatory action research. METHODS: The objective of this study is to design and implement a C-KMC program for neonates that will be performed in two phases using a stages-of-change model. The first phase will be conducted in three consecutive activities of designing, implementing, and assessing the introduction of C-KMC. The second phase of the study has a before-and-after design to assess the effectiveness of C-KMC by comparing the length of preterm neonates’ stay in hospital and exclusive breastfeeding at discharge before and after implementing C-KMC. DISCUSSION: KMC is an important component of neonatal developmental care as part of family-centered care. Applying this type of care requires creating appropriate strategies, budget allocation, and clear and coordinated planning at different levels of the health system. The stages-of-change model is one of the appropriate approaches to the implementation of C-KMC.","Mohammadi, Marzieh; Bergh, Anne-Marie; Heidarzadeh, Mohammad; Hosseini, Mahammadbagher; Sattarzadeh Jahdi, Niloufar; Valizadeh, Leila; Sarvaran, Behzad; Hakimi, Sevil",Int Breastfeed J,197,1

We aimed to systematically evaluate between-trial heterogeneity in reporting standards and trial outcome. METHODS: A systematic review of RCTs published between 2000 and 2019 was performed including adult ARDS patients receiving lung-protective ventilation. A random-effects meta-regression model was applied to quantify heterogeneity (non-random variability) and to evaluate trial and patient characteristics as sources of heterogeneity. RESULTS: In total, 67 RCTs were included. The 28-day control-group mortality rate ranged from 10 to 67% with large non-random heterogeneity (I(2) = 88%, p < 0.0001). Reported baseline patient characteristics explained some of the outcome heterogeneity, but only six trials (9%) reported all four independently predictive variables (mean age, mean lung injury score, mean plateau pressure and mean arterial pH). The 28-day control group mortality adjusted for patient characteristics (i.e. the residual heterogeneity) ranged from 18 to 45%. Trials with significant benefit in the primary outcome reported a higher control group mortality than trials with an indeterminate outcome or harm (mean 28-day control group mortality: 44% vs. 28%; p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Among ARDS RCTs in the lung-protective ventilation era, there was large variability in the description of baseline characteristics and significant unexplainable heterogeneity in 28-day control group mortality. These findings signify problems with the generalizability of ARDS research and underline the urgent need for standardized reporting of trial and baseline characteristics.

This is an intellectual study in which we develop models, identify their limitations, suggest potential extensions to the models and discuss priorities for empirical studies to populate models. First, we develop a general model to calculate changes in survival contingent on the reduced time to treatment that an emergency transport system is designed to achieve. Second, we develop a model to estimate transfer times over an area that will be served by a proposed transfer system. Third, we discuss difficulties in obtaining parameters with which to populate the models. Fourth, we discuss costs, both direct and indirect, of an emergency transfer service. Fifth, we discuss the issue that outcomes other than survival should be considered and that the effects of a service are a weighted sum over all the conditions and severities for which the service caters. Lastly, based on the above work, we identify priorities for research.

Determining the key actors and contents of the prevailing biomedical research agenda,13.823565,4.8129134,2021-04-07,"BACKGROUND: Antibacterial-resistant gram-negative infections are a serious risk to global public health. Resistant Enterobacterales and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are highly prevalent, particularly in healthcare settings, and there are limited effective treatment options. Patients with infections caused by resistant pathogens have considerably worse outcomes, and incur significantly higher costs, relative to patients with susceptible infections. Ceftolozane/tazobactam (C/T) has established efficacy in clinical trials. This review aimed to collate data on C/T use in clinical practice. METHODS: This systematic literature review searched online biomedical databases for real-world studies of C/T for gram-negative infections up to June 2020. Relevant study, patient, and treatment characteristics, microbiology, and efficacy outcomes were captured. RESULTS: There were 83 studies comprising 3,701 patients were identified. The most common infections were respiratory infections (52.9% of reported infections), urinary tract infections (UTIs; 14.9%), and intra-abdominal infections (IAIs; 10.1%). Most patients included were seriously ill and had multiple comorbidities. The majority of patients had infections caused by P. aeruginosa (90.7%), of which 86.0% were antimicrobial-resistant. C/T was used as both a 1.5 g q8h and 3 g q8h dose, for a median duration of 7–56 days (varying between studies). Outcome rates were comparable between studies: clinical success rates ranged from 45.7 to 100.0%, with 27 studies (69%) reporting clinical success rates of > 70%; microbiological success rates ranged from 31 to 100%, with 14 studies (74%) reporting microbiological success rates of > 70%. Mortality rates ranged from 0 to 50%, with 31 studies (69%) reporting mortality rates of ≤ 20%. In comparative studies, C/T was as effective as aminoglycoside- or polymyxin-based regimens, and in some instances, significantly more effective. CONCLUSIONS: The studies identified in this review demonstrate that C/T is effective in clinical practice, despite the diverse group of seriously ill patients, different levels of resistance of the pathogens treated, and varying dosing regimens used. Furthermore, comparative studies suggest that C/T offers a successful alternative to standard of care (SoC).

Even countries presently free of PRRSV are at high risk for infection and spread of this virus. Some of these countries, including Japan, have broad epidemics of the local type 2 PRRSV, creating chronic pathogenicity in the domestic pig population. The present study aimed to evaluate the protective efficacy of immunity by infection with a Japanese field isolate, EDRD1, against heterologous challenge with a Vietnamese HP-PRRSV field strain. To this end, four groups of PRRSV-negative crossbreed piglets were used for a challenge study. Groups 1 and 2 were inoculated with EDRD1 via the intranasal route. After 26 days, Groups 2 and 3 were inoculated with HP-PRRSV via the same route. Group 4 served as an uninfected control. Blood and oral fluid samples were taken every 3–4 days after HP-PRRSV challenge; on day 16 post-challenge, all pigs were euthanized, and examined pathologically. RESULTS: The nucleotide sequence analysis of nonstructural protein 2 gene of EDRD1 and comparison with Vietnamese HP-PRRSV showed that the 39 amino acid deletion sites of EDRD1 was nearly in the same region as the 29 amino acid deletion sites of HP-PRRSV. Immunity conferred by inoculation with EDRD1 dramatically reduced viral load in the sera and tissues besides viral shedding (Group 2) compared with those in pigs infected only with HP-PRRSV (Group 3). The clinical signs and rectal temperature were significantly reduced, and the average daily weight gain was significantly improved in the EDRD1-inoculated pigs (Group 2) compared with the Group 3 pigs. Notably, no viral RNA was detected in various organs of the Group 2 pigs 16 days post-infection with HP-PRRSV, except in one pig. Therefore, the immunity induced by EDRD1 and its genetically close field isolates may play a role in reducing viremia caused by HP-PRRSV. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study demonstrate that pigs are highly protected against heterologous Vietnamese HP-PRRSV challenge by immunity against a Japanese local strain, EDRD1.","Iseki, Hiroshi; Kawashima, Kenji; Shibahara, Tomoyuki; Mase, Masaji",BMC Vet Res,197,1

Only one study reported specificity data. Variability in sensitivity may be due to variable reference standards or may imply operator dependence. There is insufficient evidence to judge the diagnostic accuracy of POCUS for PTB. There is also no consensus on the optimal protocols for acquiring and analysing POCUS images for PTB. New studies which minimise potential sources of bias are required to further assess the diagnostic accuracy of POCUS for PTB.","Bigio, Jacob; Kohli, Mikashmi; Klinton, Joel Shyam; MacLean, Emily; Gore, Genevieve; Small, Peter M.; Ruhwald, Morten; Weber, Stefan Fabian; Jha, Saurabh; Pai, Madhukar",PLoS One,197,1

An inductive analysis of the global literature on the quality of the public health data collection process has led to the formation of a preliminary 4D component framework, that is, data collection management, data collection personnel, data collection system, and data collection environment. It is necessary to empirically validate the framework for its use in future research and practice. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to obtain empirical evidence to confirm the components of the framework and, if needed, to further develop this framework. METHODS: Expert elicitation was used to evaluate the preliminary framework in the context of the Chinese National HIV/AIDS Comprehensive Response Information Management System. The research processes included the development of an interview guide and data collection form, data collection, and analysis. A total of 3 public health administrators, 15 public health workers, and 10 health care practitioners participated in the elicitation session. A framework qualitative data analysis approach and a quantitative comparative analysis were followed to elicit themes from the interview transcripts and to map them to the elements of the preliminary 4D framework. RESULTS: A total of 302 codes were extracted from interview transcripts. After iterative and recursive comparison, classification, and mapping, 46 new indicators emerged; 24.8% (37/149) of the original indicators were deleted because of a lack of evidence support and another 28.2% (42/149) were merged. The validated 4D component framework consists of 116 indicators (82 facilitators and 34 barriers). The first component, data collection management, includes data collection protocols and quality assurance. It was measured by 41 indicators, decreased from the original 49% (73/149) to 35.3% (41/116). The second component, data collection environment, was measured by 37 indicators, increased from the original 13.4% (20/149) to 31.9% (37/116). It comprised leadership, training, funding, organizational policy, high-level management support, and collaboration among parallel organizations. The third component, data collection personnel, includes the perception of data collection, skills and competence, communication, and staffing patterns. There was no change in the proportion for data collection personnel (19.5% vs 19.0%), although the number of its indicators was reduced from 29 to 22. The fourth component, the data collection system, was measured using 16 indicators, with a slight decrease in percentage points from 18.1% (27/149) to 13.8% (16/116). It comprised functions, system integration, technical support, and data collection devices. CONCLUSIONS: This expert elicitation study validated and improved the 4D framework.

Activated STAT4 has an inflammatory effect, and STAT4 is an important mediator of inflammation in diabetes. Our study aimed to study the association between STAT4 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and T2D susceptibility in Chinese Han population. METHODS: We conducted a 'case–control' study among 500 T2D patients and 501 healthy individuals. 5 candidate STAT4 SNPs were successfully genotyped. The association between SNPs and T2D susceptibility under different genetic models was evaluated by logistic regression analysis. ‘SNP-SNP’ interaction was analyzed and completed by multi-factor dimensionality reduction (MDR). Finally, we evaluated the differences of clinical characteristics under different genotypes by one-factor analysis of variance. RESULTS: The overall results showed that STAT4 rs3821236 was associated with increasing T2D risk under allele (OR 1.23, p = 0.020), homozygous (OR 1.51, p = 0.025), dominant (OR 1.36, p = 0.029), and additive models (OR 1.23, p = 0.020). The results of stratified analysis showed that rs3821236, rs11893432, and rs11889341 were risk factors for T2D among participants ≤ 60 years old. Only rs11893432 was associated with increased T2D risk among female participants. There was also a potential association between rs3821236 and T2D with nephropathy risk. STAT4 rs11893432, rs7574865 and rs897200 were significantly associated with lysophosphatidic acid, cystatin C and thyroxine t4, respectively. CONCLUSION: The genetic polymorphisms of STAT4 is potentially associated with T2D susceptibility of Chinese population. In particular, rs3821236 is significantly associated with T2D risk both in the overall and several subgroup analyses. Our study may provide new ideas for T2D individualized diagnosis/protection.

To avoid potential harmful effects during medicinal use, toxicity testing is necessary in the early stages of drug discovery. The objective of this study was to identify the cytotoxic mechanisms of jegosaponin A and B from Styrax japonica Siebold et al. Zuccarini; (2) Methods: We screened Japanese medicinal herb extracts using PC-3 prostate cancer cells and found that a methanol extract isolated from the unripe fruit of Styrax japonica Siebold et al. Zuccarini (SJSZ) had an inhibitory effect on cell viability. We further performed fractionation assays with PC-3 cells and identified the bioactive compounds using LC/MS and NMR analysis. We clarified the toxic mechanisms of these compounds using PC-3 cells and zebrafish embryos; (3) Results: We identified two active molecules, jegosaponin A and jegosaponin B, in the inhibitory fractions of the methanol extract. These jegosaponins are toxic to zebrafish embryos during the early developmental stage. Jegosaponin A and B showed strong haemolytic activity in sheep defibrinated blood (EC(50) = 2.1 μM, and 20.2 μM, respectively) and increased the cell membrane permeability in PC-3 cells and zebrafish embryos, which were identified using a membrane non-permeable DRAQ7, a fluorescent nucleus staining dye; (4) We identified the cytotoxic compounds jegosaponin A and B from SJSZ, which we showed to exhibit cell membrane disruptive properties using cell- and zebrafish-based testing.","Nishimura, Moe; Fuchino, Hiroyuki; Takayanagi, Kaoru; Kawakami, Hitomi; Nakayama, Hiroko; Kawahara, Nobuo; Shimada, Yasuhito",Int J Mol Sci,197,1

However, mastitis, a bacterial disease affecting milk production and reproduction efficiency, is most prevalent in populations having intensive selection for higher milk yield, especially where the inbreeding level is also high. Climate change and poor hygiene management practices further complicate the issue. The management of this disease faces major challenges, like antibiotic resistance, maximum residue level, horizontal gene transfer, and limited success in resistance breeding. Bovine mastitis genome wide association studies have had limited success due to breed differences, sample sizes, and minor allele frequency, lowering the power to detect the diseases associated with SNPs. In this work, we focused on the application of targeted gene panels (TGPs) in screening for candidate gene association analysis, and how this approach overcomes the limitation of genome wide association studies. This work will facilitate the targeted sequencing of buffalo genomic regions with high depth coverage required to mine the extremely rare variants potentially associated with buffalo mastitis. Although the whole genome assembly of water buffalo is available, neither mastitis genes are predicted nor TGP in the form of web-genomic resources are available for future variant mining and association studies. Out of the 129 mastitis associated genes of cattle, 101 were completely mapped on the buffalo genome to make TGP. This further helped in identifying rare variants in water buffalo. Eighty-five genes were validated in the buffalo gene expression atlas, with the RNA-Seq data of 50 tissues. The functions of 97 genes were predicted, revealing 225 pathways. The mastitis proteins were used for protein-protein interaction network analysis to obtain additional cross-talking proteins. A total of 1,306 SNPs and 152 indels were identified from 101 genes. Water Buffalo-MSTdb was developed with 3-tier architecture to retrieve mastitis associated genes having genomic coordinates with chromosomal details for TGP sequencing for mining of minor alleles for further association studies. Lastly, a web-genomic resource was made available to mine variants of targeted gene panels in buffalo for mastitis resistance breeding in an endeavor to ensure improved productivity and the reproductive efficiency of water buffalo.","Jaiswal, Sarika; Jagannadham, Jaisri; Kumari, Juli; Iquebal, Mir Asif; Gurjar, Anoop Kishor Singh; Nayan, Varij; Angadi, Ulavappa B.; Kumar, Sunil; Kumar, Rakesh; Datta, Tirtha Kumar; Rai, Anil; Kumar, Dinesh",Front Vet Sci,197,1

There have been NiV outbreak(s) in Malaysia, India, Bangladesh, and southern Philippines. NiV naturally circulates among fruit bats of the genus Pteropus and has been detected widely across Southeast and South Asia. Both Malaysian and Bangladeshi NiV strains have been found in fruit bats in Thailand. This study summarizes 20 years of pre-emptive One Health surveillance of NiV in Thailand, including triangulated surveillance of bats, and humans and pigs in the vicinity of roosts inhabited by NiV-infected bats. METHODS: Samples were collected periodically and tested for NiV from bats, pigs and healthy human volunteers from Wat Luang village, Chonburi province, home to the biggest P. lylei roosts in Thailand, and other provinces since 2001. Archived cerebrospinal fluid specimens from encephalitis patients between 2001 and 2012 were also tested for NiV. NiV RNA was detected using nested reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). NiV antibodies were detected using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or multiplex microsphere immunoassay. RESULTS: NiV RNA (mainly Bangladesh strain) was detected every year in fruit bats by RT-PCR from 2002 to 2020. The whole genome sequence of NiV directly sequenced from bat urine in 2017 shared 99.17% identity to NiV from a Bangladeshi patient in 2004. No NiV-specific IgG antibodies or RNA have been found in healthy volunteers, encephalitis patients, or pigs to date. During the sample collection trips, 100 community members were trained on how to live safely with bats. CONCLUSIONS: High identity shared between the NiV genome from Thai bats and the Bangladeshi patient highlights the outbreak potential of NiV in Thailand. Results from NiV cross-sectoral surveillance were conveyed to national authorities and villagers which led to preventive control measures, increased surveillance of pigs and humans in vicinity of known NiV-infected roosts, and increased vigilance and reduced risk behaviors at the community level. This proactive One Health approach to NiV surveillance is a success story; that increased collaboration between the human, animal, and wildlife sectors is imperative to staying ahead of a zoonotic disease outbreak.

This study aims at screening the proteins that bind to the key functional domain of HBx by integrated proteomics. Proteins that specifically bind to the transactivation domain of HBx were selected by comparing interactors of full-length HBx and HBx-D5 truncation determined by glutathione-S-transferase (GST) pull-down assay combined with mass spectrometry (MS). The function of HBx interactor Pin1 in HBV replication was further investigated by in vitro experiments. In this study, a total of 189 proteins were identified from HepG2 cells that specifically bind to the transactivation domain of HBx by GST pull-down and subsequent MS. After gene ontology (GO) analysis, Pin1 was selected as the protein with the highest score in the largest cluster functioning in protein binding, and also classified into the cluster of proteins with the function of structural molecule activity, which is of great potential to be involved in HBV life cycle. The interaction between Pin1 and HBx has been further confirmed by Ni(2+)-NTA pulldown assay, co-immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence microscopy. HBsAg and HBeAg levels significantly decreased in Pin1 expression inhibited HepG2.2.15 cells. Besides, the inhibition of Pin1 expression in HepG2 cells impeded the restored replication of HBx-deficient HBV repaired by ectopic HBx expression. In conclusion, our study identified Pin1 as an interactor binds to the transactivation domain of HBx, and suggested the potential association between Pin1 and the function of HBx in HBV replication.","Zhou, Qiaoxia; Yan, Libo; Xu, Baofu; Wang, Xue’er; Sun, Xuehong; Han, Ning; Tang, Hong; Huang, Feijun",Sci Rep,197,1

The study aimed to identify subclasses of septic shock with non-supervised learning algorithms, so as to tailor resuscitation strategy for each class. METHODS: Patients with septic shock in 25 tertiary care teaching hospitals in China from January 2016 to December 2017 were enrolled in the study. Clinical and laboratory variables were collected on days 0, 1, 2, 3 and 7 after ICU admission. Subclasses of septic shock were identified by both finite mixture modeling and K-means clustering. Individualized fluid volume and norepinephrine dose were estimated using dynamic treatment regime (DTR) model to optimize the final mortality outcome. DTR models were validated in the eICU Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD) dataset. RESULTS: A total of 1437 patients with a mortality rate of 29% were included for analysis. The finite mixture modeling and K-means clustering robustly identified five classes of septic shock. Class 1 (baseline class) accounted for the majority of patients over all days; class 2 (critical class) had the highest severity of illness; class 3 (renal dysfunction) was characterized by renal dysfunction; class 4 (respiratory failure class) was characterized by respiratory failure; and class 5 (mild class) was characterized by the lowest mortality rate (21%). The optimal fluid infusion followed the resuscitation/de-resuscitation phases with initial large volume infusion and late restricted volume infusion. While class 1 transitioned to de-resuscitation phase on day 3, class 3 transitioned on day 1. Classes 1 and 3 might benefit from early use of norepinephrine, and class 2 can benefit from delayed use of norepinephrine while waiting for adequate fluid infusion. CONCLUSIONS: Septic shock comprises a heterogeneous population that can be robustly classified into five phenotypes. These classes can be easily identified with routine clinical variables and can help to tailor resuscitation strategy in the context of precise medicine.

Creative learning and innovative teaching strategies empower students with high-quality, practical, real-world knowledge and meaningful skills to reach their potential as future health care providers. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore health profession students’ perceptions of whether their learning experiences were associated with good or bad pedagogy during asynchronous discussion forums. The further objective of the study was to identify how perceptions of the best and worst pedagogical practices reflected the students’ values, beliefs, and understanding about factors that made a pedagogy good during their learning history. METHODS: A netnographic qualitative design was employed in this study. The data were collected on February 3, 2020 by exporting archived data from multiple sessions of a graduate-level nursing course offered between the fall 2016 and spring 2020 semesters at a large private university in the southeast region of the United States. Each student was a data unit. As an immersive data operation, field notes were taken by all research members. Data management and analysis were performed with NVivo 12. RESULTS: A total of 634 posts were generated by 153 students identified in the dataset. Most of these students were female (88.9%). From the 97 categories identified, four themes emerged: (T) teacher presence built through relationship and communication, (E) environment conducive to affective and cognitive learning, (A) assessment and feedback processes that yield a growth mindset, and (M) mobilization of pedagogy through learner- and community-centeredness. CONCLUSIONS: The themes that emerged from our analysis confirm findings from previous studies and provide new insights. Our study highlights the value of technology as a tool for effective pedagogy. A resourceful teacher can use various communication techniques to develop meaningful connections between the learner and teacher. Styles of communication will vary according to the unique expectations and needs of learners with different learning preferences; however, the aim is to fully engage each learner, establish a rapport between and among students, and nurture an environment characterized by freedom of expression in which ideas flow freely. We suggest that future research continue to explore the influence of differing course formats and pedagogical modalities on student learning experiences.","De Gagne, Jennie C; Koppel, Paula D; Park, Hyeyoung K; Cadavero, Allen; Cho, Eunji; Rushton, Sharron; Yamane, Sandra S; Manturuk, Kim; Jung, Dukyoo",JMIR Med Educ,197,1

Despite its specificities, guidelines for treatment of perioperative cardiac arrest are lacking. Gathering the available literature may improve quality of care and outcome of patients. METHODS: The PERIOPCA Task Force identified major clinical questions about the management of perioperative cardiac arrest and framed them into the therapy population [P], intervention [I], comparator [C], and outcome [O] (PICO) format. Systematic searches of PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library for articles published until September 2020 were performed. Consensus-based treatment recommendations were created using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system. The strength of consensus among the Task Force members about the recommendations was assessed through a modified Delphi consensus process. RESULTS: Twenty-two PICO questions were addressed, and the recommendations were validated in two Delphi rounds. A summary of evidence for each outcome is reported and accompanied by an overall assessment of the evidence to guide healthcare providers.

This study investigates the financial impact to hospitals due to inaccurate obese patient recording and coding. BACKGROUND: Australian healthcare organisations receive Activity-Based Funding (ABF) which provides reimbursement of costs relating to the type of patient care delivered and the resources required for the patient treatment. Accurate healthcare data are essential to ensure accuracy of ABF and appropriate reimbursement of costs incurred by hospitals that manage obese patients. Managing obese patients results in operational funding requirements such as increased staffing and purchasing of equipment such as hoists, bariatric wheelchairs and bariatric beds, and hospitals must ensure that these clinical requirements are documented accurately in order to be reimbursed of these costs by way of ABF. METHODS: This study identifies the financial implications of inaccurate obesity data within the Western Australian Country Health Service (WACHS) and examines factors that may affect obesity data recording accuracy. The study involves 85 cases of identified obesity data recording inaccuracy that were adjusted by entering corrected obesity codes, which then adjusted Diagnosis-related Groups, National Weighted Activity Units and Activity-Based Funding results. RESULTS: The study demonstrated estimated annual lost funding opportunities of $2.23 million due to obesity coding inaccuracy. An annual average of 616 cases of obesity data inaccuracy was calculated with an average lost funding opportunity of $3625 per case. CONCLUSION: Improvements are required in the clinical recording and coding of patient obesity, such as mandatory recording of patient weight and height data and automated BMI calculations within electronic patient records. Enhanced obesity recording and coding accuracy will result in increased funding opportunities and reduced cost burdens that hospitals currently experience when required to fund obesity-related clinical and safety requirements within operational budgets.","McClean, Kim; Cross, Martyn; Reed, Sue",J Multidiscip Healthc,197,1

The medicalization (diagnosis, therapy and follow up) of the lack of fertility is frequently a challenge in term of personal and couple’s involvement. In particular, while the Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) has allowed many infertile couples to achieve pregnancy, the therapeutic process faced by the couple bears a strong psychological stress that can affect the couple's quality of life, relationship and sexuality. Despite infertility affects both female and male sexual health, only recently the interest in the effects of ART on the couple's sexuality has grown, especially for women. METHODS: A literature research on the sexual dysfunction in fertility care and particularly in ART setting was performed. RESULTS: Literature largely found that intimacy and sexuality appear specifically impaired by intrusiveness of treatments and medical prescriptions. Moreover, there is a close relationship between emotional, psychological and sexual aspects, which can be integrated in the new concept of Inferto-Sex Syndrome (ISS) that can impair the ART treatment outcomes. Evidence demonstrates that the assessment of sexual function is necessary in couples undergoing diagnosis of infertility and ART. CONCLUSION: A close relationship between infertility and sexuality, both in the female and male partners, was detected. ART treatments may heavily impact on the couple's psychosexual health. A couple-centred program for the integrated management of psychological and sexual dysfunction should be considered in the context of ART programs.","Luca, G.; Parrettini, S.; Sansone, A.; Calafiore, R.; Jannini, E.

However, most information exploring potential associations is drawn from survey data and mainly focuses on risk related to overall screen time. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between a variety of online risk factors and youth suicide-related behavior using real-world online activity data. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A matched case-control study was conducted from July 27, 2019, to May 26, 2020, with the sample drawn from more than 2600 US schools participating in an online safety monitoring program via the Bark online safety tool. For 227 youths having a severe suicide/self-harm alert requiring notification of school administrators, cases were matched 1:5 to 1135 controls on location, the amount of follow-up time, and general volume of online activity. EXPOSURES: Eight potential online risk factors (cyberbullying, violence, drug-related, hate speech, profanity, sexual content, depression, and low-severity self-harm) through assessment of text, image, and video data. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Severe suicide/self-harm alert requiring notification of school administrators; severe suicide alerts are statements by youths indicating imminent or recent suicide attempts and/or self-harm. RESULTS: The 1362 participants had a mean (SD) age of 13.3 (2.41) years; 699 (51.3%) were male. All 8 online risk factors studied exhibited differences between case and control populations and were significantly associated with subsequent severe suicide/self-harm alerts when examining total direct and indirect pathways. These associations ranged from an adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of 1.17 (95% CI, 1.09-1.26) for drug-related content to an aOR of 1.82 (95% CI, 1.63-2.03) for depression-related content. When considering the total number of different types of online risk factors among the 8 measured, there was an exponentially larger risk of severe suicide/self-harm alerts; youths with 5 or more of the 8 risk factors present in their online activity had a more than 70-fold increased odds of subsequently having a severe suicide/self-harm alert (aOR, 78.64; 95% CI, 34.39-179.84). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The findings of this study suggest that many discrete types of risk factors are identifiable from online data and associated with subsequent youth suicide-related behavior.

However, it is currently unknown how young sexual minority men (YSMM) perceive broad consent in these specific types of studies. Therefore, in this study we aimed to determine the extent to which YSMM are comfortable with providing broad consent concerning their identifiable biological specimens to a variety of entities, including external researchers and pharmaceutical companies and to examine the relationship between mistrust based on racial/ethnic identity or sexual orientation and attitudes toward broad consent. YSMM (N = 239) ages 24–27 years were recruited from a prospective cohort study in New York City in 2018 to complete a survey assessing attitudes about the use of broad consent concerning biospecimens for secondary research. We found that YSMM were most willing to provide broad consent to the researcher from the study they were enrolled in (85.3%), other researchers within the same university (82.4%), and researchers at other universities (74.5%). Participants were least willing to provide broad consent to government organizations (64.4%) and pharmaceutical companies (53.8%).

The purpose of this Bayesian meta-analysis was to compare the overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and relapse-free survival (RFS) between wedge resection and lobectomy/segmentectomy for treatment of early-stage NSCLC. METHODS: Eligible studies were retrieved from Web of Science, PubMed, MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, CNKI, and WanFang up to July 2021 and screened based on established selection criteria. The Bayesian meta-analysis was performed with the combination of the reported survival outcomes of the individual studies using a random-effect model. The OS, DFS, and RFS of the wedge resection group was compared with the lobectomy/segmentectomy group. The hazard ratio (HR) and standard error were extracted or calculated for each study using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: This study was registered with PROSPERO (INPLASY202080090).The pooled OS hazard ratio between segmentectomy and lobectomy was 1.1 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.92–1.4], the pooled HR between lobectomy and wedge resection was 0.71 [95% CI 0.52–0.96], and the pooled HR between segmentectomy and wedge was 0.80 [95% CI 0.56–1.10]. The pooled HR of DFS or RFS was not statistically significant among the three surgical approaches. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with early-stage NSCLC received lobectomy had the lowest hazard ratio of OS than patients received wedge resection, indicating that the overall survival of patients received lobectomy was higher than patients received wedge resection. However, regarding DFS and RFS, the three surgical approaches showed no significant difference.

To unravel the transmission dynamics and spillover events of AIVs from avian reservoirs to swine, full-length hemagglutinin (HA) sequences of AIV subtypes (n = 11) reported from various avian species and swine were retrieved from the ‘Influenza Research Database’. Phylogenetic analysis identified closely related avian and swine AIV sequences suggesting potential spillover events from multiple domestic and wild avian species, including chicken, duck, pigeon, goose, quail, and aquatic birds to swine. Furthermore, N-linked glycosylation analysis of these closely related AIV sequences supported the possibility of multiple spillover events of highly pathogenic H5N1 and low pathogenic H9N2 viruses from various avian species to swine. The principal coordinate analysis further validated these findings for H5N1 and H9N2 viruses; however, spillover events of the other nine AIV subtypes were limited. Interestingly, the presence of potential mammalian adaptation markers, particularly in some of the swine H5N1, H7N9, and H9N2 viruses, suggested that these viruses may have already adapted in swine. The occurrence and circulation of these AIVs in swine, especially the H5N1 and H9N2 viruses with numerous spillover events from the avian reservoirs to swine, pose a significant threat in terms of their reassortment with endemic swine viruses or circulating human influenza viruses within the swine which may facilitate the emergence of a novel influenza virus strain with pandemic potential.","Chauhan, Ravendra P.; Gordon, Michelle L.",Virus Genes,197,1

Kessler, M.D., former FDA commissioner (Revelle, 1995). Screening donated blood for infectious diseases that can be transmitted through blood transfusion is very important in ensuring safety. The United States has the safest blood supply in the world (Revelle, 1995), and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is striving to keep it safe by decreasing the risk of infectious disease transmission. The regulatory agency is continuously updating its requirements and standards for collecting and processing blood. An important step in ensuring safety is the screening of donated blood for infectious diseases. In the United States, tests for infectious diseases are routinely conducted on each unit of donated blood, and these tests are designed to comply with regulatory requirements (Table 21.1). The field of clinical microbiology and virology is now moving into the focus of molecular technology. Currently, nucleic acid testing techniques have been developed to screen blood and plasma products for evidence of very recent viral infections that could be missed by conventional serologic tests. It is time for all blood safety staffs to use molecular detection techniques. This approach can significantly aid in blood safety to reduce the risk of transmission of serious disease by transfusion. This chapter will review the current antigen/antibody–based technology, molecular biological technology, and published regulatory policy data for blood safety.","Hu, Yuan; Hirshfield, Irvin",Advanced Techniques in Diagnostic Microbiology,197,1

Its incidence has substantially increased over the past decades and overall mortality has declined during this period of time. It was reported that sepsis incidence increased from 82.7 to 240.4 per 100,000 population between 1979–2000. At the same time, sepsis global mortality decreased from 27.8 to 17.9% [1–3]. However, the absolute number of deaths significantly increased from 21.9 to 43.9 per 100,000 population. Male gender, some chronic diseases like diabetes, immunosuppressive states, human immunodeficiency virus infections, and malignancies are factors that increase the risk for sepsis. Some particular conditions like progressive number of organ dysfunctions, in-hospital-acquired infections and increasing age are associated with higher risk of death [1,4]. On the other hand, septic shock mortality only diminished from 61.6 to 53.1% [5]. This slight decline in mortality observed during recent decades could be attributable to improvements in supportive care and/or avoidance of iatrogenic complications. For example, the instrumentation of early goal resuscitation protocols not aiming at supranormal targets for cardiac output and oxygen delivery, and the use of lung protective strategies could explain at least in part this favorable change. Other strategies directed to treat the pathophysiological mechanisms involved in the septic process like recombinant human-activated protein-C (rhAPC), have also contributed to improve survival. However, mortality remains unacceptably high and further improvement in sepsis management is needed.","Hurtado, F. J.; Buroni, M.; Tenzi, J.",Intensive and Critical Care Medicine,197,1

These complications may involve injuries, aggression by pathogens, pollution, hormonal variations, genetic pre-disposition, unbalanced nutrition and onset of diseases. Although the microbial reconfiguration provoked by these stressors are not immediately evident as in the case of an afflicted visible organ where the abnormality is readily observable, the biological perturbations induced manifest themselves in form of various illnesses. The disruption of a working microbiome is referred to as dysbiosis and is a condition whereby the fine balance between the microbial communities and the host is distressed. Diseases such as cancer, irritable bowel syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, acne, gastric ulcers, obesity and hypertension can ensue. The pathogeneses of some pulmonary disorders, digestive complications and neurological abnormalities can be traced to the imbalance in the constituents of the microbiome. However, rebiosis, the re-establishment of the native microbiota is proving to be an excellent remedy against this condition. Probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics are potent therapeutic tools designed to rectify this situation. Probiotics such as Lactobacillus spp are more or less like stem cells utilized to replenish and rejuvenate the microbiome while prebiotics like fructose oligosaccharides (FOS) are microbiome fertilizers akin to mineral supplements or energy nutrients aimed at promoting the proliferation of select microbes in the invisible organ. Synbiotics is a combination of both probiotics and prebiotics in a proper dosage aimed at remedying dysbiosis. The molecular understanding of dysbiosis and rebiosis will offer a very effective non-invasive means in preventing and curing diseases with probiotics and prebiotics.

Later on, animal cell culture became essential for scientific research, diagnosis and biotechnological activities. Along with this development, biosafety concerns have emerged pointing to the risks for human health and in a lesser extent for the environment associated to the handling of animal cell cultures. The management of these risks requires a thorough risk assessment of both the cell cultures and the type of manipulation prior the start of any activity. It involves a case-by-case evaluation of both the intrinsic properties of the cell culture genetically modified or not and the probability that it may inadvertently or intentionally become infected with pathogenic micro-organisms. The latter hazard is predominant when adventitious contaminants are pathogenic or have a better capacity to persist in unfavourable conditions. Consequently, most of the containment measures primarily aim at protecting cells from adventitious contamination. Cell cultures known to harbour an infectious etiologic agent should be manipulated in compliance with containment measures recommended for the etiologic agent itself. The manipulation of cell cultures from human or primate origin necessitates the use of a type II biosafety cabinet. The scope of this chapter is to highlight aspects relevant for the risk assessment and to summarize the main biosafety recommendations and the recent technological advances allowing a mitigation of the risk for the handling of animal cell cultures.","Herman, Philippe; Pauwels, Katia",Animal Cell Culture,197,1

How to classify these unexpected ones is attracting more and more attention. However, traditional classification techniques can’t classify correctly unexpected instances, because the trained classifier has no knowledge about these. In this paper, we propose a novel entropy-based method to the problem. Finally, the experiments show that the proposed method outperforms previous work in the literature.","Sha, Chaofeng; Xu, Zhen; Wang, Xiaoling; Zhou, Aoying",Advances in Data and Web Management,197,1

Isolation may be done in single rooms or in special isolation units. A modern isolate for patients with infections comprises (1) a sluice with a good space for dressing and undressing of personal protective equipment (PPE) and for hand hygiene, (2) a large patient room and (3) a bathroom/disinfection room with own decontaminator or autoclave and with separate entrance from the patient’s room. Isolates for airborne and droplet-transmitted infections have in addition a defined negative air pressure and hepafiltered exhaust. In all isolates, doors must be closed in such a way that contaminants do not escape the isolate. A modern isolate for patients with impaired immune defence is similar to the infection isolates, with following exceptions: usually no need for decontaminator, hepafiltered clean air into the room and with a defined positive air pressure. A positive pressure isolate should never be used for patients with infections, and a negative pressure isolate should never be used for patients with impaired immune defence, except if the patient also has an infection that needs isolation.","Andersen, Bjørg Marit",Prevention and Control of Infections in Hospitals,197,1

However, there is limited high-level evidence to support its use. Early randomized trials did not show a benefit, though these studies were hampered by high mortality rates, limited experience with ECMO, and antiquated technology. Since the advent of more advanced circuit components and increased experience with the use of this technology, survival rates with ECMO for ARDS have improved. There is only one randomized trial to date which used a more modern ECMO circuit. This trial, which has significant limitations, demonstrated a survival benefit from referral to a specialized center for consideration for ECMO. However, a prospective randomized trial comparing ECMO, using modern equipment, to standard-of-care mechanical ventilation has yet to be performed. There are no universally accepted guidelines for initiation of ECMO for ARDS, however suggested criteria include PaO(2) to FIO(2) ratio less than 80, uncompensated respiratory acidosis, and excessively high plateau airway pressures despite optimal ventilator management. Relative contraindications include prolonged ventilation at high airway pressures or high FIO(2), contraindications to anticoagulation, and concurrent severe, irreversible comorbidities.","Abrams, Darryl; Bacchetta, Matthew; Brodie, Daniel",Extracorporeal Life Support for Adults,197,1

26250,26250,26250,Time and Travel,14.075011,4.9791417,2005,"In the era of globalization, internationalized representations of infectious disease threats have profound implications for understandings of infectious disease problems and their management in developing countries, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa. By examining the policy implications of the key narratives around public health, animal health and trade, it becomes possible to clarify the relationship between global understandings of infectious disease risk and their impact on the development of local responses to disease problems. We highlight the tensions that resource-constrained countries face in the nexus of animal health-public health and trade, including the perception that resource-constrained countries are both source and victims of potential infectious disease threats. Given this scenario, it is important to think about how developing countries, particularly those in Sub-Saharan Africa, can approach infectious disease risk management as it relates to pandemic scale threats such as avian and pandemic influenza. We outline some of the key considerations in defining and assessing disease risk using avian and pandemic influenza in Zambia as an example. We conclude that the key to the feasibility of the analysis of the risk of multi-sectoral affecting emerging infectious diseases such as zoonotic avian influenza is flexibility in how risk is framed across the public health, animal health and trade systems.","Mwacalimba, Kennedy","International Farm Animal, Wildlife and Food Safety Law",197,1

Such structure-function information can be obtained if we characterize and compare the function of wild-type and chemically or genetically modified transporters by using these techniques. The latter also includes naturally occurring mutations that are the source of various diseases; this is an important feature for the understanding and curing of such diseases. For many of the transporters the amino acid sequence and the possible orientation of the protein in the membrane, or even the three-dimensional structures have been determined. In this chapter on Examples of Applications of Electrophysiology, we will illustrate the strategy of an electrophysiologist in investigating structure, function and regulation of membrane transport using as an example the Na(+),K(+)-ATPase, the neurotransmitter transporter GAT (Na(+)-dependent GABA transporter), and the nucleotide receptors that form channels in the presence of extracellular ATP. For an understanding of drug action as well as the development of new drugs for the treatment of diseases, electrophysiology is a powerful method to elucidate drug receptor interaction. As an example, this will be illustrated for viral ion channels that are essential for virus reproduction.","Rettinger, Jürgen; Schwarz, Silvia; Schwarz, Wolfgang",Electrophysiology,197,1

Rank fusion is a relatively recent method for combining runs from multiple systems into a single ranking, and has been shown to significantly improve the ranking. This paper presents a novel extension to coordination level matching, by applying rank fusion to each sub-clause of a Boolean query. We show that, for the tasks of systematic review screening prioritisation and stopping estimation, our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art learning to rank and bag-of-words-based systems for this domain. Our fully automatic, unsupervised method has (i) the potential for significant real-world cost savings (ii) does not rely on any intervention from the user, and (iii) is significantly better at ranking documents given only a Boolean query in the context of systematic reviews when compared to other approaches.","Scells, Harrisen; Zuccon, Guido; Koopman, Bevan",Advances in Information Retrieval,197,1

Recent advances in distributed word representations address the word mismatch problem by enabling semantic matching. However, most existing models rank documents based on semantic matching between query and document terms without an explicit understanding of the relationship of the match to relevance. To consider semantic matching between query and document, we propose an unsupervised semantic matching model by simulating a user who makes relevance decisions. The primary goal of the proposed model is to combine the exact and semantic matching between query and document terms, which has been shown to produce effective performance in information retrieval. As semantic matching between queries and entire documents is computationally expensive, we propose to use local contexts of query terms in documents for semantic matching. Matching with smaller query-related contexts of documents stems from the relevance judgment process recorded by human observers. The most relevant part of a document is then recognized and used to rank documents with respect to the query. Experimental results on several representative retrieval models and standard datasets show that our proposed semantic matching model significantly outperforms competitive baselines in all measures.","Montazeralghaem, Ali; Rahimi, Razieh; Allan, James",Advances in Information Retrieval,197,1

Prompt diagnosis is critical because TAFRO syndrome is a progressive and life threating disease. Some cases are refractory to immunosuppressive treatments. Renal impairment is frequently observed in patients with TAFRO syndrome, and some severe cases require hemodialysis. Histological evaluation is important to understand the pathophysiology of TAFRO syndrome. However, systemic histopathological evaluation through autopsy in TAFRO syndrome has been rarely reported previously. CASE PRESENTATION: A 46-year-old Japanese man with chief complaints of fever and abdominal distension was diagnosed with TAFRO syndrome through imaging studies, laboratory findings, and pathological findings on cervical lymph node and bone marrow biopsies. Interleukin (IL)-6 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels were remarkably elevated in both blood and ascites. Methylprednisolone (mPSL) pulse therapy was initiated on day 10, followed by combination therapy with PSL and cyclosporine A. However, the amount of ascites did not respond to the treatment. The patient became anuric, and continuous renal replacement therapy was initiated from day 50. However, the patient suddenly experienced cardiac arrest associated with myocardial infarction (MI) on the same day. Although the emergent percutaneous coronary intervention was successfully performed, the patient died on day 52, despite intensive care. Autopsy was performed to ascertain the cause of MI and to identify the histopathological characteristics of TAFRO syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial peritonitis, systemic cytomegalovirus infection, and Trichosporon asahii infection in the lungs were observed on autopsy. In addition, sepsis-related myocardial calcification was suspected. Management of infectious diseases is critical to reduce mortality in patients with TAFRO syndrome. Although the exact cause of MI could not be identified on autopsy, we considered embolization by fungal hyphae as a possible cause. Endothelial injury possibly caused by excessive secretion of IL-6 and VEGF contributed to renal impairment. Fibrotic changes in anterior mediastinal fat tissue could be a characteristic pathological finding in patients with TAFRO syndrome.","Hibi, Arata; Mizuguchi, Ken; Yoneyama, Akiko; Kasugai, Takahisa; Kamiya, Keisuke; Kamiya, Keisuke; Ito, Chiharu; Kominato, Satoru; Miura, Toshiyuki; Koyama, Katsushi",,197,1

The following classes of compounds are considered as the basis for modification: polycyclic antibacterial glycopeptides of the vancomycin group, classical macrolides, antifungal polyene macrolides, the antitumour antibiotic olivomycin A, antitumour anthracyclines and broad-spectrum antibiotics, in particular, oligomycin A, heliomycin and some other. Main trends in the design of modern anti-infective and antitumour agents over this period are considered in relation to original natural antibiotics, which have been independently discovered by Russian researchers. It is shown that a new type of hybrid structures can, in principle, be synthesized based on glycopeptides, macrolides and other antibiotics, including heterodimers containing a new benzoxaborole pharmacophore. The review addresses the influence of the length of the spacer between two antibiotic molecules on the biological activity of hybrid structures. A combination of genetic engineering techniques and methods of organic synthesis is shown to be useful for the design of new potent antifungal antibiotics based on polyenes of the amphotericin B group. Many new semi-synthetic analogues exhibit important biological properties, such as a broad spectrum of activity and low toxicity. Emphasis is given to certain aspects related to investigation of a broad range of biological activity and mechanisms of action of new derivatives.

Although the scientific discourse is working hard to keep pace with these rapid changes, there is nevertheless a considerable deficit in research on the problems and risks as well as the potential and opportunities associated with intensifying processes of internationalization. This paper focuses on the internationalization process of small and medium‐sized tourism enterprises (SMTEs) in the Middle East, specifically in the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, which continues to be a tourist destination for Westerners in spite of major political and other crises. Internationalization of SMTEs is a complex process, and studies that take a more holistic view of this phenomenon are needed. This paper will therefore attempt to investigate the internationalization process in Jordan from a problem‐centred perspective and to critically examine and discuss it on the basis of comments made by leading actors in the Jordanian tourism business. The thus gained insights should help to reduce the still existing theoretical deficits in the study of the internationalization process. Particularly, the impact of the Arab Spring on the Jordanian tourism market must be included in a critical assessment.

Nevertheless, they represent a neglected area in the field of health technology assessment (HTA) due to various methodological issues and their complex design that goes beyond clinical setting. The present study provides an environmental scan of HTA initiatives related to the assessment of PH technologies on a global level. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey among 85 HTA-related European and international societies, health bodies, and networks from September 2018 to January 2019. The questionnaire contained four sections and 18 questions regarding activities related to the evaluation of PH technologies, information on existing PH technologies, and methodologies of assessment as well as barriers and facilitators to reaching a decision and implementing a PH technology. Results: Among 52 survey responses, the majority of the respondents came from European countries (35%), followed by North American (27%), and South American (19%) countries. The main type of organizations covered by our survey included HTA agencies, public administrations, and research institutes. Seventy-one % of the institutions reported engagement in any aspect of HTA in the area of PH (N = 37). Among those, 81% evaluated less than 5 PH technologies from 2013 to 2018. The most common barriers for reaching a decision on PH technologies were lack of data, conflicting stakeholder priorities, and methodological issues. A total of 76 PH interventions were reported, and most cited initiatives were related to chronic disease screening, prevention of infectious diseases, and maternal, prenatal, and neonatal screening. Conclusion: Our survey reported a rather limited involvement of HTA in the evaluation of PH technologies. In particular, an evaluation of behavioral and lifestyle interventions remains extremely rare. The implementation of collaborative HTA approaches in the setting of PH practice and policy needs to be prioritized and further strengthened. Moreover, ensuring reliable data structures and consolidation of HTA methods for the evaluation of PH technologies will be crucial for tackling the enormous burden of non-communicable diseases in societies.","Stojanovic, Jovana; Wübbeler, Markus; Geis, Sebastian; Reviriego, Eva; Gutiérrez-Ibarluzea, Iñaki; Lenoir-Wijnkoop, Irene",Front Public Health,197,1

To address this issue, we propose a novel multi-information source Heterogeneous Information Network (HIN) to model EHR while incorporating external medical knowledge including ICD-9-CM and MeSH for an enriched network schema. Our model is well aware of the structure of EHR as well as the correlations between medical concepts it refers to, and learns semantically reflective medical concept embeddings.

METHODS: Eighty cardiac patients with previous sternotomy and giant left ventricle according to the diagnostic criteria that left ventricular end diastolic diameter (LVEDD) was ≥70 mm, who underwent mitral valve surgery at our center from January 2006 to January 2019 were analyzed. We divided all patients into minimally invasive beating heart technique group (n = 30) and conventional median resternotomy arrested heart technique group (n = 50) according to the surgical methods. Preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative variables were compared between two groups. RESULTS: Minimally invasive beating heart technique compared to the conventional median resternotomy arrested heart technique for mitral valve surgery in the cardiac patients with previous sternotomy and giant left ventricle had significant differences in operation time(P = 0.002), cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) time(P < 0.001), intraoperative blood loss(P < 0.001), postoperative transfusion ratio(P = 0.01), postoperative transfusion amount(P < 0.001), postoperative drainage volume(P = 0.001), extubation time(P = 0.04), intensive care unit (ICU) stay time(P = 0.04) and postoperative hospital stay time(P < 0.001), but no significant differences in re-exploration for bleeding, postoperative 30-day mortality, postoperative complications and 6 months postoperative echocardiographic parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Using the method of minimally invasive beating heart technique for mitral valve surgery in the cardiac patients with previous sternotomy and giant left ventricle is effective and reliable, meanwhile reduce the operation time and CPB time, decrease the transfusion ratio and transfusion amount, shorten postoperative ICU stay and hospital stay time, promote the early extubation so that accelerate the patients’ early recovery.

Empirical Bayes methods enable the updating of observed probability distributions for which the parameters of the prior distribution are estimated from the data. This paper presents an approach of smoothing decision trees predictive binary probabilities with an empirical Bayes method. The update of probability distributions associated with tree leaves creates a correction concentrated on small-sized leaves, which improves the quality of probabilistic tree predictions. The amplitude of these corrections is used to generate predictive belief functions which are finally evaluated through the ensemblist extension of three evaluation indexes of predictive probabilities.","Sutton-Charani, Nicolas",Information Processing and Management of Uncertainty in Knowledge-Based Systems,197,1

Given a diachronic corpus of papers from a particular field of study, published over a period of a number of years, we extract latent topics and train an ordinal regression model to predict publication years based on topic distributions. Using the prediction error we calculate a real-number based innovation score, which may be used to complement citation analysis in identifying potential breakthrough publications. The innovation score we had proposed previously could not be compared for papers published in different years. The main contribution we make in this work is adjusting the innovation score to account for the publication year, making the scores of papers published in different years directly comparable. We have also improved the prediction accuracy by replacing multiclass classification with ordinal regression and Latent Dirichlet Allocation models with Correlated Topic Models. This also allows for better understanding of the evolution of research topics. We demonstrate our method on two corpora: 3,577 papers published at the International World Wide Web Conference (WWW) between the years 1994 and 2019, and 835 articles published in the Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation (JASSS) from 1998 to 2019.","Savov, Pavel; Jatowt, Adam; Nielek, Radoslaw",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,197,1

Furthermore, continuous health monitoring using RHMS is a hopeful solution for elderly people suffering from chronic diseases. RHMS is in general three tiers architecture where the first tier uses intelligent wearable sensors to gather physiological signs. The majority of wearable sensors constructors commercialized sensing devices with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication interfaces, which lead to the development of diverse RHMS deploying BLE communication interfaces for physiological patient data gathering. In this paper, we introduce the basic concepts related to RHMS design and development. Besides that, we focus our investigation on the BLE communication protocol used in the healthcare context and its configuration to sense several physiological data.

For example, inductive and coinductive datatypes can be built modularly from bounded natural functors (BNFs), a class of well-behaved type constructors. Composition, fixpoints, and—under certain conditions—subtypes are known to preserve the BNF structure. In this paper, we tackle the preservation question for quotients, the last important principle for introducing new types in HOL. We identify sufficient conditions under which a quotient inherits the BNF structure from its underlying type. We extend the Isabelle proof assistant with a command that automates the registration of a quotient type as a BNF by lifting the underlying type’s BNF structure. We demonstrate the command’s usefulness through several case studies.","Fürer, Basil; Lochbihler, Andreas; Schneider, Joshua; Traytel, Dmitriy",Automated Reasoning,197,1

However, the decidability and complexity of constraints on multisets has been much less studied and understood than for constraints on sets. In this presentation, we outline an efficient decision procedure for reasoning about multisets with cardinality constraints. We describe how to translate, in linear time, multisets constraints to constraints in an extension of quantifier-free linear integer arithmetic, which we call LIA*. LIA* extends linear integer arithmetic with unbounded sums over values satisfying a given linear arithmetic formula. We show how to reduce a LIA* formula to an equisatisfiable linear integer arithmetic formula. However, this approach requires an explicit computation of semilinear sets and in practice it scales poorly even on simple benchmarks. We then describe a recent more efficient approach for checking satisfiability of LIA*. The approach is based on the use of under- and over-approximations of LIA* formulas. This way we avoid the space overhead and explicitly computing semilinear sets. Finally, we report on our prototype tool which can efficiently reason about sets and multisets formulas with cardinality constraints.","Piskac, Ruzica",Automated Reasoning,197,1

Online Gamified Learning Platforms (OGLPs) are helpful for tertiary education and adult learning, especially for courses involves practical skills. This research aims to identify factors that have significant impacts on tourism and hospitality students to choose OGLPs as their learning tool. This research is based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model. According to the conditions of OGLPs, a new variable ‘perceived playfulness’ is added and also combined with other theory with variables ‘knowledge improvement’, ‘engagement’, and ‘immersion’. 272 valid data were collected through questionnaires survey. Data analysis was performed by adopting SmartPLS. The results of the research implied that knowledge improvement, engagement, and immersion influence expectancy of performance and effort. The study has verified the applicability of UTAUT with concepts of fun and learning on studying the tools for gamified learning and participatory learning approaches. It also offers some recommendations for developers of OGLPs to optimize the design of OGLPs as well as a new model for studying the gamified learning and participatory learning approaches.","Ng, Kenneth Shiu-Pong; Lai, Ivan Ka-Wai; Ng, Kwan-Keung",Blended Learning,197,1

To achieve this for the German Dalmatian dog population, 307 purebred animals of this breed were genotyped on the Illumina Canine high density BeadChip. The analysis of pedigree-based inbreeding was performed based on a pedigree with 25,761 dogs including the genotyped dogs. RESULTS: The effective population size derived from squared correlation coefficients between SNP alleles (r(2)) was 69. The maximum value of r(2) was 0.56, resulting in a 50% decay value of 0.28 at a marker distance of 37.5 kb. The effective population size calculated from pedigree data using individual increase in inbreeding over equivalent generations was 116. The pedigree inbreeding coefficient was 0.026. The genomic inbreeding coefficient based on the length of runs of homozygosity (ROH) was calculated for seven length categories of ROHs, and ranged from 0.08 to 0.28. The fixation coefficients F(IS_PED) and F(IS_GENO) were at 0.017 and 0.004. PANTHER statistical overrepresentation analysis of genes located in consensus ROHs revealed highly underrepresented biological processes in 50% of the investigated dogs. One of those is the 0.28 fold enriched “immune response”, which might be associated to the high prevalence of allergic dermatitis in the breed. Candidate genes for congenital sensorineural deafness (CCSD, a highly prevalent disease in the Dalmatian) were discovered in consensus ROHs. CONCLUSIONS: The fast decay of r(2) and the moderate inbreeding coefficients indicate that the German Dalmatian dog population is rather diverse. Pedigree- and genomic-based inbreeding measures were highly correlated and therefore prove good reliability for the given population. Analyses of consensus ROHs with genes coding for deafness and other breed-defining traits, such as hyperuricosuria, indicate that those ROH became fixed in the Dalmatian population about 500 years ago. In case of the Dalmatian dog, a ROH of 40 SNPs length is enough to investigate signatures of selection (e.g. the ROH with the fixed hyperuricosuria mutation) as far back as the breed formation point approximately 500 years ago.","Vasiliadis, Danae; Metzger, Julia; Distl, Ottmar",Canine Med Genet,197,1

The nutritional status of pediatric patients with SV undergoing a bidirectional Glenn (BDG) procedure vitally affects the feasibility of the next operation stages. To explore the nutritional status and to identify specific anthropometric parameters relevant to short-term surgical outcomes in children with SV after the BDG procedure, this study included 151 patients who underwent the BDG procedure. Anthropometric assessments and Infant and Child Feeding Index (ICFI) scores were used to evaluate nutritional status. There was a significant statistical correlation between ICFI and malnutrition in both the height-for-age Z-score (HAZ) and weight-for-age Z-score (WAZ) groups (P < 0.05). The clinical data, including ventilation time, nosocomial infection presence, pressure injury presence, peritoneal dialysis status, and total intensive care unit days, after BDG surgery were significantly different among the HAZ groups (P < 0.05), while nosocomial infection was different among the WAZ groups (P < 0.05). Children after BDG procedure had a high incidence of malnutrition, in addition to disease factors, the type and frequency of dietary intake were also important factors leading to worse clinical outcomes during hospitalization. Therefore, it is vital to maintain an optimal nutritional status in infants with SV who are undergoing a series of surgical procedures.","Luo, Wen-Yi; Xu, Zhuo-Ming; Zhang, Yue-Yue; Hong, Li; Zhang, Ming-Jie; Zhang, Ya-Qing",Pediatr Cardiol,197,1

METHODS: Ventilated neonatal patients admitted into the neonatology department between January 2017 and January 2018 were divided into VAP (n = 30) and non-VAP (n = 30) groups. Serum sTREM, procalcitonin (PCT), C-reactive protein and interleukin-6 levels were measured at 0, 24, 72, and 120 h after initiation of mechanical ventilation (MV). Correlations between blood biomarker concentrations and VAP occurrence were analyzed. Predictive factors for VAP were identified by logistic regression analysis and Hosmer-Lemeshow test, and the predictive value of sTREM-1 and biomarker combinations for VAP was determined by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. RESULTS: The serum sTREM-1 concentration was significantly higher in the VAP group than in the non-VAP group after 72 and 120 h of MV (72 h: 289.5 (179.6–427.0) vs 202.9 (154.8–279.6) pg/ml, P < 0.001; 120 h: 183.9 (119.8–232.1) vs 141.3 (99.8–179.1) pg/ml, P = 0.042). The area under the curve (AUC) for sTREM-1 at 72 h was 0.902 with a sensitivity of 90% and specificity of 77% for the optimal cut-off value of 165.05 pg/ml. Addition of PCT to sTERM-1 at 72 h further improved the predictive value, with this combination having an AUC of 0.971 (95% confidence interval: 0.938–1.000), sensitivity of 0.96, specificity of 0.88, and Youden index of 0.84. CONCLUSION: sTREM-1 is a reliable predictor of VAP in neonates, and combined measurement of serum levels of sTREM-1 and PCT after 72 h of MV provided the most accurate prediction of VAP in neonatal patients.","Zhao, Xingxing; Xu, Lixiao; Yang, Zuming; Sun, Bin; Wang, Ying; Li, Gen; Feng, Chenxi; Pan, Tao; Yu, Tian; Feng, Xing",BMC Infect Dis,197,1

Despite exhibiting different clinical phenotypes and selective neuronal loss, there are certain common features in these disorders, suggesting the presence of commonly dysregulated pathways. Identifying causal genes and dysregulated pathways can be helpful in providing effective treatment in these diseases. Interestingly, in spite of the considerable researches on NDDs, to the best of our knowledge, no dysregulated genes and/or pathways were reported in common across all the major NDDs so far. In this study, for the first time, we have applied the three-way interaction model, as an approach to unravel sophisticated gene interactions, to trace switch genes and significant pathways that are involved in six major NDDs. Subsequently, a gene regulatory network was constructed to investigate the regulatory communication of statistically significant triplets. Finally, KEGG pathway enrichment analysis was applied to find possible common pathways. Because of the central role of neuroinflammation and immune system responses in both pathogenic and protective mechanisms in the NDDs, we focused on immune genes in this study. Our results suggest that ""cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction"" pathway is enriched in all of the studied NDDs, while ""osteoclast differentiation"" and ""natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity"" pathways are enriched in five of the NDDs each. The results of this study indicate that three pathways that include ""osteoclast differentiation"", ""natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity"" and ""cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction"" are common in five, five and six NDDs, respectively. Additionally, our analysis showed that Rps27a as a switch gene, together with the gene pair {Il-18, Cx3cl1} form a statistically significant and biologically relevant triplet in the major NDDs. More specifically, we suggested that Cx3cl1 might act as a potential upstream regulator of Il-18 in microglia activation, and in turn, might be controlled with Rps27a in triggering NDDs.","Khayer, Nasibeh; Mirzaie, Mehdi; Marashi, Sayed-Amir; Jalessi, Maryam",PLoS One,197,1

By applying the “individual-output” model of genetic drift to the SARS-CoV-2 diversities, we obtain I(0) < 10, which could have been achieved by one infected traveler in a long-distance flight.

Patients present with reddish or purple lesions (affected skin patches) located on the hands and/or feet, particularly fingers and toes. Detailed descriptions of biopsies of Covid toes have not been reported, and the virus called coronavirus SARS‐CoV‐2, which causes the disease COVID‐19, has not been firmly established as the cause yet as most of the patients are negative for SARS‐CoV‐2 conventional tests (in which samples are taken from the nose and/or mouth). We examined skin biopsies from seven paediatric (child) patients presenting with Covid toes during the COVID‐19 pandemic in Madrid, Spain. The presence of coronavirus SARS‐CoV‐2 was investigated by electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry (staining that uses an antibody to recognise the virus). Our findings demonstrated the presence of vascular (blood vessel) damage and SARS‐CoV‐2 viral particles within the damaged endothelial cells (internal layer of blood vessels). Although the clinical features, meaning those seen outwardly, and histopathological features, meaning those seen in tissue samples, were similar to conventional chilblains, which are caused by cold temperatures, the presence of viral particles in the blood vessels and the evidence of vascular damage, support the idea that SARS‐CoV‐2 causes the lesions. Vascular damage caused by the virus could be a key mechanism to explain Covid toes and perhaps also other types of lesions seen in patients severely affected by COVID‐19. These findings can also help us to find a treatment focused on avoiding the vascular damage caused by the virus. Linked Article: Colmenero et al.

There is an urgent need to learn how this population is managing during the pandemic. Research Design and Methods: This is a qualitative study of 24 adults aged 55 and over living alone with cognitive impairment from diverse racial/ethnic backgrounds. Participants’ lived experiences during the pandemic were elicited via 59 ethnographic interviews conducted over the phone either in English, Spanish, or Cantonese. Using a qualitative content analysis approach, interview transcripts and fieldnotes were analyzed to identify codes and themes. Results: Qualitative analysis of transcripts revealed five themes: 1) fear generated by the pandemic; 2) distress stemming from feeling extremely isolated; 3) belief in misinformation, 4) strategies for coping during the pandemic; and 5) the importance of access to essential services. Discussion and Implications: This pandemic put a spotlight on the precarity and unmet needs of older adults living alone with cognitive impairment living. Findings underscore the need to expand access to home care aides and mental health services for this population.","Portacolone, Elena; Chodos, Anna; Halpern, Jodi; Covinsky, Kenneth; Keiser, Sahru; Fung, Jennifer; Rivera, Elizabeth; Johnson, Julene K",Innov Aging,197,1

Older adults may be especially vulnerable to these psychosocial stressors and their impact on mental health outcomes. Consequently, there is an urgent need to identify protective factors for older adults. The purpose of the present study is to determine the relative contribution of coping flexibility and two distinct coping strategies, forward-focused and trauma-focused, on negative affect in older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were collected using an online survey, including questions about demographic information, coping, depression, and anxiety. Participants aged 50 and over were included in our analyses of depression (N = 800) and anxiety (N = 638). Results indicate that both higher coping flexibility and higher forward-focused coping predict lower depression and lower anxiety. In contrast, higher trauma-focused coping predicts slightly higher depressive symptoms but is not a significant predictor of anxiety. Our findings suggest that higher forward-focused coping may serve as a protective factor in older adults during the pandemic and, therefore, may be an effective treatment target for mental health interventions.","Jordan, Leslie; Woodard, John; Pena, Gabriel; Arnold-Nedimala, Naomi; Won, Junyeon; Callow, Daniel; Smith, J Carson",Innov Aging,197,22

Indeed, NK cell-based therapies induced response against hematological malignancies in the absence of adverse toxicity in clinical trials. Nevertheless, adoptive NK cell therapies are reported to have exhibited poor outcome against many solid tumors. This can be mainly attributed to limited infiltration of NK cells into solid tumors, downregulation of target antigens on the tumor cells, or suppression by the chemokines and secreted factors present within the tumor microenvironment. Several methods for genetic engineering of NK cells were established and consistently improved over the last decade, leading to the generation of novel NK cell products with enhanced anti-tumor activity and improved tumor homing. New generations of engineered NK cells are developed to better target refractory tumors and/or to overcome inhibitory tumor microenvironment. This review summarizes recent improvements in approaches to NK cell genetic engineering and strategies implemented to enhance NK cell effector functions.","Mantesso, Simone; Geerts, Dirk; Spanholtz, Jan; Kučerová, Lucia",Front Immunol,197,1
44188,44188,44188,Minding the Nation Anew: Reflections on Recent Studies of Nationalism,14.15764,4.902087,2021-01-06,"BACKGROUND: As the number of viral diseases are on the rise, it is critical to continue to innovate and advance diagnostic, treatment, and surveillance methods surrounding viral infections. Currently, one of the most reliable methods for viral infection detection are polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based assays. These assays often involve procedures of swabbing a patient, processing the sample to lyse the virus, extract, and purify it’s nucleotides, and then run the purified genetic material via PCR for detection of a gene product needed to confirm the patient’s suspected diagnosis. This process requires time to complete and is dependent on the availability of the reagents and plastics required to complete the lysis, extraction, purification, and amplification procedures. Herein, we have developed a method to detect virus off a swab using solely shaker-mill based mechanical lysis and the transfer of the viral lysate directly to a PCR based assay, bypassing the reagent heavy and time consuming extraction and purification steps. METHODS: Using Human Coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) as a model system, we spiked swabs with clinically relevant levels of the virus for proof-of-concept testing. Swabs were spiked in serial dilutions from 1.2e7 copies/mL to 1.2e1 copies/mL. The swabs were then placed in 2mL tubes with viral transport media (VTM) to mimic the specimen collection procedures in the clinic prior to processing via shaker-mill homogenization. After homogenization, 1 uL of viral lysate was run in RT-qPCR for amplification of the nucleocapsid (N) gene, qualifying viral detection from the sample. RESULTS: HCoV-229E spiked swabs were run through the two-step process of homogenization direct to RT-qPCR for viral detection. After running 54 swabs, we confidently determined our limit of detection to be 1.2e3 viral copies/mL with 96.30% sensitivity in vitro. CONCLUSION: We have successfully proven that shaker-mill homogenization provides sufficient viral lysis off swabs, where the resulting lysate can be used directly in PCR based assays for the detection of virus. This finding allows for decreased run time in traditional PCR based diagnostics and reduces the reagents and plastics required for each sample, ultimately reducing the cost and time of each viral test when compared to traditional PCR based methods.

We focus on accounting-based earnings quality measures that have several advantages for investigating agency-related earnings management behavior compared to market-based measures (e.g. value relevance studies). Fair value measurements are not restricted to specific industries, periods, circumstances, or items in our sample. Based on the applied earnings quality measure, the reviewed articles are structured into five categories: (1) earnings persistence and predictive ability, (2) discretionary accruals, (3) target beating and properties of analysts’ forecasts, (4) earnings variability, and (5) other earnings quality measures. We indicate three key findings: first, fair value measurements show mixed earnings quality; second, lower-level fair value measurements decrease earnings quality; and third, corporate governance measures enhance earnings quality. After that, we deduce six research questions for future research. We show possible extensions to previous research designs in methodology and settings. Future research should also focus on corporate governance variables to a greater extent, especially compensation and board structures. Thereby, we suggest extending the neoclassical view with behavioral aspects.","Thesing, Johannes; Velte, Patrick",J Bus Econ,197,1

However, where local governments were once among the most ardent promoters of twinning, years of austerity coupled with changing processes of financial rationalisation, have led many councils to question the value of these relationships. Today, fewer British local authorities are taking up new twinnings and some have even been involved in a process of quiet ‘untwinning’. This paper takes pause to examine what might be lost with this set of changes—it asks: just what is of value of twinning? Taking a cue from ongoing debates in the field of cultural policy studies, it advocates for a broadening and deepening of the operational concept of ‘public value’ to better account for the manifold ways that twinning can deliver pro-social benefits to British communities and their partners.","Ryan, Holly Eva; Mazzilli, Caterina",Br Polit,197,1

A literature search was performed using the Google Scholar, PubMed, and Scopus search engines covering the period from January 2000 until May 2020, corresponding to articles investigating the LCA and circular economy principles and legislation for biomedical and dental waste, their management options, and modern ways of recycling. The results showed that incineration seems to be the best management way option involved despite the mentioned drawbacks in this technology. Different adopted models are well defined for the dental field based on the 3Rs’ module (reduce, reuse, recycle). Replacing disposable products with reusable ones seems to be a good way to tackle the problem of waste in medical and dental sectors.

Where religious choice is possible and competition among different denominations for adherents is allowed by political authorities, we may speak of a religious market. As in other market economies, action in a religious economy is shaped by both supply and demand.

Not only are charts more appealing to our eye than raw data, but they also make it much simpler for us to spot trends. The old saying “a picture is worth a thousand words” also applies to charts. Managers don’t always want to look at every record in a spreadsheet; they would rather make their decisions based on trends, whether they be good or bad. By looking at trends, management can decide what actions the company should take in the future. Charts can summarize vast amounts of data and show relationships between data. Charts make it easier to see such things as what lines of product are more profitable, what the most profitable time of year is, whether the profitability of the company is on the rise or going down, what departments are doing well and which are not, and on and on. Types of charts covered in this chapter are pie, pie of pie, pie of a barchart, combination charts, treemap, sunburst, funnel, map and sparklines. The Bing Map and Map Chart allow you to chart data related to a geographical area. Sparklines are small charts displayed in individual cells.

At last, more women may enter the world economy and benefit from financial products and markets as others have for generations before them. However, the risks of digital finance as a method to achieve financial inclusion are not insignificant – including personal security issues such as vulnerability to scams, and inappropriate products for their financial circumstances. There are also broader implications for communities and society. Despite increased financial inclusion globally and improved access to digital financial services, inequality and inequity across societies in both developed and emerging economies persists. The risks and consequences of the growth and spread of digital finance must therefore be anticipated and mitigated in order for women to achieve financial inclusion and ultimately financial well-being. Through an ethical analysis of digital finance as a method to achieve financial inclusion of women, this chapter concludes that policy makers, established financial institutions, new providers, NGOs, and philanthropists engaged in the development and promotion of digital finance should recognize a concurrent responsibility to actively mitigate the forces that could threaten the well-being of women. Women with money are set to grow as an economic force. Given the right protections, all of society stands to benefit from women finally gaining the power that money affords.","Kofman, Paul; Payne, Clare",Handbook on Ethics in Finance,197,1

To this aim, the book explores the so-called “theory revolution” that began to take shape in the late 1960s, with the writing of Roland Barthes, Jacques Derrida and Michel Foucault. One focus of the investigation is the undertheorisation of gender in the work of these key theorists so that the focus of the first part of the book explored how, as opposed to death, women writers turn rather to madness as the gateway to a new authorship and agency. In this fiction, madness is re-engineered through writing into a reverse discourse describing the conditions of women’s suffering under patriarchal law. Also, the chapter summarises how more contemporary fiction explores postpostmodern (metamodern) constructions of authorship as a new transnational and global world emerges. As the writings of Coetzee, Rushdie and Mantel suggest, the author might now be seen to have a therapeutic function in an age of globalised risk and trauma: the author becomes a kind of therapist for the present and a curator of the past.","Aryan, Arya",The Post-war Novel and the Death of the Author,197,1

Recently, the bioreduction nature of herbal extracts has helped to synthesize spherical GNPs of different potential from gold salt. In this study, a fast ecofriendly method was adopted for the synthesis of GNPs using fresh peel (aqueous) extracts of Benincasa hispida, which acted as reducing and stabilizing agents. The biosynthesized GNPs were characterized by UV–VIS and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and dynamic light scattering. In addition, the in vitro antibacterial and anticancer activities of synthesized GNPs were investigated. The formation of gold nanoparticles was confirmed by the existence of a sharp absorption peak at 520 nm, corresponding to the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) band of the GNPs. TEM analysis revealed that the prepared GNPs were spherical in shape and had an average particle size of 22.18 ± 2 nm. Most importantly, the synthesized GNPs exhibited considerable antibacterial activity against different Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Furthermore, the biosynthesized GNPs exerted remarkable in vitro cytotoxicity against human cervical cancer cell line, while sparing normal human primary osteoblast cells. Such cytotoxic effect was attributed to the increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that contributed to the damage of HeLa cells. Collectively, peel extracts of B. hispida can be efficiently used for the synthesis of GNPs, which can be adopted as a natural source of antimicrobial and anticancer agent.","Al Saqr, Ahmed; Khafagy, El-Sayed; Alalaiwe, Ahmed; Aldawsari, Mohammed F.; Alshahrani, Saad M.; Anwer, Md.

However, it is unclear whether people living with dementia are at higher risk of COVID-19 due to dementia or whether there may be a biologically plausible link between dementia and COVID-19. The ApoE e4 allele is highly associated with dementia. We aimed to test the COVID-19 risk associated with dementia and the association between ApoE e4e4 allele and COVID-19 with the aim of clarifying biological vulnerability. METHODS: UK Biobank (England) participants baseline (2006 to 2010), plus secondary care data to 2017. Separate analysis tested dementia and ApoE genotype association with COVID-19 status (16th March-31st May 2020) or mortality (to March 31, 2020, plus incomplete deaths from April, 2020) in logistic models, adjusted for demographics and technical covariates. RESULTS: In 269,070 participants aged 65+, including 507(0.2%) hospitalized COVID-19 patients, those with pre-existing dementia were at increased risk of being hospitalized for COVID-19 (OR = 3.50 95% CI 1.93 to 6.34) and also for COVID-19 and death (OR = 7.30 95% CI 3.28–16.21). In 375,689 European-ancestry UKB participants, ApoE e4e4 homozygotes were more likely to be COVID-19 test positives (reaching genome-wide significance: OR = 2.24, 95% CI:1.72–2.93, p = 3.24 × 10–9) and of mortality with test-confirmed COVID-19 (OR = 4.29, 95% CI: 2.38–7.72, p = 1.22 × 10–6), compared to e3e3s homozygotes. The associations were little changed in subsets of participants who were free of diseases associated with ApoE e4 and COVID-19 severity. CONCLUSION: Dementia was found to be disproportionally common in older adults who develop severe COVID-19. We have shown a plausible genetic pathway of increased COVID-19 risk with dementia, therefore suggesting that the positive association between dementia and COVID-19 is not just the result of high cases of COVID-19 in care homes.","Masoli, J; Kuo, C L; Atkins, J; Pilling, L; Delgado, J; Kuchel, G; Melzer, D",Age Ageing,197,2

In this paper we recount a recent experience in developing and teaching a technical course focused on responsible data science, which tackles the issues of ethics in AI, legal compliance, data quality, algorithmic fairness and diversity, transparency of data and algorithms, privacy, and data protection. Interpretability of machine-assisted decision-making is an important component of responsible data science that gives a good lens through which to see other responsible data science topics, including privacy and fairness. We provide emerging pedagogical best practices for teaching technical data science and AI courses that focus on interpretability, and tie responsible data science to current learning science and learning analytics research. We focus on a novel methodological notion of the object-to-interpret-with, a representation that helps students target metacognition involving interpretation and representation. In the context of interpreting machine learning models, we highlight the suitability of “nutritional labels”—a family of interpretability tools that are gaining popularity in responsible data science research and practice.","Lewis, Armanda; Stoyanovich, Julia",Int J Artif Intell Educ,197,1

However, the relationships between pro/antioxidant, pro/anti-inflammatory status, and complex coronary instent chronic total occlusion lesions were not clear in the elderly patients with very long stent implantations. We tried to evaluate the roles of pro/antioxidant and pro/anti-inflammatory biomarkers in the diagnosis of complex reocclusion lesions in elderly patients after coronary stenting. We evaluated the expression levels of acrolein (ACR), malondialdehyde (MDA), high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), superoxide dismutase 3 (SOD3), paraoxonase-1 (PON-1), endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), and stromal cell-derived factor-1α (SDF-1α) in the elderly patients with very long stent implantations and complex reocclusion lesions. Levels of ACR, MDA, hs-CRP, and TNF-α were remarkably increased (P < 0.001), and levels of SOD3, PON-1, eNOS, and SDF-1α were decreased significantly (P < 0.001) in the elderly patients with very long stents and complex reocclusion lesions. The prooxidant and proinflammatory biomarkers were remarkably increased, as well as antioxidant and anti-inflammatory biomarkers were decreased significantly in the elderly patients with very long stent implantations and complex reocclusion lesions after coronary stenting. In conclusion, these findings indicated that the imbalance between prooxidant/proinflammatory and antioxidant/anti-inflammatory status was associated with complex reocclusion lesions, suggesting that oxidative stress and inflammation played the key roles in progression of complex reocclusion lesions in the elderly patients with very long stent implantations.","Li, Xia; Guo, Dianxuan; Chen, Ying; Hu, Youdong; Zhang, Fenglin",Oxid Med Cell Longev,197,1

An important and understudied aspect of skewness preferences is how they affect risk taking. In this paper, we design a novel laboratory experiment that elicits certainty equivalents over lotteries where the variance and skewness of the outcomes are orthogonal to each other. This design enables us to cleanly measure both skewness seeking/avoiding and risk taking behavior, and their interaction, without needing to make parametric assumptions. Our experiment includes both left- and right-skewed lotteries. The results reveal that the majority of subjects are skewness avoiding risk takers who correspondingly also take more risk when facing less skewed lotteries. Our second contribution is to link these choices to individual rank-dependent utility preference parameters estimated using a separate lottery choice protocol. Using a latent-class model, we are able to identify two classes of subjects: skewness avoiders with the classic inverse s-shaped probability weighting function and skewness neutral subjects that do not have an inverse s-shaped probability weighting function. Our results thus demonstrate the link between probability distortion and skewness seeking/avoidance choices. They also highlight the importance of accounting for individual heterogeneity.

Its upregulated expression is implicated in tumor growth, metastasis and angiogenesis, thus making it an attractive target in cancer therapeutics. Currently, a few small molecule inhibitors have been reported to inhibit Hpse, with promising oral administration and pharmacokinetic (PK) properties. In the present study, a ligand-based pharmacophore model was generated from a dataset of well-known active small molecule Hpse inhibitors which were observed to display favorable PK properties. The compounds from the InterBioScreen database of natural (69,034) and synthetic (195,469) molecules were first filtered for their drug-likeness and the pharmacophore model was used to screen the drug-like database. The compounds acquired from screening were subjected to molecular docking with Heparanase, where two molecules used in pharmacophore generation were used as reference. From the docking analysis, 33 compounds displayed higher docking scores than the reference and favorable interactions with the catalytic residues. Complex interactions were further evaluated by molecular dynamics simulations to assess their stability over a period of 50 ns. Furthermore, the binding free energies of the 33 compounds revealed 2 natural and 2 synthetic compounds, with better binding affinities than reference molecules, and were, therefore, deemed as hits. The hit compounds presented from this in silico investigation could act as potent Heparanase inhibitors and further serve as lead scaffolds to develop compounds targeting Heparanase upregulation in cancer.","Parate, Shraddha; Kumar, Vikas; , Danishuddin; Hong, Jong Chan; Lee, Keun Woo",Int J Mol Sci,197,1

A pandemic paradox emerged; while clinicians were desperate for information on a new disease, they had less time to find and evaluate the vast volume of publications at times of significant strain on healthcare systems. A multidisciplinary team undertook a weekly literature search capturing all COVID-19 publications. We also monitored free open access medical education (FOAMed) sources for emerging themes. Title and abstract screening pooled the most relevant papers for emergency medicine. Three summary types were created, a ‘Top 5 Flash Update’, a journal club and a rapid response to emerging FOAMed themes. From these summaries, three modes of dissemination were used: short written summaries, blogs and podcasts. These were amplified through social media. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective review was conducted assessing the impact of this knowledge dissemination strategy for the period of March to September 2020. RESULTS: In total, 64 687 papers were identified and screened. Of the papers included in the ‘Top 5’, 28.3% were on epidemiology, 23.6% treatment, 16.7% diagnostics, 12% prognosis, 8.7% pathophysiology with the remaining 10.7% consisting of PPE, public health, well-being and ‘other’. We published 37 blogs, 17 podcasts and 18 Top 5 Flash Updates. The blogs were read 138 343 times, the Top 5 Flash Updates 68 610 times and the podcasts had 72 501 listens.

The primary factors that define R(0) value are: a. the time duration of contagiousness (transmissibility of the diseases by direct or indirect contact with an infected person) after an individual is infected, b. the likelihood of infection per contact between a susceptible person and c. the rate of contact (number of times of an infectious person or vector (a live organism(s) or inanimate object as a tool to transfer the pathogen) with another person (St. Meth. Med Res. 1993;2:23). Other contributing factors for determining the R(0) values could be, the etiologic agent, host, environmental factors (temperature, drought, long winters, adverse weather patterns such as a hurricane), public health resources(availability toilets vs open defecation, portable water vs water reservoirs, water wells, slums, open drainage, lack of sewage treatment plant, lack of water processing facility for potable water supply, heavy metals, arsenic, fluoride contamination in water supply, the policy environment (absence decision‐making authorities / absence of civic bodies‐elected) the contact rate, including population density, social organization (e.g., integrated vs. segregated), seasonality, human social behavior, organizational behavior(s), and innate genetic & biol char (L‐phase/form bacteria), of specific pathogens. (Vaccine. 1992; 10:928). The ultimate goal of vaccination campaigns are to minimize the percentage of the population susceptible and/or at risk for that specific infectious disease(s) where the R to <1, and achieve immunity for the uninfected or infected but asymptomatic the patient which is otherwise referred to as “Herd Immunity” or “Head Protection”.","Legorreta, Nicole; Robles, Generoso; Perez, Evelyn; Villegas, Gisselle; Kannan, Subburaj",FASEB J,197,1

Methods: We retrospectively reviewed medical records of patients with pancreatic cancer who presented to our Shimizu Clinic from 2000 to 2020. Patients who survived at least twice as long as the initial prognostic estimate were selected and their treatment was reviewed. The Kampo formula and crude drugs were selected according to the Kampo diagnosis and treatment strategy, which included qi and blood supplementation; qi, blood and water smoothing; and inflammation (termed “heat”) and cancer suppression. Results: Ten patients aged 45–80 years (six males and four females) with stage IV advanced cancer were selected. All patients received hozai, which is a tonic formula, of juzentaihoto (JTT) or hochuekkito (HET) decoction. Anti-cancer crude drugs were included in the decoctions of nine patients. At the first visit, the estimated life expectancy for all patients was no more than 1 year; however, treatment with Western and Kampo medicine led to a relatively long survival period of over 2 years. Three patients were still living at the time of this writing, more than 2, 6, and 14 years after treatment initiation. Conclusion: Our results suggest that Kampo medicine may be useful for disease control and supportive care for patients with advanced pancreatic cancer.","Shimizu, Masayuki; Takayama, Shin; Kikuchi, Akiko; Arita, Ryutaro; Ono, Rie; Ishizawa, Kota; Ishii, Tadashi",Front Nutr,197,1

Convolutional neural networks (CNN), which have proven to be successful supervised algorithms for classifying imaging data, are of particular interest in the neuroscience community for their utility in the classification of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). AD is the leading cause of dementia in the aging population. There remains a critical unmet need for early detection of AD pathogenesis based on non-invasive neuroimaging techniques, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET). In this comprehensive review, we explore potential interdisciplinary approaches for early detection and provide insight into recent advances on AD classification using 3D CNN architectures for multi-modal PET/MRI data. We also consider the application of generative adversarial networks (GANs) to overcome pitfalls associated with limited data.

However, the deliberate and accidental introduction of invasive alien plants (IAPs) in the Anthropocene majorly due to the global international trade perturbed the homeostasis of our biosphere. IAPs are considered as one of the major drivers of biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation. The pervasive threats of IAPs to environmental sustainability and biosecurity are further exacerbated under the COVID-19 pandemic. The environmental disturbances resulting from IAPs can be attributed to several mechanisms/hypothesis (e.g., novel weapon (NW), enemy release (ER), and evolution of increased competitive ability (EICA), efficient reproductive attributes, and phenotypic plasticity, etc.) deployed by IAPs. Nevertheless, the interrelationship of IAPs with environmental degradation and restoration remain elusive especially in terms of ecological sustainability. Moreover, there is a dearth of studies which empirically assess the synergies of IAPs spread with other anthropogenic disturbances such as climate and land-use change. In this context, the present review is aimed to depict the impacts of IAPs on environment and also to assess their role as drivers of ecosystem degradation. The restoration prospects targeted to revitalize the associated abiotic (soil and water) and biotic environment (biodiversity) are also discussed in detail. Furthermore, the effects of IAPs on socio-economy, livelihood, and plant-soil microbe interactions are emphasized. On the other hand, the ecosystem services of IAPs such as associated bioresource co-benefits (e.g., bioenergy, phytoremediation, biopolymers, and ethnomedicines) can also be vital in sustainable management prospects. Nevertheless, IAPs-ecological restoration interrelationship needs long-term pragmatic evaluation in terms of ecological economics and ecosystem resilience. The incorporation of ‘hybrid technologies’, integrating modern scientific information (e.g., ‘biorefinery’: conversion of IAPs feedstock to produce bioenergy/biopolymers) with traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) can safeguard the environmental sustainability in the Anthropocene. Importantly, the management of IAPs in concert with circular economy principles can remarkably help achieving the target of UN Sustainable Development Goals and UN-Decade on Ecosystem Restoration.","Rai, Prabhat Kumar",ANPS,197,22

BACKGROUND Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by coronavirusis emerged as the major healthcare challenge globally. The mainstay approach to limit this virus spread is an early and accurate diagnosis of the viral infection and appropriate quarantine of patients with coronavirus infection. RESULTS Real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) offers a quick detection of the disease in either symptomatic or asymptomatic patients. In literature, there are numerous studies that underline the importance of CT as the first-step diagnostic tool in COVID-19 diagnosis. Even in asymptomatic patients, COVID-19 pneumonia may manifest with chest CT imaging abnormalities.

METHODS Risk of metachronous carcinogenesis was evaluated in 88 patients with intramucosal esophageal carcinoma (without history of metachronous esophageal or head and neck squamous cell carcinomas) who underwent endoscopic submucosal dissection from 2007 to 2008 and were endoscopically observed for > 3 years. Histologically, the papillary vessel is defined as the clock gear-like structure composed of capillaries directly penetrating the epithelium (starting from the lamina propria) and covering at least two-thirds of it, around which the tumor cells are arranged in a spiral pattern. RESULTS Median endoscopic follow-up period was 11.0 years. Cumulative 2-, 5-, and 10-year metachronous esophageal carcinoma rates were 11.4%, 20.6%, and 39.3%, respectively. Stepwise multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analysis identified multiple Lugol-voiding lesions (LVLs) as the single significant independent predictor. Cumulative 2-, 5-, and 10-year metachronous head and neck squamous cell carcinoma rates were 6.9%, 10.4%, and 19.6%, respectively. Stepwise multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analysis identified multiple LVLs, Brinkman index, papillary vessel, and younger age as significant predictive factors. Overall post-endoscopic submucosal dissection survival rates were 98.8% and 87.5% at 5 and 10 years, respectively. CONCLUSION Patients with a history of esophageal carcinoma remain at risk for metachronous carcinogenesis even > 5 years after endoscopic submucosal dissection.

MATERIALS AND METHODS A systematic review and meta-analysis of studies that utilised stentrievers in the treatment of acute ischaemic stroke was conducted. The results were compared to those of the SWIFT and TREVO 2 trials and outcome differences between Trevo (Stryker, Kalamazoo, Michigan, USA) and Solitaire (ev3/Covidien, Irvine, California, USA) were analysed statistically. RESULTS Solitaire had a lower mortality rate compared to Trevo (16.2% [95% confidence interval {CI}: 13.1%, 19.8%] versus 22.2% [95% CI: 10.8%, 40.2%]) and achieved a higher rate of functional independence (52.1% [95% CI: 46.3%, 57.8%] versus 47.6% [95% CI: 36.7%, 58.8%]). Statistical tests, however, failed to demonstrate significant differences in either functional outcomes or 3-month mortality rates. No significant differences were noted in weighted mean recanalisation rates between the Solitaire and Trevo groups. CONCLUSION Stentrievers achieve a high rate of recanalisation and functional independence in acute ischaemic stroke and have a relatively good safety profile.

Our previous case-control study demonstrated the potential survival advantage of cytoreductive surgery (CRS) plus hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) over CRS alone. This phase II study was to further investigate the efficacy and adverse events of CRS+HIPEC for Chinese patients with CRC PC. METHODS A total of 60 consecutive CRC PC patients underwent 63 procedures consisting of CRS+HIPEC and postoperative chemotherapy, all by a designated team focusing on this combined treatment modality. All the clinico-pathological information was systematically integrated into a prospective database. The primary end point was disease-specific overall survival (OS), and the secondary end points were perioperative safety profiles. RESULTS By the most recent database update, the median follow-up was 29.9 (range 3.5-108.9) months. The peritoneal cancer index (PCI) ≤20 was in 47.0% of patients, complete cytoreductive surgery (CC0-1) was performed in 53.0% of patients. The median OS was 16.0 (95% confidence interval [CI] 12.2-19.8) months, and the 1-, 2-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates were 70.5%, 34.2%, 22.0% and 22.0%, respectively. Mortality and grades 3 to 5 morbidity rates in postoperative 30 days were 0.0% and 30.2%, respectively. Univariate analysis identified 3 parameters with significant effects on OS: PCI ≤20, CC0-1 and adjuvant chemotherapy over 6 cycles. On multivariate analysis, however, only CC0-1 and adjuvant chemotherapy ≥6 cycles were found to be independent factors for OS benefit. DISCUSSION CRS+HIPEC at a specialized treatment center could improve OS for selected CRC PC patients from China, with acceptable perioperative safety.","Huang, Chao-Qun; Yang, Xiao-Jun; Yu, Yang; Wu, Hai-Tao; Liu, Yang; Yonemura, Yutaka; Li, Yan",PloS one,197,31

Preliminary data have shown that the SMART (Simplified Management of Acute stroke using Revised Treatment) criteria greatly expand patient eligibility by reducing thrombolysis exclusions, but they have not been assessed on a large scale. We evaluated the safety and efficacy of general adoption of SMART thrombolysis criteria to a large regional stroke network. METHODS Retrospective analysis of consecutive patients who received IV thrombolysis within a regional stroke network was performed. Patients were divided into those receiving thrombolysis locally versus at an outside hospital. The primary outcome was modified Rankin Scale score (≤1) at discharge and the main safety outcome was symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH) rate. RESULTS There were 539 consecutive patients, and 50.5% received thrombolysis at an outside facility. Ninety percent of the patients possessed common conventional IV rt-PA contraindications. There were no significant differences between local and network treated patients in favorable outcome (45.4% versus 37.4%; odds ratio [OR], .72; P > .09), mortality (9% versus 14%; OR, 1.6; P > .07), or sICH rate (2.6% versus 5.1%; OR, 2.0; P = .13). Multivariate analysis showed no association between receiving IV rt-PA at an outlying spoke hospital and higher rate of sICH or worse outcome at discharge. CONCLUSIONS Generalized application of SMART criteria is safe and effective.

Therefore, current American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines suggest a nosocomial antibiotic treatment for HCAP. Unfortunately, the scientific evidence supporting this is contradictory. METHODS We conducted a prospective multicentre case-control study in Spain, comparing clinical presentation, outcomes and microbial aetiology of HCAP and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) patients matched by age (±10 years), gender and period of admission (±10 weeks). RESULTS 476 patients (238 cases, 238 controls) were recruited for 2 years from June 2008. HCAP cases showed significantly more comorbidities (including dysphagia), higher frequency of previous antibiotic use in the preceding month, higher pneumonia severity score and worse clinical status (Charslon and Barthel scores). While microbial aetiology did not differ between the two groups (HCAP and CAP: Streptococcus pneumoniae: 51% vs 55%; viruses: 22% vs 12%; Legionella: 4% vs 9%; Gram-negative bacilli: 5% vs 4%; Pseudomonas aeruginosa: 4% vs 1%), HCAP patients showed worse mortality rates (1-month: HCAP, 12%; CAP 5%; 1-year: HCAP, 24%; CAP, 9%), length of hospital stay (9 vs 7 days), 1-month treatment failure (5.5% vs 1.5%) and readmission rate (18% vs 11%) (p<0.05, each). CONCLUSIONS Despite a similar clinical presentation, HCAP was more severe due to patients' conditions (comorbidities) and showed worse clinical outcomes. Microbial aetiology of HCAP did not differ from CAP indicating that it is not related to increased mortality and in Spain most HCAP patients do not need nosocomial antibiotic coverage.","Polverino, Eva; Torres, Antoni; Menendez, Rosario; Cillóniz, Catia; Valles, Jose Manuel; Capelastegui, Alberto; Marcos, M Angeles; Alfageme, Inmaculada; Zalacain, Rafael; Almirall, Jordi; Molinos, Luis; Bello, Salvador; Rodríguez, Felipe; Blanquer, Josep; Dorado, Antonio; Llevat, Noelia; Rello, Jordi",Thorax,197,1

Maneuverability is an important metric of fish robot performance, with several strategies being implemented. By far the most common control scheme for fish robot maneuvers is an offset control scheme, wherein the robot's steady swimming is controlled by sinusoidal function and turns are generated biasing bending to one side or another. An early bio-inspired turn control scheme is based on the C-start escape response observed in live fish. We developed a control scheme that is based on the kinematics of routine maneuvers in live fish that we call the ""Pulse"", which is a pattern of increasing and decreasing curvature that propagates down the body. This pattern of curvature is consistent across a wide range of turn types and can be described with a limited number of variables. We compared the performance of turns using each of these three control schemes across a range of durations and bending amplitudes. We found that C-start and Offset turns had the highest heading changes for a given set of inputs, whereas the bio-inspired Pulse turns had the highest linear accelerations for a given set of inputs. However, Pulses shift the conceptualization of swimming away from it being a continuous behavior towards it being an intermittent behavior that is built by combining individual bending events. Our bio-inspired Pulse control scheme has the potential to increase the behavioral flexibility of bio-inspired robotic fish and solve some of the problems associated with integrating different swimming behaviors, despite lower maximal turning performance.","Howe, Stephen; Duff, Andrew; Astley, Henry",Bioinspiration & biomimetics,197,1

Therefore, a systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted on this topic. DATA SOURCES Medline OVID, Embase OVID, and CINAHL were searched from their inception until February 22, 2018. STUDY SELECTION OOHS (ie, skilled nursing facilities, outpatient clinics, or community-based at home) randomized trials studying the effect of multidisciplinary rehabilitation were selected, including those assessing exercise in older patients (mean age ≥65y) after discharge from hospital after an acute illness. DATA EXTRACTION Two reviewers independently selected the studies, performed independent data extraction, and assessed the risk of bias. Outcomes were pooled using fixed- or random-effect models as appropriate. The main outcomes were mobility at and unplanned hospital readmission within 3 months of discharge. DATA SYNTHESIS A total of 15 studies (1255 patients) were included in the systematic review and 12 were included in the meta-analysis (7 assessing mobility using the 6-minute walk distance [6MWD] test and 7 assessing unplanned hospital readmission). Based on the 6MWD, patients receiving rehabilitation walked an average of 23 m more than controls (95% confidence interval [CI]=: -1.34 to 48.32; I2: 51%). Rehabilitation did not lower the 3-month risk of unplanned hospital readmission (risk ratio: 0.93; 95% CI: 0.73-1.19; I2: 34%). The risk of bias was present, mainly due to the nonblinded outcome assessment in 3 studies, and 7 studies scored this unclearly. CONCLUSION OOHS-based multidisciplinary rehabilitation leads to improved mobility in older patients 3 months after they are discharged from hospital following an acute illness and is not associated with a lower risk of unplanned hospital readmission within 3 months of discharge. However, the wide 95% CIs indicate that the evidence is not robust.","Verweij, Lotte; van de Korput, Eva; Daams, Joost G; Ter Riet, Gerben; Peters, Ron J G; Engelbert, Raoul H H; Scholte Op Reimer, Wilma J M; Buurman, Bianca M",Archives of physical medicine and rehabilitation,197,24

Although NIRS cerebral oximetry is being increasingly used in many clinical settings, interdevice technologic differences suggest potential variation in the ability to accurately acquire brain oxygenation signals. The primary objective of this study was to determine if NIRS-derived regional cerebral oxygen saturation measurements accurately account for oxygen saturation contamination from extracranial tissue. METHODS Twelve healthy volunteers had each of three NIRS devices (FORE-SIGHT [CAS Medical Systems Inc; Brandford, CT], INVOS 5100C-PB [Covidien; Boulder, CO], and EQUANOX Classic 7600 [Nonin Medical Inc; Plymouth, MN]) randomly applied to the forehead. After this, a circumferential pneumatic head cuff was positioned such that when inflated, hypoxia-ischemia would be produced in the extracranial scalp tissue beneath the NIRS cerebral oximeters. Comparisons among the three devices were made of the NIRS measurements before and following hypoxia-ischemia produced in the scalp tissue with inflation of the head cuff. RESULTS The induction of extracranial hypoxia-ischemia resulted in a significant reduction in regional cerebral oxygen saturation measurements in all three NIRS devices studied. At 5 min postinflation of the pneumatic head cuff, the INVOS demonstrated a 16.6 ± 9.6% (mean ± SD) decrease from its baseline (P = 0.0001), the FORE-SIGHT an 11.8 ± 5.3% decrease from its baseline (P < 0.0001), and the EQUANOX a 6.8 ± 6.0% reduction from baseline (P = 0.0025). CONCLUSIONS Extracranial contamination appears to significantly affect NIRS measurements of cerebral oxygen saturation. Although the clinical implications of these apparent inaccuracies require further study, they suggest that the oxygen saturation measurements provided by cerebral oximetry do not solely reflect that of the brain alone.","Davie, Sophie N; Grocott, Hilary P",Anesthesiology,197,7

Treatment options traditionally considered for these uncommon lesions have included direct surgery, endovascular therapy, or conservative management. Flow diverters represent a newer therapeutic option for BTP aneurysms but pitfalls and complications are unknown. We describe three patients with BTP aneurysms treated with flow diverter stents. METHODS All three patients had ruptured BTP aneurysms and, after loading doses of dual antiplatelet agents, underwent treatment with a flow diverter alone (two patients) or in combination with an intracranial stent (one patient). RESULTS Complications directly (two thromboembolic events) or indirectly (one hemorrhage at the external ventricular drain site, probably facilitated by the dual antiplatelet therapy) occurred in all three patients and resulted in permanent morbidity in one case. Imaging follow-up confirmed obliteration in all three patients, and no episodes of rebleeding from the aneurysms were observed at follow-up. CONCLUSIONS Flow diverters are effective in obliterating BTP aneurysms. However, given the challenges and complications encountered, especially in patients with ruptured lesions, their use must be carefully weighed against other available therapeutic modalities, including observation.","Peschillo, Simone; Caporlingua, Alessandro; Cannizzaro, Delia; Resta, Mariachiara; Burdi, Nicola; Valvassori, Luca; Pero, Guglielmo; Lanzino, Giuseppe",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,197,1

OBJECTIVE To determine the tolerability, safety, and efficacy of low-dose ketamine infusion for MS-related fatigue. METHODS In this double-blind, randomized, active-placebo-controlled trial, 18 subjects with multiple sclerosis (MS) and reported fatigue received a single intravenous infusion of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) or midazolam (0.05 mg/kg). The primary outcome was change in Daily Fatigue Severity (DFS) for 7 days following the infusion. Secondary outcomes included Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) and Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS) measured up to day 28 post-infusion. We analyzed changes in all outcomes using mixed-effect models. RESULTS In total, 18 participants were enrolled; 67% participants received ketamine. Side effects of ketamine were transient. No change in the DFS was observed after 7 days (-0.10 point; 95% confidence interval (CI): -0.32, 0.12; p = 0.40). We observed a trend in reduced FSS scores at 1 week (-5.2 points; 95% CI: -10.4, 0.14; p = 0.06) and a clinically and statistically significant reduction in MFIS score at day 28 (-13.5 point; 95% CI: -25.0, -1.98; p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS Ketamine infusions were safe and well-tolerated. While no change in DFS after 7 days was observed, secondary analyses suggest a benefit of ketamine infusion for reduction of longer term fatigue severity in people with MS.","Fitzgerald, Kathryn C; Morris, Bridget; Soroosh, Aurash; Balshi, Alexandra; Maher, Dermot; Kaplin, Adam; Nourbakhsh, Bardia",Multiple sclerosis,197,9

For eukaryotic membranes, for instance, rather than using only zwitterionic phospholipids there is now a trend to employ mixtures to simulate the lipid rafts known to be relevant for various cellular processes. In this study, we demonstrate that effects from chitosans on Langmuir monolayers are considerably higher if lipid raft compositions (ternary mixtures of dipalmitoyl phosphatidyl choline (DPPC), sphingomyelin (SM) and cholesterol) are used. Significantly, measurable effects on the surface pressure isotherms start at 10-6 mg mL-1 for chitosans in lipid rafts, to be compared with 10-2 mg mL-1 for neat dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPPC). This applies to both a commercial chitosan and chitosans soluble at physiological pH. Incorporation of these chitosans in the raft monolayers was confirmed in polarization-modulated infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (PM-IRRAS) experiments, where both the tail groups and headgroups were found to interact with chitosan. Since the effects on membrane models may be observed at such small concentrations for chitosans and probably other molecules, some studies may have to be revisited where neat phospholipids should be replaced by lipid raft compositions.","Pereira, Andressa R; Fiamingo, Anderson; de O Pedro, Rafael; Campana-Filho, Sérgio P; Miranda, Paulo B; Oliveira, Osvaldo N","Colloids and surfaces.

With the resolution revolution of single-particle electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM), rapid progress has been made for structural elucidation of isolated MPs. The next challenge is to preserve the electrochemical gradients and membrane curvature for a comprehensive structural elucidation of MPs that rely on these chemical and physical properties for their biological functions. Toward this goal, here we present a convenient workflow for cryo-EM structural analysis of MPs embedded in liposomes, using the well-characterized AcrB as a prototype. Combining optimized proteoliposome isolation, cryo-sample preparation on graphene grids, and an efficient particle selection strategy, the three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of AcrB embedded in liposomes was obtained at 3.9 Å resolution. The conformation of the homotrimeric AcrB remains the same when the surrounding membranes display different curvatures. Our approach, which can be widely applied to cryo-EM analysis of MPs with distinctive soluble domains, lays out the foundation for cryo-EM analysis of integral or peripheral MPs whose functions are affected by transmembrane electrochemical gradients or/and membrane curvatures.","Yao, Xia; Fan, Xiao; Yan, Nieng",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,197,1

The epidemiology of CMV disease is not well studied, given the difficulties in assembling representative study populations with prolonged follow-up. We hypothesized that delayed-onset CMV disease (>100 days after transplantation) occurs more commonly than early-onset CMV disease in lung transplant recipients, and is associated with an increased risk of death. METHODS We assembled a large cohort of lung transplant recipients using 2004 to 2010 International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification billing data from 3 Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality State Inpatient Databases, and identified demographics, comorbidities, CMV disease coded during hospital readmission and inpatient death. We used Cox proportional hazard multivariate analyses to assess for an independent association between delayed-onset CMV disease and death. RESULTS In the cohort of 1528 lung transplant recipients from 12 transplant centers, delayed-onset CMV disease occurred in 13.7% (n = 210) and early-onset CMV disease occurred in 3.3% (n = 51). Delayed-onset CMV pneumonitis was associated with inpatient death longer than 100 days after transplantation (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.6; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.1-2.5), after adjusting for transplant failure/rejection (aHR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.5-4.1), bacterial pneumonia (aHR, 2.8; 95% CI, 2.0-3.9), viral pneumonia (aHR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.1-2.1), fungal pneumonia (aHR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.3-2.3), single lung transplant (aHR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.0-1.7), and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (aHR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.0-1.8). CONCLUSIONS Delayed-onset CMV disease occurred more commonly than early-onset CMV disease among lung transplant recipients.

This study aimed to investigate potential risk factors for thromboembolic events in patients undergoing PED placement. METHODS Medical records of patients who underwent PED placement from April 2011 to August 2013 were reviewed. Variables including pre-procedure P2Y12 reaction unit (PRU) value, procedure time, number of PEDs deployed and perioperative neurovascular complications were recorded. Multivariate analysis was performed to identify risk factors for perioperative thromboembolic complications. RESULTS Seventy-four patients were identified. Six patients (8.1%) had changes in neurological status after PED placement including five (6.8%) thromboembolic complications and one (1.4%) delayed intracranial hemorrhage; 50.9% of patients had diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) changes on post-procedural MRI. Longer procedure time (>116 min) and multiple PED placements (>1) were statistically significant risk factors for symptomatic thromboembolic events (p<0.01). A pre-procedural PRU value >208 had an OR of 11.32 (95% CI 0.06 to 212.57) for symptomatic thromboembolic complications, but the result was not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS DWI changes on MRI occurred at a much higher rate than new neurological symptoms following PED placement. Longer procedure time and multiple PED deployment are associated with higher risks of new neurological changes due to thromboembolic events. There was a trend for an increased risk of a symptomatic thromboembolic event in patients with pre-procedural PRU values >208. Reloading (clopidogrel 600 mg) patients with preoperative PRU >208 was safe and may have a protective effect on thromboembolic events.","Tan, Lee A; Keigher, Kiffon M; Munich, Stephan A; Moftakhar, Roham; Lopes, Demetrius K",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,197,1

Multi-strand suture techniques were developed to gain improved gap resistance and ultimate force compared with the respective two-strand techniques. In vivo studies indicate that multiple strands may cause ischemia during the intrinsic healing process by decreasing the total cross-sectional area of the injured site, unless the total cross-sectional area of the sutures is not decreased. HYPOTHESIS The hypothesis was to design an in vitro study to understand the biomechanical relationship between suture calibers of core sutures with increased number of suture strands and peripheral suture on final repair strength. MATERIALS AND METHODS Sixty fresh sheep forelimb flexor digitorum profundus tendons were randomly placed into three groups (A, B, and C), each containing 20 specimens, for tendon repair. Two-, four-, and eight-strand suture techniques were respectively used in Groups A, B, and C. A simple running peripheral suture technique was used in Subgroups A2, B2, and C2. For each repaired tendon, the 2-mm gap-formation force, 2-mm gap-formation strength, maximum breaking force and maximum breaking strength were determined. RESULTS Differences in 2-mm gap-formation force and 2-mm gap-formation strength were found between Subgroups A1 and A2, B1 and B2, and C1 and C2. Between Groups A and B, A and C, and B and C, there was no difference as well. CONCLUSION Both the number of strands and the ratio between the total suture volume and tendon volume at the repair site are important for ideal repair. If the total cross-sectional area of the sutures is equal in 2-strand, 4-strand, and 8-strand procedure, there is no difference in the strength of the repair. A decrease in caliber size suture requires more passes to achieve the same strength. Instead, it is much better to use peripheral suture techniques to improve the strength of the repair with larger diameter 2-strand core sutures.","Uslu, M; Isik, C; Ozsahin, M; Ozkan, A; Yasar, M; Orhan, Z; Erkan Inanmaz, M; Sarman, H","Orthopaedics & traumatology, surgery & research : OTSR",197,24

However, it reflects the spinal mechanism of immobility rather than the subcortical mechanism of analgesia. Recently, the surgical pleth index (SPI) derived from photoplethysmographic waveform was shown to reflect the intraoperative analgesic component. This study was designed to compare the SPI values produced by equi-MAC of two commonly used volatile anesthetics, sevoflurane and desflurane. Methods: Seventy-two patients undergoing arthroscopic shoulder surgery were randomly assigned to two groups receiving either sevoflurane (n = 36) or desflurane (n = 36). General anesthesia was maintained with the respective volatile anesthetic only. A vaporizer was adjusted to maintain end-tidal anesthetic concentration at age-corrected 1.0 MAC throughout the study period. The SPI value as an analgesic estimate and the bispectral index (BIS) value as a hypnotic estimate were recorded at predefined time points during the standardized surgical procedure. Results: During the steady state of age-corrected 1.0 MAC, mean SPI values throughout the entire study period were significantly higher in the sevoflurane group than in the desflurane group (38.1 ± 12.8 vs. 30.7 ± 8.8, respectively, P = 0.005), and mean BIS values were significantly higher in the sevoflurane group than in the desflurane group (40.7 ± 5.8 vs. 36.8 ± 6.2, respectively, P = 0.008). Conclusions: Equi-MAC of sevoflurane and desflurane did not produce similar surgical pleth index values. Therefore, sevoflurane and desflurane may have different analgesic properties at equipotent concentrations.","Ryu, Kyoungho; Song, Keulame; Kim, Jia; Kim, Eugene; Kim, Seong-Hyop",International journal of medical sciences,197,1

Nearly 90% of construction jobs require manual handling of materials for approximately one half of the worker's time (1). In 2015, overexertion from lifting and lowering materials caused 30% of WMSDs among construction workers; overexertion involving pushing, pulling, holding, carrying, and catching materials caused an additional 37% of WMSDs (1). This study examined the rate and cost of WMSD claims from overexertion among Ohio construction workers during 2007-2017. Workers' compensation claims related to overexertion that were submitted to the Ohio Bureau of Worker's Compensation (OHBWC) by workers in the construction industry for injuries and illnesses occurring during 2007-2017 were analyzed. Rates and costs of allowed claims were measured by age group. Workers aged 35-44 years experienced the highest claim rate: 63 per 10,000 full-time employees (FTEs) for WMSDs from overexertion.

The question raised is whether a therapeutic system as peaceful, mild, and non-violent as homeopathy can survive and grow within a society that often displays the opposite characteristics.Much of contemporary society is more interested in fast and impressive cures, even if these may also bring side effects; whereas homeopathy can offer solutions with a personalized approach that requires long hours of case study by the homeopath to find the correct personal remedy that aims to bring about positive results, which the therapy can produce in deep chronic diseases.The conclusion drawn is that homeopathy does not readily fit within a modern and violent society that prefers quick and invasive solutions to its clinical problems.","Vithoulkas, George",Homeopathy : the journal of the Faculty of Homeopathy,197,1

These mucosal gateways are not only portals of entry for potential pathogens but homes to microbial communities that impact host health. Secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA) is the single most abundant acquired immune component secreted into mucosal surfaces and via the process of immune exclusion, shapes the architecture of these microbiomes. Not all microorganisms at mucosal surfaces are targeted by SIgA, therefore a better understanding of the SIgA-coated fraction may identify the microbial constituents that stimulate host immune responses in the context of health and disease. Chronic diseases like type 2 diabetes are associated with altered microbial communities (dysbiosis) that in turn affect immune-mediated homeostasis. 16S rDNA sequencing of SIgA-coated/uncoated bacteria (IgA-Biome) was conducted on stool and saliva samples of normoglycemic participants and individuals with prediabetes or diabetes (n=8/group). These analyses demonstrated shifts in relative abundance in the IgA-Biome profiles between normoglycemic, prediabetic, or diabetic samples distinct from that of the overall microbiome. Differences in IgA-Biome alpha diversity were apparent for both stool and saliva, while overarching bacterial community differences (beta diversity) were also observed in saliva. These data suggest that IgA-Biome analyses can be used to identify novel microbial signatures associated with diabetes and support the need for further studies exploring these communities. Ultimately, an understanding of the IgA-Biome may promote development of novel strategies to restructure the microbiome as a means of preventing or treating diseases associated with dysbiosis at mucosal surfaces.","Brown, Eric L; Essigmann, Heather T; Hoffman, Kristi L; Palm, Noah W; Gunter, Sarah M; Sederstrom, Joel M; Petrosino, Joseph F; Jun, Goo; Aguilar, David; Perkison, William B; Hanis, Craig L; DuPont, Herbert L",Infection and immunity,197,1

METHODS We conducted a systematic review with network meta-analyses to compare and rank single antiemetic drugs and their combinations belonging to 5HT₃-, D₂-, NK₁-receptor antagonists, corticosteroids, antihistamines, and anticholinergics used to prevent postoperative nausea and vomiting in adults after general anesthesia. RESULTS 585 studies (97 516 participants) testing 44 single drugs and 51 drug combinations were included. The studies' overall risk of bias was assessed as low in only 27% of the studies. In 282 studies, 29 out of 36 drug combinations and 10 out of 28 single drugs lowered the risk of vomiting at least 20% compared to placebo. In the ranking of treatments, combinations of drugs were generally more effective than single drugs. Single NK1 receptor antagonists were as effective as other drug combinations. Of the 10 effective single drugs, certainty of evidence was high for aprepitant, ramosetron, granisetron, dexamethasone, and ondansetron, while moderate for fosaprepitant and droperidol. For serious adverse events (SAEs), any adverse event (AE), and drug-class specific side effects evidence for intervention effects was mostly not convincing. CONCLUSIONS There is high or moderate evidence for at least seven single drugs preventing postoperative vomiting. However, there is still considerable lack of evidence regarding safety aspects that does warrant investigation.","Weibel, Stephanie; Pace, Nathan L; Schaefer, Maximilian S; Raj, Diana; Schlesinger, Tobias; Meybohm, Patrick; Kienbaum, Peter; Eberhart, Leopold H J; Kranke, Peter",Journal of evidence-based medicine,197,1

This extraction process, known as retrotranslocation, requires both quality-control E3 ubiquitin ligases and dislocation factors that diminish the energetic cost of dislodging the transmembrane segments of a protein. Recently, we showed that retrotranslocation of all ER transmembrane proteins requires the Dfm1 rhomboid pseudoprotease. However, we did not investigate whether Dfm1 also mediated retrotranslocation of transmembrane substrates in the inner-nuclear membrane (INM), which is contiguous with the ER but functionally separated from it by nucleoporins. Here, we show that canonical retrotranslocation occurs during INM-associated degradation (INMAD) but proceeds independently of Dfm1. Despite this independence, ERAD-M and INMAD cooperate to mitigate proteotoxicity. We show a novel misfolded-transmembrane-protein toxicity that elicits genetic suppression, demonstrating the cell's ability to tolerate a toxic burden of misfolded transmembrane proteins without functional INMAD or ERAD-M. This strikingly contrasted the suppression of the dfm1Δ null, which leads to the resumption of ERAD-M through HRD-complex remodeling. Thus, we conclude that INM retrotranslocation proceeds through a novel, private channel, which can be studied by virtue of its role in alleviating membrane-associated proteotoxicity.","Flagg, Matthew P; Wangeline, Margaret A; Holland, Sarah R; Duttke, Sascha H; Benner, Christopher; Neal, Sonya; Hampton, Randolph Y",Molecular biology of the cell,197,19

A study was undertaken to examine whether such a model affects the predicted hemodynamics in realistic intracranial aneurysm geometries. METHODS Pulsatile CFD simulations were carried out using the Newtonian viscosity model and two non-Newtonian models (Casson and Herschel-Bulkley) in three typical internal carotid artery saccular aneurysms (A, sidewall, oblong-shaped with a daughter sac; B, sidewall, quasi-spherical; C, near-spherical bifurcation). For each aneurysm model the surface distributions of shear rate, blood viscosity and wall shear stress (WSS) predicted by the three rheology models were compared. RESULTS All three rheology models produced similar intra-aneurysmal flow patterns: aneurysm A had a slowly recirculating secondary vortex near the dome whereas aneurysms B and C contained only a large single vortex. All models predicted similar shear rate, blood viscosity and WSS in parent vessels of all aneurysms and in the sacs of B and C. However, large discrepancies in shear rate, viscosity and WSS among predictions by the various rheology models were found in the dome area of A where the flow was relatively stagnant. Here the Newtonian model predicted higher shear rate and WSS values and lower blood viscosity than the two non-Newtonian models. CONCLUSIONS The Newtonian fluid assumption can underestimate viscosity and overestimate shear rate and WSS in regions of stasis or slowly recirculating secondary vortices, typically found at the dome in elongated or complex-shaped saccular aneurysms as well as in aneurysms following endovascular treatment. Because low shear rates and low WSS in such flow conditions indicate a high propensity for thrombus formation and rupture, CFD based on the Newtonian assumption may underestimate the propensity of these events.","Xiang, Jianping; Tremmel, Markus; Kolega, John; Levy, Elad I; Natarajan, Sabareesh K; Meng, Hui",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,197,1

PATIENTS AND METHODS IRARC was performed on 166 patients between June 2011 and March 2016. Prospective data were collected for patient demographics, clinical and pathologic characteristics, perioperative variables, transfusion requirements, and hospital length of stay. Thirty- and 90-day complications were classified according to the modified Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center Clavien-Dindo system. RESULTS Preoperative anemia was common (43.4%) and greatest in patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy (48.6%) (p < 0.001). Patients with preoperative anemia were significantly more likely to have an Ileal conduit (p = 0.033), higher cystectomy stage (≥pT3) (p = 0.028), and a lower lymph node yield (p = 0.031). Preoperative anemia was not associated with increased perioperative morbidity but was associated with the requirement for blood transfusion (p = 0.001). Blood transfusion required in 20.4% of patients with intraoperative and postoperative blood transfusion rate was 10.2% and 13.9%, respectively. The 30-day all complication rate and 30-day major complication rate were 55.4% and 15.7%, respectively, while 90-day all complication rate and 90-day major complication rate were 65.7% and 19.3%, respectively. Intraoperative blood transfusion was not associated with increased complications, but postoperative blood transfusion requirement was independently associated with perioperative morbidity: all 30-day complications (p = 0.003), all 90-day complications (p = 0.009), and 90-day major complications (p = 0.004). CONCLUSION The presence of preoperative anemia in patients undergoing iRARC is not associated with increased surgical risk, although preoperative anemic patients were significantly more likely to require blood transfusion. Blood transfusion requirement and specifically postoperative blood transfusion are independently associated with perioperative morbidity and are an important factor for the optimization of postoperative outcomes.","Tan, Wei Shen; Lamb, Benjamin W; Khetrapal, Pramit; Tan, Mae-Yen; Tan, Melanie El; Sridhar, Ashwin; Cervi, Elizabeth; Rodney, Simon; Busuttil, Gerald; Nathan, Senthil; Hines, John; Shaw, Greg; Mohammed, Anna; Baker, Hilary; Briggs, Timothy P; Klein, Andrew; Richards, Toby; Kelly, John D",Journal of endourology,197,12

Lesions of the infrapopliteal arteries are the result of 2 different etiologies: medial calcification and intimal atheromatous plaque. Although several devices are available for endovascular treatment of infrapopliteal lesions, balloon angioplasty still comprises the mainstay of therapy due to a lack of purpose-built devices. The mechanism of balloon angioplasty consists of adventitial stretching, medial necrosis, and dissection or plaque fracture. In many cases, the diffuse nature of infrapopliteal disease and plaque complexity may lead to dissection, recoil, and early restenosis. Optimal balloon angioplasty requires careful attention to assessment of vessel calcification, appropriate vessel sizing, and the use of long balloons with prolonged inflation times, as outlined in a treatment algorithm based on this systematic review. Further development of specific devices for this arterial segment are warranted, including devices for preventing recoil (eg, dedicated atherectomy devices), treating dissections (eg, tacks, stents), and preventing neointimal hyperplasia (eg, novel drug delivery techniques and drug-eluting stents). Further understanding of infrapopliteal disease, along with the development of new technologies, will help optimize the durability of endovascular interventions and ultimately improve the limb-related outcomes of patients with CLTI.","Giannopoulos, Stefanos; Varcoe, Ramon L; Lichtenberg, Michael; Rundback, John; Brodmann, Marianne; Zeller, Thomas; Schneider, Peter A; Armstrong, Ehrin J",Journal of endovascular therapy : an official journal of the International Society of Endovascular Specialists,197,33

Many vertebrates exhibit the ability to form and pattern normal limbs during embryogenesis from amorphous clusters of precursor cells, hinting that this process could perhaps be activated later in life to rebuild missing or damaged limbs. Indeed, some animals, such as salamanders, are proficient regenerators of limbs throughout their life span. Thus, research over the last century has sought to stimulate regeneration in species that do not normally regenerate their appendages. Importantly, these efforts are not only a vital aspect of regenerative medicine, but also have fundamental implications for understanding evolution and the cellular control of growth and form throughout the body. Here we review major recent advances in augmenting limb regeneration, summarizing the degree of success that has been achieved to date in frog and mammalian models using genetic, biochemical, and bioelectrical interventions. While the degree of whole limb repair in rodent models has been modest to date, a number of new technologies and approaches comprise an exciting near-term road map for basic and clinical progress in regeneration.","Davidian, Devon; Levin, Michael",Cold Spring Harbor perspectives in biology,197,1

RESULTS Of all the 262 patients, 23 (8.8%) patients died and 239 (91.2%) discharged. The median age was 63.5 years old and 46.9% patients were male. The main complains were fever (83.6%), cough (63.4%), and fatigue (49.2%) in the surviving group, while there were more complains of dyspnea (39.1%) and short of breath (56.5%) in the non-surviving group. The main comorbidities were hypertension (35.5%), diabetes mellitus (16.4%), and coronary artery disease (9.9%). The morbidity is higher in patients with elder age and more comorbidites. Patients were mainly treated by high flow nasal cannula (93.9%), while the non-surviving group received more invasive mechanical ventilation (39.1%). Abigail (80.9%), ribavirin (36.6%), oseltamivir (38.9%), interferon (16.4%), and ganciclovir (14.5%) were used for the anti-viral treatment. In the non-surviving group, the number of white blood cells (WBC) was significantly increased and lymphocytes were decreased, and the lymphopenia was more common. The levels of aspartate transaminase (AST), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), creatine kinase isoenzyme MB (CK-MB), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and C-reactive protein (CRP) were also significantly increased in the non-surviving group.

The patients underwent immunological examination and the collection of biomaterial from the posterior pharyngeal wall for microbiological examination. After obtaining the results of the examinations, PCV13 was intramuscularly administered. 7 days after the introduction of the vaccine, an assessment of adverse events was carried out, after 3 months, microbiological and immunological examinations were repeated. RESULTS Immediately after the administration of PCV13, 5% of patients felt pain during the administration. Local reactions were reported in 6 patients. One participant showed a rise in temperature to 38.3C over 2 days. Before vaccination, 16 strains of S. pneumoniae were seeded in patients. 3 months after the administration of PCV13, pneumococcus was isolated in 8 patients. 3 months after immunization, the median level of populations and subpopulations of lymphocytes became higher than the pre-vaccination. DISCUSSION Our results show high risk of pneumococcal infections in HIV-positive patients. A tendency towards a decrease in the level of S. pneumoniae carriage was revealed 3 months after the administration of PCV13.

METHODS IBD patients (≥18 years) at the outpatient clinic at Oslo University Hospital were included and answered a self-report questionnaire including concerns regarding their disease, medical therapy and follow-up during SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. RESULTS In total, 522 IBD patients were included, 317 Crohn's disease, 205 ulcerative colitis, 386 patients <50 years. Eighteen percent were in obligatory quarantine, and more often patients <50 years compared to patients ≥50 years. Five patients tested positive to SARS- CoV-2. A higher proportion <50 years reported worries for their medical treatment and risk of COVID -19 disease compared to those ≥50 years. Forty percent avoided family, two-thirds avoided friends, and 4% cancelled their scheduled consultation at the hospital. The hospital changed physical consultation to telephone consultation for 15% of the patients. The preferred follow-up was physical consultation. A higher proportion of the patients <50 years preferred telephone consultation compared to those ≥50 years. Four out of five IBD patients were satisfied with the information about their IBD and COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS SARS-CoV-2 pandemic affects the daily lives for patients with IBD.

Previous research on medical students' motivation mostly overlooked an important concept, namely, mastery-avoidance goals. The mastery-avoidance goal is defined as engaging in a task to avoid losing knowledge or skills that have already been acquired. We aimed to explore the role of mastery-avoidance goals in changes occurring in low frustration tolerance (LFT) levels over a span of one academic year. This approach enables us to understand which type of motivational orientation is expected to explain most adaptive educational outcomes. Methods. First year medical students (n = 241) participating in a physician-patient communication course completed the surveys of motivational orientations and LFT at the beginning and at the end of the academic year. A confirmatory factor analysis supported the construct validity of the motivational orientations structure. Results. Cross-lagged analysis using structural equation modelling revealed that the mastery-approach goal was negatively related to the progression of LFT while mastery-avoidance goal was positively related. Conclusions. The findings suggest that what matters is not merely the level of motivation, but rather the type of motivational orientations that students pursue. Encouraging students to improve their current skills, while discouraging competitiveness and reducing fear of losing competence, may enhance the effectiveness of medical training programmes.","Madjar, Nir; Bachner, Yaacov G; Kushnir, Talma",The National medical journal of India,197,1

AIMS To review published clinical pharmacology studies and clinical trials of P-CABs. METHODS We conducted a comprehensive literature search including Medline (PubMed), EMBASE, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library from inception until November 2020, for studies of the clinical pharmacology of P-CABs and relevant clinical trials of those that are currently licensed or in development. RESULTS Most publications concerned vonoprazan, which forms the bulk of this review. It is currently licensed in some Asian and South American countries and is being developed for North America. In clinically relevant doses, P-CABs have produced more rapid and profound suppression of intragastric acidity than proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). Vonoprazan was non-inferior to lansoprazole in healing erosive oesophagitis (2 randomised controlled trials [RCTs] in 1137 subjects) and superior in maintaining remission (1 RCT; 607 subjects). In 2 RCTs (1120 total subjects), both vonoprazan and tegoprazan were non-inferior to lansoprazole for healing peptic ulcers. Three RCTs and numerous non-randomised studies have compared vonoprazan-based and PPI-based regimens for Helicobacter pylori infection; vonoprazan-based triple or dual regimens have been highly effective. CONCLUSIONS P-CABs have some potential advantages over PPIs. To date, most research has been conducted in Asia; results of clinical trials that are underway in the United States and Europe are anticipated in 2021.","Abdel-Aziz, Yousef; Metz, David C; Howden, Colin W",Alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics,197,31

The standard method used to pick up laboratory mice for general husbandry and experimental procedures is known as tail handling and involves the capture, elevation and restraint of mice via their tails. There is growing evidence that, compared to non-aversive handling methods (i.e. tunnel and cup), tail handling increases behavioural signs of anxiety and induces anhedonia. Hence tail handling has a negative impact on mouse welfare. Here, we investigated whether repeated scruff restraint, intraperitoneal (IP) injections and anaesthesia negated the reduction in anxiety-related behaviour in tunnel compared with tail handled BALB/c mice. We found that mice which experienced repeated restraint spent less time interacting with a handler compared to mice that were handled only. However, after repeated restraint, tunnel handled mice showed increased willingness to interact with a handler, and reduced anxiety in standard behavioural tests compared with tail handled mice. The type of procedure experienced (IP injection or anaesthesia), and the duration after which behaviour was measured after a procedure affected the willingness of mice to interact with a handler. Despite this, compared with tail handling, tunnel handling reduced anxiety in standard behavioural tests and increased willingness to interact with a handler within hours after procedures. This suggests that the welfare benefits of tunnel handling are widely applicable and not diminished by the use of other putatively more invasive procedures that are frequently used in the laboratory. Therefore, the simple refinement of replacing tail with tunnel handling for routine husbandry and procedures will deliver a substantial improvement for mouse welfare and has the potential for improving scientific outcomes.","Henderson, Lindsay J; Dani, Bridgette; Serrano, Esme M N; Smulders, Tom V; Roughan, Johnny V",Scientific reports,197,20

It is hypothesized that a suboptimal innate immune response is responsible for the disease pathogenesis. In the study presented here we tested this hypothesis and identified several nonstructural proteins (NSPs) with innate immune evasion properties encoded by the PRRS viral genome. Four of the total ten PRRSV NSPs tested were found to have strong to moderate inhibitory effects on beta interferon (IFN-beta) promoter activation. The strongest inhibitory effect was exhibited by NSP1 followed by, NSP2, NSP11, and NSP4. We focused on NSP1alpha and NSP1beta (self-cleavage products of NSP1 during virus infection) and NSP11, three NSPs with strong inhibitory activity. All of three proteins, when expressed stably in cell lines, strongly inhibited double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) signaling pathways. NSP1beta was found to inhibit both IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3)- and NF-kappaB-dependent gene induction by dsRNA and Sendai virus. Mechanistically, the dsRNA-induced phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of IRF3 were strongly inhibited by NSP1beta. Moreover, when tested in a porcine myelomonocytic cell line, NSP1beta inhibited Sendai virus-mediated activation of porcine IFN-beta promoter activity. We propose that this NSP1beta-mediated subversion of the host innate immune response plays an important role in PRRSV pathogenesis.","Beura, Lalit K; Sarkar, Saumendra N; Kwon, Byungjoon; Subramaniam, Sakthivel; Jones, Clinton; Pattnaik, Asit K; Osorio, Fernando A",Journal of virology,197,12

Currently, two major techniques are used to isolate ASCs, namely liposuction and tissue biopsy. These two methods are relatively risk-free but the question as to which method could give a more efficient output remains unclear. Thus, this study was carried out to compare and contrast the output generated in regards to growth kinetics, differentiation capabilities in vitro, and gene expression profiling. It was found that ASCs from both isolation methods were comparable in terms of growth kinetics and tri-lineage differentiation. Furthermore, ASCs from both populations were reported as CD44(+), CD73(+), CD90(+), CD166(+), CD34(-), CD45(-) and HLA-DR(-). However, in regards to gene expression, a group of overlapping genes as well as distinct genes were observed. Distinct gene expressions indicated that ASCs (liposuction) has endoderm lineage propensity whereas ASCs (biopsy) has a tendency towards mesoderm/ectoderm lineage. This information suggests involvement in different functional activity in accordance to isolation method. In conclusion, future studies to better understand these gene functions should be carried out in order to contribute in the applicability of each respective cells in regenerative therapy.","Gnanasegaran, Nareshwaran; Govindasamy, Vijayendran; Musa, Sabri; Kasim, Noor Hayaty Abu",International journal of medical sciences,197,1

Glucocorticoids have been shown to disrupt Wnt signaling in osteoblast-lineage cells, but the efficacy for Wnt proteins to restore bone mass after glucocorticoid therapy has not been examined. Here by using two mouse genetic models wherein WNT7B expression is temporally activated by either tamoxifen or doxycycline in osteoblast-lineage cells, we show that WNT7B recovers bone mass following glucocorticoid-induced bone loss, thanks to increased osteoblast number and function. However, WNT7B overexpression in bone either before or after glucocorticoid treatments does not ameliorate the abnormal accumulation of body fat. The study demonstrates a potent bone anabolic function for WNT7B in countering glucocorticoid-induced bone loss.","Chen, Hong; Song, Fangfang; Long, Fanxin",FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,197,1

By using single-cell gel electrophoresis (comet assay), the authors determined the effect of nitrous oxide on DNA damage in circulating leukocytes. METHODS In this double-blind, randomized controlled trial, 91 patients undergoing major colorectal surgery were randomized to receive 70% nitrous oxide (n = 31) or nitrous oxide-free anesthesia using 30 (n = 30) or 80% (n = 30) oxygen. Venous blood was collected before and 24 h after surgery. The primary outcome was extent of DNA damage, quantified as the percentage of DNA staining intensity in the comet tail using digital fluorescence microscopy. Incidence of postoperative wound infection was also recorded. RESULTS Nitrous oxide exposure was associated with a two-fold increase in the percentage of DNA intensity in tail (P = 0.0003), but not in the 30 (P = 0.181) or 80% oxygen groups (P = 0.419). There was a positive correlation between the duration of nitrous oxide exposure and extent of DNA damage, r = 0.33, P = 0.029. However, no correlation was observed in nitrous oxide-free patients. The proportions of postoperative wound infection, using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria, were 19.4% (6 of 31) in the 70% nitrous oxide group and 6.7% (2 of 30) in both the 30 and 80% oxygen groups, P = 0.21. An increase in DNA damage was associated with a higher risk of wound infection, adjusted odds ratio (95% CIs): 1.19 (1.07-1.34), P = 0.003. CONCLUSIONS Nitrous oxide increased DNA damage compared with nitrous oxide-free anesthesia and was associated with postoperative wound infection.","Chen, Yan; Liu, Xiaodong; Cheng, Christopher H K; Gin, Tony; Leslie, Kate; Myles, Paul; Chan, Matthew T V",Anesthesiology,197,31

Radiolabeling of Affibody molecules with the positron-emitting nuclide 68Ga would permit the use of positron emission tomography (PET), providing better resolution, sensitivity, and quantification accuracy than single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). The synthetic anti-HER2 ZHER2:S1 Affibody molecule was conjugated with DOTA at the N-terminus, in the middle of helix 3, or at the C-terminus. The biodistribution of 68Ga- and 111In-labeled Affibody molecules was directly compared in NMRI nu/nu mice bearing SKOV3 xenografts. The position of the chelator strongly influenced the biodistribution of the tracers, and the influence was more pronounced for 68Ga-labeled Affibody molecules than for the 111In-labeled counterparts. The best 68Ga-labeled variant was 68Ga-[DOTA-A1]-ZHER2:S1 which provided a tumor uptake of 13 ± 1 %ID/g and a tumor to blood ratio of 39 ± 12 at 2 hours after injection. 111In-[DOTA-A1]-ZHER2:S1 and 111In-[DOTA-K58]-ZHER2:S1 were equally good at this time point, providing a tumor uptake of 15 to 16 %ID/g and a tumor to blood ratio in the range of 60 to 80. In conclusion, the selection of the best position for a chelator in Affibody molecules can be used for optimization of their imaging properties.

Several treatment strategies for this complication are available, but the size and quality of the scientific evidence on which these strategies are based vary considerably. The aim of this Guideline document is to assist physicians in their management decisions when treating patients with space-occupying hemispheric or cerebellar infarction. These Guidelines were developed based on the European Stroke Organisation (ESO) standard operating procedure and followed the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. A working group identified 13 relevant questions, performed systematic reviews and meta-analyses of the literature, assessed the quality of the available evidence, and wrote evidence-based recommendations. An expert consensus statement was provided if not enough evidence was available to provide recommendations based on the GRADE approach. We found high-quality evidence to recommend surgical decompression to reduce the risk of death and to increase the chance of a favourable outcome in adult patients aged up to and including 60 years with space-occupying hemispheric infarction who can be treated within 48 hours of stroke onset, and low-quality evidence to support this treatment in older patients. There is continued uncertainty about the benefit and risks of surgical decompression in patients with space-occupying hemispheric infarction if this is done after the first 48 hours. There is also continued uncertainty about the selection of patients with space-occupying cerebellar infarction for surgical decompression or drainage of cerebrospinal fluid. These Guidelines further provide details on the management of specific subgroups of patients with space-occupying hemispheric infarction, on the value of monitoring of intracranial pressure, and on the benefits and risks of medical treatment options. We encourage new high-quality studies assessing the risks and benefits of different treatment strategies for patients with space-occupying brain infarction.","van der Worp, H Bart; Hofmeijer, Jeannette; Jüttler, Eric; Lal, Avtar; Michel, Patrik; Santalucia, Paola; Schönenberger, Silvia; Steiner, Thorsten; Thomalla, Götz",European stroke journal,197,31

METHODS In this study, 60 obese patients (26 males and 34 females) who underwent LRYGB between January and July 2010 were randomized to one of three groups (20 in each): group 1 (Nathanson liver retractor), group 2 (liver suspension tape), and group 3 (V-shaped liver suspension technique [V-LIST]). Data regarding demographics (age, sex, body mass index); liver function test (LFT) just before surgery; postoperative results immediately, then 18 h, 1 week, and 1 month after surgery; operative data, and visual analog scale (VAS) for pain on postoperative days (PODs) 1 and 2 were calculated and analyzed. RESULTS The groups did not differ significantly in terms of preoperative LFT or operative data except that group 3 took significantly longer time for liver suspension than group 1 (p = 0.01) or group 2 (p = 0.03). The VAS score in group 2 was significantly lower on POD 1 than in group 1 (p = 0.04). Group 1 showed a significant rise in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) at 18 h compared with group 2 (p < 0.01 and p = 0.02, respectively) and group 3 (p < 0.01 and p = 0.01), at 1 week compared with group 2 (p = 0.04 and 0.04), and in AST levels alone during the immediate postoperative compared with group 3 (p = 0.04). CONCLUSION The Nathanson liver retractor causes more liver dysfunction than V-LIST or the liver suspension technique and causes more postoperative pain than the liver suspension technique. Both V-LIST and liver suspension tape have a short learning curve and implications for single-port surgery.","Goel, Rajat; Shabbir, Asim; Tai, Chi-Ming; Eng, Alvin; Lin, Hung-Yen; Lee, Su-Long; Huang, Chih-Kun",Surgical endoscopy,197,1

Due to the large number of infected patients and heavy labor for doctors, computer-aided diagnosis with machine learning algorithm is urgently needed, and could largely reduce the efforts of clinicians and accelerate the diagnosis process. Chest computed tomography (CT) has been recognized as an informative tool for diagnosis of the disease. In this study, we propose to conduct the diagnosis of COVID-19 with a series of features extracted from CT images. To fully explore multiple features describing CT images from different views, a unified latent representation is learned which can completely encode information from different aspects of features and is endowed with promising class structure for separability. Specifically, the completeness is guaranteed with a group of backward neural networks (each for one type of features), while by using class labels the representation is enforced to be compact within COVID-19/community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and also a large margin is guaranteed between different types of pneumonia. In this way, our model can well avoid overfitting compared to the case of directly projecting highdimensional features into classes. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms all comparison methods, and rather stable performances are observed when varying the number of training data.","Kang, Hengyuan; Xia, Liming; Yan, Fuhua; Wan, Zhibin; Shi, Feng; Yuan, Huan; Jiang, Huiting; Wu, Dijia; Sui, He; Zhang, Changqing; Shen, Dinggang",IEEE transactions on medical imaging,197,25

However, clinical observations frequently identified neurological symptoms and neuropsychiatric disorders related to COVID-19 (Neuro-SARS2). Accumulated robust evidence indicates that Neuro-SARS2 may play an important role in aggravating the disease severity and mortality. Understanding the neuropathogenesis and cellular mechanisms underlying Neuro-SARS2 is crucial for both basic research and clinical practice to establish effective strategies for early detection/diagnosis, prevention, and treatment paradigms. In this review, we will comprehensively examine current evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in various neural cells including neurons, microglia/macrophages, astrocytes, pericytes/endothelial cells, ependymocytes/choroid epithelial cells, and neural stem/progenitor cells. Although significant progress has been made in studying Neuro-SARS2, much remains to be learned about the neuroinvasive routes (transneuronal and hematogenous) of the virus and the cellular/molecular mechanisms underlying the development/progression of this disease.

Urgent studies to identify new antiviral drugs, repurpose existing drugs, or identify drugs that can target the overactive immune response are ongoing. Antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) have been tested in past human coronavirus infections, and also against SARS-CoV-2, but a trial of lopinavir and ritonavir failed to show any clinical benefit in COVID-19. However, there is limited data as to the course of COVID-19 in people living with HIV, with some studies showing a decreased mortality for those taking certain ARV regimens. We hypothesized that ARVs other than lopinavir and ritonavir might be responsible for some protection against the progression of COVID-19. Here, we used chemoinformatic analyses to predict which ARVs would bind and potentially inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) or RNA-dependent-RNA-polymerase (RdRp) enzymes in silico. The drugs predicted to bind the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro included the protease inhibitors atazanavir and indinavir. The ARVs predicted to bind the catalytic site of the RdRp included Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors, abacavir, emtricitabine, zidovudine, and tenofovir. Existing or new combinations of antiretroviral drugs could potentially prevent or ameliorate the course of COVID-19 if shown to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and in clinical trials. Further studies are needed to establish the activity of ARVs for treatment or prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection .Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Whereas the first eight SPLC lasted longer compared to 4PLC (70 (40-140) minutes, p = 0.0435) the difference disappeared after eight procedures (p = 0.2076). Median number of burns to nontarget tissue was seven (1-16) in the first eight and one (0-8) in the following ten SPLC (p = 0.0049). There was no difference in perforation of the gallbladder. DISCUSSION Internal retraction enables a safe exposure of the Calot triangle avoiding bile spillage in cholecystectomies without intraoperative signs of inflammation. Familiarisation with SPLC was rapidly achieved. Operation time and dexterity were equal to 4PLC after eight SPLC.","Steinemann, Daniel C; Limani, Perparim; Clavien, Pierre-Alain; Breitenstein, Stefan",Minimally invasive therapy & allied technologies : MITAT : official journal of the Society for Minimally Invasive Therapy,197,31

Digital health interventions, that include modalities such as internet, smart phones, and monitoring sensors, may help increase rural residents' access to healthcare. While digital health interventions have become an increasingly popular intervention strategy to address obesity, research examining the use of technological tools for obesity management among rural Latino populations is limited. In this paper, we share our experience developing a culturally tailored, interactive health intervention using digital technologies for a family-oriented, weight management program in a rural, primarily Latino community. We describe the formative research that guided the development of the intervention, discuss the process of developing the intervention technologies including issues of privacy and data security, examine the results of a pilot study, and share lessons learned. Our experience can help others design user-centered digital health interventions to engage underserved populations in the uptake of healthy lifestyle and disease management skills.

METHODS 13 Typically Developing (TD) and 13 children with unilateral spastic CP performed elbow extension/flexion at different speeds. Elbow angle and velocity were recorded using a 3D motion analysis system. The acceleration and deceleration phases of extension were analyzed. Co-activation of the brachioradialis/triceps and biceps/triceps pairs was computed for each phase from surface electromyographic signals. Statistical analysis involved linear mixed effects models and Spearman rank correlations. RESULTS During the acceleration phase, there was strong co-activation in both muscle pairs in the children with CP, which increased with speed. Co-activation was weak in the TD children and it was not speed-dependent. During the deceleration phase, co-activation was strong and increased with speed in both groups; co-activation of brachioradialis/triceps was stronger in children with CP, and was negatively correlated with extension range and positively correlated with flexor spasticity. CONCLUSIONS Abnormal patterns of co-activation in children with CP were found throughout the entire movement. Co-activation was specific to the movement phase and to each flexor muscle. SIGNIFICANCE Co-activation in children with CP is both physiological and pathological.","Sarcher, A; Raison, M; Leboeuf, F; Perrouin-Verbe, B; Brochard, S; Gross, R",Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology,197,16

We sought to evaluate long-term impact of CRT in a single-center cohort of patients with congenital heart disease. Methods and Results Thirty-two consecutive patients with structural congenital heart disease (N=30) or congenital atrioventricular block (N=2), aged median of 12.9 years at CRT with pacing capability device implantation, were followed up for a median of 8.7 years. CRT response was defined as an increase in systemic ventricular ejection fraction or fractional area of change by >10 units and improved or unchanged New York Heart Association class. Freedom from cardiovascular death, heart failure hospitalization, or new transplant listing was 92.6% and 83.2% at 5 and 10 years, respectively. Freedom from CRT complications, leading to surgical system revision (elective generator replacement excluded) or therapy termination, was 82.7% and 72.2% at 5 and 10 years, respectively. The overall probability of an uneventful therapy continuation was 76.3% and 58.8% at 5 and 10 years, respectively. There was a significant increase in ejection fraction/fractional area of change (P<0.001) mainly attributable to patients with systemic left ventricle (P=0.002) and decrease in systemic ventricular end-diastolic dimensions (P<0.05) after CRT. New York Heart Association functional class improved from a median 2.0 to 1.25 (P<0.001). Long-term CRT response was present in 54.8% of patients at last follow-up and was more frequent in systemic left ventricle (P<0.001). Conclusions CRT in patients with congenital heart disease was associated with acceptable survival and long-term response in ≈50% of patients. Probability of an uneventful CRT continuation was modest.","Kubuš, Peter; Rubáčková Popelová, Jana; Kovanda, Jan; Sedláček, Kamil; Janoušek, Jan",Journal of the American Heart Association,197,24

One such initiative is the Kavango Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area of which Botswana's Okavango Delta constitutes a major contribution for wildlife and ecosystems. Between 2008 and 2011, we collected serum samples from 14 lions ( Panthera leo ), four leopards ( Panthera pardus ), 19 spotted hyenas ( Crocuta crocuta ), and six cheetahs ( Acinonyx jubatus ) in the Okavango. Samples were tested for antibodies against canine distemper virus (CDV), feline panleukopenia virus, enteric coronavirus, feline calicivirus, feline herpesvirus (FHV-1), and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV). Evidence of exposure to all of these pathogens was found, to varying degrees, in at least one of the species sampled. High antibody prevalence (>90%) was only found to FHV-1 and FIV in lions. Only hyenas (26%, 5/19) were positive for CDV antibody. Except for one case, all individuals displayed physical conditions consistent with normal health for ≥12 mo following sampling.

METHOD This retrospective comparative case series study involved 110 right eyes of 110 patients who underwent either SMILE (55 eyes) or AF t-PRK (55 eyes). Visual acuity, manifest refractive error and corneal higher-order aberrations (HOAs) were measured and analyzed at baseline, 1 month and 3 months after operation. The safety and efficacy indices, and vector parameters were also compared. RESULT 1 month postoperatively, the mean uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA), corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) and spherical equivalent refraction (SE) were better after SMILE than AF t-PRK (logMAR UDVA, - 0.03 ± 0.07 and - 0.006 ± 0.07, P = 0.050; logMAR CDVA, - 0.06 ± 0.07 and - 0.03 ± 0.07, P = 0.043; SE, - 0.04 ± 0.25 and 0.15 ± 0.26, P < 0.001). However, these parameters were comparable between the groups at 3 months after surgery. Residual astigmatism ≤ 0.25 diopters was observed in 74.5% and 90.9% (P = 0.023) of the eyes at one month and in 87.3% and 85.5% (P = 0.781) of the eyes at 3 months after SMILE and AF t-PRK, respectively. There were no significant differences between the groups in any of the vector parameters at 1 month or 3 months after surgery. Coma and total HOAs after SMILE were significantly higher than AF t-PRK (1 month coma, 0.49 ± 0.23 and 0.29 ± 0.15, P < 0.001; 1 month total RMS HOAs, 0.65 ± 0.20 and 0.54 ± 0.14, P = 0.001; 3 months coma, 0.50 ± 0.22 and 0.30 ± 0.17, P < 0.001; 3 months total RMS HOAs, 0.68 ± 0.20 and 0.55 ± 0.17, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION In this study, both SMILE and AF t-PRK were effective and comparable for correction of low to moderate myopic astigmatism. AF t-PRK group induced less coma and total HOAs than SMILE.","Zheng, Zhiyuan; Zhang, Mingzhi; Jhanji, Vishal; Sun, Lixia; Li, Jinyu; Zhang, Riping",International ophthalmology,197,1

A prospective feasibility study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of postoperative oral nutritional supplements. METHODS Stage I-III gastric cancer patients who underwent distal or total gastrectomy received oral administration of Racol® NF (Otsuka Pharmaceutical Factory, Japan), a liquid enteral nutritional formula, as a supplement to regular meals. Racol® NF administration at a recommended dosage of 400 kcal/400 ml per day was started within 7 days postoperatively and was continued for 3 months postoperatively. The primary end point was ratio of the weight loss at 3 months postoperatively to the preoperative body weight (body weight loss ratio). Secondary end points were the adherence to Racol® NF therapy and changes in body composition. RESULTS One hundred eighteen patients were registered before surgery, 82 of whom were eligible for efficacy analyses. The average rate of body weight loss after 3 months postoperatively was 8.3%. The mean daily intake of Racol® NF was 211 ml. There was a significant correlation between adherence to Racol® NF therapy and body weight loss ratio (P < 0.001). Adherence to Racol® NF therapy was the only factor that correlated with the body weight loss ratio among all clinical characteristics by the multiple linear regression analysis (P = 0.007). CONCLUSIONS Oral nutritional supplementation with Racol® NF led to a significant reduction in body weight loss for gastrectomized patients who tolerated more than 200 ml of the nutrient per day compared with those who could not tolerate this amount.","Kobayashi, Daisuke; Ishigure, Kiyoshi; Mochizuki, Yoshinari; Nakayama, Hiroshi; Sakai, Mitsuru; Ito, Seiji; Kojima, Hiroshi; Kajikawa, Masaki; Ando, Masahiko; Kodera, Yasuhiro",Gastric cancer : official journal of the International Gastric Cancer Association and the Japanese Gastric Cancer Association,197,17

Improving access to difficult-to-reach anatomic sites, e.g. in neurosurgery or percutaneous interventions, needs advanced maneuverable instrumentation. Advances in maneuverable technology require the development of dedicated methods enabling surgeons to stay in direct, manual control of these complex instruments. This article gives an overview of the state-of-the-art in the development of manual control methods for handheld maneuverable instruments. It categorizes the manual control methods in three levels: a) number of steerable segments, b) number of Degrees Of Freedom (DOF), and c) coupling between control motion of the handle and steering motion of the tip. The literature research was completed by using Web of Science, Scopus and PubMed. The study shows that in controlling single steerable segments, direct as well as indirect control methods have been developed, whereas in controlling multiple steerable segments, a gradual shift can be noticed from parallel and serial control to integrated control. The development of multi-segmented maneuverable instruments is still at an early stage, and an intuitive and effective method to control them has to become a primary focus in the domain of minimal access surgery.","Fan, Chunman; Dodou, Dimitra; Breedveld, Paul",Minimally invasive therapy & allied technologies : MITAT : official journal of the Society for Minimally Invasive Therapy,197,1

This document is a summary of a consensus guideline approved by 6 Spanish pediatric societies related to asthma and endorsed by the Spanish Pediatric Association. Asthma is easily identifiable by clinical criteria in most patients. Spirometry and other tests are helpful for diagnosis, especially in atypical cases. Asthma exacerbation is a frequent manifestation of the disease and must be identified and treated promptly. When asthma symptoms are frequent and the quality of life is affected, maintenance treatment must be instituted to achieve control of the disease. Low-dose inhaled corticosteroids are effective and safe for long-term use. Education of the patient with asthma is essential for good control. The main reason for poor asthma control is non-compliance with treatment, either due to its erratic and insufficient administration, or due to poor application technique of inhaled drugs. If control is not obtained despite adequate treatment, the diagnosis must be reconsidered, as well as the factors or comorbidities that make control difficult. Other drugs can be added to avoid high doses of inhaled corticosteroids, notably montelukast or long-acting β2 adrenergic agonists. Severe or difficult-to-control asthma, which does not respond to the usual treatments, should be managed in specialized units.","Moral, Luis; Asensi Monzó, Maite; Juliá Benito, Juan Carlos; Ortega Casanueva, Cristina; Paniagua Calzón, Natalia Marta; Pérez García, María Inmaculada; Rodríguez Fernández-Oliva, Carmen Rosa; Sanz Ortega, José; Valdesoiro Navarrete, Laura; Valverde-Molina, José",Anales de pediatria,197,26

We evaluated the effect of administering the P2Y12 antagonist prasugrel at the time of diagnosis versus administering it after the coronary angiography if percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was indicated. METHODS We enrolled 4033 patients with NSTE acute coronary syndromes and a positive troponin level who were scheduled to undergo coronary angiography within 2 to 48 hours after randomization. Patients were randomly assigned to receive prasugrel (a 30-mg loading dose) before the angiography (pretreatment group) or placebo (control group). When PCI was indicated, an additional 30 mg of prasugrel was given in the pretreatment group at the time of PCI and 60 mg of prasugrel was given in the control group. RESULTS The rate of the primary efficacy end point, a composite of death from cardiovascular causes, myocardial infarction, stroke, urgent revascularization, or glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor rescue therapy (glycoprotein IIb/IIIa bailout) through day 7, did not differ significantly between the two groups (hazard ratio with pretreatment, 1.02; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.84 to 1.25; P=0.81). The rate of the key safety end point of all Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) major bleeding episodes, whether related or not related to coronary-artery bypass grafting (CABG), through day 7 was increased with pretreatment (hazard ratio, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.19 to 3.02; P=0.006). The rates of TIMI major bleeding and life-threatening bleeding not related to CABG were increased by a factor of 3 and 6, respectively. Pretreatment did not reduce the rate of the primary outcome among patients undergoing PCI (69% of the patients) but increased the rate of TIMI major bleeding at 7 days. All the results were confirmed at 30 days and in prespecified subgroups. CONCLUSIONS Among patients with NSTE acute coronary syndromes who were scheduled to undergo catheterization, pretreatment with prasugrel did not reduce the rate of major ischemic events up to 30 days but increased the rate of major bleeding complications.

Visibility of pen marks is affected by surgical wash which increases the risk of wrong-site surgery. Additionally, multiple patient contact with a single pen is a potential source of bacterial transmission. In this study we compare pens commonly used for surgical marking in Australia. METHODS We conducted an unblinded, prospective cohort study comparing 12 marking pens. Six volunteers' thighs were marked with each pen. Standardized photographs were taken before and after wash with four prep solutions. Ink visibility was analysed using grayscale images, comparing the pen mark tone before and after wash. The pen tips were swabbed for culture. RESULTS Red tinted 2% chlorhexidine gluconate (w/v) with 70% isopropyl alcohol (v/v) was shown to reduce pen mark visibility significantly more than the other solutions used. The Pentel N50 permanent marker and Aspen WriteSite Plus were least affected by wash. No pen tip cultured any bacteria. CONCLUSIONS When marking the correct site for surgery, we recommend the use of either the Pentel N50 permanent marker or Aspen Writesite Plus pen. A 2-min interval between patient contact limits bacterial transmission.","O'Bryan, Edward; Pollock, Michaela; Joseph, Samuel",ANZ journal of surgery,197,7

However, the injury mechanism of H2S exposure to lung remains poorly understood. In this study, pig lung was selected as a H2S exposure model for the first time. We first examined the histological damage and the mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory genes of lung in pigs exposed to H2S. Histopathology change and increased mRNA level of pro-inflammatory cytokines demonstrated that H2S exposure indeed induced inflammatory injury in the porcine lung. We then performed TMT-based quantitative proteomics analysis to probe the injury molecular mechanism. The proteomics results showed that 526 proteins have significant changes in abundance between control and H2S treated swine. Further validation analysis of some H2S responsive proteins using both Real-time quantitative PCR and western blotting demonstrated that proteomics data are reliable. KEGG pathway analysis revealed that these proteins were involved in antigen processing and presentation, complement and coagulation cascade, IL-17 signaling pathway, ferroptosis and necroptosis. Our data suggest that H2S exposure induced immune suppression, inflammatory response and cell death. These findings provide a new insight into the complexity mechanisms of H2S induced lung injury, and offer therapeutic potential as drug targets with a view towards curing the intoxication caused by H2S.","Liu, Zhen; Fu, Qin; Tang, Shanlong; Xie, Yanjiao; Meng, Qingshi; Tang, Xiangfang; Zhang, Sheng; Zhang, Hongfu; Schroyen, Martine",Environmental research,197,16

This systematic review assesses current practice within preterm birth clinics globally. METHODS A comprehensive search strategy was used to identify all studies on preterm birth clinics on the MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CENTRAL and CINAHL databases. There were no restrictions to study design. Studies were limited to the English language and publications from 1998 onwards. Two reviewers assessed studies for inclusion, performed data extraction and reviewed methodological quality. Primary outcomes were referral criteria, investigations and interventions offered in preterm birth clinics. Secondary outcomes were the timing of planned first and last appointments and frequency of review. RESULTS Thirty-two records fulfilled eligibility criteria and 20 studies were included in the main analysis following grouping of records describing the same study or clinic. Studies were of mixed study design and methodological quality. A total of 39 clinics were described; outcome data was not available for all clinics. Referral criteria included previous spontaneous preterm birth (38/38, 100%), previous mid-trimester loss (34/38, 89%) and previous cervical surgery (33/38, 87%). All clinics offered transvaginal cervical length scans. Additional investigations varied, including urogenital swabs (16/28, 57%) and fetal fibronectin (8/28, 29%). The primary treatment of choice for a sonographic short cervix was cervical cerclage in 10/33 (30%) clinics and vaginal progesterone in 6/33 (18%), with 10/33 (30%) using multiple first-line options and 6/33 (18%) using a combination of treatments. The majority of clinics planned timing of first review for 12-16 weeks (30/35, 86%) and the frequency of review was usually determined by clinical findings (18/24, 75%). There was a wide variation in gestational age at clinic discharge between 24 and 37 weeks. CONCLUSIONS There is variation in the referral criteria, investigations and interventions offered in preterm birth clinics and in the timing and frequency of review.

METHODS The PLUS consists of 5 basic laparoscopic tasks. Three tasks were abstracted from the Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery program, and 2 additional tasks were developed under continuous evaluation by expert urologists. Fifty participants were recruited from different hospitals and performed the final PLUS training. They all completed a questionnaire after performance. Three outcome parameters were measured: performance quality, time, and dropped objects. The relationship between laparoscopic experience and the outcome parameters was investigated. RESULTS Of the 50 participants, 13 were students, 20 were residents, and 17 were urologists. Double-log linear regression analysis for all 5 tasks showed a significant effect (effect size range 0.53-0.82; P < .0005) for laparoscopic experience on performance time. Substantial correlations were found between experience and quality ratings (log-linear regression effect size 0.37; P = .012) and the number of dropped objects (Spearman correlation effect size 0.49; P < .01). The usefulness of the PLUS model as a training tool for basic laparoscopic skills was rated 4.55 on a scale from 1 (not useful) to 5 (useful) (standard deviation 0.58; range 3-5). CONCLUSION The results of the present study indicated the face, content, and construct validity for the PLUS. The training is considered appropriate for use as a primary training tool for an entry test or as part of a step-wise training program in which basic and procedural laparoscopic skills are integrated.","Tjiam, Irene M; Persoon, Marjolein C; Hendrikx, Ad J M; Muijtjens, Arno M M; Witjes, J Alfred; Scherpbier, Albert J J A",Urology,197,12

Training of healthcare providers to administer such contraceptives may improve uptake. We conducted a systematic review to collate the end-user uptake data following training of health care providers in low- and middle-income countries. MATERIAL AND METHODS We searched PubMed, Embase, the Global Health Library, and the Cochrane Library up to 23 May 2020. The review was restricted to low- and middle-income countries and focused on healthcare providers who had received training in LARC. Studies that reported contraceptive uptake among women, preference of LARC amongst health care workers and/or women, and unplanned pregnancies within 12 months of LARC initiation were included. All included studies underwent quality assessment using either the Cochrane's risk of bias tool or the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. PROSPERO registration number CRD42020185291. RESULTS A total of 28 studies (end-users n= 6.112.544) were included (27 cohort studies and one randomised trial). 19 studies were set in Africa, 5 in Asia, one in Central America and 4 were multi-country studies. 28 studies reported LARC use among women, and 25 studies found an increase in uptake of LARC either by women using short acting methods switching to longer acting methods or by recruiting new users of LARC. The randomised controlled trial was assessed as high quality and reported positive findings, however there was great heterogeneity in the type of intervention and of how outcomes were measured amongst the other included studies. Further, the quality of these studies varied, although it should be noted that the poor quality studies reflected the trends of those of higher quality. CONCLUSIONS Despite heterogeneity, current evidence indicates that training of healthcare providers in LARC may increase the uptake amongst women in low- and middle-income countries. More robust studies are warranted to inform policy.","Baekgaard, Rasmus Stokholm; Damhaugh, Eirik Gjaerevold; Mrema, Dorah; Rasch, Vibeke; Khan, Khalid Saeed; Linde, Ditte S",Acta obstetricia et gynecologica Scandinavica,197,24

Patients' fear regarding the pandemic would be the only reason to reduce surgeries, so Taiwan could be the most suitable place for research on the influence of psychological factors. This study aimed to assess the impact of patients' fear on orthopedic surgeries in Taiwan amid the peak period of the COVID-19 pandemic. PATIENTS AND METHODS The investigation period included the COVID-19 pandemic (March 2020 to April 2020) and the corresponding period in the previous year. The following data on patients with orthopedic diseases were collected: outpatient visits, hospital admission, and surgical modalities. RESULTS The COVID-19 pandemic led to a 22%-29% and 20%-26% reduction in outpatients, 22%-27% and 25%-37% reduction in admissions, and 26%-35% and 18%-34% reduction in surgeries, respectively, at both hospitals. The weekly mean number of patients was significantly smaller during the COVID-19 pandemic for all types of surgery and elective surgeries at the university hospital, and for all types of surgery, elective surgeries, and total knee arthroplasties at the community hospital. Further, patients visiting the community hospital during the pandemic were significantly younger, for all types of surgery, elective surgeries, and total knee arthroplasties. CONCLUSIONS The reduction in orthopedic surgeries in Taiwan's hospitals during COVID-19 could be attributed to patients' fear.

However, inhalation dosimetry data in remodeled airways are scarce due to the challenges in reconstructing diseased respiratory morphologies. This study aims to study the airway remodeling effects on the inhalation dosimetry of nasally inhaled nanoparticles in a nose-lung geometry that extends to G9 (ninth generation).Materials and methods: Statistical shape modeling was used to develop four diseased lung models with varying levels of bronchiolar dilation/constriction in the left-lower (LL) lobe (i.e. M1-M4). Respiratory airflow and particle deposition were simulated using a low Reynolds number k-ω turbulence model and a Lagrangian tracking approach.Results: Significant discrepancies were observed in the flow partitions between the left and right lungs, as well as between the lower and upper lobes of the left lung, which changed by 10-fold between the most dilated and constricted models.Much lower doses were predicted on the surface of the constricted LL bronchioles G4-G9, as well as into the peripheral airways beyond G9 of the LL lung. However, the LL lobar remodeling had little effect on the dosimetry in the nasopharynx, as well as on the total dosimetry in the nose-lung geometry (up to G9).Conclusion: It is suggested that airway remodeling may pose a higher viral infection risk to the host by redistributing the inhaled viruses to healthy lung lobes. Airway remodeling effects should also be considered in the treatment planning of inhalation therapies, not only because of the dosimetry variation from altered lung morphology but also its evolution as the disease progresses.","Si, Xiuhua April; Talaat, Mohamed; Su, Wei-Chung; Xi, Jinxiang",Inhalation toxicology,197,26

However, some infection complications after open heart procedures have been linked to the discharge fans of surgical equipment, most notably from the LivaNova 3T. We believe that surgical infection within the OR may also be due to other devices with internal fans. The purpose of this study was to 1) identify surgical equipment with an internal fan and see how they affect the airflow in an OR, 2) use the equipment to positively affect airflow to possibly reduce the risk of surgical site infections, and 3) bring attention to the HVAC system ability to exchange air throughout the OR. By using a fog machine and multiple camera angles, we identified the devices that have an effect on the airflow. We saw that the direction of the intake vent of specific devices can change the direction of airflow and possibly help to remove air. Last, we showed how the current HVAC air exchange rate might not be enough to remove contaminated air within the OR. Understanding intake and discharge vents for all equipment is important because sterile contamination and wound infection may be minimized or mitigated completely by simply repositioning a few devices.","Gisnarian, Carl J; Fusco, Daniel S; Arciszewski, Michael",The journal of extra-corporeal technology,197,17

The authors examined the early effect of hospital- and state-mandated restrictions on an orthopedic surgery department and hypothesized that the volume of ambulatory clinic encounters, office and surgical procedures, and cases would dramatically decrease. A retrospective review was performed of all encounters in an orthopedic surgery department at a level I academic trauma center during a 4-week period, from March 16, 2020, to April 12, 2020. The results were compared with two control 4-week periods, February 17, 2020, to March 15, 2020, and March 16, 2019, to April 12, 2019. Weekly volume and work relative value units (RVUs) of clinic encounters, office and surgical procedures, and cases were assessed. The type of ambulatory visit also was recorded. Comparisons of mean weekly volume and RVUs between the study and control periods were performed with Student's t test. Surgical cases were categorized into fracture or dislocation, acute soft tissue or nerve injury, infection, oncology, and elective or nonurgent. After implementation of hospital- and state-mandated restrictions on elective health care, the volume of ambulatory orthopedic surgery clinic encounters decreased by 74% to 77%, the volume of clinic procedures decreased by 95%, and the volume of surgical cases decreased by 88%. The percentage of clinic visits performed via telemedicine increased from 0.3% to 81.2%. Elective surgical cases ceased, and the volume of nonelective surgical cases decreased by 51%. During the first 4 weeks after COVID-19-related restrictions were imposed, an immediate and dramatic effect was observed. Compared with the control periods, significant reductions were seen in the volume of ambulatory encounters, office-based procedures, and surgical cases. In addition, the volume of nonelective surgical cases decreased by 51%.

The sample consisted of 19,931 individuals aged 15 or older who completed the European Health Interview Survey for Spain (EHSS-2014). Variables: prevalence and intensity of cigarette consumption. Multivariate ordered logistic regression analysis was performed with the following socioeconomic variables: social classes, educational attainment, main activity, economic situation and, for the working population, the activity sector. Other control variables were sociodemographic variables and healthy lifestyle habits (physical exercise, diet and alcohol consumption). The factors that relate to greater prevalence are: lower social class, not having university studies, being unemployed, having worse economic situation and working in hospitality industry. On the other hand, the variables related to higher intensity of cigarette consumption of the smoking population are: lower social class, not having university studies, and being neither a student nor on a permanent contract. Regarding control variables, those regressors associated with a higher prevalence and intensity of cigarette consumption are: being male, being aged between 36 and 65, being divorced, having fewer children at home and having worse lifestyle habits.","Martín Álvarez, Juan Manuel; Barrientos Marín, Jorge; Millán, José María",Adicciones,197,20

Health policies and systems need to be aligned with the values, principles and strategies of health promotion and investment made in strengthening essential health promotion functions. This paper considers how transformative health promotion can be advanced, by reflecting critically on what progress needs to be made and the structures and processes that are required to strengthen health promotion at a systems level. Progress in implementing health promotion is variable, and there is a general lack of investment in developing the necessary health promotion systems for substantive progress to be made. Key enablers and system requirements for comprehensive health promotion are examined, including the following critical elements: (i) effective advocacy for the concept and practice of health promotion; (ii) enabling policy structures for universal health promotion actions on a cross-sectoral basis; (iii) effective implementation systems, support mechanisms and workforce capacity for multisectoral health promotion action; (iv) investment in innovative research methods and knowledge translation to inform transformative health promotion approaches. In strengthening capacity to implement transformative health promotion actions, political will needs to be mobilized to ensure that dedicated and sustainable funding is made available, and the organizational and workforce capacity to deliver effective health promotion interventions is in place. The International Union for Health Promotion and Education (IUHPE) plays a central role in advancing transformative health promotion through mobilising and supporting its global members and partners in strengthening health promotion systems.","Barry, Margaret M",Global health promotion,197,5

Undirected graphs were constructed for the entire cortex in 17 FCD patients and 33 healthy controls using inter-regional similarity of [11C]ABP688 BPND. We assessed group differences in network integration between healthy controls and the ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres of FCD patients. Compared to healthy controls, FCD patients showed reduced network efficiency and reduced small-world connectivity. The mGluR5 network of FCD patients was also less resilient to targeted removal of high centrality nodes, suggesting a less integrated network organization. In highly efficient hub nodes of FCD patients, we observed a significant negative correlation between local efficiency and duration of epilepsy only in the contralateral hemisphere, suggesting that some nodes may be more vulnerable to persistent epileptic activity. Our study provides the first in vivo evidence for a widespread reduction in cortical mGluR5 network integration in FCD patients. In addition, we find that ongoing epileptic activity may alter chemoarchitectural brain organization resulting in reduced efficiency in distant regions that are essential for network integration.","DuBois, Jonathan M; Mathotaarachchi, Sulantha; Rousset, Olivier G; Sziklas, Viviane; Sepulcre, Jorge; Guiot, Marie-Christine; Hall, Jeffery A; Massarweh, Gassan; Soucy, Jean-Paul; Rosa-Neto, Pedro; Kobayashi, Eliane",NeuroImage.

Several studies support the involvement of TSH receptor autoantibodies (TRAbs) in the pathogenesis of GO, and a correlation between GO features and TRAbs has been reported, but not confirmed by all studies. Thus, we conducted a cross-sectional investigation to determine whether there is a correlation between TRAbs and the clinical features of GO in an initial phase of the eye disease. METHODS Ninety consecutive patients with untreated GO (67 women and 23 men, age 48.9 ± 12.6 years) were included. Patients who had received treatments other than anti-thyroid drugs for hyperthyroidism or lubricants for GO were excluded. All patients underwent an endocrinological and ophthalmological evaluation, the latter including exophthalmometry, measurement of eyelid width, clinical activity score (CAS), visual acuity, assessment of diplopia, and NOSPECS score. TRAb levels were measured by a third-generation competitive immunoassay. RESULTS There was a statistically significant, direct correlation between serum TRAb levels and CAS by linear regression analysis (R = 0.278, P = 0.007). The correlation was confirmed by a multiple regression analysis (R = 0.285; P = 0.006) including age and FT3 levels, which also correlated with CAS. There were no relationships between TRAbs and exophthalmometry, eyelid aperture, degree of diplopia, visual acuity, and NOSPECS score. CONCLUSIONS The levels of TRAb in subjects with a recent-onset, untreated GO are directly correlated with the clinical activity of the disease, confirming a possible role of these antibodies in the pathogenesis of GO.","Nicolì, F; Lanzolla, G; Mantuano, M; Ionni, I; Mazzi, B; Leo, M; Sframeli, A; Posarelli, C; Maglionico, M N; Figus, M; Nardi, M; Marcocci, C; Marinò, M",Journal of endocrinological investigation,197,17

Robotic gastrectomy, however, is adopted in only a few selected centers. The goals of this study were to examine the adoption of robotic gastrectomy and to compare outcomes between open and robotic gastric resections. This is a case-matched analysis of patients who underwent robotic and open gastric resection performed at Sanchinarro University Hospital, Madrid from November 2011 to February 2017. Patient data were obtained retrospectively. Clinicopathologic characteristics and perioperative and postoperative outcomes were recorded and analyzed. Two groups of demographically similar patients were analyzed: the robotic group (n = 20) and the open surgery group (n = 19). The patient characteristics of the two groups have been compared. Robotic resection resulted in less blood loss, shorter postoperative hospital stay, and a longer operating time. The two groups had similar complication rates. Pathological data were similar for both procedures. Robotic gastrectomy for locally advanced gastric carcinoma is safe, and long-term outcomes are comparable to those patients who underwent open resection. Robotic gastrectomy resulted in a shorter hospital stay, less blood loss and morbidity comparable with the outcomes of open gastrectomy.","Caruso, Riccardo; Vicente, Emilio; Quijano, Yolanda; Ielpo, Benedetto; Duran, Hipolito; Diaz, Eduardo; Fabra, Isabel; Ferri, Valentina",Updates in surgery,197,23

Immigrants and racialized communities including Chinese Canadians experience high level of access barriers including communication with clinicians. With the aim to facilitate mental health communications, we tested an Interactive Computer-assisted Client Assessment Survey (iCCAS) in Cantonese/Mandarin and English at a nurse practitioner-led primary care clinic in Toronto. The iCCAS offers a touch-screen, pre-consultation survey with questions on depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress, alcohol abuse, and social context. The program generates point-of-care reports for the clinician and patient. METHODS A pilot randomized controlled trial examined the intervention impact on mental health discussion and symptom detection, compared with the usual care, followed by clinicians' qualitative interviews. RESULTS Fifty self-identified Chinese adult patients participated (iCCAS = 26, Usual Care = 24), response rate 79.4%. Participant mean age was 44.8 years and 92% were immigrants. There was an increase of 19% and 15% in the mental health discussion and detection of symptoms in the iCCAS group compared with the usual care. More participants in the iCCAS group were referred to a social worker or psychiatrist. Patients found the use of iCCAS easy and clinicians identified its benefits for themselves (eg, early identification and comfort) and patients (eg, self-awareness and anonymity) and proposed practice-integration. DISCUSSION The studied tool holds promise for enhancing clinician-patient mental health communications in primary care settings for overseas Chinese. Implications are discussed for in-person and virtual healthcare which could also inform responses to mental health crisis related to COVID-19.","Ahmad, Farah; Wang, Jamie; Wong, Bonnie; Fung, Wai Lun Alan",Asia-Pacific psychiatry : official journal of the Pacific Rim College of Psychiatrists,197,1

Objective To determine whether a therapy that increases peripheral blood leukocyte and lymphocyte cell counts leads to clinical improvement in patients with COVID-19. Design, Setting and Participants Between February 18 and April 10, 2020, we conducted an open-label, multicenter, randomized clinical trial at 3 participating centers in China. The main eligibility criteria were pneumonia, a blood lymphocyte cell count of 800 per μL (to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 0.001) or lower, and no comorbidities. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection was confirmed with reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction testing. Exposures Usual care alone, or usual care plus 3 doses of recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF, 5 μg/kg, subcutaneously at days 0-2). Main Outcomes and Measures The primary end point was the time from randomization to improvement of at least 1 point on a 7-category disease severity score. Results Of 200 participants, 112 (56%) were men and the median (interquartile range [IQR]) age was 45 (40-55) years. There was random assignment of 100 patients (50%) to the rhG-CSF group and 100 (50%) to the usual care group. Time to clinical improvement was similar between groups (rhG-CSF group median of 12 days (IQR, 10-16 days) vs usual care group median of 13 days (IQR, 11-17 days); hazard ratio, 1.28; 95% CI, 0.95-1.71; P = .06). For secondary end points, the proportion of patients progressing to acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, or septic shock was lower in the rhG-CSF group (rhG-CSF group, 2% vs usual care group, 15%; difference, -13%; 95%CI, -21.4% to -5.4%). At 21 days, 2 patients (2%) had died in the rhG-CSF group compared with 10 patients (10%) in the usual care group (hazard ratio, 0.19; 95%CI, 0.04-0.88). At day 5, the lymphocyte cell count was higher in the rhG-CSF group (rhG-CSF group median of 1050/μL vs usual care group median of 620/μL; Hodges-Lehmann estimate of the difference in medians, 440; 95% CI, 380-490). Serious adverse events, such as sepsis or septic shock, respiratory failure, and acute respiratory distress syndrome, occurred in 29 patients (14.5%) in the rhG-CSF group and 42 patients (21%) in the usual care group. Conclusion and Relevance In preliminary findings from a randomized clinical trial, rhG-CSF treatment for patients with COVID-19 with lymphopenia but no comorbidities did not accelerate clinical improvement, but the number of patients developing critical illness or dying may have been reduced.

MATERIALS AND METHODS A prospective randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial conducted between July 2016 to February 2019. A total of 176 patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to one of the treatment sequences: Botox 100 U group (BTX-100; 62 patients), Botox 50 U group (BTX-50; 59 patients) or Placebo group (55 patients). All patients were followed-up for 6 months. RESULTS Significant improvement in all parameters i.e.; SHIM score & Erection Hardness Score (EHS), Sexual Encounter Profile (SEP), Global Assessment Score (GAS) and Doppler parameters (P < 0.001) was observed in patients of BTX-100 and BTX-50 groups with maximum improvement at 3rd month of treatment. Around 40% of patients were responders and abled to engage in sexual intercourse. Patients in placebo group didn't experience significant improvement (P = 0.264). It was noted that; at the 2nd week and 3rd months after treatment, there was no statistically significant difference in the improvement of these parameters in BTX-100 & BTX-50 groups (P >0.05). In the 6th month, there was a statistically significant difference between the aforementioned groups in favor of BTX-100 (P< 0.01).

Upregulated activity of RR plays an active role in tumor progression. As the regulatory subunit of RR, ribonucleotide reductase subunit M2 (RRM2) is regarded as one of the effective therapeutic targets for DNA replication-dependent diseases, such as cancers. Recent studies have revealed that osalmid significantly inhibits the activity of RRM2, but the metabolic profile of osalmid remains unknown. OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to clarify the metabolic profile including metabolites, isoenzymes and metabolic pathways of osalmid. The anti-human hepatocellular carcinoma activity and mechanism of metabolites were further investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS Ultra high-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC/Q-TOF-MS) was used for identifying metabolites and for characterizing phase I and phase II metabolic pathways with recombinant enzymes or in human liver microsomes of osalmid. The eHiTS docking system was used for potential RRM2 inhibitor screening among metabolites. Cytotoxicity assays were performed for evaluating cell proliferation inhibitory activity of metabolites. Cell cycle assays and cell apoptosis assays were assessed by flow cytometry. Western blotting analysis of RRM2, cyclin D1, p21, p53, phosphorylated p53, Bcl-2 and Bax was performed to explore the anti-hepatocellular carcinoma mechanism of the active metabolites. RESULTS Ten metabolites of osalmid were identified, and none of them have been reported previously. Hydroxylation, glucuronidation, sulfonation, acetylation and degradation were recognized as the main metabolic processes of osalmid. Isozymes of CYP1A2, CYP2C9, UGT1A1, UGT1A6, UGT1A9, UGT2B7 and UGT2B15 were involved in phase I and phase II metabolism of osalmid. Metabolites M7, M8 and M10 showed higher binding affinities with the RRM2 active site than osalmid. Metabolite M7 exhibited potent inhibitory activity to hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines by both competitive inhibition and down-regulation of RRM2. Moreover, M7 significantly induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis by activating p53-related pathways. CONCLUSIONS The metabolic profile of osalmid was identified. M7 significantly inhibited human hepatocellular carcinoma progression by inhibiting RRM2 activity. Furthermore, M7 induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis by activating p53-related signaling pathways.","Wu, Zhe; Zhan, Yaqiong; Wang, Li; Tong, Jiepeng; Zhang, Li; Lin, Mengjia; Jin, Xuehang; Jiang, Lushun; Lou, Yan; Qiu, Yunqing",Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,197,24

Near fatal asthma and COPD with sudden cardiac arrest can worsen the outcomes. Previous studies demonstrated that ECMO is a live-saving measure for near fatal asthma that does not respond to traditional treatment.Case study A patient with near fatal asthma (NFA) and COPD presented with high airway resistance, life-threatening acidemia and severe hypoxemia that failed to respond to conventional therapy. His hospital course was complicated by sudden cardiac arrest when preparing to initiate V-V mode extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). The mode immediately changed from V-V to V-A, then to V-AV and finally to V-V mode in order to improve cardiac function and promote recovery of lung function.Results On the sixth day, ECMO was removed and on the ninth day, he was extubated and transferred to the ward. Finally, the patient was discharged home on the nineteenth day after admission to be followed up in the pulmonary clinic.Conclusions The early application of ECMO and mode changing plausibly resulted in dramatic improvement in gas exchange and restoration of cardiac function. This case illustrates the critical role of ECMO mode changing as salvage therapy in NFA and COPD with sudden cardiac arrest.","Lang, Yuheng; Zheng, Yue; Hu, Xiaomin; Xu, Lei; Luo, Zhiqiang; Duan, Dawei; Wu, Peng; Huang, Lei; Gao, Wenqing; Ma, Qunxing; Ning, Meng; Li, Tong",The Journal of asthma : official journal of the Association for the Care of Asthma,197,12

PATIENTS AND METHODS We compared two independent cohorts of COVID-19 pneumonia (n=405) and H1N1 influenza pneumonia (n=78), retrospectively. All patients were confirmed by RT-PCR. Four hundred and five cases of COVID-19 pneumonia were confirmed in nine hospitals of Zhejiang province, China from January 21 to February 20, 2020. Seventy-eight cases of H1N1 influenza pneumonia were confirmed in our hospital from January 1, 2017 to February 29, 2020. Their clinical manifestations, laboratory test results, and CT imaging characteristics were compared. RESULTS COVID-19 pneumonia patients showed less proportions of underlying diseases, fever and respiratory symptoms than those of H1N1 pneumonia patients (p<0.01). White blood cell count, neutrophilic granulocyte percentage, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, D-Dimer, and lactate dehydrogenase in H1N1 pneumonia patients were higher than those of COVID-19 pneumonia patients (p<0.05). H1N1 pneumonia was often symmetrically located in the dorsal part of inferior lung lobes, while COVID-19 pneumonia was unusually showed as a peripheral but non-specific lobe distribution. Ground glass opacity was more common in COVID-19 pneumonia and consolidation lesions were more common in H1N1 pneumonia (p<0.01).

RESULTS The Worldwide Hospice Palliative Care Alliance initially launched WHPCD in 2005 as an annual unified day of action to celebrate and support hospice and palliative care around the world. The US-based innovative virtual conference featured 23 interprofessional hospice and palliative care specialists and patient and family caregiver speakers across nine diverse sessions addressing priorities at the intersection of COVID-19, social injustice, and the global burden of serious health-related suffering. Two primary aims guided the event: community building and wisdom sharing. Nearly 270 registrants from at least 16 countries and one dozen states across the US joined the free program focused on both personal and professional development. SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS Unlike many other academic conferences and professional gatherings that were relegated to online forums due to pandemic-related restrictions, the US WHPCD Celebration was intentionally established to create a virtual coming together for collective reflection on the barriers and facilitators of palliative care delivery amid vast societal change. The goal to ensure a globally relevant and culturally inclusive agenda will continue to draw increased participation at an international level during future annual events. Finally, the transparent and respectful sharing of palliative care team experiences in the year preceding the conference established a safe environment for both individual expression and scholarly discussion.","Rosa, William E; Pandey, Shila; Epstein, Andrew S; Connor, Stephen R; Nelson, Judith E",Palliative & supportive care,197,6

Unlike forward contact tracing, backward contact tracing identifies the source of newly detected cases. This approach is particularly valuable when there is high individual-level variation in the number of secondary transmissions (overdispersion). Methods: By using a simple branching process model, we explored the potential of combining backward contact tracing with more conventional forward contact tracing for control of COVID-19. We estimated the typical size of clusters that can be reached by backward tracing and simulated the incremental effectiveness of combining backward tracing with conventional forward tracing. Results: Across ranges of parameter values consistent with dynamics of SARS-CoV-2, backward tracing is expected to identify a primary case generating 3-10 times more infections than a randomly chosen case, typically increasing the proportion of subsequent cases averted by a factor of 2-3. The estimated number of cases averted by backward tracing became greater with a higher degree of overdispersion. Conclusion: Backward contact tracing can be an effective tool for outbreak control, especially in the presence of overdispersion as is observed with SARS-CoV-2.","Endo, Akira; Leclerc, Quentin J; Knight, Gwenan M; Medley, Graham F; Atkins, Katherine E; Funk, Sebastian; Kucharski, Adam J",Wellcome open research,197,13

METHODS The IHME projections from May to August 2020 for Brazil and selected states were compared with the ensuing reported number of cumulative deaths. RESULTS The pandemic was projected to cause 182,809 deaths by December 1, 2020 in Brazil. An increase in mask use could reduce the projected death toll by ~17,000. The mean error in the cumulative number of deaths at 2, 4 and 6 weeks after the projections were made was 13%, 18% and 22%, respectively. CONCLUSION Short and medium-term projections provide important and sufficiently accurate data to inform health managers, elected officials, and society at large. After following an arduous course up until August, the pandemic is projected to decline steadily although slowly, with ~400 deaths/day still occurring in early December.","Stein, Caroline; Cousin, Ewerton; Machado, Ísis Eloah; Felisbino-Mendes, Mariana Santos; Passos, Valéria Maria de Azeredo; Sousa, Tatiane Moraes de; Schmidt, Maria Inês; Gallagher, John; Naghavi, Mohsen; Duncan, Bruce B",Epidemiologia e servicos de saude : revista do Sistema Unico de Saude do Brasil,197,31

However, remaining limitations are the suboptimal stability of aneurysm occlusion and the treatment of complex IA. The use of conventional and flow diverter stents has partially addressed these limitations. Nevertheless, as intraluminal devices, stents require aggressive antiplatelet therapy and are associated with higher thromboembolic (TE) complication rates. Intrasaccular flow disrupters (IFD) are newly developed braided-wire devices designed to achieve flow disruption at the neck without placing material in the parent vessel and without the need of antiplatelet therapy.

In this study, we examined the link between resting rCBF in the PFC and current depressive symptoms in methadone-maintained opiate-dependent (MM) patients with or without major depression. METHODS Arterial spin labeled perfusion fMRI at 3 Tesla was used to measure resting rCBF in 21 MM patients. Perfusion data were analyzed using SPM2. The relationship between Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) score and resting rCBF was examined in a single regression analysis. RESULTS The BDI scores ranged between 0 and 18 (m=7.0, S.D.=4.8), and 30% of the sample had mild to moderate depression symptoms according to BDI scores. A negative correlation was observed between BDI scores and relative rCBF in the bilateral ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, and middle frontal gyri. CONCLUSIONS The inverse relationship between prefrontal paralimbic rCBF and depression scores suggests a link between reduced fronto-limbic activity and depressive symptoms in MM patients. A significant subgroup of opiate-dependent patients has clinical or sub-clinical depression that is often undetected; our data identify brain substrates of depression symptoms that may also be a potential marker of relapse in this population. Treatment strategies targeting these brain regions may improve outcomes in depressed substance abusers.","Suh, Jesse J; Langleben, Daniel D; Ehrman, Ronald N; Hakun, Jonathan G; Wang, Ze; Li, Yin; Busch, Samantha I; O'Brien, Charles P; Childress, Anna Rose",Drug and alcohol dependence,197,28

Scientific evaluations are necessary to ascertain the medicinal potential of ZA as a source of new drug molecules. This study investigated the possible therapeutic benefit of ZA leaf (ZAL) and root bark (ZARB) extracts in an experimental model of multi-organ injuries induced by phenylhydrazine (PHZ). Methods Hyperbilirubinaemia, hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity and splenic injuries were induced by pretreating albino rats with PHZ (40 mg/kg, p.o.) for two alternate days. Afterward, six out of the eight groups of rats (n = 5) used were treated with either ZAL or ZARB (30, 100 and 300 mg/kg/day, p.o.) for seven days. Naïve control rats received saline without PHZ whereas negative control group received saline after PHZ. After one week of treatment, rats were sacrificed and blood collected for assessment of haematological and biochemical parameters. Liver, kidney and spleen sections were processed for histology and examined under light microscope. Results Data indicate that PHZ significantly (p < 0.05) increased total bilirubin, serum alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine and BUN/creatinine ratio whereas red blood cell count was significantly reduced. These anomalies were significantly reversed in rats treated with ZAL or ZARB. The therapeutic effect of the extracts was supported by photomicrographs of the liver, kidney, and spleen of rats which revealed recovery from PHZ-mediated pyknosis, glomerular degeneration and multiple splenic necrosis respectively. Conclusions Overall, data from this study suggest that ZA may be useful in multiple organ injuries associated with PHZ-like xenobiotic toxicity.","Henneh, Isaac T; Owusu Agyei, Phyllis E; Obese, Ernest; Biney, Robert P; Antwi-Adjei, Meshack; Yahaya, Ewura S; Asiamah, Ernest; Acquah-Mills, Joseph; Boateng, Douglas O; Ekor, Martins",Journal of basic and clinical physiology and pharmacology,197,2

PURPOSE Our aim was to analyze outcomes after treatment of anterior communicating artery aneurysms with flow-diverter stents. DATA SOURCES A systematic search of 3 data bases was performed for studies published from 2008 to 2018. STUDY SELECTION According to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, we included studies reporting anterior communicating artery aneurysms treated with flow diversion. DATA ANALYSIS Random-effects meta-analysis was used to pool the following: aneurysm occlusion rate, complications, and factors influencing the studied outcomes. DATA SYNTHESIS We included 14 studies and 148 unruptured saccular anterior communicating artery aneurysms treated with flow diversion. The long-term complete/near-complete (O'Kelly-Marotta C-D) occlusion rate was 87.4% (91/105; 95% CI, 81.3%-93.6%; I2 = 0%) (mean radiologic follow-up of 11 months). The treatment-related complication rate was 8.6% (14/126; 95% CI, 4%-13.1%; I2 = 0%), with morbidity and mortality rates of 3.5% (5/126; 95% CI, 2%-7%; I2 = 0%) and 2.5% (2/148; 95% CI, 0.3%-5%; I2 = 0%), respectively. Most complications were periprocedural (12/126 = 7%; 95% CI, 3%-11%; I2 = 0%). Thromboembolic events were slightly higher compared with hemorrhagic complications (10/126 = 6%; 95% CI, 2%-10%; I2 = 0% and 4/126 = 3%; 95% CI, 1%-6%; I2 = 0%). Branching arteries (A2 or the recurrent artery of Heubner) covered by the stent were occluded in 16% (7/34; 95% CI, 3.5%-28%; I2 = 25%) of cases. Pre- and posttreatment low-dose and high-dose of antiplatelet therapy was not associated with significantly different complication and occlusion rates. LIMITATIONS We reviewed small and retrospective series. CONCLUSIONS Flow diversion for unruptured saccular anterior communicating artery aneurysms appears to be an effective alternative treatment for lesions difficult to treat with coiling or microsurgical clipping. The treatment-related complication rate was relatively low. However, larger studies are needed to confirm these results.","Cagnazzo, F; Limbucci, N; Nappini, S; Renieri, L; Rosi, A; Laiso, A; Tiziano di Carlo, D; Perrini, P; Mangiafico, S",AJNR.

Several immune cells, such as macrophages, dendritic cells, eosinophils, as well as T and B lymphocytes, synthetize and release cytokines involved in the inflammatory process. Gender differences in the incidence and severity of inflammatory lung ailments including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pulmonary fibrosis (PF), lung cancer (LC), and infectious related illnesses have been reported. Moreover, the effects of sex hormones on both androgens and estrogens, such as testosterone (TES) and 17β-estradiol (E2), driving characteristic inflammatory patterns in those lung inflammatory diseases have been investigated. In general, androgens seem to display anti-inflammatory actions, whereas estrogens produce pro-inflammatory effects. For instance, androgens regulate negatively inflammation in asthma by targeting type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) and T-helper (Th)-2 cells to attenuate interleukin (IL)-17A-mediated responses and leukotriene (LT) biosynthesis pathway. Estrogens may promote neutrophilic inflammation in subjects with asthma and COPD. Moreover, the activation of estrogen receptors might induce tumorigenesis. In this chapter, we summarize the most recent advances in the functional roles and associated signaling pathways of inflammatory cellular responses in asthma, COPD, PF, LC, and newly occurring COVID-19 disease. We also meticulously deliberate the influence of sex steroids on the development and progress of these common and severe lung diseases.","Reyes-García, Jorge; Montaño, Luis M; Carbajal-García, Abril; Wang, Yong-Xiao",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,197,1

The aim of the present study was to identify the predictors of postoperative mortality after emergent open colectomy for IC treatment. Additionally, we compared postoperative outcomes of patients undergoing emergent colectomy due to aortic surgery-related IC (AS-IC group) vs. other IC etiologies (Other-IC group). METHODS We analyzed records of consecutive patients who underwent emergency open colectomy for IC between 2008 and 2019. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify clinical and operative parameters associated with postoperative mortality. The AS-IC and Other-IC groups were compared for mortality, morbidity, ICU stay, hospital stay, and survival. RESULTS During the study period, 94 patients (mean age, 67.4 ± 13.7 years) underwent emergent open colectomy for IC. In the majority of cases, IC involved the entire colon (53.2%) and vasopressor agents were required preoperatively (63.8%) and/or intraoperatively (78.8%). Thirty-four patients underwent surgery due to AS-IC, whereas 60 due to Other-IC causes. In the AS-IC group, 9 patients had undergone endovascular aortic repair and 25 open aortic surgery; 61.8% of patients needed aortic surgery for ruptured abdominal aortic aneurism (AAA). Overall, 66 patients (70.2%) died within 90 days from surgery. The AS-IC and Other-IC groups showed similar operative outcomes and postoperative complication rates. However, the duration of the ICU stay (19 days vs. 11 days; p = 0.003) and of the total hospital stay (22 days vs. 16 days; p = 0.016) was significantly longer for the AS-IC group than for the Other-IC group. The rate of intestinal continuity restoration at 1 year after surgery was higher for the Other-IC group than for the AS-IC group (58.8% vs. 22.2%; p = 0.05). In the multivariate model, preoperative increased lactate levels, a delay between signs/symptoms' onset and surgery > 12 h, and the occurrence of postoperative acute kidney injury were statistically associated with postoperative mortality. Neither IC etiology (aortic surgery vs. other etiology) nor ruptured AAA was associated with postoperative mortality. CONCLUSION Emergency open colectomy for IC is associated with high postoperative mortality, which appears to be unrelated to the IC etiology. Preoperative lactate levels, > 12-h delay to surgery, and postoperative acute kidney injury are independent predictors of postoperative mortality.","Beghdadi, Nassiba; Reitano, Elisa; Cochennec, Frederic; Desgranges, Pascal; Amiot, Aurelien; Sobhani, Iradj; Mongardon, Nicolas; Langeron, Olivier; Notarnicola, Margherita; Mulé, Sébastien; Luciani, Alain; Canoui-Poitrine, Florence; Laurent, Alexis; Sommacale, Daniele; Brunetti, Francesco; De' Angelis, Nicola",World journal of emergency surgery : WJES,197,1

Early reports have confirmed that transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) and angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) are critical targets of SARS-CoV-2 that facilitate viral entry into host cells. TMPRSS2 and ACE2 are expressed in multiple human tissues beyond the lung including the testes where predisposition to SARS-CoV-2 infection may exist. TMPRSS2 is an androgen responsive gene and its fusion represents one of the most frequent alterations in prostate cancer. Androgen suppression by androgen deprivation therapy and androgen receptor signaling inhibitors form the foundation of prostate cancer treatment. In this review, we highlight the growing evidence in support of androgen regulation of TMPRSS2 and ACE2 and the potential clinical implications of using androgen suppression to downregulate TMPRSS2 to target SARS-CoV-2. We also discuss the future directions and controversies that need to be addressed in order to establish the viability of targeting TMPRSS2 and/or ACE2 through androgen signaling regulation for COVID-19 treatment, particularly its relevance in the context of prostate cancer management.","Bhowmick, Neil A; Oft, Jillian; Dorff, Tanya; Pal, Sumanta; Agarwal, Neeraj; Figlin, Robert A; Posadas, Edwin M; Freedland, Steven; Gong, Jun",Endocrine-related cancer,197,17

METHOD Six databases were searched to identify measures used to assess participation in health, psychology, and education research. Included studies involved children aged 0 to 18 years with a permanent impairment or developmental disability and reported use of a quantitative measure of participation. A second search sought relevant literature about each identified measure (including published manuals) to allow a comprehensive understanding of the measure. Measurement constructs of frequently reported measures were then mapped to the fPRC. RESULTS From an initial yield of 32 767 articles, 578 reported one or more of 118 participation measures. Of these, 51 measures were reported in more than one article (our criterion) and were therefore eligible for mapping to the fPRC. Twenty-one measures quantified aspects of participation attendance, 10 quantified aspects of involvement as discrete scales, and four quantified attendance and involvement in a manner that could not be separated. INTERPRETATION Improved understanding of participation and its related constructs is developing rapidly; thoughtful selection of measures in research is critical to further our knowledge base. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS The fPRC can support our rapidly evolving and expanding understanding of participation. Instruments selected to measure participation do not always align with emerging concepts. Matching research aims to a chosen measure's content will improve understanding of participation.

In this study, we used data from 24,867 UK Biobank participants to investigate risk factors related to loneliness and estimated brain age based on neuroimaging data. The results showed that on average, individuals who self-reported loneliness on a single yes/no item scored higher on neuroticism, depression, social isolation, and socioeconomic deprivation, performed less physical activity, and had higher BMI compared to individuals who did not report loneliness. In line with studies pointing to a genetic overlap of loneliness with neuroticism and depression, permutation feature importance ranked these factors as the most important for classifying lonely versus not lonely individuals (ROC AUC = 0.83). While strongly linked to loneliness, neuroticism and depression were not associated with brain age estimates. Conversely, objective social isolation showed a main effect on brain age, and individuals reporting both loneliness and social isolation showed higher brain age relative to controls - as part of a prominent risk profile with elevated scores on socioeconomic deprivation and unhealthy lifestyle behaviours, in addition to neuroticism and depression. This finding may indicate that the combination of social isolation and a genetic predisposition for loneliness involves a risk for adverse brain health. Importantly, the results underline the complexity in associations between loneliness and adverse health outcomes, where observed risks likely depend on a combination of interlinked variables including genetic as well as social, behavioural, physical, and socioeconomic factors.","de Lange, Ann-Marie G; Kaufmann, Tobias; Quintana, Daniel S; Winterton, Adriano; Andreassen, Ole A; Westlye, Lars T; Ebmeier, Klaus P",Behavioural brain research,197,24

However, a comprehensive evaluation of cohorting as a prevention approach is lacking. METHODS We performed a systematic review of studies that used cohorting as part of an infection control strategy to reduce hospital-acquired infections. We included studies published between 1966 and November 30, 2019, on adult populations hospitalized in acute-care hospitals. RESULTS In total, 87 studies met inclusion criteria. Study types were quasi-experimental ""before and after"" (n = 35), retrospective (n = 49), and prospective (n = 3). Case-control analysis was performed in 7 studies. Cohorting was performed with other infection control strategies in the setting of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA, n = 22), Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI, n = 6), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE, n = 17), carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae infections (CRE, n = 22), A. baumannii (n = 15), and other gram-negative infections (n = 5). Cohorting was performed either simultaneously (56 of 87, 64.4%) or in phases (31 of 87, 35.6%) to help contain transmission. In 60 studies, both patients and staff were cohorted. Most studies (77 of 87, 88.5%) showed a decline in infection or colonization rates after a multifaceted approach that included cohorting as part of the intervention bundle. Hand hygiene compliance improved in approximately half of the studies (8 of 15) during the respective intervention. CONCLUSION Cohorting of staff, patients, or both is a frequently used and reasonable component of an enhanced infection control strategy. However, determining the effectiveness of cohorting as a strategy to reduce transmission of MDRO and C. difficile infections is difficult, particularly in endemic situations.","Abad, Cybele L; Barker, Anna K; Safdar, Nasia",Infection control and hospital epidemiology,197,31

SARS-CoV-2 RNA presence in human faecal samples and SARS-CoV-2 activity in faeces from COVID-19 patients have been observed. Methods Starting from these observations, an experimental design was developed to cultivate in vitro faecal microbiota from infected individuals, to monitor the presence of SARS-CoV-2, and to collect data on the relationship between faecal bacteria and the virus. Results Our results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 replicates in vitro in bacterial growth medium, that the viral replication follows bacterial growth and it is influenced by the administration of specific antibiotics. SARS-CoV-2-related peptides have been detected in 30-day bacterial cultures and characterised. Discussion Our observations are compatible with a 'bacteriophage-like' behaviour of SARS-CoV-2, which, to our knowledge has not been observed or described before. These results are unexpected and hint towards a novel hypothesis on the biology of SARS-CoV-2 and on the COVID-19 epidemiology. The discovery of possible new modes of action of SARS-CoV-2 has far-reaching implications for the prevention and the treatment of the disease.","Petrillo, Mauro; Brogna, Carlo; Cristoni, Simone; Querci, Maddalena; Piazza, Ornella; Van den Eede, Guy",F1000Research,197,10

Despite continuous reports of clinical trials being launched, no studies have yet systematically summarized and analysed their characteristics. Our objective is to do this by reviewing trials registered at ClinicalTrials.gov. METHODS We searched the ClinicalTrials.gov database and retrieved all clinical trials on COVID-19 registered up to and including 3 April 2020. We summarized the characteristics of the trials, presenting the results of all trials, all intervention trials and drug intervention (including vaccines and traditional Chinese medicine) trials. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION We identified 306 COVID-19-related clinical trials. Seven of the studies had been withdrawn, leaving 299 active trials. Of the trials, 28.8% were planned to be conducted in Asia, 26.8% in Europe and 18.7% in North America. Most (73.0%) proposed trials expected to recruit fewer than 500 people, and only 22.1% of the studies included children (aged <18 years). About two-thirds (67.2%) of the studies were funded by the own resources of medical or research institutions. Of intervention trials, 73.9% used random allocation, and 73.4% used parallel assignment. Only 36.7% of the intervention trials used blinding. In terms of drug trials, 147 trials were drug intervention studies, covering 80 conventional drugs and seven traditional Chinese medicine drugs. Antiviral drugs and antimalarial drugs were the most commonly studied drugs with 52 and 45 trials registered, respectively. Five registered clinical trials were on vaccines. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION A large number of COVID-19-related trials have been registered within the first 4 months since the first infection was reported.

Therapeutic targets have not been well characterized for auto-inflammatory syndromes, although the E3 ligase Synoviolin was previously shown to be a novel therapeutic target for RA. Here, we show that Synoviolin loss has little impact on a model of auto-inflammatory diseases. We previously established such a model, the hIL-1 cTg mouse, in which IL-1 signaling was constitutively activated, and animals exhibit symptoms recapitulating auto-inflammatory syndromes such as major joint dominant arthritis. Here, we crossed hIL-1 cTg with Synoviolin flox'd mice to yield hIL-1 cTg/Synoviolin cKO mice. Synoviolin gene expression was ablated in adult hIL-1 cTg/Synoviolin cKO mice by injection of pIpC to activate Mx1 promoter-driven Cre recombinase. However, symptoms seen in hIL-1 cTg mice such as arthritis and joint destruction were not alleviated by targeting Synoviolin, ruling out Synoviolin as a therapeutic target for auto-inflammatory disease. Our results indicate that although similar, RA and auto-inflammatory diseases are different diseases, and treatment strategies should differ accordingly.","Matsumoto, Tatsuaki; Sato, Yuiko; Kobayashi, Tami; Ito, Eri; Soma, Tomoya; Kimura, Atsushi; Miyamoto, Kana; Kobayashi, Shu; Harato, Kengo; Matsumoto, Morio; Nakamura, Masaya; Niki, Yasuo; Miyamoto, Takeshi",Biochemical and biophysical research communications,197,4

The accuracy of this tool when including only self-report measures is yet to be determined. Objectives To validate the 3-step prediction tool using only self-report measures (3-step self-reported prediction tool), and to externally validate the 3-step clinical prediction tool. Methods The clinical tool was used with 137 individuals with PD. Participants also answered a question about self-reported gait speed, enabling scoring of the self-reported tool, and were followed-up for 6 months. An intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC2,1) was calculated to evaluate test-retest reliability of the 3-step self-reported prediction tool. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to evaluate the performance of both tools and their discriminative ability was determined using the area under the curve (AUC). Results Forty-two participants (31%) reported ≥1 fall during follow-up. The 3-step self-reported tool had an ICC2,1 of 0.991 (95% CI 0.971-0.997; P < 0.001) and AUC = 0.68; 95% CI 0.59-0.77, while the 3-step clinical tool had an AUC = 0.69; 95% CI 0.60-0.78. Conclusions The 3-step self-reported prediction tool showed excellent test-retest reliability and was validated with acceptable accuracy in predicting falls in the next 6 months. The 3-step clinical prediction tool was externally validated with similar accuracy. The 3-step self-reported prediction tool may be useful to identify people with PD at risk of falls in e/tele-health settings.","Almeida, Lorena Rosa S; Piemonte, Maria Elisa Pimentel; Cavalcanti, Helen M; Canning, Colleen G; Paul, Serene S",Movement disorders clinical practice,197,1

Therefore, we assessed motor abilities (using the M-ABC-2) and visual spatial cognitive skills (using the Block Design subtest of the WPPSI-III and a picture mental rotation task, PRT) of 5-7 year old typically developing children (n= 17) and same-aged children with severe deficits in stereopsis due to infantile esotropia (n= 17). Compared to the typically developing children, children with esotropia showed significantly poorer motor performances, especially in manual dexterity and ball skills, and significantly poorer and slower performance on the visual spatial cognitive tasks. Especially the girls treated for infantile esotropia needed more time to mentally rotate the pictures of the PRT correctly. Overall, this study showed that perceptual, motor and cognitive processes are interconnected and that children treated for infantile esotropia had an increased risk of motor and visual spatial cognitive deficits.","Dillmann, Julia; Freitag, Claudia; Lorenz, Birgit; Holve, Kerstin; Schweinfurth, Silke; Schwarzer, Gudrun",Perceptual and motor skills,197,5

We investigated adhesion of S. ovinae to the hymenopteran host abdomen (Andrena vaga), a strongly hairy abdomen of a Bombus sp. and two artificial smooth reference surfaces having different degree of hydrophilicity. In our experiments, the males of S. ovinae developed significantly higher forces on smooth surfaces. However, the forces were significantly lower on all the hymenopteran surfaces used in the experiment. The absence of anisotropy in the force grip in cranial/caudal direction relative to the host might indirectly indicate that S. ovinae generate forces rather by adhesion and not by mechanical interlocking with the host hairs. The tolerance of the attachment system of S. ovinae to the substrate chemistry might be explained by the primary contribution of van der Waals interactions and not capillary forces to adhesion in S. ovinae.","Pohl, Hans; Gorb, Elena V; Gorb, Stanislav N",The Journal of experimental biology,197,26

Nevertheless, this type of study may impose significant risk without potential benefit for those in the sham group. The aim of the current study was to systematically review and analyze the endoscopic literature to assess the safety of sham controls. METHODS MEDLINE and Embase databases were searched for endoscopic sham procedures for all dates to July 2017. Only randomized controlled trials comparing an endoscopic therapy with a sham were included. Primary outcome was adverse events (AEs) categorized as mild, moderate, or severe. Results were combined using a random-effects model. Heterogeneity was assessed with the I2 statistic, and publication bias was assessed with the Egger test and funnel plots. RESULTS Data were extracted from 34 publications (1987-2017; 100% full text), with a total of 2492 procedures (1355 treatment/1137 sham). Sham procedures involved upper endoscopy (31 studies) and ERCP (3 studies). Treatment arms included procedures with the following indications: weight loss (38.2%), GI bleeding (26.5%), GERD (20.6%), sphincter of Oddi dysfunction (8.8%), and dysphagia (6.2%). Overall percentage of severe adverse events (SAEs) in the sham group was 1.7% (19/1137). Of these, the most common SAEs in the sham groups were need for surgery/intensive care unit stay (35.3%), post-ERCP pancreatitis (23.5%), and perforation (11.8%). There was no significant difference in the odds of developing an SAE between the treatment group and the sham group (odds ratio, 1.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.7-2.3). The pooled additional risk incurred from being initially randomized to the sham arm and then receiving a cross-over intervention was significant (RR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.14-1.56; P < .001), compared with patients initially randomized to the study intervention. CONCLUSION The frequency of AEs in endoscopic sham procedures is substantial, and patients are subjected to considerable morbidity. These results raise a serious ethical dilemma regarding the use of sham-controlled trials.","Schulman, Allison R; Popov, Violeta; Thompson, Christopher C",Gastrointestinal endoscopy,197,24

We supposed that MDSCs also contributed to the impaired antitumor immunity in MDS. Here we demonstrated that STAT3-ARG1 pathway could be a critical signal transduction pathway that regulated MDSCs-mediated immunosuppression. Increased MDSCs was revealed in MDS patients when compared to healthy controls. Especially, MDSCs performed higher activated STAT3 and CCR2 expression in high-risk MDS patients. The CCL2 and IL-6 levels in MDS patients were also higher than in healthy controls, which could drive recruitment and activation of MDSCs. Meanwhile, lower expression levels of CD3ζ chain, perforin and granzyme B were demonstrated in MDS patients, which were associated with downregulated activation of CD8+ T lymphocytes. The results were supported by the decreased perforin, granzyme B and IFN-γ levels in the mixed-culture system of MDSCs and CD8+ T lymphocytes in vitro. Notably, targeting STAT3 pathway by selective inhibitor could decrease ARG1 expression in MDSCs and partially reverse the lower expression levels of effector molecules on CD8+ T lymphocytes. Therefore, this study revealed the potential STAT3-ARG1 mechanism behind MDSCs and provided a promising STAT3 targeting strategy in MDS.","Qi, Xiao; Jiang, Huijuan; Liu, Pei; Xie, Ning; Fu, Rong; Wang, Huaquan; Liu, Chunyan; Zhang, Tian; Wang, Huaqing; Shao, Zonghong",Leukemia & lymphoma,197,17

In order to mimic the penetration of this type of molecules, based upon previously reported structure activity relationship studies, we designed a new molecule containing a quinazoline moiety tethered to a p-nitrobenzoxadiazole (NBD) moiety [molecular weight (MW) 700]. Despite its size, AL906 growth inhibitory activity was superior to that of the clinical drug gefitinib. Furthermore, AL906 retained significant EGFR inhibitory activity and good cellular penetration with abundant distribution in the perinuclear region of the cells. In an isogenic NIH3T3 transfected cell panel, it selectively inhibited the growth of the NIH3T3-EGFR and HER2 transfectants. Confocal microscopy analysis revealed that it was capable of penetrating multilayer aggregates although to a lesser extent than FD105, a small inhibitor of EGFR inhibitor of the same class (MW 300). Its ability to inhibit EGFR auto-phosphorylation in monolayer culture was stronger than in the aggregates. The results suggest that our strategy did not negatively affect EGFR inhibitory potency, EGFR selectivity and growth inhibition. However, its molecular size may account for its decreased aggregate penetration when compared with a smaller EGFR inhibitor of the quinazoline class.","Golabi, Nahid; Larroque, Anne-Laure; Peyrard, Lisa; Williams, Christopher; Jean-Claude, Bertrand J",Investigational new drugs,197,27

We treated our first COVID-19 pregnant patient on April 4th, 2020 reaching a total of 193 pregnant women, with PCR-positive SARS-CoV-2 by 8th March 2021. Several studies from Israel have evaluated pregnancy-related outcomes of COVID-19, be it maternal, obstetrical or neonatal complications. We suggest that only in a small subset of severely ill mothers, intubated and otherwise respiratory or hemodynamically unstable, an emergency cesarean delivery should be considered, factoring gestational age, in order to assist maternal ventilation and circulation, as well as to avoid possible secondary fetal compromise due the maternal deterioration.In addition, there is conflicting evidence as to the price of lockdown on obstetrical outcomes, i.e., not the direct medical impact of the virus, but rather the impact of the measures to contain its spread - mainly lockdowns, which has been a major tool in Israel to combat COVID-19.Finally, we demonstrate to overall safety and efficacy of vaccination pregnant women and the beneficial impact on pregnancy outcome and neonatal gain of protecting antibodies.Conclusion: The data emerging from Israel is overall reassuring, as for the association of COVID-19 with adverse pregnancy outcome and the possible protective effect of the vaccinations.

At present, the traditional methods for identifying genetically modified and non-transgenic soybeans are time-consuming, costly, and complicated to operate, which cannot meet the needs of practical applications. Therefore, it is necessary to discover a fast and accurate method for identifying transgenic soybeans. Terahertz (THz) time domain spectra were collected in sequence from 225 transgenic and non-transgenic soybean samples. Fourier transform was used to convert the terahertz time domain spectrum into a THz frequency domain spectrum with a frequency range of 0.1-2.5 THz. Firstly, the interval partial least squares (iPLS) method was used to remove interference spectral bands and select appropriate spectral intervals. Secondly, 168 samples were selected as the calibration set. Discriminant partial least squares (DPLS), Grid Search support vector machine (Grid Search-SVM) and principal component analysis back propagation neural network (PCA-BPNN) were used to establish a qualitative identification model. Afterwards, 57 test set samples were predicted. By comparing the experimental results, it was found that iPLS could effectively screen and remove the interference THz band, which was more helpful to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the identification model. After the iPLS and mean center pre-treatment technology, the Grid Search-SVM identification model had the best identification effect, with a total accuracy rate of 98.25% (transgenic identification rate was 96.15%, non-transgenic identification rate was 100%). This study shows that after selecting spectra from iPLS, THz spectroscopy combined with chemometrics can more accurately, quickly, and efficiently identify transgenic and non-transgenic soybeans.","Wei, Xiao; Zheng, Wanqin; Zhu, Shiping; Zhou, Shengling; Wu, Weiji; Xie, Zhiyong","Spectrochimica acta.

We compared the work of breathing (WOB) of NPPV using a helmet or a full face-mask with that of invasive ventilation by tracheal intubation. METHODS We used a lung model capable of simulating spontaneous breathing (LUNGOO; Air Water Inc., Japan). LUNGOO was set at compliance (C) = 50 mL/cmH2O and resistance (R) = 5 cmH2O/L/s for normal lung simulation, C = 20 mL/cmH2O and R = 5 cmH2O/L/s for restrictive lung, and C = 50 mL/cmH2O and R = 20 cmH2O/L/s for obstructive lung. Muscle pressure was fixed at 25 cmH2O and respiratory rate at 20 bpm. Pressure support ventilation and continuous positive airway pressure were performed with each interface placed on a dummy head made of reinforced plastic that was connected to LUNGOO. We tested the inspiratory WOB difference between the interfaces with various combinations of ventilator settings (positive end-expiratory pressure 5 cmH2O; pressure support 0, 5, and 10 cmH2O). RESULTS In the normal lung and restrictive lung models, WOB decreased more with the face-mask than the helmet, especially when accompanied by the level of pressure support. In the obstructive lung model, WOB with the helmet decreased compared with the other two interfaces. In the mixed lung model, there were no significant differences in WOB between the three interfaces. CONCLUSION NPPV using a helmet is more effective than the other interfaces for WOB in obstructive lung disease.","Oda, Shinya; Otaki, Kei; Yashima, Nozomi; Kurota, Misato; Matsushita, Sachiko; Kumasaka, Airi; Kurihara, Hutaba; Kawamae, Kaneyuki",Journal of anesthesia,197,1

METHODS This retrospective study included 6 winter respiratory viral seasons (2001-2007) in Intermountain Healthcare, an integrated health system in the Intermountain West, including Primary Children's Medical Center in Salt Lake City, Utah. Children <18 years of age who were hospitalized with either invasive pneumococcal disease in any Intermountain Healthcare facility or culture-confirmed invasive pneumococcal disease at Primary Children's Medical Center were included. We analyzed the correlation between invasive pneumococcal disease and circulating respiratory viruses. RESULTS A total of 435 children with invasive pneumococcal disease and 203 with culture-confirmed invasive pneumococcal disease were hospitalized in an Intermountain Healthcare facility or Primary Children's Medical Center during the study period. During the same period, 6963 children with respiratory syncytial virus, 1860 with influenza virus, 1459 with parainfluenza virus, and 818 with adenoviruses were evaluated at Primary Children's Medical Center. A total of 253 children with human metapneumovirus were identified during the last 5 months of the study. There were correlations between invasive pneumococcal disease and seasonal respiratory syncytial virus, influenza virus, and human metapneumovirus activity. The correlation with invasive pneumococcal disease was strong up to 4 weeks after respiratory syncytial virus activity. For influenza virus and human metapneumovirus, the correlations were strong at 2 weeks after activity of these viruses. Pneumonia was the most common clinical disease associated with culture-confirmed invasive pneumococcal disease, mostly attributable to serotypes 1, 19A, 3, and 7F.

The trans-Golgi network (TGN) is the main subcellular compartment where HA cleavage occurs during its biosynthesis. The proteolytic HA cleavage is an indispensable prerequisite for the fusion of viral with endosomal membrane and the delivery of the virus genome into the cell. Both, the structure and accessibility of the HA cleavage site determine the responsible host protease(s) for cutting. Most influenza virus strains contain a HA sequence with a single arginine at the cleavage site suitable for processing by the trypsin-like serine proteases human airway trypsin-like protease (HAT) and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), albeit a minority of viruses possesses HA cleavage site motifs that are processed by other proteases. TMPRSS2-deficient mice demonstrated the relevance of TMPRSS2 for pneumotropism and pathogenicity of H1N1 and H7N9 virus infections. In contrast, H3N2 virus infections are promoted by an additional not yet identified protease. Highly pathogenic avian H5 and H7 viruses are characterized by an enlarged cleavage site loop containing a multibasic amino acid motif, where the eukaryotic subtilases furin or PC5/6 cleave. Their ubiquitous presence in the organism allows a systemic virus infection. Peptidomimetic inhibitors derived from the HA cleavage site inhibit the HA-activating proteases and thus virus propagation.","Garten, Wolfgang; Braden, Carolin; Arendt, Annika; Peitsch, Catharina; Baron, Joanna; Lu, Yinghui; Pawletko, Kerstin; Hardes, Kornelia; Steinmetzer, Torsten; Böttcher-Friebertshäuser, Eva",European journal of cell biology,197,9

Most patients undergoing CEA for carotid artery stenosis have concomitant heart diseases, leading to hemodynamic instability that can cause postoperative cardiac complications such as cardiac heart failure. LV diastolic function has recently been recognized as an independent predictor of adverse cardiac events in patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery. We analyzed clinical data from the anesthetic and medical records of 149 consecutive patients who underwent CEA at our university hospital between March 2012 and March 2018. LV systolic and diastolic function were evaluated by ejection fraction and the ratio of LV early diastolic filling velocity to the peak velocity of mitral medial annulus (E/e'). Postoperative PE was diagnosed based on chest X-ray and arterial gas analysis by two independent physicians. Postoperative PE was developed in four patients (2.8%). Patients with postoperative PE were not related to preoperative low ventricular ejection fraction, but had a significantly higher E/e' ratio than those without PE (P = 0.01). Furthermore, there was an increasing trend of PE according to the E/e' category. Preoperative LV diastolic function evaluated by E/e' was associated with the development of postoperative PE in patients who underwent CEA. The results suggest that the evaluation of LV diastolic dysfunction could be possibly useful to predict PE in patients undergoing CEA.","Shigematsu, Kenji; Iwashita, Kouhei; Mimata, Ryosuke; Owaki, Ryoko; Totoki, Takaaki; Gohara, Akira; Okawa, Jingo; Higashi, Midoriko; Yamaura, Ken",Neurologia medico-chirurgica,197,1

In the second example, we demonstrate that the QCD axion can have its number abundance enhanced allowing for misalignment driven axion dark matter all the way down to f_{a} of order astrophysical bounds. In the third example, we show that the delayed oscillation of the scalar field can also sustain a period of inflation. In the last example, we present a situation where an oscillating scalar field is completely frictionless and does not dilute away in time.","Hook, Anson; Marques-Tavares, Gustavo; Tsai, Yuhsin",Physical review letters,197,17

These levels were then compared with the level of everyday sounds and to accepted intensities by Safety Administrations to see whether the mandatory use of hearing protection should be recommended to prevent noise-induced hearing loss. METHODS We assessed the sound levels generated by the Quiet Cast Removal System (QCR; OrthoPediatrics Corp., Warsaw, IN), Stryker 986 Cast Vac (Stryker Corp.), and the Stryker 840 Cast Cutter (Stryker Corp.). The sound generated by these saws was measured with a sound level meter at the source and at 6, 12, and 36 inches. The sound level from each device was assessed both while operating alone and while cutting casts for a total of 3 repetitions at each of the distances tested and analyzed statistically. RESULTS The maximal mean sound intensity of the Stryker 986 and Stryker 840 saws was 90.7 and 88.6 dBA at 36 inches, respectively while cutting a cast, whereas the QCR System produced 50.1 dBA at this distance. At 6 inches, the mean sound intensity was 99.4, 96.4, and 64.5 dBA for the Stryker 840, 986, and QCR, respectively. Statistically significant differences in sound intensity between Stryker and QCR saws were noted under all testing scenarios (P<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS None of the cast saws produced intensities exceeding recommended standards for a single exposure or intensities reaching occupational hazard levels. The QCR saw was significantly quieter than both the Stryker 840 and 986 under all scenarios. The need for a recommendation of mandatory usage of hearing protection for patients and office personal could not be demonstrated. CLINICAL RELEVANCE Cast saw noise is common in orthopaedic clinics. Our study demonstrates sound levels from commercially available saws do not reach occupational hazards but are sufficiently high that practical methods to reduce intensity may be warranted.","Post, Joel M; Switzer, Kyle D; Brown, David K; Meinzen-Derr, Jareen; Dively, Jennifer; Dunkin, Bradley S; Mehlman, Charles T",Journal of pediatric orthopedics,197,31

Gorilla numbers were assessed using the recce survey method within Moukalaba-Doudou National Park (MDNP) in Gabon using fresh nest counts of up to 1 week old. We walked 3,592 km within a 23.01-km2 study site totalling a sampling effort of 297 days. Encounter rate was 0.12 fresh nests per kilometre, and gorilla density estimates generated by home range sizes (by minimal convex polygon) ranged between 1.14 and 1.48 gorillas/km2. Gorillas preferred mixed forest for nesting over other habitats (Cheason index value 1.31). Results showed that gorilla density values within the study area concurred with previous studies that used line transect methodologies. We conclude that the choice of sampling design is dependent on environmental conditions characterised by each habitat type and target species.","Ismaila, Nana; Maloueki, Ulrich",Folia primatologica; international journal of primatology,197,30

Molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in nasopharyngeal swabs is still considered the reference diagnostic approach. Nonetheless, identification of SARS-CoV-2 proteins in upper respiratory tract specimens and/or saliva by means of rapid (antigen) immunoassays is emerging as a promising screening approach. These tests have some advantages compared to molecular analysis, such as point of care availability, no need of skilled personnel and dedicated instrumentation, lower costs and short turnaround time. However, these advantages are counterbalanced by lower diagnostic sensitivity compared to molecular testing, which would only enable to identifying patients with higher SARS-CoV-2 viral load. The evidence accumulated to-date has hence persuaded us to develop a tentative algorithm, which would magnify the potential benefits of rapid antigen testing in SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics.","Mattiuzzi, Camilla; Henry, Brandon M; Lippi, Giuseppe",Diagnosis,197,9

The aim of the present study was to assess the efficacy of radioimmunotherapy (RIT) with a radiolabeled monoclonal antibody (mAb) to treat experimental colorectal liver metastases. METHODS Male Wag/Rij rats underwent a minilaparotomy with intraportal injection of 1 x 10(6) CC531 tumor cells. The biodistribution of (111)In-labeled MG1, 1 day after intravenous administration, was determined in vivo and compared with that of an isotype-matched control antibody (UPC-10). The maximal tolerated dose (MTD) of (177)Lu-labeled MG1 was determined and the therapeutic efficacy of (177)Lu-MG1 at MTD was compared with that of (177)Lu-UPC-10 and saline only. RIT was administered either at the day of tumor inoculation or 14 days after tumor inoculation. Primary endpoint was survival. RESULTS (111)In-MG1 preferentially accumulated in CC531 liver tumors (9.2 +/- 3.7%ID/g), whereas (111)In-UPC-10 did not (0.8 +/- 0.1%ID/g). The MTD of (177)Lu-MG1 was 400 MBq/kg body weight. Both the administration of (177)Lu-MG1 and (177)Lu-UPC-10 had no side-effects except a transient decrease in body weight. The survival curves of the group that received (177)Lu-UPC-10 and the group that received saline only did not differ (P = 0.407). Administration of (177)Lu-MG1 RIT immediately after surgery improved survival significantly compared with administration of (177)Lu-UPC-10 (P = 0.009) whereas delayed treatment did not (P = 0.940). CONCLUSION This study provides proof of principle that RIT can be an effective treatment modality for microscopic liver metastases, whereas RIT is not effective in larger tumors.","de Jong, Gabie M; Hendriks, Thijs; Eek, Annemarie; Oyen, Wim J G; Heskamp, Sandra; Bleichrodt, Robert P; Boerman, Otto C",Annals of surgical oncology,197,31

INTERVENTIONS Measurement of ocular blood flow using LSFG. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Measurement of ocular perfusion that is supplied mainly from the ophthalmic artery might be useful as an indicator of cerebral blood flow because the ophthalmic artery is the first branch of the internal carotid artery. Recently, LSFG has been developed for noncontact estimation of ocular perfusion using the laser speckle phenomenon. In this study, the LSFG system was used to measure blood flow in the optic nerve head during aortic arch surgery with CPB using ASCP. The blood flow in the optic nerve head during ASCP was statistically significantly reduced by 40.6% compared with the baseline value after anesthetic induction. CONCLUSIONS Ocular blood flow measured using LSFG showed favorable validity for assessment of cerebral perfusion during aortic arch surgery with ASCP.","Hayashi, Hironobu; Okamoto, Masahiro; Kawanishi, Hideaki; Matsuura, Toyoaki; Tabayashi, Nobuoki; Taniguchi, Shigeki; Kawaguchi, Masahiko",Journal of cardiothoracic and vascular anesthesia,197,1

Methods: The clinical data of 180 cases of HCC diagnosed by histopathology examination in the Second Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University from 2012 to 2019 were retrospectively analyzed. The factors influencing the development of macrovascular invasion in HCC patients were analyzed. The receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC curve) was used to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity. Results: Serum C-reactive protein (CRP) level was significantly correlated with various clinical characteristics of HCC patients, including the maximum tumor diameter, tumor number, and macrovascular invasion. Further analysis of the risk factors showed that serum direct bilirubin and CRP were independent risk factors for macrovascular invasion in HCC patients, with odds ratios of 1.747 (95% CI 1.119-2.728, P = 0.014) and 2.376 (95% CI 1.495-3.775, P < 0.001). ROC curve analysis showed that serum CRP, direct bilirubin, and the combination of the both had certain diagnostic value for hepatocellular carcinoma combined with macrovascular invasion. The area under the curve, sensitivity and specificity was 0.724, 0.668, 0.743, 79.1%, 70.1%, 79.1%, and 61.9%, 62.8%, 67.3%, respectively.

RESEARCH METHOD/DESIGN A longitudinal study of 233 participants assessed at 4 time points: within 6 weeks, 3 months, 1 year, and 2 years from the point of injury. Data were analyzed using latent growth mixture modeling to determine the best-fitting model of depression and anxiety trajectories. Covariates assessed during hospitalization were explored as predictors of the trajectories. RESULTS Analyses for depression and anxiety symptoms revealed 3 similar latent classes: a resilient pattern of stable low symptoms, a pattern of high symptoms followed by improvement (recovery), and delayed symptom elevations. A chronic high depression pattern also emerged but not a chronic high anxiety pattern. Analyses of predictors indicated that compared with other groups, resilient patients had fewer SCI-related quality of life problems, more challenge appraisals and fewer threat appraisals, greater acceptance and fighting spirit, and less coping through social reliance and behavioral disengagement. CONCLUSION/IMPLICATIONS Overall, the majority of SCI patients demonstrated considerable psychological resilience. Models for depression and anxiety evidenced a pattern of elevated symptoms followed by improvement and a pattern of delayed symptoms. Chronic high depression was also observed but not chronic high anxiety. Analyses of predictors were consistent with the hypothesis that resilient individuals view major stressors as challenges to be accepted and met with active coping efforts.

Previous studies have shown that ingestion of 2 l of polyethylenglycol (PEG) 12 hours prior to capsule ingestion leads to improved visibility in comparison to no preparation at all. We speculated that using a post-ingestion (PI), booster-based cleansing protocol might provide an alternative to the PEG cleansing protocol. METHODS This randomized, blinded, prospective study enrolled 45 individuals. Patients were allocated to either of two groups. The PEG group ingested 2 l PEG 12 hours prior to the exam (n = 22) and the PI group ingested one sachet of Picolax® dissolved in 250 ml of water one hour after swallowing the capsule with 500 ml of water (n = 18). Primary endpoints were overall small bowel and distal third of small bowel cleansing levels. Secondary endpoints were average gastric and small-bowel transit time. RESULTS Forty-five patients participated in this study. Five individuals were excluded because of incomplete study. Percentage of patients with adequate visibility in the distal third of the small bowel in the PEG group was 9% vs 72% in the PI group (p < 0.0001). Average gastric time and total transit time were shorter in the PI group vs the PEG group (p = 0.0065). CONCLUSION Timing of ingestion of the Picolax® purgative 60 minutes after swallowing the capsule endoscopy delivers better visibility in the distal third of the small bowel than the accepted cleansing protocol of ingesting 2 l PEG 12 hours prior to the capsule endoscopy procedure.","Adler, Samuel N; Farkash, Shai; Sompolinsky, Yishai; Gafanovich, Inna; Goldin, Eran; Bar-Gil Shitrit, Ariella",United European gastroenterology journal,197,1

The appearance of multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis has increased the need for new therapeutic options against these strains. Areas covered: This review covers the in vitro susceptibility, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of bedaquiline, a new drug shown to be active against M. tuberculosis-resistant strains. The authors further review clinical data concerning its use against MDR and XDR strains, discussing recent clinical guidelines from different international societies. Expert opinion: Available data demonstrate the usefulness of bedaquiline against resistant M. tuberculosis. Despite the difficulty in analyzing multidrug therapies, the use of bedaquiline in MDR and XDR tuberculosis increases success rates, allowing shortened treatments and lower drug use than previously recommended regimens. Moreover, the fact that MDR and XDR strains are common in many places creates a need to include this drug in the currently available protocols. It is essential to overcome the substantial barriers that some countries encounter in obtaining bedaquiline, as doing so will make therapeutic regimens including this drug available for all patients.","Martín-García, Marta; Esteban, Jaime",Expert opinion on pharmacotherapy,197,20

Data from patients who underwent robotic right colectomy with IA and CME from January 2015 to April 2020 were prospectively collected and retrospectively analyzed. Intraoperative outcomes and complications (minor I-II and major III-IV according to Clavien-Dindo classification), conversion rate, 30-day postoperative outcomes and pathological outcomes were the variables assessed. A total of 161 patients undergoing robotic right colectomy for cancer met the inclusion criteria. Mean operative time was 185 min, no intraoperative complications were observed, and the conversion rate was 3.7% (6 patients requiring elective conversions). Overall, mean postoperative stay was 4.9 days and the overall 30-day complication rate was 16.1%. 20 patients (12.4%) had minor complications, while major postoperative complications occurred in six patients (3.7%).

METHODS Medline, WHO COVID-19, and MedRxIV databases were searched; studies meeting inclusion criteria were reviewed in parallel, and variables describing study characteristics, study quality, and risk factor data were abstracted. Study quality was assessed using the Quality in Prognostic Studies tool. Random effects meta-analysis of relative risks (categorical variables) and unstandardized mean differences (continuous variables) was performed; multivariate models and clinical prediction rules were summarized qualitatively. RESULTS A total of 551 studies were identified and 22 studies were included. The median or mean age ranged from 38 to 68 years. All studies included only inpatients, and mortality rates ranged from 3.2% to 50.5%. Individual risk factors most strongly associated with mortality included increased age, c-reactive protein (CRP), d-dimer, heart rate, respiratory rate, lactate dehydrogenase, and procalcitonin as well as decreased oxygen saturation, the presence of dyspnea, and comorbid coronary heart and chronic kidney disease. Independent predictors of adverse outcomes reported most frequently by multivariate models include increasing age, increased CRP, decreased lymphocyte count, increased lactate dehydrogenase, elevated temperature, and the presence of any comorbidity. Simple risk scores and multivariate models have been proposed but are often complex, and most have not been validated. CONCLUSIONS Our systematic review identifies several risk factors for adverse outcomes in COVID-19-infected inpatients that are often available in the outpatient and primary care settings: increasing age, increased CRP or procalcitonin, decreased lymphocyte count, decreased oxygen saturation, dyspnea on presentation, and the presence of comorbidities. Future research to develop clinical prediction models and rules should include these predictors as part of their core data set to develop and validate pragmatic outpatient risk scores.","Bentivegna, Michelle; Hulme, Cassie; Ebell, Mark H",Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine : JABFM,197,19

A bevezetett új szakmai eljárásrendeknek, járványügyi intézkedéseknek, a megyei kórházi funkciót ellátó debreceni Kenézy Kórház Szülészeti Osztálya és a Szülészeti Klinika összevonásának, illetve a megváltozott jogi környezetnek a szülészeti ellátásra kifejtett együttes hatásait elemezzük. Módszerek: Helyi protokollokat és részletes eljárásrendeket készítettünk és vezettünk be. 1. Szülésindukció. 2. Szülésindukció cervixérlelést igénylő esetekben. 3. A szülés módjának megválasztása előzményi császármetszés után. 4. A császármetszés utáni hüvelyi szülést támogató, terminus körüli gondozási protokoll.

SUMMARY INTRODUCTION The pandemic caused by the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has catalized several changes in many fields of our lives, and also at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of the University of Debrecen, Hungary. OBJECTIVES We wanted to analyse the compound effect of our new local protocols regarding elective labour inductions at term, the coronavirus pandemic and the resulting infection control measures, the merging of the Obstetrics and Gynecology Ward of the Kenézy County Hospital of Debrecen and the University Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, and also the change of the legal environment. METHODS Local protocols were introduced: 1. Labour induction. 2. Cervical ripening in labour induction. 3. Choosing the route of delivery after cesarean. 4. Management of pregnancy around term in the case of planned trial of labour after cesarean. We compared the obstetrical data (number of deliveries, cesarean section rate, perinatal outcome and the rate and success rate of labour inductions) before and after the implementation of the protocols. The results were also compared to the Hungarian national database. RESULTS The annual cesarean rate at our department dropped to 33.5% in 2020. In the first 9-month period, after the introduction of the new reforms, the cesarean rate decreased to 30.7%, whereas the Hungarian national rate was 40.3% in 2020. At our department, 20% of all the deliveries were induced and 74% of them led to vaginal deliveries in 2020, while in 2019 only 11% of deliveries were labour inductions, and 47% of these cases were vaginal deliveries. The monthly number of deliveries was rising constantly between January 2020 (250 deliveries) and January 2021 (450 deliveries), and the monthly cesarean rate decreased from 41% to 25%. Comparing the data of 2019 and 2020, the annual perinatal mortality rate dropped from 6.3‰ in 2019 to 4.2‰ in 2020. Neonatal morbidity, as measured by admissions to the neonatal intensive care unit, also decreased (14.8% in 2019 and 13.5% in 2020). CONCLUSIONS As a compound result of the described factors, but mainly due to the new protocols, both the rate and the success rate of labour inductions increased significantly, while the cesarean rate decreased with improving perinatal mortality and morbidity.

The proposed metasurface is composed of two kinds of unit cells which are designed on the basis of the spatial k-dispersion engineering of spoof surface plasmon polaritons (SSPPs). By arranging these two kinds of unit cells in the chessboard configuration, the three functions of transmission, anomalous refraction and absorption can be integrated into one metasurface. High transmission and strong absorption can be achieved in 2.0-9.0 GHz and 12.6-20.0 GHz, respectively. Meanwhile, anomalous refraction can be achieved in 10-11.7 GHz due to forward scattering cancellation of two unit cells. To verify the design, a prototype was fabricated and measured. The measured results are consistent with the simulation ones. The metasurface can integrate multiple functions into one aperture and therefore has potential application values in multifunctional microwave devices such as shared-aperture antennas, etc.","Qu, Bingyue; Pang, Yongqiang; Zhang, An Xue; Yan, Sen; Xu, Zhuo",Optics express,197,20

Clinical experience of prophylactic treatment of respiratory tract infections with the marketed CHMP containing horseradish root (Armoraciae rusticanae radix) and nasturtium (Tropaeoli majoris herba) has existed for decades. METHODS The study was performed as a phase III, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial. All groups received two film coated tablets three times a day. Group 1 received the CHMP tablets 3 × 2 per day, group 2 the CHMP tablets 2 × 2 and placebo tablets 2 × 1 per day and group 3 received placebo tablets 3 × 2 per day. Maximum duration of treatment was 84 days. The primary efficacy criterion was the comparison of the incidences of new occurring RTIs between the treatment groups during the prophylactic treatment. In addition the character of occurring infections, number of sick days and severity of infections were compared. Further criteria were subjects' well being, the satisfaction of subjects with the respective treatments and severity and incidence of the observed adverse events (AE) and serious adverse events (SAE) during the study period. TRIAL REGISTRATION EudraCT No. 2010-023227-26. RESULTS From 371 subjects screened, a total of 351 subjects of both sexes from 18 to 75 years were randomly allocated to one of the three groups. In order to achieve scientifically and medically impeccable results it was necessary to address acute infections of the respiratory tract occurring during the normal incubation period. Early infections (≤day 7) were excluded from the data set in a sensitivity analysis. In the intention to treat (ITT) population excluding early infections ≤day 7 (n = 344) the infection rates were 13.3% for CHMP 3 × 2 (n = 113), 18.4% for CHMP 2 × 2 (n = 114) and 25.6% for placebo (n = 117). The statistical trend test showed significant results (p = 0.0171). For the per protocol (PP) population - also excluding infections ≤day 7 (n = 334) - infection rates were: CHMP 3 × 2 (n = 110) 12.7%, CHMP 2 × 2 (n = 113) 18.6% and placebo (n = 111) 24.3% (p = 0.0266). Secondary parameters of infections (infection diagnosis, intensity, duration) showed no relevant differences between the treatment groups. The study medication was well tolerated. LIMITATIONS This was the first clinical ICH-GCP study with the CHMP conducted in this indication and with a sufficient number of subjects. The study population comprised subjects from 18 to 75 years and covered different diagnoses of RTIs. The results show a benefit when using 3 × 2 film tablets of CHMP for prophylaxis of RTIs. However, no data are available on use of the CHMP in this indication in children, adolescents and the elderly (over 75 years). CONCLUSION This trial demonstrates the efficacy and safety of the combination herbal medicinal product as the treatment of first choice in the prophylactic treatment of episodes of respiratory tract infections. Clinical experience was confirmed in an ICH-GCP study.","Fintelmann, Volker; Albrecht, Uwe; Schmitz, Gregor; Schnitker, Jörg",Current medical research and opinion,197,30

High Kidney Donor Profile Index kidneys continue to be discarded at high rates as a result of the regulatory and financial barriers to widespread utilization of these organs. However, there are potential changes to clinical practice that could improve organ utilization. Expediting the time from initial offer to final organ acceptance would reduce cold ischemic time and should improve utilization. Implementation of procurement biopsy standards to avoid biopsy of low risk organs may prevent organ discards due to inaccurate data or excessive cold ischemia time. Further, standardization of procurement biopsy pathological interpretation coupled with electronic accessibility would enable early acceptance of difficult to transplant organs. These changes to allocation practice patterns are vital given proposals to expand the geographic sharing of deceased donor kidneys. Implementation of new allocation policies must be evaluated to ensure they result in higher transplant rates and acceptable post-transplant outcomes.","Stewart, Zoe A; Shah, Shimul A; Formica, Richard N; Kandaswamy, Raja; Paramesh, Anil S; Friedman, Jessica; Squires, Ronald; Cooper, Matthew; Axelrod, David A",Clinical transplantation,197,1

Our objective was to determine the feasibility and effects of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) combined with resistance training (RT) in older adults with HIV. We conducted a cross-over pilot study within a randomized exercise trial in sedentary adults with HIV ≥50 years of age. First, participants were randomized to 4 months of continuous high-intensity aerobic exercise (AEX) and RT 3x/week or standard of care control. Then, the control group completed 4 months of HIIT + RT (3x/week). Among the 32 individuals enrolled, 26 eligible participants were randomized. Most participants were African American (63%) and male (95%) with a mean (SD) age of 61.5 (6.7) years and VO2peak of 24.5 (4.9) ml/kg/min. Attendance and adherence to both exercise training interventions were high. The clinically significant increases in VO2peak (ml/kg/min) after HIIT (3.09 ±1.04, p=0.02) and AEX (2.09 ±0.72, p=0.01) represented improvements of 17.1% and 7.7%, respectively. Both groups had improvements in exercise endurance (time on the treadmill) and strength (all p< 0.01). This pilot study supports HIIT as an efficient means to deliver high-intensity AEX to improve cardiorespiratory fitness toward the goal of attenuating the accelerated ageing process in adults with HIV.","Briggs, Brandon C; Ryan, Alice S; Sorkin, John D; Oursler, Krisann K",Journal of sports sciences,197,8

Secondary distribution of home-based HIV self-test kits by AGYW to male partners (MP) is a novel prevention strategy that complements pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a female-controlled prevention intervention. The objective of this analysis was to qualitatively operationalize two HIV prevention cascades through the lens of relationship dynamics for secondary distribution of HIV self-tests to MP and PrEP for AGYW. METHODS From April 2018 to December 2018, 2200 HIV-negative AGYW aged 16-24 years were enrolled into an HIV prevention intervention which involved secondary distribution of self-tests to MP and PrEP for AGYW; of these women, 91 participants or MP were sampled for in-depth interviews based on their degree of completion of the two HIV prevention cascades. A grounded theory approach was used to characterize participants' relationship profiles, which were mapped to participants' engagement with the interventions. RESULTS In cases where AGYW had a MP with multiple partners, AGYW perceived both interventions as inviting distrust into the relationship and insinuating non-monogamy. Many chose not to accept either intervention, while others accepted and attempted to deliver the self-test kit but received a negative reaction from their MP. In the few cases where AGYW held multiple partnerships, both interventions were viewed as mechanisms for protecting one's health, and these AGYW exhibited confidence in accepting and delivering the self-test kits and initiating PrEP. Women who indicated intimate partner violence experiences chose not to accept either intervention because they feared it would elicit a violent reaction from their MP. For AGYW in relationships described as committed and emotionally open, self-test kit delivery was completed with ease, but PrEP was viewed as unnecessary. MP experience with the cascade corroborated AGYW perspectives and demonstrated how men can perceive female-initiated HIV prevention options as beneficial for AGYW and a threat to MP masculinity. CONCLUSIONS Screening to identify AGYW relationship dynamics can support tailoring prevention services to relationship-driven barriers and facilitators. HIV prevention counseling for AGYW should address relationship goals or partner's influence, and engage with MP around female-controlled prevention interventions.","Holmes, Leah E; Kaufman, Michelle R; Casella, Albert; Mudavanhu, Mutsa; Mutunga, Lillian; Polzer, Tara; Bassett, Jean; Van Rie, Annelies; Schwartz, Sheree",Journal of the International AIDS Society,197,17

METHODS The clinical data of 278 patients with COVID-19 admitted to Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital from January 20th to February 10th in 2020 were collected. The patients were divided into mild, ordinary, severe and critical types. The differences of clinical symptoms and signs, laboratory examination indexes and CT image features of lung in different clinical types were analyzed and compared, and the relationship between clinical and imaging features and clinical types of diseases were analyzed. RESULTS Among the 278 patients with COVID-19, 130 were male (46.8%) and 148 were female (53.2%), of whom 88.8% (247/278) were 20 to 69 years old. 238 (85.6%) patients combined one or more basic diseases. The source of cases was mainly imported cases (n = 201, 72.3%), of whom 89 cases were imported from Wuhan, accounting for 44.3% of all imported cases. With the aggravation of the disease, the male composition ratio, age and the number of basic diseases of patients gradually increased, and the incidences of fever, dry cough, chilly or chills, and fatigue in severe and critical patients were significantly higher than those in the mild and ordinary ones. The white blood cell count (WBC), neutrophil counts (NEU) and proportions (NEU%) of the severe and critical patients were higher than those of the mild and ordinary patients [WBC (×109/L): 5.7±3.1, 6.5±2.4 vs. 5.4±1.7, 4.9±1.6; NEU (×109/L): 4.4±3.1, 4.9±2.5 vs. 2.8±1.2, 2.9±1.3; NEU%: 0.72±0.13, 0.73±0.14 vs. 0.51±0.12, 0.59±0.11; all P < 0.01], while the lymphocyte count (LYM) and ratio (LYM%), platelet count (PLT) were lower than those in the mild and ordinary patients [LYM (×109/L): 1.0±0.4, 1.2±0.8 vs. 2.1±0.9, 1.5±0.6; LYM%: 0.21±0.11, 0.20±0.12 vs. 0.40±0.11, 0.32±0.11; PLT (×109/L): 177.1±47.8, 157.7±51.6 vs. 215.3±59.7, 191.8±64.3; all P < 0.05]. The level of albumin (Alb) was the lowest in the critical patients and the level of total bilirubin (TBil) was the highest, which was statistically significant as compared with the mild, ordinary and severe patients [Alb (g/L): 33.0±5.8 vs. 42.8±4.4, 39.6±5.1, 34.4±4.2; TBil (μmol/L): 20.1±12.8 vs. 12.0±8.7, 10.9±6.3, 12.2±8.3; both P < 0.01].

C-reactive protein (CRP) level of severe patients were higher than that in the mild, ordinary and critical patients [mg/L: 43.3 (33.2, 72.1) vs. 22.1 (16.2, 25.7), 29.7 (19.8, 43.1), 25.8 (23.0, 36.7), P < 0.01]. The level of procalcitonin (PCT) in the severe and critical patients was higher than that in the mild and ordinary patients [μg/L: 0.17 (0.12, 0.26), 0.13 (0.09, 0.24) vs. 0.06 (0.05, 0.08), 0.05 (0.04, 0.09), P < 0.01]. The typical CT imaging features were as follows: the ordinary type mainly showed the single or multiple ground glass shadows on the chest image; the severe type mainly showed the multiple ground glass shadows, infiltration shadows or solid transformation shadows. Compared with the ordinary patients, the lesions increase, and the scope of the lesion expanded to show double lungs. Critical type was mainly manifested as diffuse consolidation of both lungs with multiple patchy density increase shadows, multiple leafy patchy density increase shadows were seen on each leaf, most of them were ground glass-like density, and some were shown separately lung consolidation.

Our focus here is to predict the number of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLHA) in India so that the results can assist the NACP III planning team to determine appropriate targets to be activated during the project period (2007-2012). We have constructed a dynamical model that captures the mixing patterns between susceptibles and infectives in both low-risk and high-risk groups in the population. Our aim is to project the HIV estimates by taking into account general interventions for susceptibles and additional interventions, such as targeted interventions among high risk groups, provision of anti-retroviral therapy, and behavior change among HIV-positive individuals. Continuing the current level of interventions in NACP II, the model estimates there will be 5.06 million PLHA by the end of 2011. If 50 percent of the targets in NACP III are achieved by the end of the above period then about 0.8 million new infections will be averted in that year. The current status of the epidemic appears to be less severe compared to the trend observed in the late 1990s. The projections based on the second phase and the third phase of the NACP indicate prevention programmes which are directed towards the general and high-risk populations, and HIV-positive individuals will determine the decline or stabilization of the epidemic. Model based results are derived separately for the revised HIV estimates released in 2007. According to revised projections there will be 2.08 million PLHA by 2012 if 50 percent of the targets in NACP III are reached. We perform a Monte Carlo procedure for sensitivity analysis of parameters and model validation. We also predict a positive role of implementation of anti-retroviral therapy treatment of 90 percent of the eligible people in the country. We present methods for obtaining disease progression parameters using convolution approaches.

Although these data are often stored in electronic health records (EHRs) and potentially very accessible, few studies on obesity and weight loss have used data derived from EHRs. We developed processes for obtaining data from the EHR in order to construct a database on patients undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery. METHODS Clinical data obtained as part of standard of care in a bariatric surgery program at an integrated health delivery system were extracted from the EHR and deposited into a data warehouse. Data files were extracted, cleaned, and stored in research datasets. To illustrate the utility of the data, Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to estimate length of post-operative follow-up. RESULTS Demographic, laboratory, medication, co-morbidity, and survey data were obtained from 2028 patients who had undergone RYGB at the same institution since 2004. Pre-and post-operative diagnostic and prescribing information were available on all patients, while survey laboratory data were available on a majority of patients. The number of patients with post-operative laboratory test results varied by test. Based on Kaplan-Meier estimates, over 74% of patients had post-operative weight data available at 4 years. CONCLUSION A variety of EHR-derived data related to obesity can be efficiently obtained and used to study important outcomes following RYGB.","Wood, G Craig; Chu, Xin; Manney, Christina; Strodel, William; Petrick, Anthony; Gabrielsen, Jon; Seiler, Jamie; Carey, David; Argyropoulos, George; Benotti, Peter; Still, Christopher D; Gerhard, Glenn S",BMC medical informatics and decision making,197,1

All residues involved in the catalysis, substrate binding and dimerisation are 100% conserved. Comparison of the polyprotein PP1AB sequences showed 86% identity. The 3C-like cleavage sites on the coronaviral polyproteins are highly conserved. Based on the near-identical substrate specificities and high sequence identities, we are of the opinion that some of the previous progress of specific inhibitors development for the SARS-CoV enzyme can be conferred on its SARS-CoV-2 counterpart. With the 3CL pro molecular model, we performed virtual screening for purchasable drugs and proposed 16 candidates for consideration. Among these, the antivirals ledipasvir or velpatasvir are particularly attractive as therapeutics to combat the new coronavirus with minimal side effects, commonly fatigue and headache. The drugs Epclusa (velpatasvir/sofosbuvir) and Harvoni (ledipasvir/sofosbuvir) could be very effective owing to their dual inhibitory actions on two viral enzymes.","Chen, Yu Wai; Yiu, Chin-Pang Bennu; Wong, Kwok-Yin",F1000Research,197,1

Early detection of breast cancer, either through screening or early diagnosis initiatives, led by community health workers (CHWs) has been proposed as a potential way to address the unjustly high mortality rates. We therefore document: (1) where and how CHWs are currently deployed in this role; (2) how CHWs are trained, including the content, duration and outcomes of training; and (3) the evidence on costs associated with deploying CHWs in breast cancer early detection. METHODS We conducted a systematic scoping review and searched eight major databases, as well as the grey literature. We included original studies focusing on the role of CHWs to assist in breast cancer early detection in a country defined as a LMIC according to the World Bank. FINDINGS 16 eligible studies were identified. Several roles were identified for CHWs including awareness raising and community education (n=13); history taking (n=7); performing clinical breast examination (n=9); making onward referrals (n=7); and assisting in patient navigation and follow-up (n=4). Details surrounding training programmes were poorly reported and no studies provided a formal cost analysis. CONCLUSIONS Despite the relative paucity of studies addressing the role of CHWs in breast cancer early detection, as well as the heterogeneity of existing studies, evidence suggests that CHWs can play a number of important roles in breast cancer early detection initiatives in LMICs. However, if they are to realise their full potential, they must be appropriately supported within the wider health system.","O'Donovan, James; Newcomb, Ashley; MacRae, MacKenzie Clark; Vieira, Dorice; Onyilofor, Chinelo; Ginsburg, Ophira",BMJ global health,197,1

While the majority of WT is sporadic in origin, germline intragenic mutations of predisposition genes such as WT1, REST and TRIM28 have been described in apparently isolated (non-familial) WT.Despite constitutional CNVs being a well-studied cause of developmental disorders, their role in cancer predisposition is less well defined, so that the interpretation of cancer risks associated with specific CNVs can be complex. OBJECTIVE To highlight the role of a constitutional deletion CNV (delCNV) encompassing the REST tumour suppressor gene in diffuse hyperplastic perilobar nephroblastomatosis (HPLN).

Sepsis and hypovolemia are the 2 most frequent etiologies of AKI in intensive care units and frequently coexist in critically ill patients. Effective fluid resuscitation is crucial for the stabilization of sepsis-induced tissue hypoperfusion or septic shock. However, the lack of a goal-directed therapy targeting kidney oxygenation prevents from optimization of the fluid therapy with regard to improvement of renal oxygen delivery and extraction. Similarly, fluid administration as all therapeutic actions carries adverse effects such as the activation of cytokines, disruption of the capillary glycocalyx, and adverse effects on kidney metabolism and oxygenation. Moreover, a positive fluid balance is associated with an increased risk of AKI and is a negative predictor for recovery of renal function. The role of fluid resuscitation on kidney injury stems from the high renal vulnerability to hypoxemic injury. Indeed, fluids have a poor oxygen solubility and hemodilution decreases blood viscosity both promoting intrarenal shunting and heterogeneity with a decreased capillary density and enhanced intrarenal cortex and medullary hypoxia. The development of physiological biomarkers that are able to detect the early development of AKI specifically aimed at the identification of renal microcirculatory dysfunctions should form a valuable contribution to monitoring therapeutic modalities.","Montomoli, Jonathan; Donati, Abele; Ince, Can",Nephron,197,1

The proximal FD failed to expand and an attempt at balloon angioplasty led to fatal rupture of the MCA. RESULTS Autopsy demonstrated subarachnoid hemorrhage, vessel rupture and fracture of the proximal high-porosity stent. Microscopic photographs showed that the FD had failed to open because the guiding wire had inadvertently exited and re-entered the proximal segment of the high-porosity stent partially incorporated to the wall of the MCA. Balloon dilatation of the FD which had remained collapsed between the stent and the vessel wall caused fracture of the stent and rupture of the artery.

For tackling this public health problem, preventive public health and policy actions are urgently needed. Some countries implemented food taxes in the past and some were subsequently abolished. Some countries, such as Norway, Hungary, Denmark, Bermuda, Dominica, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and the Navajo Nation (USA), specifically implemented taxes on unprocessed sugar and sugar-added foods. These taxes on unprocessed sugar and sugar-added foods are fiscal policy interventions, implemented to decrease their consumption and in turn reduce adverse health-related, economic and social effects associated with these food products. OBJECTIVES To assess the effects of taxation of unprocessed sugar or sugar-added foods in the general population on the consumption of unprocessed sugar or sugar-added foods, the prevalence and incidence of overweight and obesity, and the prevalence and incidence of other diet-related health outcomes. SEARCH METHODS We searched CENTRAL, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, MEDLINE, Embase and 15 other databases and trials registers on 12 September 2019. We handsearched the reference list of all records of included studies, searched websites of international organisations and institutions, and contacted review advisory group members to identify planned, ongoing or unpublished studies. SELECTION CRITERIA We included studies with the following populations: children (0 to 17 years) and adults (18 years or older) from any country and setting. Exclusion applied to studies with specific subgroups, such as people with any disease who were overweight or obese as a side-effect of the disease. The review included studies with taxes on or artificial increases of selling prices for unprocessed sugar or food products that contain added sugar (e.g. sweets, ice cream, confectionery, and bakery products), or both, as intervention, regardless of the taxation level or price increase. In line with Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) criteria, we included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster-randomised controlled trials (cRCTs), non-randomised controlled trials (nRCTs), controlled before-after (CBA) studies, and interrupted time series (ITS) studies. We included controlled studies with more than one intervention or control site and ITS studies with a clearly defined intervention time and at least three data points before and three after the intervention. Our primary outcomes were consumption of unprocessed sugar or sugar-added foods, energy intake, overweight, and obesity. Our secondary outcomes were substitution and diet, expenditure, demand, and other health outcomes. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently screened all eligible records for inclusion, assessed the risk of bias, and performed data extraction.Two review authors independently assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. MAIN RESULTS We retrieved a total of 24,454 records. After deduplicating records, 18,767 records remained for title and abstract screening. Of 11 potentially relevant studies, we included one ITS study with 40,210 household-level observations from the Hungarian Household Budget and Living Conditions Survey. The baseline ranged from January 2008 to August 2011, the intervention was implemented on September 2011, and follow-up was until December 2012 (16 months). The intervention was a tax - the so-called 'Hungarian public health product tax' - on sugar-added foods, including selected foods exceeding a specific sugar threshold value. The intervention includes co-interventions: the taxation of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) and of foods high in salt or caffeine. The study provides evidence on the effect of taxing foods exceeding a specific sugar threshold value on the consumption of sugar-added foods. After implementation of the Hungarian public health product tax, the mean consumption of taxed sugar-added foods (measured in units of kg) decreased by 4.0% (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.040, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.07 to -0.01; very low-certainty evidence). The study was at low risk of bias in terms of performance bias, detection bias and reporting bias, with the shape of effect pre-specified and the intervention unlikely to have any effect on data collection. The study was at unclear risk of attrition bias and at high risk in terms of other bias and the independence of the intervention. We rated the certainty of the evidence as very low for the primary and secondary outcomes. The Hungarian public health product tax included a tax on sugar-added foods but did not include a tax on unprocessed sugar. We did not find eligible studies reporting on the taxation of unprocessed sugar. No studies reported on the primary outcomes of consumption of unprocessed sugar, energy intake, overweight, and obesity. No studies reported on the secondary outcomes of substitution and diet, demand, and other health outcomes. No studies reported on differential effects across population subgroups. We could not perform meta-analyses or pool study results. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS There was very limited evidence and the certainty of the evidence was very low. Despite the reported reduction in consumption of taxed sugar-added foods, we are uncertain whether taxing unprocessed sugar or sugar-added foods has an effect on reducing their consumption and preventing obesity or other adverse health outcomes. Further robustly conducted studies are required to draw concrete conclusions on the effectiveness of taxing unprocessed sugar or sugar-added foods for reducing their consumption and preventing obesity or other adverse health outcomes.","Pfinder, Manuela; Heise, Thomas L; Hilton Boon, Michele; Pega, Frank; Fenton, Candida; Griebler, Ursula; Gartlehner, Gerald; Sommer, Isolde; Katikireddi, Srinivasa Vittal; Lhachimi, Stefan K",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,197,5

Such a nanovaccine inhibits established ovalbumin-expressing B16-OVA melanoma. More importantly, a mix of the fluoropolymer with cell membranes from resected autologous primary tumours synergizes with checkpoint blockade therapy to inhibit post-surgical tumour recurrence and metastases in two subcutaneous tumour models and an orthotopic breast cancer tumour.

The study of these bacteria, discovered in 1985, is complicated by the difficulty of their detection with cultural methods. According to modern researches, the bacteria F.alocis with good reason can be included in the red complex of periodontal pathogens as the most important pathogens of chronic periodontitis. F.alocis is a synergist of such a key pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis, as well as a frequent satellite of Fusobacterium nucleatum and, somewhat less frequently, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. F.alocis is practically not found in healthy people (except for smokers), with a high frequency accompanies the aggressive course of periodontal disease, and also recorded in endodontitis. Due to the ability to participate in the metabolism of arginine, expressed protease activity, a wide range of virulence factors, F.alocis not only colonizes the periodontal tissues, but also significantly affects the formation of the community of periodontal microorganisms (including viruses), contributing to their invasion of epithelial tissues. F. alocis has a number of unique properties, including resistance to oxidative stress conditions in the home defeat, induction of apoptosis of epithelial cells, extracellular matrix degradation of periodontal tissues, activation of proinflammatory cytokines formulation in sites of its presence, suppression of protective reactions of neutrophilic granulocytes, inhibition of the process of complement activation.","Balmasova, I P; Tsarev, V N; Arutyunov, S D; Babayev, E A",Stomatologiia,197,1

(1) The patients were divided into two groups according to whether to take lopinavir/ritonavir (kaletra). It was shown that the incidence of liver dysfunction in patients taking kaletra was significantly higher than those who did not take kaletra (7-day abnormal rate of ALT was 54% vs. 33%, the abnormal rate of AST was 38% vs. 33%, the abnormal rate of TBil was 8% vs. 0%), but there were no statistical differences (all P > 0.05). (2) The patients were divided into normal dose group (500 mg, twice a day, n = 19) and reduced dose group (250 mg, twice a day, n = 5) according to the dosage of kaletra. It was shown that patients taking low-dose kaletra had a smaller effect on liver function within 1 week after ICU admission than those receiving normal dosage, and ALB, TBil in the reduced dose group were significantly lower than those in the normal dose group on the 2nd day after ICU admission [ALB (g/L): 33.3±2.0 vs. 37.5±4.0, TBil (μmol/L): 6.3±3.3 vs. 11.3±4.8, both P < 0.05]. CONCLUSIONS Severe COVID-19 patients in Sichuan area suffered obvious liver damage in the early course of the disease and have a slower recovery. It is important to pay attention to avoid using drugs that can aggravate liver damage while treating the disease. If there is no alternative drug, liver protection treatment should be considered appropriately.","Li, Tianlong; Deng, Chao; Du, Qing; Yue, Ruiming; Lu, Sen; Chen, Hong; Guo, Yang; Huang, Xiaobo",Zhonghua wei zhong bing ji jiu yi xue,197,27

The aim of this study is to compare safety and efficacy outcomes after endovascular treatment in patients with and without prior antiplatelet therapy. METHODS We analyzed patients registered in the MR CLEAN Registry between March 2014 and November 2017, for whom data on antiplatelet therapy were available. We used propensity score nearest-neighbor matching with replacement to balance the probability of receiving prior antiplatelet therapy between the prior antiplatelet therapy and no prior antiplatelet therapy group and adjusted for baseline prognostic factors to compare these groups. Primary outcome was symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage. Secondary outcomes were 90-day functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale), successful reperfusion (extended thrombolysis in cerebral infarction score ≥2B) and 90-day mortality. RESULTS Thirty percent (n = 937) of the 3154 patients were on prior antiplatelet therapy, who were matched to 477 patients not on prior antiplatelet therapy. Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage occurred in 74/937 (7.9%) patients on prior antiplatelet therapy and in 27/477 (5.6%) patients without prior antiplatelet therapy adjusted odds ratio 1.47, 95% confidence interval 0.86-2.49. No associations were found between prior antiplatelet therapy and functional outcome (adjusted common odds ratio 0.87, 95% confidence interval 0.65-1.16), successful reperfusion (adjusted odds ratio 1.23, 95% confidence interval 0.77-1.97), or 90-day mortality (adjusted odds ratio 1.15, 95% confidence interval 0.86-1.54). CONCLUSION We found no evidence of an association of prior antiplatelet therapy with the risk of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage after endovascular treatment, nor on functional outcome, reperfusion, or mortality. A substantial beneficial or detrimental effect of antiplatelet therapy on clinical outcome cannot be excluded. A randomized clinical trial comparing antiplatelet therapy versus no antiplatelet therapy is needed.","van de Graaf, Rob A; Zinkstok, Sanne M; Chalos, Vicky; Goldhoorn, Robert-Jan B; Majoie, Charles Blm; van Oostenbrugge, Robert J; van der Lugt, Aad; Dippel, Diederik Wj; Roos, Yvo Bwem; Lingsma, Hester F; van Es, Adriaan Cgm; Roozenbeek, Bob",International journal of stroke : official journal of the International Stroke Society,197,16

Socioeconomic heterogeneity across counties closely manifests differences in the post-NPIs growth rate of incidence, which is a crucial indicator to guide future infectious control policy making. Few studies, however, examined the geospatial and sociological variations in the epidemic growth across different time points of NPIs. OBJECTIVE To guide a more effective reopening plan while controlling the transmission, the current study aims at 1) identifying hotspots of the growth rate of COVID-19 incidence among the 57 counties and New York City in NYS over time, and 2) examining the association of COVID-19 growth rates after eight critical NPIs time points and most relevant county-level sociological predictors. METHODS County-level COVID-19 incidence rates were retrieved from the Social Explorer Website between March 7, 2020 to June 22, 2020. 5-day moving average growth rates of COVID-19 incidence were calculated for 16 selected time points, including the dates of eight NPIs and their respective 14-day-lag-behind time points. A total of 36 county-level indicators were extracted from multiple public datasets. Geospatial mapping and heatmap were used to analyze spatial and temporal heterogeneity of county-level COVID-19 outbreak over selected NPIs-related dates. Generalized mixed effect least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression, controlling for the 5-day moving average growth rates of COVID-19 testing rates, was employed to identify significant county-level predictors related to the changes of county-level COVID-19 growth rates over time. RESULTS COVID-19 infection increased and peaked by the end of March (η=22.50%). Growth rates of COVID-19 decreased by 50.48% after implementing NPIs such as closures of schools, non-essential businesses, parks, and subways. There was a geospatial shift in the region with the highest growth rates from New York metropolitan area towards Western and Northern regions over time. Proportions of population aged 45 years and above (β=3.25 [0.17-6.32]), living alone at residential houses (β=3.31 [0.39--6.22]), and proportion of crowd residential houses (β=6.15 [2.15-10.14]) were positively associated with the growth rate of COVID-19 infection. In contrast, living alone at rental houses (β=-2.47 [-4.83--0.12]) and rate of mental health providers (β=-1.11 [-1.95--0.28]) were negatively associated with COVID-19 growth rate across all 16 time points. CONCLUSIONS There are geospatial differences in COVID-19 incidence after implementing different NPIs. Socioeconomic, racial/ethnic, and healthcare resource disparities at the structural and historical levels across counties need to be considered in infection control policymaking to narrow the unequal health impact on vulnerable populations effectively.

Therefore, target immobilization by general anesthesia with high-frequency jet ventilation (HFJV) instead of conventional ventilation (CV) with repeated breath-holds may facilitate and speed up navigation of RF ablation probes. MATERIALS AND METHODS Nineteen consecutive patients who underwent percutaneous RF ablation of liver (n = 9) or renal tumors (n = 10) with CT guidance under HFJV (n = 9) or CV (n = 10) were included. The choice of the anesthesiologic technique was left to the discretion of the interventionalist. Complexity of the intervention (ie, number of lesions ablated per session, conspicuity of the lesion on nonenhanced CT, and access pathway), volume of the ablated tissue, radiation exposure, and complications were compared between the HFJV and CV groups. RESULTS In this feasibility study, a statistically significant radiation dose reduction (P < .05) was noted in the HFJV group compared with the CV group for liver and renal RF ablation. No complications were observed in the HFJV group, whereas renal subcapsular hematoma (n = 2) and pulmonary embolism (n = 1) occurred in the CV group. CONCLUSIONS Percutaneous CT-guided navigation of RF ablation probes under HFJV is feasible and safe. It might be advantageous for the treatment of complex kidney and liver tumors, allowing less irradiation exposure to the patient and the interventional radiologist.","Abderhalden, Susanne; Biro, Peter; Hechelhammer, Lukas; Pfiffner, Roger; Pfammatter, Thomas",Journal of vascular and interventional radiology : JVIR,197,7

These parameters are based on heart-lung interaction during positive mechanical pressure ventilation: Cyclic changes of intrathoracic pressure result in a reduced venous return and a decreased cardiac stroke volume after inspiration followed by a restoration of preload and stroke volume after expiration. Hemodynamic monitoring systems based on pulse wave analysis allow an automatic assessment of SVV and--at least for some of the devices--of PPV. Moreover, PPV is being integrated in the standard monitoring in the operating room and the intensive care unit, and the noninvasive plethysmographic assessment of fluid responsiveness has been recently introduced. These developments will result in a broader application of functional hemodynamic parameters in the near future. In contrast to traditional preload parameters (i.e. central venous pressure), SVV and PPV allow the prediction of fluid responsiveness and thus the determination of the actual position on an individual Frank-Starling curve or--in other words--the assessment of an individual preload reserve. Different studies in the last decade were able to prove the validity of this concept. However, to use these functional hemodynamic parameters in daily clinical practice, some limitations have to be considered. Arrhythmia and right heart failure, but also spontaneous breathing of a patient, or small tidal volumes may preclude reliable assessment. Based on these aspects, an ideal area of application of these parameters may be the use during perioperative hemodynamic optimization to improve patient outcome. However, only few studies on goal-directed therapy guided by these parameters have been published so far.","Hofer, Christoph K; Cannesson, Maxime",Acta anaesthesiologica Taiwanica : official journal of the Taiwan Society of Anesthesiologists,197,19

In this pilot study, we assessed blood levels of tau protein as a prognostic marker for the neurological outcome after 6 months in patients treated with hypothermia after resuscitation from CA. METHODS 22 unconscious patients resuscitated after CA were treated with mild hypothermia (32-34°C) for 26 h. Blood samples were collected at 2, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 96 h after CA, and the concentration of tau protein was analyzed. Neurological outcome was assessed with the Glasgow-Pittsburgh cerebral performance category (CPC) scale at intensive care unit (ICU) discharge and after 6 months. The higher of the two CPC scores was used. RESULTS At ICU discharge, 21/22 patients were alive, of whom 10 had a good (CPC 1-2) outcome. After 6 months, 15/22 patients were alive, of whom 14 had a good outcome. Tau protein levels were higher among those with a poor outcome at 48 h and 96 h. At 96 h sampling, tau concentration predicted a poor outcome (CPC 3-5) with a sensitivity of 71% and a specificity of 93%. CONCLUSIONS Although in a pilot study, a late increase in plasma tau protein seems to be associated with a worse outcome after hypothermia treatment after CA, although more studies are needed.","Mörtberg, E; Zetterberg, H; Nordmark, J; Blennow, K; Catry, C; Decraemer, H; Vanmechelen, E; Rubertsson, S",Acta anaesthesiologica Scandinavica,197,16

HYPOTHESIS Individual risk factors in athletes with shoulder instability who are managed nonoperatively can be integrated into a scoring system that can predict successful return to sport. STUDY DESIGN Retrospective cohort study. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE Level 4. METHODS A total of 57 scholastic athletes with primary anterior shoulder instability who were managed nonoperatively were reviewed. Success was defined as a return to index sport at the same level and playing at least 1 subsequent season without missed time as a result of the shoulder. Patient-specific risk factors were individually evaluated, and odds ratios were calculated. A 10-point Nonoperative Injury Severity Index Score (NISIS) incorporated the risk factors for failure. This score was then retrospectively applied with regression analysis and a chi-square analysis to determine the overall optimal score that predicted failure of nonoperative management. RESULTS In total, 6 risk factors for failure were included in the NISIS: age (>15 years), bone loss, type of instability, type of sport (contact vs noncontact), male sex, and arm dominance. Overall, 79% of patients treated nonoperatively were able to successfully return to sport. Nearly all (97%) low-risk patients (NISIS <7) successfully returned to sport, while only 59% of high-risk patients returned to sport, a relative risk of 12.2 (P = 0.001). High-risk patients with unipolar bone loss successfully returned (100%), but 67% of high-risk patients with bipolar bone loss failed. CONCLUSION The NISIS is a simple and effective clinical tool to determine successful nonoperative management following anterior shoulder instability and may be helpful in guiding decision making when presented with the unstable shoulder in the scholastic athlete.","Tokish, John M; Thigpen, Charles A; Kissenberth, Michael J; Tolan, Stefan J; Lonergan, Keith T; Tokish, John M; Dickens, Jonathan F; Hawkins, Richard J; Shanley, Ellen",Sports health,197,26

Zinc complexes 2Zn and 3Zn show very low solubilities in water, making them useful for preparing Tc-99m radiopharmaceuticals with a potentially high molar activity. Thus, the transmetallation reaction in water medium between the zinc complexes 2Zn or 3Zn and the cation fac-[99mTc(H2O)3(CO)3]+, in the presence of the monodentate ligand TPPTS, leads to the formation of the 2 + 1 complexes fac-[99mTc(CO)3(SS)(P)] bioconjugated to folic acid (2Tc and 3Tc). In spite of the low solubility of 2Zn and 3Zn in water, the reaction yield is higher than 95%, and the excess zinc reagent is easily removed by centrifugation. The Tc-99m complexes were characterized by comparing their HPLC with those of the homologous rhenium complexes (2Re and 3Re) previously synthesized and characterized by standard methods. Preliminary in vivo studies with 2Tc and 3Tc indicate low specific binding to folate receptors. In summary, Tc-99m folates 2Tc and 3Tc were prepared in high yields, using a one-pot transmetallation reaction with low soluble zinc dithiocarbamates (>1 ppm), at moderate temperature, without needing a subsequent purification step.","Borràs, Jordi; Foster, Julie; Kashani, Roxana; Meléndez-Alafort, Laura; Sosabowski, Jane; Suades, Joan; Barnadas-Rodríguez, Ramon",Molecules,197,9

We sought to determine features that predict progression and define outcomes of patients with progressive dural arteriovenous fistulas. MATERIALS AND METHODS We performed a retrospective imaging and clinical record review of patients with intracranial dural arteriovenous fistula evaluated at our hospital. RESULTS Of 579 patients with intracranial dural arteriovenous fistulas, 545 had 1 fistula (mean age, 45 ± 23 years) and 34 (5.9%) had enlarging, de novo, multiple, or recurrent fistulas (mean age, 53 ± 20 years; P = .11). Among these 34 patients, 19 had progressive dural arteriovenous fistulas with de novo fistulas or fistula enlargement with time (mean age, 36 ± 25 years; progressive group) and 15 had multiple or recurrent but nonprogressive fistulas (mean age, 57 ± 13 years; P = .0059, nonprogressive group). Whereas all 6 children had fistula progression, only 13/28 adults (P = .020) progressed. Angioarchitectural correlates to chronically elevated intracranial venous pressures, including venous sinus dilation (41% versus 7%, P = .045) and pseudophlebitic cortical venous pattern (P = .048), were more common in patients with progressive disease than in those without progression. Patients with progressive disease received more treatments than those without progression (median, 5 versus 3; P = .0068), but as a group, they did not demonstrate worse clinical outcomes (median mRS, 1 and 1; P = .39). However, 3 young patients died from intracranial venous hypertension and intracranial hemorrhage related to progression of their fistulas despite extensive endovascular, surgical, and radiosurgical treatments. CONCLUSIONS Few patients with dural arteriovenous fistulas follow an aggressive, progressive clinical course despite treatment. Younger age at initial presentation and angioarchitectural correlates to venous hypertension may help identify these patients prospectively.","Hetts, S W; Tsai, T; Cooke, D L; Amans, M R; Settecase, F; Moftakhar, P; Dowd, C F; Higashida, R T; Lawton, M T; Halbach, V V",AJNR.

METHODS Patients <18 years of age who lived on Hong Kong Island (a separate island within Hong Kong) and were admitted to either of the only 2 public hospitals on the island for a febrile acute respiratory infection on 1 fixed day of the week in each hospital from October 2003 through September 2006 were prospectively recruited. These 2 hospitals together accounted for 72.5% of all general pediatric admissions in Hong Kong Island with a known population denominator. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were obtained from all recruited patients and were tested for influenza A and influenza B viruses by direct antigen detection and culture. RESULTS All cases of influenza A during 2003-2004 were caused by H3N2 virus, whereas 85.7% of cases during 2004-2005 were due to H3N2 virus, and 93.5% during 2005-2006 were due to H1N1 virus. During 2004-2005, infants <1 year of age had the highest rate of hospitalization for influenza A (103.8 cases per 10,000 population), whereas children 1 year of age had the highest rate of hospitalization during the other 2 seasons (95.5 and 54.6 cases per 10,000 population during 2003-2004 and 2005-2006, respectively). A protection rate of 25%, presumably attributable to maternal antibodies, was seen in infants <1 year of age who were hospitalized during 2003-2004 with infection due to an H3N2 virus that had been in circulation. The hospitalization rates for influenza B were highest among children 2-4 years of age. CONCLUSIONS This population-based study of hospitalizations due to virologically confirmed influenza demonstrated a very high burden of disease among young children in Hong Kong.

The model incorporates the spread of awareness among individuals and, moreover, a small inflow of imported cases. These cases prevent stochastic extinctions when we simulate the epidemics and, hence, they allow to check whether the average dynamics for the fraction of infected individuals are accurately predicted by the ODE model. Stochastic simulations confirm the existence of sustained oscillations for different types of random networks, with a sharp transition from a nonoscillatory asymptotic regime to a periodic one as the alerting rate of susceptible individuals increases from very small values. This abrupt transition to periodic epidemics of high amplitude is quite accurately predicted by the Hopf-bifurcation curve computed from the ODE model using the alerting rate and the infection transmission rate for aware individuals as tuning parameters.","Juher, David; Rojas, David; Saldaña, Joan",Physical review.

Strategies delivered by means of information and communication technologies (ie, eHealth) can address treatment adherence through patient education, real-time monitoring of apnea symptoms and CPAP adherence in daily life, self-management, and early identification and subsequent intervention when device or treatment problems arise. However, the effectiveness of available eHealth technologies in improving CPAP adherence has not yet been systematically studied. OBJECTIVE This meta-analytic review was designed to investigate the effectiveness of a broad range of eHealth interventions in improving CPAP treatment adherence. METHODS We conducted a systematic literature search of the databases of Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, PubMed, and Embase to identify relevant randomized controlled trials in adult OSA populations. The risk of bias in included studies was examined using seven items of the Cochrane Collaboration risk-of-bias tool. The meta-analysis was conducted with comprehensive meta-analysis software that computed differences in mean postintervention adherence (MD), which was defined as the average number of nightly hours of CPAP use. RESULTS The meta-analysis ultimately included 18 studies (N=5429 adults with OSA) comprising 22 comparisons between experimental and control conditions. Postintervention data were assessed at 1 to 6 months after baseline, depending on the length of the experimental intervention. eHealth interventions increased the average nightly use of CPAP in hours as compared with care as usual (MD=0.54, 95% CI 0.29-0.79). Subgroup analyses did not reveal significant differences in effects between studies that used eHealth as an add-on or as a replacement to care as usual (P=.95), between studies that assessed stand-alone eHealth and blended strategies combining eHealth with face-to-face care (P=.23), or between studies of fully automated interventions and guided eHealth interventions (P=.83). Evidence for the long-term follow-up effectiveness of eHealth adherence interventions remains undecided owing to a scarcity of available studies and their mixed results. CONCLUSIONS eHealth interventions for adults with OSA can improve adherence to CPAP in the initial months after the start of treatment, increasing the mean nightly duration of use by about half an hour. Uncertainty still exists regarding the timing, duration, intensity, and specific types of eHealth interventions that could be most effectively implemented by health care providers.","Aardoom, Jiska Joëlle; Loheide-Niesmann, Lisa; Ossebaard, Hans C; Riper, Heleen",Journal of medical Internet research,197,8

People infected with SARS-CoV-2 can develop symptoms including cough, fever, pneumonia and other complications, which in severe cases could lead to death. In addition, a proportion of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 may be asymptomatic. At present, the primary diagnostic method for COVID-19 is reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which tests patient samples including nasopharyngeal swabs, sputum and other lower respiratory tract secretions. Other detection methods, e.g., isothermal nucleic acid amplification, CRISPR, immunochromatography, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and electrochemical sensors are also in use. As the current testing methods are mostly performed at central hospitals and third-party testing centres, the testing systems used mostly employ large, high-throughput, automated equipment. Given the current situation of the epidemic, point-of-care testing (POCT) is advantageous in terms of its ease of use, greater approachability on the user's end, more timely detection, and comparable accuracy and sensitivity, which could reduce the testing load on central hospitals. POCT is thus conducive to daily epidemic control and achieving early detection and treatment. This paper summarises the latest research advances in POCT-based SARS-CoV-2 detection methods, compares three categories of commercially available products, i.e., nucleic acid tests, immunoassays and novel sensors, and proposes the expectations for the development of POCT-based SARS-CoV-2 detection including greater accessibility, higher sensitivity and lower costs.","Song, Qi; Sun, Xindi; Dai, Ziyi; Gao, Yibo; Gong, Xiuqing; Zhou, Bingpu; Wu, Jinbo; Wen, Weijia",Lab on a chip,197,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS In this study, we retrospectively analyzed 15 small superficial subcapsular liver tumors abutting abdominal wall in 15 patients, treated with radiofrequency ablation from March 2013 to June 2015 using a cool-tip electrode manually modified to create 25-35° angle at the junction between exposed and insulated segments. The tumors were hepatocellular carcinoma (n = 13) and metastases (n = 2: cholangiocellular carcinoma and rectosigmoid cancer), with maximum diameter of 10-26 mm (mean, 15.68 ± 5.29 mm). Under ultrasonographic guidance, the electrode tip was advanced to the depth of the tumors' epicenter about 1 cm from the margin. The tip was re-directed to penetrate the tumor for radiofrequency ablation. Minimal ablation margin was measured at immediate post-treatment CT. Radiological images and medical records were evaluated for success rate, length of minimal ablation margin and complications. RESULTS Technical success rate of obtaining complete necrosis of the tumors was 100%, with no procedure-related complication. Minimal ablation margin ranged from 3-12 mm (mean, 7.07 ± 2.23 mm). CT/MRI follow-up at 21-1022 days (mean, 519.47 ± 304.51 days) revealed no local recurrence, but distant recurrence in 9 patients.

Receptor recognition is the critical determinant and preliminary phase of viral infection to enter the host cell and causes tissue tropism. We have conducted a comprehensive review of relevant publication on in vitro, in silico, in vivo and clinical evaluation of drug candidates ranging from broad-spectrum antivirals to natural molecules targeted towards viral spike protein in addition to evaluate their suitability as therapies based on an analysis of the similarities between SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2.

There is evidence that physical activity and herbal remedies can be useful. This study aimed to determine the effect of swimming training (SW) alone or combined with garlic extract on renal and hepatic cells apoptosis, as wellas on the liver and kidney function biomarkers in old rats. Methods A total of 35 old rats (aged 40-50 weeks) were randomly divided into 5 groups including control, saline (S), exercise training (ET), garlic (G) and exercise training+ garlic (ET.G) groups. Exercise was started for 5 min/day and then gradually extended to 60 min/day and the G and E+G groups received 1 mL/kg of this mixture by gavage. Twenty-four hours after completion of 8 weeks training, liver, kidney and blood samples were collected for histopathological examinations, liver and kidney functions, oxidative stress and apoptosis biomarkers. Results The tissue sections of the SW exercise, control and saline groups showed some mild histopathological changes in liver and kidney, while SW supplemented with garlic prevented these damages. The SW alone or supplemented with garlic significantly increased the Bcl-2 value and declined the BAX level in both liver and kidney (p<0.05). The activities of catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) in the liver and kidney of the control and saline groups were lower than those in E, G and G+E groups, while a significant increase for malondialdehyde (MDA) value was found in the control and saline groups. Furthermore, the E+G significantly declined the activity of hepatic (ALT, AST and ALP) and renal damage (uric acid, urea and creatinine) biomarkers compared to the control and saline groups (p<0.05). Discussion Swimming exercise supplemented with garlic extract not only improves antioxidant capacity but also declines oxidative damages and apoptosis through reducing Bax levels and enhancing Bcl-2 value.","Farzanegi, Parvin; Abbaszadeh, Hajar; Farokhi, Farzaneh; Rahmati-Ahmadabad, Saleh; Hosseini, Seyed Ali; Ahmad, Abdi; Mazandarani, Mohammad Reza; Rezaei, Iraj; Shokrie, Mohammad; Vizvari, Exir; Alinejad, Hadi; Azarbayjani, Mohammad Ali",Clinical interventions in aging,197,1

Here we report that its immediate-early protein ORF61 antagonizes the beta interferon (IFN-β) pathway. VZV infection down-modulated the Sendai virus (SeV)-activated IFN-β pathway, including mRNA of IFN-β and its downstream interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), ISG54 and ISG56. Through a primary screening of VZV genes, we found that ORF61 inhibited SeV-mediated activation of IFN-β and ISRE (IFN-stimulated response element) promoter activities but only slightly affected NF-κB promoter activity, implying that the IFN-β pathway may be blocked in the IRF3 branch. An indirect immunofluorescence assay demonstrated that ectopic expression of ORF61 abrogated the detection of IRF3 in SeV-infected cells; however, it did not affect endogenous dormant IRF3 in noninfected cells. Additionally, ORF61 was shown to be partially colocalized with activated IRF3 in the nucleus upon treatment with MG132, an inhibitor of proteasomes, and the direct interaction between ORF61 and activated IRF3 was confirmed by a coimmunoprecipitation assay. Furthermore, Western blot analysis demonstrated that activated IRF3 was ubiquitinated in the presence of ORF61, suggesting that ORF61 degraded phosphorylated IRF3 via a ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) analysis demonstrated that the level of ISG54 and ISG56 mRNAs was also downregulated by ORF61. Taken together, our results convincingly demonstrate that ORF61 down-modulates the IRF3-mediated IFN-β pathway by degradation of activated IRF3 via direct interaction, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of VZV infection.","Zhu, Huifang; Zheng, Chunfu; Xing, Junji; Wang, Shuai; Li, Shuping; Lin, Rongtuan; Mossman, Karen L",Journal of virology,197,13

Design: A cross-sectional study. Setting: COVID-19 daily case and death data from the initial case through 29 November 2020. Participants: 46 countries comprising the WHO African region. Main outcome measures: We used five pandemic response indicators for each country: speed at which the pandemic reached the country, speed at which the first 50 cases accumulated, maximum monthly attack rate, cumulative attack rate, and crude case fatality ratio (CFR). We studied the effect of 13 predictor variables on the country-level variation in them using a principal component analysis, followed by regression. Results: Countries with higher tourism activities, GDP per capita, and proportion of older people had higher monthly (p < 0.001) and cumulative attack rates (p < 0.001) and lower CFRs (p = 0.052). Countries having more stringent early COVID-19 response policies experienced greater delay in arrival of the first case (p < 0.001). The speed at which the first 50 cases occurred was slower in countries whose neighbors had higher cumulative attack rates (p = 0.06). Conclusions: While global connectivity and tourism could facilitate the spread of airborne infectious agents, the observed differences in attack rates between African countries might also be due to differences in testing capacities or age distribution. Wealthy countries managed to minimize adverse outcomes. Further, careful and early implementation of strict government policies, such as restricting tourism, could be pivotal to controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. Evidently, good quality data and sufficient testing capacities are essential to unravel the epidemiology of an outbreak. We thus urge decision-makers to reduce these barriers to ensure rapid responses to future threats to public health and economic stability.","James, A.; Dalal, J.; Kousi, T.; Vivacqua, D.; Camara, D.

The Covid-19 pandemic created a natural experiment providing an opportunity to evaluate wildlife movement during a period of greatly reduced human activity. Speculation in scientific reviews and the media suggested that wildlife might be increasing movement and colonizing urban landscapes during pandemic slowdowns. However, theory predicts that animals should move and use space as efficiently as possible, suggesting that movement might actually be reduced relative to decreased human activity. We quantified space use, movement, and resource-selection of 12 GPS-collared mountain lions (eight females, four males) occupying parklands in greater Los Angeles during the Spring 2020 California stay-at-home order when human activity was far below normal. We also tested the hypothesis that reduced traffic on Los Angeles area roadways increased permeability of these barriers to animal movement. Contrary to expectations that wildlife roamed more widely during pandemic shutdowns, resident mountain lions used smaller areas and moved shorter distances relative to their historical behaviour in greater Los Angeles. They also relaxed avoidance of anthropogenic landscape features such as trails and development, which likely facilitated increased travelling efficiency. However, there was no detectable change in road-crossing, despite reduced traffic volume. Our results support the theoretical prediction that animals maximize movement efficiency and suggest that carnivores incur energetic costs while avoiding humans. While mountain lions may restrict movement at the landscape level relative to barriers, they appear to increase distances moved at finer scales when avoiding human activity ? highlighting the scale-dependent nature of animal responses to human disturbance. Avoiding humans can reduce direct mortality of large carnivores and is often suggested to be an important mechanism promoting coexistence in shared landscapes. However, energetic costs incurred by increased movement and space-use while avoiding human activity may have important consequences for population viability, predator?prey interactions, community structure, and human?wildlife conflict. Management providing sufficient wild prey and education regarding best practices for protection of domestic animals are important for conserving large carnivores in human-dominated landscapes.","Benson, John F.; Abernathy, Heather N.; Sikich, Jeff A.; Riley, Seth P.

While China and Singapore have successfully led the effort, more and more countries are now implementing such surveillance systems, raising potential privacy concerns about this long term surveillance. For example, it is not clear what happens to the information post-pandemic because people are more likely to share their information during a global crisis without governments having to elaborate on their data policies. Digital Ethnography on Twitter, which has over 330 million users worldwide, with a majority in the United States where the pandemic has the worst effects provides a unique opportunity to learn about real-time opinions of the general public about current affairs in a rather naturalistic setting.

Consequently, we developed a custom three-stream convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that contains multiple channels to automate the diagnosis of ACL and meniscus tears from MRI scans. Our algorithm utilizes the sagittal, coronal, and axial slices to maximize feature extraction. Furthermore, we apply the Laplace Operator on the MRI scan images to evaluate and compare its propensity in different medical imaging modalities.

Requiring more stringent -- yet well-motivated -- beyond General Relativity (GR) parametrizations, substantially decreases the number of signals needed to detect a deviation from GR predictions and increases the number of GR-violating coefficients that can be constrained. To this end, we apply to LIGO-Virgo observations a high-spin version of the Parametrized ringdown spin expansion coefficients (ParSpec) formalism, encompassing large classes of modified theories of gravity. We constrain the lowest-order perturbative deviation of the fundamental ringdown frequency to be $\delta\omega^{0}_{220} = {-0.05}^{+0.05}_{-0.05}$, when assuming adimensional beyond-GR couplings, substantially improving upon previously published results. We also establish upper bounds $\ell_{p=2}<23 \, \mathrm{km}$, $\ell_{p=4}<35 \, \mathrm{km}$, $\ell_{p=6}<42 \, \mathrm{km}$ on the scale $\ell_p$ at which the appearance of new physics is disfavoured, depending on the mass dimension $p$ of the ringdown coupling. These bounds exceed the ones obtained by previous analyses or are competitive with existing ones, depending on the specific alternative theory considered, and promise to quickly improve as the number of detectors, sensitivity and duty-cycle of the gravitational-wave network steadily increases.","Carullo, Gregorio",,197,24

However, the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) is slowing current efforts and the set targets may not be achieved, yet NCDs have been associated with the risk of more severe COVID-19 disease. In the current study, we explore the early impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on a CVD prevention program in Mukono and Buikwe districts in Uganda. Methods: We collected qualitative data through interviews and mini focus group discussions (FGDs) in the months of May and June 2020. A total of 39 community health workers (CHWs) and 10 healthcare workers (HCW) participated in the study. The data were transcribed verbatim and analysed with the help of the ATLAS.ti software following a content analysis approach. Emerging themes and sub themes were generated and these exemplified with quotations from the transcripts. Results: Negative and positive impact themes were observed. The negative observations were: (1) Disruption of CVD prevention services including halting screening for CVD risk factors at the community and health facility, halting sensitisation and health promotion activities at the community;(2) Reduction in patient health seeking behaviours;(3) Acute health facility staff absenteeism (4) Disruption in reporting and referral mechanisms;and (5) Disruption in supply chain. On the other hand, two positive attributes were observed: (1) Perceived reduction in alcohol consumption;and (2) perceived reduction in crime related psychosocial stress. Conclusion: COVID-19 disrupted the implementation of CVD prevention activities in this lowincome context. Screening programs and CVD prevention activities at the community and health facility levels were literally halted mainly due to fear, the non-discriminatory lockdown measures and a lack of medicines and supplies - including personal protective equipment. There is need for a balance in measures to sustain CVDs interventions while controlling the COVID-19 pandemic.","Musinguzi, G.; Ndejjo, R.; Aerts, N.; Wanyenze, R.

Aim: Evaluate the incidence of PASC in previously hospitalised COVID-19 patients and compare the admission and follow-up levels of biochemical parameters stratified according to baseline clinical severity. Methods: N = 168 COVID-19 patients previously hospitalised at the Zan Mitrev Clinic in Skopje, North Macedonia, with matched laboratory data at baseline and follow-up clinical visit > 30 days post-discharge, were stratified according to National Institute of Health clinical severity guidelines as mild, moderate, severe or critical according to admission clinical presentation. We assessed the incidence of PASC and compared the biochemical profile. Results: The median hospitalisation and clinical follow-up period were 11 (9-20) and 53 (30-105) days. The overall incidence of PASC was 56.5% (95/168); most PASC cases were confined to the severe sub-group (61/101, 61.4%). Contrary to mild and moderate cases and a healthy non-COVID-19 control cohort, we observed that severe COVID-19 cases experienced sustained biochemical disturbances, most notably elevated D-dimers and Ferritin of 600 ng/ml (283-1168) and 432 ng/ml (170-916), respectively. Conclusions: Previously hospitalised severe COVID-19 patients are more likely to experience Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19 and prolonged biochemical disturbances, evident by abnormal values of D-dimers and Ferritin.","Simjanoska, M.; Mitrev, Z.; Villa, G.; Griffin, D.; Rosalia, R.",,197,1

We aimed to study the course of pertussis in France over an 8-year period and its association with COVID-19 mitigation strategies, using multiple nationwide data sources. Methods: We analyzed the number of French pertussis cases between 2013 and 2020, using the PCR test results from nationwide outpatient laboratories (Source 1) and the pediatric network of 41 hospitals (Source 2), and using the reports of an office-based pediatric national network (Source 3). We conducted a quasi-experimental interrupted time-series analysis, relying on negative binomial regression models. The models accounted for seasonality, longterm cycles, and secular trend, and included a binary variable for the first national lockdown (ordered on March 16, 2021). Results: We identified 19,039 cases of pertussis from the three data sources during the study period. There was a significant decrease of pertussis cases following the implementation of mitigation measures, with adjusted incidence rate ratios of 0.102 (95% CI 0.040-0.256) and 0.216 (95% CI 0.071-0.656) for Source 1 and Source 2, respectively. The association was confirmed in Source 3 (median of 1 [IQR 0-2] vs. 0 [IQR 0-0] pertussis cases per month before and after lockdown, respectively, p=0.0048). Conclusion: The drastic reduction of outpatient and hospitalized cases of pertussis strongly suggests an impact of COVID-19 mitigation measures and their consequences on pertussis epidemiology. Pertussis vaccination recommendations should be carefully followed, and disease monitoring should be continued to detect any resurgence after relaxation of mitigation measures.","Matczak, S.; Levy, C.; Fortas, C.; Cohen, J.

Nucleic acid agonists of the innate immune system can be administered to activate an effective antiviral program for prophylaxis in exposed populations, a measure of particular relevance for SARS-CoV-2 infection due to its efficient evasion of the host antiviral response. In this study, we utilized the K18-hACE2 mouse model of COVID-19 to examine whether prophylactic activation of the antiviral receptor RIG-I protects mice from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Systemic treatment of mice with a specific RIG-I ligand one to seven days prior to infection with a lethal dose of SARS-CoV-2 improved their survival of by up to 50 %. Improved survival was associated with lower viral load in oropharyngeal swabs and in the lungs and brain of RIG-I-treated mice. Moreover, despite antiviral protection, the surviving mice that were treated with RIG-I ligand developed adaptive SARS-CoV-2-specific immunity. These results reveal that prophylactic RIG-I activation by synthetic RNA oligonucleotides is a promising strategy to convey short-term, unspecific antiviral protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection and may be a suitable broad-spectrum approach to constraining the spread of newly emerging viruses until virus-specific therapies and vaccines become available.","Marx, Samira; Kümmerer, Beate M.; Grützner, Christian; Kato, Hiroki; Schlee, Martin; Bartok, Eva; Renn, Marcel; Hartmann, Gunther",bioRxiv,197,33

The monthly data of monetary and fiscal policy uncertainties, gold, silver, and S&P-500 prices from January 1987 to November 2020 are used. The empirical results reveal that the overall spillovers among the system variables are weak. Further, the cross-spillovers between precious metals and policy uncertainties are found to be lower than the cross-spillovers between equity and policy uncertainties. The decomposition of overall spillovers into various frequencies indicate that shorter followed by longer and medium time-horizons drive overall spillovers. The frequency-based results reveal that cross-spillovers between policy uncertainties and equity are mostly driven by shorter horizons. Whereas, the cross-spillovers between policy uncertainties and precious metals are driven by longer horizons. Thus, it appears that precious metals are relatively more immune to the shocks from policy uncertainties than equity markets, thereby suggesting safe investment opportunities in precious metals during economic policy uncertainties. The results are helpful for portfolio managers, institutional investors, and policymakers for the strategic allocation of their funds during monetary and fiscal policy uncertainties.","Shah, Adil Ahmad Dar Arif Billah Bhanumurthy N.

The present research examines public assessments of police responsibility and performance during the pandemic using a procedural justice paradigm. Design/methodology/approach Participants (N = 104) rated images of a police officer, including when using different items of personal protective equipment (PPE), along the core dimensions of procedural justice. Participants then completed survey questions about their assessments of the police's responsibility and performance during the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings Findings from our regression analyses indicate that participants' perceptions of procedural justice are positively related to their assessments of police responsibility and performance. Our findings also indicate that participants' perceptions of procedural justice can be affected by the police's use of different items of PPE, including face masks, face shields, goggles and medical gloves. Originality/value The present research uses procedural justice, a well-trodden paradigm from past empirical works, to examine perceptions of police amidst a time of much societal change. The findings present important practical implications for police who must continue to manage public perceptions while providing service during the pandemic.","Sandrin, R.; Simpson, R.",Policing-an International Journal of Police Strategies &amp; Management,197,20

Between March and May 2020, government restrictions led to cancellation of routine outpatient appointments to limit viral spread and optimize resources. Objectives: This study assesses patient satisfaction of follow-up telemedicine appointments among patients known to be in disease remission, attending either secondary or tertiary care Rheumatology clinics. Appointments were conducted either by a rheumatologist or a qualified medical assistant for rheumatology (RFA). Additional data regarding perceived concerns arising from the COVID-19 pandemic as well as attitudes to vaccination were collected. Methods: Methods: Patients not requiring adjustment of their DMARDs at the two previous attendances were considered stable. At cancellation of the planned attendance, patients were offered participation in the study and provided verbal informed consent. Participants were randomized to a telemedicine appointment by either a physician or RFA. Telemedicine appointments consisted of a standardized patient interview, including assessment of disease activity (modified CDAI score), attitudes to vaccination as well as current vaccine status and concerns about COVID-19. Following participation, all patients received a pseudonymized postal questionnaire to evaluate appointment satisfaction (FAPI-Score). Results: In total 112/116 (96%) patients that were offered appointments, participated in the study (RA 50%, axSpA 30%, PsA 20%). Of these 88/112 (79%) returned their postal questionnaires. Overall patient satisfaction was excellent (mean 4.3/5 modified FAPI score) and did not differ between care setting or clinical status of the interviewer. RFAs conducted 19/112 (17%) of appointments, 6 (32%) of which required additional physician intervention. Change of DMARDs occurred in 19/112 (17%) appointments. Patients reporting a pain score ≥7 (VAS 1-10) were most dissatisfied with the telemedicine appointment (p=0.036). Concerns about COVID-19 correlated with disease activity: high disease activity (p = 0.031), presence of tender joints (p=0.001), high pain levels (p=0.009) correlated with concern of contracting COVID-19 or experiencing severe disease course. Only 38% of the patients had been vaccinated against pneumococci in the past 5 years and 54% had been vaccinated against influenza in 2019/2020. Conclusion: Telemedicine can contribute to patient care in stable patients. RFAs can also contribute to patient care especially for follow-up appointment when patients are in remission. Vaccination rates and motivation needs to be improved as influenza and pneumococcal vaccination is recommended to all patients with rheumatic diseases without contraindications.","Thiele, T.; Beider, S.; Kühl, H.; Miehlke, G.; Cossmann, A.; Holz, A.; Happle, C.; Hoeper, K.; Witte, T.; Jabonka, A.; Ernst, D.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,197,1

Recently, low levels of vitamin D have also been associated with higher risks for contracting COVID-19. South Asians in the UK have higher risk for low vitamin D levels. In this study, we assessed vitamin D status of British-Bangladeshi migrants compared to white British residents and Bangladeshis still living in Bangladesh ('sedentees'). Methodology: The cross-sectional study compared vitamin D levels among 149 women aged 35-59, comprising British-Bangladeshi migrants (n=50), white UK neighbors (n=54) and Bangladeshi sedentees (n=45). Analyses comprised multivariate models to assess serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), and associations with anthropometric, lifestyle, health and migration factors. Results: Vitamin D levels in Bangladeshi migrants were very low: mean 25(OH)D = 32.2nmol/L +/- 13.0, with 29% of migrants classified as deficient (<25nmol/L) and 94% deficient or insufficient ([≤]50nmol/L). Mean levels of vitamin D were significantly lower among British-Bangladeshis compared to Bangladeshi sedentees (50.9nmol/L +/- 13.3), presumably due to less exposure to sunlight following migration; levels were also lower than in white British women (55.3nmol/L +/- 20.9). Lower levels of vitamin D were associated with increased body mass index and low iron status. Conclusions and implications: Recommending supplements to Bangladeshi migrants could prevent potentially adverse health outcomes associated with vitamin D deficiency.","Smith, N.; Sievert, L.; Muttukrishna, S.; Begum, K.; Murphy, L.; Sharmeen, T.; Gunu, R.; Chowdhury, O.; Bentley, G.

Longitudinal monitoring of both populations revealed the progression of disease symptoms compatible with advanced leprosy. Screening of faecal and necropsy samples confirmed the presence of M. leprae as the causative agent at each site and phylogenomic comparisons with other strains from humans and other animals show that the chimpanzee strains belong to different and rare genotypes (4N/O and 2F). The independent evolutionary origin of M. leprae in two geographically distant populations of wild chimpanzees, with no prolonged direct contact with humans, suggests multiple introductions of M. leprae from an unknown animal or environmental source.","Hockings, Kimberley J.; Mubemba, Benjamin; Avanzi, Charlotte; Pleh, Kamilla; Düx, Ariane; Bersacola, Elena; Bessa, Joana; Ramon, Marina; Metzger, Sonja; Patrono, Livia V.; Jaffe, Jenny E.; Benjak, Andrej; Bonneaud, Camille; Busso, Philippe; Couacy-Hymann, Emmanuel; Gado, Moussa; Gagneux, Sebastien; Johnson, Roch C.; Kodio, Mamoudou; Lynton-Jenkins, Joshua; Morozova, Irina; Mätz-Rensing, Kerstin; Regalla, Aissa; Said, Abílio R.; Schuenemann, Verena J.; Sow, Samba O.; Spencer, John S.; Ulrich, Markus; Zoubi, Hyacinthe; Cole, Stewart T.; Wittig, Roman M.; Calvignac-Spencer, Sebastien; Leendertz, Fabian H.",bioRxiv,197,1

We developed a fast (2-3 min), easy-to-use, low-cost, and quantitative electrochemical biosensor based on carbon nanotube field-effect transistor (CNT-FET) that allows digital detection of the SARS-CoV-2 S1 in fortifited saliva samples for quick and accurate detection of SARS-CoV-2 S1 antigens. The biosensor was developed on a Si/SiO2 surface by CNT printing with the immobilization of a anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1. SARS-CoV-2 S1 antibody was immobilized on the CNT surface between the S-D channel area using a linker 1-pyrenebutanoic acid succinimidyl ester (PBASE) through non-covalent interaction. A commercial SARS-CoV-2 S1 antigen was used to characterize the electrical output of the CNT-FET biosensor. The SARS-CoV-2 S1 antigen in the 10 mM AA buffer pH 6.0 was effectively detected by the CNT-FET biosensor at concentrations from 0.1 fg/mL to 5.0 pg/mL. The limit of detection (LOD) of the developed CNT-FET biosensor was 4.12 fg/mL. The selectivity test was performed by using target SARS-CoV-2 S1 and non-target SARS-CoV-1 S1 and MERS-CoV S1 antigens in the 10 mM AA buffer pH 6.0. The biosensor showed high selectivity (no response to SARS-CoV-1 S1 or MERS-CoV S1 antigen) with SARS-CoV-2 S1 antigen detection in the 10 mM AA buffer pH 6.0. The biosensor is highly sensitive, saves time, and could be a helpful platform for rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 S1 antigen from the patients saliva.","Zamzami, Mazin A.; Rabbani, Gulam; Ahmad, Abrar; Basalah, Ahmad A.; Al-Sabban, Wesam H.; Nate Ahn, Saeyoung; Choudhry, Hani",,197,15

PROMs may complement oncological evaluations by adding patients' perspectives on their care priorities. Aim: to address more accurately the management of tumor related symptoms or drug related toxicities to bring he therapies more accurately to bring patients the best quality of life diarrhea, dyspnea, vomiting and nausea. These symptoms were graded according to their severity using the Common Toxicity Criteria v5.0. Results: 49 patients admitted to Medical Oncology Hospitalization were included from July of 2020 to January 2021, 80% in advanced disease. Median age 63yo, 32% above 70 yo. Baseline data showed that 27% patients (19% stage IV) had fever at admission, decreasing at 48h to 4%. Patients who had vomiting at admission were 33% (28% stage IV) median grade 2 becoming 20% and grade 1 at 48h. Nausea was present in 49% patients (35% stage IV) at the time of admission with a median grade 1.5, and it decreased to 16% at 48h with a median grade 2. Diarrhea was reported in 12% patients (6% stage IV) median grade 2 at baseline and it was reduced to 10% median grade 1 at 48h. The median severity of diarrhea at admission was 2 and only 1 at 48h. At admission, 33% (all stage IV) of patients presented dyspnea with a median grade 3, while at 48h it was present in 26% of patients and reduced to median grade 2. Conclusions: By systematically measuring symptoms, patients achieved better control of diarrhea, dyspnea, vomiting and nausea after admission. It should be noted that nausea was the variable that decreased the most at 48h, followed by fever, vomiting, dyspnea and diarrhea. All patients with stage IV disease had dyspnea and most of them had nausea and vomiting. These results reflect that these symptoms are more usual in patients with advanced disease compared to those with localized disease. PROMS also help us educate patients by teaching them how to manage treatments, thus improving therapeutic adherence.","Durantez, V. V.; González, A. R.; Solis-Hernandez, M. P.; Gomez, C.

This new vision was developed during the period of online education in 2020-2021. The research shows relevance in the framework of developing high efficiency of professionally-oriented language education. Blended learning is an educational technology that has been theoretically developed in various countries over the past decades. Blended learning was and still is mostly understood as a combination of offline and online education as delivery methods;at present, such training involves a flexible combination of formats, in different proportions. The aim of the rese4arch is combining different types of delivery methods, pedagogical strategies, and tactics according to the needs of a particular student or a group of students. In Moscow Aviation Institute (National Research University), we provide teaching of both foreign and native professionally-oriented languages. In the situation of the COVID-19 Pandemic, we started to use new approaches to education. One of the ideas was to use a blended learning technique mixing two language disciplines. This approach turned out to improve the efficiency of the teaching process in unprecedented conditions due to the inclusion of all the skills and systems of languages. We developed general speech culture, intuitive linguistic flair, enlarged students' active vocabulary, improved soft skills (flexible skills) of a non-linguistic type, which include critical thinking, teamwork, and creativity.

These sudden changes often lead to an elevation of stress and anxiety, affecting a student's mental health and well-being and academic progress. With the outbreak of a pandemic, such as COVID-19, this transition moment can worsen with frequent, long-lasting lockdown and associated academic disruption. To help this young population, researchers are increasingly relying on smartphones and wearables, such as smartwatches, to continuously monitor students' daily lives to identify various factors that can affect students' phone call patterns associated with their health and well-being and academic success. In this work, we use different visualizations and statistical techniques to find various geographical places and temporal factors that affect students' phone call patterns (in terms of phone call duration and frequency) to foster the design and delivery of future smartphone-based health interventions using predictive models;thereby, potentially helping students adjust to college life with or without the presence of an emergency, such as pandemic that adversely impacts academic calendar and student life. From our detailed analysis of an 18-month dataset collected from a cohort of 464 freshmen, we obtain insights on communication pattern variations during different temporal contexts, e.g., epochs of a day, days of a week, the parts of a semester, social events, and in various geographical contexts (i.e., places of interest). Finally, we also obtain a negative correlation of-0.29 between physical activity and phone call duration, which can help provide guided feedback to improve future health behaviors. © 2013 IEEE.","Vhaduri, S.; Dibbo, S.

The data were collected from 1039 university students in Sri Lanka. To examine the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic, which was viewed through the lens of precipitating events, on the intention–behaviour relationship, we employed the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) with the inclusion of a moderating variable. While the findings indicated that the COVID-19 pandemic had clearly increased the usage of e-learning, we found no evidence to establish a moderating impact on the intention–behaviour relationship. The empirical model, however, was well fitted to the data, and the key components of the TAM were likewise adequately described by the relevant predictors. Furthermore, attitudes toward e-learning and perceived ease of use emerged as the most important factors in explaining behavioural intention, whereas relevance and experience were shown to be more significant in relation to perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. Our work is significant because it adds to the existing empirical evidence on e-learning and supports the relevance of TAM in understanding the usage of e-learning even in extreme situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Our research has significant implications for educators and other higher education authorities.","Weerathunga, Prageeth Roshan Samarathunga W. H. M. S.; Rathnayake, H. N.; Agampodi, S.

We aimed to estimate the impact and health system cost of implementing post-exposure prophylaxis against household exposure to COVID-19 with monoclonal antibodies. Methods: We developed a decision-analytical model analysis of results from a recent randomized controlled trial with complementary data on household demographic structure, vaccine coverage, and COVID-19 confirmed case counts for the representative month of May, 2021. The model population includes individuals of all ages in the United States by sex and race/ethnicity. Results: In a month of similar intensity to May, 2021, in the USA, a monoclonal antibody post-exposure prophylaxis program reaching 50% of exposed unvaccinated household members aged 50+, would avert 1,813 (1,171 - 2,456) symptomatic infections, 526 (343 - 716) hospitalizations, and 83 (56 - 116) deaths. Assuming the unit cost of administering the intervention was US$ 1,264, this program would save the health system US$ 3,055,202 (-14,034,632 - 18,787,692).

Because GSK983 is an ineffective antiviral in the presence of physiological uridine concentrations, we explored combining GSK983 with pyrimidine salvage inhibitors. We synthesized and evaluated analogs of cyclopentenyl uracil (CPU), an inhibitor of uridine salvage. We found that CPU was efficiently converted into its triphosphates in cells. When combined with GSK983, it led to large drops in cellular UTP and CTP pools. Consequently, CPU-GSK983 suppressed dengue virus replication in the presence of physiological concentrations of uridine.

These models describe the temporal progression of case counts related to an epidemic and evaluate hypotheses about the possible underlying mechanisms that explain patterns in the observed data, with distinct spatial and temporal scales. Furthermore, the models can vary in complexity, whether in terms of the number of parameters or the number of variables that characterize epidemiological states. Therefore, this approach is essential to select adequate models that characterize better transmission dynamics. This generates reliable estimates of the main parameters, which is a critical factor in minimizing uncertainty. This study aims to apply the main epidemiological compartmental models to the initial data of Covid-19 in the city of Parauapebas / PA - Brazil. A model selection criterion is proposed that, in addition to taking into account the quality of fit, mechanisms are added that capture information about past forecasts.

A knowledge gap was identified within the current practice relating to learning opportunities for built environment (BE) students in HE. The study focussed on the themes under section two of the national student survey (NSS): how students explore ideas or concepts in-depth, bring information and ideas together from different topics and apply the learned content in a real-life context. The study aimed to provide recommendations for enhancing ""learning opportunities"" to the BE students within HE. Design/methodology/approach Data collection focussed on section two of NSS ""learning opportunities"" and documentary analysis, and a qualitative survey were adopted for this study. A documental analysis of 334 mid-module reviews was carried out. The qualitative data was collected from level three to level six students and academics from architecture, construction management, civil engineering and quantity surveying disciplines representing BE context. A sample of 40 students and 15 academics, including a Head of school, a Principal lecturer, Subject leads and lecturers, participated in interviews as part of a qualitative survey. In total, 12 drivers were developed using the data obtained through literature, documental analysis and interviews. These drivers were analysed using manual content analysis to identify their influence on the specified themes under NSS section two and circulated amongst academics to be ranked by identifying its influence to promote learning opportunities to BE students in HE. Findings This study highlighted 12 drivers which promote learning opportunities in HE within BE curriculum. Findings established that topics should be explained with more real-life or industry-orientated concepts such as simplification integrated into module delivery. Contrary to the literature, the use of physical materials (i.e. handouts and whiteboard) in addition to a virtual learning environment for detailed explanations were considered effective in exploring concepts. During the current COVID-19 pandemic, context-based learning needs to be promoted by integrating videos of practical implementation for better understanding.

We introduce a algorithm that uses the differential evolution algorithm in combination with Adam?Bashforth?Moulton method to learn the parameters in a system of variable-order fractional SIR model. The model can predict the confirm COVID-19 cases in India considering the effects of nationwide lockdown and the possible estimate of the number of infliction inactive cases after the removal of lockdown on June 1, 2020. A new parameter p is introduced in the classical SIR model representing the fraction of infected people that get tested and are thereby quarantined. The COVID-19 trajectory in Delhi, as per our model, predicts the slowing down of the spread between January and February 2021, touching a peak of around 5 lakh confirmed cases.","Singh, Abhishek Kumar Mehra Mani Gulyani Samarth",Mathematical Methods in the Applied Sciences,197,2

The social isolation that emerged with the Covid-19 pandemic is an important obstacle to the social life of modern people and the sustainability of the entertainment industry. However, in line with the need for socialization, people create their own online social activities by overcoming these obstacles with the communication technologies of the age. This new sector, which emerged at a time of global crisis, allows the formation of new economic capital of digitalization. Within the scope of the study, the adaptation of the entertainment sector, which experienced a shrinkage in its economic volume during the pandemic, to the digital world as a way of salvation is examined. Various online activities carried out in line with this review have been examined in detail, and the future of the sector is discussed with the findings obtained.","Bilici, Seray Yildirim Arif",Kafkas University.

Studies show cooking-related programs combined with nutrition education have the potential to improve children's diet quality and are associated with more positive food choices. Students in SNAP-Ed eligible schools. The University of Arkansas, Division of Agriculture, Cooperative Extension Service, SNAP-Ed Program conducted a virtual cooking school to reach SNAP-Ed youth during the COVID-19 pandemic. The iCooks cooking school was offered to students in the Lonoke School Systems, and 11 families with a combined total of 24 youth in grades 3-12 participated in the program. The iCooks cooking school consisted of 5 lessons delivered weekly. Each lesson included a demonstration video of the recipe, instruction, healthy eating and food safety information. Ingredients to prepare the recipes at home were provided to participants. The lessons also included a physical activity component and an eating together as a family activity. A private Facebook group was created for participants to post pictures of themselves cooking, comment on recipes, and share what they learned. A pre/post survey for students was used to evaluate knowledge gained and changes in eating habits. Parents were surveyed to assess the effectiveness of the program. One hundred percent of participants increased knowledge about how to prepare healthy foods;100% indicated they could now make food safely to avoid foodborne illness;84% were willing to try food in new and interesting ways;89% were willing to taste new foods they had not tried before;89% indicated they paid more attention to how many fruits and vegetables they ate daily;and 100% indicated they learned the importance of healthy eating habits. iCooks, a virtual cooking school and nutrition education program, has been successful in increasing students' knowledge of healthy meal preparation, improving food safety skills, and increasing awareness of their daily fruit and vegetable intake.

The two events are named GW200105_162426 and GW200115_042309, abbreviated as GW200105 and GW200115; the first was observed by LIGO Livingston and Virgo, and the second by all three LIGO-Virgo detectors. The source of GW200105 has component masses $8.9^{+1.2}_{-1.5}\,M_\odot$ and $1.9^{+0.3}_{-0.2}\,M_\odot$, whereas the source of GW200115 has component masses $5.7^{+1.8}_{-2.1}\,M_\odot$ and $1.5^{+0.7}_{-0.3}\,M_\odot$ (all measurements quoted at the 90% credible level). The probability that the secondary's mass is below the maximal mass of a neutron star is 89%-96% and 87%-98%, respectively, for GW200105 and GW200115, with the ranges arising from different astrophysical assumptions. The source luminosity distances are $280^{+110}_{-110}$ Mpc and $300^{+150}_{-100}$ Mpc, respectively. The magnitude of the primary spin of GW200105 is less than 0.23 at the 90% credible level, and its orientation is unconstrained. For GW200115, the primary spin has a negative spin projection onto the orbital angular momentum at 88% probability. We are unable to constrain spin or tidal deformation of the secondary component for either event. We infer a NSBH merger rate density of $45^{+75}_{-33}\,\mathrm{Gpc}^{-3} \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ when assuming GW200105 and GW200115 are representative of the NSBH population, or $130^{+112}_{-69}\,\mathrm{Gpc}^{-3} \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ under the assumption of a broader distribution of component masses.","Collaboration, The LIGO Scientific; Collaboration, the Virgo; Abbott, the KAGRA Collaboration R.; Abbott, T.

We describe a high-dimensional, tetramer-associated T cell receptor sequencing (TetTCR-SeqHD) method to simultaneously profile TCR sequences, cognate antigen specificities, targeted gene-expression, and surface-protein expression from tens of thousands of single cells. Using polyclonal CD8+ T cells with known antigen specificity and TCR sequences, we demonstrated over 98% precision for detecting the correct antigen specificity. We also evaluated gene-expression and phenotypic differences among antigen-specific CD8+ T cells and characterized phenotype signatures of influenza- and EBV-specific CD8+ T cells that are unique to their pathogen targets. Moreover, with the high-throughput capacity of profiling hundreds of antigens simultaneously, we applied TetTCR-SeqHD to identify antigens that preferentially enrich cognate CD8+ T cells in type 1 diabetes patients compared to healthy controls, and discovered a TCR that cross reacts between diabetic and microbiome antigens. TetTCR-SeqHD is a powerful approach for profiling T cell responses.","Ma, Ke-Yue; Schonnesen, Alexandra A.; He, Chenfeng; Xia, Amanda Y.; Sun, Eric; Chen, Eunise; Sebastian, Katherine R; Balderas, Robert; Kulkarni-Date, Mrinalini; Jiang, Ning",bioRxiv,197,16

In Bangladesh, various natural hazards, food insecurity, low-investment, and policy priorities in rural areas have played a major role in mass-scale rural-urban migration. COVID-19 has brought a new reality. Despite an initial effort, the state is not in a position to provide food and other resources to its citizens for the duration of the pandemic. An increased rate of employment loss and decreased salary, along with poor-management of government response and emergency assistance to the people who are in need have complicated the overall scenario. All of these factors have contributed to the situation of deurbanization. During the COVID-19 pandemic, thousands of low-income people have left this megacity, where they once came to pursue their dreams, and returned to their home villages. Even though going back to rural origins is not a defeat for all, overall prospects are not very promising in their villages, either. Many of these people might experience long-term poverty traps, with no adequate employment or livelihood opportunities. Some see this ""deurbanization""as an opportunity to ease Dhaka's population strain;however, the deurbanization process might create a deep scar in the post-COVID economy, including the nation's capacity to achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDGs) by 2030. Using the core arguments of resilience, this article provides critical insight on the management of urban complexity and social disruptions in post-pandemic Dhaka. Even though this article has a geographical focus, it has broader policy relevance to other cities in the Global South that are facing similar challenges.

Whilst the move is on to usher into the world of automation, where even the manufacturing units are devising the methods to automate their functions, it is only ironic to note that people have also developed several myths on using a robot. For one, robots have been associated with a device that would take away one job. For another, a robot is considered risky as if it will start ruling the very person that made it. Apparently, a research gap exists that needs to be plugged along with the understanding gaps to demystify the use of robots. COVID-19 has brought the world to such a stage where companies are now rethinking about the use of robots. This paper is written to explain the use of robots, clarify the need of robots in the society and present the growing demand of this technology. A research was also conducted to present the availability and state-of-art robot technology.

In Indonesia, some coal-fired power plants have been put in reserve shutdown. Plant's competitiveness can be improved with lowering the production cost. This can be done with reducing the purchasing expenses by using cheaper lower rank coal (LRC) at different heating values. In this study, investigation is conducted to identify the operation and maintenance effects when using LRC, especially related to the plant safety and reliability, on the existing coal power plants. It is found that burning very low coal heating value, some components facilities need to increase their load until greater than its rated capacity in order to keep the maximum rated output capacity from the plants. Other effects of increased coal load are reduced boiler combustion efficiency, decreased mill temperature and increased secondary superheater temperature. These effects will lead to potential boiler failure due to the risks of increased local hotspot and erosion of the tubes. In this study, the validation method during combustion is presented to avoid these problems. This paper reported a successful study of burning a lower coal heating value of 4600 kCal/kg (ar), on 'Plant S' with 3400 MW installed capacity. More than IDR 1.5 B have been saved by replacing the original coal of typical 5000 kcal/kg (ar) with LRC, equivalent to around 1.8 TWh power generation, during June 2020. The success of this coal switching operation can be applied in other coal-fired power plants in Java-Bali grid, to obtain a better electricity production cost. Further longer period investigation is being carried out to minimize negative impact and avoiding failure during continuous operation of LRC.","Triyono, S.; Suprianto, E.; Ieee,","2021 11th International Conference on Power, Energy and Electrical Engineering",197,1

The study was conducted to assess the awareness and willingness to accept the COVID19 vaccine in a rural population. Method: A descriptive cross-sectional study in the rural area near Bangalore was conducted in January 2021. A total of 846 adult subjects were enrolled. Subjects were interviewed using a semi structured questionnaire about COVID 19 vaccine and willingness to get vaccinated. Results: Of 846 participants, minimum age of the respondent was 18 years and maximum was 90 years. 689 (81.4%) were literates and 157(18.6%) illiterates. Awareness about COVID 19 disease was 838 (99.1%). 710(83.9%) subjects were aware about vaccine. A total of 545(64.4%) were willing to take the vaccine and 50% informed will take the vaccine to prevent infection. Maximum fear was associated with side effects among 66.1% of the population. 37.1% would not like to vaccinate the family members mostly children and elderly. Conclusion: Awareness about COVID 19 vaccine was seen in more than two third of the subjects. How-ever, vaccine acceptance was about 60% in the rural area.

This crisis has revealed a discrepancy between the needs expressed by the community and the solutions adopted to satisfy them. This has been accompanied by a progressive worsening of decision-making efficiency and weak implementation capacity in a context of increasing environmental uncertainty. It is in local institutions, in particular, that the greatest problems are revealed, because of many endemic negative factors: political fragmentation, reduced economic resources, new forms of poverty. Against the background of this scenario, our study aims to analyze the reaction of local institutions to the pandemic crisis by looking at both welfare and communication services. The objective is to identify key features in understanding the resilience of municipalities. In other words, their ability to react and adapt to change, which is essential not only to deal with emergencies, such as the pandemic, but also to make the institution itself sustainable. Our interest is focused on a specific dimension of the resilience of the municipalities, related to collaboration with the third sector. The pandemic has shown that the continuous activism of non-profit organizations has allowed for the continuation of many so-called ""ordinary"" services, as well as the launch of several initiatives aimed at alleviating other social problems. The research has, first of all, an exploratory character that befits a new and still ongoing phenomenon. The basic questions concern the production of local welfare policies by municipalities. The data show different levels of ""interventism"" and different modes of communication. On this latter point, we observe the presence of significant attention-seeking among Mayors as community builders able, on the one hand, to reinforce the spirit of solidarity and, on the other, to uphold respect for the rules. On the services side, three main models of response to the pandemic emerge, two of which refer to the public-private relationship in local welfare policies. Findings suggest that these different reactions will have consequences in the immediate future for the management of the pandemic crisis (still ongoing). Specifically, the tendency is to employ a management of services based on partnership-model, which means that public-private collaboration is a pillar of local welfare. This seems to entail a greater legitimacy for individuals or associations to participate in the formulation and implementation of policies.","Sampugnaro, R.; Santoro, P.",Partecipazione E Conflitto,197,20

Consequently, some individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection may also present the symptoms of neuropsychological disorders. The goals of this literature review is the synthesis of various perspectives and up-to-date scientific knowledge as well as the formulation of initial recommendations for clinical practice. Views: According to current state of knowledge, numerous SARS-CoV-2 infection-specific and nonspecific risk factors exist for brain damage, which might lead to neuropsychological impairments in individuals who have recovered from COVID-19. The emerging evidence suggests significant behavioral and cognitive deficits in COVID-19 survivors, which are present in the early phase after recovery and persist for several months. Neuropsychological disturbances can potentially include a wide spectrum of disorders, yet deficits of attention, memory, executive functions, language and visuospatial orientation are among most commonly identified. The relationship between cognitive impairment, emotional disturbances and severity of COVID-19 symptoms needs to be submitted to further research. Conclusions: The scientific knowledge resulting from neuropsychological empirical studies during the COVID-19 pandemic allows for a postulate of an urgent evidence-based systematic neuropsychological research to be conducted among COVID-19 survivors. More than anything, the recovered individuals must be provided with adequate neuropsychological help in the form of neuropsychological diagnosis, monitoring and rehabilitation.","Lojek, E.; Egbert, A.

This apparent contradiction may be explained by interactions of SARS-CoV-2 and pneumococcus in the upper airway, resulting in the escape of SARS-CoV-2 from protective host immune responses. Here, we investigated the relationship of these two respiratory pathogens in two distinct cohorts of a) healthcare workers with asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection identified by systematic screening and b) patients with moderate to severe disease who presented to hospital. We assessed the effect of co-infection on host antibody, cellular and inflammatory responses to the virus. In both cohorts, pneumococcal colonisation was associated with diminished anti-viral immune responses, which affected primarily mucosal IgA levels among individuals with mild or asymptomatic infection and cellular memory responses in infected patients. Our findings suggest that S. pneumoniae modulates host immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and raises the question if pneumococcal carriage also enables immune escape of other respiratory viruses through a similar mechanism and facilitates reinfection occurrence.","Mitsi, E.; Reine, J.; Urban, B.

The primary objective of this study was to describe the volume of mental health ED visits at a single ED during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to previous years. Methods: This was a single-center, retrospective chart review of adult patients evaluated in the ED at an academic military medical facility from March-December of 2017-2020 for mental health. The electronic medical record was queried for 1,542 mental health ICD-10 diagnosis codes. Demographic data including age, sex, disposition, diagnosis, and beneficiary status were collected. Tests of association included Pearson Chi-square with Bonferroni correction for post-hoc tests and one-way ANOVA. Results: There were a total of 1,486 mental health ED visits from March-December 2020, compared to an average of 1,668 visits from March-December 2017-2019. Statistically significant (p<0.05) differences, between 2020 and the prior three years combined, were identified in the categories of age, disposition, beneficiary status, and diagnosis. In 2020, there was a lower proportion of visits for patients aged ≥ 60 (1.2%) than in 2017-2019 (2.5%). Active duty patients comprised a lower proportion in 2020 (17.6%) versus 2017-2019 (23.0%). Proportionately fewer patients were admitted in 2020 (25.2%) versus 2017-2019 (29.2%). Adjustment disorders made up 19.0% of visits in 2020 versus 23.2% in 2017-2019 and suicidal ideation and intentional self-inflicted injury comprised 43.3% in 2020 compared with 40.4% in 2017-2019. Conclusion: There was a significant decline in ED visits for patients over the age of 60 and for active duty military patients. Overall, fewer patients were admitted compared to previous years. There was a significant increase in patients diagnosed with suicidal ideation and intentional self-inflicted injury in 2020 compared to previous years. The COVID-19 pandemic and associated quarantines have negatively affected mental health worldwide. Active duty military and elderly patients were uniquely impacted. Both groups have been subject to highly restrictive limitations during the pandemic. Alarmingly, this study shows increased rates of self-harm and suicidal ideation, yet a lower likelihood of these populations to present to the ED for mental health care. Further study is needed to determine why these effects were seen, and if there is a higher risk for suicide attempt or completion in these populations. [Formula presented]","Wojahn, A.

Businesses particularly small ones do not work in isolation but instead are embedded in an entrepreneurial ecosystem that is dependent on environmental conditions. The disruptive changes from COVID-19 have caused serious damage to the global economy, so it is up to entrepreneurs to bring equilibrium by introducing change. This paper adopts the lens of dynamic capabilities to study how small business entrepreneurs are trying to survive and grow in an entrepreneurial ecosystem affected by coronavirus.Design/methodology/approachUsing qualitative research methods, 20 Pakistani entrepreneurs have been interviewed in order to assess how the entrepreneurial ecosystem in an emerging economy has been affected by COVID-19. This enables a contemporary and realistic understanding about the way small business entrepreneurs have adjusted to a crisis.FindingsFrom the data analysis, the three main dimensions of dynamic capabilities for small business entrepreneurs emerge, which involve a sensing, seizing and transforming capability.Research limitations/implicationsThe findings suggest that small businesses utilise the following strategies to cope with change: emergent humanitarian crisis, carte blanche agile business models and effectual business functions. These findings contribute to the literature about the challenges of current crises and how businesses can cope in this situation using a dynamic capabilities perspective.Practical implicationsThe findings contribute to the ability of small businesses to cope during the current pandemic situations and anticipate how to manage future crises. Furthermore, the entrepreneurial practices exercised by small businesses are also presented that represent an innovative way to understand crisis management techniques by entrepreneurs in emerging economies.Social implicationsThese findings contribute to the literature about the challenges of current crises and how businesses can cope in this situation using a dynamic capabilities perspective.Originality/valueBy drawing on the existing literature of COVID-19's impact on businesses, the theoretical contribution of this paper highlights the applicability of dynamic capabilities on small businesses to survive during the global crisis.","Rashid, Sumayya Ratten Vanessa","World Journal of Entrepreneurship, Management and Sustainable Development",197,16

The 2018 European Recommendation describes it as being resilient, reflecting upon oneself, working with others, and managing time, information, learning and career. Adaptive, socio-emotional and metacognitive competences can be essential to harness other competences and navigate an unpredictable world, as argued in the LifeComp European framework. To nurture this key competence, teachers have to develop it themselves throughout the career. Innovative professional development can be a catalyst, addressing the complex and situated nature of teacher learning. It entails re-thinking time, space and mode of delivery, embedding active learning, relevance to practice, collaboration, coaching, feedback, and reflection. Innovative examples are presented as reciprocally related to Personal, Social and Learning to Learn, for resilient education systems in the wake of the COVID 19 pandemic.

This distanced education seeks to achieve learning goals mediated by technology as they would be achieved in the face-to-face classroom, without ignoring the psychological and social impact that COVID-19 has had on students and teachers. Faced with this situation, the use of online educational escape rooms has been proposed as a motivating strategy for students to review curriculum content in a cooperative and fun way. A qualitative investigation was carried out to explore the perceptions of university students in the Social Education degree program after the implementation of an educational escape room. Our main findings are that most students found that it allowed them to interact with their peers beyond traditional education, that it was useful for their learning and that it was a pleasant activity. However, it was also mentioned that it can be a stressful activity as being an online activity, some students may have connectivity problems. It is concluded that online escape rooms can be active and effective learning strategies for university students.","Manzano-León, Ana Aguilar-Parra José Manuel Rodríguez-Ferrer José M.; Trigueros, Rubén Collado-Soler Rocío Méndez-Aguado Cristina García-Hernández María Jesús Molina-Alonso Laura",Education Sciences,197,0

An electronic search of the literature on VTE in COVID patients with reference to prevalence and prophylaxis was made using PubMed as the main search engine. A snowball search was followed to retrieve additional relevant data. The database consisted of prospective and retrospective studies and systematic reviews. The results showed that the reported incidence of VTE varies from &lt;10% to more than 60%. Majority of studies reported a higher incidence of VTE in critically ill COVID 19 patients. Few authors, therefore, suggested a higher dose of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), but this approach has not been validated. There is also a suggestion to extend the prophylaxis postdischarge. There are also reports of thromboprophylaxis with LMWH improves outcome in critically ill patients. This review confirms the generally held view that the incidence of VTE is higher in COVID 19 patients who are critically ill. However, whether they will benefit from a higher or intensified dose of Heparin is not fully assessed, with opinion equally divided among researchers there are few other grey areas like prophylaxis post discharge and in ambulatory patients.","Rao, U.

Since personal nonpharmaceutical interventions can be effective for an individual’s health and psychological resilience during a pandemic, understanding tourists’ biosecurity behavior is essential given the broader relationship with traveling during COVID-19. However, existing research has not explicitly examined this relationship during any pandemic, nor has it explored potential long-term implications. To fill this gap, this study built and tested a theoretically comprehensive framework including prosocial behavior, ethics, perception, intervention, resilience, biosecurity behavior, and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) due to COVID-19. Results reveal that prosocial behavior and perception have significant impacts on intervention, which influences resilience and biosecurity behavior. Resilience has an effect on biosecurity behavior. Three SDG groups have different effects on the relationship between intervention and biosecurity behavior. Deep learning sheds light on tourist’s biosecurity practices during COVID-19 and when international travel resumes.

With increased telehealth consultations during the COVID-19 pandemic, remote monitoring of lung function is encouraged at cystic fibrosis (CF) centres. We aimed to evaluate the quality of spirometry performance by adult CF patients with and without observation by a trained respiratory scientist. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted between February-September 2020. 74 adults from the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital Adult CF clinic were recruited and instructed to perform spirometry without supervision within 24 hours of their remote CF clinic consultation. Spirometry was repeated at their consultation, supervised by a respiratory scientist using video conferencing. The same portable spirometer was used during both encounters. Spirometry grade was recorded from their portable devices and severity of obstruction (mild: FEV1 >80%, moderate: FEV1 50–80%, severe: FEV1 <50%) was obtained from their supervised encounter. Results: 15, 30 and 29 participants with mild, moderate and severe obstruction respectively participated in the study (total n = 74, mean age 37 ± 11 years, 50% female). The majority of patients achieved ATS/ERS grade A (excellent) or B (very good) spirometry quality with (95%) and without supervision (91%) independent of lung function severity or age. Participants with poorer grades (C-F) either experienced technical difficulties with their devices or failed to perform a sufficient number of manoeuvres. No patients required carer assistance to perform spirometry remotely. Conclusion: For a large proportion of adult CF patients, unsupervised portable spirometry produces acceptable and repeatable results. Ongoing monitoring for technical difficulties may be needed.","Bell, J.; Sivam, S.; Dentice, R.; Dwyer, T.; Jo, H.; Lau, E.; Lee, W.

Serum glycoprotein, C1-inhibitor (C1-INH) is a key regulator (inhibitor) of serine proteases of all the above-mentioned pathways. Recently, an autotransporter protein, Virulence Associated Gene 8 (Vag8) produced by the whopping cough causing pathogen, Bordetella pertussis has been shown to bind and interfere with C1-INH function. Here we present the structure of Vag8: C1-INH complex determined using cryo-electron microscopy at 3.6 Å resolution. The structure shows a unique mechanism of C1-INH inhibition not employed by other pathogens where Vag8 sequesters the Reactive Centre Loop of the C1-INH preventing its interaction with the target proteases. Importance The structure 105 kDa protein complex is one of the smallest to be determined using cryo-electron microscopy at high resolution. The mechanism of disrupting C1-INH revealed by the structure is crucial to understand how pathogens by producing a single virulence factor can disturb several homeostasis pathways. Virulence mechanisms such as the one described here assume more importance given the emerging evidence about dysregulation of contact activation, coagulation and fibrinolysis leading to COVID-19 pneumonia.","Dhillon, Arun; Deme, Justin C.; Furlong, Emily; Roem, Dorina; Jongerius, Ilse; Johnson, Steven; Lea, Susan M.",bioRxiv,197,1

To grasp these potential developments, we need a historical understanding of responses to catastrophe. Before the modern period of growing secularism, responses to disasters were couched in terms of theodicy, namely attempts to explain disasters involving vindications of God’s will. I briefly trace the history of theodicies from the Axial Age to secular modernity. The actual concept of theodicy came originally from the philosopher Gottfried Leibniz, who claimed that we live in the best of all possible worlds. Leibnizian optimism came to an end with the Lisbon earthquake of 1756. Early theodicies were addressed to these natural disasters, but what about disasters that are directly caused by human agency such as the rise of fascism and the Holocaust? I consider religious responses that attempt to make sense of the Devastation. Jewish responses to the Holocaust raised in an acute form the question of God’s presence at Auschwitz and what might be a meaningful human response, if any. I call these responses theodicies of rage. I conclude by looking at the possibility of secular political theodicies of the COVID-19 catastrophe specifically from the Far Right. Populism is an important seedbed of secular theodicies. While religious responses to the pandemic have been somewhat muted, through populism and President Trump’s appeal to evangelical Protestantism in the United States, religious themes have been combined with the politics of protest. In response to the pandemic, Trump’s “Make America Great Again” is an important component of an emerging “White political theology.” Whereas traditional theodicies offered meaning and hope in the face of disaster, responses to COVID-19 have emerged as modern theodicies of rage. © 2021 selection and editorial matter, J.

It emerged that Cresta Hotels and the African Sun group of hotels are only at the inception stage of SDG localisation, focusing on several SDGs that respond to the socio-economic and environmental demands of the environments they work in. Given that most of the work under the SDGs only began inception between 2018 and 2019, there is still a long way to go before meaningful progress can be reported regarding SDG localization, with preliminary evidence showing that the hotel industry is likely to have made significant inroads when the SDGs lapse in 2030 if their efforts are not disturbed by the COVID-19 pandemic.

(ii) Could the sustainability protocols constitute a solution towards the achievement of SDG11? We underline that, on the one hand, the SDGs are guidelines to support the development of sustainable policies and thus address all elements that may affect them, and on the other hand, sustainability protocols are assessment tools to promote sustainability-conscious design while remaining focused on the built environment. In the Italian regulatory context, the paper highlights how this difference in terms of focus and scale means that they only overlap and mutually reinforce each other with regard to certain aspects, more related to energy and air pollution issues and less to the social aspects of sustainability. Even if there is not always a direct relationship between the evaluation criteria of the protocols and the indicators of SDG11, it is possible to conclude that the sustainability protocols can facilitate the achievement of the SDG11 targets, acting as a key for the implementation of sustainable cities and helping in structuring the process leading to sustainability in a broader framework.","Abastante, Francesca Lami Isabella M.",Sustainability,197,9

BCG is a live bovine tuberculosis bacillus with immunotherapeutic effects in urothelial cancers;it is also used as vaccination against Mycobacterium tuberculosis in parts of the world. As BCG vaccination has been associated with broad protection against viral pathogens, BCG exposure through vaccination or intravesical therapy may modulate host immunity and reduce the severity of COVID-19 infection. We report the effect of BCG exposure on COVID-19 severity in oncology patients from the CCC19 registry. Methods: The CCC19 registry (NCT04354701) was used to identify patients with prior BCG exposure. Cohort A received intravesical treatment for bladder carcinoma, and cohort B received prior BCG vaccination. Each cohort was matched 3:1 to non-BCG-exposed controls by age, sex, race, primary cancer type, cancer status, ECOG performance status (PS) and calendar time of COVID-19 infection. The primary endpoint was COVID-19 severity reported on an ordinal scale (uncomplicated, hospitalized, admitted to ICU +/- ventilated, died within 30 days) of patients exposed to prior BCG compared to matched non-exposed controls. 2-sided Wilcoxon ranksum tests were used. Results: As of 6-Feb-2021 we included 124 patients with BCG exposure, 68 patients with bladder carcinoma who had received intravesical BCG (Cohort A), and 64 cancer patients with prior BCG vaccination (Cohort B). Median age was 76 years, IQR 69-83 (Cohort A) and 67 years, IQR 62-74 (Cohort B). Bladder cancer pts were predominately male (78%) vs 55% for Cohort B. Patients with PS 2+ were uncommon, 18% in Cohort A and 16% in Cohort B. COVID-19 illness severity was no different in patients exposed to prior intravesicular BCG (p=0.87). COVID-19 illness severity was no different in patients exposed to prior intradermal BCG vaccination (p=0.60). Conclusions: Despite this being the largest such cohort reported to date, we failed to demonstrate an association of prior BCG exposure with modulation of severity of COVID19 illness. Prospective trials evaluating the protective effect of BCG vaccination are ongoing and will add further insight into the effect of BCG on COVID-19 illness.","Schmidt, A.

Initial strategy focused on vaccinating the elderly to prevent hospitalizations and deaths. With vaccines becoming available to the broader population, we aimed to determine the optimal strategy to enable the safe lifting of NPIs while avoiding virus resurgence. Methods: We developed a compartmental deterministic SEIR model to simulate the lifting of NPIs under different vaccination rollout scenarios. Using case and vaccination data from Toronto, Canada between December 28, 2020 and May 19, 2021, we estimated transmission throughout past stages of NPI escalation/relaxation to compare the impact of lifting NPIs on different dates on cases, hospitalizations, and deaths, given varying degrees of vaccine coverages by 20-year age groups, accounting for waning immunity. Results: We found that, once coverage among the elderly is high enough (80% with at least one dose), the main age groups to target are 20-39 and 40-59 years, whereby first-dose coverage of at least 70% by mid-June 2021 is needed to minimize the possibility of resurgence if NPIs are to be lifted in the summer. While a resurgence was observed for every scenario of NPI lifting, we also found that under an optimistic vaccination coverage (70% by mid-June, postponing reopening from August 2021 to September 2021can reduce case counts and severe outcomes by roughly 80% by December 31, 2021. Conclusions: Our results suggest that focusing the vaccination strategy on the working-age population can curb the spread of SARS-CoV-2. However, even with high vaccination coverage in adults, lifting NPIs to pre-pandemic levels is not advisable since a resurgence is expected to occur, especially with earlier reopening.","Aruffo, E.; Yuan, P.; Tan, Y.; Gatov, E.; Moyles, I.; Belair, J.; Watmough, J.; Collier, S.; Arino, J.; Zhu, H.",,197,11

BACKGROUND: Deciphering the tissue and organ interactions of the SARS-CoV-2 infection can be important to discern the potential underlying mechanisms. In the present study, we investigated the human protein–host protein interactions in the small intestine. METHODS: Public databases and published works were used to collect data related to small intestine tissue and SARS-CoV-2 infection. We constructed a human protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and showed interactions of host proteins in the small intestine. Associated modules, biological processes, functional pathways, regulatory transcription factors, disease ontology categories, and possible drug candidates for therapeutic targets were identified. RESULTS: Thirteen primary protein neighbors were found for the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2. ACE2 and its four partners were observed in a highly clustered module; moreover, 8 host proteins belonged to this module. The protein digestion and absorption as a significant pathway was highlighted with enriched genes of ACE2, MEP1A, MEP1B, DPP4, and XPNPEP2. The HNF4A, HNF1A, and HNF1B transcription factors were found to be regulating the expression of ACE2. A significant association with 12 diseases was deciphered and 116 drug-target interactions were identified. CONCLUSION: The protein-host protein interactome revealed the important elements and interactions for SARS-CoV-2 infection in the small intestine, which can be useful in clarifying the mechanisms of gastrointestinal symptoms and inflammation. The results suggest that antiviral targeting of these interactions may improve the condition of COVID-19 patients.","Khodadoost, Mahmoud; Niknam, Zahra; Farahani, Masoumeh; Razzaghi, Mohammadreza; Norouzinia, Mohsen",Gastroenterol Hepatol Bed Bench,197,9

We have previously reported that an open reading frame (ORF) 1a-specific proteinase of the picornavirus 3C proteinase group is involved in processing of the coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) 1a/1b polyprotein, leading to the formation of a mature viral protein of 100 kDa. We report here the identification of a novel 10-kDa polypeptide and the involvement of the 3C-like proteinase in processing of the ORF 1a polyprotein to produce the 10-kDa protein species. By using a region-specific antiserum, V47, raised against a bacterial-viral fusion protein containing IBV sequence encoded between nucleotides 11488 and 12600, the 10-kDa polypeptide was detected in lysates from both IBV-infected and plasmid DNA-transfected Vero cells. Coexpression, deletion, and mutagenesis studies showed that this novel polypeptide was encoded by ORF 1a from nucleotide 11545 to 11878 and was cleaved from the 1a polyprotein by the 3C-like proteinase domain. Evidence presented suggested that a previously predicted Q-S (Q3783 S3784) dipeptide bond encoded by ORF 1a between nucleotides 11875 and 11880 was responsible for the release of the C terminus of the 10-kDa polypeptide and that a novel Q-N (Q3672 N3673) dipeptide bond encoded between nucleotides 11542 and 11547 was responsible for the release of the N terminus of the 10-kDa polypeptide.","Liu, D X; Xu, H Y; Brown, T D",Journal of virology,197,11

The RT-LAMP is a recently described DNA amplification technique reported to be simple, inexpensive, fast, and accurate. The RT-LAMP reaction was set up using 2 sets of primers that were designed to detect North American and European strains of PRRSV and performed successfully in a simple heat block. The specificity of the amplified product was demonstrated by restriction analysis. The RT-LAMP was able to detect 5 different PRRSV isolates. However, the limit of detection ranged between 10(2) and 10(4) 50% tissue culture infective dose/ml. The RT-LAMP was further evaluated using serum samples from animals of known infection status. The ability of RT-LAMP to detect PRRSV in serum from acutely infected animals was evaluated with 114 serum samples from 18 experimentally inoculated boars. Forty-nine of these samples tested positive by RT-LAMP, while 94 were positive by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The diagnostic specificity, evaluated with 100 known negative serum samples, was estimated as 99%. The feasibility of RT-LAMP to detect PRRSV was demonstrated in the current study. The RT-LAMP reaction could be performed in just 1 hr with a simple and inexpensive heat block. However, the sensitivity of this technique was significantly lower than that of RT-PCR.","Rovira, Albert; Abrahante, Juan; Murtaugh, Michael; Muñoz-Zanzi, Claudia","Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc",197,15

For this reason, a nationwide study was conducted in Spain with the objective to determine which public health events provoke the most frequent crises, to reach a consensus regarding the appropriate actions to be taken when responding to public health crises, and to provide recommendations for their management. The events which had most frequently provoked crises between 1999 and 2004 were identified. A consensus was obtained by public health experts from the 17 Autonomous Regions of Spain and the National Epidemiological Centre using the RAND/UCLA method which combines the Nominal Groups and Delphi techniques. Legionellosis, foodborne diseases, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), bioterrorism, meningococcal meningitis, tuberculosis, heat waves, and influenza epidemics were found to be cause for most public health crises. In Spain, 75% of the crises identified by senior public health experts from the Autonomous Regions involved infectious diseases. Factors triggering a crisis included the type of disease, social alarm, population affected, and the course of action taken by public institutions and reporting in the media. There was consensus that correct information, qualified personnel, availability of standardised protocols for investigation and control, information distribution, and setting up of ‘crisis offices’ were actions with a positive effect regarding crisis resolution.

Choleratoxin (n = 2), E. coli heat-labile enterotoxin (n = 2) or castor oil (n = 2) were given intragastrically or piglets were intraperitoneally injected with DL 5-hydroxytryptophan (n = 3). These substances induced a transient diarrhoea without clinical symptoms of dehydration. Therefore, a combination of castor oil and DL 5-hydroxytryptophan was given two times a day during 3 consecutive days to 3 piglets. Although diarrhoea lasted for 5 days, still no hypovolaemia occurred. Probably the secretagogues have to be given continuously to mimic the continuous release of enterotoxins during secretory colibacillary diarrhoea. It was, therefore, tried to reproduce colibacillosis in the just-weaned piglets. Animals were inoculated with K88ac fimbriae producing ETEC strains (O149:K91:K88ac; LT, STa and STb positive) (n = 7), or pretreated with chloramphenicol followed by the ETEC inoculation (n = 8), or pretreated with the antibiotic, inoculated with an enteropathogenic coronavirus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), and subsequently inoculated with ETEC (n = 18). Only the last procedure induced a reproducible diarrhoea (93%) and dehydration resulting in a mortality of 80%. It was concluded that the latter experimental procedure could be used to study diarrhoea and hypovolaemia in newly-weaned piglets and to evaluate the effect of potentially antisecretory drugs on postweaning diarrhoea in piglets.","Cox, E; Schrauwen, E; Cools, V; Houvenaghel, A",Zentralblatt fur Veterinarmedizin.

The serum antibodies derived from S and various segments of S1 region neutralized SARS-CoV in vitro. No cross-neutralization occurred with the goat antiserum prepared with inactivated HCoV-OC43 or HCoV-229E.

SARS has added its own dissonant note to ""health disturbance"", caused fear and panic and disrupted international commerce. Its emergence should be perceived as a disturbing alarm that underscores the need to strengthen public health and facilitate construction of a human security ""umbrella"" in the event of future disasters. Although SARS has produced a relatively insignificant level of damage when compared to other threats, its long-term effects on health should not be underestimated, based on its unexpected appearance and still unknown properties. This essay presents a qualitative flowchart that follows SARS from its origin in China to the accumulation of global damage. Two future scenarios were formulated, covering a worse-case outcome and containment outcome, which currently appears to be the case. In the event of the worst-case scenario it is doubtful whether any health service in Europe could cope. In either case, the development of a European Union Center for Disease Control is mandatory.","Levett, Jeffrey",Croatian medical journal,197,17

Among them is a sizeable and reliable source of fully functional and microbiologically safe islets. The inherent variability among porcine pancreases, with respect to islet yield, prompted us to develop a Biopsy Score technique to determine the suitability of each pancreas for islet isolation processing. The Biopsy Score consists of an assessment of five variables: warm ischemia time, pancreas color, fat content, islet size, and islet demarcation, each of which is assigned a value of -1 or +1, depending on whether or not the established criteria is met. For determination of islet size and demarcation, fresh biopsies of porcine pancreases are stained with dithizone (DTZ) solution and examined under a dissecting microscope. Based on the scoring of such biopsies in pancreases from 26-56-month-old sows, we report here that the presence of large (>100 microm diameter), well-demarcated islets in the pancreas biopsy is a reliable predictor of isolation success. Encapsulation of the isolated porcine islets within the inner layer of a 1.5% agarose and an outer layer of 5.0% agarose macrobead, containing 500 equivalent islet number (EIN), provides for extended in vitro functional viability (>6 months of insulin production in response to glucose), as well as for comprehensive microbiological testing and at least partial isolation of the xenogeneic islets from the host immune system. All microbiological testing to date has been negative, except for the presence of porcine endogenous retrovirus (PERV). Taken together, we believe that the Biopsy Score enhancement of our islet isolation technique and our agarose-agarose macroencapsulation methodology bring us significantly closer to realizing clinical porcine islet xenotransplantation for the treatment of insulin-dependent diabetic patients.","Gazda, Lawrence S; Adkins, Hollie; Bailie, Johannah A; Byrd, Wendy; Circle, Lisa; Conn, Bryan; Diehl, Carolyn H; Hall, Richard D; Rubin, Albert L; Smith, Barry H",Cell transplantation,197,1

A retrospective observational study was conducted in a 22-bed multidisciplinary adult intensive care unit of a tertiary referral university hospital. All patients (n = 64) receiving > 100 microg/min of adrenaline or noradrenaline or adrenaline and noradrenaline combined over a one-year period were studied to determine survival to intensive care unit and hospital discharge. Four patients survived to intensive care unit discharge and hospital discharge (6.25%, 95% CI 0.3 to 12.2%). Survival was 3.3% (95% CI 0 to 7.9%) in the subgroup of 60 patients who received > 100 microg/min noradrenaline and 3.6% (95% CI 0 to 8.6%) in the 55 patients who received > 2 microg/kg/min noradrenaline. None of the 32 patients who received > 200 microg/min noradrenaline survived. We conclude that the survival of patients requiring high doses of catecholamines is poor but the use of such doses is probably not futile. It remains for individual clinicians, patients and their surrogates to decide whether use of high doses of vasopressor is appropriate, given the low probability of survival.","Jenkins, C R; Gomersall, C D; Leung, P; Joynt, G M",Anaesthesia and intensive care,197,16

We found that prior Chlamydia muridarum infection can inhibit airway eosinophilic inflammation and mucus production induced by allergen sensitization and challenge. The inhibition was correlated with an alteration of allergen-driven cytokine-producing patterns of T cells. We demonstrated that NK cells were activated following chlamydial infection, showing both cell expansion and cytokine secretion. The in vivo depletion of NK cells using anti-NK Ab before OVA sensitization and challenge partially abolished the inhibitory effect of chlamydial infection, which was associated with a partial restoration of Th2 cytokine production. In contrast, the adoptive transfer of NK cells that were isolated from infected mice showed a significant inhibitory effect on allergic responses, similar to that observed in natural infection. The data suggest that the innate immune cells such as NK cells may play an important role in infection-mediated inhibition of allergic responses.","Han, Xiaobing; Fan, Yijun; Wang, Shuhe; Jiao, Lei; Qiu, Hongyu; Yang, Xi",Journal of immunology,197,11

This study aimed to evaluate the correlation between chest computed tomography (CT) scan findings and outcomes of COVID-19 cases. Methods This cross sectional study was carried out on confirmed COVID-19 cases with clinical manifestations and chest CT scan findings based on Iran's National Guidelines for defining COVID-19. Baseline and chest CT scan characteristics of patients were investigated and their correlation with mortality was analyzed and reported using SPSS 21.0. Results 380 patients with the mean age of 53.62 ± 16.66 years were evaluated (66.1% male). The most frequent chest CT scan abnormalities were in peripheral (86.6%) and peribronchovascular interstitium (34.6%), with ground glass pattern (54.1%), and round (53.6%) or linear (46.7%) shape. There was a significant correlation between shape of abnormalities (p = 0.003), CT scan Severity Score (CTSS) (p <0.0001), and pulmonary artery CT diameter (p = 0. 01) with mortality. The mean CTSS of non-survived cases was significantly higher (13.68 ± 4.59 versus 8.72 ± 4.42; <0.0001). The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of CTSS in predicting the patients' mortality was 0.800 (95% CI: 0.716-0.884). The best cut off point of chest CTSS in this regard was 12 with 75.82% (95% CI: 56.07%-88.98%) sensitivity and 75.78% (95% CI: 70.88%-80.10%) specificity. The mean main pulmonary artery diameter in patients with CTSS ≥ 12 was higher than cases with CTSS < 12 (27.89 ± 3.73 vs 26.24 ± 3.14 mm; p < 0.0001). Conclusion Based on the results of the present study it seems that there is a significant correlation between chest CT scan characteristics and mortality of COVID-19 cases. Patients with lower CTSS, lower pulmonary artery CT diameter, and round shape opacity had lower mortality.","Raoufi, Masoomeh; Safavi Naini, Seyed Amir Ahmad; Azizan, Zahra; Jafar Zade, Fatemeh; Shojaeian, Fatemeh; Ghanbari Boroujeni, Masoud; Robatjazi, Farzaneh; Haghighi, Mehrdad; Arhami Dolatabadi, Ali; Soleimantabar, Hossein; Shoaee, Simindokht; Hatamabadi, Hamidreza",Archives of academic emergency medicine,197,1

Early policy initiatives included expedited assessments of COVID-19 diagnostic tests and enhanced communications and information provision. Emergency exemptions enabled continuity of supply of diagnostic tests and personal protective equipment including face masks, and formed part of contingency planning regarding ventilator capacity. A post-market review of face masks improved the quality of face masks included on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods, and prompted broader reforms for low risk (Class I) medical devices. Increased compliance activities and infringement notices focused particularly on importation and advertising issues.

Both genomes are 30,713 nucleotides long, excluding the poly(A) tail, and only differ by 6 nucleotides. These six mutations are scattered throughout the genome and give rise to only two amino acid substitutions: one in the spike protein gene (I958F) and the other in the nucleocapsid protein gene (V81A). Furthermore, the two variants were shown to reach the central nervous system (CNS) after intranasal inoculation in BALB/c mice, demonstrating neuroinvasive properties. Even though the ATCC strain could penetrate the CNS more effectively than the Paris 2001 isolate, these results suggest that intrinsic neuroinvasive properties already existed for the HCoV-OC43 ATCC human respiratory isolate from the 1960s before it was propagated in newborn mouse brains. It also demonstrates that the molecular structure of HCoV-OC43 is very stable in the environment (the two variants were isolated ca. 40 years apart) despite virus shedding and chances of persistence in the host. The genomes of the two HCoV-OC43 variants display 71, 53.1, and 51.2% identity with those of mouse hepatitis virus A59, severe acute respiratory syndrome human coronavirus Tor2 strain (SARS-HCoV Tor2), and human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), respectively. HCoV-OC43 also possesses well-conserved motifs with regard to the genome sequence of the SARS-HCoV Tor2, especially in open reading frame 1b. These results suggest that HCoV-OC43 and SARS-HCoV may share several important functional properties and that HCoV-OC43 may be used as a model to study the biology of SARS-HCoV without the need for level three biological facilities.","St-Jean, Julien R; Jacomy, Hélène; Desforges, Marc; Vabret, Astrid; Freymuth, François; Talbot, Pierre J",Journal of virology,197,1

A total of 628 patients were enrolled and assessed by evaluation of their clinical and bacteriological responses 5 to 7 days and 21 to 28 days after administration of the last dose of study medication. Although the trial was designed, on the basis of predefined outcomes, to demonstrate the equivalence of the two regimens, the results showed statistically significant higher clinical success rates (for moxifloxacin, 93.4%, and for comparator regimen, 85.4%; difference [Delta], 8.05%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.91 to 13.19%; P = 0.004) and bacteriological success rates (for moxifloxacin, 93.7%, and for comparator regimen, 81.7%; Delta, 12.06%; 95% CI, 1.21 to 22.91%) for patients treated with moxifloxacin. This superiority was seen irrespective of the severity of the pneumonia and whether or not the combination therapy included a macrolide. The time to resolution of fever was also statistically significantly faster for patients who received moxifloxacin (median time, 2 versus 3 days), and the duration of hospital admission was approximately 1 day less for patients who received moxifloxacin. The treatment was converted to oral therapy immediately after the initial mandatory 3-day period of i.v. administration for a larger proportion of patients in the moxifloxacin group than patients in the comparator group (151 [50.2%] versus 57 [17.8%] patients). There were fewer deaths (9 [3.0%] versus 17 [5.3%]) and fewer serious adverse events (38 [12.6%] versus 53 [16.5%]) in the moxifloxacin group than in the comparator group. The rates of drug-related adverse events were comparable in both groups (38.9% in each treatment group). The overall incidence of laboratory abnormalities was similar in both groups. Thus, it is concluded that monotherapy with moxifloxacin is superior to that with a standard combination regimen of a beta-lactam and a beta-lactamase inhibitor, co-amoxiclav, with or without a macrolide, clarithromycin, in the treatment of patients with community-acquired pneumonia admitted to a hospital.","Finch, R; Schürmann, D; Collins, O; Kubin, R; McGivern, J; Bobbaers, H; Izquierdo, J L; Nikolaides, P; Ogundare, F; Raz, R; Zuck, P; Hoeffken, G",Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,197,28

MeV is responsible for major morbidity and mortality in non-vaccinated populations. ERDRP-0519, a pan-morbillivirus small molecule inhibitor for the treatment of measles, targets the morbillivirus RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRP) complex and displayed unparalleled oral efficacy against lethal infection of ferrets with CDV, an established surrogate model for human measles. Resistance profiling identified the L subunit of the RdRP, which harbors all enzymatic activity of the polymerase complex, as the molecular target of inhibition. Here, we examined binding characteristics, physical docking site, and the molecular mechanism of action of ERDRP-0519 through label-free biolayer interferometry, photoaffinity cross-linking, and in vitro RdRP assays using purified MeV RdRP complexes and synthetic templates. Results demonstrate that unlike all other mononegavirus small molecule inhibitors identified to date, ERDRP-0519 inhibits all phosphodiester bond formation in both de novo initiation of RNA synthesis at the promoter and RNA elongation by a committed polymerase complex. Photocrosslinking and resistance profiling-informed ligand docking revealed that this unprecedented mechanism of action of ERDRP-0519 is due to simultaneous engagement of the L protein polyribonucleotidyl transferase (PRNTase)-like domain and the flexible intrusion loop by the compound, pharmacologically locking the polymerase in pre-initiation conformation. This study informs selection of ERDRP-0519 as clinical candidate for measles therapy and identifies a previously unrecognized druggable site in mononegavirus L polymerase proteins that can silence all synthesis of viral RNA.","Cox, Robert M; Sourimant, Julien; Govindarajan, Mugunthan; Natchus, Michael G; Plemper, Richard K",PLoS Pathog,197,13

We aimed to analyse the clinical characteristics, cardiac injury, electrocardiogram and computed tomography (CT) features of patients confirmed Covid-19 and explored the prediction models for the severity of Covid-19. METHODS: A retrospective and single-centre study enrolled 98 laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 patients. Clinical data, electrocardiogram and CT features were collected and analysed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences software. RESULTS: There were 46 males and 52 females, with a median age of 44 years, categorised into three groups, including mild, moderate and severe/critical Covid-19. The rate of abnormal electrocardiograms in severe/critical group (79%) was significantly higher than that in the mild group (17%) (P = .027), which (r = 0.392, P = .005) positively related to the severity of Covid-19 (OR: 5.71, 95% CI: 0.45-3.04, P = .008). Age older than 60 years old, comorbidities, whether had symptoms on admission, fatigue, CT features, laboratory test results such as platelet count, lymphocyte cell count, eosinophil cell count, CD3+ cell count, CD4+ cell count, CD8+ cell count, the ratio of albumin/globulin decreased and D-dimer, C-reactive protein (CRP), B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), cardiac troponin I (cTnI) elevated were the risk factors for the increased severity of Covid-19.

Methods: The data on COVID-19 cases extracted from official governmental sources until April 18, 2020. A modified SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered) modelling was used to plot the pandemic outbreak in 10 PostSoviet states and forecasting over the period of 10, 30 and 60 days. The optimal measures (best-scenario) and suboptimal measures (worst-scenarios) of potential spread of COVID-19 in these countries were estimated. Results: It was estimated that Armenia and Azerbaijan have reached their peaks, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, and Uzbekistan are expected to reach their peaks in the early May-2020), with comparatively low cases of COVID-19 in the best-case scenario. In contrast, Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine would likely see the outbreaks with the largest number of COVID-19 cases amongst the studied Post-Soviet States in the worst-scenario during the next 30 and 60 days. Conclusion: Governmental response was shown to be as an important determining factor responsible for the development of COVID-19 epidemic in Post-Soviet states. The current protection rates should be maintained to reduce active cases during upcoming 30 and 60 days. The estimated possible scenarios based on the proposed model can potentially be used by healthcare professionals from each studied Post-Soviet States as well as others to improve plans to contain the current and future epidemic.","Issanov, Alpamys; Amanbek, Yerlan; Abbay, Anara; Adambekov, Shalkar; Aljofan, Mohamad; Kashkynbayev, Ardak; Gaipov, Abduzhappar",Electro.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Relevant studies were searched in PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science databases until March 31, 2020. Cochrane's Q test and the I2 statistic were used to determine heterogeneity. We used the random-effect models to pool the weighted mean differences (WMDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). KEY FINDINGS: Out of a total of 8557 initial records, 44 articles (50 studies) with 7865 patients (ranging from 13 to 1582), were included. Our meta-analyses with random-effect models showed a significant decrease in lymphocytes, monocyte, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, CD3 cells, CD19 cells, and natural killer (NK) cells and an increase in the white blood cell (WBC), neutrophils, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), C-reactive protein (CRP)/hs-CRP, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), ferritin, procalcitonin (PCT), and serum amyloid A (SAA), interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-2R, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-&#945;), and interferon-gamma (INF-Î³) in the severe group compared to the non-severe group. However, no significant differences were found in IL-1ß, IL-17, and CD4/CD8 T cell ratio between the two groups. SIGNIFICANCE: Decrease in total lymphocytes and lymphocyte subsets as well as the elevation of CRP, ESR, SAA, PCT, ferritin, and cytokines, but not IL-1ß and IL-17, were closely associated with COVID-19 severity, implying reliable indicators of severe COVID-19.","Akbari, Hamed; Tabrizi, Reza; Lankarani, Kamran B; Aria, Hamid; Vakili, Sina; Asadian, Fatemeh; Noroozi, Saam; Keshavarz, Pedram; Faramarz, Sanaz",Life Sci,197,1

We aimed to assess household transmissibility of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and risk factors associated with infectivity and susceptibility to infection in Wuhan. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included the households of all laboratory-confirmed or clinically confirmed COVID-19 cases and laboratory-confirmed asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections identified by the Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention between Dec 2, 2019, and April 18, 2020. We defined households as groups of family members and close relatives who did not necessarily live at the same address and considered households that shared common contacts as epidemiologically linked. We used a statistical transmission model to estimate household secondary attack rates and to quantify risk factors associated with infectivity and susceptibility to infection, accounting for individual-level exposure history. We assessed how intervention policies affected the household reproductive number, defined as the mean number of household contacts a case can infect. FINDINGS: 27â101 households with 29â578 primary cases and 57â581 household contacts were identified. The secondary attack rate estimated with the transmission model was 15·6% (95% CI 15·2-16·0), assuming a mean incubation period of 5 days and a maximum infectious period of 22 days. Individuals aged 60 years or older were at a higher risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2 than all other age groups. Infants aged 0-1 years were significantly more likely to be infected than children aged 2-5 years (odds ratio [OR] 2·20, 95% CI 1·40-3·44) and children aged 6-12 years (1·53, 1·01-2·34). Given the same exposure time, children and adolescents younger than 20 years of age were more likely to infect others than were adults aged 60 years or older (1·58, 1·28-1·95). Asymptomatic individuals were much less likely to infect others than were symptomatic cases (0·21, 0·14-0·31). Symptomatic cases were more likely to infect others before symptom onset than after (1·42, 1·30-1·55). After mass isolation of cases, quarantine of household contacts, and restriction of movement policies were implemented, household reproductive numbers declined by 52% among primary cases (from 0·25 [95% CI 0·24-0·26] to 0·12 [0·10-0·13]) and by 63% among secondary cases (from 0·17 [0·16-0·18] to 0·063 [0·057-0·070]). INTERPRETATION: Within households, children and adolescents were less susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection but were more infectious than older individuals. Presymptomatic cases were more infectious and individuals with asymptomatic infection less infectious than symptomatic cases. These findings have implications for devising interventions for blocking household transmission of SARS-CoV-2, such as timely vaccination of eligible children once resources become available.

This study aimed to compare the association of ARBs and ACEIs with COVID-19-related mortality. METHODS: All patients with COVID-19 in Korea between January 19 and April 16, 2020 were enrolled. The association of ARBs and ACEIs with mortality within 60 days were evaluated. A comparison of hazard ratio (HR) was performed between COVID-19 patients and a retrospective cohort of pneumonia patients hospitalized in 2019 in Korea. RESULTS: Among 10,448 COVID-19 patients, ARBs and ACEIs were prescribed in 1,231 (11.7%) and 57 (0.6%) patients, respectively. After adjusting for age, sex, and history of comorbidities, the ARB group showed neutral association (HR, 1.034; 95% CI, 0.765 to 1.399; p = 0.8270) and the ACEI groups showed no significant associations likely owing to the small population size (HR, 0.736; 95% CI, 0.314 to 1.726; p = 0.4810). When comparing HR between COVID-19 patients and a retrospective cohort of patients hospitalized with pneumonia in 2019, the trend of ACEIs showed similar benefits, whereas the protective effect of ARBs observed in the retrospective cohort was absent in COVID-19 patients. Meta-analyses showed significant positive correlation with survival of ACEIs, whereas a neutral association between ARBs and mortality. CONCLUSION: Although ARBs or ACEIs were not associated with fatal outcomes, potential beneficial effects of ARBs observed in pneumonia were attenuated in COVID-19.","Lee, Hae-Young; Ahn, Juhee; Park, Juhong; Kang, Chang Kyung; Won, Sung-Ho; Kim, Dong Wook; Park, Jong-Heon; Chung, Ki-Hyun; Joh, Joon-Sung; Bang, Ji Hwan; Kang, Cheong Hee; Oh, Myoung-Don; Pyun, Wook Bum",Korean J Intern Med,197,16

Efforts were made at local, regional and national levels to lockdown the movement of people and to keep infected one in quarantine or isolation to stop the spread of COVID-19. The traffic, market and small industries were closed, as a result pronounced decline in the concentrations of particulate matters (PM) were observed. Normally these sources contribute to the high concentrations of particulate matters (PM2.5) which represents air quality of a location. In this short communication, we present analysis of PM2.5 of major cities (New York, Los Angeles, Zaragoza, Rome, Dubai, Delhi, Mumbai, Beijing and Shanghai) around the world suffered severely with the COVID-19. Our analysis shows decline in PM2.5 concentration due to lockdown, mainly due to less movement of people to keep ""social distancing"" to control the spread of CORONA-19.

However, the pathogenesis of ARDS following SRAS-CoV-2 infection remains largely unknown. In the present study, we examined apoptosis in postmortem lung sections from COVID-19 patients and in lung tissues from a non-human primate model of SARS-CoV-2 infection, in a cell-type manner, including type 1 and 2 alveolar cells and vascular endothelial cells (ECs), macrophages, and T cells. Multiple-target immunofluorescence assays and Western blotting suggest both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways are activated during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, we observed that SARS-CoV-2 fails to induce apoptosis in human bronchial epithelial cells (i.e., BEAS2B cells) and primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), which are refractory to SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, infection of co-cultured Vero cells and HUVECs or Vero cells and BEAS2B cells with SARS-CoV-2 induced apoptosis in both Vero cells and HUVECs/BEAS2B cells but did not alter the permissiveness of HUVECs or BEAS2B cells to the virus. Post-exposure treatment of the co-culture of Vero cells and HUVECs with a novel non-cyclic nucleotide small molecule EPAC1-specific activator reduced apoptosis in HUVECs. These findings may help to delineate a novel insight into the pathogenesis of ARDS following SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Liu, Yakun Garron Tania M.; Chang, Qing Su Zhengchen Zhou Changcheng Qiu Yuan Gong Eric C.; Zheng, Junying Yin Y.

However, if children continue mixing with others outside the home during closures, the effect of these measures may be limited.AimThis review aimed to summarise existing literature on children's activities and contacts made outside the home during unplanned school closures.MethodsIn February 2020, we searched four databases, MEDLINE, PsycInfo, Embase and Web of Science, from inception to 5 February 2020 for papers published in English or Italian in peer-reviewed journals reporting on primary research exploring children's social activities during unplanned school closures. Main findings were extracted.ResultsA total of 3,343 citations were screened and 19 included in the review. Activities and social contacts appeared to decrease during closures, but contact remained common. All studies reported children leaving the home or being cared for by non-household members. There was some evidence that older child age (two studies) and parental disagreement (two studies) with closure were predictive of children leaving the home, and mixed evidence regarding the relationship between infection status and such. Parental agreement with closure was generally high, but some disagreed because of perceived low risk of infection and issues regarding childcare and financial impact.ConclusionEvidence suggests that many children continue to leave home and mix with others during school closures despite public health recommendations to avoid social contact. This review of behaviour during unplanned school closures could be used to improve infectious disease modelling.","Brooks, Samantha K; Smith, Louise E; Webster, Rebecca K; Weston, Dale; Woodland, Lisa; Hall, Ian; Rubin, G James",Euro surveill,197,1

AIM: To develop and test a smartphone-based algorithm for diagnosing CAP without need for clinical examination or radiological inputs. DESIGN AND SETTING: A prospective cohort study using data from participants aged >12 years presenting with acute respiratory symptoms to a hospital in Western Australia. METHOD: Five cough audio-segments were recorded and four patient-reported symptoms (fever, acute cough, productive cough, and age) were analysed by the smartphone-based algorithm to generate an immediate diagnostic output for CAP. Independent cohorts were recruited to train and test the accuracy of the algorithm. Diagnostic agreement was calculated against the confirmed discharge diagnosis of CAP by specialist physicians. Specialist radiologists reported medical imaging. RESULTS: The smartphone-based algorithm had high percentage agreement (PA) with the clinical diagnosis of CAP in the total cohort (n = 322, positive PA [PPA] = 86.2%, negative PA [NPA] = 86.5%, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] = 0.95); in participants 22-<65 years (n = 192, PPA = 85.7%, NPA = 87.0%, AUC = 0.94), and in participants aged &#8805;65 years (n = 86, PPA = 85.7%, NPA = 87.5%, AUC = 0.94).

We describe the impact of the pandemic on epilepsy care in three tertiary epilepsy centres from Spain and Italy, the most affected European countries. The three epilepsy centres, members of the European EpiCARE network, manage more than 5,700 people with epilepsy. In Bologna and Barcelona, the hospitals housing the epilepsy centres were fully converted into COVID-19 units. We describe the reorganization of the clinics and report on the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 in people with epilepsy as well as the frequency of seizures in patients admitted to the COVID units. Finally, we elaborate on critical issues regarding the second phase of the pandemic. The activities related to epilepsy care were reduced to less than 10% and were deprioritized. Discharges were expedited and elective epilepsy surgeries, including vagal nerve stimulator implantations, cancelled. Hospitalizations and EEG examinations were limited to emergencies. The outpatient visits for new patients were postponed, and follow-up visits mostly managed by telehealth. Antiseizure medication weaning plans and changes in vagal nerve stimulator settings were halted. Among the 5,700 people with epilepsy managed in our centres, only 14 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, without obvious impact on their epilepsy. None of the 2,122 patients admitted to COVID units experienced seizures among the early symptoms. Epilepsy care was negatively impacted by the pandemic, irrespective of COVID-19 epidemiology or conversion of the hospital into a COVID-19 centre. The pandemic did not silence the needs of people with epilepsy, and this must be considered in the planning of the second phase.","Granata, Tiziana; Bisulli, Francesca; Arzimanoglou, Alexis; Rocamora, Rodrigo",Epileptic Disord,197,1

METHODS: In the present study, a total of 23,593 patient samples were evaluated by a laboratory from the Mexican Institute of Epidemiological Diagnosis and Reference. Of these, 18,443 were negative for COVID-19, 3,844 were positive for COVID-19, and 1,306 were positive for other respiratory viruses. Severe types of respiratory disease were defined by the presence of pneumonia and other organ failure that requires intensive care. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to explore factors associated with severe COVID-19 on admission. RESULTS: Patients who tested positive for COVID-19 had a higher proportion of obesity (17.4%), diabetes (14.5%), and hypertension (18.9%) compared with those without a confirmed diagnosis. Compared with patients without obesity, those with obesity showed a 1.43-fold higher odds of developing severe COVID-19 on admission, whereas subjects with diabetes and hypertension showed a 1.87-fold and 1.77-fold higher odds of developing severe COVID-19 on admission, respectively.

Just as the introduction of the mobile phone led to considerable health innovation, smart speaker computing systems carry several unique advantages that have the potential to catalyze new fields of health research, particularly in out-of-hospital environments. The recent rise and ubiquity of these smart computing systems hold significant potential for enhancing chronic disease management, enabling passive identification of unwitnessed medical emergencies, detecting subtle changes in human behavior and cognition, limiting isolation, and potentially allowing widespread, passive, remote monitoring of respiratory diseases that impact the public health. There are 3 broad mechanisms for how a smart speaker can interact with a person to improve health. These include (i) as an intelligent conversational agent, (ii) a passive identifier of medically relevant diagnostic sounds and (iii) active sensing using the device's internal hardware to measure physiologic parameters, such as with active sonar, radar or computer vision. Each of these different modalities have specific clinical use cases, all of which need to be balanced against potential privacy concerns, equity related to system access and regulatory frameworks which have not yet been developed for this unique type of passive data collection.","Sunshine, Jacob",,197,20

Socioeconomic indicators (e.g., population, population density, gross domestic product, rural-to-urban migrants, urbanization rate, per-person disposable income, and level of health care) in these cities were also aggregated from the Bureau of Statistics. The data referring to travelers from Wuhan were collected from the Baidu Migration database. A multiple stepwise linear regression model was performed to identify the independent risk factors of the number of cases. Results: As of Mar 19, 2020, a total of 5,939 cases were reported in the 39 well-developed cities with almost half of total cases in China outside of Hubei. The number of cases ranged 20-576, and the median number of cases was 93 (IQR 54-180) in these cities.

Over a longer duration of stroking, affective habituation sets in, indicated by a reduction in rated pleasantness. However, it is not clear whether the group level effect is represented on an individual level. We analyze the stability of individual ratings of slow stroking touch and their relationship to behavioural and physiological measures. 48 participants (23 women) were repeatedly stroked with a velocity maximally activating C-tactile fibres. The perceived pleasantness was rated on a visual analogue scale. In order to examine the stability of pleasantness ratings, the experiment was repeated after a couple of days. During the experiment, electrocardiogram (ECG) and facial- electromyography (EMG) data were recorded. On the group-level, previous results of affective habituation to touch were replicated and stable across sessions. On the individual level, however, less than half of the participants showed a significant reduction of pleasantness in the course of the experiment. Moreover, the remaining participants showed either no change, random rating behaviour or even an increase in pleasantness ratings during the course of the experiment. The individual response patterns were variable across sessions but stable above the chance level. Furthermore, the response patterns could not be explicitly associated with any of the behavioural or physiological measures. Our findings indicate a lack of group-to-individual generalizability for affective habituation to touch. The variability of rating patterns over time indicates that they are not conclusively determined by stable individual characteristics. Future research investigating touch should favour a more individual approach to the more commonly applied group analysis.","Bendas, Johanna; Ree, Anbjørn; Pabel, Luise; Sailer, Uta; Croy, Ilona",Neuroscience,197,16

The purpose of this study is to examine the trends in medication use among patients with COVID-19 across the United States using a national dataset. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study of the COVID-19 cohort in the Cerner Real-World Data warehouse, which includes deidentified patient information for encounters associated with COVID-19 from December 1, 2019, through June 30, 2020. The primary variables of interest were medications given to patients during their inpatient COVID-19 treatment. We also identified demographic characteristics, calculated the proportion of patients with each medication, and stratified data by demographic variables. FINDINGS: Our sample included 51,169 inpatients from every region of the United States. Males and females were equally represented, and most patients were white and non-Hispanic. The largest proportion of patients were older than 45 years. Corticosteroids were used the most among all patients (56.5%), followed by hydroxychloroquine (17.4%), tocilizumab (3.1%), and lopinavir/ritonavir (1.1%). We found substantial variation in medication use by region, race, ethnicity, sex, age, and insurance status. IMPLICATIONS: Variations in medication use are likely attributable to multiple factors, including the timing of the pandemic by region in the United States and processes by which medications are introduced and disseminated. This study is the first of its kind to assess trends in medication use in a national dataset and is the first large, descriptive study of pharmacotherapy in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. It provides an important glimpse into prescribing patterns during a pandemic.","Stroever, Stephanie J; Ostapenko, Daniel; Scatena, Robyn; Pusztai, Daniel; Coritt, Lauren; Frimpong, Akua A; Nee, Paul",Clin. ther,197,17

We wished to create a new COVID-19 model to be suitable for patients in any country. In this work, a modified SEIR model was constructed. We used the real data of COVID-19 spread in Saudi Arabia for statistical analyses and complex analyses. The reproduction number and detailed review of stability demonstrated the complexities of our proposed SEIR model. The solution and equilibrium condition were explored based on Jacobian's linearization approach to the proposed SEIR model. The state of equilibrium was demonstrated, and a stability study was conducted in the disease-free environment. The reproduction number was measured sensitively against its internal parameters. Using the Lyapunov principle of equilibrium, the overall consistency of balance of our model was demonstrated. Findings using the SEIR model and observed outcomes due to COVID-19 spread in Saudi Arabia were compared. The modified SEIR model could enable successful analyses of the spread of epidemics such as COVID-19. An ""ideal protocol"" comprised essential steps to help Saudi Arabia decelerate COVID-19 spread.

A common issue in all of these crises seems to be the issue of ""trust."" Official authorities, including the Iranian President, ministers, and the judiciary system, tried to gain people's trust by either changing policies or developing new ones. In August 2019, the new law on crisis management in Iran went into effect and the issue of public donation has been considered, too. Also, in their response to the COVID-19 outbreak, Iranian officials ordered all sectors to cooperate with the Ministry of Health and provide it with all necessary facilities. Therefore, it seems that new policies are still needed to overcome mistrust in Iran at times of emergency. Developing a policy on donation management was the first step, and there are several factors that could have contributed to the perception of the mistrust and failure in emergency missions. Mistrust can be the result of different causes, including but not limited to lack of knowledge on capabilities and efficiencies of humanitarian organizations, engagement of a wide range of organizations from different categories, extension of mistrust of an organization to other emergency organizations in the area or all of operation, lack of unity in emergency response, and poor public relations.","Seddighi, Hamed",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,197,1

To address this problem, we consider the simple prototypical problem of signal denoising, where classical approaches such as nonlinear diffusion, wavelet-based methods and regularisation offer provable stability guarantees. To transfer such guarantees to CNNs, we interpret numerical approximations of these classical methods as a specific residual network (ResNet) architecture.

In this study, we evaluate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on insurance companies using European insurance companies’ financial statement data from 2010 to 2020. The results unambiguously demonstrate that the pandemic has negatively affected the functioning of the insurance sector. In particular, the return on assets decreased in German and Italian insurance companies during the pandemic. Furthermore, the solvency ratio decreased in the Belgian, French, and German insurance sectors. Conversely, the Polish insurance sector was unaffected. Moreover, we did not find any effects on the Z-score ratio in our sample. Lastly, the value of receivables owed to Belgian insurance companies increased.

Based on virus genome sequencing studies, the bat is suspected as the natural host of virus, and infection might be transmitted from bats via unknown intermediate hosts like reptiles and snakes etc., to infect humans. COVID-19 is transmitted from person to person contact, primarily via droplet infection within the incubation period or after clinical manifestations of fever, cough, sneezing, sputum, dyspnea, and pneumonia and through contaminated fomites. COVID-19 enters the respiratory tract through the ACE2 receptor on alveoli through binding of s-protein of the virus and causes injuries though the cytopathic effect, as well as cytokines and other mediators, released after developing sepsis. ACE 2 is almost 100-fold higher in kidneys than lung, and the virus can also involve the kidney in the same manner. Kidney involvement manifests in the form of proteinuria, hematuria, and an acute rise in serum creatinine. Kidney involvement is an independent risk factor for mortality. Diagnosis is primarly made by detecting viral RNA by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rtPCR) in nasopharyngeal swab samples. Role of antibodies, both IgM and IgG are still evolving and at best restricted for epidemiological purpose.

Surgical smoke can act as a carrier for tissue particles, viruses, and bacteria. To quantify airborne transmission from a physical point of view, we consider surgical smoke produced by thermal destruction of tissue during the use of electrosurgical instruments as a marker of airborne particle diffusion-transportation. Surgical smoke plumes are also known to be dangerous for human health, especially to surgical staff who receive long-term exposure over the years. There are limited quantified metrics reported on long-term effects of surgical smoke on staff's health. The purpose of this paper is to provide a mathematical framework and experimental protocol to assess the transport and diffusion of hazardous airborne particles in every large operating room suite. Measurements from a network of air quality sensors gathered during a clinical study provide validation for the main part of the model. Overall, the model estimates staff exposure to airborne contamination from surgical smoke and biological material. To address the clinical implication over a long period of time, the systems approach is built upon previous work on multi-scale modeling of surgical flow in a large operating room suite and takes into account human behavior factors.","Garbey, Marc; Joerger, Guillaume; Furr, Shannon",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),197,22

A sample of n = 478 (79% female) individuals from the U.S., mean (SD) age = 30.51 (10.85), and n = 476 individuals from Italy, (78% female), mean (SD) age = 33.84 (12.86), completed an online survey between April 8th and April 28th 2020. Just under half of respondents (49%) reported decreased food waste since the start of the pandemic. Rates were significantly higher among the U.S. sample (61.5%, n = 294) compared to the Italian sample (38%, n = 180). Controlling for the time since restrictions were introduced, age, gender, and perceived financial security, logistic regression revealed greater reduction in food waste since the beginning of the pandemic for U.S. individuals relative to participants from Italy (OR = 0.47, p < .001). In addition, increased importance of health concerns when making food choices (OR = 1.34, p < .005) as well as more frequent cooking (OR = 1.35, p < .001), and greater avoidance of supermarkets (OR = 1.15, p = .049) were associated with greater probability of less food waste. Scarcity and greater reliance on cooking may encourage individuals to reflect on food waste practices. Further research should explore how these factors may be targeted to reduce food waste beyond the pandemic.","Rodgers, Rachel F; Lombardo, Caterina; Cerolini, Silvia; Franko, Debra L; Omori, Mika; Linardon, Jake; Guillaume, Sebastien; Fischer, Laura; Tyszkiewicz, Matthew Fuller-",Appetite,197,32

With the significant asymptomatic spread of the virus and without an immediate vaccine and pharmaceuticals available, the best feasible strategies for testing and diagnostics, contact tracing, and quarantine need to be optimized. With potentially high false negative test results, infected people would not be enrolled in contact-trace programs and thus, may not be quarantined. Similarly, without broad testing, asymptomatic people are not identified and quarantined. Interconnected system dynamics models can be used to optimize strategies for mitigations for decision support during a pandemic. We use a systems dynamics epidemiology model along with other interconnected system models within public health including hospitals, intensive care units, masks, contact tracing, social distancing, and a newly developed testing and diagnostics model to investigate the uncertainties with testing and to optimize strategies for detecting and diagnosing infected people. Using an orthogonal array Latin Hypercube experimental design, we ran 54 simulations each for two scenarios of 10% and 30% asymptomatic people, varying important inputs for testing and social distancing. Systems dynamics modeling, coupled with computer experimental design and statistical analysis can provide rapid and quantitative results for decision support.

Telemedicine has emerged as an obvious choice to counter these impediments. However, its potential for maintaining outpatient care at pre-pandemic levels during these rapidly changing times is untested. Therefore, we analyzed our experience in a tertiary care epilepsy center. Methods: We divided the study period from March 1, 2020 to April 15, 2020 into a baseline, transition (to telemedicine), and current phase. We divided outpatient encounters into clinic, virtual (using Cleveland Clinic Express Care Online platform), and telephone (including commercial video conferencing platforms). Results: Completed outpatient visits during baseline and current period were 595 and 590, respectively. Nearly 1 out of 4 patients missed outpatient visits during the transition period. The virtual visits accounted for 19.7% of completed visits during baseline and increased to 66.8% during the current period. There were no telephone visits during the baseline phase but accounted for 26.1% of completed visits during the current phase. Less than 1 percent of completed visits in the current phase were in the clinic.

METHODS: All presentations to University Hospital Galway with self-harm were assessed during the peak period of the coronavirus crisis in Ireland, over the 3 months from 1 March to 31 May 2020. These data were compared with presentations in the same months in the 3 years preceding (2017-2019). Data were obtained from the anonymised service database. RESULTS: This study found that in 2020, the rate of presentation with self-harm dropped by 35% from March to April and rose by 104% from April to May, peaking from mid-May. When trends over a 4-year period were examined, there was a significantly higher lethality of attempt (p < 0.001), and significant differences in diagnosis (p = 0.031) in 2020 in comparison with the three previous years. The increased lethality of presentations remained significant after age and gender were controlled for (p = 0.036). There were also significant differences in the underlying psychiatric diagnoses (p = 0.018), notably with a significant increase in substance misuse disorders presenting during the 2020 study period. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 showed a reduction in self-harm presentations initially, followed by a sharp increase in May 2020. If a period of economic instability follows as predicted, it is likely that this will further impact the mental health of the population, along with rates of self-harm and suicidal behaviours.

Iranian traditional healers have applied different medicinal plants to prevent and treat COVID-19 based on their ethnopharmacological knowledge. This research aimed to investigate the ethnomedicinal knowledge of Iranian traditional healers to alleviate COVID-19 signs and symptoms. Materials & Methods: Due to the limitations caused by COVID-19 pandemic, oral interviews were conducted by 26 traditional healers in Kerman and Zahedan cities in Iran. The names of recommended remedies for COVID-19 were collected, and their scientific names were authenticated. Next, a comprehensive research was carried out in the scientific databases. Finally, the herbs with any related proved properties to the respiratory system were listed;these herbs were probably useful for the COVID-19 prevention or treatment. Results: Zataria multiflora, Althaea officinalis, Hordeum vulgare, Malva sylvestris, Matricaria chamomilla, Glycyrrhiza glabra, Allium sativum and Zingiber officinale are considered as the most popular herbs by Iranian traditional healers for prevention and/or treatment of COVID-19. Recent studies have demonstrated that the above-mentioned herbs can be considered as good sources for alleviating the respiratory disorders such as influenza. Moreover, they have antitussive and immune-modulatory properties. Conclusion: Since there is no effective treatment for COVID-19, the capacity of different traditional medicine and ethnomedicine knowledge can be used as good sources for new drug discovery after accurate studies. © 2021, This is an original open-access article.","Azimi, M.; Mojahedi, M.; Mokaberinejad, R.; Hasheminasab, F.

Second, the great ""work from home experiment"" may change occupational perspectives on working from home. Organizations and researchers may be able to better understand which occupational and individual characteristics are associated with work-from-home effectiveness and better designate occupational groups and individuals to working (or not working) from home.

We aimed to investigate if frontline healthcare workers affected by infodemia show different psychological consequences than frontline clinicians who do not declare to be affected by false news related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Materials and Methods: One hundred twenty-six frontline healthcare workers from the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and Emergency Departments in Romania completed a survey to assess stress, depression, anxiety, and sleep disorders, between March and April 2020. We split the sample of frontline healthcare workers into two groups based on the self-evaluated criteria: if they were or were not affected by infodemia in their activity. Results: Considering limitations such as the cross-sectional design, the lack of causality relationship, and the sample size, the results show that, the frontline medical workers who declared to be affected by false news were significantly more stressed, felt more anxiety, and suffered more from insomnia than healthcare workers who are not affected by false information related to pandemic time. Conclusions: The infodemia has significant psychological consequences such as stress, anxiety, and insomnia on already overwhelmed doctors and nurses in the outbreak of the COVID-19 crisis. These findings suggest that medical misinformation's psychological implications must be considered when different interventions regarding frontline healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic are implemented.","Secosan, Ica; Virga, Delia; Crainiceanu, Zorin Petrisor; Bratu, Lavinia Melania; Bratu, Tiberiu",Medicina (Kaunas),197,11

Four distinct rest activity rhythms (RARs) were identified using k-means clustering of participants' temporally distributed step counts. Hierarchical clustering of the proportion of time spent in each of these RAR revealed 4 groups who expressed different mixtures of RAR profiles before and during the lockdown. Substantial but asymmetric delays in bedtime and waketime resulted in a 24 min increase in weekday sleep duration with no loss in sleep efficiency. Resting heart rate declined 2 bpm. PA dropped an average of 38%. 4 groups with different compositions of RAR profiles were found. Three were better able to maintain PA and weekday/weekend differentiation during lockdown. The least active group comprising 51 percent of the sample, were younger and predominantly singles. Habitually less active already, this group showed the greatest reduction in PA during lockdown with little weekday/weekend differences. Among different mobility restrictions, removal of habitual social cues by lockdown had the largest effect on PA and sleep. Sleep and resting heart rate unexpectedly improved. RAR evaluation uncovered heterogeneity of responses to lockdown and can identify characteristics of persons at risk of decline in health and wellbeing.","Ong, J. L.; Lau, T.

International guidelines recommended that non-operative management be implemented wherever possible (e.g. in proven uncomplicated appendicitis) to reduce pressure on healthcare services and reduce risk of peri-operative viral transmission. We sought to compare our management and outcomes of appendicitis during lockdown vs a non-pandemic period. METHODS: All presentations to our department with a clinical diagnosis of acute appendicitis between 12/03/2020 and 30/06/2020 were compared to the same 110-day period in 2019. Quantity and severity of presentations, use of radiological investigations, rate of operative intervention and histopathological findings were variables collected for comparison. RESULTS: There was a reduction in appendicitis presentations (from 74 to 56 cases), and an increase in radiological imaging (from 70.27% to 89.29%) (P = 0.007) from 2019 to 2020. In 2019, 93.24% of patients had appendicectomy, compared to 71.42% in 2020(P < 0.001). This decrease was most pronounced in uncomplicated cases, whose operative rates dropped from 90.32% to 62.5% (P = 0.009). Post-operative histology confirmed appendicitis in 73.9% in 2019, compared to 97.5% in 2020 (P = 0.001). Normal appendiceal pathology was reported for 17 cases (24.64%) in 2019, compared to none in 2020 (P < 0.001) - a 0% negative appendicectomy rate (NAR). DISCUSSION: The 0% NAR in 2020 is due to a combination of increased CT imaging, a higher threshold to operate, and is impacted by increased disease severity due to delayed patient presentation. This study adds to growing literature promoting routine use of radiological imaging to confirm appendicitis diagnosis. As we enter a second lockdown, patients should be encouraged to avoid late presentations, and surgical departments should continue using radiological imaging more liberally in guiding appendicitis management.","Somers, Kate; Abd Elwahab, Sami; Raza, Muhammad Zeeshan; O039,; Grady, Sorcha; DeMarchi, Joshua; Butt, Abeeda; Burke, John; Robb, William; Power, Colm; McCawley, Niamh; McNamara, Deborah; Kearney, David; Hill, Arnold D K",Surg.

To answer these questions we analysed the air and the surfaces most usually touched by passengers inside a city bus during normal operation, in order to understand the possible spreading of the virus and the effectiveness of the protective measures. The measurements were carried out across the last week of the lockdown and the first week when, gradually, all the travel restrictions were removed. The air and surface samples were analysed with the RT-PCR for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus. After two weeks of measurements and more than 1100 passenger travelling on the bus the virus was never detected both on surfaces and on air, suggesting that the precautions adopted on public transportation are effective in reducing the COVID-19 spreading.","Di Carlo, Piero; Chiacchiaretta, Piero; Sinjari, Bruna; Aruffo, Eleonora; Stuppia, Liborio; De Laurenzi, Vincenzo; Di Tomo, Pamela; Pelusi, Letizia; Potenza, Francesca; Veronese, Angelo; Vecchiet, Jacopo; Falasca, Katia; Ucciferri, Claudio",PLoS One,197,1

After transmission to animals, the virus accumulates mutations in its genome as adaptation to the new animal host progresses. Therefore, we investigated whether these mutations result in mismatches with the diagnostic PCR assays and suggested proper modifications to the oligo sequences accordingly. A comprehensive bioinformatic analysis was conducted using 28 diagnostic PCR assays and 793 publicly available SARS-CoV-2 genomes isolated from animals. Sixteen out of the investigated 28 PCR assays displayed at least one mismatch with their targets at the 0.5% threshold. Mismatches were detected in seven, two, two, and six assays targeting the ORF1ab, spike, envelope, and nucleocapsid genes, respectively. Several of these mismatches, such as the deletions and mismatches at the 3' end of the primer or probe, are expected to negatively affect the diagnostic PCR assays resulting in false-negative results. The modifications to the oligo sequences should result in stronger template binding by the oligos, better sensitivity of the assays, and higher confidence in the result. It is necessary to monitor the targets of diagnostic PCR assays for any future mutations that may occur as the virus continues to evolve in animals.","Elaswad, Ahmed; Fawzy, Mohamed",,197,21

Amidst the outbreak, errors occurring in the preanalytical phase of sample collection, transport and processing, can further lead to undesirable clinical consequences. Thus, this study was designed with the following objectives: (i) to determine and compare the blood specimen rejection rate of a clinical laboratory and (ii) to characterise and compare the types of preanalytical errors between the pre-pandemic and the pandemic phases. Materials and methods: This retrospective study was carried out in a trauma-care hospital, presently converted to COVID-19 care centre. Data was collected from (i) pre-pandemic phase: 1st October 2019 to 23rd March 2020 and (ii) pandemic phase: 24th March to 31st October 2020. Blood specimen rejection rate was calculated as the proportion of blood collection tubes with preanalytical errors out of the total number received, expressed as percentage. Results: Total of 107,716 blood specimens were screened of which 43,396 (40.3%) were received during the pandemic. The blood specimen rejection rate during the pandemic was significantly higher than the pre-pandemic phase (3.0% versus 1.1%; P < 0.001). Clotted samples were the commonest source of preanalytical errors in both phases. There was a significant increase in the improperly labelled samples (P < 0.001) and samples with insufficient volume (P < 0.001), whereas, a significant decline in samples with inadequate sample-anticoagulant ratio and haemolysed samples (P < 0.001). Conclusion: In the ongoing pandemic, preanalytical errors and resultant blood specimen rejection rate in the clinical laboratory have significantly increased due to changed logistics. The study highlights the need for corrective steps at various levels to reduce preanalytical errors in order to optimise patient care and resource utilisation.","Mukhopadhyay, Tapasyapreeti; Subramanian, Arulselvi; Pandey, Shivam; Madaan, Nirupam; Trikha, Anjan; Malhotra, Rajesh",Biochem Med (Zagreb),197,1

The disease is caused by an overreaction of the innate immune system producing a cytokine storm and inflicting multiple organ damage. Our interpretation of IvIg therapy hinges on a recent analysis of the immune dysregulation in Covid-19 infection. Previous infections with common cold coronavirus induce suppressor memory B cells that inhibit an immune response to Covid-19. The repertoire of natural antibodies (IvIg) contains suppressing antibodies in a symmetrically balanced network structure. When this repertoire interacts with the imbalanced network in the infected patient, it can neutralize the suppression of an antibody response against Covid-19. The described scenario for IvIg in Covid-19 infection may also apply in the therapy of autoimmune diseases.","Kohler, Heinz; Kaveri, Srini",Monoclon Antib Immunodiagn Immunother,197,33

Large registry studies have begun to shed light on the epidemiological and clinical vulnerabilities of cancer patients who succumb to or endure poor outcomes of SARS-CoV-2. Specific treatment for COVID-19 infections in cancer patients is lacking while the demand for treatment is increasing. Therefore, we explored the effect of Rintatolimod (Ampligen®) (AIM ImmunoTech, Ocala, FL, USA), a Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) agonist, to treat uninfected human pancreatic cancer cells (HPACs). The direct effect of Rintatolimod was measured by targeted gene expression profiling and by proteomics measurements. Our results show that Rintatolimod induces an antiviral effect in HPACs by inducing RNase-L-dependent and independent pathways of the innate immune system. Treatment with Rintatolimod activated the interferon signaling pathway, leading to the overexpression of several cytokines and chemokines in epithelial cells. Furthermore, Rintatolimod treatment increased the expression of angiogenesis-related genes without promoting fibrosis, which is the main cause of death in patients with COVID-19.

Patients with coronavirus (COVID-19) infection and mental disorders often receive several medications, and they may interact. Methods: We examined the existing literature with the goal to: 1) review the bases of pharmacokinetic interactions between psychotropics and medications that are prescribed to treat COVID-19 infection and its complications;2) examine the implications for clinical practice. Results: Pharmacokinetic interactions are possible and may cause adverse effects or decrease the efficacy of one or more of the medications a patient is taking. Conclusions: A thorough evaluation of the pharmacokinetic interactions is necessary when COVID-19 medications are prescribed to patients with mental disorders that are treated with psychotropic medications. The risk of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions should inform treatment choice and may require dosing adjustments.

Timely diagnosis and treatment may be lifesaving. We report two cases demonstrating different and rare forms of severe brain involvement in adult patients with HLH: acute necrotizing encephalopathy, and diffuse hemorrhagic disease due to disseminated intravascular coagulation. Severe HLH with brain involvement in adults is rare. HLH with cerebral involvement should be considered in patients presenting with severe systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) but negative cultures and unusual or unexpectedly severe clinical and/or radiologic signs of cerebral dysfunction. Similar brain injury may occur in patients with cytokine storm syndrome due to COVID-19. BACKGROUND: Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) presents with fevers, rash, organomegaly, cytopenia, and increased triglycerides and ferritin (Ramos-Casals et al., 2014) [1]. Neurologic abnormalities are reported in about one-third of patients (Cai et al., 2017), including a few cases of acute necrotizing encephalopathy (ANE) (Xiujuan et al., 2015). Coagulation abnormalities are frequent in HLH patients (Valade et al., 2015).

However, the precise size and nature of this effect is not known: there is a paucity of quantitative evidence in this area, particularly in the form of randomised controlled trials (RCTs). The Food Standards Agency (FSA), in collaboration with Kantar Public UK’s Behavioural Practice, conducted a feasibility trial to investigate whether a randomised cluster trial – involving the proactive communication of allergen information at the point of sale in FBOs – is feasible. This was the first such trial conducted in the UK to date. The trial was conducted on-site at ten branches of a multinational FBO, and involved a matched pairs cluster quasi-randomised experiment, with five pairs of branches selected for participation. Results suggest that a fully powered RCT would likely be feasible in the UK. In this case, the primary challenge was the recruitment of FBOs: despite high levels of initial interest from four FBOs, only one took part. However, it is likely that the proliferation of COVID-19 adversely impacted participation. Positively, analysis suggested that delivery of the trial’s intervention – proactively asking about customer’s food allergies/intolerances – may have a positive effect upon customer’s ‘trust’ in, and ‘satisfaction’ with, food outlets. This result should be further investigated in future fully powered RCTs.","McPhedran, Robert Patel Krishane Rayner Alice Patel Michelle Disson Joanna John Alice Porter Katharine Thornton Katie Toombs Ben",Food Control,197,11

Comunicação exossomal na transdiferenciação de células-tronco em cocultivo com células neuronais. 2017. 159 f. Tese (Doutorado em Ciências) Faculdade de Zootecnia e Engenharia de Alimentos, Universidade de São Paulo, Pirassununga, 2017. Células neuronais cocultivadas com células-tronco derivadas do tecido adiposo (ADSC) podem induzir estas últimas à transdiferenciação neuronal. No entanto, os processos de comunicação celular envolvidos nessa indução, e a funcionalidade da ADSC transdiferenciada in vivo, são desconhecidos. Recentemente, um novo tipo de comunicação celular mediada por vesículas extracelulares são indicados na modulação de diferentes eventos celulares como a diferenciação. Portanto, a hipótese, nesta proposta, foi identificar se o processo de diferenciação celular é mediado por vesículas extracelulares e se as células diferenciadas são capazes de atuar na regeneração de tecidos nas lesões do sistema nervoso periférico. Para tal, essa pesquisa foi dividida em duas fases: a primeira consiste no processo in vitro, com o objetivo de observar o processo de transição da ADSC para a linhagem neuronal e analisar a função da comunicação celular no processo de diferenciação; a segunda consistiu na avaliação in vivo da possível funcionalidade das ADSC diferenciadas. O camundongo foi o modelo animal utilizado (C57BL/6 e FVB). As ADSC e as células neuronais foram isoladas, cultivadas em cultivo primário e cocultivadas durante três, sete e 14 dias. Para a comprovação das mudanças fenotípicas das ADSC, realizou-se a imunolocalização com beta tubulina III e SNAP25 e PCR em tempo real (RT-qPCR) dos genes Map2 e Snap25. Seguido de analises de genes relacionados com a neurogênese. Adicionalmente, as vesículas extracelulares foram isoladas e utilizados para análises in vitro da diferenciação e análises gênicas e funcionais. Como resultado, verificou-se que as ADSC em cocultivo com neurônios podem se diferenciar em neuronais-like. Além disso, comprovou-se a comunicação por vesículas extracelulares entre neurônios e ADSC, e as vesículas extracelulares foram correlacionadas neste processo, pelo transporte da proteína SNAP25. Após estes resultados prosseguiu-se para a segunda fase deste trabalho, a etapa in vivo, que incidiu na utilização das ADSC cocultivadas por sete dias e avaliação funcional local e sistêmica no processo de regeneração do nervo ciático após neurotmese. Como resultado desta etapa as células-tronco cocultivadas modularam a lesão, e proporcionaram uma melhoria na funcionalidade após lesão. Conclui-se, através desta pesquisa, que as ADSC diferenciadas em neuronais-like, sob indução dos neurônios e suas vesículas extracelulares podem ser uma fonte celular alternativa no auxílio na regeneração de nervos periféricos.","ROBALLO, KELLY CRISTINE SANTOS",,197,10

Building on the Job Demands-Resources model, we examined day-level relationships between job demands, home demands and emotional exhaustion during telework. Moreover, we tested if leisure crafting (i.e., the proactive pursuit and enactment of leisure activities targeted at goal setting, socializing, growth and development) is negatively related to emotional exhaustion. We expected that proactive personality would be positively related to leisure crafting. Finally, emotional exhaustion was predicted to relate negatively to job performance. METHODS: We tested our assumptions using a daily diary study on seven consecutive days with 178 employees (964 observations in total). RESULTS: Multilevel path analysis supports the assumptions that daily job demands as well as daily home demands during telework are positively related to emotional exhaustion. As predicted, we found leisure crafting to be negatively related to emotional exhaustion, and proactive personality to be positively related to leisure crafting. Finally, emotional exhaustion was negatively related to job performance. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our study supports a health-promoting role of leisure crafting above the unfavorable relationships between job demands and home demands with emotional exhaustion.","Abdel Hadi, Sascha; Bakker, Arnold B; Häusser, Jan A",Anxiety Stress Coping,197,21

Methods: Narrative analysis conducted by a team of medical professionals and anthropologists. We purposefully selected 10 PC physicians in community-based hospitals and clinics and conducted a total of 17 individual and group interviews. The verbatim transcript data were analyzed using the conceptual framework of adaptive performance. Results: We identified three ""phases"" of the time period (January-May 2020). In Phase 1, PC physicians initially perceived the disease as a problem unrelated to them. In Phase 2, the Diamond Princess outbreak triggered adaptive performance of the physicians, who began to deal with medical issues related to COVID-19 by using social networking services and applying the collected information to their organization and/or communities. Following this, in Phase 3, the PC physicians' adaptive performance in their own communities and institutions emerged in the face of the pandemic. Reflecting their sensitivity to local context, the PC physicians were seen to exhibit adaptive performance through dealing with context-dependent problems and relationships. Conclusions: PC physicians exhibited adaptive performance in the course of coping with the realities of COVID-19 in shifting phases and in differing localities in the early stages of the pandemic. The trajectories of adaptive performance in later stages of the pandemic remain to be seen.","Haruta, Junji; Horiguchi, Sachiko; Miyachi, Junichiro; Teruyama, Junko; Kimura, Shuhei; Iida, Junko; Ozone, Sachiko; Goto, Ryohei; Kaneko, Makoto; Hama, Yusuke",,197,1

The MERS-CoV spike (S) glycoprotein mediates viral entry into target cells. For this, MERS-CoV S engages the host cell protein dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4, CD26) and the interface between MERS-CoV S and DPP4 has been resolved on the atomic level. Here, we asked whether naturally-occurring polymorphisms in DPP4, that alter amino acid residues required for MERS-CoV S binding, influence cellular entry of MERS-CoV. By screening of public databases, we identified fourteen such polymorphisms. Introduction of the respective mutations into DPP4 revealed that all except one (&#916;346-348) were compatible with robust DPP4 expression. Four polymorphisms (K267E, K267N, A291P and &#916;346-348) strongly reduced binding of MERS-CoV S to DPP4 and S protein-driven host cell entry, as determined using soluble S protein and S protein bearing rhabdoviral vectors, respectively. Two polymorphisms (K267E and A291P) were analyzed in the context of authentic MERS-CoV and were found to attenuate viral replication. Collectively, we identified naturally-occurring polymorphisms in DPP4 that negatively impact cellular entry of MERS-CoV and might thus modulate MERS development in infected patients.","Kleine-Weber, Hannah; Schroeder, Simon; Krüger, Nadine; Prokscha, Alexander; Naim, Hassan Y; Müller, Marcel A; Drosten, Christian; Pöhlmann, Stefan; Hoffmann, Markus",Emerg Microbes Infect,197,29

Compared to hand-labeled datasets, weak or inexact labels can be acquired in large quantities at significantly lower cost and can provide useful training signals for data-hungry models such as deep neural networks. We consider weak labels in the form of pseudo-labels and propose a semi-weakly supervised contrastive learning (SWCL) framework for representation learning using semi-weakly annotated images. Specifically, we train a semi-supervised model to propagate labels from a small dataset consisting of diverse image-level annotations to a large unlabeled dataset. Using the propagated labels, we generate a patch-level dataset for pretraining and formulate a multi-label contrastive learning objective to capture position-specific features encoded in each patch. We empirically validate the transfer learning performance of SWCL on seven public retinal fundus datasets, covering three disease classification tasks and two anatomical structure segmentation tasks. Our experiment results suggest that, under very low data regime, large-scale ImageNet pretraining on improved architecture remains a very strong baseline, and recently proposed self-supervised methods falter in segmentation tasks, possibly due to the strong invariant constraint imposed. Our method surpasses all prior self-supervised methods and standard cross-entropy training, while closing the gaps with ImageNet pretraining.","Yap, Boon Peng; Ng, Beng Koon",,197,5

OBJECTIVE: Characterize safety and occurrence of immediate relapses following COVID-19 vaccination in a large cohort of MS patients. METHODS: We assessed the safety of BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccination in adult MS patients. RESULTS: Between 20 December 2020 and 25 January 2021, 555 MS patients received the first dose of BNT162b2 vaccine and 435 received the second dose. There were three cases of COVID-19 infection encountered after the first dose. Safety profile of COVID-19 vaccine was characterized by pain at the injection site, fatigue, and headache. No increased risk of relapse activity was noted over a median follow-up of 20 and 38 days after first and second vaccine doses, respectively. The rate of patients with acute relapse was 2.1% and 1.6% following the first and second doses, respectively, similar to the rate in non-vaccinating patients during the corresponding period. Mild increase in the rate of adverse events was noted in younger patients (18-55 years), among patients with lower disability (Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) â©½3.0), and in patients treated with immunomodulatory drugs. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 BNT162b2 vaccine proved safe for MS patients. No increased risk of relapse activity was noted.","Achiron, Anat; Dolev, Mark; Menascu, Shay; Zohar, Daniela-Noa; Dreyer-Alster, Sapir; Miron, Shmuel; Shirbint, Emanuel; Magalashvili, David; Flechter, Shlomo; Givon, Uri; Guber, Diana; Stern, Yael; Polliack, Michael; Falb, Rina; Gurevich, Michael",Mult Scler,197,20

MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study is based on a cross-organisational and descriptive quantitative study conducted in spring 2013 (n = 556) and spring 2020 at the peak of the pandemic in Eastern Europe (n = 781) to identify the relationships and the changes in the satisfaction and burnout levels of healthcare professionals working in Slovenian nursing homes in rural areas, and on a qualitative study conducted in 2020, to identify in-depth relationships and changes in both studies during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: An increase in burnout syndromes between 2013 - 2020 was observed. The respondents experienced intensified emotional exhaustion and lack of personal accomplishment during the COVID-19 pandemic; however, depersonalisation did not differ statistically over the years. During the pandemic crisis, healthcare workers were less satisfied with their job than in spring 2013. Their job satisfaction was related to satisfaction with the work of nursing homes and with the work of state institutions and politicians who directly affected their working conditions and recognition in society. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic significantly exacerbated already existing burnout syndromes of nursing homes healthcare workers in Slovenian rural areas. Job satisfaction proved to be a relevant predictor of burnout syndrome. A negative correlation was observed between job satisfaction in 2020 and emotional exhaustion and personal accomplishment in 2013 and 2020.","Leskovic, Ljiljana; Erjavec, Karmen; Leskovar, Robert; Vukovic, Goran",Ann Agric Environ Med,197,16

Several occupational risk factors are challenging healthcare workers (HCWs) who are at high risk of mental health outcomes, including Burnout Syndrome (BOS). BOS is a psychological syndrome characterized by emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and low personal accomplishment. An umbrella review of systematic reviews and meta-analyses concerning BOS and coronavirus (SARS/MERS/SARS-CoV-2) outbreaks was carried out on PubMed Central/Medline, Cochrane Library, PROSPERO, and Epistemonikos databases. Data relating to COVID-19 is insufficient, but in previous SARS and MERS outbreaks about one-third of HCWs manifested BOS. This prevalence rate is similar to the figure recorded in some categories of HCWs exposed to chronic occupational stress and poor work organization during non-epidemic periods. Inadequate organization and worsening working conditions during an epidemic appear to be the most likely causes of BOS. Preventive care and workplace health promotion programs could be useful for protecting healthcare workers during pandemics, as well as during regular health activities.","Magnavita, N.; Chirico, F.; Garbarino, S.; Bragazzi, N.

METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted among 190 healthy female undergraduate students at Taibah University, Madinah, Saudi Arabia. Demographic, knowledge and attitudes toward added sugar, dietary intake, and anthropometric data (i.e., height, weight, and waist circumference) were collected during face-to-face interviews. RESULTS: Approximately half of the students (n = 106; 55.8%) were aware of the health consequences of excessive intake of added sugar, but only 32.6% (n = 62) reported making an effort to reduce their added sugar intake. The data indicated that 8.42% of the students (n = 16) consumed carbonated soft drinks daily, 15.8% (n = 30) consumed fruit drinks daily, and 45.8% (n = 87) consumed sweets daily. Underweight students consumed higher quantities of added sugar (expressed as percent of total energy intake) compared with students in all other weight status groups. Results showed negative associations between percentage of added sugar intake and intakes of fiber, iron, zinc, vitamin D, body mass index, and waist circumference. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicated that a large proportion of young women had limited knowledge on the health consequences of excessive added sugar intakes. The observed inverse relationships between added sugar and micronutrient intakes and the weight status highlight the urgent need for expanded efforts to improve added sugar-related knowledge and promote the reduction of added sugar intake among young women.","Mumena, Walaa A; Alamri, Asma A; Mahrous, Alhanouf A; Alharbi, Bushra M; Almohaimeed, Jumanah S; Hakeem, Maysaa I; Kutbi, Hebah A",Nutrition,197,1

However, the external price shocks can result in a higher level of volatility as well as domestic policy instability. Therefore, an efficient risk measure and hedging strategies are needed to help investors protect their investments against this risk. In this paper, a daily systemic risk measure, called FRM (Financial Risk Meter) is proposed. The FRM-EM is applied to capture systemic risk behavior embedded in the returns of the 25 largest EMs FIs, covering the BRIMST (Brazil, Russia, India, Mexico, South Africa, and Turkey), and thereby reflects the financial linkages between these economies. Concerning the Macro factors, in addition to the Adrian and Brunnermeier (2016) Macro, we include the EM sovereign yield spread over respective US Treasuries and the above-mentioned countries currencies. The results indicated that the FRM of EMs FIs reached its maximum during the US financial crisis following by COVID 19 crisis and the Macro factors explain the BRIMST FIs with various degrees of sensibility. We then study the relationship between those factors and the tail event network behavior to build our policy recommendations to help the investors to choose the suitable market for in-vestment and tail-event optimized portfolios. For that purpose, an overlapping region between portfolio optimization strategies and FRM network centrality is developed. We propose a robust and well-diversified tail-event and cluster risk-sensitive portfolio allocation model and compare it to more classical approaches","Amor, Souhir Ben; Althof, Michael; Hardle, Wolfgang Karl",,197,10

There is growing evidence that the reasons for this difference are multi-factorial and need further exploration. AIM: The aim of this study was to understand better, perceptions of risk and responses to covid-19 of members of the Muslim community living in the North West of England, and to understand the facilitators and barriers to adherence to restrictions and guidance measures. METHOD: A total of 47 participants took part in 25 in-depth qualitative interviews and four focus groups (n=22) that explored perceptions of risk and responses to risk from covid-19. Data were analysed thematically. FINDINGS: Participants were aware of the mechanism of transmission of covid-19 and took steps to mitigate risk of transmission including, observing a range of hygiene practices and following social distancing guidance. Increased risk of covid-19 for BAME populations was explained largely in terms of exposure to the virus due to the types of employment people from BAME populations are employed in. Limitations both within the working environment and more generally in public spaces, was identified as problematic for effective social distancing. The closure of mosques sent out a strong message about the seriousness of the virus and religious teachings reinforced hygiene and social distancing guidelines. CONCLUSION: Across society there are people that adhere to restrictions and guidelines and those that do not. Improving local information provision and communication pathways during times of the pandemic, could aid understanding of risk and promote adherence to social distancing restrictions.","Hassan, Shaima M; Ring, Adele; Tahir, Naheed; Gabbay, Mark",BMC Public Health,197,1

In viral diseases, the replication of viruses is seemingly stimulated by an imbalance between pro-oxidant and antioxidant activity as well as by the deprivation of antioxidant mechanisms. In COVID-19 pneumonia, oxidative stress also appears to be highly detrimental to lung tissues. Although inhaling ozone (O3) gas has been shown to be toxic to the lungs, recent evidence suggests that its administration via appropriate routes and at small doses can paradoxically induce an adaptive reaction capable of decreasing the endogenous oxidative stress. Ozone therapy is recommended to counter the disruptive effects of severe COVID-19 on lung tissues, especially if administered in early stages of the disease, thereby preventing the progression to ARDS.","Izadi, Morteza; Cegolon, Luca; Javanbakht, Mohammad; Sarafzadeh, Ali; Abolghasemi, Hassan; Alishiri, Gholamhossein; Zhao, Shi; Einollahi, Behzad; Kashaki, Mandana; Jonaidi-Jafari, Nematollah; Asadi, Mosa; Jafari, Ramezan; Fathi, Saeid; Nikoueinejad, Hassan; Ebrahimi, Mehrdad; Imanizadeh, Sina; Ghazale, Amir Hosein",Int Immunopharmacol,197,16

To identify possible antibody binding sites, we performed multi-microsecond molecular dynamics simulations of a 4.1 million atom system containing a patch of viral membrane with four full-length, fully glycosylated and palmitoylated S proteins. By mapping steric accessibility, structural rigidity, sequence conservation, and generic antibody binding signatures, we recover known epitopes on S and reveal promising epitope candidates for structure-based vaccine design. We find that the extensive and inherently flexible glycan coat shields a surface area larger than expected from static structures, highlighting the importance of structural dynamics. The protective glycan shield and the high flexibility of its hinges give the stalk overall low epitope scores. Our computational epitope-mapping procedure is general and should thus prove useful for other viral envelope proteins whose structures have been characterized.","Sikora, Mateusz; von Bülow, Sören; Blanc, Florian E C; Gecht, Michael; Covino, Roberto; Hummer, Gerhard",PLoS Comput Biol,197,16

We further demonstrate that mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation protein 1 (MALT1) protease was constitutively active in psoriatic CD4+ and Î³Î´ T cells, thereby supporting GLS1 expression by stabilizing c-Jun, which directly binds to the GLS1 promoter region. Blocking the activity of either GLS1 or MALT1 protease resolved Th17 and Î³Î´ T17 cell differentiation and epidermal hyperplasia in the psoriasis-like mouse models. Finally, IL-17A enhanced GLS1 expression via the MALT1/cJun pathway in keratinocytes, resulting in hyperproliferation of and chemokine production by keratinocytes.

METHODS: A cohort of OCD patients, actively treated with Exposure and Response Prevention [ERP] combined with pharmacological treatment, was evaluated as part of their regular psychiatric assessment twice: 113 patients were evaluated at their two-month follow-up, and 90 patients (from that cohort), were evaluated at their six-month follow up. RESULTS: Eighty-four percent of the patients at the two-month follow-up and 96% of the patients at the six-month follow-up did not show OC symptom deterioration. The results were also replicated in the OCD subgroup that included contamination (washers) and patients with illness obsessions who were believed to be particularly vulnerable, considering their obsessional content. CONCLUSION: OCD patients (including those with obsessions related to contamination and health) who are under an active ERP and pharmacological treatment, did not experience exacerbated symptoms during COVID-19 at their two- and six-month follow-ups.","Carmi, Lior; Ben-Arush, Oded; Fostick, Leah; Cohen, Hagit; Zohar, Joseph",Int. j. neuropsychopharmacol,197,12

The spectrum of acute neurological dysfunctions may implicate direct viral invasion, para-infectious complications, neurological manifestations of systemic diseases, or co-incident neurological dysfunction in the context of high SARS-CoV-2 prevalence. A rapid and pragmatic approach to understanding the prevalence, phenotypes, pathophysiology and prognostic implications of COVID-19 neurological syndromes is urgently needed. METHODS: The Global Consortium to Study Neurological dysfunction in COVID-19 (GCS-NeuroCOVID), endorsed by the Neurocritical Care Society (NCS), was rapidly established to address this need in a tiered approach. Tier-1 consists of focused, pragmatic, low-cost, observational common data element (CDE) collection, which can be launched immediately at many sites in the first phase of this pandemic and is designed for expedited ethical board review with waiver-of-consent. Tier 2 consists of prospective functional and cognitive outcomes assessments with more detailed clinical, laboratory and radiographic data collection that would require informed consent. Tier 3 overlays Tiers 1 and 2 with experimental molecular, electrophysiology, pathology and imaging studies with longitudinal outcomes assessment and would require centers with specific resources. A multicenter pediatrics core has developed and launched a parallel study focusing on patients ages <18 years. Study sites are eligible for participation if they provide clinical care to COVID-19 patients and are able to conduct patient-oriented research under approval of an internal or global ethics committee. Hospitalized pediatric and adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 and with acute neurological signs or symptoms are eligible to participate. The primary study outcome is the overall prevalence of neurological complications among hospitalized COVID-19 patients, which will be calculated by pooled estimates of each neurological finding divided by the average census of COVID-19 positive patients over the study period. Secondary outcomes include: in-hospital, 30 and 90-day morality, discharge modified Rankin score, ventilator-free survival, ventilator days, discharge disposition, and hospital length of stay. RESULTS: In a one-month period (3/27/20-4/27/20) the GCS-NeuroCOVID consortium was able to recruit 71 adult study sites, representing 17 countries and 5 continents and 34 pediatrics study sites. CONCLUSIONS: This is one of the first large-scale global research collaboratives urgently assembled to evaluate acute neurological events in the context of a pandemic. The innovative and pragmatic tiered study approach has allowed for rapid recruitment and activation of numerous sites across the world-an approach essential to capture real-time critical neurological data to inform treatment strategies in this pandemic crisis.","Frontera, Jennifer; Mainali, Shraddha; Fink, Ericka L; Robertson, Courtney L; Schober, Michelle; Ziai, Wendy; Menon, David; Kochanek, Patrick M; Suarez, Jose I; Helbok, Raimund; McNett, Molly; Chou, Sherry H-Y",Neurocrit Care,197,17

OBJECTIVES: This meta-analysis study explored the association between short-term exposure to air pollution and suicide mortality, with an emphasis on different lag times. METHODS: A systematic search was used to find relevant studies in databases including Scopus, Web of Knowledge, Pubmed, and Embase published up to 19 May 2020. The inclusion criteria included case-crossover or time-series studies assessing the association of criteria air pollutants with suicide mortality at different Lag Days of 0-7 (LD0 to LD7) and Cumulative Lags of 1-7 days (CL1 to CL7). Odds ratios (OR) were calculated with 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: Of 1436 retrieved articles, 11 were eligible for data extraction, representing data on 283,550 suicides published between 2010 and 2019. The odds of suicide death increase with each 10 µg/m3 increase in the mean concentrations of NO2 at CL1 (1.013: 1.006-1.021), CL2 (1.028: 1.003-1.053), CL3 (1.035: 1.001-1.070), and LD2 (1.011: 1.001-1.022), SO2 at CL1 (1.024: 1.014-1.034), CL2 (1.030: 1.012-1.048), CL3 (1.029: 1.009-1.049), and CL4 (1.027: 1.005-1.049), O3 at CL6 (1.008: 1.000-1.016), PM10 at CL1 (1.004: 1.000-1.008), and PM2.5 at CL1 (1.017: 1.003-1.031). Besides, the odds of suicide death increases with each 0.5 mg/m3 increase in the mean concentration of CO at LD6 (1.005: 1.000-1.011). However, it decreased with increased O3 exposure at LD3 (0.997: 0.994-1.000). CONCLUSION: The study supports a positive association between air pollution and suicide mortality. No immediate risk was elucidated but the possible effects seem to be exerted cumulatively.","Davoudi, Mojtaba; Barjasteh-Askari, Fateme; Amini, Homayoun; Lester, David; Mahvi, Amir Hossein; Ghavami, Vahid; Rezvani Ghalhari, Mohammad",Sci Total Environ,197,2

Lower health literacy and higher mortality rates in the homeless and vulnerable population compared with the background population potentially leaves this group or people more exposed to COVID-19. This study assessed the vulnerable population of Aarhus in relation to COVID-19 infection. METHODS: Participants were tested during a six-day period in April and a four-day period in June at drop-in centres, injection rooms and homeless shelters in Aarhus. Oropharyngeal swab tests were performed and analysed with real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Test days in June were supplemented with lateral flow tests for immunoglobulin (Ig) G and IgM. Prevalence and corresponding Wilson 95% confidence intervals were computed. RESULTS: We tested 295 individuals in April and 141 individuals in June. All oropharyngeal swabs were COVID-19 negative. The lateral flow tests were IgM-positive in six of 129 individuals (4.7%) and IgG-positive less than five of 129 (less than 3.9%) individuals. On the day of testing, COVID-19 symptoms such as fever, coughing and/or sore throat were found in 63 of 240 (26.3%) of the participants in April and in 26 of 123 (21.1%) in June. In the April testing round, 175 of 291 (59.9%) reported to be born in Denmark. The corresponding number for the June testing round was 84 of 138 (60.9%). CONCLUSIONS: Despite their vulnerable profile, the vulnerable citizens tested in Aarhus were not infected with COVID-19 at the testing day and very few participants carried antibodies. FUNDING: Testing was funded by Aarhus University Hospital.

For automatic analysis of images, they are represented in machines by a set of semantic features. Deep Learning (DL) models are widely used to extract features from images. General deep features may not be appropriate to represent chest x-rays as they have a few semantic regions. Though the Bag of Visual Words (BoVW) based features are shown to be more appropriate for x-ray type of images, existing BoVW features may not capture enough information to differentiate COVID-19 infection from other pneumonia-related infections. In this paper, we propose a new BoVW method over deep features, called Bag of Deep Visual Words (BoDVW), by removing the feature map normalization step and adding deep features normalization step on the raw feature maps. This helps to preserve the semantics of each feature map that may have important clues to differentiate COVID-19 from pneumonia. We evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed BoDVW features in chest x-rays classification using Support Vector Machine (SVM) to diagnose COVID-19. Our results on a publicly available COVID-19 x-ray dataset reveal that our features produce stable and prominent classification accuracy, particularly differentiating COVID-19 infection from other pneumonia, in shorter computation time compared to the state-of-the-art methods. Thus, our method could be a very useful tool for quick diagnosis of COVID-19 patients on a large scale.","Sitaula, Chiranjibi Aryal Sunil",Electrical Engineering and Systems Science,197,17

Our objective was to examine patient antibody responses following COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma (CCP) transfusion and compare responses to CCP from vaccinated and nonvaccinated donors. Materials and methodsPlasma samples were obtained from 25 recipients of CCP and COVID-19 antibody levels measured before and after CCP treatment. Factors that effect antibody levels were examined. ResultsIn the 21 patients who received CCP from nonvaccinated donors, only modest increases in antibody levels were observed. Patients who received two units were more likely to seroconvert than those receiving just one unit. The strongest predictor of changes in patient antibody level was the CCP dose. Using patient plasma volume and donor antibody level, the post-transfusion antibody level could be predicted with remarkable accuracy. In contrast, the 4 patients who received CCP from vaccinated donors all had dramatic increases in antibody levels following transfusion of a single unit. In this subset of recipients, antibody levels observed after transfusion of CCP were comparable to those seen in donors who had fully recovered from COVID-19. ConclusionIf available, CCP from vaccinated donors with very high antibody levels should be used. CCP from vaccinated donors increases patient antibody levels much more than 1 or 2 units of CCP from unvaccinated donors.","Leon, Judith; Merrill, Anna; Rogers, Kai; Kurt, Julie; Dempewolf, Spencer; Ehlers, Alexandra; Jackson, Brooks; Knudson, Mike",,197,21

The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 harbors a furin cleavage site insertion in contrast to SARS-CoV, which may be related to its stronger communicability. An avian coronavirus with an extra furin cleavage site upstream of the fusion peptide (S2' site) infected monocyte cells and neuron cells leading to viremia or encephalitis, respectively. Immunohistochemistry and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction were used to follow disease progression and demonstrated differences between the parent avian coronavirus and mutated avian coronavirus with a furin-S2' site. Magnetic resonance imaging and biological dye to evaluate the blood-brain barrier permeability showed that avian coronavirus with a furin-S2' site had increased permeability compared with parent avian coronavirus. Immunohistochemistry of brains after intracerebral injection of avian coronavirus and immunofluorescence staining of primary neuron cells demonstrated the furin-S2' site expanded the cell tropism of the mutant avian coronavirus to neuron cells. TNF-&#945;, which has a key role in blood-brain barrier permeability, was highly induced by avian coronavirus with a furin-S2' site compared with the parent avian coronavirus. We demonstrated the process involved in mutant avian coronavirus-induced disease and that the addition of a furin-S2' site changed the virus cell tropism.IMPORTANCECoronaviruses have broken out three times in two decades. Spike (S) protein plays a key role in the process of infection. To clarify importance of furin cleavage site in spike protein for coronavirus, we investigated the pathogenesis of neurotropic avian coronavirus whose spike protein contains an extra furin cleavage site (furin-S2' site). By combining real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry we demonstrated that infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) infects brain instead of trachea when its S protein contains furin-S2' site. Moreover, the virus was shown to increase the permeability of blood-brain barrier, infect neuron cells and induce high expression of TNF-&#945;. Based on these results we further show that furin cleavage site in S protein plays an important role in coronavirus pathogenicity and cell tropism. Our study extends previous publications on function of S protein of coronavirus, increasing the understanding of researchers to coronavirus.","Cheng, Jinlong; Zhao, Ye; Hu, Yanxin; Zhao, Jing; Xue, Jia; Zhang, Guozhong",J. virol,197,22

In the study we analysed the comparison and agreement between the feasibility of using the saliva in comparison to NPS for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: A total number of 74 patients were enrolled for this study. We analysed and compared the NPS and saliva specimen collected within 48 h after the symptom onset. We carried out real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), gene sequencing for the detection and determination SARS-CoV-2 specific genes. Phylogenetic tree was constructed to establish the isolation of viral RNA from saliva. We used Bland-Altman model to identify the agreement between two specimens. RESULTS: This study showed a lower cycle threshold (CT ) mean value for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 ORF1 gene (mean 27.07; 95% CI, 25.62 to 28.52) in saliva methods than that of NPS (mean 28.24; 95% CI, 26.62 to 29.85) specimen although the difference is statistically non-significant (p>0.05). Bland-Altman analysis produced relatively smaller bias and high agreement between these two clinical specimens. Phylogenetic analysis with the RdRp and S gene confirmed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the saliva samples.

The nucleic acid detection is essential for the early diagnosis of diseases. Here, we propose a method called PLCR (PfAgo coupled with modified Ligase Chain Reaction for nucleic acid detection) which utilizes PfAgo to only use DNA guides longer than 14-mer to specifically cleave DNA and LCR to precisely distinguish single-base mismatch. PLCR can detect DNA or RNA without PCR at attomolar sensitivities, distinguish single base mutation between the genome of wild type SARS-CoV-2 and its mutant spike D614G, effectively distinguish the novel coronavirus from other coronaviruses and finally achieve multiplexed detection in 70 min. Additionally, LCR products can be directly used as DNA guides without additional input guides to simplify primer design. With desirable sensitivity, specificity and simplicity, the method can be extended for detecting other pathogenic microorganisms.","Wang, Longyu; He, Ruyi; Lv, Bin; Yu, Xiao; Liu, Yang; Yang, Jun; Li, Wenqiang; Wang, Yuan; Zhang, Hang; Yan, Guangbo; Mao, Wuxiang; Liu, Linlin; Wang, Fei; Ma, Lixin",Talanta,197,1

We evaluated clinical characteristics and outcomes of these patients who were admitted to the EMU. Nineteen patients were admitted (one patient twice) with average age of 36.26 years (11 female) and average length of stay 3 days (range: 2-9 days). At least one event was captured on continuous EEG (cEEG) and video monitoring in all 20 admissions (atypical in one). One patient had both epileptic (ES) and psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES) while 10 had PNES and 9 had ES. In 8 of 9 patients with ES, medications were changed, while in 5 patients with PNES, anti-epileptic drugs (AED) were stopped; the remaining 5 were not on medications. Of the 14 patients who had seen an epileptologist pre-admission, 13 (or 93%) had their diagnosis confirmed by EMU stay; a statistically significant finding. While typically an elective admission, in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic, urgent and emergent EMU admissions were required for increased seizure or event frequency.

In this study, we describe the impact of COVID-19 on neurosurgical training in Southeast Asia. METHODS: We conducted an online survey among neurosurgery residents in Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand from May 22 to 31, 2020 using Google Forms. The 33-item questionnaire collected data on elective and emergency neurosurgical operations, ongoing learning activities, and health worker safety. RESULTS: A total of 298 of 470 neurosurgery residents completed the survey, equivalent to a 63% response rate. The decrease in elective neurosurgical operations in Indonesia and in the Philippines (median, 100% for both) was significantly greater compared with other countries (P < 0.001). For emergency operations, trainees in Indonesia and Malaysia had a significantly greater reduction in their caseload (median, 80% and 70%, respectively) compared with trainees in Singapore and Thailand (median, 20% and 50%, respectively; P < 0.001). Neurosurgery residents were most concerned about the decrease in their hands-on surgical experience, uncertainty in their career advancement, and occupational safety in the workplace. Most of the residents (n = 221, 74%) believed that the COVID-19 crisis will have a negative impact on their neurosurgical training overall. CONCLUSIONS: An effective national strategy to control COVID-19 is crucial to sustain neurosurgical training and to provide essential neurosurgical services. Training programs in Southeast Asia should consider developing online learning modules and setting up simulation laboratories to allow trainees to systematically acquire knowledge and develop practical skills during these challenging times.","Wittayanakorn, Nunthasiri; Nga, Vincent Diong Weng; Sobana, Mirna; Bahuri, Nor Faizal Ahmad; Baticulon, Ronnie E",World Neurosurg,197,21

Until now, SARS-CoV-2 has been identified as the seventh member of the coronavirus family capable of infecting humans. In the past two decades, humankind has experienced outbreaks triggered by two other extremely infective members of the coronavirus family; the MERS-CoV and the SARS-CoV. According to several investigations, SARS-CoV causes proteinuria and renal impairment or failure. The SARS-CoV was identified in the distal convoluted tubules of the kidney of infected patients. Also, renal dysfunction was observed in numerous cases of MERS-CoV infection. And recently, during the 2019-nCoV pandemic, it was found that the novel coronavirus not only induces acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) but also can induce damages in various organs including the liver, heart, and kidney. The kidney tissue and its cells are targeted massively by the coronaviruses due to the abundant presence of ACE2 and Dpp4 receptors on kidney cells. These receptors are characterized as the main route of coronavirus entry to the victim cells. Renal failure due to massive viral invasion can lead to undesirable complications and enhanced mortality rate, thus more attention should be paid to the pathology of coronaviruses in the kidney. Here, we have provided the most recent knowledge on the coronaviruses (SARS, MERS, and COVID19) pathology and the mechanisms of their impact on the kidney tissue and functions.

METHODS: A total of 60 treatment-naïve patients with macular edema who underwent intravitreal aflibercept injections (2 mg/0.05 mL) with at least one year of follow-up were analyzed in this retrospective and comparative study. The patients were divided into two groups according to the number of intravitreal aflibercept injections administered in the loading phase. The 3+PRN group comprised 27 patients, whereas the 5+PRN group comprised 33 patients. The visual and anatomical outcomes were compared between the two groups at baseline and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. RESULTS: Both 3+PRN and 5+PRN, showed statistically significant improvements in the best-corrected visual acuity and central macular thicknesse throughout the study period (p<0.001 and, p<0.001, respectively). There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of changes in the best-corrected visual acuity and central macular thickness (p=0.453 and, p=0.784, respectively).

While control measures, such as quarantine, lockdown and social distancing, reduce infections and infection-related deaths, they have severe negative economic and social consequences. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to explore the acceptability of different infectious disease control measures, and examine how respondents trade off between economic and health outcomes. METHODS: A discrete choice experiment was developed, with attributes covering: control restrictions, duration of restrictions, tracking, number of infections and of deaths, unemployment, government expenditure and additional personal tax. A representative sample of Australians (n = 1046) completed the survey, which included eight choice tasks. Data were analysed using mixed logit regression to identify heterogeneity and latent class models to examine heterogeneity. RESULTS: In general, respondents had strong preferences for policies that avoided high infection-related deaths, although lower unemployment and government expenditure were also considered important. Respondents preferred a shorter duration for restrictions, but their preferences did not vary significantly for the differing levels of control measures. In terms of tracking, respondents preferred mobile phone tracking or bracelets when compared to no tracking. Significant differences in preferences was identified, with two distinct classes: Class 1 (57%) preferred the economy to remain open with some control measures, whereas Class 2 (43%), had stronger preferences for policies that reduced avoidable deaths. CONCLUSIONS: This study found that the Australian population is willing to relinquish some freedom, in the short term, and trade off the negative social and economic impacts of the pandemic, to avoid the negative health consequences.","Manipis, Kathleen; Street, Deborah; Cronin, Paula; Viney, Rosalie; Goodall, Stephen",Patient,197,16

To combat the growing pandemic on urgent basis, there is need to design effective solutions using new techniques that could exploit recent technology, such as machine learning, deep learning, big data, artificial intelligence, Internet of Things, for identification and tracking of COVID-19 cases in near real time. These technologies have offered inexpensive and rapid solution for proper screening, analyzing, prediction and tracking of COVID-19 positive cases. In this paper, a detailed review of the role of AI as a decisive tool for prognosis, analyze, and tracking the COVID-19 cases is performed. We searched various databases including Google Scholar, IEEE Library, Scopus and Web of Science using a combination of different keywords consisting of COVID-19 and AI. We have identified various applications, where AI can help healthcare practitioners in the process of identification and monitoring of COVID-19 cases. A compact summary of the corona virus cases are first highlighted, followed by the application of AI. Finally, we conclude the paper by highlighting new research directions and discuss the research challenges. Even though scientists and researchers have gathered and exchanged sufficient knowledge over last couple of months, but this structured review also examined technological perspectives while encompassing the medical aspect to help the healthcare practitioners, policymakers, decision makers, policymakers, AI scientists and virologists to quell this infectious COVID-19 pandemic outbreak.","Rasheed, Jawad; Jamil, Akhtar; Hameed, Alaa Ali; Al-Turjman, Fadi; Rasheed, Ahmad",Interdiscip Sci,197,1

RESULTS: The proband, a 2-year-old Chinese girl, presented with global developmental delay, intellectual disability, distinctive facial features and multiple congenital anomalies. Her prenatal manifestations included increased nuchal thickness, cranial and facial anomalies, and decreased fetal movement. WES has identified a novel variant in the CHD4 gene, namely NM_001273:c.2989C>G (p.Leu997Val) (GRCh37/hg19).Comparison of her phenotype with previously reported SIHIWES cases suggested that our patient's prenatal presentations were unreported before, with novel features including funduscopic anomaly, facial dysmorphisms such as asymmetrical ears, drooping eyelid, long philtrum and downturned mouth. CONCLUSION: Above findings have expanded the mutational spectrum of the CHD4 gene and revealed novel phenotypes in Chinese patients with SIHIWES.","Zhou, Xinlong; Wang, Qingming; Liu, Yanhui; Liu, Jianxin; Yuan, Haiming",Zhonghua Yi Xue Yi Chuan Xue Za Zhi,197,12

Inspired by processes encountered in nature, where insects and animals often rely on strain and temperature to alter the optical appearance of dispersed liquid crystalline elements, chiral droplets are dispersed in polymer films and deformation induced by uniaxial or biaxial stretching. Our measurements are interpreted by resorting to simulations of the corresponding systems, thereby providing an in-depth understanding of the morphologies that arise in these materials.

Aims: The aim of the present work was to develop a scale (Compulsive Sexual Behavior Disorder Scale-CSBD-19) that can reliably and validly assess CSBD based on ICD-11 diagnostic guidelines. Method: Four independent samples of 9,325 individuals completed self-reported measures from three countries (the United States, Hungary, and Germany). The psychometric properties of the CSBD-19 were examined in terms of factor structure, reliability, measurement invariance, and theoretically relevant correlates. A potential threshold was determined to identify individuals with an elevated risk of CSBD. Results: The five-factor model of the CSBD-19 (i.e., control, salience, relapse, dissatisfaction, and negative consequences) had an excellent fit to the data and demonstrated appropriate associations with the correlates. Measurement invariance suggested that the CSBD-19 functions similarly across languages. Men had higher means than women. A score of 50 points was found as an optimal threshold to identify individuals at high-risk of CSBD. Conclusions: The CSBD-19 is a short, valid, and reliable measure of potential CSBD based on ICD-11 diagnostic guidelines. Its use in large-scale, cross-cultural studies may promote the identification and understanding of individuals with a high risk of CSBD.","Bothe, Beáta; Potenza, Marc N; Griffiths, Mark D; Kraus, Shane W; Klein, Verena; Fuss, Johannes; Demetrovics, Zsolt",J. behav. addict.

There is a need for agility in clinical research, and the use of data science to develop predictive models for patient treatment is a potential solution. However, rapidly developing predictive models in healthcare is challenging given the complexity of healthcare problems and the lack of regular interaction between data scientists and physicians. Data scientists can spend significant time working in isolation to build predictive models that may not be useful in clinical environments. We propose the use of an agile data science framework based on the Scrumban framework used in software development. Scrumban is an iterative framework, where in each iteration larger problems are broken down into simple do-able tasks for data scientists and physicians. The two sides collaborate closely in formulating clinical questions and developing and deploying predictive models into clinical settings. Physicians can provide feedback or new hypotheses given the performance of the model, and refinement of the model or clinical questions can take place in the next iteration. The rapid development of predictive models can now be achieved with increasing numbers of publicly available healthcare datasets and easily accessible cloud-based data science tools. What is truly needed are data scientist and physician partnerships ensuring close collaboration between the two sides in using these tools to develop clinically useful predictive models to meet the demands of the COVID-19 healthcare landscape.","Lei, Howard; O039,; Connell, Ryan; Ehwerhemuepha, Louis; Taraman, Sharief; Feaster, William; Chang, Anthony",Intell Based Med,197,1

Retrospective single cohort study on patients with suspected Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and asymptomatic Healthcare Workers, enrolled from March to April 2020. Subjects had quantitative PCR (qPCR) test for detection of SARS-CoV-2 via nasal swab and serological testing using the COVID-19 IgG/ IgM Rapid Test (PRIMA Lab SA) immunochromatographic assay. Some subjects underwent chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA) after rapid test. The aim of the study was to analyse the proportion of those who developed a positive IgM/IgG response for SARS-CoV-2. The correspondence between the results from rapid testing and CLIA, when available, was evaluated. 97 subjects underwent qPCR for SARS-CoV-2 through nasal swab, which resulted positive in 40/43 (93.0%) of symptomatic patients, 2/40 (5%) of asymptomatic HCW, in no subjects with suspected COVID- 19 (clinical and radiological findings) then excluded by repeated nasal swabs and alternative diagnosis (COVID-19-negative patients, CNPs), and in 6/6 (100%) of patients with confirmed diagnosis and negative follow-up nasal swabs (COVID-19-recovered patients, CRPs). IgM resulted positive in 8/43 (18.6%) of symptomatic patients and in 1/6 (16.7%) of CRPs. IgG resulted positive in 36/43 (83.7%) of symptomatic patients, 2/40 (5%) of HCW, and in 1/8 (12.5%) and 6/6 (100%) of CNPs and CRPs, respectively. A comparison between an IgG/IgM Rapid Test and a following CLIA test showed consistency in negative results in 25/28 of HCW and 8/8 of CNPs tested. Our preliminary data support the role of IgG/IgM Rapid Test (PRIMA Lab SA) immunochromatographic assay as a point-of-care test that may complement molecular tests in the screening of SARS-CoV-2 carriers. The test may gain particular relevance in shortening the time needed to refer patients to a COVID or non-COVID Hospital area and to achieve diagnosis in patients with persistently negative nasal swabs.","Canetti, Diana; Dell039,; Acqua, Raffaele; Riccardi, Niccolò; Della Torre, Liviana; Bigoloni, Alba; Muccini, Camilla; Bruzzesi, Elena; Ranzenigo, Martina; Chiurlo, Matteo; Racca, Sara; Galli, Cristina; Castagna, Antonella; Tambussi, Giuseppe; Lazzarin, Adriano",New Microbiol,197,10

METHOD: Ecological study based on population and death data for the months of March 2016 to 2020 in Castilla y León. The general and provincial standardized rates, the relative risks of the year 2020 with respect to previous years and the risks adjusted by sex, periods and province, using Poisson regression, were calculated. Trend analysis was performed using joinpoint linear regression. RESULTS: An increase in mortality was observed in March 2020 with respect to previous years, with an increase of 39% for men (relative risk [RR]: 1.39; 95% confidence interval [95%CI]: 1.32-1.47) and 28% for women (RR: 1.28; 95%CI: 1.21-1.35). The model predicts excess mortality of 775 deaths. In the trend analysis there is a significant turning point in 2019 in men, globally and for almost all provinces. The increase in mortality is general, although heterogeneous by sex, age group and province. CONCLUSIONS: Although the observed increase in mortality cannot be totally attributed to the disease, it is the best estimate we have of the real impact on deaths directly or indirectly related to it. The number of declared deaths only reaches two thirds of the increase in mortality observed.","Ochoa Sangrador, Carlos; Garmendia Leiza, José Ramón; Pérez Boillos, María José; Pastrana Ara, Fernando; Lorenzo Lobato, María Del Pilar; Andrés de Llano, Jesús María","Gac. sanit.

BACKGROUND: Clinicians at the forefront of care are well positioned to lead on research to improve outcomes and experiences of patients but some professional groups continue to be underrepresented. Inequities persist alongside robust national infrastructures to support Clinical Academic Careers for non-medical health professionals, further highlighting the need to address local infrastructure and leadership to successfully build research capacity. DESIGN: An evolving programme of inquiry and analysis was established in one organisation, this included targeted interventions to mitigate barriers and enable research capacity and capability. METHODS: An all-staff survey was conducted in 2015 to understand the existing research culture. Interventions were put in place, evaluated through a second survey (2018), and focus group interviews with staff who had accessed interventions. RESULTS: Respondents demonstrated high levels of interest and commitment to research at the individual level which were not always harnessed at the organisational level. Inequities between professional groups existed in terms of training, time to undertake research and opportunities and outputs. Follow-up revealed continuing structural barriers at an organisational level, however at an individual level, interventions were reflected in >30 fellowship awards; major concerns were reported about sustaining these research ambitions. CONCLUSIONS: Success in building a research-active clinical workforce is multifactorial and all professional groups report increasing challenges to undertake research alongside clinical responsibilities. Individuals report concerns about the depth and pace of cultural change to sustain Clinical Academic Careers and build a truly organisation-wide research hospital ethos to benefit patients. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The achievements of individual nurses and allied health professionals indicate that with supportive infrastructure, capacity, cognisance and capability are not insurmountable barriers for determined clinicians. We use the standards for reporting organisational case studies to report our findings (Rodgers et al., 2016 Health Services and Delivery Research, 4 and 1).","Oulton, Kate; Wray, Jo; Kelly, Paula; Khair, Kate; Sell, Debbie; Gibson, Faith",J. clin. nurs,197,1

Our analysis show that: (i) in many cases the epidemic curve can be described by a Gaussian-type function; (ii) the temporal evolution of the accumulative number of infections and fatalities follow a logistic function; (iii) the key role played by the quarantine to block the spread of Covid-19 in terms of an interacting parameter between people. In the frame of elementary percolation theory, we show that: (i) the percolation probability can be associated with the probability of a person being infected with Covid-19; (ii) the concepts of blocked and non-blocked connections can be associated, respectively, with a person respecting or not the social distancing.

Decades of data and dynamical analyses of how other viruses spread and interact with host cells could shed light on SARS-CoV-2 within-host trajectories. We review how common axes of variation in within-host dynamics and emergent pathology (such as age and sex) might be combined with ecological principles to understand the case of SARS-CoV-2. We highlight pitfalls in application of existing theoretical frameworks relevant to the complexity of the within-host context and frame the discussion in terms of growing knowledge of the biology of SARS-CoV-2.

Strategies to address COVID-19 infections among nursing home residents vary based on the availability for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) tests, the incorporation of tests into broader surveillance efforts, and using results to help mitigate the spread of COVID-19 by identifying asymptomatic and presymptomatic infections. We review the tests available to diagnose COVID-19 infections, the implications of universal testing for nursing home staff and residents, interpretation of test results, issues around repeat testing, and incorporation of test results as part of a long-term response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We propose a structured approach for facility-wide testing of residents and staff and provide alternatives if testing capacity is limited, emphasizing contact tracing.

METHODS: This case-control study nested within a cohort of cDMARD users was conducted in the Lombardy, Veneto, Tuscany and Lazio regions and Reggio Emilia province. Claims databases were linked to COVID-19 surveillance registries. Risk of COVID-19-related outcomes was estimated using a multivariate conditional logistic regression analysis, comparing HCQ/CLQ vs methotrexate, vs other cDMARDs and vs non-use of these drugs. Presence of rheumatic diseases vs their absence in a non-nested population was investigated. RESULTS: 1275 cases hospitalized due to COVID-19 were matched to 12 734 controls. Compared with recent use of methotrexate, no association between HCQ/CLQ monotherapy and COVID-19 hospitalization (OR 0.83 [95%CI, 0.69-1.00]) or mortality (OR 1.19 [95%CI, 0.85-1.67]) was observed. A lower risk was found when comparing HCQ/CLQ use to the concomitant use of other cDMARDs and glucocorticoids. HCQ/CLQ was not associated with COVID-19 hospitalization as compared with non-use. An increased risk for recent use of either methotrexate monotherapy (OR 1.19 [95% CI, 1.05-1.34]) or other cDMARDs (OR 1.21 [95% CI, 1.08-1.36]) vs non-use was found. Rheumatic diseases were not associated with COVID-19-related outcomes. CONCLUSION: HCQ/CLQ use in rheumatic patients was not associated with a protective effect against COVID-19-related outcomes. Use of other cDMARDs was associated with an increased risk when compared with non-use, and, if concomitantly used with glucocorticoids, also vs HCQ/CLQ, probably to be ascribed to immunosuppressive action.","Alegiani, Stefania Spila; Crisafulli, Salvatore; Rossi, Paolo Giorgi; Mancuso, Pamela; Salvarani, Carlo; Atzeni, Fabiola; Gini, Rosa; Kirchmayer, Ursula; Belleudi, Valeria; Kurotschka, Peter Konstantin; Leoni, Olivia; Ludergnani, Monica; Ferroni, Eliana; Baracco, Susanna; Massari, Marco; Trifirò, Gianluca",Rheumatology (Oxford),197,24

Protocols for the management of poisoning recommend diazepam, although there are uncertainties in its pharmacology and efficacy in this context. The aim was to assess the effects of diazepam in experimental models of chloroquine cardiotoxicity. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: In vitro experiments involved cardiac tissues isolated from rats and incubated with chloroquine alone or in combination with diazepam. In vivo models of toxicity involved chloroquine administered intravenously to pentobarbitone-anaesthetised rats and rabbits. Randomised, controlled treatment studies in rats assessed diazepam, clonazepam and Ro5-4864 administered: (i) prior, (ii) during and (iii) after chloroquine and the effects of diazepam: (iv) at high dose, (v) in urethane-anaesthetised rats and (vi) co-administered with adrenaline. KEY RESULTS: Chloroquine decreased the developed tension of left atria, prolonged the effective refractory period of atria, ventricular tissue and right papillary muscles, and caused dose-dependent impairment of haemodynamic and electrocardiographic parameters. Cardiac arrhythmias indicated impairment of atrioventricular conduction. Studies (i), (ii) and (v) showed no differences between treatments and control. Diazepam increased heart rate in study (iv) and as with clonazepam also prolonged the QTc interval in study (iii). Combined administration of diazepam and adrenaline in study (vi) improved cardiac contractility but caused hypokalaemia. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Neither diazepam nor other ligands for benzodiazepine binding sites protect against or attenuate chloroquine cardiotoxicity. However, diazepam may augment the effects of positive inotropes in reducing chloroquine cardiotoxicity.","Hughes, Dyfrig A",Br. j. pharmacol,197,20

The mechanism for SARS-CoV-2 infection is the requisite binding of the virus to the membrane-bound form of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and internalization of the complex by the host cell. Recognition that ACE2 is the coreceptor for the coronavirus has prompted new therapeutic approaches to block the enzyme or reduce its expression to prevent the cellular entry and SARS-CoV-2 infection in tissues that express ACE2 including lung, heart, kidney, brain, and gut. ACE2, however, is a key enzymatic component of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS); ACE2 degrades ANG II, a peptide with multiple actions that promote CVD, and generates Ang-(1-7), which antagonizes the effects of ANG II. Moreover, experimental evidence suggests that RAAS blockade by ACE inhibitors, ANG II type 1 receptor antagonists, and mineralocorticoid antagonists, as well as statins, enhance ACE2 which, in part, contributes to the benefit of these regimens. In lieu of the fact that many older patients with hypertension or other CVDs are routinely treated with RAAS blockers and statins, new clinical concerns have developed regarding whether these patients are at greater risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection, whether RAAS and statin therapy should be discontinued, and the potential consequences of RAAS blockade to COVID-19-related pathologies such as acute and chronic respiratory disease. The current perspective critically examines the evidence for ACE2 regulation by RAAS blockade and statins, the cardiovascular benefits of ACE2, and whether ACE2 blockade is a viable approach to attenuate COVID-19.","South, Andrew M; Diz, Debra I; Chappell, Mark C",Am J Physiol Heart Circ Physiol,197,2

Recently, SARS-Cov-2 protease structure was released and may be exploited in in-silico studies in order to conduct molecular docking analysis. METHODS: In particular, we compared the binding of two used antimalarial drugs (i.e. chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine) which showed some potential clinical effects in COVID-19 patients, using as positive control tree antiviral recognized compounds, ritonavir, lopinavir and darunavir. RESULTS: Our results showed that hydroxychloroquine but not chloroquine exhibited a significant binding activity to the main protease similar to that possessed by protease inhibitors tested for other viral infections. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that hydroxychloroquine may exert additional direct antiviral activity compared to chloroquine. In the absence of clinical studies comparing the efficacy of these two compounds, hydroxychloroquine may offer additional effects and may be considered as first choice.","Ronsisvalle, Simone; Panarello, Federica; Di Mauro, Rosaria; Bernardini, Renato; Volti, Giovanni Li; Cantarella, Giuseppina",Curr. pharm. des,197,26

While detection of SARS-CoV-2 by polymerase chain reaction with reverse transcription (RT-PCR) is currently used to diagnose acute COVID-19 infection, serological assays are needed to study the humoral immune response to SARS-CoV-2. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin (Ig)G/A/M antibodies against spike (S) protein and its receptor-binding domain (RBD) were characterized in recovered subjects who were RT-PCR-positive (n = 153) and RT-PCR-negative (n = 55) using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). These antibodies were also further assessed for their ability to neutralize live SARS-CoV-2 virus. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were detected in 90.9% of resolved subjects up to 180 days post-symptom onset. Anti-S protein and anti-RBD IgG titers correlated (r = 0.5157 and r = 0.6010, respectively) with viral neutralization. Of the RT-PCR-positive subjects, 22 (14.3%) did not have anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies; and of those, 17 had RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values > 27. These high Ct values raise the possibility that these indeterminate results are from individuals who were not infected or had mild infection that failed to elicit an antibody response. This study highlights the importance of serological surveys to determine population-level immunity based on infection numbers as determined by RT-PCR.","Huynh, Angela; Arnold, Donald M; Smith, James W; Moore, Jane C; Zhang, Ali; Chagla, Zain; Harvey, Bart J; Stacey, Hannah D; Ang, Jann C; Clare, Rumi; Ivetic, Nikola; Chetty, Vasudhevan T; Bowdish, Dawn M E; Miller, Matthew S; Kelton, John G; Nazy, Ishac",Viruses,197,1

Chest X-ray (CXR) imaging has several advantages over other imaging and detection techniques. Numerous works have been reported on COVID-19 detection from a smaller set of original X-ray images. However, the effect of image enhancement and lung segmentation of a large dataset in COVID-19 detection was not reported in the literature. We have compiled a large X-ray dataset (COVQU) consisting of 18,479 CXR images with 8851 normal, 6012 non-COVID lung infections, and 3616 COVID-19 CXR images and their corresponding ground truth lung masks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest public COVID positive database and the lung masks. Five different image enhancement techniques: histogram equalization (HE), contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE), image complement, gamma correction, and balance contrast enhancement technique (BCET) were used to investigate the effect of image enhancement techniques on COVID-19 detection. A novel U-Net model was proposed and compared with the standard U-Net model for lung segmentation. Six different pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) (ResNet18, ResNet50, ResNet101, InceptionV3, DenseNet201, and ChexNet) and a shallow CNN model were investigated on the plain and segmented lung CXR images. The novel U-Net model showed an accuracy, Intersection over Union (IoU), and Dice coefficient of 98.63%, 94.3%, and 96.94%, respectively for lung segmentation. The gamma correction-based enhancement technique outperforms other techniques in detecting COVID-19 from the plain and the segmented lung CXR images. Classification performance from plain CXR images is slightly better than the segmented lung CXR images; however, the reliability of network performance is significantly improved for the segmented lung images, which was observed using the visualization technique. The accuracy, precision, sensitivity, F1-score, and specificity were 95.11%, 94.55%, 94.56%, 94.53%, and 95.59% respectively for the segmented lung images.

Further, the impact on older children and during the perinatal time is becoming better studied. As community spread increases, it is important to recognize that neonates are vulnerable to community spread as well. The impact that community-acquired SARS-CoV-2 has in the neonatal time period is unclear, as this population has unique immunity considerations. OBJECTIVE: To report on a case series of SARS-CoV-2 in neonates through community acquisition in the USA. DESIGN: This is an early retrospective study of patients admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) identified as having SAR-CoV-2 through positive real-time polymerase chain reaction assay of nasopharyngeal swabs. FINDINGS: Three patients who required admission to the NICU between the ages of 17 and 33 days old were identified. All 3 had ill contacts in the home or had been to the pediatrician and presented with mild to moderate symptoms including fever, rhinorrhea, and hypoxia, requiring supplemental oxygen during their hospital stay. One patient was admitted with neutropenia, and the other 2 patients became neutropenic during hospitalization. None of the patients had meningitis or multiorgan failure. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Infants with community-acquired SARS-CoV-2 may require hospitalization due to rule-out sepsis guidelines if found to have fever and/or hypoxia. Caregivers of neonates should exercise recommended guidelines before contact with neonates to limit community spread of SARS-CoV-2 to this potentially vulnerable population, including isolation, particularly as asymptomatic cases become prevalent.","White, Alicia; Mukherjee, Priya; Stremming, Jane; Sherlock, Laura G; Reynolds, Regina M; Smith, Danielle; Asturias, Edwin J; Grover, Theresa R; Dietz, Robert M",Neonatology,197,26

Clinically, four different scenarios occur within the typical disease timeline: first, an incubation and asymptomatic period; second, a stage with mild symptoms due mainly to the virus itself; third, in up to 20% of the patients, a stage with severe symptoms where a hyperinflammatory response with a cytokine storm driven by host immunity induces acute respiratory distress syndrome; and finally, a post-acute sequelae (PASC) phase, which present symptoms that can range from mild or annoying to actually quite incapacitating. Although the most common manifestation is acute respiratory failure of the lungs, other organs are also frequently involved. The clinical manifestations of the COVID-19 infection support a key role for endothelial dysfunction in the pathobiology of this condition. The virus enters into the organism via its interaction with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2-receptor that is present prominently in the alveoli, but also in endothelial cells, which can be directly infected by the virus. Cytokine release syndrome can also drive endothelial damage independently. Consequently, a distinctive feature of SARS-CoV-2 infection is vascular harm, with severe endothelial injury, widespread thrombosis, microangiopathy, and neo-angiogenesis in response to endothelial damage. Therefore, endothelial dysfunction seems to be the pathophysiological substrate for severe COVID-19 complications. Biomarkers of endothelial injury could constitute strong indicators of disease progression and severity. In addition, the endothelium could represent a very attractive target to both prevent and treat these complications. To establish an adequate therapy, the underlying pathophysiology and corresponding clinical stage should be clearly identified. In this review, the clinical features of COVID-19, the central role of the endothelium in COVID-19 and in other pathologies, and the potential of specific therapies aimed at protecting the endothelium in COVID-19 patients are addressed.","Castro, Pedro; Palomo, Marta; Moreno-Castaño, Ana Belen; Fernández, Sara; Torramadé-Moix, Sergi; Pascual, Georgina; Martinez-Sanchez, Julia; Richardson, Edward; Téllez, Adrián; Nicolas, Josep M; Carreras, Enric; Richardson, Paul G; Badimon, Juan José; Escolar, Gines; Diaz-Ricart, Maribel",Cardiovasc. drugs ther,197,16

METHODS: We performed a case series of COVID-19-related deaths seen at Forensic Post-Mortem examination of sudden and unexpected Community Deaths in Lusaka, Zambia, Africa. Whole-body Post-Mortem examinations were performed according to Standard Operating Procedures. Patient demographics, history, co-morbidities, pathological gross and microscopic findings, and cause(s) of death were recorded. Variables were grouped as frequencies and percentages. Comparison of data was made with autopsy findings of hospital COVID-19 deaths. FINDINGS: Of 21 COVID-19 decedents, 14/21 (66.7%) were male; 18/21, (85.7%) were below 55 years of age (mean age, 40 ± 12.3; range, 20-73).

A prospective single-centre cohort study of HTx recipients who received a two-dose SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine (BNT162b2, Pfizer-BioNTech). METHODS AND RESULTS: Whole blood for anti-spike IgG (S-IgG) antibodies was drawn at days 21-26 and at days 35-40 after the first vaccine dose. Geometric mean titres (GMT) &#8805;50 AU/mL were interpreted positive. Included were 42 HTx recipients at a median age of 61 [interquartile range (IQR) 44-69] years. Median time from HTx to the first vaccine dose was 9.1 (IQR 2.6-14) years. Only 15% of HTx recipients demonstrated the presence of positive S-IgG antibody titres in response to the first vaccine dose [GMT 90 (IQR 54-229) AU/mL]. Overall, 49% of HTx recipients induced S-IgG antibodies in response to either the first or the full two-dose vaccine schedule [GMT 426 (IQR 106-884) AU/mL]. Older age [68 (IQR 59-70) years vs. 46 (IQR 34-63) years, P = 0.034] and anti-metabolite-based immunosuppression protocols (89% vs. 44%, P = 0.011) were associated with low immunogenicity. Importantly, 36% of HTx recipients who were non-responders to the first vaccine dose became S-IgG seropositive in response to the second vaccine dose. Approximately a half of HTx recipients did not generate S-IgG antibodies following SARS-CoV-2 two-dose vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: The generally achieved protection from SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination should be regarded with caution in the population of HTx recipients. The possible benefit of additive vaccine should be further studied.","Itzhaki Ben Zadok, Osnat; Shaul, Aviv A; Ben-Avraham, Binyamin; Yaari, Vicky; Ben Zvi, Haim; Shostak, Yael; Pertzov, Barak; Eliakim-Raz, Noa; Abed, Galia; Abuhazira, Miriam; Barac, Yaron D; Mats, Israel; Kramer, Mordechai R; Aravot, Dan; Kornowski, Ran; Ben-Gal, Tuvia",Eur. j. heart fail,197,16

Over 106 million COVID-19 cases including 2.3 million deaths have been reported to the WHO as of February 9, 2021. This review examines the epidemiology, transmission, clinical features, and phylogenetics of three lethal zoonotic coronavirus infections of humans: SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, and The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-COV). RECENT FINDINGS: Bats appear to be the common natural source of SARS-like CoV including SARS-CoV-1 but their role in SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV remains unclear. Civet cats and dromedary camels are the intermediary animal sources for SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV infection, respectively whereas that of SARS-CoV-2 remains unclear. SARS-CoV-2 viral loads peak early on days 2-4 of symptom onset and thus high transmission occurs in the community, and asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission occurs commonly. Nosocomial outbreaks are hallmarks of SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV infections whereas these are less common in COVID-19. Several COVID-19 vaccines are now available. SUMMARY: Of the three lethal zoonotic coronavirus infections of humans, SARS-CoV-2 has caused a devastating global pandemic with over a million deaths. The emergence of genetic variants, such as D614G, N501Y (variants 1 and 2), has led to an increase in transmissibility and raises concern about the possibility of re-infection and impaired vaccine response. Continued global surveillance is essential for both SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV, to monitor changing epidemiology due to viral variants.","Hui, David S; Zumla, Alimuddin; Tang, Julian W",Curr Opin Pulm Med,197,24

It is urgent to evaluate the effect of reopening policies on the COVID-19 pandemic to help with the decision-making on the control measures and medical resource allocations. In this study, a novel SEIR model was developed to evaluate the effect of reopening policies based on the real-world reported COVID-19 data in Texas. The earlier reported data before the reopening were used to develop the SEIR model; data after the reopening were used for evaluation. The simulation results show that if continuing the ""stay-at-home order"" without reopening the business, the COVID-19 pandemic could end in December 2020 in Texas. On the other hand, the pandemic could be controlled similarly as the case of no-reopening only if the contact rate was low and additional high magnitude of control measures could be implemented. If the control measures are only slightly enhanced after reopening, it could flatten the curve of the COVID-19 epidemic with reduced numbers of infections and deaths, but it might make the epidemic last longer. Based on the reported data up to July 2020 in Texas, the real-world epidemic pattern is between the cases of the low and high magnitude of control measures with a medium risk of contact rate after reopening. In this case, the pandemic might last until summer 2021 to February 2022 with a total of 4-10 million infected cases and 20,080-58,604 deaths.","Yu, Duo; Zhu, Gen; Wang, Xueying; Zhang, Chenguang; Soltanalizadeh, Babak; Wang, Xia; Tang, Sanyi; Wu, Hulin",,197,21

The main limitation to widespread use is its dependence on the operator training and experience. COVID-19 lung ultrasound findings predominantly reflect a pneumonitis pattern, with pleural effusion being infrequent. However, pleural effusion is easy to detect and to quantify, therefore it was selected as the subject of this study, which aims to develop an automated system for the interpretation of LUS of pleural effusion. A LUS dataset was collected at the Royal Melbourne Hospital which consisted of 623 videos containing 99,209 2D ultrasound images of 70 patients using a phased array transducer. A standardized protocol was followed that involved scanning six anatomical regions providing complete coverage of the lungs for diagnosis of respiratory pathology. This protocol combined with a deep learning algorithm using a Spatial Transformer Network provides a basis for automatic pathology classification on an image-based level. In this work, the deep learning model was trained using supervised and weakly supervised approaches which used frame- and video-based ground truth labels respectively. The reference was expert clinician image interpretation. Both approaches show comparable accuracy scores on the test set of 92.4% and 91.1%, respectively, not statistically significantly different.

This destruction could target melanocytes anywhere in the body, which could affect function of organs where they reside. Melanocytes in the skin, uveal tract and ear are similar in their physiology and morphology and share a common embryologic origin. OBJECTIVES: The present work aimed to study the association of vitiligo with ocular and auditory abnormalities. METHODS: This case-control study was carried out on forty vitiligo patients and twenty normal healthy controls. All patients and controls were subjected to auditory examination (Otoscopic examination and immittancemetry, pure tone audiometery to assess peripheral hearing sensitivity and transient evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAE) to assess central hearing ability) and standard ocular examination including: visual acuity test, slit lamp biomicroscopy , and optical coherence tomography (OCT). RESULTS: There was significant higher prevalence of hearing loss in vitiligo patients than controls. Ocular abnormalities were found to be significant higher in vitiligo patients but no significant difference regarding visual acuity. CONCLUSION: Vitiligo is a systemic disease and could be associated with impairment of melanocytes function in other organs including the eyes and ears. Auditory melanocytes function is related to hearing process and thus their destruction could lead to hearing impairment yet ocular melanocytes don't play direct role in detection or transfer of visual information. Vitiligo could be associated with ocular abnormalities and hearing loss.","Elereny, A; Assal, S; Gomaa, A; Almakkawy, B; Genedy, R",Clin. exp. dermatol,197,16

These social changes require new smart healthcare services for use in daily life, and COVID-19 has also led to a contactless trend necessitating more non-face-to-face health services. Due to the improvements that have been achieved in healthcare technologies, an increasing number of studies have attempted to predict and analyze certain diseases in advance. Research on stroke diseases is actively underway, particularly with the aging population. Stroke, which is fatal to the elderly, is a disease that requires continuous medical observation and monitoring, as its recurrence rate and mortality rate are very high. Most studies examining stroke disease to date have used MRI or CT images for simple classification. This clinical approach (imaging) is expensive and time-consuming while requiring bulky equipment. Recently, there has been increasing interest in using non-invasive measurable EEGs to compensate for these shortcomings. However, the prediction algorithms and processing procedures are both time-consuming because the raw data needs to be separated before the specific attributes can be obtained. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a new methodology that allows for the immediate application of deep learning models on raw EEG data without using the frequency properties of EEG. This proposed deep learning-based stroke disease prediction model was developed and trained with data collected from real-time EEG sensors. We implemented and compared different deep-learning models (LSTM, Bidirectional LSTM, CNN-LSTM, and CNN-Bidirectional LSTM) that are specialized in time series data classification and prediction. The experimental results confirmed that the raw EEG data, when wielded by the CNN-bidirectional LSTM model, can predict stroke with 94.0% accuracy with low FPR (6.0%) and FNR (5.7%), thus showing high confidence in our system.

METHODS: Seven patients presented with or developed severe bradyarrhythmias requiring pacing support during the course of their COVID-19 illness over a 6-week period of peak COVID-19 incidence. A retrospective review of their presentations and clinical course was performed. RESULTS: Symptomatic high-degree heart block was present on initial presentation in three of seven patients (43%), and four patients developed sinus arrest or paroxysmal high-degree atrioventricular block. No patients in this series demonstrated left ventricular systolic dysfunction or acute cardiac injury, whereas all patients had elevated inflammatory markers. In some patients, bradyarrhythmias occurred prior to the onset of respiratory symptoms. Death from complications of COVID-19 infection occurred in 57% (4/7) patients during the initial hospitalization and in 71% (5/7) patients within 3 months of presentation. CONCLUSIONS: Despite management of bradycardia with temporary (3/7) or permanent leadless pacemakers (4/7), there was a high rate of short-term morbidity and death due to complications of COVID-19. The association between new-onset bradyarrhythmias and poor outcomes may influence management strategies for acutely ill patients with COVID-19.","Chinitz, Jason S; Goyal, Rajat; Harding, Melissa; Veseli, Granit; Gruberg, Luis; Jadonath, Ram; Maccaro, Paul; Gandotra, Puneet; Ong, Lawrence; Epstein, Laurence M",Pacing Clin Electrophysiol,197,13

It spreaded and became a public health emergency all over the world by mid of April 2020. Flavonoids are specialized metabolites that have antimicrobial properties including anti-viral activity. Rutin, a medicinally important flavonoid belongs to one of the best natural antioxidant classes. It has antiprotozoal, antibacterial, and antiviral properties. Keeping the antimicrobial potential of rutin in mind, we studied its role in the inhibition of essential proteins of SARS-CoV-2 including main protease (Mpro), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), papain-like protease (PLpro), and spike (S)-protein through different in silico approaches. Experimental procedure: Molecular docking, inhibition constant, hydrogen bond calculations, and ADMET-properties prediction were performed using different softwares. Results and conclusion: Molecular docking study showed significant binding of rutin with Mpro, RdRp, PLpro, and S-proteins of SARS-CoV-2. Out of these four proteins, Mpro exhibited the strongest binding affinity with the least binding energy (-8.9 kcal/mol) and stabilized through hydrogen bonds with bond lengths ranging from 1.18 Å to 3.17 Å as well as hydrophobic interactions. The predicted ADMET and bioactivity showed its optimal solubility, non-toxic, and non-carcinogenic properties. The values of the predicted inhibitory constant of the rutin with SARS-CoV-2 vital proteins ranged between 5.66 µM and 6.54 µM which suggested its promising drug candidature. This study suggested rutin alone or in combination as a dietary supplement may be used to fight against COVID-19 after detailed in vitro and in vivo studies.","Rahman, Fazlur; Tabrez, Shams; Ali, Rahat; Alqahtani, Ali S; Ahmed, Mohammad Z; Rub, Abdur",Journal of traditional and complementary medicine,197,16

Blood (phenylalanine) Phe results of the tests of 535 patients, performed in 2019 and in the first months of 2020, were analysed. The six-week lockdown period was compared to the preceding six-week period as well as to the two corresponding periods of 2019 (three non-lockdown periods). More patients failed to perform Phe tests in the lockdown period (32.7%) than in non-lockdown periods (15.6%, 15.1%, 17.2%; p < 0.001 for all). The median Phe levels for those patients who performed testing in all the four periods did not differ between periods. However, these patients tended to perform only one test during the lockdown (ORs: 1.43 to 1.60; 95% CI: from 1.01-2.04 to 1.11-2.30, p-value 0.02 to 0.005). Patients who did not take blood during the lockdown (46.7%) performed significantly fewer blood tests in the remaining periods (median <IQR>: 1 <0-1> vs. 2 <1-4>; p < 0.001). In conclusion, direct assessment of patients' compliance based upon Phe levels during the pandemic lockdown was not possible. Pre-pandemic non-compliant patients frequently failed to perform the test during the lockdown, whereas the previously compliant ones were more likely to perform only one test. This strongly suggests that metabolic control might have worsened.","Walkowiak, Dariusz; Mikoluc, Bozena; Mozrzymas, Renata; Kaluzny, Lukasz; Didycz, Bozena; Jaglowska, Joanna; Kurylak, Danuta; Walkowiak, Jaroslaw",Nutrients,197,16

For broad applicability, we focus on the common yet challenging scenario where patient-level data for a region of interest are not available. Instead, given daily admissions counts, we model aggregated counts of observed resource use, such as the number of patients in the general ward, in the intensive care unit, or on a ventilator. In order to explain how individual patient trajectories produce these counts, we propose an aggregate count explicit-duration hidden Markov model, nicknamed the ACED-HMM, with an interpretable, compact parameterization. We develop an Approximate Bayesian Computation approach that draws samples from the posterior distribution over the model's transition and duration parameters given aggregate counts from a specific location, thus adapting the model to a region or individual hospital site of interest. Samples from this posterior can then be used to produce future forecasts of any counts of interest. Using data from the United States and the United Kingdom, we show our mechanistic approach provides competitive probabilistic forecasts for the future even as the dynamics of the pandemic shift. Furthermore, we show how our model provides insight about recovery probabilities or length of stay distributions, and we suggest its potential to answer challenging what-if questions about the societal value of possible interventions.","Visani, Gian Marco; Lee, Alexandra Hope; Nguyen, Cuong; Kent, David M.; Wong, John B.; Cohen, Joshua T.; Hughes, Michael C.",,197,26

COVID-19 has posed a huge threat to public health and economic stability worldwide. CR3022, a human monoclonal neutralizing antibody isolated from a Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) recovery patient, was confirmed to be able to bind the S protein of HCoV-19 with a certain degree of neutralizing activity. Crystal structural information indicated that CR3022 could bind to the epitope on the receptor binding domain (RBD) of HCoV-19, whose epitope consists of 28 amino acids, and 24 of them are conserved in SARS-CoV of SARS. However, the crystal structure is only a static conformation at a certain moment in time, and it cannot provide dynamic details of the interaction between antigen and antibody. Methods: In this study, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation combined with MM/PBSA and CAS methods were performed to investigate the binding mechanism of binding of CR3022 against SARS-CoV-RBD and HCoV-19-RBD in order to determine their holographic dynamic information. Results: It was found that the CR3022-SARS-CoV-RBD complex was more stable during 100ns MD run than that of the CR3022-HCoV19-RBD system. There were common conservative amino acids on the ß2 sheet of RBD, including Tyr369, Phe377, Lys378, Tyr380, Gly381, Lys386, Leu390 and others. These conservative amino acids play significant roles in the binding process of CR3022 antibody against SARS-CoV-RBD and HCoV-19-RBD. It was also found that the binding mode of CR3022 to its native target SARS-CoV-RBD is more comprehensive and uniform. Moreover, the ß2 sheet residue Thr385 and non-ß2 sheet residues Arg408 and Asp428 of the CR3022- SARS-CoV-RBD system were found to be crucial for their binding affinities, thus forming a special conformational epitope. However, these key amino acids are not present in the CR3022-HCoV-19-RBD system. The binding mode of CR3022 and HCoV-19-RBD is similar to that of SARS-CoV-RBD, but the deficiency of crucial hydrogen-bonds and salt-bridges. Therefore, the binding of CR3022 and HCoV19-RBD only draws on the partial mode of the binding of CR3022 and SARS-CoV-RBD, so there is a loss of affinity. Conclusion: Thus, in order to better fight the epidemic of COVID-19 with the CR3022 antibody, this antibody needs to further improve the neutralization efficiency of HCoV-19 through mutation of it's CDR region.","Yu, Wei; Wu, Xiaomin; Ren, Jiayi; Zhang, Xiaochun; Wang, Yueming; Li, Chengming; Xu, Wenwen; Li, Jason; Li, Gang; Zheng, Weihong; Liao, Huaxin; Yuan, Xiaohui",Combinatorial chemistry &amp; high throughput screening (Online),197,1

Public health interventions have had significant impacts in reducing transmission and in averting even more deaths. Nonetheless, in many jurisdictions, the decline of cases and fatalities after apparent epidemic peaks has not been rapid. Instead, the asymmetric decline in cases appears, in most cases, to be consistent with plateau- or shoulder-like phenomena-a qualitative observation reinforced by a symmetry analysis of US state-level fatality data. Here we explore a model of fatality-driven awareness in which individual protective measures increase with death rates. In this model, fast increases to the peak are often followed by plateaus, shoulders, and lag-driven oscillations. The asymmetric shape of model-predicted incidence and fatality curves is consistent with observations from many jurisdictions. Yet, in contrast to model predictions, we find that population-level mobility metrics usually increased from low levels before fatalities reached an initial peak. We show that incorporating fatigue and long-term behavior change can reconcile the apparent premature relaxation of mobility reductions and help understand when post-peak dynamics are likely to lead to a resurgence of cases.","Weitz, Joshua S; Park, Sang Woo; Eksin, Ceyhun; Dushoff, Jonathan",Proc.

However, the reimplementation of the analyses, built on larger scale data sets using state-of-the-art bioinformatics methods and databases, presents clear evidence that rebuts these conclusions. Next, using metagenomic samples from Manis javanica, we assembled a draft genome of the 2019-nCoV-like coronavirus, which shows 73% coverage and 91% sequence identity to the 2019-nCoV genome. In particular, the alignments of the spike surface glycoprotein receptor binding domain revealed four times more variations in the bat coronavirus RaTG13 than in the Manis coronavirus compared with 2019-nCoV, suggesting the pangolin as a missing link in the transmission of 2019-nCoV from bats to human.","Zhang, Chengxin; Zheng, Wei; Huang, Xiaoqiang; Bell, Eric W; Zhou, Xiaogen; Zhang, Yang",J Proteome Res,197,24

We included peer-reviewed original studies that applied AI for COVID-19 patients, healthcare workers, or health systems in intensive care, emergency, or prehospital settings. We assessed predictive modelling studies and critically appraised the methodology and key findings of all other studies. Results: Of fourteen eligible studies, eleven developed prognostic or diagnostic AI predictive models, all of which were assessed to be at high risk of bias. Common pitfalls included inadequate sample sizes, poor handling of missing data, failure to account for censored participants, and weak validation of models. Conclusions: Current AI applications for COVID-19 are not ready for deployment in acute care settings, given their limited scope and poor quality. Our findings underscore the need for improvements to facilitate safe and effective clinical adoption of AI applications, for and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.","Chee, Marcel Lucas; Ong, Marcus Eng Hock; Siddiqui, Fahad Javaid; Zhang, Zhongheng; Lim, Shir Lynn; Ho, Andrew Fu Wah; Liu, Nan",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),197,26

Epidemiologic studies revealed that populations have different vulnerabilities to SARS-CoV-2. Severe outcomes of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with an increased risk of death are observed in patients with metabolic syndrome, as well as diabetic and heart conditions (frail population). Excessive proinflammatory cytokine storm could be the main cause of increased vulnerability in this frail population. In patients with diabetes and/or heart disease, a low inflammatory state is often associated with gut dysbiosis. The increase amount of microbial metabolites (i.e., trimethylamine N-oxide and lipopolysaccharide), which generate an inflammatory microenvironment, is probably associated with an improved risk of severe illness from COVID-19. Nutritional interventions aimed at restoring the gut microbial balance could represent preventive strategies to protect the frail population from COVID-19. This narrative review presents the possible molecular mechanisms by which intestinal dysbiosis that enhances the inflammatory state could promote the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Some nutritional strategies to counteract inflammation in frail patients are also analyzed.","Terruzzi, Ileana; Senesi, Pamela",Nutrition,197,30

We aim to assess the clinical characteristics, outcomes and factors associated with hospital admission or death in adult outpatients with COVID-19. METHODS: This is a prospective cohort of outpatients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, registered in the Covidom telesurveillance solution for home monitoring of patients with COVID-19 in the Greater Paris area, from March to August 2020. The primary outcome was clinical worsening, defined as hospitalization or death within 1 month after symptom onset. RESULTS: Among 43 103 patients, mean age was 42.9 years (SD 14.3 years); 93.0% (n = 40 081) of patients were <65 years old and 61.9% (n = 26 688) were women. Of these 43 103 patients, 67.5% (n = 29 104) completed a medical questionnaire on co-morbidities and symptoms. The main reported co-morbidities were asthma (12.8%; n = 3685), hypertension (12.3%; n = 3546) and diabetes (4.8%; n = 1385). A small proportion of all eligible patients (4.1%, 95% CI 3.9-4.2; 1751/43 103) experienced clinical worsening. The rate of hospitalization was 4.0% (95% CI 3.8%-4.2%; n = 1728) and 0.1% (95% CI 0.1%-0.2%; n = 64) died. Factors associated with clinical worsening were male sex, older age, obesity and co-morbidities such as chronic renal disease or cancer under treatment. Probability of worsening was reduced with anosmia/ageusia. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical worsening was rare among outpatients. Male sex, older age and co-morbidities such as chronic renal disease, active cancers or obesity were independently associated with clinical worsening. However, our cohort may include patients younger and healthier than the general population.","Yordanov, Youri; Dinh, Aurélien; Bleibtreu, Alexandre; Mensch, Arthur; Lescure, François-Xavier; Debuc, Erwan; Jourdain, Patrick; Jaulmes, Luc; Dechartres, Agnes",Clin. microbiol. infect,197,21

A milestone of the anthropocene is the emergence of a series of epidemics and pandemics often characterized by the transmission of a pathogen from animals to human in the past two decades. In particular, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has made a profound impact on emergency responding and policy-making in a public health crisis. Classical solutions for controlling the virus, such as travel restrictions, lockdowns, repurposed drugs and vaccines, are socially unpopular and medically limited by the fast mutation and adaptation of the virus. This is exacerbated by microbial resistance to therapeutic drugs and the slowness of vaccine development. In other words, microbial pathogens are somehow 'smarter' and faster than us, thus calling for more intelligent cures to combat future pandemics. Here, we compare therapeutics for COVID-19 such as synthetic drugs, vaccines, antibodies and phages. We present the strength and limitations of antibiotic and antiviral drugs, vaccines, and antibody-based therapeutics. We describe smarter, cheaper and preventive cures such as bacteriophages, food medicine using probiotics and prebiotics, sports, healthy diet, music, yoga, Tai Chi, dance, reading, knitting, cooking and outdoor activities. Some of these preventive cures have been intuitively developed since thousands of years ago, as illustrated by the fascinating similarity of the Chinese characters for 'music' and 'herbal medicine.'","Dai, Han; Han, Jie; Lichtfouse, Eric",Environ Chem Lett,197,16

Previous studies showed that comorbidities in patients with COVID-19 are risk factors for adverse outcomes. This study aimed to clarify the association between nervous system diseases and severity or mortality in patients with COVID-19. We performed a systematic literature search of four electronic databases and included studies reporting the prevalence of nervous system diseases in COVID-19 patients with severe and non-severe disease or among survivors and non-survivors. The included studies were pooled into a meta-analysis to calculate the odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). We included 69 studies involving 17 879 patients. The nervous system diseases were associated with COVID-19 severity (OR = 3.19, 95%CI: 2.37 to 4.30, P < 0.001) and mortality (OR = 3.75, 95%CI: 2.68 to 5.25, P < 0.001). Specifically, compared with the patients without cerebrovascular disease, patients with cerebrovascular disease infected with COVID-19 had a higher risk of severity (OR = 3.10, 95%CI: 2.21 to 4.36, P < 0.001) and mortality (OR = 3.45, 95% CI: 2.46 to 4.84, P < 0.001). Stroke was associated with severe COVID-19 disease (OR = 1.95, 95%CI: 1.11 to 3.42, P = 0.020). No significant differences were found for the prevalence of epilepsy (OR = 1.00, 95%CI: 0.42 to 2.35, P = 0.994) and dementia (OR = 2.39, 95%CI: 0.55 to 10.48, P = 0.247) between non-severe and severe COVID-19 patients. There was no significant association between stroke (OR = 1.79, 95%CI: 0.76 to 4.23, P = 0.185), epilepsy (OR = 2.08, 95%CI: 0.08 to 50.91, P = 0.654) and COVID-19 mortality. In conclusion, nervous system diseases and cerebrovascular disease were associated with severity and mortality of patients with COVID-19. There might be confounding factors that influence the relationship between nervous system diseases and COVID-19 severity as well as mortality.","Gao, Ya; Chen, Yamin; Liu, Ming; Niu, Mingming; Song, Ziwei; Yan, Meili; Tian, Jinhui",Epidemiol Infect,197,17

The latter affect both their income (and consumption) and their probability of infecting and of being infected. Strategic complementarities among individual mobility choices drive the evolution of aggregate economic activity, while infection externalities caused by individual mobility affect disease diffusion. Rational expectations of forward looking agents on the dynamics of aggregate mobility and epidemic determine individual mobility decisions. The model allows to evaluate alternative scenarios of mobility restrictions, especially policies dependent on the state of epidemic. We prove the existence of an equilibrium and provide a recursive construction method for finding equilibrium(a), which also guides our numerical investigations. We calibrate the model by using Italian experience on COVID-19 epidemic in the period February 2020 - May 2021. We discuss how our economic SIRD (ESIRD) model produces a substantially different dynamics of economy and epidemic with respect to a SIRD model with constant agents' mobility. Finally, by numerical explorations we illustrate how the model can be used to design an efficient policy of state-of-epidemic-dependent mobility restrictions, which mitigates the epidemic peaks stressing health system, and allows for trading-off the economic losses due to reduced mobility with the lower death rate due to the lower spread of epidemic.","Fabbri, Giorgio; Federico, Salvatore; Fiaschi, Davide; Gozzi, Fausto",,197,6

Lockdowns were imposed throughout countries and even Inborn errors of metabolism (IEMs) affected patients had to face it and adapt, with management strategies changes coming along. Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an inborn error of phenylalanine (Phe) metabolism causing, when not treated, blood Phe increases and consequent central nervous system (CNS) damage. Dietary intervention is the main recognized treatment and must be maintained long-life, however adherence is often suboptimal in adulthood. Aim of this study was to evaluate whether and how the pandemic had impacted PKUs metabolic control and what factors may have played a role as potential modifiers. Methods Patients ≥4 yo and in follow-up at our Metabolic Clinic were enrolled in this study, divided into subgroups according to age (GROUP A &lt; 12 yo;GROUP B ≥ 12 yo). Videoconsults were conducted on a minimum monthly basis and collected DBS were studied and compared to previous year same time-period in order to evaluate possible changes. Results 39% of patients (n = 121) increased the number of performed DBS. “Non-compliant” patients were reduced (11–3%) with a − 14% of patients with mean Phe levels &gt;600 umol/l and a − 8% of patients with 100% DBS above same level. GROUP A maintained substantially unchanged metabolic control among two analyzed time-periods. On the contrary, GROUP B demonstrated significant reductions in mean blood Phe concentrations (p &lt; 0.0001) during the pandemic (mean 454 umol/l, SD ± 252, vs. 556.4 umol/l, SD ± 301). Discussion COVID19 pandemic strongly impacted people's life with lifestyle habits changing consistently. PKU patients had to adapt their dietary restrictions to the new environment they were exposed to and, if younger patients could have been less exposed (meals strictly according to diet plan independently from setting), adolescent and adults strongly reflected the obligation to stay home by showing better metabolic control. Multiple factors could have played a role in that and the availability of teleconsultancy may have contributed allowing easier connections, but our data demonstrate how the pandemic and the environment can strongly impact PKUs adherence to treatment and how removing distance barriers can ameliorate and optimize metabolic compliance.","Rovelli, Valentina Zuvadelli Juri Ercoli Vittoria Montanari Chiara Paci Sabrina Dionigi Alice Re Scopari Andrea Salvatici Elisabetta Cefalo Graziella Banderali Giuseppe",Molecular Genetics and Metabolism Reports,197,14

Hopelessness, anhedonia, and dissociation represent some of the most pervasive psychopathological symptoms that often lead to suicidal thoughts, attempts, and actions. To further research on the concept of depression endophenotypes, this study aimed to assess the possible relationships between hopelessness and other clinical and biological correlates (i.e., striatal dopaminergic dysfunction) in depressed patients. Methods: We recruited 51 subjects with MDD. All subjects underwent 123I-FP-CIT SPECT to assess striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) availability and a psychometric evaluation using the psychometric scale to assess depressive, anxious, dissociative, and hopelessness symptoms aside from suicidal ideation. Result: An inverse correlation between the hopelessness score and dopamine transporter availability in all basal ganglia was bilaterally found. (Right Putamen, r = -0.445, p < 0.01; Left Putamen, r = -0.454, p < 0.01; Right Caudate, r = -0.398, p < 0.01; Left Caudate, r = -0.467, p < 0.01) Moreover, a positive correlation was also found between hopelessness and dissociative symptoms. Conclusions: These results provide important evidence on the neurobiological and clinical correlates of different psychopathological symptoms of depression with potential implications in terms of devising more effective treatment programs.","Pettorruso, Mauro; d039,; Andrea, Giacomo; Martinotti, Giovanni; Cocciolillo, Fabrizio; Miuli, Andrea; Di Muzio, Ilenia; Collevecchio, Rebecca; Verrastro, Valeria; De-Giorgio, Fabio; Janiri, Luigi; di Giannantonio, Massimo; Di Giuda, Daniela; Camardese, Giovanni",,197,16

However, high incidence rates and rapidly spreading SARS-CoV-2 variants are concerning. In combination with acute supply deficits in Europe in early 2021, the question arises of whether stretching the vaccine, for instance by delaying the second dose, can make a significant contribution to preventing deaths, despite associated risks such as lower vaccine efficacy, the potential emergence of escape mutants, enhancement, waning immunity, reduced social acceptance of off-label vaccination, and liability shifts. A quantitative epidemiological assessment of risks and benefits of non-standard vaccination protocols remains elusive. To clarify the situation and to provide a quantitative epidemiological foundation we develop a stochastic epidemiological model that integrates specific vaccine rollout protocols into a risk-group structured infectious disease dynamical model. Using the situation and conditions in Germany as a reference system, we show that delaying the second vaccine dose is expected to prevent deaths in the four to five digit range, should the incidence resurge. We show that this considerable public health benefit relies on the fact that both mRNA vaccines provide substantial protection against severe COVID-19 and death beginning 12 to 14 days after the first dose. The benefits of protocol change are attenuated should vaccine compliance decrease substantially. To quantify the impact of protocol change on vaccination adherence we performed a large-scale online survey. We find that, in Germany, changing vaccination protocols may lead to small reductions in vaccination intention. In sum, we therefore expect the benefits of a strategy change to remain substantial and stable.","Maier, Benjamin F.; Burdinski, Angelique; Rose, Annika H.; Schlosser, Frank; Hinrichs, David; Betsch, Cornelia; Korn, Lars; Sprengholz, Philipp; Meyer-Hermann, Michael; Mitra, Tanmay; Lauterbach, Karl; Brockmann, Dirk",,197,20

The WHO Ad Hoc Expert Group on the Next Steps for Covid-19 Vaccine suggested that countries with limited or no access to an effective vaccine could ethically permit placebo-controlled trials, even if effective vaccines were already being marketed elsewhere. Here, I argue that inclusion in a placebo-controlled trial is ethically sound for those who would be in any case ineligible for vaccination outside the trial, and as long as the access to the vaccine outside the trial depends on a transparent and just allocation framework. Conversely, carrying out placebo-controlled studies in countries where vaccines are not (or are insufficiently) available because of unequal global allocation, would be unethical, as an ethical strategy cannot be built on an unethical premise.","Ravinetto, Raffaella",Indian J Med Ethics,197,20

We identify three domains in which new approaches are being generated by mathematic educators: principles of design of new settings; social interaction and construction knowledge; and tools and resources. The papers in this issue reflect different perspectives developed in the last decade in these three domains, providing evidence of the advances in theoretical frameworks and support in the generation of new meanings for old constructs such as 'tool', 'resources' or 'learning setting'.

The mechanisms through which frailty increases the severity of COVID-19 are several, including immunosenescense and dysregulated inflammation. Whether individuals affected by frailty exhibit a higher susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection remains an open question. Here we report the case series of 40 older persons that in February 2020, before the first case of COVID-19 was detected in Italy, went together on a winter holiday. Back home, 7 of them developed influenza-like symptoms and one was hospitalized due to COVID-19 pneumonia. Between May and July, the seniors were offered the possibility to be tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibody positivity. Twenty-seven of them accepted: 13 had a positive serological test whereas no active infection was found. Comparing the characteristics of those who tested positive and the others, we found that the former group was frailer, exhibiting higher Clinical Frailty Scale scores.","Zucchelli, A; Bologna, E; Marengoni, A",Aging Clin Exp Res,197,21

It was initially detected in Wuhan, China and spread to other cities of China and all countries. It has caused many deaths and the number of infections became greater than 18 million as of 5 August 2020. This study aimed to analyze the situation of COVID-19 in Thailand and the challenging disease control by employing a dynamic model to determine prevention approaches. We employed a statistical technique to analyze the ambient temperature influencing the cases. We found that temperature was significantly associated with daily infected cases (p-value <0.01). The SEIR (Susceptible Exposed Infectious and Recovered) dynamic approach and moving average estimation were used to forecast the daily infected and cumulative cases until 16 June as a base run analysis using STELLA dynamic software and statistical techniques. The movement of people, both in relation to local (Thai people) and foreign travel (both Thai and tourists), played a significant role in the spread of COVID-19 in Thailand. Enforcing a state of emergency and regulating social distancing were the key factors in reducing the growth rate of the disease. The SEIR model reliably predicted the actual infected cases, with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 12.8. In case of moving average approach, RMSE values were 0.21, 0.21, and 0.35 for two, three and five days, respectively. The previous records were used as input for prediction that caused lower values of RMSE. Two-days and three-days moving averages gave the better results than SEIR model. The SEIR model is suitable for longer period prediction, whereas the moving average approach is suitable for short term prediction. The implementation of interventions, such as governmental regulation and restrictions, through collaboration among various sectors was the key factor for controlling the spreading of COVID-19 in Thailand.","Tantrakarnapa, Kraichat; Bhopdhornangkul, Bhophkrit",One Health,197,20

METHODS: Volumetric airflow were measured to assess air change rate per hour by ventilation (ACHvent). Equivalent ventilation provided by the PAC (ACHpac) was calculated based on its clean air delivery rate. Concentrations of 0.3, 0.5 and 1.0 µm aerosol particles were measured in 10 dental treatment rooms with various ventilation rates at baseline, after 5-min of incense burn, and after 30-min of observation with and without the PAC or ventilation system in operation. Velocities of aerosol removal were assessed by concentration decay constants for the 0.3 µm particles with ventilation alone (Kn) and with ventilation and PAC (Kn+pac), and by times needed to reach 95 % and 100 % removal of accumulated aerosol particles. RESULTS: ACHvent varied from 3 to 45. Kn and Kn+pac were correlated with ACHvent (r = 0.90) and combined ACHtotal (r = 0.81), respectively. Accumulated aerosol particles could not be removed by ventilation alone within 30-min in rooms with ACHvent<15. PAC reduced aerosol accumulation and accelerated aerosol removal, and accumulated aerosols could be completely removed in 4 to 12-min by ventilation combined with PAC. Effectiveness of the PAC was especially prominent in rooms with poor ventilation. Added benefit of PAC in aerosol removal was inversely correlated with ACHvent. CONCLUSIONS: Aerosol accumulation may occur in dental treatment rooms with poor ventilation. Addition of PAC with a HEPA filter significantly reduced aerosol accumulation and accelerated aerosol removal. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Addition of PAC with a HEPA filter improves aerosol removal in rooms with low ventilation rates.","Ren, Yan-Fang; Huang, Qirong; Marzouk, Tamer; Richard, Ray; Pembroke, Karen; Martone, Pat; Venner, Tom; Malmstrom, Hans; Eliav, Eli",J Dent,197,22

The available evidence is uncertain, and knowledge on the subject is evolving. The aim of our cohort study was to evaluate the association between corticosteroid therapy and hospital mortality, in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 after balancing for possible confounders. One thousand four hundred forty four patients were admitted to our hospital with a positive RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2, 559 patients (39%) were exposed to corticosteroids during hospital stay, 844 (61%) were not exposed to corticosteroids. In the cohort of patients exposed to corticosteroids, 171 (30.6%) died. In the cohort of patients not exposed to corticosteroids, 183 (21.7%) died (unadjusted p < 0.001). Nonetheless, exposure to corticosteroids was not associated with in-hospital mortality after balancing with overlap weight propensity score (adjusted p = 0.25). Patients in the corticosteroids cohort had a reduced risk of ICU admission (adjusted p < 0.001). Treatment with corticosteroids did not affect hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19 after balancing for confounders.

Low-intensity internet interventions allow them to benefit from psychological support even when institutional help is not available. Focusing on enhancing psychological resources-self-efficacy and perceived social support-makes an intervention relevant for various occupations within the medical profession. Previously, these resources were found to operate both individually or sequentially with self-efficacy either preceding social support (cultivation process) or following it (enabling process). OBJECTIVE: The objective of this randomized controlled trial is to compare the efficacy of 4 variants of Med-Stress, a self-guided internet intervention that aims to improve the multifaceted well-being of medical professionals. METHODS: This study was conducted before the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants (N=1240) were recruited mainly via media campaigns and social media targeted ads. They were assigned to 1 of the following 4 groups: experimental condition reflecting the cultivation process, experimental condition reflecting the enabling process, active comparator enhancing only self-efficacy, and active comparator enhancing only perceived social support. Outcomes included 5 facets of well-being: job stress, job burnout, work engagement, depression, and job-related traumatic stress. Measurements were taken on the web at baseline (time 1), immediately after intervention (time 2), and at a 6-month follow-up (time 3). To analyze the data, linear mixed effects models were used on the intention-to-treat sample. The trial was partially blinded as the information about the duration of the trial, which was different for experimental and control conditions, was public. RESULTS: At time 2, job stress was lower in the condition reflecting the cultivation process than in the one enhancing social support only (d=-0.21), and at time 3, participants in that experimental condition reported the lowest job stress when compared with all 3 remaining study groups (ds between -0.24 and -0.41). For job-related traumatic stress, we found a significant difference between study groups only at time 3: stress was lower in the experimental condition in which self-efficacy was enhanced first than in the active comparator enhancing solely social support (d=-0.24). The same result was found for work engagement (d=-0.20), which means that it was lower in exactly the same condition that was found beneficial for stress relief. There were no differences between study conditions for burnout and depression neither at time 2 nor at time 3. There was a high dropout in the study (1023/1240, 82.50% at posttest), reflecting the pragmatic nature of this trial. CONCLUSIONS: The Med-Stress internet intervention improves some components of well-being-most notably job stress-when activities are completed in a specific sequence. The decrease in work engagement could support the notion of dark side of this phenomenon, but further research is needed.

However, lockdown measures during COVID-19 have limited people's opportunity to exercise regularly. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of eight weeks of Fitness and Dance training, followed by four weeks of COVID-19-induced detraining, on cardiac adaptations and physical performance indicators in older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Twelve older adults (6 males and 6 females) with MCI (age, 73 ± 4.4 y; body mass, 75.3 ± 6.4 kg; height, 172 ± 8 cm; MMSE score: 24-27) participated in eight weeks of a combined Fitness-Dance training intervention (two sessions/week) followed by four weeks of training cessation induced by COVID-19 lockdowns. Wireless Polar Team Pro and Polar heart rate sensors (H10) were used to monitor covered distance, speed, heart rate (HR min, avg and max), time in HR zone 1 to 5, strenuousness (load score), beat-to-beat interval (max RR and avg RR) and heart rate variability (HRV-RMSSD). One-way ANOVA was used to analyze the data of the three test sessions (T1: first training session, T2: last training session of the eight-week training program, and T3: first training session after the four-week training cessation). Statistical analysis showed that eight weeks of combined Fitness-Dance training induced beneficial cardiac adaptations by decreasing HR (HR min, HR avg and HR max) with p < 0.001, ES = 0.5-0.6 and &#916; = -7 to-9 bpm, and increasing HRV related responses (max and avg RR and RMSSD), with p < 0.01 and ES = 0.4. Consequently, participants spent more time in comfortable HR zones (e.g., p < 0.0005; ES = 0.7; &#916; = 25% for HR zone 1) and showed reduced strenuousness (p = 0.02, &#916; = -15% for load score), despite the higher covered total distance and average speed (p < 0.01; ES = 0.4). However, these changes were reversed after only four weeks of COVID-19 induced detraining, with values of all parameters returning to their baseline levels. In conclusion, eight weeks of combined Fitness-Dance training seems to be an efficient strategy to promote cardioprotective benefits in older adults with MCI. Importantly, to maintain these health benefits, training has to be continued and detraining periods should be reduced. During a pandemic, home-based exercise programs may provide an effective and efficient alternative of physical training.","Ammar, Achraf; Boukhris, Omar; Halfpaap, Nicole; Labott, Berit Kristin; Langhans, Corinna; Herold, Fabian; Grässler, Bernhard; Müller, Patrick; Trabelsi, Khaled; Chtourou, Hamdi; Zmijewski, Piotr; Driss, Tarak; Glenn, Jordan M; Müller, Notger G; Hoekelmann, Anita",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),197,10

RESULTS: During the second quarter of 2020, the highest 016-call rate was recorded (12.19 per 10,000 women aged 15 or over). Policy report rates (16.62), POs (2.81), and fatalities (0.19 per 1,000,000 women aged 15 or over) decreased in the second quarter of 2020. In the third quarter, 016-calls decreased, and policy reports and POs increased. Four clusters were identified, and significant differences in unemployment rates between clusters were observed (F = 3.05, p &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 lockdown fostered a change in IPV-affected women's help-seeking behavior. Differences between the volume of contacts made via 016-call and the policy reports generated provide evidence for the existence of barriers to IPV-service access during the lockdown and the period of remote working. More efforts are needed to reorganize services to cope with IPV in non-presential situations. The provinces with the highest 016-call and PO rates were also those with the highest rates of unemployment, a worrying result given the current socioeconomic crisis.","Vives-Cases, C.; Parra-Casado, D.; Estevez, J.

DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: In this cross-sectional study, an online survey was distributed to a convenience sample via Facebook advertising and the Medical Research Institute of New Zealand's social media platforms and mailing list. Respondents were able to share a link to the survey via their own social media platforms and by email. Results were collected over 6 days during Alert Level 4 from respondents living in New Zealand, aged 16 years and over. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: The primary outcome was the mean size of a self-isolating household unit or bubble. Secondary outcomes included the mean number of households in each bubble, the proportion of bubbles containing essential workers and/or vulnerable people, and the mean number of times the home was left each week. RESULTS: 14 876 surveys were included in the analysis. The mean (SD) bubble size was 3.58 (4.63) people, with mean (SD) number of households 1.26 (0.77). The proportion of bubbles containing one or more essential workers, or one or more vulnerable persons was 45.3% and 42.1%, respectively. The mean number of times individual bubble members left their home in the previous week was 12.9 (12.4). Bubbles that contained at least one vulnerable individual had fewer outings over the previous week compared with bubbles that did not contain a vulnerable person. The bubble sizes were similar by respondent ethnicity. CONCLUSION: In this New Zealand convenience sample, bubble sizes were small, mostly limited to one household, and a high proportion contained essential workers and/or vulnerable people. Understanding these characteristics from a country which achieved a low COVID-19 infection rate may help inform public health interventions during this and future pandemics.","Kearns, Nethmi; Shortt, Nick; Kearns, Ciléin; Eathorne, Allie; Holliday, Mark; Mackle, Diane; Martindale, John; Semprini, Alex; Weatherall, Mark; Beasley, Richard; Braithwaite, Irene",BMJ Open,197,1

Approximately one quarter of patients infected with COVID-19 require ICU care, and among these patients, the mortality increases to 49%. Comparative clinical studies have demonstrated that severe and critical disease in patients with COVID-19 is associated with the time from the onset of symptoms to hospital admission. Similarly, an effective quarantine policy that isolates or hospital- izes diseased individuals as soon as possible, to limit their activity, is an important reason for the reduction in the rates of severe and critical disease in China. A number of patients with COVID-19 present mild symptoms at the early stages, while subsequently experiencing rapid deterioration with severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Before the virus invades the lungs and hypoxemia occurs, it is necessary to increase the oxygen supply, which enables the body to fight the virus. Lower oxygen reserves, which are influenced by factors, such as excess activity or changes in vital signs, can increase oxygen consumption, and shifts in the balance of oxygen supply and demand and can lead to critical illness and death. The present review article discusses whether early oxygen supplementation, and reducing the oxygen demand may result in a better prognosis of patients with COVID-19. © 2020 Spandidos Publications.

This is in line with the indications of the 2007 EU Charter of Leipzig which calls for integrated planning strategies between rural and urban, small, medium, large, and metropolitan areas. Therefore, an ecological multidisciplinary approach to the territory, using the concept of ecology proposed by the 1950s by Dioxiadis, is suggested, concept then taken up by Appold and Kasarda in the early 1990s. And it is the key word of the Encyclical Laudato Sii for the Care of the Common House of Pope Francis 2015 which refers to the principles of the 1992 Rio Conference based on the centrality of “human ecology” and on the alliance between man and nature, which in 1995 Scandurra had requested in L’ambiente dell’uomo (The Environment of Man). The phenomenological, from the Greek world phenomenon, is the methodological keystone of the paper. The well-being of the person and of the communities must be the objective of those who deal with the development of the territory. Rural areas in this sense can offer great opportunities, generated today by the many technological innovations, both tangible and intangible, potentially available. However, this should not overshadow the need for links that facilitate access to these areas. One of the important positive effects of the presence in rural areas is the reduction of hydrogeological risk thanks to the presence and daily maintenance of them. Among the aspects that raise questions that are difficult to answer is the risk that the more accessible an area becomes, the more there is a threat of its loss of uniqueness. Last but not least, it should be pointed out that the rural areas are a sort of territorial “reserve” for populations that have to abandon their lands due to climate change or who seek a quality of life not possible in large metropolitan areas. All this means that some geographical areas, primarily Calabria, are potentially territories where scenarios can be hypothesized for a different modes of anthropizations indispensable to move toward the objectives of the UN 2020–2030 Charter on sustainable development.

This study sought to quantify the change in dental visits in 2020 compared with 2019. METHODS: This retrospective, observational study examined the percentage change in weekly visits to dental offices by state (inclusive of the District of Columbia), nationally, and by county-level COVID-19 incidence using geographic information from the mobile applications of 45 million smartphones during 2019 and 2020. RESULTS: From March through August 2020, weekly visits to dental offices were 33% lower, on average, than in 2019. Weekly visits were 34% lower, on average, in counties with the highest COVID-19 rates. The greatest decline was observed during the week of April 12, 2020, when there were 66% fewer weekly visits to dental offices. The 5 states (inclusive of the District of Columbia) with the greatest declines in weekly visits from 2019 through 2020, ranging from declines of 38% through 53%, were California, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Massachusetts, and New Jersey. CONCLUSIONS: Weekly visits to US dental offices declined drastically during the early phases of the COVID-19 pandemic. Although rates of weekly visits rebounded substantially by June 2020, rates remain about 20% lower than the prior year as of August 2020. These findings highlight the economic challenges faced by dentists owing to the pandemic.

Its clinical presentation can vary from the asymptomatic state to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi-organ dysfunction. Due to our insufficient understanding of its pathophysiology and lack of effective treatment, the morbidity and mortality of severe COVID-19 patients are high. Patients with COVID-19 develop ARDS fueled by exaggerated neutrophil influx into the lungs and cytokine storm. B-1a cells represent a unique subpopulation of B lymphocytes critical for circulating natural antibodies, innate immunity, and immunoregulation. These cells spontaneously produce natural IgM, interleukin (IL)-10, and granulocyte-monocyte colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Natural IgM neutralizes viruses and opsonizes bacteria, IL-10 attenuates the cytokine storm, and GM-CSF induces IgM production by B-1a cells in an autocrine manner. Indeed, B-1a cells have been shown to ameliorate influenza virus infection, sepsis, and pneumonia, all of which are similar to COVID-19. The recent discovery of B-1a cells in humans further reinforces their potentially critical role in the immune response against SARS-CoV-2 and their anticipated translational applications against viral and microbial infections. Given that B-1a cells protect against ARDS via immunoglobulin production and the anti-COVID-19 effects of convalescent plasma treatment, we recommend that studies be conducted to further examine the role of B-1a cells in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and explore their therapeutic potential to treat COVID-19 patients.","Aziz, Monowar; Brenner, Max; Wang, Ping",Shock,197,20

This is the question that has occupied ophthalmologists since the beginning of the outbreak. In order to infect a certain type of tissue specific receptors for each virus and sometimes also coreceptors or other proteins must be present. The aim of this review was to summarize and reflect the current state of research with the help of the currently available literature as of 28 May 2020. At the time of the research, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was clearly identified as the receptor and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) as the necessary protease to enable the infection of human cells with SARS-CoV­2. In the eye both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are expressed, although sometimes very weakly and with varying degrees in different tissues. It is noteworthy that very different results were obtained with different methods. Several reasons can account for this effect: Firstly, the method of detection or preservation of the tissue, secondly, the possibly different expression of the tested tissue samples and thirdly, a possibly rapid loss of receptor expression post-mortem. Therefore, an infection of the eye seems possible, which has already been reported in various publications. The amount of virus or receptor expression necessary to cause an infection is not known. According to current state of knowledge the eye is not considered to be a high-risk tissue due to the low ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression.

359093,359093,359093,Vaccine development: Covid-19 and beyond,13.981536,4.613971,2021,"INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Common laboratory parameters are crucial in aiding coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) case detection. This study aimed to determine the differences between laboratory parameters in (1) COVID-19 versus non-COVID-19 pneumonia, and (2) severe versus non-severe COVID-19 cases. METHODS: Studies were collected until March 2020, and retrieved parameters include leukocyte, neutrophil, thrombocyte, and lymphocyte counts in addition to C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT) and D-dimer levels. In the presence of heterogeneity, the random-effect model (REM) was used instead of the fixed-effect model (FEM). RESULTS: Seven studies in the first analysis showed significantly lower leukocyte, neutrophil and platelet counts in COVID-19 pneumonia (SMD=-0.42, 95%CI -0.60 to -0.25, p<0.00001, SMD=-0.23, 95%CI -0.41 to -0.06, p=0.01, SMD=-0.54, 95%CI -0.91 to -0.16, p=0.0005) compared to non-COVID-19 pneumonia. Twenty-six studies in the second analysis showed significantly lower lymphocyte and thrombocyte counts (SMD=-0.56, 95%CI -0.71 to -0.40, p<0.0001, SMD=-0.32, 95%CI -0.49 to -0.15, p=0.0002) and significantly higher leukocyte, neutrophil, D-dimer, and CRP (SMD=0.31, 95%CI 0.07-0.56, p=0.01; SMD=0.44, 95%CI 0.24-0.64, p<0.0001; SMD=0.53, 95%CI 0.31-0.75, p<0.00001; SMD=0.97, 95%CI 0.70-1.24, p<0.00001) in severe COVID-19 compared to non-severe COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, thrombocyte count is key in both diagnosis and prognosis. Low leukocyte and neutrophil counts are markers of COVID-19 infection, but contrastingly higher counts indicate progressive COVID-19. And although lymphocyte, D-dimer and CRP levels did not demonstrate diagnostic value, all indicate severity of COVID-19. Confirmation of these findings should be performed in future studies.","Soraya, Gita Vita; Ulhaq, Zulvikar Syambani",Med Clin (Barc),197,11

Health care workers are at risk of infection from aerosolisation of respiratory secretions, droplet and contact spread. There are a number of procedures that represent a high risk of aerosol generation during cardiothoracic surgery. It is important that adequate training, equipment and procedures are in place to reduce that risk. RECOMMENDATIONS: We provide a number of key recommendations, which reduce the risk of aerosol generation during cardiothoracic surgery and help protect patients and staff. These include general measures such as patient risk stratification, appropriate use of personal protective equipment, consideration to delay surgery in positive patients, and careful attention to theatre planning and preparation. There are also recommended procedural interventions during airway management, transoesophageal echocardiography, cardiopulmonary bypass, chest drain management and specific cardiothoracic surgical procedures. Controversies exist regarding the management of low risk patients undergoing procedures at high risk of aerosol generation, and recommendations for these patients will change depending on the regional prevalence, risk of community transmission and the potential for asymptomatic patients attending for these procedures. CHANGES IN MANAGEMENT AS A RESULT OF THIS STATEMENT: This statement reflects changes in management based on expert opinion, national guidelines and available evidence. Our knowledge with regard to COVID-19 continues to evolve and with this, guidance may change and develop. Our colleagues are urged to follow national guidelines and institutional recommendations regarding best practices to protect their patients and themselves.

For improving the knowledge about the pandemic consequences for cancer care, this article aims to identify the effects of mitigation strategies developed to reduce the impact of such delays and disruptions. METHODS: Systematic review with a comprehensive search including formal databases, cancer and COVID-19 data sources, gray literature, and manual search. We considered clinical trials, observational longitudinal studies, cross-sectional studies, before-and-after studies, case series, and case studies. The selection, data extraction, and methodological assessment were performed by two independent reviewers. The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed by specific tools. The mitigation strategies identified were described in detail and their effects were summarized narratively. RESULTS: Of 6,692 references reviewed, 28 were deemed eligible, and 9 studies with low to moderate methodological quality were included. Five multiple strategies and four single strategies were reported, and the possible effects of mitigating delays and disruptions in cancer care because of COVID-19 are inconsistent. The only comparative study reported a 48.7% reduction observed in the number of outpatient visits to the hospital accompanied by a small reduction in imaging and an improvement in radiation treatments after the implementation of a multiple organizational strategy. CONCLUSION: The findings emphasize the infrequency of measuring and reporting mitigation strategies that specifically address patients' outcomes and thus a scarcity of high-quality evidence to inform program development. This review reinforces the need of adopting standardized measurement methods to monitor the impact of the mitigation strategies proposed to reduce the effects of delays and disruptions in cancer health care because of COVID-19.","Pacheco, Rafael Leite; Martimbianco, Ana Luiza Cabrera; Roitberg, Felipe; Ilbawi, Andre; Riera, Rachel",JCO Glob Oncol,197,21

PURPOSE: Intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) therapy is used in patients with hypogammaglobulinemia to lower the risk of infections. IVIG and subcutaneous IVIG (SCIG) therapy have been to shown to be safe and effective when administered as clinic-based infusions. Concern from both patients and providers for increased transmission of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) virus to immunosuppressed patients with scheduled medical visits and procedures made it necessary for us to reassess our process of how we manage patient care in general and chronic clinic infusions in particular. Here we describe our experience of transitioning patients from clinic-based to home based IVIG and/or SCIG infusions to decrease the risk of COVID-19 exposure. METHODS: Criteria were developed to identify high-risk immunosuppressed patients who would be appropriate candidates for potential conversion to home based IVIG infusions. Data were collected via chart review, and cost analysis was performed using Medicare Part B reimbursement data. A patient outcome questionnaire was developed for administration through follow-up phone calls. RESULTS: From March to May 2020, 45 patients met criteria for home-based infusion, with 27 patients (60%) agreeing to home-based infusion. Posttransition patient outcomes assessment, conducted in 26 patients (96%), demonstrated good patient understanding of the home-based infusion process. No infusion-related complications were reported, and 24 patients (92%) had no concerns about receiving future IVIG and/or SCIG doses at home. No patient tested positive for COVID-19 during the study period. Clinic infusion visits decreased by 26.6 visits per month, resulting in a total of 106 hours of additional available infusion chair time per month and associated cost savings of $12,877. CONCLUSION: Transition of clinic based to home based IVIG/SCIG infusion can be successfully done to decrease potential exposure during a pandemic in a high-risk immunosuppressed population, with no impact on patient satisfaction, adherence, or efficacy. The home-based infusion initiative was associated with a reduction in costs to patients and an increase in available chair time in the infusion clinic.","Perreault, Sarah; Schiffer, Molly; Clinchy-Jarmoszko, Virginia; Bocchetta, Nicole; Barbarotta, Lisa; Abdelghany, Osama; Foss, Francine; Huntington, Scott; Seropian, Stuart; Isufi, Iris",Am. j. health system pharm,197,26

Recently a novel coronavirus (nCOVID-19) has first emerged in China, causing multiple symptoms in humans and closely related to those caused by SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) and MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome). The nCOVID-19 has reported in Wuhan city of China has recently infected over six million people and at least 0.4 million confirmed deaths all over the world, while 2.8 million people has recovered from this deadly virus. Many instances of this respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection have already reported in more than 216 countries and territories. In contrast, the majority of cases reported in the USA, Brazil, Russia, Spain, UK, Italy, France and many more countries. In today's context, the coronavirus is one of the significant issues faced by the world with plenty of cases. In these circumstances, rapid reviews which recommended by WHO (World Health Organization), and these recommendations are very significant, helpful and cover current data with different preventive measures developed by the Saudi CDC (Saudi Centre for Disease Prevention and Control). This review article describes the possible modes of transmission so that proper preventive actions should be taking. Importantly, this work mentioned the animal reservoir through which may infect humans, and it must be identified to break the transmission chain. In additions, this review paper briefly discussed the spread of the coronavirus in the Arabian Peninsula and what precaution measures are in place by each country to limit the spreading of this virus. Finally, since the number of infected people specifically those with close contact with nCOVID-19 patients is increasing daily and appears unstoppable, we used the preventive measures by pharmacists as part of health care professions.","Perveen, Shagufta; Orfali, Raha; Azam, Muhammad Shafiq ul; Aati, Hanan Y.; Bukhari, Khulud; Bukhari, Sarah I.; Al-Taweel, Areej",Saudi Pharm.

As many comorbidities are common in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), we sought to investigate the effects of comorbidities in these patients on infection severity. AIM: To evaluate association between individual comorbidities and COVID-19 infection severity among patients with IBD. METHODS: Data were obtained from SECURE-IBD, an international registry created to evaluate COVID-19 outcomes in patients with IBD. We used multivariable regression to analyze associations between eleven non-IBD comorbidities and a composite primary outcome of COVID-19-related hospitalization or death. Comorbidities were first modeled individually, adjusting for potential confounders. Next, to determine the independent effect of comorbidities, we fit a model including all comorbidities as covariates. RESULTS: We analyzed 2,035 patients from 58 countries (mean age 42.7 years, 50.6% male). A total of 538 patients (26.4%) experienced severe COVID-19. All comorbidities but a history of stroke and obesity were associated with severe infection in our initial analysis, with adjusted odds ratios ranging from 1.9 to 3.7. In a model including all comorbidities significantly associated with the composite outcome in the initial analysis, as well as other confounders, most comorbidities remained significant, with the highest risk in chronic kidney disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. CONCLUSION: Many non-IBD comorbidities are associated with a two to threefold increased risk of COVID-19 hospitalization or death among patients with IBD. These data can be used to risk-stratify and guide treatment and lifestyle decisions during the ongoing pandemic.","Parekh, Rajen; Zhang, Xian; Ungaro, Ryan C; Brenner, Erica J; Agrawal, Manasi; Colombel, Jean-Frederic; Kappelman, Michael D",Dig. dis. sci,197,1

Rather, it has reinforced and rescaled itself, expanding into new market segments and urban territories. However, while academic scholarship has convincingly exposed the reconfiguration of financialization processes, it has paid surprisingly little attention to how these processes are also contested from within society and the economy. In response to this gap in the literature, I propose in this contribution a threefold research agenda, calling out for more research on (i) financial market reforms aimed at dismantling finance-led housing accumulation; (ii) policy focused on strengthening the public and affordable housing sector; and (iii) changing modes of urban governance and ‘anti-political’ social movements which can contest housing financialization locally. Taking into account these three fields of inquiry, I invite housing scholars to explore how–and if –de-financializing tendencies can become ecologically dominant in post-crisis urban housing markets.","Wijburg, Gertjan",Hous.

Methods: The cumulative number of COVID-19 deaths was obtained from USA Facts. Variables related to social vulnerability were obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Social Vulnerability Index and the 2018 5-Year American Community Survey. Data were analyzed using spatial autoregression models. Results: Lowest income and educational level, as well as high proportions of single parent households, mobile home residents, and people without health insurance were positively associated with a high cumulative number of COVID-19 deaths. Conclusion: In conclusion, there are regional differences in the cumulative number of COVID-19 deaths in United States counties, which are affected by various social vulnerabilities. Hence, these findings underscore the need to take social vulnerability into account when planning interventions to reduce COVID-19 deaths.","Sung, Baksun",,197,5

The main objective of this study is to the identify changes in neurosurgical referrals, admissions and management during the COVID-19 pandemic. We also aim to assess how current practise could be adapted to help manage future pandemic peaks. METHODS: Data was collected for the first 31 days of lockdown during 2020 (23rd March - 22nd April) and compared to the same time period in the years 2016-2019. We assessed the number of referrals, admissions and clinical information of patients during this period with a key emphasis on head trauma. RESULTS: Neurosurgical head injury referrals and admissions reduced by 57.5% and 48.3% respectively during the first 31 days of lockdown when compared to the mean figures for the same period in the previous 4 years. This was also seen with head trauma with a 21.9% decline in referrals and 39.1% reduction in admissions for the period of interest.

BACKGROUND: COVID-19 advanced rapidly and then spread worldwide. Pregnant women were more susceptible to the COVID-19 infection. Furthermore, it is not clear whether this infection will increase the risk of congenital monstrosity, foetal growth restriction, premature delivery or cause other long-term adverse effects. DESIGN: A descriptive, cross-sectional survey. METHODS: A total of 331 pregnant women participated in this study. And this research adhered to the STROBE guideline. The psychological questionnaire for emergent events of public health, pregnancy stress scale and security questionnaire were used to collect data. The hypothetical path model was tested using the SPSS version 25.0 software and AMOS version 26.0 software. RESULTS: Fear and depression were the most common psychological responses among pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic. The hypothesis model of this study fitted the data well, and the results showed that psychological response positively affected pregnancy stress, while security sense negatively affected pregnancy stress; security sense mediated between psychological response and pregnancy stress. CONCLUSION: Nurses and midwives can help reduce the stress in pregnant women by alleviating their psychological response to the COVID-19 pandemic and by improving their security sense. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: It is essential for the health staff to build trust with pregnant women and their families, and communicate accurate information to them. Nurses should promptly conduct a psychological response evaluation and psychological guidance for pregnant women to alleviate their fears and hypochondria related to COVID-19.","Zheng, Qing-Xiang; Jiang, Xiu-Min; Lin, Yan; Liu, Gui-Hua; Lin, Yu-Ping; Kang, Yu-Lan; Liu, Xiu-Wu",J. clin. nurs,197,10

We conducted this study to assess how COVID-19 cases clustered across districts in Bangladesh and whether the pattern and duration of clusters changed following the country's containment strategy using Geographic information system (GIS) software. We calculated the epidemiological measures including incidence, case fatality rate (CFR) and spatiotemporal pattern of COVID-19. We used inverse distance weighting (IDW), Geographically weighted regression (GWR), Moran's I and Getis-Ord Gi* statistics for prediction, spatial autocorrelation and hotspot identification. We used retrospective space-time scan statistic to analyse clusters of COVID-19 cases. COVID-19 has a CFR of 1.4%. Over 50% of cases were reported among young adults (21-40 years age). The incidence varies from 0.03 - 0.95 at the end of March to 15.59-308.62 per 100,000, at the end of July. Global Moran's Index indicates a robust spatial autocorrelation of COVID-19 cases. Local Moran's I analysis stated a distinct High-High (HH) clustering of COVID-19 cases among Dhaka, Gazipur and Narayanganj districts. Twelve statistically significant high rated clusters were identified by space-time scan statistics using a discrete Poisson model. IDW predicted the cases at the undetermined area, and GWR showed a strong relationship between population density and case frequency, which was further established with Moran's I (0.734; p &#8804; 0.01). Dhaka and its surrounding six districts were identified as the significant hotspot whereas Chattogram was an extended infected area, indicating the gradual spread of the virus to peripheral districts. This study provides novel insights into the geostatistical analysis of COVID-19 clusters and hotspots that might assist the policy planner to predict the spatiotemporal transmission dynamics and formulate imperative control strategies of SARS-CoV-2 in Bangladesh.

Recommendations to prevent infection include appropriate and frequent handwashing plus physical and social distancing. We conducted an exploratory observational study to assess compliance with these recommendations in selected transportation stations in Ghana. A one-hour audit of 45 public transport stations in the Greater Accra region was carried out between 27th and 29th March 2020. Using an adapted World Health Organization (WHO) hand hygiene assessment scale, the availability and use of handwashing facilities, social distancing, and ongoing public education on COVID-19 prevention measures were assessed, weighted and scored to determine the level of compliance of stations. Compliance with recommendations was categorized as ""inadequate"" ""basic"", ""intermediate"" and ""advanced"", based on the overall score. Majority (80%) of stations in Accra have at least one Veronica Bucket with flowing water and soap, but the number of washing places at each station is not adequate. Only a small minority (18%) of stations were communicating the need to wash hands frequently and appropriately, and to practice social/physical distancing while at the station. In most stations (95%), hand washing practice was either not observed, or only infrequently. Almost all stations (93%) did not have alcohol-based hand sanitizers available for public use, while social distancing was rarely practiced (only 2%). In over 90% of the stations, face masks were either not worn or only worn by a few passengers.

It is unknown whether access to telemedicine care has been equitable during this time. This study aimed to identify patient-level factors associated with adoption of telemedicine for subspecialty diabetes care during the pandemic. METHODS: We conducted an explanatory sequential mixed-methods study using data from a single academic medical center. We used multivariate logistic regression to explore associations between telemedicine use and demographic factors for patients receiving subspecialty diabetes care between March 19 and June 30, 2020. We then surveyed a sample of patients who received in-person care to understand why these patients did not use telemedicine. RESULTS: Among 1292 patients who received subspecialty diabetes care during the study period, those over age 65 were less likely to use telemedicine (OR: 0.34, 95% CI: 0.22-0.52, P < .001), as were patients with a primary language other than English (OR: 0.53, 95% CI: 0.31-0.91, P = .02), and patients with public insurance (OR: 0.64, 95% CI: 0.49-0.84, P = .001). Perceived quality of care and technological barriers were the most common reasons cited for choosing in-person care during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that, amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been disparities in telemedicine use by age, language, and insurance for patients with diabetes mellitus. We anticipate telemedicine will continue to be an important care modality for chronic conditions in the years ahead. Significant work must therefore be done to ensure that telemedicine services do not introduce or widen population health disparities.","Haynes, Sarah C; Kompala, Tejaswi; Neinstein, Aaron; Rosenthal, Jennifer; Crossen, Stephanie",J Diabetes Sci Technol,197,29

METHODS: We recruited 47 patients with mild (n = 20), moderate (n = 9), or severe (n = 18) COVID-19 and measured 2 plasma biomarkers of CNS injury by single molecule array, neurofilament light chain protein (NfL; a marker of intra-axonal neuronal injury) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAp; a marker of astrocytic activation/injury), in samples collected at presentation and again in a subset after a mean of 11.4 days. Cross-sectional results were compared with results from 33 age-matched controls derived from an independent cohort. RESULTS: The patients with severe COVID-19 had higher plasma concentrations of GFAp (p = 0.001) and NfL (p < 0.001) than controls, while GFAp was also increased in patients with moderate disease (p = 0.03). In patients with severe disease, an early peak in plasma GFAp decreased on follow-up (p < 0.01), while NfL showed a sustained increase from first to last follow-up (p < 0.01), perhaps reflecting a sequence of early astrocytic response and more delayed axonal injury. CONCLUSION: We show neurochemical evidence of neuronal injury and glial activation in patients with moderate and severe COVID-19. Further studies are needed to clarify the frequency and nature of COVID-19-related CNS damage and its relation to both clinically defined CNS events such as hypoxic and ischemic events and mechanisms more closely linked to systemic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection and consequent immune activation, as well as to evaluate the clinical utility of monitoring plasma NfL and GFAp in the management of this group of patients.","Kanberg, Nelly; Ashton, Nicholas J; Andersson, Lars-Magnus; Yilmaz, Aylin; Lindh, Magnus; Nilsson, Staffan; Price, Richard W; Blennow, Kaj; Zetterberg, Henrik; Gisslén, Magnus",Neurology,197,24

Nurses who work with respiratory patients have been at the forefront of the pandemic response. Lessons can be learnt from these nurses' experiences in order to support these nurses during the existing pandemic and retain and mobilise this skilled workforce for future pandemics. METHODS: This study explores UK nurses' experiences of working in a respiratory environment during the COVID-19 pandemic. An e-survey was distributed via professional respiratory societies; the survey included a resilience scale, the GAD7 (anxiety) and the PHQ9 (depression) tools. Demographic data was collected on age, gender, ethnicity, nursing experience and background, clinical role in the pandemic, and home-life and work balance. RESULTS: Two hundred and fifty-five responses were received for the survey, predominately women (89%, 226/255), aged over 35 (79%, 202/255). Nearly 21% (40/191) experiencing moderate to severe or severe symptoms of anxiety. Similar levels are seen for depression (17.2%, 31/181). 18.9% (34/180) had a low or very low resilience score. Regression analysis showed that for both depression and anxiety variables, age and years of qualification provided the best model fit. Younger nurses with less experience have higher levels of anxiety and depression and had lower resilience. CONCLUSION: This cohort experienced significant levels of anxiety and depression, with moderate to high levels of resilience. Support mechanisms and interventions need to be put in place to support all nurses during pandemic outbreaks, particularly younger or less experienced staff.","Roberts, N J; McAloney-Kocaman, K; Lippiett, K; Ray, E; Welch, L; Kelly, C",Respir Med,197,24

Chest x-rays, especially portable, still form a part of majority of official guidelines, with reports of the suggestive radiologic features. The potential of CT scan and ultrasound is also realised, with earlier detection rate. Typical radiologic findings of bilateral, asymmetrical, crazy-paved ground glass opacification, consolidation, reverse halo sign, opacities, progressing to fibrosis are well described for both the X-ray and CT scan. Atypical findings include airway changes, pleural effusion, pulmonary nodules and acute pulmonary embolism. Absence of lymphadenopathy, pleural effusion and pneumothorax is notable. The role of portable lung ultrasound, reported to be useful in emergency, is yet to be established in the guidelines. Disinfection of the equipment is a major concern.

However, cPORT is associated with acute toxicity, especially in the head and neck (H&N) region, and requires daily treatments over several weeks. We previously reported high rates of durable local control with minimal toxicity using 8-Gy single-fraction radiation therapy (SFRT) in the metastatic setting. We report early results on a cohort of patients with localized H&N MCC who received postoperative SFRT if a cPORT regimen was not feasible. Methods and Materials: Twelve patients with localized MCC of the H&N (clinical/pathologic stages I-II) and no prior radiation therapy to the region were identified from an institutional review board-approved prospective registry who underwent surgical resection followed by postoperative SFRT. Time to event was calculated starting from the date of resection before SFRT. The cumulative incidence of in-field locoregional recurrences and out-of-field recurrences was estimated with death as a competing risk. Results: Twelve patients with H&N MCC were identified with clinical/pathologic stages I-II H&N MCC. Median age at diagnosis was 81 years (range, 58-96 years); 25% had immunosuppression. At a median follow-up of 19 months (range, 8-34), there were no in-field locoregional recurrences. A single out-of-field regional recurrence was observed, which was successfully salvaged. There were no MCC-specific deaths. No radiation-associated toxicities greater than grade 1 (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v5) were observed. Conclusions: Preliminary data suggest that SFRT could offer a potential alternative to cPORT to treat the primary site for localized H&N MCC, particularly in elderly or frail patients, with promising in-field local control and minimal toxicity. Further data with validation in larger cohorts are needed to confirm the sustained safety and efficacy of postoperative SFRT.","Cook, Maclean M; Schaub, Stephanie K; Goff, Peter H; Fu, Alex; Park, Song Y; Hippe, Daniel S; Liao, Jay J; Apisarnthanarax, Smith; Bhatia, Shailender; Tseng, Yolanda D; Nghiem, Paul T; Parvathaneni, Upendra",,197,30

This meta-analysis was strictly focused on the influence of smoking history on the severe and critical outcomes on people with COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted in eight online databases before 1 February 2021. All studies meeting our selection criteria were included and evaluated. Stata 14.0 software was used to analyze the data. Results: A total of 109 articles involving 517,020 patients were included in this meta-analysis. A statistically significant association was discovered between smoking history and COVID-19 severity, the pooled OR was 1.55 (95%CI: 1.41-1.71). Smoking was significantly associated with the risk of admission to intensive care unit (ICU) (OR=1.73, 95%CI: 1.36-2.19), increased mortality (OR=1.58, 95%CI: 1.38-1.81), and critical diseases composite endpoints (OR=1.61, 95%CI: 1.35-1.93), whereas there was no relationship with mechanical ventilation. The pooled prevalence of smoking using the random effects model (REM) was 15% (95%CI: 14%-16%). Meta-regression analysis showed that age (P=0.004), hypertension (P=0.007), diabetes (P=0.029), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (P=0.001) were covariates that affect the association. Conclusions: Smoking was associated with severe or critical outcomes and increased the risk of admission to ICU and mortality in COVID-19 patients, but not associated with mechanical ventilation. This association was more significant for former smokers than in current smokers. Current smokers also had a higher risk of developing severe COVID-19 compared with non-smokers. More detailed data, which are representative for more counties, are needed to confirm these preliminary findings.","Zhang, Huimei; Ma, Shaodi; Han, Tiantian; Qu, Guangbo; Cheng, Ce; Uy, John Patrick; Shaikh, Mohammad Baseem; Zhou, Qin; Song, Evelyn J; Sun, Chenyu",Eur J Integr Med,197,33

The lack of monitoring of the competence of educators in the online system causes a decrease in the character of students. This is due to the lack of exemplary in thinking ethics speaking and acting obtained by students. It is important to instill character education in students so that they have characters based on religious values such as in Islamic boarding schools. This research aims to examine the existence of Islamic boarding schools in implementing character education in the pandemic era with the object Pondok Modern Darussalam Gontor (PMDG) for girls 1 Mantingan Ngawi East jJva. This research is a literature study with the type of research is qualitatively while the method is descriptive analytic. The results show that PMDG for girls 1 is able to show its existence in implementing character education even in the pandemic era. This can be seen from the effectiveness of the dormitory system that can support face-to-face learning as an effort to internalize character education in Islamic boarding schools. This can be achieved by applying the discipline health protocol in the pesantren environment before starting face-to-face learning. In addition, it is also supported by various pesantren disciplines such as prohibiting students from leaving campus except in very emergency conditions and accompanied by special officers.","Mohammad, Muslih; Muthmainnah, Choliq; Ida, Susilowati; Moh, Rofiq",Tsaqafah,197,25

This disease has become a reason for disturbance and concern. India, as a densely populated country, took initiative after the pandemic was declared. The objective of this study was to determine the mortality and recovery rates at 30 days from the first unlock phase after five phases of lockdown. The the number of infected people has continually increased, and currently, this pandemic continues to present challenges to public health. Subject and methods: Statistical analysis was used to calculate the mortality rate, ratio between active and death cases, active cases and recovered cases, recovered and death cases in India during the first 30 days of the unlock phase. Results: The relationship between the new cases, deaths and recovered cases, shows that the new and recovered cases increased progressively. From the scatter plot of daily deaths and new cases, the R2 value is 0.0047. That means the death ratio is low against the new cases. Also, if we look at another scatter plot, the ratio between new cases and recovery rate shows the R2 value is 0.8015. That means the recovery rate was very high during the study period in India. The R2 value of daily recovery and death is 0.0072. India faced a huge number of new coronavirus cases and increased death rate every day during the first unlock phase. Conclusion: There was not the same condition as in the preliminary stage. The affected graphs progressively increased, and the government is fighting to control this deadly infection.

One of the important issues in the context of COVID-19 infection is the development of innovative forms of work with patients after pneumonia at the outpatient and home stages of medical rehabilitation. Objective: to develop a remote form of work organization and to study the effectiveness of hypobaric altitude chamber adaptation and cytoflavin at the outpatient and home stages of medical rehabilitation in patients after pneumonia COVID-19. Materials and methods. The study included 315 people after suffering from COVID-19 pneumonia. The first group consisted of 160 people who underwent a course of hypobaric altitude chamber adaptation, the average age of 53.5 (45,61) years. The sec-ond group (50 people) underwent a course of taking cytoflavin tablets;63.9 (60.5;67.6) years. The third group (105 patients) underwent a course of hypobaric chamber adaptation and cytoflavin administration;55.1 (45.7;60.9) years. We analyzed the scales that characterize the quality of life and psychological state of patients before and after the rehabilitation course, and 3 months after the end of the course. Results and discussion. The use of one-and two-component courses contributed to the improvement of the indicators of the traumatic event impact assessment scale, the Schulte Table scale, and the self-assessment of the EQ-5 quality of life scale. The results obtained were statistically significantly different after the course of rehabilitation from the initial values and retained their dif-ference after three months of observation. Conclusions. An innovative remote form of work at the outpatient and home stages of medical rehabilitation has been developed and implemented – the YouTube project “Let’s help each other recover from pneumonia” (PDDVSMU). The stable prolonged effectiveness of a one-and two-component course of hypobaric altitude chamber adaptation in patients after COVID-19 pneumonia at the outpatient and home stages of medical rehabilitation is shown. The addition of cytofla-vin enhanced the rehabilitation effect of hypobaric adaptation. The data obtained should be taken into account when developing comprehensive programs for medical rehabilitation of patients after COVID-19 pneumonia. © 2021, Remedium Group Ltd.

The review assesses whether and how this COVID-19-focused research (i) examines components of an integrated system; (ii) accounts for interactions including complex, adaptive dynamics; and (iii) is oriented to informing action. It finds that this research to date has not comprehensively accounted for complex, coupled interactions, especially involving societal factors, potentially leading to erroneous conclusions and hampering efforts to draw broader insights across sustainability-relevant domains. Lack of systems perspective in COVID-19 research reflects a broader challenge in environmental research, which often neglects societal feedbacks. Practical steps through which researchers can better incorporate systems perspectives include using analytical frameworks to identify important components and interactions, connecting frameworks to models and methods, and advancing sustainability science theory and methodology.","Selin, Noelle E",Sci.

METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a longitudinal pretest-posttest comparison group study to estimate the change in COVID-19 case growth before versus after implementation of statewide social distancing measures in the US. The primary exposure was time before (14 days prior to, and through 3 days after) versus after (beginning 4 days after, to up to 21 days after) implementation of the first statewide social distancing measures. Statewide restrictions on internal movement were examined as a secondary exposure. The primary outcome was the COVID-19 case growth rate. The secondary outcome was the COVID-19-attributed mortality growth rate. All states initiated social distancing measures between March 10 and March 25, 2020. The mean daily COVID-19 case growth rate decreased beginning 4 days after implementation of the first statewide social distancing measures, by 0.9% per day (95% CI -1.4% to -0.4%; P < 0.001). We did not observe a statistically significant difference in the mean daily case growth rate before versus after implementation of statewide restrictions on internal movement (0.1% per day; 95% CI -0.04% to 0.3%; P = 0.14), but there is substantial difficulty in disentangling the unique associations with statewide restrictions on internal movement from the unique associations with the first social distancing measures. Beginning 7 days after social distancing, the COVID-19-attributed mortality growth rate decreased by 2.0% per day (95% CI -3.0% to -0.9%; P < 0.001). Our analysis is susceptible to potential bias resulting from the aggregate nature of the ecological data, potential confounding by contemporaneous changes (e.g., increases in testing), and potential underestimation of social distancing due to spillover effects from neighboring states. CONCLUSIONS: Statewide social distancing measures were associated with a decrease in the COVID-19 case growth rate that was statistically significant. Statewide social distancing measures were also associated with a decrease in the COVID-19-attributed mortality growth rate beginning 7 days after implementation, although this decrease was no longer statistically significant by 10 days.","Siedner, Mark J; Harling, Guy; Reynolds, Zahra; Gilbert, Rebecca F; Haneuse, Sebastien; Venkataramani, Atheendar S; Tsai, Alexander C",PLoS Med,197,26

The objective of this study was to develop a rapid screening diagnostic test that could be completed in 30-45 minutes. Simulated patient samples were generated by spiking serum, urine, saliva, oropharyngeal swabs, and nasopharyngeal swabs with a portion of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleic sequence. RNA isolated from nasopharyngeal swabs collected from actual COVID-19 patients was also tested. The samples were tested using RT-LAMP as well as by conventional qRT-PCR. Specificity of the RT-LAMP was evaluated by also testing against other related coronaviruses. RT-LAMP specifically detected SARS-CoV-2 in both simulated patient samples and clinical specimens. This test was performed in 30-45 minutes.

Highly sensitive and specific laboratory diagnostics are important for controlling the rapidly evolving SARS-CoV-2-associated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic. In this study, we developed and compared the performance of three novel real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) assays targeting the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp)/helicase (Hel), spike (S), and nucleocapsid (N) genes of SARS-CoV-2 with that of the reported RdRp-P2 assay, which is used in >30 European laboratories. Among the three novel assays, the COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay had the lowest limit of detection in vitro (1.8 50% tissue culture infective doses [TCID50]/ml with genomic RNA and 11.2 RNA copies/reaction with in vitro RNA transcripts). Among 273 specimens from 15 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in Hong Kong, 77 (28.2%) were positive by both the COVID-19-RdRp/Hel and RdRp-P2 assays.

METHODS: Patients who underwent emergency surgery between the pandemic period of March 14th to May 15th 2020 and within the same period from the previous year were reviewed retrospectively. COVID-19 incidence in patients and health professionals working in the general surgery department during these periods was questioned. RESULTS: Demographic data were similar between the two time periods. The number of patients who underwent surgery in the pandemic group (n = 103) was lower than the control group (n = 252). There was a 59.1% reduction in emergency surgeries. The biggest decreases were the admissions of incarcerated hernia, uncomplicated appendicitis and acute cholecystitis (92%, 81.3%, 47.3%, respectively). During the pandemic, an increase was of patient rates who underwent surgery for complicated appendicitis and AMIO (p = 0.001, p = 0.019, respectively).

The purpose of this review was to compile the clinical evidences on the use of the pre-existing medications and potential therapeutic options for the management of COVID-19. We reviewed the literature to highlight the clinical studies on the use of these medications to be available as a scientific overview for further perspectives. Inadequate clinical evidences are available to be affirmed for the repurposing of old medications, and large scale clinical studies are needed to be carried out to further confirm the use of these agents.

The S1 coronavirus subunit of S-proteins contains the receptor-binding domain (RBD) that is able to recognize different host receptors, highlighting its remarkable capacity to adapt to their hosts along the viral evolution. While RBD in spike proteins is determinant for the virus-receptor interaction, the active residues lie at the receptor-binding motif (RBM), which is part of RBD and plays a fundamental role binding the outer surface of their receptors. Here, we address the hypothesis that SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 strains able to use angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) proteins have adapted their RBM along the viral evolution to explore specific conformational topology driven by the amino acid residues YGF to infect host cells. We also speculate that this YGF-based mechanism can act as a protein signature located at the RBM to distinguish coronaviruses able to use ACE2 as a cell entry receptor.","Carvalho, Patricia P.

The present study aimed to investigate the characteristics of depression in Chinese older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic, to examine the association of individual precautionary behavior with older adults' depression levels, and to identify the moderating role of socioeconomic indicators in the aforementioned association. Five hundred and sixteen older adults were recruited from five cities of Hubei province in China. They were asked to complete an online questionnaire survey. Results showed that 30.8% of participants indicated a significant depressive symptom during the pandemic. Older adults' depression levels differed significantly in marital status, living situation, education level, household income, subjective health status, and infected cases of acquaintances. Precautionary behavior change showed significant inverse associations with older adults' depression levels, where household income moderated this relationship. This is the first study to investigate the characteristics, behavioral correlates, and moderators of depression among Chinese older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. Research findings may provide new insights into interventions and policy-making on individual precautionary behavior and mental health among older adults for future pandemics.","Liang, Wei; Duan, Yanping; Shang, Borui; Hu, Chun; Baker, Julien Steven; Lin, Zhihua; He, Jiali; Wang, Yanping",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),197,1

Some people seem to be at higher risk of worse prognosis and increased mortality. Identifying these vulnerable groups is a necessity. Aim of study: To identify the risk factors associated with ICU admission in COVID-19 patients. Methodology: We present a retrospective study where the clinical data of patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection were collected from Ain-Shams University Isolation-Hospital records on admission from 10 April 2020 to 30 July 2020 to identify risk factors in patients requiring ICU admission during hospital stay. Results: Of 323 subjects diagnosed by the RT-PCR as positive COVID-19, 62 (19.2%) of which were admitted at the ICU. The mean age of the subjects was 46.6 ± 16 years. Significant morbidities were associated with higher age groups (p value 0.000), smokers (p value 0.004), Cairo-residents (p value 0.009), being a health-care provider (p value 0.001) and hypertensive patients (p value 0.000). Conclusions: Elderly, smokers, diabetic and hypertensive need further attention during disease course. Our results call for further investigations of risk factors for COVID-19 severity;preferably on large prospective cohorts, to increase their validity.","Fouad, S. H.; Allam, M.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: There were 14 patients with pneumomediastinum and COVID-19 infection without mechanical ventilation. We discussed the world data on pneumomediastinum in patients with coronavirus infection. RESULTS: Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the annual number of own observations of spontaneous pneumomediastinum did not exceed 1-2 patients. The mechanism of pneumomediastinum is explained by the Macklin effect. COVID-19 pandemic in the Russian Federation was followed by increase of the number of patients with pneumomediastinum up to 2.4% of the total number of patients in the thoracic department. In this sample, pneumomediastinum occurred at all variants of the course of coronavirus infection. The timing of pneumomediastinum ranged from 2 to 18 (median 14) days after clinical manifestation of COVID-19. In 2 out of 14 cases, pneumomediastinum was the main symptom of coronavirus infection at admission. One patient had a combination of pneumomediastinum and pneumothorax. In 6 cases, pneumomediastinum was stable and regressed under conservative therapy. Eight patients underwent Razumovsky suprajugular mediastinotomy. There were no postoperative deaths. Recurrent pneumomediastinum was noted in one patient.

DESIGN: retrospective cohort study with an individual level record linkage procedure of different administrative databases. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: the cohort included 3,010 patients residing in FVG who tested positive for COVID-19 between 1 March and 15 May 2020, 2020. Regional hospital admissions and deaths without hospital admissions up to June 1st, 2020 were analysed. Determinants of the probability of a highly severe illness were investigated in terms of hospitalisations or death without hospital admission. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: COVID-19 patients were identified from regional epidemiological data warehouse. Demographical and clinical variables such as gender, age, patient's comorbidities, vaccinations, ARBs/sartans prescriptions, and geographical residence variables were collected by linking different databases. Descriptive analyses were performed. Logistic multivariate regressions were used to estimate the probability of hospitalisation or death, whichever came first. Model coefficients and odds ratios (OR) were reported. RESULTS: COVID-19 population in FVG had a mean age of 60 years and 59% were females. The study found that 37% had hypertension while patients with cardiologic diseases, diabetes, and cancer were around 15%; 22% of the cases were residing in retirement homes. Approximately 30% received flu or pneumococcal vaccination and a similar proportion of patients had at least one prescription of ARBs /sartans in the previous 6 months. Statistical models showed a higher probability of a worst course of disease for males, elderly, highly complicated (in terms of resource use) subjects, in the presence of cardiologic diseases, diabetes, and pneumococcal vaccination. People living in retirement homes had a lower probability of hospitalisation/death without hospital admission. The cohort was divided into two groups: COVID-19 patients infected in the territory and infected in retirement homes. Among COVID-19 patients infected in the territory, the probability of hospitalisation/death was higher for males, for older individuals, and for those with comorbidities. Diabetes resulted to be a risk factor (OR 1.79; 95%CI 1.23-2.62), as well as pneumococcal vaccination (OR 1.64; 95%CI: 1.18-2.29), which is a likely proxy of fragile patients with pulmonary disease. The flu vaccination showed a potential protective effect with a 40% lower probability of hospitalisation or death (OR 0.62; 95%CI 0.44-0.85). Among the retirement homes cohort group, a higher probability of a bad course of disease emerged for males and for more complex patients. CONCLUSIONS: the greatest risk of hospitalisation/death as a measure of more severe illness was confirmed for males, elderly, and for individuals with comorbidities. Flu vaccination seemed to have had a protective effect while pneumococcal vaccination likely identified a group of high-risk patients to be actively monitored. For patients infected in the territory, different hospitalisation strategies were implemented by the regional health districts.","Gobbato, Michele; Clagnan, Elena; Burba, Ivana; Rizzi, Laura; Grassetti, Luca; Del Zotto, Stefania; Dal Maso, Luigini; Serraino, Diego; Tonutti, Giuseppe",Epidemiol Prev,197,15

METHODS: A group of hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia were randomized using 1:1 allocation to either standard treatment lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon beta-1a or bromhexine 8 mg four times a day in addition to standard therapy. The primary outcome was clinical improvement within 28 days, and the secondary outcome measures were time to hospital discharge, all-cause mortality, duration of mechanical ventilation, the temporal trend in 2019-nCoV reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction positivity and the frequency of adverse drug events within 28 days from the start of medication. RESULTS: A total of 111 patients were enrolled in this randomized clinical trial and data from 100 patients (48 patients in the treatment arm and 52 patients in the control arm) were analyzed. There was no significant difference in the primary outcome of this study, which was clinical improvement. There was no significant difference in the average time to hospital discharge between the two arms. There were also no differences observed in the mean intensive care unit stay, frequency of intermittent mandatory ventilation, duration of supplemental oxygenation or risk of death by day 28 noted between the two arms. CONCLUSION: Bromhexine is not an effective treatment for hospitalized patients with COVID-19. The potential prevention benefits of bromhexine in asymptomatic postexposure or with mild infection managed in the community remain to be determined.","Tolouian, Ramin; Mulla, Zuber D; Jamaati, Hamidreza; Babamahmoodi, Abdolreza; Marjani, Majid; Eskandari, Raha; Dastan, Farzaneh",J. invest. med,197,1

Yet, due to the fundamentally weak non-linearities of traditional wave materials, such analog processors have been so far largely confined to simple linear projections such as image edge detection or matrix multiplications. Complex neuromorphic computing tasks, which inherently require strong non-linearities, have so far remained out-of-reach of wave-based solutions, with a few attempts that implemented non-linearities on the digital front, or used weak and inflexible non-linear sensors, restraining the learning performance. Here, we tackle this issue by demonstrating the relevance of Time-Floquet physics to induce a strong non-linear entanglement between signal inputs at different frequencies, enabling a power-efficient and versatile wave platform for analog extreme deep learning involving a single, uniformly modulated dielectric layer and a scattering medium.

However, many real-world tasks require multiple arms, such as lifting a heavy object or assembling a desk. Unfortunately, applying IL to multi-arm manipulation tasks has been challenging -- asking a human to control more than one robotic arm can impose significant cognitive burden and is often only possible for a maximum of two robot arms. To address these challenges, we present Multi-Arm RoboTurk (MART), a multi-user data collection platform that allows multiple remote users to simultaneously teleoperate a set of robotic arms and collect demonstrations for multi-arm tasks. Using MART, we collected demonstrations for five novel two and three-arm tasks from several geographically separated users. From our data we arrived at a critical insight: most multi-arm tasks do not require global coordination throughout its full duration, but only during specific moments. We show that learning from such data consequently presents challenges for centralized agents that directly attempt to model all robot actions simultaneously, and perform a comprehensive study of different policy architectures with varying levels of centralization on our tasks. Finally, we propose and evaluate a base-residual policy framework that allows trained policies to better adapt to the mixed coordination setting common in multi-arm manipulation, and show that a centralized policy augmented with a decentralized residual model outperforms all other models on our set of benchmark tasks.

Thus, we describe the frequency and distribution of CXR findings, and their association with clinical outcomes of patients with COVID-19. METHODS: All adult (&#8805; 18 years) patients presenting between 28th February-31st May to the emergency department of a tertiary care hospital in Pakistan, who were COVID-19 positive on RT-PCR with CXR done on presentation, were included. A CXR Severity Score (CXR-SS) of 0-8 was used to quantify the extent of pulmonary infection on CXR, with a score of 0 being negative and 1-8 being positive. The patients' initial CXR-SS and their highest CXR-SS over the hospital course were used for analysis, with cut-offs of 0-4 and 5-8 being used to assess association with clinical outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 150 patients, with 76.7% males and mean age 56.1 years, were included in this study. Initial CXR was positive in 80% of patients, and 30.7% of patients had an initial CXR-SS between 5-8. The mortality rate was 16.7% and 30.6% patients underwent ICU admission with intubation (ICU-Int). On multivariable analysis, initial CXR-SS (1.355 [1.136-1.616]) and highest CXR-SS (1.390 [1.143-1.690]) were predictors of ICU-Int, and ICU-Int was independently associated with both initial CXR-SS 5-8 (2.532 [1.109-5.782]) and highest CXR-SS 5-8 (3.386 [1.405-8.159]). Lastly, age (1.060 [1.009-1.113]), initial CXR-SS (1.278 [1.010-1.617]) and ICU-Int (5.047 [1.731-14.710]), were found to be independent predictors of mortality in our patients. CONCLUSION: In a resource-constrained country like Pakistan, CXRs may have valuable prognostic utility in predicting ICU admission and mortality. Additional research with larger patient samples is needed to further explore the association of CXR findings with clinical outcomes.","Kaleemi, Raima; Hilal, Kiran; Arshad, Ainan; Martins, Russell Seth; Nankani, Avinash; Tu, Haq; Basharat, Sundas; Ansar, Zeeshan",PLoS One,197,5

Although development of novel vaccines can prevent the SARS CoV-2 infections, it is still impeded by several other factors and therefore novel approaches towards treatment and management of this disease is the urgent need. Passive immunotherapy plays a vital role as a possible alternative to meet this challenge and among various antibody sources, chicken egg yolk antibodies (IgY) can be used as an alternative to mammalian antibodies which have been previously studied against SARS CoV outbreak in China. In this review, we discuss the strategies for the use of chicken egg yolk (IgY) antibodies in the development of rapid diagnosis and immunotherapy against SARS CoV-2. Also, IgY antibodies have previously been used against various respiratory bacterial and viral infections in humans and animals. Compared to mammalian antibodies (IgG), chicken egg yolk antibodies (IgY) have greater binding affinity to specific antigens, ease of extraction and lower production costs, hence possessing remarkable pathogen-neutralizing activity of pathogens in respiratory and lungs. We provide an overall importance for the use of monoclonal chicken egg yolk antibodies (IgY) using phage display method describing their potential passive immunotherapeutic application for the treatment and prevention of SARS CoV-2 infection which is simple, fast and safe way of approach for treating patients effectively.","Somasundaram, Rajeswari; Choraria, Ankit; Antonysamy, Michael",Int Immunopharmacol,197,24

Most non-urgent medical activities, including elective surgeries, have been paused to mitigate the risk of infection and to dedicate medical resources to managing the pandemic. In this regard, not only surgeries are substantially influenced, but also pre- and post-operative assessment of patients and training for surgical procedures have been significantly impacted due to the pandemic. Many countries are planning a phased reopening, which includes the resumption of some surgical procedures. However, it is not clear how the reopening safe-practice guidelines will impact the quality of healthcare delivery. This perspective article evaluates the use of robotics and AI in 1) robotics-assisted surgery, 2) tele-examination of patients for pre- and post-surgery, and 3) tele-training for surgical procedures. Surgeons interact with a large number of staff and patients on a daily basis. Thus, the risk of infection transmission between them raises concerns. In addition, pre- and post-operative assessment also raises concerns about increasing the risk of disease transmission, in particular, since many patients may have other underlying conditions, which can increase their chances of mortality due to the virus. The pandemic has also limited the time and access that trainee surgeons have for training in the OR and/or in the presence of an expert. In this article, we describe existing challenges and possible solutions and suggest future research directions that may be relevant for robotics and AI in addressing the three tasks mentioned above.","Feizi, N.; Tavakoli, M.; Patel, R.

However, the definition of""computable knowledge object""remains controversial so far in different fields. For example, it is defined as 1) quantitative scientific concept in natural science and engineering, 2) knowledge point in the field of education research, and 3) semantic predications, i.e., Subject-Predicate-Object (SPO) triples in biomedical fields. The Semantic MEDLINE Database (SemMedDB), a high-quality public repository of SPO triples extracted from medical literature, provides a basic data infrastructure for measuring medical knowledge. In general, the study of extracting SPO triples as computable knowledge unit from unstructured scientific text has been overwhelmingly focusing on scientific knowledge per se. Since the SPO triples would be possibly extracted from hypothetical, speculative statements or even conflicting and contradictory assertions, the knowledge status (i.e., the uncertainty), which serves as an integral and critical part of scientific knowledge has been largely overlooked. This article aims to put forward a framework for Medical Knowmetrics using the SPO triples as the knowledge unit and the uncertainty as the knowledge context. The lung cancer publications dataset is used to validate the proposed framework. The uncertainty of medical knowledge and how its status evolves over time indirectly reflect the strength of competing knowledge claims, and the probability of certainty for a given SPO triple. We try to discuss the new insights using the uncertainty-centric approaches to detect research fronts, and identify knowledge claims with high certainty level, in order to improve the efficacy of knowledge-driven decision support.","Li, Xiaoying; Peng, Suyuan; Du, Jian",,197,15

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess whether COVID-19-related GT data, particularly those related to ageusia and anosmia, were primarily related to media coverage or to epidemic trends. METHODS: We retrieved GT query data for searches on coronavirus, cough, anosmia, and ageusia and plotted them over a period of 5 years. In addition, we analyzed the trends of those queries for 17 countries throughout the year 2020 with a particular focus on the rises and peaks of the searches. For anosmia and ageusia, we assessed whether the respective GT data correlated with COVID-19 cases and deaths both throughout 2020 and specifically before March 16, 2020 (ie, the date when the media started reporting that these symptoms can be associated with COVID-19). RESULTS: Over the last five years, peaks for coronavirus searches in GT were only observed during the winter of 2020. Rises and peaks in coronavirus searches appeared at similar times in the 17 different assessed countries irrespective of their epidemic situations. In 15 of these countries, rises in anosmia and ageusia searches occurred in the same week or 1 week after they were identified in the media as symptoms of COVID-19. When data prior to March 16, 2020 were analyzed, anosmia and ageusia GT data were found to have variable correlations with COVID-19 cases and deaths in the different countries. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that COVID-19-related GT data are more closely related to media coverage than to epidemic trends.","Sousa-Pinto, Bernardo; Anto, Aram; Czarlewski, Wienia; Anto, Josep M; Fonseca, João Almeida; Bousquet, Jean",J Med Internet Res,197,24

The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients with COVID-19 admitted to both intensive care units (ICUs) and medical wards (MWs). Consecutive patients admitted for COVID-19 to the MW and the ICU at Padua University Hospital, all receiving thromboprophylaxis, underwent systematic ultrasonography of the internal jugular, and the upper and lower limbs veins every 7 days (± 1 day) after the admission; and, if negative, once-weekly until discharge or death. In case of suspected pulmonary embolism, a multidetector computed tomographic angiography was performed. The primary outcome was the proportion of any deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) and symptomatic pulmonary embolism in both groups. An extended blood coagulative test was performed as well. From March 4 to April 30, 2020, a total of 85 patients were investigated, 44 (52%) in MWs and 41 (48%) in the ICU.

OBJECTIVE: We identify the 10 most important articles for clinical practice in consultation-liaison psychiatry from 2020 using the new Importance and Quality instrument for assessing scientific literature. METHODS: The subcommittee published annotated abstracts for 97 articles on the academy website in 2020. Reviewers then rated all articles on clinical importance to practice and quality of scholarship using the Importance and Quality instrument. We describe the 10 articles with the highest aggregate scores and analyze the reliability of Importance and Quality instrument. RESULTS: Twenty-four raters identified the top 10 scoring articles of 2020. These articles provide practical guidance on key areas of consultation-liaison psychiatry including management of COVID-19, lithium treatment for complex patients, medical risks among patients with severe mental illness, and substance use disorders in medical settings. The assessment instrument demonstrated good to excellent interrater reliability. CONCLUSION: These articles offer valuable guidance for consultation-liaison psychiatrists regardless of their practice area. Collaborative literature reviews with standardized assessments help clinicians deliver evidence-based care and foster a high standard of practice across the specialty.","Simpson, Scott A; Bienvenu, O Joseph; Andrews, Sarah R; Close, Jeylan S; Adler Cohen, Mary Ann; Fernandez-Robles, Carlos; Francis, Brandon A; Gandhi, Jai; Gangopadhyay, Maalobeeka; Gershengoren, Liliya; Grimaldi, John A; Isenberg-Grzeda, Elie; Key, R Garrett; Kiong, Timothy; Kontos, Nicholas; Loh, Ryan M; Luchsinger, Walter; Munjal, Sahil; Niazi, Shehzad K; Nichols, Nona A; Pathare, Aum; Pereira, Luis F; Shim, J Jewel; Tobin, Marie B; Zimbrean, Paula C",,197,22

In contrast to the regulation of calcium concentration, little is known about the spatio-temporal regulation of ROCK activity in live blood vessels. Here, we report ROCK activation in subcutaneous arterioles in a transgenic mouse line, which expresses a genetically-encoded ROCK biosensor based on the principle of FÓ§rster resonance energy transfer by two-photon excitation in vivo imaging. Upon laser ablation of arterioles, rapid vasospasm was induced, concomitant with a transient increase in calcium concentration in arteriolar smooth muscles. Unlike the increase in calcium concentration, vasoconstriction and ROCK activation continued for several minutes. Both the ROCK inhibitor, fasudil, and the ganglionic nicotinic acetylcholine receptor blocker, hexamethonium, inhibited laser-induced ROCK activation and reduced the duration of vasospasm at the segments distant from the irradiated point. These observations suggest that vasoconstriction is initially triggered by a rapid surge of cytoplasmic calcium concentration and then maintained by sympathetic nerve-mediated ROCK activation.","Imanishi, Ayako; Ichise, Hiroshi; Fan, Chuyun; Nakagawa, Yasuaki; Kuwahara, Koichiro; Sumiyama, Kenta; Matsuda, Michiyuki; Terai, Kenta",Am. j. pathol,197,21

To take full advantage of the resolution of NGS data, we developed HAplotype PHylodynamics PIPEline (HAPHPIPE), an open-source tool for the de novo and reference-based assembly of viral NGS data, with both consensus sequence assembly and a focus on the quantification of intra-host variation through haplotype reconstruction. We validate and compare the consensus sequence assembly methods of HAPHPIPE to those of two alternative software packages, HyDRA and Geneious, using simulated HIV and empirical HIV, HCV, and SARS-CoV-2 datasets. Our validation methods included read mapping, genetic distance, and genetic diversity metrics. In simulated NGS data, HAPHPIPE generated pol consensus sequences significantly closer to the true consensus sequence than those produced by HyDRA and Geneious and performed comparably to Geneious for HIV gp120 sequences. Furthermore, using empirical data from multiple viruses, we demonstrate that HAPHPIPE can analyze larger sequence datasets due to its greater computational speed. Therefore, we contend that HAPHPIPE provides a more user-friendly platform for users with and without bioinformatics experience to implement current best practices for viral NGS assembly than other currently available options.","Gibson, Keylie M; Steiner, Margaret C; Rentia, Uzma; Bendall, Matthew L; Pérez-Losada, Marcos; Crandall, Keith A",Viruses,197,24

Results of such tests can be reported as cycle threshold (Ct) values, which may provide semi-quantitative or indirect measurements of viral load. Previous reports have examined temporal trends in Ct values over the course of a SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: Using testing data collected during a prospective household transmission investigation of outpatient and mild COVID-19 cases, we examined the relationship between Ct values of the viral RNA N1 target and demographic, clinical, and epidemiological characteristics collected through participant interviews and daily symptom diaries. RESULTS: We found Ct values are lowest (corresponding to higher viral RNA concentration) soon after symptom onset and are significantly correlated with time elapsed since onset (p<0.001); within 7 days after symptom onset, the median Ct value was 26.5 compared with a median Ct value of 35.0 occurring 21 days after onset. Ct values were significantly lower among participants under 18 years of age (p=0.01) and those reporting upper respiratory symptoms at the time of sample collection (p=0.001) and were higher among participants reporting no symptoms (p=0.05).

The objective of this study was to explore how older adults (&#8805; 60 years) who were recently (&#8804; 12 months) discharged from the care of their cancer team were coping during the pandemic. METHODS: We used a convergent mixed method design (QUAL+quan). Quantitative data were collected using the Brief-COPE questionnaire. Qualitative data were collected using telephone interviews to explore experiences and strategies for coping with cancer-related concerns. RESULTS: The mean sample age (n = 30) was 72.1 years (SD 5.8, range 63-83) of whom 57% identified as female. Participants' Brief-COPE responses indicated that they commonly used acceptance (n = 29, 96.7%), self-distraction (n = 28, 93.3%), and taking action (n = 28, 93.3%) coping strategies. Through our descriptive thematic analysis, we identified three themes: (1) drawing on lived experiences, (2) redeploying coping strategies, and (3) complications of cancer survivorship in a pandemic. Participants' coping strategies were rooted in experiences with cancer, other illnesses, life, and work. Using these strategies during the pandemic was not new-they were redeployed and repurposed-although using them during the pandemic was sometimes complicated. These data were converged to maximize interpretation of the findings. CONCLUSIONS: Study findings may inform the development or enhancement of cancer and non-cancer resources to support coping, particularly using remote delivery methods within and beyond the pandemic. Clinicians can engage a strengths-based approach to support older cancer survivors as they draw from their experiences, which contain a repository of potential coping skills.","Galica, Jacqueline; Liu, Ziwei; Kain, Danielle; Merchant, Shaila; Booth, Christopher; Koven, Rachel; Brundage, Michael; Haase, Kristen R",Support. care cancer,197,16

METHODS: Prospective, observational, single-center, cohort study. Sixty-four post-COVID-19 patients and fifty control were recruited. All participants underwent a complete ophthalmological examination including: Ocular Surface Disease Index Questionnaire (OSDI), Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA), slit lamp biomicroscopy, fundus examination, Schirmer test type 1, Tear Break Up Time test (tBUT), evaluation of conjunctival hyperemia, corneal staining and tear film osmolarity test. RESULTS: OSDI score was higher in the post-COVID19 group in the quantitative and qualitative analysis (respectively p<0.001 and p =0.012). Mean tBUT in post-COVID-19 patients was 6.95 ± 4.07 sec compared to a mean tBUT of 10.12 ± 3.90 sec in the control group. The post-COVID-19 group showed a higher number of patients with a simultaneous impairment of OSDI score and tBUT (p = 0.019). The Schirmer test results were strikingly significant both in the quantitative and qualitative analysis (p <0.001 and p = 0.0014 respectively). Both quantitative and qualitative analysis revealed a significant difference in terms of tear osmolarity in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Comparing the ocular surface assessment of post-COVID-19 patients with heathy control a statistically significant increase of DED has emerged both in subjective and objective evaluations.

METHODS: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection was confirmed in both patients by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from nasopharyngeal swabs antemortem. Coronial autopsies were performed on both patients and histological sampling of the brain was undertaken with a variety of histochemical and immunohistochemical stains. RNAscope® in situ hybridization (ISH) using the V-nCoV2019-S probe and RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid (RNA) was performed in paraffin-embedded brain tissue sampled from areas of pathology. RESULTS: Case 1 demonstrated severe multifocal cortical infarction with extensive perivascular calcification and numerous megakaryocytes, consistent with a severe multi-territorial cerebral vascular injury. There was associated cerebral thrombotic microangiopathy. Case 2 demonstrated a brainstem encephalitis centred on the dorsal medulla and a subacute regional infarct involving the cerebellar cortex. In both cases, ISH and RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 RNA were negative in tissue sampled from the area of pathology. CONCLUSIONS: Our case series adds calcifying cerebral cortical infarction with associated megakaryocytes and brainstem encephalitis to the spectrum of neuropathological findings that may contribute to the neurological decompensation seen in some COVID-19 patients. Viral RNA was not detected in post-mortem brain tissue, suggesting that these pathologies may not be a direct consequence of viral neuroinvasion and may represent para-infectious phenomena, relating to the systemic hyperinflammatory and hypercoagulable syndromes that both patients suffered.","Jensen, M P; Le Quesne, J; Officer-Jones, L; Teodòsio, A; Thaventhiran, J; Ficken, C; Goddard, M; Smith, C; Menon, D; Allinson, K S J",Neuropathol. appl. neurobiol,197,13

However, the most effective generative models are specialized to data from a single domain (e.g., images or text). Real-world applications such as healthcare require multi-modal data from multiple domains (e.g., both images and corresponding text), which are difficult to acquire due to limited availability and privacy concerns and are much harder to synthesize. To tackle this joint synthesis challenge, we propose an End-to-end MultImodal X-ray genERative model (EMIXER) for jointly synthesizing x-ray images and corresponding free-text reports, all conditional on diagnosis labels. EMIXER is an conditional generative adversarial model by 1) generating an image based on a label, 2) encoding the image to a hidden embedding, 3) producing the corresponding text via a hierarchical decoder from the image embedding, and 4) a joint discriminator for assessing both the image and the corresponding text. EMIXER also enables self-supervision to leverage vast amount of unlabeled data. Extensive experiments with real X-ray reports data illustrate how data augmentation using synthesized multimodal samples can improve the performance of a variety of supervised tasks including COVID-19 X-ray classification with very limited samples. The quality of generated images and reports are also confirmed by radiologists. We quantitatively show that EMIXER generated synthetic datasets can augment X-ray image classification, report generation models to achieve 5.94% and 6.9% improvement on models trained only on real data samples. Taken together, our results highlight the promise of state of generative models to advance clinical machine learning.","Biswal, Siddharth; Zhuang, Peiye; Pyrros, Ayis; Siddiqui, Nasir; Koyejo, Sanmi; Sun, Jimeng",,197,16

Thus, it's pertinent to evaluate various diversified clinical specimens' diagnostic utility in both diagnosis and follow-up of COVID-19. METHODS: A total of 924 initial specimens from 130 COVID-19 symptomatic cases before initiation of treatment and 665 follow up specimens from 15 randomly selected cases comprising of equal number of nasopharyngeal swab (NPS), oropharyngeal swab (OPS), combined NPS and OPS (Combined swab), sputum, plasma, serum and urine were evaluated by rRT-PCR. RESULTS: Demographic analysis showed males (86) twice more affected by COVID-19 than females (44) (p = 0.00001). Combined swabs showed a positivity rate of 100% followed by NPS (91.5%), OPS (72.3%), sputum (63%), while nCoV was found undetected in urine, plasma and serum specimens. The lowest cycle threshold (Ct) values of targeted genes E, ORF1b and RdRP are 10.56, 10.14 and 12.26 respectively and their lowest average Ct values were found in combined swab which indicates high viral load in combined swab among all other specimen types. Analysis of 665 follow-up multi-varied specimens also showed combined swab as the last specimen among all specimen types to become negative, after an average 6.6 (range 4-10) days post-treatment, having lowest (15.48) and average (29.96) Ct values of ORF1b respectively indicating posterior nasopharyngeal tract as primary nCoV afflicted site with high viral load. CONCLUSION: The combined swab may be recommended as a more appropriate specimen for both diagnosis and monitoring of COVID-19 treatment by rRT-PCR for assessing virus clearance to help physicians in taking evidence-based decision before discharging patients. Implementing combined swabs globally will definitely help in management and control of the pandemic, as it is the need of the hour.","Sharma, Kuldeep; Aggarwala, Pragya; Gandhi, Deepa; Mathias, Anuniti; Singh, Priyanka; Sharma, Somya; Negi, Sanjay Singh; Bhargava, Anudita; Das, Padma; Gaikwad, Ujjwala; Wankhede, Archana; Behra, Ajoy; Nagarkar, Nitin M",PLoS One,197,30

Specifically, we included a quarantine or isolation state occupied by people who believe they might be infected but are asymptomatic, and only leave if they test negative. We recovered maximum posteriori estimates of the model parameters using time series of new cases, daily deaths, and tests for the UK. These parameters were used to simulate the trajectory of the outbreak in the UK over an 18-month period. Several clear-cut conclusions emerged from these simulations. For example, under plausible (graded) relaxations of social distancing, a rebound of infections within weeks is unlikely. The emergence of a later second wave depends almost exclusively on the rate at which we lose immunity, inherited from the first wave. There exists no testing strategy that can attenuate mortality rates, other than by deferring or delaying a second wave. A sufficiently powerful tracking and tracing policy--implemented at the time of writing (10th May 2020)--will defer any second wave beyond a time horizon of 18 months. Crucially, this deferment is within current testing capabilities (requiring an efficacy of tracing and tracking of about 20% of asymptomatic infected cases, with less than 50,000 tests per day). These conclusions are based upon a dynamic causal model for which we provide some construct and face validation, using a comparative analysis of the United Kingdom and Germany, supplemented with recent serological studies.","Friston, Karl J.; Parr, Thomas; Zeidman, Peter; Razi, Adeel; Flandin, Guillaume; Daunizeau, Jean; Hulme, Oliver J.; Billig, Alexander J.; Litvak, Vladimir; Price, Cathy J.; Moran, Rosalyn J.; Lambert, Christian",,197,1

436448,436448,436448,Children with long covid,14.0457735,4.739464,2021,"Some Authors recently suggested that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) should be discontinued, even temporarily, given the current pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 virus. The suggestion is based on the hypothesis that ACE-inhibitors and ARBs may favor the entry and diffusion of SARS-CoV-2 virus into the human cells. ACE-inhibitors and ARBs may increase the expression of ACE2 receptors, which are the sites of viral entry into the human organism. ACE2 receptors are ubiquitous, although they are extremely abundant on the cell surface of type 2 pneumocytes. Type 2 pneumocytes are small cylindrical alveolar cells located in close vicinity to pulmonary capillaries and responsible for the synthesis of alveolar surfactant, which is known to facilitate gas exchanges. The increased expression of ACE2 for effect of ACE-inhibitors and ARBs can be detected by increased production of angiotensin1-7 and mRNA related to ACE2. There is the fear that the increased expression of ACE2 induced by ACE-inhibitors and ARBs may ultimately facilitate the entry and diffusion of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. However, there is no clinical evidence to support this hypothesis. Furthermore, available data are conflicting and some counter-intuitive findings suggest that ARBs may be beneficial, not harmful. Indeed, studies conducted in different laboratories demonstrated that ACE2 receptors show a down-regulation (i.e. the opposite of what would happen with ACE-inhibitors and ARBs) for effect of their interaction with the virus. In animal studies, down-regulation of ACE2 has been found as prevalent in the pulmonary areas infected by virus, but not in the surrounding areas. In these studies, virus-induced ACE2 down-regulation would lead to a reduced formation of angiotensin1-7 (because ACE2 degrades angiotensin II into angiotensin1-7) with consequent accumulation of angiotensin II. The excess angiotensin II would favor pulmonary edema and inflammation, a phenomenon directly associated with angiotensin II levels, along with worsening in pulmonary function. Such detrimental effects have been blocked by ARBs in experimental models. In the light of the above considerations, it is reasonable to conclude that the suggestion to discontinue ACE-inhibitors or ARBs in all patients with the aim of preventing or limiting the diffusion of SARS-CoV-2 virus is not based on clinical evidence. Conversely, experimental studies suggest that ARBs might be useful in these patients to limit pulmonary damage through the inhibition of type 1 angiotensin II receptors. Controlled clinical studies in this area are eagerly awaited. This review discusses facts and theories on the potential impact of ACE-inhibitors and ARBs in the setting of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","Verdecchia, Paolo; Reboldi, Gianpaolo; Cavallini, Claudio; Mazzotta, Giovanni; Angeli, Fabio",G Ital Cardiol (Rome),197,1

Materials and Methods: Chest HRCT images of 12 patents who were diagnosed as COVID-19 pneumonia in our insttute from January 28, 2020 to February 16, 2020 were retrospectvely reviewed. Results: The most typical HRCT findings were bilateral pulmonary parenchymal ground-glass opacites, with or without consolidaton in the lung periphery, and sometmes also showed a rounded morphology. Three (25%) patents had typical crazy paving signs, 3 (25%) patents showed air bronchogram, 2 (16.67%) patents with bronchial wall thickening signs, and 5 (41.67%) patents had vascular perforator signs. Only one (8.33%) patent had unilateral involvement in the left upper lobe. Lung cavitaton, pleural effusions and intrathoracic lymph node enlargement were not found in all patents. The severity of the lesions in the right lung, and in the lower lobe were worsen than those in the left lung and upper lobe, respectvely. Lesions in the lateroposterior zone of the lung were more common than those in the apical and central areas.

The review comprehensively analyzed the characteristics of the cancer patients under the pandemic and concluded that cancer patients were more susceptible to COVID-19, and also concluded that they were more likely to develop poor outcomes and the severe form of the disease. Three basic management strategies have been proposed to protect susceptible elderly cancer patients, find reliable indicators to monitor the course of disease, and implement effective prevention measures.","Wang, Lu; Sun, Yinan; Yuan, Ye; Mei, Qi; Yuan, Xianglin","Aging (Albany, N.Y.

RT is the online mode of instructional delivery. Globally it has become mandatory for all nurse educators to switch to RT mode. Many factors have been identified for effective implementation of RT, of which the major elements are choice of online teaching mode, pedagogy to choose the platform or technology, faculty preparedness, and the learner motivation and expectations. The dire need to meet the educational objectives demanded sudden transition to online mode. The paradigm shifts to RT brought many challenges and pragmatic guidance for teachers and institutions Remote teaching is flexible, student centered and feasible with opportunities to develop technically empowered faculty and coherent digital education strategies. However, tackling threats like academic integrity, inequity in accessibility and limited faculty preparedness necessitates attention. RT being flexible tool is weakened by low self-motivated students and low connectivity with digital inequity and security issues.

However, it remains unknown whether mental distress persists or subsides in response to consecutive Covid-19 waves. Therefore, we here examine mental distress before and across the three Covid-19 waves. MethodsWe measured stress and depressive symptoms prior to and across the three Covid-19 waves in a well-established population-based sample. A total of 330 participants completed e-questionnaires prior to and during the Covid-19 waves. Friedmans repeated-measures and Wilcoxon rank-sum pairwise test with Bonferroni correction were used to investigate repeated-measure differences, while the Kruskal-Wallis test was used to assess the effect of behavioral and physiological parameters on mental health. ResultsWe found significantly increased mental distress during each of the Covid-19 waves compared with the pre-Covid-19 period. Increased mental distress was more common in women and most pronounced during the 1st and in particular, the 3rd Covid-19 wave. The stress and depressive symptoms increased during the pandemic compared with the pre-Covid-19 period by a maximum of 1.58 and 3.63 times, respectively. Negative emotions and loneliness were identified as the most significant risk factors of Covid-19-induced mental distress, while resilience was found to be protective. ConclusionsMental distress surged during all the Covid-19 waves without showing extinction. This pattern is mechanistically reminiscent of the post-traumatic stress disorder. Our results suggest that the Covid-19 pandemic underlies the development of a novel chronic mental health disorder and do not exclude possible further deterioration of mental health in the case of future Covid-19 waves.","Novotny, Jan Sebastian; Rivas, Juan Pablo Gonzalez; Kunzova, Sarka; Skladana, Maria; Pospisilova, Anna; Polcrova, Anna; Vassilaki, Maria; Inojosa, Jose Ramon Medina; Lopez-Jimenez, Francisco; Geda, Yonas Endale; Stokin, Gorazd Bernard",,197,16

This pathogen primarily infects the respiratory system of the afflicted, usually resulting in pneumonia and in a severe case of acute respiratory distress syndrome. These disease developments result in the formation of different pathological structures in the lungs, similar to those observed in other viral pneumonias that can be detected by the use of chest X-rays. For this reason, the detection and analysis of the pulmonary regions, the main focus of affection of COVID-19, becomes a crucial part of both clinical and automatic diagnosis processes. Due to the overload of the health services, portable X-ray devices are widely used, representing an alternative to fixed devices to reduce the risk of cross-contamination. However, these devices entail different complications as the image quality that, together with the subjectivity of the clinician, make the diagnostic process more difficult. In this work, we developed a novel fully automatic methodology specially designed for the identification of these lung regions in X-ray images of low quality as those from portable devices. To do so, we took advantage of a large dataset from magnetic resonance imaging of a similar pathology and performed two stages of transfer learning to obtain a robust methodology with a low number of images from portable X-ray devices. This way, our methodology obtained a satisfactory accuracy of $0.9761 \pm 0.0100$ for patients with COVID-19, $0.9801 \pm 0.0104$ for normal patients and $0.9769 \pm 0.0111$ for patients with pulmonary diseases with similar characteristics as COVID-19 (such as pneumonia) but not genuine COVID-19.","Vidal, Pl'acido L; Moura, Joaquim de; Novo, Jorge; Ortega, Marcos",,197,8

Though there are works focusing on Sinophobia during the COVID-19 pandemic, less attention has been given to the recent surge in Islamophobia. A large number of positive cases arising out of the religious Tablighi Jamaat gathering has driven people towards forming anti-Muslim communities around hashtags like #coronajihad, #tablighijamaatvirus on Twitter. In addition to the online spaces, the rise in Islamophobia has also resulted in increased hate crimes in the real world. Hence, an investigation is required to create interventions. To the best of our knowledge, we present the first large-scale quantitative study linking Islamophobia with COVID-19. In this paper, we present CoronaBias dataset which focuses on anti-Muslim hate spanning four months, with over 410,990 tweets from 244,229 unique users. We use this dataset to perform longitudinal analysis. We find the relation between the trend on Twitter with the offline events that happened over time, measure the qualitative changes in the context associated with the Muslim community, and perform macro and micro topic analysis to find prevalent topics. We also explore the nature of the content, focusing on the toxicity of the URLs shared within the tweets present in the CoronaBias dataset. Apart from the content-based analysis, we focus on user analysis, revealing that the portrayal of religion as a symbol of patriotism played a crucial role in deciding how the Muslim community was perceived during the pandemic. Through these experiments, we reveal the existence of anti-Muslim rhetoric around COVID-19 in the Indian sub-continent.","Chandra, Mohit; Reddy, Manvith; Sehgal, Shradha; Gupta, Saurabh; Buduru, Arun Balaji; Kumaraguru, Ponnurangam",,197,21

An up-to-date understanding of this examination is critical for programs to develop an appropriate curriculum and for individuals to identify learning resources. This study presents an updated analysis of the basic science section of the OITE from 2014 to 2019. METHODS: All questions from the OITE from 2014 to 2019 were reviewed. Each question from the basic science section was categorized by topic and taxonomy. The use of radiographic images or other clinical media was recorded. The reference section was analyzed for bibliometric factors. Pearson chi-square tests were used as appropriate for statistical comparison. RESULTS: In total, 185 of 1,600 questions in the basic science section were used over the 6-year study period (11.6%). The proportion of basic science questions ranged from 10.7% to 12.0% from year to year. The most frequently tested topics were cellular and molecular biology (23.8%), physiology/pathophysiology (16.8%), and pharmacology (10.8%). There was an increase in the number of biostatistics questions from 2017 to 2019 compared with the number from 2014 to 2016 (P = 0.02). The most common taxonomic category was knowledge recall (89.7%). A total of 383 references were cited from 122 sources. The 3 most common sources accounting for 44.4% of all citations were produced by the AAOS. DISCUSSION: The basic science section of the OITE accounts for approximately 11% of all questions, with the most common taxonomy being knowledge recall (89.7%). Recent tests have emphasized biostatistics, highlighting the importance of incorporating biostatistics into residency education. Reference materials produced by the AAOS were highly cited in this section.","Shen, Tony S; Driscoll, Daniel A; Ellsworth, Bridget K; Premkumar, Ajay; Lebrun, Drake G; Bostrom, Mathias P G; Cross, Michael B",J.

Even low levels of acquired resistance at the cellular level lead to impaired response to cisplatin. In ovarian cancer intraperitoneal therapy, nanoparticle formulation can improve the cisplatin's pharmacokinetics and safety profile. Purpose: This work aimed to investigate the chemo-sensitivity of ovarian cancer SKOV3 cells upon short-term (72h) single treatment of cisplatin and cisplatin-loaded biodegradable nanoparticles (Cis-NP). The aim was then to determine the therapeutic properties of Cis-NP in vivo using a SKOV3-luc cells' xenograft model in mice. Methods: Cell cytotoxicity was assessed after the exposure of the cell culture to cisplatin or Cis-NP. The effect of treatments on EMT and CSC-like phenotype was studied by analyzing a panel of markers by flow cytometry. Intracellular platinum concentration was determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICS-MS), and gene expression was evaluated by RNAseq analysis. The efficacy of intraperitoneal chemotherapy was evaluated in a SKOV3-luc cells' xenograft model in mice, through a combination of bioluminescence imaging, histological, and immunohistochemical analyses. Results: We observed in vitro that short-term treatment of cisplatin has a critical role in determining the potential induction of chemoresistance, and a nanotechnology-based drug delivery system can modulate it. The RNAseq analysis underlines a protective effect of nanoparticle system according to their ability to down-regulate several genes involved in chemoresistance, cell proliferation, and apoptosis. The highest intracellular platinum concentration obtained with Cis-NP treatment significantly improved the efficacy. Consistent with in vitro results, we found that Cis-NP treatment in vivo can significantly reduce tumor burden and aggressiveness compared to the free drug. Conclusion: Nanoparticle-mediated cisplatin delivery may serve as an intracellular depot impacting the cisplatin pharmacodynamic performance at cellular levels. These features may contribute to improving the drawbacks of conventional intraperitoneal therapy, and therefore will require further investigations in vivo.","Bortot, Barbara; Mongiat, Maurizio; Valencic, Erica; Dal Monego, Simeone; Licastro, Danilo; Crosera, Matteo; Adami, Gianpiero; Rampazzo, Enrico; Ricci, Giuseppe; Romano, Federico; Severini, Giovanni Maria; Biffi, Stefania",Int J Nanomedicine,197,16

METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the data of 39,677 patients (group 1) that applied to 6 different large-volume tertiary centers in Istanbul for outpatient consultation, surgery or other procedures in the 3-month period between March 16 and June 14, 2020. The distribution of the number of patients who applied to subspecialty sections of urology outpatient clinics and inpatient services were recorded by weeks. That data was compared to data obtained from 145,247 patients that applied to the same centers in the same period of the previous year (group 2). The reflection of worldwide and Turkish COVID-19 case distribution on the daily urological practice was analyzed. RESULTS: There was a decrease in the number of patients in all subspecialty sections the in group 1 compared to group 2, however there was a significant proportional increase in urooncology and general urology admissions A decrease of approximately 75% was observed in the total number of surgeries (p<0.001). We detected a negative correlation between the numbers of admission to all outpatient clinics and COVID-19 cases or deaths in Turkey (p<0.05). The same negative correlation was present for all surgical procedures and consultations (p<0.05). The multivariate linear regression analysis revealed that the number of cases in Turkey, and number of deaths in worldwide estimate the number of outpatient clinic admissions (R2=0.38, p=0.028) and urological surgery (R2=0.33, p=0.020) in Turkey negatively. CONCLUSION: This novel pandemic has implications even for urology practice. Urological surgical procedures were more affected by COVID-19-related deaths in Turkey and worldwide. Outpatient admissions and urological surgeries decreased significantly by increasing COVID-19 case numbers in Turkey and worldwide deaths.","Çakici, Mehmet ÇaGlar; TemIz, Mustafa Zafer; IplIkÇI, Ayberk; ÖzgÖr, Faruk; Aksoy, Alper Kerem; Özer, Murat; Erdem, SelÇuk; Ulus, IsmaIl; KÜÇÜk, EyÜp VelI; ÖtÜnÇtemur, Alper; DeGIrmencI, Mehmet Enes; Aydin, ReSat; AtiS, Ramazan GÖkhan; MÜslÜmanoGlu, Ahmet Yaser; Sarilar, Ömer; Özcan, Faruk; Yildirim, Asif",,197,1

Coronaviruses constitute Nidovirales together with Arteriviridae. Most of human coronaviruses are known to cause mild illness and common cold. However, an epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) occurred in 2002, ten years after SARS epidemic Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) emerged in 2012. Now, we face on a novel coronavirus which emerges in end of 2019. This novel coronavirus is named as SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 is spread to worldwide within one to two months and causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), respiratory illness. Coronaviruses are enveloped viruses possessing a positive-sense and large single stranded RNA genomes. The 5' two-thirds of the CoV genome consists of two overlapping open reading frames (ORFs 1a and 1b) that encode non-structural proteins (nsps). The other one-third of the genome consists of ORFs encoding structural proteins, including spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins, and accessory proteins. Upon infection of CoV into host cells, the translation of two precursor polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, occurs and these polyproteins are cleaved into 16 nsps by viral proteases. Structural proteins assemble to the vesicles located from ER to Golgi (ER Golgiintermediate compartment) and virions bud into the vesicles. Virions are released from infectedcells via exocytosis.","Kamitani, Wataru",Uirusu,197,16

While the fungus penetrates the cuticle of fungus-susceptible tick, Rhipicephalus annulatus females, it is unable to penetrate the cuticle of fungus-resistant tick, and even perishes on its surface. This is probably due to high concentration of antifungal fatty acids and probably also due to a hypersensitive-like response of the tick. To understand the metabolic pathways occurring in the fungal hyphae upon encountering the cuticles, we compared the response of the fungus to cuticle from susceptible and resistant tick cuticles by 2D-gels. The intracellular proteomes of M. brunneum Mb7 exposed to cuticle of the fungus-susceptible tick, R. annulatus, and to the fungus-resistant tick, H. excavatum engorged females were compared after exposure to either cuticles. By means of liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry we identified in both proteomes common proteins involved in biological processes as well as unique proteins identified only in the proteome of fungus exposed to fungus-resistant tick cuticle. These proteins were identified in high probability as heat shock proteins, four key enzymes of the glyoxylate cycle, and proteins associated with hypoxia, and exposure to antifungal drugs. These findings are discussed within the M. brunneum-tick pathosystem in relation to tick resistance and host resistance in general.","Ment, Dana; Gindin, Galina; Samish, Michael; Glazer, Itamar",Arch Insect Biochem Physiol,197,22

The frequently accessed sites on Mpro were classified based on contacts between the ligands and the protein, and the differences in site distributions of the encounter complex were observed among the ligands. All seven ligands showed binding to the active site at least twice in 28 simulations of 200 ns each. We further investigated the variations in the complex structure of the active site with the ligands, using microsecond order simulations. Results revealed a wide variation in the shapes of the binding sites and binding poses of the ligands. Additionally, the C-terminal region of the other chain often interacted with the ligands and the active site. Collectively, these findings indicate the importance of dynamic sampling of protein-ligand complexes and suggest the possibilities of further drug optimisations.","Komatsu, Teruhisa S; Okimoto, Noriaki; Koyama, Yohei M; Hirano, Yoshinori; Morimoto, Gentaro; Ohno, Yousuke; Taiji, Makoto",Sci Rep,197,16

Recent publications suggest that SARS-CoV-2 detection in wastewater is technically feasible; however, many different protocols are available and most of the methods applied have not been properly validated. To this end, different procedures to concentrate and extract inactivated SARS-CoV-2 and surrogates were initially evaluated. Urban wastewater seeded with gamma-irradiated SARS-CoV-2, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), and mengovirus (MgV) was used to test the concentration efficiency of an aluminum-based adsorption-precipitation method and a polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation protocol. Moreover, two different RNA extraction methods were compared in this study: a commercial manual spin column centrifugation kit and an automated protocol based on magnetic silica beads. Overall, the evaluated concentration methods did not impact the recovery of gamma-irradiated SARS-CoV-2 nor MgV, while extraction methods showed significant differences for PEDV. Mean recovery rates of 42.9 ± 9.5%, 27.5 ± 14.3% and 9.0 ± 2.2% were obtained for gamma-irradiated SARS-CoV-2, PEDV and MgV, respectively. Limits of detection (LoD95%) for five genomic SARS-CoV-2 targets (N1, N2, gene E, IP2 and IP4) ranged from 1.56 log genome equivalents (ge)/mL (N1) to 2.22 log ge/mL (IP4) when automated system was used; while values ranging between 2.08 (N1) and 2.34 (E) log ge/mL were observed when using column-based extraction method. Different targets were also evaluated in naturally contaminated wastewater samples with 91.2%, 85.3%, 70.6%, 79.4% and 73.5% positivity, for N1, N2, E, IP2 and IP4, respectively. Our benchmarked comparison study suggests that the aluminum precipitation method coupled with the automated nucleic extraction represents a method of acceptable sensitivity to provide readily results of interest for SARS-CoV-2 WBE surveillance.","Pérez-Cataluña, Alba; Cuevas-Ferrando, Enric; Randazzo, Walter; Falcó, Irene; Allende, Ana; Sánchez, Gloria",Sci Total Environ,197,1

In situ simulation has been proven an effective tool for training medical professionals during previous healthcare crises, eg, Ebola, influenza, as well as for assessing the preparedness of centers by identifying potential latent safety threats. In this article, we describe our ongoing simulation activities to ensure that our staff is best prepared to adapt to the challenges of COVID-19. METHODS: This is a prospective preparedness assessment and training intervention at a tertiary care academic center in Lebanon during the COVID-19 pandemic. In situ simulations followed by debriefing with good judgment occur daily involving native teams of 3 to 5 professionals in the newly established COVID intensive care unit and wards, the adult and pediatric intensive care unit and wards, and the emergency department. The simulations are assessed by the instructor using the Simulation Team Assessment Tool and by the participants using the Simulation Effectiveness Tool. Transcripts of recorded simulation debriefings are analyzed for content for latent safety threats using the SHELL Framework (Software-Hardware-Equipment-Liveware). RESULTS: In 2 weeks, we conducted 15 simulations with 106 participants and 47 observers. Simulation Team Assessment Tool scores show an overall improvement across the hospital over time [101.5 ± 13 (80-134)]. Participants' feedback on the Simulation Effectiveness Tool has been predominantly positive on the educational and practical benefits of the simulation activity. Data from debriefings and observations demonstrated the following categories of latent safety threats: inadequate preparedness on infection control, uncertainty of guidelines on oxygen supplementation and intubation protocols, lack of leadership and communication, overall panic, and others. CONCLUSIONS: Our single-center preparedness intervention demonstrated multiple latent safety threats in relation to COVID-19, which can be recognized through simulation before translating into actual patient care.","Sharara-Chami, Rana; Sabouneh, Rami; Zeineddine, Rida; Banat, Rim; Fayad, Joe; Lakissian, Zavi",Simul Healthc,197,20

In India, AYUSH systems of medicine have been promoted as an immune-protection strategy. Andrographis paniculata (Burm. F) Nees (AP) mentioned in Ayurveda has been widely used for treating sore throat, flu, and upper respiratory tract infections which may provide possible novel therapeutic approaches, exclusively targeting SARS-CoV-2 and its pathways. OBJECTIVES: The present work uses liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) metabolomics and combination synergy analysis based on network pharmacology to mine multimode evidence to understand the possible mechanism of action, diseases association, protein-protein interaction and major pathways involved therein. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Metabolite profiling was performed by Agilent QTOF LC-MS/MS system. Network pharmacology analysis was performed by using functional annotation analysis based on databases like Binding DB, STRING, DAVID and KEGG for further data mining. Further combination synergy was evaluated using ""neighbourhood approach"" and networks were constructed through Cytoscape 3.2.1. RESULTS: The molecules from kalmegh provides immune-protection and anti-viral response via involving different pathways, like toll-like receptor pathway, PI3/AKT pathway and MAP kinase pathways against COVID-19 infection. The KEGG analysis showed that in a vast majority of the most enriched pathways, AP were associated with viral infections and upper respiratory tract infections. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest a synergy between andrographolide and other molecules identified as safe and efficacious anti-inflammatory agent having effects on upper respiratory tract infections and can significantly decrease the production of cytokines and pro-inflammatory factors in viral infections.","Banerjee, Subhadip; Kar, Amit; Mukherjee, Pulok K; Haldar, Pallab K; Sharma, Nanaocha; Katiyar, Chandra Kant",Phytochem anal,197,16

COVID-19 epidemic, which was discovered in Wuhan, Hubei Province, quickly spread to the whole country, and then appeared as a global public health event. During the epidemic period, Chinese netizens inquired about the dynamics of COVID-19 epidemic through Baidu search platform, and learned about relevant epidemic prevention information. These groups’ search behavior data not only reflect people’s attention to COVID-19 epidemic, but also contain the stage characteristics and evolution trend of COVID-19 epidemic. Therefore, the time, space and attribute laws of propagation of COVID-19 epidemic can be discovered by deeply mining more information in the time series data of search behavior. In this study, it is found that transforming time series data into visibility network through the principle of visibility algorithm can dig more hidden information in time series data, which may help us fully understand the attention to COVID-19 epidemic in Chinese provinces and cities, and evaluate the deficiencies of early warning and prevention of major epidemics. What’s more, it will improve the ability to cope with public health crisis and social decision-making level.

CASES: The first case is a woman at 22 3/7 weeks of gestation with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who was admitted to the intensive care unit. In the second case, the patient remained at home with mild symptoms, starting at 20 weeks of gestation. In both cases, fetal skin edema was observed on ultrasound examination while maternal SARS-COV-2 RT-PCR test results were positive and resolved when maternal SARS-COV-2 RT-PCR test results became negative. The RT-PCR test result for SARS-CoV-2 in amniotic fluid was negative in both cases. The two pregnancies are ongoing and uneventful.

Many of the most radical measures were adopted in Henan province, immediately north of Hubei, the pandemic's epicentre in China. However, little is known about how rural residents-a group systematically disadvantaged in Chinese society-responded to authorities' draconian restrictions. METHODS: To understand the lockdown measures and rural community responses at the grassroots level, face-to-face interviewers were conducted with both village cadres and villagers from two Henan villages in May and June 2020. The interviews were analysed with qualitative content analysis methods, with the coding process guided by the concepts of resilience, vulnerability and adaptability from the literature on disaster risk reduction. RESULTS: We found that the lockdown measures were indeed radical and disproportionate relative to the level of risk presented; however, they were largely accepted by villagers. This contradiction can be explained by two key contributing factors: (i) shared interests of individual villagers and the converged goal of government and civil society, and (ii) tacit flexibility in COVID-19 adaption strategies to tackle conflict resulting from goal diversion between citizens and local governments. CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight the nuances of ground-level politics. Despite their 'radical' nature, the lockdown measures were not implemented as simple top-down coercion. Instead, they involved, importantly, the bottom-up, localised response of villagers, and they were negotiated and adapted according to local circumstances.","Tan, Xiao; Song, Yao; Liu, Tianyang",PLoS One,197,10

We describe here a longitudinal study on the mental health of adults in France. METHODS: We did a secondary analysis of a web-based cohort, initially set up to study home and leisure injuries, in order to measure the consequences of the national lockdown implemented in France from 17 March 2020 to 11 May 2020, and to assess potential vulnerability and resilience factors. Eligible participants were invited to answer an online questionnaire designed to assess their living conditions and health during lockdown. Comparisons were done with answers provided 4.8 years earlier on average. RESULTS: On 15th April 2020, we sent email invitations to 9598 participants recruited between November 2014 and December 2019 and 1237 volunteers took part in the study by completing the online questionnaire. The proportion of those with anxiety symptoms markedly increased from 17.3 to 20.1%. The average self-rated level of mental health decreased from 7.77 to 7.58. Women, the elderly and the youngest appeared to be more vulnerable. A small living space (less than 30 m2) was associated with an increase in depression symptoms (PHQ-9 score), and poorer self-rated physical health at recruitment was associated with an increase in anxiety symptoms (GAD-7 score). On the contrary, the average self-rated level of physical health markedly increased from 7.44 to 7.94 between recruitment and lockdown, and the proportion of those who reported a level of 9 or 10 jumped from 25.7% at recruitment to 43.1% during lockdown. CONCLUSIONS: Mental health deteriorated during lockdown in France during the 2020 COVID-19 crisis. Overall, self-rated physical health improved but those who experienced a worse physical health were more likely to report anxiety symptoms.","Ramiz, Leila; Contrand, Benjamin; Rojas Castro, Madelyn Yiseth; Dupuy, Marion; Lu, Li; Sztal-Kutas, Catherine; Lagarde, Emmanuel",Global Health,197,12

The N protein is composed of N-terminal RNA-binding and C-terminal dimerization domains that are flanked by three intrinsically disordered regions. Here we demonstrate that the N protein's central disordered domain drives phase separation with RNA, and that phosphorylation of an adjacent serine/arginine rich region modulates the physical properties of the resulting condensates. In cells, N forms condensates that recruit the stress granule protein G3BP1, highlighting a potential role for N in G3BP1 sequestration and stress granule inhibition. The SARS-CoV-2 membrane (M) protein independently induces N protein phase separation, and three-component mixtures of N + M + RNA form condensates with mutually exclusive compartments containing N + M or N + RNA, including annular structures in which the M protein coats the outside of an N + RNA condensate. These findings support a model in which phase separation of the SARS-CoV-2 N protein contributes both to suppression of the G3BP1-dependent host immune response and to packaging genomic RNA during virion assembly.","Lu, Shan; Ye, Qiaozhen; Singh, Digvijay; Cao, Yong; Diedrich, Jolene K; Yates, John R; Villa, Elizabeth; Cleveland, Don W; Corbett, Kevin D",Nat Commun,197,16

METHODS: We assessed the effect of deploying SARS-Cov-2 vaccines on cold storage capacity and immunization workload in a simulated WHO African Region country using region-specific data on immunization, population, healthcare workers (HCWs), cold storage capacity (quartile values for national and subnational levels), and characteristics of an approved SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. We calculated monthly increases in vaccine doses, doses per vaccinator, and cold storage volumes for four-month SARS-CoV-2 vaccination campaigns targeting risk groups compared to routine immunization baselines. RESULTS: Administering SARS-CoV-2 vaccines to risk groups would increase total monthly doses by 27.0% for &#8805; 65 years, 91.7% for chronic diseases patients, and 1.1% for HCWs. Assuming median nurse density estimates adjusted for absenteeism and proportion providing immunization services, SARS-CoV-2 vaccination campaigns would increase total monthly doses per vaccinator by 29.3% for &#8805; 65 years, 99.6% for chronic diseases patients, and 1.2% for HCWs. When we applied quartiles of actual African Region country vaccine storage capacity, routine immunization vaccine volumes exceeded national-level storage capacity for at least 75% of countries, but subnational levels had sufficient storage capacity for SARS-CoV-2 vaccines for at least 75% of countries. CONCLUSIONS: In the WHO African Region, SARS-CoV-2 vaccination campaigns would substantially increase doses per vaccinator and cold storage capacity requirements over routine immunization baselines. Pandemic vaccination campaigns would increase storage requirements of national-level stores already at their limits, but sufficient capacity exists at subnational levels. Immediate attention to strengthening immunization systems is essential to support pandemic responses.","Ortiz, Justin R; Robertson, Joanie; Hsu, Jui-Shan; Yu, Stephen L; Driscoll, Amanda J; Williams, Sarah R; Chen, Wilbur H; Fitzpatrick, Meagan C; Sow, Samba; Biellik, Robin J; Neuzil, Kathleen M",Vaccine,197,30

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between February 2015 and April 2019, 236 patients with 236 BTNs (maximum diameter &#8805;2 cm) treated with ultrasound-guided MWA were enrolled. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) was performed within 3 d after ablation to determine whether there was residual tissue according to which the patients were assigned PA or complete ablation (CA). The volume reduction ratio (VRR) and complications were evaluated during follow-up. RESULTS: Eighty-two patients were enrolled in the PA group, and 154 were enrolled in the CA group. Both groups achieved continuous reductions in nodule volume and increases in VRR within 2 years after ablation. Although the VRR of the PA group at 4 years was lower than that of the CA group (65.54 vs. 95.08%; p<.05), PA still achieved 'technical efficacy' with a volume reduction of more than 50%. The complication and side effect rates between the two groups showed no significant difference (p>.05). CONCLUSIONS: Both PA and CA were safe and effective in reducing the volumes of BTNs in the long-term follow-up. For nodules with a large initial volume and dangerous location, PA with a small amount of residual tissue may be acceptable.","Cai, Wenjia; Liu, Sisi; Yu, Xiaoling; Han, Zhiyu; Cheng, Zhigang; Liu, Fangyi; Yu, Jie; Liang, Ping",Int J Hyperthermia,197,13

All these, and many more, are crucial questions to improve our clinical strategies against the epidemic and save as many lives as possible One might assume that in the era of big data and machine learning, there would be an army of scientists crunching petabytes of clinical data to answer these questions However, nothing could be further from the truth Our health systems have proven to be completely unprepared to generate, in a timely manner, a flow of clinical data that could feed these analyses Despite gigabytes of data being generated every day, the vast quantity is locked in secure hospital data servers and is not being made available for analysis Routinely collected clinical data are, by and large, regarded as a tool to inform decisions about individual patients, and not as a key resource to answer clinical questions through statistical analysis The initiatives to extract COVID-19 clinical data are often promoted by private groups of individuals and not by health systems, and are uncoordinated and inefficient The consequence is that we have more clinical data on COVID-19 than on any other epidemic in history, but we have failed to analyze this information quickly enough to make a difference In this viewpoint, we expose this situation and suggest concrete ideas that health systems could implement to dynamically analyze their routine clinical data, becoming learning health systems and reversing the current situation","Prieto-Merino, D.; Bebiano Da Providencia, E.

Although all patients with HLH typically need intensive anti-inflammatory therapy, patients with FHL also need HSCT to be cured. In the international HLH-2004 study, 187 children aged <18 years fulfilling the study inclusion criteria (5 of 8 diagnostic criteria, affected sibling, or molecular diagnosis in FHL-causative genes) underwent 209 transplants (2004-2012), defined as indicated in patients with familial/genetic, relapsing, or severe/persistent disease. Five-year overall survival (OS) post-HSCT was 66% (95% confidence interval [CI], 59-72); event-free survival (EFS) was 60% (95% CI, 52-67). Five-year OS was 81% (95% CI, 65-90) for children with a complete response and 59% (95% CI, 48-69) for those with a partial response (hazard ratio [HR], 2.12; 95% CI, 1.06-4.27; P = .035). For children with verified FHL (family history/genetically verified, n = 134), 5-year OS was 71% (95% CI, 62-78) and EFS was 62% (95% CI, 54-70); 5-year OS for children without verified FHL (n = 53) was significantly lower (52%; 95% CI, 38-65) (P = .040; HR, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.03-2.77); they were also significantly older. Notably, 20 (38%) of 53 patients without verified FHL had natural killer cell activity reported as normal at diagnosis, after 2 months, or at HSCT, suggestive of secondary HLH; and in addition 14 (26%) of these 53 children had no evidence of biallelic mutations despite having 3 or 4 FHL genes analyzed (natural killer cell activity not analyzed after 2 months or at HSCT). We conclude that post-HSCT survival in FHL remains suboptimal, and that the FHL diagnosis should be carefully investigated before HSCT. Pretransplant complete remission is beneficial but not mandatory to achieve post-HSCT survival.

Triage, an effective solution proposed in disaster medicine, also works well to manage Emergency Department (ED) flow. The aim of this study was to describe the role of an ED Triage Center for patients with suspected novel coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and characterize the patient flow. METHODS: In March 2020, we established a Covid-19 triage center close to the Liège University EDs. From March 2 to March 23, we planned to analyze the specific flow of patients admitted to this triage zone and their characteristics in terms of inner specificities, work-up and management. During this period, all patients presented to the ED with symptoms suggestive of Covid-19 were included in the study. RESULTS: A total amount of 1071 patients presented to the triage center during the study period. 41.50% of the patients presented with flu-like symptoms. In 82.00% of the cases, no risk factor of virus transmission was found. The SARS-Cov2 positive patients represented 29.26% of the screened patients. 83.00% of patients were discharged home while 17.00% were admitted to the hospital. CONCLUSION: Our experience suggests that triage centers for the assessment and management of Covid-19 suspected patients is an essential key strategy to prevent the spread of the disease among non-symptomatic patients who present to the EDs for care. This allows for a disease-centered work-up and safer diversion of Covid-19 patients to specific hospital units.","Gilbert, Allison; Brasseur, Edmond; Petit, Mérédith; Donneau, Anne Françoise; Diep, AnhNguyet; Hetzel Campbell, Suzanne; Servotte, Jean-Christophe; Piazza, Justine; Ancion, Aurore; Gensburger, Mathieu; D039,; Orio, Vincent; Ghuysen, Alexandre",Acta Clin Belg,197,16

The Coronavirus (Covid-19) outbreak allows to study the reactions of patients to the news about the spreading of the infection, which may have generated the fear that ED was no longer safe. METHODS: We study access to ED of a large teaching hospital in Brescia - one of the most hit provinces in Italy by Covid-19 - during the pandemic (from the announcement of the first cases to the explosion of the pandemic, to months after end of the acute phase) to study how patients reacted to the news that ED could no longer be a safe place. We analyse triage code, mode of arrival to ED, and accesses related to chest and abdominal pain, to evaluate who was discouraged most. RESULTS: Accesses have drastically reduced immediately after the news of the first contagion. During the lockdown accesses and admissions to hospital ward have decreased; this may mean that some patients may have suffered reduced health or increased mortality risks because of this decision. At the end of June accesses to ED and admissions to hospital ward are still lower than usual. DISCUSSION: Fear of contagion and appeals not to use ED directly by Covid-19 patients may have discouraged access also for pressing health need.","Garrafa, Emirena; Levaggi, Rosella; Miniaci, Raffaele; Paolillo, Ciro",Health Policy,197,15

To assess the performance of an extended questionnaire in identifying cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection among obstetric patients. 2. To evaluate the rate of infection among healthcare workers involved in women's care. STUDY DESIGN: A prospective cohort study of obstetric patients admitted to MBBM Foundation and Buzzi Hospital (Lombardy, Northern Italy) from March 16th to May 22nd, 2020. Women were screened on admission by a questionnaire investigating major and minor symptoms of infection and high-risk contacts in the last 14 days. SARS-CoV-2 assessment was performed by RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs. Till April 7th, a targeted SARS-CoV-2 testing triggered by a positive questionnaire was used; from April 8th, a universal testing approach was implemented. RESULTS: There were 1,177 women screened by the questionnaire, which yielded a positive result in 130 (11.0%) cases. SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR was performed in 865 (73.5%) patients, identifying 51 (5.9%) infections. During the first period, there were 29 infected mothers, 4 (13.8%) of whom had a negative questionnaire. After universal testing implementation, there were 22 (3%, 95% CI 1.94% - 4.04%) infected mothers, 13 (59.1%) of whom had a negative questionnaire; rate of infection among asymptomatic women was 1.9%. Six of the 17 SARS-CoV-2-positive women with a negative questionnaire reported symptoms more than 14 but within 30 days before admission. Isolated olfactory or taste disorders were identified in 15.7% of infected patients. Rate of infection among healthcare workers was 5.8%. CONCLUSIONS: An exhaustive triage questionnaire can effectively discriminate women at low risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the context of a targeted and a universal viral testing approach. In 15.7% of infected women, correct classification as a suspected case of infection was due to investigation of olfactory and taste disorders. Extension of the assessed time-frame to 30 days may be worth considering to increase the questionnaire's performance.","Ornaghi, Sara; Callegari, Clelia; Milazzo, Roberta; La Milia, Laura; Brunetti, Federica; Lubrano, Chiara; Tasca, Chiara; Livio, Stefania; Savasi, Valeria Maria; Cetin, Irene; Vergani, Patrizia",PLoS One,197,1

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the impact of COVID-19 on medications prescribed by dentists under the Australian Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS). METHODS: Data on the number of dental prescriptions dispensed for all medications listed on the PBS Dental Schedule, from January 2019 to June 2020, were extracted from publicly available data sets. Analysis of prescription trends was performed for 1) total medications, 2) each major medication class, and 3) individual medications. The number of prescriptions dispensed in each month from January 2020 to June 2020 was compared to the same month in 2019 to determine the relative (percentage) change, and z statistics were used to determine whether changes were statistically significant. RESULTS: There was a significant decrease in dental prescriptions in April 2020 compared to April 2019 (14,785, 18%; P < 0.05). Decreases in prescriptions for antibiotics (10,512, 16%; P < 0.05) and opioid analgesics (3,129, 18%; P < 0.05) were smaller compared to other major medication classes. There was a significant increase in June 2020, compared with June 2019, for prescriptions of amoxicillin with clavulanic acid (4,903, 20%; P < 0.05), tramadol (89, 46%; P < 0.05), and oxycodone (381, 73%; P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Dental service restrictions during COVID-19 likely drove an unmet need for routine dental treatment, which had significant implications for public oral health following easing of restrictions. During the initial surge and subsequent lockdown, antibiotics and opioid analgesics may have been used an as alternative to routine operative treatment. Continued professional guidance is required to ensure dental prescribing remains evidence based during the pandemic period. KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER STATEMENT: The COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent restrictions on dental practice have had a profound impact on the provision of dental care in Australia and elsewhere in the world. In this context, population-level medication surveillance is important to identify and respond to changes in prescribing patterns that have arisen due to COVID-19 and restrictions on the provision of dental care. This research is particularly important for governments, regulators, and professional associations to ensure therapeutic guidelines and recommendations during the pandemic period remain relevant and evidence based.","Mian, M; Teoh, L; Hopcraft, M",JDR Clin Trans Res,197,6

Based on a general dynamic programming principle, we are able to link the associated nonlinear expectation to a variational form of the Kolmogorov equation which opens the door for fast numerical pricing in the robust framework. The main novelty of the paper is that we propose a deep hedging approach which efficiently solves the hedging problem under parameter uncertainty. We numerically evaluate this method on simulated and real data and show that the robust deep hedging outperforms existing hedging approaches, in particular in highly volatile periods.","Lutkebohmert, Eva; Schmidt, Thorsten; Sester, Julian",,197,25

A structured review was conducted in PubMed, ScienceDirect, LILACS, SciELO, the Cochrane Library and Google Scholar on COVID-19 and ophthalmology. The Oxford Centre for Evidence Based Medicine 2011 Levels of Evidence worksheet was used for quality assessments. 1018 items were identified in the search; 26 records were included in the qualitative synthesis, which encompassed 6 literature reviews, 10 case series or cross-sectional studies, 4 case reports, and 6 intervention descriptions. Seventeen out of 26 records (65%) were categorized as level 5 within the Oxford CBME methodology grading system, the rest were level 4. The evidence generated on COVID-19 and ophthalmology to date is limited, although this is understandable given the circumstances. Both the possible presence of viral particles in tears and conjunctiva, and the potential for conjunctival transmission remain controversial. Ocular manifestations are not frequent and could resemble viral infection of the ocular surface. Most recommendations are based on the strategies implemented by Asian countries during previous coronavirus outbreaks. There is a need for substantive studies evaluating these strategies in the setting of SARS-CoV-2. In the meantime, plans for applying these measures must be implemented with caution, taking into account the context of each individual country, and undergo regular evaluation.","Emparan, Juan Pablo Olivares-de; Sardi-Correa, Carolina; López-Ulloa, Juan Alberto; Viteri-Soria, Jaime; Penniecook, Jason A; Jimenez-Román, Jesús; Lansingh, Van C",Arq Bras Oftalmol,197,1

We consider a cloud of Brownian particles of different sizes moving in a periodic potential and subjected to an unbiased driving as well as a constant force. We reveal an efficient separation strategy via the counterintuitive effect of negative mobility when particles of a given size are transported in a direction opposite to the applied constant force. We demonstrate a tunable separation solution in which size of the particle undergoing separation may be controlled by variation of the parameters of the external force applied to the system.

MeNTS score was higher in the Clavien-Dindo &#8805; II Group compared with the Clavien-Dindo < II Group (50.98 ± 8.98 vs 44.27 ± 8.90 respectively, p < 0.001). Duke activity status index (DASI) scores were lower, and American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status class, presence of smoking, leukocytosis, lymphopenia, elevated CRP, and intensive care requirement were higher in the Clavien-Dindo &#8805; II Group (p < 0.01). Length of hospital stay was longer in the Clavien-Dindo &#8805; II Group (15 [range 2-90] vs 4 [1-30] days; p < 0.001). Mortality was observed in 8 patients. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of MeNTS and DASI were 0.69 and 0.71, respectively, for predicting moderate/severe complications. CONCLUSIONS: Although significant, MeNTS score had low discriminating power in distinguishing patients with moderate/severe complications. Incorporation of a cardiovascular functional capacity measure could improve the scoring system.","Dinçer, Müserref Beril; Güler, Meltem Merve; Gök, Ali Fuat Kaan; Ilhan, Mehmet; Orhan-Sungur, Mukadder; Özkan-Seyhan, Tülay; Koltka, Ahmet Kemalettin",J.

The goal of this qualitative study was to explore how breast cancer patients experienced the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: As part of a larger study, 23 women accepted to take part in an individual phone interview investigating the psychosocial consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: The hybrid inductive-deductive thematic analysis revealed the following themes: (1) increased general psychological distress; (2) concerns about the impact of treatment-related immunosuppression (i.e., increased risk of catching the SARS-CoV-2 and of developing more severe complications); (3) higher risk of catching the SARS-CoV-2 in the hospital; (4) possible impact of changes in cancer care trajectory on prognosis; (5) distress related to going to treatment alone; (6) social isolation and decreased family relationships; (7) increased responsibility at home; (8) variety of coping strategies used (i.e., adherence to public health measures, seeking professional help, avoidance); (9) difficulty receiving professional mental health services and social support; (10) anxiety related to return to work; and (11) uncertainty about the future. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 outbreak is a major medical, psychological, social, and occupational stressor for women undergoing treatment for breast cancer. We offer recommendations to reduce the impact of subsequent waves of COVID-19 and other epidemics in this population.","Savard, Josée; Jobin-Théberge, Adèle; Massicotte, Véronique; Banville, Catherine",Support. care cancer,197,25

Bariatric patients are more prone to severe infection due to their high body mass index (BMI) and are more vulnerable to the effects of isolation, such as depression or disruption of their health habits. OBJECTIVES: To quantify the impact of self-quarantine on bariatric patients and self-quarantine's relationship with weight gain. SETTING: Academic hospital, United States. METHODS: A 30-item survey examining several known contributors to weight regain was distributed among the postoperative bariatric patients of our clinic. Changes in eating habits, exercise, depression, social support, loneliness, and anxiety were studied, among others. RESULTS: A total of 208 patients completed the survey (29.3% response rate). A large percentage of patients reported increases in their depression (44.2%), loneliness (36.2%), nervousness (54.7%), snacking (62.6%), loss of control when eating (48.2%), and binge eating (19.5%) and decreases in their social support (23.2%), healthy food eating (45.5%), and activity (55.2%). Difficulty in accessing vitamins was reported by 13%. Patients more than 18 months out of surgery regained more than 2 kg during an average of 47 days. Risk factors for weight regain were found to be loss of control when eating, increases in snacking and binge eating, reduced consumption of healthy food, and reduced physical activity. CONCLUSION: Bariatric patients are negatively affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent social isolation on many levels. This patient population is vulnerable to crisis situations; thus, additional intervention is needed to address behaviors that lead to weight regain.","Athanasiadis, Dimitrios I; Hernandez, Edward; Hilgendorf, William; Roper, Alexandra; Embry, Marisa; Selzer, Don; Stefanidis, Dimitrios",Surg. obes. relat. dis,197,17

AIM: To investigate the prognostic value of pretreatment contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) characteristics in patients with esophageal NEC. METHODS: Seventy-seven esophageal NEC patients who received contrast-enhanced CT at two hospitals were enrolled in this study from June 2014 to December 2019. The clinical features and image characteristics were recorded accordingly. Univariate survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test, and multivariate analysis was carried out with a Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS: The multivariate analysis performed using the Cox proportional hazards model showed that N stage, adjuvant chemotherapy, and degree of enhancement were independent prognostic factors for overall survival (OS). Meanwhile, adjuvant chemotherapy was an independent prognostic factor for progression-free survival (PFS). The hazard ratios (HRs) of N stage, adjuvant chemotherapy, and degree of enhancement (mild vs moderate/marked) for OS were 0.426 (P = 0.024), 3.862 (P = 0.006), and 2.169/0.809 (P = 0.037), respectively. The HR of adjuvant chemotherapy for PFS was 6.432 (P < 0.001). Adjuvant chemotherapy was significantly associated with degree of enhancement (P = 0.018). CONCLUSION: Adjuvant chemotherapy is an independent prognostic factor for OS and PFS. Additionally, N stage and degree of enhancement are prognostic factors for OS in patients with esophageal NEC.","Zhou, Yue; Hou, Ping; Zha, Kai-Ji; Wang, Feng; Zhou, Kun; He, Wei; Gao, Jian-Bo",World J Gastroenterol,197,20

However, region-wise average duration of recovery from COVID-19 has not been attempted; hence, an effort has been made to estimate state-wise recovery duration of India's COVID-19 patients. Determining the recovery time in each region is intended to assist healthcare professionals in providing better care and planning of logistics. Methods: This study used database provided by Kaggle, which takes data from the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare. The simple Linear Regression model between incidence, prevalence, and duration was used to assess the duration of COVID-19 disease in various Indian states. Results: The fitted model suits ideal for most of the states, except for some union territories and northeastern states. The average time to recover from disease was ranging from 5 to 36 days in Indian states/union territories except for Madhya Pradesh. Tamil Nadu has an average recovery time of 7 days with an value of 0.96, followed by Odisha, Karnataka, West Bengal, Kerala and Chhattisgarh and the average recovery duration was estimated as 7, 13, 17, 11, 14 and 12 days respectively. Conclusion: The average recovery from COVID-19 was ten or less days in twenty percentage of states, whereas in forty-four percentage of states/union territories had an average recovery duration between ten to twenty days. However, around twentyfour percentage of states/union territory recovered between twenty to thirty days. In the rest of Indian states/union territories, the average duration of recovery was more than thirty days.","George, Noel; Tyagi, Naresh K; Prasad, Jang Bahadur",Clin Epidemiol Glob Health,197,8

Our aims were to evaluate the presence of acute pancreatitis in COVID-19 patients and to assess the frequency of pancreatic hyperenzymemia. METHODS: From April 1, 2020, to April 30, 2020, 110 consecutive patients (69 males, 41 females; mean age, 63.0 years; range, 24-93 years) met these criteria and were enrolled in the study. The clinical data and serum activity of pancreatic amylase and lipase were assayed in all patients using commercially available kits. RESULTS: None of the patients studied developed clinical signs or morphological alterations compatible with acute pancreatitis. However, it was found that 24.5% of the patients had amylase values above 53 IU/L and 16.4% had lipase values above 300 IU/L. Only 1 patient (0.9%) had both amylase and lipase values in excess of 3-fold the upper normal limit without clinical signs of pancreatitis. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of pancreatic hyperenzymemia in a patient with COVID-19 requires the management of these patients be guided by clinical evaluation and not merely by evaluation of the biochemical results.","Pezzilli, Raffaele; Centanni, Stefano; Mondoni, Michele; Rinaldo, Rocco F; Davì, Matteo; Stefanelli, Rossana; d039, Melzi; Eril, Gianvico; Barassi, Alessandra",Pancreas,197,26

METHODS: We started to develop a pandemic plan to maintain oncological rehabilitation in February 2020. With the involvement of the whole clinic staff we developed protection scenarios with the aim of achieving Covid-19-free clinics. Schedules were developed and implemented based on the epidemiological bulletins of the RKI (Robert Koch Institute, Germany) of 2017 (influenza infection) and 2020 (Covid-19). The effects of these measures were evaluated by means of a patient and employee survey. RESULTS: The challenges of the pandemic have been successfully implemented. Both the patient and employee surveys showed a high level of acceptance of the measures. For example, 98.5% of patients stated that the continuation of rehabilitation was important for their health, even in the pandemic situation. At the same time, 87% felt safe. 88% of all employees (MA) and 93% of MA in the risk group stated that the protective measures were introduced at the right time. At the same time, 76% of all employees and 84% of the employees in the risk group agreed with the additional burden. In spite of the high risk potential in the clinics (immunocompromised patients, patients from different districts with different levels of exposure), an outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 could be avoided in the clinics. CONCLUSION: The timely roll-out of adapted pandemic rules in rehabilitation clinics enables the continuation of high-quality oncological rehabilitation even in pandemic times and thus contributes to a stabilisation of the supply chain for cancer diseases. A high level of acceptance of the measures among patients and hospital staff was evaluated.","Leibbrand, Birgit; Seifart, Ulf",Rehabilitation (Stuttg),197,30

One is the existence of asymptomatic carriers which is a hidden variable in the problem. The other is the issue of latency which means that among the symptomatic carriers there could be a fraction whose symptoms develop after a couple of days. Our modelling is restricted to what we call the Phase -1 of the disease. During this phase the disease sets in and the number of infected people starts growing fast ( the number of new cases per day keeps growing on an average ) and then it slows down ( the number of new cases per day starts decreasing ) with the number of new cases decreasing to about one tenth of its peak value or even smaller). We define Phase-1 to be over when the daily cases start rising once again. We write down a Henon-like map to take various effects into account for this first phase.,"Pal, Akshay; Bhattacharjee, Jayanta K",,197,21

While healthcare systems need to cope with the need to treat a large number of people with different degrees of respiratory failure, actions to preserve aliquots of the healthcare system to guarantee treatment to patients are mandatory. METHODS: In order to protect the Fondazione IRCCS-Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori di Milano from the spread of COVID-19, a number of to-hospital and within-hospital filters were applied. Among others, a triage process to detect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) positivity in patients with cancer was developed consisting of high-resolution low-dose computed tomography (CT) scan followed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) detection of SARS-CoV-2 in nose-throat swabs whenever CT was suggestive of lung infection. To serve symptomatic patients who were already admitted to the hospital or in need of hospitalization while waiting for RT-PCR laboratory confirmation of infection, a COVID-19 surveillance zone was set up. RESULTS: A total of 301 patients were screened between March 6 and April 3, 2020. Of these, 47 were hospitalized, 53 needed a differential diagnosis to continue with their cancer treatment, and 201 were about to undergo surgery. RT-PCR was positive in 13 of 40 hospitalized patients (32%), 14 of 52 day hospital patients (27%), and 6 of 201 surgical patients (3%). CONCLUSION: Applying filters to protect our comprehensive cancer center from COVID-19 spread contributed to guaranteeing cancer care during the COVID-19 crisis in Milan. A surveillance area and surgical triage allowed us to protect the hospital from as many as 33 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.","Valenza, Franco; Papagni, Gabriele; Marchianò, Alfonso; Daidone, Maria Grazia; DeBraud, Filippo; Colombo, Mario Paolo; Frignani, Andrea; Galmozzi, Gustavo; Ladisa, Vito; Pruneri, Giancarlo; Salvioni, Roberto; Spada, Pierangelo; Torresani, Michele; Rinaldi, Oliviero; Manfredi, Stefano; Votta, Marco; Apolone, Giovanni",Tumori,197,16

We report the preliminary results of a targeted program of COVID-19 infection testing in the ED in the first 10 days of its initiation at our institution. METHODS: We conducted a review of prospectively collected data on all ED patients who had targeted testing for acute COVID-19 infection at two EDs during the initial 10 days of testing (March 10-19, 2020). During this initial period with limited resources, testing was targeted toward high-risk patients per Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines. Data collected from patients who were tested included demographics, clinical characteristics, and test qualifying criteria. We present the data overall and by test results with descriptive statistics. RESULTS: During the 10-day study period, the combined census of the study EDs was 2157 patient encounters. A total of 283 tests were ordered in the ED. The majority of patients were 18-64 years of age, male, non-Hispanic white, had an Emergency Severity Index score of three, did not have a fever, and were discharged from the ED. A total of 29 (10.2%) tested positive. Symptoms-based criteria most associated with COVID-19 were the most common criteria identified for testing (90.6%). All other criteria were reported in 5.51-43.0% of persons being tested. Having contact with a person under investigation was significantly more common in those who tested positive compared to those who tested negative (63% vs 24.5%, respectively). The majority of patients in both results groups had at least two qualifying criteria for testing (75.2%). CONCLUSION: In this review of prospectively collected data on all ED patients who had targeted testing for acute COVID-19 infection at two EDs in the first 10 days of testing, we found that 10.2% of those tested were identified as positive. The continued monitoring of testing and results will help providers understand how COVID-19 is progressing in the community.","Tolia, Vaishal M; Chan, Theodore C; Castillo, Edward M",West J Emerg Med,197,2

Whole-genome SARS-CoV-2 sequence data collected from community-based diagnostic testing for COVID-19 show an extremely rapid expansion of the B.1.1.7 lineage during autumn 2020, suggesting that it has a selective advantage. Here we show that changes in VOC frequency inferred from genetic data correspond closely to changes inferred by S gene target failures (SGTF) in community-based diagnostic PCR testing. Analysis of trends in SGTF and non-SGTF case numbers in local areas across England shows that B.1.1.7 has higher transmissibility than non-VOC lineages, even if it has a different latent period or generation time. The SGTF data indicate a transient shift in the age composition of reported cases, with cases of B.1.1.7 including a larger share of under 20-year-olds than non-VOC cases. We estimated time-varying reproduction numbers for B.1.1.7 and co-circulating lineages using SGTF and genomic data. The best-supported models did not indicate a substantial difference in VOC transmissibility among different age groups, but all analyses agreed that B.1.1.7 has a substantial transmission advantage over other lineages, with a 50% to 100% higher reproduction number.","Volz, Erik; Mishra, Swapnil; Chand, Meera; Barrett, Jeffrey C; Johnson, Robert; Geidelberg, Lily; Hinsley, Wes R; Laydon, Daniel J; Dabrera, Gavin; O039,; Toole, Áine; Amato, Robert; Ragonnet-Cronin, Manon; Harrison, Ian; Jackson, Ben; Ariani, Cristina V; Boyd, Olivia; Loman, Nicholas J; McCrone, John T; Gonçalves, Sónia; Jorgensen, David; Myers, Richard; Hill, Verity; Jackson, David K; Gaythorpe, Katy; Groves, Natalie; Sillitoe, John; Kwiatkowski, Dominic P; Flaxman, Seth; Ratmann, Oliver; Bhatt, Samir; Hopkins, Susan; Gandy, Axel; Rambaut, Andrew; Ferguson, Neil M",Nature,197,20

It is also mused that the reduced disease burden from infectious diseases has paradoxically reduced the perceived requirement for vaccine uptake. Our analysis using Google Trends has shown that throughout the pandemic the search interest in a coronavirus vaccine has increased and remained high throughout. Peaks are found when public declarations are made, the case number increases significantly, or when vaccine breakthroughs are announced.

The objectives of the study are twofold: a) to examine dose-response relationships between physical activity (PA) components (volume, intensity, frequency, duration) and depressive symptoms of the population during confinement, and b) to identify the optimal levels of PA to mitigate notable depressive symptoms (NDS). METHODS: 4,811 (2,952 women) Spanish citizens, age range 16-92 years, completed an online questionnaire (snowball sampling) to measure their levels of depressive symptoms, PA, and various anthropometric and sociometric variables. Volume (METs-min/week), frequency (days/week), and duration (hours) were examined using logistic regressions with restricted cubic splines. RESULTS: The PA components were inversely associated with NDS. Performing at least 477 METs-min/week was associated with a 33% decrease in probability of NDS, and reaching 3,000 METs-min/week was associated with the lowest risk of NDS (47%). As for frequency, with 10 times/week the probability of NDS was 56% lower. At 10 hours of weekly practice, the probability of NDS was 39% lower.

The optimal duration of DAPT after PCI remains controversial at present. The purpose of this meta-analysis was to investigate the efficacy and safety of short-term DAPT in patients undergoing PCI. PubMed, Embase, Cochrane and Web of science from inception to September 2019 were systematically searched. Randomized controlled trials were included to compare short term (3 months or less) with a standard 12-months DAPT in patients undergoing PCI. Random effect model and fixed effect model wereused to calculate the risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of each endpoint. This meta-analysis included 38479 patients undergoing PCI from 8 randomized clinical trials. No difference was observed in the risk of all-cause death (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.80-1.06, P = 0.25), cardiovascular death (RR 0.88, 0.69-1.12, P = 0.29), myocardial infarction (RR 1.05, 0.94-1.19, P = 0.38), definite or probable stent thrombosis (RR 1.05, 0.80-1.36, P = 0.73), and stroke (RR 1.02, 0.80-1.30, P = 0.89) between short term and standard DAPT. The short-term DAPT could reduce the risk of major bleeding (RR 0.67, 0.48-0.94, P = 0.02) and any bleeding (RR 0.63, 0.48-0.82, P = 0.0005) compared with 12 months of DAPT.

Not only were gene expression and mutation patterns detected, but also there were correlation and survival analysis between ACE2 and other target genes expression levels. The total genetic anomaly carrying rate of target genes, including ACE2, TMPRSS2, CD147/BSG, and FURIN/PCSK3, was determined as 8.1% and 21 mutations were detected, with 7 of these mutations having pathogenic features. p.H34N on the RBD binding residues for SARS-CoV-2 was determined in our LUAD patient group. According to gene expression analysis results, though the TMPRSS2 level was statistically significantly decreased in the LUSC patient group compared to healthy control, the ACE2 level was determined to be high in LUAD and LUSC groups. There were no meaningful differences in the expression of CD147 and FURIN genes. The challenge for today is building the assessment of genomic susceptibility to COVID-19 in lung cancer, requiring detailed experimental laboratory studies, in addition to in silico analyses, as a way of assessing the mechanism of novel virus invasion that can be used in the development of effective SARS-CoV-2 therapy.","Ilikci Sagkan, Rahsan; Akin-Bali, Dilara Fatma",J. med. virol,197,1

Our analysis exploits the fact that the epidemic was more advanced in some regions than in others when certain lockdown measures came into force, based on measuring health outcomes relative to the region-specific start of the epidemic and comparing outcomes across regions with earlier and later start dates. When estimating the effect of the relative timing of measures, we control for regional characteristics and initial epidemic trends by linear regression (Germany and Switzerland), doubly robust estimation (Germany), or synthetic controls (Switzerland). We find for both countries that a relatively later exposure to the measures entails higher cumulative hospitalization and death rates on region-specific days after the outbreak of the epidemic, suggesting that an earlier imposition of measures is more effective than a later one. For Germany, we also evaluate curfews (as introduced in a subset of states) based on cross-regional variation. We do not find any effects of curfews on top of the federally imposed contact restriction that banned groups of more than 2 individuals. Finally, an analysis of mobility patterns in Switzerland shows an immediate behavioral effect of the lockdown in terms of reduced mobility.","Huber, Martin; Langen, Henrika",,197,5

However, 5,298 additional patients were confirmed until March 4, 2020. Therefore, our objective was to estimate the reproduction number (R) and evaluate the effectiveness of preventive measures. METHODS: A COVID-19 transmission model (SEIHR) was established to suit the Korean outbreak. The number of daily confirmed cases in Daegu and North Gyeongsang Province (NGP), the main area of outbreak, was used. The first patient' symptom onset date in the Daegu/NGP outbreak was assumed as January 22, 2020. The R according to the start date of the effect of preventive measures was estimated. RESULTS: The estimated R in Hubei Province, China, was 4.0281, whereas the estimated initial R in Korea was 0.555, but later in Daegu/NGP, the value was between 3.472 and 3.543. When the transmission period decreases from 4-day to 2-day, the outbreak ends early, but the peak of the epidemic increases, and the total number of patients does not change greatly. It was found that, if transmission rate decreases, the outbreak ends early, and the size of the peak and the total number of patients also decreases. CONCLUSIONS: To end the COVID-19 epidemic, efforts to reduce the spread of the virus, such as social distancing and wearing masks, are absolutely crucial with the participation of the public, along with the policy of reducing the transmission period by finding and isolating patients as quickly as possible through the efforts of the quarantine authorities.","Choi, Sunhwa; Ki, Moran",Epidemiol Health,197,1

The pathological substrate for these findings remains unknown. Here we show that the lungs of patients with COVID-19 contain infected pneumocytes with abnormal morphology and frequent multinucleation. The generation of these syncytia results from activation of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein at the cell plasma membrane level. On the basis of these observations, we performed two high-content microscopy-based screenings with more than 3,000 approved drugs to search for inhibitors of spike-driven syncytia. We converged on the identification of 83 drugs that inhibited spike-mediated cell fusion, several of which belonged to defined pharmacological classes. We focused our attention on effective drugs that also protected against virus replication and associated cytopathicity. One of the most effective molecules was the antihelminthic drug niclosamide, which markedly blunted calcium oscillations and membrane conductance in spike-expressing cells by suppressing the activity of TMEM16F (also known as anoctamin 6), a calcium-activated ion channel and scramblase that is responsible for exposure of phosphatidylserine on the cell surface. These findings suggest a potential mechanism for COVID-19 disease pathogenesis and support the repurposing of niclosamide for therapy.","Braga, Luca; Ali, Hashim; Secco, Ilaria; Chiavacci, Elena; Neves, Guilherme; Goldhill, Daniel; Penn, Rebecca; Jimenez-Guardeño, Jose M; Ortega-Prieto, Ana M; Bussani, Rossana; Cannatà, Antonio; Rizzari, Giorgia; Collesi, Chiara; Schneider, Edoardo; Arosio, Daniele; Shah, Ajay M; Barclay, Wendy S; Malim, Michael H; Burrone, Juan; Giacca, Mauro",Nature,197,12

The impact of shelter-in-place orders on older adults' health and well-being is still unclear. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between life-space mobility and quality of life (QoL) in older adults with and without frailty during the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: Multicenter prospective cohort study based on structured telephone interviews. SETTING: Four geriatric outpatient clinics in the metropolitan area of Sao Paulo, Brazil. PARTICIPANTS: 557 community-dwelling adults aged 60 years and older. MEASUREMENTS: The Life-Space Assessment was used to measure community mobility before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, and a previously validated decrease of &#8805; 5 points defined restricted life-space mobility. Frailty was assessed through the FRAIL (fatigue, resistance, ambulation, illnesses, and loss of weight) scale. The impact of shelter-in-place orders on QoL was evaluated with the question «How is the COVID-19 pandemic affecting your QoL?¼, to which participants could respond «not at all¼, «to some extent¼, or «to a great extent¼. We used ordinal logistic regressions to investigate the relationship between restricted life-space mobility and impact on QoL, adjusting our analyses for demographics, frailty, comorbidities, cognition, functionality, loneliness, depression, and anxiety. We explored whether frailty modified the association between life-space mobility and impact on QoL. RESULTS: Participants were on average 80±8 years old, 65% were women, and 33% were frail. The COVID-19 quarantine led to a restriction of community mobility in 79% of participants and affected the QoL for 77% of participants. We found that restricted life-space mobility was associated with impact on QoL in older adults during the pandemic, although frailty modified the magnitude of the association (P-value for interaction=0.03). Frail participants who experienced restricted life-space mobility had twice the odds of reporting an impact on QoL when compared with non-frail individuals, with respective adjusted odds ratios of 4.20 (95% CI=2.36-7.50) and 2.18 (95% CI=1.33-3.58). CONCLUSION: Older adults experienced substantial decreases in life-space mobility during the COVID-19 pandemic, and this unexpected change impacted their QoL.

In some cases, positive viral stool tests may be the only indicator of infection at admission or after leaving quarantine. Without supplemental stool tests, the risk of undetected COVID-19 transmission is high. Moreover, viral exposure during the regular or emergency endoscopic examination should be avoided. We carefully discuss key gastrointestinal concerns with regard to COVID-19 and call for more attention to such problems.","Nie, Kai; Yang, Yuan-Yuan; Deng, Min-Zi; Wang, Xiao-Yan",World J. Clin.

METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study. The participants were recruited by the snowball sampling method, and the data were collected by means of a link sent to their smartphones through their social media accounts. This study included 211 households with at least 1 child. RESULTS: The study revealed that 21.8% households had food insecurity that was not at the hunger threshold. The monthly income of 80.6% of the households was below the poverty line and monthly income decreased in more than half of the households during the pandemic. Food insecurity increased 2.5 times when the households comprised workers or self-employed individuals (odds ratio [OR] = 2.529; P = 0.002), increased 3 times when the monthly income of the households decreased (OR = 3.131; P = 0.000), and increased 2 times when total monthly income of the household fell below poverty line during the pandemic (OR = 2.001; P = 0.049). CONCLUSIONS: It is determined that nearly half the households have food insecurity and that the pandemic poses a risk in terms of food security. We recommend that public health studies should be planned to ensure accessibility to healthy foods.","Bulucu Büyüksoy, Gizem Deniz; Çatiker, Aslihan; Özdil, Kamuran",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,197,1

Here we report quantum walks of biphoton frequency combs where the duration of the walk, or circuit depth, is tunable over a continuous range without any change to the physical footprint of the system-a feature absent from previous photonic implementations. In our platform, entangled photon pairs hop between discrete frequency modes with the coupling between these modes mediated by electro-optic modulation of the waveguide refractive index. Through control of the phase across different modes, we demonstrate a rich variety of behavior: from walks exhibiting enhanced ballistic transport or strong energy confinement, to subspaces featuring scattering centers or local traps. We also explore the role of entanglement dimensionality in the creation of energy bound states, which illustrates the potential for these walks to quantify high-dimensional entanglement.","Imany, Poolad; Lingaraju, Navin B; Alshaykh, Mohammed S; Leaird, Daniel E; Weiner, Andrew M",Sci Adv,197,1

In this paper, we assess the impact of COVID-19 on world scientific production in the life sciences. We investigate how the usage of medical subject headings (MeSH) has changed following the outbreak. We estimate through a difference-in-differences approach the impact of COVID-19 on scientific production through PubMed. We find that COVID-related research topics have risen to prominence, displaced clinical publications, diverted funds away from research areas not directly related to COVID-19 and that the number of publications on clinical trials in unrelated fields has contracted.

To characterize the burden of COVID-19 in the Federal Bureau of Prisons, inmate testing, case, and mortality rates are calculated and compared with those of the U.S. METHODS: Federal Bureau of Prisons data were derived from its inmate management system and a Federal Bureau of Prisons COVID-19-specific database. U.S. data were derived from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. Census. Data were aggregated from February to September 2020 and accessed in September and November 2020. Testing rates were calculated for both the Federal Bureau of Prisons and the U.S. Case and infection fatality rates were calculated overall and by institution and compared with those of the U.S. An age- and sex-standardized mortality ratio was calculated. RESULTS: The Federal Bureau of Prisons tested more than half of its inmates (50.3%); its crude case and mortality rates were 11,710.1 and 77.4 per 100,000, respectively. Compared with the U.S., the case ratio was 4.7, and the standardized mortality ratio was 2.6. The infection fatality rate for both the Federal Bureau of Prisons and the U.S. was 0.7%. Among institutions that tested &#8805;85% of inmates, the combined infection fatality rate was 0.8% and ranged from 0.0% to 3.0%. CONCLUSIONS: The Federal Bureau of Prisons COVID-19 case rates and standard mortality ratio were approximately 5 and 2.5 times those in U.S. adults, respectively, consistent with those of prisons nationwide. High testing rates and standardized death reporting could result in a more accurate infection fatality rate in the Federal Bureau of Prisons than in the U.S. Testing and other mitigation strategies, including reducing the population, have likely prevented further transmission and mortality in the Federal Bureau of Prisons.","Toblin, Robin L; Hagan, Liesl M",Am. j. prev. med,197,1

Protein folding is highly dependent on folding of secondary structures as the way to pave a native folding pathway. Here, we demonstrate that a feature of a large hydrophobic surface area covering most side-chains on one side or the other side of adjacent $\beta$-strands of a $\beta$-sheet is prevail in almost all experimentally determined $\beta$-sheets, indicating that folding of $\beta$-sheets is most likely triggered by multistage hydrophobic interactions among neighbored side-chains of unfolded polypeptides, enable $\beta$-sheets fold reproducibly following explicit physical folding codes in aqueous environments. $\beta$-turns often contain five types of residues characterized with relatively small exposed hydrophobic proportions of their side-chains, that is explained as these residues can block hydrophobic effect among neighbored side-chains in sequence. Temperature dependence of the folding of $\beta$-sheet is thus attributed to temperature dependence of the strength of the hydrophobicity. The hydrophobic-effect-based mechanism responsible for $\beta$-sheets folding is verified by bioinformatics analyses of thousands of results available from experiments. The folding codes in amino acid sequence that dictate formation of a $\beta$-hairpin can be deciphered through evaluating hydrophobic interaction among side-chains of an unfolded polypeptide from a $\beta$-strand-like thermodynamic metastable state.","Li, Jiacheng; Ma, Xiaoliang; Zhang, Hongchi; Hou, Chengyu; Shi, Liping; Guo, Shuai; Liao, Chenchen; Zheng, Bing; Ye, Lin; Yang, Lin; He, Xiaodong",,197,13

The authors sought to determine the impact of COVID-19 on cancer treatment, anxiety, and financial distress among low-income patients with gynecologic cancer during the peak of the NYC pandemic. METHODS: Medicaid-insured women who were receiving gynecologic oncology care at 2 affiliated centers were contacted by telephone interviews between March 15 and April 15, 2020. Demographics and clinical characteristics were obtained through self-report and retrospective chart review. Financial toxicity, anxiety, and cancer worry were assessed using modified, validated surveys. RESULTS: In total, 100 patients completed the telephone interview. The median age was 60 years (range, 19-86 years), and 71% had an annual income <$40,000. A change in employment status and early stage cancer (stage I and II) were associated with an increase in financial distress (P < .001 and P = .008, respectively). Early stage cancer and telehealth participation were significantly associated with increased worry about future finances (P = .017 and P = .04, respectively). Lower annual income (<$40,000) was associated with increased cancer worry and anxiety compared with higher annual income (>$40,000; P = .036 and P = .017, respectively). When controlling for telehealth participation, income, primary language, and residence in a high COVID-19 prevalence area, a delay in medical care resulted in a 4-fold increased rate of anxiety (P = .023, 95% CI, 1.278-14.50). Race was not significantly associated with increased financial distress, cancer worry, or anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: Low socioeconomic status was the most common risk factor for increased financial distress, cancer worry, and anxiety. Interventions aimed at improving access to timely oncology care should be implemented during this ongoing pandemic.","Chen, Yiting Stefanie; Zhou, Zhen Ni; Glynn, Shannon M; Frey, Melissa K; Balogun, Onyinye D; Kanis, Margaux; Holcomb, Kevin; Gorelick, Constantine; Thomas, Charlene; Christos, Paul J; Chapman-Davis, Eloise",Cancer,197,20

STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a cross-sectional study between April 16th and May 7th 2020 using online questionnaires. METHODS: The sample was reweighted to be representative of the French population by age and sex, region and education level. Ordered logistic, logistic and negative binomial regressions were used to estimate the factors associated with quarantine support, with the opinion on quarantine extension, with the number and type of trips outside the quarantine home and with the acceptability and potential use of a contact-tracing application. RESULTS: After reweighting, full data for regression analyses were available for 1849 respondents. Attitudes and opinions regarding quarantine are correlated with the perceived COVID-19 threat, the perceived benefits of quarantine, trust in the government, well-being during quarantine and risk preferences. Trust in the government, perceived individual health consequences in case of COVID-19 infection and time preferences are associated with the willingness to use a contact-tracing application. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis indicates that prevention campaigns that stress the individual risk in case of infection or the benefits of quarantine could foster compliance to quarantine protocols. Remote psychological support might also promote quarantine adherence among individuals most distressed by the quarantine. Moreover, public communications should focus on restoring trust among the population as trust is strongly correlated with the willingness to use a contact-tracing application.","Guillon, M; Kergall, P",Public Health,197,16

Methods: Data were collected retrospectively on consecutive patients with COVID-19 who developed acute focal brain ischaemia (between 1 March and 19 April 2020) at a tertiary university hospital in Madrid (Spain). Results: During the study period, 1594 patients were diagnosed with COVID-19. We found 22 patients with ischaemic stroke (1.38%), 6 of whom did not meet the inclusion criteria. The remaining 16 patients were included in the study (15 cases of ischaemic stroke and one case of transient ischaemic attack).Median baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was 9 (interquartile range: 16), and mean (standard deviation) age was 73 years (12.8).

Emerging data suggests that older patients with COVID-19 associated with other comorbid conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, heart and lung diseases are particularly more susceptible, compared to general populations, and have higher mortality. It is not yet clear whether this increased association of high blood pressure with COVID-19 and the increased risk of mortality are directly related to high blood pressure or other associated comorbidities, or to antihypertensive treatment. Although the underlying pathogenic mechanism linking hypertension and severity of COVID-19 infection remains to be elucidated, it has been hypothesized that excessive activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) could contribute to the progression of COVID-19 related lung injury. Concern about whether angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may have deleterious effects on morbidity and mortality in patients with COVID-19 is based on speculation that these drugs would increase the regulation of angiotensin II converting enzyme (ACE2), a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, which would increase viral load and lung damage. Recent studies are consistent with the recommendations of scientific societies that propose avoiding the suspension or change of antihypertensive medication, as there is no evidence that shows that these can be taken as risk factors for severity or mortality from COVID-19.","Molina, Dora Inés; Muñoz, Tania Marcela; Guevara, Katterine",Rev.

We aimed to compare in-hospital mortality and other patient characteristics between the first and second waves. METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, we analysed data from the DATCOV national active surveillance system for COVID-19 admissions to hospital from March 5, 2020, to March 27, 2021. The system contained data from all hospitals in South Africa that have admitted a patient with COVID-19. We used incidence risk for admission to hospital and determined cutoff dates to define five wave periods: pre-wave 1, wave 1, post-wave 1, wave 2, and post-wave 2. We compared the characteristics of patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to hospital in wave 1 and wave 2, and risk factors for in-hospital mortality accounting for wave period using random-effect multivariable logistic regression. FINDINGS: Peak rates of COVID-19 cases, admissions, and in-hospital deaths in the second wave exceeded rates in the first wave: COVID-19 cases, 240·4 cases per 100 000 people vs 136·0 cases per 100 000 people; admissions, 27·9 admissions per 100 000 people vs 16·1 admissions per 100 000 people; deaths, 8·3 deaths per 100 000 people vs 3·6 deaths per 100 000 people. The weekly average growth rate in hospital admissions was 20% in wave 1 and 43% in wave 2 (ratio of growth rate in wave 2 compared with wave 1 was 1·19, 95% CI 1·18-1·20). Compared with the first wave, individuals admitted to hospital in the second wave were more likely to be age 40-64 years (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1·22, 95% CI 1·14-1·31), and older than 65 years (aOR 1·38, 1·25-1·52), compared with younger than 40 years; of Mixed race (aOR 1·21, 1·06-1·38) compared with White race; and admitted in the public sector (aOR 1·65, 1·41-1·92); and less likely to be Black (aOR 0·53, 0·47-0·60) and Indian (aOR 0·77, 0·66-0·91), compared with White; and have a comorbid condition (aOR 0·60, 0·55-0·67). For multivariable analysis, after adjusting for weekly COVID-19 hospital admissions, there was a 31% increased risk of in-hospital mortality in the second wave (aOR 1·31, 95% CI 1·28-1·35). In-hospital case-fatality risk increased from 17·7% in weeks of low admission (<3500 admissions) to 26·9% in weeks of very high admission (>8000 admissions; aOR 1·24, 1·17-1·32). INTERPRETATION: In South Africa, the second wave was associated with higher incidence of COVID-19, more rapid increase in admissions to hospital, and increased in-hospital mortality. Although some of the increased mortality can be explained by admissions in the second wave being more likely in older individuals, in the public sector, and by the increased health system pressure, a residual increase in mortality of patients admitted to hospital could be related to the new Beta lineage.

Herein, a palladium-catalyzed direct and specific C-7 acylation of indolines in the presence of an easily removed directing group was developed. This strategy usually is considered as a practical strategy for the preparation of acylated indoles because indoline can be easily converted to indole under oxidation conditions. In particular, our strategy greatly improved the alkacylation yield of indolines for which only an unsatisfactory yield could be achieved in the previous studies.

METHODS: A customized 19-item survey and the perceived stress scale (PSS) were applied to undergraduate dental students from the US, Spain, Ireland, Chile, India, and Brazil between April 10 and July 5, 2020. Linear modeling and mediation analysis were used to explore the relationships among demographics, stressors, coping mechanisms, social support, and stress RESULTS: A total of 4475 students responded to the survey. The majority (72.4%) were women, and 52.3% had no COVID-19 training at the time of the survey. The students reported that they had to accommodate to changes in patient care (96.6%) and didactic learning (95.2%) activities, while 88.5% of the respondents indicated at least one of their courses moved online. Transition to online courses went ""smoothly with some troubles"" for 51.8% of the respondents, and 48.3% perceived the faculty as prepared for the online transition; however, 45.9% reported feeling extremely concerned about the impact of COVID-19 on their education. The average PSS score was 21.9 of 40 (moderate stress). Multivariate models were built for participants with full data (n = 3899). Being male, having completed more dental coursework, and perceiving a smoother transition were associated with lower PSS scores; more concern about academic progress was associated with higher PSS. Faculty support mediated the relationship between a smoothness of transition and concern about academic progress and PSS scores CONCLUSION: Stress caused by the pandemic may be alleviated by smoother transition and good faculty support.","Klaassen, Hannah; Ashida, Sato; Comnick, Carissa L; Xie, Xian Jin; Smith, Becky M; Tabrizi, Maryam; Arsenault, Karin; Capin, Oriana R; Scully, Allison C; da Mata, Cristiane; Soto, Annetty P; Dias Ribeiro, Ana Paula; Prince, David; Christensen, Angela; Giner-Tarrida, Lluís; Satorres Nieto, Marta; León, Soraya; Gambetta-Tessini, Karla; Santos, Mateus B F; Dias da Silva, Marco Antonio; Pereira, Andresa C; Dias do Carmo, Elaine; Aurora Stabile Gonnelli, Fernanda; Carvalho, Fabíola G; Collares, Kaue; Bervian, Juliane; Sarkis-Onofre, Rafael; Jerfeson Dos Santos Gonçalves, Francisco; Bueno-Silva, Bruno; Estela Haddad, Ana; Gurgel, Bruno César de Vasconcelos; Alves, Polliana M; Shigli, Kamal; Nayak, Sushma S; Nayak, Prajna P; Murugaboopathy, Vikneshan; Savitha, P N; Murthy, Varsha; Deshpande, Saee; Marchini, Leonardo",J Dent Educ,197,16

In some types of lysosomal diseases, enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is administered intravenously in weekly or biweekly doses. Unfortunately, scheduled ERT during COVID-19 was disrupted. We considered the possibility of adverse outcomes caused by the disruption in the treatment of patients with lysosomal storage disorders. METHODS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, we conducted a questionnaire that was delivered via Internet to assess how this vulnerable patient group was affected by the pandemic in terms of their access to treatment and their disease-related symptoms. RESULTS: The questionnaire was filled out by 75 patients. There were 35 patients whose treatment dose was missed because of COVID-19. The most common reason for skipping treatment was not wanting to go to the hospital for fear of contracting COVID-19. These 35 patients missed a median of four doses of ERT (range: 1-16 dosages). Twenty-one patients (60%) claimed that they were affected physically by not taking ERT (20 mucopolysaccaridoses, 1 Fabry disease), whereas 14 (40%) did not. CONCLUSIONS: Interruption of ERT during the COVID-19 pandemic may have significant consequences. It may be beneficial to switch to home treatment or reserve dedicated facilities.

However, this procedure requires specialized medical personnel, centralized laboratory facilities, and time to provide results (from several hours up to 1 d). In addition, there is a non-negligible risk of viral transmission for the operator who performs the procedure. For these reasons, several studies have suggested the use of other body fluids, including saliva, for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. The use of saliva as a diagnostic specimen has numerous advantages: it is easily self-collected by the patient with almost no discomfort, it does not require specialized health care personnel for its management, and it reduces the risks for the operator. In the past few months, several scientific papers, media, and companies have announced the development of new salivary tests to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection. Posterior oropharyngeal saliva should be distinguished from oral saliva, since the former is a part of respiratory secretions, while the latter is produced by the salivary glands, which are outside the respiratory tract. Saliva can be analyzed through standard (rRT-PCR) or rapid molecular biology tests (direct rRT-PCR without extraction), although, in a hospital setting, these procedures may be performed only in addition to nasopharyngeal swabs to minimize the incidence of false-negative results. Conversely, the promising role of saliva in the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is highlighted by the emergence of point-of-care technologies and, most important, point-of-need devices. Indeed, these devices can be directly used in workplaces, airports, schools, cinemas, and shopping centers. An example is the recently described Rapid Salivary Test, an antigen test based on the lateral flow assay, which detects the presence of the virus by identifying the spike protein in the saliva within a few minutes.","Azzi, L; Maurino, V; Baj, A; Dani, M; d039,; Aiuto, A; Fasano, M; Lualdi, M; Sessa, F; Alberio, T",J Dent Res,197,20

Traditionally, 1 cell type is used for TPP studies, with the risk of missing important differentially expressed target proteins. The use of whole organisms would circumvent this problem. Zebrafish embryos are amenable to such an approach. Here, we used TPP on whole zebrafish embryo lysate to identify protein targets of napabucasin, a compound that may affect signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) signaling through an ill-understood mechanism. In zebrafish embryos, napabucasin induced developmental defects consistent with inhibition of Stat3 signaling. TPP profiling showed no distinct shift in Stat3 upon napabucasin treatment, but effects were detected on the oxidoreductase, Pora, which might explain effects on Stat3 signaling. Interestingly, thermal stability of several aldehyde dehydrogenases was affected. Moreover, napabucasin activated aldehyde dehydrogenase enzymatic activity in vitro. Aldehyde dehydrogenases have crucial roles in retinoic acid metabolism, and functionally, we validated napabucasin-mediated activation of the retinoic acid pathway in zebrafish in vivo. We conclude that TPP profiling in whole zebrafish embryo lysate is feasible and facilitates direct correlation of in vivo effects of small molecule drugs with their protein targets.","Leijten, Niels M; Bakker, Petra; Spaink, Herman P; den Hertog, Jeroen; Lemeer, Simone",Mol Cell Proteomics,197,16

METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on people with HIV at a referral clinic (Clinica Familiar Luis Angel García, CFLAG), as well as the disruption of services at a diagnostic laboratory hub (DLH) which provides diagnosis for opportunistic infections to a network of 13 HIV healthcare facilities. Comparative analysis was undertaken using the months March-August from two different time periods: (i) pre-COVID-19 (2017-2019); and (ii) during the COVID-19 period (2020). RESULTS: During the COVID-19 period, 7360 HIV tests were performed at Clinica Familiar Luis Angel García, compared with an average of 16,218 tests in the pre-COVID-19 period; a reduction of 54.7% [95% confidence interval (CI) 53.8-55.4%],Deaths from opportunistic infections at 90 days were 10.7% higher in 2020 compared with 2019 (27.3% vs 16.6%; P = 0.05).

Conditions used for cell isolation and expansion should meet strict quality and safety requirements. This is particularly true for the growth medium used for MSC isolation and expansion. Basal growth media used for MSC expansion are supplemented with multiple nutrients and growth factors. Fetal bovine serum (FBS) has long been the gold standard medium supplement for laboratory-scale MSC culture. However, FBS has a poorly characterized composition and poses risk factors, as it may be a source of xenogenic antigens and zoonotic infections. FBS has therefore become undesirable as a growth medium supplement for isolating and expanding MSCs for human therapy protocols. In recent years, human blood materials, and most particularly lysates and releasates of platelet concentrates have emerged as efficient medium supplements for isolating and expanding MSCs from various origins. This review analyzes the advantages and limits of using human platelet materials as medium supplements for MSC isolation and expansion. We present the modes of production of allogeneic and autologous platelet concentrates, measures taken to ensure optimal pathogen safety profiles, and methods of preparing PLs for MSC expansion. We also discuss the supply of such blood preparations.

There is increasing evidence that a combination of inflammation and hypercoagulable state are the main mechanisms of respiratory failure in these patients. This narrative review aims to summarize currently available evidence on the complex interplay of immune dysregulation, hypercoagulability, and thrombosis in the pathogenesis of respiratory failure in COVID-19 disease. In addition, we will describe the experience of anticoagulation and anti-inflammatory strategies that have been tested. Profound suppression of the adaptive and hyperactivity of innate immune systems with macrophage activation appears to be a prominent feature in this infection. Immune dysregulation together with endotheliitis and severe hypercoagulability results in thromboinflammation and microvascular thrombosis in the pulmonary vasculature leading to severe respiratory distress. Currently, some guidelines recommend the use of prophylactic low molecular weight heparin in all hospitalized patients, with intermediate dose prophylaxis in those needing intensive care, and the use of therapeutic anticoagulation in patients with proven or suspected thrombosis. Strong recommendations cannot be made until this approach is validated by trial results. To target the inflammatory cascade, low-dose dexamethasone appears to be helpful in moderate to severe cases and trials with anti-interleukin agents (e.g., tocilizumab, anakinra, siltuximab) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are showing early promising results. Potential newer agents (e.g., Janus kinase inhibitor such as ruxolitinib, baricitinib, fedratinib) are likely to be investigated in clinical trials. Unfortunately, current trials are mostly examining these agents in isolation and there may be a significant delay before evidence-based practice can be implemented. It is plausible that a combination of anti-viral drugs together with anti-inflammatory and anti-coagulation medicines will be the most successful strategy in managing severely affected patients with COVID-19.","Bhattacharyya, Rajat; Iyer, Prasad; Phua, Ghee Chee; Lee, Jan Hau",Pulm Ther,197,1

The virus causes severe and often lethal respiratory illness in humans with an unusually high fatality rate. The N-terminal domain (NTD) of receptor-binding S1 subunit of coronavirus spike (S) proteins can recognize a variety of host protein and mediates entry into human host cells. Blocking the entry by targeting the S1-NTD of the virus can facilitate the development of effective antiviral drug candidates against the pathogen. Therefore, the study has been designed to identify effective antiviral drug candidates against the MERS-CoV by targeting S1-NTD. Initially, a structure-based pharmacophore model (SBPM) to the active site (AS) cavity of the S1-NTD has been generated, followed by pharmacophore-based virtual screening of 11,295 natural compounds. Hits generated through the pharmacophore-based virtual screening have re-ranked by molecular docking and further evaluated through the ADMET properties. The compounds with the best ADME and toxicity properties have been retrieved, and a quantum mechanical (QM) based density-functional theory (DFT) has been performed to optimize the geometry of the selected compounds. Three optimized natural compounds, namely Taiwanhomoflavone B (Amb23604132), 2,3-Dihydrohinokiflavone (Amb23604659), and Sophoricoside (Amb1153724), have exhibited substantial docking energy >−9.00 kcal/mol, where analysis of frontier molecular orbital (FMO) theory found the low chemical reactivity correspondence to the bioactivity of the compounds. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation confirmed the stability of the selected natural compound to the binding site of the protein. Additionally, molecular mechanics generalized born surface area (MM/GBSA) predicted the good value of binding free energies (ΔG bind) of the compounds to the desired protein.

There are also concerns that the pandemic has affected supply and demand of acute cardiovascular care. We estimated excess mortality in specific CVDs, both ‘direct’, through infection, and ‘indirect’, through changes in healthcare. METHODS AND RESULTS: We used (i) national mortality data for England and Wales to investigate trends in non-COVID-19 and CVD excess deaths; (ii) routine data from hospitals in England (n = 2), Italy (n = 1), and China (n = 5) to assess indirect pandemic effects on referral, diagnosis, and treatment services for CVD; and (iii) population-based electronic health records from 3 862 012 individuals in England to investigate pre- and post-COVID-19 mortality for people with incident and prevalent CVD. We incorporated pre-COVID-19 risk (by age, sex, and comorbidities), estimated population COVID-19 prevalence, and estimated relative risk (RR) of mortality in those with CVD and COVID-19 compared with CVD and non-infected (RR: 1.2, 1.5, 2.0, and 3.0). Mortality data suggest indirect effects on CVD will be delayed rather than contemporaneous (peak RR 1.14). CVD service activity decreased by 60–100% compared with pre-pandemic levels in eight hospitals across China, Italy, and England. In China, activity remained below pre-COVID-19 levels for 2–3 months even after easing lockdown and is still reduced in Italy and England. For total CVD (incident and prevalent), at 10% COVID-19 prevalence, we estimated direct impact of 31 205 and 62 410 excess deaths in England (RR 1.5 and 2.0, respectively), and indirect effect of 49 932 to 99 865 deaths.

Transmission by cornea transplant has not been reported but is theoretically possible. We aimed to estimate the possible risk of transmission in Canada via cornea transplant during the first wave of the pandemic, and the potential risk reduction from testing decedents. We constructed a deterministic model in which the risk of transmission was estimated as the product of three proportions: decedents with SARS-CoV-2 infection, corneas that are NAT positive, and NAT positive corneas presumed to transmit. Risk was estimated according to 3 scenarios: most likely, optimistic and pessimistic. At the peak of the first wave of the pandemic risk was estimated to be 1 in 63,031 cornea transplants in Canada but could be as low as 1 in 175,821 or as high as 1 in 10,129. It would take 16 years at the peak infection of the first wave of the pandemic to observe 1 transmission. Testing would reduce the risk of 1 in 63,031 to 1 in 210,104 assuming 70% test sensitivity.

During transmission, host cell invasion is controlled by a large-scale (200–300 Å) conformational change of the Spike protein. This conformational rearrangement leads to membrane fusion, which creates transmembrane pores through which the viral genome is passed to the host. During Spike-protein-mediated fusion, the fusion peptides must be released from the core of the protein and associate with the host membrane. While infection relies on this transition between the prefusion and postfusion conformations, there has yet to be a biophysical characterization reported for this rearrangement. That is, structures are available for the endpoints, though the intermediate conformational processes have not been described. Interestingly, the Spike protein possesses many post-translational modifications, in the form of branched glycans that flank the surface of the assembly. With the current lack of data on the pre-to-post transition, the precise role of glycans during cell invasion has also remained unclear. To provide an initial mechanistic description of the pre-to-post rearrangement, an all-atom model with simplified energetics was used to perform thousands of simulations in which the protein transitions between the prefusion and postfusion conformations. These simulations indicate that the steric composition of the glycans can induce a pause during the Spike protein conformational change. We additionally show that this glycan-induced delay provides a critical opportunity for the fusion peptides to capture the host cell. In contrast, in the absence of glycans, the viral particle would likely fail to enter the host. This analysis reveals how the glycosylation state can regulate infectivity, while providing a much-needed structural framework for studying the dynamics of this pervasive pathogen.","Dodero-Rojas, Esteban; Onuchic, Jose N; Whitford, Paul Charles",eLife (Cambridge),197,5

If the source of infection can be effectively controlled in the early stages of an outbreak, the spread of infectious diseases can be prevented. In view of this situation, this study developed for infectious or suspected infectious patients a negative pressure isolation hood which effectively achieves direct individual isolation during the early stages of disease outbreak, and facilitates long-distance transport. The hood body is made of flexible transparent polyvinyl chloride (PVC) material, and the combination of the hood material is airtight. The unique inflatable column support structure and the design of the inflatable neck sleeve effectively ensure both stiffness and air tightness of the hood body. The electrical exhaust system maintains a stable negative pressure environment inside the hood, and polluted air inside the hood can be purified by a high efficiency filter. Test results showed that the internal noise of the hood was 68 ± 1 dB (A), the air exhaust volume of the electric exhaust system was not <200 L/min, and the filtration efficiency of the filter to 0.3 μm particles was >99.99%, indicating that the hood achieved effective isolation protection for patients with respiration infectious diseases.","Hao, Limei; Wu, Jinhui; Zhang, Jinming; Liu, Zhangyi; Yi, Ying; Zhang, Zongxing; Zhang, Enlei; Qi, Jiancheng",Biosafety and Health,197,8

As labeling COVID-19 CT scans is labor-intensive and time-consuming, it is essential to develop a segmentation method based on limited labeled data to conduct this task. In this paper, we propose a self-ensembled co-training framework, which is trained by limited labeled data and large-scale unlabeled data, to automatically extract COVID lesions from CT scans. Specifically, to enrich the diversity of unsupervised information, we build a co-training framework consisting of two collaborative models, in which the two models teach each other during training by using their respective predicted pseudo-labels of unlabeled data. Moreover, to alleviate the adverse impacts of noisy pseudo-labels for each model, we propose a self-ensembling strategy to perform consistency regularization for the up-to-date predictions of unlabeled data, in which the predictions of unlabeled data are gradually ensemble via moving average at the end of every training epoch. We evaluate our framework on a COVID-19 dataset containing 103 CT scans.

Forty-two point sixty-two percent (42.62%) of the participants reported an increase in RA practices in their clinical anesthesia applications, whereas 57.38% did not state any change. Neuraxial anesthesia was determined to be the most preferred RA application, with a rate of 74%. The distribution of peripheral nerve blocks (PNBs) showed that upper extremity blocks were used at a rate of 64.9%, lower extremity blocks at 30.38%, and trunk blocks at 15%. Investigation of neurostimulator (NS) and/or ultrasound (US) use with PNB showed that 44% of the participants used only US while 50% used both US and NS. Conclusion Neuraxial blocks play an important role in RA applications. PNB comprise one-quarter of RA applications during the pandemic. The importance of ultrasound has gradually increased in RA applications worldwide, as well as in Turkey, during the pandemic.","Cesur, Sevim; Aksu, Can; Kuş, Alparslan",Cureus,197,1

Coalescence of a second wave of this virus with seasonal respiratory viruses, particularly influenza virus is a possible global health concern. To investigate this, transgenic mice expressing the human ACE2 receptor driven by the epithelial cell cytokeratin-18 gene promoter (K18-hACE2) were first infected with IAV followed by SARS-CoV-2. The host response and effect on virus biology was compared to K18-hACE2 mice infected with IAV or SARS-CoV-2 only. Infection of mice with each individual virus resulted in a disease phenotype compared to control mice. Although SARS-CoV-2 RNA synthesis appeared significantly reduced in the sequentially infected mice, these mice had a more rapid weight loss, more severe lung damage and a prolongation of the innate response compared to singly infected or control mice. The sequential infection also exacerbated the extrapulmonary manifestations associated with SARS-CoV-2. This included a more severe encephalitis. Taken together, the data suggest that the concept of ‘twinfection’ is deleterious and mitigation steps should be instituted as part of a comprehensive public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Clark, Jordan J.; Penrice-Randal, Rebekah; Sharma, Parul; Kipar, Anja; Dong, Xiaofeng; Pennington, Shaun H.; Marriott, Amy E.; Colombo, Stefano; Davidson, Andrew; Williamson, Maia Kavanagh; Matthews, David A.; Turtle, Lance; Prince, Tessa; Hughes, Grant L.; Patterson, Edward I.; Shawli, Ghada; Subramaniam, Krishanthi; Sharp, Jo; McLaughlin, Lynn; Zhou, En-Min; Turner, Joseph D.; Biagini, Giancarlo; Owen, Andrew; Hiscox, Julian A.; Stewart, James P.",bioRxiv,197,20

After binding to their specific receptor on the cell surface, viruses (or viral genomes) have to enter cells to initiate a productive infection. Though the entry processes of many enveloped viruses is well understood, that of most non-enveloped viruses still remains unresolved. Recent studies have shown that compared to direct fusion at the plasma membrane, endocytosis is more often the preferred means of entry into the target cell. Receptor-mediated endocytic pathways such as the dynamin-dependent clathrin and caveolar pathways are well characterized as viral entry portals. However, many viruses are able to utilize multiple uptake pathways. Fluid phase uptake, though relatively non-specific in terms of its cargo, potentially aids viral infection by its ability to intersect with the endocytic pathway. In fact, many viruses despite using specialized pathways for entry are still able to generate productive infection via fluid phase uptake. Macropinocytosis, a major fluid uptake pathway found in epithelial cells and fibroblasts, is stimulated by growth factor receptors. Many viruses can induce these signaling cascades in cells leading to macropinocytosis. Though endocytic trafficking is utilized by both enveloped and non-enveloped viruses, key differences lie in the way membranes are traversed to deposit the viral genome at its site of replication. This review will discuss recent developments in the rapidly evolving field of viral entry.","Kalia, Manjula; Jameel, Shahid",Amino Acids,197,20

We retrospectively analyzed non-traumatic OHCA survivors treated with TTM. The primary outcome was poor neurological outcome at 3 months after return of spontaneous circulation (cerebral performance category, 3–5). We compared neurological prognostic performance using existing models after adding objective data obtained before TTM from computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and biomarkers to replace the no-flow time component of the OHCA and CAHP models. Among 106 patients, 61 (57.5%) had poor neurologic outcomes. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve for the OHCA and CAHP models was 0.89 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81–0.94) and 0.90 (95% CI 0.82–0.95), respectively. The prediction of poor neurological outcome improved after replacing no-flow time with a grey/white matter ratio measured using CT, high-signal intensity (HSI) on diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI), percentage of voxel using apparent diffusion coefficient value, and serum neuron-specific enolase levels. When replaced with HSI on DWI, the AUROC and sensitivity of the OHCA and CAHP models were 0.96 and 74.5% and 0.97 and 83.8%, respectively (100% specificity). Prognoses concerning neurologic outcomes improved compared with existing OHCA and CAHP models by adding new objective variables to replace no-flow time.

By adopting a pseudoknot structure in the presence of the ribosome, the PFSE promotes a ribosomal frameshifting event near the stop codon of the first open reading frame Orf1a during translation of the polyprotein pp1a. Frameshifting results in continuation of pp1a via a new open reading frame, Orf1b, that produces the longer pp1ab polyprotein. Polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab produce nonstructural proteins NSPs 1–10 and NSPs 1–16, respectively, which contribute vital functions during the viral life cycle and must be present in the proper stoichiometry. Both drugs and sequence alterations that affect the stability of the −1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting element disrupt the stoichiometry of the NSPs produced, which compromise viral replication. For this reason, the −1 programmed frameshifting element is considered a promising drug target. Using chaperone assisted RNA crystallography, we successfully crystallized and solved the three-dimensional structure of the PFSE. We observe a three-stem H-type pseudoknot structure with the three stems stacked in a vertical orientation stabilized by two triple base pairs at the stem 1/stem 2 and stem 1/stem 3 junctions. This structure provides a new conformation of PFSE distinct from the bent conformations inferred from midresolution cryo-EM models and provides a high-resolution framework for mechanistic investigations and structure-based drug design.","Roman, Christina; Lewicka, Anna; Koirala, Deepak; Li, Nan-Sheng; Piccirilli, Joseph A.",ACS Chem Biol,197,1

Fecal changes are frequent and can be signs of infection by digestive pathogens (bacteria, viruses, parasites) and indicators of nutritional and environmental stress. The aim of this study was to define a pathological fecal score for weaning puppies, and to study the impact on that score of two intestinal viruses (canine parvovirus type 2 and canine coronavirus). For this, the quality of stools was evaluated on 154 puppies between 4 and 8 weeks of age (100 from small breeds and 54 from large breeds). The scoring was performed immediately after a spontaneous defecation based on a 13-point scale (from 1; liquid to 13; dry and hard feces). Fecal samples were frozen for further viral analysis. Each puppy was weighed once a week during the study period. The fecal score regarded as pathological was the highest score associated with a significant reduction in average daily gain (ADG). Fecal samples were checked by semi-quantitative PCR or RT-PCR for canine parvovirus type 2 and canine coronavirus identification, respectively. The quality of feces was affected by both age and breed size. In small breeds, the ADG was significantly reduced under a fecal score of 6 and 7 for puppies at 4–5 and 6–8 weeks of age, respectively. In large breeds, the ADG was significantly reduced under a fecal score of 5 whatever the age of the puppy. Whereas a high viral load of canine parvovirus type 2 significantly impacted feces quality, no effect was recorded for canine coronavirus. This study provides an objective threshold for evaluation of fecal quality in weaning puppies. It also emphasizes the importance to be given to age and breed size in that evaluation.","Grellet, Aurélien; Feugier, Alexandre; Chastant-Maillard, Sylvie; Carrez, Bruno; Boucraut-Baralon, Corine; Casseleux, Gregory; Grandjean, Dominique",Prev Vet Med,197,1

No mutations in genes encoding NCT, or PEN-2 have been identified to date that cause AD.

In order to confirm the findings that rs117618017 is associated with risk of AD, we performed a genetic screen from deep whole genome sequencing of the large NIMH family-based Alzheimer's Disease (AD) dataset. In parallel, we sought to uncover potential molecular mechanism(s) by which APH-1B T27I might be associated with AD by generating stable HEK293 cell lines, wherein endogenous APH-1A and APH-1B expression was silenced and into which either the wild type APH-1B or the APH-1B T27I variant was stably expressed.

Tailored patient education is recommended as an important aspect of AF care. Current guidelines emphasize that patients become more active participants in the management of their own disease, yet there are no rehabilitation programs for patients with AF in the Danish health care system. Through participatory design, we developed the Future Patient Telerehabilitation (TR) Programs, A and B, for patients with AF. The 2 programs are based on HeartPortal and remote monitoring, together with educational modules. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this pilot study is to evaluate and compare the feasibility of the 2 programs of TR for patients with AF. METHODS: This pilot study was conducted between December 2019 and March 2020. The pilot study consisted of testing the 2 TR programs, A and B, in two phases: (1) treatment at the AF clinic and (2) TR at home. The primary outcome of the study was the usability of technologies for self-monitoring and the context of the TR programs as seen from patients’ perspectives. Secondary outcomes were the development of patients’ knowledge of AF, development of clinical data, and understanding the expectations and experiences of patients and spouses. Data were collected through interviews, questionnaires, and clinical measurements from home monitoring devices. Statistical analyses were performed using the IBM SPSS Statistics version 26. Qualitative data were analyzed using NVivo 12.0. RESULTS: Through interviews, patients articulated the following themes about participating in a TR program: usefulness of the HeartPortal, feeling more secure living with AF, community of practice living with AF, and measuring heart rhythm makes good sense. Through interviews, the spouses of patients with AF expressed that they had gained increased knowledge about AF and how to support their spouses living with AF in everyday life. Results from the responses to the Jessa AF Knowledge Questionnaire support the qualitative data, as they showed that patients in program B acquired increased knowledge about AF at follow-up compared with baseline. No significant differences were found in the number of electrocardiography recordings between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with AF and their spouses were positive about the TR program and they found the TR program useful, especially because it created an increased sense of security, knowledge about mastering their symptoms, and a community of practice linking patients with AF and their spouses and health care personnel. To assess all the benefits of the Future Patient–TR Program for patients with AF, it needs to be tested in a comprehensive randomized controlled trial.

There was a significantly higher prevalence (p = 0.0002) of litters with diarrhea born to gilts compared with those born to multiparous sows. Of 113 nursing piglet fecal samples tested, 76.1% were RVC RNA positive.

To circumvent this, we generated RVC virus-like particles (VLPs) for Cowden (G1), RV0104 (G3) and RV0143 (G6) and used them as antigens in ELISA to detect swine RVC Abs in serum and milk from the sows. Using RVC-VLP Ab ELISA we demonstrated that sows with diarrheic litters had significantly lower RVC IgA and IgG Ab titers in milk compared to those with healthy litters.

Some consequences are sleep deprivation, chronic insomnia, stress-related sleep disorders, and post-traumatic stress disorder. These sleep alterations critically affect mental health, precipitating or perpetuating anxiety, stress, and depression, resulting in the inability to regulate positive and negative emotions. Pre-existing sleep disorders are an important risk factor for the development and maintenance of PSTD when individuals are exposed to an important stressor such as a COVID-19 pandemic. At the same time, how an individual regulates the emotion associated with worries during daytime functioning impacts nighttime sleep, precipitating and perpetuating difficulties in sleeping. All of these changes in sleep and emotional regulation also alter the immune system. Sleep deprivation is commonly associated with chronic inflammatory diseases, due to the desynchronizations in circadian rhythms, causing possible psychophysiological disorders and impaired neuroimmune-endocrine homeostasis.

More patients with pneumonia associated with HBoV—respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) or human parainfluenza virus (HPIV) coinfections had wheezing than patients with RSV and HPIV infections alone (9 [53%] of 17 vs. 32 [23%] of 138]; P = .01). Conclusions. HBoV infection was epidemiologically associated with pneumonia among young children in rural Thailand, but infection and illness may be dependent on coinfection with other viruses.","Fry, Alicia M.; Lu, Xiaoyan; Chittaganpitch, Malinee; Peret, Teresa; Fischer, Julie; Dowell, Scott F.; Anderson, Larry J.; Erdman, Dean; Olsen, Sonja J.",J Infect Dis,197,17

Recombinant nucleocapsid polypeptide expressed in bacteria with a histidine tag at the amino terminus has been used as antigen for developing an assay to detect IBV-specific antibody. This fusion protein was produced readily in bacteria and easily purified with a nickel column which bound to the histidine tag. Conditions were optimized for using these preparations for an IBV-specific ELISA. Although differences in optical densities could be detected between pre-immune and positive sera for the Ark, Mass, and Gray strains with antigen concentrations between 50 and 0.1 μg per well, the greatest differences could be detected with 3 and 1.5 μg of protein per well. Maximum differences in optical densities between pre-immune and positive sera were obtained using 2.4 μg per well of protein and sera diluted between 1:80 and 1:160. In addition, as little as 30 ng/dot of recombinant nucleocapsid consistently detected IBV-specific sera in immunoblot assays which have convenient field applications.","Ndifuna, Abdul; Waters, Anna K.; Zhou, Minglong; Collisson, Ellen W.",J Virol Methods,197,20

Therefore, this study aims to discuss and analyse the relation between weather parameters and the spread of Coronavirus disease (Covid-19) from the perspective of Bangladesh. METHODS: Correlation among weather parameters and infection and death rate were established using several graphical plots and wind rose diagrams, Kendall and Spearman correlation and appropriate discussion with relevancy and reference. Information presented in this study has been extracted from 1st April 2020 to 30th December 2020. RESULTS: Analyses show that with the decrease in temperature, infection rate increased significantly. Also, the number of infection increases as wind speed increases. As the absolute humidity rate of Bangladesh is almost constant; therefore, the authors are unable to predict any relation of absolute humidity with the number of infection. Further, the prediction for the number of infections based on the wind direction for the several regions of seven divisions in Bangladesh is vulnerable for the upcoming several months.

Personality traits are one of the factors that explain the diverse responses to stressful situations. This study aimed to investigate whether five-factor and maladaptive personality traits are associated with depressive and anxiety symptoms, suicide risk, self-reported COVID-19 symptoms, and preventive behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic, comprehensively. METHODS: We conducted an online survey among a representative sample of 1000 Koreans between May 8 to 13, 2020. Participants' five-factor and maladaptive personality traits were measured using the multidimensional personality inventory, the Bright and Dark Personality Inventory. COVID-19 symptoms, depressive and anxiety symptoms, suicide risk, and preventive behaviors were also measured. RESULTS: The results revealed that maladaptive personality traits (e.g., negative affectivity, detachment) had positive correlations with depressive and anxiety symptoms, suicide risk, and COVID-19 symptoms, and the five-factor personality traits (e.g., agreeableness, conscientiousness) had positive correlations with preventive behaviors. CONCLUSION: Our findings extend the current understanding of the relationship between five-factor and maladaptive personality traits and responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. Longitudinal follow-up should further investigate the influence of personality traits on an individual's response to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Han, Yeoul; Jang, Jihee; Cho, Eunsil; Choi, Kee-Hong",Pers Individ Dif,197,8

In the present work, extracts of propolis from Bihor Romanian County were studied to identify the relationship between the polyphenolic derivatives profile and their antioxidant and antimicrobial activity. Extracts were obtained using water and 25%, 50%, and 70% ethanolic solutions (w/w), at 2:1, 4:1, and 6:1 liquid: solid ratios (w/w). 21 polyphenolic derivatives were quantified by UHPLC-MS, proving that the extracts composition strongly depends on the solvent. The sum of quantified polyphenolics extracted varied between 1.5 and 91.2 mg/g propolis. The antioxidant capacity was evaluated using the free radicals 2,2’-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6 sulfonic acid) diammonium salt (ABTS) and 1-diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging methods. Antimicrobial efficiency was tested against Gram-positive (B. subtilis), Gram-negative bacteria (E. coli), and fungi (C. albicans) by disc-diffusion method. All extracts, even the aqueous ones, demonstrated antibacterial and antifungal activity. Chemometric methods (partial least squares) and a saturation-type model were used to evaluate the contribution of various bioactive principles in building the antioxidant capacity of extracts. Both experimental and modelling results show that 50% ethanolic extracts provide a rich polyphenolics profile and ensure a good antioxidant capacity.","Nichitoi, Mădălina Maria; Josceanu, Ana Maria; Isopescu, Raluca Daniela; Isopencu, Gabriela Olimpia; Geana, Elisabeta-Irina; Ciucure, Corina Teodora; Lavric, Vasile",Sci Rep,197,20

This affected the worlds' social interactions, including within medical practices, thus interfering with routine treatments for a variety of diseases including cancer. Different studies have addressed the fact that patients with cancer are often immunocompromised, making them more susceptible to infections. Since COVID-19 frequently causes respiratory distress, patients with lung cancer are considered to be a high-risk group. Genes that have been indicated to mediate viral entry into host cells such as angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and transmembrane protease serine 2 are expressed in the lung tissue, a fact that could partially explain COVID-19 pathogenesis and lung involvement. Therefore, the current study offers a disease overview including molecular aspects behind the infection and provide a perspective on already published Chinese data plus recommendations for the management of lung cancer patients according to the two main lung cancer types and stages: non-small cell lung cancer and small cell lung cancer.

This study assessed the efficacy of perioperative management of patients scheduled for gastrointestinal surgery during COVID-19 pandemic of 2020. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 188 patients who underwent gastrointestinal surgery during the COVID-19 outbreak in Jiaxing, China. Perioperative data were collected, including data on pre-, intra-, and postoperative management strategies. The same data over the same period in 2019 were also collected for comparison. RESULTS: A total of 117, 63, and 8 patients underwent emergency, semi-elective, and elective surgeries, respectively. The locals: nonlocals ratio was significantly higher during this investigation period in 2020 than during the same period in 2019 (P < .05). After screening, 12 patients were identified as unqualified. The number of gastrointestinal surgeries was reduced in 2020. There were no differences in the ratio of emergency surgery or semi-elective surgery between in 2020 and in 2019. The elective surgery ratio between January 27 and February 28 was found to be lower in 2020 than in 2019 (P < .05). The disease spectra of emergency surgery and semi-elective surgery were similar. A total of 31 elective surgeries were postponed. There were five cases of short-term complications for emergency surgeries and two cases of short-term complications for semi-elective surgeries. No long-term complications or COVID-19 infection occurred in any of the cases, and no medical staff member was infected.

We aimed to explore the absolute and relative risk of severe COVID‐19 in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). METHODS: This population‐based cohort study used nationwide registers in Sweden, with 67,292 individuals with a diagnosis of IBD 1969–2017 (Crohn's disease, n = 21,599; ulcerative colitis: n = 43,622; IBD‐unclassified: n = 2071) and alive on 1 February 2020. Patients with IBD were matched to up to five controls from the general population (n = 297,910). Cox regression estimated hazard ratios (HRs) for (i) hospital admission with laboratory‐confirmed COVID‐19 as the primary diagnosis, and (ii) severe COVID‐19 (composite outcome consisting of (a) COVID‐19 intensive care admission, or (b) death from COVID‐19 or (c) death within 30 days of COVID‐19 hospital admission), were calculated. Analyses were conditioned on age, sex, calendar period, and county and adjusted for other comorbidities. RESULTS: Between 1 February and 31 July 2020, 179 (0.27%) IBD patients and 500 (0.17%) general population controls were admitted to hospital with COVID‐19 (adjusted HR [aHR] = 1.43; 95% CI = 1.19–1.72). The corresponding numbers for severe COVID‐19 was 65 (0.10%) and 183 (0.06%; aHR = 1.11; 95% CI = 0.81–1.52). Adjusted HRs were similar in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. In a propensity score‐matched model taking comorbidity into account until 2016, the increased risk for COVID‐19 hospital admission remained (aHR = 1.32; 1.12–1.56), but there was no increased risk of severe COVID‐19 (aHR = 1.12; 0.85–1.47). CONCLUSIONS: While individuals with IBD were more likely to be admitted to hospital for COVID‐19 than the general population, the risk of severe COVID‐19 was not higher.","Ludvigsson, Jonas F.; Axelrad, Jordan; Halfvarson, Jonas; Khalili, Hamed; Larsson, Emma; Lochhead, Paul; Roelstraete, Bjorn; Simon, Tracey G.; Söderling, Jonas; Olén, Ola",United European Gastroenterol J,197,26

The CRISPR-Cas system learns from previous viral infections and integrates small pieces from phage genomes called spacers into the microbial genome. The resulting library of spacers collected in CRISPR arrays is then compared with the DNA of potential invaders. One of the most intriguing and least well understood questions about CRISPR-Cas systems is the distribution of spacers across the microbial population. Here, using empirical data, we show that the global distribution of spacer numbers in CRISPR arrays across multiple biomes worldwide typically exhibits scale-invariant power law behaviour, and the standard deviation is greater than the sample mean. We develop a mathematical model of spacer loss and acquisition dynamics which fits observed data from almost four thousand metagenomes well. In analogy to the classical ‘rich-get-richer’ mechanism of power law emergence, the rate of spacer acquisition is proportional to the CRISPR array size, which allows a small proportion of CRISPRs within the population to possess a significant number of spacers. Our study provides an alternative explanation for the rarity of all-resistant super microbes in nature and why proliferation of phages can be highly successful despite the effectiveness of CRISPR-Cas systems.","Pavlova, Yekaterina S.; Paez-Espino, David; Morozov, Andrew Yu.; Belalov, Ilya S.",PLoS Comput Biol,197,32

The lack of animal models that reproduce human-like lung disease, associated with the necrotic lung pathology, impairs studies of M. kansasii virulence and pathogenicity. In this study, we examined the ability of the C57BL/6 mice, intratracheally infected with highly virulent M. kansasii strains, to produce a chronic infection and necrotic lung pathology. As a first approach, we evaluated ten M. kansasii strains isolated from Brazilian patients with pulmonary disease and the reference strain M. kansasii ATCC 12478 for virulence-associated features in macrophages infected in vitro; five of these strains differing in virulence were selected for in vivo analysis. Highly virulent isolates induced progressive lung disease in mice, forming large encapsulated caseous granulomas in later stages (120–150 days post-infection), while the low-virulent strain was cleared from the lungs by day 40. Two strains demonstrated increased virulence, causing premature death in the infected animals. These data demonstrate that C57BL/6 mice are an excellent candidate to investigate the virulence of M. kansasii isolates. We observed considerable heterogeneity in the virulence profile of these strains, in which the presence of highly virulent strains allowed us to establish a clinically relevant animal model. Comparing public genomic data between Brazilian isolates and isolates from other geographic regions worldwide demonstrated that at least some of the highly pathogenic strains isolated in Brazil display remarkable genomic similarities with the ATCC strain 12478 isolated in the United States 70 years ago (less than 100 SNPs of difference), as well as with some recent European clinical isolates. These data suggest that few pathogenic clones have been widely spread within M. kansasii population around the world.","Mussi, Vinicius O.; Simão, Thatiana L. B.

Methods: This manufacturer-independent, prospective diagnostic accuracy study, compared professional anterior nasal (AN) and nasal mid-turbinate (NMT) sampling for a WHO-listed SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDT. A second group of participants collected a NMT sample themselves and underwent a professional nasopharyngeal swab for comparison. The reference standard was real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using combined oro-/nasopharyngeal sampling. Individuals with high suspicion of SARS-CoV-2 infection were tested. Sensitivity, specificity, and percent agreement were calculated. Self-sampling was observed without intervention. Feasibility was evaluated by observer and participant questionnaires. Results: Among 132 symptomatic adults, both professional AN- and NMT-sampling yielded a sensitivity of 86.1% (31/36 RT-PCR positives detected; 95%CI: 71.3-93.9) and a specificity of 100.0% (95%CI: 95.7-100). The positive percent agreement (PPA) was 100% (95%CI: 89.0-100). Among 96 additional adults, self NMT- and professional NP-sampling yielded an identical sensitivity of 91.2% (31/34; 95%CI 77.0-97.0). Specificity was 98.4% (95%CI: 91.4-99.9) with NMT- and 100.0% (95%CI: 94.2-100) with NP-sampling. The PPA was 96.8% (95%CI: 83.8-99.8). Most participants (85.3%) considered self-sampling as easy to perform. Conclusion: Professional AN- and NMT-sampling are of equivalent accuracy for an Ag-RDT in ambulatory symptomatic adults.

Methods: Data are extracted and analyzed from an open-access, online dataset that monitor, on a daily basis, media news about SARS-CoV-2 infections of students attending Italian schools. Results: As of October 5, 2020, a total of 1,350 cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections have been registered in the Italian territory schools (involving 1,059 students, 145 teachers, and 146 other school members), for a total of 1,212 out of 65,104 (1.8%) Italian schools involved.

The detection of one or more SARS-CoV-2 infections led to the closure of 192 (15.8%) entire schools, more frequently nursery/kindergartens (P < 0.0005). Discussion: Our preliminary data support low transmission of SARS-CoV-2 within schools, at least among younger students. However, entire schools are frequently closed in the fear of larger outbreaks.

Concerns have been raised with the use of carbon dioxide as a euthanasia agent due to behavioral responses that indicate potential distress. This study was designed to assess aversive responses in experimentally naïve Sprague–Dawley rats when exposed to isoflurane or carbon dioxide. When placed in the forced exposure apparatus, these naïve rats were more active in the isoflurane and CO(2) treatments compared to the control groups, suggesting that isoflurane and CO(2) are similarly aversive. The results from the aversion-avoidance experiment supported previous work which demonstrated that while CO(2) is more aversive than isoflurane on initial exposure, rats showed increased aversion when the isoflurane exposure was repeated. We also show that learned aversion to isoflurane is sustained for at least 15 days after initial exposure. Given this result, we suggest that CO(2) is superior to isoflurane when euthanizing rodents with prior exposure to isoflurane. Overall, these results confirm previous studies which suggest that care should be taken when considering the serial use of isoflurane as an anesthetic. ABSTRACT: Euthanasia in rodents is an ongoing topic of debate due to concerns regarding the aversive nature of gases with anesthetic properties such as carbon dioxide (CO(2)) and isoflurane. The aim of this study was to expand upon previously published work evaluating the aversiveness of CO(2) by introducing an isoflurane treatment group in parallel. Aversion was tested using a forced exposure setup and an aversion-avoidance setup. In the first part of the study, 12 naïve female Sprague–Dawley rats were exposed during four consecutive days, once to each of four treatments: isoflurane, fox urine, oxygen, and CO(2). In the second part of the study, 24 naïve female Sprague–Dawley rats and 12 rats from the first experiment were exposed to CO(2), isoflurane, or both gases. In the forced exposure study, there were no significant differences between CO(2) and isoflurane treatments except in line crosses. Overall, rats were more active in the isoflurane and CO(2) treatments compared to the control groups, suggesting that isoflurane and CO(2) are similarly aversive. In the aversion-avoidance study, rats previously exposed to isoflurane left the dark chamber significantly earlier compared to naïve rats during exposure to isoflurane. We also show that learned aversion to isoflurane is sustained for at least 15 days after initial exposure. Given this result, we suggest that CO(2) is superior to isoflurane when euthanizing rodents with prior exposure to isoflurane. Overall, these results confirm previous studies which suggest that care should be taken when considering the serial use of isoflurane as an anesthetic.","Kulkarni, Satyajit; Hickman, Debra",Animals (Basel),197,20

Genetic services delivery, particularly in medically underserved populations, may rely heavily on primary care providers (PCPs). This study aims to identify barriers to integrating genetic services and primary care, and strategies to support integration, by conducting a scoping review. Literature synthesis found barriers most frequently cited by PCPs including insufficient knowledge about genetics and risk assessment, lack of access to geneticists, and insufficient time to address these challenges. Telegenetics, patient-centered care, and learning communities are strategies to overcome these barriers. Telegenetics supplements face-to-face clinics by providing remote access to genetic services. It may also be used for physician consultations and education. Patient-centered care allows providers, families, and patients to coordinate services and resources. Access to expert information provides a critical resource for PCPs. Learning communities may represent a mechanism that facilitates information exchange and knowledge sharing among different providers. As PCPs often play a crucial role caring for patients with genetic disorders in underserved areas, barriers to primary care-medical genetics integration must be addressed to improve access. Strategies, such as telegenetics, promotion of evidence-based guidelines, point-of-care risk assessment tools, tailored education in genetics-related topics, and other system-level strategies, will facilitate better genetics and primary care integration, which in turn, may improve genetic service delivery to patients residing in underserved communities.","Chou, Ann F.; Duncan, Ashten R.; Hallford, Gene; Kelley, David M.; Dean, Lori Williamson",J Community Genet,197,26

Despite the critical need for shared approaches, collaborative benchmarks in the International Health Regulations (IHR) Monitoring and Evaluation Framework and more specifically the Joint External Evaluation (JEE) often reveal low levels of performance in collaborative technical areas (TAs), thus identifying a real need to work on the human–animal–environment interface to improve health security. The National Bridging Workshops (NBWs) proposed jointly by the World Organisation of Animal Health and World Health Organization (WHO) provide opportunity for national human health, animal health, environment and other relevant sectors in countries to explore the efficiency and gaps in their coordination for the management of zoonotic diseases. The results, gathered in a prioritised roadmap, support the operationalisation of the recommendations made during JEE for TAs where a multisectoral One Health approach is beneficial. For those collaborative TAs (12 out of 19 in the JEE), more than two-thirds of the recommendations can be implemented through one or multiple activities jointly agreed during NBW. Interestingly, when associated with the WHO Benchmark Tool for IHR, it appears that NBW activities are often associated with lower level of performance than anticipated during the JEE missions, revealing that countries often overestimate their capacities at the human–animal–environment interface.

Mucormycosis predominantly affects immunocompromised individuals such as people with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, blood malignancies, organ transplant, etc. Involvement of the kidneys usually occurs as a result of disseminated mucormycosis. We report a very rare case of isolated renal mucormycosis in an immunocompetant individual without any prior comorbidities who had an unusual presentation of mucormycosis. CASE PRESENTATION: A 17-year-old male student had presented to our emergency department with complaints of bilateral loin pain and fever for 10 days. There was no urine output for 2 days. Patient was in sepsis with acute kidney injury. A Doppler ultrasound of the abdomen revealed bilateral enlarged kidneys with absent blood flow in the renal vasculature. Dialysis was done, and patient was started on intravenous antibiotics. Patient was investigated for thrombophilia, the test results of which were normal. Sickle cell test was negative. Immunodeficiency screening was negative. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed bilateral enlarged kidneys with bilateral renal artery thrombosis and mild ascitis. CT-guided renal biopsy was performed in the same sitting which revealed fungal hyphae in the background of necrotic glomeruli. Patient was started on liposomal amphotericin B with renal replacement therapy. However, patient deteriorated and succumbed to sepsis on the 4th day of admission. CONCLUSION: Isolated renal mucormycosis with bilateral renal artery thrombosis is a very rare clinical scenario with high mortality. One must have a high degree of suspicion to diagnose renal mucormycosis at an early stage.","Saneesh, P. S.; Yelamanchi, Raghav; Pilllai, Shalini",Afr J Urol,197,9

Quarantine measures during Chinese New Year effectively alleviated the spread of the epidemic, but they simultaneously resulted in a decline in anthropogenic emissions from industry, transportation, and import and export of goods. Herein, we present the major chemical composition of non-refractory PM2.5 (NR-PM2.5) and the concentrations of gaseous pollutants in an urban site in Shanghai before and during the quarantine period of the COVID-19 epidemic, which was Jan. 8―23 and Jan. 24―Feb. 8, respectively. The observed results show that the reduction in PM2.5 can be mainly attributed to decreasing concentrations of nitrate and primary aerosols. Nitrate accounted for 37% of NR-PM2.5 before the quarantine period when there was no emission reduction. During the quarantine period, the nitrate concentration decreased by approximately 60%, which is attributed to a reduction in the NOx concentration. Ammonium, as the main balancing cation, showed an approximately 45% simultaneous decrease in concentration. The concentrations of chloride and hydrocarbon-like organic aerosols from primary emissions also declined due to limited human activities. By contrast, sulphate and oxygenated organic aerosols showed a slight decrease in concentration, with their contributions increasing to 27% and 18%, respectively, during the quarantine period, which resulted in two pollution episodes with PM2.5 exceeding 100 μg/m3. This study provides a better understanding of the impact of quarantine measures on variations of the PM2.5 concentration and chemical compositions. Atmospheric oxidation capacities based on the oxidant (Ox = O3 + NO2) and oxidation ratios have been discussed for elucidating the source and formation of haze in an environment with lower anthropogenic emissions. With increasing contribution of secondary aerosols, lower NOx and nitrate concentrations did not completely avoid haze in Shanghai during the epidemic.","Chen, Hui; Huo, Juntao; Fu, Qingyan; Duan, Yusen; Xiao, Hang; Chen, Jianmin",Sci Total Environ,197,10

METHODS: A bibliometric search was performed in PubMed(®), Scopus and Web of Science, focusing on meta-analyses about COVID-2019 disease. Bibliometric and descriptive data for the included articles were extracted and the methodological quality of the included meta-analyses was evaluated using A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews. RESULTS: A total of 348 meta-analyses were considered eligible. The first meta-analysis about COVID-19 disease was published on February 26, 2020, and the number of meta-analyses has grown rapidly since then. Most of them were published in infectious disease and virology journals. The greatest number come from China, followed by the United States, Italy and the United Kingdom. On average, these meta-analyses included 23 studies and 15,200 participants. Overall quality was remarkably low, and only 8.9% of them could be considered as of high confidence level. CONCLUSION: Although well-designed meta-analyses about COVID-19 disease have already been published, the majority are of low quality. Thus, all stakeholders playing a role in COVID-19 deseases, including policy makers, researchers, publishers and journals, should prioritize well-designed meta-analyses, performed only when the background information seem suitable, and discouraging those of low quality or that use suboptimal methods.","Pires, Gabriel Natan; Bezerra, Andréia Gomes; de Oliveira, Thainá Baenninger; Chen, Samuel Fen I; Malfatti, Victor Davis Apostolakis; de Mello, Victoria Feiner Ferreira; Niyama, Alyne; Pinto, Vitor Luiz Selva; Andersen, Monica Levy; Tufik, Sergio",Einstein,197,1

In this study, we test this proposition by examining the individual differences associated with the development of COVID-19-related CT beliefs during the pandemic. A total of 660 adults completed a survey that captured COVID–related CT beliefs and broader conspiracy beliefs, education, perceived stress and attitudes towards government responses. The results showed that COVID-19 related CT beliefs were: strongly related to broader CT beliefs, higher in those with lower levels of education; and, positively (although weakly) correlated with more negative attitudes towards government responses. However, no relationship was found between COVID-19 beliefs and self-reported stress. These findings hold implications for why some people are more likely to be resistant to public health interventions relating to COVID-19. The findings encourage more detailed exploration of the causes and sources of CTs and, in particular, the role of social media use and other information sources in the development and perpetuation of health-related CT beliefs.","Georgiou, Neophytos; Delfabbro, Paul; Balzan, Ryan",Pers Individ Dif,197,27

COVID-19 patients bear an elevated risk once the symptoms deteriorate. Hence, early recognition of diseased patients can facilitate early intervention and avoid disease succession. This article intends to develop a hybrid deep neural networks (HDNNs), using computed tomography (CT) and X-ray imaging, to predict the risk of the onset of disease in patients suffering from COVID-19. To be precise, the subjects were classified into 3 categories namely normal, Pneumonia, and COVID-19. Initially, the CT and chest X-ray images, denoted as ‘hybrid images’ (with resolution 1080 × 1080) were collected from different sources, including GitHub, COVID-19 radiography database, Kaggle, COVID-19 image data collection, and Actual Med COVID-19 Chest X-ray Dataset, which are open source and publicly available data repositories. The 80% hybrid images were used to train the hybrid deep neural network model and the remaining 20% were used for the testing purpose.

Specifically, the process provides daily lists of high-risk patients to all public hospitals for customized discharge procedures within 24 h of admission. We analyzed all public hospital admissions (N = 150,322) in a year. Among four models, the gradient boosting machine performed the best (AUC = 0.79) with a positive predictive value set at 70%. Interestingly, the cumulative length of stay (LOS) in the past 12 months was a stronger predictor than the number of previous admissions, as it is a better proxy for acute care utilization. Another important predictor was the “number of days from previous non-elective admission”, which is different from previous studies that included both elective and non-elective admissions. Of note, the model did not include LOS of the index admission—a key predictor in other models—since our predictive model identified frequent admitters for pre-discharge interventions during the index (current) admission. The scientific ingredients that built the model did not guarantee its successful implementation—an “art” that requires the alignment of processes, culture, human capital, and senior management sponsorship. Change management is paramount, otherwise data-driven health policies, no matter how well-intended, may not be accepted or implemented. Overall, our study demonstrated the viability of using artificial intelligence (AI) to build a near real-time nationwide prediction tool for individual-centric discharge, and the critical factors for successful implementation.","Ng, Reuben; Tan, Kelvin Bryan",Int J Environ Res Public Health,197,5

OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to characterize the presenting profile and outcomes of patients hospitalized with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and COVID‐19 infection. METHODS: This observational cohort study was conducted using multisource data from all acute NHS hospitals in England. All consecutive patients hospitalized with diagnosis of ACS with or without COVID‐19 infection between 1 March and 31 May 2020 were included. The primary outcome was in‐hospital and 30‐day mortality. RESULTS: A total of 12 958 patients were hospitalized with ACS during the study period, of which 517 (4.0%) were COVID‐19‐positive and were more likely to present with non‐ST‐elevation acute myocardial infarction. The COVID‐19 ACS group were generally older, Black Asian and Minority ethnicity, more comorbid and had unfavourable presenting clinical characteristics such as elevated cardiac troponin, pulmonary oedema, cardiogenic shock and poor left ventricular systolic function compared with the non‐COVID‐19 ACS group.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the role of viral infections, allergen sensitization, and exposure to indoor allergens as risk factors for acute wheezing in children 0 to 12 years old. METHODS: One hundred thirty-two children 0 to 12 years of age who sought emergency department care for wheezing and 65 children with no history of wheezing were enrolled in this case-control study. Detection of respiratory syncytial virus antigen, rhinovirus and coronavirus RNA, adenovirus, influenza, and parainfluenza antigens was performed in nasal washes. Total IgE and specific IgE to mites, cockroach, cat, and dog were measured with the CAP system. Major allergens from mites, cockroach, cat, and dog were quantified in dust samples by ELISA. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed by logistic regression. RESULTS: In children under 2 years of age, infection with respiratory viruses and family history of allergy were independently associated with wheezing (odds ratio, 15.5 and 4.2; P = .0001 and P = .008, respectively). Among children 2 to 12 years old, sensitization to inhalant allergens was the major risk factor for wheezing (odds ratio, 2.7; P = .03). High-level allergen exposure, exposure to tobacco smoke, and lack of breast-feeding showed no association with wheezing.

In this study, we investigated the cell death processes during infection and the underlying mechanisms. We found that CCoV-II triggers apoptosis in A-72 cells by activating initiator (caspase-8 and -9) and executioner (caspase-3 and -6) caspases. The proteolytic cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs) confirmed the activation of executioner caspases. Furthermore, CCoV-II infection resulted in truncated bid (tbid) translocation from the cytosolic to the mitochondrial fraction, the cytochrome c release from mitochondria, and alterations in the pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins of bcl-2 family. Our data indicated that, in this experimental model, both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways are involved. In addition, we demonstrated that the inhibition of apoptosis by caspase inhibitors did not affect CCoV replication, suggesting that apoptosis does not play a role in facilitating viral release.","De Martino, Luisa; Marfé, Gabriella; Longo, Mariangela; Fiorito, Filomena; Montagnaro, Serena; Iovane, Valentina; Decaro, Nicola; Pagnini, Ugo",Vet Microbiol,197,1

In addition, the relationship between the clinical characteristics of patients and significant intervention scores was analyzed. We enrolled patients younger than 12 months who were diagnosed with ALTE from January 2005 to December 2012. There were 29 ALTE infants with a peak incidence of age younger than 1 month (48.3%). The most common symptoms for ALTE diagnosis were apnea (69.0%) and color change (58.6%). Eleven patients appeared normal upon arrival at hospital but 2 patients required cardiopulmonary resuscitation during the initial ALTE. The most common ALTE cause was respiratory disease, including respiratory infection and upper airway anomalies (44.8%). There were 20 cases of repeat ALTE and 2 cases of death during hospitalization. Four patients (15.4%) experienced recurrence of ALTE after discharge and 4 patients (15.4%) showed developmental abnormalities during the follow-up period. The patients with ALTE during sleep had lower significant intervention scores (P=0.015) compared to patients with ALTE during wakefulness and patients with previous respiratory symptoms had higher significant intervention scores (P=0.013) than those without previous respiratory symptoms. Although not statistically significant, there was a weak positive correlation between the patient's total ALTE criteria and total significant intervention score (Fig. 2, r=0.330, P=0.080).

Ivermectin has been shown to inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro but clinical response has not been previously evaluated. Objective: To determine whether Ivermectin is associated with lower mortality rate in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Design and Setting: Retrospective cohort study of consecutive patients hospitalized at four Broward Health hospitals in South Florida with confirmed SARS-CoV-2. Enrollment dates were March 15, 2020 through May 11, 2020. Follow up data for all outcomes was May 19, 2020. Participants: 280 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (mean age 59.6 years [standard deviation 17.9], 45.4% female), of whom 173 were treated with ivermectin and 107 were usual care were reviewed. 27 identified patients were not reviewed due to multiple admissions, lack of confirmed COVID results during hospitalization, age less than 18, pregnancy, or incarceration. Exposure: Patients were categorized into two treatment groups based on whether they received at least one dose of ivermectin at any time during the hospitalization. Treatment decisions were at the discretion of the treating physicians. Severe pulmonary involvement at study entry was characterized as need for either FiO2 [â¥]50%, or noninvasive or invasive mechanical ventilation. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was all-cause in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included subgroup mortality in patients with severe pulmonary involvement and extubation rates for patients requiring invasive ventilation. Results: Univariate analysis showed lower mortality in the ivermectin group (25.2% versus 15.0%, OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.29-0.96, P=.03). Mortality was also lower among 75 patients with severe pulmonary disease treated with ivermectin (38.8% vs 80.7%, OR 0.15, CI 0.05-0.47, P=.001), but there was no significant difference in successful extubation rates (36.1% vs 15.4%, OR 3.11 (0.88-11.00), p=.07). After adjustment for between-group differences and mortality risks, the mortality difference remained significant for the entire cohort (OR 0.27, CI 0.09-0.85, p=.03; HR 0.37, CI 0.19-0.71, p=.03). Conclusions and Relevance: Ivermectin was associated with lower mortality during treatment of COVID-19, especially in patients who required higher inspired oxygen or ventilatory support. These findings should be further evaluated with randomized controlled trials.","Rajter, Juliana Cepelowicz; Sherman, Michael; Fatteh, Naaz; Vogel, Fabio; Sacks, Jamie; Rajter, Jean-Jacques",,197,23

While pathologic features were described, there are limited data on the relationship of these changes to the inflammatory response and the production of thromboses. OBJECTIVE: To investigate pathology of COVID-19-related immunothrombosis. PATIENTS/METHODS: Tissue samples from lung, kidney, brain and heart that were collected from 45 patients who died of COVID-19. Histopathological examination was performed after H&E and Picro-Mallory staining in combination with (immuno)fluorescence to visualize neutrophil extracellular traps. Ultrastructural alterations in lungs were studied with scanning and transmission electron microscopy. RESULTS: Inflammatory changes and thrombosis were substantially more pronounced in the lung than in the kidney, heart, and brain. The most common pathologic finding was diffuse alveolar damage. In addition, most lung samples showed thrombi in vessels. The cause of death in single cases was massive pulmonary embolism. Ultrastructural examination revealed neutrophils attached to endothelium, perhaps as a step towards transendothelial migration. In addition, platelets were identified in the midst of fibrin as individual procoagulant balloon-like cells. Ultrastructural examination demonstrated numerous virion-like particles. CONCLUSIONS: Studying (ultra)structural features of the autopsy lung samples from patients with COVID-19 has provided evidence for a pathogenic link between inflammation and thrombosis. The major features in the lungs of COVID-19 patients comprised primary inflammatory thrombosis associated with diffuse alveolar damage.

Dado que las infecciones respiratorias virales no requieren tratamiento antiviral específico (salvo excepciones puntuales) sino tratamiento sintomático y/o de soporte, en este artículo nos referiremos al manejo de las infecciones respiratorias bacterianas: faringoamigdalitis estreptocócica, sinusitis aguda bacteriana, otitis media aguda bacteriana y neumonía bacteriana adquirida en la comunidad. En el manejo de la faringitis estreptocócica destaca el uso de amoxicilina en una dosis diaria por 10 días. En sinusitis aguda, otitis media aguda y neumonía, la recomendación de tratamiento inicial lo constituye la amoxicilina a dosis de 80–100mg/kg/día. Se discuten algoritmos de manejo para cada una de estas patologías. Summary Respiratory infections are the main cause of consultation and hospitalization in children. Because viral respiratory infections do not require specific antiviral treatment (only in occasional exceptions), in this article we will refer to the management of bacterial respiratory infections: streptococcal pharyngitis, acute bacterial sinusitis, bacterial otitis media and bacterial community-acquired pneumonia. In the treatment of streptococcal pharyngitis, the use of amoxicillin (50mg/kg/day) in a daily dose for 10 days is a new recommendation. In acute sinusitis, acute otitis media and community-acquired pneumonia, the recommended initial treatment is amoxicillin in a dose of 80 –100mg/kg/day. Management algorithms for each of these conditions are discussed.","Juan Pablo Torres, T.",Revista Médica Clínica Las Condes,197,26

Therefore, this cross‐sectional survey was conducted (Punjab, Pakistan) on healthy recovered, home quarantined COVID‐19 patients to draw conclusive health support guidelines in the fight against this pandemic. COVID‐19 recovered patients (n = 80) of age ≥14 years were randomly selected during the period November 2020 to February 2021. A nutrition and lifestyle changes questionnaire, containing ten sections and seventy questions, was completed through the telephone/WhatsApp. Data were transferred into an Excel spreadsheet and statistically analyzed by applying chi‐square, correlation, and a t test of independent values using SPSS‐16 software. The patients had an age range of 14 to 80 years, of which 52 (65%) were male and 28 (35%) were female, and 32 (40%) had a normal BMI. The patients had a peak COVID‐19 recovery period of 2 weeks, and a mean recovery period of 2.8 ± 1.4 weeks. Certain variables, including gender (males), age (>40 years), sleep (≤5 hr), less/no physical activity, obesity, diabetes mellitus, and autoimmune diseases, were significantly associated with delayed recovery. Poor nutritional outcomes, including lower intakes of water, legumes, nuts, meat, and milk/yogurt; and higher consumption of fast/fried/junk/spicy foods and cold water/drinks, were also significantly associated with a longer recovery period. The results were similar for not taking daily doses of multivitamins, and vitamins C, D, E, and zinc. This study identified that staying physically active, maintaining sensible body weight, having a sleep of 7 hr, consuming more foods of plant origin especially plant‐based proteins from nuts and legumes, taking supplemental doses of multivitamins, vitamin D, E, and zinc, along with drinking ≥2 L of water daily can provide a significant role in early and safe recovery from COVID‐19.","Rabail, Roshina; Saleem, Javeria; Tanveer, Zunera; Patching, Simon G.; Khalid, Abdur Rauf; Sultan, Muhammad Tauseef; Manzoor, Muhammad Faisal; Karrar, Emad; Inam‐Ur‐Raheem, Muhammad; Shabbir, Muhammad Asim; Aadil, Rana Muhammad",Food Sci Nutr,197,20

Proteases are central to the infection process of SARS‐CoV‐2. Cleavage of the spike protein on the virus's capsid causes the conformational change that leads to membrane fusion and viral entry into the target cell. Since inhibition of one protease, even the dominant protease like TMPRSS2, may not be sufficient to block SARS‐CoV‐2 entry into cells, other proteases that may play an activating role and hydrolyze the spike protein must be identified. We identified amino acid sequences in all regions of spike protein, including the S1/S2 region critical for activation and viral entry, that are susceptible to cleavage by furin and cathepsins B, K, L, S, and V using PACMANS, a computational platform that identifies and ranks preferred sites of proteolytic cleavage on substrates, and verified with molecular docking analysis and immunoblotting to determine if binding of these proteases can occur on the spike protein that were identified as possible cleavage sites. Together, this study highlights cathepsins B, K, L, S, and V for consideration in SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and presents methodologies by which other proteases can be screened to determine a role in viral entry. This highlights additional proteases to be considered in COVID‐19 studies, particularly regarding exacerbated damage in inflammatory preconditions where these proteases are generally upregulated.","Bollavaram, Keval; Leeman, Tiffanie H.; Lee, Maggie W.; Kulkarni, Akhil; Upshaw, Sophia G.; Yang, Jiabei; Song, Hannah; Platt, Manu O.",Protein Sci,197,26

Past work on professional learning networks (PLNs) has shown that teachers also use social media to find supports for their teaching and ongoing professional development. This paper offers quantitative analysis of over a half million Twitter #Edchat tweets as well as qualitative content analysis of teachers’ question tweets (n = 1054) and teacher interviews (n = 4). These data and analyses provide evidence of the kinds of supports that teachers in the United States and Canada sought on social media during the rapid transition to emergency remote teaching in Spring 2020 and how these supports informed teaching practices. These results provide insights into PLN theory and teachers’ social media use during times of disruption and crisis. PRACTITIONER NOTES: : Prior to the spring 2020 pandemic, teachers turned to social media to find supports for teaching and just‐in‐time professional development (PD). #Edchat, one of the oldest and most used educational hashtags on Twitter, supports education‐related conversations, frequently self‐promotional rather than collaborative. The COVID‐19 pandemic disrupted educational systems globally and created new demands on teacher PD during transitions to emergency remote teaching and learning. : Teachers’ professional learning networks (PLN) on social media can be flexible around contextual circumstances and users’ needs. #Edchat discourse can move beyond self‐promotion to inquiry with benefits for professional learning. Education‐related response networks on social media are useful to teachers in emergency situations (and beyond them) where just‐in‐time professional learning needs and questions surpass local PD capacity. : Teachers should increase capacities inquiring discourses on Twitter. Education stakeholders should increase support for teachers’ agency and advocate for broader conceptions and approaches to PD that incorporate PLNs spanning social media.","Greenhow, Christine; Staudt Willet, K.

In mid/late September 2019, a hepatitis E outbreak caused by HEV genotype 3 was recognized by detection of identical/highly similar HEV sequences in some hepatitis E cases from two Italian regions, Abruzzo and Lazio, with most cases from this latter region showing a link with Abruzzo. Overall, 47 cases of HEV infection were finally observed with onsets from 8 June 2019 to 6 December 2019; they represent a marked increase as compared with just a few cases in the same period of time in the past years and in the same areas. HEV sequencing was successful in 35 cases. The phylogenetic analysis of the viral sequences showed 30 of them grouped in three distinct molecular clusters, termed A, B, and C: strains in cluster A and B were of subtype 3e and strains in cluster C were of subtype 3f. No strains detected in Abruzzo in the past years clustered with the strains involved in the present outbreak. The outbreak curve showed partially overlapped temporal distribution of the three clusters. Analysis of collected epidemiological data identified pork products as the most likely source of the outbreak. Overall, the findings suggest that the outbreak might have been caused by newly and almost simultaneously introduced strains not previously circulating in this area, which are possibly harbored by pork products or live animals imported from outside Abruzzo. This possibility deserves further studies in this area in order to monitor the circulation of HEV in human cases as well as in pigs and wild boars.","Garbuglia, Anna Rosa; Bruni, Roberto; Villano, Umbertina; Vairo, Francesco; Lapa, Daniele; Madonna, Elisabetta; Picchi, Giovanna; Binda, Barbara; Mariani, Rinalda; De Paulis, Francesca; D'Amato, Stefania; Grimaldi, Alessandro; Scognamiglio, Paola; Capobianchi, Maria Rosaria; Ciccaglione, Anna Rita; The Other Members Of The Hev Outbreak Working Group,",Viruses,197,3

In contrast, the average Ct values that refer to the ORF1ab and N gene amplification were significantly different (p < 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively), with the lowest obtained by the TaqPath(TM) for the ORF1ab and by the Sansure Biotech for the N gene. The results show a high similarity in the analytical sensitivities for SARS-CoV-2 detection, which indicates that the diagnostic accuracy of the three assays is comparable. However, the SanSure Biotech kit showed a bit better diagnostic performance.

Using an orthopaedic elective surgery model, we aimed to answer the following: (1) What is the expected recovery time until the health-care system is back to nearly full capacity for performing elective surgery? (2) What will be the expected backlog of elective surgery over time? (3) How should health care change to address the backlog? METHODS: A Monte Carlo stochastic simulation-based analysis was performed to forecast the post-pandemic volume of elective, inpatient total joint arthroplasty and spinal fusion surgical cases. The cumulative backlog was calculated and analyzed. We tested model assumptions with sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Assuming that elective orthopaedic surgery resumes in June 2020, it will take 7, 12, and 16 months—in optimistic, ambivalent, and pessimistic scenarios, respectively—until the health-care system can perform 90% of the expected pre-pandemic forecasted volume of surgery. In the optimistic scenario, there will be a cumulative backlog of >1 million surgical cases at 2 years after the end of elective-surgery deferment. CONCLUSIONS: The deferment of elective surgical cases during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic will have a lasting impact on the United States health-care system.

METHODS: This retrospective study was undertaken at a tertiary care center. Eligible subjects included consecutive patients age 18 and over with documented SARS‐CoV‐2 infection between March and July 2020. The primary outcome measures were results of chest radiography and computed tomography among patients with documented SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. RESULTS: Among 724 subjects, most were admitted to a medical floor (46.4%; N = 324) or admitted to an ICU (10.9%; N = 76). A substantial number of subjects were intubated during the emergency department visit or inpatient hospitalization (15.3%; N = 109).

METHODS: We analyzed data from 19,458 members of Kaiser Permanente Northern California who were pregnant between January 2020 and April 2021 and responded to an online survey about COVID-19 testing, diagnosis, symptoms, and their experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic. Medical diagnosis of COVID-19 during pregnancy was defined separately by self-report and by documentation in electronic health records (EHR). We examined relationships of COVID-19 with sociodemographic factors, underlying comorbidities, and survey measures of COVID-19-like symptoms, consequent healthcare utilization, and possible COVID-19 exposures. RESULTS: Among 19,458 respondents, the crude prevalence of COVID-19 was 2.5% (n = 494) according to self-report and 1.4% (n = 276) according to EHR. After adjustment, the prevalence of self-reported COVID-19 was higher among women aged <25 years compared with women aged ≥35 years (prevalence ratio [PR], 1.75, 95% CI: 1.23, 2.49) and among Hispanic women compared with White women (PR, 1.91, 95% CI: 1.53, 2.37).

We report here a carbohydrate microarray analysis of a number of tumor-associated carbohydrates for their serum antibody reactivities and potential immunogenicity in humans. These are the precursors, cores and internal sequences of N-glycans. They are usually masked by other sugar moieties and belong to a class of glyco-antigens that are normally “cryptic”. However, viral expression of these carbohydrates may trigger host immune responses. For examples, HIV-1 and SARS-CoV display Man9 clusters and tri- or multi-antennary type II (Galβ1→4GlcNAc) chains (Tri/m-II), respectively; viral neutralizing antibodies often target these sugar moieties. We asked, therefore, whether prostate tumor expression of corresponding carbohydrates triggers antibody responses in vivo. Using carbohydrate microarrays, we analyzed a panel of human sera, including 17 samples from prostate cancer patients and 12 from men with Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH). We observed that IgG antibodies targeting the Man9- or Tri-/m-II-autoantigens are readily detectable in the sera of men with BPH, as well as those with cancer. Importantly, these antibody activities were selectively increased in prostate cancer patients. Thus, human immune systems actively recognize these N-glycan cryptic carbohydrates and produce targeting antibodies. This finding shads a light on a class of previously less studied immunological targets of human cancers. Identifying the diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic values of these targets will require further investigation.","Wang, Denong",J Proteomics Bioinform,197,16

In practice, when there are zero events in one or both groups, it may cause statistical problems in the subsequent analysis. METHODS: In this paper, by considering the relative risk as the effect size, we conduct a comparative study that consists of four continuity correction methods and another state-of-the-art method without the continuity correction, namely the generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs). To further advance the literature, we also introduce a new method of the continuity correction for estimating the relative risk. RESULTS: From the simulation studies, the new method performs well in terms of mean squared error when there are few studies. In contrast, the generalized linear mixed model performs the best when the number of studies is large. In addition, by reanalyzing recent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) data, it is evident that the double-zero-event studies impact the estimate of the mean effect size. CONCLUSIONS: We recommend the new method to handle the zero-event studies when there are few studies in a meta-analysis, or instead use the GLMM when the number of studies is large.

Conversely, SWATH-IP mass spectrometry of ectopically expressed SBP-tagged IFITM1 identified ISG15 and HLA-B as dominant co-associated proteins. ISG15ylation was attenuated in IFNγ treated IFITM1/IFITM3 double-null cells. Proximity ligation assays indicated that HLA-B can interact with IFITM1/3 proteins in parental SiHa cells.

The cumulative survival was 75.3% with the mean survival was 28.1, and 95.2% overall survival was recorded in those aged < 50 years. Conclusions Age older than 50 years old, those with pre-existing DM, initial qSOFA score, requirement for O2 therapy and NIV from the first day of hospital admission may be associated with unfavorable 30 days- in hospital outcome of COVID- 19.","Mohamed-Hussein, A.; Galal, I.; Mohamed, M.

Unless belonging to a family, pedestrians in shared spaces are asked to observe a minimal (country-dependent) pairwise distance. Coherently, managers of public spaces may be tasked with the enforcement or monitoring of this constraint. As privacy-respectful real-time tracking of pedestrian dynamics in public spaces is a growing reality, it is natural to leverage on these tools to analyze the adherence to physical distancing and compare the effectiveness of crowd management measurements. Typical questions are: “in which conditions non-family members infringed social distancing?”, “Are there repeated offenders?”, and “How are new crowd management measures performing?”. Notably, dealing with large crowds, e.g. in train stations, gets rapidly computationally challenging. In this work we have a two-fold aim: first, we propose an efficient and scalable analysis framework to process, offline or in real-time, pedestrian tracking data via a sparse graph. The framework tackles efficiently all the questions mentioned above, representing pedestrian-pedestrian interactions via vector-weighted graph connections. On this basis, we can disentangle distance offenders and family members in a privacy-compliant way. Second, we present a thorough analysis of mutual distances and exposure-times in a Dutch train platform, comparing pre-Covid and current data via physics observables as Radial Distribution Functions. The versatility and simplicity of this approach, developed to analyze crowd management measures in public transport facilities, enable to tackle issues beyond physical distancing, for instance the privacy-respectful detection of groups and the analysis of their motion patterns.","Pouw, Caspar A.

To minimize these risks, it is important that ambulance care professionals adequately cope with critical incidents. Especially from the perspective of starting ambulance care professionals it is unknown which coping styles they use when experiencing a critical incident and how they are trained to cope with critical incidents. The aim of this study was to gain insight in (a) what starting ambulance care professionals describe as critical incidents, (b) how they experience these critical incidents and their consequences, (c) how they cope with these incidents, and (d) how they are trained and guided to cope with these incidents. METHODS: A qualitative design with individual, semi-structured interviews was used. The data was analyzed by using inductive thematic analysis. RESULTS: Twenty-two starting ambulance care professionals were interviewed of which, 11 were male. The age ranged from 23 to 31 years, with 11 participants being 27 years or younger. Three key-themes emerged that make an incident critical: (1) emotional connection versus emotional detachment, (2) feeling loss of control, and (3) incomprehension. All participants experienced several short to middle term physical, psychological and social consequences after encountering a critical incident. Starting ambulance care professionals applied different coping strategies during different phases of the ambulance care process: a mix of depersonification, focus on the medical task, support from colleagues and their own network, seeking confirmation, and distraction. Most starting ambulance care professionals don’t actively remember they received education about coping with critical incidents during their initial educational program. During and after traineeships, the workplace preceptor has a crucial role for starting ambulance care professionals to learn them how to cope with critical incidents. CONCLUSIONS: Three key-themes interact to make an incident more critical for starting ambulance care professionals. To cope with these critical incidents, starting ambulance care professionals use a variety of coping strategies. These results can be used to develop training and coaching for starting ambulance care professionals so they can adequately cope with critical incidents.","Loef, Jorik; Vloet, Lilian C.

Building on these findings, the current research investigated the relationship between psychological entitlement and breaching coronavirus restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using self-reported adherence to various infection prevention measures, Study 1 revealed that psychological entitlement positively predicted a lower likelihood of complying with distancing instructions in Chinese university students. Study 2 fully replicated these findings in a new sample of Chinese working adults. Moving beyond self-assessment of public health-compliance behaviors, Study 3 further assessed the relationship behaviorally and recapitulated the reported effects. Consistently, Studies 1 through 3 provided supporting evidence that fairness perceptions mediate the negative link between psychological entitlement and observance of preventive measures. Overall, our findings suggest that individual differences in psychological entitlement are associated with people's virus-mitigating behaviors in the fight against COVID-19.","Li, Heng",Pers Individ Dif,197,17

Nowadays, presenting intelligent biological data analysis tools at a low cost is important to analyze the biological structure of COVID-19. The global alignment algorithm is one of the important bioinformatics tools that measure the most accurate similarity between a pair of biological sequences. The huge time consumption of the standard global alignment algorithm is its main limitation especially for sequences with huge lengths. This work proposed a fast global alignment tool (G-Aligner) based on meta-heuristic algorithms that estimate similarity measurements near the exact ones at a reasonable time with low cost. The huge length of sequences leads G-Aligner based on standard Sine-Cosine optimization algorithm (SCA) to trap in local minima. Therefore, an improved version of SCA was presented in this work that is based on integration with PSO. Besides, mutation and opposition operators are applied to enhance the exploration capability and avoiding trapping in local minima. The performance of the improved SCA algorithm (SP-MO) was evaluated on a set of IEEE CEC functions. Besides, G-Aligner based on the SP-MO algorithm was tested to measure the similarity of real biological sequence. It was used also to measure the similarity of the COVID-19 virus with the other 13 viruses to validate its performance. The tests concluded that the SP-MO algorithm has superiority over the relevant studies in the literature and produce the highest average similarity measurements 75% of the exact one.","Issa, Mohamed",Appl Soft Comput,197,1

The trial has been extended from the original 12- to 24-month follow-up, using study coordinator-initiated telephone visits. TAILOR-PCI Digital Study tests the feasibility of extending the trial follow-up in a subset of patients for up to 24 months using state-of-the-art digital solutions. The rationale, design, and approach of extended digital study of patients recruited into a large, international, multi-center clinical trial has not been previously described. METHODS: A total of 930 patients from U.S. and Canadian sites previously enrolled in the 5,302 patient TAILOR-PCI trial within 23 months of randomization are invited by mail to the Digital Study website (http://tailorpci.eurekaplatform.org) and by up to 2 recruiting telephone calls. Eureka, a direct-to-participant digital research platform, is used to consent and collect prospective data on patients for the digital study. Patients are asked to answer health-related surveys at fixed intervals using the Eureka mobile app and or desktop platform. The likelihood of patients enrolled in a randomized clinical trial transitioning to a registry using digital technology, the reasons for nonparticipation and engagement rates are evaluated. To capture hospitalizations, patients may optionally enable geofencing, a process that allows background location tracking and triggering of surveys if a hospital visit greater than 4 hours is detected. In addition, patients answer digital hospitalization surveys every month. Hospitalization data received from the Digital Study will be compared to data collected from study coordinator telephone visits during the same time frame. CONCLUSIONS: The TAILOR-PCI Digital Study evaluates the feasibility of transitioning a large multicenter randomized clinical trial to a digital registry. The study could provide evidence for the ability of digital technology to follow clinical trial patients and to ascertain trial-related events thus also building the foundation for conducting digital clinical trials.

Long term pathology persists well beyond the resolution of viral replication, indicating that the prolonged immune response is not virus-mediated. However, it is not clear how these responses are sustained or even initiated following infection. This review discusses recent work from our laboratory and others which demonstrates different entry pathways specific to both adenovirus and cell type. These findings suggest that adenoviruses may stimulate specific pattern recognition receptors in an entry/trafficking-dependent manner, leading to distinct immune responses dependent on the virus/cell type combination. Additional work is needed to understand the specific connections between adenoviral entry and the stimulation of innate immune responses by the various cell types present on the ocular surface.","Pennington, Matthew R.; Saha, Amrita; Painter, David F.; Gavazzi, Christina; Ismail, Ashrafali M.; Zhou, Xiaohong; Chodosh, James; Rajaiya, Jaya",Microorganisms,197,26

Cerebral cerebrospinal fluid loss in the presence of altered brain viscoelastic properties has previously been suggested as the pathophysiological process leading to ventriculomegaly, despite low or negative intracranial pressures and patent shunts. More recently, cerebral venous overdrainage has been proposed as a possible explanation in the pathogenesis of LPH, though its connection to lumbar punctures in shunted patients has not been contemplated yet. The effectiveness of epidural blood patch in the management of post-lumbar puncture LPH has been shown in children, but has not been reported in adults. Case description Herein we detail two episodes of shunt malfunction in a 30-year-old female with a history of hydrocephalus related to a posterior fossa tumor diagnosed during childhood. In both instances, imaging studies demonstrated ventricular dilation along with perimedullary cistern enlargement and brainstem distortion, which occurred following a lumbar puncture despite a patent shunt. A lumbar blood patch was effective in both episodes, enabling resolution of the ventriculomegaly and a good outcome. Conclusions a blood patch can be efficient in adults with post-lumbar puncture LPH. Some symptoms may be explained by brainstem compression caused by enlarged CSF spaces at the skull base. The role of cerebral venous overdrainage in the setting of post-lumbar puncture LPH is further supported.","Vilela, Marcelo D.; Pedrosa, Hugo AS.; Mesquita, Braulio F.; Horiguchi, Claudia L.F.",World Neurosurg,197,24

We provide direct evidence of interactions between Transcription Regulating Sequences (TRS-L and TRS-Bs), which facilitate discontinuous transcription. In addition, we reveal alternative short and long distance arches around FSE, forming a “high-order pseudoknot” embedding FSE, which might help ribosome stalling at frameshift sites. More importantly, we found that within virions, while SARS-CoV-2 genome RNA undergoes intensive compaction, genome cyclization is weakened and genome domains remain stable.

However, limited evidence exists on the condition of persons with dementia and their caregivers during the pandemic in lower-middle-income countries (LMICs). The study aimed to provide insights into the experiences of persons with dementia and their families during the early phases of the pandemic in India. METHODS This study adopted a mixed-method approach. One hundred and four persons with dementia and their caregivers were evaluated via telephone using validated instruments and a semi-structured interview guide. We used the quantitative data collected to establish a baseline, whereas qualitative data were analysed thematically. RESULTS The study revealed that persons with dementia and their caregivers experienced difficulties during the pandemic, which included worsening of behaviour, problems in accessing care, disruptions in functional activities and struggles in enforcing infection prevention contributing to caregiver distress. An important finding that emerged was the unchanging reality of caregiving for families. The relative success of the public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic contrasted with the lack of awareness and formal support for dementia. CONCLUSIONS The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the vulnerabilities of persons with dementia and their caregivers.

Indications and timing for performing tracheotomy in patients affected by severe COVID-19 pneumonia are still elusive. The aim of this study is to analyze the role of tracheotomy in the context of this pandemic. Moreover, we report the timing of the procedure and the time needed to complete weaning and decannulation in our center. METHODS: This retrospective, observational cohort study included adults (≥18 years) with severe COVID-19 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of the tertiary care center of Reggio Emilia (Italy). All patients underwent orotracheal intubation with invasive mechanical ventilation, followed by percutaneous or open surgical tracheotomy. Indications, timing of the procedure, and time needed to complete weaning and decannulation were reported. RESULTS: Forty-four patients were included in the analysis. Median time from orotracheal intubation to surgery was 7 (range 2-17) days. Fifteen (34.1%) patients died during the follow-up period (median 22 days, range 8-68) after the intubation. Weaning from the ventilator was first attempted on median 25th day (range 13-43) from orotracheal intubation. A median of 35 (range 18-79) days was required to complete weaning. Median duration of ICU stay was 22 (range 10-67) days. Mean decannulation time was 36 (range 10-77) days from surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Since it is not possible to establish an optimal timing for performing tracheotomy, decision-making should be made on case-by-case basis. It should be adapted to the context of the pandemic, taking into account the availability of intensive care resources, potential risks for health care workers, and benefits for the individual patient.","Botti, Cecilia; Lusetti, Francesca; Peroni, Stefano; Neri, Tommaso; Castellucci, Andrea; Salsi, Pierpaolo; Ghidini, Angelo",Ear Nose Throat J,197,26

DESIGN: Randomized pilot study. PARTICIPANTS: NVAMD patients with two or more injections of anti-VEGF within prior six months who were expected to require treatment for at least eight more months. METHODS AND INTERVENTIONS: Participants were assigned to either retinal imaging and DFE or retinal imaging without a DFE except at 16 weeks and 32 weeks and at study completion. OUTCOMES: Primary safety outcomes were change in usual-corrected visual acuity (UCVA) and central subfield thickness (CST). Primary efficacy outcomes included time spent in clinic and patient satisfaction with clinic visits. RESULTS: The 66 participants had mean baseline UCVA of 20/50 in the study eye. Median change in UCVA from baseline to each clinic visit in each arm was “no change”. Mean change in CST was less than 15 microns from baseline to any follow-up clinic visit. Time spent in the clinic at follow-up visits averaged 20 minutes less for participants in the Imaging Only group than those in the Full Exam group. More participants in the Imaging Only group were satisfied with the time spent in clinic and with the clinic visits overall than participants in the Full Exam group: means of 71 vs 91 minutes, respectively, per clinic visit. CONCLUSION: Based on findings from this randomized pilot study, follow-up retina clinic visits for established patients who have NVAMD and are under treatment with intravitreous injection of anti-VEGF agents could be streamlined by implementing longer intervals between DFE and by relying on imaging alone to make most decisions regarding the need for retreatment, thereby reducing the time spent by patients in clinic and increasing their satisfaction with care received, without excess adverse events.

This graphical information offers a distinctive image that facilitates their recognition. However, the uniqueness of these configuration cues may make brand names more vulnerable to counterfeiting via misspelling. We examined whether the confusability at detecting misspelled brand names is higher when embedded in the full logo than when presented in plain format (Experiment 1), when removing all graphical information of the logo other than typeface (Experiment 2), and when only modifying the typeface (Experiment 3). Participants had to decide whether the presented item was a correctly spelled brand name. The misspelled stimuli were created by either transposing or replacing two internal letters of popular brand names (amazon → amzaon vs. amceon), thus allowing us to have a measure of the transposed-letter confusability effect. Results showed a sizeable transposed-letter confusability effect for all types of brand names, but the effect was greatest for the misspelled full logos. Thus, the distinctiveness of the graphical information in logos has a deleterious side effect: logos are quite vulnerable to counterfeiting via misspelling branding.","Perea, Manuel; Baciero, Ana; Rocabado, Francisco; Marcet, Ana",Psychon Bull Rev,197,30

METHODS: This is a retrospective, single-centre cohort study. Patients were included visiting the fever clinic from 4(th) of April 2020 to 15(th) of May 2020. Symptoms, comorbidities, and socio-demographic factors were recorded in a standardized fashion. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify risk factors of COVID-19, on the bases of those a model discrimination was assessed using area under the receiver operation curves (AUROC). RESULTS: The final analysis included 930 patients, of which 74 (8%) had COVID-19. Anosmia (OR 10.71; CI 6.07–18.9) and ageusia (OR 9.3; CI 5.36–16.12) were strongly associated with COVID-19. High-risk exposure (OR 12.20; CI 6.80–21.90), especially in the same household (OR 4.14; CI 1.28–13.33), was also correlated; the more household members, especially with flu-like symptoms, the higher the risk of COVID-19.

In the more than half a century since that idea was advanced, functional analysis has either fallen into disuse, as in most of applied psychology, or has been used but modified to a point that is virtually inapplicable elsewhere, as in applied behavior analysis work with severe developmental disabilities. In this paper we argue that the current challenges with COVID-19 present an ideal time to reinvigorate functional analysis by combining it with the growing body of evidence on processes of change, organized under an extended evolutionary meta-model. This new form of process-based functional analysis takes advantage of the strengths of contextual behavioral science, while opening avenues of fruitful interaction with other wings of intervention and evolutionary science more generally. Using the psychological flexibility model as an example, we show how this approach solves the key problems of classical functional analysis and helps professionals deal with novel challenges such as those posed by COVID-19. Humanity is now facing an extraordinary and unexpected situation. Behavioral science needs to rise to that challenge in a way that provides both immediate practical value and greater assurance of long-term benefits for our understanding of human complexity more generally. Process-based functional analysis can be a vehicle to do just that.","Hayes, Steven C.; Hofmann, Stefan G.; Stanton, Cory E.",J Contextual Behav Sci,197,18

National healthcare services have to manage unexpected shortages of healthcare resources that have to be re-allocated according to the principles of fair and ethical prioritisation, in order to maintain the highest levels of care to all patients, ensure the safety of patients and healthcare workers, and save as many lives as possible. Also, cancer care services have to pursue restructuring, following the same evidence-based dispositions. In this article, we propose a guidance to the management of pancreatic cancer during the pandemic, prioritised according to a three-tiered framework, and based on expert clinical judgement and magnitude of benefit expected from specific interventions. Since the availability of resources for diagnostic procedures, surgery and postoperative care, systemic therapy and radiotherapy may differ, the authors have separated the prioritisation analyses. The impact of postponing or abrogating cancer interventions on outcomes according to a high, medium or low priority scale is outlined and discussed. The implementation of healthcare services using telemedicine is explored; it reveals itself as functional and effective for limiting patients’ need to travel to centres and thereby has the potential to reduce diffusion of SARS-CoV-2. Pancreatic cancer demands a considerable amount of medical resources. Therefore, the redefinition of its diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms with a rigorous method is crucial in order to ensure the highest quality of continuum of care in the broader context of the pandemic and the challenged healthcare systems.","Catanese, Silvia; Pentheroudakis, George; Douillard, Jean-Yves; Lordick, Florian",ESMO Open,197,1

However, the veracity and origins of this paradox have been contested across decades of literature, as many scholars argue it relates to measurement issues or historical coincidences. Disentangling between potential explanations is crucial to determine if widespread adoption of the Nordic model could represent a sufficient panacea for lowering health inequalities, or if new approaches must be pioneered. As newfound challenges to welfare systems continue to emerge, evidence describing the benefits of welfare systems is becoming ever more important. Preliminary evidence indicates that the COVID-19 pandemic is drastically exacerbating social inequalities in health across the world, via direct and indirect effects. We argue that the COVID-19 pandemic therefore represents a unique opportunity to measure the value of welfare systems in insulating their populations from rising social inequalities in health. However, COVID-19 has also created new measurement challenges and interrupted data collection mechanisms. Robust academic studies will therefore be needed—drawing on novel data collection methods—to measure increasing social inequalities in health in a timely fashion. In order to assure that policies implemented to reduce inequalities can be guided by accurate and updated information, policymakers, academics, and the international community must work together to ensure streamlined data collection, reporting, analysis, and evidence-based decision-making. In this way, the pandemic may offer the opportunity to finally clarify some of the mechanisms underpinning the Nordic Paradox, and potentially more firmly establish the merits of the Nordic model as a global example for reducing social inequalities in health.","Friedman, Joseph; Calderon-Villarreal, Alhelí; Heggebø, Kristian; Balaj, Mirza; Bambra, Clare; Eikemo, Terje Andreas",Soc Sci Med,197,1

Reduced presentations may be due to overwhelmed capacities of hospitals or collateral damage from fear of infection, lockdown regulations, or other reasons. The effect on patients with liver cirrhosis is not established. OBJECTIVE: We aim to assess the impact on the care of patients with liver cirrhosis in a tertiary center in Northern Germany. METHODS: All patients presenting to the emergency department with a diagnosis of cirrhosis between March 1 and May 31 from 2015-2020 were included. Reasons for presentation, duration of symptoms, the severity of liver disease, and 30-day mortality were assessed and compared between patients presenting during the COVID-19 pandemic and pre-COVID-19. RESULTS: Overall, 235 patients were included. Despite an overall decline in presentations to the emergency department by 11.7%, the frequency of patients presenting with liver cirrhosis has remained stable (non-significant increase by 19.5%). No significant difference could be detected for the MELD score, the CLIF-organ failure subscores, and the 30-day mortality before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Up to 75% of patients with liver cirrhosis had symptoms >24 h before presenting to the emergency department. CONCLUSION: Despite the overall trend of reduced emergency presentations during the COVID-19 pandemic, the frequency of presentations of patients with liver cirrhosis did not decline. Morbidity and mortality were not affected in a setting of disposable healthcare resources. The late presentation to the emergency department in many cirrhotic patients may open opportunities for interventions (i.e., with early telemedicine intervention).","Höner Zu Siederdissen, Christoph; Schultalbers, Marie; Wübbolding, Maximilian; Lechte, Greta Sophie; Laser, Hans; Cornberg, Markus; Wedemeyer, Heiner; Maasoumy, Benjamin",Z Gastroenterol,197,20

Therefore, this study aimed to report the midterm clinical and radiological outcomes of patients with LSDs after cervical laminoplasty. METHODS: Six patients with LSD who underwent laminoplasty with/without C1 laminectomy for cervical myelopathy were enrolled. Clinical evaluations, including the cervical Japanese Orthopedic Association (cJOA) score and visual analog scale (VAS) scores for upper extremity numbness, and radiographic parameters, including C2-C7 lordotic angle, atlanto-dens interval (ADI), and â¿ADI, were evaluated preoperatively, at 2 years postoperatively, and at the final follow-up. RESULTS: Five patients had mucopolysaccharidoses (type I: n = 1, II: n = 3, VII: n = 1) and one patient had mucolipidoses type III. The mean age of patients at surgery was 27.5 years, and the mean postoperative follow-up period was 61 months. All mucopolysaccharidoses cases required C1 posterior arch resection with C2-C7 laminoplasty. No critical complications were observed postoperatively. There were no significant differences in C2-C7 angle (p = 0.724) and â¿ADI (p = 0.592) between the preoperative and final follow-ups. The cJOA score and VAS for numbness significantly improved at the final follow-up (p = 0.004 and p = 0.007, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The cervical myelopathy in patients with LSD could be safely and effectively treated with laminoplasty with/without C1 posterior arch resection after excluding patients with atlantoaxial instability. Atlantoaxial stability and symptom improvement could be maintained at an average of 5 years postoperatively.","Terai, Hidetomi; Tamai, Koji; Hoshino, Masatoshi; Toyoda, Hiromitsu; Suzuki, Akinobu; Takahashi, Shinji; Hori, Yusuke; Yabu, Akito; Nakamura, Hiroaki",Orphanet J Rare Dis,197,16

The SARS-CoV-2 infected subjects can be asymptomatic or symptomatic; the later may present a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations. However, the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on oral diseases remain poorly studied. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in saliva indicates existence of virus in the oral cavity. Recent studies demonstrating the expression of ACE-2, a SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor, in oral tissues further strengthens this observation. Cytokine storm in severe COVID-19 patients and copious secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-1β and TNF-α) in multiple symptomatic oral pathologies including periodontitis and periapical periodontitis suggests that inflammatory microenvironment is a hallmark of both COVID-19 and oral diseases. Hyperinflammation may provide conducive microenvironment for the growth of local oral pathogens or opportunistic microbes and exert detrimental impact on the oral tissue integrity. Multiple case reports have indicated uncharacterized oral lesions, symptomatic irreversible pulpitis, higher plaque index, necrotizing/desquamative gingivitis in COVID-19 patients suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 may worsen the manifestations of oral infections. However, the underlying factors and pathways remain elusive. Here we summarize current literature and suggest mechanisms for viral pathogenesis of oral dental pathology derived from oral microbiome and oral mucosa-dental tissue interactions. Longitudinal studies will reveal how the virus impairs disease progression and resolution post-therapy.

From the early 1990s a number of weaknesses within the structure and governance of the World Health Organization were becoming apparent, as a rapidly changing post Cold War world placed more complex demands on the international organizations generally, but significantly so in the field of global health. Towards the end of that decade and during the first half of the next, WHO revitalized and played a crucial role in setting global health priorities. However, over the past decade, the organization has to some extent been bypassed for funding, and it lost some of its authority and its ability to set a global health agenda. The reasons for this decline are complex and multifaceted. Some of the main factors include WHO's inability to reform its core structure, the growing influence of non-governmental actors, a lack of coherence in the positions, priorities and funding decisions between the health ministries and the ministries overseeing development assistance in several donor member states, and the lack of strong leadership of the organization.","Lidén, J.",Public Health,197,10

The results indicated the following: (1) The grain production of eastern and southern areas was higher, while that of western and northern areas was lower; (2) The grain production center in the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain shifted from the southeast to northwest in Tai’an, and was distributed stably at the border between Jining and Tai’an; (3) The global spatial autocorrelation experienced a changing process of “decline–growth–decline”, and the area of hot and cold spots was gradually reduced and stabilized, which indicated that the polarization of grain production in local areas gradually weakened and the spatial difference gradually decreased in the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain; (4) The impact of socio-economic factors has been continuously enhanced while the role of climate factors in grain production has been gradually weakened. The ratio of the effective irrigated area, the amount of fertilizer applied per unit sown area, and the average per capita annual income of rural residents were conducive to the increase in grain production in the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain; however, the effect of the annual precipitation on grain production has become weaker.

We herein present a case of a 71 year old patient with hypoxic respiratory failure initially treated for COVID pneumonia, to be later diagnosed with Osimertinib induced pneumonitis. CASE PRESENTATION: A 71 year old gentleman with a 20 pack-year smoking history, epidermal growth factor receptor mutated stage IV non-small cell lung cancer with brain metastasis treated with Osimertinib, presented to the emergency room in March 2021 with shortness of breath for three days. On presentation, his oxygen saturation was 87% on room air and increased to 92% with 6 liters per minute (L/min) of oxygen. Contrast Computed Tomography (CT) scan of the chest excluded pulmonary embolism but revealed multifocal patchy opacities along with an interval increase in the size of his primary tumor and pulmonary nodules. Laboratory investigations revealed the absence of leukocytosis with lymphopenia and slightly elevated lactate dehydrogenase and C-reactive protein. COVID pneumonia was suspected despite a negative nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 PCR test. The patient was then started on treatment with Methylprednisolone (20 mg/day twice daily) and Remdesivir (200mg/day followed by 100 mg/day) due to high suspicion for COVID despite the negative test. Given the patient's immunosuppressed state, broad-spectrum antibiotics were also given for a possible bacterial infection. Over the next 24 hours, his oxygen requirements continued to escalate to 15 L/min through high flow nasal cannula. He was then transferred to the intensive care unit for management of hypoxic respiratory failure. Despite treatment for COVID and bacterial pneumonia, the patient's oxygen requirements did not improve. As a result, other differential diagnoses were investigated. Methylprednisolone pulse therapy (1g/day for three days) was started for suspected Osimertinib induced pneumonitis. His oxygenation and symptoms significantly improved over the next 48 hours to 4 L/min. Patient was discharged on Prednisone 60 mg/day and oxygen therapy was discontinued six days after initial presentation. DISCUSSION: We present a case of osimertinib induced pneumonitis. This diagnosis was confirmed based on the rapid clinical improvement following the initiation of high dose steroids. Few case reports in the literature describe this adverse complication and its incidence remains unclear [1]. In our case, pneumonitis developed after approximately five months of Osimertinib treatment in a patient with no previous parenchymal lung disease. Given that this complication could be life-threatening, it should be given urgent attention and the correct treatment should be administered as early as possible [2]. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, despite a typical presentation of a hypoxic respiratory failure in the era of the COVID pandemic, other differential diagnosis should always be considered.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ninety-nine COVID-19 patients who were confirmed by positive nucleic acid test (NAT) of RT-PCR and hospitalized from January 19, 2020 to February 19, 2020 were collected for this retrospective study. All patients underwent arterial blood gas test, routine blood test, chest CT examination, and physical examination on admission. In addition, fellow-up clinical data including the disease severity, clinical treatment, and clinical outcomes were collected for each patient. Lung volume, lesion volume, non-lesion lung volume (NLLV) (lung volume – lesion volume), and fraction of non-lesion lung volume (%NLLV) (non-lesion lung volume / lung volume) were quantified in CT images by using two U-Net models trained for segmentation of lung and COVID-19 lesions in CT images. Furthermore, we calculated 20 histogram textures for lesions volume and non-lesion lung volumes, respectively. To investigate the validity of CT quantification in the management of COVID-19, we built Random Forest (RF) models for the purpose of classification and regression to assess the disease severity (Moderate, Severe, and Critical) and to predict the need and length of ICU stay, the duration of oxygen inhalation, hospitalization, sputum NAT-positive, and patient prognosis. The performance of RF classifiers was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves (AUC) and that of RF regressors using the root-mean-square error (RMSE). RESULTS: Patients were classified into three groups of disease severity: moderate (n=25), severe (n=47) and critical (n=27), according to the clinical staging. Of which, a total of 32 patients, 1 (1/25) moderate, 6 (6/47) severe and 25 critical (25/27), respectively, were admitted to ICU. The median values of ICU stay were 0, 0, 12 days, the duration of oxygen inhalation 10, 15, and 28 days, the hospitalization 12, 16, and 28 days, and the sputum NAT-positive 8, 9, 13 days, in three severity groups, respectively. The clinical outcomes were complete recovery (n=3), partial recovery with residual pulmonary damage (n=80), prolonged recovery (n=15), and death (n=1). The %NLLV in three severity groups were 92.18±9.89%, 82.94±16.49%, and 66.19±24.15% with p-value <0.05 among each two groups. The AUCs of RF classifiers were 0.927 and 0.929 in classification of moderate vs (severe + critical), and severe vs critical, respectively, which were significantly higher than both radiomics models and clinical models (p<0.05). The RMSEs of RF regressors were 0.88 weeks for prediction of duration of hospitalization (mean: 2.60 ± 1.01 weeks), 0.92 weeks for duration of oxygen inhalation (mean: 2.44 ± 1.08 weeks), 0.90 weeks for duration of sputum NAT-positive (mean: 1.59 ± 0.98 weeks), and 0.69 weeks for stay of ICU (mean: 1.32 ± 0.67 weeks), respectively. The AUCs for prediction of ICU treatment and prognosis (partial recovery vs prolonged recovery) were 0.945 and 0.960, respectively. CONCLUSION: CT quantification and machine-learning models shows great potentials for assisting decision-making in the management of COVID-19 patients by assessing disease severity and predicting clinical outcomes.","Cai, Wenli; Liu, Tianyu; Xue, Xing; Luo, Guibo; Wang, Xiaoli; Shen, Yihong; Fang, Qiang; Sheng, Jifang; Chen, Feng; Liang, Tingbo",Acad Radiol,197,16

A docking study involving binding between the initial lead compound 1 and the SARS-CoV 3CL(pro) motivated the replacement of a thiazole with a benzothiazole unit as a warhead moiety at the P1′ site. This modification led to the identification of more potent derivatives, including 2i, 2k, 2m, 2o, and 2p, with IC(50) or K(i) values in the submicromolar to nanomolar range. In particular, compounds 2i and 2p exhibited the most potent inhibitory activities, with K(i) values of 4.1 and 3.1 nM, respectively. The peptidomimetic compounds identified through this process are attractive leads for the development of potential therapeutic agents against SARS. The structural requirements of the peptidomimetics with potent inhibitory activities against SARS-CoV 3CL(pro) may be summarized as follows: (i) the presence of a benzothiazole warhead at the S1′-position; (ii) hydrogen bonding capabilities at the cyclic lactam of the S1-site; (iii) appropriate stereochemistry and hydrophobic moiety size at the S2-site and (iv) a unique folding conformation assumed by the phenoxyacetyl moiety at the S4-site.","Konno, Sho; Thanigaimalai, Pillaiyar; Yamamoto, Takehito; Nakada, Kiyohiko; Kakiuchi, Rie; Takayama, Kentaro; Yamazaki, Yuri; Yakushiji, Fumika; Akaji, Kenichi; Kiso, Yoshiaki; Kawasaki, Yuko; Chen, Shen-En; Freire, Ernesto; Hayashi, Yoshio",Bioorg Med Chem,197,8

What are the epistemic effects if they do? Several philosophers and social scientists have recently argued that when individuals detect demographic diversity in their group, this can result in epistemic benefits even if that diversity doesn’t involve cognitive differences. Here I critically discuss research advocating this proposal, introduce a distinction between two types of detection of demographic diversity, and apply this distinction to the theorizing on diversity in science. Focusing on ‘invisible’ diversity (i.e., differences in, e.g., LGBTQ+, religious, or political orientation), I argue that in one common kind of group in science, if group members have full insight into their group’s diversity, this is likely to create epistemic costs. These costs can be avoided and epistemic benefits gained if group members only partly detect their group’s diversity. There is thus an epistemic reason for context-dependent limitations on scientists’ insight into the diversity of their group.","Peters, Uwe",Eur J Philos Sci,197,5

During the COVID-19 pandemic, community leaders expressed frustration and bewilderment about PB. Psychological explanatory concepts, including those from social learning theory and the concept of the behavioral immune system, along with recent research, suggests the following account of pandemic-related PB. PB arises when people are told to go into self-isolation as part of pandemic containment interventions. Empirically, episodes of PB typically last 7-10 days and are likely initiated by highly fearful people. PB by an anxious minority of shoppers leads to fear contagion among other shoppers, amplified by widespread dissemination, via social media, of images and videos of PB and empty shelves in stores. Thus, a snow-balling effect arises where fear of scarcity creates real but short-term scarcity. People who are highly frightened of infection tend to have heightened disgust proneness. Toilet paper is a means of escaping disgust stimuli, and for this and other reasons, toilet paper became a target of PB for people frightened of contracting COVID-19. Exploitative or selfish over-purchasing also occurred, motivated by “dark” (e.g., psychopathic) personality traits. “Don’t panic!” messages from community leaders were ineffective or counter-productive. Alternative forms of messaging are discussed.","Taylor, Steven",Journal of anxiety disorders,197,16

In India, a large country of about 1.3 billion people, the disease was first detected on January 30, 2020, in a student returning from Wuhan. The total number of confirmed infections in India as of May 3, 2020, is more than 37,000 and is currently growing fast. OBJECTIVE: Most of the prior research and media coverage focused on the number of infections in the entire country. However, given the size and diversity of India, it is important to look at the spread of the disease in each state separately, wherein the situations are quite different. In this paper, we aim to analyze data on the number of infected people in each Indian state (restricted to only those states with enough data for prediction) and predict the number of infections for that state in the next 30 days. We hope that such statewise predictions would help the state governments better channelize their limited health care resources. METHODS: Since predictions from any one model can potentially be misleading, we considered three growth models, namely, the logistic, the exponential, and the susceptible-infectious-susceptible models, and finally developed a data-driven ensemble of predictions from the logistic and the exponential models using functions of the model-free maximum daily infection rate (DIR) over the last 2 weeks (a measure of recent trend) as weights. The DIR is used to measure the success of the nationwide lockdown. We jointly interpreted the results from all models along with the recent DIR values for each state and categorized the states as severe, moderate, or controlled. RESULTS: We found that 7 states, namely, Maharashtra, Delhi, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal are in the severe category. Among the remaining states, Tamil Nadu, Rajasthan, Punjab, and Bihar are in the moderate category, whereas Kerala, Haryana, Jammu and Kashmir, Karnataka, and Telangana are in the controlled category. We also tabulated actual predicted numbers from various models for each state. All the R(2) values corresponding to the logistic and the exponential models are above 0.90, indicating a reasonable goodness of fit. We also provide a web application to see the forecast based on recent data that is updated regularly. CONCLUSIONS: States with nondecreasing DIR values need to immediately ramp up the preventive measures to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. On the other hand, the states with decreasing DIR can maintain the same status to see the DIR slowly become zero or negative for a consecutive 14 days to be able to declare the end of the pandemic.","Ghosh, Palash; Ghosh, Rik; Chakraborty, Bibhas",JMIR Public Health Surveill,197,26

The S1 hypervariable region of Cal99 genome was most closely related to Arkansas (Ark) serotype viruses. In this study, the complete genome of Cal99 was sequenced, and the structural protein genes were compared with those of commonly used IBV vaccines as well as those of isolates from naturally occurring outbreaks in different parts of the world, to elucidate potential sources of genetic material. Based on sequence comparison, the prototype Cal99 virus is similar to the apathogenic ArkDPI virus, except in the S1 gene and stretches of sequence in the S2 and M structural protein genes, which are more related to Connecticut (Conn) and Massachusetts (Mass) strain viruses, respectively. We speculate that these two fragments came from a Conn and a Mass virus, respectively, and were incorporated into a virus largely derived from ArkDPI. Since Ark, Conn and Mass strains have been simultaneously used as live vaccines in California, both point mutations and recombination among vaccine strains may have contributed to the emergence of the Cal99 variant virus. Analysis of the structural protein genes of six Cal99 isolates demonstrated that viruses of this serotype may differ substantially in the non-S1 structural genes. Finally, we performed a challenge study with Cal99 and demonstrated that the virus causes late-onset respiratory disease, with a severity comparable to that of the M41 IBV challenge strain.","Mondal, Shankar P.; Cardona, Carol J.",Virus Genes,197,16

BACKGROUND: COVID‐19 has caused a worldwide pandemic and led a huge impact on the health of human and daily life. It has been demonstrated that physical and psychological conditions of hospitalised COVID‐19 patients are impaired, but the studies focus on physical and psychological conditions of COVID‐19 patients after discharge from hospital are rare. DESIGN: A multicentre follow‐up study. METHODS: This was a multicentre follow‐up study of COVID‐19 patients who had discharged from six designated hospitals. Physical symptoms and HRQoL were surveyed at first follow‐up (the third month after discharge). The latest multiple laboratory findings were collected through medical examination records. This study was performed and reported in accordance with STROBE checklist. RESULTS: Three hundred eleven patients (57.6%) were reported with one or more physical symptoms. The scores of HRQoL of COVID‐19 patients at third month after discharge, except for the dimension of general health, were significantly lower than Chinese population norm (p < .001). Results of logistic regression showed that female (odds ratio (OR): 1.79, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.04–3.06), older age (≥60 years) (OR: 2.44, 95% CI: 1.33–4.47) and the physical symptom after discharge (OR: 40.15, 95% CI: 9.68–166.49) were risk factors for poor physical component summary; the physical symptom after discharge (OR: 6.68, 95% CI: 4.21–10.59) was a risk factor for poor mental component summary. CONCLUSIONS: Health‐related quality of life of discharged COVID‐19 patients did not come back to normal at third month after discharge and affected by age, sex and the physical symptom after discharge. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Healthcare workers should pay more attention to the physical and psychological rehabilitation of discharged COVID‐19 patients.

In common with other centres, Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust (London) offered modified telephone consultations to new and follow‐up patients in the low vision clinic. Here we assess the success of this telephone service. METHODS: Data were collected for 500 consecutive telephone low vision appointments. Successful completion of the assessment and clinical outcomes (low vision aids prescribed, onward referral) were recorded. RESULTS: Telephone assessments were completed for 364 people (72.8%). The most common reasons for non‐completion were either no answer to the telephone call (75 people, 15%), or the patient declining assessment (20 people, 4%). There was no association between age and the likelihood of an assessment being completed. 131 new low vision aids were dispensed, 77 internal referrals were made and 15 people were referred to outside services.

To impart principles of antimicrobial stewardship (AS) and infection prevention and control (IPC), we developed a curriculum tailored to the diverse aptitudes of learners at our medical center. METHODS. We integrated case-based modules, group learning activities, smartphone applications (apps), decision support tools, and prescription audit and feedback into curricula of the medical school, medicine residency program, infectious diseases (ID) fellowship program, and hospital medicine program operations. Interventions were implemented in 2012–2016 using a quasi-experimental before-and-after study design, and this was assessed using pre- and postintervention surveys or audit of antibiotic prescriptions. RESULTS. Over 180 medical students participated in the AS and IPC seminars. After smartphone app introduction, 69% reported using the app as their preferred source of antibiotic information. Approximately 70% of students felt comfortable prescribing antibiotics for a known infection compared with 40% at baseline (P = .02), and approximately 83% were able to identify the appropriate personal protective equipment for specific scenarios. Approximately 99% agreed that they have a role in promoting patient safety and preventing healthcare-associated infections as medical students. At 20 months, appropriateness of trainee antibiotic prescriptions increased by 20% (P < .01). Almost all ID fellows indicated that the AS and IPC seminar was a vital training supplement. Uptake of internist antibiotic recommendations using AS decision support tools was approximately 70%. CONCLUSIONS. All 5 interventions addressed learning objectives and knowledge gaps and are applicable across a range of environments.

One clear approach to this problem is to target processes of the host organism rather than the microbe. Recent data have indicated that members of the tetraspanin superfamily, proteins with a widespread distribution in eukaryotic organisms and 33 members in humans, may provide such an approach. Tetraspanins traverse the membrane four times, but are distinguished from other four-pass membrane proteins by the presence of conserved charged residues in the transmembrane domains and a defining ‘signature’ motif in the larger of the two extracellular domains (the EC2). They characteristically form promiscuous associations with one another and with other membrane proteins and lipids to generate a specialized type of microdomain: the tetraspanin-enriched microdomain (TEM). TEMs are integral to the main role of tetraspanins as ‘molecular organizers’ involved in functions such as membrane trafficking, cell-cell fusion, motility, and signaling. Increasing evidence demonstrates that tetraspanins are used by intracellular pathogens as a means of entering and replicating within human cells. Although previous investigations focused mainly on viruses such as hepatitis C and HIV, it is now becoming clear that other microbes associate with tetraspanins, using TEMs as a ‘gateway’ to infection. In this article we review the properties and functions of tetraspanins/TEMs that are relevant to infective processes and discuss the accumulating evidence that shows how different pathogens exploit these properties in infection and in the pathogenesis of disease. We then investigate the novel and exciting possibilities of targeting tetraspanins for the treatment of infectious disease, using specific antibodies, recombinant EC2 domains, small-molecule mimetics, and small interfering RNA. Such therapies, directed at host-cell molecules, may provide alternative options for combating fast-mutating or newly emerging pathogens, where conventional approaches face difficulties.","Hassuna, Noha; Monk, Peter N.; Moseley, Gregory W.; Partridge, Lynda J.",BioDrugs,197,24

Virtual coaching is a promising research area to support this process. This paper presents a user-centered virtual coach for older adults at home to promote active and healthy aging and independent living. It supports behavior change processes for improving on cognitive, physical, social interaction and nutrition areas using specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-limited (SMART) goal plans, following the I-Change behavioral change model. Older adults select and personalize which goal plans to join from a catalog designed by domain experts. Intervention delivery adapts to user preferences and minimizes intrusiveness in the user’s daily living using a combination of a deterministic algorithm and incremental machine learning model. The home becomes an augmented reality environment, using a combination of projectors, cameras, microphones and support sensors, where common objects are used for projection and sensed. Older adults interact with this virtual coach in their home in a natural way using speech and body gestures on projected user interfaces with common objects at home. This paper presents the concept from the older adult and the caregiver perspectives. Then, it focuses on the older adult view, describing the tools and processes available to foster a positive behavior change process, including a discussion about the limitations of the current implementation.","Beristain Iraola, Andoni; Álvarez Sánchez, Roberto",Int J Environ Res Public Health,197,33

Thrombotic events occur in a significant number of patients with COVID-19, especially in critically ill patients. This apparent novel form of coagulopathy is termed COVID-19 associated coagulopathy and endothelial derived von Willebrand factor (vWF) may play an important role in its pathogenesis. CONTENT: vWF is a multimeric glycoprotein molecule that is involved in inflammation, primary and secondary hemostasis. Studies have shown that patients with COVID-19 have significantly elevated levels of vWF antigen and activity, likely contributing to an increased risk of thrombosis seen in CAC. The high levels of both vWF antigen and activity have been clinically correlated with worse outcomes. Furthermore, the severity of a COVID-19 infection appears to reduce molecules that regulate vWF level and activity such as ADAMT-13 and high density lipoproteins (HDL). Finally, studies have suggested that patients with blood group O (a blood group with lower than baseline levels of vWF) have a lower risk of infection and disease severity compared to other blood groups; however, more studies are needed to elucidate the role of vWF SUMMARY: CAC is a significant contributor to morbidity and mortality. Endothelial dysfunction with the release of pro-thrombotic factors, such as vWF, needs further examination as a possible important component in the pathogenesis CAC.","Mei, Zhen W; van Wijk, Xander M R; Pham, Huy P; Marin, Maximo J",J Appl Lab Med,197,13

An imbalance between pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, including tumour necrosis factor-α and interleukin-10, in PRRS may impair the immune response of the lung. Pulmonary macrophage subpopulations have a range of susceptibilities to different PRRSV strains and different capacities to express cytokines. Infection with PRRSV decreases the bactericidal activity of macrophages, which increases susceptibility to secondary bacterial infections. PRRSV infection is associated with an increase in concentrations of haptoglobin, which may interact with the virus receptor (CD163) and induce the synthesis of anti-inflammatory mediators. The balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines modulates the expression of CD163, which may affect the pathogenicity and replication of the virus in different tissues. With the emergence of highly pathogenic PRRSV, there is a need for more information on the immunopathogenesis of different strains of PRRS, particularly to develop more effective vaccines.","Gómez-Laguna, Jaime; Salguero, Francisco J.; Pallarés, Francisco J.; Carrasco, Librado",Vet J,197,1

Screening SARS-CoV-2 peptide pools revealed that the nucleocapsid (N) protein induced an immunodominant response in HLA-B7+ COVID-19-recovered individuals that was also detectable in unexposed donors. A single N-encoded epitope that was highly conserved across circulating coronaviruses drove this immunodominant response. In vitro peptide stimulation and crystal structure analyses revealed T cell-mediated cross-reactivity towards circulating OC43 and HKU-1 beta coronaviruses, but not 229E or NL63 alpha coronaviruses, due to different peptide conformations. TCR sequencing indicated cross-reactivity was driven by private T cell receptor repertoires with a bias for TRBV27 and a long CDR3β loop.

The evaluation of alternative NPIs is needed to confront the pandemic with less disruption. By harnessing human mobility data, we develop an agent-based model that can evaluate the efficacies of NPIs with individualized mobility simulations. Based on the model, we propose the data-driven targeted interventions to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic in Hong Kong without city-wide NPIs. Methods: We develop a data-driven agent-based model for 7.55 million Hong Kong residents to evaluate the efficacies of various NPIs in the first 80 days of the initial outbreak. The entire territory of Hong Kong has split into 4,905 500mx500m grids. The model can simulate detailed agent interactions based on the demographics data, public facilities and functional buildings, transportation systems, and travel patterns. The general daily human mobility patterns are adopted from Google Community Mobility Report. The scenario without any NPIs is set as the baseline. By simulating the epidemic progression and human movement at the individual level, we proposed model-driven targeted interventions, which focus on the surgical testing and quarantine of only a small portion of regions instead of enforcing NPIs in the whole city. The efficacious of common NPIs and the proposed targeted interventions are evaluated by extensive Monte Carlo simulations. Findings: Without NPIs, we estimate that there are 128,711 total infections (IQR 23,511-70,310) by the end of the 80-day simulation. The proposed targeted intervention averts 95.85% and 94.13% of baseline infections with only 100 (2.04%) and 50 (1.02%) grids being quarantined, respectively. Mild social distancing without testing results in 16,503 total cases (87.18% infections averted), rapid implementation of full lockdown and testing measures (such as the control measure in Mainland China) performs the best, with only 805 infections (99.37% infections averted). Testing-and-quarantining 10%, 20%, 50% of all symptomatic cases with 24-hour/48-hour avert 89.92%/ 87.78%, 95.47%/ 92.42%, and 97.93%/ 95.61% infections, respectively. Interpretation: Big data-driven mobility modeling can inform targeted interventions, which are able to effectively contain the COVID-19 outbreak with much lower disruption of the city. It represents a promising approach to sustainable NPIs to help us revive the economy of the city and the world.","ZHOU, H.; Zhang, Q.; Cao, Z.; Huang, H.; Zeng, D.",,197,16

Fatigue, palpitations and exercise intolerance are common complains among PCS patients in whom unexplained sinus tachycardia is a frequent observation. Objective: To evaluate the prevalence and the pathophysiological mechanisms of IST in a consecutive and prospective population of patients with PCS. Methods: Consecutive patients with persistent symptoms 3 months after an acute COVID-19 were prospectively evaluated at a multi-disciplinary PCS unit. All patients were screened for IST and those with confirmed criteria underwent comprehensive CV examination: ECO, 24h Holter (assessment of the cardiac autonomic function), QoL Questionnaire (MLHFQ), six-min walking test (6MWT) and blood sample with inflammation and myocardial biomarkers. Two control patients, matched by age and gender, were assigned to each case: one with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection without PCS (group 2,recovered asymptomatic) and one without prior COVID (group 3,uninfected). Results: IST were met in 43/200 PCS patients (21%) being more common in young (mean age 39y) woman (91%) without clinical history and with mild COVID (not requiring hospital admission during the acute phase). Mean HR 96±3 (supine) and 112±17 (upright position), with 8 patients fulfilling diagnostic of POTS. No underlying structural heart disease, proinflammatory state, myocyte injury or hypoxia were identified 6MWT showed a significantly diminished exercise capacity(59% of the estimated distance). An impaired QoL was also identified. Regarding the 24h Holter, all HRV parameters were significantly deteriorated in IST patients compared with control groups (significantly decrease in time and frequency domain parameters). The most reduced components were those related with the cardiovagal tone: PNN50 4±4 in group 1 (vs 11±9 in group 2 and 18±9 in group 3;p&lt;0 002);HF band 336±280 (vs 823±1200 in group 2 and 1229±630 in group 3;p=0 01). Conclusion: IST is a prevalent condition among PCS patients and may at least partially explain the prevalent symptoms of fatigue, impaired exercise, and palpitations, Cardiac ANS imbalance with decreased parasympathetic activity may account as a plausible explanation.","Aranyo, Julia; MD, Victor Bazan; Bisba, Felipe; Sarrias, Axel; Adelino, Raquel; Lladós, Gemma; Mateu, Lourdes; Bayés-Genís, Antoni; Villuendas, Roger",Heart Rhythm,197,2

Among the most important of these involve using social distancing to prevent contact. Restricted social contacts have important effects on activity participation and on travel demand. The current study examined an array of less-studied factors, such as attitudes and beliefs toward train use, including risk perception of flu-type infection, alongside more traditional factors, which together affect decisions whether to continue using the train. Data was collected using an internet survey application. The study was based on two surveys that were conducted approximately seven months apart, the first completed by 237 participants and the second by 149. We developed a structural equation model to better understand the influence of various factors on decisions whether to continue to use the train. We found a correlation between perception of the risk of infection and the decision to continue train travel. Study results also demonstrate the relation between trip purpose and the decision to use public transportation. The study results highlight the importance of many attributes favorably associated with train travel, including saving time, reliability, and comfort. Therefore, in contrast to the existing situation where the railway company makes its own decisions to decrease trip frequencies and to cancel some lines, government policy makers and the railway company should maintain a strong frequency schedule and increase the number of lines in order to accommodate social distancing. In addition, we found that the most effective measures for encouraging people to keep travelling by train required mask use, preventing people with flu-like symptoms from traveling by train, and fining those who do not comply. In order to sustain the train use as a viable alternative to using private vehicles it is important to decrease the risk perception of being infected by coronavirus and other kinds of infected diseases while traveling by train. This can be addressed by creating a clean and reasonably sterile environment. These results highlight the need for serious intervention by decision-makers in order to sustain the train use as a viable alternative to using private vehicles.","Elias, Wafa; Zatmeh-Kanj, Sunbola",Transp Policy (Oxf),197,22

For the first phase of vaccine allocation, the ACIP recommended healthcare personnel and long‐term care facility residents as recipients. This recommendation was based on risks endemic to these populations, as well as ethical principles related to benefits and harms, mitigating health inequalities, and promoting justice. Commercial truck drivers have played a vital and underappreciated role during the COVID‐19 pandemic. Despite the indispensable role that commercial drivers play in distributing vaccines, they have not been recommended for vaccine allocation in the next phase (1b) by the ACIP. However, the rationale and ethical principles cited for the first vaccine phase suggest that these workers should be recommended for inclusion. By doing so, the acquisition and transmission of COVID‐19 may be mitigated, which would benefit both these workers and the US public. Further, persistent vulnerabilities render commercial truck drivers susceptible to severe COVID‐19 infection; therefore, vaccination during the next phase is imperative to curb the exacerbation of extant health inequities.

At the same time, entry of SARS-CoV-2 through the gastrointestinal tract initiates the activation of innate and adaptive immune responses, the formation of an excessive inflammatory reaction and critical increase in the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, which, subsequently, can presumably increase inflammation and induce intestinal damage in patients suffering from inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The aims of the present review were to reveal and analyze possible molecular pathways and consequences of the induction of an innate and adaptive immune response during infection with SARS-CoV-2 in patients with IBD.

Based on the screening, a number of intracellular and extracellular pathways were considered and discussed, which can impact the immune response during SARS-CoV-2 infection in IBD patients.

We further hypothesize that any virus, including the new SARS-CoV-2, infecting intestinal tissues and/or entering the host’s body through receptors located on intestinal enterocytes may be a trigger for the onset of IBD in individuals with a genetic predisposition and/or the risk of developing IBD associated with other factors.","Dvornikova, K.

A Systematic Pathway Analysis of Knowledge, Competence, Confidence, and Intention to Change",13.7972355,4.9139223,2020-10-12,"BACKGROUND: Due to an unavailability of a vaccine, one of the efficient methods to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is by applying self-isolation (SI). Hence there is an urgent need to investigate the factors leading to an individuals' willingness to choose to self-isolate. OBJECTIVES: The current study utilized the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) as a conceptual model and aimed to investigate the extent to which subjective norms, personal attitudes and perceived control influences an individual's willingness to self-isolate during COVID-19 risk. METHOD: A cross-sectional study was performed on 800 Saudi respondents aged≥18 years by using a validated self-administered questionnaire about factors related to willingness to self-isolate during COVID-19 pandemic risk based on the TPB. The effects of different variables on SI were analyzed by using ordinal logistic regression model. RESULTS: A total of 756 (94.5%) were completed and analyzed. Subjective norms and perceived control over the behavior significantly (pâ<â0.05) influenced the intention of willingness to self-isolate, while attitude was found to be insignificant. The odds of letting others to know about self COVID status were 2.40 times higher than not telling the neighbors or colleagues. A statistically significant difference (p≤0.001) existed between males and females regarding the willingness to self-isolate. Similarly the odds of willingness to self-isolate with a presence of disabled person in family were 2.88 times higher than the absence of a disability in the family. Few recommendations for the policymakers that are needed to curb the spread of COVID-19 infection are also proposed. CONCLUSION: The outcomes of study might be considered as an initial understanding of the factors that significantly influences an individual's willingness to SI when facing an unprecedented pandemic risk. Additionally, these factors provide a plan for policymakers to encourage citizens for self-isolation during pandemic infections.","Issrani, Rakhi; Alam, Mohammad Khursheed",Work,197,23

In spite of the fact that, they are known to be profoundly useful, it is accounted for several adverse manifestations. Health care professionals can assume an essential part in controlling its irrational use. The purpose of this study was to explore the knowledge, attitude and behavior of health care professionals of Riyadh region of Saudi Arabia on the use of PPIs by a cross-sectional study design. METHODS: The study data was obtained through a validated self-administered questionnaire covering knowledge (20 items), attitude (8 items) and behavior (6 items). Furthermore, demographic questions were placed to decide their effect on the intended three domains. The results were analysed by descriptive analysis and affirmed by multinomial regression method using SPSS-IBM 25. RESULTS: Of 414 surveyors, 121 (31%), 182 (44%) and 103 (25%) were doctors, pharmacist and nurses, respectively. Average age of participants' was 33.96 ± 8.37 years. Both doctors and pharmacist showed better degree of information (13.17/20 and 13.25/20) and good attitude (6.66/8 and 6.9/8) towards PPI use compared to nurses. Altogether higher extent of knowledge score showed by highly educated individuals, middle age groups and those with more practicing experience. The reliance on the utilization of PPI is less among pharmacist and nurses when compared to doctors. The outcome of the regression analysis exhibited that the odds of having low knowledge is more in young and bachelor degree holders. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: Healthcare professionals in the Riyadh area are generally positive about the use of PPIs. However, increasing their level of knowledge and reducing their reliance on PPIs must be strengthened. Frequent professional development programs and trainings for healthcare professionals are needed to minimize widespread PPI overuse.","Asdaq, Syed Mohammed Basheeruddin; ALbasha, Marah; Almutairi, Asmaa; Alyabisi, Reham; Almuhaisni, Alaa; Faqihi, Roaa; Alamri, Abdulhakeem S.; Alsanie, Walaa F.; Alhomrani, Majid",Saudi Pharm J,197,1

However, a minority suffers from critical disease with substantial morbidity and mortality. OBJECTIVES: To identify individuals at risk of critical COVID-19, the relevance of a seroreactivity against seasonal human coronaviruses was analyzed. METHODS: We conducted a multi-center non-interventional study comprising 296 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections from four tertiary care referral centers in Germany and France. The ICU group comprised more males, whereas the outpatient group contained a higher percentage of females. For each patient, the serum or plasma sample obtained closest after symptom onset was examined by immunoblot regarding IgG antibodies against the nucleocapsid protein (NP) of HCoV 229E, NL63, OC43 and HKU1. RESULTS: Median age was 60 years (range 18-96). Patients with critical disease (n=106) had significantly lower levels of anti-HCoV OC43 nucleocapsid protein (NP)-specific antibodies compared to other COVID-19 inpatients (p=0.007). In multivariate analysis (adjusted for age, sex and BMI), OC43 negative inpatients had an increased risk of critical disease (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 2.68 [95% CI 1.09 - 7.05]), higher than the risk by increased age or BMI, and lower than the risk by male sex. A risk stratification based on sex and OC43 serostatus was derived from this analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that prior infections with seasonal human coronaviruses can protect against a severe course of COVID-19. Therefore, anti-OC43 antibodies should be measured for COVID-19 inpatients and considered as part of the risk assessment for each patient. Hence, we expect individuals tested negative for anti-OC43 antibodies to particularly benefit from vaccination against SARS-CoV-2, especially with other risk factors prevailing.","Dugas, Martin; Grote-Westrick, Tanja; Merle, Uta; Fontenay, Michaela; Kremer, Andreas E.; Hanses, Frank; Vollenberg, Richard; Lorentzen, Eva; Tiwari-Heckler, Shilpa; Duchemin, Jérôme; Ellouze, Syrine; Vetter, Marcel; Fürst, Julia; Schuster, Philipp; Brix, Tobias; Denkinger, Claudia M.; Müller-Tidow, Carsten; Schmidt, Hartmut; Tepasse, Phil-Robin; Kühn, Joachim",J Clin Virol,197,10

This produces the perception of sweet, bitter, salty, sour, or umami stimuli, depending on the chemical nature of the tastant. Taste impairments (dysgeusia) are alterations of this normal gustatory functioning that may result in complete taste losses (ageusia), partial reductions (hypogeusia), or over-acuteness of the sense of taste (hypergeusia). Taste impairments are not life-threatening conditions, but they can cause sufficient discomfort and lead to appetite loss and changes in eating habits, with possible effects on health. Determinants of such alterations are multiple and consist of both genetic and environmental factors, including aging, exposure to chemicals, drugs, trauma, high alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking, poor oral health, malnutrition, and viral upper respiratory infections including influenza. Disturbances or loss of smell, taste, and chemesthesis have also emerged as predominant neurological symptoms of infection by the recent Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus strain 2 (SARS-CoV-2), as well as by previous both endemic and pandemic coronaviruses such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV. This review is focused on the main causes of alteration, reduction, and loss of taste and their potential repercussion on dietary habits and health, with a special focus on the recently developed hypotheses regarding the mechanisms through which SARS-CoV-2 might alter taste perception.","Risso, Davide; Drayna, Dennis; Morini, Gabriella",Nutrients,197,1

Various treatment strategies have been attempted. Methods and Results A 61-year-old male with heart transplantation in 2017 presented with fever, cough, and dyspnea, and confirmed positive for the SARS-CoV-2 disease (COVID-19). Laboratory tests showed significant elevations in C-reactive protein and interleukin-6 (IL-6). Echocardiogram showed LVEF 58% (with EF 57% 6 months prior). Given the lack of clear management guidelines, the patient was initially managed symptomatically. However, the patient subsequently had a rapid respiratory deterioration with worsening inflammatory markers on day 5 of admission. Tocilizumab (anti-IL-6R) was in low supply in the hospital. The patient was offered clazakizumab (anti-IL-6) for compassionate use. Patient received 25 mg intravenously x1 dose. Within 24 hours, he noted significant improvement in symptoms, oxygen requirements, radiological findings and inflammatory markers. There was a transient leukopenia which improved in 4 days. He was discharged home on day 11, with negative nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 PCR as an outpatient on day 35, development of positive serum COVID-19 IgG antibody, and he continued to do well on day 60, with no heart-related symptoms. Conclusion Clazakizumab is a monoclonal antibody against human IL-6, which may be helpful in inhibiting the cytokine response to SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19. Although not yet FDA approved, it is being investigated for treatment of renal antibody-mediated rejection. Clinical trials of clazakizumab for treatment of COVID-19 are underway worldwide.","Vaidya, Gaurang; Czer, Lawrence SC.; Kobashigawa, Jon; Kittleson, Michelle; Patel, Jignesh; Chang, David; Kransdorf, Evan; Shikhare, Anuja; Tran, Hai; Vo, Ashley; Ammerman, Noriko; Huang, Edmund; Zabner, Rachel; Jordan, Stanley",Transplant Proc,197,20

Researchers around the globe need to design and develop successful therapeutics as well as vaccines against the novel COVID-19 disease. In the present study, we conducted comprehensive computer-assisted analysis on the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 in order to design a safe and potent multiepitope vaccine. In silico epitope prioritization shortlisted six HLA I epitopes and six B-cell-derived HLA II epitopes. These high-ranked epitopes were all connected to each other via flexible GPGPG linkers, and at the N-terminus side, the sequence of Cholera Toxin β subunit was attached via an EAAAK linker. Structural modeling of the vaccine was performed, and molecular docking analysis strongly suggested a positive association of a multiepitope vaccine with Toll-like Receptor 3. The structural investigations of the vaccine-TLR3 complex revealed the formation of fifteen interchain hydrogen bonds, thus validating its integrity and stability. Moreover, it was found that this interaction was thermodynamically feasible. In conclusion, our data supports the proposition that a multiepitope vaccine will provide protective immunity against COVID-19. However, further in vivo and in vitro experiments are needed to validate the immunogenicity and safety of the candidate vaccine.","Dar, Hamza Arshad; Waheed, Yasir; Najmi, Muzammil Hasan; Ismail, Saba; Hetta, Helal F.; Ali, Amjad; Muhammad, Khalid",J Immunol Res,197,32

This led to increase in psychological problems, especially in women. OBJECTIVES: To assess the prevalence of psychological problems and domestic violence (DV) in married women during the pandemic and lockdown in a panchayat in Southern India and to study the association of socio-demographic and clinical variables with psychological problems. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was undertaken in 209 married women of 18–55 years residing in a village panchayat of northern Kerala, India. Socio-demographic variables and clinical variables, like depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, perceived stress and DV, among others, were evaluated. The participants were interviewed by trained community health workers in the post-lockdown period. RESULTS: The prevalence of depressive symptoms was found to be 10.0 %, anxiety symptoms 7.2 % and perceived stress 66.0 %. Severe DV was reported by 6.2 %; but at least one form of DV was experienced by 25.8 % of the women. Significant positive correlation was observed for DV with depression and anxiety. DV was also found to be a significant predictor of depression (adjusted OR [aOR] = 4.26, P = 0.006) and anxiety (aOR=4.34, P=0.02). Being a homemaker (aOR=4.51, P = 0.03) and having past history of mental illness (aOR=5.39, P = 0.03) were also found to increase the risk for depression significantly. CONCLUSION: There is a high prevalence of psychological problems in married women during the pandemic and lockdown. DV was found to be a significant predictor of depression and anxiety in this population.","Indu, Pankajakshan Vijayanthi; Vijayan, Binsu; Tharayil, Harish M.; Ayirolimeethal, Anithakumari; Vidyadharan, Varsha",Asian J Psychiatr,197,1
687559,687559,687559,Early detection of influenza outbreak using time derivative of incidence,13.901047,4.8284817,2020-09-11,"BACKGROUND: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia is the most common type of pediatric cancer. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia causes an altered bone mineral homeostasis state, which can contribute to osteopenia, and bone fractures, most commonly vertebral fractures. With the increasing number of childhood cancer survivors, late adverse effects such as musculoskeletal comorbidities are often reported and are further influenced by inactive lifestyle habits. Physical activity has been shown to increase the mechanical workload of the bone, mitigating bone impairment in other cancer-specific populations. OBJECTIVE: This interventional pilot study aims to investigate the use of telehealth to deliver a home-based exercise intervention for early-on survivors of bone marrow–related hematological malignancies and to assess its impact on survivors’ musculoskeletal and functional health. METHODS: We aimed to recruit a group of 12 early-on survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, within 6 months to 5 years of treatment, to participate in and complete the proposed telehealth intervention with a parent. The 16-week intervention included 40 potential home-based physical activity interventions supervised by a kinesiologist through a telehealth internet platform, with monthly progression. Patients were recruited to the cohort if they were able to participate in the intervention during the first month (minimum 12 weeks of intervention). Evaluation before and after the intervention protocol highlighted differences in functional capacities and musculoskeletal health of patients using mechanography, peripheral quantitative computed tomography, 6-minute walk test, and grip force test. RESULTS: The recruitment rate for the intervention was low (12/57, 21% of contacted patients). Of 12 patients, 3 were excluded (1=relapse, 1=failure to meet technical requirements, and 1=abandoned). The 9 patients who completed the intervention (6 girls; mean age 10.93, SD 2.83 years; mean BMI 21.58, SD 6.55 kg/m(2); mean time since treatment completion 36.67, SD 16.37 months) had a mean adherence of 89% and a completion rate of 75%. In addition, these patients showed functional improvements in lower limb muscle force and power as well as in the 6-minute walk test distance. Participants also showed improved bone health after the intervention on the following parameters: bone mineral content, stress-strain index, total and cortical cross-sectional area at the 14% site (P=.03, P=.01, P=.01, and P=.001, respectively) and 38% site of the tibia (P=.003, P=.04, P=.001, and P=.003, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: High adherence and participation rates suggest that telehealth is a feasible method to deliver exercise interventions to young early-on survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The proposed intervention seems promising in providing benefits to patients’ functional performance and bone health, but a large-scale study is needed to confirm this assumption.","Lambert, Genevieve; Alos, Nathalie; Bernier, Pascal; Laverdière, Caroline; Kairy, Dahlia; Drummond, Kenneth; Dahan-Oliel, Noémi; Lemay, Martin; Veilleux, Louis-Nicolas",JMIR Cancer,197,16

DESIGN: Online cross-sectional survey. SETTING: Conducted in New Zealand over level 4 lockdown in April/May 2020. PARTICIPANTS: Findings from employed participants (2495) are included in this report; 381 healthcare workers, 649 ‘other’ essential workers and 1465 nonessential workers. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Measures included psychological distress (Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10)), anxiety (Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7)), well-being (WHO-5), alcohol use, subjective experiences and sources of stress. Differences between work categories were quantified as risk ratios or χ(2) tests. RESULTS: After controlling for confounders that differed between groups of essential and nonessential workers, those in healthcare and those in ‘other’ essential work were at 71% (95% CI 1.29 to 2.27) and 59% (95% CI 1.25 to 2.02) greater risk respectively, of moderate levels of anxiety (GAD-7 ≥10), than those in nonessential work. Those in healthcare were at 19% (95% CI 1.02 to 1.39) greater risk of poor well-being (WHO-5 <13). There was no evidence of differences across work roles in risk for psychological distress (K10 ≥12) or increased alcohol use. Healthcare and ‘other’ essential workers reported increased workload (p<0.001) and less uncertainty about finances and employment than those in nonessential work (p<0.001). Healthcare and nonessential workers reported decreased social contact. No difference by work category in health concerns was reported; 15% had concerns about participants’ own health and 33% about other people’s health. CONCLUSIONS: During the pandemic lockdown, essential workers (those in healthcare and those providing ‘other’ essential work) were at increased risk of anxiety compared with those in nonessential work, with those in healthcare also being at increased risk of poor well-being. This highlights the need to recognise the challenges this vital workforce face in pandemics.","Bell, Caroline; Williman, Jonathan; Beaglehole, Ben; Stanley, James; Jenkins, Matthew; Gendall, Philip; Rapsey, Charlene; Every-Palmer, Susanna",BMJ Open,197,16

The results obtained with it both in biochemical studies in vitro and in cell line assays in vivo were very promising, but it proved to be ineffective in clinical trials. Remdesivir exhibited far better efficacy when repurposed against SARS-CoV-2. The chemistry that accounts for this difference is the subject of this study. Here, we examine the hypothesis that remdesivir monophosphate (RMP)-containing RNA functions as a template at the polymerase site for the second run of RNA synthesis, and as mRNA at the decoding center for protein synthesis. Our hypothesis is supported by the observation that RMP can be incorporated into RNA by the RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps) of both viruses, although some of the incorporated RMPs are subsequently removed by exoribonucleases. Furthermore, our hypothesis is consistent with the fact that RdRp of SARS-CoV-2 selects RMP for incorporation over AMP by 3-fold in vitro, and that RMP-added RNA can be rapidly extended, even though primer extension is often paused when the added RMP is translocated at the i + 3 position (with i the nascent base pair at an initial insertion site of RMP) or when the concentrations of the subsequent nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs) are below their physiological concentrations. These observations have led to the hypothesis that remdesivir might be a delayed chain terminator. However, that hypothesis is challenged under physiological concentrations of NTPs by the observation that approximately three-quarters of RNA products efficiently overrun the pause.","Wang, Jimin; Reiss, Krystle; Shi, Yuanjun; Lolis, Elias; Lisi, George P.; Batista, Victor S.",Biochemistry,197,20

Apparently, those who up until now have been invisible, neglected, and forgotten have suddenly become essential, at least in the numbers necessary to provide for the needs of the labour market. The work presented here examines the Italian context before, during and after the application of the amnesty, which saw the regularization of a limited number of migrants working in the agricultural sector.
