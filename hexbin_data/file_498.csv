6186,Letter from the Editors,2006,"The authors have isolated and characterized a novel serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT)-like gene in marine Emiliania huxleyi virus (EhV-99B1). The open-reading frame (ORF) of EhV99B1-SPT encoded a protein of 496 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 96 kDa and Ip 6.01. The results of sequence analysis showed that there was about 31%–45% identity in amino acid sequence with other organisms. The maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree suggested that the EhV99B1-SPT gene possibly horizontally transferred from the eukaryote. Hydrophobic profiles of deduced amino acid sequences suggested a hydrophobic, globular and membrane-associated protein with five transmembrane domains (TMDs) motifs. Several potential N-linked glycosylation sites were presented in SPT. These results suggested that EhV99B1-SPT was an integral endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein. Despite lower sequence identity, the secondary and three-dimensional structures predicted showed that the “pocket” structure element composed of 2α-helices and 4β-sheets was the catalytic center of this enzyme, with a typical conserved “TFTKSFG” active site in the N-terminal region and was very close to those of prokaryotic organisms. However, the N-terminal domain of EhV99B1-SPT most closely resembled the LCB2 catalysis subunit and the C-terminal domain most closely resembled the LCB1 regulatory subunit of other organisms which together formed a spherical molecule. This “chimera” was highly similar to the prokaryotic homologous SPT. For a functional identification, the EhV99B1-LCB2 subunit gene was expressed in Escherichia coli, which resulted in significant accumulation of new sphingolipid in E. coli cells.","Liu, Xuhong; Zheng, Tianling; Cai, Yiqin; Liu, Jingwen",Hai Yang Xue Bao,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7097000/,498

8067,Influenza pandemic planning: One organization's experience,2010-06-25,"Classical swine fever virus (CSFV) non-structural protein 5B (NS5B) encodes an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), a key enzyme which initiates RNA replication by a de novo mechanism without a primer and is a potential target for anti-virus therapy. We expressed the NS5B protein in Escherichia coli. The rGTP can stimulate de novo initiation of RNA synthesis and mutation of the GDD motif to Gly–Asp–Asp (GAA) abolishes the RNA synthesis. To better understand the mechanism of viral RNA synthesis in CSFV, a three-dimensional model was built by homology modeling based on the alignment with several virus RdRps. The model contains 605 residues folded in the characteristic fingers, palm and thumb domains. The fingers domain contains an N-terminal region that plays an important role in conformational change. We propose that the experimentally observed promotion of polymerase efficiency by rGTP is probably due to the conformational changes of the polymerase caused by binding the rGTP. Mutation of the GDD to GAA interferes with the interaction between the residues at the polymerase active site and metal ions, and thus renders the polymerase inactive.","Zhang, Pengwei; Xie, Jian; Yi, Guanghui; Zhang, Chuyu; Zhou, Rong",Virus Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7126667/,498

As predicted, a multiple regression analysis revealed that the fear of contracting HIV/AIDS through casual contact was a significant predictor of both men's and women's willingness to interact with people living with HIV/AIDS. Attitudes toward homosexuality were also a significant predictor of attitudes toward people living with HIV/AIDS among women, who generally have a low risk of contracting the disease in Western societies. These results indicate that attitudes toward people with a serious illness may be strongly related to the perceived risk of contracting the disease.","Connors, John; Hely, Alan",J Appl Soc Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7167153/,498
11197,The Conundrums of Counselling Women in Violent Intimate Partner Relationships in South Africa: Implications for Practice,2019-06-08,"Growing global viral infections have been a serious public health problem in recent years. This current situation emphasizes the importance of developing more therapeutic antiviral compounds. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) and dengue virus (DENV) belong to the Flaviviridae family and are an increasing global health threat. Our previous study reported that the crude venom of Scorpio maurus palmatus possessed anti-HCV and anti-DENV activities in vitro. We report here the characterization of a natural antiviral peptide (scorpion-like peptide Smp76) that prevents HCV and DENV infection. Smp76 was purified from S. m. palmatus venom and contains 76 amino acids with six residues of cysteine. Smp76 antiviral activity was evaluated using a cell culture technique utilizing Huh7it-1, Vero/SLAM, HCV (JFH1, genotype 2a) and DENV (Trinidad 1751, type 2). A potential antiviral activity of Smp76 was detected in culture cells with an approximate IC(50) of 0.01 μg/ml. Moreover, Smp76 prevents HCV infection and suppresses secondary infection, by inactivating extra-cellular infectious particles without affecting viral replication. Interestingly, Smp76 is neither toxic nor hemolytic in vitro at a concentration 1000-fold higher than that required for antiviral activity. Conclusively, this report highlights novel anti-HCV and anti-DENV activities of Smp76, which may lay the foundation for developing a new therapeutic intervention against these flaviviruses.","El-Bitar, Alaa M.

15390,Occupational health in times of pandemic,2021-02-11,"Children and young people in the UK have worse health outcomes than in many similar western countries and child health inequalities are persistent and increasing. Systems thinking has emerged as a promising approach to addressing complex public health issues. We report on a systems approach to mapping the determinants of child health inequalities at the local level in England for young people aged 0–25, and describe the resulting map. Qualitative group concept mapping workshops were held in two contrasting English local authorities with a range of stakeholders: professionals (N = 35); children and young people (N = 33) and carers (N = 5). Initial area maps were developed, and augmented using data from qualitative interviews with professionals (N = 16). The resulting local maps were reviewed and validated by expert stakeholders in each area (N = 9; N = 35). Commonalities between two area-specific system maps (and removal of locality-specific factors) were used to develop a map that could be applied in any English local area. Two rounds of online survey (N = 21; N = 8) experts in public health, local governance and systems science refined the final system map displaying the determinants of child health inequalities. The process created a map of over 150 factors influencing inequalities in health outcomes for children aged 0–25 years at the local area level. The system map has six domains; physical environment, governance, economic, social, service, and personal. To our knowledge this is the first study taking a systems approach to addressing inequalities across all aspects of child health. The study shows how group concept mapping can support systems thinking at the local level. The resulting system map illustrates the complexity of factors influencing child health inequalities, and it may be a useful tool in demonstrating to stakeholders the importance of policies that tackle the systemic drivers of child health inequalities beyond those traditionally associated with public health.","Jessiman, Patricia E.; Powell, Katie; Williams, Philippa; Fairbrother, Hannah; Crowder, Mary; Williams, Joanna G.; Kipping, Ruth",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7880458/,498

Politicization of the use of HFT over recent years has led to the creation of numerous obstacles to scientific progress in this field. In July 2019, the imposition of redundant ethics policies was supplemented with the creation of the Human Fetal Tissue Ethics Advisory Board, which withheld funding of 13 out of 14 NIH grants that were favorably peer reviewed in the Summer of 2020. We believe that these new sets of restrictions are harmful to the goals of scientific progress and call upon the new administration of our government to allow peer review, not politics, to determine scientific merit and to reinstitute the previously existing ethics policies that were more than adequate to assure the appropriateness of human fetal tissue research.","Santoro, Nanette; Caplan, Arthur; Strauss, Jerome; Winn, Virginia D.",Reprod Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7909373/,498

For neurological disorders, this includes neurodegeneration and inflammation. Scalable imaging technology for big data in neurology is optical coherence tomography (OCT). We highlight that OCT changes observed in the retina, as a window to the brain, are small, requiring rigorous quality control pipelines. There are existing tools for this purpose. Firstly, there are human‐led validated consensus quality control criteria (OSCAR‐IB) for OCT. Secondly, these criteria are embedded into OCT reporting guidelines (APOSTEL). The use of the described annotation of failed OCT scans advances machine learning. This is illustrated through the present review of the advantages and disadvantages of AI‐based applications to OCT data. The neurological conditions reviewed here for the use of big data include Alzheimer disease, stroke, multiple sclerosis (MS), Parkinson disease, and epilepsy. It is noted that while big data is relevant for AI, ownership is complex. For this reason, we also reached out to involve representatives from patient organizations and the public domain in addition to clinical and research centers. The evidence reviewed can be grouped in a five‐point expansion of the OSCAR‐IB criteria to embrace AI (OSCAR‐AI). The review concludes by specific recommendations on how this can be achieved practically and in compliance with existing guidelines.","Petzold, Axel; Albrecht, Philipp; Balcer, Laura; Bekkers, Erik; Brandt, Alexander U.; Calabresi, Peter A.; Deborah, Orla Galvin; Graves, Jennifer S.; Green, Ari; Keane, Pearse A; Nij Bijvank, Jenny A.; Sander, Josemir W.; Paul, Friedemann; Saidha, Shiv; Villoslada, Pablo; Wagner, Siegfried K; Yeh, E.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 2,960 patients (1,755 males, 1,205 females; mean age: 39.6 years; range, 1 to 98 years) with orthopedic fractures were included in the study: 552 patients during the pandemic period (March 10th and July 1st, 2020) and 1,158 control patients in the same period 2019 and 1,250 control patients in 2018. Epidemiological characteristics, injury mechanisms, fracture locations and treatment details of the patients were analyzed and compared between 2018, 2019 and 2020 for adult and pediatric populations. RESULTS: Of a total of 552 patients, 485 were adults and 67 were pediatric patients. In the control groups, of 1,158 patients (2019), 770 were adults and 378 were pediatric patients and, of 1,250 patients (2018), 857 were adults and 393 were pediatric patients. The proportion of proximal femur and hand fractures significantly increased during the pandemic period (p=0.025 and p=0.038, respectively). The most frequent surgical indication in the pandemic period was proximal femoral fracture. The proportion of home accidents as an injury mechanism significantly increased in the pandemic period compared to 2018 and 2019 (48.5% vs. 18.6% and 20.6%, respectively; p=0.000). The proportion of female pediatric patients significantly increased during the pandemic period compared to 2018 and 2019 (44.8% vs. 25.4% and 27.2%, respectively, p=0.004). The proportion of forearm fractures (p=0.001) also increased, and the proportion of tibia-fibula fractures (p=0.03) decreased. The most frequent surgical indication in pediatric patients was distal humeral fracture in both groups. CONCLUSION: During the pandemic period, proximal femoral fractures in the elderly remained a concern. In-home preventative strategies may be beneficial to reduce the incidence of hip fractures in the elderly.","Oguzkaya, Sinan; Misir, Abdulhamit; Ozcamdalli, Mustafa; Eken, Gokay; Bilge Kizkapan, Turan; Bilal Kurk, Muhammed; Uzun, Erdal",Jt Dis Relat Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8343834/,498
20494,Perspectives and Values of Dental Medicine Students Regarding Domestic Violence,2021-07-30,"Cordycepin is an adenosine derivative isolated from Cordyceps sinensis, which has been used as an herbal complementary and alternative medicine with various biological activities. The general anti-cancer mechanisms of cordycepin are regulated by the adenosine A3 receptor, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), and glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3β, leading to cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. Notably, cordycepin also induces autophagy to trigger cell death, inhibits tumor metastasis, and modulates the immune system. Since the dysregulation of autophagy is associated with cancers and neuron, immune, and kidney diseases, cordycepin is considered an alternative treatment because of the involvement of cordycepin in autophagic signaling. However, the profound mechanism of autophagy induction by cordycepin has never been reviewed in detail. Therefore, in this article, we reviewed the anti-cancer and health-promoting effects of cordycepin in the neurons, kidneys, and the immune system through diverse mechanisms, including autophagy induction. We also suggest that formulation changes for cordycepin could enhance its bioactivity and bioavailability and lower its toxicity for future applications. A comprehensive understanding of the autophagy mechanism would provide novel mechanistic insight into the anti-cancer and health-promoting effects of cordycepin.","Chen, Yu-Ying; Chen, Chun-Hsien; Lin, Wei-Chen; Tung, Chih-Wei; Chen, Yung-Chia; Yang, Shang-Hsun; Huang, Bu-Miin; Chen, Rong-Jane",Molecules,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8400201/,498

Moreover, it is now widely held that the pathophysiologic mechanisms causing nasal allergy contribute, or predispose many individuals, to the development of other airway diseases, including asthma. Allergic rhinitis may well be a factor in 24% of children with otitis media with effusion (OME), and perhaps 28% of cases of chronic sinusitis. As many as 78% of persons with asthma aged 15 to 30 years have elevated serum IgE antibodies to five common aeroallergens. In many instances, nasal allergy signals the presence of more severe disease. Considerable evidence now suggests that early and appropriate intervention can improve the quality of life and productivity of patients with allergic rhinitis, enhance the academic performance of children, and reduce the prevalence of airway complications. The goal of treatment has shifted from mere symptom alleviation to blocking the pathophysiologic mechanisms that cause chronic allergic inflammation and leave patients vulnerable to airway infections. The earlier in a patient's life that this can be accomplished, the better the anticipated consequences.

The outbreak of SARS in 2002/2003 was associated with high morbidity and mortality and sparked international research efforts to develop antiviral strategies. Many of these efforts focussed on the viral surface protein spike (S), which facilitates the first indispensable step in the viral replication cycle, infectious entry into target cells. For infectious cellular entry to occur, the S protein must engage a cellular receptor, the carboxypeptidase angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The interface between ACE2 and S protein, which has been characterized at the structural level, constitutes a key target for vaccines and inhibitors, and is believed to be an important determinant of viral pathogenesis and interspecies transmission. In this chapter, we will discuss how SARS-S mediates cellular entry and we will review the implications of this process for SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) transmission, disease development and antiviral intervention.","Glowacka, Ilona; Bertram, Stephanie; Pöhlmann, Stefan",Molecular Biology of the SARS-Coronavirus,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7176234/,498

The imaging is based on active glucose utilization by inflammatory tissue. Autoradiography studies have demonstrated high FDG uptake in macrophages, granulocytes, fibroblasts, and granulation tissue. Especially, activated macrophages are responsible for the elevated FDG uptake in some types of inflammation. According to one study, after activation by lipopolysaccharide of cultured macrophages, the [(14)C]2DG uptake by the cells doubled, reaching the level seen in glioblastoma cells. In activated macrophages, increase in the expression of total GLUT1 and redistributions from the intracellular compartments toward the cell surface have been reported. In one rheumatoid arthritis model, following stimulation by hypoxia or TNF-α, the highest elevation of the [(3)H]FDG uptake was observed in the fibroblasts, followed by that in macrophages and neutrophils. As the fundamental mechanism of elevated glucose uptake in both cancer cells and inflammatory cells, activation of glucose metabolism as an adaptive response to a hypoxic environment has been reported, with transcription factor HIF-1α playing a key role. Inflammatory cells and cancer cells seem to share the same molecular mechanism of elevated glucose metabolism, lending support to the notion of usefulness of FDGPET/CT for the evaluation of inflammatory diseases, besides cancer.","Kubota, Kazuo; Ogawa, Mikako; Ji, Bin; Watabe, Tadashi; Zhang, Ming-Rong; Suzuki, Hiromi; Sawada, Makoto; Nishi, Kodai; Kudo, Takashi",PET/CT for Inflammatory Diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7418531/,498

COVID-19 is one such pandemic, which can have substantial gendered implications both during and in the post-pandemic world. Its economic and social consequences could deepen the existing gender inequalities and roll back the limited gains made in respect of women empowerment in the past few decades. The impending global recession, multiple trade restrictions, economic lockdown, and social distancing measures can expose vulnerabilities in social, political, and economic systems, which, in turn, could have a profound impact on women’s participation in trade and commerce. The article outlines five main reasons that explain why this health pandemic has put women employees, entrepreneurs, and consumers at the frontline of the struggle. It then explores how free trade agreements can contribute in repairing the harm in the post-pandemic world.

We therefore assessed the effect of two transfusion thresholds on short-term outcome in patients with ARDS. METHODS: Patients who received transfusions of RBCs were identified from a cohort of 1044 ARDS patients. After propensity score matching, patients transfused at a hemoglobin concentration of 8 g/dl or less (lower-threshold) were compared to patients transfused at a hemoglobin concentration of 10 g/dl or less (higher-threshold). The primary endpoint was 28-day mortality. Secondary endpoints included ECMO-free, ventilator-free, sedation-free, and organ dysfunction-free composites. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: One hundred ninety-two patients were eligible for analysis of the matched cohort. Patients in the lower-threshold group had similar baseline characteristics and hemoglobin levels at ARDS onset but received fewer RBC units and had lower hemoglobin levels compared with the higher-threshold group during the course on the ICU (9.1 [IQR, 8.7–9.7] vs. 10.4 [10–11] g/dl, P < 0.001). There was no difference in 28-day mortality between the lower-threshold group compared with the higher-threshold group (hazard ratio, 0.94 [95%-CI, 0.59–1.48], P = 0.78). Within 28 days, 36.5% (95%-CI, 27.0–46.9) of the patients in the lower-threshold group compared with 39.5% (29.9–50.1) of the patients in the higher-threshold group had died. While there were no differences in ECMO-free, sedation-free, and organ dysfunction-free composites, the chance for successful weaning from mechanical ventilation within 28 days after ARDS onset was lower in the lower-threshold group (subdistribution hazard ratio, 0.36 [95%-CI, 0.15–0.86], P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Transfusion at a hemoglobin concentration of 8 g/dl, as compared with a hemoglobin concentration of 10 g/dl, was not associated with an increase in 28-day mortality in adults with ARDS. However, a transfusion at a hemoglobin concentration of 8 g/dl was associated with a lower chance for successful weaning from the ventilator during the first 28 days after ARDS onset.

45084,Intra-Organizational Social Capital and Product Innovation: The Mediating Role of Realized Absorptive Capacity,2021-01-13,"Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is used in lung physiology monitoring. There is evidence that EIT is linearly associated with global tidal volume (VT) in clinically healthy patients where no positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is applied. This linearity has not been challenged by altering lung conditions. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of PEEP on VT estimation, using EIT technology and spirometry, and observe the stability of the relationship under changing lung conditions. Twelve male castrated cattle (Steer), mean age 7.8 months (SD ± 1.7) were premedicated with xylazine followed by anaesthesia induction with ketamine and maintenance with halothane in oxygen via an endotracheal tube. An EIT belt was applied around the thorax at the level of the fifth intercostal space. Volume controlled ventilation was used. PEEP was increased in a stepwise manner from 0 to 5, 10 and 15 cmH(2)O. At each PEEP, the VT was increased stepwise from 5 to 10 and 15 mL kg(−1). After a minute of stabilisation, total impedance change (VT(EIT)), using EIT and VT measured by a spirometer connected to a flow-partitioning device (VT(Spiro)) was recorded for the following minute before changing ventilator settings. Data was analysed using linear regression and multi variable analysis. There was a linear relationship between VT(EIT) and VT(Spiro) at all levels of PEEP with an R(2) of 0.71, 0.68, 0.63 and 0.63 at 0, 5, 10 and 15 cmH(2)O, respectively. The variance in VT(EIT) was best described by peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) and PEEP (adjusted R(2) 0.82) while variance in VT(Spiro) was best described by PIP and airway deadspace (adjusted R(2) 0.76). The relationship between VT(EIT) and VT(Spiro) remains linear with changes in tidal volume, and stable across altered lung conditions. This may have application for monitoring and assessment in vivo.","Brabant, O.; Crivellari, B.; Hosgood, G.; Raisis, A.; Waldmann, A.

Our framework focuses on three key features: (i) The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a sectoral shock of unknown depth and duration affecting some sectors and technologies more than others; (ii) there are constraints in shifting resources across sectors; and (iii) there is a high level of uncertainty about the disease and its economic aftermath, inducing a high level of precautionary behavior by some agents and leading to others facing more severe credit constraints. Because of macroeconomic externalities, precautionary behavior exacerbates the downturn, and even sectors where COVID-19 does not directly affect consumption or production may face unemployment. Multipliers associated with different government expenditure programs differ markedly. The article describes policies that can mitigate precautionary behavior, leading to reduced unemployment. Greater wage flexibility may lead to increased unemployment.","Stiglitz, Joseph E; Guzman, Martin M",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7989232/,498

53268,615 Achieving Net Zero Emission by 2050 – The Medical Education Route,2021-05-04,"Background: Viral infections are a well-recognized cause of subacute thyroiditis (SAT), but other etiologies are occasionally seen. Here we present a case of SAT in a patient receiving chronic tumor necrosis factor inhibitor (TNF-i) therapy. Serum thyroglobulin (Tg) levels in healthy individuals have been reported and range 1.40-29.2ng/mL in males and 1.50-38.5ng/mL. There are no known serum Tg levels of reference in SAT. Clinical Case: A 43-year-old woman with a history of psoriasis treated with adalimumab presented to her primary care physician (PCP) 2 months after her mother had noticed the patient’s new goiter. Patient recalled upper respiratory infection symptoms lasting 1.5 weeks, and subsequent agitation, insomnia, and a low-grade fever preceding the development of goiter. She denied neck compressive symptoms aside from mild dysphagia. She has been treated with adalimumab 40mg subcutaneous injection weekly for psoriasis with good results for the past 3.5 years and was on norethindrone 0.35mg daily for contraception. Her thyroid exam with her PCP revealed a diffuse painless goiter and she was clinically euthyroid. Labs revealed a TSH 1.44mIU/L [0.45-5.33], TT3 104ng/dL [60-181], fT3 3.3pg/mL [2.3-4.2], fT4 0.83ng/dL [0.89-1.76], and Tg 288.7ng/mL [1.6-50]. Thyroid antibodies (Tg, thyroid peroxidase and thyroid stimulating immunoglobulin) were negative. She tested negative for COVID-19. The neck ultrasound showed an enlarged pseudonodular thyroid gland with a heterogenous parenchyma and diffuse hypervascularity bilaterally (right lobe, 7.4 x 2.8 x 3.0 cm; left lobe, 8.4 x 3.2 x 3.6 cm; isthmus, 9 mm). A month later, repeat labs showed TSH 1.56 mIU/L, TT3 85 ng/dL, fT4 0.74 ng/dL, and Tg 231.2 ng/mL. She was subsequently referred to Endocrine Clinic 4 months after her initial presentation. She had a persistent diffuse painless goiter, minimally decreased in size, and she remained clinically euthyroid. Labs included a TSH 1.75 mIU/L and fT4 0.78 ng/dL. Conclusion: There are known associations of SAT with chronic TNF-i therapy in patients with psoriasis. Viral infections are an identified cause, but other triggers in chronic TNF-i therapy may exist. Serum Tg is elevated during SAT, but in this case Tg elevation was very significant. Although normal serum Tg levels are established in healthy individuals, there are no known reference values during SAT. Tg levels should not be used in acute illness period to evaluate illness severity or the resolution of SAT.","Jobira, Beza; Saxon, David; Greca, Amanda La",J Endocr Soc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8135423/,498

We aimed to create and deliver an emergency small group teaching programme throughout the pandemic, targeted at increasing medical student confidence in basic surgical skills and inspiring interest in surgery. METHOD: Multiple small-group teaching sessions were delivered to a cohort of 14 medical students recruited for work during the pandemic, whilst adhering to social distancing and sanitary measures. On completion of the programme and informal assessment of 11 surgical competencies, participants completed a follow up questionnaire to assess their improvement. RESULTS: 70% reported improvement in 10 competencies and 30% across all 11 competencies. The greatest improvements were in abscess drainage and knot tying. 30% relayed increased interest in pursuing a surgical career. 80% were ‘more likely’ to attend theatres in future. CONCLUSIONS: The teaching series facilitated increase in self-perceived confidence of students in basic surgical skills, whilst inspiring surgical interests. During challenging times, we must support learners to undertake activity that drives improvement in training for the wider benefit of health services. Innovative teaching programmes may reduce the impact of similar adversity in the future.","Galloway, R; Amar, H; Panchalingham, V",Br J Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8135951/,498

This manuscript describes our early experience with MRE for the assessment of the presence and staging of liver fibrosis on a 3T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) system. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to describe the MRE physics, procedure, interpretation and drawbacks, along with a few recommendations as per our experience. METHOD: Magnetic resonance elastography was performed on 85 patients with a 3T MRI and the images were analysed both qualitatively and quantitatively. Liver stiffness was assessed by drawing freehand geographic regions of interest on the elastograms to cover the maximum portion of the hepatic parenchyma within the 95% confidence maps on each slice. Correlation with histopathology was performed whenever available. RESULTS: Of the 80 patients who met the inclusion criteria, 41 patients displayed a normal liver stiffness measurement (LSM) and 39 patients had a raised LSM. In the patients who had a raised LSM, 14 patients had Stage I–II fibrosis, 8 patients had Stage II–III fibrosis, 6 patients had Stage III–IV fibrosis, 4 patients had Stage IV fibrosis or cirrhosis and 7 patients had non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. The mean thickness of the waves increased with increasing stages of fibrosis. The waves became gradually darker medially in patients with normal LSM as compared to the patients with raised LSM. Histopathology with METAVIR scoring was available in 46 patients, which agreed with the MRE findings in all except two patients. CONCLUSION: Magnetic resonance elastography is a suitable non-invasive modality for the identification and quantification of hepatic fibrosis.","Joshi, Anagha; Muthe, Mridula M.; Firke, Vikrant; Badgujar, Harshal",SA J Radiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8182447/,498

AIM: to assess the functional capacity of ACKD patients with the Short Physical Performance test Battery (SPPB), and its relationship with the malnutrition-inflammation binomium. METHOD: We have evaluated 216 ACKD patients, 66.2% (143) male. xage 70.85 ?12.01 years, being female older than male (72.58 ?13.19 vs 69.96 ?11.32, p = 0.129). We have determine plasma proteins indicators of nutritional status such as albumin, prealbumin and CRP as a marker of the status of inflammation. And we have applied malnutrition inflamation score (MIS). RESULTS: In the univariate analysis, we found an association between the functionality determined with the test and the age (RR95% 0.866 p = 0.000), sex (RR95% 0.387 p = 0.005). albumin (RR95% 2,222 p = 0.035), prealbumin (RR95% 1.065 p = 0.018), CRP (RR95% 0.733 p = 0.022) and the state nutritional value determined with the MIS scale (RR95% 0.791 p = 0.000). We donot any found any association with DM, transferrin and total lymphocytes. Albumin values were established as 3.8g / dl, and CRP at 1g / dl, obtaining 4 groups: (G1: alb> 3,7-PCR <1, G2: alb> 3,7-PCR> 1, G3: alb <3,7-PCR <1 and G4: alb <3,7-PCR> 1 ).

Sex work, ILOAIDS and the Decent Work Agenda in Ghana",2021-06-21,"The degree of specific ventilatory heterogeneity (spatial unevenness of ventilation) of the lung is a useful marker of early structural lung changes which has the potential to detect early-onset disease. The Inspired Sinewave Test (IST) is an established noninvasive ‘gas-distribution’ type of respiratory test capable of measuring the cardiopulmonary parameters. We developed a simulation-based optimisation for the IST, with a simulation of a realistic heterogeneous lung, namely a lognormal distribution of spatial ventilation and perfusion. We tested this method in datasets from 13 anaesthetised pigs (pre and post-lung injury) and 104 human subjects (32 healthy and 72 COPD subjects). The 72 COPD subjects were classified into four COPD phenotypes based on ‘GOLD’ classification. This method allowed IST to identify and quantify heterogeneity of both ventilation and perfusion, permitting diagnostic distinction between health and disease states. In healthy volunteers, we show a linear relationship between the ventilatory heterogeneity versus age ([Formula: see text] ). In a mechanically ventilated pig, IST ventilatory heterogeneity in noninjured and injured lungs was significantly different (p < 0.0001). Additionally, measured indices could accurately identify patients with COPD (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve is 0.76, p < 0.0001). The IST also could distinguish different phenotypes of COPD with 73% agreement with spirometry.","Tran, M. C.; Nguyen, V.; Bruce, R.; Crockett, D. C.; Formenti, F.; Phan, P. A.; Payne, S.

The purpose of this study was to investigate if nanoradiomics (radiomic analysis of nanoparticle contrast-enhanced images) can differentiate tumors based on TAM burden. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In vivo studies were performed in transgenic mouse models of neuroblastoma with low (N = 11) and high (N = 10) tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) burden. Animals underwent delayed nanoparticle contrast-enhanced CT (n-CECT) imaging at 4 days after intravenous administration of liposomal-iodine agent (1.1 g/kg). CT imaging-derived conventional tumor metrics (tumor volume and CT attenuation) were computed for segmented tumor CT datasets. Nanoradiomic analysis was performed using a PyRadiomics workflow implemented in the quantitative image feature pipeline (QIFP) server containing 900 radiomic features (RFs). RF selection was performed under supervised machine learning using a nonparametric neighborhood component method. A 5-fold validation was performed using a set of linear and nonlinear classifiers for group separation. Statistical analysis was performed using the Kruskal–Wallis test. RESULTS: N-CECT imaging demonstrated heterogeneous patterns of signal enhancement in low and high TAM tumors. CT imaging-derived conventional tumor metrics showed no significant differences (p > 0.05) in tumor volume between low and high TAM tumors. Tumor CT attenuation was not significantly different (p > 0.05) between low and high TAM tumors. Machine learning-augmented nanoradiomic analysis revealed two RFs that differentiated (p < 0.002) low TAM and high TAM tumors. The RFs were used to build a linear classifier that demonstrated very high accuracy and further confirmed by 5-fold cross-validation. CONCLUSIONS: Imaging-derived conventional tumor metrics were unable to differentiate tumors with varying TAM burden; however, nanoradiomic analysis revealed texture differences and enabled differentiation of low and high TAM tumors.","Starosolski, Zbigniew; Courtney, Amy N.; Srivastava, Mayank; Guo, Linjie; Stupin, Igor; Metelitsa, Leonid S.; Annapragada, Ananth; Ghaghada, Ketan B.",Contrast Media Mol Imaging,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8216795/,498

During sending of message two types of attacks are generally seen such as the blackhole attack and the wormhole attack. In this research we have tried to focus on two major attacks such as the black hole and the worm hole attack. In this we have used two types of protocol such as the AODV whose other name is SWBAODV and the scalable-dynamic elliptic curve cryptography. During the use the prime numbers are selected at random. We can also choose certain specific prime number. Moreover the security level does not depend on the size of the key. Keeping A as worm hole and B as the black hole we have made a two dimensional vector function named as F [A, B]. Two types of study is done by us in our research such as the with attack and without attack. In case of no attack study we have shown graphically using the AODV and the in case of attack we have given it as the BAODV and also the WAODV.

Sustainable Development Solutions Network world survey of life satisfaction). HDI consists of per-capita Gross National Income (economic well-being), average life expectancy (proxy for health well-being), and educational attainment (capabilities well-being). Using data on 105 countries representing 95% of the world’s population, a history of grassroots activism (Global Non-violent Action Database), civil liberties and political rights (Freedom Score), political and fiscal decentralization, and voter participation (Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance) correlate with HDI and NHI. Citizen volunteering (Gallup Civic Engagement Index) predicts only NHI. In multivariate analyses, Freedom Score is the most robust predictor of all well-being measures, including income equality. Fiscal decentralization and voter turnout also predict HDI and NHI, controlling for other influences. Based on prior analyses in the Global Development of Applied Community Studies project, implications and recommendations are discussed for developing community human research and professional resources across 12 disciplines in countries where they are needed based on social justice, citizenship, well-being, inequality, human rights, and other development challenges.

The purpose of this study was to examine the pathophysiological characteristics of COVID-19 in patients with sickle cell disease or trait to determine whether these patients have unique manifestations that might require special consideration. This retrospective analysis included 24 patients with confirmed COVID-19 and sickle cell disease or trait who were seen at the Henry Ford Hospital, Detroit, MI, USA, between March 1 and April 15 2020. Of the 24 patients, 18 (75.0%) had heterozygous sickle cell trait, one (4.0%) was a double heterozygote for Hb S (HBB: c.20A>T)/β+-thalassemia (β+-thal), four had sickle cell anemia (βS/βS) and one (4.0%) had Hb S/Hb C (HBB: c.19G>A) disease. A total of 13 (54.0%) patients required hospitalization. All four patients with sickle cell anemia, developed acute pain crisis. We observed one patient who developed acute pulmonary embolism and no patients developed other sickle cell associated complications. Additionally, three (13.0%) patients required packed red blood cell transfusion without the need of exchange transfusion, and one patient required admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), mechanical ventilation and subsequently died. Patients with sickle cell disease or trait and laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 had a generally mild, or unremarkable, course of disease, with lower chances of intubation, ICU admission and death, but with a slightly longer hospitalization.","Balanchivadze, Nino; Kudirka, Adam A; Askar, Sally; Almadhoun, Khaled; Kuriakose, Philip; Fadel, Raef; Dabak, Vrushali",Hemoglobin,https://doi.org/10.1080/03630269.2020.1797775; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32722950/,498

Data from the Gallup World Poll in 2018/2019 wave (N=145,417) were collected in 142 countries using telephone and face to face interviews. We describe differences in frequency of 'scratch' cooking lunch and dinner across the globe by gender. Poisson regression was used to assess predictors of cooking frequency. Associations between disparities in cooking frequency (at the country level) between men and women with perceptions of subjective well-being were assessed using linear regression. Across the globe, cooking frequency varied considerably; dinner was cooked more frequently than lunch; and, women (median frequency 5 meals/week) cooked both meals more frequently than men (median frequency 0 meals/week). At the country level, greater gender disparities in cooking frequency are associated with lower Positive Experience Index scores (-0.021, p=0.009). Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the frequency with which men and women cook meals varied considerably between nations; and, women cooked more frequently than men worldwide. The pandemic, and related 'stay at home' directives have dramatically reshaped the world, and it will be important to monitor changes in the ways and frequency with which people around the world cook and eat; and, how those changes relate to dietary patterns and health outcomes on a national, regional and global level.","Wolfson, Julia A; Ishikawa, Yoshiki; Hosokawa, Chizuru; Janisch, Kate; Massa, Jennifer; Eisenberg, David M",Appetite,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2021.105117; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33460693/,498

For rapid detection of a broad respiratory pathogen spectrum, multiplex real-time PCR is ideal. This study evaluated the performance of the new Luminex NxTAG Respiratory Pathogen Panel (NxTAG-RPP) in comparison with the BioFire FilmArray Respiratory Panel (FA-RP) or singleplex real-time PCR as reference. A total of 284 clinical respiratory specimens and 3 influenza A/H7N9 viral culture samples were tested. All clinical specimens were processed and analyzed in parallel using NxTAG-RPP and the reference standard method. The H7N9 viral culture samples were tested using NxTAG-RPP only. Overall, the NxTAG-RPP demonstrated ≥93% sensitivity and specificity for all respiratory targets except human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43) and HCoV-HKU1. The H7N9 virus was detected by the influenza A virus matrix gene target, while other influenza A virus subtyping gene targets in the panel remained negative. Complete concordance between NxTAG-RPP and FA-RP was observed in 98.8% (318/322) of positive results (kappa = 0.92). Substantial agreement was found for most respiratory targets, but significant differences were observed in human metapneumovirus (P = 0.001) and parainfluenza virus type 3 (P = 0.031). NxTAG-RPP has a higher sample throughput than FA-RP (96 samples versus 1 sample per run) while the turnaround times for NxTAG-RPP and FA-RP were 5 h (up to 96 samples) and 1 h (for one sample), respectively. Overall, NxTAG-RPP demonstrated good diagnostic performance for most respiratory pathogens. The high sample throughput with reasonable turnaround time of this new assay makes it a suitable multiplex platform for routine screening of respiratory specimens in hospital-based laboratories.","Chen, Jonathan H K; Lam, Ho-Yin; Yip, Cyril C Y; Wong, Sally C Y; Chan, Jasper F W; Ma, Edmond S K; Cheng, Vincent C C; Tang, Bone S F; Yuen, Kwok-Yung",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jcm.00517-16; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27122380/,498

Because of the hole on the surface of the PS hollow bead, the contrast agent to be encapsulated could quickly enter the hollow interior via direct flow rather than slow diffusion through the wall. After loading, the hole on the surface is conveniently sealed by annealing the sample at a temperature (e.g., 95 °C) slightly above the glass-transition temperature of PS. In vitro methods are also used to investigate the effectiveness of encapsulation by quantifying the contrast enhancement enabled by the contrast agents.","Bai, Meng-Yi; Moran, Christine H; Zhang, Lei; Liu, Changjun; Zhang, Yu; Wang, Lihong V; Xia, Younan",Advanced functional materials,https://doi.org/10.1002/adfm.201102582; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31866803/,498

The association between SRH and functional disability, defined as certification of the long-term care insurance (LTCI) system, in Japanese elderly community dwellers was examined in this study. METHODS A total of 10,690 individuals (39.5% men, mean age of 71.4 years) who were 65 years of age or more who did not have a history of cardiovascular disease or LTCI certification were followed in this prospective study for 10.5 years. SRH was classified into four categories: good, rather good, neither good nor poor, and poor. A Cox proportional-hazards model was used to determine the hazard ratios (HRs) for the incidence of functional disability among the SRH groups for each sex. RESULTS The number of individuals with functional disability was 3377. Men who rated poor for SRH scored significantly higher for functional disability (HR [95% confidence interval]: poor = 1.74 [1.42, 2.14]) while women who rated rather good, neither good nor poor, and poor scored significantly higher for functional disability (rather good =1.12 [1.00, 1.25], neither good nor poor = 1.29 [1.13, 1.48], poor = 1.92 [1.65, 2.24]: p for trend < 0.001 in both sexes).

65256,A Scoping Review of Anxiety in Young Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder.,2020-09-25,"BACKGROUND Epidemiologic studies identified a 'weekend effect' or 'out-of-hours effect', which implies that procedural and clinical outcomes of patients with stroke, who are admitted out-of-hours, are less favorable than for patients admitted during working-hours. OBJECTIVE To determine (1) whether our procedural times and clinical outcome were affected by an out-of-hours effect and (2) whether the decision in favor of, or against, endovascular stroke treatment (EST) depends on the time of admission. METHODS Between February 2010 and January 2015, 6412 consecutive patients presenting with symptoms of acute ischemic stroke were evaluated for EST eligibility according to established local protocols and generally accepted consensus criteria, and dichotomized into working-hours and out-of-hours cohorts according to admission times. Within both groups, patients given EST were identified and the rate of treatment decision, procedural times, and clinical outcome were compared and analyzed. RESULTS Clinical and radiological features of patients admitted in working-hours and out-of-hours did not differ significantly. Procedural times and clinical outcome were not affected by an out-of-hours effect (p≥0.054). 221/240 (92.1%) out-of-hours patients and 154/166 (92.8%) working-hours patients who were eligible for EST were transferred to the angiography suite for EST (p=0.798). The rationale not to treat patients who were eligible for EST did not differ between working-hours and out-of-hours admission (p=0.756). CONCLUSIONS It is possible to produce competitive procedural times regardless of the time of admission and to prevent a treatment decision bias when standard operating procedures are applied consistently.","Nikoubashman, Omid; Probst, Thomas; Schürmann, Kolja; Othman, Ahmed E; Matz, Oliver; Brockmann, Marc-Alexander; Müller, Marguerite; Wiesmann, Martin; Reich, Arno",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2015-012220; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26992412/,498
65370,Addressing Stress in High School Students During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,2021-03-17,"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-associated mortality in the United States. Kinase hyperactivation is a known mechanism of tumorigenesis. The phosphorylation status of the plasma membrane-associated protein myristoylated alanine rich C-kinase substrate (MARCKS) effector domain (ED) was previously established as being important in the sensitivity of lung cancer to radiation. Specifically, when MARCKS ED was in a non-phosphorylated state, lung cancer cells were more susceptible to ionizing radiation and experienced prolonged double-strand DNA breaks. Additional studies demonstrated that the phosphorylation status of MARCKS ED is important for gene expression and in vivo tumor growth. The present study used a peptide mimetic of MARCKS ED as a therapeutic intervention to modulate MARCKS phosphorylation. Culturing A549, H1792 and H1975 lung cancer cell lines with the MARCKS ED peptide led to reduced levels of phosphorylated MARCKS and phosphorylated Akt serine/threonine kinase 1. Further investigation demonstrated that the peptide therapy was able to reduce lung cancer cell proliferation and increase radiation sensitivity. In addition, the MARCKS peptide therapy was able to prolong double-strand DNA breaks following ionizing radiation exposure. The results of the present study demonstrate that a peptide mimetic of MARCKS ED is able to modulate MARCKS phosphorylation, leading to an increase in sensitivity to radiation.","Rohrbach, Timothy D; Jones, Robert B; Hicks, Patricia H; Weaver, Alice N; Cooper, Tiffiny S; Eustace, Nicholas J; Yang, Eddy S; Jarboe, John S; Anderson, Joshua C; Willey, Christopher D",Oncology letters,https://doi.org/10.3892/ol.2016.5550; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28454237/,498

Methods A retrospective analysis was performed on 33 patients who underwent closed reduction and PFNA fixation for high plane intertrochanteric femur fracture between January 2016 and June 2019. There were 12 males and 21 females with an average age of 75.1 years (mean, 47-89 years). The fractures were caused by falling from height in 21 cases, by traffic accident in 7 cases, and by other injuries in 5 cases. Fractures were classified as type A in 14 cases and type B in 19 cases according to self-defined fracture classification criteria; and as type 31-A1.2 in 14 cases and as type 31-A2.2 in 19 cases according to AO/Orthopedic Trauma Association (AO/OTA) classification criteria. The time from injury to operation was 2-5 days (mean, 2.7 days). The operation time, intraoperative blood loss, hospital stay, fracture reduction quality, fracture healing time, internal fixation failure, and Parker-Palmer score were recorded. Results The operation time was 40-75 minutes (mean, 55 minutes). The intraoperative blood loss was 50-150 mL (mean, 64 mL). The hospital stay was 5-15 days (mean, 8.7 days). All incisions healed by first intention. Twenty-eight patients were followed up 12-18 months with an average of 13.6 months. The fracture reduction quality was rated as excellent in 9 cases (32.1%), good in 17 cases (60.7%), and poor in 2 cases (7.1%) by Chang's criteria. Parker-Palmer score was 6-9 (mean, 7.9) at last follow-up. Conclusion High plane intertrochanteric femur fracture is a special type of intertrochanteric fracture, which can be diagnosed by imaging examination.

68154,Online Social Connection as a Buffer of Health Anxiety and Isolation During COVID-19.,2021-02-18,"Acupuncture promotes the recovery of neurological function by the overall improvement of ischemic brain injury. It is not only regarded as a rehabilitative treatment but also a pretreatment method for stroke. However, its mechanism has not been fully elucidated. In this study, rats were treated with electroacupuncture (EA) at Baihui (GV20) for 30 min/day for 6 days, ahead of conducting cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. Infarction volume, Evans blue leakage, and neurological deficits were evaluated at 24 h after I/R injury. Then, the ipsilateral ischemic brain was isolated for RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) to identify molecular consequences. The results showed that EA pretreatment decreased blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, reduced brain infarction volume, and improved neurological outcomes. EA pretreatment could upregulate expression of antivirus and immunity activity-associated genes (such as Ifit1, Ifit3, Irf7, and Oasla) and downregulate expression of matrix disruption-associated genes (Col24a1, Col11a1, Col27a1, etc.) in healthy rats. In addition, it could partially reverse or ameliorate genome-wide transcription changes of the ipsilateral ischemic brain. For the first time, this study provides insight into genomic network modulation of a healthy rat with EA treatment and a EA-preconditioned rat under subsequent I/R injury, which is helpful in explaining acupuncture precondition-induced ischemic tolerance of stroke. It also provides new strategies and targets for the prevention of ischemic stroke.","Fu, Shuping; Yu, Meiling; Xu, Houxi; Liu, Qing; Li, Xiaoxiao; Wang, Yaling; Chen, Yonglin; Meng, Lingling; Qiu, Yiting; Jing, Xinyue; Liu, Chenchen; Lu, Shengfeng",Frontiers in genetics,https://doi.org/10.3389/fgene.2021.719201; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34484305/,498
68645,Meeting the Challenges of COVID-19 at the Close of 2020.,2020,"PURPOSE Few advancements in treating limited-stage small cell lung cancer (LS-SCLC) have been made in decades. We report here a phase I/II trial of concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CRT) and pembrolizumab. METHODS This single-center, open-label phase I/II study recruited adults with LS-SCLC or other neuroendocrine tumors and good performance status (ECOG ≤2). The primary endpoint was safety, as assessed by dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs). Concurrent CRT consisted of etoposide and a platin with 45 Gy radiotherapy (30 BID). Prophylactic cranial irradiation (25 Gy, 10 fractions) was given at the physician's discretion. Pembrolizumab was started concurrently with CRT and continued for up to 16 cycles. The phase I portion consisted of a 3+3 design. Toxicity was assessed with CTCAE v4.0. Secondary outcomes were progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and tumor response as measured by the IRRC. RESULTS Forty-five patients were screened and 40 were enrolled. All completed RT and received ≥1 cycle of pembrolizumab. Twenty-seven (61%) received PCI. One DLT was observed in the phase I portion. There were no grade 5 toxicities, and three grade 4 events (2 neutropenia, 1 respiratory failure). The pneumonitis rate was 15% (three grade 2 and three grade 3). All 17 (42.5%) esophagitis events were grades 1-2. At median follow-up time of 23.1 months, the median PFS time was 19.7 months (95% confidence interval [CI] 8.8‒30.5) and median OS time was 39.5 months (95% CI 8.0‒71.0).

69255,Impact of COVID-19 on dental education in the United States.,2020-04-27,"Nasopharyngeal swabs (NPSs) are being widely used as specimens for multiplex real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR for respiratory virus detection. However, it remains unclear whether NPS specimens are optimal for all viruses targeted by multiplex RT-PCR. In addition, the procedure to obtain NPS specimens causes coughing in most patients, which possibly increases the risk of nosocomial spread of viruses. In this study, paired NPS and saliva specimens were collected from 236 adult male patients with suspected acute respiratory illnesses. Specimens were tested for 16 respiratory viruses by multiplex real-time RT-PCR. Among the specimens collected from the 236 patients, at least 1 respiratory virus was detected in 183 NPS specimens (77.5%) and 180 saliva specimens (76.3%). The rates of detection of respiratory viruses were comparable for NPS and saliva specimens (P = 0.766). Nine virus species and 349 viruses were isolated, 256 from NPS specimens and 273 from saliva specimens (P = 0.1574). Adenovirus was detected more frequently in saliva samples (P < 0.0001), whereas influenza virus type A and human rhinovirus were detected more frequently in NPS specimens (P = 0.0001 and P = 0.0289, respectively). The possibility of false-positive adenovirus detection from saliva samples was excluded by direct sequencing. In conclusion, neither of the sampling methods was consistently more sensitive than the other. We suggest that these cost-effective methods for detecting respiratory viruses in mixed NPS-saliva specimens might be valuable for future studies.","Kim, Young-Gon; Yun, Seung Gyu; Kim, Min Young; Park, Kwisung; Cho, Chi Hyun; Yoon, Soo Young; Nam, Myung Hyun; Lee, Chang Kyu; Cho, Yun-Jung; Lim, Chae Seung",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jcm.01704-16; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27807150/,498

Organizational change and change-oriented leadership in hospitals.,2020-08-25,"To study concepts that are coded in language, researchers often collect lists of conceptual properties produced by human subjects. From these data, different measures can be computed. In particular, inter-concept similarity is an important variable used in experimental studies. Among possible similarity measures, the cosine of conceptual property frequency vectors seems to be a de facto standard. However, there is a lack of comparative studies that test the merit of different similarity measures when computed from property frequency data. The current work compares four different similarity measures (cosine, correlation, Euclidean and Chebyshev) and five different types of data structures. To that end, we compared the informational content (i.e., entropy) delivered by each of those 4 × 5 = 20 combinations, and used a clustering procedure as a concrete example of how informational content affects statistical analyses. Our results lead us to conclude that similarity measures computed from lower-dimensional data fare better than those calculated from higher-dimensional data, and suggest that researchers should be more aware of data sparseness and dimensionality, and their consequences for statistical analyses.","Canessa, Enrique; Chaigneau, Sergio E; Moreno, Sebastián; Lagos, Rodrigo",Cognitive processing,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10339-020-00985-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32647948/,498

OBJECTIVE To compare the immune response and safety after a Tdap booster in 26 jSLE patients and 26 matched healthy adolescents.Methodology: Adverse events and disease activity were evaluated. Lymphocyte immunophenotyping was performed by flow cytometry. Tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis toxin antibodies were assessed by ELISA; whole blood was stimulated with whole cell pertussis and supernatants were assessed for cytokines by xMAP. RESULTS Both groups showed a similar frequency of adverse events. There was no evidence of disease reactivation after Tdap booster in the jSLE cohort. Both groups showed a significant increase in antibody titers for all three antigens on D14 and D28 (p < 0.001). jSLE patients had a significantly lower increase in diphtheria titers than the control group (p = 0.007). jSLE patients had a distinct titer increase of tetanus and pertussis antibodies when compared to controls (p = 0.004 and p < 0.001, respectively). There was a lower frequency of pertussis seroconversion in the jSLE group on D14 (p = 0.009), D28 (p = 0.023), D12m (p = 0.015) and D24m (p = 0.004). Cellular immune response to Bordetella pertussis showed significantly lower levels of IFNγ (p < 0.001) and higher levels of IL10, IL12, IL21 and TNFα in jSLE patients than controls. CONCLUSIONS jSLE patients had good response to Tdap booster dose for the tetanus antigen, but not for diphtheria and pertussis. This vaccine was safe in relation to adverse events and absence of disease reactivation.","Peracchi, Octávio Ab; Nicácio, Aline Alencar Mf; Yamada, Juliana; Len, Claudio Arnaldo; Moraes-Pinto, Maria Isabel de; Terreri, Maria Teresa",Lupus,https://doi.org/10.1177/0961203320973263; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33197362/,498

METHODS 396 residents from seven NHs suffering a SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 (VOC-α) outbreak at least 14 days after a vaccine campaign were repeatedly tested using SARS-CoV-2 real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction on nasopharyngeal swab test (RT-qPCR). SARS-CoV-2 Receptor-Binding Domain (RBD) of the S1 subunit (RBD-IgG) was measured in all residents. Nucleocapsid antigenemia (N-Ag) was measured in RT-qPCR-positive residents, and serum neutralizing antibodies in vaccinated residents from one NH. RESULTS The incidence of positive RT-qPCR was lower in residents vaccinated by two doses (72/317; 22.7%) vs one dose (10/31; 32.3%) or non-vaccinated residents (21/48; 43.7%)(p<0.01). COVID-19-induced deaths were observed in 5 of the 48 non-vaccinated residents (10.4%), in 2 of the 31 who had received one dose (6.4%), and in 3 of the 317 (0.9%) who had received two doses (p=0.0007). Severe symptoms were more common in infected non-vaccinated residents (10/21; 47.6%) than in infected vaccinated residents (15/72; 21.0%)(p=0.002). Higher levels of RBD-IgG (n=325) were associated with a lower SARS-CoV-2 incidence. No in vitro serum neutralization activity was found for RBD-IgG levels below 1,050 AU/mL. RBD-IgG levels were inversely associated with N-Ag levels, found as a risk factor of severe COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS Two BNT162b2/Pfizer doses are associated with a 48% reduction of SARS-CoV-2 incidence and a 91.3% reduction of death risk in residents from NHs facing a VOC-α outbreak. Post-vaccine RBD-IgG levels correlate with BNT162b2/Pfizer protection against SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7.","Blain, Hubert; Tuaillon, Edouard; Gamon, Lucie; Pisoni, Amandine; Miot, Stéphanie; Delpui, Valentin; Si-Mohamed, Nejm; Niel, Clémence; Rolland, Yves; Montes, Brigitte; Groc, Soraya; Rafasse, Sophia; Dupuy, Anne-Marie; Gros, Nathalie; Muriaux, Delphine; Picot, Marie-Christine; Bousquet, Jean",Allergy,https://doi.org/10.1111/all.15142; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34652831/,498

DESIGN Two-group, randomized, controlled clinical design. SETTING An academic cancer infusion center in the western United States. SAMPLE 136 hematologic outpatients with cancer or other malignancies. METHODS Participants were randomly assigned to dry or moist heat with warmed towels wrapped around each patient's arm for seven minutes prior to IV insertion. Skin and room temperatures were monitored pre- and postwarming. Two experienced chemotherapy infusion nurses performed the venipunctures according to protocol. Outcomes were examined using variance analysis, with 34 patients for each combination of nurse and heat type. MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES Number of IV insertion attempts, time to achieve IV insertion postheating, patient anxiety levels pre- and postheating, and patient comfort. FINDINGS Dry heat was 2.7 times more likely than moist heat to result in successful IV insertion on the first attempt, had significantly lower insertion times, and was more comfortable. Heat type had no effect on patient anxiety. CONCLUSIONS Dry heat application decreases the likelihood of multiple IV insertion attempts and procedure time and is comfortable, safe, and economical to use in an outpatient oncology setting.","Fink, Regina M; Hjort, Ellen; Wenger, Barbara; Cook, Paul F; Cunningham, Mary; Orf, Aimee; Pare, Wendy; Zwink, Jennifer",Oncology nursing forum,https://doi.org/10.1188/09.onf.e198-e204; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19581223/,498

Current drug therapy requires a combination of antibiotics taken over >6 months. An urgent need for new agents that can shorten therapy is required. In order to develop new drugs, simple in vitro assays are required that can identify efficacious compounds rapidly and predict in vivo activity in the human.Areas covered: This review focusses on the most relevant in vitro assays that can be utilized in a drug discovery program and which mimic different aspects of infection or disease. The focus is largely on assays used to test >1000s of compounds reliably and robustly. However, some assays used for 10s to 100s of compounds are included where the utility outweighs the low capacity. Literature searches for high throughput screening, models and in vitro assays were undertaken.Expert opinion: Drug discovery and development in tuberculosis is extremely challenging due to the requirement for predicting drug efficacy in a disease with complex pathology in which bacteria exist in heterogeneous states in inaccesible locations. A combination of assays can be used to determine profiles against replicating, non-replicating, intracellular and tolerant bacteria.","Parish, Tanya",Expert opinion on drug discovery,https://doi.org/10.1080/17460441.2020.1707801; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31899974/,498

OBJECTIVES This study sought to characterize the determinants and consequences of PDB after PCI. METHODS The prospective ADAPT-DES (Assessment of Dual Antiplatelet Therapy With Drug-Eluting Stents) study was used to determine the incidence and predictors of clinically relevant bleeding events occurring within 2 years after hospital discharge. The effect of PDB on subsequent 2-year all-cause mortality was estimated by time-adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression. RESULTS Among 8,582 ""all-comers"" who underwent successful PCI with DES in the ADAPT-DES study, PDB occurred in 535 of 8,577 hospital survivors (6.2%) at a median time of 300 days (interquartile range: 130 to 509 days) post-discharge. Gastrointestinal bleeding (61.7%) was the most frequent source of PDB. Predictors of PDB included older age, lower baseline hemoglobin, lower platelet reactivity on clopidogrel, and use of chronic oral anticoagulation therapy. PDB was associated with higher crude rates of all-cause mortality (13.0% vs. 3.2%; p < 0.0001). Following multivariable adjustment, PDB was strongly associated with 2-year mortality (hazard ratio [HR]: 5.03; p < 0.0001), with an effect size greater than that of post-discharge myocardial infarction (PDMI) (HR: 1.92; p = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS After successful PCI with DES in an unrestricted patient population, PDB is not uncommon and has a strong relationship with subsequent all-cause mortality, greater that that associated with PDMI.

We show that a multiplex IF and ISH (mIFISH) assay is feasible to identify the cellular source of cytokines and chemokines (tumor necrosis factor-α, interferon-γ, and CXCL9) in FFPE transplant kidney biopsies and that quantification of the mRNA and protein signal is also possible at single-cell resolution in the context of tissue complexity. Furthermore, the mIFISH assay allows precise quantitative assessment of tubulitis, one of the key morphological correlates of alloimmune injury. Simultaneous in situ identification and quantification of multiple cellular phenotypes and mRNA expression of proinflammatory cytokines in FFPE tissues offer a novel insight into the biology of alloimmune injury in kidney transplantation and may contribute to improved diagnostic accuracy and patient care.","Junger, Henrik; Dobi, Dejan; Chen, Adeline; Lee, Linda; Vasquez, Joshua J; Tang, Qizhi; Laszik, Zoltan G",The journal of histochemistry and cytochemistry : official journal of the Histochemistry Society,https://doi.org/10.1369/0022155420935401; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32609561/,498

87208,Pharmacists' experiences and views on providing screening services: An international comparison.,2020-07-30,"BACKGROUND Globally, health systems have been struggling to cope with the increasing burden of chronic diseases and respond to associated patient needs. Integrated care (IC) for chronic diseases offers solutions, but implementing these new models requires multi-stakeholder action and integrated policies to address social, organisational, and financial barriers. Policy implementation for IC has been little studied, especially through a political lens. This paper examines how IC policies in Belgium were developed over the last decade and how stakeholders have played a role in these policies. METHODS We used a case study design. After an exploratory document review, we selected three IC policies. We then interviewed 25 key stakeholders in the field of IC. The stakeholder analysis entailed a detailed mapping of the stakeholders' power, position, and interest related to the three selected policies. Interview participants included policy-makers, civil servants (from ministry of health and health insurance), representatives of health professionals' associations, academics, and patient organisations. Additionally, a processual analysis of IC policy processes (2007-2020) through literature review was used to frame the interviews by means of a chronic care policy timeline. RESULTS In Belgium, a variety of policy initiatives have been developed in recent years both at central and decentralised levels. The power analysis and policy position maps exposed tensions between federal and federated governments in terms of overlapping competence, as well as the implications of the power shift from federal to federated levels as a consequence of the 2014 state reform. CONCLUSION The 2014 partial decentralisation of healthcare has created fragmentation of decisive power which undermines efforts towards IC. This political trend towards fragmentation is at odds with the need for IC. Further research is needed on how public health policy competences and reform durability of IC policies will evolve.","Martens, Monika; Danhieux, Katrien; Van Belle, Sara; Wouters, Edwin; Van Damme, Wim; Remmen, Roy; Anthierens, Sibyl; Van Olmen, Josefien",International journal of health policy and management,https://doi.org/10.34172/ijhpm.2021.58; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34273935/,498

The Cerebral State Monitor is one of several electroencephalogram monitors that reflects level of consciousness of patients during anesthesia. The monitor reports level of consciousness with the empirical parameter Cerebral State Index (CSI) on a 0-100 scale. In this patient-controlled prospective pilot study, we compared the CSI measured from the surgical and control hemispheres of patients undergoing CEA surgery to determine whether the parameter is affected by presumed changes in cerebral blood flow. METHODS Fifteen consenting CEA patients entered this institutionally approved study. We connected a separate Cerebral State Monitor to the left and right sides of the patient's head and recorded CSI intraoperatively. We compared the control-side data with the surgical-side data. RESULTS Clamping caused the surgical-side CSI to drop below the control-side CSI. Shunt activation caused the CSI to rise above the control. The greatest difference between the surgical-side CSI and control-side CSI occurred at the completion of the CEA procedure. These observed trends were not statistically significant in this pilot project. CONCLUSION Our preliminary results suggest that the CSI, and perhaps other similar indexes, may indicate changes in cerebral blood flow acutely during CEA.

90394,Challenges and Lessons Amid the COVID-19 Pandemic at One College of Pharmacy.,2020-06-01,"Several theories of motor control posit that the nervous system has access to a neural representation of muscle dynamics. Yet, this has not been tested experimentally. Should such a representation exist, it was hypothesized that subjects who learned to control a virtual limb using virtual muscles would improve performance faster and show greater generalization than those who learned with a less dynamically complex virtual force generator. Healthy adults practiced using their biceps brachii activity to move a myoelectrically controlled virtual limb from rest to a standard target position with maximum speed and accuracy. Throughout practice, generalization was assessed with untrained target trials and sensitivity to actuator dynamics was probed by unexpected actuator model switches. In a muscle model subject group (n = 10), the biceps electromyographic signal activated a virtual muscle that pulled on the virtual limb with a force governed by muscle dynamics, defined by a nonlinear force-length-velocity relation and series elastic stiffness. A force generator group (n = 10) performed the same task, but the actuation force was a linear function of the biceps activation signal. Both groups made significant errors with unexpected actuator dynamics switches, supporting task sensitivity to actuator dynamics. The muscle model group improved performance as fast as the force generator group and showed greater generalization in early practice, despite using an actuator with more complex dynamics. These results are consistent with a preexisting neural representation of muscle dynamics, which may have offset any learning challenges associated with the more dynamically complex virtual muscle model.","Hasson, Christopher J",Experimental brain research,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00221-014-3901-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24668129/,498

Given the risk of rapid transmission in these settings, it is important to know what guidance existed for responding to COVID-19 in the early stages of the pandemic. We sought to identify, collate, and summarise guidance for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in custodial settings in the first six months of 2020. We conducted a systematic search of peer-reviewed and grey literature, and manually searched relevant websites to identify publications up to 30 June 2020 outlining recommendations to prevent and/or control COVID-19 in custodial settings. We inductively developed a coding framework and assessed recommendations using conventional content analysis. RESULTS We identified 201 eligible publications containing 374 unique recommendations across 19 domains including: preparedness; physical environments; case identification, screening, and management; communication; external access and visitation; psychological and emotional support; recreation, legal, and health service adaptation; decarceration; release and community reintegration; workforce logistics; surveillance and information sharing; independent monitoring; compensatory measures; lifting control measures; evaluation; and key populations/settings. We identified few conflicting recommendations. CONCLUSIONS The breadth of recommendations identified in this review reflects the complexity of COVID-19 response in custodial settings. Despite the availability of comprehensive guidance early in the pandemic, important gaps remain in the implementation of recommended prevention and control measures globally, and in the availability of evidence assessing their effectiveness on reducing COVID-19 disease, impact on people in custody and staff, and implementation.","Pearce, Lindsay A; Vaisey, Alaina; Keen, Claire; Calais-Ferreira, Lucas; Foulds, James A; Young, Jesse T; Southalan, Louise; Borschmann, Rohan; Gray, Ruth; Stürup-Toft, Sunita; Kinner, Stuart A",Health & justice,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40352-021-00150-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34652519/,498

Its role in deeply sedated patients is limited. This study was designed to investigate the efficacy and safety of CO2 insufflation during colonoscopy in patients deeply sedated with propofol. METHODS A total of 125 continuous patients were randomly assigned to receive either CO2 (n = 63) or air (n = 62) insufflation during propofol-sedated colonoscopy. Postcolonoscopy abdominal pain, distention, and satisfaction were assessed at 1, 3, and 24 h after the procedure, and the proportions of pain-free and distention-free patients were compared. Residual bowel gas in the colon and small bowel was evaluated at 1 h after colonoscopy. End-tidal CO2 and O2 saturation was measured for safety analysis. RESULTS There was a significant difference between the two groups regarding the postcolonoscopy abdominal pain, distention, and subjective satisfaction at 1 h (P < 0.001) and 3 h (P < 0.01) after the procedure. Patients' pain and distention at 1 and 3 h after the procedure were significantly lower in the CO2 group (P < 0.01). Residual bowel gas in the colon and small bowel was significantly less in the CO2 group (P < 0.001).

The herd was in strict cohabitation with a group of domestic sheep. The calf displayed clinical signs that resembled the acute form of MCF and, after a few days of antibiotic and anti inflammatory therapy, died in September 2016. The diagnosis was confirmed in vivo in blood by detection of ovine herpesvirus type 2 DNA through real‑time PCR. At necropsy, the gross post‑mortem findings were typical of MCF and the histological and molecular assays confirmed the presence of the virus. The sheep flock was suspected to be the source of the infection. In Italy, as well as in Europe, there is little data regarding the epidemiology and the recurrence of the disease in herds of cattle, due to the lack of an active surveillance plan and to a major consideration of MCF between differential diagnosis.","Pesca, Cristina; Gobbi, Marco; Palombi, Claudio; Forte, Claudio; Pavone, Silvia; Stazi, Marica; Pela, Michela; Cruciani, Deborah; D'Avino, Nicoletta",Veterinaria italiana,https://doi.org/10.12834/vetit.1708.9037.4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31599554/,498

95404,'Evidence' within local authority decision making.,2021-03-01,"The combination of radionuclide-based imaging modalities such as single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET) with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is likely to become the next generation of clinical scanners. Hence, there is a growing interest in the development of SPECT- and PET-MRI agents. To this end, we report a new class of dual-modality imaging agents based on the conjugation of radiolabeled bisphosphonates (BP) directly to the surface of superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) nanoparticles. We demonstrate the high potential of BP-iron oxide conjugation using (⁹⁹m)Tc-dipicolylamine(DPA)-alendronate, a BP-SPECT agent, and Endorem/Feridex, a liver MRI contrast agent based on SPIO. The labeling of SPIOs with (⁹⁹m)Tc-DPA-alendronate can be performed in one step at room temperature if the SPIO is not coated with an organic polymer. Heating is needed if the nanoparticles are coated, as long as the coating is weakly bound as in the case of dextran in Endorem. The size of the radiolabeled Endorem (⁹⁹m)Tc-DPA-ale-Endorem) was characterized by TEM (5 nm, Fe₃O₄ core) and DLS (106 ± 60 nm, Fe₃O₄ core + dextran). EDX, Dittmer-Lester, and radiolabeling studies demonstrate that the BP is bound to the nanoparticles and that it binds to the Fe₃O₄ cores of Endorem, and not its dextran coating. The bimodal imaging capabilities and excellent stability of these nanoparticles were confirmed using MRI and nanoSPECT-CT imaging, showing that (⁹⁹m)Tc and Endorem co-localize in the liver and spleen In Vivo, as expected for particles of the composition and size of (⁹⁹m)Tc-DPA-ale-Endorem. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of radiolabeling SPIOs with BP conjugates and the first example of radiolabeling SPIO nanoparticles directly onto the surface of the iron oxide core, and not its coating. This work lays down the basis for a new generation of SPECT/PET-MR imaging agents in which the BP group could be used to attach functionality to provide targeting, stealth/stability, and radionuclides to Fe₃O₄ nanoparticles using very simple methodology readily amenable to GMP.","Torres Martin de Rosales, Rafael; Tavaré, Richard; Glaria, Arnaud; Varma, Gopal; Protti, Andrea; Blower, Philip J",Bioconjugate chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1021/bc100483k; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21338098/,498

An alternative laparoscopic method for the castration of horses with descended testes was developed. OBJECTIVES To report the results of laparoscopy-assisted abdominal transection of the spermatic cord and a modified open method in the standing horse for castration of descended testes in unilateral abdominal cryptorchids. STUDY DESIGN Descriptive case series. METHODS Fifteen unilateral abdominal cryptorchids were castrated laparoscopically by performing intra-abdominal ligation of both spermatic cords. The spermatic cord of the cryptorchid testis was not transected. After intra-abdominal transection of the spermatic cord of the descended testis, the testis was removed by an open castration technique in the standing horse. Data collected included time taken to perform the surgical procedure, surgical complications and post-operative recovery. RESULTS Abdominal testes were located on the right side in eight horses and on the left in seven. The surgical procedure was easy to perform and few intra- or post-operative complications were seen. Pulse and respiration rates and rectal temperatures remained within normal limits during the evaluation period in all but one animal, which displayed transient pyrexia. The scrotal and laparoscopic incisional wounds healed well without any signs of swelling or exudate. In one Warmblood, there was prolapse of subcutaneous tissue the day after surgery, which retracted in 3 days. The owners were contacted by telephone at 2-3 months after discharge. Post-operative recovery had been uneventful in all horses. MAIN LIMITATIONS This study included a small number of cases in which all surgeries were performed by or under the supervision of the same surgeon. Follow-up was limited to telephone reports from owners. CONCLUSIONS A laparoscopic technique that is combined with an open scrotal incision to remove the descended testis in the standing horse was developed and shown to be a safe and reliable option for the castration of unilateral abdominal cryptorchids.","Rijkenhuizen, A B M; van der Harst, M R",Equine veterinary journal,https://doi.org/10.1111/evj.12681; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28295560/,498

97705,[Sustainable and efficient cooperation to protect residents from the COVID-19 epidemic].,2020-12-01,"Alphaviruses are an important cause of mosquito-borne outbreaks of arthritis, rash, and encephalomyelitis. Previous studies in mice with a virulent strain (neuroadapted SINV [NSV]) of the alphavirus Sindbis virus (SINV) identified a role for Th17 cells and regulation by interleukin-10 (IL-10) in the pathogenesis of fatal encephalomyelitis (K. A. Kulcsar, V. K. Baxter, I. P. Greene, and D. E. Griffin, Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 111:16053-16058, 2014, https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1418966111). To determine the role of virus virulence in generation of immune responses, we analyzed the modulatory effects of IL-10 on disease severity, virus clearance, and the CD4+ T cell response to infection with a recombinant strain of SINV of intermediate virulence (TE12). The absence of IL-10 during TE12 infection led to longer morbidity, more weight loss, higher mortality, and slower viral clearance than in wild-type mice. More severe disease and impaired virus clearance in IL-10-/- mice were associated with more Th1 cells, fewer Th2 cells, innate lymphoid type 2 cells, regulatory cells, and B cells, and delayed production of antiviral antibody in the central nervous system (CNS) without an effect on Th17 cells. Therefore, IL-10 deficiency led to more severe disease in TE12-infected mice by increasing Th1 cells and by hampering development of the local B cell responses necessary for rapid production of antiviral antibody and virus clearance from the CNS. In addition, the shift from Th17 to Th1 responses with decreased virus virulence indicates that the effects of IL-10 deficiency on immunopathologic responses in the CNS during alphavirus infection are influenced by virus strain.IMPORTANCE Alphaviruses cause mosquito-borne outbreaks of encephalomyelitis, but determinants of outcome are incompletely understood. We analyzed the effects of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 on disease severity and virus clearance after infection with an alphavirus strain of intermediate virulence. The absence of IL-10 led to longer illness, more weight loss, more death, and slower viral clearance than in mice that produced IL-10. IL-10 influenced development of disease-causing T cells and entry into the brain of B cells producing antiviral antibody. The Th1 pathogenic cell subtype that developed in IL-10-deficient mice infected with a less virulent virus was distinct from the Th17 subtype that developed in response to a more virulent virus, indicating a role for virus strain in determining the immune response. Slow production of antibody in the nervous system led to delayed virus clearance. Therefore, both the virus strain and the host response to infection are important determinants of outcome.","Martin, Nina M; Griffin, Diane E",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01517-17; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29263262/,498
98441,Measuring perceived mistreatment across diverse social groups: An evaluation of the Everyday Discrimination Scale.,2019,"BACKGROUND The impact of various aerosol delivery devices on patient outcomes during mechanical ventilation is unknown. If one method of delivery results in a higher ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) rate than another, multiple patient outcomes may be affected. This study aimed to determine whether there was a difference in VAP occurrence and patient outcomes (days receiving ventilation and in-hospital mortality) between the vibrating mesh nebulizer (AeroNeb Solo) and the metered-dose inhaler (MDI). METHODS This retrospective study reviewed medical records for all mechanically ventilated, adult patients with an order for aerosol treatment from August 2011 to August 2013. The hospital converted from MDI to vibrating mesh nebulizers in August 2012, and data were gathered 1 y before/after conversion. Excluded were patients with a tracheostomy, patients who were mechanically ventilated for <24 h, patients who received a combination of nebulizer and MDI treatments, or patients who were re-intubated. RESULTS Two hundred twenty-eight subjects were included. Forty-eight (21%) received treatment with an MDI, and 180 (79%) were treated with the vibrating mesh nebulizer. Descriptive data did not significantly differ for age or APACHE II (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II) scores between the groups but did for sex (P = .03). Difference in median days receiving ventilation for the MDI (5 d, interquartile range 3.0-8.5 d) and the vibrating mesh nebulizer (6 d, interquartile range 4.0-10.0 d) was not statistically significant. No correlation was found between the use of either device and the primary outcomes of VAP and in-hospital mortality. In multivariable logistic regression analysis, the number of days receiving ventilation increased the odds of VAP (odds ratio [OR] 1.3, 95% CI 1.14-1.49, P < .001) and mortality (OR 1.12, 95% CI 1.04-1.21, P = .002). Higher APACHE II scores increased the odds of mortality (OR 1.05, 95% CI 1.001-1.092, P = .044). CONCLUSION We found no association between an MDI or vibrating mesh nebulizer and our primary outcomes, days receiving ventilation, in-hospital mortality, or VAP, in mechanically ventilated subjects.","Dubosky, Meagan N; Chen, Yi-Fan; Henriksen, Mary E; Vines, David L",Respiratory care,https://doi.org/10.4187/respcare.04823; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28073994/,498

98943,Guiding principles for undergraduate medical education in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic.,2020-11-03,"Today, immune compromised interferon-α-receptor deficient mice expressing hCD46 (IFNARCD46tg) are usually used for measles virus (MV) based vaccine characterization. However, for the development of MV-based recombinant vaccine candidates (rMV), an immune competent mouse model is desirable in order to induce and evaluate meaningful immune response. In this study, humoral and cellular immune response induced by rMV in immune competent mice expressing human MV receptor CD46 (hCD46tg) were compared with those induced in wild-type black/6, and IFNARCD46tg mice. All three strains developed humoral and cellular response against MV, whereas only hCD46tg and IFNARCD46tg mice developed a humoral response against the transgene. Differences were observed in the magnitude of the response, where the IFNARCD46tg mice displayed the strongest immune responses, followed by the hCD46tg mice and the black/6 mice. Interestingly, hCD46tg and wt black/6 mice showed a predominant CD4(+) T-cell response against MV-N, whereas IFNARCD46tg mice developed both, CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cell response against MV-N. Analysis of the cytokine profile of MV-N specific CD4(+) T-cells and transgene (SIVgag) specific CD8(+) T-cells revealed qualitative differences of the T-cell responses; noticeably a significant reduction of the frequency of CD4(+)IL-2(+) expressing cells in IFNARCD46tg mice as compared with hCD46tg or wt black/6 mice. We show in this study significant quantitative and qualitative differences in immune responses between immune competent and immune-compromised mice. Our results therefore highlight the importance of the animal model and support the use of hCD46tg mice as mouse model for the characterization of the immunological profile induced by recombinant measles virus vaccine candidates.","Marty, René R; Knuchel, Marlyse C; Morin, Teldja Neige Azzouz; Naim, Hussein Y",Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,https://doi.org/10.4161/hv.34358; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25483519/,498

METHODS The CHR was determined in eight runners (mean ± SD; age = 24 ± 3 years) from a series of four exhaustive, constant velocity runs. The RPE, velocity, [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], f b , EMG AMP, and EMG MPF responses were recorded during runs at the CHR - 5 and CHR + 5. RESULTS At CHR - 5, RPE, f b, and EMG MPF increased, while velocity, [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], and EMG AMP decreased. At CHR + 5, RPE and f b increased, velocity, [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], and EMG AMP decreased, and EMG MPF remained constant. CONCLUSIONS The close association between f b and RPE throughout the run at CHR - 5 and during the last 50 % of the run at CHR + 5 indicated that muscle afferents may have provided feedback from metabolic and mechanical stimuli that contributed to the perceptual responses. In addition, only RPE consistently indicated exhaustion and the current findings supported its use to monitor exercise performed at a constant HR.","Bergstrom, Haley C; Housh, Terry J; Cochrane, Kristen C; Jenkins, Nathaniel D M; Zuniga, Jorge M; Buckner, Samuel L; Goldsmith, Jacob A; Schmidt, Richard J; Johnson, Glen O; Cramer, Joel T",European journal of applied physiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00421-015-3204-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26108674/,498

The contributions of the implementation of air pollution prevention and control policies and the COVID-19 pandemic to major air pollutant emission reductions were studied, and their impacts on the regional air quality under adverse meteorological conditions were simulated using an air quality model. The results showed that from the 'New Year Haze' in Dec 2016-Jan 2017 to the 'Pandemic Haze' in Jan-Feb 2020, the major air pollutant emissions in the region had dropped by approximately 50%, and the average concentration of PM2.5 was potentially reduced by more than 40% under adverse meteorological conditions. The most effective emission reduction measures included the clean heating project and raising the standards in key industrial sectors, such as the iron and steel industry, coal-fired boilers, and power plants, which contributed 67.1% and 53.4% of the emission reductions in SO2 and PM2.5, respectively. The COVID-19 pandemic predominantly affected the mobile sources and light industry, which contributed 71.9% and 68.2% of the emission reductions in NOx and VOCs, respectively. The implementation of air pollution prevention and control policies contributed substantially to the improvement of regional air quality, which effectively reduced the intensity and extent of the heavy pollution process under unfavorable meteorological conditions. The regional average PM2.5 concentration was reduced by 26%, and the number of days experiencing heavy pollution decreased by 44%. Due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, the average PM2.5 concentration in the region was reduced by an additional 24%, and the duration and extent of heavy pollution decreased even further.","Tang, Qian; Zheng, Bo; Xue, Wen-Bo; Zhang, Qiang; Lei, Yu; He, Ke-Bin",Huan jing ke xue= Huanjing kexue,https://doi.org/10.13227/j.hjkx.202007218; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33742794/,498

Included studies involved participants from Saudi Arabia, India, Australia and the United Kingdom who attended Hajj in Makkah, Saudi Arabia in different years between 2005 and 2015. Pilgrims who developed symptoms of respiratory infection during Hajj were included in these studies. Participants' vaccination histories were recorded and respiratory samples were collected to test for influenza by PCR. Vaccine effectiveness (VE) was calculated after adjusting for potential confounders. Results: A total of 1,569 pilgrims were included in this analysis. Influenza vaccine uptake was 52.2% and the prevalence of influenza was 8.2%. The estimated overall VE was 43.4% (95% CI 11.4% to 63.9%, P= 0.01).

HNG pretreatment reduced lipid and cholesterol aggregation in HUVECs induced by Ox-LDL, increased LC3-II protein level, decreased P62 protein content, and reversed Ox-LDL-induced cathepsin D functional impairment. Inhibition of the FPRL1 pathway by FPRL1 siRNA or the FPRL1-specific inhibitor Boc-MLF blocked all HNG's protective effects. These results indicate that HNG could restore cathepsin D activity and protein level in HUVECs to repair lysosomal functional damage induced by Ox-LDL, further repairing Ox-LDL-induced autophagic damage in HUVECs. CONCLUSION HNG restores the activity of Ox-LDL-induced damaged lysosomal enzyme cathepsin D through its membrane protein receptor FPRL1 to promote autophagic degradation of Ox-LDL in HUVECs.","Ding, Yu; Feng, Yue; Zou, Yutian; Wang, Fen; Liu, Huihui; Liu, Chunfeng; Zhang, Yanlin","Nutrition, metabolism, and cardiovascular diseases : NMCD",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.numecd.2020.07.022; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32917500/,498

A systematic review of controlled preclinical trials of human ECFCs is needed to guide future study design and to accelerate clinical translation. A systematic search of Medline and EMBASE on 1 April 2019 returned 3131 unique entries of which 66 fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Most studies used ECFCs derived from umbilical cord or adult peripheral blood. Studies used genetically modified immunodeficient mice (n = 52) and/or rats (n = 16). ECFC phenotypes were inconsistently characterized. While >90% of studies used CD31+ and CD45-, CD14- was demonstrated in 73% of studies, CD146+ in 42%, and CD10+ in 35%. Most disease models invoked ischemia. Peripheral vascular ischemia (n = 29), central nervous system ischemia (n = 14), connective tissue injury (n = 10), and cardiovascular ischemia and reperfusion injury (n = 7) were studied most commonly. Studies showed predominantly positive results; only 13 studies reported ≥1 outcome with null results, three reported only null results, and one reported harm. Quality assessment with SYRCLE revealed potential sources of bias in most studies. Preclinical ECFC studies are associated with benefit across several ischemic conditions in animal models, although combining results is limited by marked heterogeneity in study design. In particular, characterization of ECFCs varied and aspects of reporting introduced risk of bias in most studies.

This study aimed to assess the psychological conditions among university students in Saudi Arabia during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS During the period between the 4th and 18th of June 2020, the students of Umm AlQura University in Saudi Arabia were invited to complete an online survey. The survey assessed their sociodemographic characteristics, educational disciplines, and manifestations of psychological health problems including depression, anxiety, and stress as determined by the Arabic version of the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21). RESULTS The study included 936 university students (56.4% women and 43.6% men). Of them, 41.1% had depressive symptoms (31.7% mild to moderate and 9.4% severe to very severe), 26.9% had anxiety symptoms (15.8% mild to moderate and 11.1% severe to very severe), and 22.4% had stress symptoms (15.2% mild to moderate and 7.2% severe to very severe). Students who reported having a friend or relative infected with or died of COVID-19, watching or reading news about the pandemic ≥2 hours/day, and not getting emotional support from family, university, and society were more likely to show psychological problems. CONCLUSION Symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress were common among Saudi university students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Psychological counseling and support should be provided to university students in Saudi Arabia.","Mohammed, Zeinab; Arafa, Ahmed; Atlam, El-Sayed; El-Qerafi, Nader; El-Shazly, Momen; Al-Hazazi, Omar; Ewis, Ashraf",International journal of clinical practice,https://doi.org/10.1111/ijcp.14853; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34516702/,498
114265,"Redeploying Residents and Fellows in Response to COVID-19: Tensions, Guiding Principles, and Lessons From the University of Washington.",2020-12-01,"Griffithsin (GRFT) is a red-alga-derived lectin that binds the terminal mannose residues of N-linked glycans found on the surface of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), HIV-2, and other enveloped viruses, including hepatitis C virus (HCV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and Ebola virus. GRFT displays no human T-cell mitogenic activity and does not induce production of proinflammatory cytokines in treated human cell lines. However, despite the growing evidence showing the broad-spectrum nanomolar or better antiviral activity of GRFT, no study has reported a comprehensive assessment of GRFT safety as a potential systemic antiviral treatment. The results presented in this work show that minimal toxicity was induced by a range of single and repeated daily subcutaneous doses of GRFT in two rodent species, although we noted treatment-associated increases in spleen and liver mass suggestive of an antidrug immune response. The drug is systemically distributed, accumulating to high levels in the serum and plasma after subcutaneous delivery. Further, we showed that serum from GRFT-treated animals retained antiviral activity against HIV-1-enveloped pseudoviruses in a cell-based neutralization assay. Overall, our data presented here show that GRFT accumulates to relevant therapeutic concentrations which are tolerated with minimal toxicity. These studies support further development of GRFT as a systemic antiviral therapeutic agent against enveloped viruses, although deimmunizing the molecule may be necessary if it is to be used in long-term treatment of chronic viral infections.","Barton, Christopher; Kouokam, J Calvin; Lasnik, Amanda B; Foreman, Oded; Cambon, Alexander; Brock, Guy; Montefiori, David C; Vojdani, Fakhrieh; McCormick, Alison A; O'Keefe, Barry R; Palmer, Kenneth E",Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,https://doi.org/10.1128/aac.01407-13; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24145548/,498

The aim of this study was to evaluate the combined effect of FLD and alcohol consumption on incident type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS In this historical cohort study involving 9948 men, we investigated the influence of the presence of FLD and the grades of alcohol consumption on incident type 2 diabetes using Cox proportional hazards models. We categorized the participants into the following four groups: none or minimal alcohol consumption, <40 g/week; light, 40-140 g/week; moderate, 140-280 g/week; or heavy alcohol consumption, >280 g/week. FLD was diagnosed by abdominal ultrasonography. RESULTS During the median 6.0-year follow-up, 568 participants developed type 2 diabetes. Heavy alcohol consumers with FLD showed a higher risk for developing type 2 diabetes compared with the other groups. Moderate alcohol consumers without FLD had a significantly higher risk for developing incident type 2 diabetes, compared with none or minimal and light alcohol consumers without FLD. In contrast, there was no apparent difference in the risk for incident type 2 diabetes between none or minimal, light, and moderate alcohol consumers with FLD. Furthermore, there was no statistically significant difference in the risk for incident type 2 diabetes between a moderate and heavy alcohol consumer without FLD and a none or minimal, light, and moderate alcohol consumer with FLD. CONCLUSIONS To prevent incident type 2 diabetes, we should acknowledge that the impact of alcohol consumption may vary in the presence of FLD.","Okamura, Takuro; Hashimoto, Yoshitaka; Hamaguchi, Masahide; Obora, Akihiro; Kojima, Takao; Fukui, Michiaki",BMJ open diabetes research & care,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjdrc-2020-001629; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32900699/,498

Under the action of homogeneous H3O+ and distinct Lewis acid sites on the catalyst, the production of lactic acid from microalgae residue underwent three main reaction steps: hydrolysis, isomerization, and retro-aldol condensation. Results demonstrated that the lipid component had a strong inhibitory effect on the production of lactic acid due to the formation of aromatics, esters, and complex nitrogenous heterocyclic compounds, which covered or poisoned the Lewis acid sites of the catalyst. The protein component acted as a chemical buffer that enhanced the production of lactic acid by controlling the release of monosaccharides from the carbohydrate fraction of microalgae and maintaining the catalytic activity of the catalyst. Thus, microalgae residue demonstrated great promise for the production of value-added chemicals.","Xia, Meng; Shen, Zheng; Gu, Minyan; Chen, Wenbo; Dong, Wenjie; Zhang, Yalei",The Science of the total environment,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.144891; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33736128/,498

Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) play a crucial role in the control of viral infections, especially in response to viruses that have evolved mechanisms to block the type I IFN signal transduction pathway. Using density gradient separation and cell sorting, we have highly enriched a population of bovine cells capable of producing high levels of biologically active type I IFN. These cells represented less than 0.1% of the total lymphocyte population in blood, pseudoafferent lymph, and lymph nodes. Phenotypic analysis identified these cells as bovine pDCs (CD3(-) CD14(-) CD21(-) CD11c(-) NK(-) TCRδ(-) CD4(+) MHC II(+) CD45RB(+) CD172a(+) CD32(+)). High levels of type I IFN were generated by these cells in vitro in response to Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR-9) agonist CpG and foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) immune complexes. In contrast, immune complexes formed with UV-inactivated FMDV or FMDV empty capsids failed to elicit a type I IFN response. Depletion of CD4 cells in vivo resulted in levels of type I IFN in serum early during FMDV infection that were significantly lower than those for control animals. In conclusion, pDCs interacting with immune-complexed virus are the major source of type I interferon production during acute FMDV infection in cattle.","Reid, Elizabeth; Juleff, Nicholas; Gubbins, Simon; Prentice, Helen; Seago, Julian; Charleston, Bryan",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02495-10; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21307187/,498

Certain individuals have a greater tendency of negative behavioral aspects including aggression. The quest to identify tunderlying genetic causes has led to identification of a number of genetic markers, one of them is the monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A) gene. Objective We aimed to genotype a variable number of tandem repeats (VNTRs) in the promoter region and a functional SNP within this gene (T941G, dbSNP ID: rs6323) in the recruited cohort of 482 subjects. Methods After DNA isolation, genotyping was done by PCR-RFLP and the results were confirmed by sequencing. Results For VNTRs, the results showed, highest frequency of 3.5 repeats in males and 4 repeats in females in the promoter region. The genotype frequencies for the SNP in cases were GG=16.3%, TG=20.6% and TT=63.1%, while in controls, the frequencies were GG=12.7%, TG=6.3%, and TT=81.0%. The allele frequencies were significantly different between cases and controls (p=0.015; OR=1.51; CI=1.085-2.102). Conclusion The selected VNTR and SNP appeared to be significantly associated with aggression. These VNTRs and SNP have not been studied previously in the Pakistani population, hence they represent a unique ethnic group.

120668,A rare instructive complication of balloon catheter fracture during percutaneous coronary intervention.,2016,"BACKGROUND Various pharmacodynamic response surface models have been developed to quantitatively describe the relationship between two or more drug concentrations with their combined clinical effect. We examined the interaction of remifentanil and sevoflurane on the probability of tolerance to shake and shout, tetanic stimulation, laryngeal mask airway insertion, and laryngoscopy in patients to compare the performance of five different response surface models. METHODS Forty patients preoperatively received different combined concentrations of remifentanil (0-12 ng/ml) and sevoflurane (0.5-3.5 vol.%) according to a criss-cross design (160 concentration pairs, four per patient). After having reached pseudosteady state, the response to shake and shout, tetanic stimulation, laryngeal mask airway insertion, and laryngoscopy was recorded. For the analysis of the probability of tolerance, five different interaction models were tested: Greco, Reduced Greco, Minto, Scaled C50(O) Hierarchical, and Fixed C50(O) Hierarchical model. All calculations were performed with NONMEM VI (Icon Development Solutions, Ellicott City, MD). RESULTS The pharmacodynamic interaction between sevoflurane and remifentanil was strongly synergistic for both the hypnotic and the analgesic components of anesthesia. The Greco model did not result in plausible parameter estimates. The Fixed C50(O) Hierarchical model performed slightly better than the Scaled C50(O) Hierarchical and Reduced Greco models, whereas the Minto model fitted less well. CONCLUSION We showed the importance of exploring various surface model approaches when studying drug interactions. The Fixed C50(O) Hierarchical model fits our data on sevoflurane remifentanil interaction best and appears to be an appropriate model for use in hypnotic-opioid drug interaction.","Heyse, Bjorn; Proost, Johannes H; Schumacher, Peter M; Bouillon, Thomas W; Vereecke, Hugo E M; Eleveld, Douglas J; Luginbühl, Martin; Struys, Michel M R F",Anesthesiology,https://doi.org/10.1097/aln.0b013e318242a2ec; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22222473/,498

Among the various factors determining them, the crowd noise is considered as one of the most relevant; yet, the majority of previous studies could not isolate its contribution. The possibility to study the effects of crowd noise - or, better, of its absence - in an ecological context was given by the matches played behind closed doors due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether home advantage and referee bias still occur (and to what extent) during matches played in absence of spectators. In particular, the focus was on the first and second divisions of the top four countries in the UEFA ranking, for a total of 841 matches behind closed doors. The hypothesis was that, if these phenomena are largely due to the effect of crowd noise, the absence of spectators should reduce their occurrence. Various parameters for each of the two phenomena were considered, and the analyses revealed a reduction of home advantage and the absence of referee bias. The results bring further support to the claim that, among all the factors contributing to home advantage and referee bias, crowd noise has a relevant role. Thus, spectators can significantly contribute to determine the dynamics and the outcomes of professional football matches.","Sors, Fabrizio; Grassi, Michele; Agostini, Tiziano; Murgia, Mauro",European journal of sport science,https://doi.org/10.1080/17461391.2020.1845814; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33131429/,498

CoVs are enveloped viruses whose proteins include spike (S), membrane (M), and envelope (E) which are embedded in the viral envelope. The glycosylated S protein, which forms homo-trimeric spikes on the surface of the viral particle, mediates viral entry into host cells. SARS-CoV-2, like SARS-CoV, uses the Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) cell surface protein for cellular entry. An attractive anti-viral approach is targeting virus entry into cells, for which three strategies are suggested: 1) direct targeting of the viral glycoprotein; 2) targeting the viral receptor on the cell surface; and 3) using soluble (s) ACE2 that binds to S protein thereby neutralizing the virus. In this article, the advantages and disadvantages of these strategies are explained. Moreover, we propose that fusion of the sACE2 to anti-CD16 to produce a bi-speciﬁc molecule could be a promising anti-viral strategy.","Sheikhi, Abdolkarim; Hojjat-Farsangi, Mohammad",Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,https://doi.org/10.1080/21645515.2020.1787066; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32663051/,498

The aim of this study is to examine the role of age in the early psychological responses to the pandemic in a Spanish community sample, focusing on how different generations coped with it. METHOD An online survey was conducted during the early stages of the quarantine. Sociodemographic, health and behavioral variables were compared for five age groups. Mental health was assessed by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) and psychological impacts were assessed by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R). RESULTS 3,524 participants were included (Mage = 39.24, SDage = 12.00). Participants aged between 18 and 33 years old showed more hyperactivation and evitation, were more depressed, anxious and stressed. Those aged between 26 and 33 years old showed more intrusion. Those aged between 18 and 25 years old suffered more sleep disturbances, claustrophobia and somatization and maintained worse routines.

In the late 2000s, technological innovations, improvement in surgical technique, and surgeons' accumulation of experience have led to more rapid progress of laparoscopic liver resection. Now, laparoscopic liver resection is able to be done by several approaches, for all locations of the tumors, for several diseases, with several types of resection, not only for tumors but for liver transplantation, with equivalent or better results compared with open surgery.

The recent emergence of chikungunya virus, Zika virus, and Ebola virus highlights the struggles to contain outbreaks. A significant hurdle is the availability of antivirals to treat the infected or protect at-risk populations. While several compounds show promise in vitro and in vivo, these outbreaks underscore the need to accelerate drug discovery. The replication of several viruses has been described to rely on host polyamines, small and abundant positively charged molecules found in the cell. Here, we describe the antiviral effects of two molecules that alter polyamine levels: difluoromethylornithine (DFMO; also called eflornithine), which is a suicide inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase 1 (ODC1), and diethylnorspermine (DENSpm), an activator of spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase (SAT1). We show that reducing polyamine levels has a negative effect on diverse RNA viruses, including several viruses involved in recent outbreaks, in vitro and in vivo These findings highlight the importance of the polyamine biosynthetic pathway to viral replication, as well as its potential as a target in the development of further antivirals or currently available molecules, such as DFMO. IMPORTANCE RNA viruses present a significant hazard to human health, and combatting these viruses requires the exploration of new avenues for targeting viral replication. Polyamines, small positively charged molecules within the cell, have been demonstrated to facilitate infection for a few different viruses.

Methods: In this retrospective study, the clinical data of 5 infants, who were admitted to the Department of Neonatology in Wuhan Children's Hospital from 31(st) January to 25(th) February 2020, were collected. Bedsides pulmondary ultrasound was conducted on admission, during the hospitalization, and before discharge, the result were compared with the chest X-ray or CT done at the same time. Results: Among the 5 cases who aged 1-18 days, 3 were male. The main clinical manifestations were respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms. The pulmonary ultrasonography on admission showed abnormal pleural line and pulmonary edema of different severity in all 5 cases, presented as increase and fusion of B-line, and pulmonary interstitial syndrome; among them, one case also had a small-range consolidation. The chest CT on admission showed no obvious parenchymal infiltration in 2 cases, small strip or patchy high-density shadow in 2 cases, and ground glass change in one case. The re-examination of ultrosound during the hospitalization and at discharge showed improvement in all cases and were consistent with the chest X-ray taken at the same time. Conclusions: The main changes on the pulmonary ultrasonography in neonates with COVID-19 pneumonia are increase and fusion of B-line, abnormal pleural line, and alveolar interstitial syndrome, and may coexist with small range of pulmonary consolidation. The sensitivity of pulmonary ultrasound is higher than that of chest X-ray and CT in the diagnosis of pulmonary edema, and could be used in monitoring and evaluation of the disease.","Feng, X Y; Tao, X W; Zeng, L K; Wang, W Q; Li, G",Zhonghua er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn112140-20200228-00154; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32392948/,498
129396,[Ensuring continuity of cancer treatment despite the COVID-19 epidemic].,2020-12-01,"BACKGROUND One Health (OH) has resurfaced in the light of the ravaging COVID-19 pandemic. It has been accepted by many local and global health authorities as a suitable approach for preventing and responding to infectious disease outbreaks including pandemics. MAIN BODY One Health (OH) is a multisectoral and interdisciplinary framework for managing the animal, human, and ecosystem determinants of health. Globally, the majority of emerging infections in humans including SARS-Cov2-the causative agent of COVID-19-are transmitted from animals through environmental contacts in the last few decades. Yet, even when the biological and social interactions at the human, animal, and environmental interface that drive spillover of zoonotic diseases have been proven, OH strategies to address associated complex health challenges today are still rudimentary in many national health systems. Despite the disproportionate burden of infectious diseases in sub-Saharan Africa, OH is minimally incorporated into routine disease control and national health security programs. Challenges include poor policy support for OH in sub-Saharan Africa, and where some form of policy framework does exist, there are significant implementation bottlenecks. In this paper, we identified ideological, technical, operational, and economic barriers to OH implementation in Nigeria and sub-Saharan Africa, and highlighted possible recommendations across these domains. In order to yield sustainable benefits, a relevant OH policy approach in the sub-Saharan African health systems must derive from a buy-in of the critical mass of stakeholders in the society. CONCLUSION The implementation of sustainable OH approaches as a countermeasure to recurring emerging infections is a developmental priority for sub-Saharan African countries. A deep understanding of the local context must be leveraged to develop integrative OH solutions that are bold, rooted in science, and proven to be compatible with the level of development in sub-Saharan Africa.","Ayobami, Olaniyi; Mark, Godwin; Kadri-Alabi, Zaharat; Achi, Chioma Rita; Jacob, Joy Chinwendu",The Journal of the Egyptian Public Health Association,https://doi.org/10.1186/s42506-021-00085-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34478008/,498

In the animal nervous system, a systematic shift toward distal sites of transcription termination produces transcript signatures that are crucial for neuron development and function. Here, we report that, in Drosophila, the highly conserved protein ELAV globally regulates all sites of neuronal 3' end processing and directly binds to proximal polyadenylation sites of target mRNAs in vivo. We uncover an endogenous strategy of functional gene rescue that safeguards neuronal RNA signatures in an ELAV loss-of-function context. When not directly repressed by ELAV, the transcript encoding the ELAV paralog FNE acquires a mini-exon, generating a new protein able to translocate to the nucleus and rescue ELAV-mediated alternative polyadenylation and alternative splicing. We propose that exon-activated functional rescue is a more widespread mechanism that ensures robustness of processes regulated by a hierarchy, rather than redundancy, of effectors.","Carrasco, Judit; Rauer, Michael; Hummel, Barbara; Grzejda, Dominika; Alfonso-Gonzalez, Carlos; Lee, Yeon; Wang, Qingqing; Puchalska, Monika; Mittler, Gerhard; Hilgers, Valérie",Molecular cell,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2020.09.011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33007255/,498

135947,Individual Differences in the Stability and Change of Childhood Depression: A Growth Mixture Model With Structured Residuals.,2021-01-10,"INTRODUCTION Surgery is evolving, and new techniques are introduced to improve ""recovery."" Postoperative recovery is complex, and evaluating the effectiveness of surgical innovations requires assessment of patient-reported outcomes. The Short-Form-36 (SF-36), a generic health-related quality of life questionnaire, is the most commonly used instrument in this context. The objective of this study was to contribute evidence for the validity of the SF-36 as a metric of postoperative recovery. METHODS Data from 128 patients undergoing planned colorectal surgery at one university hospital between 2005 and 2010 were analyzed. In the absence of a gold standard, the responsiveness and construct validity (known groups and convergent) of the SF-36 were evaluated. Standardized response means were computed for the former and non-parametric tests were used to assess the statistical significance of the changes observed. Multiple linear regression was used to determine whether the SF-36 discriminates between patients with versus without complications and between laparoscopic and open surgery (known groups); correlations between the SF-36 and the 6-min walk test, a measure of functional walking capacity (convergent) was investigated with Spearman's rank correlation. RESULTS The SF-36 was sensitive to clinically important changes. Scores on six of eight domains and the physical component summary score deteriorated postoperatively (SRM 0.86 for the PCS, p < 0.01) and improved to baseline thereafter. Patients with complications had significantly lower scores on five SF-36 domains (with differences from -9 (-18, -1), p = 0.04 to -18 (-32, -2), p = 0.03), and scores on all subscales were lower than those in a healthy population (p < 0.01 to p = 0.04). The SF-36 did not differentiate between laparoscopic and open surgery. Physical functioning scores correlated with 6MWT distance at 1 and 2 months (Spearman's r = 0.31 and 0.36, p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS The SF-36 is responsive to expected physiological changes in the postoperative period, demonstrates construct validity, and thus constitutes a valid measure of postoperative recovery after planned colorectal surgery. The SF-36 did not, however, discriminate between recovery after laparoscopic and open surgery.","Antonescu, Ioana; Carli, Francesco; Mayo, Nancy E; Feldman, Liane S",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-014-3577-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24879142/,498
136644,Motivating social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic: An online experiment.,2020-10-27,"BACKGROUND Multiport laparoscopy is the gold-standard approach for cholecystectomy, and single-port laparoscopy has been developed to further reduce its invasiveness. A specific robotic single-port platform (da Vinci single-site, Intuitive Surgical Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA) has been released in 2011, which could technically facilitate single-site cholecystectomy. Current data show its feasibility; however, detailed short- and long-term analyses of costs and comparisons relative to multiport laparoscopy are not available to date. METHODS Patients who underwent robotic single-site cholecystectomy for benign, clinically noninflammatory disease between 2011 and 2015 were matched for disease, age, gender, BMI, ASA classification, diagnosis, and elapsed year of surgery to a cohort of multiport cholecystectomies. Demographic, perioperative, and long-term data were collected retrospectively and analyzed. Perioperative and long-term costs including re-operations due to the primary procedure until February 2017 were compared across both cohorts. RESULTS 99 patients who underwent robotic single-site cholecystectomy were matched to 99 patients with multiport cholecystectomy. A higher rate of outpatient procedures in the robotic cohort (31.3 vs. 17.2%, p = 0.0305) was found, and demographic parameters and perioperative clinical outcomes were similar. Perioperative costs were significantly higher for the robotic single-site patients (6158.0 vs. 4288.0 USD, p < 0.0001). With similar follow-up times of 59.0 and 58.9 months, respectively (p = 0.9552), significantly more patients of the robotic Single-Site cohort underwent follow-up surgery (7.1 vs. 0.0%, p = 0.0140), and follow-up costs were significantly higher for the robotic cohort (694.7 vs. 0.0 USD, p = 0.0145). CONCLUSION With similar early postoperative clinical results and a higher rate of re-operations, perioperative and long-term costs are significantly higher with robotic Single-Site cholecystectomy compared with multiport cholecystectomy. Considering the unclear clinical value of robotic single-site cholecystectomy and the significant short- and long-term costs, a call for further research and a debate as to who should bear the costs beyond the ones of the gold-standard treatment appear reasonable.","Hagen, Monika E; Balaphas, Alexandre; Podetta, Michele; Rohner, Peter; Jung, Minoa K; Buchs, Nicolas C; Buehler, Leo; Mendoza, Jona M; Morel, Philippe",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-017-5843-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29052069/,498

Consequently, proteolytic activity plays an important role in fundamental cellular processes such as differentiation and migration, immunological and inflammatory reactions, apoptosis and survival. During virus infection, host proteases are involved in several processes, from cell entry to initiation, progression and resolution of inflammation. On the other hand, many viruses encode their own highly specific proteases, responsible for the proteolytic processing of viral proteins, but, at the same time, to cleave host proteins to corrupt antiviral host responses and adjust protein activity to favor viral replication. Traditionally, protease substrate identification has been addressed by means of hypothesis-driven approaches, but recent advances in proteomics have made a toolkit available to uncover the extensive repertoire of host proteins cleaved during infection, either by viral or host proteases. Here, we review the currently available proteomics-based methods that can and have contributed to the systematic and unbiased identification of new protease substrates in the context of virus-host interactions. The role of specific proteases during the course of virus infections will also be highlighted.","Martiáñez-Vendrell, Xavier; Kikkert, Marjolein",Advances in virus research,https://doi.org/10.1016/bs.aivir.2021.03.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33934826/,498

However, methods using existing and widely available endoscopic accessories have been ineffective. The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and safety of a new simple method for gastric closure (retracted clip-assisted loop closure) that uses existing endoscopic accessories with minor modifications. METHODS The retracted clip-assisted loop closure technique involves deploying 3-4 Resolution(®) clips (modified by attaching a 90-cm length of suture to the end of each clip) along the margin of the gastrotomy with one jaw on the serosal surface and the other jaw on the mucosal surface. The suture strings are threaded through an endoloop. Traction is then applied to the strings causing the gastric wall to tent. The endoloop is secured below the tip of the clips, completing a full-thickness gastrotomy closure. The main outcome measures were feasibility, efficacy, and safety of the new retracted clip-assisted loop closure technique for NOTES gastrotomy closure. RESULTS An air-tight seal was achieved in 100% (n = 9) of stomachs. The mean leak pressure was 116.3 (±19.4) mmHg.

AIM The aim of this study was to assess the evidence on the benefits and harms of lifestyle and risk factor management interventions in patients undergoing atrial fibrillation ablation. METHOD Our systematic review searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Psychinfo, Web of Science and CENTRAL using key terms related to atrial fibrillation and lifestyle, including interventional trials. The primary outcomes were mortality and serious adverse events. Random effects meta-analyses of outcomes were conducted when appropriate. RESULTS Two randomised controlled trials and two non-randomised interventional trials with a total of 498 patients were included. Six primary events were reported for the intervention groups and five events for the control groups (relative risk of 1.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.3 to 3.1, I2 0%, P = 0.537). Effects in favour of the intervention groups were found for atrial fibrillation frequency (0.82 points, 95% CI -1.60 to -0.03, I2 87.3%, P = 0.005), atrial fibrillation duration (-0.76 points, 95% CI -1.64 to 0.12, I2 89.1%, P = 0.002) and body mass index (-5.40 kg/m2, 95% CI 6.22 to -2.57, I2 83.9%, P = 0.013).

Conventional angiography with 3-dimensional rendering is necessary to accurately assess aneurysm morphology and location, so that treatment can be planned appropriately. Current evidence suggests that coil embolization can be beneficial for aneurysms amenable to endovascular treatment. The use of remodeling techniques has expanded the range of aneurysms treatable by endovascular means. Balloon remodeling can be a powerful technique for treating ruptured aneurysms with unfavorable morphology. However, stent-assisted technique is associated with significantly higher complication rates in ruptured aneurysms and requires dual antiplatelet agents, and should therefore be considered with great caution for ruptured aneurysms. Complications of ruptured aneurysm embolization include aneurysm perforation, which should be addressed with immediate occlusion of the aneurysm, and thromboembolism, which can be managed most effectively with glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors.","Froehler, Michael T",Current neurology and neuroscience reports,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11910-012-0326-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23299822/,498

We have developed a rat model of polytrauma that combines penetrating TBI, HS and HX. Following brain trauma, HX was induced by reducing the inspired oxygen while HS was induced by withdrawing blood to lower the mean arterial pressure. The physiological, histological, and behavioral aspects of this animal model have been characterized and have demonstrated exacerbating effects of systemic insults on penetrating TBI.

However, the clinical effects of IFN hyperactivity in DS remain undefined. Here, we report that a commonly used mouse model of DS overexpresses IFNR genes and shows hypersensitivity to IFN ligands in diverse immune cell types. When treated repeatedly with a TLR3 agonist to induce chronic inflammation, these animals overexpress key IFN-stimulated genes, induce cytokine production, exhibit liver pathology, and undergo rapid weight loss. Importantly, the lethal immune hypersensitivity and cytokine production and the ensuing pathology are ameliorated by JAK1 inhibition. These results indicate that individuals with DS may experience harmful hyperinflammation upon IFN-inducing immune stimuli, as observed during severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, pointing to JAK1 inhibition as a strategy to restore immune homeostasis in DS.","Tuttle, Kathryn D; Waugh, Katherine A; Araya, Paula; Minter, Ross; Orlicky, David J; Ludwig, Michael; Andrysik, Zdenek; Burchill, Matthew A; Tamburini, Beth A J; Sempeck, Colin; Smith, Keith; Granrath, Ross; Tracy, Dayna; Baxter, Jessica; Espinosa, Joaquin M; Sullivan, Kelly D",Cell reports,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2020.108407; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33207208/,498

RESULTS 87 patients with failed antireflux surgery underwent RYGB. Median age 58 years (range 25-79 years). Median preoperative BMI 32.4 kg/m2 (range 21.6-50.6 kg/m2). Comorbidities included hypertension (48.3%) and diabetes (11.5%). Sixty-six patients had undergone 1 prior fundoplication, 18 had 2 prior fundoplications, and 3 had 3 prior fundoplications. At least one previous open antireflux procedure had been performed in 16.1% of patients. The most common recurrent symptoms were reflux (85.1%), dysphagia (36.7%), pain (35.6%), and regurgitation (29.9%). Median symptom-free interval from last antireflux surgery was 3 years (range 0-25 years). RYGB was performed laparoscopically in 47.1% of cases, robotically in 44.8% of cases, and open in 5.9%. Operative duration was longer in the robotic group (p = 0.04). During RYGB, 85.1% patients were found to have an associated hiatal hernia, 34.5% had intrathoracic migration of the fundoplication, 32.2% a slipped fundoplication onto proximal stomach, and 13.8% had wrap disruption. Median length of stay (LOS) was 4 days (range 1-33 days). Median follow-up was 35.8 months, 11 patients (12.6%) had recurrent reflux symptoms. Excess body weight loss (%EWL) was 80.4%. There was no mortality but 8 patients required reoperation during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS Fundoplication takedown with RYGB was successful for long-term reflux resolution. Most can be performed via a minimally invasive approach with acceptable perioperative morbidity, symptom resolution, and the additional benefit of %EWL.","Coakley, Kathleen M; Groene, Steven A; Colavita, Paul D; Prasad, Tanushree; Stefanidis, Dimitris; Lincourt, Amy E; Augenstein, Vedra A; Gersin, Keith; Heniford, B Todd",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-018-6072-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29362910/,498

Growing evidence suggests complex interactions between IFN-γ and bone remodelling cells. However, potential association of IFN-γ gene polymorphism with susceptibility to post-traumatic osteomyelitis remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the potential link between IFN-γ +874T/A polymorphism and risk of developing post-traumatic osteomyelitis. A total of 189 patients with post-traumatic osteomyelitis and 200 healthy controls were enrolled for genotyping using the SNaPshot genotyping method. Statistically significant associations were found between the gene polymorphism and the risk of post-traumatic osteomyelitis by dominant model (AA + AT vs. TT, OR = 1.820, p = .017) and heterozygous model (AT vs. TT, OR = 1.781, p = .029). Moreover, the frequency of mutant allele A was significantly higher in the patients than that in the healthy controls (15.07% vs. 9.25%, OR = 1.742, p = .013).

It is based on the principle of open lung approach. It has many purported advantages over conventional ventilation, including alveolar recruitment, improved oxygenation, preservation of spontaneous breathing, improved hemodynamics, and potential lung-protective effects. It has many claimed disadvantages related to risks of volutrauma, increased work of breathing, and increased energy expenditure related to spontaneous breathing. APRV is used mainly as a rescue therapy for the difficult to oxygenate patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). There is confusion regarding this mode of ventilation, due to the different terminology used in the literature. APRV settings include the ""P high,"" ""T high,"" ""P low,"" and ""T low"". Physicians and respiratory therapists should be aware of the different ways and the rationales for setting these variables on the ventilators. Also, they should be familiar with the differences between APRV, biphasic positive airway pressure (BIPAP), and other conventional and nonconventional modes of ventilation. There is no solid proof that APRV improves mortality; however, there are ongoing studies that may reveal further information about this mode of ventilation. This paper reviews the different methods proposed for APRV settings, and summarizes the different studies comparing APRV and BIPAP, and the potential benefits and pitfalls for APRV.","Daoud, Ehab G; Farag, Hany L; Chatburn, Robert L",Respiratory care,https://doi.org/10.4187/respcare.01238; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21762559/,498

We aimed to conduct a systematic review and if possible, a meta-analysis of the available literature to characterise and quantify the cleaning-related respiratory health effects. We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE databases and included studies that evaluated the association of any respiratory health outcome with exposure to cleaning occupation or products in occupational cleaners. A modified GRADE was used to appraise the quality of included studies. We retrieved 1124 articles, and after applying our inclusion criteria, 39 were selected for the systematic review. We performed a meta-analysis of the 21 studies evaluating asthma which showed a 50% increased pooled relative risk in cleaners (meta-relative risk (RR)=1.50; 95% CI 1.44 to 1.56). Population-based cross-sectional studies showed more stable associations with asthma risk. No evidence of atopic asthma as dominant phenotype emerged. Also, we estimated a 43% increased risk (meta-RR=1.43; 95% CI 1.31 to 1.56) of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Evidence for associations with bronchial-hyper-responsiveness, lung function decline, rhinitis, upper and lower respiratory tract symptoms was weaker. In our systematic review and meta-analysis, we found that working as a cleaner is associated with an increased risk of reversible and even irreversible obstructive airway diseases. All studies lacked quantitative exposure assessment to cleaning products; this would help elucidate underlying causal agents and mechanisms. Exposure control and respiratory surveillance among cleaners is warranted to prevent the associated respiratory health burden.

Asymptomatic COVID-19 cases are infective and cannot be identified by symptom-based screening. There is an urgent need to control virus spread by asymptomatic carriers at cancer centres. We aim to describe the characteristics, screening methods, and outcomes of cancer patients with asymptomatic COVID-19 infection and to further explore anti-tumour treatment for this population. PATIENTS AND METHODS We reviewed patients with cancer who were admitted to Hubei Cancer Hospital in Wuhan from February 1, 2020, to April 4, 2020. We collected demographic data, laboratory findings, treatment information, nucleic acid and serum test results, chest computed tomography (CT) information and survival status of cancer patients diagnosed with asymptomatic COVID-19 infection. RESULTS A total of 16 cancer patients with asymptomatic COVID-19 infection were confirmed. The most common cancer type was breast cancer. The blood cell counts of most patients were in the normal range. Lymphocytes of 100% of asymptomatic carriers were in the normal range. Thirteen (81.3%) patients were positive for virus-specific IgM antibodies, and three (18.8%) were positive by PCR; only one (6.3%) patient showed novel coronavirus pneumonia features on CT. Three (18.3%) patients died, and the cause of death was considered malignancy caused by delaying anti-tumour treatment. CONCLUSIONS Our study shows that the lymphocytes of 100% of asymptomatic carriers were in the normal range. This result indicates that the host immunity of asymptomatic carriers is not significantly disrupted by COVID-19. Single PCR detection is not sufficient to screen among asymptomatic individuals, and a combination of PCR tests, serological tests and CT is of great importance. Unless the tumour is life-threatening or rapidly progressing, we advise restarting active anti-tumour therapy after PCR tests become negative.","Huang, Q; Hu, S; Ran, F-M; Liang, T-J; Wang, H-X; Chen, C-C; Zhang, J; Ou, W-L; Dong, S; Cai, Q; Luo, C-G; Qian, Y",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202009_23070; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33015823/,498

157142,Persistent fatigue in patients with COVID-19.,2021-01-01,"The host response to RNA virus infection consists of an intrinsic innate immune response and the induction of apoptosis as mechanisms to restrict viral replication. The mitochondrial adaptor molecule MAVS plays critical roles in coordinating both virus-induced type I interferon production and apoptosis; however, the regulation of MAVS-mediated apoptosis is poorly understood. Here, we show that the adaptor protein TAX1BP1 functions as a negative regulator of virus-induced apoptosis. TAX1BP1-deficient cells are highly sensitive to apoptosis in response to infection with the RNA viruses vesicular stomatitis virus and Sendai virus and to transfection with poly(I·C). TAX1BP1 undergoes degradation during RNA virus infection, and loss of TAX1BP1 is associated with apoptotic cell death. TAX1BP1 deficiency augments virus-induced activation of proapoptotic c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling. Virus infection promotes the mitochondrial localization of TAX1BP1 and concomitant interaction with the mitochondrial adaptor MAVS. TAX1BP1 recruits the E3 ligase Itch to MAVS to trigger its ubiquitination and degradation, and loss of TAX1BP1 or Itch results in increased MAVS protein expression. Together, these results indicate that TAX1BP1 functions as an adaptor molecule for Itch to target MAVS during RNA virus infection and thus restrict virus-induced apoptosis.","Choi, Young Bong; Shembade, Noula; Parvatiyar, Kislay; Balachandran, Siddharth; Harhaj, Edward William",Molecular and cellular biology,https://doi.org/10.1128/mcb.00422-16; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27736772/,498

The library was screened against purified virions for the production of single-chain variable-region fragments (ScFv). Of the 6 positive clones, one clone (monoclonal antibody [MAb] 4-5) showed neutralizing activity against SFTSV infection in Vero cells. MAb 4-5 was found to effectively neutralize all of the clinical isolates of SFTSV tested, which were isolated from patients in China from 2010 to 2012. MAb 4-5 was found to bind a linear epitope in the ectodomain of glycoprotein Gn. Its neutralizing activity is attributed to blockage of the interactions between the Gn protein and the cellular receptor, indicating that inhibition of virus-cell attachment is its main mechanism.

This study explores: (1) workers' perceived causes of sickness absence; (2) perceived return to work (RTW) barriers and facilitators; and (3) differences between workers with short, medium and long-term sickness absence. Methods A longitudinal qualitative study was conducted involving 34 workers with CMDs. Semi-structured interviews were held at two time-points during their RTW process. The 68 interviews were audio-taped, transcribed and thematically analyzed to explore workers' perspective on sickness absence causes, RTW barriers and facilitators, and compare data across the three sub-groups of workers. Results Workers reported various causes for their absence, including: (1) high work pressure; (2) poor work relationships; (3) unhelpful thoughts and feelings, e.g. lacking self-insight; and (4) ineffective coping behaviors. According to workers, RTW was facilitated by work adjustments, fulfilling relationships with supervisors, and adequate occupational health guidance. Workers with short-term leave more often reported favorable work conditions, and proactive coping behavior. In contrast, the long-term group reported reactive coping behavior and dissatisfaction with their work. Conclusion Supporting workers with CMDs in gaining self-awareness and regaining control, discussing the value of their work, and creating work conditions that enable workers to do valuable work, seem central for successful RTW and might prevent sickness absence. Supervisors play a key role in enabling workers to do valuable work and further research should focus on how supervisors can be supported in this task.","Joosen, Margot C W; Lugtenberg, Marjolein; Arends, Iris; van Gestel, Hanneke J A W M; Schaapveld, Benedikte; Terluin, Berend; van Weeghel, Jaap; van der Klink, Jac J L; Brouwers, Evelien P M",Journal of occupational rehabilitation,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10926-021-10004-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34580811/,498
160855,Video Demonstrations for Didactic Laboratory Setting.,2020-07-15,"This review provides an update of ecologically relevant phytochemicals for ruminant production, focusing on their contribution to advancing nutrition. Phytochemicals embody a broad spectrum of chemical components that influence resource competence and biological advantage in determining plant species' distribution and density in different ecosystems. These natural compounds also often act as plant defensive chemicals against predatorial microbes, insects, and herbivores. They may modulate or exacerbate microbial transactions in the gastrointestinal tract and physiological responses in ruminant microbiomes. To harness their production-enhancing characteristics, phytochemicals have been actively researched as feed additives to manipulate ruminal fermentation and establish other phytochemoprophylactic (prevent animal diseases) and phytochemotherapeutic (treat animal diseases) roles. However, phytochemical-host interactions, the exact mechanism of action, and their effects require more profound elucidation to provide definitive recommendations for ruminant production. The majority of phytochemicals of nutritional and pharmacological interest are typically classified as flavonoids (9%), terpenoids (55%), and alkaloids (36%). Within flavonoids, polyphenolics (e.g., hydrolyzable and condensed tannins) have many benefits to ruminants, including reducing methane (CH4) emission, gastrointestinal nematode parasitism, and ruminal proteolysis. Within terpenoids, saponins and essential oils also mitigate CH4 emission, but triterpenoid saponins have rich biochemical structures with many clinical benefits in humans. The anti-methanogenic property in ruminants is variable because of the simultaneous targeting of several physiological pathways. This may explain saponin-containing forages' relative safety for long-term use and describe associated molecular interactions on all ruminant metabolism phases. Alkaloids are N-containing compounds with vast pharmacological properties currently used to treat humans, but their phytochemical usage as feed additives in ruminants has yet to be exploited as they may act as ghost compounds alongside other phytochemicals of known importance. We discussed strategic recommendations for phytochemicals to support sustainable ruminant production, such as replacements for antibiotics and anthelmintics. Topics that merit further examination are discussed and include the role of fresh forages vis-à-vis processed feeds in confined ruminant operations. Applications and benefits of phytochemicals to humankind are yet to be fully understood or utilized. Scientific explorations have provided promising results, pending thorough vetting before primetime use, such that academic and commercial interests in the technology are fully adopted.","Tedeschi, Luis O; Muir, James P; Naumann, Harley D; Norris, Aaron B; Ramírez-Restrepo, Carlos A; Mertens-Talcott, Susanne U",Frontiers in veterinary science,https://doi.org/10.3389/fvets.2021.628445; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33748210/,498

However, the molecular mechanism underlying Ku70-dependent inhibition of Bax is not fully understood. Here, we show that the absence of Ku70 results in the accumulation of ubiquitylated Bax. Under normal growth conditions, Bax ubiquitylation promotes its degradation. Upon induction of apoptosis in wild-type cells, a significant reduction in the levels of ubiquitylated Bax was observed, whereas in Ku70(-/-) cells, the ubiquitylated Bax was robustly accumulated. Addition of recombinant Ku70 into a protein extract of Ku70(-/-) cells resulted in a decrease in the levels of ubiquitylated Bax, even in the presence of proteasome inhibitors. Moreover, an in vitro deubiquitylation assay demonstrated that recombinant Ku70 hydrolyzed polyubiquitin chains into monoubiquitin units. Thus, Ku70 regulates apoptosis by sequestering Bax from the mitochondria and mediating Bax deubiquitylation. These results shed light on the role of proteasome inhibitors as tumor suppressors.","Amsel, Avigail D; Rathaus, Moran; Kronman, Noam; Cohen, Haim Y",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0706700105; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18362350/,498
162415,The Placebo Effect on COVID Patients: When the Mind Cures the Body,2021,"Pig organ xenotransplantation offers a solution to the shortage of deceased human organs for transplantation. The pathobiological response to a pig xenograft is complex, involving antibody, complement, coagulation, inflammatory, and cellular responses. To overcome these barriers, genetic manipulation of the organ-source pigs has largely been directed to two major aims - (i) deletion of expression of the known carbohydrate xenoantigens against which humans have natural (preformed) antibodies, and (ii) transgenic expression of human protective proteins, e.g., complement- and coagulation-regulatory proteins. Conventional (FDA-approved) immunosuppressive therapy is unsuccessful in preventing an adaptive immune response to pig cells, but blockade of the CD40:CD154 costimulation pathway is successful. Survival of genetically-engineered pig kidneys in immunosuppressed nonhuman primates can now be measured in months. Non-immunological aspects, e.g., pig renal function, a hypovolemia syndrome, and rapid growth of the pig kidney after transplantation, are briefly discussed. We suggest that patients on the wait-list for a deceased human kidney graft who are unlikely to receive one due to long waiting times are those for whom kidney xenotransplantation might first be considered. The potential risk of infection, public attitudes to xenotransplantation, and ethical, regulatory, and financial aspects are briefly addressed.","Cooper, David K C; Hara, Hidetaka; Iwase, Hayato; Yamamoto, Takayuki; Wang, Zheng-Yu; Jagdale, Abhijit; Bikhet, Mohamed H; Nguyen, Huy Q; Foote, Jeremy B; Paris, Wayne D; Ayares, David; Kumar, Vineeta; Anderson, Douglas J; Locke, Jayme E; Eckhoff, Devin E",Clinical transplantation,https://doi.org/10.1111/ctr.14139; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33131148/,498

The identity of these rMCs is still elusive. Among them, Axin2Pos mesenchymal alveolar niche cells (MANCs), which are expressing Fgf7, have been previously described. We propose that an additional population of rMCs, expressing Fgf10 (called rMC-Sca1PosFgf10Pos) are equally important to maintain AT2 stem cell self-renewal. The alveolosphere model, based on the AT2-rMC co-culture in growth factor reduced Matrigel, was used to test the efficiency of different rMC subpopulations isolated by FACS from adult murine lung to sustain the self-renewal and differentiation of AT2 stem cells. We demonstrate that rMC-Sca1PosFgf10Pos cells are efficient to promote the self-renewal and differentiation of AT2 stem cells. Co-staining of adult lung for Fgf10 mRNA and Sftpc protein respectively, indicate that 28% of Fgf10Pos cells are located close to AT2 cells. Co-ISH for Fgf7 and Fgf10 indicate that these two populations do not significantly overlap. Gene arrays comparing rMC-Sca1PosAxin2Pos and rMC-Sca1PosFgf10Pos support that these two cell subsets express differential markers. In addition, rMC function is decreased in diabetic and obese ob/ob mutant compared to WT mice with a much stronger loss of function in males compared to females. In conclusion, rMC-Sca1PosFgf10Pos cells play important role in supporting AT2 stem cells self-renewal and differentiation. This result sheds a new light on the subpopulations of rMCs contributing to the AT2 stem cell niche in homeostasis and in the context of COVID-19 pathogenesis. Key message What is already known about the subject? Resident mesenchymal cells (rMCs defined as Cd31NegCd45NegEpcamNeg) control the self-renewal and differentiation of alveolar epithelial type 2 (AT2) stem cells in vitro. The identity of these rMCs is still elusive. Among them, Axin2Pos mesenchymal alveolar niche cells (MANCs), which are expressing Fgf7, have been previously described. What does this study add? Our study shows that an additional population of rMCs, expressing Fgf10 (called rMC-Sca1PosFgf10Pos) is equally important to maintain AT2 stem cell self-renewal. rMC-Sca1PosFgf10Pos are LipidToxHigh and are located close to AT2s. In addition, rMC-Sca1PosFgf10Pos cells support AT2 stem cell self-renewal and differentiation thereby identifying these cells as bone fide functional lipofibroblasts (LIFs). We have previously reported that LIF can transdifferentiate into activated MYF in the context of bleomycin-induced fibrosis in mice [1] and that activated MYF isolated from the lungs of end stage idiopathic fibrosis human patients can respond to Metformin to undergo transdifferentiation back to the LIF phenotype [2]. We also show that the function of rMCs-Sca1Pos is negatively impacted by gender and obesity, which represent two major aggravating factors for COVID-19 pathogenesis, leading to either death or major complications after infection recovery such as lung fibrosis. How might this impact on clinical practice and future development? By establishing that rMC-Sca1PosFgf10Pos are different from the MANCs, our study opens the way for a new key mesenchymal cell population that should be targeted to either prevent or reverse fibrosis. In addition, as this population maintains the AT2 stem cells self-renewal and differentiation, such targeting will also allow to progressively recover the loss in respiratory function.","Taghizadeh, Sara; Heiner, Monika; Wilhelm, Jochen; Herold, Susane; Chen, Chengshui; Zhang, JinSan; Bellusci, Saverio",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.28.428090,498

Methods: We conducted an open-label, randomized, non-inferiority trial, in Cameroon comparing Doxycycline 100mg, twice daily for 7 days versus Hydroxychloroquine, 400 mg daily for 5 days and Azithromycin 500mg at day 1 and 250mg from day 2 through 5, in mild COVID-19 patients. Clinical improvement, biological parameters and adverse events were assessed. The primary outcome was the proportion of clinical cure at day 3, 10 and 30. Non-inferiority was determined by the clinical cure rate between protocols with a 20 percentage points margin. Results: 194 participants underwent randomization and were treated with Doxycycline (n=97) or Hydroxychloroquine-Azithromycin (n=97). At day 3, 74/92 (80.4%) participants on Doxycycline versus 77/95 (81.1%) on Hydroxychloroquine-Azithromycin -based protocols were asymptomatic (p=0.91). At day 10, 88/92 (95.7%) participants on Doxycycline versus 93/95 (97.9%) on Hydroxychloroquine-Azithromycin were asymptomatic (p=0.44). At day 30 all participants were asymptomatic. SARS-CoV2 PCR was negative at Day 10 in 60/92 (65.2%) participants allocated to Doxycycline and 63/95 (66.3%) participants allocated to Hydroxychloroquine-Azithromycin. None of the participants were admitted for worsening of the disease after treatment initiation. Conclusion: Doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for 7 days is as effective and safe as Hydroxychloroquine-Azithromycin, for preventing clinical worsening of mild symptomatic or asymptomatic COVID-19, and achieving virological suppression","Sobngwi, E.; Zemsi, S.; Guewo-Fokeng, M.; Katte, J.

The purpose of this study is to assess the impact of COVID-19 on faculty teaching methods, assessment methods, and personal well-being. The study was a combination of a quantitative survey and a qualitative study using interviews of engineering faculty teaching in Spring 2020. In the first part, we surveyed all faculty teaching during Spring 2020 in the SJSU College of Engineering about their experiences after the move to 100% online instruction in March 2020. In the second part of the research, we interviewed 23 faculty members to obtain a more in-depth understanding of their experiences during the move online in Spring 2020. Overall, 98 faculty participated in the survey: lecturers (58), tenure-track (18), tenured (13), adjunct (1), and Teaching Associates (1). The faculty reported being worried about their family and their students' well-being. In addition, 65% of faculty members reported either a moderate or a great deal of stress related to the shelter in place, and this percentage was higher for female faculty (74%) and for tenure-track faculty (83%). Overall, faculty members felt that they had their classes under control most of the time and that the transition to online teaching was positive, even if they felt they had too much work to do and felt always in a hurry and under pressure. From a teaching perspective, the interviews highlight that faculty members' main concerns focus on testing and assessment and students' engagement. Overall, SJSU College of Engineering faculty members felt under stress in the transition to online teaching, especially the tenure-track faculty members, but were able to transition their classes with ease.","Chierichetti, M.; Backer, P.",Education Sciences,https://doi.org/10.3390/educsci11080419,498

The masked palm civets (Paguma larvata) served as an intermediate host in the bat-to-human transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 20031. Because of their unique role in the SARS outbreak, civets were suspected as a potential intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2, the etiological pathogen of the COVID-19 pandemic. Besides their susceptibility to coronaviruses, civets can also be infected by other viruses, such as canine distemper viruses2, parvoviruses3, influenza viruses4, etc. Regarding the ecological and economical role of civets, it is vital to evaluate the potential threats from different pathogens to these animals. Receptor binding is a necessary step for virus entry into host cells. Understanding the distribution of receptors of various viruses provides hints to their potential tissue tropisms. Herein, we characterized the cell atlas of five important organs (the frontal lobe, lung, liver, spleen and kidney) of masked palm civets (Paguma larvata) and described the expression profiles of receptor associated genes of 132 viruses from 25 families, including 16 viruses from 10 families reported before that can attack civets and 116 viruses with little infection record.","Chen, Dongsheng; Ou, Zhihua; Wang, Haoyu; Zhang, Yanan; Zhu, Jiacheng; An, Fuyu; Xu, Jinqian; Ding, Xiangning; Ding, Peiwen; Luo, Lihua; Wu, Weiying; Qin, Qiuyu; Wei, Yanan; Zhao, Wandong; Lv, Zhiyuan; Lan, Tianming; Li, Meiling; Zhang, Wensheng; Liu, Huan; Hua, Yan",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.20.452903,498

The introduction of AI workloads in the HPC applications basket has non-trivial consequences both on the way of designing AI applications and on the way of providing HPC computing. This is the leitmotif of the convergence between HPC and AI. The formalized definition of AI pipelines is one of the milestones of HPC-AI convergence. If well conducted, it allows, on the one hand, to obtain portable and scalable applications. On the other hand, it is crucial for the reproducibility of scientific pipelines. In this work, we advocate the StreamFlow Workflow Management System as a crucial ingredient to define a parametric pipeline, called""CLAIRE COVID-19 Universal Pipeline,""which is able to explore the optimization space of methods to classify COVID-19 lung lesions from CT scans, compare them for accuracy, and therefore set a performance baseline. The universal pipeline automatizes the training of many different Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and many different hyperparameters. It, therefore, requires a massive computing power, which is found in traditional HPC infrastructure thanks to the portability-by-design of pipelines designed with StreamFlow. Using the universal pipeline, we identified a DNN reaching over 90% accuracy in detecting COVID-19 lesions in CT scans.","Colonnelli, Iacopo; Cantalupo, Barbara; Spampinato, Concetto; Pennisi, Matteo; Aldinucci, Marco",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.01033v1.pdf,498

By analyzing plasma samples from 130 hemodialysis (HD) and 13 peritoneal dialysis patients after two doses of BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 vaccines, we found that 35% of the patients had low-level or undetectable IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S). Neutralizing antibodies against the vaccine-matched SARS-CoV-2 and Delta variant were low or undetectable in 49% and 77% of patients, respectively, and were further reduced against other emerging variants. The fraction of non-responding patients was higher in SARS-CoV-2-naive HD patients immunized with BNT162b2 (66%) than those immunized with mRNA-1273 (23%). The reduced neutralizing activity correlated with low antibody avidity, consistent with a delayed affinity maturation of SARS-CoV-2 S-specific B cells.

However, estimating vaccine effectiveness using observational data is inherently challenging because of the non-randomised design and the potential for unmeasured confounding. Methods: We used a Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD) to estimate vaccine effectiveness against COVID-19 mortality in England, exploiting the discontinuity in vaccination rates resulting from the UK's age-based vaccination priority groups. We used the fact that people aged 80 or over were prioritised for the vaccine roll-out in the UK to compare the risk of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 death in people aged 75-79 and 80-84. Findings: The prioritisation of vaccination of people aged 80 or above led to a large discrepancy in vaccination rates in people 80-84 compared to those 75-79 at the beginning of the vaccination campaign. We found a corresponding difference in COVID-19 mortality, but not in non-COVID-19 mortality, suggesting that our approach appropriately addresses the issue of unmeasured confounding factors. Our results suggest that the first vaccine dose reduced the risk of COVID-19 death by 70.5% (95% CI 18.2-117.7) in those aged 80. Interpretations: Our results support existing evidence that a first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine has a strong protective effect against COVID-19 mortality in older adults. The RDD estimate of vaccine effectiveness is comparable to previously published studies using different methods, suggesting that unmeasured confounding factors are unlikely to substantially bias these studies.","Bermingham, C.; Morgan, J.; Ayoubkhani, D.; Glickman, M.; Islam, N.; Sheikh, A.; Sterne, J.; Walker, A.

Scientists still have not found any closely related identification of these variants in the context of their evolution. The scrupulous deletion/mutations recognized inside the spike protein of the variants are emerging with an amplified pace and are observed to be associated with the alterations in the receptor-binding region (RBD) of the spike protein. This paper highlights the reported mechanistic studies conducted on SARS-CoV-2 mutant variants;the mutant virus’s ability in response to the antibody recognition to evade the immune system in humans. The role of cellular immunity in response to its interaction with SARS-CoV-2 variants and importantly the discussion on the antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of SARS-CoV-2 disease with therapeutic antibodies and vaccines has been highlighted. It is expected that this may likely be interesting and helpful for readers in clearing all their presumptions related to the spreading severity of the mutant virus strains and more importantly the effectiveness of current and upcoming vaccines for its possible control.

The wide availability of structured knowledge would allow us to take full advantage of these by enabling efficient human-computer interaction. Traditionally, biological knowledge is captured in publications and knowledge bases, however, the information in articles is not directly accessible to computers, and knowledge bases are constrained by finite resources available for manual curation. To accelerate knowledge capture and communication and to keep pace with the rapid growth of scientific reports, we developed the Biofactoid (biofactoid.org) software suite, which crowdsources structured knowledge in articles from authors. Biofactoid is a web-based system that lets scientists draw a network of interactions between genes, their products, and chemical compounds and employs smart-automation to translate user input into a structured language using the expressive power of a formal ontology. The resulting data is shared via public information resources, enabling author-curated knowledge to be appreciated in the context of all existing computable knowledge. Authors of recently published papers across a range of journals have already contributed their pathway information, much of which is novel and extends existing pathway databases into new biological areas.

We leverage the DomainTools COVID-19 Threat List and additional measurements to analyze over 150,000 domains registered between January 1st 2020 and May 1st 2020. We identify two key rationales for covid-related domain registrations. Online marketing, by either redirecting traffic or hosting a commercial service on the domain, and domain parking, by registering domains containing popular COVID-19 keywords, presumably anticipating a profit when reselling the domain later on. We also highlight three public policy take-aways that can counteract this domain registration behavior. © 2021 IEEE.","Pletinckx, S.; Jansen, G.

But this approach raises equity concerns based in law and ethics. Analysis of CDC data reveals that COVID-19 mortality in the U.S. rises 3-fold per decade of life. People with specific conditions (including certain disabilities and certain medical conditions) associated with a 3-fold or 6-fold risk ratio should therefore be granted vaccine eligibility along with people 10 or 20 years older, respectively. Along with additional recommendations on data collection and reporting, this could help address equity within an age-based framework.","Cobo-Lewis, A.

However, due to the errors in sequencing it is an active area of research to develop algorithms that can separate noise from the true variants. LoFreq is a state of the art algorithm for low-frequency variant detection but has a relatively long runtime compared to other tools. In addition to this, the interface for running in parallel could be simplified, allowing for multithreading as well as distributing jobs to a cluster. In this work we describe some specific contributions to LoFreq that remedy these issues.","Kille, B.; Liu, Y. X.; Sapoval, N.; Nute, M.; Rauchwerger, L.; Amato, N.; Treangen, T.

170443,Collaborative conversations during the time of COVID‐19: Building a “meta”‐learning community,2021,"Precision medicine, regarded as the future of healthcare, is gaining increasing attention these years. As an essential part of precision medicine, clinical omics have been successfully applied in disease diagnosis and prognosis using machine learning techniques. However, existing methods mainly make predictions based on gene-level individual features or their random combinations, none of the previous work has considered the activation of signaling pathways. Therefore, the model interpretability and accuracy are limited, and reasonable signaling pathways are yet to be discovered. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-level attention graph neural network (MLA-GNN), which applies weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) to format the omic data of each patient into graph-structured data, and then constructs multi-level graph features, and fuses them through a well-designed multi-level graph feature fully fusion (MGFFF) module to conduct multi-task prediction. Moreover, a novel full-gradient graph saliency mechanism is developed to make the MLA-GNN interpretable. MLA-GNN achieves state-of-the-art performance on transcriptomic data from TCGA-LGG/TCGA-GBM and proteomic data from COVID-19/non-COVID-19 patient sera. More importantly, the proposed model’s decision can be interpreted in the signaling pathway level and is consistent with the clinical understanding.","Xing, Xiaohan; Yang, Fan; Li, Hang; Zhang, Jun; Zhao, Yu; Jiang, Biaobin; Huang, Junzhou; Meng, Max Q.-H.; Yao, Jianhua",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.03.409755,498

Solid phase immune electron microscopy (SPIEM) allowed quantification of NA1 virions and identification of faecal samples with optimal virus levels. NA1 particles were 36.6 nm in diameter, had an indefinite surface structure resembling that of human small round structured viruses (SRSVs), and a buoyant density of 1.34 g ml−1. A single capsid protein of 49.4 kDa was detected by Western blotting in purified NA1 preparations prepared from post-infection but not pre-infection faecal samples and with post- but not pre-infection sera. NA1 was antigenically unrelated to the bovine enteric calicivirus NA2 by SPIEM. These properties were consistent with classification of NA1 within the Caliciviridae but demonstrated heterogeneity in the capsid composition of bovine enteric caliciviruses.","Dastjerdi, Akbar M.; Snodgrass, David R.; Bridger, Janice C.",FEMS Microbiology Letters,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378109700004225; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378109700004225,498

A potentially positive outcome of the current crisis could be the development of a more data privacy and human rights compliant framework for digital identity. However, for such a framework to thrive, two essential conditions must be met: (1) respect for and protection of data privacy irrespective of the type of architecture or technology chosen and (2) consideration of the broader impacts that digital identity can have on individuals’ human rights. The article draws on legal, technology-facing, and policy-oriented academic literature to evaluate each of these conditions. It then proposes two ways to leverage the process of digitalization strengthened by the pandemic: a data privacy-centric and a human rights-based approach to digital identity solutions fit for post-COVID-19 societies.","Beduschi, Ana",Data &amp; Policy,https://doi.org/10.1017/dap.2021.15,498

By introducing a lockdown period, we show that the final number of deaths can be reduced substantially and observe that a budget collapse introduces rather extreme effects. We find that there exists a well-defined optimal starting point for a lockdown. We also looked at the consequences of a loss of immunity and found that then a budget collapse can occur for smaller costs of medical treatment. © 2021 World Scientific Publishing Company.","Aucouturier, M.; Herrmann, H.

It is very much visible since the patients have to avail medical facilities thereby maintaining the rules of social distancing and isolation to break the chain of virus transmission within the society. To achieve this objective, advanced information and communication, technology-based video conferencing tools may be widely used to deliver medical consultancy to the patients in this pandemic situation. Since this entire electronic communication is dependent on the internet, which is itself an open digital space, this electronic communication between the patients and the medical practitioners are highly susceptible to infringement attempt of the adversary. Even the hardware component used by the patients during this electronic healthcare transaction like the camera, speaker, etc. of the end-devices may remain under the control of adversary even after the completion of the electronic transaction. As a result, the adversary may record any personal moment or personal file system of the user without its knowledge. To de-escalate and arrest the access of adversary over the resources of user, it is pertinent to study the risk factors and their security protocols in similar cases to manage the vulnerabilities and to propose the enhanced security model to ensure the integrity of the electronic healthcare transaction. In this paper, authors have studied those existing security protocols to propose a secured audio and video conferencing system through wired and wireless network with control and command of all the resources with the actual user only. The objective of this study is to maintain a logfile in a secure manner to note down the access and release of resources during the audio and video conference. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Sil, R.; Debnath, N.; Roy, A.","1st International Conference on Advances in Medical Physics and Healthcare Engineering, AMPHE 2020",https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-33-6915-3_43,498

Although this work-place concept has been used in other industries, many Malaysian universities continue with the conventional work-place policies, with close monitoring. With the COVID-19 pandemic, Working from Home (WFH), a common form of flexible working arrangement, has become a new normal globally, transforming the entire workplace model, irrespective of business or industry. The objective of this study was to explore the perception of Malaysian academics on working from home, with regards to work-life balance and stress. Using a qualitative approach of focus group discussion, eight academics, from both public and private universities, were interviewed online. Findings revealed that WFH helps to improve work-life balance due to reduced stress for academics in Malaysia. This outcome will be useful in policymaking, where organizations are planning to change work policies to enhance employee productivity, especially with the COVID-19 pandemic experience. As knowledge workers' mind never switches off a structured WFH policy can contribute to academics' well-being, which is also in line with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals 3 (SDG 3).","Subramaniam, G.; Ramachandran, J.; Putit, L.; Shariff, S.

Study design: Retrospective study. Place and duration of study: Department of Medicine, Bahria International Hospital, Lahore, Pakistan15thApril 2020 to 31stDecember 2020. Methodology: Twenty-three patients 18 out of which were kidney transplant recipients while 5 were liver transplant recipients. All the solid organ transplant patients who were admitted with Sars CoV2 (Corona virus) infection were recorded. Their charts were reviewed regarding clinical course, management, and outcome of COVID-19 infection in recipients of solid organ (liver and kidney) transplant. Results: Mean age was 44.8±10.9 years. Median time lapsed from transplant surgery to admission was 2.88 years (interquartile range 2.25, 7.33). Median hospital stay was 15 days (interquartile range 13, 28). All 23 patients were admitted and managed, with 17 (73.91%) admitted in ICU. Over half of the cases (58.2%) presented with raised serum creatinine due to acute kidney injury. 80% received azithromycin, Tocilizumab and 50% received Remdesivir. Antimetabolites with or without calcineurin inhibitors were held or reduced. A total of 5 patients had died while the others 18 patients (78.26%) were discharged home. Conclusion: There is a theoretical high risk of getting Sars CoV-2 infection in post-transplant patients but we did not find any increase in overall mortality in solid organ transplant recipients receiving immunosuppressive therapy who acquired Sars CoV2 infection as compared with mortality in the general patients with SARS-CoV-2.

172665,Cultural and linguistic struggles and solidarities of Emirati learners in online classes during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"Finding novel biomarkers for human pathologies and predicting clinical outcomes for patients is rather challenging. This stems from the heterogenous response of individuals to disease which is also reflected in the inter-individual variability of gene expression responses. This in turn obscures differential gene expression analysis (DGE). In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, we wondered whether an alternative to DGE approaches could be applied to dissect the molecular nature of a host-response to infection exemplified here by an analysis of H1N1 influenza, community/hospital acquired pneumonia (CAP) and sepsis. To this end, we turned to the analysis of ensemble gene noise. Ensemble gene noise, as we defined it here, represents a variance within an individual for a collection of genes encoding for either members of known biological pathways or subunits of annotated protein complexes. From the law of total variance, ensemble gene noise depends on the stoichiometry of the ensemble genes’ expression and on their average noise (variance). Thus, rather than focusing on specific genes, ensemble gene noise allows for the holistic identification and interpretation of gene expression disbalance on the level of gene networks and systems. Comparing H1N1, CAP and sepsis patients we spotted common disturbances in a number of pathways/protein complexes relevant to the sepsis pathology which lead to an increase in the ensemble gene noise. Among others, these include mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I and peroxisomes which could be readily targeted for adjuvant treatment by methylene blue and 4-phenylbutyrate respectively. Finally, we showed that ensemble gene noise could be successfully applied for the prediction of clinical outcome, namely mortality, of CAP and sepsis patients. Thus, we conclude that ensemble gene noise represents a promising approach for the investigation of molecular mechanisms of a pathology through a prism of alterations in coherent expression of gene circuits.","de Jong, Tristan; Guryev, Victor; Moshkin, Yury M.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.10.035717,498

Objectives: The objective of this review is to describe the published scientific evidence regarding coinfection in patients with COVID-19. Methods: A bibliographic search of studies published in Spanish or English was carried out using the PubMed, The Cochrane Library and Google Scholar search engines. Studies published between January 2020 and January 24, 2021 were assessed. Results: 25 articles from various continents (America, Asia and Europe) were included. All the studies had patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 added to some other test that identified some co-infection. We identified 18 studies that showed bacterial coinfection, 17 studies of viral coinfection and 5 studies of fungal coinfection. The prevalence of coinfection showed extremely dissimilar figures according to the population studied and diagnostic criteria. Conclusions: The presence of coinfection seems to be linked to a higher frequency of unfavorable outcomes. However, it is important to develop Latin American studies, given the heterogeneity in the studies seen in different countries. Standardized definitions should be developed in order to be able to assess the impact of coinfections in patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19.","Quinones-Laveriano, D.

We then compare the simulation results of our three epidemiological models of interest against the daily reported COVID-19 case counts across the time period from 23rd January to 6th April 2020. Finally, we compare and evaluate on the performance and accuracy of the aforementioned models' simulations. Methods: Three epidemiological models are used to forecast the true growth of COVID-19 case counts by accounting for asymptomatic infections in Singapore. They are the exponential model, SEIR model with hospitalization dynamics (SEIHRD), and the SEIHRD model with inclusion of asymptomatic cases (SEAIHRD). Results: Simulation results of all three models reflect underestimation of COVID-19 cases in Singapore during the early stages of the pandemic. At a 40% asymptomatic proportion, we report basic reproduction number R0 = 3.28 and 3.74 under the SEIHRD and SEAIHRD models respectively. At a 60% asymptomatic proportion, we report R0 = 3.48 and 3.96 under the SEIHRD and SEAIHRD models respectively. Conclusions: Based on the results of different simulation scenarios, we are highly confident that the number of COVID-19 cases in Singapore was underestimated during the early stages of the pandemic. This is supported by the exponential increase of COVID-19 cases in Singapore as the pandemic developed.","Liew, F.

They have opened possibilities for online learning and interaction, but have also posed new challenges for instructors. This article provides insights into one teacher's interactions and examines how the instructor presence is expressed in the teachers' activities in virtual classrooms in higher education. Instructor presence is investigated using the social and teaching presence indicators of the community of inquiry (CoI) framework. Twelve hours of interactions across six online classes were recorded, transcribed, and analysed using content analysis. The findings suggest that indicators of teaching presence dominate interactions in a virtual classroom, but it often involves co-occurrences of indicators of social presence. The typical features of instructor presence included addressing students by name, encouraging them, expressing gratitude for and acknowledging their contributions, describing actions on the dashboard, clarifying and summarising content, and responding to technical concerns. These findings may suggest holistic and pedagogical ways to understand and develop synchronous online interactions and teaching and learning practices.

Such concerns are often not visible to individual departments in an integrated healthcare system. In addition, many healthcare organisations do not possess cyber skills and are faced with barriers to the adoption of smart manufacturing technologies, e.g., cost.

In this study, we investigated whether a measurable sense of agency can be detected for mental actions, without the contribution of motor components. We used a fake action-effect paradigm, where participants were led to think that a motor action or a particular thought could trigger a sound. Results showed that the high-level sense of agency, measured through explicit reports, was of comparable strength for motor and mental actions. The ‘intentional binding’ effect, a phenomenon typically associated with the experience of agency, was also observed for both motor and mental actions, with the only exception of short action-effect delays. Furthermore, a consistent relationship between explicit reports of agency and intentional binding was found. Taken together, our results provide novel insights into the specific role of intentional cues in instantiating a sense of agency, even in the absence of motor signals. These results may have important implications for future brain-computer interfaces as well as for the study of pathological disruptions of agency.","Lopez-Sola, Edmundo; Moreno-Bote, Rubén; Arsiwalla, Xerxes D.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.30.428924,498

An exploration of the challenges faced by rural-based University of KwaZulu Natal students,2021,"Background: Disasters and other community-wide events can introduce significant interruptions and trauma to impacted communities. Children and young people can be disproportionately affected with additional educational disruptions. With the increasing threat of climate change, establishing a timely and adaptable framework to evaluate the impact of disasters on academic achievement is needed. However, analytical challenges are posed by the availability issue of individual-level data. Methods: A new method, Bayesian hierarchical meta-regression, was developed to evaluate the impact of the 2014 Hazelwood mine fire (a six-week fire event in Australia) using only aggregated school-level data from the standardised National Assessment Program-Literacy and Numeracy (NAPLAN) test. NAPLAN results and school characteristics (2008-2018) from 69 primary/secondary schools with different levels of mine fire-related smoke exposure were used to estimate the impact of the event. Using an interrupted time-series design, the model estimated immediate effects and post-interruption trend differences with full Bayesian statistical inference. Results: Major academic interruptions across NAPLAN domains were evident in high exposure schools in the year post-mine fire (highest in Writing: 11.09 [95%CI: 3.16-18.93], lowest in Reading: 8.34 [95%CI: 1.07-15.51]). The interruption was comparable to a three to four-month delay in educational attainment and had not fully recovered after several years. Conclusions: Considerable academic delays were found as a result of a mine fire, highlighting the need to provide educational and community-based supports in response to future events.

Results We first observed negative associations between the sleep index and the two AAs, and demonstrated that the change of AAs could be the consequence of sleep quality using Mendelian randomization with genetic risk scores of sleep index and BAs. Particularly, one unit increase in sleep index was associated with 0.105- and 0.125-year decreases in KDM-biological age acceleration and PhenoAge acceleration, respectively. Furthermore, we observed significant independent and joint effects of sleep and air pollution (i.e. PM2.5 and NO2), another key driver of aging, on BAs. Sleep quality also showed modifying effect on the associations of elevated PM2.5 and NO2 levels with accelerated aging. For instance, an interquartile range increase in PM2.5 level was associated with 0.011-, 0.047-, and 0.078-year increase in PhenoAge acceleration among people with high (5-6), medium (3-4), and low (0-2) sleep index, respectively. Conclusions Our findings elucidate that better sleep quality could lessen accelerated biological aging resulting from exogenous exposures including air pollution.

Faculty, students, institutions, and parents have had to rapidly adapt and adopt measures to make the best use of available resources, tools and teaching strategies. While much of the online teaching pedagogies have been theoretically and practically explored to a limited extent, the scale at which these were deployed was unprecedented. This has led a large number of researchers to share challenges, solutions and knowledge gleaned during this period. The main aim of this work was to thematically model the literature related to teaching and learning during, and about, COVID-19. Abstracts and metadata of literature were extracted from Scopus, and topic modeling was used to identify the key research themes. The research encompassed diverse scientific disciplines, including social sciences, computer science, and life sciences, as well as learnings in support systems, including libraries, information technology, and mental health. The following six key themes were identified: (i) the impact of COVID-19 on higher education institutions, and challenges faced by these institutions;(ii) the use of various tools and teaching strategies employed by these institutions;(iii) the teaching and learning experience of schools and school teachers;(iv) the impact of COVID-19 on the training of healthcare workers;(v) the learnings about COVID-19, and treatment strategies from patients;and (vi) the mental health of students as a result of COVID-19 and e-learning. Regardless of the key themes, what stood out was the inequities in education as a result of the digital divide. This has had a huge impact not only in middle- and low-income nations, but also in several parts of the developed world. Several important lessons have been learned, which, no doubt, will be actively incorporated into teaching and learning practices and teacher training. Nonetheless, the full effect of these unprecedented educational adaptions on basic education, expert training, and mental health of all stakeholders is yet to be fully fathomed.","Vijayan, Ranjit",Education Sciences,https://doi.org/10.3390/educsci11070347,498
175575,Non-compliance with COVID-19 safe distancing measures: Tips from crisis negotiators to de-escalate situations,2020,"IntroductionTelecommuting is defined as “a work practice that involves members of an organization substituting a portion of their typical work hours to work away from a central workplace, using technology to interact with others as needed to conduct work tasks”. The prevalence rate of telecommuting in Sapin in 2019 was 5%, while this rate grew up to 34% during de COVID-19 pandemic.ObjectivesThe purpose of this poster is to make a review about how telecommuting affects the employees’ mental health.MethodsA review os the available literature on employees’ menthal health.ResultsMost employers who offer telecommuting consider it a strategic decision for their businesses: it could reduce the expenses of physically accommodating the employees, and it might help employers to contact their subordinates anytime, if needed. Many articles in the popular press about telecommuting extol the benefits of this practice on employees’ health (work-life balance, reduction of travel expenses). However, only a handful of empirical studies substantiate these claims (job satisfaction, quality of life, and role-related stress). Less discussed is the potential of telecommuting to have a negative impact on employees’ health. It may increase both social and professional isolation, which in turn is associated with higher levels of emotional exhaustion, cynicism, cognitive stress complaints and lower levels of work engagement.ConclusionsFinally, although it is not as effective as personal contact, organizations may stimulate qualitative virtual interaction with coworkers by providing robust online meeting tools and infrastructure, so users can seamlessly collaborate regardless of their physical location.","Molina Lietor, M.

However, the impact of this inequitable distribution on COVID-19 outcomes is unknown. This observational study determined the association between zip-code level vaccination rate and COVID-19 mortality in residents of 52 Chicago zip codes. After controlling for age distribution and recovery from infection, a 10% higher vaccination rate by March 28, 2021, was associated with a 39% lower relative risk of death during the peak of the spring wave of COVID-19. Using a difference-in-difference analysis, Chicago could have prevented an estimated 72% of deaths in the least vaccinated quartile of the city (vaccination rates of 17.8 - 26.9%) if it had had the same vaccination rate as the most vaccinated quartile (39.9 - 49.3%). Inequitable vaccine allocation in Chicago likely exacerbated existing racial disparities in COVID-19 mortality.","Zeng, S.; Pelzer, K. M.; Gibbons, R. D.; Peek, M. E.; Parker, W.

175708,An Update on Transfusion Related Immunomodulation (TRIM) in a Time of COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"Protein-peptide interactions play a fundamental role in facilitating many cellular processes, but remain underexplored experimentally and difficult to model computationally. Here, we present PepNN-Struct and PepNN-Seq, structure and sequence-based approaches for the prediction of peptide binding sites on a protein given the sequence of a peptide ligand. A main difficulty for the prediction of peptide-protein interactions is the flexibility of peptides and their tendency to undergo conformational changes upon binding. To account for this behaviour, we developed a novel reciprocal attention module that simultaneously updates the encodings of peptide and protein residues and explicitly enforces the symmetry in the updates, allowing for information flow and reflecting the biochemical reality of conformational changes in the peptide. PepNN additionally makes use of modern graph neural network layers that are effective at learning representations of molecular structure. Finally, to compensate for the scarcity of peptide-protein complex structural information, we make use of available protein-protein complex and protein sequence information through a series of transfer learning steps. PepNN-Struct achieves state-of-the-art performance on the task of identifying peptide binding sites, with a ROC AUC of 0.893 and an MCC of 0.483 on an independent test set. Beyond prediction of binding sites on proteins with a known peptide ligand, we also show that the developed models make reasonable peptide-agnostic predictions, allowing for the identification of novel peptide binding proteins.","Abdin, Osama; Nim, Satra; Wen, Han; Kim, Philip M.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.10.426132,498
175885,Mental strength and coping strategy of confined athletes dealing with covid-19,2021,"Introduction. The COVID-19 pandemic has initiated the rapid introduction of digital technology into the educational process. The purpose of the article is to analyze the particularities of the perception of the processes of digitalization of education by Russian students, to identify factors for its success, to comprehend the experience of online learning in the context of the pandemic. Methods. The leading research method was a questionnaire survey of Russian university students. The sample was 1,553 people and was spontaneous in nature. Due to quarantine restrictions at the time of the survey (February-April 2020), the survey was conducted online: The questionnaire was posted on the Google platform, the link to which was sent to the student virtual communities. To clarify the data obtained, two focus groups were organized in January-February 2021 with the participation of full-Time and part-Time students. Each focus group was represented by 12 participants. Results. The majority of respondents (83.8%) have a positive attitude to the digitalization of education, highly evaluating the importance of digital literacy of young people (86.9%). Students associate the advantages and disadvantages of digitalization of education with their own experience of online learning during the pandemic. The following negative effects of digitalization of education were identified: deterioration of interpersonal communication skills (58.3%), reduction of classroom time, live communication with the teacher (49.3%), reduction of students knowledge (37.3%), reduced concentration, a distraction from educational goals (33.4%). The majority of respondents believe that the success of learning in a digital environment depends on the competence of the teacher (67.1%) and the material and technical equipment of the university (69%). Conclusions. With the rapid introduction of digital technologies into the educational space, there is an increasing need to develop interactive teaching methods, increase students motivation, and preserve the principles of traditional pedagogy. Digitalization of education implies modernization of pedagogical practices, where a special role is given to the formation of media competence of young people, their analytical skills, abilities for critical thinking and effective communication. © 2021 LLC Ecological Help.

176204,Nowcasting food insecurity on a global scale,2021-07-02,"As the Coronavirus 2019 pandemic creates worldwide shortages of personal protective equipment, hospitals have increasingly turned to sterilization and re-use protocols, often without significant data supporting the specific methodologies. When using UV-C irradiation, previously shown to be effective for decontaminating hard surfaces, modeling shows the importance of accounting for the porosity and non-uniform curvature of the N95 masks in decontamination procedures. Data shows a standard incident dose of 1 J/cm^2 delivered to both front and back surfaces is more than 500x higher than the known kill dose. However, modeling indicates this would undertreat 40% of the mask material due to the curvature, path-length attenuation and scatter. Multidirectional UV-C irradiation employing dose calibrated exposures can adjust for this loss and best decontaminate masks. Such protocols can be rapidly implemented in thousands of hospitals across the world equipped with UV-C irradiation lamps without the need for additional capital equipment purchases.","Sears, A.

However, the success of that strategy depends on the shape of the dose-response curve, which relates the response of the exposed person to the pathogen dose received from surrounding infected people. If the reduction is achieved by spending more time with each contacted person, the pathogen charge received from each infected individual will be larger. The extended time spent close to each person may worsen the expected response if the dose-response curve is concave for small doses. This is the case when the expected response is negligible below a certain dose threshold and rises sharply above it. This paper proposes a mathematical model to calculate the expected response and uses it to identify the conditions when it would be advisable to reduce the contact time with each individual even at the cost of increasing the number of contacted people.","Mello, B.

177210,O35 Global Food and Nutrition Insecurity Due to COVID-19 over 2020: Perspectives from a Survey of Nutrition Educators Across 5 Continents,2021,"Background: The current pandemic has led to a proliferation of predictive models being developed to address various aspects of COVID-19 patient care. We aimed to develop an online platform that would serve as an open source repository for a curated subset of such models, and provide a simple interface for included models to allow for online calculation. This platform would support doctors during decision-making regarding diagnoses, prognoses, and follow-up of COVID-19 patients, expediting the models’ transition from research to clinical practice. Methods: In this pilot study, we performed a literature search in the PubMed and WHO databases to find suitable models for implementation on our platform. All selected models were publicly available (peer reviewed publications or open source repository) and had been validated (TRIPOD type 3 or 2b). We created a method for obtaining the regression coefficients if only the nomogram was available in the original publication. All predictive models were transcribed on a practical graphical user interface using PHP 8.0.0, and were published online together with supporting documentation and links to the associated articles. Results: The open source website currently incorporates nine models from six different research groups, evaluated on datasets from different countries. The website will continue to be populated with other models related to COVID-19 prediction as these become available. This dynamic platform allows COVID-19 researchers to contact us to have their model curated and included on our website, thereby increasing the reach and real-world impact of their work. Conclusion: We have successfully demonstrated in this pilot study that our website provides an inclusive platform for predictive models related to COVID-19. It enables doctors to supplement their judgment with patient-specific predictions from externally validated models in a user-friendly format. Additionally, this platform supports researchers in showcasing their work, which will increase the visibility and use of their models.","Halilaj, Iva Chatterjee Avishek van Wijk Yvonka Wu Guangyao van Eeckhout Brice Oberije Cary Lambin Philippe",BioMed,https://doi.org/10.3390/biomed1010003,498
177365,Flattening the Pandemic Curve of COVID-19 Explosion in India,2021,"In the spring of 2020, remote learning was implemented in schools throughout the world due to the pandemic of SARS CoV-2, the novel coronavirus that causes the disease COVID-19. Thrust into online instruction, many science teachers scrambled during this transition, and classes were severely hampered by a lack of hands-on investigations involving critical thinking and problem-solving skills. In response to a need for online experimentation, bioinformatics lessons centered around SARS-CoV-2 were developed. This article presents a multipart bioinformatics lesson that allows students to (1) compare spike protein sequences from the database portal NCBI Virus, to investigate whether this protein would be a good target for a vaccine against COVID-19;and (2) create phylogenetic trees and demonstrate evolutionary relatedness of human coronaviruses. This lesson allows for instruction in molecular biology, virology, immunology, bioinformatics, and phylogenetics, as well as analysis of scientific data. It is appropriate for high school AP Biology and biotechnology courses and can be taught entirely online.","Anderson, Nadja Wilch Margaret",The American Biology Teacher,https://doi.org/10.1525/abt.2021.83.7.464,498
177938,Approach of Physiotherapist towards Patient during COVID-19 Pandemic in Rural Area,2021,"IntroductionIppokrateio Therapeutirio in the city of Larissa, Thessaly, Greece is a private for-profit psychogeriatric hospital focusing on Long Term Care on patients with dementia. During the COVID-19 era lockdown visits by carers/relatives/friends were forbidden due to the preventive government measures. At that same time appearance and/or exaggeration of neuropsychiatric symptoms was observed. In order to restore communication issues we performed telecommunication sessions (videocalls) and measured, among other factors, neuropsychiatric symptoms before and after sessions.ObjectivesPrimary objective was to check for relations between video-calls and changes in neuropsychiatric symptoms using NeuroPsychiatric Inventory (NPI). Secondary objective was to check for carers and patients satisfaction, mainly through qualitative information.Methods120 patients with diagnosis of minor or major neuroconitive disorder of any type participated in the video call sessions. Two video calls per patient took place (1 per week) with a 10-inches tablet. Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) was performed before the start of the video-calls. NPI had been performed again the week after both sessions were completed. Satisfaction of carers and patients was recorded, mostly as qualitative data.ResultsNeuropsychiatric symptoms improved in patients with mild or moderate neurocognitive decline. In more severe cases though anxiety, irritability and sleep problems worsened. Satisfaction reached almost 95% of the carers.ConclusionsVideo calls could be a very good way to surpass the communication burden during the pandemic restrictions for LTC dementia patients. Caution should be given to severely demented patients since clinical observations show that a cluster of symptoms worsens.","Konstantinou, A.",European Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1192/j.eurpsy.2021.745,498

Self-palpation accompanied by visual observation can be used to assess points of tenderness. Strength testing can be performed against gravity or by using household objects with known weights. Many special tests (e.g., the Thessaly test with knee flexion at 20° for meniscal tears) can also be translated to a virtual setting by verbally guiding patients through relevant positioning and motions. ¼: Postoperative wound assessment can be performed in the virtual setting by instructing the patient to place a ruler next to the wound for measuring the dimensions and using white gauze for color control. The wound can be visually assessed when the patient's camera or smartphone is positioned 6 to 18 in (15 to 46 cm) away and is held at a 45° angle to the incision.","Emara, Ahmed K; Zhai, Kevin L; Rothfusz, Christopher A; Minkara, Anas A; Genin, Jason; Horton, Scott; King, Dominic; Schaffer, Jonathan L; Piuzzi, Nicolas S",JBJS rev,https://doi.org/10.2106/jbjs.rvw.21.00047,498

Materials and Methods We represent RCT cohort enrollment as random binary classification fairness problems, and then show how ML fairness metrics based on enrollment fraction can be efficiently calculated using easily computed rates of subpopulations in RCT cohorts and target populations. We propose standardized versions of these metrics and deploy them in an interactive tool to analyze three RCTs with respect to type-2 diabetes and hypertension target populations in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Results We demonstrate how the proposed metrics and associated statistics enable users to rapidly examine representativeness of all subpopulations in the RCT defined by a set of categorical traits (e.g., sex, race, ethnicity, smoker status, and blood pressure) with respect to target populations. Discussion The normalized metrics provide an intuitive standardized scale for evaluating representation across subgroups, which may have vastly different enrollment fractions and rates in RCT study cohorts. The metrics are beneficial complements to other approaches (e.g., enrollment fractions and GIST) used to identify generalizability and health equity of RCTs. Conclusion By quantifying the gaps between RCT and target populations, the proposed methods can support generalizability evaluation of existing RCT cohorts, enrollment target decisions for new RCTs, and monitoring of RCT recruitment, ultimately contributing to more equitable public health outcomes.","Qi, M.; Cahan, O.; Foreman, M.

178317,P73 Cultivating Connections with Farm to School Activities During School Closures,2021,"Obesity and associated diseases, such as diabetes, have reached epidemic proportions globally. In the era of ‘diabesity’ and due to its central role for metabolic and endocrine processes, adipose tissue (specifically white adipose tissue; WAT) has become a target of high interest for therapeutic strategies. To gain insights in cellular and molecular mechanisms of adipose (patho-)physiology, researchers traditionally relied on animal models since in vitro studies on human WAT are challenging due to the large size, buoyancy, and fragility of mature white adipocytes. Leveraging the Organ-on-Chip technology, we introduce a next-generation microphysiological in vitro model of human WAT based on a tailored microfluidic platform featuring vasculature-like perfusion. The platform integrates a 3D tissue comprising all major WAT-associated cellular components in an autologous manner, including not only mature adipocytes but also organotypic endothelial barriers and stromovascular cells featuring tissue-resident innate immune cells, specifically adipose tissue macrophages. This microphysiological tissue model recapitulates pivotal WAT functions, such as energy storage and mobilization as well as endocrine and immunomodulatory activities. The combination of all individual cell types with extra cellular matrix-like hydrogels in a precisely controllable bottom-up approach enables the generation of a multitude of replicates from the same donors circumventing issues of inter-donor variability and paving the way for personalized medicine. Moreover, it allows to adjust the model’s degree of complexity to fit a specific purpose via a flexible mix- and-match approach with different cell component modules. This novel WAT-on-chip system constitutes a human-based, autologous and immunocompetent in vitro model of adipose tissue that recapitulates almost full tissue heterogeneity. In the future, the new WAT-on-chip model can become a powerful tool for human-relevant research in the field of metabolism and its associated diseases as well as for compound testing and personalized- and precision medicine applications.","Rogal, Julia; Xu, Raylin; Roosz, Julia; Teufel, Claudia; Cipriano, Madalena; Eisler, Wiebke; Weiss, Martin; Schenke-Layland, Katja; Loskill, Peter",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.08.455559,498

Methods This Phase 2, modified double-blind, parallel-group study (NCT04762680) was conducted in adults, including those at increased risk of severe COVID-19. Participants were randomised 1:1:1, stratified by age (18-59/[≥]60 years), rapid serodiagnostic test (positive/negative) and high-risk medical conditions (yes/no), to receive two injections (day [D]1 and D22) of 5{micro}g, 10{micro}g or 15{micro}g of CoV2 preS dTM antigen with fixed AS03 content. Interim safety and reactogenicity results (to D43) and neutralising antibodies (Nabs) against the D614G variant are presented (primary objectives). Findings Of 722 participants enrolled and randomised between 24 February and 8 March 2021, 721 received [≥]1 injections (5{micro}g, n=240; 10{micro}g, n=239; 15{micro}g, n=242).

180401,Reconsidering overdue fines in the midst of a pandemic,2021,"There is an emerging history of corporate charitable giving targeted at socio-economic development challenges in West African countries such as Nigeria and Ghana. This has been done through either culturally embedded forms of giving or institutional strategic forms of giving. Some of these types of corporate giving had been criticized for being unsustainable, ad-hoc and inadequately targeted. West African countries such as Nigeria and Ghana have also been in the spotlight, because they are countries endowed with abundant natural resources and increasing business presence (multinational and local). Yet the development and business environment challenges of these countries, pre-COVID, were still significant. The intended analysis of corporate responses to the crisis presented by Coronavirus is an opportunity to explore the context and forms in which corporate charitable giving emerges. It is also an opportunity to re-evaluate the role of such philanthropy and to suggest potential ways in which such responses can be embodied in sustained corporate responsibility practices geared towards sustainable human development. The chapter presents as illustrative cases, the response to Coronavirus by corporate organizations in the region which, prior to the crisis, were moving beyond basic charitable giving towards sustained Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) practices to drive sustainable development. These cases will also include COVID-specific responses such as the Private Sector Coalition Against COVID-19 (CACOVID, Nigeria) and COVID-19 Private Sector Fund (Ghana). These funds have been involved in collaborative private sector provision of medical equipment, treatment facilities and palliatives for the poor. This has also involved critical public and private sector engagement, as well as strategic impact initiatives geared at enhancing public health and well-being. The chapter also explores two specific company examples for analysis of potential impact and challenges. The aim is to suggest what this might mean for CSR practices in the region. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Okoye, A.; Nwagwu, I.","Palgrave Studies in Governance, Leadership and Responsibility",https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-73847-1_8,498
180774,Towards an aesthetics of belief in covid19 pandemic time: Performatism in brian friel's dancing at lughnasa,2021,"Objective The roll-out of the Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine has brought many logistical challenges, such as the absence of comprehensive stability data leading to strict handling instructions during dilution and administration. Accidental mishandling therefore presents challenging clinical dilemmas, which often led vaccine providers to err on the side of caution and discard mishandled vials rather than risk administering ineffective vaccine. This study aims to answer key questions about the vaccine's stability to allow for a more informed decision-making process should a non-conformity occur. Methods Residual vaccine in freshly used, but appropriately stored vials collected from vaccination centres in Brighton, UK, were tested after exposure to various handling conditions and analysed by dynamic light scattering to determine the size of the lipid-mRNA nanoparticles, and gel electrophoresis to visualise the mRNA integrity and separation from the lipid formulation. Results Knocking or dropping vaccine samples from small heights resulted in lowest levels of instability, indicating low risk of compromising clinical efficacy. However, repeated drawing and injecting through 23 G needles at high speed and, more significantly, shaking and vortexing led to progressive increase in the size and polydispersity index of the lipid-mRNA nanoparticles, coupled with or caused by up to ∼50% release of mRNA from the lipid formulation. This is thought to impact the vaccine's efficacy due to lack of free mRNA protection and cellular internalisation. Conclusions These results reiterate the importance of adhering to the manufacturer's instructions on handling, especially with regard to shaking and exposing the vaccine to excessive vibration. © Authors 2021","Kudsiova, L.; Lansley, A.; Scutt, G.; Allen, M.; Bowler, L.; Williams, S.; Lippett, S.; Stafford, S.; Tarzi, M.; Cross, M.; Okorie, M.",BMJ Open Science,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjos-2021-100203,498

It is an RNA-type virus that affects humans and animals and causes a wide range of respiratory infections. It also leads to human pneumonia. The development of the virus recognition system relied heavily on computer programs. Numerous experiments and research have been conducted in computer science in order to identify any treatments and explore the effects of the disease.

180988,Effective Teaching Practices for Success During COVID 19 Pandemic: Towards Phygital Learning,2021,"Background Despite high levels of vaccination in the adult population, cases of COVID-19 have risen exponentially in England since the start of May 2021 driven by the Delta variant. However, with far fewer hospitalisations and deaths per case during the recent growth in cases compared with 2020, it is intended that all remaining social distancing legislation in England will be removed from 19 July 2021. Methods We report interim results from round 13 of the REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission-1 (REACT-1) study in which a cross-sectional sample of the population of England was asked to provide a throat and nose swab for RT-PCR and to answer a questionnaire. Data collection for this report (round 13 interim) was from 24 June to 5 July 2021. Results In round 13 interim, we found 237 positives from 47,729 swabs giving a weighted prevalence of 0.59% (0.51%, 0.68%) which was approximately four-fold higher compared with round 12 at 0.15% (0.12%, 0.18%). This resulted from continued exponential growth in prevalence with an average doubling time of 15 (13, 17) days between round 12 and round 13. However, during the recent period of round 13 interim only, we observed a shorter doubling time of 6.1 (4.0, 12) days with a corresponding R number of 1.87 (1.40, 2.45). There were substantial increases in all age groups under the age of 75 years, and especially at younger ages, with the highest prevalence in 13 to 17 year olds at 1.33% (0.97%, 1.82%) and in 18 to 24 years olds at 1.40% (0.89%, 2.18%). Infections have increased in all regions with the largest increase in London where prevalence increased more than eight-fold from 0.13% (0.08%, 0.20%) in round 12 to 1.08% (0.79%, 1.47%) in round 13 interim. Overall, prevalence was over 3 times higher in the unvaccinated compared with those reporting two doses of vaccine in both round 12 and round 13 interim, although there was a similar proportional increase in prevalence in vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals between the two rounds. Discussion We are entering a critical period with a number of important competing processes: continued vaccination rollout to the whole adult population in England, increased natural immunity through infection, reduced social mixing of children during school holidays, increased proportion of mixing occurring outdoors during summer, the intended full opening of hospitality and entertainment and cessation of mandated social distancing and mask wearing. Surveillance programmes are essential during this next phase of the epidemic to provide clear evidence to the government and the public on the levels and trends in prevalence of infections and their relationship to vaccine coverage, hospitalisations, deaths and Long COVID.","Riley, S.; Eales, O.; Haw, D.; Wang, H.; Walters, C.

181200,Challenges encountered by in-service k12 teachers at the beginning of the covid-19 pandemic period: The case of turkey,2021,"Defense responses are a highly conserved behavioral response set across species. Defense responses motivate organisms to detect and react to threats and potential danger as a precursor to anxiety. Accurate measurement of temporal defense responses is important for understanding clinical anxiety and mood disorders, such as post-traumatic stress disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder. Within these conditions, anxiety is defined as a state of prolonged defense response elicitation to a threat that is ambiguous or unspecific. In this study, we aimed to develop a data-driven approach to capture temporal defense response elicitation through a multi-modality data analysis of physiological signals, including electroencephalogram (EEG), electrocardiogram (ECG), and eye-tracking information. A fear conditioning paradigm was adopted to develop a defense response classification model. From a classification model based on 42 feature sets, a higher order crossing feature set-based model was chosen for further analysis with cross-validation loss of 0.0462 (SEM: 0.0077). To validate our model, we compared predicted defense response occurrence ratios from a comprehensive situation that generates defense responses by watching movie clips with fear awareness and threat existence predictability, which have been reported to correlate with defense response elicitation in previous studies. We observed that defense response occurrence ratios are correlated with threat existence predictability, but not with fear awareness. These results are similar to those of previous studies using comprehensive situations. Our study provides insight into measurement of temporal defense responses via a novel approach, which can improve understanding of anxiety and related clinical disorders for neurobiological and clinical researchers.","Choi, Tae-jun; Lee, Honggu",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.17.423337,498
181498,The bioethical and bio-juridical debate regarding the use of biological samples and data for the purpose of genetic research on human health: Open problems,2021,"As of March 2021, three COVID-19 vaccines have been authorized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in the United States. Each has substantial efficacy in preventing COVID-19. However, as efficacy from trials was <100% for all three vaccines, disease in vaccinated people is expected to occur. We created a spreadsheet-based tool to estimate the number of symptomatic vaccine breakthrough infections based on published vaccine efficacy (VE) data, percent of the population that has been fully vaccinated, and average number of COVID-19 cases reported per day. We estimate that approximately 51,000 symptomatic vaccine breakthrough infections (95% CI: ~48,000-55,000 cases) occurred in the United States during January-April 2021 among >77 million fully vaccinated people, reflecting <0.5% of COVID-19 cases that occurred during that time. With ongoing SARS-CoV-2 transmission and increasing numbers of people vaccinated in the United States, vaccine breakthrough infections will continue to accumulate before population immunity is sufficient to interrupt transmission. Understanding expectations regarding number of vaccine breakthrough infections enables accurate public health messaging to help ensure that the occurrence of such cases does not negatively affect vaccine perceptions, confidence, and uptake.","Kugeler, K.

182189,Social distancing behavior during COVID-19: a TPB perspective,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic emerged in the month of December from the very popular city Wuhan of China and spread rapidly all over the country. The present situation depicts the progress in various less-explored areas to strengthen the global knowledge base for preventing and addressing the COVID-19 pandemic. Novel coronavirus disease became a major health concern due to its pathogenicity and world widespread distribution. Many good scientific research papers related to COVID-19 have recently published using the dataset CORD-19. Analysis of these massive data and identifying meaningful information is a crucial and very challenging task in health care and bio-medical science research. In this chapter, we try to extract important information about COVID-19 from the available text documents, such as research papers, articles, journals, reports, and other publications. Initially, in the chapter, these types of text data are preprocessed by means of sentence tokenization, then removal of stopwords, and finally stemming operations. Consequently, a bag-of-words is generated to represent each report in a structured form and a bi-objective strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm based text summarization technique is concerned to produce the summary of the report. The method has two objective functions: one based on the length of the summary, a predetermined value, and the other based on the clustering coefficient concept of graph theory. After convergence of the evolutionary algorithm, the fittest chromosome in the final population provides a summary of the report. The method is applied on COVID bio-medical reports publicly available in CORD-19 dataset for generating a summary and its performance is finally evaluated by comparing it with a few of the related state-of-the-art methods. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Mallick, C.; Das, S.; Das, A.

This study evaluated the suitability of such ‘home-made’ recordings for phonetic analysis of vowel space configurations, mergers, and nasalization by comparing simultaneous recordings from several popular personal devices (Macbook, PC laptop, iPad, iPhone and Android smartphone) to those taken from professional equipment (H4n field recorder, Focusrite with Audio Technica 2021 microphone). All personal devices conveyed vowel arrangements and nasalization patterns relatively faithfully (especially laptops), but absolute measurements varied, particularly for the female speaker and in the 750–1500 Hz range, which affected the locations (F1 × F2) of low and back vowels and reduced nasalization measurements (A1−P0) for the female's pre-nasal vowels. Based on these results, we assess the validity of remote recording using these consumer devices and offer recommendations for best practices for collecting high fidelity acoustic phonetic data from a distance. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Freeman, V.; De Decker, P.",Language and Linguistics Compass,https://doi.org/10.1111/lnc3.12435,498

Nef has been thought to have a negative effect on viral replication in vitro but has been shown in studies with SIV to be necessary in the establishment of viraemia in vivo. In vitro studies in various human cell lines have shown that Nef downregulates the expression of cell surface CD4 and thus could have effects on the immune response. We have generated four transgenic mouse lines, with constructs containing two different Nef alleles under the control of CD2 regulatory elements to examine the interaction of Nef with the host immune system in vivo. In adult transgenic mice we have found marked downregulation in the level of CD4 on the surface of double positive thymocytes and a decrease in the number of CD4+ T cells in the thymus. Functional analyses have revealed a decrease in the total activation of transgenic thymocytes by anti-CD3 epsilon antibody. By specific intracellular staining of T cells in such mice we have found CD4 colocalizing with a Golgi-specific marker. These results strongly suggest a Nef mediated effect on developing CD4 thymocytes resulting from interference of Nef in the intracellular trafficking or post-translational modification of CD4.","Brady, H J; Pennington, D J; Miles, C G; Dzierzak, E A",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC413753/,498

PURPOSE To critically evaluate the potential utility of existing surveillance systems for illnesses and syndromes related to bioterrorism. DATA SOURCES Databases of peer-reviewed articles (for example, MEDLINE for articles published from January 1985 to April 2002) and Web sites of relevant government and nongovernment agencies. STUDY SELECTION Reports that described or evaluated systems for collecting, analyzing, or presenting surveillance data for bioterrorism-related illnesses or syndromes. DATA EXTRACTION From each included article, the authors abstracted information about the type of surveillance data collected; method of collection, analysis, and presentation of surveillance data; and outcomes of evaluations of the system. DATA SYNTHESIS 17,510 article citations and 8088 government and nongovernmental Web sites were reviewed. From these, the authors included 115 systems that collect various surveillance reports, including 9 syndromic surveillance systems, 20 systems collecting bioterrorism detector data, 13 systems collecting influenza-related data, and 23 systems collecting laboratory and antimicrobial resistance data. Only the systems collecting syndromic surveillance data and detection system data were designed, at least in part, for bioterrorism preparedness applications. Syndromic surveillance systems have been deployed for both event-based and continuous bioterrorism surveillance. Few surveillance systems have been comprehensively evaluated. Only 3 systems have had both sensitivity and specificity evaluated. LIMITATIONS Data from some existing surveillance systems (particularly those developed by the military) may not be publicly available. CONCLUSIONS Few surveillance systems have been specifically designed for collecting and analyzing data for the early detection of a bioterrorist event. Because current evaluations of surveillance systems for detecting bioterrorism and emerging infections are insufficient to characterize the timeliness or sensitivity and specificity, clinical and public health decision making based on these systems may be compromised.","Bravata, Dena M; McDonald, Kathryn M; Smith, Wendy M; Rydzak, Chara; Szeto, Herbert; Buckeridge, David L; Haberland, Corinna; Owens, Douglas K",Annals of internal medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15172906/,498

Despite the close genetic relationship between these two viruses, EV71 is generally known to be a more perpetuating pathogen involved in severe clinical manifestations and deaths. While the serotyping of enteroviruses is mostly done by conventional immunological methods, many clinical isolates remain unclassifiable due to the limited number of antibodies against enterovirus surface proteins. Array-based assays are able to detect several serotypes with high accuracy. We combined an enterovirus microarray with multiplex reverse transcription-PCR to try to develop a method of sensitively and accurately detecting and differentiating EV71 and CA16. In an effort to design serotype-specific probes for detection of the virus, we first did an elaborate bioinformatic analysis of the sequence database derived from different enterovirus serotypes. We then constructed a microarray using 60-mer degenerate oligonucleotide probes covalently bound to array slides. Using this enterovirus microarray to study 144 clinical specimens from patients infected with HFMD or suspected to have HFMD, we found that it had a diagnostic accuracy of 92.0% for EV71 and 95.8% for CA16. Diagnostic accuracy for other enteroviruses (non-EV71 or -CA16) was 92.0%. All specimens were analyzed in parallel by real-time PCR and subsequently confirmed by neutralization tests. This highly sensitive array-based assay may become a useful alternative in clinical diagnostics of EV71 and CA16.","Chen, Tsan-Chi; Chen, Guang-Wu; Hsiung, Chao Agnes; Yang, Jyh-Yuan; Shih, Shin-Ru; Lai, Yiu-Kay; Juang, Jyh-Lyh",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16757623/,498

Using the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) envelope protein (SCVme), and core streptavidin (cSA) of Streptomyces avidinii as model proteins, specific immobilization of the GBP-fusion proteins onto the gold nanoparticles and generation of protein nanopatterns on the bare gold surface were demonstrated. The GBP-fused SCVme bound to gold nanoparticles successfully interacted with its antibody and showed changes in absorbance and color, allowing efficient diagnosis of SARS-CoV. The fusion proteins could be successfully immobilized on the gold surface by nanopatterning and microcontact printing as examined by atomic force microscopy and surface plasmon resonance analysis. The poly(dimethylsiloxane) microfluidic channels were created on the gold surface and were used for antigen-antibody and DNA-DNA interaction studies. Specific immobilization of GBP-EGFP fusion protein and its interaction with the antibody in the microchannels could be demonstrated. By immobilizing the DNA probe through the use of GBP-fused cSA, specific hybridization of the target DNA prepared from Salmonella could also be achieved.

This guide was based on current literature, drug labels, and drug interaction resources. We summarized the available data related to the potential implications of anti-COVID-19 co-medication in patients treated with ASMs. Our recommendations refer to drug selection, dosing, and patient monitoring. Given the limited availability of data, some recommendations are based on general pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic principles and might apply to additional future drug combinations as novel treatments emerge. They do not replace evidence-based guidelines, should those become available.

METHODS As part of a multipart study, we surveyed ""best informants"" who self-identified as the person most actively involved in EC or healthcare ethics in a random sample of 600 U.S. general hospitals, stratified for bed size. RESULTS The competency that was ranked most important for a lead or solo ethics consultant was knowledge of ethics, while common sense was ranked least important. The median estimated number of individuals at each hospital who would benefit from EC training was six at the basic level, three at the advanced level, and two for EC management training. In 19.1 percent of hospitals, respondents thought their hospital would not be willing to pay anything for EC training within the next two years. Respondents thought potential trainees would be likely to participate in EC training on multiple different topics. Opinions varied widely on preferred formats. Most respondents thought it very important to be able to interact with instructors and with other trainees, practice EC skills, receive a certificate for completing EC training, and complete EC training during work hours.

This approach depends on the identification of specific ""symptoms"" as signs of a possible outbreak, with no need for specific diagnoses. Moreover, syndromic surveillance is quick, easy, and inexpensive. Nosocomial infection surveillance is usually performed on inpatients only. However, during the outbreaks of SARS and seasonal influenza, for example, many hospital personnel were infected. In cases of this kind, in order to quickly detect the prevalence of such infections, a surveillance system that includes hospital personnel is essential. This surveillance is promising as a strategy to prepare for re-outbreaks of SARS and the emergence of novel influenza pandemics.","Kawana, Akihiko; Teruya, Katsuji; Kirikae, Teruo; Sekiguchi, Jun-ichiro; Kato, Yasuyuki; Kuroda, Emi; Horii, Kumi; Saito, Sin-ichiro; Ohara, Hiroshi; Kuratsuji, Tadatoshi; Kimura, Satoshi; Kudo, Koichiro",Japanese journal of infectious diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17186956/,498

The pandemic outbreak arises in a very particular period. Never before, our political disorganization and lack of collaboration has been highlighted as it was during the present health care crisis. Our health care system is shaking because of the lack of sufficient human and financial resources. However, technological changes, and especially remote health (teleconsultations and remote monitoring) are disrupting the whole ecosystem. We intend to illustrate that the COVID outbreak offers a unique opportunity to accelerate acceptance of these rapid technological changes, which are anyway unavoidable.

By monitoring the effect of this peptide library on membrane leakage in model membranes, we have identified three regions on the SARS CoV spike glycoprotein with membrane-interacting capabilities: region 1, located immediately upstream of heptad repeat 1 (HR1) and suggested to be the fusion peptide; region 2, located between HR1 and HR2, which would be analogous to the loop domain of human immunodeficiency virus type 1; and region 3, which would correspond to the pretransmembrane region. The identification of these membrane-active regions, which are capable of modifying the biophysical properties of phospholipid membranes, supports their direct role in SARS CoV-mediated membrane fusion, as well as facilitating the future development of SARS CoV entry inhibitors.","Guillén, Jaime; Pérez-Berná, Ana J; Moreno, Miguel R; Villalaín, José",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15650199/,498
200970,Educating in a Pandemic: Rapid Changes to Molecular Genetic Pathology Graduate Medical Education Training during COVID-19,2020,"Rhinoviruses (RVs) are the most common upper respiratory pathogens, inducing the majority of common colds worldwide. RV-related morbidity, although significant cumulatively, has been considered trivial for the individual patient. However, recent strong epidemiological associations of RVs with asthma exacerbations, including severe episodes requiring hospitalization, indicate that RV infections can result in serious disease. Current evidence supports the possibility that RVs infect the lower airways, inducing a local inflammatory response. Such evidence suggests that the role of RVs in other lower respiratory diseases, such as pneumonia, bronchitis, bronchiolitis and cystic fibrosis, should be re-examined with polymerase chain reaction-based methodologies, which are considerably more sensitive than traditional, cell culture-based techniques. The mechanisms through which RVs induce lower airway disease are studied to understand the relative contributions of the epithelial, neurogenic and immune components in the antiviral response, and to permit the design and implementation of specific treatments.","Papadopoulos, N G; Johnston, S L",Canadian respiratory journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11058209/,498
201015,"Direct Provision, Rights and Everyday Life for Asylum Seekers in Ireland during COVID-19",2021,"INTRODUCTION Permanent/nonresorbable hernia repair materials rely on profibrotic wound healing, and repair sites are commonly composed of disorganized tissue with inferior mechanical strength and risk of reherniation. Resorbable electrospun scaffolds represent a novel class of biomaterials, which may provide a unique platform for the design of advanced soft tissue repair materials. These materials are simple, inexpensive, nonwoven materials composed of polymer fibers that readily mimic the natural extracellular matrix. The primary goal of the present study was to evaluate the physiomechanical properties of novel electrospun scaffolds to determine their suitability for hernia repair. Based on previous experimentation, scaffolds possessing ≥ 20 N suture retention strength, ≥ 20 N tear resistance, and ≥ 50 N/cm tensile strength are appropriate for hernia repair. METHODS Six novel electrospun scaffolds were fabricated by varying combinations of polymer concentration (10-12 %) and flow rate (3.5-10 mL/h). Briefly, poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) was dissolved in a solvent mixture and electrospun onto a planar metal collector, yielding sheets with randomly oriented fibers. Physiomechanical properties were evaluated through scanning electron microscopy, laser micrometry, and mechanical testing. RESULTS Scanning electron micrographs demonstrated fiber diameters ranging from 1.0 ± 0.1 μm (10 % PCL, 3.5 mL/h) to 1.5 ± 0.2 μm (12 % PCL, 4 mL/h). Laser micrometry demonstrated thicknesses ranging from 0.72 ± 0.07 mm (12 % PCL, 10 mL/h) to 0.91 ± 0.05 mm (10 % PCL, 3.5 mL/h). Mechanical testing identified two scaffolds possessing suture retention strengths ≥ 20 N (12 % PCL, 10 mL/h and 12 % PCL, 6 mL/h), and no scaffolds possessing tear resistance values ≥ 20 N (range, 4.7 ± 0.9 N to 10.6 ± 1.8 N). Tensile strengths ranged from 35.27 ± 2.08 N/cm (10 % PCL, 3.5 mL/h) to 81.76 ± 15.85 N/cm (12 % PCL, 4 mL/h), with three scaffolds possessing strengths ≥ 50 N/cm (12 % PCL, 10 mL/h; 12 % PCL, 6 mL/h; 12 % PCL, 4 mL/h). CONCLUSIONS Two electrospun scaffolds (12 % PCL, 10 mL/h and 12 % PCL, 6 mL/h) possessed suture retention and tensile strengths appropriate for hernia repair, justifying evaluation in a large animal model. Additional studies examining advanced methods of fabrication may further improve the unique properties of these scaffolds, propelling them into applications in a variety of clinical settings.","Ebersole, Gregory C; Buettmann, Evan G; MacEwan, Matthew R; Tang, Michael E; Frisella, Margaret M; Matthews, Brent D; Deeken, Corey R",Surgical endoscopy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22538673/,498
201779,Extraordinary times: COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) encodes proteins required for RNA transcription and genome replication as large polyproteins that are proteolytically processed by virus-encoded proteinases to produce mature replicase proteins. In this report, we generated antibodies against SARS-CoV predicted replicase protein and used the antibodies to identify and characterize 12 of the 16 predicted mature replicase proteins (nsp1, nsp2, nsp3, nsp4, nsp5, nsp8, nsp9, nsp12, nsp13, nsp14, nsp15, and nsp16) in SARS-CoV-infected Vero cells. Immunoblot analysis of infected-cell lysates identified proteins of the predicted sizes. Immunofluorescence microscopy detected similar patterns of punctate perinuclear and distributed cytoplasmic foci with all replicase antibodies and as early as 6 h postinfection. Dual-labeling studies demonstrated colocalization of replicase protein nsp8 with nsp2 and nsp3 in cytoplasmic complexes and also with LC3, a protein marker for autophagic vacuoles. Antibodies directed against mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) virions and against the putative RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Pol) detected SARS-CoV nucleocapsid and nsp12 (Pol), respectively, in SARS-CoV-infected Vero cells. These results confirm the predicted protein processing pattern for mature SARS-CoV replicase proteins, demonstrate localization of replicase proteins to cytoplasmic complexes containing markers for autophagosome membranes, and suggest conservation of protein epitopes in the replicase and nucleocapsid of SARS-CoV and the group II coronavirus, MHV. Further, the results demonstrate the ability of replicase antibodies to detect SARS-CoV-infected cells as early as 6 h postinfection and thus represent important tools for studies of SARS-CoV replication, inhibition, and diagnosis.","Prentice, Erik; McAuliffe, Josephine; Lu, Xiaotao; Subbarao, Kanta; Denison, Mark R",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15331731/,498
202499,Consumer Ethicality Perception and Legitimacy: Competitive Advantages in COVID-19 Crisis,2021,"The endocytic pathway is a common strategy that several highly pathogenic viruses use to enter into the cell. To demonstrate the usefulness of this pathway as a common target for the development of broad-spectrum antivirals, the inhibitory effect of drug compounds targeting endosomal membrane proteins were investigated. This study entailed direct comparison of drug effectiveness against animal and human pathogenic viruses, namely Ebola (EBOV), African swine fever virus (ASFV), and the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). A panel of experimental and FDA-approved compounds targeting calcium channels and PIKfyve at the endosomal membrane caused potent reductions of entry up to 90% in SARS-CoV-2 S-protein pseudotyped retrovirus. Similar inhibition was observed against transduced EBOV glycoprotein pseudovirus and ASFV. SARS-CoV-2 infection was potently inhibited by selective estrogen receptor modulators in cells transduced with pseudovirus, among them Raloxifen inhibited ASFV with very low 50% inhibitory concentration. Finally, the mechanism of the inhibition caused by the latter in ASFV infection was analyzed. Overall, this work shows that cellular proteins related to the endocytic pathway can constitute suitable cellular targets for broad range antiviral compounds.","Galindo, I; Garaigorta, U; Lasala, F; Cuesta-Geijo, M A; Bueno, P; Gil, C; Delgado, R; Gastaminza, P; Alonso, C",Antiviral Res,,498

A web-based cross-sectional study was conducted among Nepalese adults from March 29 to April 07, 2020. A 13- and 15- items structured questionnaire assessed the COVID-19 related knowledge and perception of the universal safety measure. Kruskal-Wallis test and Mann-Whitney U test evaluated the differences in knowledge between the groups. Data analysis was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows Version 21.0 (IBM Corp. Armonk, NY, USA). Of the 884 surveys accessed, a total of 871 consented (electronically) and completed the online survey (response rate 98.52%). The median knowledge score of the participants was 10.0 (± 3.0 IQR). Although participants' overall knowledge score was high, only about half of the participants knew about the concept of quarantine and the ideal distance to be maintained between individuals to prevent the transmission. Though the majority of the participants had positive perception towards universal safety measure of COVID-19, about 18% perceived that coronavirus infected only older people, 11% opined that the infection was highly fatal with no chances of survival and 70% considered that limiting consumptions of poultry and meat would prevent the spread of COVID-19. A statistically significant difference in knowledge was noted by participants' age, educational status, occupational type, and household monthly income. This study found optimal knowledge and perception of universal safety measures of COVID-19 among the Nepalese population, but misinformation and misunderstanding prevailed.","Singh, Devendra Raj; Sunuwar, Dev Ram; Karki, Kshitij; Ghimire, Saruna; Shrestha, Naveen",J Community Health,,498

However, the low-dimensional structure in nonlayered chromium selenide, which plays a crucial role in determining the low-dimensional magnetic order, needs further study. Here, we report the structure-dependent magnetic properties in monolayer CrSe2 and Cr2Se3 grown by molecular beam epitaxy. In the monolayer CrSe2, 1T-CrSe2 with a lattice constant of 3.3 Å has a metallic character, coexisting with the 1Tâ³ phase with 2 × 2 surface periodicity. Monolayer CrSe2 can be transformed into Cr2Se3 with a lattice constant of 3.6 Å by annealing at 300 °C. X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) measurements combined with DFT calculations reveal that while the MBE-grown monolayer CrSe2 is antiferromagnetic, monolayer Cr2Se3 is ferromagnetic with a Curie temperature of â¼200 K. This work demonstrates the structural diversity in nonlayered chromium selenide and the critical effect of different structures on its electronic and magnetic properties.","Liu, Meizhuang; Huang, Yu Li; Gou, Jian; Liang, Qijie; Chua, Rebekah; Duan, Sisheng; Zhang, Lei; Cai, LiangLiang; Yu, Xiaojiang; Zhong, Dingyong; Zhang, Wenjing; Wee, Andrew T S",J Phys Chem Lett,,498
203437,Social Media Spread During Covid-19: The Pros and Cons of Likes and Shares,2020,"BACKGROUND: Quality improvement (QI) involves the use of systematic tools and methods to improve the quality of care and outcomes for patients. However, awareness and application of QI among healthcare professionals is poor and new strategies are needed to engage them in this area. OBJECTIVES: This study describes an innovative collaboration between one Higher Educational Institute (HEI) and Local Pharmaceutical Committees (LPCs) to develop a postgraduate QI module aimed to upskill community pharmacists in QI methods. The study explores pharmacist engagement with the learning and investigates the impact on their practice. METHODS: Details of the HEI-LPCs collaboration and communication with pharmacist were recorded. Focus groups were held with community pharmacists who enrolled onto the module to explore their motivation for undertaking the learning, how their knowledge of QI had changed and how they applied this learning in practice. A constructivist qualitative methodology was used to analyse the data. RESULTS: The study found that a HEI-LPC partnership was feasible in developing and delivering the QI module. Fifteen pharmacists enrolled and following its completion, eight took part in one of two focus groups. Pharmacists reported a desire to extend and acquire new skills. The HEI-LPC partnership signalled a vote of confidence that gave pharmacists reassurance to sign up for the training. Some found returning to academia challenging and reported a lack of time and organisational support. Despite this, pharmacists demonstrated an enhanced understanding of QI, were more analytical in their day-to-day problem-solving and viewed the learning as having a positive impact on their team's organisational culture with potential to improve service quality for patients. CONCLUSIONS: With the increased adoption of new pharmacist's roles and recent changes to governance associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, a HEI-LPC collaborative approach could upskill pharmacists and help them acquire skills to accommodate new working practices.","Latif, Asam; Gulzar, Nargis; Lowe, Fiona; Ansong, Theo; Gohil, Sejal",,,498

206468,Alernatives for saving lives in slums during the pandemic: the contribution of dynamic systems,2020,"China's automobile industry is developing rapidly, but the recycling rate of end-of-life vehicles has been low. In 2018, the recovery rate of end-of-life passenger vehicles was less than 18% of the scrapped amount. Dynamic material flow analysis can predict the amount of end-of-life passenger cars in China in the future, and analyze the flow of materials in recycling system. Life cycle assessment can be used to quantify greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, this paper integrates these two methods into the model construction of recycling decision system. Meanwhile, sensitivity analysis of the important factors affecting the efficiency of the recovery system is carried out. Finally, the main recovery indexes of the system are predicted under three scenarios: low-speed, medium speed and high-speed development, which are set based on scrap volume, standard recovery rate, proportion of assembly into remanufacturing and carbon tax price. The research results show that in 2018, 656.9 kg/vehicle of iron, 150.2 kg/vehicle of aluminum and 7.9 kg/vehicle of copper are recovered from end-of-life passenger car in China, and the carbon emission during the recovery process is 651.1 kg of CO2eq/vehicle, with a total emission reduction of 3816.1 kgCO2eq/vehicle compared with the original production, and the economic benefit is about 5055.5 yuan/vehicle. The scenario prediction results show that by 2050, from the low-speed development scenario to the high-speed development scenario, the total amount of iron, aluminum and copper recovered rise from 3.96 million tons, 915 thousand tons and 46 thousand tons to 697 thousand tons, 1.61 million tons and 80 thousand tons respectively throughout the year. The carbon emission in the recovery process rise from 4.98 thousand tons to 9.32 million tons. Compared with the original production, the carbon emission reduction increases from 2.21 million tons to 38.3 million tons, the economic benefit increases from 58.9 billion yuan to 118.8 billion yuan, and the comprehensive benefit increases from 57 billion yuan to 111.6 billion yuan.","Liu, Manzhi; Chen, Xuhui; Zhang, Mengya; Lv, Xueqing; Wang, Haihao; Chen, Zhizhi; Huang, Xiaorong; Zhang, Xixi; Zhang, Shiru",Waste Manag,,498

This study aimed to compare the association of ARBs and ACEIs with COVID-19-related mortality. METHODS: All patients with COVID-19 in Korea between January 19 and April 16, 2020 were enrolled. The association of ARBs and ACEIs with mortality within 60 days were evaluated. A comparison of hazard ratio (HR) was performed between COVID-19 patients and a retrospective cohort of pneumonia patients hospitalized in 2019 in Korea. RESULTS: Among 10,448 COVID-19 patients, ARBs and ACEIs were prescribed in 1,231 (11.7%) and 57 (0.6%) patients, respectively. After adjusting for age, sex, and history of comorbidities, the ARB group showed neutral association (HR, 1.034; 95% CI, 0.765 to 1.399; p = 0.8270) and the ACEI groups showed no significant associations likely owing to the small population size (HR, 0.736; 95% CI, 0.314 to 1.726; p = 0.4810). When comparing HR between COVID-19 patients and a retrospective cohort of patients hospitalized with pneumonia in 2019, the trend of ACEIs showed similar benefits, whereas the protective effect of ARBs observed in the retrospective cohort was absent in COVID-19 patients. Meta-analyses showed significant positive correlation with survival of ACEIs, whereas a neutral association between ARBs and mortality.

208763,Barts X as a Model for Teaching Digital Health,2021,"In the current context of the COVID-19 Pandemic and Globalization, the emphasis of Romanian migration in Western countries (particularly in this article in UK, Germany, and Austria) has become a phenomenon with multiple challenges and dilemmas on different levels and dimensions. Thus, the special attention from the state authorities on these issues is not just a short-term task, requiring a complex collaboration between the political government, the medical system, and specialized researchers. Both state institutions can establish medium and long-term interests regarding the effort to strengthen the Romanian state’s relations with citizens abroad, negotiate inter-community solutions, guide public policies to support the insertion on the labour market, etc., a complex set of analysis and solutions with a multidisciplinary scientific contribution. In the conditions of intensifying the flows of Romanian immigrants, the risks of losing an important national productive and creative segment also increase. Local human resources management is a strict subject of internal management and abroad human resources management, this being a subject of Community legislation, diplomatic communication and policies of inclusion, integration, and insertion in the labour market. The long-term goal is to strengthen the sense of ethnic, cultural, linguistic, and religious identity and security of Romanians abroad, consolidating the Romanian cultural heritage. © 2021.

METHODS: We apply a novel health services research approach to systematically assess a sample of 55 institutional websites. The accessibility, content, and coverage of occupational health/safety program information were systematically coded for several domains (e.g., OSHA-related, specific hazards, clinical, person-oriented, COVID-19, and coverage). RESULTS: Information was more available for programs related to OSHA mandates (e.g., chemical hygiene) and specific hazards than for person-oriented programs (e.g., counseling). Larger institutions provide better information and more comprehensive programs than smaller institutions. CONCLUSIONS: Higher education institutions warrant increasing attention to occupational health and safety, particularly as COVID-19 increased attention to workplace health issues.","Malomet, Maayan S; Harber, Philip",J. occup. environ. med,,498

This virus spreads readily from person to person and predominantly to and from the respiratory route and through droplets. There are many different interventions that can be and are used to decrease successfully the risk and spread of COVID-19. Most of the principles underpinning these interventions relate to isolation and social distancing. These will need to be continued, at least in part, until safe and very effective vaccines become widely available and are delivered extensively and successfully globally. This new norm is isolation, plus social and physical distancing, and this new norm will likely be with us for some time to come. It will also be with us in any future pandemics, whether caused by bacteria or viruses, but especially when the causative pathogen spreads predominantly through the respiratory route. However, lockdowns and restrictions also cause many adverse but unintended economic, social and health consequences. Therefore, what is put into place needs to be proportionate to levels of risk of disease as well as spread, and which will vary in different localities and with time.","Collignon, Peter",Intern Med J,,498

214247,An explorative analysis of Azerbaijan’s Covid-19 policy response and public opinion,2021,"Due to the important pathological roles of the HIV-1 gp120, the protein has been intensively used in the research of HIV. However, recombinant gp120 preparation has proven to be difficult because of extremely low expression levels. In order to facilitate gp120 expression, previous methods predominantly involved the replacement of native signal peptide with a heterologous one, resulting in very limited improvement. Currently, preparation of recombinant gp120 with native glycans relies solely on transient expression systems, which are not amendable for large scale production. In this work, we employed a different approach for gp120 expression. Besides replacing the native gp120 signal peptide with that of rat serum albumin and optimizing its codon usage, we generated a stable gp120-expressing cell line in a glutamine synthetase knockout HEK293T cell line that we established for the purpose of amplification of recombinant gene expressions. The combined usage of these techniques dramatically increased gp120 expression levels and yielded a functional product with human cell derived glycan. This method may be applicable to large scale preparation of other viral envelope proteins, such as that of the emerging SARS-CoV-2, or other glycoproteins which require the presence of authentic human glycans.","Zou, Zhongcheng; Wang, Ruipeng; Go, Eden P; Desaire, Heather; Sun, Peter D",Protein Expr Purif,,498

AIM: To explore the association between D-dimer at admission and in-hospital mortality in patients hospitalised for COVID-19, with or without symptomatic venous thromboembolism. METHODS: From 26 February to 20 April 2020, D-dimer concentration at admission and outcomes (in-hospital mortality and venous thromboembolism) of patients hospitalised for COVID-19 in medical wards were retrospectively analysed in a multicenter study in 24 French hospitals. RESULTS: Among 2878 patients enrolled in the study, 1154 (40.1%) patients had D-dimer measurement at admission. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis identified a D-dimer concentration>1128ng/mL as the best cut-off value for in-hospital mortality (area under the curve 64.9%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 60-69), with a sensitivity of 71.1% (95% CI 62-78) and a specificity of 55.6% (95% CI 52-58), which did not differ in the subgroup of patients with venous thromboembolism during hospitalisation. Among 545 (47.2%) patients with D-dimer concentration>1128ng/mL at admission, 86 (15.8%) deaths occurred during hospitalisation.

216456,Responding to the COVID-19 pandemic: University rankings or co-operatives as a strategy for developing an equitable and resilient post-secondary education sector?,2021,"Once considered a hallmark of human uniqueness, brain asymmetry has emerged as a feature shared with several other species, including chimpanzees, one of our closest living relatives. Most notable has been the discovery of asymmetries in homologues of cortical language areas in apes, particularly in the planum temporale (PT), considered a central node of the human language network. Several lines of evidence indicate a role for genetic mechanisms in the emergence of PT asymmetry; however, the genetic determinants of cerebral asymmetries have remained elusive. Studies in humans suggest that there is heritability of brain asymmetries of the PT, but this has not been explored to any extent in chimpanzees. Furthermore, the potential influence of non-genetic factors has raised questions about the reproducibility of earlier observations of PT asymmetry reported in chimpanzees. As such, the present study was aimed at examining both the heritability of phenotypic asymmetries in PT morphology, as well as their reproducibility. Using magnetic resonance imaging, we evaluated morphological asymmetries of PT surface area (mm2) and mean depth (mm) in captive chimpanzees (n = 291) derived from two genetically isolated populations. Our results confirm that chimpanzees exhibit a significant population-level leftward asymmetry for PT surface area, as well as significant heritability in the surface area and mean depth of the PT. These results conclusively demonstrate the existence of a leftward bias in PT asymmetry in chimpanzees and suggest that genetic mechanisms play a key role in the emergence of anatomical asymmetry in this region.","Spocter, Muhammad A; Sherwood, Chet C; Schapiro, Steven J; Hopkins, William D",Proc Biol Sci,,498

Antivirals that have shown in vitro activity against SARS-CoV2 or the closely related SARS-CoV1 and MERS-CoV, are compared on the enzymatic level and by potency in cells. For treatment of the CSS we discuss medications that reduce the effects, or expression of cytokines involved in the CSS with an emphasis on those that reduce IL-6 because of its central role in the development of the CSS. We show that some of the medications covered influence the activity or expression of enzymes involved in epigenetic processes and specifically those that add or remove modifications to histones or DNA. Where available, the latest clinical data showing the efficacy of the medications is presented. With respect to their mechanisms, we explain why some medications are successful, why others have failed, and why some untested medications may yet prove useful.","Luo, Wenxia; Ige, Olufola O; Beacon, Tasnim H; Su, Ruey-Chyi; Huang, Shujun; Davie, James R; Lakowski, Ted M",Genome,,498

This was a prospective study performed from March 01, 2020 to June 30, 2020. It analyzed the precautions adapted for VLS initially and subsequently describes modifications with the time. The safety protocols are developed considering the safety aspect, the feasibility aspect (due to increase in number of the VLS), and the financial aspect. The VLS was performed with the personal protective equipment (PPE), including the face shield mask and head cover. The PPE was re-used after sterilization with ethylene oxide. For local anesthesia, the oropharynx was sprayed with 15% xylocaine and nose packed with 4% xylocaine soaked pledget. Following the VLS, the scope was wiped three times with 80% alcohol and then immersed in 5.25% sodium hypochlorite and 0.55% ortho-phthalaldehyde for 10 min each. Each VLS was spaced by at least 15 min gap. The endoscopy suite maintained with laminar air flow. It can be concluded that during the COVID-19 pandemic, the VLS must be performed using PPE with proper sterilization of the scope and the endoscopy suite after the procedure.

Continuous infusion of levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel (LCIG) is a well-proven option in clinical practice. We now report the first clinical experience of levodopa-entacapone-carbidopa intestinal gel (LECIG) therapy. An observational study of the first patients to start LECIG in our clinic was performed. Twenty-four patients (11 females, 13 males) were included. The median age was 71.5 years, and the median duration since PD diagnosis was 15.5 years. The median treatment duration was 305 days. Median doses were: 6.0 mL as morning dose, 2.5 mL/h as infusion rate, and 1.0 mL as extra dose. Half of the patients were switched directly from LCIG. These patients express improvements in the size and weight of the pump. Furthermore, most of them considered the new pump to be improved regarding user-friendliness. Six patients discontinued LECIG, three due to diarrhea, one due to hallucinations and two deceased (one cardiac arrest and one COVID-19). LECIG has shown to be possible to use in patients with PD, efficacy and safety as expected. Patients are generally happy with the size and usability of the pump, but some technical improvements of the software are warranted, as well as larger, prospective studies.","Öthman, Mezin; Widman, Erik; Nygren, Ingela; Nyholm, Dag",,,498

220050,Preocupaciones y demandas frente a COVID-19: Encuesta al personal de salud,2020,"In December 2019 the World Health Organization (WHO) recorded the first cases of an infectious disease that appeared in China in November of the same year. Generated by the new coronavirus SARS-CoV2, it is quickly named COVID-19 for COronaVirus Infectious Disease 2019. The spread of this unknown disease will soon have worldwide consequences: the contagiousness of the virus is extremely high and potentially lethal. In France, the population initially reacted with disbelief until the disease reached Europe and the first cases appeared on French territory, at the end of January. A few weeks later, on 16 March 2020, President Macron declared the country ""at war"" against COVID-19. The next day the population was placed in lockdown. At the present time, the country's activity is at a standstill. Schools, businesses and shops are closed. The French citizens are astounded. They suddenly have to face fear: fear of falling ill or that a close relative may fall ill, fear of being locked up and experiencing restrictions of liberties, fear of economic precariousness. And, above all, fear of uncertainty. In order to prevent the mental consequences of this crisis, psychological support units have been created with urgency at national scale. These units are intended to support the healthcare professionals as well as the patients and more broadly, the general population. The unit responsible for the department of Gironde has been set up quickly, over the weekend of March 21, 2020. The COVIDPSY33 listening unit has thus been created in Bordeaux by the Charles Perrens Hospital with support from the Agence Régionale de Santé Nouvelle-Aquitaine (ARS). Simultaneously, the PSYCOVID-19 unit was created. This additional unit works in collaboration with the COVIDPSY33 platform and offers psychological assistance to the general population and caregivers in the sectors of Bordeaux Rive Droite, Bordeaux Gare, Rives de Garonne, Rives d'Arcins and Sud Gironde. It thus covers an area equivalent to approximately half of Gironde, the largest department in metropolitan France.

221127,Assessing the Change in Infertility Patient's Social Media Use during Covid-19 Related Clinic Closures,2020,"Preclinical mouse models that recapitulate some characteristics of COVID-19 will facilitate focused study of pathogenesis and virus-host responses. Human angiotensin converting enzyme (hACE2) serves as an entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2 to infect people via binding to spike proteins. Herein we report development and characterization of a rapidly deployable COVID-19 mouse model. C57BL/6J (B6) mice expressing hACE2 in the lung were transduced by oropharyngeal delivery of the recombinant human adenovirus type 5 that expresses hACE2 (Ad5-hACE2). Mice were infected with SARS-CoV-2 at day 4 post-transduction and developed interstitial pneumonia associated with perivascular inflammation, accompanied by significantly higher viral load in lungs at days 3, 6, and 12 post-infection compared to Ad5-empty control group. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in pneumocytes in alveolar septa. Transcriptomic analysis of lungs demonstrated that the infected Ad5-hACE mice had a significant increase in interferon-dependent chemokines Cxcl9 and Cxcl10, and genes associated with effector T cell populations including Cd3g, Cd8a, and Gzmb. Pathway analysis showed that several KEGG pathways were enriched in the dataset, including cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, the chemokine signaling pathway, the NOD-like receptor signaling pathway, the measles pathway, and the IL-17 signaling pathway. This response is correlative to clinical response in lungs of COVID-19 patients. These results demonstrate that expression of hACE2 via adenovirus delivery system sensitized the mouse to SARS-CoV-2 infection and resulted in the development of a mild COVID-19 phenotype, highlighting the immune and inflammatory host responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection. This rapidly deployable COVID-19 mouse model is useful for preclinical and pathogenesis studies of COVID-19.

223933,Relationship between COVID-19 and Hypertension,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Data from the USA reveal disparities in hospitalization and mortality from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Social determinants of health (SDoH) could account for disparities in disease incidence and outcomes. We investigated the association between zip code racial composition and COVID-19 incidence and case fatality in Oakland County, MI. METHODS: We conducted an ecological study using publicly available data on COVID-19 in 70 zip codes in Oakland County, MI. We obtained demographic surrogate markers of SDoH by zip code from the US Census Bureau website. Using negative binomial regression models, we investigated the association between the percentage of Blacks in each zip code and COVID-19 incidence and case fatality, including markers of SDoH as potential confounders. RESULTS: Reported COVID-19 cases ranged from 13.2 to 255.2 per 10,000 population. Each percentage increase in Blacks within a zip code was associated with a 3% increase in COVID-19 cases (95% CI: 1.02 to 1.04, p &#8804; 0.0001), and this remained significant after adjusting for income or poverty level, number of persons per household, mode of transportation, age, and level of education (incidence rate ratio: 1.02, 95% CI: 1.01 to 1.03, p &#8804; 0.0001). Zip codes with a higher percentage of Blacks also experienced a faster increase in COVID-19 rates from April 3 to May 16. However, the proportion of Blacks in a zip code was not associated with case fatality. CONCLUSION: Zip codes with larger Black populations were disproportionately affected by COVID-19.","Akanbi, Maxwell O; Rivera, Adovich S; Akanbi, Folake O; Shoyinka, Adenike",J. racial ethnic health disparities (Internet),,498
223980,Fake news during the COVID-19 State of Alarm. Analysis from the political point of view in the Spanish press,2020,"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2) was spreading rapidly in South Korea at the end of February 2020 following its initial outbreak in China, making Korea the new center of global attention. The role of social media amid the current coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has often been criticized, but little systematic research has been conducted on this issue. Social media functions as a convenient source of information in pandemic situations. OBJECTIVE: Few infodemiology studies have applied network analysis in conjunction with content analysis. This study investigates information transmission networks and news-sharing behaviors regarding COVID-19 on Twitter in Korea. The real time aggregation of social media data can serve as a starting point for designing strategic messages for health campaigns and establishing an effective communication system during this outbreak. METHODS: Korean COVID-19-related Twitter data were collected on February 29, 2020. Our final sample comprised of 43,832 users and 78,233 relationships on Twitter. We generated four networks in terms of key issues regarding COVID-19 in Korea. This study comparatively investigates how COVID-19-related issues have circulated on Twitter through network analysis. Next, we classified top news channels shared via tweets. Lastly, we conducted a content analysis of news frames used in the top-shared sources. RESULTS: The network analysis suggests that the spread of information was faster in the Coronavirus network than in the other networks (Corona19, Shincheon, and Daegu). People who used the word ""Coronavirus"" communicated more frequently with each other. The spread of information was faster, and the diameter value was lower than for those who used other terms. Many of the news items highlighted the positive roles being played by individuals and groups, directing readers' attention to the crisis. Ethical issues such as deviant behavior among the population and an entertainment frame highlighting celebrity donations also emerged often. There was a significant difference in the use of nonportal (n=14) and portal news (n=26) sites between the four network types. The news frames used in the top sources were similar across the networks (P=.89, 95% CI 0.004-0.006). Tweets containing medically framed news articles (mean 7.571, SD 1.988) were found to be more popular than tweets that included news articles adopting nonmedical frames (mean 5.060, SD 2.904; N=40, P=.03, 95% CI 0.169-4.852). CONCLUSIONS: Most of the popular news on Twitter had nonmedical frames. Nevertheless, the spillover effect of the news articles that delivered medical information about COVID-19 was greater than that of news with nonmedical frames. Social media network analytics cannot replace the work of public health officials; however, monitoring public conversations and media news that propagates rapidly can assist public health professionals in their complex and fast-paced decision-making processes.","Park, Han Woo; Park, Sejung; Chong, Miyoung",J Med Internet Res,,498
224444,Analysis and Evaluation of International Information about Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)/ 新型冠状病毒肺炎诊疗国际信息资源的分析与评价,2020,"Background: In March 2020, many elective medical services were canceled in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The daily case rate is now declining in many states and there is a need for guidance about the resumption of elective clinical services for patients with lung disease or sleep conditions.Methods: Volunteers were solicited from the Association of Pulmonary, Critical Care, and Sleep Division Directors and American Thoracic Society. Working groups developed plans by discussion and consensus for resuming elective services in pulmonary and sleep-medicine clinics, pulmonary function testing laboratories, bronchoscopy and procedure suites, polysomnography laboratories, and pulmonary rehabilitation facilities.Results: The community new case rate should be consistently low or have a downward trajectory for at least 14 days before resuming elective clinical services. In addition, institutions should have an operational strategy that consists of patient prioritization, screening, diagnostic testing, physical distancing, infection control, and follow-up surveillance. The goals are to protect patients and staff from exposure to the virus, account for limitations in staff, equipment, and space that are essential for the care of patients with COVID-19, and provide access to care for patients with acute and chronic conditions.Conclusions: Transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a dynamic process and, therefore, it is likely that the prevalence of COVID-19 in the community will wax and wane. This will impact an institution's mitigation needs. Operating procedures should be frequently reassessed and modified as needed.

Factors associated with burnout and low organizational commitment in Canadian teachers during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"Development of effective preventative interventions against SARS-CoV-2, the etiologic agent of COVID-19 is urgently needed. The viral surface spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 is a key target for prophylactic measures as it is critical for the viral replication cycle and the primary target of neutralizing antibodies. We evaluated design elements previously shown for other coronavirus S protein-based vaccines to be successful, e.g., prefusion-stabilizing substitutions and heterologous signal peptides, for selection of a S-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate. In vitro characterization demonstrated that the introduction of stabilizing substitutions (i.e., furin cleavage site mutations and two consecutive prolines in the hinge region of S2) increased the ratio of neutralizing versus non-neutralizing antibody binding, suggestive for a prefusion conformation of the S protein. Furthermore, the wild-type signal peptide was best suited for the correct cleavage needed for a natively folded protein. These observations translated into superior immunogenicity in mice where the Ad26 vector encoding for a membrane-bound stabilized S protein with a wild-type signal peptide elicited potent neutralizing humoral immunity and cellular immunity that was polarized towards Th1 IFN-Î³. This optimized Ad26 vector-based vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, termed Ad26.COV2.S, is currently being evaluated in a phase I clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04436276).","Bos, Rinke; Rutten, Lucy; van der Lubbe, Joan E M; Bakkers, Mark J G; Hardenberg, Gijs; Wegmann, Frank; Zuijdgeest, David; de Wilde, Adriaan H; Koornneef, Annemart; Verwilligen, Annemiek; van Manen, Danielle; Kwaks, Ted; Vogels, Ronald; Dalebout, Tim J; Myeni, Sebenzile K; Kikkert, Marjolein; Snijder, Eric J; Li, Zhenfeng; Barouch, Dan H; Vellinga, Jort; Langedijk, Johannes P M; Zahn, Roland C; Custers, Jerome; Schuitemaker, Hanneke",NPJ Vaccines,,498

226937,"Face to Face with Coronavirus Disease 19: Maintaining Motivation, Psychological Safety, and Wellness",2020,"Bats are often claimed to be a major source for future viral epidemics, as they are associated with several viruses with zoonotic potential. Here we describe the presence and biodiversity of bats associated with intensive pig farms devoted to the production of heavy pigs in northern Italy. Since chiropters or signs of their presence were not found within animal shelters in our study area, we suggest that fecal viruses with high environmental resistance have the highest likelihood for spillover through indirect transmission. In turn, we investigated the circulation of mammalian orthoreoviruses (MRVs), coronaviruses (CoVs) and astroviruses (AstVs) in pigs and bats sharing the same environment. Results of our preliminary study did not show any bat virus in pigs suggesting that spillover from these animals is rare. However, several AstVs, CoVs and MRVs circulated undetected in pigs. Among those, one MRV was a reassortant strain carrying viral genes likely acquired from bats. On the other hand, we found a swine AstV and a MRV strain carrying swine genes in bat guano, indicating that viral exchange at the bat-pig interface might occur more frequently from pigs to bats rather than the other way around. Considering the indoor farming system as the most common system in the European Union (EU), preventive measures should focus on biosecurity rather than displacement of bats, which are protected throughout the EU and provide critical ecosystem services for rural settings.","Leopardi, Stefania; Priori, Pamela; Zecchin, Barbara; Zamperin, Gianpiero; Milani, Adelaide; Tonon, Francesco; Giorgiutti, Mirco; Beato, Maria Serena; De Benedictis, Paola",Viruses,,498
227515,Systemic risk: The impact of COVID-19,2020,"Chronic disease management models in primary care have demonstrated significant benefits to the patient experience and patient health outcomes. In trying to prepare for the future, with or without COVID-19 implications, dental providers and clinics are facing opportunities to add value, consider alternative payment models, and to incorporate risk stratification and population health management along with medical systems. However, as alternative payment models emerge in dentistry, stand-alone dental clinics may face unique challenges in trying to prepare for the future while still providing patient care in the fee for service environment. This article focuses on a 6-months pilot project of how implementing a comprehensive caries disease management care model, evaluating caries risk, and implementing risk stratification strategies can prepare dental offices for future payment models and inclusion in the greater health system. There are two overall goals for this pilot. First, applying a caries disease management protocol to every patient visit, regardless of reimbursement. Second, applying quality improvement (QI) principles to change how a dental office approaches care delivery. The Institute of Medicine defines quality in healthcare as a direct correlation between the level of improved health services and the desired health outcomes of individuals and populations.","Bruner, Tess",J Public Health Dent,,498

METHODS: We optimized the temperature used in the dry heat pasteurization method to destroy pathogens and decontaminate masks while retaining their filtering capacity. RESULTS: The current study showed that dry heat at both 60°C and 70°C for 1 hour could successfully kill 6 species of respiratory bacteria and one fungi species, and inactivate the H1N1 indicator virus. After being heated at 70°C for 1, 2, and 3 hours, the N95 respirators and surgical face masks showed no changes in their shape and components. The filtering efficiency of bacterial aerosol for N95 respirators were 98%, 98%, and 97% after being heated for 1, 2, and 3 hour, respectively, all of which were over the 95% efficiency required and similar to the value before being heated (99%). The filtering efficiency for surgical face masks was 97%, 97%, and 96% for 1, 2, and 3 hours of heating, respectively, all of which were also similar to the value before being heated (97%).

Our hospital, which is located in the immediate vicinity, reacted very quickly in addition to adapting patient care by implementing an organizational structure for recording SARS-CoV-2-positive employees, patients and their contact persons. OBJECTIVES: The infections recorded in contact tracing were analysed and, based on an exemplary outbreak, infection chains and follow-up processes were evaluated. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Comprehensive data on contact types, oropharyngeal swab results for SARS-CoV­2 and quarantine days were documented and retrospectively evaluated using a self-developed database. RESULTS: Of the 568 employees recorded by in-house contact tracing, 32 employees (1.2%, nâ¯= 2567) were detected as SARS-CoV­2 positive. Of those, 50% (nâ¯= 16) tested positive due to contact tracing, 15.6% (nâ¯= 5) were recorded by routine smears and 34.4% (nâ¯= 11) were returning travellers. The variable PCR results of the control smears from these positive employees were noticeable. In 18.8% (nâ¯= 6) of the initially negative control smears, positive PCR results were found in the following control smear. The inhouse contact tracing team was able to detect infection clusters on non-COVID-19 wards at an early stage and, together with clinical hygiene and the public health department, initiated comprehensive measures to limit the spread of the virus. Infection chains could thus be interrupted. CONCLUSION: The work of the clinic's own contact tracing unit has proven to be an essential part of clinical pandemic management not least against the background of new waves of infection and is indispensable for the detection of local infection clusters.","Quacken, Florian; Greiffendorf, Ingo; Ropertz, Susanne; Peters, David; Bergrath, Sebastian; Aretz, Sabine; Lahm, Andreas; Pesch, Alexander; Wimmer-Dahmen, Marie-Luise; Graeven, Ullrich",Bundesgesundheitsblatt gesundheitsforschung gesundheitsschutz,,498

Play, a fundamental part of childhood, may be integral to children's health during crises. We undertook a rapid review of the impact of quarantine, isolation and other restrictive environments on play and whether play mitigates adverse effects of such restrictions. Fifteen peer-reviewed studies were identified, spanning hospitals, juvenile and immigration detention and refugee camps. We found evidence of changes in children's access to play in crises and quarantine. These studies indicated how play might support children enduring isolation but lacked robust investigations of play as an intervention in mitigating impacts of restriction. Studies pertaining to children in isolation due to infectious disease outbreaks were notably absent. It is important that the potential effects of changes to such a crucial aspect of childhood are better understood to support children in this and future crises.","Graber, Kelsey M; Byrne, Elizabeth M; Goodacre, Emily J; Kirby, Natalie; Kulkarni, Krishna; O039,; Farrelly, Christine; Ramchandani, Paul G",Child care health dev,,498

The development of vascular inflammation may also contribute to a hypercoagulable state and endothelial dysfunction in such patients. It is known that multi-organ damage is more likely in patients with sepsis if they develop coagulopathy and that inhibition of thrombin synthesis can have a positive impact in reducing mortality. In this review, we will focus on the protection of the most fragile groups of the population, such as the elderly. This segment of the population will be a key issue and probably of primary interest to all. Biomarkers appear to be extremely useful as an indicator of what is happening from a pathophysiological point of view in the heart, allowing us to better stratify the prognosis of our patients affected by COVID-19, especially in the most severe cases and those with comorbidities.","Costa, Raffaele; Castagna, Alberto; Ruotolo, Giovanni",,,498

An early systematic analysis of autonomic dysfunction following COVID-19 is lacking and may provide initial insights into the spectrum of this condition. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of all patients with confirmed history of COVID-19 infection referred for autonomic testing for symptoms concerning for para-/postinfectious autonomic dysfunction at Mayo Clinic Rochester or Jacksonville between March 2020 and January 2021. RESULTS: We identified 27 patients fulfilling the search criteria. Symptoms developed between 0 and 122 days following the acute infection and included lightheadedness (93%), orthostatic headache (22%), syncope (11%), hyperhidrosis (11%), and burning pain (11%). Sudomotor function was abnormal in 36%, cardiovagal function in 27%, and cardiovascular adrenergic function in 7%. The most common clinical scenario was orthostatic symptoms without tachycardia or hypotension (41%); 22% of patients fulfilled the criteria for postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS), and 11% had borderline findings to support orthostatic intolerance. One patient each was diagnosed with autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy, inappropriate sinus tachycardia, vasodepressor syncope, cough/vasovagal syncope, exacerbation of preexisting orthostatic hypotension, exacerbation of sensory and autonomic neuropathy, and exacerbation of small fiber neuropathy. CONCLUSION: Abnormalities on autonomic testing were seen in the majority of patients but were mild in most cases. The most common finding was orthostatic intolerance, often without objective hemodynamic abnormalities on testing. Unmasking/exacerbation of preexisting conditions was seen. The temporal association between infection and autonomic symptoms implies a causal relationship, which however cannot be proven by this study.","Shouman, Kamal; Vanichkachorn, Greg; Cheshire, William P; Suarez, Mariana D; Shelly, Shahar; Lamotte, Guillaume J; Sandroni, Paola; Benarroch, Eduardo E; Berini, Sarah E; Cutsforth-Gregory, Jeremy K; Coon, Elizabeth A; Mauermann, Michelle L; Low, Phillip A; Singer, Wolfgang",Clin Auton Res,,498

This study was an investigation of the prevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 among blood donors in Saudi Arabia. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among blood donors in Saudi Arabia during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Serology results and epidemiological data were analyzed for 837 adult blood donors, with no confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, in Saudi Arabia from 20th to 25th May 2020. Seroprevalence was determined using electrochemical immunoassay to detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. RESULTS: The overall seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was 1.4% (12/837). Non-citizens had higher seroprevalence compared with citizens (OR 13.6, p = 0.001). Secondary education was significantly associated with higher seroprevalence compared with higher education (OR 6.8, p = 0.005). The data showed that the highest seroprevalence was in Makkah (8.1%). Uisng Makkah seroprevalence as the reference, the seroprevalence in other areas was: Madinah 4.1% (OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.12-1.94), Jeddah 2.3% (OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.31-2.25), and Qassim 2.9 % (OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.04-2.89) and these were not statistically different from seroprevalence in the Makkah region. CONCLUSIONS: At the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic in Saudi Arabia, the seroprevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 among blood donors was low, but was higher among non-citizens. These findings may indicate that non-citizens and less educated individuals may be less attentive to preventive measures. Monitoring seroprevalence trends over time require repeated sampling.","Banjar, Ayman; Al-Tawfiq, Jaffar A; Alruwaily, Amaal; Alserehi, Haleema; Al-Qunaibet, Ada; Alaswad, Rehab; Almutlaq, Hind; Almudaiheem, Abdullah; Khojah, Abdullah T; Alsaif, Faisal; Almolad, Shaza Karim; Alqahtani, Saeed; AlJurayyan, Abdullah; Alotaibi, Abdullah; Almalki, Safar; Abuhaimed, Yousef; Alkhashan, Abdullah; Alfaifi, Amal; Alabdulkareem, Khaled; Jokhdar, Hani; Assiri, Abdullah; Almudarra, Sami",Int J Infect Dis,,498

Here, we present the cryo-electron microscopy structure of a translating mammalian ribosome primed for frameshifting on the viral RNA. The viral RNA adopts a pseudoknot structure that lodges at the entry to the ribosomal messenger RNA (mRNA) channel to generate tension in the mRNA and promote frameshifting, whereas the nascent viral polyprotein forms distinct interactions with the ribosomal tunnel. Biochemical experiments validate the structural observations and reveal mechanistic and regulatory features that influence frameshifting efficiency. Finally, we compare compounds previously shown to reduce frameshifting with respect to their ability to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication, establishing coronavirus frameshifting as a target for antiviral intervention.","Bhatt, Pramod R; Scaiola, Alain; Loughran, Gary; Leibundgut, Marc; Kratzel, Annika; Meurs, Romane; Dreos, René; O039,; Connor, Kate M; McMillan, Angus; Bode, Jeffrey W; Thiel, Volker; Gatfield, David; Atkins, John F; Ban, Nenad",Science,,498

METHODS: A 3-month pilot randomized controlled trial was conducted to compare the mobile interventionist approach as an add-on to assertive community treatment (ACT) versus ACT alone. Participants were 49 individuals with serious mental illness (62% with schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder, 24% with bipolar disorder, and 14% with depression). Clinical outcomes were evaluated at baseline, posttreatment, and 6-month follow-up, and satisfaction was evaluated posttreatment. RESULTS: The intervention appeared feasible (95% of participants assigned to the mobile interventionist arm initiated the intervention, texting on 69% of possible days and averaging four messages per day), acceptable (91% reported satisfaction), and safe (no adverse events reported). Exploratory posttreatment clinical effect estimations suggested greater reductions in the severity of paranoid thoughts (Cohen's d=-0.61) and depression (d=-0.59) and improved illness management (d=0.31) and recovery (d=0.23) in the mobile interventionist group. CONCLUSIONS: Augmentation of care with a texting mobile interventionist proved to be feasible, acceptable, safe, and clinically promising. The findings are encouraging given the relative ease of training practitioners to serve as mobile interventionists, the low burden placed on patients and practitioners, and the simplicity of the technology. The technical resources are widely accessible to patients and practitioners, boding well for potential intervention scalability. When pandemics such as COVID-19 block the possibility of in-person patient-provider contact, evidence-based texting interventions can serve a crucial role in supporting continuity of care.","Ben-Zeev, Dror; Buck, Benjamin; Meller, Suzanne; Hudenko, William J; Hallgren, Kevin A",Psychiatr Serv,,498

Most are treated with statins, but the impact of these drugs on clinical outcomes of COVID-19 remains unclear. This report is therefore based on meta-analyses of retrospective observational studies aimed at investigating the impact of previous statin therapy in patients hospitalized for COVID-19. METHODS: In studies reporting on the clinical outcomes of COVID-19 in statin users vs non-users, two endpoints have been used-in-hospital death rates, and disease severity as assessed by admission to intensive care units (ICUs)-with a special focus on patients with diabetes. RESULTS: Regarding mortality, 13 studies were included in the meta-analysis for a total of 10,829 statin users (2517 deaths) and 31,893 non-users (7516 deaths): univariate analysis showed no statistically significant reduction in deaths (OR: 0.97, 95% CI: 0.92-1.03), although between-study heterogeneity was high (I² = 97%). As for disease severity, 11 studies were selected for a total of 3462 statin users (724 endpoints) and 10,560 non-users (1763 endpoints): here again, univariate analysis showed no reduction in severity (OR: 1.09, 95% CI: 0.99-1.22; I² = 93%). Collectively, in 10 studies using multivariable analysis adjusted for the more prevalent baseline risk factors among statin users, lower OR values were reported than with univariate analyses (0.73 ± 0.31 vs 1.44 ± 0.84, respectively; P = 0.0028; adjusted OR: P = 0.0237 vs non-users). Limited but conflicting findings were observed for diabetes patients. CONCLUSION: Although no significant reductions in either in-hospital mortality or COVID-19 severity were reported among statin users compared with non-users after univariate comparisons, such reductions were observed after adjusting for confounding factors. These highly heterogeneous observational findings now require confirmation by ongoing randomized clinical trials.","Scheen, André J",Diabetes Metab,,498

In this work, the mechanism of electron delivery was confirmed experimentally by both measuring currents through ice and monitoring photodissociated OH radicals on ice by using a novel method. The surface OH radicals significantly decrease upon the appearance of negative current flow, indicating that the electrons are delivered by proton-hole (OH-) transfer in ice triggered by OH- production on the surface. The mechanism of proton-hole transfer was rationalized by density functional theory calculations.","Kitajima, Kensei; Nakai, Yoichi; Sameera, W M C; Tsuge, Masashi; Miyazaki, Ayane; Hidaka, Hiroshi; Kouchi, Akira; Watanabe, Naoki",J Phys Chem Lett,,498
239489,The effect of covid-19 pandemic on consumer online purchasing behavior,2021,"OBJECTIVE: The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic on 11th March 2020. The UK government introduced strict social distancing measures on 23rd March 2020, with the country put into a full lockdown to further halt the spread of the virus.The aims of this article are to ascertain whether there was a rise in the incidence of deliberate self-harm (DSH) presentations to the emergency department at a level one trauma center associated with the introduction of lockdown measures. METHOD: An observational study from a level one trauma center was carried out. Retrospective data from 23rd March 2020 to 1st May 2020 was collected and compared to the same time period in 2019. Data was collected from coded electronic patient records. RESULTS: Total attendances to the Emergency Department (ED) reduced from 2019 to 2020 (5198 and 3059 respectively). There was a significant increase in the total number of self-harm presentations between 2019 and 2020 (103 vs 113, p-value <0.001) as well as paracetamol, NSAID and opiate overdoses, with more cases requiring hospital admission in 2020 vs 2019. CONCLUSIONS: Societal lockdown measures secondary to the COVID-19 pandemic have had a significant effect on the mental health of patients. One way this can be detected is through an increased incidence and severity of deliberate self-harm injuries presenting to the ED. These findings, in conjunction with the available, literature provide valuable implications for community and emergency physicians and psychiatrists for any future wave of disease or pandemic.","Henry, Nader; Parthiban, Sunil; Farroha, Azzam",Int J Psychiatry Med,,498

MATERIAL AND METHODS There were 189 patients who underwent the qualification procedure to lung transplantation in the Department of Cardiac and Vascular Surgery of the University Clinical Center in Gdansk, Poland in the years 2019 and 2020. The control group consisted of 12 patients transplanted in 2019, and the study group consisted of 16 patients transplanted in 2020. RESULTS During 2019, the qualification process was performed in 102 patients with pulmonary end-stage diseases. In 2020, despite the 3-month lockdown related to organizational changes in the hospital, 87 qualification processes were performed. The mortality rate of patients on the waiting list in 2020 was 14.3% (6 patients died), and during 2019 the rate was also 14.3% (4 patients died). Donor qualifications were according to ISHLT criteria. The distribution of donors in both years was similar. There was no relationship between the geographic area of residence and source of donors. In 2019, all 12 patients had double-lung transplant. In 2020, 11 patients had double-lung transplant and 5 patients had single-lung transplant. There was no difference in ventilation time and PGD aside from a shorter ICU stay in 2020.

242571,Cross the river by feeling the stones: How did nonlocal grassroots nonprofits overcome administrative barriers to provide quick responses to COVID-19?,2021,"Tan sheep is an indigenous ovine breed of China known for its high meat quality and pleasing taste. Seven herbs of traditional Chinese medicine, namely, Ephedra sinica, Glycyrrhiza uralensis, Caragana korshinskii, Allium mongolicum, Thymus vulgaris, Astragalus membranaceus, and Lespedeza bicolor are commonly grazed by Tan sheep. It has been widely believed that these herbs are of high nutritive value, which may significantly contribute to the high meat quality and distinct flavor of Tan sheep. However, the nutritive values of these herbs have not been evaluated to date. In this study, samples of the seven herbs were collected from the steppe of Yanchi County of Ningxia Autonomous Region of China. The dry matter (DM), crude protein (CP), ether extract (EE), ash (Ash), calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), and acid detergent fiber (ADF) of these herbs were measured using locally cultivated alfalfa as the standard forage. Digestion of the dry matter, neutral detergent fiber, acid detergent fiber, and crude protein in the rumen of Tan sheep was examined using the nylon bag method, in order to evaluate their feeding nutritional value. Our results show that all the seven herbs meet the nutritional needs of ruminants based on the standard forage alfalfa. However, Ephedra, Glycyrrhiza, Caragana, Allium, Astragalus, and Lespedeza have higher nutritive value than Thymus (P < 0.05). According to the ruminal degradation rates of dry matter, neutral detergent fiber, acid detergent fiber, and crude protein, the nutritive value of Caragana, Allium, and Lespedeza is higher than that of Ephedra, Glycyrrhiza, Astragalus, and Thymus (P < 0.05). The overall nutritive value of Allium is the highest among the seven herbs and therefore Allium is recommended to better meet the nutritional needs of Tan sheep.","Jiang, Biwei; Zhou, Yuxiang; Wang, Tian; Li, Fei",Bioengineered,,498

Despite the fact that the mgc2 gene has been widely used for diagnostic and molecular characterization purposes, there is a lack of evidence supporting the reliability of this gene as a marker for molecular epidemiology approaches. Therefore, the current study aimed to assess the accuracy of the mgc2 gene for phylogenetic, phylodynamic, and phylogeographic evaluations. Furthermore, the global phylodynamic expansion of MG is described, and the origin and extension of the outbreak caused by MG in Ecuador were tracked and characterized. The results obtained strongly supported the use of the mgc2 gene as a reliable phylogenetic marker and accurate estimator for the temporal and phylogeographic structure reconstruction of MG. The phylodynamic analysis denoted the failures in the current policies to control MG and highlighted the imperative need to implement more sensitive methodologies of diagnosis and more efficient vaccines. Framed in Ecuador, the present study provides the first piece of evidence of the circulation of virulent field MG strains in Ecuadorian commercial poultry. The findings derived from the current study provide novel and significant insights into the origin, diversification, and evolutionary process of MG globally.","De la Cruz, Laura; Barrera, Maritza; Rios, Liliam; Corona-González, Belkis; Bulnes, Carlos A; Díaz-Sánchez, Adrian A; A Agüero, Jose; Lobo-Rivero, Evelyn; Pérez, Lester J",,,498

243891,Crisis leadership during COVID-19: the role of governors in the United States,2020,"COVID-19 has disproportionately affected persons who identify as non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native (AI/AN) (1). The Blackfeet Tribal Reservation, the northern Montana home of the sovereign Blackfeet Nation, with an estimated population of 10,629 (2), detected the first COVID-19 case in the community on June 16, 2020. Following CDC guidance,* and with free testing widely available, the Indian Health Service and Blackfeet Tribal Health Department began investigating all confirmed cases and their contacts on June 25. The relationship between three community mitigation resolutions passed and enforced by the Blackfeet Tribal Business Council and changes in the daily COVID-19 incidence and in the distributions of new cases was assessed. After the September 28 issuance of a strictly enforced stay-at-home order and adoption of a mask use resolution, COVID-19 incidence in the Blackfeet Tribal Reservation decreased by a factor of 33 from its peak of 6.40 cases per 1,000 residents per day on October 5 to 0.19 on November 7. Other mitigation measures the Blackfeet Tribal Reservation used included closing the east gate of Glacier National Park for the summer tourism season, instituting remote learning for public school students throughout the fall semester, and providing a Thanksgiving meal to every household to reduce trips to grocery stores. CDC has recommended use of routine public health interventions for infectious diseases, including case investigation with prompt isolation, contact tracing, and immediate quarantine after exposure to prevent and control transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 (3). Stay-at-home orders, physical distancing, and mask wearing indoors, outdoors when physical distancing is not possible, or when in close contact with infected or exposed persons are also recommended as nonpharmaceutical community mitigation measures (3,4). Implementation and strict enforcement of stay-at-home orders and a mask use mandate likely helped reduce the spread of COVID-19 in the Blackfeet Tribal Reservation.","Pratt, Caroline Q; Chard, Anna N; LaPine, Rosaula; Galbreath, K Webb; Crawford, Cinnamon; Plant, Albert; Stiffarm, Garland; Rhodes, Neil Sun; Hannon, Lorissa; Dinh, Thu-Ha",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,498
244134,Changing to improve? Organizational change and change-oriented leadership in hospitals,2020,"OBJECTIVES: Reports from China relating to coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in children indicate a milder disease course compared with adults. Although a few pediatric COVID-19 reports from other parts of the world exist, there are none from the United Kingdom. We describe the clinical characteristics of children with COVID-19 admitted to a specialist children's hospital in United Kingdom. METHODS: Retrospective case-series of inpatients with a positive polymerase chain reaction test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, during a 6-week period from March 14 to April 24, 2020. RESULTS: Forty-five children tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 during the study period. Median (interquartile range) age was 3.5 (0.7-12) years, and 31 (69%) were male. Children with comorbidities constituted 64% (29 of 45) of the study population, including 44% (20 of 45) who were considered ""extremely vulnerable."" Fever (67%) and cough (55%) were the most common symptoms. High C-reactive protein (>10 mg/L) was observed in 68% (19 of 28). Lymphopenia (<1.2 × 109/L) was observed in 23% (9 of 40) of children, but it was related to coexisting medical conditions in 6 children. Nine children required supplemental oxygen, two of whom received high-flow nasal cannula oxygen; one needed noninvasive ventilation and one child required invasive mechanical ventilation. Median length of stay of children with an admission outcome (n = 42, 93%) was 3 (2-7) days. There were no COVID-19-related deaths. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 had a relatively mild course of illness in majority of the hospitalized children that included a subgroup of vulnerable children with significant comorbidities. Confirmation of this in larger nationwide studies of children is required.","Kanthimathinathan, Hari Krishnan; Dhesi, Amrit; Hartshorn, Stuart; Ali, Syed Habib; Kirk, Jeremy; Nagakumar, Prasad; Jyothish, Deepthi",Hosp Pediatr,,498

Soccer, arguably, one of the most globalized industries, has reacted to the event by closing down much of its operations. This paper reviews the speed and breadth of such closures and compares it to another major event in history: The Second World War. During the latter, soccer continued operations despite the apparent difficulties. Total closures were, for the most part, temporary, and the sport was practiced whenever possible. The way that soccer operated during the war contrasts with how it has responded to the COVID-19 crisis. In record time, virtually all leagues in the world stopped operations, and for the first time since its foundation, with but a few exceptions, there were no games anywhere in the world.","Tovar, Jorge",Soccer Soc.,,498

Gradual deterioration of the patient's fitness is resistant to nutritional intervention. The biochemical foundation of observed catabolism, detrimental protein, and energy balance is complex. However, the generalized inflammatory response plays a vital role. It is a kind of cytokine storm, which involves increased activity of TNF-&#945;, IL-1, IL-6, and INF-Î³. Pharmacological treatment of cachexia consists mainly of progestagens and glucocorticosteroids. Still, the assessment of new options limiting the harmful impact of cachexia could be beneficial. Chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) are old antimalarial agents endowed with immunomodulatory properties. Being potent autophagy inhibitors, they could lead to a form of intracellular starvation in both cytokine-releasing cells and cancer cells, thus limiting the harmful impact of CC. CQ and HCQ are also efficient in particular connective tissue disorders. They have gained special attention since the World Health Organization announced the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. According to initial reports, people with a severe inflammatory reaction showed significant benefits. Possibly they could not be attributed to the antiviral activity alone. It is worth noting that the cytokine storm in COVID-19, connective tissue disorders, and cancer cachexia share some similarities. Therefore, we hypothesize that low doses of CQ/HCQ may prove efficient in cancer cachexia.","Kiedrowski, Miroslaw; Kapala, Przemyslaw; Kiedrowska, Marlena; Skoczynska, Anna; Czerw, Aleksandra; Deptala, Andrzej",Med Hypotheses,,498

Mobile web-based educational materials provide a novel and potentially valuable means to communicate clinical information that can aid in both medical management and rehabilitation. AIMS: We, therefore, evaluated an educational tablet-based intervention in three patient cohorts regarding the following topics: Parkinson's disease (PD) medications, dystonia and botulinum toxin treatment. METHODS: A total of 50 subjects with PD, 32 with dystonia and 61 receiving botulinum toxin treatment for movement disorders or sialorrhoea were enrolled. Participants in each cohort completed a specific educational module at the time of their regularly scheduled clinic visit, comprising slides, in addition to pre- and post-module quizzes and a satisfaction survey. Additionally, participants in the dystonia and botulinum toxin modules were given a follow-up test at their 3- or 6-month clinical treatment visit. RESULTS: There were 143 participants with 50 completing the PD module, 32 completing the dystonia module and 61 completing the botulinum toxin module. All three groups demonstrated significant improvement in knowledge of module content between their pre- and post-module test scores (PD: p=.0001, dystonia: p<.0001 and botulinum toxin: p=.008), and those who took the dystonia module maintained significant improvement at either a 3- or 6-month follow up compared to pre-module (p <.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Tablet-based teaching modules are an effective means of communicating key concepts to patients. This study supports their use for improving patient understanding that can support lifelong approaches to managing disabling, neurological conditions.Implication for RehabilitationTablet-based modules are relatively easy to use for enhancing education during clinic visits and can possibly help reduce and maintain disability with chronic conditions like Parkinson's disease and dystonia.Improvements in post-test scores suggested that patient participants were able to retain information from the tablets about their complex and challenging conditions and treatments.Adding patients who are fluent in another language would have made this study more generalizable and future studies exploring educational interventions are warranted to help better tailor interventions to patients with chronic neurologic illnesses to help understand the complex aspects of their medical and rehabilitation therapy.The effect of cognitive changes in neurological conditions and understanding of educational information needs to be further tested.This positive result is especially meaningful during the COVID-19 pandemic when in-person access to both medical and rehabilitative care has been curtailed.","Hellmers, Natalie; Barkan, Samantha; Auerbach, Gabrielle; Hanineva, Aneliya; Popa, Paul; Sarva, Harini; Henchcliffe, Claire",Disabil Rehabil Assist Technol,,498

Italy is struggling hard with CoVID-19 pandemic since the end of February 2020, to avoid the collapse of its health system. The number of CoVID-19 patients and deaths are increasing day by day. At time of writing, in Italy there are 102253 infected patients and 19899 deaths.

Fully 80% of beds in our hospital are reserved for ill CoVID-19 patients and ICU has tripled the number of beds. All these changes have required a great effort for all the medical staff to avoid the collpase of the local health system. We struggled to maintain our normal standard of care for each patient, but the severity of the disease and the high number of critically ill patients frustrated our efforts.

The control group will not be given any intervention and only monitoring of these symptoms will be done to compare the recovery time. METHODS: This prospective interventional study was conducted from June to Nov 2020 at, Datta Meghe University during the COVID-19 outbreak. The 120 enrolled patients were tested at days 1 and 5 after proven infection by RT-PCR test. RESULT: The mean age for all cases is 50.88 ± 15.93 years, whereas for the controls mean age is 51.2 ± 14.89. 2. Among cases 45 (75%) were males and 15 (25%) were females, among controls 43 (71.66%) were males and 17 (28.33%) were females. Among the case group, after the use of fluticasone spray in the nose and triamcinolone paste in the mouth there was a statistically significant improvement in recognizing all the odours and taste on day 5 compared to day 1. On comparing the smell and taste of cases and control group, either there is no improvement or worsening in smell or taste on day 5 in the control group. CONCLUSION: The use of fluticasone nasal spray and triamcinolone paste had immensely influenced the basic senses such as smell and taste. Our study showed that olfactory and taste function significantly improved in patients with COVID-19. For all anosmia and dysgeusia cases who received fluticasone nasal spray and triamcinolone medications the recovery of smell senses and the taste was within a week.","Singh, Chandra Veer; Jain, Shraddha; Parveen, Sana",Am J Otolaryngol,,498

250362,How prepared is India to control the COVID-19 pandemic?,2020,"Severe COVID-19 infection results in bilateral interstitial pneumonia, often leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and pulmonary fibrosis in survivors. Most patients with severe COVID-19 infections who died had developed ARDS. Currently, ARDS is treated with supportive measures, but regenerative medicine approaches including extracellular vesicle (EV)-based therapies have shown promise. Herein, we aimed to analyse whether EV-based therapies could be effective in treating severe pulmonary conditions that affect COVID-19 patients and to understand their relevance for an eventual therapeutic application to human patients. Using a defined search strategy, we conducted a systematic review of the literature and found 39 articles (2014–2020) that reported effects of EVs, mainly derived from stem cells, in lung injury models (one large animal study, none in human). EV treatment resulted in: (1) attenuation of inflammation (reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and neutrophil infiltration, M2 macrophage polarization); (2) regeneration of alveolar epithelium (decreased apoptosis and stimulation of surfactant production); (3) repair of microvascular permeability (increased endothelial cell junction proteins); (4) prevention of fibrosis (reduced fibrin production). These effects were mediated by the release of EV cargo and identified factors including miRs-126, −30b-3p, −145, −27a-3p, syndecan-1, hepatocyte growth factor and angiopoietin-1. This review indicates that EV-based therapies hold great potential for COVID-19 related lung injuries as they target multiple pathways and enhance tissue regeneration. However, before translating EV therapies into human clinical trials, efforts should be directed at developing good manufacturing practice solutions for EVs and testing optimal dosage and administration route in large animal models.","Khalaj, Kasra; Figueira, Rebeca Lopes; Antounians, Lina; Lauriti, Giuseppe; Zani, Augusto",J.

251130,The Impact of a Pre-Medicine Pharmacology-Focussed Capstone in the Preparation of Students for Medical School,2021,"The ß-phase, in which the intermonomer torsion angle of a fraction of chain segments approaches â¼180°, is an intriguing conformational microstructure of the widely studied light-emitting polymer poly(9,9-dioctylfluorene) (PFO). Its generation can in turn be used to significantly improve the performance of PFO emission-layer-based light-emitting diodes (LEDs). Here, we report the generation of ß-phase chain segments in a copolymer, 90F8:10BT, containing 90% 9,9-dioctylfluorene (F8) and 10% 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BT) units and show that significant improvements in performance also ensue for LEDs with ß-phase 90F8:10BT emission layers, generalizing the earlier PFO results. The ß-phase was induced by both solvent vapor annealing and dipping copolymer thin films into a solvent/nonsolvent mixture. Subsequent absorption spectra show the characteristic fluorene ß-phase peak at â¼435 nm, but luminescence spectra (â¼530 nm peak) and quantum yields barely change, with the emission arising following efficient energy transfer to the lowest-lying excited states localized in the vicinity of the BT units. For â¼5% ß-phase chain segment fraction relative to 0% ß-phase, the LED luminance at 10 V increased by â¼25% to 5940 cd m-2, the maximum external quantum efficiency by â¼61 to 1.91%, and the operational stability from 64% luminance retention after 20 h of operation to 90%. Detailed studies addressing the underlying device physics identify a reduced hole injection barrier, higher hole mobility, correspondingly more balanced electron and hole charge transport, and decreased carrier trapping as the dominant factors. These results confirm the effectiveness of chain conformation control for fluorene-based homo- and copolymer device optimization.","Wang, Bingjun; Ye, Hao; Riede, Moritz; Bradley, Donal D C",ACS appl. mater. interfaces (Online),,498

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: During the COVID-19 pandemic, health care workers are suffering from increased rates of mental health disturbances. Residents' duty obligations put them at increased physical and mental health risk. It is only by prioritizing their well-being that we can better serve the patients and prepare for a surge. Therefore, it is imperative that measures are put in place to protect them. METHODS: Resident wellness was optimized by targeting 3 domains: efficiency of practice, culture of wellness and personal resilience. RESULTS: Efficiency in delivering information and patient care minimizes additional stress to residents that is caused by the pandemic. By having a reserve team, prioritizing the safety of residents and taking burnout seriously, the culture of wellness and sense of community in our program are emphasized. All of the residents' personal resilience was further optimized by the regular and mandatory measures put in place by the program. CONCLUSIONS: The new challenges brought on by a pandemic puts increased pressure on residents. Measures must be put in place to protect resident from the increased physical and mental health stress in order to best serve patients during this difficult time.","Lie, Jessica J; Huynh, Caroline; Scott, Tracy M; Karimuddin, Ahmer A",J. surg. educ,,498

The majority of infected individuals have mild to moderate symptoms, but a significant proportion develops respiratory failure due to pneumonia. Thrombosis is another frequent manifestation of Covid-19 that contributes to poor outcomes. Vitamin K plays a crucial role in the activation of both pro- and anticlotting factors in the liver and the activation of extrahepatically synthesised protein S which seems to be important in local thrombosis prevention. However, the role of vitamin K extends beyond coagulation. Matrix Gla protein (MGP) is a vitamin K-dependent inhibitor of soft tissue calcification and elastic fibre degradation. Severe extrahepatic vitamin K insufficiency was recently demonstrated in Covid-19 patients, with high inactive MGP levels correlating with elastic fibre degradation rates. This suggests that insufficient vitamin K-dependent MGP activation leaves elastic fibres unprotected against SARS-CoV-2-induced proteolysis. In contrast to MGP, Covid-19 patients have normal levels of activated factor II, in line with previous observations that vitamin K is preferentially transported to the liver for activation of procoagulant factors. We therefore expect that vitamin K-dependent endothelial protein S activation is also compromised, which would be compatible with enhanced thrombogenicity. Taking these data together, we propose a mechanism of pneumonia-induced vitamin K depletion, leading to a decrease in activated MGP and protein S, aggravating pulmonary damage and coagulopathy, respectively. Intervention trials should be conducted to assess whether vitamin K administration plays a role in the prevention and treatment of severe Covid-19.","Janssen, Rob; Visser, Margot P J; Dofferhoff, Anton S M; Vermeer, Cees; Janssens, Wim; Walk, Jona",Br J Nutr,,498

Brazil occupies the 2nd position in numbers of infected cases and deaths, preceded only by the United States. Older adults and those with pre-existing chronic illnesses are more vulnerable to the consequences of the virus. The SARS-CoV-2 epidemic has serious consequences for health services. Therefore, an assessment of the pandemic's effect on the older Brazilian population is urgently needed. The study examines the prevalence of COVID-19 related symptoms, care-seeking, and cancellation of surgery or other scheduled medical care among a nationally representative sample of Brazilians aged 50 and over derived from the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSI-Brazil) and a telephone follow-up survey (the ELSI-COVID-19 initiative) between late May and early June 2020. About 10.4% of older adults reported any fever, dry cough or difficulty breathing in the 30 days prior to the interview, with the highest prevalence in the North region (50%). Among individuals with symptoms, only 33.6% sought care. Individuals living in the South or Southeast regions were significantly less likely to seek care for COVID-19 related symptoms. Nearly one in six participants had to cancel scheduled surgery or other medical care; this proportion was higher among women, those with more education, and people with multiple chronic conditions. This paper is among the first to investigate the effect of COVID-19 on health care use in Brazil among older adults. Results highlight the need to adapt health care delivery (such as through telemedicine) to ensure the continuity of care as well as the urgent need for wide dissemination of information to guide the population on disease prevention measures and how to obtain healthcare when needed.","Macinko, James; Woolley, Natalia Oliveira; Seixas, Brayan V; Andrade, Fabiola Bof de; Lima-Costa, Maria Fernanda",Cad Saude Publica,,498

This virus is very complex, transfer human-to-human, belonging to the family coronaviridea and genera betacoronavirus. By the infection, common symptoms have been observed like a sudden high fever in between 1 to 9 days and some of the problem in the neck region with starting infection day and then this infection spread into the lungs causes novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) and kidney failure. At this time, to find a solution to the problem, a lot of researchers is working together to solve this problem. According to the WHO, more than 3588773 cases were confirmed around globally by the infected COVID-19. Many of the receptor protein of the SARS-CoV-2 and target proteins of the human cell is responsible for endocytosis like Mpro or 3CLpro, RNA polymerase, spike protein etc. These proteins play a vital role in the life cycle of SARS-CoV-2. As anti-COVID-19 drugs, many compounds were designed by computational methods to inactive of the receptor protein has been reported. Some of the drugs are ongoing under trail, and these drugs will be shows strong potent activity against this virus in the future. In this study represent about the synthetic and computational designed approach drugs and compounds for the inhibit receptor of SARS-CoV-2. This review will be helpful to find a new approach drug as an inhibitory receptor of SARS-CoV-2 structure and their life cycle, and also be helpful to identify and synthesis of effective drug and vaccine candidates for anti-novel coronavirus.

Those patients were admitted to beds close to each other, two of them developed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), one exhibited primary bacteremia and the remaining four were considered to be colonized. None of them was colonized prior to admission to the ICU an all, except one of those who developed VAP, were discharged. Hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir were administered to all of them as COVID-19 therapy and additionally, three of them received tocilizumab and corticosteroids, respectively. Reusing of personal protective equipment due to its initial shortage, relaxation in infection control measures and negative-pressure air in ICU rooms recommended for the protection of health care workers (HCWs), could have contributed to this outbreak. Maximization of infection control measures is essential to avoid secondary infections by MDR bacteria in COVID-infected patients.","García-Meniño, Isidro; Forcelledo, Lorena; Rosete, Yaiza; García-Prieto, Emilio; Escudero, Dolores; Fernández, Javier",J Infect Public Health,,498

There is no confirmed evidence about the mortality comparison between COVID-19 patients with lung cancer and other tumors. We performed a systematic review and pooled analysis to provide precise estimates of the mortality rate of COVID-19 patients with lung cancer and other tumors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our study systemically included and reviewed 13 studies on the characteristics of COVID-19 patients with lung cancer published up to November 1, 2020. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality. We also compared the all-cause mortality rates in China and other regions as a secondary endpoint. The mortality rate was assessed with a fixed-effects model, which was used to derive the pooled mortality and 95 % conï¬dence interval (CI). RESULTS: Thirteen studies from different countries, involving 1,229 patients with both COVID-19 and cancer, were selected for the pooled analysis. A total of 343 deaths were recorded in this population: 86 for lung cancers and 257 for other tumors. The mortality rate varies from 18 % to 60 % for patients with lung cancer and COVID-19 and 10%-41% for other tumor patients with COVID-19. The overall meta-analysis did not show a significant mortality difference for the lung cancer and other tumor subgroups (OR = 1.47, 95 %CI = 0.98-2.20, p = 0.06, I2 = 23 %). Nevertheless, in regions other than China, the pooled mortality of lung cancer patients with COVID-19 was 42 %, which was significantly higher than that of other tumors (24 %) (OR = 2.73, 95 % CI = 1.54-4.86, p = 0.0006, I2 = 16 %). CONCLUSION: Appropriate and aggressive preventive measures should be implemented to reduce the risk of COVID-19 in patients with cancer and optimally manage those who contract the infection.","Lei, Haike; Yang, Yue; Zhou, Wei; Zhang, Mengyang; Shen, Yang; Tao, Dan; Wang, Lulu; Lei, Qianqian; Wang, Ying; Wu, Yongzhong",Lung Cancer,,498

Neutrophils that are attracted to the site of infection secrete IL-17A, which stimulates lung epithelial cells to express CCL20. Natural Th17 (nTh17) cells are recruited to the infection site by CCL20 and expand in the presence of IL-23. These nTh17 cells are converted to TRM cells upon encounter with SARS-CoV-2 and continue to exist as ex-Th17 cells, which exert Th1-like immunity during a memory response. G-CSF can induce nTh17 cell accumulation at the infection site because it promotes neutrophil egress from the bone marrow. Hence, G-CSF may be effective against COVID-19.

The COVID-19 pandemic has offered an opportunity to assess how well equipped the UK is to leverage health information technology and apply the principles of a national learning health and care system in response to a major public health shock. With the experience acquired during the pandemic, each country within the UK should now re-evaluate their digital health and care strategies. After leaving the EU, UK countries now need to decide to what extent they wish to engage with European efforts to promote interoperability between electronic health records. Major priorities for strengthening health information technology in the UK include achieving the optimal balance between top-down and bottom-up implementation, improving usability and interoperability, developing capacity for handling, processing, and analysing data, addressing privacy and security concerns, and encouraging digital inclusivity. Current and future opportunities include integrating electronic health records across health and care providers, investing in health data science research, generating real-world data, developing artificial intelligence and robotics, and facilitating public-private partnerships. Many ethical challenges and unintended consequences of implementation of health information technology exist. To address these, there is a need to develop regulatory frameworks for the development, management, and procurement of artificial intelligence and health information technology systems, create public-private partnerships, and ethically and safely apply artificial intelligence in the National Health Service.","Sheikh, Aziz; Anderson, Michael; Albala, Sarah; Casadei, Barbara; Franklin, Bryony Dean; Richards, Mike; Taylor, David; Tibble, Holly; Mossialos, Elias",Lancet Digit Health,,498

264804,Bloodstream infections in critically ill patients with COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: Gender and race are known to impact attitudes toward mental health topics and help-seeking behavior. Men and minorities are more likely to cite stigma as a reason for not seeking help for mental health concerns, which is of particular relevance given the high rate of suicide in men and challenges of historic proportion currently facing minority communities. Instagram provides a platform to discuss mental health, though a lack of male and minority representation may further alienate these populations. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate whether men and nonwhite individuals are underrepresented in Instagram photos tagged with #mentalhealth (compared to photos tagged with #health) to better understand how gender and race-based representations are manifested on this popular social media platform and discuss the implications. METHODS: Three investigators of different genders and racial backgrounds met on nine different days via teleconference to analyze a total of 215 publicly available Instagram photos tagged with #mentalhealth and 215 with #health. These photos were generated using Instagram's search function, and search results were sorted by most recently published at the time of data collection. For each photo, the three investigators recorded their observations about the gender (male versus female) and race (white versus nonwhite versus racially unclassifiable) of subjects featured in the photo, which they did not discuss with other investigators. Chi-squared analysis was performed on each investigator's data set to compare the frequency of male versus female and white versus nonwhite subjects identified in each hashtag category. Kappa interrater agreement was calculated for each investigator pair, category (gender or race), and hashtag. RESULTS: All three investigators observed significantly more female as compared to male subjects in photos tagged with #mentalhealth (X2=14.4, P<.001 for all investigators) while observing no significant difference between numbers of male and female subjects in photos tagged with #health (X2=1.533, P=.22; X2=1.241, P=.27; X2=0.096, P=.76). All three investigators identified significantly more white than nonwhite subjects in photos tagged with both #health and #mentalhealth (X2 values range from 11.912 to 98.927, P<.001 for all). Kappa interrater agreement revealed almost perfect agreement for gender (kappa=0.908-0.992) with the agreement for race ranging from 0.614 to 0.822, depending on hashtag and rater pair. CONCLUSIONS: Women are featured more frequently than men in Instagram photos tagged with #mentalhealth. The topic of #health, meanwhile, is not gendered this way. Low visibility of mental health among men may both represent and exacerbate existing stigma and barriers to care. White subjects are featured significantly more frequently than nonwhite subjects in photos tagged with both #mentalhealth and #health. Directed interventions using the Instagram platform may be indicated to increase the visibility of underrepresented groups and break the cycle of stigma.","Utter, Kierstin; Waineo, Eva; Bell, Capricia M; Quaal, Harrison L; Levine, Diane L",JMIR Ment Health,,498

Previous epidemic caused by the acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002 is also considered since both the coronaviruses resulted in the similar clinical complications. The outbreak caused by the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012 had a low rate of disease transmission and death cases. Modes of entry by MERS and SARS coronaviruses are similar to that of SARS-CoV-2, except MERS-CoV utilize different receptor. They all belong to the lineage C of ß-coronavirus. Based on the information from the previous reports, the present review is mainly focused on the mechanisms of disease progression by each of these viruses in association to their strategies to escape the host immunity. The viral entry is the first step of pathogenesis associated with attachment of viral spike protein with host receptor help releasing the viral RNA into the host cell. Models of molecular pathogenesis are outlined with virus strategies escaping the host immunity along with the role of various inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the process. The molecular aspects of pathogenesis have also been discussed.","Noor, Rashed",Arch. microbiol,,498

Audiovisual Quality Biases in the Virtual Residency Interview,2021,"BackgroundThere is uncertainty of the effect of immunosuppression, including corticosteroids, before COVID-19 infection on COVID-19 outcomes. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between prehospitalization immunosuppressants use (exposure), and COVID-19 patient outcomes. MethodsWe conducted a population-based retrospective cohort study using a nationwide healthcare claims database of South Korea as of May 15, 2020. Confirmed COVID-19 infection in hospitalized individuals aged 40 years or older were included for analysis. We defined exposure variable by using inpatient and outpatient prescription records of immunosuppressants from the database. Our primary outcome was a composite endpoint of all-cause death, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and mechanical ventilation use. Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW)-adjusted logistic regression analyses were used, to estimate odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals, comparing immunosuppressants users and non-users. FindingsWe identified 4,349 patients, for which 1,356 were immunosuppressants users and 2,903 were non-users. Patients who used immunosuppressants were at increased odds of the primary outcome of all-cause death, ICU admission and mechanical ventilation use (IPTW OR 1.32; 95% CI: 1.06 - 1.63). Patients who used corticosteroids were at increased odds of the primary outcome (IPTW OR 1.33; 95% CI: 1.07 - 1.64). InterpretationWe support the latest guidelines from the CDC, that people on immunosuppressants are at high risk of severe COVID-19 and immunocompromised people may need booster COVID-19 vaccinations.

We aimed at exploiting this effect by combining RNT with immunotherapy in a mouse model of prostate cancer (PC). Experimental Design: C57BL/6-mice bearing syngeneic RM1-PGLS tumors were treated with 225Ac-PSMA617, an anti-PD-1 antibody, or both. Therapeutic efficacy was assessed by tumor volume measurements (computed tomography), time to progression (TTP) and survival. Results: PSMA-RNT or anti-PD-1 alone tended to prolong TTP (isotype-control 25d; anti-PD-1 33.5d, p=0.0153; RNT 30d, p=0.1038) and survival (control 28d; anti-PD-1 37d, p=0.0098; RNT 32d, p=0.1018). Combining PSMA-RNT and anti-PD-1 significantly improved disease control compared to either monotherapy. TTP was extended to 47.5d (p<0.0199 vs. monotherapies), and survival to 51.5d (p<0.0251 vs. monotherapies). Conclusion : PSMA-RNT and PD-1 blockade synergistically improve therapeutic outcomes in our PC model, supporting the evaluation of RNT/immunotherapy combinations for PC patients.","Czernin, Johannes; Current, Kyle; Mona, Christine E; Nyiranshuti, Lea; Hikmat, Firas; Radu, Caius G; Lueckerath, Katharina",J. nucl. med,,498

Mapquesting the glaciers led to the discovery of concealed world of ""psychrophiles"" harboring in it. In the present study, the antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and heavy metal resistance genes (MRGs) were evaluated through both the culture-dependent and culture-independent methods. Samples were collected from two different glaciers, i.e., debris-covered glacier (Changme Khangpu) and debris-free glacier (Changme Khang). Functional metagenomics of both the glacier samples, provided evidence of presence of resistant genes against various antibiotic groups. Bacitracin resistant gene (bacA) was the predominant ARG in both the glaciers. MRGs in both the glacier samples were diversified as the genes detected were resistant against various heavy metals such as arsenic, tungsten, mercury, zinc, chromium, copper, cobalt, and iron. Unique MRGs identified from Changme Khangpu glacier were resistant to copper (cutA, cutE, cutC, cutF, cueR, copC, and copB) and chromium (yelf, ruvB, nfsA, chrR, and chrA) whereas, from Changme Khang glacier they showed resistance against cobalt (mgtA, dmef, corD, corC, corB, and cnrA), and iron (yefD, yefC, yefB, and yefA) heavy metals. ARGs aligned maximum identity with Gram-negative psychrotolerant bacteria. The cultured bacterial isolates showed tolerance to high concentrations of tested heavy metal solutions. Interestingly, some of the antibiotic resistant bacterial isolates also showed tolerance towards the higher concentrations of heavy metals. Thus, an introspection of the hypothesis of co-occurrence and/co-selection of ARGs and MRGs in such environments has been highlighted here.","Sherpa, Mingma Thundu; Najar, Ishfaq Nabi; Das, Sayak; Thakur, Nagendra",Ecotoxicol Environ Saf,,498

270032,Parking Places to Moped-Style Scooter Sharing Services Using GIS Location-Allocation Models and GPS Data,2021,"The present study aims to examine the changes in air quality during different phases of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the lockdown (LD1-4) and unlock period (UL1-2) (post-lockdown) as compared to pre-lockdown (PL1-3) and to establish the relationships of the environmental and demographic variables with COVID-19 cases in the state of Maharashtra, the worst-hit state in India. Atmospheric pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10, NOx, and CO were substantially reduced during the lockdown and unlock phases with the greatest reduction in cities having larger traffic volumes. Compared with the immediate pre-lockdown period (PL3), the averaged PM2.5 and PM10 reduced by up to 51% and 47% respectively during the lockdown periods, which resulted in 'satisfactory' level of air quality index (AQI) as a result of reduced vehicular traffic and industrial closing. These parameters continued to reduce as much as 80% during the unlock periods due to the additive impact of weather (rainfall and temperature) combined with the lockdown conditions. Kendall's correlation matrix showed a significant negative correlation between temperature and air pollutants (r= - 0.35 to - 057). Conversely, SO2 and O3 did not improve, and in some cases, they increased during the lockdown and unlocking. COVID-19 spreading incidences were strongly and positively correlated with temperature (r < 0.62) and dew point (r < 0.73). Thus, this indicates that the increase in temperature and dew point cannot weaken the transmission of this virus. The number of COVID-19 cases relative to air pollutants was negatively correlated (r = - 0.33 to - 0.74), which may be a mere coincidence as a result of lockdown. However, based on pre-lockdown air quality data and demographic factors, it was found that particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) and population density are closely linked with higher morbidity and mortality although a more in-depth research is required in this direction to validate this finding. The onset of COVID-19 has allowed us to determine that 'immediate' changes in air quality within densely populated/industrialized areas can improve livelihood based on pollution mitigation. These findings could be used by policymakers to set new benchmarks for air pollution that would improve the quality of life for major sectors of the World's population. COVID-19 has shown us that we can make changes when necessary, and findings may pave the way for future research to inform policy on the tough choices we will have to make between quality of life and survival. Also, our results will enrich the ongoing discussion on the role of environmental factors on the transmission of COVID-19 and will help to take necessary steps for its control.","Sahoo, Prafulla Kumar; Mangla, Sherry; Pathak, Ashok Kumar; Salãmao, Gabriel Negreiros; Sarkar, Dibyendu",Int. j. biometeorol,,498

270539,Be coherent and become heard: The multidimensional impact of narrative coherence on listeners' social responses,2020,"This paper presents a SEIAR-type model considering quarantined individuals (Q), called SQEIAR model. The dynamic of SQEIAR model is defined by six ordinary differential equations that describe the numbers of Susceptible, Quarantined, Exposed, Infected, Asymptomatic, and Recovered individuals. The goal of this paper is to reduce the size of susceptible, infected, exposed and asymptomatic groups to consequently eradicate the infection by using two actions: the quarantine and the treatment of infected people. To reach this purpose, optimal control theory is presented to control the epidemic model over free terminal optimal time control with an optimal cost. Pontryagin's maximum principle is used to characterize the optimal controls and the optimal final time. Also, an impulsive epidemic model of SQEIAR is considered to deal with the potential suddenly increased in population caused by immigration or travel. Since this model is suitable to describe the COVID-19 pandemic, especial attention is devoted to this case. Thus, numerical simulations are given to prove the accuracy of the theoretical claims and applied to the particular data of this infection. Moreover, numerical computations of the COVID-19 are compared with diseases like Ebola and Influenza. In addition, the controller is evaluated with system parameters identified by using actual data of China. Finally, the controller tuned with the estimated parameters of the Chinese data is applied to the actual data of Spain to compare the quarantine and treatment policies in both countries.","Abbasi, Zohreh; Zamani, Iman; Mehra, Amir Hossein Amiri; Shafieirad, Mohsen; Ibeas, Asier",Chaos Solitons Fractals,,498

272404,The nCOVID-19 and financial stress in the USA: health is wealth,2020,"BACKGROUND: Most research focuses on the impact of COVID-19 for the general population. People with mental health problems may suffer even more from its consequences. AIM: Measuring mental health, experiences with outpatient care and government measures of 105 people in mental health care in the Northern Netherlands during the first wave of COVID-19. METHOD: Anonymous, online survey among people in care with autism- or FACT-teams in the Northern Netherlands between July-September 2020. RESULTS: Few participants reported recent COVID-19-related symptoms (n=2);no participant had lab-confirmed COVID-19. Both positive (clear world, tranquility, few stimuli: 28%) and negative experiences (missing face-to-face contact with mental health care professionals: 22%) were reported. Although there was some fluctuation in happiness, the average happiness score did not change due to the first wave. Three-quarters were satisfied with their mental health care. Although in-person contact with mental health care professionals was missed, the continuation of care through (video)calling was appreciated. One third reported an increased or new care need in mental health symptoms or daily functioning. The 'physical' government measures were considered pleasant and doable, but 'social' measures were harder. Newsletters with practical information about the consequences of the measures for personal healthcare were appreciated. CONCLUSION: The results show a nuanced picture of how outpatients experienced the first wave of COVID-19. Continued monitoring is important, as long-term impact of COVID-19 cannot be predicted.","Castelein, S.; Bruins, J.; van Balkom, I. D. C.",Tijdschrift voor Psychiatrie,,498

METHODS: We evaluated these characteristics and established their association with clinical severity in a prospective observational cohort study of 100 patients with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (mean age 46 years, 56% male, 38% with comorbidities). Respiratory samples (n=74) were collected for viral culture, serum samples for measurement of IgM/IgG levels (n=30), and plasma samples for levels of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (n=81). Disease severity was correlated with results from viral culture, serologic testing, and immune markers. RESULTS: 57 (57%) patients developed viral pneumonia, of whom 20 (20%) required supplemental oxygen including 12 (12%) invasive mechanical ventilation. Viral culture from respiratory samples was positive for 19 of 74 patients (26%). No virus was isolated when the PCR cycle threshold (Ct) value was >30 or >14 days after symptom onset. Seroconversion occurred at a median of 12.5 days (IQR 9-18) for IgM and 15.0 days (IQR 12-20) for IgG; 54/62 patients (87.1%) sampled at day 14 or later seroconverted. Severe infections were associated with earlier seroconversion and higher peak IgM and IgG levels. Levels of IP-10, HGF, IL-6, MCP-1, MIP-1&#945;, IL-12p70, IL-18, VEGF-A, PDGF-BB and IL-1RA significantly correlated with disease severity. CONCLUSION: We found virus viability was associated with lower PCR Ct value in early illness. A stronger antibody response was associated with disease severity. The overactive proinflammatory immune signatures offers targets for host-directed immunotherapy which should be evaluated in randomised controlled trials.","Young, Barnaby E; Ong, Sean W X; Ng, Lisa F P; Anderson, Danielle E; Chia, Wan Ni; Chia, Po Ying; Ang, Li Wei; Mak, Tze-Minn; Kalimuddin, Shirin; Chai, Louis Yi Ann; Pada, Surinder; Tan, Seow Yen; Sun, Louisa; Parthasarathy, Purnima; Fong, Siew-Wai; Chan, Yi-Hao; Tan, Chee Wah; Lee, Bernett; Rötzschke, Olaf; Ding, Ying; Tambyah, Paul; Low, Jenny G H; Cui, Lin; Barkham, Timothy; Lin, Raymond Tzer Pin; Leo, Yee-Sin; Renia, Laurent; Wang, Lin-Fa; Lye, David Chien",Clin. infect. dis,,498

Results show that about 88% of students experienced moderate to severe stress, with 44% of students showing moderate to severe anxiety and 36% of students having moderate to severe depression. In particular, female, rural, low-income, and academically underperforming students were more vulnerable to these mental health issues. However, a majority of students with moderate or severe mental health symptoms never used mental health services.

276657,COVID-19 pandemic: stringent measures of Malaysia and implications for other countries,2020,"BACKGROUND: Gender and fertility variation have an impact on mating dynamics in a population because they affect the gene exchange among parental members and the genetic composition of the resultant seed crops. Fertility is the proportional gametic contribution of parents to their progeny. An effective number of parents, derivative of effective population size, is the probability that two alleles randomly chosen from the gamete gene pool originated from the same parent. The effective number of parents is directly related to the fertility variation among parents, which should be monitored for manipulating gene diversity of seed crops. We formulated a fundamental equation of estimating the effective number of parents and applied it to a seed production population. RESULTS: Effective number of parents (Np) was derived from fertility variation (&#936;) considering covariance (correlation coefficient, r) between maternal and paternal fertility. The &#936; was calculated from the coefficient of variation in reproductive outputs and divided into female (&#968;f) and male (&#968;m) fertility variation in the population under study. The Np was estimated from the parental &#936; estimated by the fertility variation of maternal (&#968;f) and paternal (&#968;m) parents. The gene diversity of seed crops was monitored by &#936; and Np. in a 1.5 generation Pinus koraiensis seed orchard as a case of monoecious species. A large variation of female and male strobili production was observed among the studied 52 parents over four consecutive years, showing statistically significant differences across all studied years. Parental balance curve showed greater distortion in paternal than maternal parents. The &#936; ranged from 1.879 to 4.035 with greater &#968;m than &#968;f, and the Np varied from 14.8 to 36.8. When pooled, the relative effective number of parents was improved as 80.0% of the census number. CONCLUSIONS: We recommend the use of fertility variation (i.e., CV, &#936;), Person's product-moment correlation (r), and effective number of parents (Np) as tools for gauging gene diversity of seed crops in production populations. For increasing Np and gene diversity, additional management options such as mixing seed-lots, equal cone harvest and application of supplemental-mass-pollination are recommended.","Park, Ji-Min; Kang, Hye-In; Yeom, Da-Bin; Kang, Kyu-Suk; El-Kassaby, Yousry A; Lee, Kyung-Mi",BMC Plant Biol,,498

We explored the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cardiac operations and interventions undertaken in England. METHODS AND RESULTS: An administrative database covering hospital activity for England, the Health Episodes Statistics, was used to assess a total of 286 697 hospitalizations for cardiac operations and interventions, as well as 227 257 hospitalizations for myocardial infarction (MI) and 453 799 for heart failure (HF) from 7 January 2019 to 26 July 2020. Over the 3 months of 'lockdown', total numbers and mean reductions in weekly rates [n (-%)], compared with the same time period in 2019, were: coronary artery bypass grafting [-2507 (-64%)]; percutaneous coronary intervention [-5245 (-28%)]; surgical [-1324 (-41%)] and transcatheter [-284 (-21%)] aortic valve replacement; mitral valve replacement; implantation of pacemakers [-6450 (-44%)], cardiac resynchronization therapy with [-356 (-42%)] or without [-491 (-46%)] defibrillation devices, and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators [-501 (-45%)]; atrial fibrillation ablation [-1902 (-83%)], and other ablations [-1712 (-64%)] (all P < 0.001). Over this period, there were 21 038 fewer procedures than in the reference period in 2019 (P < 0.001). These changes paralleled reductions in hospitalizations for MI [-10 794 (-27%)] and HF [-63 058 (-28%)] (both P < 0.001).

To evaluate the possibility of identifying antibodies with broad neutralizing activity, we isolated a monoclonal antibody, termed B6, that cross-reacts with eight ß-coronavirus spike glycoproteins, including all five human-infecting ß-coronaviruses. B6 broadly neutralizes entry of pseudotyped viruses from lineages A and C, but not from lineage B, and the latter includes SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Cryo-EM, X-ray crystallography and membrane fusion assays reveal that B6 binds to a conserved cryptic epitope located in the fusion machinery. The data indicate that antibody binding sterically interferes with the spike conformational changes leading to membrane fusion. Our data provide a structural framework explaining B6 cross-reactivity with ß-coronaviruses from three lineages, along with a proof of concept for antibody-mediated broad coronavirus neutralization elicited through vaccination.

284189,COVID-19 Front Line - Why Focused Lung and Cardiovascular Ultrasound?,2020,"The novel coronavirus, named SARS-Cov-2, has raged in mainland China for more than three months, and it causes a huge threat to people's health and economic development. In order to curb the SARS-Cov-2 prevalence, the Chinese government enacted a series of containment strategies including household quarantine, traffic restriction, city lockdowns etc. Indeed, the pandemic has been effectively mitigated, but the global transmission is not still optimistic. Evaluating such control measures in detail plays an important role in limiting SARS-Cov-2 spread for public health decision and policymakers. In this paper, based on the cumulative numbers of confirmed cases and deaths of SARS-Cov-2 infection, from January 31st to March 31st, announced by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China, we established a mean-field model, considering the substantial contact change under some restrictive measures, to study the dynamics of SARS-Cov-2 infection in mainland China. By the Metropolis-Hastings (M-H) algorithm of Markov Chain Monte Carlo numerical method, our model provided a good fitting to the overall trends of SARS-Cov-2 infections and discovers the transmission heterogeneities by some extreme containment strategies to some extent. The basic reproduction number was approximated to be 2.05 (95% CI [1.35,2.87]); the hospitalized cases arrived at the peak of 29766 (95% CI [29743,29868]) on February 7th (95% CI [Feb.6th, Feb.8th]). Importantly, we identified that the highest risk group of SARS-Cov-2 was the family of four, which has the biggest probability of degree distributions at such node, suggesting that contact patterns play an important role in curtailing the disease spread.","Yang, Jun Yuan; Wang, Guo Qiang; Zhang, Shuo",Math Biosci Eng,,498

We show that the COVID-19 epidemic curves not only may present a subexponential early growth but can also exhibit a similar subexponential (power-law) behaviour in the saturation regime. We argue that the power-law exponent of the latter regime, which measures how quickly the curve approaches the plateau, is directly related to control measures, in the sense that the less strict the control, the smaller the exponent and hence the slower the diseases progresses to its end. The power-law saturation uncovered here is an important result, because it signals to policymakers and health authorities that it is important to keep control measures for as long as possible, so as to avoid a slow, power-law ending of the disease. The slower the approach to the plateau, the longer the virus lingers on in the population, and the greater not only the final death toll but also the risk of a resurgence of infections.","Vasconcelos, Giovani L; Macêdo, Antônio M S; Duarte-Filho, Gerson C; Brum, Arthur A; Ospina, Raydonal; Almeida, Francisco A G",Sci Rep,,498

Using data through April 20, 2020, we fit a statistical model to COVID-19 case fatality rates over time at the US county level to estimate the COVID-19 IFR among symptomatic cases (IFR-S) as time goes to infinity. The IFR-S in the US was estimated to be 1.3% (95% central credible interval: 0.6% to 2.1%). County-specific rates varied from 0.5% to 3.6%. The overall IFR for COVID-19 should be lower when we account for cases that remain and recover without symptoms. When used with other estimating approaches, our model and our estimates can help disease and policy modelers to obtain more accurate predictions for the epidemiology of the disease and the impact of alternative policy levers to contain this pandemic. The model could also be used with future epidemics to get an early sense of the magnitude of symptomatic infection at the population-level before more direct estimates are available. Substantial variation across patient demographics likely exists and should be the focus of future studies.

284999,Changes and Adaptations: How University Students Self-Regulate Their Online Learning During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"This article examines payer-provider partnerships in social determinants of health (SDoH) interventions, identifies important factors for an approach centered around return on investment (ROI) using integrated delivery and finance systems as case studies, and advocates for increased collaboration between payers and providers when addressing SDoH. Despite the numerous examples where payers and providers have attempted to independently address SDoH, there is limited evidence for the success of these interventions. Since most stakeholders individually do not have access to financial and clinical data, identifying an ROI for SDoH interventions is logistically challenging, but even when these data are available, stakeholders may not want to share their learnings due to negative findings and/or unwillingness to share proprietary information. These issues are further amplified by the effects of COVID-19 and its worsening effect on widening health disparities, but many payers and providers have risen to the challenge together. This article advocates for the importance of payer-provider partnerships to address SDoH and uses examples of integrated delivery and finance systems as case studies of how these partnerships could function.

To be able to uncover reliable and valid findings, more robust panel estimation methods were employed for the study. From the heterogeneity and cross-sectional dependence tests, the study's panels were heterogeneous and cross-sectionally dependent. Also, all the series were non-stationary at levels, but gained stationarity after first difference. Further, the Fisher test and the Westerlund and Edgerton bootstrap test found the variables to be cointegrated in the long run. The CCEMG and the DCCEMG estimators were used to explore the long-run equilibrium relationship amid the series, and from the results of the whole sample, CO2 emissions and renewable energy consumption (REC) had no vital influence on economic growth (GDP) in both estimators. However, the results were a bit different in the sub-panels. Also from the whole sample, control variables urbanization (URB) and population growth (POP) had no material effect on GDP in both estimators. The results were, however, dissimilar in the sub-panels. Finally, the Dumitrescu-Hurlin test was employed to examine the causalities amid the series, and the results were diverse in the various panels.

The patient's symptoms commenced on May 27, and a sibling (patient B) of the patient experienced symptom onset the following day. On May 23, both patients had driven together and spent time in a retail store in Flagstaff, Arizona. Because of their similar exposures, symptom onset dates, and overlapping close contacts, these patients are referred to as co-index patients. The co-index patients had a total of 58 primary (i.e., direct) and secondary contacts (i.e., contacts of a primary contact); among these, 27 (47%) received positive SARS-CoV-2 test results. Four (15%) of the 27 contacts who became ill were household members of co-index patient B, 14 (52%) had attended family gatherings, one was a child who might have transmitted SARS-CoV-2 to six contacts, and eight (30%) were community members. Findings from the outbreak investigation prompted the HHCC and Hopi Tribe leadership to strengthen community education through community health representatives, public health nurses, and radio campaigns.

The liberty to express your thoughts without passing through any credibility check is leading to dissemination of fake content in the ecosystem. It can have disastrous effects on both individuals and society as a whole. The amplification of fake news is becoming rampant in India too. Debunked information often gets republished with a replacement description, claiming it to depict some different incidence. To curb such fabricated stories, it is necessary to investigate such deduplicates and false claims made in public. The majority of studies on automatic fact-checking and fake news detection is restricted to English only. But for a country like India where only 10% of the literate population speak English, role of regional languages in spreading falsity cannot be undermined. In this paper, we introduce FactDRIL: the first large scale multilingual Fact-checking Dataset for Regional Indian Languages. We collect an exhaustive dataset across 7 months covering 11 low-resource languages. Our propose dataset consists of 9,058 samples belonging to English, 5,155 samples to Hindi and remaining 8,222 samples are distributed across various regional languages, i.e. Bangla, Marathi, Malayalam, Telugu, Tamil, Oriya, Assamese, Punjabi, Urdu, Sinhala and Burmese. We also present the detailed characterization of three M's (multi-lingual, multi-media, multi-domain) in the FactDRIL accompanied with the complete list of other varied attributes making it a unique dataset to study. Lastly, we present some potential use cases of the dataset.

Invulnerability is the fundamental choice to prevent the ruining event of COVID-19, as the drugs and antibodies are in the phase of preliminary clinical trials. Within this brief period, a few strains of SARS-CoV-2 have been recognized by the vaccine manufacturers, which could be an incorrect guess about the strain that will end up spreading. Since the circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains continue to mutate, immunizations, if at all works, might be for a restricted time. We have not put sufficient time in research to understand the immune responses that correlate with protection as this could help refine vaccines. Here, we have summed up the adequacy of the immunomodulatory component of probiotics for the prevention against viral infections. Furthermore, an in silico data have been provided in support of the ""probiotics-derived lipopeptides"" role in inactivating spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 and its host receptor molecule, ACE2. Among well characterized lipopeptides derived from different probiotic strains, subtilisin (Bacillus amyloliquefaciens), curvacin A (Lactobacillus curvatus), sakacin P (Lactobacillus sakei), lactococcin Gb (Lactococcus lactis) was utilized in this study to demonstrate a higher binding proclivity to S-protein of SARS-CoV-2 and human ACE2. The outcome revealed noteworthy capabilities of the lipopeptides, due to their amphiphilic nature, to bind spike protein and receptor molecule, which may act to competitively inhibit the mandatory interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with the host epithelial cell expressing ACE2 for its entry into the cell for reproduction. In the current situation, probiotic treatment alongside chemotherapy may assist in bringing about substantial improvement of the health of COVID-19 patients. At the same time, probiotics may aid towards building up the immune defenses in people to evade COVID-19.","Manna, Sounik; Chowdhury, Trinath; Chakraborty, Ranadhir; Mandal, Santi M",Probiot. antimicrob. proteins (Internet),,498

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a comprehensive literature search from several databases. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed in abstracting data and assessing validity. Quality assessment was performed using the Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment scale (NOS). D-dimer levels were pooled and compared between severe/non-severe and surviving/non-surviving patient groups. Weighted mean difference (WMD), risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were analyzed. RESULTS: Thirty-nine studies reported on D-dimer levels in 5750 non-severe and 2063 severe patients and 16 studies reported on D-dimer levels in 2783 surviving and 697 non-surviving cases. D-dimer levels were significantly higher in patients with severe clinical status (WMD: 0.45 mg/L, 95% CI: 0.34-0.56; p < 0.0001). Non-surviving patients had significantly higher D-dimer levels compared to surviving patients (WMD: 5.32 mg/L, 95% CI: 3.90-6.73; p < 0.0001). D-dimer levels above the upper limit of normal (ULN) was associated with higher risk of severity (RR: 1.58, 95% CI: 1.25-2.00; p < 0.0001) and mortality (RR: 1.82, 95% CI: 1.40-2.37; p < 0.0001).

Dentre os marcadores imunohistoquímicos utilizados para prognóstico destaca-se o receptor do fator de crescimento epidérmico humano tipo 2 (Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor type 2 Her-2) que em mulheres está associado a um pior prognóstico. Objetivou-se avaliar a expressão de Her-2 em hiperplasias e neoplasias mamárias, benignas e malignas, de gatas e relacionar a expressão ao tipo e grau histológico dos carcinomas mamários. Foram selecionados 38 casos de neoplasias e hiperplasias mamárias de gatas, no período de 2006 a 2016. A partir dos protocolos selecionados obteve-se informações epidemiológicas e características macroscópicas das lesões nas mamas. Os tumores foram individualmente classificados e graduados histologicamente por dois patologistas. A expressão de Her-2 foi determinada por imunohistoquímica, por meio de análise semi quantitativa das lâminas conforme escore recomendado pelo Herceptest (Dako). Utilizou-se Teste Qui-quadrado (2) para avaliação da relação entre expressão de Her-2 e tipo de lesão mamária, tipos histológicos de carcinoma e grau histológico (P<0,05). A idade média dos animais foi de 8,5 anos e as gatas jovens foram acometidas somente por hiperplasias e neoplasias benignas. Gatas sem raça definida foram mais acometidas (84,37%), seguida por siamês (9,37%) e persa (6,25%). Quanto à classificação histológica, 18,42% das lesões mamárias foram classificadas como hiperplasia, 18,42% como adenoma e 63,16% foram classificadas como carcinoma. O tipo de carcinoma mais comum foi o carcinoma tubulopapilar (66,7%), seguido por carcinoma sólido (25%) e carcinoma cribriforme (8,33%). Observou-se superexpressão de Her-2 em 4 amostras (16,7%) de carcinoma do tipo tubulopapilar, sendo dois carcinomas grau I e dois graduação II, todavia não houve relação entre a expressão de Her-2 e o tipo de lesão mamária (p=0,3127), tipo de carcinoma (0,3467) ou grau histológico (0,6485).

Also, it aimed at ascertaining, for the first time, the effect of changes in climatic conditions (spring versus summer) on the aforementioned steroids, testicular volume, testicular echotexture (pixel intensity; PI, and integrated density; ID), and semen quality in goats. Saliva and plasma samples were collected from 7 male Shiba goats weekly in spring and summer for measurement of testosterone (T; ng/ml), estradiol (E2; pg/ml), and cortisol (ng/ml) using radioimmunoassay. The changes in testicular volumes (TV/ml) and echogenicity were monitored weekly using ultrasonographic assessments concomitantly with subjective evaluations of semen parameters. Results revealed a highly significant positive correlation (r = 0.72; P < 0.0001) between plasma and salivary cortisol. Mild significant positive correlation was found between salivary and plasma T levels (r = 0.31; P < 0.002). However, low non-significant negative correlation was reported between salivary and plasma E2 levels (r = -0.24; P > 0.05). Higher levels of salivary cortisol were found in summer than in the spring (3.8 ± 0.6 ng/ml versus 1.4 ± 0.3 ng/ml; P < 0.001). However, no differences in levels of T, E2, and plasma cortisol were recorded between spring and summer (P > 0.05). Values of testicular PI and ID were significantly (P < 0.001) higher in the summer (94.5 ± 4.9, 258,388 ± 13,190, respectively) than in the spring (74.0 ± 2.1, 200,922 ± 5704, respectively). Meanwhile, TV and semen parameters did not significantly differ between spring and summer. In conclusion, saliva can be considered as an alternative biological fluid for the measurement of cortisol and T, but not suitable for E2. Climatic conditions significantly impact the levels of cortisol in saliva and testicular echogenicity in goats.","Samir, Haney; Nyametease, Paul; Elbadawy, Mohamed; Fathi, Mohamed; Mandour, Ahmed S; Radwan, Faten; Nagaoka, Kentaro; Sasaki, Kazuaki; Watanabe, Gen",Theriogenology,,498

294854,"Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Micro, Small, and Medium-Sized Enterprises operating in Pakistan",2020,"SARS2-CoV-2 breakout in Italy caused a huge number of severely ill patients with a serious increase in mortality. Although lungs seem to be the main target of the infection, very few information are available about liver involvement, possibly evocating a systemic disease. Post-mortem wedge liver biopsies from 48 patients died from severe pulmonary COVID-19 disease with respiratory failure were collected from two main hospitals in northern Italy. No patient had clinical symptoms of liver disease or signs of liver failure before and during hospitalization; for each of them liver function tests were available. All liver samples showed minimal inflammation features. Histological pictures compatible with vascular alterations were observed, characterized by increase in number of portal vein branches associated with lumen massive dilatation, partial or complete luminal thrombosis of portal and sinusoidal vessels, fibrosis of portal tract, focally markedly enlarged and fibrotic. SARS-CoV-2 was found in 15 of 22 samples tested by in situ hybridization method. Our preliminary results confirm the clinical impression that liver failure is not a main concern and this organ is not the target of significant inflammatory damage. Histopathological findings are highly suggestive for marked derangement of intrahepatic blood vessel network secondary to systemic changes induced by virus that could target not only lung parenchyma but also cardiovascular system, coagulation cascade and endothelial layer of blood vessels. It still remains unclear if the mentioned changes are directly related to virus infection or if SARS-CoV-2 triggers a series of reactions leading to striking vascular alterations.","Sonzogni, Aurelio; Previtali, Giulia; Seghezzi, Michela; Grazia Alessio, Maria; Gianatti, Andrea; Licini, Lisa; Morotti, Denise; Zerbi, Pietro; Carsana, Luca; Rossi, Roberta; Lauri, Eleonora; Pellegrinelli, Alessandro; Nebuloni, Manuela",Liver Int,,498
294925,Surgical results of remnant gastric cancer treatment,2020,"BACKGROUND: At present, the Americas report the largest number of cases of COVID-19 worldwide. In this region, Mexico is the third country with most deaths (20,781 total deaths). A sum that may be explained by the high proportion of people over 50 and the high rate of chronic diseases. The aim of this analysis is to investigate the risk factors associated with COVID-19 deaths in Mexican population using survival analysis. METHODS: Our analysis includes all confirmed COVID-19 cases contained in the dataset published by the Epidemiological Surveillance System for Viral Respiratory Diseases of the Mexican Ministry of Health. We applied survival analysis to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on the Mexican population. From this analysis, we plotted Kaplan-Meier curves, and constructed a Cox proportional hazard model. RESULTS: The analysis included the register of 16,752 confirmed cases of COVID-19 with mean age 46.55 ± 15.55 years; 58.02% (n = 9719) men, and 9.37% (n = 1569) deaths. Male sex, older age, chronic kidney disease, pneumonia, hospitalization, intensive care unit admission, intubation, and health care in public health services, were independent factors increasing the risk of death due to COVID-19 (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The risk of dying at any time during follow-up was clearly higher for men, individuals in older age groups, people with chronic kidney disease, and people hospitalized in public health services.","Salinas-Escudero, Guillermo; Carrillo-Vega, María Fernanda; Granados-García, Víctor; Martínez-Valverde, Silvia; Toledano-Toledano, Filiberto; Garduño-Espinosa, Juan",BMC Public Health,,498
295071,EU Jobs at Highest Risk of Covid-19 Social Distancing: Will the Pandemic Exacerbate Labour Market Divide?,2020,"BACKGROUND: School closure created difficulties for parents, who were asked to care for their children and help them with schooling, while working at home. We aimed to explore the experiences in organising school for children at home and its implications on children's psychological well-being and educational progress during the quarantine for the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A nationwide online survey of mothers of primary and middle school students was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic. Demographic data and information on distance learning organisation and children's attitudes and behavioural changes were collected. RESULTS: 2149 mothers completed the survey, with a final sample of 1601 subjects. Large differences between primary and middle school emerged: lessons were less organised and routines were more instable for the youngest, who could not pay attention for more than 20 min (28.3%) and needed breaks every 10 min (21.6%), with lower quality of learning (40.6%), increased restlessness (69.1%), and aggressiveness (33.3%). A large use of screens was reported, with an abuse in screen time in 2%. Two thirds of mothers did not approve of distance learning (72.2%) because of their role in replacing teachers (77.8%), the effort required (66%), and the great commitment required (78.3%). CONCLUSIONS: Distance learning increased educational deprivation and social inequalities, especially for the youngest children, who lost almost one year of school. The situation was even worse for children with disabilities, who were neglected by the institutions. This period should be considered as an opportunity to correct the weaknesses of our school system.","Scarpellini, Francesca; Segre, Giulia; Cartabia, Massimo; Zanetti, Michele; Campi, Rita; Clavenna, Antonio; Bonati, Maurizio",BMC Public Health,,498

295458,"Breast imaging hindered during covid-19 pandemic, in Brazil",2021,"INTRODUCTION: Squamous carcinoma is a very rare breast cancer resulting from a differentiated squamous metaplasia. Its diagnosis is late due to the absence of specific clinical and radiological features. PRESENTATION OF CASE: The authors present the case of a 39-year-old patient with the clinical onset of an inflammatory cyst diagnosed with mammography and cytological examination. After segmentectomy, on histological examination was defined as: ""squamous keratinizing aspect"". In light of this report she was subjected to quadrantectomy with lymphadenectomy. She did not undergo radiotherapy treatment, which was delayed due to the ongoing pandemic. After a few months developed a local recurrence and underwent a mastectomy with multidisciplinary treatment. DISCUSSION: Squamously-differentiated metaplastic carcinoma of the breast is one of the rarest forms of breast cancer. Its etiopathogenesis is still unclear but some authors suggest that it originates from a squamous metaplasia deriving from the epithelium of cysts. This is a very aggressive and fast-growing tumour especially in young women, in fact the patient had a recurrence after a few months. She came to our attention 6 months after the initial surgery with a relapse at a local-regional level for which she was subjected to radical treatment and with a metastatic spread for which she was given the first-line chemotherapy treatment. CONCLUSION: There are no well-defined guidelines for the treatment of this rare form of cancer. The case illustrates how the rapid aggressiveness of the disease requires adequate and immediate multidisciplinary treatment from the very beginning.","Tomasicchio, G; Rizzi, A; Stucci, L S; Moschetta, M; Giliberti, G; Punzo, C",Int J Surg Case Rep,,498

296291,Perspectives on Research Internships for Medical Students and Young Doctors in Ghana: An Opportunity to Replenish the Stock of Physician Investigators?,2020,"This study aimed to monitor severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral loads and specific serum-antibodies (immunoglobulin [Ig] G and M) among confirmed patients and asymptomatic carriers from returning healthy travelers. The throat swabs, sputum, and stool samples from 57 hospitalized coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patients and 8 asymptomatic carriers, among 170 returning healthy travelers were tested using reverse-transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction. SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG antibodies were detected via serum chemiluminescence assay. Sequential results showed higher viral RNA loads in the throat, sputum, and stool samples at 3-12 and 6-21 days after symptom onset among severely ill COVID-19 patients. Shorter viral habitation time (1-8 days) was observed in the oropharyngeal site and intestinal tract of asymptomatic carriers. The IgG and IgM response rates were 19/37 (51.4%) and 23/37 (62.6%) among the 29 confirmed patients and 8 asymptomatic carriers, respectively, within 66 days from symptom or detection onset. The median duration between symptom onset and positive IgG and IgM results was 30 (n=23; interquartile range [IQR]=20-66) and 23 (n=19; IQR=12-28) days, respectively. Of 170 returning healthy-travelers to China, 4.7% were asymptomatic carriers (8/170) within 2 weeks, and the IgG and IgM positivity rate was 12.8% (12/94). IgM/IgG-positivity confirmed 3 suspected SARS-CoV-2 cases, despite negative results for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Compared with other respiratory viral infectious diseases, COVID-19 has fewer asymptomatic carriers, lower antibody response rates, and a longer antibody production duration in recovered patients and the contacted healthy population. This is an indication of the complexity of COVID-19 transmission.","Yuan, Youhua; Wang, Huiling; Zhao, Jing; Jing, Nan; Xu, Junhong; Li, Wei; Ma, Bing; Zhang, Jiangfeng; Li, Gang; Wang, Shanmei; Li, Yi; Wang, Yuming; Fan, Enguo; Li, Li",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,,498
296381,The effect of COVID-19 pandemic on domestic tourism: A DEMATEL method analysis on quarantine decisions,2021,"Each year in Latin America and the Caribbean, seasonal influenza is associated with an estimated 36,500 respiratory deaths and 400,000 hospitalizations. Since the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic, the Region has made significant advances in the prevention and control of seasonal influenza, including improved surveillance systems, burden estimates, and vaccination of at-risk groups. The Global Influenza Strategy 2019-2030 provides a framework to strengthen these advances. Against the backdrop of this new framework, the University of Colorado convened in October 2020 its Immunization Advisory Group of Experts to review and discuss current surveillance, prevention, and control strategies for seasonal influenza in Latin America and the Caribbean, also in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. This review identified five areas for action and made recommendations specific to each area. The Region should continue its efforts to strengthen surveillance and impact evaluations. Existing data on disease burden, seasonality patterns, and vaccination effectiveness should be used to inform decision-making at the country level as well as advocacy efforts for programmatic resources. Regional and country strategic plans should be prepared and include specific targets for 2030. Existing investments in influenza prevention and control, including for immunization programs, should be optimized. Finally, regional partnerships, such as the regional networks for syndromic surveillance and vaccine effectiveness evaluation (SARInet and REVELAC-i), should continue to play a critical role in continuous learning and standardization by sharing experiences and best practices among countries.","Vicari, Andrea S; Olson, Daniel; Vilajeliu, Alba; Andrus, Jon K; Ropero, Alba Maria; Morens, David M; Santos, Ignacio José; Azziz-Baumgartner, Eduardo; Berman, Stephen",Am. j. trop. med. hyg,,498

The neuroprotective effects of natural compounds have been reported in several neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD) amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), cerebral ischemia and brain tumors. Flavonoids are the most widely studied natural products for the prevention and treatment of neurodegenerative disorders. The nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) represents a complex gene regulated cytoprotective pathway. Several natural compounds have been identified as Nrf2 regulators in various chronic disorders, including carcinogenic, liver ailments, inflammatory conditions, neurodegeneration, diabetes and cardiotoxicities. The current review focuses on Nrf2 targeting by flavonoids in the prevention and treatment of neurodegenerative disorders, addressing the most contemporary information available on this timely subject.","Khan, Haroon; Tundis, Rosa; Ullah, Hammad; Aschner, Michael; Belwal, Tarun; Mirzaei, Hamed; Akkol, Esra Kupeli",Food Chem Toxicol,,498

301294,How could we improve the national projects in health and demography after coronavirus pandemic?,2020,"OBJECTIVES: To estimate COVID-19 infections and deaths in healthcare workers (HCWs) from a global perspective during the early phases of the pandemic. DESIGN: Systematic review. METHODS: Two parallel searches of academic bibliographic databases and grey literature were undertaken until 8 May 2020. Governments were also contacted for further information where possible. There were no restrictions on language, information sources used, publication status and types of sources of evidence. The AACODS checklist or the National Institutes of Health study quality assessment tools were used to appraise each source of evidence. OUTCOME MEASURES: Publication characteristics, country-specific data points, COVID-19-specific data, demographics of affected HCWs and public health measures employed. RESULTS: A total of 152 888 infections and 1413 deaths were reported. Infections were mainly in women (71.6%, n=14 058) and nurses (38.6%, n=10 706), but deaths were mainly in men (70.8%, n=550) and doctors (51.4%, n=525). Limited data suggested that general practitioners and mental health nurses were the highest risk specialities for deaths. There were 37.2 deaths reported per 100 infections for HCWs aged over 70 years. Europe had the highest absolute numbers of reported infections (119 628) and deaths (712), but the Eastern Mediterranean region had the highest number of reported deaths per 100 infections (5.7). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 infections and deaths among HCWs follow that of the general population around the world. The reasons for gender and specialty differences require further exploration, as do the low rates reported in Africa and India. Although physicians working in certain specialities may be considered high risk due to exposure to oronasal secretions, the risk to other specialities must not be underestimated. Elderly HCWs may require assigning to less risky settings such as telemedicine or administrative positions. Our pragmatic approach provides general trends, and highlights the need for universal guidelines for testing and reporting of infections in HCWs.","Bandyopadhyay, Soham; Baticulon, Ronnie E; Kadhum, Murtaza; Alser, Muath; Ojuka, Daniel K; Badereddin, Yara; Kamath, Archith; Parepalli, Sai Arathi; Brown, Grace; Iharchane, Sara; Gandino, Sofia; Markovic-Obiago, Zara; Scott, Samuel; Manirambona, Emery; Machhada, Asif; Aggarwal, Aditi; Benazaize, Lydia; Ibrahim, Mina; Kim, David; Tol, Isabel; Taylor, Elliott H; Knighton, Alexandra; Bbaale, Dorothy; Jasim, Duha; Alghoul, Heba; Reddy, Henna; Abuelgasim, Hibatullah; Saini, Kirandeep; Sigler, Alicia; Abuelgasim, Leenah; Moran-Romero, Mario; Kumarendran, Mary; Jamie, Najlaa Abu; Ali, Omaima; Sudarshan, Raghav; Dean, Riley; Kissyova, Rumi; Kelzang, Sonam; Roche, Sophie; Ahsan, Tazin; Mohamed, Yethrib; Dube, Andile Maqhawe; Gwini, Grace Paida; Gwokyala, Rashidah; Brown, Robin; Papon, Mohammad Rabiul Karim Khan; Li, Zoe; Ruzats, Salvador Sun; Charuvila, Somy; Peter, Noel",,,498

Here, we present a case report which illustrates a biopsy proven distinct chronic complication of Covid-19 disease which afflicts some survivors: Post Covid-19 Organizing Pneumonia (PCOP). A 30 year old African-American female with known Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection on anti-retroviral therapy (ART) and recently diagnosed nodular marginal zone lymphoma, on chemotherapy, became infected with SARS-Cov-2 in early August, 2020. She presented with fever, increased cough, and shortness of breath worsening over two weeks. In the emergency room, she had temperature 102o F, heart rate of 110 with oxygen saturation 88% on room air. Lab work was significant for Leukocytosis of 17.62 k/uL and recent absolute CD4 of 590/mm3. SARSCoV-2 Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test was positive. Admission Chest Roentgenogram (X-ray) revealed bilateral basal opacities consistent with Covid-19 Pneumonia. Our patient was admitted and received Dexamethasone and a course of empiric antibiotics for community acquired pneumonia. She was discharged on brief oral prednisone taper with home oxygen 2L/min;However, she would be readmitted to hospital twice more over the next eight weeks with similar complaints of cough, recurrent fever, and dyspnea with new focal opacities on serial chest imaging (Figure 1). Her symptoms persisted despite broadened empiric antibiotics including antifungal therapy. Extensive lab work-up for secondary infection and autoimmune disease was unrevealing. Bronchoscopy was finally done with Transbronchial Cryobiopsy (TBC) revealing acute and chronic inflammation with interstitial fibrosis. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cultures were negative. As evidenced by serial imaging (Figure 1), our patient consistently improved with empiric steroids for organizing pneumonia. Her clinical findings recurred with attempts to taper steroids even at five months post initial positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR. This case illustrates Post Covid-19 Organizing Pneumonia (PCOP). It is a Clinicopathologic syndrome characterized by rapid resolution with corticosteroids, but frequent relapses when treatment is tapered or stopped.1 It also illustrates several salient issues in caring for patients who survive acute SARS-CoV-2 infection: i) Delayed viral clearance related to chronic immunosuppression,2 ii) Delayed Bronchoscopy in an effort to mitigate infection risk to care providers, iii) The impact of ongoing therapy on consequent delayed pathology findings,3 iv) Increased morbidity associated with both late disease recognition and our attempts to taper chronic steroid therapy in the setting of an Organizing Pneumonia4 and v) The possibility that earlier biopsy, diagnosis and uninterrupted therapy may prevent pulmonary fibrosis.","Ford, D.

305118,Judicial policy for the covid-19 pandemic in comparative legal perspective,2021,"Purpose Enhancing social participation and reducing emotional distress in persons with aphasia (PWA) are a critical rehabilitation goal. Social relationships and meaningful activities performed by PWA are also crucial to promote positive psychosocial well-being. As a precautionary measure specific to the COVID-19 pandemic, most PWA worldwide have generally followed the guidelines of going out less, restricting when and where to gather with friends and peers, reducing social activities, and maintaining appropriate social distance; these acts are contrary to the traditional principles of managing aphasia. This article aims to (a) highlight and add to our understanding of issues related to the impact of the currently evolving COVID-19 pandemic on PWA, (b) direct readers to relevant reports in the literature of telerehabilitation for aphasia to look for useful information regarding remote assessment and therapy to be considered during the pandemic, (c) summarize support initiatives developed and resources compiled thus far as well as provide links for caregivers and PWA to find more information about COVID-19 in their communities, and (d) offer recommendations to potentially move the field of aphasia research and clinical PWA services forward in a positive way to endure the pandemic and in the forthcoming post-COVID world. Conclusions At present, there are significant knowledge gaps regarding the short and long-term impacts of COVID-19 on PWA and their caregivers. It is crucial that different stakeholders be sensitive and flexible when addressing the psychosocial and rehabilitation needs of PWA to mitigate the negative effects during and after the COVID-19 era.","Kong, Anthony Pak-Hin",J Speech Lang Hear Res,,498

In this study, T and B-cell epitopes of S protein were predicted and screened based on the antigenicity, toxicity, allergenicity, and cross-reactivity with human proteomes. The epitopes were joined by the appropriate linker. LT-IIc as an adjuvant was attached to the end of the structure. The secondary and 3D structure of the vaccine was predicted. The refinement process was performed to improve the quality of the 3D model structure; the validation process is performed using the Ramachandran plot and ProSA z-score. The proposed vaccine's binding affinity to the HLA-A11:01 and HLA-DRB1_01:01 molecule was evaluated by molecular docking. Using molecular dynamics, the stability of vaccine-HLA complexes was also evaluated. Finally, in silico gene cloning was performed in the pET30a (+) vector. The findings suggest that the current vaccine may be a promising vaccine to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Sanami, Samira; Zandi, Milad; Pourhossein, Behzad; Mobini, Gholam-Reza; Safaei, Mohsen; Abed, Atena; Arvejeh, Pooria Mohammadi; Chermahini, Fatemeh Amini; Alizadeh, Morteza",Int J Biol Macromol,,498
307228,Precautionary measures and the first wave evolution of covid-19: A comparison study,2020,"The increasing occurrence, forms, and negative effects of misinformation on social media platforms has necessitated more misinformation detection tools. Currently, work is being done addressing COVID-19 misinformation however, there are no misinformation detection tools for any of the 40 distinct indigenous Ugandan languages. This paper addresses this gap by presenting basic language resources and a misinformation detection data set based on code-mixed Luganda-English messages sourced from the Facebook and Twitter social media platforms. Several machine learning methods are applied on the misinformation detection data set to develop classification models for detecting whether a code-mixed Luganda-English message contains misinformation or not. A 10-fold cross validation evaluation of the classification methods in an experimental misinformation detection task shows that a Discriminative Multinomial Naive Bayes (DMNB) method achieves the highest accuracy and F-measure of 78.19% and 77.90% respectively. Also, Support Vector Machine and Bagging ensemble classification models achieve comparable results. These results are promising since the machine learning models are based on n-gram features from only the misinformation detection dataset.","Nabende, Peter; Kabiito, David; Babirye, Claire; Tusiime, Hewitt; Nakatumba-Nabende, Joyce",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.00124v2.pdf,498

308474,The Dilemma between Self-Protection and Service Provision under Danish COVID-19 Guidelines: A Comparison of Public Servants’ Experiences in the Pandemic Frontline,2020,"BACKGROUND: As many countries seek to slow the spread of COVID-19 without reimposing national restrictions, it has become important to track the disease at a local level to identify areas in need of targeted intervention. METHODS: In this prospective, observational study, we did modelling using longitudinal, self-reported data from users of the COVID Symptom Study app in England between March 24, and Sept 29, 2020. Beginning on April 28, in England, the Department of Health and Social Care allocated RT-PCR tests for COVID-19 to app users who logged themselves as healthy at least once in 9 days and then reported any symptom. We calculated incidence of COVID-19 using the invited swab (RT-PCR) tests reported in the app, and we estimated prevalence using a symptom-based method (using logistic regression) and a method based on both symptoms and swab test results. We used incidence rates to estimate the effective reproduction number, R(t), modelling the system as a Poisson process and using Markov Chain Monte-Carlo. We used three datasets to validate our models: the Office for National Statistics (ONS) Community Infection Survey, the Real-time Assessment of Community Transmission (REACT-1) study, and UK Government testing data. We used geographically granular estimates to highlight regions with rapidly increasing case numbers, or hotspots. FINDINGS: From March 24 to Sept 29, 2020, a total of 2&emsp14;873&emsp14;726 users living in England signed up to use the app, of whom 2&emsp14;842&emsp14;732 (98&middot;9%) provided valid age information and daily assessments. These users provided a total of 120&emsp14;192&emsp14;306 daily reports of their symptoms, and recorded the results of 169&emsp14;682 invited swab tests. On a national level, our estimates of incidence and prevalence showed a similar sensitivity to changes to those reported in the ONS and REACT-1 studies. On Sept 28, 2020, we estimated an incidence of 15&emsp14;841 (95% CI 14&emsp14;023&ndash;17&emsp14;885) daily cases, a prevalence of 0&middot;53% (0&middot;45&ndash;0&middot;60), and R(t) of 1&middot;17 (1&middot;15&ndash;1&middot;19) in England. On a geographically granular level, on Sept 28, 2020, we detected 15 (75%) of the 20 regions with highest incidence according to government test data. INTERPRETATION: Our method could help to detect rapid case increases in regions where government testing provision is lower. Self-reported data from mobile applications can provide an agile resource to inform policy makers during a quickly moving pandemic, serving as a complementary resource to more traditional instruments for disease surveillance.

This assay uses CRISPR-Cas12a activity to enhance viral amplicon signal, which is stimulated by the laser diode of a smartphone-based fluorescence microscope device. This device robustly quantified viral load over a broad linear range (1 to 105 copies/µl) and exhibited a limit of detection (0.38 copies/µl) below that of the RT-PCR reference assay. CRISPR-read SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) RNA levels were similar in patient saliva and nasal swabs, and viral loads measured by RT-PCR and the smartphone-read CRISPR assay demonstrated good correlation, supporting the potential use of this portable assay for saliva-based point-of-care COVID-19 diagnosis.","Ning, Bo; Yu, Tao; Zhang, Shengwei; Huang, Zhen; Tian, Di; Lin, Zhen; Niu, Alex; Golden, Nadia; Hensley, Krystle; Threeton, Breanna; Lyon, Christopher J; Yin, Xiao-Ming; Roy, Chad J; Saba, Nakhle S; Rappaport, Jay; Wei, Qingshan; Hu, Tony Y",Sci.

Here, we present 11 unique nanobodies (Nbs) specific for the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain (RBD), of which 8 Nbs potently inhibit the interaction of RBD with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the major viral docking site. Following detailed epitope mapping and structural analysis, we select two inhibitory Nbs, one of which binds an epitope inside and one of which binds an epitope outside the RBD:ACE2 interface. Based on these, we generate a biparatopic nanobody (bipNb) with viral neutralization efficacy in the picomolar range. Using bipNb as a surrogate, we establish a competitive multiplex binding assay (""NeutrobodyPlex"") for detailed analysis of the presence and performance of neutralizing RBD-binding antibodies in serum of convalescent or vaccinated patients. We demonstrate that NeutrobodyPlex enables high-throughput screening and detailed analysis of neutralizing immune responses in infected or vaccinated individuals, to monitor immune status or to guide vaccine design.","Wagner, Teresa R; Ostertag, Elena; Kaiser, Philipp D; Gramlich, Marius; Ruetalo, Natalia; Junker, Daniel; Haering, Julia; Traenkle, Bjoern; Becker, Matthias; Dulovic, Alex; Schweizer, Helen; Nueske, Stefan; Scholz, Armin; Zeck, Anne; Schenke-Layland, Katja; Nelde, Annika; Strengert, Monika; Walz, Juliane S; Zocher, Georg; Stehle, Thilo; Schindler, Michael; Schneiderhan-Marra, Nicole; Rothbauer, Ulrich",EMBO Rep,,498
308977,COVID-19 pandemic: challenges ahead,2020,"This paper considers the costs and benefits of New Zealands Covid-19 nation-wide lockdown strategy relative to pursuit of a mitigation strategy in March 2020. Using data available up to 28 June 2021, the estimated additional deaths from a mitigation strategy are 1,750 to 4,600, implying a Cost per Quality Adjusted Life Year saved by locking down in March 2020 of at least 13 times the generally employed threshold figure of $62,000 for health interventions in New Zealand; the lockdowns do not then seem to have been justified by reference to the standard benchmark. Using only data available to the New Zealand government in March 2020, the ratio is similar and therefore the same conclusion holds that the nation-wide lockdown strategy was not warranted. Looking forwards from 28 June 2021, if a new outbreak occurs that cannot be suppressed without a nation-wide lockdown, the death toll from adopting a mitigation strategy at this point would be even less than had it done so in March 2020, due to the vaccination campaign and because the period over which the virus would then inflict casualties would now be much less than the period from March 2020; this would favour a mitigation policy even more strongly than in March 2020. This approach of assessing the savings in quality adjusted life years and comparing them to a standard benchmark figure ensures that all quality adjusted life years saved by various health interventions are treated equally, which accords with the ethical principle of equity across people.","Lally, Martin",,,498
308987,Online Delivery of Teaching and Laboratory Practices: Continuity of University Programmes during COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: The rapid outbreak of COVID-19 around the world has adversely affected the mental health of the public. The prevalence of anxiety among the public has increased dramatically during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there are few studies evaluating the effects of positive psychological responses and information-seeking behaviors on anxiety experienced among social media users during the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the prevalence of anxiety and its associated factors among WeChat users in mainland China during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: From February 10 to February 24, 2020, a nationwide, web-based cross-sectional survey study was carried out using convenience sampling. Participants' levels of anxiety, positive psychological responses, and information-seeking behaviors were assessed. The survey was distributed among WeChat users via the WeChat smartphone platform. Chi-square tests and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to examine the factors associated with anxiety. RESULTS: This study found that the prevalence of anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item [GAD-7] scale score &#8805;7) among WeChat users in China was 17.96% (446/2483) during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Results of multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that information-seeking behaviors such as cannot stop searching for information on COVID-19, being concerned about the COVID-19 pandemic, and spending more than 1 hour per day consuming information about the pandemic were found to be associated with increased levels of anxiety. Additionally, participants who chose social media and commercial media as the primary sources to obtain information about the COVID-19 pandemic were found more likely to report anxiety. Conversely, participants who were confident or rational about the COVID-19 pandemic were less likely to report anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: This study found that positive psychological responses and information-seeking behaviors were closely associated with anxiety among WeChat users during the COVID-19 pandemic in China. It might be paramount to enhance mental well-being by helping people respond to the COVID-19 pandemic more rationally and positively in order to decrease symptoms of anxiety.","Zou, Changqing; Zhang, Weiyu; Sznajder, Kristin; Yang, Fengzhi; Jia, Yajing; Ma, Ruqing; Cui, Can; Yang, Xiaoshi",J Med Internet Res,,498

Owing to its critical role in eliciting innate immune responses, IL-1ß has been suggested to contribute to various skin diseases, including psoriasis, vitiligo, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and atopic dermatitis (AD). Recently, several types of activators and inhibitors of different inflammasomes, as well as inflammasome-related genes and genetic susceptibility loci, have been identified in these immune-related common skin diseases. In particular, inflammasome activators and inhibitors presented highly cell-type-specific activity, suggesting that the inflammasome might perform different functions in different cell types. Moreover, most of these findings were based on experimental disease models, and the clinical features of the models partly resemble the typical symptoms of the diseases. In this review, from the perspective of activators and inhibitors, we collected evidence from the widely-studied inflammasomes, NLRP3, AIM2, and NLRP1, in psoriasis, vitiligo, SLE, and AD. Importantly, some small-molecule inhibitors hold therapeutic promise for the treatment of these diseases.","Tang, Lili; Zhou, Fusheng",Front Immunol,,498

STUDY DESIGN: This is a retrospective cohort study of patients who had a medication abortion up to 77 days gestation at the University of Hawai'i between April and November 2020. Patients had the option of traditional in clinic care or telemedicine with either in clinic pickup or mailing of medications. During this time, a no-test protocol for medication abortion without prior labs or ultrasound was in place for eligible patients. The primary outcome was the rate of successful medication abortion without surgical intervention. Secondary outcomes included abortion-related complications. RESULTS: A total of 334 patients were dispensed mifepristone and misoprostol, 149 (44.6%) with telemedicine with in-person pickup of medications, 75 (22.5%) via telemedicine with medications mailed, and 110 (32.9%) via traditional in person visits. The overall rate of complete medication abortion without surgical intervention was 95.8%, with success rates of 96.8, 97.1, and 93.6% for the clinic pickup, mail, and clinic visit groups, respectively. Success for those without an ultrasound performed prior to the procedure was 96.6%, compared to 95.5% for those with ultrasound. We obtained follow-up data for 87.8% of participants. CONCLUSIONS: Medication abortion was safe and effective while offering multiple modes of care delivery including telemedicine visits without an ultrasound performed prior to dispensing medications. IMPLICATIONS: Incorporating telemedicine and a no-test protocol for medication abortion is safe and has the potential to expand access to abortion care. All care models had low rates of adverse events, which contradicts the idea that the Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategyincreases the safety of medication abortion.","Kerestes, Courtney; Murayama, Sarah; Tyson, Jasmine; Natavio, Melissa; Seamon, Elisabeth; Raidoo, Shandhini; Lacar, Lea; Bowen, Emory; Soon, Reni; Platais, Ingrida; Kaneshiro, Bliss; Stowers, Paris",Contraception,,498

Mortality can be expressed with different parameters through multiparametric prediction models. Based on the Beta Gompertz generalized Makeham (BGGM) distribution, this study aims to evaluate and map four of such parameters for 22 countries of the European Union, over the period 1960–2045. The BGGM probabilistic distribution is a multidimensional model, which can predict using the corresponding probabilistic distribution with the following parameters: infant mortality (parameter θ), population aging (parameter ξ), and individual and population mortality due to unexpected exogenous factors/events (parameters κ and λ, respectively). This work focuses on the random risk factor (λ) that can affect the entire population, regardless of age and gender, with increasing mortality depicting developments and trends, both temporally (past–present–future) and spatially (22 countries). Moreover, this study could help policymakers in the field of health provide solutions in terms of mortality. Mathematical models like BGGM can be used to achieve and highlight probable cyclical repetitions of sudden events (such as Covid-19) in different time series for different geographical areas. GIS context is used to map the spatial patterns of this estimated parameter as well as these variations during the examined period for both men and women.

314656,Performance of Digital Contact Tracing Tools for COVID-19 Response in Singapore: Cross-Sectional Study,2020,"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2) has caused an infectious disease that affects multiple organs. Recently, the cardiological effects of the virus have also been striking. To the best of our knowledge, there are no SARS CoV-2 positive paediatric cases reported with sinus bradycardia in the literature. CASE PRESENTATION: A 14-year-old male patient presented with complaints of abdominal pain and fatigue. The heart rate of the patient, whose grandmother was found to be positive for SARS CoV-2 test, ranged between 43 and 60/min, the heart sounds were normal. There was no known history of cardiological disorder in the patient and his family. His laboratory findings were; normal Troponin I, elevated C Reactive protein, normal Haemoglobin, normal CK-MB, mildly elevated D-Dimer. Electrocardiography of the patient was evaluated as sinus bradycardia. There was no pathological finding in his echocardiography. The SARS CoV-2 PCR test was positive. In his follow-up, the heart rate decreased to 50 beats per minute while awake and 43 beats per minute while sleeping. The patient had a bradycardic course until the 4th day of hospitalisation. Control SARS CoV-2 PCR test was negative. He was discharged on the 8th day. CONCLUSION: It's understood that SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for multiple cardiac manifestations. The most common bradyarrhythmia associated with SARS CoV-2 reported worldwide is sinus bradycardia and complete heart block. In order to contribute to the literature, we present a 14-year-old paediatric patient with positive SARS CoV-2 PCR test who has normal cardiac tests and sinus bradycardia.","Kilicaslan, Onder; Isancli, Didem Kizmaz; Ulutas, Omer Yilmaz; Ergin, Selma Oktay; Karbuz, Adem",Infect Dis (Lond),,498

Eradicating the pandemic requires sustainment of the healthcare workforce through actions that mitigate stress, promote resilience, and enhance performance. A major barrier is the lack of organizational practices and procedures designed to sustain HCWs during prolonged crisis events, such as COVID-19. Adapting existing best practices from other high-risk occupations allows for a more rapid, efficient response to optimize workforce well-being and preserve healthcare organizational functioning. This paper discusses current and emerging literature on the unique impacts of COVID-19 on HCWs and provides actionable, evidence-informed recommendations for individuals, teams, and leaders to enhance sustainment of HCWs that is critical to the preservation of national and global health security.","Morganstein, Joshua C; Flynn, Brian W",J. occup. environ. med,,498

The pandemic situation due to COVID-19 is disrupting all kinds of work nowadays. The effect of this epidemic greatly hit on the economic and educational sectors all over the world. Due to this pandemic situation, the government of Bangladesh has decided to make some plans for academic purposes. The mental impact of online activities that have been conducted by the students has also been discussed in this study. To collect the information, a simple online-based survey was conducted between 19th October 2020 to 5th December 2020. The survey 'Google Form' was made of some systemic questionnaires and was being sent to the people through social media platforms for collecting the datum. About 313 people participated in the survey and among them, 299 people agreed to share their information with us, the rest of 14 people disagreed. Around 57% of students did not support the step of 'Auto-Promotion' and many students think that there would be an alternative way for HSC examination. Only 28.43% of students say that it is possible to properly judge their merit by online examination. Most of the students are facing many health issues like anxiety, depression, mental stress, etc by using the internet and other computing devices. The students living in rural areas are the most sufferers due to poor internet connection.

All data were surveyed by questionnaires online and offline, and participants were required to fill in the monthly average of daily step counts were recorded an application on participants' smartphone devices from Pre-COVID-19 (2019 year) and during COVID-19 (2020 year). Participants were 834 adults (males: 54.4%, female: 45.6%) and all statistical analyses were summarized by SPSS 25.0 program. The monthly average of daily step counts was 6747.09 during Pre-COVID-19, but the PA during COVID-19 was 5812.11 daily step counts per month. Also, there were significant pairwise differences between average PA Pre-COVID-19 and each level of social distancing (p < 0.001). After COVID-19, the participants who slept less than 7 hours decreased by 3.6%, while those who slept more than 9 hours increased by that much. As a result of BW, 269 participants responded their BW changed during COVID-19, and 199 of them reported they gained BW during COVID-19 (74.0%). Although self-reported questionnaires may have led to an under-or over-estimation of ST and BW, the present study found that the environment in which the COVID-19 is prevalent had adverse relationships on PA, ST, and BW. Therefore, it is important to identify strategies to motivate individuals for remaining physically active and getting adequate sleep while maintaining social distancing due to the presence of the COVID-19 global pandemic.","Park, Jeong-Hui; Yoo, Eunhye; Kim, Youngdeok; Lee, Jung-Min",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,498

Methods: Stool samples were collected from patients with urolithiasis and healthy patients between March and December 2017. The samples were analyzed by 16S sequencing to determine differences in the microbiome profiles between the two groups. The mouse model was established and was divided into two groups. Fecal samples were collected from the mice before gavage and three weeks postgavage for microbiome analysis. The microbial population of each group was analyzed to screen for microbial species that may affect the formation of urinary stones. Differences in the number of crystals in the renal tubules of the mice were examined by necropsy. Results: The microbial composition was different between urolithiasis patients and healthy controls. The urolithiasis patients had significantly reduced microbial abundance; however, increased proportions of Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria were detected compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, the abundance of Alistipesindistinctus and Odoribactersplanchnicus was significantly increased in the urolithiasis patients compared to the healthy controls. In addition, the incidence of urolithiasis was much higher in the experimental mouse group (stone solution + urolithiasis patient stool) than in the control mouse group. However, the microbial abundance before gavage was not significantly different from that seen three weeks postgavage. Conclusion: Theurolithiasis patients in this study had a different gut microbiome when compared with that of healthy individuals. The altered microbiome increased the rate of crystal formation in renal tubules and accelerated urinary stone formation in the mouse model of urolithiasis.","Zhou, Chenhao; Li, Kai; Zhao, Lun; Li, Wei; Guo, Zongbao; Xu, Jingyao; Qi, Xiaofei; Yuan, Hexing",Biomed Res Int,,498

There are many problems in landscape architecture education during the pandemic such as students’ decreased attention, poor self-regulation, low proactivity, and difficulty in grading. In addition, situational effects are required for landscape architecture education, but online education lacks the necessary case scenarios for courses during the pandemic. In order to solve these problems, the present study adopted a more accessible, and interactive spherical video-based immersive virtual reality (SV-IVR) approach, developed a landscape architecture SV-IVR learning system, and conducted a quasi-experimental study to examine its effectiveness. The results indicated that the experimental group students showed more positive results in their learning achievements, learning attitudes, and self-regulation than the control group. Besides, it was found that students required more time to develop their self-efficacy and that this system would not have an effect on students’ cognitive load.","Wu, Wei-Long Hsu Yen Yang Qi-Fan Chen Jiang-Jie",Land,,498

319364,[2020: Archivos in Times of COVID-19],2021,"The discovery of drugs capable of inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 is a priority for human beings due to the severity of the global health pandemic caused by COVID-19. To this end, repurposing of FDA-approved drugs such as NSAIDs against COVID-19 can provide therapeutic alternatives that could be utilized as an effective safe treatment for COVID-19. The anti-inflammatory activity of NSAIDs is also advantageous in the treatment of COVID-19, as it was found that SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for provoking inflammatory cytokine storms resulting in lung damage. In this study, 40 FDA-approved NSAIDs were evaluated through molecular docking against the main protease of SARS-CoV-2. Among the tested compounds, sulfinpyrazone 2, indomethacin 3, and auranofin 4 were proposed as potential antagonists of COVID-19 main protease. Molecular dynamics simulations were also carried out for the most promising members of the screened NSAID candidates (2, 3, and 4) to unravel the dynamic properties of NSAIDs at the target receptor. The conducted quantum mechanical study revealed that the hybrid functional B3PW91 provides a good description of the spatial parameters of auranofin 4. Interestingly, a promising structure-activity relationship (SAR) was concluded from our study that could help in the future design of potential SARS-CoV-2 main protease inhibitors with expected anti-inflammatory effects as well. NSAIDs may be used by medicinal chemists as lead compounds for the development of potent SARS-CoV-2 (Mpro) inhibitors. In addition, some NSAIDs can be selectively designated for treatment of inflammation resulting from COVID-19.","Abo Elmaaty, Ayman; Hamed, Mohammed I A; Ismail, Muhammad I; B Elkaeed, Eslam; S Abulkhair, Hamada; Khattab, Muhammad; Al-Karmalawy, Ahmed A",Molecules (Basel),,498

World Health Organization recommends local production of ABHR solution in healthcare settings which provides a feasible alternative to the use of relatively expensive commercially produced hand sanitizers. The aim of this study was to explore the adequacy of ABHR solution production practice in response to COVID-19 in public hospitals of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. METHODS: A cross-sectional observational study was applied using assessment checklist for evaluation of the adequacy of ABHR production practice in compounding units of public hospitals. The evaluation was done with regard to the standard requirements as per the checklist. Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 23 was used for data entry and analysis. Descriptive statistics was employed for analyses of data and categorical variables were described by frequencies and percentages. RESULTS: Out of the 13 public hospitals observed in the study, 11 facilities had dedicated premises for compounding of ABHR solution. Seven facilities determined the concentration of ethanol in ABHR solution using alcoholmeters. Only one health facility had a titration kit and performed a strength test for the hydrogen peroxide raw material. Thermal and chemical disinfection processes were practiced for cleaning of recycled dispensing bottles only in 3 and 2 hospitals, respectively. Most of the hospitals (11 facilities) had standard operating procedures (SOPs) for production, but the majority lack SOPs for beyond-use-date assignment (11 facilities), premise and equipment cleaning (12 facilities), and disinfection of recycled bottles (12 facilities). CONCLUSION: Most hospitals have fulfilled the majority requirements of premises required for compounding of ABHR solution in their facilities. Five hospitals did not verify the concentration of ethanol in the ABHR solution which might affect the effectiveness of the product. Generally, lower compliance of the majority studied hospitals to good compounding practice was observed during ABHR solution production especially for product preparation, quality control, and documentation.","Selam, M.

Pause will remain effective in New York City in some form until early June. We use a compartmentalized model to study the effects of testing capacity and social distancing measures on the evolution of the pandemic in the""post-Pause""period in the City. We find that testing capacity must increase dramatically if it is to counterbalance even relatively small relaxations in social distancing measures in the immediate post-Pause period. In particular, if the City performs 20,000 tests per day and relaxes the social distancing measures to the pre-Pause norms, then the total number of deaths by the end of September can reach 250,000. By keeping the social distancing measures to somewhere halfway between the pre- and in-Pause norms and performing 100,000 tests per day, the total number of deaths by the end of September can be kept at around 27,000. Going back to the pre-Pause social distancing norms quickly must be accompanied by an exorbitant testing capacity, if one is to suppress excessive deaths. If the City is to go back to the""pre-Pause""social distancing norms in the immediate post-Pause period and keep the total number of deaths by the end of September at around 35,000, then it should be performing 500,000 tests per day. Our findings have important implications on the magnitude of the testing capacity the City needs as it relaxes the social distancing measures to reopen its economy.","Housni, Omar El; Sumida, Mika; Rusmevichientong, Paat; Topaloglu, Huseyin; Ziya, Serhan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.14700v1.pdf,498

For the prevention and control of infection, Taiwan Centers for Disease Control initiated testing of SARS-CoV-2 on January 24th 2020 for persons suspected with this disease. Until February 28th, 43 flu-like symptomatic patients were screened in China Medical University Hospital. METHODS: Two patients were confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection by rRT-PCR as COVID-19 patients A and B. Causative pathogens for included patients were detected using FilmArray&#8482; Respiratory Panel. We retrospectively analyzed the clinical presentations, laboratory data, radiologic findings, and travel and exposure contact histories, of the COVID-19 patients in comparison to those with other respiratory infections. RESULTS: Through contact with Taiwan No. 19 case patient on 27th January, COVID-19 patients A and B were infected. Both patients had no identified comorbidities and developed mild illness with temporal fever, persistent cough, and lung interstitial infiltrates. Owing to the persistence of positive SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory specimen, the two COVID-19 patients are still in the isolation rooms despite recovery until 10th of March. The results of FilmArrayTM Respiratory Panel revealed 22 of the 41 non-COVID-19 patients were infected by particular pathogens. In general, seasonal respiratory pathogens are more prevalent than SARS-CoV-2 in symptomatic patients in non- COVID-19 endemic area during the flu season. Since all patients shared similar clinical and laboratory findings, expanded surveillance of detailed exposure history for suspected patients and application of rapid detection tools are highly recommended.","Hsih, Wen-Hsin; Cheng, Meng-Yu; Ho, Mao-Wang; Chou, Chia-Huei; Lin, Po-Chang; Chi, Chih-Yu; Liao, Wei-Chih; Chen, Chih-Yu; Leong, Lih-Ying; Tien, Ni; Lai, Huan-Cheng; Lai, Yi-Chyi; Lu, Min-Chi",J Microbiol Immunol Infect,,498

Proposed model is novel since it additionally includes parameters i.e. silent carriers, sociability of newly infected person and unregistered died coronavirus infected people along with the infection rate, suspected rate and death rate. These parameters contribute a lot to figure out the more clear model, along with essential parameters. The model takes the testing rate of suspected people into consideration and this rate varies with respect to phase of the epidemic growth. Proposed 3P-SIRD model is divided into three-phases based on the awareness and sustainability of disease. Time is divided into different periods as rate of infection and recovery fluctuates region to region. The model is tested on China data and is efficient enough to propose a model very close to their actual figures of infected people, recovered people, died and active cases. The model predicts the optimal lockdown period as 73 days for China which is very close to their actual lockdown period (77 days). Further, the model is implemented to predict the optimal lockdown period of India and Italy.","Lalwani, Soniya; Sahni, Gunjan; Mewara, Bhawna; Kumar, Rajesh",Chaos Solitons Fractals,,498

A critical assessment of gaps in national and local food policies to trigger a major transformation in the Portuguese food system is also conducted on the basis of a newly proposed analytical framework. Results show that food consumption in Portugal is the single largest reason (&#8776;30%) for transgressing the carrying capacity of Earth ecosystems but, despite the urgent need for changes in Portuguese food systems, major deficiencies in local policy implementation exist with weak policy commitment, coordination, and lacking institutional capacity as food policies - especially at the local level - are still not prioritized.

328556,Public Attention about COVID-19 on Social Media: An Investigation based on Data Mining and Text Analysis,2021,"BACKGROUND: The quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) approach is most widely used for prediction of biological activity of potential medicinal compounds. A QSAR model is developed by correlating the information obtained from chemical structures (numerical descriptors/independent variables) with the experimental response values (the dependent variable). METHODS: In the current study, we have developed a QSAR model to predict inhibitory activity of small molecule carboxamides against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) 3CLpro enzyme. Due to the structural similarity of this enzyme with that of SARS-CoV-2, the causative organism of the recent pandemic, the former may be used for development of therapies against corona virus disease 19 (COVID-19). RESULTS: The final multiple linear regression (MLR) model was based on four two-dimensional descriptors with definite physicochemical meaning. The model was strictly validated using different internal and external quality metrics. The model showed significant statistical quality in terms of determination cofficient (R20.748, adjusted R2(R2adj 0.700), cross-validated leave-one-out Q2(Q20.628 and external predicted variance (R2pred 0.723). The final validated model was used for the prediction of external set compounds as well as to virtually design a new library of small molecules. We have also performed docking analysis of the most active and least active compounds present in the data set for comparative analysis and to explain the features obtained from the 2D-QSAR model. CONCLUSION: The derived model may be useful to predict the inhibitory activity of small molecules within the applicability domain of the model only based on the chemical structure information prior to their synthesis and testing.","Khan, Pathan Mohsin; Kumar, Vinay; Roy, Kunal",,,498

Although temperature testing is suggested as a first-line test for COVID-19, it was not reliable because many diseases have the same symptoms. Thus, we propose a deep learning method based on X-ray images that used a convolutional neural network (CNN) and transfer learning (TL) for COVID-19 diagnosis, and using gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) technique for producing visual explanations for the COVID-19 infection area in the lung. The low sample size of coronavirus samples was considered a challenge, thus, this issue was overridden using data augmentation techniques. The study found that the proposed (CNN) and the modified pre-trained networks VGG16 and InceptionV3 achieved a promising result for COVID-19 diagnosis by using chest X-ray images. The proposed CNN was able to differentiate 284 patients with COVID-19 or normal with 98.2 percent for training accuracy and 96.66 percent for test accuracy and 100.0 percent sensitivity. The modified VGG16 achieved the best classification result between all with 100.0 percent for training accuracy and 98.33 percent for test accuracy and 100.0 percent sensitivity, but the proposed CNN overcame the others in the side of reducing the computational complexity and training time significantly. © 2021 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

METHODS: This phase 1 study (NCT02833857) evaluated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) of single-dose etelcalcetide (0.035 mg/kg intravenously) in pediatric hemodialysis patients (two cohorts; 1: 12-< 18 years; 2: 2-< 12 years). Treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs), PK/PD were assessed post-dose on D1 at 10 min and 4 h, on multiple days until D10, and at end of study (D30). RESULTS: Etelcalcetide administered to 11 patients (mean [SD] age 10.3 [4.3] years; cohort 1, n = 6; cohort 2, n = 5) was well tolerated. AEs were consistent with established safety profiles in adults. Two patients (1 per cohort) reported treatment-related AEs (cohort 1: hypocalcemia; cohort 2: headache, paresthesia, vomiting). No serious AEs or deaths were reported. Mean serum corrected calcium (cCa) for all patients was maintained > 2.25 mmol/L.

In the absence of new targeted drugs and vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 at present, the choices for effective treatments are limited. Therefore, considering the exigency of the situation, we focused on identifying the available approved drugs as potential inhibitor against the promising Coronavirus drug target, the Main Protease, using computer-aided methods. We created a library of U. S. Food and Drug Administration approved anti-microbial drugs and virtually screened it against the available crystal structures of Main Protease of the virus. The study revealed that Viomycin showed the highest -CDocker energy after docking at the active site of SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease. It is noteworthy that Viomycin showed higher -CDocker energy as compared to the drugs currently under clinical trial for SARS-CoV-2 treatment viz. Ritonavir and Lopinavir. Additionally, Viomycin formed higher number of H-bonds with SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease than its co-crystallised inhibitor compound N3. Molecular dynamics simulation further showed that Viomycin embedded deeply inside the binding pocket and formed robust binding with SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease. Therefore, we propose that Viomycin may act as a potential inhibitor of the Main Protease of SARS-CoV-2. Further optimisations with the drug may support the much-needed rapid response to mitigate the pandemic.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

335941,Assessment on impact of covid 19 pandemic on fear and socioeconomic status among South Indian population,2020,"Policy Points Equitable access to a COVID-19 vaccine in all countries remains a key policy objective, but experience of previous pandemics suggests access will be limited in developing countries, despite the rapid development of three successful vaccine candidates. The COVAX Facility seeks to address this important issue, but the prevalence of vaccine nationalism threatens to limit the ability of the facility to meet both its funding targets and its ambitious goals for vaccine procurement. A failure to adequately address the underlying lack of infrastructure in developing countries threatens to further limit the success of the COVAX Facility. CONTEXT: Significant effort has been directed toward developing a COVID-19 vaccine, which is viewed as the route out of the pandemic. Much of this effort has coalesced around COVAX, the multilateral initiative aimed at accelerating the development of COVID-19 vaccines, and ensuring they are equitably available in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). This paper represents the first significant analysis of COVAX, and the extent to which it can be said to have successfully met these aims. METHODS: This paper draws on the publicly available policy documents made available by the COVAX initiatives, as well as position papers and public statements from governments around the world with respect to COVID-19 vaccines and equitable access. We analyze the academic literature regarding access to vaccines during the H1N1 pandemic. Finally, we consider the WHO Global Allocation System, and its principles, which are intended to guide COVAX vaccine deployment. FINDINGS: We argue that the funding mechanism deployed by the COVAX Pillar appears to be effective at fostering at-risk investments in research and development and the production of doses in advance of confirmation of clinical efficacy, but caution that this represents a win-win situation for vaccine manufacturers, providing them with opportunity to benefit regardless of whether their vaccine candidate ever goes on to gain regulatory approval. We also argue that the success of the COVAX Facility with respect to equitable access to vaccine is likely to be limited, primarily as a result of the prevalence of vaccine nationalism, whereby countries adopt policies which heavily prioritize their own public health needs at the expense of others. CONCLUSIONS: Current efforts through COVAX have greatly accelerated the development of vaccines against COVID-19, but these benefits are unlikely to flow to LMICs, largely due to the threat of vaccine nationalism.","Eccleston-Turner, Mark; Upton, Harry",Milbank q,,498

This study aimed to investigate the source of the outbreak and assess the risk of transmission of COVID-19 during the flight. METHOD: Using a standardized questionnaire, we collected information on the travelers' demographic characteristics and illness before, during, and after the flight. We also collected data on factors potentially associated with COVID-19 transmission during the flight. RESULTS: A total of 16 COVID-19 patients were diagnosed among all passengers; the overall attack rate was 4.8%. The attack rate among passengers who had departed from Wuhan was significantly higher than that among those who had departed from other places. One passenger without an epidemiological history of exposure before boarding developed COVID-19. During the flight, he was seated near four infected passengers from Wuhan for approximately an hour and did not wear his facemask correctly during the flight. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 transmission may have occurred during the flight. However, the majority of the cases in the flight-associated outbreak could not be attributed to transmission on the flight but were associated with exposure to the virus in Wuhan or to infected members in a single tour group.","Chen, Junfang; He, Hanqing; Cheng, Wei; Liu, Yan; Sun, Zhou; Chai, Chengliang; Kong, Qingxin; Sun, Wanwan; Zhang, Jiaqi; Guo, Song; Shi, Xuguang; Wang, Jinna; Chen, Enfu; Chen, Zhiping",Travel Med Infect Dis,,498

DISCUSSION: There has been an increased risk of ITP after administration of various vaccines like influenza, measles-mumps-rubella, hepatitis B, and diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis. The pathogenesis of vaccine-related thrombocytopenia is not completely clear and is probably caused by molecular mimicry. Till date, there have been few reported cases of thrombocytopenia in the pharmacovigilance databases after patients received the Pfizer and Moderna coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) vaccines. CONCLUSION: Emergency physicians should be aware of the occurrence of vaccine-induced ITP in patients who present with bleeding manifestations, especially after the current boost in COVID-19 vaccination drive worldwide.","Saudagar, Vrushali; Patil, Satish; Goh, Shaun; Pothiawala, Sohil",Ir. j. med. sci,,498

340717,Supporting Australia’s housing system: Modelling pandemic policy responses,2020,"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which emerged in the city of Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, has spread worldwide and is threatening human life. The detection of SARS-CoV-2 is critical for preventing new outbreaks, curbing disease spread, and managing patients. Currently, a reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay is used to detect the virus in clinical laboratories. However, although this assay is considered to have high specificity, its sensitivity is reportedly as low as 60-70 %. Improved sensitivity is, therefore, urgently required. METHODS: We used the primers and single-quencher probes recommended by the CDC (N1, N2 and N3) in the USA and the NIID (N1 and N2) in Japan. In addition, we designed double-quencher probes according to the virus sequence provided by the NIID to develop a further assay (termed the YCH assay [N1 and N2]). Using these assays, we conducted RT-PCR with serially diluted DNA positive controls to assess and compare the detection sensitivity of the three assays. Furthermore, 66 nasopharyngeal swabs were tested to determine the diagnostic performances. RESULTS: The threshold cycle (Ct) value of the RT-PCR was relatively low for the CDC and YCH assays compared with the NIID assay. Serial dilution assays showed that both the CDC and YCH assays could detect low copy numbers of the DNA positive control. The background fluorescence signal at the baseline was lower for the YCH assay compared with the NIID assay. We assessed the diagnostic performance between single- (NIID) and double-quencher (YCH) probes using 66 nasopharyngeal swabs. When the results of YCH-N2 assay were used as a reference, each assay detected SARS-CoV-2 with positive percent agreements of 56 % for NIID-N1, 61 % for YCH-N1, and 94 % for NIID-N2, and 100 % negative percent agreements for NIID-N1, YCH-N1 and NIID-N2. CONCLUSION: Double-quencher probes decreased the background fluorescence and improved the detection sensitivity of RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2.","Hirotsu, Yosuke; Mochizuki, Hitoshi; Omata, Masao",J Virol Methods,,498
341823,Crisis remote education at the maria grzegorzewska university during social isolation in the opinions of academic teachers,2020,"In 2019, a pandemic began due to infection with a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. In many cases, this coronavirus leads to the development of the COVID-19 disease. Lung damage in the course of this disease often leads to acute hypoxic respiratory failure and may eventually lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Respiratory failure as a result of COVID-19 can develop very quickly and a small percent of those infected will die because of it. There is currently no treatment for COVID-19, therefore the key therapeutic intervention centers around the symptomatic treatment of respiratory failure. The main therapeutic goal is to main-tain gas exchange, mainly oxygenation, at an appropriate level and prevent the intensification of changes in the lung parenchyma. Depending on the severity of hypoxemia different techniques can be used to improve oxygenation. Medical staff dealing with COVID-19 patients should be familiar with both, methods used to treat respiratory failure and the epidemiological risks arising from their use. In some patients, conventional (passive) oxygen therapy alone is sufficient. In patients with worsening respiratory failure high flow nasal oxygen therapy (HFNOT) may be effective. The continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and non-invasive ventilation (NIV) methods can be used to a limited extent. With further disease progression, invasive ventilation must be used and in special situations, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) can also be administered. The authors of this article set themselves the goal of presenting the most current knowledge about the epidemiology and patho-physiology of respiratory failure in COVID-19, as well as the methods of its treatment. Given the dynamics of the developing pandemic, this is not an easy task as new scientific data is presented almost every day. However, we believe the knowledge contained in this study will help doctors care for patients with COVID-19. The main target audience of this study is not so much pneumonologists or intensivists who have extensive experience in the application of the techniques discussed here, but rather doctors of other specializations who must master new skills in order to help patients during the time of a pandemic.","Czajkowska-Malinowska, Malgorzata; Kania, Aleksander; Kuca, Pawel Jan; Nasilowski, Jacek; Skoczynski, Szymon; Sokolowski, Rafal; Sliwinski, Pawel Stanislaw",Adv Respir Med,,498

These models, therefore, have significant influence on risk of societal harms. But how clearly are the underlying modelling assumptions and limitations communicated so that decision-makers can readily understand them? When making claims about risk in safety-critical systems, it is common practice to produce an assurance case, which is a structured argument supported by evidence with the aim to assess how confident we should be in our risk-based decisions. We argue that any COVID-19 simulation model that is used to guide critical policy decisions would benefit from being supported with such a case to explain how, and to what extent, the evidence from the simulation can be relied on to substantiate policy conclusions. This would enable a critical review of the implicit assumptions and inherent uncertainty in modelling, and would give the overall decision-making process greater transparency and accountability.","Habli, Ibrahim; Alexander, Rob; Hawkins, Richard; Sujan, Mark; McDermid, John; Picardi, Chiara; Lawton, Tom",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.08381v1.pdf,498

Emerging risk factors for poor outcome in this disease include age, male gender, cardiovascular co-morbidities including hypertension, prior cardiovascular disease, diabetes and more recently obesity. To date there are no data relating to SARS-CoV-2 in PCOS women. The present Clinical Opinion represents a summary of the epidemiological evidence and possible pathophysiological mechanisms regarding PCOS and COVID-19. PCOS women could be more susceptible to infections compared to non-PCOS women. Insulin resistance and the associated hyperinsulinaemia are drivers for enhanced steroidogenesis in women with PCOS. Weight-gain and obesity, through their worsening effects on insulin resistance, thereby drive enhanced steroidogenesis and hyperandrogenism. All these features represent key points to provide an explanation for the possible association between PCOS and SARS-CoV-2. Indeed, androgens may drive clinical results in COVID-19, through the expression of TMPRSS2, a cellular co-receptor necessary for SARS-CoV-2 infection and through androgen-mediated immune modulation. In women with PCOS the endocrine-immune axis leads to immune dysfunction with a state of chronic inflammation, and hyperandrogenism and IR with compensatory hyperglycaemia could play a determining role in the pathophysiogenesis of the infection. However, it is possible that only specific PCOS phenotypes may be more susceptible. In addition, vitamin D deficiency and gut dysbiosis are another important factor potentially involved in the increased risk of developing severe forms of COVID-19 in PCOS women. Further scientific investigations are needed with the aim of understanding which women are most at risk of becoming infected or developing complications, what are the causal mechanisms on which it is possible to intervene with prophylactic and therapeutic measures and what the long-term consequences will be on the health of these patients.","Morgante, Giuseppe; Troìa, Libera; De Leo, Vincenzo",J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol,,498

How We Face This New Pandemic?,2020,"BACKGROUND: There has been much interest in environmental temperature and race as modulators of Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) infection and mortality. However, in the United States race and temperature correlate with various other social determinants of health, comorbidities, and environmental influences that could be responsible for noted effects. This study investigates the independent effects of race and environmental temperature on COVID-19 incidence and mortality in United States counties. METHODS: Data on COVID-19 and risk factors in all United States counties was collected. 661 counties with at least 50 COVID-19 cases and 217 with at least 10 deaths were included in analyses. Upper and lower quartiles for cases/100,000 people and halves for deaths/100,000 people were compared with t-tests. Adjusted linear and logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate the independent effects of race and environmental temperature. RESULTS: Multivariate regression analyses demonstrated Black race is a risk factor for increased COVID-19 cases (OR=1.22, 95% CI: 1.09-1.40, P=0.001) and deaths independent of comorbidities, poverty, access to health care, and other risk factors. Higher environmental temperature independently reduced caseload (OR=0.81, 95% CI: 0.71-0.91, P=0.0009), but not deaths. CONCLUSIONS: Higher environmental temperatures correlated with reduced COVID-19 cases, but this benefit does not yet appear in mortality models. Black race was an independent risk factor for increased COVID-19 cases and deaths. Thus, many proposed mechanisms through which Black race might increase risk for COVID-19, such as socioeconomic and healthcare-related predispositions, are inadequate in explaining the full magnitude of this health disparity.","Li, Adam Y; Hannah, Theodore C; Durbin, John R; Dreher, Nickolas; McAuley, Fiona M; Marayati, Naoum Fares; Spiera, Zachary; Ali, Muhammad; Gometz, Alex; Kostman, J T; Choudhri, Tanvir F",Am J Med Sci,,498

METHODS: Patients with clinical N0 non-small cell lung cancer and total tumour size >30 mm on preoperative computed tomography who underwent complete resection with lobectomy between January 2007 and December 2017 were included. The patients were divided into three groups: pure solid tumour, low ground glass opacity ratio (1-39%) tumour and high ground glass opacity ratio (&#8805;40%) tumour. The cut-off line was determined based on the recurrence rate for every 10% ground glass opacity ratio. RESULTS: Among the 227 study patients, 129 (56.8%) had a pure solid tumour, 54 (23.8%) had a low ground glass opacity ratio tumour and 44 (19.4%) had a high ground glass opacity ratio tumour. Three-year recurrence-free survival was significantly shorter in patients with a pure solid tumour (57.4%) than in patients with a low ground glass opacity ratio (74.5%; P = 0.009) or a high ground glass opacity ratio tumour (92.1%; P < 0.001). Multivariable analysis showed that ground glass opacity ratio was a significant independent prognostic factor for recurrence-free survival (hazard ratio, 0.175; P = 0.037). CONCLUSION: Pure solid tumours comprised a large proportion of non-small cell lung cancer tumours >30 mm in size and their prognosis was poor. The presence of ground glass opacity and their relative proportion affect prognosis in patients with clinical N0 non-small cell lung cancer tumours >30 mm in size, similar to those with small-sized tumours.","Kagimoto, Atsushi; Tsutani, Yasuhiro; Handa, Yoshinori; Mimae, Takahiro; Miyata, Yoshihiro; Okada, Morihito",Jpn. j. clin. oncol,,498

346978,Beating the virus: an examination of the crisis communication approach taken by New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern during the Covid-19 pandemic,2020,"Objective: The COVID-19 pandemic caused a major strain on healthcare systems across the globe. As these systems got overwhelmed with the emergency care of the infected patients, widespread cancellations of elective surgery occurred. Our hospital utilised local private hospital as a dedicated cold site (CS) for urgent elective surgery during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. We aim to analyse the outcomes at this dedicated cold site. Method: A retrospective review of a prospectively maintained database of all the cases operated at the CS during a 2-month period (30 March 2020 to 29 May 2020) was carried out. The primary outcome was 30-day COVID-19 related mortality. The secondary outcomes were 30-day non-COVID-19 related mortality, complications, readmission and development of COVID-19 symptoms. Results: A total of 153 patients were operated on at the CS over the study period with a median age of 57 years (Interquartile range, IQR 47-70). 62% were females and 82% had a Body Mass Index (BMI) less than 30.73% of the operations were performed for cancer. 59% of the surgeries were graded as intermediate and 26% as major or complex. There was no mortality at 30 days from COVID-19 or non COVID-19 causes. There was only 1 (0.65%) readmission. 7 patients (4.57%) developed complications. 1 (0.65%) patient was diagnosed with COVID-19 in the postoperative period while 3 had COVID-19 symptoms but were tested negative. Conclusion: Urgent elective surgery is safe and feasible during the COVID-19 pandemic if a dedicated cold site is available.","Iqbal, Muhammad Rafaih; Dhahri, Adeel Abbas; Mustafa Darwish, Nourelhuda Mohammed; Vijay, Vardhini",,,498
347039,Nursing approach to families in the facing of covid-19 and social distancing,2020,"Introduction: The current pandemic of severe acute respiratory symptom coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has had a major impact on individuals' lives Social isolation and the use of personal protective equipment - the latter being especially important for health care workers - emerged as two of the main methods of preventing the spread of the disease The eye can represent a source of transmission through contaminated tears, as well as a source of infection for respiratory droplets or aerosol particles, which may come into contact with the ocular surface and migrate to the lungs and other parts of the body Objectives: To investigate the risk of ocular transmission through a literature review and identify ways of preventing it Methods: A search of the scientific literature was conducted in the PubMed and Cochrane databases, using a combination of the following keywords: “COVID-19,” “eye,” “personal protective equipment,” “SARS-CoV-2,” “protective goggles,” “face shields,” and “workers' health ” Results: The mechanisms of ocular transmission have not been fully elucidated, but studies have demonstrated the presence of viral RNA in the conjunctival sac and aerosolized secretions of contaminated patients;these droplets may come into contact with the eyes of uninfected bystanders, entering the respiratory system through the nose and gaining access to the lungs Conclusions: Studies show that the virus can be effectively transmitted through the eyes, underscoring the importance of protective goggles for health care workers or potential transmitters of the virus, in addition to the need for additional education measures to encourage hand hygiene and discourage touching of the eyes © 2021 Associacao Nacional de Medicina do Trabalho All rights reserved","Matos, A.

348925,Maternal and child mortality worsens in Latin America and the Caribbean,2020,"Background and Aim: The spread of the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a number of instances of large-scale panic buying Taking the COVID-19 pandemic as an example, this paper explores the impact of panic in uncertain environments on panic buying behavior Under certain circumstances, the spread of rumors about shortage of goods is likely to cause large-scale panic buying This paper focuses on the study of such panic buying caused by online rumors Methods: Firstly, based on the improved BA network, this paper constructs a directed network for public opinion communication and integrates an offline communication network to build a two-layer synchronous coupling network based on online and offline communications Secondly, the individual decision model and the panic emotion transmission model under the uncertain environment are constructed Netizens judge the authenticity of network information, determine their own panic degree according to the above two models, and judge whether they participate in the panic buying based on the above factors Finally, the spread of the public opinion of goods buying under the panic state is simulated and analyzed Results: The experimental results of the two-layer synchronous network that integrates offline interaction are significantly different from the results of pure online interaction, which increases the speed of public opinions spread after offline interaction and affects a wider range of groups Under the condition of sufficient supplies, panic in local areas will not cause large-scale panic buying on the whole network However, the results under the same parameters suggest that if there is a shortage of supplies, panic will spread quickly across the network, leading to large-scale panic buying It is very important to ensure sufficient supply of materials at the beginning of the spread of rumors, which can reduce the number of buyers However, if there is a shortage of goods before the panic dissipates in the later stage, there will still be a large-scale rush purchase Conclusion: These results explain the reasons why it is difficult to stop the buying events in many areas under the COVID-19 pandemic Under the uncertain environment, the panic caused by people's fear of stock shortage promotes the occurrence of large-scale rush buying Therefore, in the event of major public health events, ensuring adequate supply of materials is the top priority","Li, Q.

This characteristic of religion has helped communities in finding answers and meanings to their confusions. During a pandemic, healthcare professionals are often unprepared in answering the patients' religious beliefs regarding the diseases. Moreover, patients are faced with religious clichés and stigma that results because of religious beliefs and practices. To overcome the religious stigma, a deeper understanding of religious beliefs and values is required so that a perception or practice change can take place. Therefore, the inclusion and collaboration of spiritual leaders with healthcare professionals are needed to ensure a holistic understanding and overcome the stigma that can shape as a barrier for reaching an optimal therapeutic outcome.","Hashmi, Furqan K; Iqbal, Qaiser; Haque, Naheed; Saleem, Fahad",J Relig Health,,498

The development of a bioinformatic tool is beneficial to predict the efficacy of TCM against COVID-19. Here we deve-loped a prediction platform TCMATCOV to predict the efficacy of the anti-coronavirus pneumonia effect of TCM, based on the interaction network imitating the disease network of COVID-19. This COVID-19 network model was constructed by protein-protein interactions of differentially expressed genes in mouse pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV and cytokines specifically up-regulated by COVID-19. TCMATCOV adopted quantitative evaluation algorithm of disease network disturbance after multi-target drug attack to predict potential drug effects. Based on the TCMATCOV platform, 106 TCM were calculated and predicted. Among them, the TCM with a high disturbance score account for a high proportion of the classic anti-COVID-19 prescriptions used by clinicians, suggesting that TCMATCOV has a good prediction ability to discover the effective TCM. The five flavors of Chinese medicine with a disturbance score greater than 1 are mainly spicy and bitter. The main meridian of these TCM is lung, heart, spleen, liver, and stomach meridian. The TCM related with QI and warm TCM have higher disturbance score. As a prediction tool for anti-COVID-19 TCM prescription, TCMATCOV platform possesses the potential to discovery possible effective TCM against COVID-19.","Guo, Fei-Fei; Zhang, Yu-Qi; Tang, Shi-Huan; Tang, Xuan; Xu, He; Liu, Zhong-Yang; Huo, Rui-Li; Li, Dong; Yang, Hong-Jun",Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi,,498

The experience, if borne out by further research, provides important lessons for policy discussions on the pandemic, as well as broader lessons about pragmatic responses to these key client groups irrespective of COVID-19. The overarching lesson seems that when government policy is well coordinated and underpinned by a science-driven and fundamentally pragmatic approach, morbidity and mortality can be reduced. Within this, the importance of strategic clarity and delivery, housing, lowered thresholds to methadone provision, Benzodiazepine (BZD) provision and Naloxone availability were key determinants of policy success. Further, this paper argues that the rapid collapse in policy barriers to these interventions that COVID-19 produced should be secured and protected while further research is conducted.","O039,; Carroll, Austin; Duffin, Tony; Collins, John",Int J Drug Policy,,498

353681,Battle with COVID-19: Role of Vitamin D and Zinc as a Preventive Strategy,2020,"BACKGROUND: Copy number variations at the 15q11.2 BP1-BP2 locus are present in 0.5%-1.0% of the population, and the deletion is associated with several neurodevelopmental disorders. Previously, we showed a reciprocal effect of 15q11.2 copy number variation on fractional anisotropy, with widespread increases in deletion carriers. We aim to expand these findings using a larger sample of participants (N = 29,166) and higher resolution imaging and by examining the implications for cognitive performance. METHODS: Diffusion tensor imaging measures from participants with no neurological or psychiatric diagnoses were obtained from the UK Biobank database. We compared 15q11.2 BP1-BP2 deletion (n = 102) and duplication (n = 113) carriers to a large cohort of control individuals with no neuropsychiatric copy number variants (n = 28,951). Additionally, we assessed how changes in white matter mediated the association between carrier status and cognitive performance. RESULTS: Deletion carriers showed increases in fractional anisotropy in the internal capsule and cingulum and decreases in the posterior thalamic radiation compared with both duplication carriers and control subjects (who had intermediate values). Compared with control subjects, deletion carriers had lower scores across cognitive tasks, which were partly influenced by white matter. Reduced fractional anisotropy in the posterior thalamic radiation partially contributed to worse cognitive performance in deletion carriers. CONCLUSIONS: These results, together with our previous findings, provide convergent evidence for an effect of 15q11.2 BP1-BP2 on white matter microstructure, this being more pronounced in deletion carriers. Additionally, changes in white matter were found to partially mediate cognitive ability in deletion carriers, providing a link between white matter changes in 15q11.2 BP1-BP2 carriers and cognitive function.","Silva, Ana I; Kirov, George; Kendall, Kimberley M; Bracher-Smith, Mathew; Wilkinson, Lawrence S; Hall, Jeremy; Ulfarsson, Magnus O; Walters, G Bragi; Stefansson, Hreinn; Stefansson, Kari; Linden, David E J; Caseras, Xavier",Biol. psychiatr,,498

In this conference paper, we outline some recent results on this problem for two models. First, the 'practical' model, which is relevant for screening for COVID-19 and has tests that are highly specific but imperfectly sensitive, shows that simple algorithms can be outperformed at low prevalence and high sensitivity.

357272,Playbook for labour policies for novel shocks such as COVID-19,2020,"People experiencing homelessness are at high risk for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In March 2020, Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program, in partnership with city and state public health agencies, municipal leaders, and homeless service providers, developed and implemented a citywide COVID-19 care model for this vulnerable population. Components included symptom screening at shelter front doors, expedited testing at pop-up sites, isolation and management venues for symptomatic people under investigation and for people with confirmed disease, quarantine venues for asymptomatic exposed people, and contact investigation and tracing. Real-time disease surveillance efforts in a large shelter outbreak of COVID-19 during the third week of operations illustrated the need for several adaptations to the care model to better respond to the local epidemiology of illness among people experiencing homelessness. Symptom screening was de-emphasized given the high number of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic infections discovered during mass testing; contact tracing and quarantining were phased out under the assumption of universal exposure among the sheltered population; and isolation and management venues were rapidly expanded to accommodate a surge in people with newly diagnosed COVID-19. During the first 6 weeks of operation, 429 of 1297 (33.1%) tested people were positive for COVID-19; of these, 395 people were experiencing homelessness at the time of testing, representing about 10% of the homeless adult population in Boston. Universal testing, as resources permit, is a focal point of ongoing efforts to mitigate the effect of COVID-19 on this vulnerable group of people.","Baggett, Travis P; Racine, Melanie W; Lewis, Elizabeth; De Las Nueces, Denise; O039,; Connell, James J; Bock, Barry; Gaeta, Jessie M",Public Health Rep,,498

We find that ideologically dissonant submissions act as a stimulant to activity in the community: they received more attention (comments) than consonant submissions, even though they received lower scores through up-voting and down-voting. Users who engaged with dissonant submissions were also more likely to return to the forum. Consistent with identity theory, confrontation with opposing views triggered activity in the forum, particularly among users that are highly engaged with the community. In light of the findings, theory of social identity and echo chambers is discussed and enhanced.","Oswald, Lisa; Bright, Jonathan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.06516v1.pdf,498
358357,The role of national food security in a massive pandemic: The case of COVID-19,2021,"Background: Living in the time of the COVID-19 means experiencing not only a global health emergency but also extreme psychological stress with potential emotional side effects such as sadness, grief, irritability, and mood swings Crucially, lockdown and confinement measures isolate people who become the first and the only ones in charge of their own mental health: people are left alone facing a novel and potentially lethal situation, and, at the same time, they need to develop adaptive strategies to face it, at home In this view, easy-to-use, inexpensive, and scientifically validated self-help solutions aiming to reduce the psychological burden of coronavirus are extremely necessary Aims: This pragmatic trial aims to provide the evidence that a weekly self-help virtual reality (VR) protocol can help overcome the psychological burden of the Coronavirus by relieving anxiety, improving well-being, and reinforcing social connectedness The protocol will be based on the “Secret Garden” 360 VR video online (www covidfeelgood com) which simulates a natural environment aiming to promote relaxation and self-reflection Three hundred sixty–degree or spherical videos allow the user to control the viewing direction In this way, the user can explore the content from any angle like a panorama and experience presence and immersion The “Secret Garden” video is combined with daily exercises that are designed to be experienced with another person (not necessarily physically together), to facilitate a process of critical examination and eventual revision of core assumptions and beliefs related to personal identity, relationships, and goals Methods: This is a multicentric, pragmatic pilot randomized controlled trial involving individuals who experienced the COVID-19 pandemic and underwent a lockdown and quarantine procedures The trial is approved by the Ethics Committee of the Istituto Auxologico Italiano Each research group in all the countries joining the pragmatic trial, aims at enrolling at least 30 individuals in the experimental group experiencing the self-help protocol, and 30 in the control group, over a period of 3 months to verify the feasibility of the intervention Conclusion: The goal of this protocol is for VR to become the “surgical mask” of mental health treatment Although surgical masks do not provide the wearer with a reliable level of protection against the coronavirus compared with FFP2 or FFP3 masks, surgical masks are very effective in protecting others from the wearer’s respiratory emissions The goal of the VR protocol is the same: not necessarily to solve complex mental health problems but rather to improve well-being and preserve social connectedness through the beneficial social effects generated by positive emotions","Riva, G.; Bernardelli, L.; Browning, M.

359229,A global analysis of the impact of COVID-19 stay-at-home restrictions on crime,2021,"BACKGROUND: Evidence from recent trials has shown conflicting results in terms of the utility of colchicine in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). METHODS: Multiple databases were queried to identify all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the merits of colchicine in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or stable CAD. The pooled relative risk ratio (RR) of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), its components, and gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events were computed using a random-effect model. RESULTS: Ten RCTs comprising a total of 12,761 patients were identified. At a median follow-up of 12 months, there was a significantly lower risk of MACE [RR 0.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.45-96], ACS (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.45-0.96), ischemic stroke (RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.22-0.81), and need for revascularization (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.42-90) in patients receiving colchicine compared with placebo. A subgroup analysis based on the clinical presentation showed that the significantly lower incidence of MACE and stroke were driven by the patients presenting with ACS. The use of colchicine in patients with stable CAD did not reduce the incidence of MACE (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.28-1.09), ACS (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.25-1.08), or stroke (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.33-1.13). There was no significant difference in the relative risk of cardiac arrest, ACS, cardiovascular mortality, and all-cause mortality between the two groups in both ACS and stable CAD populations. The risk of GI adverse events was significantly higher in patients receiving colchicine (RR 2.10, 95% CI 1.12-3.95). CONCLUSION: In patients presenting with ACS, low-dose colchicine might reduce the incidence of MACE, stroke, and the need for revascularization at long follow-up durations. Colchicine might offer no benefits in reducing the risk of ischemic events in patients with stable angina.","Ullah, Waqas; Haq, Shujaul; Zahid, Salman; Gowda, Smitha Narayana; Ottman, Patrick; Saleem, Sameer; Hamzeh, Ihab; Virani, Salim S; Alam, Mahboob; Fischman, David L",Am. j. cardiovasc. drugs,,498

METHODS: A discrete choice experiment (DCE) was undertaken to elicit societal preferences and values. A Bayesian D-efficient and explicit partial profile design was used. The design included 72 choice tasks, split across six blocks, with eight attributes (three overlapping per choice task) and three alternatives. Choice data were analyzed using a panel error component mixed logit model and a latent class model. Preference heterogeneity according to personal socioeconomic, demographic, and attitudinal characteristics was explored using linear and fractional logistic regressions. RESULTS: In total, 820 members of the Australian public were recruited. Statistically significant preferences were identified across all eight DCE attributes. We estimated that society on average would be willing to pay AU$5650 more (95% confidence interval [CI]: AU$5500 to $5800) (US$3955 [95% CI: US$3850 to $4060]) for genomic sequencing relative to standard care. Preference heterogeneity was identified for some personal characteristics. CONCLUSION: On average, society highly values all diagnostic, process, clinical, and nonclinical components of personal utility. To ensure fair prioritization of genomics, decision makers need to consider the wide range of risks and benefits associated with genomic information.","Goranitis, Ilias; Best, Stephanie; Stark, Zornitza; Boughtwood, Tiffany; Christodoulou, John",Genet. med,,498

This allows higher-risk patients with mild COVID-19 symptoms to remain at home, being supplied with a Pulse Oximeter to measure their oxygen saturation (SpO2 ) two to three times daily for two weeks. Patients record their readings manually or electronically which are monitored by a clinical team. Clinical decisions, using an algorithm, are based on SpO2 readings in a narrow range with 1-2 point changes potentially affecting care. In this article, we discussed the problem that multiple factors affect SpO2 readings, and that some ""normal"" individuals will have ""low-normal"" scores at the threshold of clinical management, without any known respiratory problem. We discuss the potential magnitude of this problem based on the associated literature and consider how this will have an impact on the use of the Oximetry@home services, potentially partially confounding their purpose; to reduce face-to-face medical care.","Harland, Nicholas; Greaves, Jane; Fuller, Elizabeth",,,498

This situation may have an impact on mental health, tobacco smoking, and alcohol consumption. The aim of this research report is therefore to describe changes in tobacco and alcohol consumption in the general French population during the first two weeks of lockdown and identify any associated factors. METHODS: Self-reported changes in smoking and alcohol consumption following the lockdown implemented in France on March 17, 2020 were collected from 2,003 respondents aged 18 years and older in an online cross-sectional survey carried out from March 30 to April 1, 2020. Anxiety and depression levels were assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. RESULTS: Among current smokers, 26.7% reported an increase in their tobacco consumption since lockdown and 18.6% reported a decrease, while it remained stable for 54.7%. The increase in tobacco consumption was associated with an age of 18-34 years, a high level of education, and anxiety. Among alcohol drinkers, 10.7% reported an increase in their alcohol consumption since lockdown and 24.4% reported a decrease, while it remained stable for 64.8%. The increase in alcohol consumption was associated with an age of 18-49 years, living in cities of more than 100,000 inhabitants, a high socio-professional category, and a depressive mood. CONCLUSION: The national lockdown implemented in France during the COVID-19 pandemic influenced tobacco and alcohol consumption in different ways according to sociodemographic group and mental health.","Guignard, Romain; Andler, Raphaël; Quatremère, Guillemette; Pasquereau, Anne; du Roscoät, Enguerrand; Arwidson, Pierre; Berlin, Ivan; Nguyen-Thanh, Viêt",Eur. j. public health,,498

This study numerically investigated the cough flow and its time-dependent jet-effects on the transport characteristics of respiratory-induced contaminants in passengers' local environments. Transient simulations were conducted in a three-row Boeing 737 cabin section, while respiratory contaminants (2 µm-1000 µm) were released by different passengers with and without coughing and were tracked by the Lagrangian approach. Outcomes revealed significant influences of cough-jets on passengers' local airflow field by breaking up the ascending passenger thermal plumes and inducing several local airflow recirculation in the front of passengers. Cough flow could be locked in the local environments (i.e. near and intermediate fields) of passengers. Results from comparative studies also revealed significant increases of residence times (up to 50%) and extended travel distances of contaminants up to 200 µm after considering cough flow, whereas contaminants travel displacements still remained similar. This was indicating more severe contaminate suspensions in passengers' local environments. The cough-jets was found having long and effective impacts on contaminants transport up to 4 s, which was 8 times longer than the duration of cough and contaminants release process (0.5 s). Also, comparing to the ventilated flow, cough flow had considerable impacts to a much wider size range of contaminants (up to 200 µm) due to its strong jet-effects.","Yan, Yihuan; Li, Xueren; Yang, Lin; Yan, Ping; Tu, Jiyuan",Build Environ,,498

366201,Dental and medical collaboration during COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: Mechanical power (MP) of artificial ventilation, the energy transferred to the respiratory system, is a chief determinant of adequate oxygenation and decarboxylation. Calculated MP, the product of applied airway pressure and minute ventilation, may serve as an estimate of respiratory muscle workload when switching to spontaneous breathing. The aim of the study was to assess MP's discriminatory performance in predicting successful weaning from prolonged tracheostomy ventilation. METHODS: Prospective, observational study in 130 prolonged mechanically ventilated, tracheotomized patients in a specialized weaning center. Predictive weaning outcome ability of arterial blood gas analyses and indices derived from calculated MP at beginning and end of weaning was determined in terms of area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and measures derived from k-fold cross-validation (likelihood ratios, diagnostic odds ratio, F1 score, and Matthews correlation coefficient [MCC]). RESULTS: Forty-four (33.8%) patients experienced weaning failure. Absolute MP showed poor discrimination in predicting outcome; whereas specific MP (MP normalized to dynamic lung-thorax compliance, LTCdyn-MP) had moderate diagnostic accuracy (MCC 0.38; AUROC 0.79, 95%CI [0.71â0.86], p < 0.001), further improved by correction for corresponding mechanical ventilation PaCO2 (termed the power index of the respiratory system [PIrs]: MCC 0.52; AUROC 0.86 [0.79â0.92], p < 0.001). Diagnostic performance of MP indices increased over the course of weaning, with maximum accuracy immediately before completion (LTCdyn-MP: MCC 0.49; AUROC 0.86 [0.78â0.91], p < 0.001; PIrs: MCC 0.68; AUROC 0.92 [0.86â0.96], p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: MP normalized to dynamic lung-thorax compliance, a surrogate for applied power per unit of ventilated lung volume, accurately discriminated between low and high risk for weaning failure following prolonged mechanical ventilation.","Ghiani, Alessandro; Paderewska, Joanna; Walcher, Swenja; Neurohr, Claus",BMC Pulm Med,,498
366513,Putting Large-Scale Infrastructure Projects First: The COVID-19 Pandemic in Indigenous Mexico,2020,"Importance: Increasing numbers of confirmed cases and mortality rates of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are occurring in several countries and continents. Information regarding the impact of cardiovascular complication on fatal outcome is scarce. Objective: To evaluate the association of underlying cardiovascular disease (CVD) and myocardial injury with fatal outcomes in patients with COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective single-center case series analyzed patients with COVID-19 at the Seventh Hospital of Wuhan City, China, from January 23, 2020, to February 23, 2020. Analysis began February 25, 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: Demographic data, laboratory findings, comorbidities, and treatments were collected and analyzed in patients with and without elevation of troponin T (TnT) levels. Results: Among 187 patients with confirmed COVID-19, 144 patients (77%) were discharged and 43 patients (23%) died. The mean (SD) age was 58.50 (14.66) years. Overall, 66 (35.3%) had underlying CVD including hypertension, coronary heart disease, and cardiomyopathy, and 52 (27.8%) exhibited myocardial injury as indicated by elevated TnT levels. The mortality during hospitalization was 7.62% (8 of 105) for patients without underlying CVD and normal TnT levels, 13.33% (4 of 30) for those with underlying CVD and normal TnT levels, 37.50% (6 of 16) for those without underlying CVD but elevated TnT levels, and 69.44% (25 of 36) for those with underlying CVD and elevated TnTs. Patients with underlying CVD were more likely to exhibit elevation of TnT levels compared with the patients without CVD (36 [54.5%] vs 16 [13.2%]). Plasma TnT levels demonstrated a high and significantly positive linear correlation with plasma high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels (ß = 0.530, P < .001) and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels (ß = 0.613, P < .001). Plasma TnT and NT-proBNP levels during hospitalization (median [interquartile range (IQR)], 0.307 [0.094-0.600]; 1902.00 [728.35-8100.00]) and impending death (median [IQR], 0.141 [0.058-0.860]; 5375 [1179.50-25695.25]) increased significantly compared with admission values (median [IQR], 0.0355 [0.015-0.102]; 796.90 [401.93-1742.25]) in patients who died (P = .001; P < .001), while no significant dynamic changes of TnT (median [IQR], 0.010 [0.007-0.019]; 0.013 [0.007-0.022]; 0.011 [0.007-0.016]) and NT-proBNP (median [IQR], 352.20 [174.70-636.70]; 433.80 [155.80-1272.60]; 145.40 [63.4-526.50]) was observed in survivors (P = .96; P = .16). During hospitalization, patients with elevated TnT levels had more frequent malignant arrhythmias, and the use of glucocorticoid therapy (37 [71.2%] vs 69 [51.1%]) and mechanical ventilation (31 [59.6%] vs 14 [10.4%]) were higher compared with patients with normal TnT levels. The mortality rates of patients with and without use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers was 36.8% (7 of 19) and 21.4% (36 of 168) (P = .13). Conclusions and Relevance: Myocardial injury is significantly associated with fatal outcome of COVID-19, while the prognosis of patients with underlying CVD but without myocardial injury is relatively favorable. Myocardial injury is associated with cardiac dysfunction and arrhythmias. Inflammation may be a potential mechanism for myocardial injury. Aggressive treatment may be considered for patients at high risk of myocardial injury.","Guo, Tao; Fan, Yongzhen; Chen, Ming; Wu, Xiaoyan; Zhang, Lin; He, Tao; Wang, Hairong; Wan, Jing; Wang, Xinghuan; Lu, Zhibing",JAMA Cardiol,,498

366913,Family Strategy To Fulfill The Needs When COVID-19 Pandemic Disasters Occured,2020,"While plastics play an important role in the safety, shelf-life, and affordability of many foods, their mismanagement as waste presents a serious environmental problem. In 2019, governments in Canada and globally were poised to take legislative action to curb the use of single-use plastics, with strong public support. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has since disrupted those initiatives as well as the public sentiment underlying them. The aim of our study is to measure changes in Canadian consumers' attitudes toward single-use plastic food packaging, from Summer 2019 to Summer 2020. The methodology relies on two, representative surveys of the Canadian population, carried out in May 2019 (n = 1,094) and in June 2020 (n = 977). Our measures explored potential impacts on consumer perceptions, driven both by new food safety concerns during the pandemic and also by increased price consciousness during a time of economic recession. We found that 55% of respondents were more concerned about food safety since COVID-19, and that 50% of respondents had become more price conscious when buying groceries. However, we found only a slight decline in motivation to reduce plastics - though with a sharper reduction among males. A stronger shift was seen in attitudes towards policy, where our results show a clear decline in support for tighter regulations or bans on single-use plastics, along with an increase in consumers' willingness to pay for biodegradable alternatives. These findings suggest a more difficult road ahead for legislative approaches, but also potential opportunities for market-based strategies and innovations in the food sector.","Kitz, Robert; Walker, Tony; Charlebois, Sylvain; Music, Janet",International journal of consumer studies,,498

As a result, alternative therapeutics will be necessary to keep this disease under control. This review evaluates the advantages of phage therapy to treat lung bacterial infections, in particular those caused by the Gram-positive bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus, while also highlighting the regulatory impediments that hamper its clinical use and the difficulties associated with phage research.","Fernandez, L.; Cima-Cabal, M.

A sample of adults was recruited with random digit dialling, interviewed and invited for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The seroprevalence was corrected with the aid of the bivariate probit model that jointly estimated individual propensity to agree to participate in the survey and seropositivity. 66,250 individuals were contacted, 6,440 adults agreed to be interviewed and blood samples were obtained from 1,038 participants between May 27 and June 26, 2020. Naïve seroprevalence corrected for test characteristics was 9.0% (7.2-10.8) by CMIA and 10.5% (8.6-12.4) by ELISA. Correction for non-response decreased estimates to 7.4% (5.7-9.2) and 9.1% (7.2-10.9) for CMIA and ELISA, respectively. The most pronounced decrease in bias-corrected seroprevalence was attributed to the history of any illnesses in the past 3 months and COVID-19 testing. Seroconversion was negatively associated with smoking status, self-reported history of allergies and changes in hand-washing habits. These results suggest that even low estimates of seroprevalence can be an overestimation. Serosurvey design should attempt to identify characteristics that are associated both with participation and seropositivity.","Barchuk, Anton; Skougarevskiy, Dmitriy; Titaev, Kirill; Shirokov, Daniil; Raskina, Yulia; Novkunkskaya, Anastasia; Talantov, Petr; Isaev, Artur; Pomerantseva, Ekaterina; Zhikrivetskaya, Svetlana; Barabanova, Lubov; Volkov, Vadim",Sci Rep,,498
367725,The structural roots of food insecurity: How racism is a fundamental cause of food insecurity,2021,"Obesity and fatty liver steatosis are already considered metabolic risk factors which may aggravate the severity of COVID-19. This study aims to investigate the correlation between COVID-19 severity, obesity, and liver steatosis and fibrosis. 230 consecutive patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 aged between 15 and 84 years, admitted to a hospital devoted to COVID-19 patients, were enrolled in the study. COVID-19 severity was classified as severe versus non-severe based on admission to ICU. Obesity was assessed by Body Mass Index (BMI). CT-scan was used to check for the liver steatosis. Fibrosis-4 score was calculated. The study was conducted in March-May 2020. Obesity strongly and positively correlated with severe COVID-19 illness r: 0.760 (P<0.001). Hepatic steatosis had rather less of a correlation with COVID-19 severity r: 0.365 (P<0.001). Multivariable-adjusted association between hepatic steatosis or obesity, or both (as exposure) and COVID-19 severity (as the outcome) revealed increased risk of severe COVID-19 illness with obesity (Adjusted model I OR: 465.3, 95 % CI: 21.9-9873.3, P<0.001), with hepatic steatosis (Adjusted model I OR: 5.1, 95 % CI: 1.2-21.0, P<0.025), and with hepatic steatosis among obese patients (Adjusted model I OR: 132, 95 % CI: 10.3-1691.8, P<0.001). Obesity remained the most noticeable factor that strongly correlated with COVID-19 severity, more than liver steatosis. However, the risk to COVID-19 severity was greater in those with both factors: obesity and liver steatosis. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] La obesidad y la esteatosis del hígado graso ya se consideran factores de riesgo metabólico que pueden empeorar la gravedad de la COVID-19. Este estudio tiene como objetivo investigar la correlación entre la gravedad de COVID-19, la obesidad y la esteatosis y fibrosis hepática. El estudio se realizó en 230 pacientes consecutivos entre 15 y 84 años con COVID-19 confirmado por laboratorio, ingresados en un hospital dedicado a pacientes con COVID-19. La gravedad de COVID-19 se clasificó como grave, versus no grave según el ingreso a la UCI. La obesidad se evaluó mediante el índice de masa corporal (IMC). Se utilizó una tomografía computarizada para verificar la esteatosis hepática. Se calculó la puntuación de Fibrosis-4. El estudio se realizó entre marzo-mayo de 2020. La obesidad se correlacionó fuerte y positivamente con la enfermedad grave de COVID-19 r: 0,760 (P <0,001). La esteatosis hepática tuvo una correlación bastante menor con la gravedad de COVID-19 r: 0.365 (P <0.001). La asociación ajustada multivariable entre la esteatosis hepática u obesidad, o ambas (como exposición) y la gravedad de COVID-19 (como resultado) reveló un mayor riesgo de enfermedad grave por COVID-19 con obesidad (OR del modelo ajustado I: 465,3, IC del 95 %: 21,9 -9873,3, P <0,001), con esteatosis hepática (OR del modelo I ajustado: 5,1, IC del 95 %: 1,2-21,0, P <0,025) y con esteatosis hepática entre los pacientes obesos (OR del modelo I ajustado: 132, IC del 95 %: 10,3-1691,8, P <0,001). La obesidad siguió siendo el factor más notable que se correlacionó significativamente con la gravedad de COVID-19, más que la esteatosis hepática. Sin embargo, el riesgo de gravedad de COVID-19 fue mayor en aquellos con ambos factores: la obesidad y esteatosis hepática.

The COVID-19 pandemic and accompanying social distancing measures have hastened the implementation of telehealth programs in hospital systems around the globe. Here, we provide specific examples of telehealth efforts that have been implemented in a large rural healthcare system in response to the pandemic, and further describe how the massive shift to telehealth and reliance on virtual connections in these times of social isolation may impact rural health disparities for those without access to necessary broadband to deploy digital technologies. Finally, we provide recommendations for researchers and policy makers to ensure that telehealth initiatives do not amplify existing health disparities experienced by those living in rural communities.","Hirko, Kelly A; Kerver, Jean M; Ford, Sabrina; Szafranski, Chelsea; Beckett, John; Kitchen, Chris; Wendling, Andrea L",J. am. med. inform. assoc,,498
370311,The Development of Sustainable Assessment during the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Case of the English Language Program in South Korea,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic forced many higher education institutions (HEIs) across the world to cancel face-to-face teaching, close campus facilities, and displace staff and students to work and learn from home. Given the persistent nature of the pandemic, many HEIs have continued to deliver courses online and/or use a blended learning approach. However, there are concerns around differences in student access to digital learning resources while at home, including high quality broadband connectivity. This is important, since variation in connectivity may impact the type of online/blended model that faculty can deliver or constrain student engagement with online content. In this context, this paper combines national data on the domiciles of students enrolled in Irish HEIs with detailed spatial data on broadband coverage to estimate the number of higher education students ‘at risk’ of poor access to high quality internet connectivity. Overall it finds that one-in-six students come from areas with poor broadband coverage, with large disparities by geography and by HEI. It also finds that students from the poorest broadband coverage areas are more likely to be socioeconomically disadvantaged. As a result, this paper recommends that HEIs use their detailed registration data to help identify and support at-risk students. In particular, the results suggest that some HEIs may need to prioritise access to campus facilities and services to less well-off students living in poor broadband coverage areas.","Cullinan, John Flannery Darragh Harold Jason Lyons Seán Palcic Dónal",International Journal of Educational Technology in Higher Education,,498

Effective communication and management ability (Cultural Intelligence) of employees in this type of diverse and heterogeneous environment impacts behavior and performance, affecting the sustainable innovation ability of organizations. Researchers have not yet fully assessed the impact of individuals' cross-cultural management ability on sustainable innovation. Using Cultural Intelligence Theory and Trait Activation Theory, this paper discusses the influence of individual cultural intelligence on sustainable innovation behavior. The results showed that employees' cultural intelligence positively affected their sustainable innovation behavior. Employee knowledge sharing plays an mediating role between intelligence and behavior. Differences in organizational culture have a negative moderating effect on the impact of employees' cultural intelligence on knowledge sharing and sustainable innovation behaviors. The research results provide theoretical guidance for managing organizational cultural diversity and advancing cultural intelligence and sustainable innovation behaviors among employees.","Li, Jinlong; Wu, Na; Xiong, Shengxu",PLoS One,,498

374077,Relationship Between Voluntary Attendance and Academic Performance in First Year Medical Students,2021,"Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is an extremely infectious viral infection of cloven-hoofed animals which is highly challenging to control and can give rise to national animal health crises, especially if there is a lack of pre-existing immunity due to the emergence of new strains or following incursions into disease-free regions. The 2001 FMD epidemic in the UK was on a scale that initially overwhelmed the national veterinary services and was eventually controlled by livestock lockdown and slaughter on an unprecedented scale. In 2020, the rapid emergence of COVID-19 has led to a human pandemic unparalleled in living memory. The enormous logistics of multi-agency control efforts for COVID-19 are reminiscent of the 2001 FMD epidemic in the UK, as are the use of movement restrictions, not normally a feature of human disease control. The UK experience is internationally relevant as few countries have experienced national epidemic crises for both diseases. In this review, we reflect on the experiences and lessons learnt from UK and international responses to FMD and COVID-19 with respect to their management, including the challenge of preclinical viral transmission, threat awareness, early detection, different interpretations of scientific information, lockdown, biosecurity behaviour change, shortage of testing capacity and the choices for eradication versus living with infection. A major lesson is that the similarity of issues and critical resources needed to manage large-scale outbreaks demonstrates that there is benefit to a 'One Health' approach to preparedness, with potential for greater cooperation in planning and the consideration of shared critical resources.","Sumption, Keith; Knight-Jones, Theodore J D; McLaws, Melissa; Paton, David J",Proc Biol Sci,,498

This study is to investigate the psychological abnormality in health care workers battling the COVID-19 epidemic and to explore the associations among social support, resilience and mental health. A total of 1521 health care workers, of whom 147 had public health emergency experience while 1374 showed no experience, completed the Symptom Check-List-90 (SCL-90), Chinese version of Connor-Davidson resilience scale (CD-RISC) and Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS). &#967;2 test, t test and multiple regression analyses were used in statistical analysis. The results showed that people without public health emergency treatment experience showed worse performance in mental health, resilience and social support, and tended to suffer from psychological abnormality on interpersonal sensitivity and photic anxiety. This finding suggested that high levels of training and professional experience, resilience and social support were necessary to health care workers who are first taking part in public health emergence.","Cai, Wenpeng; Lian, Bin; Song, Xiangrui; Hou, Tianya; Deng, Guanghui; Li, Huifen",Asian J Psychiatr,,498

This is a challenge for culturally diverse communities as groups may have different informational needs and information-seeking behaviours. In this paper we present the frequency of information sources for COVID-19 in a culturally diverse area of Sydney, Australia. MethodsThis study reports findings from two surveys. The first recruited participants across 10 languages between March 21 and July 9, 2021. The second provides a point of reference, and was an Australian, nationally-representative sample of English-speaking participants between November 4 - 18, 2020. ResultsFor the survey in culturally and linguistically diverse communities, of 708 participants, mean age was 45.4 years (SE 0.78), and 51% of respondents were female. Across all language groups, 54.7% of participants used Australian official or public broadcasters to find out about COVID-19 (n=421). Australian commercial information sources (54.1%, n=417), social media (51.6%, n=397), and family and friends in Australia (32.7%, n=252) were common sources. Patterns varied substantially across language groups. In the nationally representative survey (n=2313), 67% of participants (n=1540) used Australian official or public broadcasters, with lower proportions for social media (31.9%, n=738) and friends, family or other personal sources (23.1%; n=533). ConclusionAlmost 50% of participants from culturally and linguistically diverse communities did not report using Australian official or public broadcaster as main sources of information. Instead Australian commercial information sources, friends and family, overseas sources and social media were common. Though a crude comparison of the two datasets, this data can guide policy decisions for communication to different community groups. Further analysis is needed to interpret this data. Better understanding of how diverse communities seek and receive COVID-19 health information is imperative as we manage the current COVID-19 outbreak in the Sydney region.","Ayre, Julie; Muscat, Danielle M; Mac, Olivia A; Batcup, Carys; Cvejic, Erin; Pickles, Kristen; Dolan, Hankiz; Bonner, Carissa; Mouwad, Dana; Zachariah, Dipti; Turalic, Una; Santalucia, Yvonne; Chen, Tingting; Vasic, Gordana; McCaffery, Kirsten J",,,498

COVID-19 has been officially declared as a universal pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). The epidemiological characteristics of COVID-2019 have not been completely understood yet. More than 200,000 persons were killed during this epidemic (till 1 May 2020). Therefore, developing forecasting models to predict the spread of that epidemic is a critical issue. In this study, statistical and artificial intelligence based approaches have been proposed to model and forecast the prevalence of this epidemic in Egypt. These approaches are autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and nonlinear autoregressive artificial neural networks (NARANN). The official data reported by The Egyptian Ministry of Health and Population of COVID-19 cases in the period between 1 March and 10 May 2020 was used to train the models. The forecasted cases showed a good agreement with officially reported cases. The obtained results of this study may help the Egyptian decision-makers to put short-term future plans to face this epidemic.","Saba, Amal I; Elsheikh, Ammar H",Process Saf Environ Prot,,498
375450,Partisan differences in physical distancing are linked to health outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"The spread of SARS-CoV-2 created a pandemic crisis with > 150,000 cumulative cases in > 65 countries within a few months. The reproductive number (R) is a metric to estimate the transmission of a pathogen during an outbreak. Preliminary published estimates were based on the initial outbreak in China. Whole genome sequences (WGS) analysis found mutational variations in the viral genome; however, previous comparisons failed to show a direct relationship between viral genome diversity, transmission, and the epidemic severity. COVID-19 incidences from different countries were modeled over the epidemic curve. Estimates of the instantaneous R (Wallinga and Teunis method) with a short and standard serial interval were done. WGS were used to determine the populations genomic variation and that underpinned creation of the pathogen genome identity (GENI) score, which was merged with the outbreak curve in four distinct phases. Inference of transmission time was based on a mutation rate of 2 mutations/month. R estimates revealed differences in the transmission and variable infection dynamics between and within outbreak progression for each country examined. Outside China, our R estimates observed propagating dynamics indicating that other countries were poised to move to the takeoff and exponential stages. Population density and local temperatures had no clear relationship to the outbreak progression. Integration of incidence data with the GENI score directly predicted increases in cases as the genome variation increased that led to new variants. Integrating the outbreak curve, dynamic R, and SNP variation found a direct association between increasing cases and transmission genome evolution. By defining the epidemic curve into four stages and integrating the instantaneous country-specific R with the GENI score, we directly connected changes in individual outbreaks based on changes in the virus genome via SNPs. This resulted in the ability to forecast potential increases in cases as well as mutations that may defeat PCR screening and the infection process. By using instantaneous R estimations and WGS, outbreak dynamics were defined to be linked to viral mutations, indicating that WGS, as a surveillance tool, is required to predict shifts in each outbreak that will provide actionable decision making information. Integrating epidemiology with genome sequencing and modeling allows for evidence-based disease outbreak tracking with predictive therapeutically valuable insights in near real time.","Bandoy, D J Darwin R; Weimer, Bart C",Sci Rep,,498

Long-term adverse outcomes have been reported with similar diseases from other coronaviruses, namely Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). Emerging evidence suggests that COVID-19 adversely affects different systems in the human body. This review summarizes the current evidence on the short-term adverse health outcomes and assesses the risk of potential long-term adverse outcomes of COVID-19. Major adverse outcomes were found to affect different body systems: immune system (including but not limited to Guillain-Barré syndrome and paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome), respiratory system (lung fibrosis and pulmonary thromboembolism), cardiovascular system (cardiomyopathy and coagulopathy), neurological system (sensory dysfunction and stroke), as well as cutaneous and gastrointestinal manifestations, impaired hepatic and renal function. Mental health in patients with COVID-19 was also found to be adversely affected. The burden of caring for COVID-19 survivors is likely to be huge.

377488,Nursing Home Education During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to impact older adults disproportionately, from severe illness and hospitalization to increased mortality risk. Concurrently, concerns about potential shortages of healthcare professionals and health supplies to address these needs have focused attention on how resources are ultimately allocated and used. Some strategies misguidedly use age as an arbitrary criterion, inappropriately disfavoring older adults. This statement represents the official policy position of the American Geriatrics Society (AGS). It is intended to inform stakeholders including hospitals, health systems, and policymakers about ethical considerations to consider when developing strategies for allocating scarce resources during an emergency involving older adults. Members of the AGS Ethics Committee collaborated with interprofessional experts in ethics, law, nursing, and medicine (including geriatrics, palliative care, emergency medicine, and pulmonology/critical care) to conduct a structured literature review and examine relevant reports. The resulting recommendations defend a particular view of distributive justice that maximizes relevant clinical factors and deemphasizes or eliminates factors placing arbitrary, disproportionate weight on advanced age. The AGS positions include (1) avoiding age per se as a means for excluding anyone from care; (2) assessing comorbidities and considering the disparate impact of social determinants of health; (3) encouraging decision makers to focus primarily on potential short-term (not long-term) outcomes; (4) avoiding ancillary criteria such as ""life-years saved"" and ""long-term predicted life expectancy"" that might disadvantage older people; (5) forming and staffing triage committees tasked with allocating scarce resources; (6) developing institutional resource allocation strategies that are transparent and applied uniformly; and (7) facilitating appropriate advance care planning. The statement includes recommendations that should be immediately implemented to address resource allocation strategies during COVID-19, aligning with AGS positions. The statement also includes recommendations for post-pandemic review. Such review would support revised strategies to ensure that governments and institutions have equitable emergency resource allocation strategies, avoid future discriminatory language and practice, and have appropriate guidance to develop national frameworks for emergent resource allocation decisions.

On December 2019, COVID-19 emerged in Wuhan, China, and has spread throughout the world. In this descriptive and analytic study Perceived discrimination of the patients admitted to COVID-19 wards was measured in medical settings. Data was collected of 176 patients discharged in March and April 2020. Discrimination scale was used to collect data in medical settings. Overall mean score of the scale was 11.51 ± 3.883 indicating low level of perceived discrimination. The highest level of discrimination belonged to refusal of physicians and nurses to physically examine the patients (0.992 ± 3.49). Low level of perceived discrimination was reported in this study, which necessitated taking useful measures to identify discrimination, determines causes and prevent discriminatory behaviors in medical settings to improve the hospitalization experience and disease outcomes.","Soleimani, Farzaneh; Aligholipour, Mahtab; Aghal, Moosa; Aliafsari Mamaghani, Ebrahim",Inquiry,,498

The research method is qualitative, exploratory, descriptive, and inductive. The study sample is made up of 43 managers of educational centers, who were selected by applying an intentional sampling based on criteria of age, experience, ownership of the center, teachings that are taught, and the socioeconomic context where it is located. A questionnaire was used to collect the information, previously designed and validated through the judgment of experts, to inquire about the organization and management from the management team, the development of the academic task with the students, and the relationship with the families during the course period of cessation of classroom activities. To make an adequate approximation to the reality studied, an exhaustive content analysis of the speeches issued by the participants was carried out. Among the main conclusions of the research are the difficulties they have experienced during the closure of schools in relation to the lack of strategic planning to reconvert face-to-face education to the online format, scarcity of technological resources in centers and homes, training deficit in digital skills, increasing the digital divide, attention to students with special educational needs or communication problems with students and their families.","López-Noguero, Fernando; Gallardo-López, José Alberto; García-Lázaro, Irene",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,498

METHODS: Single-center chart review comparing characteristics of children with 'MIS-C' and 'Severe/Critical COVID-19 infection'. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to create predictive models for predicting MIS-C. Results: Of 68 patients, 28 (41.2%) had MIS-C while 40 (58.8%) had severe/critical COVID-19 infection. MIS-C patients had a higher prevalence of fever, mucocutaneous, cardiac and gastrointestinal involvement and a lower prevalence of respiratory symptoms (P<0.05). Significantly lower hemoglobin, platelet count, serum electrolytes, and significantly elevated inflammatory and coagulation markers were observed in MIS-C cohort. Upon multivariate logistic regression, the best model included C-reactive protein (CRP), platelet count, gastrointestinal and mucocutaneus involvement and absence of respiratory involvement (performance of 0.94). Using sensitivity analysis, CRP>40mg/L with either platelet count<150x103/mm3 or mucocutaneous involvement had specificity of 97.5% to diagnose MIS-C. CONCLUSION: Elevated CRP, thrombocytopenia and mucocutaneous involvement at presentation are helpful in differentiating MIS-C from severe COVID-19.","Gupta, N.; Talathi, S.",Indian Pediatrics,,498

Millions of people have contracted the virus and a significant number of them lost their lives, resulting in a tremendous social and economic shock across the globe. Amid the growing burden of the pandemic, there are parallel emergencies that need to be simultaneously tackled: the proliferation of fake medicines, fake news and medication misinformation surrounding COVID-19. Pharmacists are key health professionals with the required skills and training to contribute to the fight against these emergencies. Primarily, they can be a relevant source of accurate and reliable information to the public or other fellow health professionals thereby reducing the spread of COVID-19 medication misinformation. This can be achieved by providing accurate and reliable information based on recommendations given by relevant health authorities and professional associations to make sure the community understand the importance of the message and thus minimise the detrimental consequences of the pandemic. This commentary aims to summarise the existing literature in relation to the promising treatments currently under trial, the perils of falsified medications and medicine-related information and the role of pharmacists in taking a leading role in combating these parallel global emergencies.","Erku, Daniel A; Belachew, Sewunet A; Abrha, Solomon; Sinnollareddy, Mahipal; Thomas, Jackson; Steadman, Kathryn J; Tesfaye, Wubshet H",Res. soc. adm. pharm,,498
378252,Will the COVID-19 Pandemic Really Change the Governance of Global Value Chains?,2020,"In Italy, in the very first phase of the COVID-19 pandemic there was a dramatic rise in mortality. However, families were forbidden because of lockdown regulations to be with their loved ones at their deathbeds or to hold funerals. This qualitative study examined bereavement experiences among family members, how they processed their grief, and how they used social networks in particular by uploading photographs during the working-through of bereavement. The sample was composed of 40 individuals aged 23-63 (80% women) from different Italian cities severely impacted by the virus, including a subgroup from the province of Bergamo, which was the city with the highest mortality rate during that time. All interviews were conducted by phone, Skype, or Zoom. Then, the transcriptions underwent a thematic analysis using Atlas.ti. The main themes that emerged were: abandonment anger and guilt, dehumanized disappeared, derealization and constant rumination, and social support and the importance of sharing photos on Facebook. Importantly, the use of social networks proved to be a valuable source of support and photographs were a powerful tool in facilitating the process of mourning by encouraging narration and sharing. Grief had a complex profile: on the one hand, it was traumatic and characterized by all the risk factors causing mourners to experience prolonged grief, but on the other, some features were similar to ambiguous loss (that occurs without closure and clear understanding) because of the impossibility to be with their relatives in their final moments. The possible relationships between ambiguous loss, the use of internet, and the risk of prolonged grief are discussed.","Testoni, I.; Azzola, C.; Tribbia, N.; Biancalani, G.; Iacona, E.; Orkibi, H.; Azoulay, B.",Frontiers in psychiatry Frontiers Research Foundation,,498

METHODS: Multivariate logistic regression model and Kaplan-Meier survival curves were fitted to study odds of death of characteristics and comorbidities in patients with COVID-19 in Mexico. RESULTS: Age, sex, and the most frequent comorbidities diabetes, obesity, and hypertension were significantly associated to the risk of death by COVID-19 (P < .0001). Smoking habit was not identified as a risk factor for death. Less-frequent comorbidities such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, and patients with immunosuppressed conditions also showed a significant risk for death (P < .0001). Hospitalized patients and those with pneumonia had serious risks for mortality (P < .0001), and more attention to specific conditions might be considered during clinical admission. CONCLUSIONS: A more vulnerable positive patient is depicted by a male patient, older than 41 years, which increases their risk with more prevalent comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, and obesity. Some implications on outcomes are discussed.","Parra-Bracamonte, Gaspar Manuel; Lopez-Villalobos, Nicolas; Parra-Bracamonte, Francisco E",Ann. epidemiol,,498

We aim to investigate the immunological characteristics of monocytes in critical patients with COVID-19. METHODS: The number and immune status of monocytes were detected by flow cytometry in 32 COVID-19 patients and 18 healthy individuals. RESULTS: In critical patients with COVID-19, the absolute number of total monocytes and CD16- monocytes was significantly decreased but CD16+ pro-inflammatory monocytes was increased compared to healthy controls. Antigen presentation potential of monocytes, as measured by HLA-DR expression, was suppressed, while their inflammatory phenotype (CD38 expression) was enhanced. Cytokine levels showed sustained increases in critical patients. And the levels of IL-6 were positively correlated with CD16+ monocytes number. IL-6 and IL-10 levels were negatively correlated with HLA-DR expression of monocytes. During the recovery of COVID-19 patients, the count and immune status of monocyte subsets were restored by degrees. HLA-DR+ monocytes possessed good sensitivity and specificity for predicting the incidence of critical patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: In critical patients with COVID-19, decline in number and HLA-DR expression of monocytes might lead to decreased antigen presentation potential and thus immunosuppression, while increased CD16+ pro-inflammatory monocytes might mediate hyperinflammation. HLA-DR+ monocytes might be a meaningful assisted indicator to predict the incidence of critical patients with COVID-19.","Qin, Shuang; Jiang, Yujie; Wei, Xin; Liu, Xiaoyuan; Guan, Jingjing; Chen, Yingxiao; Lu, Hong; Qian, Jingjing; Wang, Zhongyong; Lin, Xiangyang",Hum Immunol,,498

When these people live alone, it is convenient that a caregiver or family member visits them periodically. However, these visits do not prevent falls when the elderly person is alone. Furthermore, in exceptional circumstances, such as a pandemic, we must avoid unnecessary mobility. This is why remote monitoring systems are currently on the rise, and several commercial solutions can be found. However, current solutions use devices attached to the waist or wrist, causing discomfort in the people who wear them. The users also tend to forget to wear the devices carried in these positions. Therefore, in order to prevent these problems, the main objective of this work is designing and recollecting a new dataset about falls, falling risks and activities of daily living using an ankle-placed device obtaining a good balance between the different activity types. This dataset will be a useful tool for researchers who want to integrate the fall detector in the footwear. Thus, in this work we design the fall-detection device, study the suitable activities to be collected, collect the dataset from 21 users performing the studied activities and evaluate the quality of the collected dataset. As an additional and secondary study, we implement a simple Deep Learning classifier based on this data to prove the system's feasibility.","Luna-Perejón, Francisco; Muñoz-Saavedra, Luis; Civit-Masot, Javier; Civit, Anton; Domínguez-Morales, Manuel",Sensors (Basel),,498

Several health care institutions, including ours, SUNY-Downstate Health Science University in Brooklyn, New York, were designated as COVID-only hospitals. At the same time, patients with other serious illnesses refrained from seeking medical care because of the fear of contracting the virus at the health care facilities. In this report, we present a case of an octogenarian woman with breast cancer who was treated initially with radical mastectomy and chemotherapy, who then developed back pain in mid-March 2020, that later progressed to bilateral lower extremity weakness secondary to cord compression, which was diagnosed nearly 4 weeks after her initial symptoms started.

To battle this spread, clinical imaging techniques, for example, computed tomography (CT), can be utilized for diagnosis. Automatic identification software tools are essential for helping to screen COVID-19 using CT images. However, there are few datasets available, making it difficult to train deep learning (DL) networks. To address this issue, a generative adversarial network (GAN) is proposed in this work to generate more CT images. The Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) is used to optimize the hyperparameters of GAN's generator. The proposed method is tested and validated with different classification and meta-heuristics algorithms using the SARS-CoV-2 CT-Scan dataset, consisting of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 images. The performance metrics of the proposed optimized model, including accuracy (99.22%), sensitivity (99.78%), specificity (97.78%), F1-score (98.79%), positive predictive value (97.82%), and negative predictive value (99.77%), as well as its confusion matrix and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, indicate that it performs better than state-of-the-art methods.

Design/Methodology/Approach: To achieve the assumed research aim, an econometric power panel model illustrating the interdependencies between the natural logarithms of the CEE countries' outward FDI per capita stocks values and the levels of natural logarithms of their explanatory variables, which were the key home country's institutional factors, during or at the end of the years 2004-2018, that constituted a balanced data panel, were used. The slope coefficients of the model indicated the percentage change the dependent variable (i.e., the value of the OFDI stocks of CEE countries growth pace) changes if a given exogenous institutional variable decreases or grows by 1.0%, which enables to determine if the scale of outward FDI from the CEE region was significantly determined in the examined period by the considered key home country's institutional factors. Findings: The empirical results show that the home country's institutional factors determine OFDI stocks' scale from the CEE countries. Practical Implications: Improving the quality of the institutional environment of the country of origin of FDI would contribute to increasing the scale of foreign capital expansion of enterprises from the CEE region. Originality/value: The conducted study enabled to indicate the key directions of possible future improvements in the institutional environment of CEE enterprises, which would enable to significantly increase the scale of their foreign capital expansion, which would result in the growth of their exports that in turn would result in their further economic development, which was the case of many other well developed, as well as emerging economies.

382864,Lessons learned while creating an effective emergency remote learning environment for students during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"The recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 causing the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is particularly virulent in the elderly while children are largely spared. Here, we explored the potential role of cross-reactive immunity acquired from pediatric vaccinations and exposure to common human pathogens in the protection and pathology of COVID-19. To that end, we sought for peptide matches to SARS-CoV-2 (identity &#8805; 80%, in at least eight residues) in the proteomes of 25 human pathogens and in vaccine antigens, and subsequently predicted their T and B cell reactivity to identify potential cross-reactive epitopes. We found that viruses subject to pediatric vaccinations do not contain cross-reactive epitopes with SARS-CoV-2, precluding that they can provide any general protection against COVID-19. Likewise, common viruses including rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza virus, and several herpesviruses are also poor or null sources of cross-reactive immunity to SARS-CoV-2, discarding that immunological memory against these viruses can have any general protective or pathological role in COVID-19. In contrast, we found combination vaccines for treating diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis infectious diseases (DTP vaccine) to be significant sources of potential cross-reactive immunity to SARS-CoV-2. DTP cross-reactive epitopes with SARS-CoV-2 include numerous CD8 and CD4 T cell epitopes with broad population protection coverage and potentially neutralizing B cell epitopes in SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. Worldwide, children receive several DTP vaccinations, including three-four doses the first year of life and one at 4-6 years of age. Moreover, a low antigenic Tdap dose is also given at ages 9-14.

383723,Evaluating Social Distancing Measures and Their Association with the Covid-19 Pandemic in South America,2021,"This article provides the findings of an exploratory, qualitative study on distance learning policies and practices from a purposeful sample of five California school districts and 25 district and school leaders with large numbers and/or larger percentages of current or former English Learners. To understand the extent to which leaders address English Learners’/Emergent Bilinguals’ (EL/EM) needs during the pandemic, we posed the following research question: What are leaders’ local policies and practices in designing and implementing distance learning to promote equity for English Learners? We gathered three key district policy documents across three moments during the pandemic: (1) COVID-19 Operations Written Reports (Spring 2020), (2) School Reopening Plans (Summer 2020), and (3) Learning Continuity and Attendance Plans (Fall 2020). We also conducted interviews and triangulated data sources using grounded theory to analyze and understand how equity is framed and implemented. Data triangulation and iterative rounds of coding allowed us to identify three inter-related findings: (1) leading in the crisis of connectivity and bridging the digital divide;(2) maximizing diverse ELs’ learning experiences;and, (3) building from collaborative leadership cultures to collaborative virtual leadership cultures. Using these key findings, we conceptualized the framework for equity leadership for English Learners to address the needs of this underserved population. We conclude with a call for further examination, in both leadership preparation as well as in policy implementation research. © Copyright © 2021 Lavadenz, Kaminski, Armas and López.","Lavadenz, M.; Kaminski, L.

COVID-19 is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which spreads effectively by direct contact with an infected person or contaminated surface, droplet or aerosol transmission. Vertical transmission, if it does occur, is rare. Among women of childbearing age, most will have mild or asymptomatic infection; severe illness is uncommon. Severe illness is more common in the later stages of pregnancy, when it is associated with complications, including intensive care admission, maternal death and an increased risk of iatrogenic preterm birth. Women who are older, from minority ethnic groups, who are overweight or obese, who have comorbidities or who live with socioeconomic deprivation are more likely to experience severe illness than women without these characteristics.","Jardine, Jennifer; Morris, Edward","Best pract. res., Clin. obstet. gynaecol",,498
383950,Turning around a medical education conference: Ottawa 2020 in the time of COVID-19,2020,"OBJECTIVES: Investment in digital interventions for mental health conditions is growing rapidly, offering the potential to elevate systems that are currently overstretched. Despite a growing literature on economic evaluation of digital mental health interventions (DMHIs), including several systematic reviews, there is no conclusive evidence regarding their cost-effectiveness. This paper reviews the methodology used to determine their cost-effectiveness and assesses whether this meets the requirements for decision-making. In doing so we consider the challenges specific to the economic evaluation of DMHIs, and identify where consensus and possible further research is warranted. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted to identify all economic evaluations of DMHIs published between 1997 and December 2018. The searches included databases of published and unpublished research, reference lists and citations of all included studies, forward citations on all identified protocols and conference abstracts, and contacting authors researchers in the field. The identified studies were critiqued against a published set of requirements for decision-making in healthcare, identifying methodological challenges and areas where consensus is required. RESULTS: The review identified 67 papers evaluating DMHIs. The majority of the evaluations were conducted alongside trials, failing to capture all relevant available evidence and comparators, and long-term impact of mental health disorders. The identified interventions are complex and heterogeneous. As a result, there are a number of challenges specific to their evaluation, including estimation of all costs and outcomes, conditional on analysis viewpoint, and identification of relevant comparators. A taxonomy for DMHIs may be required to inform what interventions can reasonably be pooled and compared. CONCLUSIONS: This study represents the first attempt to understand the appropriateness of the methodologies used to evaluate the value for money of DMHIs, helping work towards consensus and methods' harmonisation on these complex interventions.","Jankovic, Dina; Bojke, Laura; Marshall, David; Saramago Goncalves, Pedro; Churchill, Rachel; Melton, Hollie; Brabyn, Sally; Gega, Lina",Appl. health econ. health policy,,498

However, the rapid stream of decision-making could be costly in terms of the democratic representativeness. The aim of the paper is to investigate the trade-off between pluralism of preferences and the time required to approach a decision. To this aim we develop and test a modified version of the Hegselmann and Krause (2002) model to capture these two characteristics of the decisional process in different institutional contexts. Using a twofold geometrical institutional setting, we simulate the impact of disease outbreaks to check whether countries exhibits idiosyncratic effects, depending on their institutional frameworks. Main findings show that the degree of pluralism in political decisions is not necessarily associated with worse performances in managing emergencies, provided that the political debate is mature enough.","Biondo, A.

386282,Inside out and outside in: How the COVID-19 pandemic affects self-disclosure on social media,2020,"PURPOSE: Obstructive Meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) is one of the leading causes of evaporative dry eye disease. Meibomian glands at the eyelid secrete lipids that prevent evaporation of the aqueous tear film. The pathogenesis of obstructive MGD is incompletely understood to date. Herein, we aim to investigate the pathogenesis of obstructive MGD using murine and human samples with various forms of ocular surface inflammation. METHOD: The presence of Neutrophil extracellular Traps (NETs) was detected with immunofluorescence analysis of ocular surface discharge and biopsy samples from patients with blepharitis. Tear fluid from patients with MGD and blepharitis were evaluated for the presence of inflammatory mediators using bead based immunoassay. Murine model of allergic eye disease (AED) was performed to investigate the role of NETs in MG occlusion. RESULTS: we show that the ocular discharge from patients with blepharitis contains aggregated neutrophil extracellular traps (aggNETs). Furthermore, the ducts of human Meibomian glands affected by blepharitis were largely congested by aggNETs. Tear fluid from patients with MGD showed elevated neutrophil chemoattractants (C5a, IL6, IL8 and IL18). C5a and IL8 correlated with the degree of deficiency of tear fluid. In the murine model of allergic eye disease (AED), aggNETs accumulated in the MG leading to occlusion of their ducts and the retrograde pent-up of the fluid followed by acinar atrophy. Constraining aggNET formation by genetic or pharmacological inhibition of peptidyl arginine deiminase type 4 (PADI4) effectively reduced MG damage. CONCLUSION: We conclude that aggNETs occlude MG causing MGD after ocular surface inflammation.","Mahajan, Aparna; Hasíková, Lenka; Hampel, Ulrike; Grüneboom, Anika; Shan, Xiaomei; Herrmann, Irmgard; Garreis, Fabian; Bock, Felix; Knopf, Jasmin; Singh, Jeeshan; Schauer, Christine; Mahajan, Siddharth; Leppkes, Moritz; Paulsen, Friedrich; Schlötzer-Schrehardt, Ursula; Krenn, Veit; Jünemann, Anselm; Hohberger, Bettina; Schett, Georg; Herrmann, Martin; Muñoz, Luis E",Ocul Surf,,498
386303,Oppinions of Students for Their Sport Activity during Covid-19 Pandemic - Case of Students from Teaching Faculty in Stip,2020,"COVID-19 is a global crisis where India is going to be one of the most heavily affected countries. The variability in the distribution of COVID-19-related health outcomes might be related to many underlying variables, including demographic, socioeconomic, or environmental pollution related factors. The global and local models can be utilized to explore such relations. In this study, ordinary least square (global) and geographically weighted regression (local) methods are employed to explore the geographical relationships between COVID-19 deaths and different driving factors. It is also investigated whether geographical heterogeneity exists in the relationships. More specifically, in this paper, the geographical pattern of COVID-19 deaths and its relationships with different potential driving factors in India are investigated and analysed. Here, better knowledge and insights into geographical targeting of intervention against the COVID-19 pandemic can be generated by investigating the heterogeneity of spatial relationships. The results show that the local method (geographically weighted regression) generates better performance ([Formula: see text]) with smaller Akaike Information Criterion (AICc [Formula: see text]) as compared to the global method (ordinary least square). The GWR method also comes up with lower spatial autocorrelation (Moran's [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text]) in the residuals. It is found that more than 86% of local [Formula: see text] values are larger than 0.60 and almost 68% of [Formula: see text] values are within the range 0.80-0.97.

The impact of preventive measures on daily activity of a radiotherapy facility may hamper the ability to fulfill normal workload burden. Thus, we assessed the number of delivered treatments in a specific observation period after the adoption of preventive measures (since March 11 to April 24, 2020) and compared it with the corresponding period of the year 2019. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Overall number of delivered fractions was related to actual time of platform daily activity and reported as a ratio between number of delivered fractions and activity hours (Fr/Hrs). Fr/Hrs were calculated and compared for two different periods of time, March 11-April 24, 2019 (Fr/Hrs1), and March 11-April 24, 2020 (Fr/Hrs2). RESULTS: Fr/Hrs1 and Fr/Hrs2 were 2.66 and 2.54 for year 2019 and 2020, respectively, for a Fr/Hrsratio of 1.07 (95% CI 1.03-1.12, p = 0.0005). Fr/Hrs1 was significantly higher than Fr/Hrs2 for SliR and PreciseR, with Fr/Hrsratio of 1.92 (95% CI 1.66-2.23, p < 0.0001) and 1.11 (95% CI 1.03-1.2, p = 0.003), respectively. No significant difference was reported for SynergyR and CyberknifeR with Fr/Hrsratio of 0.99 (95% CI 0.91-1.08, p = 0.8) and 0.9 (95% CI 0.77-1.06, p = 0.2), respectively. Fr/Hrs1 was significantly lower than Fr/Hrs2 for TomotherapyR, with Fr/Hrsratio of 0.88 (95% CI 0.8-0.96, p = 0.007). CONCLUSION: Preventive measures did not influence workload burden performed.

DESIGN: Three cross-sectional surveys. PARTICIPANTS: Individuals who participated in the Swiss Health Surveys 2007, 2012 and 2017. We calculated the proportion reporting influenza vaccination in the last 12 months, and performed multivariable logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: We included 51 582 individuals in this analysis. The median age was 49 years (IQR 25-64), and 27 518 were women (53.3%). The proportion of reporting a history of influenza vaccination overall was 31.9% (95% CI 31.4 to 32.4); and dropped from 34.5% in 2007 to 28.8% in 2017. The uptake of vaccination within the past 12 months was 16% in 2007 and similar in 2012 and 2017 (around 14%). In people with chronic disease, uptake dropped from 43.8% in 2007 to 37.1% in 2012 and to 31.6% in 2017 (p<0.001). In people aged &#8805;65 years, uptake dropped from 47.8% in 2007 to 38.5% in 2012 to 36.2% in 2017 (p<0.001). In logistic regression, self-reported vaccination coverage decreased in the 65-75 years old (adjusted OR (aOR) 0.56, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.66 between 2007 and 2012; aOR 0.89, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.03 between 2012 and 2017). Uptake was positively associated with the &#8805;65 age group, living in French-speaking and urban areas, history of smoking, bad self-reported health status, private/semiprivate health insurance, having a medical profession and having any underlying chronic disease.

The aim of the study was to determine whether these patients have worse outcomes with COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study between 1 March and 30 April 2020 to assess the importance of vitamin D deficiency in older patients with COVID-19. The cohort consisted of patients aged &#8805;65 years presenting with symptoms consistent with COVID-19 (n=105). All patients were tested for serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels during acute illness. Diagnosis of COVID-19 was confirmed via viral reverse transcriptase PCR swab or supporting radiological evidence. COVID-19-positive arm (n=70) was sub-divided into vitamin D-deficient (&#8804;30 nmol/L) (n=39) and -replete groups (n=35). Subgroups were assessed for disease severity using biochemical, radiological and clinical markers. Primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were laboratory features of cytokine storm, thoracic imaging changes and requirement of non-invasive ventilation (NIV). RESULTS: COVID-19-positive arm demonstrated lower median serum 25(OH)D level of 27 nmol/L (IQR=20-47 nmol/L) compared with COVID-19-negative arm, with median level of 52 nmol/L (IQR=31.5-71.5 nmol/L) (p value=0.0008). Among patients with vitamin D deficiency, there was higher peak D-dimer level (1914.00 µgFEU/L vs 1268.00 µgFEU/L) (p=0.034) and higher incidence of NIV support and high dependency unit admission (30.77% vs 9.68%) (p=0.042). No increased mortality was observed between groups. CONCLUSION: Older adults with vitamin D deficiency and COVID-19 may demonstrate worse morbidity outcomes. Vitamin D status may be a useful prognosticator.","Baktash, Vadir; Hosack, Tom; Patel, Nishil; Shah, Shital; Kandiah, Pirabakaran; Van Den Abbeele, Koenraad; Mandal, Amit K J; Missouris, Constantinos G",Postgrad. med. j,,498

METHODS: A survey of 70 chest CTs of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed COVID-19 positive and COVID-19 negative patients was distributed to three groups of participating radiologists: five fellowship-trained chest radiologists, five nonchest fellowship-trained radiologists, and five fifth-year radiology residents. The survey asked participants to broadly classify the findings of each chest CT into one of the four RSNA COVID-19 imaging categories, then select which imaging features led to their categorization. A 1-week washout period followed by a second survey comprised of randomly selected exams from the initial survey was given to the participating radiologists. RESULTS: There was moderate overall interobserver agreement in each group (&#954; coefficient range 0.45-0.52 ± 0.02). There was substantial overall intraobserver agreement across the chest and nonchest groups (&#954; coefficient range 0.61-0.67 ± 0.06) and moderate overall intraobserver agreement within the resident group (&#954; coefficient 0.58 ± 0.06). For the image features that led to categorization, there were varied levels of agreement in the interobserver and intraobserver components that ranged from fair to perfect kappa values. When assessing agreement with PCR-confirmed COVID status as the key, we observed moderate overall agreement within each group. CONCLUSION: Our results support the reliability of the RSNA consensus classification system for COVID-19-related image findings.","Hadied, Mohamad O; Patel, Parth Y; Cormier, Peter; Poyiadji, Neo; Salman, Mariam; Klochko, Chad; Nadig, Jeffrey; Song, Thomas; Peterson, Ed; Reeser, Nick",Acad Radiol,,498
388869,Predictors of CPAP outcome in hospitalized COVID-19 patients,2020,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a serious public health concern, with an exponentially growing number of patients worldwide. Computed tomography (CT) has been suggested as a highly sensitive modality for the diagnosis of pulmonary involvement in the early stages of COVID-19. The typical features of COVID-19 in chest CT include bilateral, peripheral, and multifocal ground-glass opacities with or without superimposed consolidations. Patients with underlying medical conditions are at higher risks of complications and mortality. The diagnosis of COVID-19 on the basis of the imaging features may be more challenging in patients with preexisting cardiothoracic conditions, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, interstitial lung disease, cardiovascular disease, and malignancies with cardiothoracic involvement.

Due its high morbility and mortality, it is necessary to summarize the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients to provide more theoretical basis for future treatment. In the current study, we conducted a retrospective analysis of the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients and explored the risk factors for the severity of illness. A total of 101 COVID-19 patients hospitalized in Leishenshan Hospital (Wuhan, China) was classified into three sub-types: moderate (n = 47), severe (n = 36), and critical (n = 18); their clinical data were collected from the Electronic Medical Record. We showed that among the 101 COVID-19 patients, the median age was 62 years (IQR 51-74); 50 (49.5%) patients were accompanied by hypertension, while 25 (24.8%) and 22 (21.8%) patients suffered from diabetes and heart diseases, respectively, with complications. All patients were from Wuhan who had a definite history of exposure to the epidemic area. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that older age, diabetes, chronic liver disease, percentage of neutrophils (N%) > 75%, CRP > 4 mg/L, D-dimer > 0.55 mg/L, IL-2R > 710 U/mL, IL-8 > 62 pg/mL, and IL-10 > 9.1 pg/mL were independent variables associated with severe COVID-19. In conclusion, we have identified the independent risk factors for the severity of COVID-19 pneumonia, including older age, diabetes, chronic liver disease, higher levels of N%, CRP, D-dimer, IL-2R, IL-8, and IL-10, providing evidence for more accurate risk prediction.","Liu, Xue-Qing; Xue, Shan; Xu, Jia-Bo; Ge, Heng; Mao, Qing; Xu, Xin-Hui; Jiang, Han-Dong",Acta pharmacol.

This research often focuses on article headlines shown in artificial testing environments, yet misinformation largely spreads through images and video posts shared in highly-personalized platform contexts. A foundation of qualitative research is necessary to begin filling this gap to ensure platforms' visual misinformation interventions are aligned with users' needs and understanding of information in their personal contexts, across platforms. In two studies, we combined in-depth interviews (n=15) with diary and co-design methods (n=23) to investigate how a broad mix of Americans exposed to misinformation during COVID-19 understand their visual information environments, including encounters with interventions such as Facebook fact-checking labels. Analysis reveals a deep division in user attitudes about platform labeling interventions for visual information which are perceived by many as overly paternalistic, biased, and punitive. Alongside these findings, we discuss our methods as a model for continued independent qualitative research on cross-platform user experiences of misinformation that inform interventions.","Saltz, Emily; Leibowicz, Claire; Wardle, Claire",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.12758v2.pdf,498

MATERIALS AND METHODS: the ESTRO NS committee launched a survey addressed to all European National Societies, available online from June 5th to October 30th 2018. Questions were divided into three main sections: 1. general information about NS; 2. relevant activities (to understand the landscape of each NS context of action); 3. relevant needs (to understand how ESTRO can support the NS). Eighty-nine European NS were invited to participate. Respondents were asked to rank ESTRO milestones in order of importance, indicating the level of priority to their society. RESULTS: a total of 58 out of 89 NS (65.2%) from 31 European countries completed the questionnaire. The majority of NS ranked ""Optimal patient care to cure cancer and to reduce treatment-related toxicity"" as the highest level of priority. This aligns well with the ESTRO vision 2030 ""Optimal health for all together."" NS also indicated a high need for more consensus guidelines and exchange of best practices, access to high quality accredited education, implementation of the ESTRO School Core Curriculum at the national level, and defining quality indicators and standard in Radiation Oncology, improved communication and increased channelling of information. CONCLUSION: The results of this survey will be used to strengthen the relations between ESTRO and European NS to promote and develop initiatives to improve cancer care.","Garibaldi, Cristina; Jornet, Nuria; Tee Tan, Li; Boejen, Annette; Franco, Pierfrancesco; Bussink, Johan; Troost, Esther G C; Bak, Bartosz; Emmanuel Bibault, Jean; Dzhugashvili, Maia; Van den Berghe, Ludwig; Fizaine, Lara; Leci, Arta; Ricardi, Umberto; Alicja Jereczek-Fossa, Barbara",Radiother. oncol,,498

Besides, social media platforms and technological advances also appear to be another potential tool for promoting health and wellbeing, however, the capability of these interventions during the pandemic era is largely unknown. To explore the possible role of technological advances and social media platforms as an alternate tool in promoting a healthy living style during the COVID-19 era. The studies with the predefined criteria were used to synthesize information regarding the opportunities and challenges. Studies delivering lifestyle intervention using social media platforms, technologies for health promotion were considered for the review. The studies included to synthesize evidence were randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews and meta-analysis.

394721,Dealing with COVID-19,2020,"Introduction: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by novel coronavirus Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It was initially identified as the cause of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China and has now rapidly spread throughout the world causing a pandemic. Although, 81% of patients have mild disease (pneumonia), 14% could have severe disease leading to hospitalization and 5% end up in intensive care unit. The mortality of patients in ICU is variable and has been reported to be as high as 80%, particularly the patient who require intubation. Not much is known about the factors leading to progression of hospitalized patient needing ICU care and the predictors of mortality among ICU patients. We did the univariate followed by multivariate logistic regression analysis to determine the predictors of mortality in ICU. Method: Retrospective data were collected from consecutive 101 patients admitted from March, 2020 to June, 2020. Data were collected from 5 different community hospitals in Eastern Virginia with varied demographics. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression was done to determine the factors associated with progression of hospitalized patient to ICU and the predictors of mortality in ICU. Result: Total 101 consecutive hospitalized patients in 5 community hospitals in Eastern Virginia were enrolled in the study. Total 52/101 patients were admitted into the ICU for respiratory failure. Of these, 40 patients required intubation and mechanical ventilation. Altogether, 32/52 patients died. Of these 32 patients, 25 had required intubation. Total 22/25 (88%) intubated patients passed away while 3 were successfully extubated. Of these 32 patients, one had mild ARDS, 6 had moderate ARDS and 18 had severe ARDS. Patients aged 60 years and above accounted for &gt;2/3rd of the cases in ICU;mortality rate was higher in this age group as well. The inflammatory markers (CRP, D-dimer, Ferritin) peaked on day 8. The medications like Hydroxychloroquine, Azithromycin, Tocilizumab and Remdesivir did not alter the outcomes. Logistic regression analysis (univariate and multivariate) were done in the patients to determine the predictors of ICU admission from floor or ED. Logistic regression analysis was also done in the patients admitted to the ICU to look for the predictors of mortality. Conclusion: Based on logistic regression, none of the demographics (age, sex, race), symptoms, laboratory findings, chest imaging, ventilator settings or treatment identified the predictors of mortality in ICU in patients with COVID 19.","Pathak, V.; Conklin, C.",American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,,498

This has meant a quick transformation of the curriculum and learning styles to a digital platform. Despite the dramatic change, there is a lack of understanding about what this means particularly for the community of entrepreneurship educators in the higher education sector that rely on practical and immersive training for learning requirements. Design/methodology/approach: This paper is a literature review that discusses how communities of entrepreneurship education practitioners can deal with the Covid-19 pandemic. A review of the current literature on Covid-19 and entrepreneurship education is conducted that highlights the need to incorporate a community approach. This enables a better understanding about how communities of educational stakeholders including teachers, students and institutions can facilitate a more proactive and positive attitude. Findings: The paper finds that managing the Covid-19 crisis is difficult for entrepreneurship educations due to the need for practical and real life examples. This means the use of augmented reality and artificial intelligence is needed to simulate the real environment. This will enable a more community orientated approach to the study and practice of entrepreneurship. Originality/value: This paper is among the first to suggest how this change has taken place and what it means for educational management, thereby providing a unique and timely commentary about how coronavirus has altered in positive and negative ways entrepreneurship education.","Ratten, Vanessa",J.

RECENT FINDINGS: The prevalence of depression seems to be increasing in the general population.It is likely that depression will be even more of a problem for CVD patients in the post-COVID-19 pandemic era.New studies confirm the independent association of depression with later incident CVD, although perhaps not as strong as suggested by some previous studies.Depression seems to be becoming even more prevalent in CVD patients, with new data for stroke and peripheral arterial disease patients.Cardiologists rarely screen for depression and most do not believe that they have a responsibility for detecting or treating depression.There are new data suggesting that patients who are more in control of their lives have better outcomes and that change is possible. SUMMARY: Depression is preventable and treatable. It is imperative to detect and manage depression in CVD patients. Additional research is required to see whether or not comprehensive patient screening for depression translates into both better quality of life and improved clinical outcomes.","Hare, David L",Curr Opin Lipidol,,498

METHODS: This prospective study included 204 patients from a single tertiary-care hospital, hospitalized with COVID-19, of whom 102 were treated with CP administration and standard care (PG) and 102 others who received standard care only (CG). The CG was selected from 336 hospitalized patients using the propensity-score matching (PSM) technique using age, MEWS score, and comorbidities. The primary outcome was mortality rate; secondary outcomes were the requirement of a ventilator, length of ventilator need, length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and length of overall hospital confinement. Additionally, parameters predicting death in COVID-19 patients were identified. RESULTS: Findings confirmed a significantly lower mortality rate in the PG versus the CG (13.7% vs. 34.3 %, p = 0.001) and a significant difference in the cumulative incidence of death between the two groups (p < 0.001). CP treatment was associated with lower risk of death (OR = 0.25 CI95 [0.06; 0.91], p = 0.041). There were no significant differences in ICU stay, ventilator time, and hospitalization time between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: A significantly lower mortality rate was observed in the group of patients treated with CP. Age, presence of cardiac insufficiency, active cancer, a ventilator requirement, and length of hospitalization significantly increased the risk of death in both groups. Our study shows that CP affords better outcomes when administrated in the earlier stage of high-risk COVID-19 disease.","Tworek, Adam; Jaron, Krzysztof; Uszynska-Kaluza, Beata; Rydzewski, Andrzej; Gil, Robert; Deptala, Andrzej; Franek, Edward; Wójtowicz, Rafal; Zycinska, Katarzyna; Walecka, Irena; Cicha, Malgorzata; Wierzba, Waldemar; Zaczynski, Artur; Król, Zbigniew J; Rydzewska, Grazyna",Int J Infect Dis,,498

Here, we compared the analytical performance and clinical reliability of Allplex™ SARS-CoV-2/FluA/FluB/RSV (SC2FabR;Seegene Inc., Seoul, South Korea) kit with those of four commercially available RV detection kits. Upon testing five target viral strains (SARS-CoV-2, FluA, FluB, RSV A, and RSV B), the analytical performance of SC2FabR was similar to that of the other kits, with no significant difference (p ≥ 0.78) in z-scores. The efficiency of SC2FabR (E-value, 81–104%) enabled reliable SARS-CoV-2 and seasonal RV detection in 888 nasopharyngeal swab specimens processed using a fully automated nucleic acid extraction platform. Bland–Altman analyses revealed an agreement value of 95.4% (SD ± 1.96) for the kits, indicating statistically similar results for all five. In conclusion, SC2FabR is a rapid and accurate diagnostic tool for both SARS-CoV-2 and seasonal RV detection, allowing for high-throughput RV analysis with efficiency comparable to that of commercially available kits. This can be used to help manage respiratory infections in patients during and after the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.","Lim, Ho-Jae Park Jung-Eun Park Min-Young Baek Joo-Hwan Jung Sunkyung Sung Nackmoon Yang Jae-Hyun Lee Min-Woo Lee Sun-Hwa Yang Yong-Jin",Diagnostics,,498
400625,"Ignoring ""Stay at Home!"" ...the Life and Times of the Frontline CRNA During a Pandemic",2020,"Ultralight bosonic fields are compelling dark-matter candidates and arise in a variety of beyond-Standard-Model scenarios. These fields can tap energy and angular momentum from spinning black holes through superradiant instabilities, during which a macroscopic bosonic condensate develops around the black hole. Striking features of this phenomenon include gaps in the spin-mass distribution of astrophysical black holes and a continuous gravitational-wave~(GW) signal emitted by the condensate. So far these processes have been studied in great detail for scalar fields and, more recently, for vector fields. Here we take an important step forward in the black-hole superradiance program by computing, analytically, the instability time scale, the direct GW emission, and the stochastic background, in the case of massive tensor (i.e., spin-$2$) fields. Our analysis is valid for any black hole spin and for small boson masses. The instability of massive spin-$2$ fields shares some properties with the scalar and vector cases, but its phenomenology is much richer, for example there exist multiple modes with comparable instability time scales, and the dominant GW signal is hexadecapolar rather than quadrupolar. Electromagnetic and GW observations of spinning black holes in the mass range $M\in(1,10^{10})M_\odot$ can be turned into a bound $10^{-10}\,{\rm eV/c^2}\lesssim m_b\lesssim 10^{-22}\,{\rm eV/c^2}$ on the mass of a putative spin-$2$ field. For $10^{-17}\,{\rm eV/c^2}\lesssim m_b\lesssim 10^{-15}\,{\rm eV/c^2}$, the space mission LISA could detect the continuous GW signal for sources at redshift $z=20$, or even larger.","Brito, Richard; Grillo, Sara; Pani, Paolo",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.04055v1.pdf,498

The covid19-nmr consortium seeks to support drug development by providing publicly accessible NMR data on the viral RNA elements and proteins. The SARS-CoV-2 genome encodes for approximately 30 proteins, among them are the 16 so-called non-structural proteins (Nsps) of the replication/transcription complex. The 217-kDa large Nsp3 spans one polypeptide chain, but comprises multiple independent, yet functionally related domains including the viral papain-like protease. The Nsp3e sub-moiety contains a putative nucleic acid-binding domain (NAB) with so far unknown function and consensus target sequences, which are conceived to be both viral and host RNAs and DNAs, as well as protein-protein interactions. Its NMR-suitable size renders it an attractive object to study, both for understanding the SARS-CoV-2 architecture and drugability besides the classical virus' proteases. We here report the near-complete NMR backbone chemical shifts of the putative Nsp3e NAB that reveal the secondary structure and compactness of the domain, and provide a basis for NMR-based investigations towards understanding and interfering with RNA- and small-molecule-binding by Nsp3e.","Korn, Sophie M; Dhamotharan, Karthikeyan; Fürtig, Boris; Hengesbach, Martin; Löhr, Frank; Qureshi, Nusrat S; Richter, Christian; Saxena, Krishna; Schwalbe, Harald; Tants, Jan-Niklas; Weigand, Julia E; Wöhnert, Jens; Schlundt, Andreas",Biomol NMR Assign,,498

401999,The COVID-19 Pandemic and Herding Behaviour: Evidence from India’s Stock Market,2020,"The vast majority of intracellular protein targets are refractory toward small-molecule therapeutic engagement, and additional therapeutic modalities are needed to overcome this deficiency. Here, the identification and characterization of a natural product, WDB002, reveals a therapeutic modality that dramatically expands the currently accepted limits of druggability. WDB002, in complex with the FK506-binding protein (FKBP12), potently and selectively binds the human centrosomal protein 250 (CEP250), resulting in disruption of CEP250 function in cells. The recognition mode is unprecedented in that the targeted domain of CEP250 is a coiled coil and is topologically featureless, embodying both a structural motif and surface topology previously considered on the extreme limits of ""undruggability"" for an intracellular target. Structural studies reveal extensive protein-WDB002 and protein-protein contacts, with the latter being distinct from those seen in FKBP12 ternary complexes formed by FK506 and rapamycin. Outward-facing structural changes in a bound small molecule can thus reprogram FKBP12 to engage diverse, otherwise ""undruggable"" targets. The flat-targeting modality demonstrated here has the potential to expand the druggable target range of small-molecule therapeutics. As CEP250 was recently found to be an interaction partner with the Nsp13 protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19 disease, it is possible that WDB002 or an analog may exert useful antiviral activity through its ability to form high-affinity ternary complexes containing CEP250 and FKBP12.","Shigdel, Uddhav K; Lee, Seung-Joo; Sowa, Mathew E; Bowman, Brian R; Robison, Keith; Zhou, Minyun; Pua, Khian Hong; Stiles, Dylan T; Blodgett, Joshua A V; Udwary, Daniel W; Rajczewski, Andrew T; Mann, Alan S; Mostafavi, Siavash; Hardy, Tara; Arya, Sukrat; Weng, Zhigang; Stewart, Michelle; Kenyon, Kyle; Morgenstern, Jay P; Pan, Ende; Gray, Daniel C; Pollock, Roy M; Fry, Andrew M; Klausner, Richard D; Townson, Sharon A; Verdine, Gregory L",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,,498

This was accompanied by the suspension of all elective operations. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of the SARS-CoV­2 pandemic on general and visceral surgery in university hospitals in Germany. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was based on an anonymous survey, which was accessible online from 3 April 2020 to 17 April 2020 for the surgical departments of university hospitals in Germany. In total 73% (nâ¯= 29/40) of the hospitals participated in the survey. RESULTS: Cooperation with the authorities and the hospital administration was generally considered adequate; however, only 3% (1/29) and 7% (2/29) fully agreed with the statement that the health authorities at the federal and state level, respectively, were supportive of general and visceral surgery. The hospital directors expect an average loss of revenues of 28â¯± 16%. There was an average reduction in beds or operating room capacity of 38% and 45%, respectively. In addition, 11% of the medical personnel in general and visceral surgery were reallocated to other departments. CONCLUSION: The SARS-CoV­2 pandemic has a significant impact on academic general and visceral surgery in Germany. The reduction in beds and operating room capacity can lead to considerable delays in urgent surgical interventions and financial burdens in 2020 and subsequent years.","Stöß, Christian; Haffer, Henryk; Steffani, Marcella; Pergolini, Ilaria; Hartmann, Daniel; Nitsche, Ulrich; Novotny, Alexander; Friess, Helmut; Müller, Michael W",Chirurg,,498

This “fit-for-purpose” approach to water reuse could both save water and would reduce production cost and energy demand by eliminating unnecessary treatment and long-range conveyance, as it typically aims at local reuses. The appropriate choice of technologies for such approaches is perhaps the most critical planning and design decision when evaluating systems for implementation or refurbishing. This article examines wastewater reuse goals (direct potable use, indirect potable use, non-potable uses and industrial uses) and related requirements as relevant case studies, and issues that may arise during implementation. It then proposes an overview of current conventional and advanced technologies and their possible combination to meet foreseen uses under a multiple barrier treatment (MBT) approach, which implies a sequence of complementary processes at an increasing level of protection for both conventional and emerging pollutants according to reuse goals.

406450,Management of suspected COVID-19 patients in a low prevalence region,2020,"Collaborative live chats are gaining popularity as a development communication tool. In community live chatting, developers are likely to post issues they encountered (e.g., setup issues and compile issues), and other developers respond with possible solutions. Therefore, community live chats contain rich sets of information for reported issues and their corresponding solutions, which can be quite useful for knowledge sharing and future reuse if extracted and restored in time. However, it remains challenging to accurately mine such knowledge due to the noisy nature of interleaved dialogs in live chat data. In this paper, we first formulate the problem of issue-solution pair extraction from developer live chat data, and propose an automated approach, named ISPY, based on natural language processing and deep learning techniques with customized enhancements, to address the problem. Specifically, ISPY automates three tasks: 1) Disentangle live chat logs, employing a feedforward neural network to disentangle a conversation history into separate dialogs automatically; 2) Detect dialogs discussing issues, using a novel convolutional neural network (CNN), which consists of a BERT-based utterance embedding layer, a context-aware dialog embedding layer, and an output layer; 3) Extract appropriate utterances and combine them as corresponding solutions, based on the same CNN structure but with different feeding inputs. To evaluate ISPY, we compare it with six baselines, utilizing a dataset with 750 dialogs including 171 issue-solution pairs and evaluate ISPY from eight open source communities. The results show that, for issue-detection, our approach achieves the F1 of 76%, and outperforms all baselines by 30%. Our approach achieves the F1 of 63% for solution-extraction and outperforms the baselines by 20%.","Shi, Lin; Jiang, Ziyou; Yang, Ye; Chen, Xiao; Zhang, Yumin; Mu, Fangwen; Jiang, Hanzhi; Wang, Qing",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.07055v1.pdf,498

We have previously shown that endotoxemia, presumably from the gut, may complicate COVID-19. However, the role of endotoxin adsorbent (EA) therapy to mitigate organ dysfunction in COVID-19 has not been explored. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective observational study in COVID-19 patients who received EA therapy at the King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand, between March 13 and April 17, 2020. Relevant clinical and laboratory data were collected by inpatient chart review. RESULTS: Among 147 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, 6 patients received EA therapy. All of the 6 patients had severe COVID-19 infection with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Among these, 5 of them were mechanically ventilated and 4 had complications of secondary bacterial infection. The endotoxin activity assay (EAA) results of pre-EA therapy ranged from 0.47 to 2.79. The choices of EA therapy were at the discretion of attending physicians. One patient was treated with oXiris® along with continuous renal replacement therapy, and the others received polymyxin B hemoperfusion sessions. All patients have survived and were finally free from the mechanical ventilation as well as had improvement in PaO2/FiO2 ratio and decreased EAA level after EA therapy. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated the clinical improvement of severe COVID-19 patients with elevated EAA level upon receiving EA therapy.

Investigations showed a tender left deltoid mass, decreased shoulder ROM and elevated inflammatory markers. MRI demonstrated a large glenohumeral effusion with synovitis, and arthrocentesis confirmed septic arthritis (SA). She required subtotal bursectomy. Intraoperative joint cultures grew Streptococcus gordonii She completed 6 weeks of antibiotics and is undergoing physical therapy for post-infectious adhesive capsulitis. SA is most commonly due to Staphylococcus aureus and ß-haemolytic streptococci, and rarely due to viridans group streptococci including S.â¯gordonii To avoid inadvertent injection into the glenohumeral joint, vaccination should be performed posteriorly and inferiorly into the deltoid musculature. Progressive pain, fever or decreased passive ROM following vaccination should raise concern for SA. Given its rarity, however, concern for secondary SA should not affect the general population's consideration for vaccination.","Flowers, Robert Costigan; Rivera Rodriguez, Beatriz; Corbitt, Kelly",BMJ case reports,,498

This paper consists of three complementary parts. In the first part conceptualization of the European identity is presented according to the views of the EU institutions and relevant authors with purpose to signify its importance for further development of the EU project. In the second part the extent to which the EU citizens are currently affiliated with the European Union is assessed, especially with regard to the response of the EU to confront the pandemic (i.e. by relying on recent Eurobarometer surveys). Third and the central part of this paper is focused on providing the review and analysis of relevant solidarity actions directed to confront Coronavirus crisis by the EU institutions and representative CSOs active specifically at the EU level in the field of promoting European citizenship. The key findings of this inquiry indicate that analysed initiatives contain solidarity dimension, and therefore, have potential to reaffirm the European identity, that is, to enhance cohesion and unity among the EU citizens.","Dorotić, Jeronim",EU and Comparative Law Issues and Challenges Series,,498
410769,[Impact of COVID-19 on the presentation and course of acute appendicitis in paediatrics],2020,"In this paper, we introduce Cross-modal Alignment with mixture experts Neural Network (CameNN) recommendation model for intral-city retail industry, which aims to provide fresh foods and groceries retailing within 5 hours delivery service arising for the outbreak of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic around the world. We propose CameNN, which is a multi-task model with three tasks including Image to Text Alignment (ITA) task, Text to Image Alignment (TIA) task and CVR prediction task. We use pre-trained BERT to generate the text embedding and pre-trained InceptionV4 to generate image patch embedding (each image is split into small patches with the same pixels and treat each patch as an image token). Softmax gating networks follow to learn the weight of each transformer expert output and choose only a subset of experts conditioned on the input. Then transformer encoder is applied as the share-bottom layer to learn all input features' shared interaction. Next, mixture of transformer experts (MoE) layer is implemented to model different aspects of tasks. At top of the MoE layer, we deploy a transformer layer for each task as task tower to learn task-specific information. On the real word intra-city dataset, experiments demonstrate CameNN outperform baselines and achieve significant improvements on the image and text representation. In practice, we applied CameNN on CVR prediction in our intra-city recommender system which is one of the leading intra-city platforms operated in China.","Li, Po; Li, Lei; Fu, Yan; Rong, Jun; Zhang, Yu",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.09926v1.pdf,498
410976,A Survey on Social-Physical Sensing,2021-04-03,"BACKGROUND: Chest X-ray radiography (CXR) has been widely considered as an accessible, feasible, and convenient method to evaluate suspected patients' lung involvement during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, with the escalating number of suspected cases, traditional diagnosis via CXR fails to deliver results within a short period of time. Therefore, it is crucial to employ artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance CXRs for obtaining quick and accurate diagnoses. Previous studies have reported the feasibility of utilizing deep learning methods to screen for COVID-19 using CXR and CT results. However, these models only use a single deep learning network for chest radiograph detection; the accuracy of this approach required further improvement. METHODS: In this study, we propose a three-step hybrid ensemble model, including a feature extractor, a feature selector, and a classifier. First, a pre-trained AlexNet with an improved structure extracts the original image features. Then, the ReliefF algorithm is adopted to sort the extracted features, and a trial-and-error approach is used to select the n most important features to reduce the feature dimension. Finally, an SVM classifier provides classification results based on the n selected features. RESULTS: Compared to five existing models (InceptionV3: 97.916 ± 0.408%; SqueezeNet: 97.189 ± 0.526%; VGG19: 96.520 ± 1.220%; ResNet50: 97.476 ± 0.513%; ResNet101: 98.241 ± 0.209%), the proposed model demonstrated the best performance in terms of overall accuracy rate (98.642 ± 0.398%). Additionally, compared to the existing models, the proposed model demonstrates a considerable improvement in classification time efficiency (SqueezeNet: 6.602 ± 0.001s; InceptionV3: 12.376 ± 0.002s; ResNet50: 10.952 ± 0.001s; ResNet101: 18.040 ± 0.002s; VGG19: 16.632 ± 0.002s; proposed model: 5.917 ± 0.001s). CONCLUSION: The model proposed in this article is practical and effective, and can provide high-precision COVID-19 CXR detection. We demonstrated its suitability to aid medical professionals in distinguishing normal CXRs, viral pneumonia CXRs and COVID-19 CXRs efficiently on small sample sizes.","Jin, Weiqiu; Dong, Shuqin; Dong, Changzi; Ye, Xiaodan",Comput Biol Med,,498

According to WHO guidelines, continuous use of face mask is mandatory for personal protection for restricting the spread of bacteria and virus. Here, we report a 3-ply cotton-PLA-cotton layered biodegradable face-mask containing encapsulated phytochemicals in the inner-filtration layer. The nano-fibrous PLA filtration layer was fabricated using needleless electrospinning of PLA & phytochemical-based herbal-extracts. This 3-layred face mask exhibits enhanced air permeability with a differential pressure of 35.78â¯Pa/cm2 and superior bacterial filtration efficiency of 97.9% compared to conventional face masks. Close-packed mesh structure of the nano-fibrous mat results in effective adsorption of particulate matter, aerosol particles, and bacterial targets deep inside the filtration layer. The outer hydrophobic layer of mask exhibited effective blood splash resistance up to a distance of 30â¯cm, ensuring its utilization for medical practices. Computational analysis of constituent phytochemicals using the LibDock algorithm predicted inhibitory activity of chemicals against the protein structured bacterial sites. The computational analysis projected superior performance of phytochemicals considering the presence of stearic acid, oleic acid, linoleic acid, and Arachidic acid exhibiting structural complementarity to inhibit targeted bacterial interface. Natural cotton fibers and PLA bio-polymer demonstrated promising biodegradable characteristics in the presence of in-house cow-dung based biodegradation slurry. Addition of jaggery to the slurry elevated the biodegradation performance, resulting in increment of change of weight from 07% to 12%. The improved performance was attributed to the increased sucrose content in biodegradation slurry, elevating the bacterial growth in the slurry. An innovative face mask has shown promising results for utilization in day-to-day life and medical frontline workers, considering the post-pandemic environmental impacts.","Patil, Nikhil Avinash; Gore, Prakash Macchindra; Prakash, Niranjana Jaya; Govindaraj, Premika; Yadav, Ramdayal; Verma, Vivek; Shanmugarajan, Dhivya; Patil, Shivanand; Kore, Abhay; Kandasubramanian, Balasubramanian",Chem Eng J,,498

The effects a single training session, plus two researcher coaching sessions were evaluated using a nonconcurrent multiple probes across participants design. Primary dependent variables included (a) the number of completed targeted communication turns between the parent and child and (b) the number of child independent target communication responses (gestures and manual signs) during family-selected routines. Additional measures examined whether parents used strategies taught to them during training, and whether early intervention providers addressed strategies taught via coaching. A social validity measure was used to determine parent and provider views of the training. Due to COVID-19 restrictions, training and post-training sessions were delivered via telehealth for two triads. While data trends and variability differed across triads, following training, all three families increased the number of completed target communication turns and all three children showed higher rates of independent communication responses. Parents and providers implemented strategies taught and reported positive effects of the program. Implications regarding the use of naturalistic intervention methods for Latinx families, the utility of brief training models to meet the needs of under-resourced early intervention programs, and potential uses of telehealth are discussed.

413152,Hepatic Injury in Patients With COVID-19,2020,"Lockdowns to control the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have had profound effects on everyday life worldwide, but their effect on mental health remains unclear because available meta-analyses and reviews rely mostly on cross-sectional studies. We conducted a rapid review and meta-analysis of longitudinal studies and natural experiments investigating the relationship between COVID-19 lockdowns and mental health. A total of 25 studies involving 72 004 participants and 58 effect sizes were analyzed. Using a random effects model, we found that lockdowns had small effects on mental health symptoms, g = 0.17, s.e. = 0.05, 95% CI (0.06-0.24), p = 0.001, but the effects on positive psychological functioning, g = -0.12, s.e. = 0.11, 95% CI (-0.33 to 0.09), p = 0.27, were not significant. Multivariate analysis of effect sizes revealed significant and relatively small effect sizes for anxiety and depression, while those for social support, loneliness, general distress, negative affect, and suicide risk were not significant. The results indicated substantial heterogeneity among studies, but meta-regression analyses found no significant moderation effects for mean age, gender, continent, COVID-19 death rate, days of lockdown, publication status or study design. The psychological impact of COVID-19 lockdowns is small in magnitude and highly heterogeneous, suggesting that lockdowns do not have uniformly detrimental effects on mental health and that most people are psychologically resilient to their effects.","Prati, Gabriele; Mancini, Anthony D",Psychol Med,,498

The Poisson process is the most common process used for this purpose, in particular, its generalization that considers the intensity function to be stochastic. This is called a Cox process and different choices to model the dynamics of the intensity gives raise to a wide range of models. We present a new class of unidimensional Cox processes models in which the intensity function assumes parametric functional forms that switch among them according to a continuous-time Markov chain. A novel methodology is proposed to perform exact Bayesian inference based on MCMC algorithms. The term exact refers to the fact that no discrete time approximation is used and Monte Carlo error is the only source of inaccuracy. The reliability of the algorithms depends on a variety of specifications which are carefully addressed, resulting in a computationally efficient (in terms of computing time) algorithm and enabling its use with large datasets. Simulated and real examples are presented to illustrate the efficiency and applicability of the proposed methodology. An specific model to fit epidemic curves is proposed and used to analyzed data from Dengue Fever in Brazil and COVID-19 in some countries.","Gonccalves, Flavio B.; Dutra, Livia M.; Silva, Roger W.

The present study aims to assess how the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted adolescents'/young adults' (AYA) eating disorder (ED)-related care, and how access to, changes in, perceived disruptions to, and quality of care are associated with ED thoughts and behaviors. METHODS: AYA enrolled in the RECOVERY study, a pre-existing web-based longitudinal study, and completed a COVID-19-specific survey (n = 89). We examined bivariate associations of four markers of care: i) access to care, ii) changes in care, iii) perceived disruption to care, and iv) quality of care. Using multiple logistic regression, we examined the associations of pandemic-related markers of care with changes in ED thoughts and behaviors. We excluded those not engaged in treatment pre-pandemic (n = 16). RESULTS: In the remaining 73 participants, reported access to care was high, with 92% of respondents continuing care with at least one ED provider during the pandemic;however, 47% stopped some treatment during the pandemic. Nearly one-third (32%) perceived a disruption in treatment. Quality of care remained high with 67% reporting care to be better than or as good as pre-pandemic. Respondents acknowledged heightened symptomatology: 81% reported increased ED thoughts and 81% reported increased ED behaviors due to COVID-19-related factors. However, none of the markers of care described were significantly associated with ED thoughts or behaviors in regression analyses adjusting for demographic variables and baseline characteristics, except our quality of care measure which was approaching significance (p = 0.07). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show the majority of AYA who had care prior to the pandemic continued receiving some element of their multi-disciplinary ED treatment and perceived their care as high quality.

Emergency blood management committees (EBMCs) were formed regionally and provincially to coordinate transfusion service activities and responses to possible national blood shortages. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We describe the responses of transfusion services to COVID-19 in regional health authorities in British Columbia through a collaborative survey, contingency planning meeting minutes, and policy documents, including early trends observed in blood product usage. RESULTS: Early strategic response policies were developed locally in collaboration with members of the provincial EBMC and focused on three key areas: utilization management strategies, stakeholder engagement (collaboration with frequent users of the transfusion service, advance notification of potential inventory shortage plans, and development of blood triage guidance documents), and laboratory staffing and infection control procedures. Reductions in transfusion volumes were observed beginning in mid-March 2020 for red blood cells and platelets relative to the prepandemic baseline (27% and 26% from the preceding year, respectively). There was a slow gradual return toward baseline beginning one month later; no product shortage issues were experienced. CONCLUSION: Provincial collaborative efforts facilitated the development of initiatives focused on minimizing potential COVID-19-related disruptions in transfusion services in British Columbia. While there have been no supply issues to date, the framework developed early in the pandemic should facilitate timely responses to possible disruptions in future waves of infection.","McGinnis, Eric; Guo, Robert J; Marcon, Krista M; Berry, Brian; Coupland, Robert; Meneghetti, Victor; Morrison, Douglas; Onell, Rodrigo; Steele, Lisa; Trudeau, Jacqueline; Wong, Michelle; Shih, Andrew W",Transfusion,,498
414348,Quarantined individual’s behavior– a model evidence from COVID -19 pandemic,2021,"Neuropsychiatric sequalae to COVID-19 infection are beginning to emerge, like previous Spanish influenza and SARS episodes. Streptococcal infection in pediatric patients causing OCD (PANDAS) is another recent example of an infection-based psychiatric disorder. Inflammation associated with neuropsychiatric disorders has been previously reported but there is no standard clinical management approach established. Part of the reason is that it is unclear what factors determine the specific neuronal vulnerability and the efficacy of anti-inflammatory treatment in neuroinflammation. The emerging COVID-19 data suggested that in the acute stage, wide-spread neuronal damage appears to be the result of abnormal and overactive immune responses and cytokine storm is associated with poor prognosis. It is still too early to know if there are long term specific neuronal or brain regional damages associated with COVID-19, resulting in distinct neuropsychiatric disorders. In several major psychiatric disorders where neuroinflammation is present, patients with abnormal inflammatory markers may also experience less than favorable response or treatment resistance when standard treatment is used alone. Evidence regarding the benefits of co-administered anti-inflammatory agents such as COX-2 inhibitor is encouraging in selected patients though may not benefit others. Disease modifying therapies are increasingly being applied to neuropsychiatric diseases characterized by abnormal or hyperreactive immune responses. Adjunct anti-inflammatory treatment may benefit selected patients and is definitely an important component of clinical management in the presence of neuroinflammation.","Tang, S.

Although the world has intensively focused on the epidemic center during this period of time, it is imperative to emphasize that more attention should also be paid to some impoverished areas in China since they are more vulnerable to disease outbreak due to their weak health service capacities. Therefore, this study took Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture as an example to analyze the COVID-19 epidemic in the impoverished area, evaluate the control effect and explore future control strategies. METHODS: In this study, we collected information including age, gender, nationality, occupation, and address of all COVID-19 cases reported from 25 January 2020 to 23 April 2020 in Liangshan Prefecture from the Nationwide Notifiable Infectious Diseases Reporting Information System (NIDRIS), which were used under license and not publicly available. Additionally, we retrieved other information of cases through epidemiological investigation reports reviewing. Data were analyzed using the software Excel 2010 and SPSS 17.0. The geographic distribution of cases was mapped using ArcGIS10.2. RESULTS: By 23 April 2020, a total of 13 COVID-19 cases and two asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers were reported in Liangshan, in three family clusters. Among the cases, eight cases had a history of sojourning in Hubei Province (61.54%), of which six were related to Wuhan. Cases aged under 44 years accounted for 61.54%, with no child case. The delay of patients' hospital visiting, and the low degree of cooperation in epidemiological investigation are problems. CONCLUSIONS: During the study period, Liangshan was well under control. This was mainly contributed to strict preventive strategies aimed at local culture, inter-sectoral coordination and highly degree of public cooperation. Besides, some possible environmentally and culturally preventive factors (e.g., rapid air flow and family concept) would affect disease prevention and control. In the next step, the health education about COVID-19 should be strengthened and carried out according to the special culture of ethnic minorities to enhance public awareness of timely medical treatment.","Liao, Ru-Jun; Ji-Ke, Chun-Nong; Zhang, Tao; Liao, Qiang; Li, Ling; Zhu, Tian-Yu; Bian, Shao-Yong",Infect Dis Poverty,,498

Reply,2021,"To become a proactive and informed partner in postacute coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) management, patients need to have the knowledge, skills, and confidence to self-manage COVID-19-related health challenges. Due to several restrictions and consequently social isolation, online platforms and forums where people can share information and experiences became more popular and influential. Therefore, this study aimed to identify perceived information needs and care needs of members of 2 Facebook groups for patients with COVID-19 and persistent complaints in the Netherlands and Belgium and patients with COVID-19 who registered at a website of the Lung Foundation Netherlands. Besides demographics and clinical characteristics, the degree of satisfaction with care during and after the infection as well as satisfaction with available information were assessed. Open text fields revealed specific information needs which were summarized. Patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 perceive various unmet needs varying from specific information needs (eg, information about permanent lung damage) to general needs (eg, being heard and understood). These data lead to several recommendations to improve care for patients with COVID-19 and justify further development of online platforms specifically addressing these unmet needs.","Houben-Wilke, S.; Delbressine, J.

Reports of depressive and anxiety symptom are on the rise, contributing to suffering among people-especially adolescents and young adults-with pre-existing mental health conditions. Psychiatric care has shifted primarily to telehealth limiting the important patient nonverbal communication that has been part of in-person clinical sessions. Supplementing clinical care with patient electronic communication (EC) data may provide valuable information and influence treatment decision making. Research in the impact of patient EC data on managing psychiatric symptoms is in its infancy. This review aims to identify how patient EC has been used in clinical care and its benefits in psychiatry and research. We discuss smartphone applications used to gather different types of EC data, how data have been integrated into clinical care, and implications for clinical care and research.","Lhaksampa, Tenzin C; Nanavati, Julie; Chisolm, Margaret S; Miller, Leslie",Int Rev Psychiatry,,498

The symptoms of COVID-19 vary from asymptomatic infection to severe complicated pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiple organ failure leading to death. The estimated case-fatality rate among infected patients in Wuhan, the city where the first case appeared, was 1.4%, with 5.1 times increase in the death rate among those aged above 59 years than those aged 30-59 years. In the absence of a proven effective and licensed treatment, many agents that showed activity against previous coronavirus outbreaks such as SARS and MERS have been used to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection. The SARS-CoV-2 is reported to be 80% homologous with SARS-CoV, and some enzymes are almost 90% homologous. Antiviral drugs are urgently required to reduce case fatality-rate and hospitalizations to relieve the burden on healthcare systems worldwide.

However, no study has detailed the evolution of symptoms in the first month of illness.At our institution, we conducted remote (telephone and video) visits for all adult outpatients diagnosed with COVID-19 within 24âh of a positive nasopharyngeal polymerase chain test for SARS-CoV-2. We repeated regular video visits at 7, 14, and 28 days after the positive test, retrospectively reviewed the prospective data collected in the remote visits, and constructed a week by week profile of clinical illness, through week 4 of illness.We reviewed the courses of 458 symptomatic patients diagnosed between March 12, 2020, and June 22, 2020, and characterized their weekly courses. Common initial symptoms included fever, headache, cough, and chest pain, which frequently persisted through week 3 or longer. Upper respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms were much shorter lived, present primarily in week 1. Anosmia/ageusia peaked in weeks 2 to 3. Emergency department visits were frequent, with 128 visits in the 423 patients who were not hospitalized and 48 visits among the 35 outpatients (7.6%) who were eventually hospitalized (2 subsequently died). By the fourth week, 28.9% said their illness had completely resolved. After the 4-week follow up, 20 (4.7%) of the 423 nonhospitalized patients had further medical evaluation and management for subacute or chronic COVID-19 symptoms.Mild to moderate outpatient COVID-19 is a prolonged illness, with evolving symptoms commonly lasting into the fourth week of illness.","Blair, Janis E; Gotimukul, Ashwini; Wang, Fangfang; Mina, Syeda A; Bartels, Helen C; Burns, Mark W; Kole, Amy E; Vikram, Holenarasipur R; Gea-Banacloche, Juan C; Seville, M Teresa; Petty, Skye A Buckner; Vikram, Avinash; Orenstein, Robert",Medicine (Baltimore),,498

However, it is unclear how c-Fos regulates orthodontic tooth movement (OTM) in vivo. The aim of this study was therefore to analyse OTM in transgenic mice with overexpression of c-Fos. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We employed c-Fos transgenic mice (c-Fos tg) and wild-type littermates (WT) in a model of OTM induced by Nitinol tension springs that were bonded between the left first maxillary molars and the upper incisors. The unstimulated contralateral side served as an internal control. Mice were analysed by contact radiography, micro-computed tomography, decalcified histology and histochemistry. RESULTS: Our analysis of the unstimulated side revealed that alveolar bone and root morphology were similar between c-Fos tg and control mice. However, we observed more osteoclasts in the alveolar bone of c-Fos tg mice as tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)-positive cells were increased by 40%. After 12 days of OTM, c-Fos tg mice exhibited 62% increased tooth movement as compared with WT mice. Despite the faster tooth movement, c-Fos tg and WT mice displayed the same amount of root resorption. Importantly, we did not observe orthodontically induced tissue necrosis (i.e. hyalinization) in c-Fos tg mice, while this was a common finding in WT mice. CONCLUSION: Overexpression of c-Fos accelerates tooth movement without causing more root resorption. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Accelerated tooth movement must not result in more root resorption as higher tissue turnover may decrease the amount of mechanically induced tissue necrosis.","Decker, Maximilian G; Nottmeier, Cita; Luther, Julia; Baranowsky, Anke; Kahl-Nieke, Bärbel; Amling, Michael; Schinke, Thorsten; David, Jean-Pierre; Koehne, Till",,,498
421021,Lessons for effective COVID-19 policy responses: a call for papers,2021,"The mental health effects of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on postpartum women are of increasing concern among mental health practitioners. To date, only a handful of studies have explored the emotional impact of the pandemic surrounding pregnancy and none have investigated the consequence of pandemic-related social restrictions on the postpartum mood of those living among different socioeconomic status (SES). All postpartum patients appearing to the Mount Sinai Health System for their postpartum appointment between January 2, 2020 and June 30, 2020, corresponding to before and during pandemic imposed social restrictions, were screened for mood symptomatology using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). Each patient's socioeconomic status (high/low) was determined by their location of clinical service. A total of 516 postpartum patients were screened. While no differences in EPDS scores were observed by SES prior to social restrictions (U = 7956.0, z = - 1.05, p = .293), a significant change in mood symptomatology was observed following COVID-19 restrictions (U = 4895.0, z = - 3.48, p < .001), with patients living in lower SES reporting significantly less depression symptomatology (U = 9209.0, z = - 4.56, p < .001). There was no change in symptomatology among patients of higher SES (U = 4045.5, z = - 1.06, p = .288). Postpartum depression, the most common complication of childbearing, is a prevalent, cross-cultural disorder with significant morbidity. The observed differences in postpartum mood between patients of different SES in the context of temporarily imposed COVID-19-related social restrictions present a unique opportunity to better understand the specific health and social support needs of postpartum patients living in urban economic poverty. Given that maternal mental illness has negative long-term developmental implications for the offspring and that poor mental health reinforces the poverty cycle, future health policy specifically directed towards supporting postpartum women living in low SES by ameliorating some of the early maternal burdens associated with balancing employment-family-childcare demands may assist in interrupting this cycle while simultaneously improving the long-term outcomes of their offspring.","Silverman, Michael E; Burgos, Laudy; Rodriguez, Zoe I; Afzal, Omara; Kalishman, Alyssa; Callipari, Francesco; Pena, Yvon; Gabay, Ruth; Loudon, Holly",Sci Rep,,498
421488,Medical Hematology/Oncology Fellows' Perceptions of Online Medical Education During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"Structural racism has been and remains a fundamental cause of persistent health disparities in the United States. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and the police killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and multiple others have been reminders that structural racism persists and restricts the opportunities for long, healthy lives of Black Americans and other historically disenfranchised groups. The American Heart Association has previously published statements addressing cardiovascular and cerebrovascular risk and disparities among racial and ethnic groups in the United States, but these statements have not adequately recognized structural racism as a fundamental cause of poor health and disparities in cardiovascular disease. This presidential advisory reviews the historical context, current state, and potential solutions to address structural racism in our country. Several principles emerge from our review: racism persists; racism is experienced; and the task of dismantling racism must belong to all of society. It cannot be accomplished by affected individuals alone. The path forward requires our commitment to transforming the conditions of historically marginalized communities, improving the quality of housing and neighborhood environments of these populations, advocating for policies that eliminate inequities in access to economic opportunities, quality education, and health care, and enhancing allyship among racial and ethnic groups. Future research on racism must be accelerated and should investigate the joint effects of multiple domains of racism (structural, interpersonal, cultural, anti-Black). The American Heart Association must look internally to correct its own shortcomings and advance antiracist policies and practices regarding science, public and professional education, and advocacy. With this advisory, the American Heart Association declares its unequivocal support of antiracist principles.","Churchwell, Keith; Elkind, Mitchell S V; Benjamin, Regina M; Carson, April P; Chang, Edward K; Lawrence, Willie; Mills, Andrew; Odom, Tanya M; Rodriguez, Carlos J; Rodriguez, Fatima; Sanchez, Eduardo; Sharrief, Anjail Z; Sims, Mario; Williams, Olajide",Circulation,,498

422882,The great debate: does it matter how you lower blood pressure?,2020,"The century-old tuberculosis vaccine BCG has been the focus of renewed interest due to its well-documented ability to protect against various non-TB pathogens. Much of these broad spectrum protective effects are attributed to trained immunity, the epigenetic and metabolic reprogramming of innate immune cells. As BCG vaccine is safe, cheap, widely available, amendable to use as a recombinant vector, and immunogenic, it has immense potential for use as an immunotherapeutic agent for various conditions including autoimmune, allergic, neurodegenerative, and neoplastic diseases as well as a preventive measure against infectious agents. Of particular interest is the use of BCG vaccination to counteract the increasing prevalence of autoimmune and allergic conditions in industrialized countries attributable to reduced infectious burden as described by the 'hygiene hypothesis.' Furthermore, BCG vaccination has been proposed as a potential therapy to mitigate spread and disease burden of COVID-19 as a bridge to development of a specific vaccine and recombinant BCG expression vectors may prove useful for the introduction of SARS-CoV-2 antigens (rBCG-SARS-CoV-2) to induce long-term immunity. Understanding the immunomodulatory effects of BCG vaccine in these disease contexts is therefore critical. To that end, we review here BCG-induced immunomodulation focusing specifically on BCG-induced trained immunity and how it relates to the 'hygiene hypothesis' and COVID-19.","Moulson, Aaron J; Av-Gay, Yossef",Immunobiology,,498

The impact on mortality of this ""patients' burden"" has not been determined. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Through retrieval of administrative data from a large referral hospital of Northern Italy, we determined Aalen-Johansen cumulative incidence curves to describe the in-hospital mortality, stratified by fixed covariates. Age- and sex-adjusted Cox models were used to quantify the effect on mortality of variables deemed to reflect the stress on the hospital system, namely the time-dependent number of daily admissions and of total hospitalized patients, and the calendar period. Of the 1225 subjects hospitalized for COVID-19 between February 20 and May 13, 283 died (30-day mortality rate 24%) after a median follow-up of 14 days (interquartile range 5-19). Hospitalizations increased progressively until a peak of 465 subjects on March 26, then declined. The risk of death, adjusted for age and sex, increased for a higher number of daily admissions (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR] per an incremental daily admission of 10 patients: 1.13, 95% Confidence Intervals [CI] 1.05-1.22, p = 0.0014), and for a higher total number of hospitalized patients (AHR per an increase of 50 patients in the total number of hospitalized subjects: 1.11, 95%CI 1.04-1.17, p = 0.0004), while was lower for the calendar period after the peak (AHR 0.56, 95%CI 0.43-0.72, p<0.0001). A validation was conducted on a dataset from another hospital where 500 subjects were hospitalized for COVID-19 in the same period. Figures were consistent in terms of impact of daily admissions, daily census, and calendar period on in-hospital mortality. CONCLUSIONS: The pressure of a high volume of severely ill patients suffering from COVID-19 has a measurable independent impact on in-hospital mortality.","Soria, Alessandro; Galimberti, Stefania; Lapadula, Giuseppe; Visco, Francesca; Ardini, Agata; Valsecchi, Maria Grazia; Bonfanti, Paolo",PLoS One,,498

Drawing on the health belief model, perceived scarcity, and anticipated regret theories, this paper formulated a theoretical model that linked the determinants of panic buying and analyzed their interrelationships. Subsequently, data were collated from 508 consumers through an online survey questionnaire in Singapore that was conducted during the early stage of the pandemic, before the onset of the circuit breaker in April 2020. Next, an analysis of the results was done through structural equation modeling. It showed that the effect of the health belief model dimensions (i.e., perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, outcome expectation, cues to action, and self-efficacy) on panic buying is partially mediated by the consumers' perceived scarcity of products. Furthermore, the effect of perceived scarcity on panic buying is partially mediated by consumers' anticipation of regret. This paper expands on the current theoretical understanding of panic buying behavior, giving insights into the possible measures and solutions that policymakers and relevant stakeholders can uptake to manage panic buying in future a pandemic or health crisis.","Chua, Grace; Yuen, Kum Fai; Wang, Xueqin; Wong, Yiik Diew",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,498

The disease was first described in the city of Wuhan in China, presenting as an atypical infection of the lower respiratory tract. METHODS: COVID-19 is characterized by multisystemic involvement, and mortality is attributed mainly to the respiratory system involvement, which may lead to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome and respiratory failure. Several COVID-19-associated complications are being increasingly reported, including arterial and venous thromboembolic events that may lead to amputation of the affected limbs. So far, a large number of reports have described hypercoagulability crises leading to amputation of the lower limbs. However, a search of the National Library of Medicine (MEDLINE) revealed no cases of urgent upper limb amputation in COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: This article describes a novel case of upper limb ischemia in a COVID-19 patient, with rapid progression to hand necrosis, requiring urgent through-arm amputation of the upper limb. CONCLUSIONS: This case emphasizes the need for anticoagulant therapy in COVID-19 patients and to maintain a constant awareness of the possible thromboembolic COVID-19-related sequelae.","Makhoul, Kamal; Shukha, Yousef; Hanna, Lana Abu; Nitecki, Samy; Leiderman, Maxim; Hayek, Tony; Hamoud, Shadi",Int J Infect Dis,,498

We used Pearson's Chi-squared test, Fisher's exact test, and logistic regression to evaluate relationships. RESULTS: Of 452 Michigan NHs contacted via e-mail, 145 (32.1%) opened the survey and of these, 143 (98.6%) responded. Sixty-eight percent of respondents indicated their response plan addressed most issues. NHs reported receiving rapidly changing guidance from many sources. Two-thirds reported shortages of personal protective equipment and other supplies. Half (50%) lacked sufficient testing resources with only 36% able to test residents and staff with suspected COVID-19. A majority (55%) experienced staffing shortages. Sixty-three percent experienced resignations, with front-line clinical staff more likely to resign, particularly in facilities caring for COVID-19 patients (P < .001). Facilities adapted quickly, creating COVID-19 units (78%) to care for patients on site. To reduce isolation, NHs facilitated communication via phone calls (98%), videoconferencing (96%), and window visits (81%). A majority continued to provide requisite therapies (90%). CONCLUSIONS: NHs experienced shortages of resources, testing supplies, and staffing challenges. COVID-19 in the facility was a key predictor of staff resignations. Facilities relied on rapidly changing, often conflicting advice from multiple sources, suggesting high-yield areas of improvement.","Jones, Karen; Mantey, Julia; Washer, Laraine; Meddings, Jennifer; Patel, Payal K; Montoya, Ana; Mills, John P; Gibson, Kristen; Mody, Lona",Am. j. infect. control,,498

A psychological perspective from the Syrian population,2021,"We provide a three-step analysis of the effects and responses to COVID-19 in Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden), large Western European countries (France, Germany, Italy, Spain and United Kingdom) and OECD Europe. First, we compare public health trends over 2020 in terms of per capita COVID-19 cases, fatalities, testing and the stringency of social distancing (SD) measures. Second, in a ‘like-with-like’ policy response model between Nordic countries, we test for the effects of air border closures on the growth in per capita COVID-19 cases while accounting for differences in stringency of social distancing and other measures. Third, using data from OECD European countries, we regress percentage change in GDP (2020 – 2019) on cumulative per capita national COVID-19 fatalities. We find that: (1) Sweden is an outlier, relative to its Nordic neighbours, in its COVID-19 public health outcomes;(2) Sweden would have had reduced cases and fatalities if it had adopted the air border closures implemented by its Nordic neighbours in the first half of 2020;and, (3) for OECD Europe, there is a statistically significant and negative association between per capita COVID-19 fatalities and economic performance.","Gordon, Daniel V.; Grafton, R.

432670,Recovering hotel room sales during the COVID-19 pandemic: lessons from OTA information using the quantile regression approach,2021,"Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a critical illness complication that is associated with high mortality. ARDS is documented in severe cases of COVID-19. No effective pharmacological treatments for ARDS are currently available. Dysfunctional immune responses and pulmonary and systemic inflammation are characteristic features of ARDS pathogenesis. Recent advances in our understanding of the regulation of inflammation point to an important role of the vagus-nerve-mediated inflammatory reflex and neural cholinergic signaling. We examined whether pharmacological cholinergic activation using a clinically approved (for myasthenia gravis) cholinergic drug, the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor pyridostigmine alters pulmonary and systemic inflammation in mice with lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ARDS. Male C57Bl/6 mice received one intratracheal instillation of LPS or were sham manipulated (control). Both groups were treated with either vehicle or pyridostigmine (1.5 mg/kg twice daily, 3 mg/day) administered by oral gavage starting at 1 h post-LPS and euthanized 24 h after LPS administration. Other groups were either sham manipulated or received LPS for 3 days and were treated with vehicle or pyridostigmine and euthanized at 72 h. Pyridostigmine treatment reduced the increased total number of cells and neutrophils in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) in mice with ARDS at 24 and 72 h. Pyridostigmine also reduced the number of macrophages and lymphocytes at 72 h. In addition, pyridostigmine suppressed the levels of TNF, IL-1beta, IL-6, and IFN-gamma in BALF and plasma at 24 and 72 h. However, this cholinergic agent did not significantly altered BALF and plasma levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Neither LPS nor pyridostigmine affected BALF IFN-gamma and IL-10 levels at 24 h post-LPS. In conclusion, treatments with the cholinergic agent pyridostigmine ameliorate pulmonary and systemic inflammatory responses in mice with endotoxin-induced ARDS. Considering that pyridostigmine is a clinically approved drug, these findings are of substantial interest for implementing pyridostigmine in therapeutic strategies for ARDS.","Bricher Choque, P.

433712,Trust as a mediator of the relationship between character and perceptions of leader effectiveness during the COVID-19 crisis,2021,"BACKGROUND: Since the emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 (Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) in Wuhan, China, it has been extensively studied by many scientists. Susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection is shown by people of all ages, especially those with different comorbidities. Our goal was to describe the clinical characteristics, treatment, course, and outcome of COVID-19 in patients with pre-existing neurological disorders. METHOD: We retrospectively studied 70 patients with COVID-19 and previous neurological diseases who were treated in the Central Clinical Hospital of the Ministry of the Interior and Administration from 16 March to 15 June 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, image data, laboratory results, treatment methods and results, clinical signs and symptoms of patients hospitalised due to CNS diseases with COVID-19 were collected. RESULTS: The average age of hospitalised patients was 72, and the majority (63%) were women (44/70). The most common neurological disease was dementia, which was present in almost a third of patients (30.76%), followed by ischaemic stroke (24.61%). Chest imaging showed the presence of interstitial changes in 47% (33) of patients. Laboratory tests revealed increased total blood cells, increased levels of C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, D-dimers, liver indicator markers and IL-6 in the most severely affected patients. The treatment of patients was focused on monitoring their clinical condition, and supporting respiratory inefficiency with passive oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation. According to the guidelines of the Hospital Therapeutic Committee, pharmacological treatment (Arechin®, Kaletra®) was introduced in cases without contraindications. In patients with moderate COVID-19, antimalarial or antiviral agents were applied (78%). 30% of our observed patients died during the hospitalisation. CONCLUSIONS: We studied a select group of patients (elderly, with comorbidities, and moderate or severe COVID-19 course). Pre-existing neurological disorders were additionally associated with a poorer prognosis and a high fatality rate (30%). Dementia and CNS vascular disorder were the most frequent pre-existing neurological conditions. The neurological symptoms of COVID-19 were various. We observed impaired consciousness, dizziness, headache, nausea, myalgia, psychomotor agitation and slowness, delirium, and psychoses. Further analysis is needed to elucidate the incidence of COVID-19 neurological complications.","Zielinska-Turek, Justyna; Jasinska, Anna; Kolakowska, Jolanta; Szadurska, Joanna; Kosior, Dariusz A; Dorobek, Malgorzata",Neurol. neurochir. pol,,498
435002,Understanding the implications of FinTech Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused dramatic changes in the way people around the globe live, and has had a profound negative impact on the global economy. Much of this negative impact did not result from the disease itself, but from the lockdown restrictions imposed to contain the spread of the virus. We investigate how national stock market indices reacted to the news of national lockdown restrictions in the period from January to May 2020. We find that lockdown restrictions led to different reactions in our sample of OECD and BRICS countries: there was a general negative effect resulting from the increase in lockdown restrictions, but we find strong evidence for underreaction during the lockdown announcement, followed by some overreaction that is corrected subsequently. This under-/overreaction pattern, however, is observed mostly during the first half of our time series, pointing to learning effects. Relaxation of the lockdown restrictions, on the other hand, had a positive effect on markets only during the second half of our sample, while for the first half of the sample, the effect is negative.","Scherf, Matthias; Matschke, Xenia; Rieger, Marc Oliver",Financ Res Lett,,498

The human and material resources available in a mid-size hospital were more limited than in larger hospitals of the region. In this article, we describe how this Department of Hospital Pharmacy was reorganized to meet the increase in activity, the strategies developed and the lessons learned for future pandemics. The COVID-19 pandemic had a higher impact in Leganes, a city in the south of Madrid, with a population of 190,000. In the face of the dramatic increase in the proportion of patients attending our hospital between March and April 2020, the Severo Ochoa University Hospital increased the number of beds by 24.5% and fitted out new premises inside and outside the hospital (sports centers). The mean number of patients seen in our Emergency Department every day passed from 70-80 to a peak of 286 patients, with 652 hospitalized patients. The situation of emergency created by this infectious disease, with management protocols changing constantly, had a dramatic impact on the activity of hospital pharmacies. Thus, the pandemic has affected areas of economic management, magistral preparation, dispensing of medication to inpatients, ambulatory patients, patients monitored at home, institutionalized patients, and patients from private hospitals and field hospitals. Other areas affected include training, clinical trials, pharmacovigilance, and counseling boards. Two strategies were adopted to overcome these problems: a strategy centered on human resources (staff reinforcement, reallocation of responsibilities), and a strategy centered on processes (some processes were reinforced to meet the increase in activity, whereas other were temporarily suspended or reduced to the minimum).Conclusions: The Department of Hospital Pharmacy plays a key role in hospitals and has been significantly reinforced to meet the dramatic impact of the pandemic on this service. This Department has been able to reorganize its processes and take over new responsibilities such as telepharmacy and home dispensing. Hospital pharmacies play a crucial role in pharmacotherapeutic decisions in hospitals.

The unreached communities with noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) such as chronic cardiovascular, respiratory, endocrine, digestive, or renal diseases became more vulnerable during this pandemic situation. In both cases, Remote Healthcare Systems (RHS) may help minimize the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. This study used the WHO guidelines and Design Science Research (DSR) framework to redesign the Portable Health Clinic (PHC), an RHS, for the containment of the spread of COVID-19 as well as proposed corona logic (C-Logic) for the main symptoms of COVID-19. Using the distributed service platform of PHC, a trained healthcare worker with appropriate testing kits can screen high-risk individuals and can help optimize triage to medical services. PHC with its new triage algorithm (C-Logic) classifies the patients according to whether the patient needs to move to a clinic for a PCR test. Through modified PHC service, we can help people to boost their knowledge, attitude (feelings/beliefs), and self-efficacy to execute preventing measures. Our initial examination of the suitability of the PHC and its associated technologies as a key contributor to public health responses is designed to ""flatten the curve"", particularly among unreached high-risk NCD populations in developing countries.

MethodsAntibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and induction of antigen-specific B and CD4/CD8 T cell subsets were studied in 19 rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) patients receiving RTX, 12 RA patients on other therapies and 30 healthy controls after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination with either mRNA or vector based vaccines. ResultsA minimum of 10 B cells/{micro}L in the peripheral circulation was necessary in RTX patients to mount seroconversion to anti-S1 IgG upon SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. RTX patients lacking IgG seroconversion showed reduced antigen-specific B cells, lower frequency of TfH-like cells as well as less activated CD4 and CD8 T cells compared to IgG seroconverted RTX patients. Functionally relevant B cell depletion resulted in impaired IFN{gamma} secretion by spike-specific CD4 T cells. In contrast, antigen-specific CD8 T cells were reduced in patients independently of IgG formation. ConclusionsPatients receiving rituximab with B cell numbers above 10 B cells/{micro}l were able to mount humoral and more robust cellular responses after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination that may permit optimization of vaccination in these patients. Mechanistically, the data emphasize the crucial role of co-stimulatory B cell functions for the proper induction of CD4 responses propagating vaccine-specific B and plasma cell differentiation.","Stefanski, Ana-Luisa; Rincon-Arevalo, Hector; Schrezenmeier, Eva; Karberg, Kirsten; Szelinski, Franziska; Ritter, Jacob; Jahrsdoerfer, Bernd; Schrezenmeier, Hubert; Ludwig, Carolin; Sattler, Arne; Kotsch, Katja; Chen, Yidan; Claussnitzer, Anne; Haibel, Hildrun; Proft, Fabian; Guerra, Gabriella Maria; Durek, Pawel; Heinrich, Frederik; Gomes, Marta Ferreira; Burmester, Gerd R.; Radbruch, Andreas; Mashreghi, Mir-Farzin; Lino, Andreia C.; Doerner, Thomas",,,498

The purpose of this pandemic disaster practice improvement project was to measure changes in pulse oximetry associated with prone positioning of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 infection in adult acute respiratory distress or adult respiratory distress syndrome, who are awake, alert, spontaneously breathing, and nonintubated. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of patients who were coronavirus disease 2019 positive in the emergency department from March 30, 2020 to April 30, 2020 was conducted for patients with a room air pulse oximetry <90% and a preprone position pulse oximetry &#8804;94% who tolerated prone positioning for at least 30 minutes. The primary outcome was the change in pulse oximetry associated with prone positioning, measured on room air, with supplemental oxygen, and approximately 30 minutes after initiating prone positioning. Median and mean differences were compared with the Wilcoxon signed-rank test and paired t-test. RESULTS: Of the 440 patients with coronavirus disease 2019, 31 met inclusion criteria. Median pulse oximetry increased as 83% (interquartile range, 75%-86%) on room air, 90% (interquartile range, 89%-93%) with supplemental oxygen, and 96% (interquartile range, 94%-98%) with prone positioning (z = -4.48, P < .001). A total of 45% (n = 14) were intubated during their hospital stay, and 26% (n = 8) of the included patients died. DISCUSSION: In patients with coronavirus disease 2019 who are awake, alert, and spontaneously breathing, an initially low pulse oximetry reading improved with prone positioning. Future studies are needed to determine the association of prone positioning with subsequent endotracheal intubation and mortality.","Wendt, Christine; Mobus, Kristi; Weiner, Dan; Eskin, Barnet; Allegra, John R",J Emerg Nurs,,498

438735,School Geography under COVID-19: Geographical Knowledge in the German Formal Education,2020,"The information generated from the official eradication programs of caprine tuberculosis (TB) in Castilla y León, Spain, during 2018, has been used to assess the effect of vaccination against paratuberculosis (PTB) and the presence of this infection, on the single intradermal tuberculin (SIT) test results. Data from 121665 goats belonging to 1936 different herds were analyzed using generalized linear models. An epidemiological survey was conducted to know the herd immunization status against PTB and the date of last vaccination. All SIT test-positive animals were further investigated in order to confirm the diagnosis of TB, through bacterial culture, and PTB, by histopathological and qPCR analyses. SIT positivity was found in 39 (2.01%) herds, and 507 (0.41%) goats. TB was confirmed by M. caprae or M. bovis isolation in 10 (0.51%) herds and 46 (0.038%) goats. PTB was diagnosed in 13 (33.33%) and 55 (10.84%) of the SIT test-positive herds and goats respectively. Vaccination against PTB showed a significant influence on the results of the SIT test at herd level, with higher positivity detected among those herds vaccinated. However, this effect was not observed when the total number of animals was considered, where the highest positivity was found in unvaccinated goats. The time elapsed between vaccination and SIT test performance also influenced the results. The strongest effect was found when less than eight months elapsed between performing both activities, and to a lesser extent between 8-12 months. Conversely, no positive herds or animals were found when the time elapsed was higher than one year. No significant effect of the presence of PTB was observed. These findings demonstrate that the use of PTB vaccine does not result in false positives to a SIT test at individual level, provided that the time elapsed between the performance of both practices is higher than 12 months.","Espinosa, José; Fernández, Miguel; Royo, Marcos; Grau, Anna; Collazos, Jesús Ángel; Benavides, Julio; Del Carmen Ferreras, María; Mínguez, Olga; Pérez, Valentín",Transbound. emerg. dis.

Survey results show significant gender differences in the experience of respect from and satisfaction with relationships with the middle administrative part of the wider church called here the judicatory (e.g., synod, conference, diocese or presbytery), and with the experience of stress after their churches closed. Women clergy experienced greater loneliness and isolation, financial strain and thinking that closure affected their job search; their job search was also significantly longer than that of men. Respectful judicatory relationships are negatively related to many but not all vocational stresses. Comparisons with the experience of secular professionals suggest the stigma of closing a church adversely affects women clergy's vocational journey more than men's. The paper closes with implications for judicatory support of clergy leading churches to closure.","Cafferata, Gail",Rev Relig Res,,498
440498,Industrial Policy Response to the Covid 19 Crisis in Ireland – A Filière Approach,2020,"OBJECTIVES: Currently, there are no approved treatments for early disease stages of COVID-19 and few strategies to prevent disease progression after infection with SARS-CoV-2. The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of convalescent plasma (CP) or camostat mesylate administered within 72 h of diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in adult individuals with pre-existing risk factors at higher risk of getting seriously ill with COVID-19. Camostat mesylate acts as an inhibitor of the host cell serine protease TMPRSS2 and prevents the virus from entering the cell. CP represents another antiviral strategy in terms of passive immunization. The working hypothesis to be tested in the RES-Q-HR study is that the early use of CP or camostat mesylate reduces the likelihood of disease progression to (modified) WHO stages 4b-8 in SARS-CoV-2-positive adult patients at high risk of moderate or severe COVID-19 progression. TRIAL DESIGN: This study is a 4-arm (parallel group), multicenter, randomized (2:2:1:1 ratio), partly double-blind, controlled trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of convalescent plasma (CP) or camostat mesylate with control or placebo in adult patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection and high risk for progression to moderate/severe COVID-19. Superiority of the intervention arms will be tested. PARTICIPANTS: The trial is conducted at 10-15 tertiary care centers in Germany. Individuals aged 18 years or above with ability to provide written informed consent with SARS-CoV-2 infection, confirmed by PCR within 3 days or less before enrolment and the presence of at least one SARS-CoV-2 symptom (such as fever, cough, shortness of breath, sore throat, headache, fatigue, smell/and or taste disorder, diarrhea, abdominal symptoms, exanthema) and symptom duration of not more than 3 days.

Patients with organ or bone marrow transplant in the three months prior to screening visit INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Participants will be randomized to the following 4 groups: 1) Convalescent plasma (CP), 2 units at screening/baseline visit (day 0) or day 1; CP is defined by the presence of neutralizing anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with titers &#8805; 1:160; individuals with body weight &#8805; 150 kg will receive a third unit of plasma on day 3 2) Camostat mesylate (200 mg per capsule, one capsule taken each in the morning, afternoon and evening on days 1-7) 3) Standard of care (SOC, control for CP) 4) Placebo (identical in appearance to camostat mesylate capsules, one capsule taken each morning, afternoon and evening on days 1-7; for camostat mesylate control group) Participants will be monitored after screening/baseline on day 3, day 5, day 8, and day 14. On day 28 and day 56, telephone visits and on day 90, another outpatient visit are scheduled. Adverse events and serious adverse events will be monitored and reported until the end of the study. An independent data safety monitoring committee will review trial progression and safety. MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary endpoint of the study is the cumulative number of individuals who progress to or beyond category 4b on the modified WHO COVID-19 ordinal scale (defined as hospitalization with COVID-19 pneumonia and additional oxygen demand via nasal cannula or mask) within 28 days after randomization. RANDOMIZATION: Participants will be randomized using the Alea-Tool ( aleaclinical.com ) in a 2:2:1:1 ratio to the treatment arms (1) CP, (2) camostat mesylate, (3) standard of care (SoC), and (4) placebo matching camostat mesylate. Randomization will be stratified by study center. BLINDING (MASKING): The camostat mesylate treatment arm and the respective placebo will be blinded for participants, caregivers, and those assessing outcomes. The treatment arms convalescent plasma and standard of care will not be blinded and thus are open-labeled, unblinded.

441270,Student Response Initiatives: A Case Study of COVID-19 at Washington University,2021,"Background & objectives: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has spread rapidly, causing unprecedented case fatalities across the world. The first laboratory-confirmed case of COVID-19 and also the first death associated with the disease in the eastern part of Uttar Pradesh (UP) was reported from Basti on March 31, 2020. The present study describes a cluster of 17 cases including one death of confirmed COVID-19 in Basti, UP, India. Methods: A 25 year old male from Basti, UP, India, who died of respiratory failure was diagnosed post-mortem as SARS-CoV-2 positive. Contact tracing carried out by the district administration found 16 cases positive among tested contacts. A detailed retrospective investigation in the form of one-to-one interview was carried out with 16 recovered individuals to understand the transmission dynamics and clinical characteristics. Results: The findings showed that the cluster transmission occurred at three levels: first was direct contact with the index case which resulted in two secondary cases. Second, at a household level where four of the seven susceptible contacts got infected, and the third was an event (funeral) where 50 individuals participated and this resulted in seven SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals in whom infection could be directly linked to a funeral gathering. The index case had associated comorbidities and succumbed to death. Most of the cases were asymptomatic except two individuals, who developed mild symptoms. The mean duration of quarantine facility was 21.6±7.3 days, and the average time taken for the first negative test after testing positive to COVID-19 was 12±4.1 days. Interpretation & conclusions: The funeral acted as a super-spreader event for the transmission of infection among family members, relatives and others. Active contact tracing and confirmation of infection among the contacts led to the isolation of 16 SARS-CoV-2 positive cases and hence the limited spread of the disease.

444580,COVID-19 Pandemic overview and its genetic association with SARS virus,2020,"In this paper, we propose an elegant solution that is directly addressing the bottlenecks of the traditional deep learning approaches and offers a clearly explainable internal architecture that can outperform the existing methods, requires very little computational resources (no need for GPUs) and short training times (in the order of seconds). The proposed approach, xDNN is using prototypes. Prototypes are actual training data samples (images), which are local peaks of the empirical data distribution called typicality as well as of the data density. This generative model is identified in a closed form and equates to the pdf but is derived automatically and entirely from the training data with no user- or problem-specific thresholds, parameters or intervention. The proposed xDNN offers a new deep learning architecture that combines reasoning and learning in a synergy. It is non-iterative and non-parametric, which explains its efficiency in terms of time and computational resources. From the user perspective, the proposed approach is clearly understandable to human users. We tested it on some well-known benchmark data sets such as iRoads and Caltech-256. xDNN outperforms the other methods including deep learning in terms of accuracy, time to train and offers a clearly explainable classifier. In fact, the result on the very hard Caltech-256 problem (which has 257 classes) represents a world record.","Angelov, Plamen; Soares, Eduardo",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.02523v1.pdf,498

Currently, there are uncertainty and concerns about the maternal and fetal consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy. METHODS: A cross-sectional web survey was carried out including pregnant women in seven cities in Colombia. Women were evaluated during the mitigation phase of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic between April 13 and May 18, 2020. The questions evaluated demographic, knowledge, psychological symptoms, and attitudes data regarding the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: A total of 1021 patients were invited to participate, obtaining 946 valid surveys for analysis. The rate of psychological consequences of the pandemic was much larger than the number of patients clinically affected by the virus, with 50.4% of the entire cohort reporting symptoms of anxiety, 49.1% insomnia, and 25% reporting depressive symptoms. Poorly informed women were more likely to be younger, affiliated to the subsidized regime, and with lower levels of education. CONCLUSION: The knowledge of pregnant women about SARS-CoV-2 infection is far from reality and this seems to be associated with an indirect effect on the concern and psychological stress of pregnant women in Colombia.","Parra-Saavedra, Miguel; Villa-Villa, Isis; Pérez-Olivo, José; Guzman-Polania, Leidy; Galvis-Centurion, Pablo; Cumplido-Romero, Álvaro; Santacruz-Vargas, Dario; Rivera-Moreno, Eliana; Molina-Giraldo, Saulo; Guillen-Burgos, Hernán; Navarro, Edgar; Flórez-Lozano, Karen; Barrero-Ortega, Amanda; Sanz-Cortes, Magdalena; Miranda, Jezid",Int J Gynaecol Obstet,,498

There are differences between the sensitivity and specificity of these tests due to the usage of different viral target proteins and antibody subclasses. In order to evaluate the diagnostic use of these tests, we aimed to examine the diagnostic performance, especially sensitivity and specificity, of SARS-CoV-2 IgM, IgA and IgG tests of various companies (Abbott, Roche, Euroimmun, Dia.Pro, Anshlabs, Vircell, UnScience and RedCell), which have different principles (ECLIA/CLIA, EIA, LFA). Current (n= 180) and past (n= 180) COVID-19 patients with clinical and molecular diagnosis of COVID-19 admitted to Istanbul University-Cerrahpasa, Cerrahpasa Faculty of Medicine Hospital, Pandemic Polyclinic with suspected COVID-19 infection, were included in our study. The patients admitted within the first 3 weeks after the onset of symptoms were included in the current patient group, and those admitted at the third and after the third week were included in the past patient group. Serum samples (n= 180) obtained from Istanbul Sisli Hamidiye Etfal Training and Research Hospital, Blood Center between April and June 2018 before the COVID-19 pandemic were included in the study as a control group. All the tests included in our study were studied with the recommendations of the manufacturer companies. Between the IgG detection tests with different principles in patients with past COVID-19, the sensitivity and specificity values of the most effective tests were; 86.7%/99.4% (Abbott), 86.1%/98.9% (Dia.Pro), 91.3%/95% (RedCell). Between the IgM detection tests with different principles in current COVID-19 patients, the sensitivity and specificity values were; 67.8%/99.4% (Abbott), 68.9%/98.6% (Vircell), 50%/97.5% (RedCell). Abbott IgM with a kappa coefficient of 0.67 and Vircell IgM + IgA test with a kappa coefficient of 0.65 showed the best fit in patients with current COVID-19 infection. In patients with past COVID-19, Abbott IgG with 0.86 kappa coefficient and Dia.Pro IgG test with 0.85 kappa coefficient showed the best match. Due to the low sensitivity of IgM detection antibody tests, they should not be preferred instead of real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction in routine diagnosis. IgG detection tests may be preferred to detect the antibody response and the titers in people who have had COVID-19 for population seroprevalence and especially therapeutic immune plasma production. However, it is thought that the combined use of both ECLIA/CLIA-based and EIA/ELISA-based tests together may be more effective in routine use for SARS-CoV-2 IgG tests.","Dinç, Harika Öykü; Özdemir, Yusuf Emre; Alkan, Sena; Güngördü Dalar, Zeynep; Gareayaghi, Nesrin; Sirekbasan, Serhat; Tuyji Tok, Yesim; Kuskucu, Mert Ahmet; Karaali, Ridvan; Özbey, Dogukan; Aygün, Gökhan; Midilli, Kenan; Kocazeybek, Bekir",Mikrobiyol Bul,,498
449175,The Ethics of Emergent Health Technologies: Implications of the 21st Century Cures Act for Nursing,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Australia recorded its first case of COVID-19 in late January 2020. On 22P March 2020, amid increasing daily case numbers, the Australian Government implemented lockdown restrictions to help 'flatten the curve'. Our study aimed to understand the impact of lockdown restrictions on sexual and reproductive health. Here we focus on sexual practices. METHODS: An online survey was open from the 23PP April 2020 to 11P May 2020. Participants were recruited online via social media and other networks and were asked to report on their sexual practices in 2019 and during lockdown. Logistic regression was used to calculate the difference (diff) (including 95% CIs) in the proportion of sex practices between time periods. RESULTS: Of the 1187 who commenced the survey, 965 (81.3%) completed it. Overall, 70% were female and 66.3% were aged 18-29 years. Most (53.5%) reported less sex during lockdown than in 2019. Compared with 2019, participants were more likely to report sex with a spouse (35.3% vs 41.7%; diff=6.4%; 95% CI 3.6 to 9.2) and less likely to report sex with a girl/boyfriend (45.1% vs 41.8%; diff=-3.3%; 95% CI -7.0 to -0.4) or with casual hook-up (31.4% vs 7.8%; 95% CI -26.9 to -19.8). Solo sex activities increased; 14.6% (123/840) reported using sex toys more often and 26.0% (218/838) reported masturbating more often. Dating app use decreased during lockdown compared with 2019 (42.1% vs 27.3%; diff= -14.8%; 95% CI -17.6 to -11.9). Using dating apps for chatting/texting (89.8% vs 94.5%; diff=4.7%; 95% CI 1.0 to 8.5) and for setting up virtual dates (2.6% vs 17.2%; diff=14.6%; 95% CI 10.1 to 19.2) increased during lockdown. CONCLUSION: Although significant declines in sexual activity during lockdown were reported, people did not completely stop engaging in sexual activities, highlighting the importance of ensuring availability of normal sexual and reproductive health services during global emergencies.","Coombe, Jacqueline; Kong, Fabian Yuh Shiong; Bittleston, Helen; Williams, Henrietta; Tomnay, Jane; Vaisey, Alaina; Malta, Sue; Goller, Jane L; Temple-Smith, Meredith; Bourchier, Louise; Lau, Andrew; Chow, Eric P F; Hocking, Jane S",Sex. transm. infect,,498

Supporting people with diabetes to self-care has been critical to reduce their risk of severe infection. This global pandemic has presented an opportunity to digitalize diabetes care and rapidly implement virtual diabetes clinics, with the aim of optimizing diabetes management and well-being, while keeping patients safe. We performed a rapid review of the literature to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of virtual clinics in diabetes care before and during the COVID-19 pandemic and have combined these findings with our own reflections in practice. We identified examples demonstrating safety and feasibility of virtual diabetes clinics, which aligns with our own clinical experience during the pandemic. The advantages of virtual clinics include reduced treatment burden, improved therapeutic alliances, societal and psychological benefits, and in our experience, innovative solutions to overcome the challenges presented by the transition from in-person to virtual care.

Methods A cross-sectional investigation using convenience sampling method was conducted in Italy during April 2020. Eight hundred fifty-eight health workers participated in the research filling out self-report measures including Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), and Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R). Results Moderate/severe depression was found in 28.9% (95% CI, 25.8-32.04), moderate/severe anxiety in 55.4% (95% CI, 51.9-58.8), insomnia in 15% (95% CI, 12.5-17.5), and distress in 52.5% (95% CI, 48.5%-56.6) of participants. The 3% of health workers reported frequent suicidal thoughts. Female sex, working for &gt;15 h/week in a COVID-19 unit, and living apart from family were associated with a significantly higher risk of distress, anxiety, insomnia, depression, and functional impairment. Four profiles were identified on the basis of psychopathological measures: Profile_0 included 44% (N = 270);Profile_1, 25.6% (N = 157);Profile_2, 19.1% (N = 117);and Profile_3, 11.3% (N = 69) of participants. Results showed a significant effect for Profiles X IES-R (eta(2) = 0.079;f = 0.29), indicating that in all profiles, except for Profile_0, avoidance scale is lower than hyperarousal and intrusion symptoms scales of the IES-R. This characteristic could be a probable index of the control exerted by the responders to not fly away from their job. Conclusion The identification of specific profiles could help psychiatrists and emergency psychologists to build specific interventions in terms of both primary and secondary prevention to face future waves of the COVID-19 outbreak.","Moderato, L.; Lazzeroni, D.; Oppo, A.; Dell039,; Orco, F.; Moderato, P.; Presti, G.",Frontiers in Psychology,,498

Evidence is growing for a role of AL in viral infection. AL have been observed early in the life cycles of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) and, more recently, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), suggesting a specific induction of mechanisms potentially useful to these pathogens. Like other positive-strand RNA viruses, these viruses induce host cells membranes rearrangements. The NPCs of AL could potentially mediate exchanges between these partially sealed compartments and the cytoplasm. AL may also be involved in regulating Ca2+ homeostasis or cell cycle control. They were recently observed in cells infected with Theileria annulata, an intracellular protozoan parasite inducing cell proliferation. Further studies are required to clarify their role in intracellular pathogen/host-cell interactions.","Eymieux, Sébastien; Blanchard, Emmanuelle; Uzbekov, Rustem; Hourioux, Christophe; Roingeard, Philippe",Cell Microbiol,,498

However, little is known about the relationship between volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted and regional air pollution. In this study, VOCs emissions from a typical iron and steel plant in Yangtze River Delta (YRD, China) were monitored from April 2018 to March 2019. The ozone formation potential (OFP) and secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation of VOCs were calculated to reveal the influence of VOCs emissions on regional ozone and particulate pollution, and the sensitivity analysis approach was performed to explore the qualitative and quantitative relationships between VOCs and O3, as well as VOCs and PM2.5. The VOCs concentration was 93.76 ± 266.97 ppbv during the study. The OFP was 760.08 ± 2391.90 µg m-3, and aromatics were the predominant precursors, contributing 54.05% of the total OFP. Furthermore, the SOA estimated by fractional aerosol coefficient (FAC) and time-resolved (TR) methods were 6.032 ± 13.347 µg m-3 and 0.971 ± 4.650 µg m-3, accounting for 8.65-26.39% (13.78 ± 7.46%) and 1.55-4.20% (2.22 ± 1.23%) of the PM2.5 concentrations, respectively. The results indicated that VOCs were more sensitive to O3 pollution in high pollution domains, whereas VOCs were more sensitive to PM2.5 pollution in low pollution domains. We concluded that reducing VOCs emissions might be effective in alleviating photochemical pollution episodes in areas around iron and steel industry, and the haze pollution occurred in these regions may be caused by the primary emission of PM, and the contribution of SOA was relatively small.","Zhang, Xufeng; Gao, Song; Fu, Qingyan; Han, Deming; Chen, Xiaojia; Fu, Shuang; Huang, Xiqian; Cheng, Jinping",,,498

Given the importance of metals/metalloids in nutrition and human health, the present review was aimed at assessing the relationship between various essential and toxic metals/metalloids and the health outcomes related with the COVID-19. We are in the position to conclude that particular attention must be paid to the load/levels of essential trace elements in COVID-19 patients, mainly zinc and selenium. On the other hand, the exposure to air pollutants in general, and toxic metal/metalloids in particular, should be avoided as much as possible to reduce the possibilities of viral infections, including SARS-CoV-2.","Domingo, Jose L; Marquès, Montse",Food Chem Toxicol,,498

Although angiotensin II (AngII)-infused ApoE-/- mice have been widely used to study aortic aneurysm and dissection, early morphofunctional alterations preceding the onset of these conditions remain unknown. The goal of this study was to unveil early morphofunctional changes underlying the onset of aneurysm and dissection. At 3 days post-AngII infusion, suprarenal abdominal aorta presented significant volumetric dilatation and microstructural damage. Ex vivo assessment of vascular reactivity of the suprarenal dissection-prone aorta and its side branches, showed an endothelial and contractile dysfunctions that were severe in the suprarenal aorta, moderate distally, and absent in the side branches, mirroring the susceptibility to dissection of these different vascular segments. Early and specific morphofunctional changes of the suprarenal aorta may contribute to the regional onset of aortic aneurysm and dissection by exacerbating the biomechanical burden arising from its side branches.","Aslanidou, Lydia; Trachet, Bram; Sasset, Linda; Lovric, Goran; Stergiopulos, Nikolaos; Di Lorenzo, Annarita",J Vasc Res,,498

Despite uncertainty, infection prevention principles and experience with similar diseases have helped guide how to best protect providers and patients against disease acquisition. RECENT FINDINGS: Guidance to date has relied on data from SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV to guide practices on patient isolation and personal protective equipment (PPE) use. Although a face mask and eye protection are likely adequate for most clinical scenarios, published guidelines for PPE can be confusing and conflicting. Consensus for what constitutes a high-risk aerosol-generating procedure (AGP) is lacking, but most agree providers performing procedures such as bronchoscopy, intubation, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation would likely benefit from the use of an N95 respirator and eye protection. SUMMARY: Needed research to elucidate the predominant SARS-CoV-2 mode of transmission is not likely to be completed in the immediate future. Recommendations for PPE to mitigate procedure-associated risk remain controversial. Nonetheless, implementation of existing measures based on basic infection prevention principles is likely to prevent transmission significantly.","Scaggs Huang, Felicia; Schaffzin, Joshua K",Curr Opin Pediatr,,498

The objective of this review was to systematically explore how music therapists previously working in-person adapted to the transfer to remote forms of therapy in the context of the coronavirus outbreak. Methods: We searched Scopus, Web of Science Core Collection, CINAHL, Medline, ProQuest Central, PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO and PsyARTICLES, grey literature (to October 2020), and websites of professional organizations. We followed the JBI methodology for scoping reviews. Results: Out of the 194 screened texts, we included ten very heterogeneous articles with an overall very low quality. Most texts described remote therapy in the form of synchronous video calls using the Internet, one paper described a concert in a patio of a residential home. We report the authors' experience with the adaptation and activities, challenges and benefits of remote forms of therapy, recommendations of organizations, and examples and tips for online therapies. Conclusions: Music therapists have adapted the musical instruments, the hours, the technology used, the therapeutic goals, the way they prepared their clients for sessions, and other aspects. They needed to be more flexible, consult with colleagues more often, and mind the client-therapist relationship's boundaries. It seems, when taken as a necessary short-term measure, online music therapy works sufficiently well.

Experts weigh in on Canada's COVID-19 response,2020,"When the COVID-19 pandemic forced university campuses and healthcare agencies to temporarily suspend both undergraduate and graduate direct care educational experiences, nursing programs had to formulate alternative plans to facilitate clinical learning. Texas Woman's University used this opportunity to assemble a faculty group tasked with creating a set of college-wide guidelines for virtual simulation use as a substitution for traditional face-to-face clinical. The process included completing a needs assessment of both undergraduate and graduate level programs across three campuses and identifying regulatory requirements and limitations for clinical experiences. The task force utilized the information gathered to develop evidence-based recommendations for simulation hour equivalence ratios and compiled a list of virtual activities and products faculty could use to complete clinical experiences. Undergraduate and graduate student surveys were conducted to determine the effectiveness of the transition to virtual clinical experiences. Overall, the majority of survey results were positive regarding virtual simulation experiences providing students with valuable opportunities to enhance their learning. Negative comments regarding the impact of COVID-19 on a personal level included issues involving internet access and web conferencing logistics, lack of motivation to study, family difficulties, and faculty inexperience teaching in an online environment. Undergraduate pre-licensure students were provided with opportunities to successfully complete all remaining required clinical hours virtually, while graduate students were allowed to complete non-direct care hours as applicable using virtual clinical experiences.","Fogg, Niki; Wilson, Cecilia; Trinka, Michele; Campbell, Rachelle; Thomson, Anne; Merritt, Linda; Tietze, Mari; Prior, Merry",J Prof Nurs,,498

We measured the proportion of seroconverted employees and evaluated risk factors for seroconversion during the first pandemic wave. METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, we recruited Geneva University Hospitals employees and sampled them 3 times, every 3 weeks from March 30 to June 12, 2020. We measured the proportion of seroconverted employees and determined prevalence ratios of risk factors for seroconversion using multivariate mixed-effects Poisson regression models. RESULTS: Overall, 3,421 participants (29% of all employees) were included, with 92% follow-up. The proportion of seroconverted employees increased from 4.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.7%-5.1%) at baseline to 8.5% [(95% CI, 7.6%-9.5%) at the last visit. The proportions of seroconverted employees working in COVID-19 geriatrics and rehabilitation (G&R) wards (32.3%) and non-COVID-19 G&R wards (12.3%) were higher compared to office workers (4.9%) at the last visit. Only nursing assistants had a significantly higher risk of seroconversion compared to office workers (11.7% vs 4.9%; P = .006). Significant risk factors for seroconversion included the use of public transportation (adjusted prevalence ratio, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.25-2.03), known community exposure to severe acute respiratory coronavirus virus 2 (2.80; 95% CI, 2.22-3.54), working in a ward with a nosocomial COVID outbreak (2.93; 95% CI, 2.27-3.79), and working in a COVID-19 G&R ward (3.47; 95% CI, 2.45-4.91) or a non-COVID-19 G&R ward (1.96; 95% CI, 1.46-2.63). We observed an association between reported use of respirators and lower risk of seroconversion (0.73; 95% CI, 0.55-0.96).

462664,The Impact of Information System on Interactions of Child Welfare Professionals with Managers and Clients,2021,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the value of interleukin-6 (IL-6) in predicting long-term disease prognosis for Takayasu arteritis (TA). METHODS: Sixty-seven TA patients, who had IL-6 levels detected at the first visit and had a regular follow-up of at least 2 years, were enrolled. Data recorded up to March 31, 2019, including clinical presentations, laboratory indices, treatments, and radiological images were collected and used for analysis. The value of IL-6 in predicting disease relapse and imaging progression was analyzed. RESULTS: IL-6 levels were positively related with disease activity index, including Kerr scores, C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. Patients were divided into three groups according to baseline serum IL-6 levels: low group (< 5.4 pg/mL, n = 29), medium group (5.4-11.5 pg/mL, n = 20), and high group (> 11.5 ng/mL, n = 18). Patients in the medium and high group had higher disease activity than those in the low group (p < 0.01). Baseline IL-6 levels were correlated with luminal stenosis (p < 0.05), although no significant correlations with long-term imaging progression were observed. Patients with more than 2 episodes of disease relapses were most commonly seen in the medium group (p < 0.05). Multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analysis indicated that medium and high IL-6 levels were positive predictors for disease relapse (HR 4.3, 95%CI 1.3-18.7 p = 0.07 for medium group; HR 2.1, 95% CI 0.7-48.9, p = 0.19 for high group) with disease status and treatment adjusted. CONCLUSIONS: IL-6 may be a valuable predictor of TA disease relapse during long-term follow-up. Treatments targeted at IL-6 pathways might reduce disease relapse and have better prognostic effects for TA.Key Pointsâ¢ Positive relationships between IL-6 levels and disease activity index, including Kerr scores, C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, etc. were indicated.â¢ Medium and high baseline IL-6 levels were valuable for predicting disease relapse during the 2-year follow-up.â¢ Baseline IL-6 levels were positively correlated with luminal stenosis on imaging.","Sun, Ying; Kong, Xiufang; Cui, Xiaomeng; Dai, Xiaomin; Ma, Lili; Chen, Huiyong; Chen, Rongyi; Lv, Peng; Lin, Jiang; Huang, Qingrong; Jin, Xuejuan; Jiang, Lindi",Clin. rheumatol,,498

463630,Islamic Psychotherapy In The Pandemic Of COVID-19,2020,"Sarcoma treatment during the covid-19 pandemic is a new challenge. This patient population is often immunocompromised and potentially more susceptible to viral complications. Government guidelines highlight the need to minimize patient exposure to unnecessary hospital visits. However, those guidelines lack practical recommendations on ways to manage triage and diagnosis expressly for new cancer patients. Furthermore, there are no reports on the efficiency of the guidelines. One of the main issues in treating musculoskeletal tumours is the complexity and variability of presentation. We offer a triage model, used in a quaternary-referral musculoskeletal oncology centre, that allows us to maintain an open pathway for referral of new patients while minimizing exposure risks. A multidisciplinary approach and analysis of existing investigations allow for a pre-clinic evaluation. The model identifies 3 groups of patients: â Patients with suspected high-grade malignancy, or benign cases with aggressive features, both in need of further evaluation in the clinic and prompt treatmentâ Patients with low-grade malignancy, and benign cases whose treatment is not urgent, that are managed during the pandemic by telemedicine, with reassurance and information about their illnessâ Patients who can be managed by their local medical professionals In comparison to a pre-pandemic period, that approach resulted in a higher ratio of malignant-to-benign conditions for new patients seen in the clinic (3:4 vs. 1:3 respectively), thus using available resources more efficiently and prioritizing patients with suspected high-grade malignancy. We believe that this triage system could be applied in other surgical oncology fields during a pandemic.","Olshinka, N; Mottard, S",Curr Oncol,,498

To examine how sociodemographic, political, religious, and civic characteristics; trust in science; and fixed versus fluid worldview were associated with evolving public support for social distancing, indoor mask wearing, and contact tracing to control the COVID-19 pandemic.Methods. Surveys were conducted with a nationally representative cohort of US adults in April, July, and November 2020.Results. Support for social distancing among US adults dropped from 89% in April to 79% in July, but then remained stable in November 2020 at 78%. In July and November, more than three quarters of respondents supported mask wearing and nearly as many supported contact tracing. In regression-adjusted models, support differences for social distancing, mask wearing, and contact tracing were most pronounced by age, partisanship, and trust in science. Having a more fluid worldview independently predicted higher support for contact tracing.Conclusions. Ongoing resistance to nonpharmaceutical public health responses among key subgroups challenge transmission control.Public Health Implications.

Females were found to be 2 fold more likely to have anxiety and depression than male. Nurses were found to be two times more likely to have anxiety than doctors. Laboratory personnel were almost three folds more likely to have anxiety than doctors. Health care workers with insufficient/ no PPE were almost three fold more likely to have depression. health care workers working in high-risk areas had almost 2 fold higher odds of having depression. CONCLUSIONS: Health care workers experienced symptoms of stress, anxiety and depression in varied level of severity. This experience was higher among the nurses and laboratory workers than doctors. Pandemic preparedness assuring PPE and appropriate psychological interventions may be beneficial to promote mental health and well-being of health care workers.","Pandey, Apsara; Sharma, Chandrakala; Chapagain, Ram Hari; Devkota, Narmada; Ranabhat, Kamal; Pant, Suman; Adhikari, Kriti",J Nepal Health Res Counc,,498

Se aplicó una encuesta de la Organización Mundial de la Salud adaptada al contexto local. Se incluyeron preguntas abiertas para indagar sentimientos de las personas frente al COVID-19, y se realizó un análisis de contenido. Como resultados se advierte que la población encuestada siente incertidumbre, miedo y angustia, pero también emerge un sentimiento de responsabilidad y cuidado frente al COVID-19. Así mismo se destacan sentimientos positivos para la sociedad como una valoración de la interdependencia social. Los resultados arribados señalan que el impacto en la salud mental es desigual según el género, el nivel educativo alcanzado y el confort percibido en el hogar. El estudio permite concluir que las dimensiones emocionales y vinculares de las personas resultan aspectos centrales ante la pandemia del COVID-19 en Argentina. Es recomendable que estas dimensiones, así como y su impacto subjetivo y social diferencial entre los diversos grupos poblacionales, sean consideradas en la planificación de políticas para afrontar el COVID-19.","Johnson, María Cecilia; Saletti-Cuesta, Lorena; Tumas, Natalia",Ciênc.

467637,An overview on COVID-19 outbreak: Epidemic to pandemic,2020,"The immune response to SARS-CoV-2 is critical in controlling disease, but there is concern that waning immunity may predispose to reinfection. We analyzed the magnitude and phenotype of the SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell response in 100 donors at 6 months following infection. T cell responses were present by ELISPOT and/or intracellular cytokine staining analysis in all donors and characterized by predominant CD4+ T cell responses with strong interleukin (IL)-2 cytokine expression. Median T cell responses were 50% higher in donors who had experienced a symptomatic infection, indicating that the severity of primary infection establishes a 'set point' for cellular immunity. T cell responses to spike and nucleoprotein/membrane proteins were correlated with peak antibody levels. Furthermore, higher levels of nucleoprotein-specific T cells were associated with preservation of nucleoprotein-specific antibody level although no such correlation was observed in relation to spike-specific responses. In conclusion, our data are reassuring that functional SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses are retained at 6 months following infection.","Zuo, Jianmin; Dowell, Alexander C; Pearce, Hayden; Verma, Kriti; Long, Heather M; Begum, Jusnara; Aiano, Felicity; Amin-Chowdhury, Zahin; Hallis, Bassam; Stapley, Lorrain; Borrow, Ray; Linley, Ezra; Ahmad, Shazaad; Parker, Ben; Horsley, Alex; Amirthalingam, Gayatri; Brown, Kevin; Ramsay, Mary E; Ladhani, Shamez; Moss, Paul",Nat Immunol,,498
467647,The cruise industry and the COVID-19 outbreak,2020,"Background: The largest outbreak of Ebola virus disease in history happened between 2014-2016 in West Africa In Sierra Leone, one of the three most affected countries, more than14,000 people got infected and almost 4,000 died Risk communication and social mobilization efforts aimed to engage with the public and to educate people to prevent further transmission of the virus Not much is known how being exposed to this type of information influenced people's knowledge, behaviors and risk perception around Ebola Misinformation in the Ebola outbreak was widespread, but effective methods to counter real-life infectious disease misinformation have not been studied in a low-income setting Aims: To determine the role of risk communication in the Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone and to test the effectiveness of methods to debunk misinformation about infectious diseases Methods: Four nationwide cross-sectional surveys among the general population of Sierra Leone were carried out at different timepoints of the Ebola outbreak (August 2014, n=1,413;October 2014, n=2,087;December 2014, n=3,540;July 2015, n=3,564) The four surveys were pooled (n=10,604) and the associations between exposure to various information sources and Ebola-specific knowledge, misconceptions, protective behavior and risk behavior were assessed using multilevel modeling The associations between exposure to information sources and the perceived susceptibility to Ebola (i e risk perception), as well as the associations between Ebola-specific knowledge, misconceptions, behaviors and risk perception were measured in the pooled sample of the first three surveys (n=7,039) Qualitative, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 13 Sierra Leonean journalists who reported during the outbreak Using thematic analysis, their perceived roles were mapped After the epidemic, a three-arm, prospective, randomized controlled trial (RCT)(n=736) was carried out among adults in Freetown who were in possession of a smartphone with WhatsApp, to test whether 4-episode audio drama interventions could reduce the belief in typhoid-related misinformation Results: Exposure to information sources was associated with increased Ebola-specific knowledge and protective behavior, but also - to a smaller extent - with misconceptions and risk behavior Exposure to new media (e g mobile phones, internet) and community sources(e g religious/traditional leaders) as well as having Ebola-specific knowledge and engaging in frequent hand washing, was associated with increased risk perception Having Ebola-specific misconceptions and avoiding burials on the other hand, was associated with lower risk perception (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) 0 7, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0 6-0 8 and AOR 0 8, 95% CI 0 6-1 0, respectively) Sierra Leonean journalists adopted various roles over the course of the outbreak;from being skeptical about the existence of an outbreak, to being eye-witnesses themselves Through training about the virus, they later turned in to public mobilizers and instructors, stepping away from their journalistic independence Results from the RCT showed that the audio drama interventions significantly reduced the belief in typhoid-related misinformation compared to the control group In Intervention Group A (in which the audio dramas actively engaged with the misinformation) and in Intervention Group5B (where only the correct information was given), the belief that typhoid always co-occurs with malaria was significantly reduced (Intervention Group A: AOR 0 3, 95% CI 0 2-0 5,Intervention Group B: AOR 0 6, 95% CI 0 4-0 8) Actively engaging with the misinformation, instead of only focusing on the correct information, resulted in the largest reductions in belief in misinformation (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)","Winters, Maike",Dissertation Abstracts International: Section B: The Sciences and Engineering,,498

We explored COVID-19 control strategies that could offer the greatest benefit in resource limited settings. METHODS: Using an age-structured SEIR model, we explored the effects of COVID-19 control interventions-a lockdown, physical distancing measures, and active case finding (testing and isolation, contact tracing and quarantine)-implemented individually and in combination to control a hypothetical COVID-19 epidemic in Kathmandu (population 2.6 million), Nepal. RESULTS: A month-long lockdown will delay peak demand for hospital beds by 36 days, as compared to a base scenario of no intervention (peak demand at 108 days (IQR 97-119); a 2 month long lockdown will delay it by 74 days, without any difference in annual mortality, or healthcare demand volume. Year-long physical distancing measures will reduce peak demand to 36% (IQR 23%-46%) and annual morality to 67% (IQR 48%-77%) of base scenario. Following a month long lockdown with ongoing physical distancing measures and an active case finding intervention that detects 5% of the daily infection burden could reduce projected morality and peak demand by more than 99%. CONCLUSION: Limited resource settings are best served by a combination of early and aggressive case finding with ongoing physical distancing measures to control the COVID-19 epidemic. A lockdown may be helpful until combination interventions can be put in place but is unlikely to reduce annual mortality or healthcare demand.","Pandey, Kiran Raj; Subedee, Anup; Khanal, Bishesh; Koirala, Bhagawan",PLoS One,,498

Although considerable research on sexual selection has focused on structurally coloured plumage ornaments, the proximate mechanisms of their potential condition-dependence, and thus their honesty, is rarely addressed, particularly in an experimental context. Blue tit (Cyanistes caeruleus) nestlings have UV-blue structurally coloured tail feathers, providing a unique opportunity for investigation of the causes of variation in their colour. Here, we examined the influence of early growing conditions on reflectance and structural properties of UV-blue coloured tail feathers of blue tit nestlings. We applied a two-stage brood size manipulation to determine which stage of development more strongly impacts the quality of tail feather colouration and microstructure. We used small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and electron microscopy to characterize nano- and micro-scale structure of tail feather barbs. Nestlings from the broods enlarged at a later stage of growth showed a sex-specific rectrix development delay, with males being more sensitive to this manipulation. Contrary to predictions, treatment affected neither the quality of the barb's nanostructures nor the brightness and UV chroma of feathers. However, at the micro-scale, barb's keratin characteristics were impaired in late-enlarged broods. Our results suggest that nanostructure quality, which determines UV-blue colour in tail feathers, is not sensitive to early rearing conditions. Furthermore, availability of resources during feather growth seems to impact the quality of feather microstructure more than body condition, which is likely determined at an earlier stage of nestling growth.","Janas, Katarzyna; Latkiewicz, Anna; Parnell, Andrew; Lutyk, Dorota; Barczyk, Julia; Shawkey, Matthew D; Gustafsson, Lars; Cichon, Mariusz; Drobniak, Szymon M",J. exp. biol,,498

Methods: Using a retrospective, longitudinal cohort study design on consecutive patients with severe COVID-19, we used an extensive biochemical dataset of serial data and time-series design to estimate the occurrence of organ dysfunction and the severity of the inflammatory reaction and their association with acute respiratory failure (ARF) and death. Findings: On the 162 studied patients, 1151 biochemical explorations were carried out for up to 59 biochemical markers, totaling 15,260 biochemical values. The spectrum of biochemical abnormalities and their kinetics were consistent with a multi-organ involvement, including lung, kidney, heart, liver, muscle, and pancreas, along with a severe inflammatory syndrome. The proportion of patients who developed an acute kidney injury (AKI) stage 3, increased significantly during follow-up (0·9%, day 0; 21·4%, day 14; P<0·001). On the 20 more representative biochemical markers (>250 iterations), only CRP >90 mg/L (odds ratio [OR] 6·87, 95% CI, 2·36-20·01) and urea nitrogen >0·36 g/L (OR 3·91, 95% CI, 1·15-13·29) were independently associated with the risk of ARF. Urea nitrogen >0·42 g/L was the only marker associated with the risk of COVID-19 related death. Interpretation: Our results point out the lack of the association between the inflammatory markers and the risk of death but rather highlight a significant association between renal dysfunction and the risk of COVID-19 related acute respiratory failure and death.","Oussalah, Abderrahim; Gleye, Stanislas; Urmes, Isabelle Clerc; Laugel, Elodie; Barbé, Françoise; Orlowski, Sophie; Malaplate, Catherine; Aimone-Gastin, Isabelle; Caillierez, Beatrice Maatem; Merten, Marc; Jeannesson, Elise; Kormann, Raphaël; Olivier, Jean-Luc; Rodriguez-Guéant, Rosa-Maria; Namour, Farès; Bevilacqua, Sybille; Thilly, Nathalie; Losser, Marie-Reine; Kimmoun, Antoine; Frimat, Luc; Levy, Bruno; Gibot, Sébastien; Schvoerer, Evelyne; Guéant, Jean-Louis",EClinicalMedicine,,498

469231,Approaches to stimulate clinical reasoning in continuing medical education during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"COVID-19 has become a worldwide pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Severe cases of COVID-19 have accounted for 10-20% of all infections, leading to more than 500,000 deaths. Increasing evidence has suggested that the inflammatory cytokine storm originating from the anti-SARS-CoV-2 immune response plays an important role in the pathogenesis of critically ill patients with COVID-19, which leads to mixed antagonistic response syndrome (MARS). In the early stage of severe COVID-19, systemic inflammatory response syndrome causes acute respiratory distress syndrome, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, and even multiple organ failure. In the late stage of severe disease, increased production of anti-inflammatory cytokines drives the immune response to become dominated by compensatory anti-inflammatory response syndrome, which leads to immune exhaustion and susceptibility to secondary infections. Therefore, precise immunomodulation will be beneficial for patients with severe COVID-19, and immunosuppressive or immune enhancement therapy will depend on the disease course and immune status. This review summarizes the current understanding of the immunopathogenesis of severe COVID-19, especially the role of the inflammatory cytokine storm in disease progression. Immune indicators and immunotherapy strategies for severe COVID-19 are reviewed and the potential implications discussed.","Zhang, Yinhua; Chen, Yuanyuan; Meng, Zhongji",Front Immunol,,498

The moral philosophy, law, and medical ethics have all wrestled with the problem of distinguishing between saving someone and leaving another to die. While this distinction might seem intuitively straightforward, it becomes far more complex when applied in treating patients of novel Coronavirus Disease pandemic (COVID-19). The World Health Organization reports more than eight million and half cases of infection and more than 450,000 deaths, 26% in USA. However, with the exponential rise in number of COVID-19 victims and the shortage of life-saving ventilators, the pandemic has imposed to health professionals an ethical medical triage decision-making based on the utilitarian theory to maximize total benefits and life expectancy. Moreover, the decision to put restrictions on treatment beneficence is not discretionary, but an indispensable response to the overwhelming impacts of COVID-19 pandemic. The main concern is not whether to underline priorities, but how to do so systematically and ethically, instead of building decisions on individualized institutional aspirations or health professionals' intuition.The serious glaring disequilibrium, in healthcare market, between supply and demand for scarce medical resources in several developed nations (including the USA, UK, France, Italy, Spain, etc.) imposes a fundamental question: Which COVID-19 patient to save when facing scarce resources?.","Jaziri, Raouf; Alnahdi, Saleh",Ethics Med Public Health,,498

It created many issues around the optimal and safest way to treat complex patients with severe allergic disease. A significant numberof the patients are on treatment with biologicals and clinicians face the challenge to provide optimal care during the pandemic. Uncertainty of the potential risks for these patients is related to the fact that the exact sequence of immunological events during SARS-CoV-2 is not known. Severe COVID-19 patients may experience a ""cytokine storm"" and associated organ damage characterized by an exaggerated release of proinflammatory type 1 and type 3 cytokines. These inflammatory responses are potentially counteracted by anti-inflammatory cytokines and type 2 responses. This expert based EAACI statement aims to provide guidance on the application of biologicals targeting type 2 inflammation in patients with allergic disease. Currently, there is very little evidence for an enhanced risk of patients with allergic diseases to develop severe COVID-19 with studies focusing on severe allergic phenotypes lacking. At present, non-infected patients on biologicals for the treatment of asthma, atopic dermatitis, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps or chronic spontaneous urticaria should continue their biologicals targeting type 2 inflammation via self-application. In case of an active SARS-CoV-2 infection, biological treatment needs to be stopped until clinical recovery and SARS-CoV-2 negativity is established and treatment with biologicals should be re-initiated. Maintenance of add-on therapy and a constant assessment of disease control, apart from acute management is demanded.","Vultaggio, Alessandra; Agache, Ioana; Akdis, Cezmi A; Akdis, Mubeccel; Bavbek, Sevim; Bossios, Apostolos; Bousquet, Jean; Boyman, Onur; Chaker, Adam M; Chan, Susan; Chatzipetrou, Alexia; Feleszko, Wojciech; Firinu, Davide; Jutel, Marek; Kauppi, Paula; Klimek, Ludger; Kolios, Antonios; Kothari, Akash; Kowalski, Marek L; Matucci, Andrea; Palomares, Oscar; Pfaar, Oliver; Rogala, Barbara; Untersmayr, Eva; Eiwegger, Thomas",Allergy,,498
471235,Researching gender inequalities in academic labor during the COVID-19 pandemic: Avoiding common problems and asking different questions,2021,"The goal of this work was to develop recombinantly expressed variable domains derived from camelid heavy-chain antibodies known as single-domain antibodies (sdAbs) directed against the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein for incorporation into detection assays. To achieve this, a llama was immunized using a recombinant SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein and an immune phage-display library of variable domains was developed. The sdAbs selected from this library segregated into five distinct sequence families. Three of these families bind to unique epitopes with high affinity, low nM to sub-nM KD, as determined by surface plasmon resonance. To further enhance the utility of these sdAbs for the detection of nucleocapsid protein, homobivalent and heterobivalent genetic fusion constructs of the three high-affinity sdAbs were prepared. The effectiveness of the sdAbs for the detection of nucleocapsid protein was evaluated using MagPlex fluid array assays, a multiplexed immunoassay on color-coded magnetic microspheres. Using the optimal bivalent pair, one immobilized on the microsphere and the other serving as the biotinylated recognition reagent, a detection limit as low as 50 pg/mL of recombinant nucleocapsid and of killed virus down to 1.28 × 103 pfu/mL was achieved. The sdAbs described here represent immune reagents that can be tailored to be optimized for a number of detection platforms and may one day aid in the detection of SARS-CoV-2 to assist in controlling the current pandemic.","Anderson, George P; Liu, Jinny L; Esparza, Thomas J; Voelker, Bruce T; Hofmann, E Randal; Goldman, Ellen R",Anal Chem,,498

A total of 139 patients with COVID-19 were investigated at Siirt State Hospital. According to the disease severity, the patients were categorized as three groups (moderate: 85, severe: 54, and critical: 20). Then, patients were divided into two groups: nonsevere (moderate) and severe (severe and critical). Demographic, clinical data, and routine blood parameters were analyzed. In multivariate model adjusted for potential confounders BUN/Cr ratio (odds ratio [OR] = 1.70; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.20-2.40; P = .002) and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (OR = 2.21; 95% CI: 1.20-4.30; P < .001) were independent predictive factors for disease severity. In multivariate Cox proportional hazard model BUN/Cr ratio (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.02; 95% CI: 1.01-1.05; P = .030), and NLR (HR = 1.17; 95% CI: 1.06-1.30; P = .020) were independent predictors for survival of COVID-19 disease. The optimal thresholds of the BUN/Cr ratio at 33.5 and 51.7 had the superior possibility for severe disease and mortality, area under the curve (AUC) were 0.98 and 0.95, respectively.

475438,"How trust, mistrust and distrust shape the governance of the COVID-19 crisis",2021,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review summarizes infectious diseases involving the small bowel (SB) with a focus on recent literature related to diagnosis and pathophysiology. RECENT FINDINGS: Typical symptom for SB infections is diarrhea, mostly self-limiting. Pathogens include bacteria, viruses, fungi, protozoan parasites, and helminths. Host-pathogen interaction is of special interest in infections with potentially severe or prolonged course. Research uses increasingly enterocyte cell culture systems. SARS-CoV2 can also infect enterocytes via angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and causes gastrointestinal complaints in some patients. Chronic SB infections as tuberculosis, Cytomegalovirus, or Epstein-Barr virus have to be differentiated from Crohn's and other diseases. Severe rare fungal and protozoan parasitic infections can cause relevant morbidity in immunocompromised patients. Soil-transmitted helminthic infections are a special issue in endemic areas. SUMMARY: Many infections involve the SB, typically causing mild and self-limiting diarrhea. Symptomatic therapy, hygiene, and isolation are the mainstay of management. However, some patients develop severe or chronic disease. Immunosuppression is a major cause for severe, but also for rare opportunistic systemic infections that can also affect the SB.","Keuchel, Martin; Bota, Marc; Baltes, Peter",Curr Opin Gastroenterol,,498

The dynamic crosslinking structures endow it with combined advantageous properties simultaneously, including high ionic conductivity (2.04 × 10-4 S cm-1 at 25 °C), self-healing capability (96% healing efficiency), stretchability (563%), and transparency (78%). With this ionic conductor as the electrode, two soft iontronic devices (electroluminescent devices and triboelectric nanogenerator tactile sensors) are realized with entirely self-healing and stretchable capabilities. Due to the absence of liquid materials, the dry ion-conducting elastomer shows wide operational temperature range, and the iontronic devices achieve excellent stability. These findings provide a promising strategy to achieve highly conductive and multifunctional soft dry ionic conductors, and demonstrate their great potential in soft iontronics or electronics.","Zhang, Panpan; Guo, Wenbin; Guo, Zi Hao; Ma, Yuan; Gao, Lei; Cong, Zifeng; Zhao, Xue Jiao; Qiao, Lijie; Pu, Xiong; Wang, Zhong Lin",Adv Mater,,498

The quarantine measures have significantly decreased the anthropogenic activities, thus improving air quality. To study the impacts caused by the lockdown on specific source sectors and regions in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD), the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model was used to investigate the changes in source contributions to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) from 23 January to 28 February 2020, based on different emission control cases. Compared to case 1 (without emission reductions), the total PM2.5 mass for case 2 (with emission reductions) decreased by more than 20 % over the entire YRD, and the reduction ratios of its components were 15 %, 16 %, 20 %, 43 %, 34 %, and 35 % in primary organic aerosol (POA), elemental carbon (EC), sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, and secondary organic aerosol (SOA), respectively. The source apportionment results showed that PM2.5 concentrations from transportation decreased by 40 %, while PM2.5 concentrations from the residential and power sectors decreased by less than 10 % due to the lockdown. Although all sources decreased, the relative contribution changed differently. Contributions from the residential sector increased by more than 10 % to 35 %, while those in the industrial sector decreased by 33 %. Considering regional transport, the total PM2.5 mass of all regions decreased 20 %–30 % in the YRD, with the largest decreased value of 5.0 µgm-3 in Henan, Hebei, Beijing, and Tianjin (Ha-BTH). In Shanghai, the lower contributions from local emissions and regional transmission (mainly Shandong and Ha-BTH) led to the reduced PM2.5. This study suggests adjustments of control measures for various sources and regions.","Ma, Jinlong Shen Juanyong Wang Peng Zhu Shengqiang Wang Yu Wang Pengfei Wang Gehui Chen Jianmin Zhang Hongliang",Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,,498
477381,Recommendations applied to functional respiratory tests at the time of COVID-19. July 2020,2020,"The wide spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global concern and millions of people have been infected. Chest Computed Tomography (CT) imaging is important for screening and diagnosis of this disease, where segmentation of the lung infections plays a critical role for quantitative assessment of the disease progression. Currently, 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance for automatic medical image segmentation tasks. However, most 3D segmentation CNNs have a large set of parameters and huge floating point operations (FLOPs), causing high command for equipments. In this work, we propose LCOV-Net, a lightweight 3D CNN for accurate segmentation of COVID-19 pneumonia lesions from CT volumes. The core component of LCOV-Net is a lightweight attention-based convolutional block (LACB), which consists of a spatiotemporal separable convolution branch to reduce parameters and a lightweight feature calibration branch to improve the learning ability. We combined our LACB module with 3D U-Net as LCOV-Net, and tested our method on a dataset of CT scans of 130 COVID-19 patients for the infection lesion segmentation. Experimental results show that: (1) our LCOV-Net outperforms existing lightweight networks for 3D segmentation and (2) compared with the widely used 3D U-Net, our LCOV-Net improved the Dice score by around 20.36% and reduced the parameter number by 90.16%, leading to 27.93% speedup.

Currently, no registered antivirals have been approved for clinical therapy. Thus, a therapeutic agent for the enterovirus-related disease is urgently needed. Remdesivir (GS-5734) is a novel monophosphoramidate adenosine analog prodrug that exhibits potent antiviral activity against diverse RNA virus families, including positive-sense Coronaviridae and Flaviviridae and negative-sense Filoviridae, Paramyxoviridae, and Pneumoviridae. Currently, remdesivir is under phase 3 clinical development for disease COVID-19 treatment. Here, we found that remdesivir impeded both EV71 viral RNA (vRNA) and complementary (cRNA) synthesis, indicating that EV71 replication is inhibited by the triphosphate (TP) form of remdesivir. Moreover, remdesivir showed potent antiviral activity against diverse enteroviruses. These data extend the remdesivir antiviral activity to enteroviruses and indicate that remdesivir is a promising antiviral treatment for EV71 and other enterovirus infections.","Ye, Wei; Yao, Min; Dong, Yangchao; Ye, Chuantao; Wang, Dan; Liu, He; Ma, Hongwei; Zhang, Hui; Qi, Libin; Yang, Yuewu; Wang, Yuan; Zhang, Liang; Cheng, Linfeng; Lv, Xin; Xu, Zhikai; Lei, Yingfeng; Zhang, Fanglin",Front.

STUDY DESIGN: Children with MIS-C admitted to pediatric intensive care units in New York City between April 23 and May 23, 2020, were included. Demographic and clinical data were collected. RESULTS: Of 33 children with MIS-C, the median age was 10 years; 61% were male; 45% were Hispanic/Latino; and 39% were black. Comorbidities were present in 45%. Fever (93%) and vomiting (69%) were the most common presenting symptoms. Depressed left ventricular ejection fraction was found in 63% of patients with median ejection fraction of 46.6% (IQR, 39.5-52.8). C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, d-dimer, and pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels were elevated in all patients. For treatment, intravenous immunoglobulin was used in 18 (54%), corticosteroids in 17 (51%), tocilizumab in 12 (36%), remdesivir in 7 (21%), vasopressors in 17 (51%), mechanical ventilation in 5 (15%), extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in 1 (3%), and intra-aortic balloon pump in 1 (3%). The left ventricular ejection fraction normalized in 95% of those with a depressed ejection fraction. All patients were discharged home with median duration of pediatric intensive care unit stay of 4.7 days (IQR, 4-8 days) and a hospital stay of 7.8 days (IQR, 6.0-10.1 days). One patient (3%) died after withdrawal of care secondary to stroke while on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.

Upon stimulation, the inflammasomes activate the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1ß and IL-18 and induce gasdermin D-mediated pyroptosis. Dysregulated inflammasome signaling could lead to hyperinflammation in response to environmental triggers, thus contributing to the pathogenesis of childhood autoimmune/autoinflammatory diseases. In this review, we group childhood rheumatic diseases into the autoinflammation to autoimmunity spectrum and discuss about the involvement of inflammasomes in disease mechanisms. Genetic mutations in inflammasome components cause monogenic autoinflammatory diseases, while inflammasome-related genetic variants have been implicated in polygenic childhood rheumatic diseases. We highlight the reported associations of inflammasome signaling-related genetic polymorphisms/protein levels with pediatric autoimmune disease susceptibility and disease course. Furthermore, we discuss about the use of IL-1 receptor antagonist as an adjunctive therapy in several childhood autoimmune diseases, including macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) related to COVID-19. A comprehensive multi-cohort comparison on inflammasome gene expression profile in different pediatric rheumatic diseases is needed to identify patient subsets that might benefit from the adjunctive therapy of IL-1ß inhibitors.","Yang, Chin-An; Chiang, Bor-Luen",Clin. rev. allergy immunol,,498
478794,The social life of COVID-19: Early insights from social media monitoring data collected in Poland,2020,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The COVID-19 pandemic has infected over > 11 million as of today people worldwide and is associated with significant cardiovascular manifestations, particularly in subjects with preexisting comorbidities and cardiovascular risk factors. Recently, a predisposition for arterial and venous thromboses has been reported in COVID-19 infection. We hypothesize that besides conventional risk factors, subjects with elevated lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) may have a particularly high risk of developing cardiovascular complications. RECENT FINDINGS: The Lp(a) molecule has the propensity for inhibiting endogenous fibrinolysis through its apolipoprotein(a) component and for enhancing proinflammatory effects such as through its content of oxidized phospholipids. The LPA gene contains an interleukin-6 (IL-6) response element that may induce an acute phase-type increase in Lp(a) levels following a cytokine storm from COVID-19. Thus, subjects with either baseline elevated Lp(a) or those who have an increase following COVID-19 infection, or both, may be at very high risk of developing thromboses. Elevated Lp(a) may also lead to acute destabilization of preexisting but quiescent atherosclerotic plaques, which might induce acute myocardial infarction and stroke. Ongoing studies with IL-6 antagonists may be informative in understanding this relationship, and registries are being initiated to measure Lp(a) in subjects infected with COVID-19. If indeed an association is suggestive of being causal, consideration can be given to systematic testing of Lp(a) and prophylactic systemic anticoagulation in infected inpatients. Therapeutic lipid apheresis and pharmacotherapy for the reduction of Lp(a) levels may minimize thrombogenic potential and proinflammatory effects. We propose studies to test the hypothesis that Lp(a) may contribute to cardiovascular complications of COVID-19.","Moriarty, Patrick M; Gorby, Lauryn K; Stroes, Erik S; Kastelein, John P; Davidson, Michael; Tsimikas, Sotirios",Curr Atheroscler Rep,,498

This disease affects the respiratory system, and the viral agent that causes it, SARS-CoV-2, spreads through droplets of saliva, as well as through coughing and sneezing. As an extremely transmissible viral infection, COVID-19 is causing significant damage to the economies of both developed and lower- and middle-income countries because of its direct impact on the health of citizens and the containment measures taken to curtail the virus. Methods to reduce or control the spread of the virus and protect the global population are needed to avoid further deaths, long-term health issues, and prolonged economic impact. The most effective approach to reduce viral spread and avoid a substantial collapse of the health system, in the absence of vaccines, is nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPI) such as enforcing social containment restrictions, monitoring overall population mobility, implementing widespread viral testing, and increasing hygiene measures. Our approach consists of combining network analytics with machine learning models by using a combination of anonymized health and telecommunications data to better understand the correlation between population movements and virus spread. This approach, called location network analysis (LNA), allows for accurate prediction of possible new outbreaks. It gives governments and health authorities a crucial tool that can help define more accurate public health metrics and can be used either to intensify social containment policies to avoid further spread or to ease them to reopen the economy. LNA can also help to retrospectively evaluate the effectiveness of policy responses to COVID-19.","Reis Pinheiro, Carlos Andre Galati Matthew Summerville Natalia Lambrecht Mark",Big Data Research,,498

Whilst food safety regulations have been introduced over the past few years to maintain the microbial safety of foods sold from these wet markets, it remains unclear whether the hygiene maintenance that is performed on the wooden cutting boards used for meat-processing is effective. In fact, hygiene maintenance may often be overlooked, and hygiene standards may be insufficient. If so, this may lead to the spread of harmful pathogens through cross-contamination, thereby causing severe risks to public health. The aim of this study was to determine the level of microbial transfer between wooden cutting boards and swine meat of various qualities, using 16S metagenomic sequencing, strain identification and biofilm screening of isolated strains. The results established that: (a) the traditional hygiene practices used for cleaning wooden cutting boards in Hong Kong’s wet markets expose the surfaces to potentially harmful microorganisms; (b) the processing of microbially contaminated meat on cutting boards cleaned using traditional practices leads to cross-contamination; and (c) several potentially pathogenic microorganisms found on the cutting boards have good biofilm-forming abilities. These results reinforce the need to review the traditional methods used to clean wooden cutting boards after the processing of raw meat in Hong Kong’ wet markets so as to prevent cross-contamination events. The establishment of proper hygiene protocols may reduce the spread of disease-causing microorganisms (including antibiotic-resistant microorganisms) in food-processing environments.","Sekoai, Patrick T.; Feng, Shiqi; Zhou, Wenwen; Ngan, Wing Y.; Pu, Yang; Yao, Yuan; Pan, Jie; Habimana, Olivier",Microorg.,,498

The IgG-IgM serological assay has demonstrated good accuracy in early detection in symptomatic patients, but its role in the diagnosis of asymptomatic patients is uncertain. The aim of our study was to assess IgM and IgG prevalence in sera in a large cohort of HCWs previously subjected to Nasopharyngeal swab test (NST) after accurate risk assessment due to positive COVID-19 patient exposure during an observation period of 90 days. METHODS: 2407 asymptomatic HCWs that had close contact with COVID-19 patients in the period between April 8th and June 7th were screened with NST based on the RT-PCR method. In parallel, they underwent large-scale chemiluminescence immunoassays involving IgM-IgG serological screening to determine actual viral spread in the same cohort. RESULTS: During the 90-day observation period, 18 workers (0.75%) resulted positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection at the NST, whereas the positivity rates for IgM and IgG were 11.51% and 2.37%, respectively (277 workers). Despite high specificity, serological tests were inadequate for detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with previous positive NST results (IgM and IgG sensitivities of 27.78% and 50.00%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate a widespread low viral load of SARS-CoV-2 among hospital workers. However, serological screening showed very low sensitivity with respect to NST in identifying infected workers, and negative IgG and IgM results should not exclude the diagnosis of COVID-19. IgG-IgM chemiluminescence immunoassays could increase the diagnosis of COVID-19 only in association with NST, and this association is considered helpful for decision-making regarding returning to work.","Vimercati, Luigi; Stefanizzi, Pasquale; De Maria, Luigi; Caputi, Antonio; Cavone, Domenica; Quarato, Marco; Gesualdo, Loreto; Lopalco, Pier Luigi; Migliore, Giovanni; Sponselli, Stefania; Graziano, Giusi; Larocca, Angela Maria Vittoria; Tafuri, Silvio",Environ Res,,498

However, in particular the role of immunosuppression in patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) remains undetermined. Here, we present a 62-year-old male COVID-19 patient with recent heart transplantation who developed only mild symptoms, but had prolonged virus shedding, and summarize the available data on COVID-19 in cardiac allograft recipients. Initially the patient presented with a transient episode of fever and sore throat but no other symptoms, in particular no cough or dyspnea at rest. After diagnosis, immunosuppression was continued unchanged. On day 7, his temperature increased again with concurrent mild rise of C-reactive protein, IL-6, and pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels. Hydroxychloroquine was started and continued for 7 days. While the patient no longer had clinical symptoms 20 days after initial presentation, virus culture of throat swabs on days 18 and 21 confirmed active virus replication and SARS-CoV-2 PCR remained positive on day 35 with copy numbers similar to the onset of infection. In conclusion, the immunosuppression regimen in transplant recipients with mild COVID-19-associated symptoms may be continued unchanged. However, it may contribute to delayed virus polymerase chain reaction conversion and thus possible prolonged infectivity.","Decker, Annegrit; Welzel, Markus; Laubner, Katharina; Grundmann, Sebastian; Kochs, Georg; Panning, Marcus; Thimme, Robert; Bode, Christoph; Wagner, Dirk; Lother, Achim",Am. j. transplant,,498

AIMS: A rapid review was conducted to provide educators, allied health practitioners and policymakers with a synthesis of valid, relevant and actionable evidence relating to telepractice delivery of instructional reading and spelling procedures. The aim was to investigate the nature and outcomes of studies examining instructional reading and spelling procedures delivered via telepractice to school-aged students. METHODS & PROCEDURES: A rapid review was undertaken in accordance with the eight-step process published by the Cochrane Rapid Reviews Methods Group. Medline (all databases), Embase, Cochrane and ProQuest Central were systematically searched with predefined search terms organized across four key concepts relating to the research questions. OUTCOMES & RESULTS: Nine studies were included in this rapid review. Reading and spelling instruction and intervention using telepractice can be feasible and engaging. Telepractice assessment for reading and spelling can be equally effective as onsite assessment. CONCLUSIONS & IMPLICATIONS: The evidence base for telepractice delivery of reading and spelling procedures is in its infancy in terms of both the quantity and the quality of the evidence. Insufficient evidence exists to draw clear conclusions about its efficacy, and therefore practitioners should proceed cautiously. What this paper adds What is already known on the subject For onsite delivery, evidence-based reading and spelling assessment, instruction and interventions delivered by educators and allied health practitioners have been shown to accelerate students' skills; less is known about the efficacy of instructional reading and spelling procedures in a telepractice model, which have rapidly become the new norm in many countries due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The benefits of telepractice include improved access to services, increased service availability, convenience, time efficiency, caseload management efficiency and removal of logistical barriers relating to cost and geographical location. During the COVID-19 pandemic, telepractice has facilitated continued access to services. What this study adds to existing knowledge Reading and spelling instruction and intervention delivered via telepractice can be feasible and engaging. Telepractice is a viable mode to deliver reading and spelling assessments with strong agreement between telepractice and onsite scores. Given their low methodological quality, the studies in this review provide valuable information around the how of telepractice reading and spelling procedures and highlight the factors that may contribute to positive outcomes with this service delivery model. What are the potential or actual clinical implications of this work? Educators and allied health practitioners need a thorough understanding of the student's telepractice environment and require adequate training and support to engage in telepractice service delivery. Educators and allied health practitioners should consider students for telepractice on a case-by-case basis. Practitioners should proceed cautiously with telepractice reading and spelling assessment, intervention and instruction, with the knowledge that the current available evidence is of limited quality.","Furlong, Lisa; Serry, Tanya; Bridgman, Kate; Erickson, Shane",Int J Lang Commun Disord,,498
482227,Boletim diário Covid-19: edição 213 25/10/2020,2020,"BACKGROUND: Incidental radiographic findings, such as adrenal nodules, are commonly identified in imaging studies and documented in radiology reports. However, patients with such findings frequently do not receive appropriate follow-up, partially due to the lack of tools for the management of such findings and the time required to maintain up-to-date lists. Natural language processing (NLP) is capable of extracting information from free-text clinical documents and could provide the basis for software solutions that do not require changes to clinical workflows. OBJECTIVES: In this manuscript we present (1) a machine learning algorithm we trained to identify radiology reports documenting the presence of a newly discovered adrenal incidentaloma, and (2) the web application and results database we developed to manage these clinical findings. METHODS: We manually annotated a training corpus of 4,090 radiology reports from across our institution with a binary label indicating whether or not a report contains a newly discovered adrenal incidentaloma. We trained a convolutional neural network to perform this text classification task. Over the NLP backbone we built a web application that allows users to coordinate clinical management of adrenal incidentalomas in real time. RESULTS: The annotated dataset included 404 positive (9.9%) and 3,686 (90.1%) negative reports. Our model achieved a sensitivity of 92.9% (95% confidence interval: 80.9-97.5%), a positive predictive value of 83.0% (69.9-91.1)%, a specificity of 97.8% (95.8-98.9)%, and an F1 score of 87.6%. We developed a front-end web application based on the model's output. CONCLUSION: Developing an NLP-enabled custom web application for tracking and management of high-risk adrenal incidentalomas is feasible in a resource constrained, safety net hospital. Such applications can be used by an institution's quality department or its primary care providers and can easily be generalized to other types of clinical findings.","Bala, Wasif; Steinkamp, Jackson; Feeney, Timothy; Gupta, Avneesh; Sharma, Abhinav; Kantrowitz, Jake; Cordella, Nicholas; Moses, James; Drake, Frederick Thurston",Appl Clin Inform,,498

Our sample is junior high school teachers in Indonesia and the data are analyzed using the Structural Equation Model (SEM). We show that perceived usefulness has a positive influence on e-learning intentions. The perceived convenience is not the reason for the teachers to use e-learning because they have no other alternative in carrying out their duties apart from e-learning. Besides, we have also found that gender and experience influence e-learning intentions. The teachers with different genders and experiences continue to implement e-learning as their way of teaching during the pandemic. The younger teachers have a higher intention of using e-learning. They have adequate digital abilities and are more confident in using e-learning, so they have a great intention in implementing e-learning for the delivery of the materials. Experienced teachers will find it easier to find the use and convenience of e-learning. Apart from experience, male teachers also report that it is easier to grasp the ease of e-learning. However, older teachers show more concern about their perception of system usability as a reason for using e-learning than system convenience.","Nurkhin, Ahmad Mukhibad Hasan Ngabiyanto Harsono",European Journal of Educational Research,,498

Most of these polls, as well as the scientific research that has been conducted on vaccine hesitancy, was done prior to vaccine eligibility opening to all adults. Now that COVID-19 vaccines are widely available, further research is needed to understand the factors contributing to vaccine intentions across the vaccine hesitancy spectrum. This study conducted an online survey using the Social Science Research Solution (SSRS) Opinion Panel web panelists, representative of U.S. adults age 18 and older who use the internet, with an oversample of rural-dwelling and minority populations between April 8 and April 22, 2021- as vaccine eligibility opened to the country. We examined the relationship between COVID-19 exposure and socio-demographics with vaccine intentions [eager-to-take, wait-and-see, undecided, refuse] among the unvaccinated using multinomial logistic regressions [ref: fully/partially vaccinated]. Results showed vaccine intentions varied by demographic characteristics and risk exposures during the period that eligibility for the vaccine was extended to all adults. Funding statementFunding for this research was provided by a grant from the National Science Foundation (Grant #2049886).

Currently only few sequences are available from three states in India. Kerala was the first state to deposit complete sequence from two isolates followed by one from Gujarat. On April 27, 2020, the first five sequences from the state of West Bengal (Eastern India) were deposited on GISAID, a global initiative for sharing avian flu data. In this study, we have analysed the spike protein sequences from all five isolates and also compared their similarities or differences with other sequences reported in India and with isolates of Wuhan origin. We report one unique mutation at position 723 and another at 1124 in the S2 domain of spike protein of the isolates from West Bengal only. There was one mutation downstream of the receptor binding domain at position 614 in S1 domain which was common with the sequence from Gujarat (a state of western India). Mutation in the S2 domain showed changes in the secondary structure of the spike protein at region of the mutation. We also studied molecular dynamics using normal mode analyses and found that this mutation decreases the flexibility of S2 domain. Since both S1 and S2 are important in receptor binding followed by entry in the host cells, such mutations may define the affinity or avidity of receptor binding.","Begum, F.; Mukherjee, D.; Thagriki, D.; Das, S.; Tripathi, P.

488566,"[COVID-19 pandemic, professionalism, and the social contract]./ Pandemia COVID-19, profesionalismo y contrato social",2021,"Feline infectious peritonitis is a viral disease caused by a mutated strain of the the feline coronavirus (FCoV). The disease usually develops in cats in kennels, shelters, temporary shelters and more densely populated free groups of cats. The frequency is significantly higher among kittens and young cats. Mortality is extremely high once clinical signs appear. The virulence and infectious dose depend on the virus type and strain. Sick and infected animals, persistent carriers, contaminated litter trays, bowls and combs may be the source of infection. The virus is transmitted by indirect contact. Faeces contain FCoV at high concentrations, and the faeco-oral route of transmission is the most important. The incubation period is from 2 to 3 weeks to up to a few months, and sometimes years, depending on the immunological status of the animal. Two different forms of the disease have been distinguished: effusive (wet form) and non-effusive (dry form). The wet form is characterized by the accumulation of fluid in the body cavities, and the dry form by granulomatous infiltration of the parenchymal organs and intestines. Pathoanatomical and histological changes show that a combination of wet and dry forms of the disease is the most often. A reliable diagnosis is possible only by the post mortem pathohistological examination, which is considered the gold standard in the diagnosis of this disease. Treatment of feline infectious peritonitis involves only symptomatic therapy of the disease, as opposed to treating the cause. Feline coronavirus is widespread in a multi-cat environment, making it difficult to minimize the risk of spread of the infection. Vaccination is not routinely used in practice.","Eles, D.; Stritof, Z.",Veterinar,,498

Since COVID-19-related GBS cases have largely been reported in Europe, vaccines involving viral genetic materials can potentially trigger GBS, as demonstrated in clinical trials in the Americas. Therefore, medical professionals should be aware of GBS as a potential adverse reaction in SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Consultation with a neurologist may be needed. Nevertheless, this is not to say that the use of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 should be suspended and that the association between GBS and the vaccine is confirmed or excluded.

Given the importance of the presence of diabetes mellitus (DM) for host immunity, we retrospectively evaluated the clinical characteristics and outcomes of moderate-to-severe COVID-19 in patients with diabetes. METHODS: We conducted a multi-center observational study of 1,082 adult inpatients (aged &#8805;18 years) who were admitted to one of five university hospitals in Daegu because of the severity of their COVID-19-related disease. The demographic, laboratory, and radiologic findings, and the mortality, prevalence of severe disease, and duration of quarantine were compared between patients with and without DM. In addition, 1:1 propensity score (PS)-matching was conducted with the DM group. RESULTS: Compared with the non-DM group (n=847), patients with DM (n=235) were older, exhibited higher mortality, and required more intensive care. Even after PS-matching, patients with DM exhibited more severe disease, and DM remained a prognostic factor for higher mortality (hazard ratio, 2.40; 95% confidence interval, 1.38 to 4.15). Subgroup analysis revealed that the presence of DM was associated with higher mortality, especially in older people (&#8805;70 years old). Prior use of a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor or a renin-angiotensin system inhibitor did not affect mortality or the clinical severity of the disease. CONCLUSION: DM is a significant risk factor for COVID-19 severity and mortality. Our findings imply that COVID-19 patients with DM, especially if elderly, require special attention and prompt intensive care.","Kim, Mi Kyung; Jeon, Jae Han; Kim, Sung Woo; Moon, Jun Sung; Cho, Nan Hee; Han, Eugene; You, Ji Hong; Lee, Ji Yeon; Hyun, Miri; Park, Jae Seok; Kwon, Yong Shik; Choi, Yeon Kyung; Kwon, Ki Tae; Lee, Shin Yup; Jeon, Eon Ju; Kim, Jin Woo; Hong, Hyo Lim; Kwon, Hyun Hee; Jung, Chi Young; Lee, Yin Young; Ha, Eunyeoung; Chung, Seung Min; Hur, Jian; Ahn, June Hong; Kim, Na Young; Kim, Shin Woo; Chang, Hyun Ha; Lee, Yong Hoon; Lee, Jaehee; Park, Keun Gyu; Kim, Hyun Ah; Lee, Ji Hyun",Diabetes Metab J,,498

Quarantine measures during Chinese New Year effectively alleviated the spread of the epidemic, but they simultaneously resulted in a decline in anthropogenic emissions from industry, transportation, and import and export of goods. Herein, we present the major chemical composition of non-refractory PM2.5 (NR-PM2.5) and the concentrations of gaseous pollutants in an urban site in Shanghai before and during the quarantine period of the COVID-19 epidemic, which was Jan. 8-23 and Jan. 24-Feb. 8, respectively. The observed results show that the reduction in PM2.5 can be mainly attributed to decreasing concentrations of nitrate and primary aerosols. Nitrate accounted for 37% of NR-PM2.5 before the quarantine period when there was no emission reduction. During the quarantine period, the nitrate concentration decreased by approximately 60%, which is attributed to a reduction in the NOx concentration. Ammonium, as the main balancing cation, showed an approximately 45% simultaneous decrease in concentration. The concentrations of chloride and hydrocarbon-like organic aerosols from primary emissions also declined due to limited human activities. By contrast, sulphate and oxygenated organic aerosols showed a slight decrease in concentration, with their contributions increasing to 27% and 18%, respectively, during the quarantine period, which resulted in two pollution episodes with PM2.5 exceeding 100 µg/m3. This study provides a better understanding of the impact of quarantine measures on variations of the PM2.5 concentration and chemical compositions. Atmospheric oxidation capacities based on the oxidant (Ox = O3 + NO2) and oxidation ratios have been discussed for elucidating the source and formation of haze in an environment with lower anthropogenic emissions. With increasing contribution of secondary aerosols, lower NOx and nitrate concentrations did not completely avoid haze in Shanghai during the epidemic.","Chen, Hui; Huo, Juntao; Fu, Qingyan; Duan, Yusen; Xiao, Hang; Chen, Jianmin",Sci Total Environ,,498

This virus is disseminated through respiratory droplets, and, therefore, individuals residing in close quarters are at a higher risk for the acquisition of infection. The prison population is at a significantly increased risk for infection. METHODS: Prisoners from the Montford Correctional facility in Lubbock, Texas, hospitalized in the medical intensive care unit at University Medical Center between March 1, 2020 and May 15, 2020 were compared to community-based patients hospitalized in the same medical intensive care unit. Clinical information, laboratory results, radiographic results, management requirements, and outcomes were compared. RESULTS: A total of 15 community-based patients with a mean age of 67.4 ± 15.5 years were compared to 5 prisoners with a mean age of 56.0 ± 9.0 years. All prisoners were men; 10 community-based patients were men. Prisoners presented with fever, dyspnea, and GI symptoms. The mean number of comorbidities in prisoners was 2.4 compared to 1.8 in community-based patients. Prisoners had significantly lower heart rates and respiratory rates at presentation than community-based patients. The mean length of stay in prisoners was 12.6 ± 8.9 days; the mean length of stay in community-based patients was 8.6 ± 6.5. The case fatality rate was 60% in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Prisoners were younger than community-based patients but required longer lengths of stay and had the same mortality rate.

Although numerous drug and vaccine development efforts are underway, there are many outstanding questions on the mechanism of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral association to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), its main host receptor, and host cell entry. Structural and biophysical studies indicate some degree of flexibility in the viral extracellular spike glycoprotein and at the receptor-binding domain (RBD)-receptor interface, suggesting a role in infection. Here, we perform explicitly solvated, all-atom, molecular dynamics simulations of the glycosylated, full-length, membrane-bound ACE2 receptor in both an apo and spike RBD-bound state to probe the intrinsic dynamics of the ACE2 receptor in the context of the cell surface. A large degree of fluctuation in the full-length structure is observed, indicating hinge bending motions at the linker region connecting the head to the transmembrane helix while still not disrupting the ACE2 homodimer or ACE2-RBD interfaces. This flexibility translates into an ensemble of ACE2 homodimer conformations that could sterically accommodate binding of the spike trimer to more than one ACE2 homodimer and suggests a mechanical contribution of the host receptor toward the large spike conformational changes required for cell fusion. This work presents further structural and functional insights into the role of ACE2 in viral infection that can potentially be exploited for the rational design of effective SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics.","Barros, Emilia P; Casalino, Lorenzo; Gaieb, Zied; Dommer, Abigail C; Wang, Yuzhang; Fallon, Lucy; Raguette, Lauren; Belfon, Kellon; Simmerling, Carlos; Amaro, Rommie E",,,498

497347,Healthcare Professionals (Nurses') Perceived Stress and Coping: Amid COVID-19,2021,"PROBLEM: There is a paucity of guidance regarding implementation of telemedicine curricula at the clerkship level, particularly with students actively engaged in video and telephone encounters. The COVID-19 pandemic caused rapid shifts in the delivery of medical education to clerkship-level students. This article describes the successful pilot of a direct patient care, virtual health curriculum at the clerkship level and discusses lessons learned. APPROACH: All 18 preceptors and 5 students at Stanford University School of Medicine, California, enrolled in the required 4-week family medicine clerkship in April 2020 were connected as virtual partners via a commercial video platform. The combined use of both this video program and Epic electronic health record (EHR) software as modes for teaching and patient care led to technical challenges and logistical hurdles. As part of an iterative process, clerkship leadership identified problems via preceptor and student interviews and integrated that feedback in order to create a model for delivering high-quality, clerkship-level clinical instruction during the COVID-19 shelter in place order. OUTCOMES: Of those who completed an evaluation, the majority of preceptors (n = 16; 89%) and students (n = 4; 100%, 1 student did not respond) expressed satisfaction with the virtual, remote teaching model conducted over 37 clinic visits. A detailed 14-step process list resulted from identifying and addressing both audio and video technical challenges and is provided for use by other institutions that wish to implement this workflow. NEXT STEPS: Future directions include assessing patient perspectives on the involvement of students in virtual visits, soliciting patient input for a more robust patient-physician-student virtual experience, and integrating a multi-party platform, when available, via the EHR to afford greater student autonomy.","Rydel, Tracy A; Bajra, Rika; Schillinger, Erika",Acad. med,,498
498616,Graduate Medical Education Regulations 2019: Competency-driven contextual curriculum,2019,"Background: Infection with the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes a wide range of symptoms including gastrointestinal manifestations, and intestinal epithelial cells are a target of the virus. However, it is unknown how the intestinal immune system contributes to systemic immune responses in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods: We characterized peripheral blood lymphocytes from patients with active COVID-19 and convalescent patients as well as healthy controls by flow cytometry. Results: The frequency and absolute number of circulating memory T and B cells expressing the gut homing integrin &#945;4ß7 integrin was reduced during COVID-19, whether gastrointestinal symptoms were present or not. While total IgA-expressing B cells were increased, gut-imprinted B cells with IgA expression were stable. Conclusion: COVID-19 is associated with a decrease in circulating adaptive immune cells expressing the key gut homing marker &#945;4ß7 suggesting that these cells are preferentially recruited to extra-intestinal tissues independently of &#945;4ß7 or that the systemic immune response against SARS-CoV-2 is at least numerically dominated by extraintestinal, particularly pulmonary, immune cell priming.","Müller, Tanja M; Becker, Emily; Wiendl, Maximilian; Schulze, Lisa Lou; Voskens, Caroline; Völkl, Simon; Kremer, Andreas E; Neurath, Markus F; Zundler, Sebastian",Front Immunol,,498

Vaccine hesitancy and politicization of vaccine development has led to a pronounced distrust of COVID-19 vaccines in the U.S. A total of 1,381 vaccine-hesitant parents participated in this study. Participants indicated a general unwillingness to vaccinate their children (M = 3.55, SD = 2.13) and themselves (M = 3.58, SD = 2.16) when a COVID-19 vaccine becomes available. More educated parents were more likely to plan to vaccinate themselves [F(5, 533) = 9.93, p < .05] and their children [F(5, 533) = 10.278, p < .05].

The most common intubation associated laryngeal injuries are characterised by vocal cord oedema, mucosal ulceration, laryngeal granulomas and vocal cord paralysis. Laryngeal stenosis is seen much less commonly and generally presents with posterior adhesions from prolonged intubation or anterior webbing from instrumentation. The finding of adhesions between the vocal cords at the middle third of the glottis without anterior or posterior adhesions and in the absence of previous laryngeal surgery is rare. The authors present a case of a patient with Covid-19 (SARS-CoV-2) who was discovered to have this finding following admission to the Intensive Care Unit for ventilation, tracheostomy for weaning and subsequent failure to decannulate. The patient underwent a microlaryngoscopy and frank adhesions between the middle third of the vocal cords were noted. The authors feel that the mucosal inflammatory component associated with Covid-19 was a significant contributing factor in this clinical finding. Following successful divisions of the adhesions, the patient made a full recovery.","Leopard, Mr Daniel; Moorhouse, Mr Tobias",Trends Anaesth. Crit. Care,,498

502065,[Social Media and Medical Education in COVID-19 pandemic],2020,"Spraying roads with water on a large scale in Chinese cities is one of the supplementary precaution or mitigation actions implemented to control severe air pollution events or heavy haze-fog events in which the mechanisms causing them are not yet fully understood. These air pollution events were usually characterized by higher air humidity. Therefore, there may be a link between this action and air pollution. In the present study, the impact of water spraying on the PM2.5 concentration and humidity in air was assessed by measuring chemical composition of the water, undertaking a simulated water spraying experiment, measuring residues and analyzing relevant data. We discovered that spraying large quantities of tap or river water on the roads leads to increased PM2.5 concentration and humidity, and that daily continuous spraying produces a cumulative effect on air pollution. Spraying the same amount of water produces greater increases in humidity and PM2.5 concentration during cool autumn and winter than during hot summer. Our results demonstrate that spraying roads with water increases, rather than decreases, the concentration of PM2.5 and thus is a new source of anthropogenic aerosol and air pollution. The higher vapor content and resultant humidity most likely create unfavorable meteorological conditions for the dispersion of air pollution in autumn and winter with low temperature.","Tan, Fengzhu Guo Yuming Zhang Wei Xu Xingyan Zhang Ming Fan Meng Liu Sicen Li Shanshan Morawska Lidia",Toxics,,498
502126,"Medical Education in the United States and Canada, 2020",2020,"SARS-CoV-2 are enveloped positive-stranded RNA viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm. It relies on the fusion of their envelope with the host cell membrane to deliver their nucleocapsid into the host cell. The spike glycoprotein (S) mediates virus entry into cells via the human Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) protein located on many cell types and tissues' outer surface. This study, therefore, aimed to design and synthesize novel pyrazolone-based compounds as potential inhibitors that would interrupt the interaction between the viral spike protein and the host cell receptor to prevent SARS-CoV 2 entrance into the cell. A series of pyrazolone compounds as potential SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors were designed and synthesized. Employing computational techniques, the inhibitory potentials of the designed compounds against both spike protein and hACE2 were evaluated. Results of the binding free energy from the in-silico analysis, showed that three compounds (7i, 7k and 8f) and six compounds (7b, 7h, 7k, 8d, 8g, and 8h) showed higher and better binding high affinity to SARS-CoV-2 Sgp and hACE-2, respectively compared to the standard drugs cefoperazone (CFZ) and MLN-4760. Furthermore, the outcome of the structural analysis of the two proteins upon binding of the inhibitors showed that the two proteins (SARS-CoV-2 Sgp and hACE-2) were stable, and the structural integrity of the proteins was not compromised. This study suggests pyrazolone-based compounds might be potent blockers of the viral entry into the host cells.","Obakachi, Vincent A; Kushwaha, Narva Deshwar; Kushwaha, Babita; Mahlalela, Mavela Cleopus; Shinde, Suraj Raosaheb; Kehinde, Idowu; Karpoormath, Rajshekhar",J Mol Struct,,498

ObjectivesTo explore the perception and preparedness of international medical students residing in university hostels amid the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. DesignA semi-structured interview guide was developed in this qualitative study design. All the interviews were audio-taped, transcribed verbatim, and then analyzed for thematic contents by standard content analysis framework. SettingInterviews were conducted in university hostels in Punjab, Pakistan. ParticipantsA total of 11 international medical students were interviewed face-to-face through the purposive sampling technique to obtain in-depth individual viewpoints. ResultsThe thematic content analysis yielded five major themes: Familiarity with COVID-19, Perceptions and attitudes towards COVID-19, Preparedness for safety against COVID-19, Barriers to lifestyle, and Psychological perspectives. A better general perception and preparedness among international medical students regarding COVID-19 was found. Good knowledge regarding the overview of COVID-19; adequate preventive approaches such as social distancing, use of masks, gloves, and sanitizers; and compliance with the lockdown measures were reported by the respondents. The pertinent issue raised by the respondents is the disturbance in normal routine due to distortion in social life and isolation that may cause psychological stress. ConclusionsThe findings from this study lighten the peoples perspectives that help the government to prepare public health strategies based on population-focused approaches. The present study demonstrates the respondents opinion on COVID-19 management by personal hygiene, social distancing, and complying with the lockdown measures. Furthermore, it demands that timely and evidence-based teaching-learning techniques should be adopted for students engagement which ensures mental health and self-motivation as well.

Meanwhile, the ecological impacts must be considered by researchers to minimize the hazardous effects of research laboratories. Favipiravir (FAV) is an antiviral agent recently approved for treatment of COVID-19 infections during 2020 pandemic crisis, so the size of its production by international pharmaceutical corporations evolved dramatically within the past few months. Two novel simple, sensitive, and green methods were developed and validated for FAV determination based on solvent-free micellar LC and spectrofluorimetry techniques. To improve FAV native fluorescence, several factors were studied including solvent type, buffering, pH and added surfactants. The best sensitivity for FAV fluorescence was obtained in Britton-Robinson buffer (pH 4) at 436 nm after excitation at 323 nm within concentration range of 20-350 ng mL-1. Another HPLC method was validated using C18-RP (5µm, 250 x 4.6 mm) stationary phase and solvent-free mobile phase consisting of (0.02M Brij-35, 0.15M SDS, and 0.02M disodium hydrogen phosphate, pH 5.0) isocratically eluted at a flow rate of 1 mL min-1 and detection wavelength of 323nm. LC method was validated across concentration range of 10-100 µg mL-1 and FAV eluted in 3.8 min. The methods were validated according to the FDA guidelines and were applied successfully for determination of FAV in its marketed tablet dosage forms and in spiked human plasma samples. The proposed methods are eco-friendly since they are typically based on biodegradable reagents in aqueous solvent-free phases, which was proven by their assessment on two recent greenness metrics (GAPI and AGREE) to prove their eco-friendly properties.","Mikhail, Ibraam E; Elmansi, Heba; Belal, Fathalla; Ehab Ibrahim, Adel",Microchem J,,498

We introduce ASMODEE (automatic selection of models and outlier detection for epidemics), a new tool for detecting sudden changes in COVID-19 incidence. Our approach relies on automatically selecting the best (fitting or predicting) model from a range of user-defined time series models, excluding the most recent data points, to characterize the main trend in an incidence. We then derive prediction intervals and classify data points outside this interval as outliers, which provides an objective criterion for identifying departures from previous trends. We also provide a method for selecting the optimal breakpoints, used to define how many recent data points are to be excluded from the trend fitting procedure. The analysis of simulated COVID-19 outbreaks suggests ASMODEE compares favourably with a state-of-art outbreak-detection algorithm while being simpler and more flexible. As such, our method could be of wider use for infectious disease surveillance. We illustrate ASMODEE using publicly available data of National Health Service (NHS) Pathways reporting potential COVID-19 cases in England at a fine spatial scale, showing that the method would have enabled the early detection of the flare-ups in Leicester and Blackburn with Darwen, two to three weeks before their respective lockdown.

Youth may be uniquely impacted by physical distancing requirements during the pandemic, including limited socialization opportunities, closures of educational institutions, a lack of meaningful extracurricular activities and adverse implications on key developmental milestones. Due to the potential impact of COVID-19 on youth well-being, the need to rapidly transform services to be accessible, and the potential risks associated with this rapid transformation, it is imperative that youth continue to be engaged in research and service development. Young people's perspectives, strengths and skills need to be considered to effectively adapt the delivery of mental health services. Continuing to center youth engagement in mental health research throughout the pandemic can ensure research questions, programs, and services align with the needs and preferences of youth. In this commentary, we pose three recommendations for conducting youth-engaged mental health research during the pandemic, including adapting youth engagement strategies when rapid decisions must be made, the use of tools for virtual engagement, and suggestions for evaluating youth engagement practices. These strategies and principles may be applicable to other scenarios where rapid research or system transformation would benefit from youth engagement, such as time-limited child research by trainees (e.g., dissertations) or natural disasters.","Allemang, B.; Cullen, O.; Schraeder, K.; Pintson, K.; Dimitropoulos, G.",Journal of the Canadian Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry,,498

Among these, COVID-19 has greater transmission and mortality rate. 2019 nCoV belongs to a large family of positive sense single-stranded RNA viruses (+ssRNA) that can be isolated in different animal species. The most communal symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough, and shortness of breath during the incubation period (2-14 days) of infection. COVID-19 transmission is occurring from infected humans to close contact with one another through respiratory droplets, coughs, and sneezes of infected person. Moreover, the virus containing surfaces may also transmit the infection. Diagnosis is being carried out by collecting a nasopharyngeal swab or sputum specimen for detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Rapid diagnosing methods are also under development which can diagnose COVID 19 in few minutes to hours. Currently, there is no specific cure or preventive therapeutics available.

505960,Distant virtual medical education during COVID-19: Half a loaf of bread,2020,"Objective: To study the pattern of admissions in a psychiatry ward during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and compare the sociodemographic and clinical profiles of patients admitted in 2020 with admissions in 2019.Methods: The case record files of an inpatient psychiatric unit from March 23 to September 22, 2019, and March 23 to September 22, 2020 were retrieved. Sociodemographic data, admission criteria of the patients, clinical diagnosis (as per ICD-10 criteria), duration of stay in the ward, and details of capacity assessment were assessed. The data collected were tabulated as per coding system and analyzed and compared using statistical analysis system software.Results: Of a total of 312 admissions, 236 were in 2019 and 76 were in 2020 (P < .05), which was a significant (P < .05) decrease. More patients admitted in 2020 were in the age group of 30-39 years (P < .05), were residents of Chandigarh (P < .05), were housewives by occupation (P < .05), had incomes < 3,500 Indian rupees (US$ 48.01) per month (P < .01), were Hindu, and belonged to extended families (P < .05). The predominant reasons for admission in 2020 were complicated withdrawals, noncompliance to treatment (P < .05), and aggravation of psychiatric illness due to comorbid substance use. The ICD diagnoses schizophrenia, schizotypal and delusional disorder (F20-29) and mood disorders, predominantly mania (F30-31) were significantly higher and mental and behavioral disorder due to psychoactive substance use (F10-19) was lower among patients admitted in 2020.Conclusions: The results show that the numbers of admissions to the psychiatry ward in 2020 were significantly lower than pre-COVID 2019, and the predominant reasons for admission were complicated withdrawals due to psychoactive substance abuse and noncompliance to treatment. Also, the mean duration of stay was longer in 2020 compared to the previous year.","Sidana, Ajeet; Goel, Vibha; Kaur, Sahildeep",Prim. care companion CNS disord. (Online),,498

However, its mode of action and enzyme-selective inhibition mechanism have remained elusive. Intriguingly, MTh inhibits some thiamine diphosphate (ThDP) enzymes, while being coenzymatically active in others. Here we report the strong inhibition of Escherichia coli transketolase activity by MTh and unravel its mode of action and the structural basis thereof. The unique 2'-methoxy group of MTh diphosphate (MThDP) clashes with a canonical glutamate required for cofactor activation in ThDP-dependent enzymes. This glutamate is forced into a stable, anticatalytic low-barrier hydrogen bond with a neighboring glutamate, disrupting cofactor activation. Molecular dynamics simulations of transketolases and other ThDP enzymes identify active-site flexibility and the topology of the cofactor-binding locale as key determinants for enzyme-selective inhibition. Human enzymes either retain enzymatic activity with MThDP or preferentially bind authentic ThDP over MThDP, while core bacterial metabolic enzymes are inhibited, demonstrating therapeutic potential.","Rabe von Pappenheim, Fabian; Aldeghi, Matteo; Shome, Brateen; Begley, Tadhg; de Groot, Bert L; Tittmann, Kai",Nat. chem. biol,,498
506231,An analysis of the ethics of lockdown in India,2020,"BACKGROUND: Vaccine hesitancy could undermine the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination programs. Knowledge about people's lived experiences regarding COVID-19 vaccination can enhance vaccine promotion and increase uptake. AIM: To use COVID-19 vaccine trial participants' experiences to identify key themes in the lived experience of vaccination early in the vaccine approval and distribution process. METHODS: We interviewed 31 participants in the Iowa City, Iowa US site of the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine phase 3 clinical trial. While trial participation differs from clinical receipt of an approved vaccine in key ways, it offers the first view of people's lived experiences of potentially receiving a COVID-19 vaccine. The trial context is also useful since decision-making about vaccination and medical research participation often involve similar hopes and concerns, and because the public appears to view even approved COVID-19 vaccines as experimental given their novelty. Semi-structured interviews addressed subjects' experiences, including decision-making and telling others about their trial participation. We analyzed verbatim transcripts of these interviews thematically and identified common themes relevant for vaccination decision-making. RESULTS: Participants across demographic groups, including age, sex/gender, race/ethnicity, and political affiliation, described largely similar experiences. Key motivations for participation included ending the pandemic/restoring normalcy, protecting oneself and others, doing one's duty, promoting/modeling vaccination, and expressing aspects of identity like being a helper, career-related motivations, and support of science/vaccines. Participants often felt uniquely qualified to help via trial participation due to personal attributes like health, sex/gender or race/ethnicity. They reported hearing concerns about side effects and the speed and politicization of vaccine development. Participants responded by normalizing and contextualizing side effects, de-politicizing vaccine development, and explaining how the rapid development process was nevertheless safe. CONCLUSION: These findings regarding participants' reported motivations for trial participation and interactions with concerned others can be incorporated into COVID-19 vaccine promotion messaging aimed at similar populations.","Wentzell, Emily; Racila, Ana-Monica",Vaccine,,498

Study the usefulness of the specially designed Tracheostomy Shield. A prospective hospital-based study was conducted at a tertiary care center in India treating COVID and Non COVID patients. The study was done from April 2020 to December 2020. A total of 80 tracheostomy were done using Tracheostomy shield. Open tracheostomies were 38 while 42 patients were already intubated (closed circuit). The Tracheostomy shield was also used in 380 tracheostomy tubes changes. Two patients were found COVID positive on RT-PCR after tracheostomy. There was no scope for testing all tube changes with RT-PCR. The use of our indigenously designed Tracheostomy shield has been effective in reducing the aerosol spread and there was no COVID transmission reported. The use of patient Tracheostomy shield is of uttermost importance in reducing the respiratory droplets splashing on to the surgeon and assistant while doing awake tracheostomy. It is extremely useful while changing tubes as there are chances of false negatives antigen test which might be miss leading.

The psychological health of college students also faces great challenges. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and the related factors of depressive symptoms among Chinese college students. METHODS: This online cross-sectional survey was conducted via Wenjuanxing platform from March 3-15, 2020 and received 1681 effective questionnaires. Each questionnaire contains the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale, the Multi-Dimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support, the Herth Hope Index, and the self-designed items. Multivariable logistic regression was conducted to determine the significantly associated factors of depressive symptoms. RESULTS: The prevalence of depressive symptoms among college students was 56.8%. Sleep problems (OR 2.678, 95%CI 2.094-3.424), family members' going out (OR 1.775, 95%CI 1.089-2.894), perceived more stress for online education (OR 1.642, 95%CI 1.191-2.263), fear of COVID-19 (OR 1.450, 95%CI 1.121-1.876), influence on social interaction (OR 1.354, 95%CI 1.053-1.741) and higher grade (OR 1.378, 95%CI 1.046-1.816) were considered as risk factors of depressive symptoms.

However, the effect of this variant on viral spread and vaccine efficacy remains to be defined. Here we engineered the spike D614G substitution in the USA-WA1/2020 SARS-CoV-2 strain, and found that it enhances viral replication in human lung epithelial cells and primary human airway tissues by increasing the infectivity and stability of virions. Hamsters infected with SARS-CoV-2 expressing spike(D614G) (G614 virus) produced higher infectious titres in nasal washes and the trachea, but not in the lungs, supporting clinical evidence showing that the mutation enhances viral loads in the upper respiratory tract of COVID-19 patients and may increase transmission. Sera from hamsters infected with D614 virus exhibit modestly higher neutralization titres against G614 virus than against D614 virus, suggesting that the mutation is unlikely to reduce the ability of vaccines in clinical trials to protect against COVID-19, and that therapeutic antibodies should be tested against the circulating G614 virus. Together with clinical findings, our work underscores the importance of this variant in viral spread and its implications for vaccine efficacy and antibody therapy.","Plante, Jessica A; Liu, Yang; Liu, Jianying; Xia, Hongjie; Johnson, Bryan A; Lokugamage, Kumari G; Zhang, Xianwen; Muruato, Antonio E; Zou, Jing; Fontes-Garfias, Camila R; Mirchandani, Divya; Scharton, Dionna; Bilello, John P; Ku, Zhiqiang; An, Zhiqiang; Kalveram, Birte; Freiberg, Alexander N; Menachery, Vineet D; Xie, Xuping; Plante, Kenneth S; Weaver, Scott C; Shi, Pei-Yong",Nature (Lond.),,498
511436,Has the COVID-19 pandemic had a positive impact on scientific production in medical education?: A bibliometric analysis,2021,"COVID-19 has placed additional challenges on mental health services. Video consultations (VCs) have provided a short-term solution to lockdown restrictions but could also increase long-term capacity to meet the anticipated rising demand. A total of 7752 VCs were conducted over six weeks. Thematic analysis of 474 online survey responses identified twenty patient attributes that influenced staffs' decisions to offer VCs. Their opinions were diverse, at times contradictory, and not always evidence based. There was reasonable consensus (and published evidence to support) of the probable suitability of VC for patients who: are IT savvy and suitably equipped;are teenagers;live in remote/rural locations;have caring responsibilities;have anxiety disorders or express a preference. No consensus was reached regarding eight attributes and there was a corresponding paucity of evidence, indicating the need for further research. Conversely, old age;paranoia, sensory impairment/communication difficulties;high risk and trauma/PTSD (posttraumatic stress disorder) were generally seen as contraindicated by staff, despite published evidence of success elsewhere. It may be possible to overcome staff's reticence to offer these groups VCs. As staff are effectively the gatekeepers to VC interventions, it is important to understand and support them to overcome reservations that are contrary to the empirical evidence base. This will ensure that their initial anxieties do not become unnecessary barriers to services for those most in need. As with all mental healthcare, such decisions should be made collaboratively, and on an individual basis.","Painter, J.; Turner, J.; Procter, P.",Healthcare,,498
511832,Clinical course and risk factors for mortality from COVID-19 in patients with haematological malignancies,2020,"In recent years, the gravitational curvatures, the third-order derivatives of the gravitational potential (GP), of a tesseroid have been introduced in the context of gravity field modeling. Analogous to the gravity field, magnetic field modeling can be expanded by magnetic curvatures (MC), the third-order derivatives of the magnetic potential (MP), which are the change rates of the magnetic gradient tensor (MGT). Exploiting Poisson's relations between ( n + 1 ) th-order derivatives of the GP and nth-order derivatives of the MP, this paper derives expressions for the MC of a uniformly magnetized tesseroid using the fourth-order derivatives of the GP of a uniform tesseroid expressed in terms of the Cartesian kernel functions. Based on the magnetic effects of a uniform spherical shell, all expressions for the MP, magnetic vector (MV), MGT and MC of tesseroids have been examined for numerical problems due to singularity of the respective integral kernels (i.e., near zone and polar singularity problems). For this, the closed analytical expressions for the MP, MV, MGT and MC of the uniform spherical shell have been provided and used to generate singularity-free reference values. Varying both height and latitude of the computation point, it is found numerically that the near zone problem also exists for all magnetic quantities (i.e., MP, MV, MGT and MC). The numerical tests also reveal that the polar singularity problems do not occur for the magnetic quantity as a result of the use of Cartesian as opposed to spherical integral kernels. This demonstrates that the magnetic quantity including the newly derived MC 'inherit' the same numerical properties as the corresponding gravitational functional. Possible future applications (e.g., geophysical information) of the MC formulas of a uniformly magnetized tesseroid could be improved modeling of the Earth's magnetic field by dedicated satellite missions.","Deng, Xiao-Le; Shen, Wen-Bin; Kuhn, Michael; Hirt, Christian; Pail, Roland",Surv Geophys,,498

METHOD: This cross-sectional study was performed using a self-administered online survey, covering parents' and their children's characteristics, parents' willingness and attitudes towards the COVID-19 vaccine. A total of 1035 parents participated. RESULTS: Analysis showed that 36.3% of parents were willing to have their children receive the COVID-19 vaccine and that 59.9% were willing to receive it themselves. In addition, 83.9% were willing to have their children vaccinated with the COVID-19 vaccine if the mortality rates associated with COVID-19 in children increased following a mutation. After adjusting for significant variables, willingness to receive the COVID-19 vaccine (AOR = 24.91; 95% CI = 10.93-56.76), willingness for their children to participate in a COVID-19 vaccine trial (AOR = 11â.87; 95% CI = 2.41-58.40] and advising others to receive the COVID-19 vaccine [AOR = 7.82; 95% CI = 2.50-24.49] were associated with greater parents' willingness for their children to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: Parents' willingness for their children to receive the COVID-19 vaccine was low. The only characteristics of either parents or children found to affect the parents' willingness for children to receive the COVID-19 vaccine was the parents being healthcare workers.

However, the participation of protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) in different exocytosis stages has not been defined. Here we demonstrate that PTP-MEG2 controls multiple steps of catecholamine secretion. Biochemical and crystallographic analyses reveal key residues that govern the interaction between PTP-MEG2 and its substrate, a peptide containing the phosphorylated NSF-pY83 site, specify PTP-MEG2 substrate selectivity, and modulate the fusion of catecholamine-containing vesicles. Unexpectedly, delineation of PTP-MEG2 mutants along with the NSF binding interface reveals that PTP-MEG2 controls the fusion pore opening through NSF independent mechanisms. Utilizing bioinformatics search and biochemical and electrochemical screening approaches, we uncover that PTP-MEG2 regulates the opening and extension of the fusion pore by dephosphorylating the DYNAMIN2-pY125 and MUNC18-1-pY145 sites. Further structural and biochemical analyses confirmed the interaction of PTP-MEG2 with MUNC18-1-pY145 or DYNAMIN2-pY125 through a distinct structural basis compared with that of the NSF-pY83 site.

This study describes the utilization of the Tufts University School of Dental Medicine (TUSDM) emergency dental clinic during the peak surge in COVID-19 cases in Massachusetts, highlighting the number of endodontic emergencies. METHODS: Aggregate data from clinical encounters and call records to an emergency triage phone line from March 30 through May 8, 2020 were used to describe the characteristics of dental emergencies, clinical encounters and procedures performed. RESULTS: A total of 466 patient interactions occurred during this period, resulting in 199 patients advised by phone and 267 clinical encounters. The most common dental emergencies were severe dental pain from pulpal inflammation (27.7% of clinical encounters) followed by surgical post-operative visit (13.1%). The most frequent procedures were extractions (13.9% of clinical encounters) and surgical follow up (13.5%). 50.2% of the clinical encounters were categorized as aerosol-generating, and 86.1% of encounters would have required treatment in a hospital emergency department if dental care was not available. There were no known transmissions of SARS-CoV-2 among clinic providers, patients, or staff during this period. CONCLUSIONS: These results highlight the importance of endodontic diagnosis and treatment in the provision of emergency dental care during a pandemic, and demonstrates that dental treatment can be provided in a manner that minimizes the risk of viral transmission, maintaining continuity of care for a large patient population.","Langella, Jessica; Magnuson, Britta; Finkelman, Matthew D; Amato, Robert",J. endod,,498

515108,"COVID-19, social distancing, and effects on human behavior",2021,"This study's motivation is to investigate the association between the stock market, remittance, and the pandemic of COVID-19 for the period from March 3, 2020, to December 14, 2020. For evaluating the impact of COVID-19 and remittances on stock market behaviour during the pandemic, the study applies Autoregressive Distributed lagged (ARDL) for magnitudes estimation and directional association through the Toda-Yamamoto causality test. Study findings from ARDL estimation revealed that COVID-19 measured by detecting new cases negatively influences the stock market both in the long-term and short-term. Remittance positively influences the stock market behaviour, particularly in the long-term. Furthermore, the directional causality test disclosed unidirectional causal effects between COVID-19 and the stock market behaviour, which establishes all proxy measures for the equation's stock market. The hypothesis results explain the causal relationship between remittance inflows and the stock market in Bangladesh. The study's application will help policymakers rethink the policies for channelizing remittances for productive investment areas. Furthermore, the study's findings will reinstate the widely perceived notions, which is the critical role of remittance in the economy even though the economy passes through a great pandemic.","Qamruzzaman, M.; Karim, S.; Jahan, I.",Journal of Asian Finance Economics and Business,,498

Independent, well-powered studies could further our understanding of this association. Objective: To examine whether low levels of vitamin D are associated with SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity, an indicator of previous infection. Design, Setting, and Participants: This is a cohort study of employees and spouses who elected to be tested for SARS-CoV-2 IgG as part of an annual employer-sponsored health screening program conducted in August to November 2020. This program includes commonly assessed demographic, biometric, and laboratory variables, including total vitamin D measurement. Baseline (prepandemic) levels of vitamin D and potential confounders were obtained from screening results from the previous year (September 2019 to January 2020). Data analysis was performed from December 2020 to March 2021. Exposures: Low total serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D, defined as either less than 20 ng/mL or less than 30 ng/mL. Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcome was SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity, as determined with US Food and Drug Administration emergency use-authorized assays. The association of SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity with vitamin D levels was assessed by multivariable logistic regression analyses and propensity score analyses. Results: The 18â¯148 individuals included in this study had test results for SARS-CoV-2 IgG in 2020 and vitamin D levels from the prepandemic and pandemic periods. Their median (interquartile range) age was 47 (37-56) years, 12â¯170 (67.1%) were women, 900 (5.0%) were seropositive, 4498 (24.8%) had a vitamin D level less than 20 ng/mL, and 10â¯876 (59.9%) had a vitamin D level less than 30 ng/mL before the pandemic. In multivariable models adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, body mass index, blood pressure, smoking status, and geographical location, SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity was not associated with having a vitamin D level less than 20 ng/mL before (odds ratio [OR], 1.04; 95% CI, 0.88-1.22) or during (OR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.79-1.09) the pandemic; it was also not associated with having a vitamin D level less than 30 ng/mL before (OR, 1.09; 95% CI, 0.93-1.27) or during (OR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.91-1.23) the pandemic. Similar results were observed in propensity score analyses. SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity was associated with obesity (OR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.08-1.46), not having a college degree (OR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.21-1.62), and Asian (OR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.13-1.87), Black (OR, 2.74; 95% CI, 2.25-3.34), Hispanic (OR, 2.65; 95% CI, 2.15-3.27), American Indian or Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander (OR, 2.01; OR, 1.54-2.62) race/ethnicity, and was inversely associated with high blood pressure (OR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.70-0.96), smoking (OR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.47-0.78), and residing in the US Northeast (OR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.62-0.92) and West (OR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.44-0.67).

517516,"Household time activities, food waste, and diet quality: the impact of non-marginal changes due to COVID-19",2021,"We consider a novel method to increase the reliability of COVID-19 virus or antibody tests by using specially designed pooled testings. Instead of testing nasal swab or blood samples from individual persons, we propose to test mixtures of samples from many individuals. The pooled sample testing method proposed in this paper also serves a different purpose: for increasing test reliability and providing accurate diagnoses even if the tests themselves are not very accurate. Our method uses ideas from compressed sensing and error-correction coding to correct for a certain number of errors in the test results. The intuition is that when each individual's sample is part of many pooled sample mixtures, the test results from all of the sample mixtures contain redundant information about each individual's diagnosis, which can be exploited to automatically correct for wrong test results in exactly the same way that error correction codes correct errors introduced in noisy communication channels. While such redundancy can also be achieved by simply testing each individual's sample multiple times, we present simulations and theoretical arguments that show that our method is significantly more efficient in increasing diagnostic accuracy. In contrast to group testing and compressed sensing which aim to reduce the number of required tests, this proposed error correction code idea purposefully uses pooled testing to increase test accuracy, and works not only in the""undersampling""regime, but also in the""oversampling""regime, where the number of tests is bigger than the number of subjects. The results in this paper run against traditional beliefs that,""even though pooled testing increased test capacity, pooled testings were less reliable than testing individuals separately.""","Yi, Jirong; Cho, Myung; Wu, Xiaodong; Xu, Weiyu; Mudumbai, Raghu",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.14919v1.pdf,498

A tale from teachers of different educational stages,2021,"INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: We aimed to evaluate how the corona virus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak influenced emergency department (ED) admissions for urolithiasis, hospitalizations and clinical management of the hospitalized patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a multicentric retrospective analysis of ED admissions in three high volume urology departments (one directly involved in COVID-19 patients management and two not involved) in Rome - Italy between March and April 2020 and in the same period of 2019. Statistical analysis was conducted on the number of admissions for urolithiasis, rate of complications, hospitalization and the type of treatment received. RESULTS: 304 patients were included in the analysis. A significant reduction in the global number of patients admitted to ED for urolithiasis between 2019 and 2020 (48.8%) was noted. Moreover, regarding the choice of treatment of hospitalized patients, a statistically significant increase of stone removal procedures versus urinary drainage was reported in 2020 (p = 0.015). CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic in Rome there has been a significant reduction of emergency admissions for urolithiasis. Patients admitted to ED had more complications, more frequently need hospitalization and regarding clinical management early stone removal was preferred over urinary drainage only. All the urologists should be aware that in the next months they could face an increased number of admissions for urolithiasis and manage more complicated cases.","Antonucci, M; Recupero, S M; Marzio, V; De Dominicis, M; Pinto, F; Foschi, N; Di Gianfrancesco, L; Bassi, P; Ragonese, M",Actas urol. esp,,498
518769,Is GLP-1R Agonists Effective and Safe in Severe COVID-19 Patients with Type 2 Diabetes? - A Case Report and Literature Review,2020,"Effective SARS-CoV-2 antiviral drugs are desperately needed. The SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) appears as an attractive target for drug development. We show that the existing pharmacopeia contains many drugs with potential for therapeutic repurposing as selective and potent inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. We screened a collection of ~6,070 drugs with a previous history of use in humans for compounds that inhibit the activity of Mpro in vitro and found ~50 compounds with activity against Mpro. Subsequent dose validation studies demonstrated 8 dose responsive hits with an IC50 &#8804; 50 µM. Hits from our screen are enriched with hepatitis C NS3/4A protease targeting drugs including boceprevir, ciluprevir. narlaprevir, and telaprevir. This work suggests previous large-scale commercial drug development initiatives targeting hepatitis C NS3/4A viral protease should be revisited because some previous lead compounds may be more potent against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro than boceprevir and suitable for rapid repurposing.","Baker, Jeremy D; Uhrich, Rikki L; Kraemer, Gerald C; Love, Jason E; Kraemer, Brian C",PLoS One,,498

A Narrative Review with a Focus on Stress-Reducing Interventions that may Improve Defence against COVID-19],2021,"Background: COVID-19 was reported in several studies characterized by milder clinical course, benign disease, and peculiar epidemiologic patterns among pediatric patients compared to adults' disease. However, other studies indicated that critical cases also exist and are associated with preexisting cardiopulmonary comorbidities and concurrent multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. Methods: The study period was six months, May-October 2020. Data on demographics, clinical manifestations, laboratory abnormalities were extracted from the patients' hospital records. During the study period, 644 pediatric patients attended the hospital. They were all screened for SARS-CoV-2 using RT-PCR. Only the confirmed positive patients were included in the subsequent study analysis. They were hospitalized either in the general pediatric wards (GPW) or pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). Results: Out of the total patients screened, 79 (12.3%) children were confirmed to have COVID-19 infection. All the confirmed COVID-19 patients were either admitted to the general pediatric wards (58;73.4%) or PICU (21;26.6%). The admission diagnoses for these children were acute gastroenteritis (22.85%), acute pneumonia (19%), clinical sepsis (17.7%), and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (10.1%). A significantly higher percentage of the PICU admitted patients showed shortness of breath (SOB) (P= 0.016). Respiratory insufficiencies, prematurity, and congenital heart diseases are the most reported comorbid conditions among the admitted children. The oxygen saturation was significantly lower among PICU patients than those in GPW (P=0.001). The total hospital stays differ significantly between the two groups, which were ten days for the PICU group compared to 4.5 days for the GPW group with a statistical significance noted (P= 0.001). Conclusion: Despite the observable variations in the clinical and laboratory findings among the hospitalized pediatric COVID-19 patients, no serious consequences among all patients were observed. The history of SOB and the initial oxygen saturation level were significantly associated with PICU admissions.","Asseri, A.

The lockdown policy has resulted in limited movement of farmers in carrying out social and economic activities. This study aims to identify those difficulties for horticultural farmers’ households during the COVID-19 outbreak and analyze its impact on household income. We had carried out an online household survey, for data collection by interviewing 86 horticulture farmers, who were randomly sampled in two horticulture production centers in Tanah Datar District. We found that almost 50% of farmers are having difficulty accessing agricultural inputs during the pandemic, such as seeds, fertilizers, and pesticides. This happened because of implementing a lockdown policy., which disrupts farmers’ smooth access to farm inputs. However, although almost half of the farmers have difficulty accessing farm inputs, the regression results show that the COVID-19 outbreak does not significantly affect household income. Based on our research, 96.5% of farmers were still farming and 55.8% of them were still working in the fields as usual. The difficulty for horticultural farmer’s households during the Covid-19 outbreak was increasing household expenditure such as for communication, health, education, and social/religion.

We surveyed faculty about their experience during the early weeks of adapting to these new instructional techniques. METHODS: An anonymous quantitative and qualitative survey was distributed to all individuals registered by programs as Physician Assistant Education Association members. RESULTS: The survey response rate was 22.3% (667/2991) with 32% of program directors (PD), and 23.7% of faculty reporting they had taught online synchronous content prior to COVID-19 adaptations. Prior experience with technology was associated with significantly lower levels of faculty stress during the pivot to online instruction. A majority of the respondents felt educational quality had remained consistent despite the transition to online teaching, and a majority of both faculty and program directors anticipate only minor changes to program structure once they are able to return to traditional classroom learning. Concerns about technology were most commonly cited as stressors and as causes of decreased quality of instruction. CONCLUSION: Educational challenges and stress during the pandemic were most prominently associated with unfamiliar technology.

592430,Flight safety during Covid-19: A study of Charles de Gaulle airport atypical energy approaches,2021-02-18,"The presence of many completely uncharacterized proteins, even in well-studied organisms such as humans, seriously hampers a full understanding of the functioning of living cells. One such example is the human protein C12ORF4, which belongs to the DUF2362 family, present in many eukaryotic lineages and conserved in metazoans. The only functional information available on C12ORF4 (Chromosome 12 Open Reading Frame 4) is its involvement in mast cell degranulation and its being a genetic cause of autosomal intellectual disability. Bioinformatics analysis of the DUF2362 family provides strong evidence that it is a novel member of the Macro clan/superfamily. Sequence similarity analysis versus other representatives of the Macro superfamily of ADP-ribose-binding proteins and mapping sequence conservation on predicted three-dimensional structure provides hypotheses regarding the molecular function for members of the DUF2362 family. For example, the available functional data suggest a possible role for C12ORF4 in ADP-ribosylation signaling in asthma and related inflammatory diseases. This novel family appears to be a likely novel ADP-ribosylation “reader” and “eraser,” a previously unnoticed putative new player in cell signaling by this emerging post-translational modification.","Dudkiewicz, Małgorzata; Pawłowski, Krzysztof",PeerJ,https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.6863; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31106069/,498
592702,Policing in Pandemics: A Systematic Review and Best Practices for Police Response to COVID-19,2020-08-20,"PURPOSE: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, changes to chemotherapy services were implemented as a means of managing imposed workload strains within health services and protecting patients from contracting COVID-19. Given the rapidly evolving nature of the pandemic many changes were rapidly adopted and were not substantiated by robust evidence. This study aimed to describe the changes adopted internationally to chemotherapy services, which may be used to guide future changes to treatment delivery. METHODS: A survey was developed to understand the impact of COVID-19 on the delivery of systemic anti-cancer therapies (SACT). It comprised 22 questions and examined the strategies implemented during the pandemic to prioritise and protect patients receiving SACT and the participants’ professional opinion of the strategies employed. The survey was available in English, Spanish and French and was distributed via professional bodies. RESULTS: 129 responses were obtained from healthcare professionals working across 17 different countries. 45% of institutions had to implement treatment prioritisation strategies and all hospitals implemented changes in the delivery of treatment, including: reduction in treatments (69%), using less immunosuppressive agents (50%), allowing treatment breaks (14%) and switching to oral therapies (45%). Virtual clinic visits were perceived by participants as the most effective strategy to protect patients. CONCLUSIONS: The pandemic has forced chemotherapy healthcare professionals to adopt new ways of working by reducing health interactions. Many areas of research are needed following this period, including understanding patients’ perceptions of risks to treatment, utilisation of oral treatments and the impact of treatment breaks on cancer outcomes.","Chow, Man-Chie; Chambers, Pinkie; Singleton, Georgina; Patel, Jignesh; Cooper, Silvie; Mythen, Charlotte; Bautista-González, Elysse; Chisnall, Georgia; Djellouli, Nehla; Thwaites, Benjamin; Wong, Ian CK; Vindrola-Padros, Cecilia",J Oncol Pharm Pract,https://doi.org/10.1177/10781552211015767; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33983080/,498

The pandemic is still growing in many areas. Among the core measures to prevent disease spread is the use of face masks. We observed 12,588 people in five Brazilian cities within the Baixada Santista metropolitan area. Even though this is densely populated region and heavily impacted by COVID-19 with a high risk population, only 45.1% of the observed population wore in face masks in a correct way, and another 15.5% simply did not use masks at all. The remainder used masks incorrectly, which is evidence of the worst scenario of people believing that they are protected when they are not. This is among the first studies, to the best of our knowledge, that measures real life compliance with face masks during this COVID-19 pandemic. It is our conclusion that it is paramount to first control the virus before allowing people back in the streets. We should not assume that people will wear masks properly. Equally important is to instruct and sensitize people on how to use face masks and why it is important.","Stanislau Affonso de Araujo, E.; Maria Bernardes Henriques Amaral, F.; Park, D.; Paola Ceraldi Cameira, A.; Augustinho Muniz da Cunha, M.; Gutierrez Karl, E.; Henderson, S.

Patients with this viral pathogen suffer from excess mortality. MERS-CoV can spread through bioaerosol transmission from animal or human sources. The appearance of an outbreak in South Korea sparked off a strong urge to design strategies for developing an effective vaccine since the emergence of MERS-CoV in 2012. Well unfortunately, this is an important fact in virus risk management. The studies showed that virus-like nanoparticles (VLPs) could be effective in its goal of stopping the symptoms of MERS-CoV infection. Besides, due to the genetic similarities in the DNA sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and the first identified severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) in China since 2002/2003, strategic approaches could be used to manage SARS-CoV 2. Gathering the vital piece of information obtained so far could lead to a breakthrough in the development of an effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, which is prioritized and focussed by the World Health Organization (WHO).

Although the mechanisms of cell destruction are the same as in immunotherapies targeting tumor cells, many factors are still unknown. Antibody titers, for example, often do not strictly correlate with clinical outcome. Previously, we found C-reactive protein (CRP) levels to be elevated in thrombocytopenic patients, correlating with thrombocyte counts, and bleeding severity. Functionally, CRP amplified antibody-mediated phagocytosis of thrombocytes by phagocytes. To investigate whether CRP is a general enhancer of IgG-mediated target cell destruction, we extensively studied the effect of CRP on in vitro IgG-Fc receptor (FcγR)-mediated cell destruction: through respiratory burst, phagocytosis, and cellular cytotoxicity by a variety of effector cells. We now demonstrate that CRP also enhances IgG-mediated effector functions toward opsonized erythrocytes, in particular by activated neutrophils. We performed a first-of-a-kind profiling of CRP binding to all human FcγRs and IgA-Fc receptor I (FcαRI) using a surface plasmon resonance array. CRP bound these receptors with relative affinities of FcγRIa = FcγRIIa/b = FcγRIIIa > FcγRIIIb = FcαRI. Furthermore, FcγR blocking (in particular FcγRIa) abrogated CRP's ability to amplify IgG-mediated neutrophil effector functions toward opsonized erythrocytes. Finally, we observed that CRP also amplified killing of breast-cancer tumor cell line SKBR3 by neutrophils through anti-Her2 (trastuzumab). Altogether, we provide for the first time evidence for the involvement of specific CRP-FcγR interactions in the exacerbation of in vitro IgG-mediated cellular destruction; a trait that should be further evaluated as potential therapeutic target e.g., for tumor eradication.","Temming, A.

The use of the pulmonary surfactant seems to be promising as an additional therapy for the treatment of ARDS. COVID-19 causes lung damage and ARDS, so beneficial effects of surfactant therapy in COVID-19-associated ARDS patients are conceivable, especially when applied early in the treatment strategy against pulmonary failure.

DESIGN: A systematic review and realist review were conducted. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus and PsycINFO were searched (systematic review). PubMed, pre-prints and grey literature were also searched (realist review). The databases were searched from inception until October 2020. STUDY SELECTION: There were no restrictions on the study design. OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: For the systematic review, toilet paper hoarding was the main outcome, and pathological use of toilet paper was the secondary outcome. For the realist review, the context-mechanisms-outcome (CMO) scheme included the COVID-19 pandemic (context), four proposed mechanisms, and one outcome (toilet paper hoarding). The four potential mechanisms were (1) gastrointestinal mechanisms of COVID-19 (e.g. diarrhoea), (2) social cognitive biases, (3) stress-related factors (mental illnesses, personality traits) and (4) cultural aspects (e.g. differences between countries). ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES: All studies of human populations were considered (including general population studies and clinical studies of patients suffering from mental health problems). RESULTS: The systematic review identified 14 studies (eight studies for the main outcome, six studies for the secondary outcome). Three surveys identified the role of the COVID-19 threat in toilet paper hoarding in the general population. One study pointed to an association between a personality trait (conscientiousness) and toilet paper buying and stockpiling as well as an additional significant indirect effect of emotionality through the perceived threat of COVID-19 on toilet paper buying and stockpiling. Six case reports of pathological use of toilet paper were also identified, although none of them were associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. The realist review suggested that of all the mechanisms, social cognitive biases and a bandwagon effect were potential contributors to toilet paper hoarding in the general population. The stressful situation (COVID-19 pandemic) and some personality traits (conscientiousness) were found to be associated with toilet paper hoarding. Cultural differences were also identified, with relatively substantial effects of toilet paper hoarding in several Asian regions (Australia, Japan, Taiwan and Singapore). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with a worldwide increase in toilet paper hoarding. Social media and social cognitive biases are major contributors and might explain some differences in toilet paper hoarding between countries. Other mental health-related factors, such as the stressful situation of the COVID-19 pandemic, fear of contagion, or particular personality traits (conscientiousness), are likely to be involved.

We aimed to assess whether there were any differences a) between students attending public or private schools in Turkey and b) between two countries having different approaches to pandemic and considerable socio-cultural and economic differences. Methods: We conducted a web-based questionnaire study in a cross-sectional design using Survey Monkey platform and sent out via social media to high school students from Turkey and Denmark. The survey collected socio-demographic data, several variables associated with pandemic and distance education and their effects on social life and psychological status. Additionally, emotional status was assessed using positive (PA) and negative affects (NA) schedule (PANAS). The survey ran from July 3 and August 31 2020. Results: We studied 565 (mean age: 16.5{+/-}1.0) Turkish and 92 (mean age:17.7{+/-}1.0) Danish students, of whom the majority were female adolescents (63% vs 76%). Students educated in public (47.6%) and private high schools (52.4%) were nearly similar in number in Turkish group, whereas in the Danish sample almost all students were from public school (98.9%). Turkish students were significantly more likely to be compliant with the pandemic related restrictions. Besides that, there were significant socio-economic disparities between Turkish and Danish students and also within Turkey between public and private school students. Turkish online education system was significantly less adequate and satisfactory compared to the Danish system. These were even worse for those who were attending public schools in Turkey. Regardless of the socio-economic differences, the majority of the students in both countries has been negatively affected by the pandemic and related restrictions and had a negative opinion about distance education. This was also true for the PANAS scores. The total scores of PANAS were similar between Turkish and Danish students (PA: 27.0{+/-} 7.6 versus 25.8{+/-} 5.6; NA: 24.8{+/-}7.5 versus 24.5{+/-}7.3) and also within Turkey between public and private school students (PA: 26.8{+/-}7.5 versus 27.1{+/-} 7.6; NA: 24.7{+/-}7.2 versus 25.0{+/-}7.8). While female students were significantly more severely affected in the Turkish group, no such gender differences were observed in the Danish group. Additionally, considerable portion of the students in Turkey and Denmark expressed loneliness (55.2% vs 59.8%, p<0.706), boredom (71.2% vs 58.7%, p=0.019) and anxiety towards the future (61.4% vs 22.8%, p<0.001). Decreased physical activity, sleep problems, eating disorders and domestic abuse were other complaints. Conclusions: Adolescents from both countries have been severely affected by the pandemic and its related restrictions and expressed negative views about distance education. Turkish online education system seemed to be less satisfactory when compared to Danish system and within Turkey, public school students had significantly more disadvantages compared to those attending private schools. Despite the fact that there were several socio-economic inequalities among students, in general, there were no robust significant differences regarding psychological status and opinion about distance learning, indicating a global worsening of emotional status during pandemic.","Seyahi, L.

The purpose of this prospective study was to evaluate the effect of the initial COVID-19 response on adolescent mental health and ill-health as a natural experiment. METHODS: We used 3-year linked data from the COMPASS study, including 7,653 Canadian (Quebec, Ontario) adolescents from which 2,099 completed surveys in all three waves (pre-COVID-19 [2018 and 2019] and online [May–July 2020], 2–3 months into the pandemic). A structural equation modeling approach to fixed effects and a difference-in-differences design were used to estimate pre-COVID-19–to–early lockdown change in mental health (psychosocial well-being [flourishing—reverse scored]) and ill-health (depression and anxiety symptoms), compared with 2018-to-2019 change. Models were adjusted for self-selection, age of entry into the cohort, and sociodemographics. RESULTS: Depression, anxiety, and reverse-flourishing scores increased across all waves; however, the mental health changes from the pre-COVID-19 wave (2019) to 2020 were not greater relative to the changes seen across the 2018-to-2019 waves. CONCLUSIONS: Our results do not support a detrimental effect of the initial stages of the COVID-19 lockdown measures on adolescent mental health. The deterioration in mental health in the early COVID-19 response was less than the decline found over a prepandemic period. Further prospective research is needed to explore the impact of the prolonged pandemic and related measures on adolescents and inequitable effects in population subgroups.","Bélanger, Richard E.; Patte, Karen A.; Leatherdale, Scott T.; Gansaonré, Rabi Joël; Haddad, Slim",J Adolesc Health,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1054139X21003967?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2021.07.039; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1054139X21003967; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34565667/,498

Several studies have shown symptoms of depression, anxiety, and sleep disorders in healthcare workers during this pandemic. However, not many studies have examined the resilience of healthcare workers during this pandemic. Resilience is a person’s ability to rise and adapt when times are difficult and is considered to have a protective effect on mental problems. PURPOSE: This study aims to determine the correlation between resilience and anxiety in healthcare workers during COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This research was a cross-sectional study with observational analytic methods. The respondents were healthcare workers at Dr. Soetomo Hospital as the COVID-19 referral hospital in Surabaya, East Java, Indonesia. Data were collected from 10 to 16 June 2020 by distributing online questionnaires through the Google form application. There were three questionnaires used: demographic data, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) questionnaire, and the Connor–Davidson Resilience Scale (CR-RISC) questionnaire. RESULTS: The 227 respondents had filled out the questionnaire online with 33% had high state anxiety and 26.9% had high trait anxiety. The mean score of the respondents’ resilience was 69 ± 15.823. The Spearman correlation test showed a significant relationship between anxiety and resilience (p <0.05), both S-Anxiety and T-Anxiety. CONCLUSION: A significant correlation was found between the level of resilience and anxiety experienced by healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Five critical competency areas can be identified in relation to public health emergencies: (1) flexibility, adaptation, motivation, communication, (2) research, analytical sensitivity, ethics, diversity, (3) epidemiology, (4) preparedness and (5) employability. However, this may not be enough. New models of public health leadership and changes in the health workforce are needed, which transform the silos of professions and policy. Such transformations would include learning, working, leading and governing differently and must stretch far beyond the public health workforce. To achieve transformative capacity, critical public health competences must be considered for all healthcare workers on all levels of policymaking, thus becoming the ‘heart’ of health workforce resilience and pandemic preparedness.","Czabanowska, Katarzyna; Kuhlmann, Ellen",Int J Health Plann Manage,https://doi.org/10.1002/hpm.3131; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33598987/,498

Limited information exists on the virology of ARI in LTCFs, where virological testing is reactive. We report on findings of a surveillance feasibility substudy from a larger prospective trial of introducing rapid influenza diagnostic testing (RIDT) at 10 Wisconsin LTCFs. Any resident with symptoms consistent with ARI had a nasal swab specimen collected for RIDT by staff. Following RIDT, the residual swab was placed into viral transport medium and tested for influenza using Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, and for 20 pathogens using a multiplex polymerase chain reaction respiratory pathogen panel. Numbers of viruses in each of 7 categories (influenza A, influenza B, coronaviruses, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus, and rhinovirus/enterovirus) across the 3 years were compared using χ(2). Totals of 160, 215, and 122 specimens were collected during 2016‒2017, 2017‒2018, and 2018‒2019, respectively. Respiratory pathogen panel identified viruses in 54.8% of tested specimens. Influenza A (19.2%), influenza B (12.6%), respiratory syncytial virus (15.9%), and human metapneumovirus (20.9%) accounted for 69% of all detections, whereas coronaviruses (17.2%), rhinovirus/enterovirus (10.5%) and parainfluenza (3.8%) were less common. The distribution of viruses varied significantly across the 3 years (χ(2) = 71.663; df = 12; P < .001). Surveillance in LTCFs using nasal swabs collected for RIDT is highly feasible and yields high virus identification rates.

At the host level, COVID-19, caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), affects the respiratory system, with the clinical symptoms ranging from mild to severe or critical illness that often requires hospitalization and oxygen support. There is no specific therapy for COVID-19, as is the case for any common viral disease except drugs to reduce the viral load and alleviate the inflammatory symptoms. Tuberculosis (TB), an infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), also primarily affects the lungs and has clinical signs similar to pulmonary SARS-CoV-2 infection. Active TB is a leading killer among infectious diseases and adds to the burden of the COVID-19 pandemic worldwide. In immunocompetent individuals, primary Mtb infection can also lead to a non-progressive, asymptomatic latency. However, latent Mtb infection (LTBI) can reactivate symptomatic TB disease upon host immune-suppressing conditions. Importantly, the diagnosis and treatment of TB are hampered and admixed with COVID-19 control measures. The US-Center for Disease Control (US-CDC) recommends using antiviral drugs, Remdesivir or corticosteroid (CST), such as dexamethasone either alone or in-combination with specific recommendations for COVID-19 patients requiring hospitalization or oxygen support. However, CSTs can cause immunosuppression, besides their anti-inflammatory properties. The altered host immunity during COVID-19, combined with CST therapy, poses a significant risk for new secondary infections and/or reactivation of existing quiescent infections, such as LTBI. This review highlights CST therapy recommendations for COVID-19, various types and mechanisms of action of CSTs, the deadly combination of two respiratory infectious diseases COVID-19 and TB. It also discusses the importance of screening for LTBI to prevent TB reactivation during corticosteroid therapy for COVID-19.","Gopalaswamy, Radha; Subbian, Selvakumar",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33917321/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22073773,498

Many elective treatments were postponed, but newly diagnosed AML is a life-threatening disease that needs prompt therapy. With acute shortage of infra-structure as intensive care unit beds, blood supply, medication, healthcare personnel, an optimal therapy must balance anti-neoplastic efficacy and the chance of treatment-related mortality. The induction chemotherapy of pediatric patients with AML living in low- and middle-income countries has been thoroughly discussed because early mortality remains 10%-20%, much higher than in developed counties. Mild treatment schemas have been used in Japan, China and Latin America with impressive results, comparable to other intensive induction regimens. Our objective is to describe the results of this mild induction regimen used in Brazil to treat children simultaneously diagnosed with AML and Covid-19 infections. Methods: This is a retrospective multicentric trial including Brazilian children diagnosed with AML, also found to have a positive nasal and oropharyngeal PCR for SARS-Cov-2 and uniformly treated with mild induction protocol (“MAG”) that included Mitoxantrone at 5 mg/m2, by i.v. infusion over 4 to 6 hours once a day on days 1, 3, and 5 (three doses in total), Cytarabine at 10 mg/m2, subcutaneous (s.c.), q 12 h for 10 days (20 doses in total) and G-CSF 5 μg/kg, s.c., once a day for 10 days (10 doses in total) [Bansal D, et al. Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2019 Nov 27:e28087]. Results: From March 15 to July 1, 2020, nine children from four different institutions were diagnosed with AML (Table 1). Their median age was 9 years (range, 5 to 18), 6 female gender, all but one diagnosed with Covid-19 by nasal PCR; one had typical chest CT and positive IgM. The institutions had previously agreed on following the same induction when treating AML children infected by the SARS-Cov-2. Five of the nine had severe illness, three of them needed mechanical ventilation and one did not need supplementary oxygen despite radiologically diagnosed pneumonia. Two children had mild symptoms and two were completely asymptomatic. All children tolerated MAG chemotherapy. Neutropenia lasted for a median of 29 days (17-33) and none of them had neither thrombotic complications nor acute renal failure. All children recovered from the Covid-19 infection and 8 of 9 already evaluable children achieved complete remission of the leukemia with MRD 0-1% after the two planned cycles. All patients are alive, on therapy.

All evaluable patients achieved remission and are currently proceeding therapy. The high prevalence of Covid-19 in our country may have to be taken into account in all oncological treatment strategies. With a shorter duration of neutropenia, the absence of mucositis or invasive fungal infections, MAG may be implemented in low- and middle-income countries as an optimal strategy to overcome induction mortality and improve outcome of children and adolescents with AML.

Finding human host factors that are essential for SARS-CoV-2 infection could facilitate the formulation of treatment strategies. Using a human kidney cell line—HK-2—that is highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, we performed a genome-wide RNAi screen and identified virus dependency factors (VDFs), which play regulatory roles in biological pathways linked to clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We found a role for a secretory form of SARS-CoV-2 receptor, soluble angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (sACE2), in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further investigation revealed that SARS-CoV-2 exploits receptor-mediated endocytosis through interaction between its spike with sACE2 or sACE2-vasopressin via AT1 or AVPR1B, respectively. Our identification of VDFs and the regulatory effect of sACE2 on SARS-CoV-2 infection shed insight into pathogenesis and cell entry mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 as well as potential treatment strategies for COVID-19.","Yeung, Man Lung; Lee Teng, Jade Lee; Jia, Lilong; Zhang, Chaoyu; Huang, Chengxi; Cai, Jian-Piao; Zhou, Runhong; Chan, Kwok-Hung; Zhao, Hanjun; Zhu, Lin; Siu, Kam-Leung; Fung, Sin-Yee; Yung, Susan; Chan, Tak Mao; Kai-Wang To, Kelvin; Fuk-Woo Chan, Jasper; Cai, Zongwei; Pui Lau, Susanna Kar; Chen, Zhiwei; Jin, Dong-Yan; Yat Woo, Patrick Chiu; Yuen, Kwok-Yung",Cell,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33713620/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2021.02.053; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S009286742100283X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009286742100283X?v=s5,498

The pandemic has disrupted acute neurology services and routine patient care and has impacted the clinical course in patients with chronic neurological disease. COVID‐19 appears to have exposed inequalities of societies and healthcare systems and had a disproportionate impact on already vulnerable communities. The next challenge will be to set up initiatives to stop disparities in all aspects related to COVID‐19. From the medical perspective, there is a need to consider inequalities in prevention, treatment and long‐term consequences. Some of the issues of direct relevance to neurologists are summarised.

605162,Autism Screening in Early Childhood: Discriminating Autism From Other Developmental Concerns,2020-12-10,"BACKGROUND: Human bocavirus (HBoV), a recently discovered virus, is prevalent among children with respiratory tract infection throughout the world. Co-infection was frequently found in HBoV-positive patients. Thus, whether HBoV is responsible for the respiratory disease is still arguable. OBJECTIVES: A comprehensive study was carried out to integrate clinical and virological prevalence in HBoV-positive outpatient children, and to determine genetic and serologic characteristics of HBoV in Shanghai, China. STUDY DESIGN: Nasal/throat swabs and sera were obtained over a 2-year period from 817 children with respiratory tract infection to examine the presence of HBoV and its co-infection. The seroepidemiology of HBoV was studied by ELISA and Western blot against the capsid protein VP2-based fragment. Persistence of HBoV was also analyzed in 12 pairs of return-visit cases. RESULTS: HBoV was identified in 96 samples (11.8%). The co-infection rate with other respiratory viruses was 51%. IgM was detected in 55.7% of HBoV RT-PCR-positive patients, and in 72.7% of those who had high viral genome load. In addition, persistent viral DNA positivity was detected in 10 of 12 HBoV-positive cases tested, an average of 14 days later, and one child was still HBoV-positive after 31 days. CONCLUSION: HBoV was found frequently in children with respiratory tract symptoms associated with other respiratory viruses, and persisted in the respiratory tract and in serum and urine. The presence of IgM was significantly more prevalent in viremic patients and those diagnosed with high load of HBoV DNA in nasal/throat swabs.","Wang, Kai; Wang, Wei; Yan, Huajie; Ren, Peijun; Zhang, Jing; Shen, Jun; Deubel, Vincent",J Clin Virol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2009.11.015; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653209005563; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20022295/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653209005563,498

A Study of Social Distancing During the Covid-19 Pandemic,2021-06-16,"The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in an abrupt change in routines and livelihoods all around the world. This public health crisis amplified a number of systemic inequalities that led to populations needing to grapple with universally difficult truths. Yet some individuals, firms, and countries displayed resilient and creative responses in coping with pressing demands on healthcare and basic sanity. Past work has suggested that engaging in creative acts can be an adaptive response to a changing environment. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to describe how entities at the personal, community, and national levels cultivated and expressed creativity in an effort to make meaning during COVID-19. By overlaying the Four C model of creativity on such responses, we aim to (a) to connect mini, little, Pro, and Big creative behaviors with our attempts to make meaning of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and (b) to suggest how engaging in creative expression can be used to guard against the adverse consequences of this outbreak. Acknowledging that this time has been and continues to be distressing and filled with uncertainty, we propose some ways of making sense of current events by applying original thinking across domains. Further, we propose how engaging in creativity can serve to buffer against the negative effects of living through the pandemic.","Kapoor, Hansika; Kaufman, James C.",Front Psychol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.595990; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33391115/,498

The same groups of mice had high levels of SCoV-specific neutralizing antibodies, while mice in the negative control groups, which were not immunized with chimeric VLPs, failed to manifest neutralizing antibodies, suggesting that SCoV-specific neutralizing antibodies are important for the suppression of viral replication within the lungs. Despite some differences in the cellular composition of inflammatory infiltrates, we did not observe any overt lung pathology in the chimeric-VLP-treated mice, when compared to the negative control mice.

The lipid composition of caveolae largely matches that of lipid rafts microdomains that are particularly enriched in cholesterol, sphingomyelin, glycosphingolipids, and saturated fatty acids. Unlike lipid rafts, whose existence remains quite elusive in living cells, caveolae can be clearly distinguished by electron microscope. Despite their similar composition and the sharing of some functions, lipid rafts appear more heterogeneous in terms of size and are more dynamic than caveolae. Following the discovery of caveolin-1, the first molecular marker as well as the unique scaffolding protein of caveolae, we have witnessed a remarkable increase in studies aimed at investigating the role of these organelles in cell functions and human disease. The goal of this review is to discuss the most recent studies related to the role of caveolae and caveolins in endothelial cells. We first recapitulate the major embryological processes leading to the formation of the vascular tree. We next discuss the contribution of caveolins and cavins to membrane biogenesis and cell response to extracellular stimuli. We also address how caveolae and caveolins control endothelial cell metabolism, a central mechanism involved in migration proliferation and angiogenesis.

610271,Ghana's rice value chain resilience in the context of COVID-19,2021-09-27,"Mathematical models are often regarded as recent innovations in the description and analysis of infectious disease outbreaks and epidemics, but simple mathematical expressions have been in use for projection of epidemic trajectories for more than a century. We recently introduced a single equation model (the incidence decay with exponential adjustment, or IDEA model) that can be used for short-term epidemiological forecasting. In the mid-19th century, Dr. William Farr made the observation that epidemic events rise and fall in a roughly symmetrical pattern that can be approximated by a bell-shaped curve. He noticed that this time-evolution behavior could be captured by a single mathematical formula (“Farr's law”) that could be used for epidemic forecasting. We show here that the IDEA model follows Farr's law, and show that for intuitive assumptions, Farr's Law can be derived from the IDEA model. Moreover, we show that both mathematical approaches, Farr's Law and the IDEA model, resemble solutions of a susceptible-infectious-removed (SIR) compartmental differential-equation model in an asymptotic limit, where the changes of disease transmission respond to control measures, and not only to the depletion of susceptible individuals. This suggests that the concept of the reproduction number [Formula: see text] was implicitly captured in Farr's (pre-microbial era) work, and also suggests that control of epidemics, whether via behavior change or intervention, is as integral to the natural history of epidemics as is the dynamics of disease transmission.","Santillana, Mauricio; Tuite, Ashleigh; Nasserie, Tahmina; Fine, Paul; Champredon, David; Chindelevitch, Leonid; Dushoff, Jonathan; Fisman, David",Infect Dis Model,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468042718300101; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.idm.2018.03.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30839910/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2468042718300101,498

Many urologists became integrated into multidisciplinary teams, dealing with this respiratory illness and its unknown management. It aims to summarize the epidemiological, clinical, diagnostical, and therapeutical characteristics of COVID-19, from a practical perspective, to ease COVID-19 management to non-physician staff. RECENT FINDINGS: We performed a narrative review of the literature regarding COVID-19, updated to May 8th, 2020, at PubMed and COVID resource platforms of the main scientific editorials. COVID-19, characterized by fever, myalgias, dyspnea, and dry cough, varies widely from asymptomatic infection to death. Arrhythmias and thrombotic events are prevalent. Lymphopenia and inflammatory reactant elevation on laboratory, as well as bilateral and peripheral ground-glass opacities or consolidations on X-Ray, are usually found in its assessment. Little is known about SARS-CoV-2 immunology. To date, no therapy has demonstrated efficacy in COVID-19. Of-level or compassionate-use therapies are prescribed in the context of clinical trials. We should become familiar with specific adverse events and pharmacological interactions. SUMMARY: The COVID-19 pandemic has paralyzed the urological activity, and its long-term consequences are unpredictable. Despite not being used to deal with respiratory diseases, the urologists become easily qualified to manage COVID-19 by following protocols and being integrated into multidisciplinary teams, helping to overcome the pandemic.","Sánchez-González, Álvaro; López-Fando Lavalle, Luis; Esteban-Fernández, Alberto; Ruiz, Mercedes; Hevia, Vital; Comeche, Belén; Sánchez Conde, Matilde; Álvarez, Sara; Lorca Álvaro, Javier; Fraile Poblador, Agustín; Hevia Palacios, Manuel; Domínguez Gutiérrez, Ana; Artiles Medina, Alberto; Sanz Mayayo, Enrique; Duque, Gemma; Gómez Dos Santos, Victoria; Moreno-Guillén, Santiago; Burgos Revilla, Javier",Curr Urol Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32870407/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11934-020-00995-y,498
611178,The COVID-19 response for vulnerable people in places affected by conflict and humanitarian crises,2020-05-04,"A hypercoagulable state has been described in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Others have reported a survival advantage with prophylactic anticoagulation (pAC) and therapeutic anticoagulation (tAC), but these retrospective analyses have important limitations such as confounding by indication. We studied the impact of tAC and pAC compared with no anticoagulation (AC) on time to death in COVID-19. We performed a cross-sectional analysis of 127 deceased COVID-19 patients and compared time to death in those who received tAC ( n = 67), pAC ( n = 47), and no AC ( n = 13). Median time to death was longer with higher doses of AC (11 days for tAC, 8 days for pAC, and 4 days for no AC, p < 0.001). In multivariate analysis, AC was associated with longer time to death, both at prophylactic (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.29; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.15 to 0.58; p < 0.001) and therapeutic doses (HR = 0.15; 95% CI: 0.07 to 0.32; p < 0.001) compared with no AC. Bleeding rates were similar among tAC and remaining patients (19 vs. 18%; p = 0.877). In deceased COVID-19 patients, AC was associated with a delay in death in a dose-dependent manner. Randomized trials are required to prospectively investigate the benefit and safety of higher doses of AC in this population.","Ionescu, Filip; Grasso-Knight, Giovi; Castillo, Edward; Naeem, Ehsun; Petrescu, Ioana; Imam, Zaid; Patel, Vishal K.; Narasimhan, Mangala; Nair, Girish B.",TH Open,https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0040-1716721; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32995704/,498

An Introduction,2021-06-25,"Risk factors for increased risk of death from COVID-19 have been identified, but less is known on characteristics that make communities resilient or vulnerable to the mortality impacts of the pandemic. We applied a two-stage Bayesian spatial model to quantify inequalities in excess mortality in people aged 40 years and older at the community level during the first wave of the pandemic in England, March-May 2020 compared with 2015–2019. Here we show that communities with an increased risk of excess mortality had a high density of care homes, and/or high proportion of residents on income support, living in overcrowded homes and/or with a non-white ethnicity. We found no association between population density or air pollution and excess mortality. Effective and timely public health and healthcare measures that target the communities at greatest risk are urgently needed to avoid further widening of inequalities in mortality patterns as the pandemic progresses.","Davies, Bethan; Parkes, Brandon L.; Bennett, James; Fecht, Daniela; Blangiardo, Marta; Ezzati, Majid; Elliott, Paul",Nat Commun,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34145260/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-23935-x,498

We used a coalescent framework to combine retrospective molecular clock inference with forward epidemiological simulations to determine how long SARS-CoV-2 could have circulated before the time of the most recent common ancestor of all sequenced SARS-CoV-2 genomes. Our results define the period between mid-October and mid-November 2019 as the plausible interval when the first case of SARS-CoV-2 emerged in Hubei province, China. By characterizing the likely dynamics of the virus before it was discovered, we show that more than two-thirds of SARS-CoV-2like zoonotic events would be self-limited, dying out without igniting a pandemic. Our findings highlight the shortcomings of zoonosis surveillance approaches for detecting highly contagious pathogens with moderate mortality rates.","Pekar, Jonathan; Worobey, Michael; Moshiri, Niema; Scheffler, Konrad; Wertheim, Joel O.",Science,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33737402/; https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abf8003,498

It is a global health priority to identify patients at risk of fatal outcomes. 1955 patients admitted to HM-Hospitales from 1 March to 10 June 2020 due to COVID-19, were were divided into two groups, 1310 belonged to the training cohort and 645 to validation cohort. Four different models were generated to predict in-hospital mortality. Following variables were included: age, sex, oxygen saturation, level of C-reactive-protein, neutrophil-to-platelet-ratio (NPR), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte-ratio (NLR) and the rate of changes of both hemogram ratios (VNLR and VNPR) during the first week after admission. The accuracy of the models in predicting in-hospital mortality were evaluated using the area under the receiver-operator-characteristic curve (AUC). AUC for models including NLR and NPR performed similarly in both cohorts: NLR 0.873 (95% CI: 0.849–0.898), NPR 0.875 (95% CI: 0.851–0.899) in training cohort and NLR 0.856 (95% CI: 0.818–0.895), NPR 0.863 (95% CI: 0.826–0.901) in validation cohort. AUC was 0.885 (95% CI: 0.885–0.919) for VNLR and 0.891 (95% CI: 0.861–0.922) for VNPR in the validation cohort. According to our results, models are useful in predicting in-hospital mortality risk due to COVID-19. The RIM Score proposed is a simple, widely available tool that can help identify patients at risk of fatal outcomes.","López-Escobar, Alejandro; Madurga, Rodrigo; Castellano, José María; Velázquez, Sara; Suárez del Villar, Rafael; Menéndez, Justo; Peixoto, Alejandro; Jimeno, Sara; Ventura, Paula Sol; Ruiz de Aguiar, Santiago",Diagnostics (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/diagnostics11040596; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33810534/,498

There is strong evidence to suggest that AMPs, in combination with cellular and physical factors, play an important role in preventing infection. Although AMPs act directly on microorganisms, there is increasing recognition that they also exert their protective effect via immunomodulatory mechanisms, especially in noninflammatory conditions. Further studies that manipulate physiologically relevant concentrations of AMPs are required to shed light on the role they play in reducing susceptibility to infection. Evidence shows that in various form prolonged and/or exhaustive exercise is a potent modulator of the immune system, which can either sharpen or blunt the immune response to pathogens. The intensity and duration of exercise can be readily controlled in experimental settings to manipulate the degree of physical stress. This would allow for an investigation into a potential dose–response effect between exercise and AMPs. In addition, the use of controlled exercise could provide an experimental model by which to examine whether changes in the concentration of AMPs alters susceptibility to illness.","West, Nicholas P.; Pyne, David B.; Renshaw, Gillian; Cripps, Allan W.",FEMS Immunol Med Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17132140/,498
615280,Undersampling in action and at scale: application to the COVID-19 pandemic,2020-06-02,"BACKGROUND: Reverse transcription of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (+)RNA genome and subgenomic RNAs (sgRNAs) and subsequent quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is the reliable diagnostic gold standard for COVID-19 diagnosis and the identification of potential spreaders. Apart from clinical relevance and containment, for specific questions, it might be of interest to (re)investigate cases with low SARS-CoV-2 load, where RT-qPCR alone can deliver conflicting results, even though these cases might neither be clinically relevant nor significant for containment measures, because they might probably not be infectious. In order to expand the diagnostic bandwidth for non-routine questions, particularly for the reliable discrimination between negative and false-negative specimens associated with high C(T) values, we combined the RT-qPCR workflow with subsequent pyrosequencing of a S-gene amplicon. This expansion can help to confirm SARS-CoV-2 infections without the demand of confirmative antibody testing, which requires to summon patients again for blood sampling few to several weeks after symptom onset. RESULTS: We successfully established a combined RT-qPCR and S-gene pyrosequencing method which can be optionally exploited after routine diagnostics. This allows a reliable interpretation of RT-qPCR results in specimens with relatively low viral loads and close to the detection limits of qPCR. After laboratory implementation, we tested the combined method in a large pediatric cohort from two German medical centers (n=769). Pyrosequencing after RT-qPCR enabled us to uncover 5 previously unrecognized cases of pediatric SARS-CoV-2-associated diseases, mainly exhibiting mild and heterogeneous presentation—apart from a single case of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) associated with SARS-CoV-2, who was hospitalized in the course of the study. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed protocol allows a specific and sensitive confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infections close to the detection limits of RT-qPCR. The tested biotinylated primers do not negatively affect the RT-qPCR pipeline and thus can be optionally applied to enable deeper inspection of RT-qPCR results by subsequent pyrosequencing. Moreover, due to the incremental transmission of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, we note that the used strategy can uncover (Spike) P681H allowing the pre-selection of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 candidate specimens for deep sequencing.

615665,Still a Long Way to Go. Editorial for the Special Issue “Understanding Autism Spectrum Disorder”,2021-08-13,"BACKGROUND: Prior research documents that India has the greatest number of girls married as minors of any nation in the world, increasing social and health risks for both these young wives and their children. While the prevalence of child marriage has declined in the nation, more work is needed to accelerate this decline and the negative consequences of the practice. Expanded targets for intervention require greater identification of these targets. Machine learning can offer insight into identification of novel factors associated with child marriage that can serve as targets for intervention. METHODS: We applied machine learning methods to retrospective cross-sectional survey data from India on demographics and health, the nationally-representative National Family Health Survey, conducted in 2015–16. We analyzed data using a traditional regression model, with child marriage as the dependent variable, and 4000+ variables from the survey as the independent variables. We also used three commonly used machine learning algorithms– Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (lasso) or L-1 regularized logistic regression models; L2 regularized logistic regression or ridge models; and neural network models. Finally, we developed and applied a novel and rigorous approach involving expert qualitative review and coding of variables generated from an iterative series of regularized models to assess thematically key variable groupings associated with child marriage. FINDINGS: Analyses revealed that regularized logistic and neural network applications demonstrated better accuracy and lower error rates than traditional logistic regression, with a greater number of features and variables generated. Regularized models highlight higher fertility and contraception, longer duration of marriage, geographic, and socioeconomic vulnerabilities as key correlates; findings shown in prior research. However, our novel method involving expert qualitative coding of variables generated from iterative regularized models and resultant thematic generation offered clarity on variables not focused upon in prior research, specifically non-utilization of health system benefits related to nutrition for mothers and infants. INTERPRETATION: Machine learning appears to be a valid means of identifying key correlates of child marriage in India and, via our innovative iterative thematic approach, can be useful to identify novel variables associated with this outcome. Findings related to low nutritional service uptake also demonstrate the need for more focus on public health outreach for nutritional programs tailored to this population.","Raj, Anita; Dehingia, Nabamallika; Singh, Abhishek; McDougal, Lotus; McAuley, Julian",SSM Popul Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33335970/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssmph.2020.100687,498

This study aimed to examine the impact of health- and social-inequality–related factors on well-being in order to further distinguish each of their effects during the pandemic. Methods: A nationally-representative sample of 5077 UK respondents aged 18 years or older was recruited through an online survey panel during the COVID-19 pandemic. Their subjective well-being was measured using the 11-point Cantril Ladder of Life Scale. The impact of inequality-related health and social factors (pre-existing medical conditions, household size and occupation), as well as COVID-19–related risk factors (symptoms, confirmed infections, and social distancing behaviours) on well-being were analysed using multiple linear regression models. The associations between the COVID-19–related risk factors and well-being according to the respondents’ household size and occupation were modelled in order to test the differences by their socioeconomic profile. Results: We identified inverted V-shaped associations between household size and subjective well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic. Compared to single-person households, respondents from households of two to four persons showed better well-being (β = 0.57; CI (0.44, 0.72)), whereas living in crowded households of five persons or more was associated with decreased well-being (β = −0.48; CI (−0.71, −0.25)). Furthermore, lower-skilled occupations (elementary occupations: β = −0.31; CI (−0.58, −0.03); logistics and transport services: β = −0.37; CI (−0.74, −0.01)) and chronic medical conditions (cardiometabolic or respiratory diseases: β = −0.25; CI (−0.41, −0.1); and mental health conditions: β = −1.12; CI (−1.28, −0.96)) were factors associated with reduced well-being during the pandemic. Interactions between a positive COVID-19 diagnosis, symptoms, and crowded households were identified (β = −0.95; CI (−1.76, −0.14) and β = −4.74; CI (−9.87, −1.61), respectively). Conclusions: In a national sample, the levels of general subjective well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdowns were disproportionately distributed across different groups within society. Preventive policies should explicitly focus on reaching lower socioeconomic groups; more emphasis should be placed on the coordination of multisectoral support in order to tackle existing health and social inequalities.","Chen, Daniel Tzu-Hsuan; Wang, Yi-Jen",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33498842/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18031014,498
617160,Health management via telemedicine: Learning from the COVID-19 experience,2021-08-30,"BACKGROUND: Premature beats (PBs) are a common finding in patients suffering from structural heart disease, but they can also be present in healthy individuals. Catheter ablation represents a suitable therapeutic approach. However, the exact localization of the origin can be challenging, especially in cases of low PB burden during the procedure. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop an automated mapping algorithm on the basis of the hypothesis that mathematical optimization would significantly accelerate the localization of earliest activation. METHODS: The algorithm is based on iterative regression analyses. When acquiring local activation times (LATs) within a 3-dimensional anatomic map of the corresponding heart chamber, this algorithm is able to identify that exact position where a next LAT measurement adds maximum information about the predicted site of origin. Furthermore, on the basis of the acquired LAT measurements, the algorithm is able to predict earliest activation with high accuracy. RESULTS: A systematic retrospective analysis of the mapping performance comparing the operator with simulated search processes by the algorithm within 17 electroanatomic maps of focal spreading arrhythmias revealed a highly significant reduction of necessary LAT measurements from 55 ± 8.8 to 10 ± 0.51 (n = 17; P < .0001). CONCLUSION: On the basis of mathematical optimization, we developed an algorithm that is able to reduce the number of LAT measurements necessary to locate the site of earliest activation. This algorithm might significantly accelerate the mapping procedure by guiding the operator to the optimal position for the next LAT measurement. Furthermore, the algorithm would be able to predict the site of origin with high accuracy early during the mapping procedure.","Weber, Tobias; Katus, Hugo A.; Sager, Sebastian; Scholz, Eberhard P.",Heart Rhythm,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.hrthm.2017.03.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28279745/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1547527117302941; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1547527117302941,498
617256,Students’ Perceptions on Dental Education in the Wake of the COVID‐19 Pandemic,2020-07-05,"IMPORTANCE: Several jurisdictions in the United States have secured hotels to temporarily house people experiencing homelessness who require isolation or quarantine for confirmed or suspected coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). To our knowledge, little is known about how these programs serve this vulnerable population outside the hospital setting. OBJECTIVE: To assess the safety of a hotel-based isolation and quarantine (I/Q) care system and its association with inpatient hospital capacity. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort study of a hotel-based I/Q care system for homeless and unstably housed individuals in San Francisco, California, was conducted from March 19 to May 31, 2020. Individuals unable to safely isolate or quarantine at home with mild to moderate COVID-19, persons under investigation, or close contacts were referred from hospitals, outpatient settings, and public health surveillance to 5 I/Q hotels. Of 1009 I/Q hotel guests, 346 were transferred from a large county public hospital serving patients experiencing homelessness. EXPOSURE: A physician-supervised team of nurses and health workers provided around-the-clock support, including symptom monitoring, wellness checks, meals, harm-reduction services, and medications for opioid use disorder. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Characteristics of I/Q hotel guests, program retention, county hospital readmissions, and mean length of stay. RESULTS: Overall, the 1009 I/Q hotel guests had a median age of 44 years (interquartile range, 33-55 years), 756 (75%) were men, 454 (45%) were Latinx, and 501 (50%) were persons experiencing sheltered (n = 295) or unsheltered (n = 206) homelessness. Overall, 463 (46%) received a diagnosis of COVID-19; 303 of 907 (33%) had comorbid medical disorders, 225 of 907 (25%) had comorbid mental health disorders, and 236 of 907 (26%) had comorbid substance use disorders. A total of 776 of 955 guests (81%) completed their I/Q hotel stay; factors most strongly associated with premature discontinuation were unsheltered homelessness (adjusted odds ratio, 4.5; 95% CI, 2.3-8.6; P < .001) and quarantine status (adjusted odds ratio, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.5-4.6; P = .001). In total, 346 of 549 patients (63%) were transferred from the county hospital; of 113 ineligible referrals, 48 patients (42%) had behavioral health needs exceeding I/Q hotel capabilities. Thirteen of the 346 patients transferred from the county hospital (4%) were readmitted for worsening COVID-19. Overall, direct transfers to I/Q hotels from emergency and outpatient departments were associated with averting many hospital admissions. There was a nonsignificant decrease in the mean hospital length of stay for inpatients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 from 5.5 to 2.7 days from March to May 2020 (P = .11). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: To support persons experiencing homelessness during the COVID-19 pandemic, San Francisco rapidly and safely scaled a hotel-based model of I/Q that was associated with reduced strain on inpatient capacity. Strategies to improve guest retention and address behavioral health needs not met in hotel settings are intervention priorities.","Fuchs, Jonathan D.; Carter, Henry Clay; Evans, Jennifer; Graham-Squire, Dave; Imbert, Elizabeth; Bloome, Jessica; Fann, Charles; Skotnes, Tobi; Sears, Jonathan; Pfeifer-Rosenblum, Rebecca; Moughamian, Alice; Eveland, Joanna; Reed, Amber; Borne, Deborah; Lee, Michele; Rosenthal, Molly; Jain, Vivek; Bobba, Naveena; Kushel, Margot; Kanzaria, Hemal K.",JAMA Netw Open,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.0490; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33651111/,498

To prevent the community spread of the virus, the Indian Government imposed a nationwide lockdown. Though initially successful to some extent in containing the disease spread, the extended lockdown eventually leads to a spiraling out effect resulting in the slowdown of the economy, which, in turn, lead to widespread consequences affecting the lives of millions of people, mostly those at the base of the social pyramid. We investigated the implications of few government policies taken during this pandemic and their impact on society, thereby suggesting short-term crisis management with long-term solutions. Here, we present a comprehensive account of Indian policy in dealing with the COVID-19 crisis, balancing both economic and public health. We also explored a future contingency plan for risk mitigation along with few recommendations.

Detection of FPV and CPV variants in apparently healthy cats and their persistence in white blood cells (WBC) and other tissues when neutralising antibodies are simultaneously present, suggest that parvovirus may persist long-term in the tissues of cats post-infection without causing clinical signs. The aim of this study was to screen a population of 54 cats from Sardinia (Italy) for the presence of both FPV and CPV DNA within buffy coat samples using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The DNA viral load, genetic diversity, phylogeny and antibody titres against parvoviruses were investigated in the positive cats. RESULTS: Carnivore protoparvovirus 1 DNA was detected in nine cats (16.7%). Viral DNA was reassembled to FPV in four cats and to CPV (CPV-2b and 2c) in four cats; one subject showed an unusually high genetic complexity with mixed infection involving FPV and CPV-2c. Antibodies against parvovirus were detected in all subjects which tested positive to DNA parvoviruses. CONCLUSIONS: The identification of FPV and CPV DNA in the WBC of asymptomatic cats, despite the presence of specific antibodies against parvoviruses, and the high genetic heterogeneity detected in one sample, confirmed the relevant epidemiological role of cats in parvovirus infection.","Balboni, Andrea; Bassi, Francesca; De Arcangeli, Stefano; Zobba, Rosanna; Dedola, Carla; Alberti, Alberto; Battilani, Mara",BMC Vet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29402272/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12917-018-1356-9,498

We develop two differential equations models to account for this period. The first is a model that incorporates infected persons in the exposed class, before transmission is possible. The second is a model that incorporates a time delay in infected persons, before transmission is possible. We apply both models to the COVID-19 epidemic in China. We estimate the epidemiological parameters in the models, such as the transmission rate and the basic reproductive number, using data of reported cases. We thus evaluate the role of the exposed or latency period in the dynamics of a COVID-19 epidemic.","Liu, Z.; Magal, P.; Seydi, Ousmane; Webb, Glenn",Infect Dis Model,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468042720300099?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32346664/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.idm.2020.03.003; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2468042720300099,498

RNA interference (RNAi)—a natural mechanism for specific degradation of target RNAs that is conserved from plants to invertebrates and vertebrates—can potentially be harnessed to yield therapies with extensive specificity, ease of design, and broad application.

METHODS: Ten nurses participated; physiologic effects, subjective symptoms, and compliance with wearing an N95 alone or with a surgical mask overlay were assessed. Longitudinal analysis based on multivariate linear regression models assessed changes in outcome variables (CO(2), O(2), heart rate, perceived comfort items, compliance measures, and others). Analyses compared changes over time, and compared wearing only an N95 to wearing an N95 with a surgical mask overlay. RESULTS: Most nurses (90%, n = 9) tolerated wearing respiratory protection for two 12-hour shifts. CO(2) levels increased significantly compared with baseline measures, especially when comparing an N95 with a surgical mask to only an N95, but changes were not clinically relevant. Perceived exertion; perceived shortness of air; and complaints of headache, lightheadedness, and difficulty communicating also increased over time. Almost one-quarter (22%) of respirator removals were due to reported discomfort. N95 adjustments increased over time, but other compliance measures did not vary by time. Compliance increased on day 2, except for adjustments, touching under the N95, and eye touches. CONCLUSION: Long-term use of respiratory protection did not result in any clinically relevant physiologic burden for health care personnel, although many subjective symptoms were reported. N95 compliance was fairly high.","Rebmann, Terri; Carrico, Ruth; Wang, Jing",Am J Infect Control,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196655313005920; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23768438/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2013.02.017; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196655313005920,498

Many cells that express multiple connexins produce heteromeric channels containing at least two connexins, which provides a means to fine tune gap junctional communication. Formation of channels by multiple connexins is controlled at two levels: by inherent structural compatibilities that enable connexins to hetero-oligomerize and by cellular mechanisms that restrict the formation of heteromers by otherwise compatible connexins. Here, I discuss roles for secretory compartments beyond the endoplasmic reticulum in connexin oligomerization and evidence that suggests that membrane microdomains help regulate connexin trafficking and assembly.","Koval, Michael",Trends Cell Biol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0962892406000262; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0962892406000262; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16490353/,498

Truncated peptides C6E (residues 125–139), C9B (residues 205–216), and C11E (residues 260–272) were shown to be involved directly to the T cell determinants of C6, C9, and C11, respectively. Genetic restriction of these T cell clones was analyzed by using human cell lines with various HLA-DR phenotypes as targets and/or antigen-presenting cells in cytotoxicity assay and/or proliferation assays. The results indicated that the recognition of peptide C6 by T cell clones (R11 and R18) was associated with DRw9 molecule, while the HLA restriction element of the responses of other T cell clones (A2 and A11, A10, and A12) that reacted with peptide C9 or C11 was DR4 molecule.

METHODS: A web‐based questionnaire was e‐mailed to all departments of neurology. We requested a report of cases of CVT occurring within 1 month of a COVID‐19 vaccination. Other cerebral events could also be reported. Incidence rates of CVT were calculated by using official statistics of 9 German states. RESULTS: A total of 45 CVT cases were reported. In addition, 9 primary ischemic strokes, 4 primary intracerebral hemorrhages, and 4 other neurological events were recorded. Of the CVT patients, 35 (77.8%) were female, and 36 (80.0%) were younger than 60 years. Fifty‐three events were observed after vaccination with ChAdOx1 (85.5%), 9 after BNT162b2 (14.5%) vaccination, and none after mRNA‐1273 vaccination. After 7,126,434 first vaccine doses, the incidence rate of CVT within 1 month from first dose administration was 0.55 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.38–0.78) per 100,000 person‐months (which corresponds to a risk of CVT within the first 31 days of 0.55 per 100,000 individuals) for all vaccines and 1.52 (95% CI = 1.00–2.21) for ChAdOx1 (after 2,320,535 ChAdOx1 first doses). The adjusted incidence rate ratio was 9.68 (95% CI = 3.46–34.98) for ChAdOx1 compared to mRNA‐based vaccines and 3.14 (95% CI = 1.22–10.65) for females compared to non‐females. In 26 of 45 patients with CVT (57.8%), VITT was graded highly probable. INTERPRETATION: Given an incidence of 0.02 to 0.15 per 100,000 person‐months for CVT in the general population, these findings point toward a higher risk for CVT after ChAdOx1 vaccination, especially for women.

A Medical Student Perspective,2021-03-01,"Background: Acute myocardial injury (AMJ), assessed by elevated levels of cardiac troponin, is associated with fatal outcome in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, the role of acute cardiovascular (CV) events defined by clinical manifestation rather than sole elevations of biomarkers is unclear in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate acute clinically manifest CV events in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Methods: From 1 March 2020 to 5 January 2021, we conducted a multicenter, prospective, epidemiological cohort study at six hospitals from Hamburg, Germany (a portion of the state-wide 45-center CORONA Germany cohort study) enrolling all hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Primary endpoint was occurrence of a clinically manifest CV-event. Results: In total, 132 CV-events occurred in 92 of 414 (22.2%) patients in the Hamburg-cohort: cardiogenic shock in 10 (2.4%), cardiopulmonary resuscitation in 12 (2.9%), acute coronary syndrome in 11 (2.7%), de-novo arrhythmia in 31 (7.5%), acute heart-failure in 43 (10.3%), myocarditis in 2 (0.5%), pulmonary-embolism in 11 (2.7%), thrombosis in 9 (2.2%) and stroke in 3 (0.7%). In the Hamburg-cohort, mortality was 46% (42/92) for patients with a CV-event and 33% (27/83) for patients with only AMJ without CV-event (OR 1.7, CI: (0.94–3.2), p = 0.077). Mortality was higher in patients with CV-events (Odds ratio(OR): 4.8, 95%-confidence-interval(CI): [2.9–8]). Age (OR 1.1, CI: (0.66–1.86)), atrial fibrillation (AF) on baseline-ECG (OR 3.4, CI: (1.74–6.8)), systolic blood-pressure (OR 0.7, CI: (0.53–0.96)), potassium (OR 1.3, CI: (0.99–1.73)) and C-reactive-protein (1.4, CI (1.04–1.76)) were associated with CV-events. Conclusion: Hospitalized COVID-19 patients with clinical manifestation of acute cardiovascular events show an almost five-fold increased mortality. In this regard, the emergence of arrhythmias is a major determinant.","Gunawardene, Melanie A.; Gessler, Nele; Wohlmuth, Peter; Heitmann, Kathrin; Anders, Philipp; Jaquet, Kai; Herborn, Christoph U.; Arnold, Dirk; Bein, Berthold; Bergmann, Martin W.; Herrlinger, Klaus R.; Stang, Axel; Schreiber, Ruediger; Wesseler, Claas; Willems, Stephan",J Clin Med,https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10173982; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34501427/,498

The present work experimentally investigates a water jet impinging vertically onto a horizontal plate and the behaviours of the generated tiny droplets. Depending on whether the jet breaks into primary drops before the impingement, three regimes can be defined: non-splashing, jet-splashing and drop-splashing regimes. The splashing ratio, i.e., the portion of jet flow rate becoming splashing droplets, ranges from 1% – 70% in the drop-splashing regime, while it remains less than 2% in the jet-splashing regime. For the splashing droplets, their size and velocity distributions follow log-normal laws. Their diameters are mainly in the range from 0 to 0.3 of the impact jet or drop diameter with the median less than 0.1. Their velocities mostly range from 0 to 3.0 times of the impact velocity with the median around 1.0. The medians of both the dimensionless diameter and velocity of splashing droplets decrease with the impact Weber number.

The purpose of this systematic review is to evaluate and clarify the optimal role of telemedicine in pediatric urology, as well as the benefits, barriers, risks, and other important considerations that must be accounted for in its optimal adoption. Methods Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, this systematic review utilized Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) to search PubMed through April 29, 2021 as follows: (Humans [MeSH]) AND ((Child [MeSH]) OR (Infant [MeSH])) AND ((Remote Consultation [MAJR]) OR (Telemedicine [MAJR]) OR (Videoconferencing [MAJR]) OR (Health Services Accessibility [MAJR])) AND ((Urology [MAJR]) OR (Postoperative Care [MAJR]) OR (Urologic Surgical Procedures [MAJR])). 73 resulting articles, plus 21 from manual searches (e.g. papers too recent to have MeSH terms), were screened. 17 met inclusion criteria by discussing telemedicine in context of pediatric urology in a full manuscript. Non-complete manuscripts and papers not specifically considering pediatric urology, or in which telemedicine was not a major focus, were excluded. Results 17 papers met inclusion criteria. Varied approaches to the topic included surveys, controlled studies, retrospective studies, and descriptive opinion pieces. Quality of evidence varied, representing at least 1851 virtual encounters, 409 in-person encounters, and 68 clinician opinions. Four papers included a comparison or control group, and none utilized randomization. All 17 papers support expanded application of telemedicine in pediatric urology with varied evidence that telemedicine improves patient access to pediatric urologic care, satisfies both patient families and clinicians, is safe, provides equivalent outcomes, and is practicable.

This study aimed to determine the prevalence of anxiety and evaluate the potential effects of resilience, neuroticism, social support, and other sociodemographic factors on anxiety among HCWs from two African countries. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of 373 HCWs was conducted in Botswana and Nigeria, using an anxiety rating scale, neuroticism subscale of Big Five Inventory, Oslo social support scale, and Resilience Scale. Data collection was done between May 1 and September 30, 2020. RESULTS: The participants’ mean age (SD) was 38.42 (8.10) years, and 65.1% were females. Forty-nine (13.1%) of the HCWs reported clinical anxiety. In the final model of hierarchical multiple regression, neuroticism (B = 0.51, t = 10.59, p = p < 0.01), resilience (B = 0.34, t = − 7.11, p < 0.01), and social support (B = 0.079, t = − 2.11, p = 0.035) were associated with severe anxiety, after controlling for the significant sociodemographic factors.

In addition to being a source of energy, polyPs have cytoprotective and antiviral activities. Here, we investigated the antiviral activities of long-chain polyPs against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. In molecular docking analyses, polyPs interacted with several conserved amino acid residues in angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the host receptor that facilitates virus entry, and in viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). ELISA and limited proteolysis assays using nano– LC-MS/MS mapped polyP120 binding to ACE2, and site-directed mutagenesis confirmed interactions between ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 RdRp and identified the specific amino acid residues involved. PolyP120 enhanced the proteasomal degradation of both ACE2 and RdRp, thus impairing replication of the British B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2 variant. We thus tested polyPs for functional interactions with the virus in SARS-CoV-2–infected Vero E6 and Caco2 cells and in primary human nasal epithelial cells. Delivery of a nebulized form of polyP120 reduced the amounts of viral positive-sense genomic and subgenomic RNAs, of RNA transcripts encoding proinflammatory cytokines, and of viral structural proteins, thereby presenting SARS-CoV-2 infection in cells in vitro.","Ferrucci, Veronica; Kong, Dae-Young; Asadzadeh, Fatemeh; Marrone, Laura; Boccia, Angelo; Siciliano, Roberto; Criscuolo, Giuseppina; Anastasio, Camilla; Quarantelli, Fabrizio; Comegna, Marika; Pisano, Ida; Passariello, Margherita; Iacobucci, Ilaria; Monica, Rosa Della; Izzo, Barbara; Cerino, Pellegrino; Fusco, Giovanna; Viscardi, Maurizio; Brandi, Sergio; Pierri, Bianca Maria; Borriello, Giorgia; Tiberio, Claudia; Atripaldi, Luigi; Bianchi, Martina; Paolella, Giovanni; Capoluongo, Ettore; Castaldo, Giuseppe; Chiariotti, Lorenzo; Monti, Maria; De Lorenzo, Claudia; Yun, Kyong-Seop; Pascarella, Stefano; Cheong, Jae-Ho; Kim, Hong-Yeoul; Zollo, Massimo",Sci Signal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34230209/; https://doi.org/10.1126/scisignal.abe5040,498

To combat it, it is necessary to develop a better understanding of how the virus infects host cells. Infection normally starts with the attachment of the virus to cell-surface glycans like heparan sulfate (HS) and sialic acid-containing oligosaccharides. In this study, we examined and compared the binding of the subunits and spike (S) proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV to these glycans. Our results revealed that the S proteins and subunits can bind to HS in a sulfation-dependent manner, the length of HS is not a critical factor for the binding, and no binding with sialic acid residues was detected. Overall, this work suggests that HS binding may be a general mechanism for the attachment of these coronaviruses to host cells, and supports the potential importance of HS in infection and in the development of antiviral agents against these viruses.","Hao, Wei; Ma, Bo; Li, Ziheng; Wang, Xiaoyu; Gao, Xiaopan; Li, Yaohao; Qin, Bo; Shang, Shiying; Cui, Sheng; Tan, Zhongping",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.17.100537,498

OBJECTIVE: In this paper, a data analytics study on the diffusion of COVID-19 in Italy and the Lombardy Region is developed to define a predictive model tailored to forecast the evolution of the diffusion over time. METHODS: Starting with all available official data collected worldwide about the diffusion of COVID-19, we defined a predictive model at the beginning of March 2020 for the Italian country. RESULTS: This paper aims at showing how this predictive model was able to forecast the behavior of the COVID-19 diffusion and how it predicted the total number of positive cases in Italy over time. The predictive model forecasted, for the Italian country, the end of the COVID-19 first wave by the beginning of June.

Besides nucleic acid-based test systems and point-of-care (POCT) antigen (Ag) tests, quantitative, laboratory-based nucleocapsid Ag tests for SARS-CoV-2 have recently been launched. Here, we evaluated four commercial Ag tests on automated platforms and one POCT to detect SARS-CoV-2. We evaluated PCR-positive (n = 107) and PCR-negative (n = 303) respiratory swabs from asymptomatic and symptomatic patients at the end of the second pandemic wave in Germany (February–March 2021) as well as clinical isolates EU1 (B.1.117), variant of concern (VOC) Alpha (B.1.1.7) or Beta (B.1.351), which had been expanded in a biosafety level 3 laboratory. The specificities of automated SARS-CoV-2 Ag tests ranged between 97.0 and 99.7% (Lumipulse G SARS-CoV-2 Ag (Fujirebio): 97.03%, Elecsys SARS-CoV-2 Ag (Roche Diagnostics): 97.69%; LIAISON(®) SARS-CoV-2 Ag (Diasorin) and SARS-CoV-2 Ag ELISA (Euroimmun): 99.67%). In this study cohort of hospitalized patients, the clinical sensitivities of tests were low, ranging from 17.76 to 52.34%, and analytical sensitivities ranged from 420,000 to 25,000,000 Geq/ml. In comparison, the detection limit of the Roche Rapid Ag Test (RAT) was 9,300,000 Geq/ml, detecting 23.58% of respiratory samples. Receiver-operating-characteristics (ROCs) and Youden’s index analyses were performed to further characterize the assays’ overall performance and determine optimal assay cutoffs for sensitivity and specificity. VOCs carrying up to four amino acid mutations in nucleocapsid were detected by all five assays with characteristics comparable to non-VOCs. In summary, automated, quantitative SARS-CoV-2 Ag tests show variable performance and are not necessarily superior to a standard POCT. The efficacy of any alternative testing strategies to complement nucleic acid-based assays must be carefully evaluated by independent laboratories prior to widespread implementation.","Osterman, Andreas; Iglhaut, Maximilian; Lehner, Andreas; Späth, Patricia; Stern, Marcel; Autenrieth, Hanna; Muenchhoff, Maximilian; Graf, Alexander; Krebs, Stefan; Blum, Helmut; Baiker, Armin; Grzimek-Koschewa, Natascha; Protzer, Ulrike; Kaderali, Lars; Baldauf, Hanna-Mari; Keppler, Oliver T.",Med Microbiol Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34415422/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00430-021-00719-0,498

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel human coronavirus that has sparked a global pandemic of the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19). It is well known that the Corona Virus attacks mainly the respiratory system. Meanwhile, it has been established that coronavirus infection can extend beyond the respiratory system and unfortunately, can also affect our nervous system. Multiple neurological symptoms and signs had been documented during and post covid conditions. This virus gets access to the central nervous system (CNS) via the bloodstream leading to infect the endothelial lining cells. Also, it was reported that the virus can enter the peripheral nervous system via retrograde neuronal routes. The virus could be internalized in nerve synapses through endocytosis, transported retrogradely, and spread trans-synoptically to other brain regions.

METHODS: Medications under investigation as novel therapeutics to treat COVID‐19 were identified using the search term coronavirus therapeutics, COVID therapeutics, and SARS‐CoV‐2 therapeutics on ClinicalTrials.gov and the PubMed Database. A literature review was performed using the PubMed Database for each proposed COVID‐19 therapeutic to identify relevant articles. Search criteria included Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and key word search terms for ototoxicity, vestibulotoxicity, hearing disorders, and vertigo. RESULTS: Six proposed COVID‐19 therapeutics were identified as possessing ototoxic side effects including chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, lopinavir‐ritonavir, interferon, ribavirin, and ivermectin. CONCLUSIONS: Available evidence suggests that ototoxic effects may be improved or mitigated by stopping the offending agent. Recognition of hearing loss, tinnitus, or imbalance/vertigo is therefore crucial to facilitate early intervention and prevent long‐term damage.

As COVID-19 cases and deaths continue to increase in the USA, aging Black and Hispanic populations have emerged as especially at-risk for increased exposure to COVID-19 and susceptibility to severe health outcomes. The current review discusses the weathering hypothesis and the influence of social inequality on the identified health disparities. RECENT FINDINGS: Aging minoritized populations have endured structural and social inequality over the lifecourse. Consequently, these populations experience weathering, a process that results in physiological dysregulation due to stress associated with persistent disadvantage. Through weathering and continued inequity, aging minoritized populations have an increased risk of exposure and poor health outcomes from COVID-19. SUMMARY: Current literature and available data suggests that aging minoritized persons experience high rates of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. The current review hypothesizes and supports that observed disparities are the result of inequalities that especially affect Black and Hispanic populations over the lifecourse. Future efforts to address these disparities should emphasize research that supports governments in identifying at-risk groups, providing accessible COVID-19-related information to those groups, and implementing policy that addresses the structural and social inequities that perpetuate current COVID-19 disparities.","Walubita, Tubanji; Beccia, Ariel; Boama-Nyarko, Esther; Goulding, Melissa; Herbert, Carly; Kloppenburg, Jessica; Mabry, Guadalupe; Masters, Grace; McCullers, Asli; Forrester, Sarah",Curr Epidemiol Rep,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40471-021-00267-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33747713/,498

This is due to a high prevalence of comorbidities as well as therapeutic immunosuppression, which plays a complex role in view of the severe hyperinflammation contributing to morbidity and mortality. Many published case series including kidney transplant recipients reported a high proportion of hospitalized cases and mortality rates of 13–23%. The clinical symptoms and established risk factors for severe disease seem to be similar to those of the general population. The management of immunosuppressive treatment is a delicate question in the treatment of kidney transplant recipients with COVID-19. According to the current recommendations, a stepwise reduction should be carried out depending on the clinical course of the disease. Ongoing efforts to find an effective treatment for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) focus on repurposing known antiviral and anti-inflammatory substances.

Microbiota are increasingly recognised to play an important role in health. Infections also have a profound effect beyond health, especially on global and local economies. To maximise health improvements, the field of infectious disease epidemiology needs to derive learning from ecology and traditional epidemiology. New methodologies and tools are transforming understanding of these systems, from a better understanding of socioeconomic, environmental, and cultural drivers of infection, to improved methods to detect microorganisms, describe the immunome, and understand the role of human microbiota. However, exploiting the potential of novel methods to improve global health remains elusive. We argue that to exploit these advances a shift is required in the teaching of infectious disease epidemiology to ensure that students are well versed in a breadth of disciplines, while maintaining core epidemiological skills. We discuss the following key points using a series of teaching vignettes: (1) integrated training in classic and novel techniques is needed to develop future scientists and professionals who can work from the micro (interactions between pathogens, their cohabiting microbiota, and the host at a molecular and cellular level), with the meso (the affected communities), and to the macro (wider contextual drivers of disease); (2) teach students to use a team-science multidisciplinary approach to effectively integrate biological, clinical, epidemiological, and social tools into public health; and (3) develop the intellectual skills to critically engage with emerging technologies and resolve evolving ethical dilemmas.

Powered exoskeletons have been developed to allow repetitious overground gait training for individuals with lower limb weakness. The objective of this study was to determine the efficacy of exoskeleton-based physical therapy training during subacute rehabilitation for walking recovery in non-ambulatory patients with stroke. METHODS: An assessor-blinded randomized controlled trial was conducted at 3 inpatient rehabilitation hospitals. Patients with subacute stroke (< 3 months) who were unable to walk without substantial assistance (Functional Ambulation Category rating of 0 or 1) were randomly assigned to receive exoskeleton-based or standard physical therapy during rehabilitation, until discharge or a maximum of 8 weeks. The experimental protocol replaced 75% of standard physical therapy sessions with individualized exoskeleton-based sessions to increase standing and stepping repetition, with the possibility of weaning off the device. The primary outcome was walking ability, measured using the Functional Ambulation Category. Secondary outcomes were gait speed, distance walked on the 6-Minute Walk Test, days to achieve unassisted gait, lower extremity motor function (Fugl-Meyer Assessment), Berg Balance Scale, Patient Health Questionnaire, Montreal Cognitive Assessment, and 36-Item Short Form Survey, measured post-intervention and after 6 months. RESULTS: Thirty-six patients with stroke (mean 39 days post-stroke) were randomized (Exoskeleton = 19, Usual Care = 17). On intention-to-treat analysis, no significant between-group differences were found in the primary or secondary outcomes at post-intervention or after 6 months. Five participants randomized to the Exoskeleton group did not receive the protocol as planned and thus exploratory as-treated and per-protocol analyses were undertaken. The as-treated analysis found that those adhering to exoskeleton-based physical therapy regained independent walking earlier (p = 0.03) and had greater gait speed (p = 0.04) and 6MWT (p = 0.03) at 6 months; however, these differences were not significant in the per-protocol analysis. No serious adverse events were reported. CONCLUSIONS: This study found that exoskeleton-based physical therapy does not result in greater improvements in walking independence than standard care but can be safely administered at no detriment to patient outcomes.

637185,Articles That May Change Your Practice: Novel Strategies for COVID-19 Respiratory Failure,2020-07-21,"[Image: see text] Understanding how emerging influenza viruses recognize host cells is critical in evaluating their zoonotic potential, pathogenicity, and transmissibility between humans. The surface of the influenza virus is covered with hemagglutinin (HA) proteins that can form multiple interactions with sialic acid-terminated glycans on the host cell surface. This multivalent binding affects the selectivity of the virus in ways that cannot be predicted from the individual receptor–ligand interactions alone. Here, we show that the intrinsic structural and energetic differences between the interactions of avian- or human-type receptors with influenza HA translate from individual site affinity and orientation through receptor length and density on the surface into virus avidity and specificity. We introduce a method to measure virus avidity using receptor density gradients. We found that influenza viruses attached stably to a surface at receptor densities that correspond to a minimum number of approximately 8 HA–glycan interactions, but more interactions were required if the receptors were short and human-type. Thus, the avidity and specificity of influenza viruses for a host cell depend not on the sialic acid linkage alone but on a combination of linkage and the length and density of receptors on the cell surface. Our findings suggest that threshold receptor densities play a key role in virus tropism, which is a predicting factor for both their virulence and zoonotic potential.","Overeem, Nico J.; Hamming, P.

Several hundred species of viruses have been recovered from humans, who are the best-studied vertebrate hosts and new ones are still occasionally discovered. Somewhat fewer have been recovered from each of the common species of farm and companion animals and from the commonly used laboratory animals. To simplify the study of this vast number of infectious agents, these are sorted into groups that share certain common properties. The most important criteria for classification are the physical and chemical characteristics of the virion and the mode of replication of the virus.

We herein report the initial clinical experience with COVID-19 in SOT recipients in Qatar. Methods: All SOT recipients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 up to May 23, 2020 were included. Demographic and clinical data were extracted retrospectively from the hospital’s electronic health records. Categorical data are presented as frequency and percentages, while continuous variables are summarized as medians and ranges. Results: Twenty-four SOT recipients with COVID-19 were identified (kidney 16, liver 6, heart 1, and liver and kidney 1). Organ transplantation preceded COVID-19 by a median of 60 months (range 1.7–184). The median age was 57 years (range 24–72), and 9 (37.5%) transplant recipients were females. Five (21%) asymptomatic patients were diagnosed through proactive screening. For the rest, fever (15/19) and cough (13/19) were the most frequent presenting symptoms. Five (20.8%) patients required invasive mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit (ICU). Eleven (46%) patients developed acute kidney injury, including three in association with drug-drug interactions involving investigational COVID-19 therapies. Maintenance immunosuppressive therapy was modified in 18 (75%) patients, but systemic corticosteroids were not discontinued in any. After a median follow-up of 226 days (26–272), 20 (83.3%) patients had been discharged home, 2 (8.3%) were still hospitalized, 1 (4.2%) was still in the ICU, and 1 (4.2%) had died.

Growing evidence suggests a role for the neuroimmune system in this relationship. There is now substantial evidence that the immune system is critical for normal brain development and behaviour, and responds to environmental perturbations experienced early in life. Severe or chronic stress results in dysregulated neuroimmune function, concomitant with abnormal brain morphology and function. Positive experiences including environmental enrichment and exercise exert the opposite effect, promoting normal brain and immune function even in the face of early life stress. The neuroimmune system may therefore provide a viable target for prevention and treatment of psychiatric illness. This review will briefly summarise the neuroimmune system in brain development and function, and review the effects of stress and positive environmental experiences during development on neuroimmune function. There are also significant sex differences in how the neuroimmune system responds to environmental experiences early in life, which we will briefly review.","Brydges, Nichola M.; Reddaway, Jack",Brain Neurosci Adv,https://doi.org/10.1177/2398212820953706; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33015371/,498

Health care professionals have been at high occupational risk of getting disease and even dying of the disease, however; they have been the subject of very limited studies in terms of COVID-19. The objectives of this study are to examine the incidence and the impact of COVID-19 infection among HCWs in terms of recovery, productivity, quality of life (QOL) and post-COVID complications. Materials and Methods: This was a retrospective, questionnaire based study including demographic details, workplace characteristics, symptoms, source/ spread of infection, details of recovery and the consequences of COVID-19 comprising impaired productivity/ QOL, post-COVID-19 complications and others. The data were analyzed by using IBM SPSS software (Version 23, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Results and Conclusions: Out of a total of 1482 employees, 18.3% (271) were laboratory confirmed to have contracted novel contagion during the study period of 5 months. The median age at diagnosis was 29 (range, 21-62) years. Front-line workers and female workers were the most infected personnel with COVID-19. Flu-like symptoms were the most frequently experienced symptoms. The median time for recovery was 20 (range, 2-150) days. The relationship between pre-existing comorbidities and age was highly significant. The QOL and productivity were associated with pre-existing comorbidities, severity of the disease, time for recovery and post-COVID syndrome. More than a half (51.8%) of all HCWs had suffered from post-COVID complications. There was no fatality reported due to COVID-19. The post-COVID complications were related to pre-existing comorbidities, severity of disease, time for recovery and status of recovery. Further research to explore the consequences of COVID-19 is warranted. The general public needs to be aware of symptoms and management of the post-COVID syndrome.","Dogra, A.; PARKASH, A.; Mehta, A.; Bhatia, M.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.28.21252181; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.28.21252181v1?rss=1,498

We analyzed hospital data from the MERS-CoV outbreak in King Abdulaziz Medical Center, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, June–August 2015 using the susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) ward transmission model. The SEIR compartmental model considers several areas within the hospital where transmission occurred. We use a system of ordinary differential equations that incorporates the following units: emergency department (ED), out-patient clinic, intensive care unit, and hospital wards, where each area has its own carrying capacity and distinguishes the transmission by three individuals in the hospital: patients, health care workers (HCW), or mobile health care workers. The emergency department, as parameterized has a large influence over the epidemic size for both patients and health care workers. Trend of the basic reproduction number (R(0)), which reached a maximum of 1.39 at the peak of the epidemic and declined to 0.92 towards the end, shows that until added hospital controls are introduced, the outbreak would continue with sustained transmission between wards. Transmission rates where highest in the ED, and mobile HCWs were responsible for large part of the outbreak.","Oraby, Tamer; Tyshenko, Michael G.; Balkhy, Hanan H.; Tasnif, Yasar; Quiroz-Gaspar, Adriana; Mohamed, Zeinab; Araya, Ayesha; Elsaadany, Susie; Al-Mazroa, Eman; Alhelail, Mohammed A.; Arabi, Yaseen M.; Al-Zoughool, Mustafa",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17082936; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32340361/,498
642156,Deepening inequalities: What did COVID‐19 reveal about the gendered nature of academic work?,2021-05-18,"Immunosenescence is a multi-faceted phenomenon at the root of age-associated immune dysfunction. It can lead to an array of pathological conditions, including but not limited to a decreased capability to surveil and clear senescent cells (SnCs) and cancerous cells, an increased autoimmune responses leading to tissue damage, a reduced ability to tackle pathogens, and a decreased competence to illicit a robust response to vaccination. Cellular senescence is a phenomenon by which oncogene-activated, stressed or damaged cells undergo a stable cell cycle arrest. Failure to efficiently clear SnCs results in their accumulation in an organism as it ages. SnCs actively secrete a myriad of molecules, collectively called senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), which are factors that cause dysfunction in the neighboring tissue. Though both cellular senescence and immunosenescence have been studied extensively and implicated in various pathologies, their relationship has not been greatly explored. In the wake of an ongoing pandemic (COVID-19) that disproportionately affects the elderly, immunosenescence as a function of age has become a topic of great importance. The goal of this review is to explore the role of cellular senescence in age-associated lymphoid organ dysfunction and immunosenescence, and provide a framework to explore therapies to rejuvenate the aged immune system.","Budamagunta, Vivekananda; Foster, Thomas C.; Zhou, Daohong",Aging (Albany NY),https://doi.org/10.18632/aging.203405; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34382946/,498

643085,Malawi at the Crossroads: Does the Fear of Contracting COVID-19 Affect the Propensity to Vote?,2021-01-04,"Tropical countries are experiencing a substantial rise in type 2 diabetes, which is often undiagnosed or poorly controlled. Since diabetes is a risk factor for many infectious diseases, this increase probably adds to the large infectious disease burden in tropical countries. We reviewed the literature to investigate the interface between diabetes and infections in tropical countries, including the WHO-defined neglected tropical diseases. Although solid data are sparse, patients with diabetes living in tropical countries most likely face increased risks of common and health-care-associated infections, as well as infected foot ulcers, which often lead to amputation. There is strong evidence that diabetes increases the severity of some endemic infections such as tuberculosis, melioidosis, and dengue virus infection. Some HIV and antiparasitic drugs might induce diabetes, whereas helminth infections appear to afford some protection against future diabetes. But there are no or very scarce data for most tropical infections and for possible biological mechanisms underlying associations with diabetes. The rise in diabetes and other non-communicable diseases puts a heavy toll on health systems in tropical countries. On the other hand, complications common to both diabetes and some tropical infections might provide an opportunity for shared services—for example, for eye health (trachoma and onchocerciasis), ulcer care (leprosy), or renal support (schistosomiasis). More research about the interaction of diabetes and infections in tropical countries is needed, and the infectious disease burden in these countries is another reason to step up global efforts to improve prevention and care for diabetes.","van Crevel, Reinout; van de Vijver, Steven; Moore, David A J",Lancet Diabetes Endocrinol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S221385871630081X; https://doi.org/10.1016/s2213-8587(16)30081-x; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221385871630081X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27499355/,498
643624,Shift From a Traditional to a Distance Learning Environment during the COVID-19 Pandemic: University Students’ Engagement and Interactions,2021-06-08,"Since its first emergence from China in late 2019, the SARS-CoV-2 virus has spread globally despite unprecedented containment efforts, resulting in a catastrophic worldwide pandemic. Successful identification and isolation of infected individuals can drastically curtail virus spread and limit outbreaks. However, during the early stages of global transmission, point-of-care diagnostics were largely unavailable and continue to remain difficult to procure, greatly inhibiting public health efforts to mitigate spread. Furthermore, the most prevalent testing kits rely on reagent-and time-intensive protocols to detect viral RNA, preventing rapid and cost-effective diagnosis. Therefore the development of an extensive toolkit for point-of-care diagnostics that is expeditiously adaptable to new emerging pathogens is of critical public health importance. Recently, a number of novel CRISPR-based diagnostics have been developed to detect COVID-19. Herein, we outline the development of a CRISPR-based nucleic acid molecular diagnostic utilizing a Cas13d ribonuclease derived from Ruminococcus flavefaciens (CasRx) to detect SARS-CoV-2, an approach we term SENSR (Sensitive Enzymatic Nucleic-acid Sequence Reporter). We demonstrate SENSR robustly detects SARS-CoV-2 sequences in both synthetic and patient-derived samples by lateral flow and fluorescence, thus expanding the available point-of-care diagnostics to combat current and future pandemics.","Brogan, Daniel J; Chaverra-Rodriguez, Duverney; Lin, Calvin P; Smidler, Andrea L; Yang, Ting; Alcantara, Lenissa M.; Antoshechkin, Igor; Liu, Junru; Raban, Robyn R; Belda-Ferre, Pedro; Knight, Rob; Komives, Elizabeth A; Akbari, Omar S.",medRxiv,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.14.20212795v1?rss=1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33106816/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.14.20212795,498

The TOCIVID-19 trial evaluates efficacy and tolerability of tocilizumab in the treatment of patients with severe or critical COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: TOCIVID-19 is an academic multicenter, single-arm, open-label, phase 2 study. All the patients are being offered a single shot of 8 mg/kg of Tocilizumab (up to a maximum of 800 mg), with an eventual second administration at the discretion of the Investigator. A companion prospective cohort, added to corroborate internal validity, includes either patients not eligible for phase 2 or subjects eligible for phase 2 but exceeding the planned sample size. 14- and 30-days lethality rates are the two co-primary endpoints in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population. Secondary objectives are to evaluate mortality and clinical improvement in the modified-ITT population of subjects who received the drug. Details of the methodological and statistical approaches are reported here reflecting the amendments impelled by the continuously increasing knowledge on COVID-19 progression and challenges in data collection.

This article takes stock of this knowledge and contributes an affective dimension to the study of how institutional entrepreneurs achieve momentum and field-level impact. The article views institutional work as relational agency and conceptualises empathic engagement as a way for institutional entrepreneurs to relate affectively to other actors and induce cooperation. We demonstrate how empathic engagement by institutional entrepreneurs can nurture communities of practice that co-create change in institutional fields. Our argument hinges on the actors’ affective investment and advances the less developed non-cognitive dimension of institutional work. By integrating empathic engagement into institutional entrepreneurship, we demonstrate how institutional entrepreneurs nurture their ability to engage and cooperate with others to diffuse particular values through institutional work. This integration focuses on the way of knowing generated through empathic engagement: the ability to bring about a consensus by creating frames of reference and identities that others are enchanted by and subscribe to, as opposed to using coercive mechanisms.","Linneberg, Mai Skjøtt; Trenca, Mihaela; Noerreklit, Hanne",,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0263237320301225?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0263237320301225,498

This is the first German nationwide study to examine differences in the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infections according to SEP at the individual level. METHODS: The 'CORONA-MONITORING bundesweit' (RKI-SOEP) study is a seroepidemiological survey among a dynamic cohort of the German adult population (n=15 122; October 2020-February 2021). Dried blood samples were tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and oral-nasal swabs for viral RNA. SEP was measured by education and income. Robust logistic regression was used to examine adjusted associations of SARS-CoV-2 infections with SEP. RESULTS: 288 participants were seropositive, PCR positive or self-reported a previous laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The adjusted odds of SARS-CoV-2 infection were 1.87-fold (95% CI 1.06 to 3.29) higher among low-educated than highly educated adults. Evidence was weaker for income differences in infections (OR=1.65; 95% CI 0.89 to 3.05). Highly educated adults had lower odds of undetected infection. CONCLUSION: The results indicate an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in low-educated groups.

Such an impact on the U.S. LEB is unprecedented since the end of World War II. With additional deaths by the year end, the reduction in 2020 LEB induced by Covid-19 deaths will inexorably exceed one year. Factoring the expected continuation of secular gains against other causes of mortality, the U.S. LEB should still drop by more than a full year between 2019 and 2020. By comparison, the opioid-overdose crisis led to a decline in U.S. LEB averaging .1 year annually, from 78.9 years in 2014 to 78.6 years in 2017. At its peak, the HIV epidemic reduced the U.S. LEB by .3 year in a single year, from 75.8 years in 1992 to 75.5 years in 1993. As of now, the US LEB is expected to fall back to the level it first reached in 2010.

651066,Global coordination on cross-border travel and trade measures crucial to COVID-19 response,2020-05-14,"Background: Concerns have been raised about increased gambling problems during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) crisis, particularly in settings with high online gambling and risks of migration from land-based to riskier online-based gambling types. However, few non-self-reported data sources are hitherto available. The present study aimed to assess changes in the online- and land-based gambling markets in Sweden during the first months affected by the societal impact of COVID-19. Methods: Data were derived from national authority data describing monthly taxations of all licensed Swedish gambling operators, whose monthly tax payments are directly based on gambling revenue. Subdivisions of the gambling market were followed monthly from before COVID-19 onset in Sweden (mainly February 2020) through June 2020, when the sports market was restarted after COVID-19 lockdown. Results: Overall revenue-based taxations in the licensed gambling decreased markedly from February to March, but stabilized onto an overall modest decrease through June. Commercial online casino/betting, despite some decrease in March, was maintained on a relatively stable level through June. However, within this category, horse betting increased steeply during the pandemic but returned to prepandemic levels later during the period. The state-owned operator in betting/online casino decreased markedly throughout the pandemic. The remaining commercial operators, mainly in online casino and online betting, demonstrated no change during the pandemic and ended on a June level 14% above the February level. Throughout the pandemic, the smaller restaurant casinos decreased markedly, while major state-owned casinos also closed entirely. State-owned lotteries and electronic gambling machines decreased markedly but were rapidly normalized to prepandemic levels. Conclusions: Commercial online gambling operators' revenues remained stable throughout the pandemic, despite the dramatic lockdown in sports. Thus, chance-based online games may have remained a strong actor in the gambling market despite the COVID-19 crisis, in line with previous self-report data. A sudden increase in horse betting during the sports lockdown and its decrease when sports reopened confirm the picture of possible COVID-19-related migration between gambling types, indicating a volatility with potential impact on gambling-related public health.","Håkansson, Anders",Front Psychiatry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33391059/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.611939,498

This study investigates the influence of FPICP on the quality of diabetes care. METHODS: This population-based cohort study used Taiwan’s National Health Insurance Administration data on FPICP (fiscal year 2015–2016, with follow-up duration of one year). Participants included diabetic patients aged ≥30 in primary care clinics. We used conditional logistic regression modeling of patient characteristics and annual diabetes examinations and compared FPICP participants with non-participating candidates. Main outcome measures included completion of annual diabetes examinations, including glycated hemoglobin (A1c), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), urine microalbumin (MAU), routine urinalysis (UR), and fundus examination (FE).

656443,An analysis of the ethics of lockdown in India,2020-07-09,"Social distancing protocols have been highly recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) to curb the spread of COVID-19. However, one major challenge to enforcing social distancing in public areas is how to perceive people in three dimensions. This paper proposes an innovative pedestrian 3D localization method using monocular images combined with terrestrial point clouds. In the proposed approach, camera calibration is achieved based on the correspondences between 2D image points and 3D world points. The vertical coordinates of the ground plane where pedestrians stand are extracted from the point clouds. Then, using the assumption that the pedestrian is always perpendicular to the ground, the 3D coordinates of the pedestrian’s feet and head are calculated iteratively using collinear equations. This allows the three-dimensional localization and height determination of pedestrians using monocular cameras, which are widely distributed in many major cities. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated using two different datasets. Experimental results show that the pedestrian localization error of the proposed approach was less than one meter within tens of meters and performed better than other localization techniques. The proposed approach uses simple and efficient calculations, obtains accurate location, and can be used to implement social distancing rules. Moreover, since the proposed approach also generates accurate height values, exclusionary schemes to social distancing protocols, particularly the parent-child exemption, can be introduced in the framework.","Niu, Yiru; Xu, Zhihua; Xu, Ershuai; Li, Gongwei; Huo, Yuan; Sun, Wenbin",Sensors (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/s21175908; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34502799/,498

Previous research indicates differences in how students’ health behaviors develop and vary by gender, race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. George Mason University is a state institution that enrolls a highly diverse student population, making it an ideal setting to launch a longitudinal cohort study using multiple research methods to evaluate the effects of health behaviors on physical and psychological functioning, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Mason: Health Starts Here was developed as a longitudinal cohort study of successive waves of first year students that aims to improve understanding of the natural history and determinants of young adults’ physical health, mental health, and their role in college completion. The study recruits first year students who are 18 to 24 years old and able to read and understand English. All incoming first year students are recruited through various methods to participate in a longitudinal cohort for 4 years. Data collection occurs in fall and spring semesters, with online surveys conducted in both semesters and in-person clinic visits conducted in the fall. Students receive physical examinations during clinic visits and provide biospecimens (blood and saliva). CONCLUSIONS: The study will produce new knowledge to help understand the development of health-related behaviors during young adulthood. A long-term goal of the cohort study is to support the design of effective, low-cost interventions to encourage young adults’ consistent performance of healthful behaviors, improve their mental health, and improve academic performance.","Cuellar, Alison E.; Adams, Leah M.; de Jonge, Lilian; Espina, Virginia; Espinoza, Laurette; Fischer, Sarah F.; Frankenfeld, Cara L.; Hines, Denise A.; Kornienko, Olga; Lawrence, Heidi Y.; Rana, Ziaul H.; Ramezani, Niloofar; Rossheim, Matthew E.; Short, Jerome L.; Waithaka, Eric N.; Wilson, Alyssa N.; Cheskin, Lawrence J.",BMC Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33980206/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-10969-5,498

This study aimed to provide an overview of the current situation of anti‐COVID‐19 measures in Japanese enterprises during the winter, considering company size. METHODS: This study was an Internet‐based nationwide cross‐sectional study. Individuals who were registered as full‐time workers were invited to participate in the survey. Data were collected using an online self‐administered questionnaire in December 2020. The chi‐squared test for trend was performed to calculate the P‐value for trend for each workplace measure across company sizes. RESULTS: For the 27 036 participants, across company sizes, the most prevalent workplace measure was encouraging mask wearing at work, followed by requesting that employees refrain from going to work when ill and restricting work‐related social gatherings and entertainment. These measures were implemented by approximately 90% of large‐scale enterprises and by more than 40% of micro‐ and small‐scale enterprises. In contrast, encouraging remote working was implemented by less than half of large‐scale enterprises and by around 20% of micro‐ and small‐scale enterprises. There were statistically significant differences in all workplace measures by company size (all P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: We found that various responses to COVID‐19 had been taken in workplaces. However, some measures, including remote working, were still not well‐implemented, especially in smaller enterprises. The findings suggest that occupational health support for MSMEs is urgently needed to mitigate the current wave of COVID‐19.","Ishimaru, Tomohiro; Nagata, Masako; Hino, Ayako; Yamashita, Satoshi; Tateishi, Seiichiro; Tsuji, Mayumi; Ogami, Akira; Matsuda, Shinya; Fujino, Yoshihisa",J Occup Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33955633/; https://doi.org/10.1002/1348-9585.12224,498
660031,Community Pharmacy Minor Ailment Service (PMAS): An Untapped Resource for Children and Their Carers,2021-05-17,"Zika virus (ZIKV) is a member of the family Flaviviridae. In 2015, ZIKV triggered a large epidemic in Brazil and spread across Latin America. In November of that year, the Brazilian Ministry of Health reported a 20-fold increase in cases of neonatal microcephaly, which corresponds geographically and temporally to the ZIKV outbreak. ZIKV was isolated from the brain tissue of a fetus diagnosed with microcephaly, and recent studies in mice models revealed that ZIKV infection may cause brain defects by influencing brain cell developments. Unfortunately, the mechanisms by which ZIKV alters neurophysiological development remain unknown. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that regulate post-transcriptional gene expression by translational repression. In order to gain insight into the possible role of ZIKV-mediated miRNA signaling dysfunction in brain-tissue development, we computationally predicted new miRNAs encoded by the ZIKV genome and their effective hybridization with transcripts from human genes previously shown to be involved in microcephalia. The results of these studies suggest a possible role of these miRNAs on the expression of human genes associated with this disease. Besides, a new ZIKV miRNA was predicted in the 3’stem loop (3’ SL) of the 3’untranslated region (3’UTR) of the ZIKV genome, suggesting the role of the 3’UTR of flaviviruses as a source of miRNAs.","Cristina, Juan; Echeverría, Natalia; Gambaro, Fabiana; Fajardo, Alvaro; Moreno, Pilar",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/070656,498

Its molecular epidemiological characterization, particularly the genotyping, was poorly addressed. METHODS: The full-length spike (S), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), and nucleocapsid (N) genes were amplified from each respiratory sample collected from 65 HCoV-OC43-positive patients between 2005 and 2012. Genotypes were determined by phylogenetic analysis. Recombination was analyzed based on full-length viral genome sequences. Clinical manifestations of each HCoV genotype infection were compared by reviewing clinical records. RESULTS: Sixty of these 65 samples belong to genotypes B, C and D. The remaining five strains had incongruent positions in the phylogenetic trees of the S, RdRp and N genes, suggesting a novel genotype emerging, designated as genotype E. Whole genome sequencing and bootscan analysis indicated that genotype E is generated by recombination between genotypes B, C and D. Temporal analysis revealed a sequential genotype replacement of C, B, D and E over the study period with genotype D being the dominant genotype since 2007. The novel genotype E was only detected in children younger than three years suffering from lower respiratory tract infections. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that HCoV-OC43 genotypes are evolving.

The treatment of lipid disorders was revolutionized with the introduction of statins which have become the most important therapeutic option available today to reduce and prevent atherosclerosis and its detrimental consequences like cardiovascular diseases and stroke. With and optimized reduction of elevated LDL levels with statins, the risk for cardiovascular diseases (CVD) can be reduced by 30%, indicating a residual remaining risk of 70% for the development and progression of CVD notifying still a high medical need for more effective antilipidemic drugs. Consequently, the search for novel lipid-modifying drugs is still one of the most active areas in research and development in the pharmaceutical industry. Major focus lies on approaches to LDL-lowering drugs superior to statins with regard to efficacy, safety, and patient compliance and on approaches modifying plasma levels and functionality of HDL particles based on the clinically validated inverse relationship between high-plasma HDL levels and the risk for CVD. The available drugs today for the treatment of dyslipidemia are small organic molecules or nonabsorbable polymers for binding of bile acids to be applied orally. Besides small molecules for novel targets, biological drugs such as monoclonal antibodies, antisense or gene-silencing oligonucleotides, peptidomimetics, reconstituted synthetic HDL particles and therapeutic proteins are novel approaches in clinical development are which have to be applied by injection or infusion. The promising clinical results of several novel drug candidates, particularly for LDL cholesterol lowering with monoclonal antibodies raised against PCSK9, may indicate more than a decade after the statins, the entrance of new breakthrough therapies to treat lipid disorders.","Kramer, Werner",Metabolic Control,https://doi.org/10.1007/164_2015_15; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26330256/,498

However, the effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection on pregnant mothers is still poorly understood and sparsely documented. Here, we present a case of a primi mother, who presented with diarrheal episode and proceeded to a hypertensive crisis and placental abruption with rt-PCR (nasopharyngeal swab) confirmed for COVID19. SARS-CoV-2 enters and downregulates host cell-bounded enzyme ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme). This activates the renin angiotensin aldosterone mechanism (RAAM). The activation of RAAM plays a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of hypertensive emergencies. Hence, there is a theoretical possibility of hypertensive crisis associated with ACE2/RAAM dysfunction in pregnant mothers who have COVID19. Therefore, close monitoring of blood pressure and early intervention are of paramount importance in anticipating and preventing serious complications related to hypertension in pregnancy in mothers who have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, especially in this pandemic situation. Emergency hospital admission and urgent care must be afforded to mothers presenting with high blood pressure with the features suggestive of COVID19 as they are at a risk of rapid deterioration.","Bandara, Sajith; Ruwanpathirana, Anura; Nagodawithana, Dhammika; Alwis, Samantha",Case Rep Obstet Gynecol,https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/8868952; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33312744/,498

METHODS: We collected epidemiological and clinical information of patients with COVID-19 admitted to a makeshift Fangcang hospital between 7 and 26 February, 2020. The waiting time of each step during the medical care-seeking process was also analysed. RESULTS: Of the 205 patients with COVID-19 infection, 31% had presumed transmission from a family member. 10% of patients had hospital-related transmission. It took as long as a median of 6 days from the first medical visit to receive the COVID-19 nucleic acid test and 10 days from the first medical visit to hospital admission, indicating early recognition of COVID-19 was not achieved at the early stage of the outbreak, although these delays were shortened later. After clinical recovery from COVID-19, which took a mean of 21 days from illness onset, there was still a substantial proportion of patients who had persistent SARS-CoV-2 infection. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnostic evaluation process of suspected patients needs to be accelerated at the epicentre of the outbreak and early isolation of infected patients in a healthcare setting rather than at home is urgently required to stop the spread of the virus. Clinical recovery is not an appropriate criterion to release isolated patients and as long as 4 weeks' isolation for patients with COVID-19 is not enough to prevent the spread of the virus.","Hua, Jing; Chen, Rongzhang; Zhao, Liming; Wu, Xiaodong; Guo, Qian; He, Chunfeng; Li, Tian; Ren, Xiaoyu; Liu, Zhongmin; Li, Qiang; Wang, Feilong",ERJ Open Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32363205/; https://doi.org/10.1183/23120541.00142-2020,498

The medical health movement and the reconstruction of fiqh of worship during an emergency in particular, and how to deal with the disaster theologically in general. The results showed that the reasoning of Fikih Kebencanaan was expanded in terms of medical, theological, and educational movements.

In recent years, the role of the gut–muscle axis has garnered attention as, along with the gut microbiota, it potentially plays a significant role in muscle regeneration, in addition to nutritional supplements and exercise training. Past studies have found that supplementation with Lactobacillus plantarum TWK10 could effectively increase the muscle mass of animals or adult humans. Therefore, in this study, we investigated whether the supplementation of L. plantarum TWK10 produces increased muscle mass and improves the functional performance of elderly persons with mild fragility. A total of 68 elderly subjects were recruited, of which 13 subjects were excluded or withdrew from the study. We adopted a double-blind design, and the 55 subjects were randomly divided into three groups: the placebo group, the TWK10 low-dose group (2 × 10(10) CFU/day) (TWK10-L), and the TWK10 high-dose group (6 × 10(10) colony-forming unit (CFU)/day) (TWK10-H). For 18 weeks, all subjects were required to regularly take experimental samples, perform functional activity testing, and have their body composition analyzed before the study and every six weeks after the intervention. Finally, 17 subjects in the placebo group, 12 subjects in the TWK10-L group, and 13 subjects in the TWK10-H group finished the study. It was found that supplementation with TWK10 had a tendency to increase and improve muscle mass, left hand grip strength, lower limb muscle strength, and gait speed and balance after the sixth week, especially in the TWK10-H group, and, as the supplement time was longer up to the 18th week, it had an even greater effect (p < 0.05).

Since then, cases have constantly increased and the pandemic has taken a toll on the health system. This requires extra mobilisation of resources to curb the disease and overcome financial loses whilst providing social protection to the poor. Assessing the effects of COVID-19 on South African health system is critical to identify challenges and act timely to strike a balance between managing the emergency and maintaining essential health services. We applied the World Health Organization (WHO) health systems framework to assess the effects of COVID-19 on South African health system, and proposed solutions to address the gaps, with a focus on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and expanded programme on immunisation (EPI) programmes. The emergence of COVID-19 pandemic has direct impact on the health system, negatively affecting its functionality, as depletion of resources to curb the emergency is eminent. Diversion of health workforce, suspension of services, reduced health-seeking behaviour, unavailability of supplies, deterioration in data monitoring and funding crunches are some of the noted challenges. In such emergencies, the ability to deliver essential services is dependent on baseline capacity of health system. Our approach advocates for close collaboration between essential services and COVID-19 teams to identify priorities, restructure essential services to accommodate physical distancing, promote task shifting at primary level, optimise the use of mobile/web-based technologies for service delivery/training/monitoring and involve private sector and non-health departments to increase management capacity. Strategic responses thus planned can assist in mitigating the adverse effects of the pandemic whilst preventing morbidity and mortality from preventable diseases in the population.","Nyasulu, Juliet; Pandya, Himani",Afr J Prim Health Care Fam Med,https://doi.org/10.4102/phcfm.v12i1.2480; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32787396/,498

However, little is known about pediatricians’ experiences with and attitudes toward telehealth. Methods: Data from a nationally representative survey of AAP post-residency US member pediatricians in 2016, restricted to respondents providing direct patient care (n=744; response rate=48.7%). Survey collected information on experience with telehealth in the previous 12 months, perceived barriers to telehealth incorporation, and conditions under which non-users would consider using telehealth. In addition to descriptive statistics, we used multivariable logistic regression to examine characteristics associated with any telehealth experience in the past 12 months. Results: Fifteen percent of pediatricians reported any telehealth use in the 12 months prior to the survey. The most commonly reported barriers to telehealth adoption were insufficient payment and billing issues. Multivariable regression models indicated that pediatricians in rural areas, the West, and subspecialists were most likely to report telehealth use, and identifying barriers was negatively associated with telehealth use. Among non-users, over half indicated they would consider adopting telehealth if they were paid for the visits. Conclusion: Telehealth is considered an important health care delivery mechanism, but only 15% of pediatricians in 2016 reported having used telehealth. Reducing barriers will be instrumental in promoting future telehealth adoption. Many barriers have been reduced during the response to COVID-19, and the impact of these policy changes will need further study.","Sisk, Blake; Alexander, Joshua; Bodnar, Chelsea; Curfman, Alison; Garber, Kelli; McSwain, S.

Here, we present a 4.4 Å structure of full-length human NPC1 and a low-resolution reconstruction of NPC1 in complex with the cleaved glycoprotein (GPcl) of EBOV, both determined by single-particle electron cryomicroscopy. NPC1 contains 13 transmembrane segments (TMs) and three distinct lumenal domains A (also designated NTD), C, and I. TMs 2–13 exhibit a typical resistance-nodulation-cell division fold, among which TMs 3–7 constitute the sterol-sensing domain conserved in several proteins involved in cholesterol metabolism and signaling. A trimeric EBOV-GPcl binds to one NPC1 monomer through the domain C. Our structural and biochemical characterizations provide an important framework for mechanistic understanding of NPC1-mediated intracellular cholesterol trafficking and Ebola virus infection.","Gong, Xin; Qian, Hongwu; Zhou, Xinhui; Wu, Jianping; Wan, Tao; Cao, Pingping; Huang, Weiyun; Zhao, Xin; Wang, Xudong; Wang, Peiyi; Shi, Yi; Gao, George F.; Zhou, Qiang; Yan, Nieng",Cell,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867416305700; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2016.05.022; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27238017/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0092867416305700,498

Procedural dermatology being an integral part of the specialty has also been profoundly affected where all elective and cosmetic procedures are presently being deferred, giving priority only to urgent and inescapable dermatologic procedures to curb down the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in hospitals. With no certainty as to when the pandemic is going to end, procedural dermatology will be resumed in times to come, which must be taken up with cautious precautions. Dermatosurgeons must formulate protocols, restructure their facilities, and implement stringent measures with the aim to limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2, providing, at the same time, essential surgical care to patients. This review highlights the salient precautions to be observed in a dermatosurgery facility based on the current recommendations.

667552,Trainee Teachers’ Perceptions of Online Teaching During Field Experience with Young Children,2021-07-14,"Mobility restrictions have been identified as key non-pharmaceutical interventions to limit the spread of the SARS-COV-2 epidemics. However, these interventions present significant drawbacks to the social fabric and negative outcomes for the real economy. In this paper we propose a real-time monitoring framework for tracking the economic consequences of various forms of mobility reductions involving European countries. We adopt a granular representation of mobility patterns during both the first and second waves of SARS-COV-2 in Italy, Germany, France and Spain to provide an analytical characterization of the rate of losses of industrial production by means of a nowcasting methodology. Our approach exploits the information encoded in massive datasets of human mobility provided by Facebook and Google, which are published at higher frequencies than the target economic variables, in order to obtain an early estimate before the official data becomes available. Our results show, in first place, the ability of mobility-related policies to induce a contraction of mobility patterns across jurisdictions. Besides this contraction, we observe a substitution effect which increases mobility within jurisdictions. Secondly, we show how industrial production strictly follows the dynamics of population commuting patterns and of human mobility trends, which thus provide information on the day-by-day variations in countries’ economic activities. Our work, besides shedding light on how policy interventions targeted to induce a mobility contraction impact the real economy, constitutes a practical toolbox for helping governments to design appropriate and balanced policy actions aimed at containing the SARS-COV-2 spread, while mitigating the detrimental effect on the economy. Our study reveals how complex mobility patterns can have unequal consequences to economic losses across countries and call for a more tailored implementation of restrictions to balance the containment of contagion with the need to sustain economic activities.","Spelta, Alessandro; Pagnottoni, Paolo",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-92134-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34158531/,498

Since identification, infections (coronavirus disease-2019; COVID-19) caused by this novel pathogen have spread globally, with more than 180,000 confirmed cases as of March 16, 2020. Effective public health interventions, including social distancing, contact tracing, and isolation/quarantine rely on the rapid and accurate identification of confirmed cases. However, testing capacity (having sufficient tests and laboratory throughput) to support these non-pharmaceutical interventions remains a challenge for containment and mitigation of COVID-19 infections. We undertook a sentinel event strategy (where single health events signal emerging trends) to estimate the incidence of COVID-19 in the US. Data from a recent national conference, the Conservative Political Action Conference, (CPAC) near Washington, DC and from the outbreak in Wuhan, China were used to fit a simple exponential growth model to estimate the total number of incident SARS- CoV-2 infections in the United States on March 1, 2020, and to forecast subsequent infections potentially undetected by current testing strategies. Our analysis and forecasting estimates a total of 54,100 SARS-CoV-2 infections (80 % CI 5,600 to 125,300) have occurred in the United States to March 12, 2020. Our forecast predicts that a very substantial number of infections are undetected, and without extensive and far-reaching non-pharmaceutical interventions, the number of infections should be expected to grow at an exponential rate.","Lover, Andrew A.; McAndrew, Thomas",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.17.20037648,498
667568,Looking Ahead to 2030: Survey of Evolving Needs in Pharmacy Education,2021-03-17,"Background Ethnic minorities have higher rates of SARS-CoV-2 diagnoses, but little is known about ethnic differences in past exposure. We aimed to determine whether prevalence and determinants of SARS-CoV-2 exposure varied between six ethnic groups in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Methods Participants aged 25-79 years enrolled in a population-based prospective cohort were randomly selected within ethnic groups and invited to test for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies and answer COVID-19 related questions. We estimated prevalence and determinants of SARS-CoV-2 exposure within ethnic groups using survey-weighted logistic regression adjusting for age, sex and calendar time. Results Between June 24-October 9, 2020, we included 2497 participants. Adjusted SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence was comparable between ethnic-Dutch (25/498; 5.5%, 95%CI=3.2-7.9), South-Asian Surinamese (22/451; 4.8%, 95%CI=2.1-7.5), African Surinamese (22/400; 8.2%, 95%CI=3.0-13.4), Turkish (30/408; 7.8%, 95%CI=4.3-11.2) and Moroccan (32/391; 7.0%, 95%CI=4.0-9.9) participants, but higher among Ghanaians (95/327; 26.5%, 95%CI=18.7-34.4). 57.1% of SARS-CoV-2-positive participants did not suspect or were unsure of being infected, which was lowest in African Surinamese (18.2%) and highest in Ghanaians (90.5%). Determinants of SARS-CoV-2 exposure varied across ethnic groups, while the most common determinant was having a household member suspected of infection. In Ghanaians, seropositivity was associated with older age, larger household sizes, living with small children, leaving home to work and attending religious services. Conclusions No remarkable differences in SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence were observed between the largest ethnic groups in Amsterdam after the first wave of infections. The higher infection seroprevalence observed among Ghanaians, which passed mostly unnoticed, warrants wider prevention efforts and opportunities for non-symptom-based testing.","Coyer, L.; Boyd, A.; Schinkel, J.; Agyemang, C.; Galenkamp, H.; Koopman, A.

The etiological agent of this disease has been identified as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Testing has been scarce, leading to a highly selective criteria to administer the test. These factors have led to a standard of care mandating a rule out process of other infectious etiologies prior to testing for COVID-19. This highlighted the unpreparedness of the global healthcare infrastructure. We present a case of co-infection with SARS-CoV-2, Influenza A virus, and Haemophilus Influenza bacteremia infections. CASE PRESENTATION: 88 year old female with medical history of coronary artery disease, heart failure, COPD, VTE, presented to the hospital with fever and dyspnea for one week. Patient had been compliant with social distancing. Initial workup revealed a positive Influenza A and bilateral infiltrates on chest x-ray. Inflammatory markers were elevated, including Ferritin, C-reactive protein, Interleukin-6, Lactate Dehydrogenase and D-dimer. Due to continued hypoxia, patient was intubated. SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal PCR was found to be positive. Blood cultures were also positive for Haemophilus Influenza. A course of Oseltamivir, Hydroxychloroquine and Ceftriaxone was completed. She responded well to therapy and was ultimately extubated on day nine. Patient was discharged making a full recovery. DISCUSSION: We highlight a case of SARS-CoV-2 with not only influenza A co-infection, but a Haemophilus influenza bacteremia of presumed respiratory source. Literature confirms that the most common superimposed bacterial infections related to Influenza A are bacterial pneumonias secondary to S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, and H. influenzae;and co-infection with Influenza A tends to be the most deadly. Rates of severe infection and mortality are highest in those aged greater than 65 and with co-morbidities. As SARS-CoV-2 is still a novel coronavirus being studied, there is limited literature regarding co-infection, however there are several case reports of influenza A coinfection with SARS-CoV-2. A positive influenza screen does not exclude SARS-CoV-2 infection, and a positive SARS-CoV-2 result does not preclude the development of bacterial superinfection. There is certainly a benefit in continued management of both influenza and potential coverage for bacterial causes until appropriate testing is obtained. CONCLUSIONS: This case demonstrates the probable underdiagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 given the under-reported rate of co-infections with other respiratory viruses. We recommend that clinicians take into consideration the likelihood of co-infection of pathogens along with SARS-CoV-2, both viral and bacterial. We also recommend higher volume testing for SARS-CoV-2, especially during this pandemic, as it will be crucial for not only controlling the spread, but improving clinical management.

668716,"The policy dimensions, regulatory landscape, and market characteristics of teledermatology in the United States",2020-11-06,"Background The novel coronavirus disease (2019-nCoV) has been affecting global health since the end of 2019 and there is no sign that the epidemic is abating. The major issue for controlling the infectious is lacking efficient prevention and therapeutic approaches. Chloroquine (CQ) and Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have been reported to treat the disease, but the underlying mechanism remains controversial. Purpose The objective of this study is to investigate whether CQ and HCQ could be ACE2 blockers and used to inhibit 2019-nCoV virus infection. Methods In our study, we used CCK-8 staining, flow cytometry and immunofluorescent staining to evaluate the toxicity and autophagy of CQ and HCQ, respectively, on ACE2 high-expressing HEK293T cells (ACE2h cells). We further analyzed the binding character of CQ and HCQ to ACE2 by molecular docking and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assays, 2019-nCoV spike pseudotyped virus was also used to observe the viropexis effect of CQ and HCQ in ACE2h cells. Results Results showed that HCQ is slightly more toxic to ACE2h cells than CQ. Both CQ and HCQ could bind to ACE2 with KD =(7.31±0.62)e−7 M and (4.82±0.87)e−7 M, respectively. They exhibit equivalent suppression effect for the entrance of 2019-nCoV spike pseudotyped virus into ACE2h cells. Conclusions CQ and HCQ both inhibit the entrance 2019-nCoV into cells by blocking the binding of the virus with ACE2. Our findings provide novel insights into the molecular mechanism of CQ and HCQ treatment effect on virus infection.","Wang, Nan; Han, Shengli; Liu, Rui; Meng, Liesu; He, Huaizhen; Zhang, Yongjing; Wang, Cheng; Lv, Yanni; Wang, Jue; Li, Xiaowei; Ding, Yuanyuan; Fu, Jia; Hou, Yajing; Lu, Wen; Ma, Weina; Zhan, Yingzhuan; Dai, Bingling; Zhang, Jie; Pan, Xiaoyan; Hu, Shiling; Gao, Jiapan; Jia, Qianqian; Zhang, Liyang; Ge, Shuai; Wang, Saisai; Liang, Peida; Hu, Tian; Lu, Jiayu; Wang, Xiangjun; Zhou, Huaxin; Ta, Wenjing; Wang, Yuejin; Lu, Shemin; He, Langchong",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.22.164665,498

We developed a mathematical model to simulate the COVID-19 pandemic with digital contact tracing and testing strategies. The model uses a real-world social network generated from a high-resolution contact data set of 180 students. This model incorporates infectivity variations, test sensitivities, incubation period, and asymptomatic cases. We present a method to extend the weighted temporal social network and present simulations on a network of 5000 students. The purpose of this work is to investigate optimal quarantine rules and testing strategies with digital contact tracing. The results show that the traditional strategy of quarantining direct contacts reduces infections by less than 20% without sufficient testing. Periodic testing every 2 weeks without contact tracing reduces infections by less than 3%. A variety of strategies are discussed including testing second and third degree contacts and the pre-exposure notification system, which acts as a social radar warning users how far they are from COVID-19. The most effective strategy discussed in this work was combining the pre-exposure notification system with testing second and third degree contacts. This strategy reduces infections by 18.3% when 30% of the population uses the app, 45.2% when 50% of the population uses the app, 72.1% when 70% of the population uses the app, and 86.8% when 95% of the population uses the app. When simulating the model on an extended network of 5000 students, the results are similar with the contact tracing app reducing infections by up to 79%.","Xu, Daniel",Math Biosci,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mbs.2021.108645; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025556421000821?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34147516/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0025556421000821,498

Here, we report the clinical characteristics and outcomes for both patients with COVID-19 and the anaesthetists who provided their spinal anaesthesia. METHODS: Forty-nine patients with radiologically confirmed COVID-19 for Caesarean section or lower-limb surgery undergoing spinal anaesthesia in Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan, China participated in this retrospective study. Clinical characteristics and perioperative outcomes were recorded. For anaesthesiologists exposed to patients with COVID-19 by providing spinal anaesthesia, the level of personal protective equipment (PPE) used, clinical outcomes (pulmonary CT scans), and confirmed COVID-19 transmission rates (polymerase chain reaction [PCR]) were reviewed. RESULTS: Forty-nine patients with COVID-19 requiring supplementary oxygen before surgery had spinal anaesthesia (ropivacaine 0.75%), chiefly for Caesarean section (45/49 [91%]). Spinal anaesthesia was not associated with cardiorespiratory compromise intraoperatively. No patients subsequently developed severe pneumonia. Of 44 anaesthetists, 37 (84.1%) provided spinal anaesthesia using Level 3 PPE. Coronavirus disease 2019 infection was subsequently confirmed by PCR in 5/44 (11.4%) anaesthetists. One (2.7%) of 37 anaesthetists who wore Level 3 PPE developed PCR-confirmed COVID-19 compared with 4/7 (57.1%) anaesthetists who had Level 1 protection in the operating theatre (relative risk reduction: 95.3% [95% confidence intervals: 63.7–99.4]; P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Spinal anaesthesia was delivered safely in patients with active COVID-19 infection, the majority of whom had Caesarean sections.

675795,The City Under COVID‐19: Podcasting As Digital Methodology,2020-06-09,"BACKGROUND: The current outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has quickly spread across countries and become a global crisis. However, one of the most important clinical characteristics in epidemiology, the distribution of the incubation period, remains unclear. Different estimates of the incubation period of COVID-19 were reported in recent published studies, but all have their own limitations. In this study, we propose a novel low-cost and accurate method to estimate the incubation distribution. METHODS: We have conducted a cross-sectional and forward follow-up study by identifying those asymptomatic individuals at their time of departure from Wuhan and then following them until their symptoms developed. The renewal process is hence adopted by considering the incubation period as a renewal and the duration between departure and symptom onset as a forward recurrence time. Under mild assumptions, the observations of selected forward times can be used to consistently estimate the parameters in the distribution of the incubation period. Such a method enhances the accuracy of estimation by reducing recall bias and utilizing the abundant and readily available forward time data. FINDINGS: The estimated distribution of forward time fits the observations in the collected data well. The estimated median of incubation period is 8·13 days (95% confidence interval [CI]: 7·37–8·91), the mean is 8·62 days (95% CI: 8·02–9·28), the 90th percentile is 14·65 days (95% CI: 14·00–15·26), and the 99th percentile is 20·59 days (95% CI: 19·47, 21·62). Compared with results in other studies, the incubation period estimated in this study is longer. INTERPRETATION: Based on the estimated incubation distribution in this study, about 10% of patients with COVID-19 would not develop symptoms until 14 days after infection. Further study of the incubation distribution is warranted to directly estimate the proportion with long incubation periods.","Qin, Jing; You, Chong; Lin, Qiushi; Hu, Taojun; Yu, Shicheng; Zhou, Xiao-Hua",medRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.06.20032417; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32511426/,498

Here, we profile the antibody response of 162 well-characterized COVID-19 symptomatic patients followed longitudinally for up to eight months from symptom onset. Using two newly developed assays we detect SARS-CoV-2 neutralization and antibodies binding to Spike antigens and nucleoprotein as well as to Spike S2 antigen of seasonal beta-coronaviruses, and to hemagglutinin of the H1N1 flu virus. Presence of neutralizing antibodies withing the first weeks from symptom onset correlates with time to a negative swab result (p=0.002) while lack of neutralization with an increased risk of a fatal disease outcome (HR 2.918, 95%CI 1.321-6.449; p=0.008). Neutralizing antibody titers progressively drop after 5-8 weeks but are still detectable up to 8 months in the majority of recovered patients regardless of age or co-morbidities. IgG to Spike antigens are the best correlate of neutralization. Antibody responses to seasonal coronaviruses are temporary boosted and parallel those to SARS-CoV-2 without dampening the specific response or worsening disease progression. Thus, a compromised immune response to the Spike rather than an enhanced one is a major trait of patients with critical conditions. Patients should be promptly identified and immediately start therapeutic interventions aimed at restoring their immunity.","Dispinseri, S.; Secchi, M.; Pirillo, M.

METHOD: During February 1 to February 20, 2020, 1,002 members of the HCWs from Xi’an and Wuhan completed a 12-item questionnaire regarding pressure about the COVID-19 influenza pandemic, along with the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). The GHQ-12 scale was divided by three points. The positive group was scored more than 3. All data were analyzed by SPSS. RESULTS: More than half of the participants (61.1%) reported psychological distress. The HCWs have sufficient information about the COVID-19 symptoms, prognosis, treatment, infection route, and preventive measures (medians ranged from 6/9 to 8/9).

676584,"Using a Web-Based Platform as an Alternative for Conducting International, Multidisciplinary Medical Conferences During the Novel COVID-19 Pandemic: Analysis of a Conference",2021-06-09,"OBJECTIVE: Disease containment of COVID-19 has necessitated widespread social isolation. We aimed to establish what is known about how loneliness and disease containment measures impact on the mental health in children and adolescents. METHOD: For this rapid review, we searched MEDLINE, PSYCHINFO, and Web of Science for articles published between 01/01/1946 and 03/29/2020. 20% of articles were double screened using pre-defined criteria and 20% of data was double extracted for quality assurance. RESULTS: 83 articles (80 studies) met inclusion criteria. Of these, 63 studies reported on the impact of social isolation and loneliness on the mental health of previously healthy children and adolescents (n=51,576; mean age 15.3) 61 studies were observational; 18 were longitudinal and 43 cross sectional studies assessing self-reported loneliness in healthy children and adolescents. One of these studies was a retrospective investigation after a pandemic. Two studies evaluated interventions. Studies had a high risk of bias although longitudinal studies were of better methodological quality. Social isolation and loneliness increased the risk of depression, and possibly anxiety at the time loneliness was measured and between 0.25 to 9 years later. Duration of loneliness was more strongly correlated with mental health symptoms than intensity of loneliness. CONCLUSION: Children and adolescents are probably more likely to experience high rates of depression and probably anxiety during and after enforced isolation ends. This may increase as enforced isolation continues. Clinical services should offer preventative support and early intervention where possible and be prepared for an increase in mental health problems.","Loades, Maria Elizabeth; Chatburn, Eleanor; Higson-Sweeney, Nina; Reynolds, Shirley; Shafran, Roz; Brigden, Amberly; Linney, Catherine; McManus, Megan Niamh; Borwick, Catherine; Crawley, Esther",J Am Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0890856720303373; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaac.2020.05.009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32504808/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0890856720303373?v=s5,498

In response to these problems, two bills have been introduced in Congress to not only reform emergency use of diagnostic tests, but to fundamentally reform diagnostics regulation in non-emergencies. There has been a long-standing recognition that current U.S. regulation of diagnostics is outdated and problematic, and the history of public health legislation is that emergencies and crises have been the primary motivating factor to break Congressional inertia and to implement new legislation. Thus, the COVID-19 may create a useful “window of opportunity” to pass much-needed legislative reform of diagnostic regulation in both emergency and non-emergency contexts. At the same time, rushing radical legislative changes, especially if they have not been subject to careful stakeholder engagement and Congressional deliberation in advance, is precarious and could result in reckless and disruptive changes. We review and apply the historical lessons of legislating in response to a crisis and conclude the one but not both of the pending legislative proposals may satisfy the criteria for an appropriate opportunistic change for diagnostics regulation.","Johnson, Walter G; Marchant, Gary E",J Law Biosci,https://doi.org/10.1093/jlb/lsaa042; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32959005/,498

METHODS: We searched Google Trends for 118 search queries within the United States. We compared two timeframes of 2020 (March 15–July 4 and July 5–October 31) to similar timeframes over the four prior years (2016–2019). RESULTS: In the early pandemic, March 15–July 4, a statistically significant decrease in relative search volume of the majority of queries (60%) was detected, with a significant increase in only 2 queries (i.e. myalgia and toe swelling). In the phase July through October, a statistically significant decrease was detected in only 22% of search queries; there was no difference for 60% of search queries between 2020 and 2016–2019 suggesting a return to their prior levels for most of search queries. Interestingly, the search volume of 18% of search queries (i.e. fatigue, joint pain, muscle pain, myalgia, spondylosis, radiculopathy, myelopathy, neck pain, neck strain, lower back strain, sciatica, shoulder pain, frozen shoulder, elbow pain, lateral epicondylitis, wrist pain, carpal tunnel, hand pain, finger pain, trigger finger, and Morton’s neuroma) was significantly increased compared with the four prior years. CONCLUSION: Public interest focused on COVID-19 and sought online information for COVID-19 symptoms in the early pandemic. In the period July through October, there was an upward trend in musculoskeletal symptoms and some colloquial terms/well-known musculoskeletal conditions coupled with a downward trend in general musculoskeletal disorder terms and certain specific diagnoses. This information may help rheumatologists understand public interest in musculoskeletal symptoms and disorders and address the needs of patients to mitigate the negative impact of the pandemic on outcomes.

It has prompted regulatory authorities to consider new ways of working and introduced, amongst others, remote inspections to validate the integrity of the regulatory data submitted by companies; evaluate the quality of production and manufacturing sites, and to ensure the conformity with Good Regulatory Practices with the overall goal of guaranteeing patient safety during the crisis. Method We summarize and discuss remote inspection guidelines and other related information made available by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (Australia), the European Medicines Agency (EMA), the Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices Agency (Japan), the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (UK), and the US Food and Drug Administration (US FDA). We also analyse the impact of the pandemic on inspections conducted by the inspectorates of the EMA and the US FDA. Findings The regulatory authorities that we studied all recognized the importance of implementing regulatory policies on remote inspections in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The remote inspection guidelines from the five selected regulatory authorities aimed at mitigating the impact of pandemic but, while providing valuable advice to the pharma companies and being similar in intent, were not always aligned in terms of approach and solutions. Implications On-site inspections are likely to continue to be the norm and preferred standard for the foreseeable future. But the health authorities will need to further adopt a risk-based inspection approach and stimulate the increased uptake of inspection reliance as proposed by the Pharmaceutical Inspection Convention and Pharmaceutical Inspection Co-operation Scheme not to overwhelm the pharma companies with repeat and redundant inspections. Remote inspections have proven to be a novel inspection tool, but it is important for health authorities to align on their approach on remote inspections in terms of methods applied and documentation requested.","Mofid, Sarah; Bolislis, Winona Rei; Brading, Clive; Hamilton, Nigel; Hardit, Cyril; Nagaoka, Makoto; Parain, Julien; Zanta, Maria; Kühler, Thomas C.",Clin Ther,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149291821003982?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0149291821003982,498
678844,Global Determinants of Covid-19 Deaths: Lockdown Dates and Social Distancing Measures Mattered,2020-07-29,"The SARS-CoV-2 virus like many other viruses has transformed in a continual manner to give rise to new variants by means of mutations commonly through substitutions and indels. These mutations in some cases can give the virus a survival advantage making the mutants dangerous. In general, laboratory investigation must be carried to determine whether the new variants have any characteristics that can make them more lethal and contagious. Therefore, complex and time-consuming analyses are required in order to delve deeper into the exact impact of a particular mutation. The time required for these analyses makes it difficult to understand the variants of concern and thereby limiting the preventive action that can be taken against them spreading rapidly. In this analysis, we have deployed a statistical technique Shannon Entropy, to identify positions in the spike protein of SARS Cov-2 viral sequence which are most susceptible to mutations. Subsequently, we also use machine learning based clustering techniques to cluster known dangerous mutations based on similarities in properties. This work utilizes embeddings generated using language modeling, the ProtBERT model, to identify mutations of a similar nature and to pick out regions of interest based on proneness to change. Our entropy-based analysis successfully predicted the fifteen hotspot regions, among which we were able to validate ten known variants of interest. As the situation of SARS-COV-2 virus rapidly evolves we believe that the remaining nine mutational hotspots may contain variants that can emerge in the future. We believe that this may be promising in helping the research community to devise therapeutics based on probable new mutation zones in the viral sequence and resemblance in properties of various mutations","Mullick, Baishali; Magar, Rishikesh; Jhunjhunwala, Aastha; Farimani, Amir Barati",Comput Biol Med,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compbiomed.2021.104915; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34655896/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010482521007095?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0010482521007095,498

However, because of its unknown ancestors and hosts, elucidating the genetic variations of the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has been difficult. Without needing to know ancestors, we identified an uneven distribution of local genome similarities among the viruses categorized by geographic regions, and it was strongly correlated with incidence and mortality. To ensure unbiased and origin-independent analyses, we used a pairwise comparison of local genome sequences of virus genomes by Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST). We found a strong statistical correlation between dominance of the SARS-CoV-2 in distributions of uneven similarities and the incidence and mortality of illness. Genomic annotation of the BLAST hits also showed that viruses from geographic regions with severe infections tended to have more dynamic genomic regions in the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) and receptor-binding motif (RBM) of the spike protein (S protein). Dynamic domains in the S protein were also confirmed by a canyon region of mismatches coincident with RBM and RBD, without hits of alignments of 100% matching. Thus, our origin-independent analysis suggests that the dynamic and unstable SARS-CoV-2-RBD could be the main reason for diverse incidence and mortality of COVID-19 infection.","Yang, Wenzhong; Jin, Guangxu",Brief Bioinform,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32924062/; https://doi.org/10.1093/bib/bbaa208,498
681199,Chapter 15 Millennials and COVID-19,2022-12-31,"Background: COVID-19 can lead to acute respiratory failure and an exaggerated inflammatory response. Studies have suggested promising outcomes using monoclonal antibodies targeting IL-1{beta} (Anakinra) or IL6 (Tocilizumab), however no head to head comparison was done between the two treatments. Herein, we report our experience in treating COVID-19 pneumonia associated with cytokine storm with either subcutaneous Anakinra given concomitantly with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), or intravenous Tocilizumab. Methods: Comprehensive clinical and laboratory data from patients with COVID-19 pneumonia admitted at our hospital between March and May 2020 were collected. Patients who received either Anakinra/ IVIG or Tocilizumab were selected. Baseline characteristics including oxygen therapy, respiratory status evaluation using ROX index, clinical assessment using NEWS score and laboratory data were collected. Outcomes included mortality, intubation, ICU admission and length of stay. In addition, we compared the change in ROX index, NEWS score and inflammatory markers at days 7 and 14 post initiation of therapy. Results: 84 consecutive patients who received either treatment (51 in the Anakinra/ IVIG group and 33 in the Tocilizumab group) were retrospectively studied. Baseline inflammatory markers were similar in both groups. There was no significant difference regarding to death (21.6% vs 15.2%, p 0.464), intubation (15.7% vs 24.2%, p 0.329), ICU need (57.1% vs 48.5%, p 0.475) or length of stay (13+9.6 vs 14.9+11.6, p 0.512) in the Anakinra/IVIG and Tocilizumab, respectively. Additionally, the rate of improvement in ROX index, NEWS score and inflammatory markers was similar in both groups at days 7 and 14. Furthermore, there was no difference in the incidence of superinfection in both groups. Conclusion: Treating COVID-19 pneumonia associated with cytokine storm features with either subcutaneous Anakinra/IVIG or intravenous Tocilizumab is associated with improved clinical outcomes in most subjects. The choice of treatment does not appear to affect morbidity or mortality. Randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm our study findings.

682588,Impacts of the COVID‐19 pandemic on the productivity of academics who mother,2021-05-20,"A novel coronavirus (CoV), Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged in late 2019 in Wuhan, China and has since spread as a global pandemic. Safe and effective vaccines are thus urgently needed to reduce the significant morbidity and mortality of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) disease and ease the major economic impact. There has been an unprecedented rapid response by vaccine developers with now over one hundred vaccine candidates in development and at least six having reached clinical trials. However, a major challenge during rapid development is to avoid safety issues both by thoughtful vaccine design and by thorough evaluation in a timely manner. A syndrome of “disease enhancement” has been reported in the past for a few viral vaccines where those immunized suffered increased severity or death when they later encountered the virus or were found to have an increased frequency of infection. Animal models allowed scientists to determine the underlying mechanism for the former in the case of Respiratory Syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine and have been utilized to design and screen new RSV vaccine candidates. Because some Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and SARS-CoV-1 vaccines have shown evidence of disease enhancement in some animal models, this is a particular concern for SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. To address this challenge, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and the Brighton Collaboration (BC) Safety Platform for Emergency vACcines (SPEAC) convened a scientific working meeting on March 12 and 13, 2020 of experts in the field of vaccine immunology and coronaviruses to consider what vaccine designs could reduce safety concerns and how animal models and immunological assessments in early clinical trials can help to assess the risk. This report summarizes the evidence presented and provides considerations for safety assessment of COVID-19 vaccine candidates in accelerated vaccine development.","Lambert, Paul-Henri; Ambrosino, Donna M.; Andersen, Svein R.; Baric, Ralph S.; Black, Steven B.; Chen, Robert T.; Dekker, Cornelia L.; Didierlaurent, Arnaud M.; Graham, Barney S.; Martin, Samantha D.; Molrine, Deborah C.; Perlman, Stanley; Picard-Fraser, Philip A.; Pollard, Andrew J.; Qin, Chuan; Subbarao, Kanta; Cramer, Jakob P.",Vaccine,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X2030709X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32507409/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2020.05.064; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X2030709X?v=s5,498
683420,Teaming and Thinking Outside the Box for Trainee Redeployment During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,2021-06-01,"BACKGROUND: In prisons in England, integrated treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD) is accessible and effective, commonly based on daily supervised consumption of methadone. Treatment limitations (inadequate dosing, nonengagement with care, stigma, diversion and bullying) are noted. Flexible dose, injectable prolonged-release buprenorphine (PRB) which removes the need for daily dispensing and supervision is suggested for prisoner care. This work aimed to predict the difference in costs of current standard of care vs partial introduction of PRB. METHODS: A predictive model of compared costs for the provision of OUD care in the prison setting in England evaluated current standard of care (all receive methadone) with a future situation of 30% of prisoners electing to use a monthly dose of PRB. Evidence describing costs to deliver OUD care for 150 prisoners (pharmacotherapy, direct service, indirect health care, indirect security costs) were collected, including assumptions describing how care would be delivered. Evidence sources include national data sources, scientific literature and from experience in the prison health care setting. RESULTS: For a representative standard prison population requiring OUD care of 150 prisoners in England PRB introduction is associated with a predicted reduction in direct and indirect costs of OUD care. Annual OUD care costs for current standard of care were £0.6M; with 30% PRB costs reduced by £8665, more than 3000 hours of staff time is saved. Sensitivity analyses showed greater adoption of PRB resulted in further cost reduction. CONCLUSION: PRB can address limitations of OUD care in prisons and improve outcomes. Introduction does not increase cost of care in this predictive analysis. PRB may lead the transformation of prisoner OUD care.","Wright, Nat; Hard, Jake; Fearns, Colin; Gilman, Mark; Littlewood, Richard; Clegg, Rachael; Parimelalagan, Luxman; Alam, Farrukh",Clinicoecon Outcomes Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32982339/; https://doi.org/10.2147/ceor.s256714,498

For directly transmitted infections, pathogen transmission relies on human-to-human contact, with kinship, household, and societal structures shaping contact patterns that in turn determine epidemic dynamics. Social, economic, and cultural forces also shape patterns of exposure, health-seeking behaviour, infection outcomes, the likelihood of diagnosis and reporting of cases, and the uptake of interventions. Although these social aspects of epidemiology are hard to quantify and have limited the generalizability of modelling frameworks in a policy context, new sources of data on relevant aspects of human behaviour are increasingly available. Researchers have begun to embrace data from mobile devices and other technologies as useful proxies for behavioural drivers of disease transmission, but there is much work to be done to measure and validate these approaches, particularly for policy-making. Here we discuss how integrating local knowledge in the design of model frameworks and the interpretation of new data streams offers the possibility of policy-relevant models for public health decision-making as well as the development of robust, generalizable theories about human behaviour in relation to infectious diseases.","Buckee, Caroline; Noor, Abdisalan; Sattenspiel, Lisa",Nature,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34194045/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03694-x,498

With its wider devastating consequences, even so-called affluent countries could not provide full coverage for COVID-19vaccines and medications to all of their citizens. Against this backdrop, the main aim of this article is to examine how Global Health Diplomacy (GHD) can play a role in prioritizing vaccine equity in the global health agenda in the fight against COVID-19. The majority of developed countries’ healthcare systems have been exposed and have reached a tipping point.After the completion of eighteen months of the pandemic, only five countries were able to produce vaccines for the treatment of COVID-19. This pandemic has divided the world into two blocs: those with vaccines, such as the United States, the United Kingdom, Russia, China, and India; and those without, such as the rest of the world. The greatest challenges are vaccine inequalities, inequities and distribution, which undermine the global economic recovery. Many poor countries are still waiting for the initial doses to be delivered to their citizens, while some rich nations are planning for booster doses. GHD plays a critical role in establishing successful global collaborations, funding mechanisms and ensuring international cooperation through the combined efforts of all stakeholders. Besides, global solidarity is necessary to lessen the wider gaps between the vaccination status of rich and poor nations. Therefore, through GHD, the vaccine gaps and inequities can be addressed to strengthen global health security and accelerate global economic recovery.","Singh, Bawa; Chattu, Vijay Kumar",Health Promot Perspect,https://doi.org/10.34172/hpp.2021.36,498

The German Food Online Retail,2020-06-19,"BACKGROUND: At the end of February 2020, the spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in China had drastically slowed and appeared to be under control compared to the peak data in early February of that year. However, the outcomes of COVID-19 control and prevention measures varied between regions (ie, provinces and municipalities) in China; moreover, COVID-19 has become a global pandemic, and the spread of the disease has accelerated in countries outside China. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to establish valid models to evaluate the effectiveness of COVID-19 control and prevention among various regions in China. These models also targeted regions with control and prevention problems by issuing immediate warnings. METHODS: We built a mathematical model, the Epidemic Risk Time Series Model, and used it to analyze two sets of data, including the daily COVID-19 incidence (ie, newly diagnosed cases) as well as the daily immigration population size. RESULTS: Based on the results of the model evaluation, some regions, such as Shanghai and Zhejiang, were successful in COVID-19 control and prevention, whereas other regions, such as Heilongjiang, yielded poor performance. The evaluation result was highly correlated with the basic reproduction number (R(0)) value, and the result was evaluated in a timely manner at the beginning of the disease outbreak. CONCLUSIONS: The Epidemic Risk Time Series Model was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of COVID-19 control and prevention in different regions in China based on analysis of immigration population data. Compared to other methods, such as R(0), this model enabled more prompt issue of early warnings. This model can be generalized and applied to other countries to evaluate their COVID-19 control and prevention.","Huang, Qiangsheng; Kang, Yu Sunny",JMIR Public Health Surveill,https://doi.org/10.2196/18638; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32396132/,498
687143,Food Hardship during the Covid‐19 Pandemic and Great Recession,2020-10-02,"BACKGROUND: In pediatric palliative care (PPC), there is a need to involve the child's voice in situations regarding their symptoms and care needs. Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) can be tools to systematically gather data reported from the child or a proxy if the child is not capable to self-report in order to provide the services they need. There has been a rapid development in PROM research the last decade, and there is a need for an overview of current knowledge and experiences in the field. Thus, we aim to explore and summarize what is known from the published research about PROMs in PPC. METHODS: We propose a scoping review following the framework by Arksey and O'Malley and the PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews checklist. A systematic search will be performed in the following databases: Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (Medline), Excerpta Medica database (EMBASE), Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), American Psychological Association (APA) PsycInfo, Health and Psychosocial Instruments (HaPI), and Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED). The search will be followed by snowballing to identify key papers and significant researchers for additional citations. Covidence will facilitate the independent review of eligible citations, and data will be extracted and presented descriptively, and thematically analyzed using NVivo. DISCUSSION: The scoping review suggested in this protocol will identify PROMs which have been proposed in PPC and clarify the experiences with their use. The findings of this review will be relevant for researchers and healthcare personnel caring for children and adolescents in PPC. In addition, by highlighting knowledge gaps about the use of PROMs in PPC, this review will point out future needs within this field of research, which is crucial for improving quality of care in PPC.

However, when 174 teachers from across the school spectrum participated in Quality Teaching Rounds we found equivalent, and substantial, gains in teaching quality across all levels of school advantage. This result indicates that differences in teaching quality are less a reflection of teacher capabilities than of the challenging circumstances in disadvantaged schools. We argue that policies seeking more equitable achievement should address wider social inequities, rather than unfairly blaming teachers for being unable to level an unequal playing field.","Gore, Jennifer; Jaremus, Felicia; Miller, Andrew",Aust Educ Res,https://doi.org/10.1007/s13384-021-00460-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34341620/,498

The analysis says that half of senior oil & gas professionals expect hydrogen to be a significant part of the energy mix by 2030, so the time is right to begin scaling up the hydrogen economy, despite recent oil market shocks.",,Fuel Cells Bulletin,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1464285920302583; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1464285920302583,498
687798,Osmotic Adaptation by Na(+)-Dependent Transporters and ACE2: Correlation with Hemostatic Crisis in COVID-19,2020-10-30,"This study aims to evaluate the effects of an innovative mind-body practice named the brain wave modulation technique (BWM-T) on stress, anxiety, global distress, and affect. The technique was administered online through a web-based video conferencing platform. The intervention started on week four of the first quarantine in Italy (week commencing 30th March 2020), for a duration of 4 weeks and ended before lockdown measures were loosened. 310 people participated in the study, mean age 28.73 years old (SD = 9.16), 77.8% women. Of these, about half were randomly assigned to the experimental group and the other half served as controls. Participants completed online psychological tests before and after the intervention. 266 people (144 experimental, 122 controls) completed the post-intervention tests. Consistent with our hypothesis, the study’s findings indicate a reduction in the levels of stress, anxiety, global distress, and negative affect in the experimental group, compared to the control group. Moreover, the experimental group also showed higher levels of positive affect, compared to controls after the intervention. The present findings add to the current literature in suggesting that the BWM-T reduced stress not only when administered face-to face but also when administered online during the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, we also noted that the BWM-T has an effect on anxiety, global distress, and affect, which we had not investigated in previous studies.","Cozzolino, Mauro; Celia, Giovanna; Girelli, Laura; Limone, Pierpaolo",Front Psychol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.635877; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34093317/,498

689183,Variation and correlation between ultraviolet index and tropospheric ozone during COVID-19 lockdown over megacities of India,2021-05-29,"BACKGROUND: There is intense interest in developing novel oncolytic viruses, which can be used in cancer therapies along with immune cells such as natural killer (NK) cells. We have previously developed a particle-based method for in vitro expansion of highly cytotoxic human NK cells (PM21-NK cells). Here, we have tested the hypothesis that oncolytic parainfluenza virus 5 (P/V virus) can combine with PM21-NK cells for targeted killing of lung cancer cells. METHODS: PM21-NK cells were assayed for killing of P/V virus-infected A549, H1299 and Calu-1 lung cancer cells in two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) cultures using flow cytometry, luminescence and kinetic imaging-based methods. Blocking antibodies were used to evaluate NK cell activating receptors involved in PM21-NK cell killing of infected target cells. Media transfer experiments tested soluble factors that increase PM21-NK cell killing of both P/V virus-infected and uninfected tumor cells. RESULTS: In 2D cultures, PM21-NK cells efficiently killed P/V virus-infected cancer cells compared with non-infected cells, through involvement of the viral glycoprotein and NK cell receptors NKp30, NKp46 and NKG2D. In 3D spheroid cultures, P/V virus infection was restricted to the outer layer of the spheroid. However, PM21-NK cells were able to more efficiently kill both the outer layer of infected cells in the spheroid and progressing further to kill the uninfected interior cells. Media transfer experiments demonstrated that P/V virus infection produced both type I and type III interferons, which decreased cell growth, which contributed to a reduction in the overall number of uninfected tumor cells in conjunction with PM21-NK cells. Across five cancer cell lines, the contribution of P/V virus infection on PM21-NK cell killing of target cells correlated with interferon induction. CONCLUSION: Our data support the potential of combining oncolytic parainfluenza virus with PM21-NK cell adoptive therapy against lung cancer.","Varudkar, Namita; Oyer, Jeremiah L; Copik, Alicja; Parks, Griffith D",J Immunother Cancer,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34172515/; https://doi.org/10.1136/jitc-2021-002373,498

689892,Use of low-molecular-weight heparin in COVID-19 patients,2020-06-17,"For the control of immunity in COVID-19 survivors and vaccinated subjects there is an urgent need for reliable and rapid serological assays. Based on samples from 63 COVID-19 survivors up to seven months after symptom onset, and on 50 serum samples taken before the beginning of the pandemic, we compared the performance of three commercial immunoassays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgG antibodies (Euroimmun SARS-COV-2 IgA/IgG, Mikrogen recomWell SARS-CoV-2 IgA/IgG, and SERION ELISA agile SARS-CoV-2 IgA/IgG) and three rapid lateral flow (immunochromatographic) tests (Abbott Panbio COVID-19 IgG/IgM, NADAL COVID-19 IgG/IgM, and Cleartest Corona 2019-nCOV IgG/IgM) with a plaque-reduction neutralization test (PRNT50) representing the gold standard. In addition, we report and validate a novel, non-commercial flow cytometry bead-based surrogate test. 57 out of 63 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients (90 %) showed neutralizing antibodies. The sensitivity of the seven assays ranged from 7.0 % to 98.3 %, the specificity from 86.0 % to 100.00 %. Only one commercial immunoassay showed a sensitivity and specificity of greater than 98 %. These data indicate abundant interassay variability.","Krone, M.; GuÌtling, J.; Wagener, J.; Lam, T.-T.; Schoen, C.; Vogel, U.; Stich, A.; Wedekink, F.; Wischhusen, J.; Kerkau, T.; Beyersdorf, N.; Klingler, S.; Backes, S.; DoÌlken, L.; Gasteiger, G.; Kurzai, O.; Schubert-Unkmeir, A.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.07.21251062v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.07.21251062,498
690563,Capsid integrity quantitative PCR to determine virus infectivity in environmental and food applications; a systematic review,2020-05-12,"BACKGROUND: Assessment of the safety and efficacy of vaccines against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in different populations is essential, as is investigation of the efficacy of the vaccines against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, including the B.1.351 (501Y.V2) variant first identified in South Africa. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial to assess the safety and efficacy of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine (AZD1222) in people not infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in South Africa. Participants 18 to less than 65 years of age were assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive two doses of vaccine containing 5×10(10) viral particles or placebo (0.9% sodium chloride solution) 21 to 35 days apart. Serum samples obtained from 25 participants after the second dose were tested by pseudovirus and live-virus neutralization assays against the original D614G virus and the B.1.351 variant. The primary end points were safety and efficacy of the vaccine against laboratory-confirmed symptomatic coronavirus 2019 illness (Covid-19) more than 14 days after the second dose. RESULTS: Between June 24 and November 9, 2020, we enrolled 2026 HIV-negative adults (median age, 30 years); 1010 and 1011 participants received at least one dose of placebo or vaccine, respectively. Both the pseudovirus and the live-virus neutralization assays showed greater resistance to the B.1.351 variant in serum samples obtained from vaccine recipients than in samples from placebo recipients. In the primary end-point analysis, mild-to-moderate Covid-19 developed in 23 of 717 placebo recipients (3.2%) and in 19 of 750 vaccine recipients (2.5%), for an efficacy of 21.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], −49.9 to 59.8). Among the 42 participants with Covid-19, 39 cases (92.9%) were caused by the B.1.351 variant; vaccine efficacy against this variant, analyzed as a secondary end point, was 10.4% (95% CI, −76.8 to 54.8). The incidence of serious adverse events was balanced between the vaccine and placebo groups. CONCLUSIONS: A two-dose regimen of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine did not show protection against mild-to-moderate Covid-19 due to the B.1.351 variant.
