0,"Clinical features of culture-proven Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections at King Abdulaziz University Hospital, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia",2001-07-04,"OBJECTIVE: This retrospective chart review describes the epidemiology and clinical features of 40 patients with culture-proven Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections at King Abdulaziz University Hospital, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. METHODS: Patients with positive M. pneumoniae cultures from respiratory specimens from January 1997 through December 1998 were identified through the Microbiology records. Charts of patients were reviewed. RESULTS: 40 patients were identified, 33 (82.5%) of whom required admission. Most infections (92.5%) were community-acquired. The infection affected all age groups but was most common in infants (32.5%) and pre-school children (22.5%). It occurred year-round but was most common in the fall (35%) and spring (30%). More than three-quarters of patients (77.5%) had comorbidities. Twenty-four isolates (60%) were associated with pneumonia, 14 (35%) with upper respiratory tract infections, and 2 (5%) with bronchiolitis. Cough (82.5%), fever (75%), and malaise (58.8%) were the most common symptoms, and crepitations (60%), and wheezes (40%) were the most common signs. Most patients with pneumonia had crepitations (79.2%) but only 25% had bronchial breathing. Immunocompromised patients were more likely than non-immunocompromised patients to present with pneumonia (8/9 versus 16/31, P = 0.05). Of the 24 patients with pneumonia, 14 (58.3%) had uneventful recovery, 4 (16.7%) recovered following some complications, 3 (12.5%) died because of M pneumoniae infection, and 3 (12.5%) died due to underlying comorbidities. The 3 patients who died of M pneumoniae pneumonia had other comorbidities. CONCLUSION: our results were similar to published data except for the finding that infections were more common in infants and preschool children and that the mortality rate of pneumonia in patients with comorbidities was high.","Madani, Tariq A; Al-Ghamdi, Aisha A",BMC Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC35282/,0
527,Severe pneumococcal pneumonia: impact of new quinolones on prognosis,2011-03-15,"BACKGROUND: Most guidelines have been proposing, for more than 15 years, a β-lactam combined with either a quinolone or a macrolide as empirical, first-line therapy of severe community acquired pneumonia (CAP) requiring ICU admission. Our goal was to evaluate the outcome of patients with severe CAP, focusing on the impact of new rather than old fluoroquinolones combined with β-lactam in the empirical antimicrobial treatments. METHODS: Retrospective study of consecutive patients admitted in a 16-bed general intensive care unit (ICU), between January 1996 and January 2009, for severe (Pneumonia Severity Index > or = 4) community-acquired pneumonia due to non penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae and treated with a β-lactam combined with a fluoroquinolone. RESULTS: We included 70 patients of whom 38 received a β-lactam combined with ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin and 32 combined with levofloxacin. Twenty six patients (37.1%) died in the ICU. Three independent factors associated with decreased survival in ICU were identified: septic shock on ICU admission (AOR = 10.6; 95% CI 2.87-39.3; p = 0.0004), age > 70 yrs. (AOR = 4.88; 95% CI 1.41-16.9; p = 0.01) and initial treatment with a β-lactam combined with ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin (AOR = 4.1; 95% CI 1.13-15.13; p = 0.03). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that, when combined to a β-lactam, levofloxacin is associated with lower mortality than ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin in severe pneumococcal community-acquired pneumonia.","Olive, David; Georges, Hugues; Devos, Patrick; Boussekey, Nicolas; Chiche, Arnaud; Meybeck, Agnes; Alfandari, Serge; Leroy, Olivier",BMC Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3065411/,0
712,Transmissibility and temporal changes of 2009 pH1N1 pandemic during summer and fall/winter waves,2011-12-02,"BACKGROUND: In order to compare the transmissibility of the 2009 pH1N1 pandemic during successive waves of infections in summer and fall/winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and to assess the temporal changes during the course of the outbreak in relation to the intervention measures implemented, we analyze the epidemiological patterns of the epidemic in Taiwan during July 2009-March 2010. METHODS: We utilize the multi-phase Richards model to fit the weekly cumulative pH1N1 epidemiological data (numbers of confirmed cases and hospitalizations) as well as the daily number of classes suspended under a unique ""325"" partial school closing policy in Taiwan, in order to pinpoint the turning points of the summer and fall/winter waves, and to estimate the reproduction numbers R for each wave. RESULTS: Our analysis indicates that the summer wave had slowed down by early September when schools reopened for fall. However, a second fall/winter wave began in late September, approximately 4 weeks after the school reopened, peaking at about 2-3 weeks after the start of the mass immunization campaign in November. R is estimated to be in the range of 1.04-1.27 for the first wave, and between 1.01-1.05 for the second wave. CONCLUSIONS: Transmissibility of the summer wave in Taiwan during July-early September, as measured by R, was lower than that of the earlier spring outbreak in North America and Europe, as well as that of the winter outbreak in Southern Hemisphere. Furthermore, transmissibility during fall/winter in Taiwan was noticeably lower than that of the summer, which is attributable to population-level immunity acquired from the earlier summer wave and also to the intervention measures that were implemented prior to and during the fall/winter wave.","Hsieh, Ying-Hen; Cheng, Kuang-Fu; Wu, Trong-Neng; Li, Tsai-Chung; Chen, Chiu-Ying; Chen, Jin-Hua; Lin, Mei-Hui",BMC Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3247203/,0
750,Soluble RAGE as a severity marker in community acquired pneumonia associated sepsis,2012-01-20,"BACKGROUND: Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is considered the most important cause of death from infectious disease in developed countries. Severity assessment scores partially address the difficulties in identifying high-risk patients. A lack of specific and valid pathophysiologic severity markers affect early and effective sepsis therapy. HMGB-1, sRAGE and RAGE have been involved in sepsis and their potential as severity markers has been proposed. The aim of this study was to evaluate HMGB-1, RAGE and sRAGE levels in patients with CAP-associated sepsis and determine their possible association with clinical outcome. METHOD: We evaluated 33 patients with CAP-associated sepsis admitted to the emergency room and followed in the medical wards. Severity assessment scores (CURB-65, PSI, APACHE II, SOFA) and serologic markers (HMGB-1, RAGE, sRAGE) were evaluated on admission. RESULTS: Thirty patients with a diagnosis of CAP-associated sepsis were enrolled in the study within 24 hours after admission. Fourteen (46.6%) had pandemic (H1N1) influenza A virus, 2 (6.6%) had seasonal influenza A and 14 other diagnoses. Of the patients in the study group, 16 (53.3%) had a fatal outcome. ARDS was observed in 17 (56.6%) and a total of 22 patients had severe sepsis on admission (73%). The SOFA score showed the greatest difference between surviving and non-surviving groups (P = .003) with similar results in ARDS patients (P = .005). sRAGE levels tended to be higher in non-surviving (P = .058) and ARDS patients (P = .058). Logistic regression modeling demonstrated that SOFA (P = .013) and sRAGE (P = .05) were the only variables that modified the probability of a fatal outcome. CONCLUSION: The association of elevated sRAGE with a fatal outcome suggests that it may have an independent causal effect in CAP. SOFA scores were the only clinical factor with the ability to identify surviving and ARDS patients.","Narvaez-Rivera, Rodrigo M; Rendon, Adrian; Salinas-Carmona, Mario C; Rosas-Taraco, Adrian G",BMC Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3274434/,0
1068,"Modeling the impact of air, sea, and land travel restrictions supplemented by other interventions on the emergence of a new influenza pandemic virus",2012-11-19,"BACKGROUND: During the early stages of a new influenza pandemic, travel restriction is an immediate and non-pharmaceutical means of retarding incidence growth. It extends the time frame of effective mitigation, especially when the characteristics of the emerging virus are unknown. In the present study, we used the 2009 influenza A pandemic as a case study to evaluate the impact of regulating air, sea, and land transport. Other government strategies, namely, antivirals and hospitalizations, were also evaluated. METHODS: Hong Kong arrivals from 44 countries via air, sea, and land transports were imported into a discrete stochastic Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious and Recovered (SEIR) host-flow model. The model allowed a number of latent and infectious cases to pass the border, which constitutes a source of local disease transmission. We also modeled antiviral and hospitalization prevention strategies to compare the effectiveness of these control measures. Baseline reproduction rate was estimated from routine surveillance data. RESULTS: Regarding air travel, the main route connected to the influenza source area should be targeted for travel restrictions; imposing a 99% air travel restriction delayed the epidemic peak by up to two weeks. Once the pandemic was established in China, the strong land connection between Hong Kong and China rendered Hong Kong vulnerable. Antivirals and hospitalization were found to be more effective on attack rate reductions than travel restrictions. Combined strategies (with 99% restriction on all transport modes) deferred the peak for long enough to establish a vaccination program. CONCLUSION: The findings will assist policy-makers with decisions on handling similar future pandemics. We also suggest regulating the extent of restriction and the transport mode, once restriction has been deemed necessary for pandemic control. Although travel restrictions have yet to gain social acceptance, they allow time for mitigation response when a new and highly intrusive virus emerges.","Chong, Ka Chun; Ying Zee, Benny Chung",BMC Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3577649/,0
1142,Low serum total nitrite and nitrate levels in severe leptospirosis,2013-05-06,"BACKGROUND: The relationship between inducible nitric oxide synthatase activity and disease severity in leptospirosis is unclear. Nitric oxide is converted to nitrites and nitrates, thus nitrite and nitrate levels (NO(x)) in serum are considered surrogate markers for nitric oxide. NO(x) are excreted through the kidneys, and elimination is diminished in renal impairment. We assessed the correlation of NO(x) with disease severity in patients with leptospirosis, compared with healthy controls and non-leptospirosis fever patients. METHODS: All patients admitted over a two-month period to the National Hospital, Colombo, Sri Lanka with a clinical picture suggestive of leptospirosis were included. Leptospirosis was confirmed by the microscopic agglutination test (titre≥400). Severe leptospirosis was defined by the presence of two or more of the following criteria: jaundice (bilirubin> 51.3 μmol/l), oliguria (urine output < 400 ml/day), serum creatinine> 133 μmol/l or blood urea > 25.5 mmol/l, or the presence of organ dysfunction. Non-leptospirosis fever patients and healthy volunteers were used as control groups. NO(x) levels were measured using a modified Griess reaction. RESULTS: Forty patients were confirmed as having leptospirosis and 26 of them had severe disease. NO(x) levels were significantly higher in confirmed leptospirosis patients compared to healthy controls, MAT equivocal patients and non-leptospirosis fever patients (p<0.001). NO(x) concentrations were also significantly higher in patients with severe compared to mild leptospirosis (p<0.001). Once NO(x) levels were corrected for renal function, by using the ratio NO(x)/creatinine, NO(x) levels were actually significantly lower in patients with severe disease compared to other patients, and values were similar to those of healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: We postulate that high NOx levels may be protective against severe leptospirosis, and that finding low NOx levels (when corrected for renal function) in patients with leptospirosis may predict the development of severe disease and organ dysfunction.","Kalugalage, Thilini; Rodrigo, Chaturaka; Vithanage, Thamal; Somaratne, Pranitha; De Silva, H Janaka; Handunnetti, Shiroma; Rajapakse, Senaka",BMC Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3651868/,0
1349,Tuberculosis mortality: patient characteristics and causes,2014-01-03,"BACKGROUND: In the antibiotic era, tuberculosis (TB) still causes a substantial number of mortalities. We aimed to identify the causes and risks of death among TB patients. METHODS: Medical records of mortality cases of culture-proven TB diagnosed during 2003–2007 were reviewed. All TB deaths were classified into 2 groups (TB-related and non-TB-related), based on the underlying cause of death. RESULTS: During the study period, 2016 cases (male: 71.1%) of culture-proven TB were identified. The mean age was 59.3 (range: 0.3–96) years. The overall mortality rate was 12.3% (249 cases) and the mean age at death was 74 years; 17.3% (43 cases) of all TB deaths were TB-related. Most of the TB-related deaths occurred early (median survival: 20 days), and the patient died of septic shock. Malignancy, liver cirrhosis, renal failure, and miliary and pneumonic radiographic patterns were all independent predictors for all TB deaths. Cavitary, miliary and pneumonic radiographic patterns were all significant predictive factors for TB-related death. Extrapulmonary involvement and liver cirrhosis were also factors contributing to TB-related death. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of TB deaths were ascribed to non-TB-related causes. Managing TB as well as underlying comorbidities in a multidisciplinary approach is essential to improve the outcome of patients in an aging population. However, the clinical manifestations of patients with TB-related death vary; many progressed to fulminant septic shock requiring timely recognition with prompt treatment to prevent early death.","Lin, Chou-Han; Lin, Chou-Jui; Kuo, Yao-Wen; Wang, Jann-Yuan; Hsu, Chia-Lin; Chen, Jong-Min; Cheng, Wern-Cherng; Lee, Li-Na",BMC Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3890594/,0
1657,Use of simple clinical and laboratory predictors to differentiate influenza from dengue and other febrile illnesses in the emergency room,2014-11-25,"BACKGROUND: Clinical differentiation of influenza from dengue and other febrile illnesses (OFI) is difficult, and available rapid diagnostic tests have limited sensitivity. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study to compare clinical and laboratory findings between (i) influenza and dengue and (ii) influenza and OFI. RESULTS: Of 849 enrolled patients, the mean time between illness onset and hospital presentation was 1.7, 3.7, and 3 days for influenza, dengue, and OFI, respectively. Among pediatric patients (≤18 years) (445 influenza, 24 dengue, and 130 OFI), we identified absence of rashes, no leukopenia, and no marked thrombocytopenia (platelet counts <100 × 10(9) cells/L) as predictors to distinguish influenza from dengue, whereas rhinorrhea, malaise, sore throat, and mild thrombocytopenia (platelet counts 100-149 × 10(9)/L) were predictors that differentiated influenza from OFI. Among adults (>18 years) (81 influenza, 124 dengue, and 45 OFI), no leukopenia and no marked thrombocytopenia distinguished influenza from dengue, while rhinorrhea and malaise differentiated influenza from OFI. A diagnostic algorithm developed to distinguish influenza from dengue using rash, leukopenia, and marked thrombocytopenia showed >90% sensitivity to identify influenza in pediatric patients. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified simple clinical and laboratory parameters that can assist clinicians to distinguish influenza from dengue and OFI. These findings may help clinicians diagnose influenza and facilitate appropriate management of affected patients, particularly in resource-poor settings.

2032,Tracking social contact networks with online respondent-driven detection: who recruits whom?,2015-11-14,"BACKGROUND: Transmission of respiratory pathogens in a population depends on the contact network patterns of individuals. To accurately understand and explain epidemic behaviour information on contact networks is required, but only limited empirical data is available. Online respondent-driven detection can provide relevant epidemiological data on numbers of contact persons and dynamics of contacts between pairs of individuals. We aimed to analyse contact networks with respect to sociodemographic and geographical characteristics, vaccine-induced immunity and self-reported symptoms. METHODS: In 2014, volunteers from two large participatory surveillance panels in the Netherlands and Belgium were invited for a survey. Participants were asked to record numbers of contacts at different locations and self-reported influenza-like-illness symptoms, and to invite 4 individuals they had met face to face in the preceding 2 weeks. We calculated correlations between linked individuals to investigate mixing patterns. RESULTS: In total 1560 individuals completed the survey who reported in total 30591 contact persons; 488 recruiter-recruit pairs were analysed. Recruitment was assortative by age, education, household size, influenza vaccination status and sentiments, indicating that participants tended to recruit contact persons similar to themselves. We also found assortative recruitment by symptoms, reaffirming our objective of sampling contact persons whom a participant may infect or by whom a participant may get infected in case of an outbreak. Recruitment was random by sex and numbers of contact persons. Relationships between pairs were influenced by the spatial distribution of peer recruitment. CONCLUSIONS: Although complex mechanisms influence online peer recruitment, the observed statistical relationships reflected the observed contact network patterns in the general population relevant for the transmission of respiratory pathogens. This provides useful and innovative input for predictive epidemic models relying on network information.

2691,Pulmonary strongyloidiasis: assessment between manifestation and radiological findings in 16 severe strongyloidiasis cases,2017-05-02,"BACKGROUND: Strongyloidiasis is a chronic parasitic infection caused by Strongyloides stercoralis. Severe cases such as, hyperinfection syndrome (HS) and disseminated strongyloidiasis (DS), can involve pulmonary manifestations. These manifestations frequently aid the diagnosis of strongyloidiasis. Here, we present the pulmonary manifestations and radiological findings of severe strongyloidiasis. METHODS: From January 2004 to December 2014, all patients diagnosed with severe strongyloidiasis at the University of the Ryukyus Hospital or affiliated hospitals in Okinawa, Japan, were included in this retrospective study. All diagnoses were confirmed by the microscopic or histopathological identification of larvae. Severe strongyloidiasis was defined by the presence of any of the following: 1) the identification of S. stercoralis from extra gastrointestinal specimens, 2) sepsis, 3) meningitis, 4) acute respiratory failure, or 5) respiratory tract hemorrhage. Patients were assigned to either HS or DS. Medical records were further reviewed to extract related clinical features and radiological findings. RESULTS: Sixteen severe strongyloidiasis cases were included. Of those, fifteen cases had pulmonary manifestations, eight had acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (53%), seven had enteric bacterial pneumonia (46%) and five had pulmonary hemorrhage (33%). Acute respiratory failure was a common indicator for pulmonary manifestation (87%). Chest X-ray findings frequently showed diffuse shadows (71%). Additionally, ileum gas was detected for ten of the sixteen cases in the upper abdomen during assessment with chest X-ray. While, chest CT findings frequently showed ground-glass opacity (GGO) in 89% of patients. Interlobular septal thickening was also frequently shown (67%), always accompanying GGO in upper lobes. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, our study described HS/DS cases with pulmonary manifestations including, ARDS, bacterial pneumonia and pulmonary hemorrhage. Chest X-ray findings in HS/DS cases frequently showed diffuse shadows, and the combination of GGO and interlobular septal thickening in chest CT was common in HS/DS, regardless of accompanying pulmonary manifestations. This CT finding suggests alveolar hemorrhage could be used as a potential marker indicating the transition from latent to symptomatic state. Respiratory specimens are especially useful for detecting larvae in cases of HS/DS.","Nabeya, Daijiro; Haranaga, Shusaku; Parrott, Gretchen Lynn; Kinjo, Takeshi; Nahar, Saifun; Tanaka, Teruhisa; Hirata, Tetsuo; Hokama, Akira; Tateyama, Masao; Fujita, Jiro",BMC Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5414214/,0
3027,Case report: a fatal case of disseminated adenovirus infection in a non-transplant adult haematology patient,2018-01-27,"BACKGROUND: We report a fatal case of disseminated adenovirus infection in a non-transplant haematology adult patient with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia who had completed combination chemoimmunotherapy a few months before developing respiratory symptoms. In such non-transplant patients, monitoring for adenovirus in the blood is not routine. However, with adenoviruses, when there is a more peripheral (i.e. non-blood) site of infection such as the chest, serial adenovirus monitoring in blood for the duration of that illness may be warranted. CASE PRESENTATION: This case started with an initial bacterial chest infection that responded to treatment, followed by an adenovirus pneumonitis that disseminated to his blood a week later with levels of up to 92 million adenovirus DNA copies/ml. Despite prompt treatment with cidofovir, his respiratory function continued to deteriorate over the next two weeks and he was moved to intensive care. Intravenous immunoglobulin and ribavirin were subsequently added to his treatment. However, he died soon after this with a final adenovirus load of 20 million copies/ml in his blood. CONCLUSIONS: We recommend that even in non-transplant haematology patients, where such patients present with an acute respiratory adenovirus infection, teams should consider checking the blood for adenovirus to check for signs of disseminated infection. The earlier this can be tested, the earlier treatment can be initiated (if adenovirus positive), which may produce more successful clinical outcomes.","Joffe, Michael; Wagner, Simon D.; Tang, Julian W.",BMC Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5787257/,0
3262,Tuberculous pneumonia-induced severe ARDS complicated with DIC in a female child: a case of successful treatment,2018-07-03,"BACKGROUND: Tuberculous (TB) pneumonia can induce acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Although TB pneumonia is one of the causes of disease and death among children worldwide, the literature on TB pneumonia-induced ARDS is limited. We report herein on the successful treatment of a two-year-old female child with TB pneumonia-induced severe ARDS complicated with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). CASE PRESENTATION: A two-year-old Vietnamese female child with sustained fever and cough for 20 days was transferred to our hospital. She had severe dyspnea and a chest X-ray showed bilateral infiltration without findings of heart failure. After tracheal intubation, her oxygenation index (OI) and PaO(2)/FiO(2) (PF) ratio were 29 and 60 mmHg, respectively. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction (rPCR) assay of tracheal lavage fluid. She was diagnosed as having severe ARDS that developed from TB pneumonia. Anti-tuberculous therapy and cardiopulmonary support were started. However, her respiratory condition deteriorated despite treatment with high-frequency oscillating ventilation (HFO), vasopressor support, and 1 g/kg of immunoglobulin. On the third day after admission, her International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis DIC score had increased to 5. Recombinant human soluble thrombomodulin (rTM) was administered to treat the DIC. After the administration of rTM was completed, OI gradually decreased, after which the mechanical ventilation mode was changed from HFO to synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation. The DIC score also gradually decreased. Plasma levels of soluble receptor for advanced glycan end products (sRAGE) and high mobility group box 1 (HMGB-1), which are reported to be associated with ARDS severity, also decreased. In addition, inflammatory biomarkers, including interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), decreased after the administration of rTM. Although severe ARDS (P/F ratio ≦ 100 mmHg) continued for 19 days, the patient’s OI and P/F ratio improved gradually, and she was extubated on the 27th day after admission. The severe ARDS with DIC was successfully treated, and she was discharged from hospital on day 33 post-admission. CONCLUSIONS: We successfully treated a female child suffering from TB pneumonia-induced severe ARDS complicated with DIC using multimodal interventions.

3556,Muscle weakness associated with H7N9 infection: report of two cases,2018-12-20,"BACKGROUND: The emerging avian influenza A (H7N9) virus, a subtype of influenza viruses, was first discovered in March 2013 in China. Infected patients frequently present with pneumonia and acute respiratory disorder syndrome with high rates of intensive care unit admission and death. Neurological complications, such as Guillain–Barré syndrome(GBS), and intensive care unit-acquired weakness, including critical illness polyneuropathy and myopathy, have only rarely been reported previously. CASE PRESENTATION: In this study, we report on two Chinese patients with H7N9 severe pneumonia presenting neurological complications. These two patients had non-immune diseases prior to the onset of virus infection. A 56-year-old female patient (case 1) and a 78-year-old female patient (case 2) were admitted because of fever, cough, chest tightness and shortness of breath. These patients were confirmed to have H7N9 infection soon after admission followed by the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome and various severe bacterial and fungal infections. The case 1 patient was found to have muscle weakness in all extremities after withdrawing the mechanical ventilator, and the case 2 patient was found when withdrawing extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, both of these conditions prolonged ventilator-weaning time. Furthermore, the case 1 patient carried the H7N9 virus for a prolonged period, reaching 28 days, and both of them stayed in the hospital for more than two months. A clinical diagnosis of intensive care unit-acquired weakness could be confirmed. However, based on results from electrophysiological testing and needle electromyography of these 2 patients, it is difficult to differentiate critical illness polyneuropathy from GBS, since no lumbar puncture or muscle and nerve biopsy were conducted during hospitalization. Following a long-term comprehensive treatment, the patients’ neurological condition improved gradually. CONCLUSIONS: Although there is great improvement in saving severe patients’ lives from fatal respiratory and blood infections, it is necessary to pay sufficient attention and to use more methods to differentiate GBS from intensive care unit-acquired weakness. This unusual neurological complication could result in additional complications including ventilator associated pneumonia, prolonged hospital stay and then would further increase the death rate, and huge costs.","Jin, Chao-Nan; Tang, Ling-Ling",BMC Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6302428/,0
3952,Plasma and tissue angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 activity and plasma equilibrium concentrations of angiotensin peptides in dogs with heart disease,2019-06-28,"BACKGROUND: Angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a homologue of angiotensin‐converting enzyme (ACE) and produces angiotensin peptides (APs), such as angiotensin 1‐9 and 1‐7 that are vasodilatory and natriuretic, and act to counterbalance angiotensin II. HYPOTHESIS: Evidence of ACE2 can be found in tissues and plasma of dogs. Equilibrium concentrations of renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) APs differ in dogs with heart disease compared to healthy dogs and recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) alters relative concentrations of APs. ANIMALS: Forty‐nine dogs with and 34 dogs without heart disease. METHODS: Immunohistochemistry and assays for tissue and plasma ACE2 activity and equilibrium concentrations of plasma RAAS APs were performed. RESULTS: Immunolabeling for ACE2 was present in kidney and myocardial tissue. Median plasma ACE2 activity was significantly increased in dogs with congestive heart failure (CHF; 6.9 mU/mg; interquartile range [IQR], 5.1‐12.1) as compared to control (2.2 mU/mg; IQR, 1.8‐3.0; P = .0003). Plasma equilibrium analysis of RAAS APs identified significant increases in the median concentrations of beneficial APs, such as angiotensin 1‐7, in dogs with CHF (486.7 pg/mL; IQR, 214.2‐1168) as compared to those with preclinical disease (41.0 pg/mL; IQR, 27.4‐45.1; P < .0001) or control (11.4 pg/mL; IQR, 7.1‐25.3; P = .01). Incubation of plasma samples from dogs with CHF with rhACE2 increased beneficial APs, such as angiotensin 1‐9 (preincubation, 10.3 pg/mL; IQR, 4.4‐37.2; postincubation, 2431 pg/mL; IQR, 1355‐3037; P = .02), while simultaneously decreasing maladaptive APs, such as angiotensin II (preincubation, 53.4 pg/mL; IQR, 28.6‐226.4; postincubation, 2.4 pg/mL; IQR, 0.50‐5.8; P = .02). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Recognition of the ACE2 system expands the conventional view of the RAAS in the dog and represents an important potential therapeutic target.","Larouche‐Lebel, Éva; Loughran, Kerry A.; Oyama, Mark A.; Solter, Phil F.; Laughlin, Danielle S.; Sánchez, Melissa D.; Assenmacher, Charles‐Antoine; Fox, Philip R.; Fries, Ryan C.",J Vet Intern Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6639469/,0
3974,Successful management of refractory respiratory failure caused by avian influenza H7N9 and secondary organizing pneumonia: a case report and literature review,2019-07-29,"BACKGROUD: Organizing pneumonia (OP) is a rare complication of influenza infection that has substantial morbidity. We report the first case of OP associated with avian influenza H7N9 infection that had significant improvement with corticosteroid treatment. CASE PRESENTATION: A 35-year-old male admitted to intensive care unit because of respiratory failure. He was diagnosed as severe pneumonia caused by avian influenza H7N9 viral infection. After initial clinical improvement supported by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), the patient’s condition worsened with persistent fever, refractory hypoxemia. Chest x-rays and computed tomographies showed areas of consolidation and ground glass opacification. Although OP was suspected and 1 mg/kg methylprednisolone was used, the patient’s condition didn’t improved considerably. An open lung biopsy was performed, and histopathological examination of the specimen was compatible with OP. The patient was treated with methylprednisolone 1.5 mg/kg for 5 days. ECMO was weaned on day 15, and he was discharged on day 71 with good lung recovery. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this was the first case of successful management of refractory severe respiratory failure caused by avian influenza H7N9 infection complicated with OP. Refractory hypoxia with clinical manifestation and radiological findings compatible with OP, a differential diagnosis should be considered among patients at the second or third week of influenza H7N9 infection, especially in patients with clinical condition deteriorated after the primary influenza pneumonia was controlled. And a steroid dose of methylprednisolone 1.5 mg/kg may be suggested for treatment of OP associated with avian influenza H7N9 infection.","He, Hangyong; Wang, Hao; Li, Xuyan; Tang, Xiao; Sun, Bing; Tong, Zhaohui",BMC Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6664529/,0
4121,Pertussis hospitalizations among term and preterm infants: clinical course and vaccine effectiveness,2019-10-29,"BACKGROUND: Pertussis causes severe disease in young unvaccinated infants, with preterms potentially at highest risk. We studied pertussis in hospitalized infants as related to gestational age (GA) and vaccination history. METHODS: Medical record data of 0-2y old patients hospitalized for pertussis during 2005–2014 were linked to vaccination data. Multivariable logistic regression was used to study the association between GA and vaccination history on the clinical disease course. We compared vaccine effectiveness (VE) against hospitalization for pertussis between term and preterm infants (i.e., <37w GA) using the screening method as developed by Farrington. RESULTS: Of 1187 records, medical data from 676 were retrieved. Of these, 12% concerned preterms, whereas they are 8% of Dutch birth cohorts. Median age at admission was 3 m for preterms and 2 m for terms (p < 0.001). Preterms more often had received pertussis vaccination (62% vs 44%; p = 0.01) and more often had coinfections (37% vs 21%; p = 0.01). Preterms tended more often to have complications, to require artificial respiration or to need admittance to the intensive care unit (ICU). Preterms had longer ICU stays (15d vs 9d; p = 0.004). Vaccinated preterms and terms had a lower median length of hospital stay and lower crude risks of apneas and the need for artificial respiration, additional oxygen, and ICU admittance than those not vaccinated. After adjustment for presence of coinfections and age at admittance, these differences were not significant, except the lower need of oxygen treatment in vaccinated terms. Effectiveness of the first vaccination against pertussis hospitalizations was 95% (95% CI 93–96%) and 73% (95% CI 20–91%) in terms and preterms, respectively. Effectiveness of the second dose of the primary vaccination series was comparable in both groups (86 and 99%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Infants hospitalized for pertussis suffer from severe disease. Preterms were overrepresented, with higher need for intensive treatment and less VE of first vaccination. These findings stress the need for alternative prevention, in particular prenatal vaccination of mothers, to reduce pertussis in both groups.","van der Maas, Nicoline A. T.; Sanders, Elisabeth A.

4408,"Hospital-acquired influenza infections detected by a surveillance system over six seasons, from 2010/2011 to 2015/2016",2020-01-28,"BACKGROUND: In addition to outbreaks of nosocomial influenza, sporadic nosocomial influenza infections also occur but are generally not reported in the literature. This study aimed to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of cases of nosocomial influenza compared with the remaining severe cases of severe influenza in acute hospitals in Catalonia (Spain) which were identified by surveillance. METHODS: An observational case-case epidemiological study was carried out in patients aged ≥18 years from Catalan 12 hospitals between 2010 and 2016. For each laboratory-confirmed influenza case (nosocomial or not) we collected demographic, virological and clinical characteristics. We defined patients with nosocomial influenza as those admitted to a hospital for a reason other than acute respiratory infection in whom ILI symptoms developed ≥48 h after admission and influenza virus infection was confirmed using RT-PCR. Mixed-effects regression was used to estimate the crude and adjusted OR. RESULTS: One thousand seven hundred twenty-two hospitalized patients with severe laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infection were included: 96 (5.6%) were classified as nosocomial influenza and more frequently had > 14 days of hospital stay (42.7% vs. 27.7%, P < .001) and higher mortality (18.8% vs. 12.6%, P < .02). The variables associated with nosocomial influenza cases in acute-care hospital settings were chronic renal disease (aOR 2.44 95% CI 1.44–4.15) and immunodeficiency (aOR 1.79 95% CI 1.04–3.06). CONCLUSIONS: Nosocomial infections are a recurring problem associated with high rates of chronic diseases and death. These findings underline the need for adherence to infection control guidelines.","Godoy, P.; Torner, N.; Soldevila, N.; Rius, C.; Jane, M.; Martínez, A.; Caylà, JA.; Domínguez, A.",BMC Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6988218/,0
4562,Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium pneumonia in a uremic patient on hemodialysis: a case report and review of the literature,2020-02-22,"BACKGROUND: Respiratory tract infection (RTI) in young children is a leading cause of morbidity and hospitalization worldwide. There are few studies assessing the performance for bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) versus oropharyngeal swab (OPS) specimens in microbiological findings for children with RTI. The primary purpose of this study was to compare the detection rates of OPS and paired BALF in detecting key respiratory pathogens using suspension microarray. METHODS: We collected paired OPS and BALF specimens from 76 hospitalized children with respiratory illness. The samples were tested simultaneously for 8 respiratory viruses and 5 bacteria by suspension microarray. RESULTS: Of 76 paired specimens, 62 patients (81.6%) had at least one pathogen. BALF and OPS identified respiratory pathogen infections in 57 (75%) and 49 (64.5%) patients, respectively (P > 0.05). The etiology analysis revealed that viruses were responsible for 53.7% of the patients, whereas bacteria accounted for 32.9% and Mycoplasma pneumoniae for 13.4%. The leading 5 pathogens identified were respiratory syncytial virus, Streptococcus pneumoniaee, Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and adenovirus, and they accounted for 74.2% of etiological fraction. For detection of any pathogen, the overall detection rate of BALF (81%) was marginally higher than that (69%) of OPS (p = 0.046). The differences in the frequency distribution and sensitivity for most pathogens detected by two sampling methods were not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, BALF and OPS had similar microbiological yields. Our results indicated the clinical value of OPS testing in pediatric patients with respiratory illness.","Ma, Zhan-Ying; Deng, Hua; Hua, Li-Dong; Lei, Wen; Zhang, Chang-Bin; Dai, Qi-Qiang; Tao, Wei-Jing; Zhang, Liang",BMC Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7036252/,0

However, IFN-λ displays unique traits that delineate them as primary protectors of barrier integrity at mucosal sites. This unique role stems both from the restricted expression of IFN-λ receptor, confined to epithelial cells and to a limited pool of immune cells, and from unique immunomodulatory properties of IFN-λ. Here, we discuss recent findings that establish the unique capacity of IFN-λ to act at the barriers of the host to balance tissue tolerance and immune resistance against viral and bacterial challenges.","Broggi, Achille; Granucci, Francesca; Zanoni, Ivan",J Exp Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7037241/,0
4638,Scalp eschar and neck lymphadenopathy after tick bite (SENLAT) caused by Bartonella henselae in Korea: a case report,2020-03-12,"PURPOSE: To examine the time to drug administration in patients with a witnessed cardiac arrest enrolled in the Pre-Hospital Assessment of the Role of Adrenaline: Measuring the Effectiveness of Drug Administration in Cardiac Arrest (PARAMEDIC2) randomised controlled trial. METHODS: The PARAMEDIC2 trial was undertaken across 5 NHS ambulance services in England and Wales with randomisation between December 2014 and October 2017. Patients with an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest who were unresponsive to initial resuscitation attempts were randomly assigned to 1 mg intravenous adrenaline or matching placebo according to treatment packs that were identical apart from treatment number. Participants and study staff were masked to treatment allocation. RESULTS: 8016 patients were enrolled, 4902 sustained a witnessed cardiac arrest of whom 2437 received placebo and 2465 received adrenaline. The odds of return of spontaneous circulation decreased in both groups over time but at a greater rate in the placebo arm odds ratio (OR) 0.93 (95% CI 0.92–0.95) compared with the adrenaline arm OR 0.96 (95% CI 0.95–0.97); interaction OR: 1.03, 95% CI 1.01–1.05, p = 0.005. By contrast, although the rate of survival and favourable neurological outcome decreased as time to treatment increased, the rates did not differ between the adrenaline and placebo groups. CONCLUSION: The rate of return of spontaneous circulation, survival and favourable neurological outcomes decrease over time. As time to drug treatment increases, adrenaline increases the chances of return of spontaneous circulation. Longer term outcomes were not affected by the time to adrenaline administration.

4809,Unusual accumulation of a wide array of antimicrobial resistance mechanisms in a patient with cytomegalovirus-associated hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis: a case report,2020-03-20,"BACKGROUND: A noticeable interest in ketamine infusion for sedation management has developed among critical care physicians for critically ill patients. The 2018 Pain, Agitation/sedation, Delirium, Immobility, and Sleep disruption guideline suggested low-dose ketamine infusion as an adjunct to opioid therapy to reduce opioid requirements in post-surgical patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). This was, however, rated as conditional due to the very low quality of evidence. Ketamine has favorable characteristics, making it an especially viable alternative for patients with respiratory and hemodynamic instability. The Analgo-sedative adjuncT keTAmine Infusion iN Mechanically vENTilated ICU patients (ATTAINMENT) trial aims to assess the effect and safety of adjunct low-dose continuous infusion of ketamine as an analgo-sedative compared to standard of care in critically ill patients on mechanical ventilation (MV) for ≥ 24 h. METHODS/DESIGN: This trial is a prospective, randomized, active controlled, open-label, pilot, feasibility study of adult ICU patients (> 14 years old) on MV. The study will take place in the adult ICUs in the King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center (KFSH&RC), Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, and will enroll 80 patients. Patients will be randomized post-intubation into two groups: the intervention group will receive an adjunct low-dose continuous infusion of ketamine plus standard of care. Ketamine will be administered over a period of 48 h at a fixed infusion rate of 2 μg/kg/min (0.12 mg/kg/h) in the first 24 h followed by 1 μg/kg/min (0.06 mg/kg/h) in the second 24 h. The control group will receive standard of care in the ICU (propofol and/or fentanyl and/or midazolam) according to the KFSH&RC sedation and analgesia protocol as clinically appropriate. The primary outcome is MV duration until ICU discharge, death, extubation, or 28 days post-randomization, whichever comes first. DISCUSSION: The first patient was enrolled on 1 September 2019. As of 10 October 2019, a total of 16 patients had been enrolled. We expect to complete the recruitment by 31 December 2020. The findings of this pilot trial will likely justify further investigation for the role of adjunct low-dose ketamine infusion as an analgo-sedative agent in a larger, multicenter, randomized controlled trial.

4811,Influenza in the school-aged population in Mexico: burden of disease and cost-effectiveness of vaccination in children,2020-03-20,"A. ACUTE HYPERCAPNIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE A1. Acute Exacerbation of COPD: Recommendations: NIV should be used in management of acute exacerbation of COPD in patients with acute or acute-on-chronic respiratory acidosis (pH = 7.25-7.35). (1A) NIV should be attempted in patients with acute exacerbation of COPD (pH <7.25 & PaCO2 ≥ 45) before initiating invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) except in patients requiring immediate intubation. (2A). Lower the pH higher the chance of failure of NIV. (2B) NIV should not to be used routinely in normo- or mildly hyper-capneic patients with acute exacerbation of COPD, without acidosis (pH > 7.35). (2B) A2. NIV in ARF due to Chest wall deformities/Neuromuscular diseases: Recommendations: NIV may be used in patients of ARF due to chest wall deformity/Neuromuscular diseases. (PaCO2 ≥ 45) (UPP) A3. NIV in ARF due to Obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS): Recommendations: NIV may be used in AHRF in OHS patients when they present with acute hypercapnic or acute on chronic respiratory failure (pH 45). (3B) NIV/CPAP may be used in obese, hypercapnic patients with OHS and/or right heart failure in the absence of acidosis. (UPP) B. NIV IN ACUTE HYPOXEMIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: B1. NIV in Acute Cardiogenic Pulmonary Oedema: Recommendations: NIV is recommended in hospital patients with ARF, due to Cardiogenic pulmonary edema. (1A). NIV should be used in patients with acute heart failure/ cardiogenic pulmonary edema, right from emergency department itself. (1B) Both CPAP and BiPAP modes are safe and effective in patients with cardiogenic pulmonary edema. (1A). However, BPAP (NIV-PS) should be preferred in cardiogenic pulmonary edema with hypercapnia. (3A) B2. NIV in acute hypoxemic respiratory failure: Recommendations: NIV may be used over conventional oxygen therapy in mild early acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (P/F ratio <300 and >200 mmHg), under close supervision. (2B) We strongly recommend against a trial of NIV in patients with acute hypoxemic failure with P/F ratio <150. (2A) B3. NIV in ARF due to Chest Trauma: Recommendations: NIV may be used in traumatic flail chest along with adequate pain relief. (3B) B4. NIV in Immunocompromised Host: Recommendations: In Immunocompromised patients with early ARF, we may consider NIV over conventional oxygen. (2B). B5. NIV in Palliative Care: Recommendations: We strongly recommend use of NIV for reducing dyspnea in palliative care setting. (2A) B6. NIV in post-operative cases: Recommendations: NIV should be used in patients with post-operative acute respiratory failure. (2A) B6a. NIV in abdominal surgery: Recommendations: NIV may be used in patients with ARF following abdominal surgeries. (2A) B6b. NIV in bariatric surgery: Recommendations: NIV may be used in post-bariatric surgery patients with pre-existent OSA or OHS. (3A) B6c. NIV in Thoracic surgery: Recommendations: In cardiothoracic surgeries, use of NIV is recommended post operatively for acute respiratory failure to improve oxygenation and reduce chance of reintubation. (2A) NIV should not be used in patients undergoing esophageal surgery. (UPP) B6d. NIV in post lung transplant: Recommendations: NIV may be used for shortening weaning time and to avoid re-intubation following lung transplantation. (2B) B7. NIV during Procedures (ETI/Bronchoscopy/TEE/Endoscopy): Recommendations: NIV may be used for pre-oxygenation before intubation. (2B) NIV with appropriate interface may be used in patients of ARF during Bronchoscopy/Endoscopy to improve oxygenation. (3B) B8. NIV in Viral Pneumonitis ARDS: Recommendations: NIV cannot be considered as a treatment of choice for patients with acute respiratory failure with H1N1 pneumonia. However, it may be reasonable to use NIV in selected patients with single organ involvement, in a strictly controlled environment with close monitoring. (2B) B9. NIV and Acute exacerbation of Pulmonary Tuberculosis: Recommendations: Careful use of NIV in patients with acute Tuberculosis may be considered, with effective infection control precautions to prevent air-borne transmission. (3B) B10. NIV after planned extubation in high risk patients: Recommendation: We recommend that NIV may be used to wean high risk patients from invasive mechanical ventilation as it reduces re-intubation rate. (2B) B11. NIV for respiratory distress post extubation: Recommendations: We recommend that NIV therapy should not be used to manage respiratory distress post-extubation in high risk patients. (2B) C. APPLICATION OF NIV: Recommendation: Choice of mode should be mainly decided by factors like disease etiology and severity, the breathing effort by the patient and the operator familiarity and experience. (UPP) We suggest using flow trigger over pressure triggering in assisted modes, as it provides better patient ventilator synchrony. Especially in COPD patients, flow triggering has been found to benefit auto PEEP. (3B) D. MANAGEMENT OF PATIENT ON NIV: D1. Sedation: Recommendations: A non-pharmacological approach to calm the patient (Reassuring the patient, proper environment) should always be tried before administrating sedatives. (UPP) In patients on NIV, sedation may be used with extremely close monitoring and only in an ICU setting with lookout for signs of NIV failure. (UPP) E. EQUIPMENT: Recommendations: We recommend that portable bilevel ventilators or specifically designed ICU ventilators with non-invasive mode should be used for delivering Non–invasive ventilation in critically ill patients. (UPP) Both critical care ventilators with leak compensation and bi-level ventilators have been equally effective in decreasing the WOB, RR, and PaCO2. (3B) Currently, Oronasal mask is the most preferred interface for non-invasive ventilation for acute respiratory failure. (3B) F. WEANING: Recommendations: We recommend that weaning from NIV may be done by a standardized protocol driven approach of the unit.

Six of the 29 donors were HLA-phenotypically identical and two were mismatched relatives, 13 were mismatched siblings and eight were mismatched parents. Six patients received no antigen (relatives), 15 patients one antigen, five patients two antigen and three patients three antigen disparate grafts. Twenty-three patients were in class 2 or class 3, whereas six patients were in class 1. Thirteen patients were given BUCY, nine patients BUCY plus ALG, six patients BUCY plus TBI or TLI and one patient BUCY with prior cytoreductive-immunosuppressive treatment as conditioning. As GVHD prophylaxis four patients received MTX, 22 CsA + MTX + methylprednisolone (MP) and three patients CsA + MP. Thirteen of 29 patients (44.8%) had sustained engraftment. The probability of graft failure or rejection was 55%. There were no significant differences between antigen disparities and graft failure. The incidence of grade II–IV acute GVHD was 47.3% and chronic GVHD was 37.5%. The incidence of acute GVHD was higher in patients receiving one or two antigen disparate in the GVHD direction grafts (vs no antigen) (P EQ 0.04; odds ratio 10.8; 95% CI 1.5–115). The probability of overall and event-free survival was 65% and 21%, respectively, with median follow-up of 7.5 years (range 0.6–17 years) for surviving patients. The degree of HLA disparity between patient and donor did not have a significant effect on survival. The incidence of nonhematologic toxicity was low. Transplant-related mortality was 34%. GVHD (acute or chronic) was a major contributing cause of death (50%) followed by infections (30%). We conclude that at present, due to high graft failure and GVHD rates, BMT from alternative donors should be restricted to patients who have poor life expectancies because they cannot receive adequate conventional treatment or because of alloimmunization to minor blood antigens.

7230,2019 novel coronavirus is undergoing active recombination,2020-03-04,"Background: We have previously shown that human mRNAs are present in saliva and can be used as biomarkers of oral cancer. In this study, we analyzed the integrity, sources, and stability of salivary RNA. Methods: We measured the integrity of salivary RNA with reverse transcription followed by PCR (RT-PCR) or RT-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). To study RNA entry sites into the oral cavity, we used RT-PCR analysis of salivary RNA from the 3 major salivary glands, gingival crevice fluid, and desquamated oral epithelial cells. We measured stability of the salivary β-actin mRNA by RT-qPCR of salivary RNA incubated at room temperature for different periods of time. We measured RNA association with other macromolecules by filtering saliva through pores of different sizes before performing RT-qPCR. To assess RNA–macromolecule interaction, we incubated saliva with Triton X-100 for different periods of time before performing RT-qPCR. Results: In most cases, we detected partial- to full-length salivary mRNAs and smaller amounts of middle and 3′ gene amplicons compared with the 5′. RNA was present in all oral fluids examined. Endogenous salivary β-actin mRNA degraded more slowly than exogenous β-actin mRNA, with half-lives of 12.2 and 0.4 min, respectively (P <0.001). Salivary RNA could not pass through 0.22 or 0.45 μm pores. Incubation of saliva with Triton X-100 accelerated degradation of salivary RNA. Conclusions: Saliva harbors both full-length and partially degraded forms of mRNA. RNA enters the oral cavity from different sources, and association with macromolecules may protect salivary RNA from degradation.","Park, Noh Jin; Li, Yang; Yu, Tianwei; Brinkman, Brigitta MN; Wong, David T",Clin Chem,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7108156/,0

We tested DNAs from cagA positive patients HP isolates; a total of 74 patients with chronic gastritis (CG, N = 37), intestinal metaplasia (IM, N = 21) or gastric cancer (GC, N = 16) from Mexico and Colombia.

Using a sensitive dissociation–enhanced lanthanide fluoroimmunoassay (DELFIA), IFN–α/β was detected in blood at 8 and 24 h after injection of ADV–infected cells. In parallel, by means of in situ hybridization, IFN–α/β mRNA containing cells were demonstrated in regional lymph nodes. Occasional IFN–α/β mRNA positive cells were also seen in injected dermal areas, but not in contralateral lymph nodes, spleen, bone marrow, blood or liver. The ability of leucocytes in whole blood cultures to produce IFN–α/β upon stimulation by ADV was markedly diminished 3–7 days after intradermal injection of ADV–infected cells. In contrast, cultures of purified peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) had intact IFN–α/β responses. Further, serum from ADV–injected pigs inhibited the in vitro ADV–induced IFN‐α/β responses in PBMC from control pigs, most likely due to the demonstrated presence of anti–ADV antibodies. We suggest that the IFN‐α/β producing cells in lymph nodes may participate in the development of antiviral immunity and could be equivalent to Natural IFN–α/β producing (NIP) cells.","ARTURSSON, K.; LINDERSSON, M.; VARELA, N.; SCHEYNIUS, A.; ALM, G.

One such countermeasure—the transfusion of pandemic influenza‐specific antibodies from surviving patients to the clinically ill—is the focus of this commentary. Passive immunotherapy, which includes the use of monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs), hyperimmune globulin, or convalescent plasma, had been used before the advent of antibiotics and has recently reentered the limelight due to the accelerating development of MoAb therapies against cancer, a number of microbes, allograft rejection, and a host of other conditions. After the plausible biologic mechanism and somewhat limited data supporting the efficacy for this modality against influenza are reviewed, safety and logistical concerns for utilization of this potential new product (fresh convalescent plasma against influenza [FCP‐Flu]) are discussed. FCP‐Flu could indeed prove useful in a response to a pandemic, but two necessary items must first be satisfied. Most importantly, more research should be conducted to establish FCP‐Flu efficacy against the current and other pandemic strains. Second, and also importantly, blood banks and donor centers should examine whether offering this new product would be feasible in a pandemic and begin planning before a more severe pandemic forces us to respond without adequate preparation.","Leider, Jonathon P.; Brunker, Patricia A.R.; Ness, Paul M.",Transfusion,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7201862/,0

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: From 1987 through 2005, of 5792 patients referred to blood transfusion services at two Japanese university hospitals for autologous blood donations, 314 children younger than 16 years old served as subjects for assessment. RESULTS: Of 314 children, 7 were not suitable as autologous donors. In most cases this was due to uncooperative behavior. Over a follow‐up period of 19 years, the authors encountered 53 cases (17.3%) of donation‐related problems, and this rate was higher than the 6 percent rate recorded for adult cases (316/5305). Nine children suffered crucial complications such as vasovagal reactions, and one 14‐year‐old boy required a vasopressor drug. Important findings were that 6 of these were first‐time donors, and the amount of blood drawn was under 10 percent of their estimated blood volume. CONCLUSION: Of 53 donation‐related problems, 9 (17.0%) were accompanied by marked hypotension. Drawing autologous blood from children has become easier with advanced devices; however, lessening of anxiety and tension are essential for the safety of children's autologous blood donation programs. Aggressive donation should be avoided.","Tasaki, Tetsunori; Ohto, Hitoshi",Transfusion,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7201863/,0

We derive a two-dimensional diffusion model for the full temporal behavior of the stochastic susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) model on such a network, by making use of a time-scale separation in the deterministic limit of the dynamics. This low-dimensional process is an accurate approximation to the full model in the limit of large populations, even for cases when the time-scale separation is not too pronounced, provided the maximum degree is not of the order of the population size.","Parra-Rojas, César; House, Thomas; McKane, Alan J.",Phys Rev E,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7226849/,0

13146,Influenza Circulation in United States Army Training Camps Before and During the 1918 Influenza Pandemic: Clues to Early Detection of Pandemic Viral Emergence,2015-04-02,"Early warning signals (EWS) identify systems approaching a critical transition, where the system undergoes a sudden change in state. For example, monitoring changes in variance or autocorrelation offers a computationally inexpensive method which can be used in real-time to assess when an infectious disease transitions to elimination. EWS have a promising potential to not only be used to monitor infectious diseases, but also to inform control policies to aid disease elimination. Previously, potential EWS have been identified for prevalence data, however the prevalence of a disease is often not known directly. In this work we identify EWS for incidence data, the standard data type collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) or World Health Organization (WHO). We show, through several examples, that EWS calculated on simulated incidence time series data exhibit vastly different behaviours to those previously studied on prevalence data. In particular, the variance displays a decreasing trend on the approach to disease elimination, contrary to that expected from critical slowing down theory; this could lead to unreliable indicators of elimination when calculated on real-world data. We derive analytical predictions which can be generalised for many epidemiological systems, and we support our theory with simulated studies of disease incidence. Additionally, we explore EWS calculated on the rate of incidence over time, a property which can be extracted directly from incidence data. We find that although incidence might not exhibit typical critical slowing down properties before a critical transition, the rate of incidence does, presenting a promising new data type for the application of statistical indicators.","Southall, Emma; Tildesley, Michael J.; Dyson, Louise",PLoS Comput Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7531856/,0
14643,Performance of case definitions and clinical predictors for influenza surveillance among patients followed in a rural cohort in Senegal,2021-01-07,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effectiveness of nebulized magnesium sulfate in treating persistent pulmonary hypertension of newborn (PPHN). METHODS: Twenty-eight mechanically ventilated term neonates with severe PPHN were randomized into two groups: NebMag group (n = 14), who receiving nebulized isotonic magnesium (1024 mg/h), and IVMag group (n = 14), who received intravenous magnesium (200 mg/kg over 30 min, followed by 50 mg/kg/h). The study time frame was 24 h. Outcome measures were the changes in oxygenation index (OI), mean arterial blood pressure (MABP), vasoactive inotropic score (VIS), and serum magnesium level. RESULTS: Baseline demographic, ventilatory, and hemodynamic characteristics were comparable between the two groups. At the end of the study, the OI decreased by 44.3% in the NebMag group compared with 35.3% in the IVMag group (mean difference −3.14; 95%CI −5.08, −1.19; p 0.003). The NebMag group had a higher MABP (mean difference 2.29 mmHg; 95% CI 1.80, 2.77; p 0.000) and lower VIS (mean difference −14.64; 95% CI −16.52, −12.77; p 0.000) at the 24-h study time point. The increase in serum magnesium level, measured at 12-h study time point, was lower in the NebMag group (mean difference −2.26 mmol/L; 95% CI −2.58, −1.96; p 0.000). CONCLUSION: Nebulized magnesium sulfate may be an effective therapeutic modality for neonates with severe PPHN on mechanical ventilation, but this should be confirmed by larger studies.

15600,Partnership among hospitals to reduce healthcare associated infections: a quasi-experimental study in Brazilian ICUs,2021-02-25,"BACKGROUND: Mortality rates for patients with ARDS remain high. We assessed temporal changes in the epidemiology and management of ARDS patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation in European ICUs. We also investigated the association between ventilatory settings and outcome in these patients. METHODS: This was a post hoc analysis of two cohorts of adult ICU patients admitted between May 1–15, 2002 (SOAP study, n = 3147), and May 8–18, 2012 (ICON audit, n = 4601 admitted to ICUs in the same 24 countries as the SOAP study). ARDS was defined retrospectively using the Berlin definitions. Values of tidal volume, PEEP, plateau pressure, and FiO(2) corresponding to the most abnormal value of arterial PO(2) were recorded prospectively every 24 h. In both studies, patients were followed for outcome until death, hospital discharge or for 60 days. RESULTS: The frequency of ARDS requiring mechanical ventilation during the ICU stay was similar in SOAP and ICON (327[10.4%] vs. 494[10.7%], p = 0.793). The diagnosis of ARDS was established at a median of 3 (IQ: 1–7) days after admission in SOAP and 2 (1–6) days in ICON. Within 24 h of diagnosis, ARDS was mild in 244 (29.7%), moderate in 388 (47.3%), and severe in 189 (23.0%) patients. In patients with ARDS, tidal volumes were lower in the later (ICON) than in the earlier (SOAP) cohort. Plateau and driving pressures were also lower in ICON than in SOAP. ICU (134[41.1%] vs 179[36.9%]) and hospital (151[46.2%] vs 212[44.4%]) mortality rates in patients with ARDS were similar in SOAP and ICON. High plateau pressure (> 29 cmH(2)O) and driving pressure (> 14 cmH(2)O) on the first day of mechanical ventilation but not tidal volume (> 8 ml/kg predicted body weight [PBW]) were independently associated with a higher risk of in-hospital death. CONCLUSION: The frequency of and outcome from ARDS remained relatively stable between 2002 and 2012. Plateau pressure > 29 cmH(2)O and driving pressure > 14 cmH(2)O on the first day of mechanical ventilation but not tidal volume > 8 ml/kg PBW were independently associated with a higher risk of death. These data highlight the continued burden of ARDS and provide hypothesis-generating data for the design of future studies.","Sakr, Yasser; François, Bruno; Solé-Violan, Jordi; Kotfis, Katarzyna; Jaschinski, Ulrich; Estella, Angel; Leone, Marc; Jakob, Stephan M.; Wittebole, Xavier; Fontes, Luis E.; de Melo Gurgel, Miguel; Midega, Thais; Vincent, Jean-Louis; Ranieri, V.

MATERIALS AND METHOD: A cross sectional study was conducted at a teaching hospital in Karachi, Pakistan. A total of 230 employees from medical and non-medical departments were included. Participants were employees with child/children ages 4-12 year who consented to participate in the study, we included 135 fathers and 91 mothers. The questionnaire included (i) demographic data (ii) Media history exam form and (iii) parent reported strength and difficult questionnaire (SDQ). RESULT: The average daily screen time reported was 2.5 (1.5-5) hour for boys and 2 (1-4) hour for girls. Preschoolers had greater screen time as compared to school-aged children (Median (IQR): 3 (1.5-5.6) vs 2 (1-4), P = 0.46). The children owned devices with approximately equal distribution of preschoolers and school-aged children (19 (27.1%) and 48 (30%), P = 0.661 respectively). Emotional score was found higher in school-aged group in comparison to preschoolers (p = 0.036). Moreover, mother screen time and number of devices owned by a child were found to be positively associated with child's screen time. CONCLUSION: We conclude that as we are embracing the digital age providing a tech free zone to children is virtually impossible. Children screen time related activities in our part of the world exceeds the limitation. Parental awareness and co-viewing screen with their children are essential to avoid media related behavior problems.","Ishtiaq, Annum; Ashraf, Hiba; Iftikhar, Sundus; Baig-Ansari, Naila",J Family Med Prim Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8138366/,0

Feeding sites can favour high densities, home range overlap, greater sedentary behaviour and increased interspecific contacts, all of which might promote parasite transmission. In the Yunnan snub-nosed monkey (Rhinopithecus bieti), human interventions via provisioning monkeys at specific feeding sites have led to the sub-structuring of a group into genetically differentiated sub-groups. The fed subgroup is located near human hamlets and interacts with domesticated animals. Using high-throughput sequencing, we investigated Entamoeba species diversity in a local host assemblage strongly influenced by provisioning for wildlife-related tourism. We identified 13 Entamoeba species or lineages in faeces of Yunnan snub-nosed monkeys, humans and domesticated animals (including pigs, cattle, and domestic chicken). In Yunnan snub-nosed monkeys, Entamoeba prevalence and OTU richness were higher in the fed than in the wild subgroup. Entamoeba polecki was found in monkeys, pigs and humans, suggesting that this parasite might circulates between the wild and domestic components of this local social–ecological system. The highest proportion of faeces positive for Entamoeba in monkeys geographically coincided with the presence of livestock and humans. These elements suggest that feeding sites might indirectly play a role on parasite transmission in the Yunnan snub-nosed monkey. The implementation of such sites should carefully consider the risk of creating hotspots of disease transmission, which should be prevented by maintaining a buffer zone between monkeys and livestock/humans. Regular screenings for pathogens in fed subgroup are necessary to monitor transmission risk in order to balance the economic development of human communities dependent on wildlife-related tourism, and the conservation of the endangered Yunnan snub-nosed monkey.","Afonso, Eve; Fu, Rong; Dupaix, Amaël; Goydadin, Anne-Claude; Yu, ZhongHua; Callou, Cécile; Villette, Petra; Giraudoux, Patrick; Li, Li",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8339071/,0

Our aim was to compare the yearly prevalence, outcome and the Sepsis Six bundle compliance in patients at risk of mortality from sepsis in non-intensive care environments. Patients with a National Early Warning Score (NEWS) of 3 or above and suspected or proven infection were enrolled into four yearly 24-h point prevalence studies, carried out in fourteen hospitals across Wales from 2016 to 2019. We followed up patients to 30 days between 2016–2019 and to 90 days between 2017 and 2019. Out of the 26,947 patients screened 1651 fulfilled inclusion criteria and were recruited. The full ‘Sepsis Six’ care bundle was completed on 223 (14.0%) occasions, with no significant difference between the years. On 190 (11.5%) occasions none of the bundle elements were completed. There was no significant correlation between bundle element compliance, NEWS or year of study. One hundred and seventy (10.7%) patients were seen by critical care outreach; the ‘Sepsis Six’ bundle was completed significantly more often in this group (54/170, 32.0%) than for patients who were not reviewed by critical care outreach (168/1385, 11.6%; p < 0.0001). Overall survival to 30 days was 81.7% (1349/1651), with a mean survival time of 26.5 days (95% CI 26.1–26.9) with no difference between each year of study. 90-day survival for years 2017–2019 was 74.7% (949/1271), with no difference between the years. In multivariate regression we identified older age, heart failure, recent chemotherapy, higher frailty score and do not attempt cardiopulmonary resuscitation orders as significantly associated with increased 30-day mortality. Our data suggests that despite efforts to increase sepsis awareness within the NHS, there is poor compliance with the sepsis care bundles and no change in the high mortality over the study period.

A previous study published by the group of the authors has shown that microdose lithium and enriched environment can improve memory in both mice and humans. To elucidate this relationship better, this study aimed to evaluate whether the chronic combination of these two strategies could increase healthy aging in Senescence Accelerated Mouse-Prone 8 (SAMP8). Animals were submitted to either one or both of these strategies until the age of 10 months when they were anesthetized and killed and their hippocampus was extracted. The untreated SAMP-8 group exhibited worse memory and reduced neuronal density with greater neurodegeneration and increased amyloid-β plaque density compared with the control group. Moreover, significant alterations in proteins related to long-term potentiation, such as, synaptophysin and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), were observed in this group. The strategies used in the study maintained long-term memory, reduced anxiety, and increased neuroprotection. Both strategies were efficient in reducing neurodegeneration and increasing parameters related to memory maintenance. In many experiments, the combination of the two strategies was more effective in improving healthy aging. This study sheds light on the combination of strategies that choose to improve the quality of life and drugs with low side effects.

21312,The Etiology of Pneumonia in HIV-uninfected South African Children: Findings From the Pneumonia Etiology Research for Child Health (PERCH) Study,2021-08-25,"The term “antibiotics” is a broadly used misnomer to designate antibacterial drugs. In a recent article, we have proposed to replace, e.g., the term “antibiotics” by “antibacterial drugs”, “antibiosis” by “antibacterial therapy”, “antibiogram” by “antibacteriogram”, and “antibiotic stewardship” by “antibacterial stewardship” (Seifert and Schirmer Trends Microbiol, 2021). In the present article, we show that many traditional terms related to antibiotics are used much more widely in the biomedical literature than the respective scientifically precise terms. This practice should be stopped. Moreover, we provide arguments to end the use of other broadly used terms in the biomedical literature such as “narrow-spectrum antibiotics” and “reserve antibiotics”, “chemotherapeutics”, and “tuberculostatics”. Finally, we provide several examples showing that antibacterial drugs are used for non-antibacterial indications and that some non-antibacterial drugs are used for antibacterial indications now. Thus, the increasing importance of drug repurposing renders it important to drop short designations of drug classes such as “antibiotics”. Rather, the term “drug” should be explicitly used, facilitating the inclusion of newly emerging indications such as antipsychotic and anti-inflammatory. This article is part of an effort to implement a new rational nomenclature of drug classes across the entire field of pharmacology.

A total of 466 mixed gender commercial piglets from a breed-to-wean sow farm were enrolled. Piglets were alternately assigned by birth order within a litter to four umbilical treatment groups; iodine (2%), Zurex umbilical dip, a dry dip created using an antibacterial peptide (nisin) mixed with talc (formulation concentration = 3.105 g nisin/100 g talc on a wt/wt basis), and no treatment. At birth, stall conditions (wet/dry and clean/dirty) were evaluated on a 3 point scale (3 = most dirty or most wet and 1 = dry or clean). Before treatment, diameter of the umbilical cords were determined using digital calipers. All data were analyzed using mixed model methods. Models included the fixed effects of birth weight, umbilical diameter at birth, gender, stall conditions and treatment. Pre-weaning mortality was significantly affected by umbilical treatment (p < 0.05) and by ratio of umbilical diameter to birth weight (p < 0.001). Piglets treated with 2% iodine had a higher mortality rate than piglets treated with other antiseptics or those that were untreated. Piglets with the lowest umbilical cord diameter to birth weight ratio had the highest survival rate. Stall conditions at birth (p < 0.005) and the ratio of umbilical diameter to birth weight (p < 0.05) affected the incidence of umbilical hernias. Piglets born in wet stall conditions or those with a high umbilical cord to birth weight ratio had a higher incidence of umbilical hernias in the growing phase. Final 150 d weight of pigs was affected by the ratio of umbilical diameter to birth weight (p < 0.0001) and gender (p < 0.0001), and tended to be affected by stall conditions at birth (p = 0.06). Male pigs weighed 93.5 kg, while female pigs weighed 86.5 kg. Piglets with the highest ratio of umbilical cord diameter to birth weight and those born in wet stall conditions weighed less. In conclusion, measuring the umbilical cord to birth weight ratio was a much better predictor of pre-weaning mortality, incidence of umbilical hernias, and 150 d weight than birth weight alone.","Robinson, A.

26936,CS15-01 Can We Prevent Hepatocellular Carcinoma in Chronic Hepatitis B?,2009-08-13,"The endothelial TIE1 and TIE2 receptor tyrosine kinases form a distinct subfamily characterized by their unique extracellular domains. Together with the angiopoietin growth factors (ANGPT1, ANGPT2, ANGPT4, also abbreviated as ANG), the TIE receptors form an endothelial specific signaling pathway with important functions in the regulation of lymphatic and cardiovascular development and vascular homeostasis. Angiopoietins exist in multimeric forms that activate the TIE receptors via unique mechanism. In endothelial cell–cell contacts, angiopoietins induce the formation of homomeric in trans TIE receptor complexes extending across the cell junctions, whereas matrix-bound angiopoietin-1 (ANG1) activates the TIE receptors in a cis configuration. In comparison to the vascular endothelial growth factor receptors, the TIE receptors undergo little ubiquitin-mediated degradation after activation, whereas TIE2 signaling is negatively regulated by the vascular endothelial protein tyrosine phosphatase, VE-PTP. ANG1 activation of TIE2 supports vascular stabilization, whereas angiopoietin-2 (ANG2), a context-dependent weak TIE2 agonist/antagonist, promotes pathological tumor angiogenesis, vascular permeability, and inflammation. Recently, ANG2 has been found to mediate some of its vascular destabilizing and angiogenic functions via integrin signalling. The circulating levels of ANG2 are increased in cancer, and in several human diseases associated with inflammation and vascular leak, for example, in sepsis. Blocking of ANG2 has emerged as a potential novel therapeutic strategy for these diseases. In addition, preclinical results demonstrate that genetic TIE1 deletion in mice inhibits the vascularization and growth of tumor isografts and protects from atherosclerosis, with little effect on normal vascular homeostasis in adult mice. The ability of the ANG-TIE pathway to control vessel stability and angiogenesis makes it an interesting vascular target for the treatment of the various diseases.","Saharinen, Pipsa; Jeltsch, Michael; Santoyo, Mayte M.; Leppänen, Veli-Matti; Alitalo, Kari",Receptor Tyrosine Kinases: Family and Subfamilies,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123982/,0

Yet, we are not aware of any adoption of the principle of coordination in the broad domain of cyber-physical systems, where non-functional properties, such as execution/response time, energy consumption and security are as crucial as functional correctness. We propose a coordination approach, including a functional coordination language and its associated tool flow, that considers time, energy and security as first-class citizens in application design and development. We primarily target cyber-physical systems running on off-the-shelf heterogeneous multi-core platforms.

36143,"Incidence, mortality, and lethality of hospitalizations for community-acquired pneumonia with comorbid cardiovascular disease in Spain (1997–2015)",2020-07-06,"Game-based learning environments enable students to engage in authentic, inquiry-based learning. Reflective thinking serves a critical role in inquiry-based learning by encouraging students to think critically about their knowledge and experiences in order to foster deeper learning processes. Free-response reflection prompts can be embedded in game-based learning environments to encourage students to engage in reflection and externalize their reflection processes, but automatically assessing student reflection presents significant challenges. In this paper, we present a framework for automatically assessing students’ written reflection responses during inquiry-based learning in Crystal Island, a game-based learning environment for middle school microbiology. Using data from a classroom study involving 153 middle school students, we compare the effectiveness of several computational representations of students’ natural language responses to reflection prompts—GloVe, ELMo, tf-idf, unigrams—across several machine learning-based regression techniques (i.e., random forest, support vector machine, multi-layer perceptron) to assess the depth of student reflection responses. Results demonstrate that assessment models based on ELMo deep contextualized word representations yield more accurate predictions of students’ written reflection depth than competing techniques. These findings point toward the potential of leveraging automated assessment of student reflection to inform real-time adaptive support for inquiry-based learning in game-based learning environments.","Carpenter, Dan; Geden, Michael; Rowe, Jonathan; Azevedo, Roger; Lester, James",Artificial Intelligence in Education,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7334177/,0

39192,Neonatal septicemia caused by a rare pathogen: Raoultella planticola - a report of four cases,2020-09-16,"PURPOSE: Radiotherapy (RT), as part of trimodal therapy, is an attractive alternative treatment in patients with urothelial muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). There is accumulating evidence suggesting the immunomodulatory effects of RT and its potential synergy when combined with immunotherapy. The aim of this review was to report on the most recent advances on this combination, including the mechanisms of RT immunomodulation, practical approach to combining RT and immunotherapy, and ongoing clinical trials in bladder cancer. METHODS: Using the PubMed database, we identified articles published between March 2004 and April 2020 on the combination of RT with immunotherapy in localized or metastatic MIBC. A search of the Clinicaltrials.gov and Clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ retrieved ongoing clinical trials on the topic as well. RESULTS: Combination of RT with immunotherapy leads to immunogenic cell death and an increase in immune markers thus leading to improved tumor control. For localized MIBC, there are safety concerns related to the use of concurrent immunotherapy with hypofractionated RT, thus neoadjuvant or adjuvant immunotherapy is preferred. In the metastatic setting, the combination of multi-site RT with SBRT-like doses (≥ 6 Gy per fraction) and concurrent immunotherapy seems most efficacious at harnessing the abscopal effect. At least 25 clinical trials combining immunotherapy and RT in MIBC are currently ongoing and will answer pending questions on safety, efficacy, and practical considerations on RT scheduling, fractionation, and targets volumes. CONCLUSION: RT has the potential to synergize with immunotherapy to improve oncological outcomes in patient with localized or metastatic MIBC. Clinical trials results are eagerly awaited.","Daro-Faye, Mame; Kassouf, Wassim; Souhami, Luis; Marcq, Gautier; Cury, Fabio; Niazi, Tamim; Sargos, Paul",World J Urol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7484608/,0

Compared to pre-recession period, immigrants see a modest decline in their relative wages during the recession regardless of model specification. After the recession, immigrants’ relative wages largely recover from the recession-induced decline, but the wage disadvantage does not completely revert back to its pre-recession level. Selective in- and out-migration by immigrants or selection of natives into employment do not seem to drive the results. It appears that, during the recession, immigrants may have traded higher employment with lower wages and employers might have been willing to hire them as a cost-saving measure. The results could have implications for how relative wages of immigrants respond to the ongoing COVID-19 Pandemic Recession.","Gill, Fahad; Shaeye, Abdihafit",J Econ Race Policy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7779640/,0

It draws on literature from police studies and criminology, in which the concept is a stable one that continues to be heavily researched and analysed. Police and social workers bear comparison in respect of legitimacy because of the significant powers they use on behalf of the state with direct implications for the civil and human rights of their fellow citizens. The article defines legitimacy in theoretical terms before applying the concept to social work. Here, perceptions of fairness in the distribution of resources, the quality of treatment people receive, and the quality of decision-making are critically examined. The article then proposes a democratising agenda across the three domains of social work research, policy, and practice. Through challenging social work’s legitimacy and analysing its relationship to social democracy, it is argued that new ways may be found to realign practice with the values of human rights and social justice that are said to underpin the profession. Given the severe socioeconomic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on many families, these questions acquire a particular urgency.","Warner, Jo",Br J Soc Work,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7929336/,0

The objective of this analysis was to describe the different recruitment methods of college students for the Snackability Trial during COVID-19. We also examined the reasons for exclusion in the study. The Snackability Trial is a randomized controlled trial to test the Snackability mobile app designed and developed at FIU to help students identify healthy snacks by providing a score from 0–11 (the higher the score, the healthier the snack) based on the USDA snack guidelines. METHODS: This is a review of the online screening and baseline surveys completed by students using Qualtrics between June 2020 and January 2021 for the Snackability Trial. Students aged 18–24 y, from non-nutrition majors, overweight, owner of a smartphone, and willing to be randomized in either the intervention or control group for 3 months were recruited through emails sent by professors and university staff, social media ads, on-campus flyers, and others. Descriptive statistics were used to examine the frequency of each recruitment method and reasons for exclusion. RESULTS: Out of 768 participants that initiated the screening questionnaire, 629 (82%) were 18–24y. Out 629, 569 (92%) were from non-nutrition majors. Out of 569, 328 (58%) provided data to calculate BMI and qualified. Out of 328, 309 (94%) had a smartphone. Out of 309, 294 (98%) were willing to be randomized and 280 (95%) were willing to participate for 3 months. Out of 280, only 154 (55%) completed the consent form and the baseline survey. Those that enrolled were mostly female (85%). When asked about “how did you hear about the study”, 81.8% reported that a professor or staff from the university sent them the study flyer by email, 9.5% heard from social media, including Instagram, 5.8% heard from other students or friends, and 2.9% learned about the study through flyers posted on campus. After examining the data from Instagram paid ads, a total of 3 posts were promoted with a budget of $65 reaching a total of 8,536 individuals with only 8 promotion clicks. CONCLUSIONS: Amid the transition into a fully virtual recruiting format during the pandemic, the most effective recruiting method in this study was sending emails to students through their professors and university staff with the study flyer.

What can the comparatively new field of psychosocial studies usefully learn and integrate from these mostly neglected predecessors? I examine how this widespread academic amnesia set in and explain the relevance of the Eriksonian tradition, relate ways in which psycho-historians trailblazed psychosocial studies, address the importance of an intrinsic “activist ingredient” in such ventures, and argue that both psychohistory and psychosocial studies stand to benefit greatly from such an intellectual exchange.","Jacobsen, Kurt",Psychoanal Cult Soc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8330186/,0

59501,Strategies to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia in acute care hospitals: 2014 update.,2014,"BACKGROUND & AIMS While biopsy is the gold standard for liver fibrosis staging, it poses significant risks. Noninvasive assessment of liver fibrosis is a growing field. Recently, deep learning technology has revolutionized medical image analysis. This technology has the potential to enhance noninvasive fibrosis assessment. We systematically examined the application of deep learning in noninvasive liver fibrosis imaging. METHODS Embase, MEDLINE, Web of Science, and IEEE Xplore databases were used to identify studies that reported on the accuracy of deep learning for classification of liver fibrosis on noninvasive imaging. The search keywords were ""liver or hepatic,"" ""fibrosis or cirrhosis,"" and ""neural or deep learning networks."" Risk of bias and applicability were evaluated using the QUADAS-2 tool. RESULTS Sixteen studies were retrieved. Imaging modalities included ultrasound (n=10), computed tomography (n=3), and magnetic resonance imaging (n=3). The studies analyzed a total of 40,405 radiological images from 15,853 patients. All but two of the studies were retrospective. In most studies the ""ground truth"" reference was the METAVIR score for pathological staging (n=9,56%). The majority of the studies reported an accuracy >85% when compared to histopathology. Fourteen studies (87.5%) had a high risk of bias and concerns regarding applicability. CONCLUSIONS Deep learning has the potential to play an emerging role in liver fibrosis classification. Yet, it is still limited by a relatively small number of retrospective studies. Clinicians should facilitate the use of this technology by sharing databases and standardized reports. This may optimize the noninvasive evaluation of liver fibrosis on a large scale.","Anteby, Roi; Klang, Eyal; Horesh, Nir; Nachmany, Ido; Shimon, Orit; Barash, Yiftach; Kopylov, Uri; Soffer, Shelly",Liver international : official journal of the International Association for the Study of the Liver,https://doi.org/10.1111/liv.14966; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34008300/,0

The purpose of this study was to test whether the prepandemic functional connectome predicted individual anxiety induced by the pandemic. METHODS Anxiety scores from healthy undergraduate students were collected during the severe and remission periods of the pandemic (first survey, February 22-28, 2020, N=589; second survey, April 24 to May 1, 2020, N=486). Brain imaging data and baseline (daily) anxiety ratings were acquired before the pandemic. The predictive performance of the functional connectome on individual anxiety was examined using machine learning and was validated in two external undergraduate student samples (N=149 and N=474). The clinical relevance of the findings was further explored by applying the connectome-based neuromarkers of pandemic-related anxiety to distinguish between individuals with specific mental disorders and matched healthy control subjects (generalized anxiety disorder, N=43; major depression, N=536; schizophrenia, N=72). RESULTS Anxiety scores increased from the prepandemic baseline to the severe stage of the pandemic and remained high in the remission stage. The prepandemic functional connectome predicted pandemic-related anxiety and generalized to the external sample but showed poor performance for predicting daily anxiety. The connectome-based neuromarkers of pandemic-related anxiety further distinguished between participants with generalized anxiety and healthy control subjects but were not useful for diagnostic classification in major depression and schizophrenia. CONCLUSIONS These findings demonstrate the feasibility of using the functional connectome to predict individual anxiety induced by major stressful events (e.g., the current global health crisis), which advances our understanding of the neurobiological basis of anxiety susceptibility and may have implications for developing targeted psychological and clinical interventions that promote the reduction of stress and anxiety.","He, Li; Wei, Dongtao; Yang, Fan; Zhang, Jie; Cheng, Wei; Feng, Jianfeng; Yang, Wenjing; Zhuang, Kaixiang; Chen, Qunlin; Ren, Zhiting; Li, Yu; Wang, Xiaoqin; Mao, Yu; Chen, Zhiyi; Liao, Mei; Cui, Huiru; Li, Chunbo; He, Qinghua; Lei, Xu; Feng, Tingyong; Chen, Hong; Xie, Peng; Rolls, Edmund T; Su, Linyan; Li, Lingjiang; Qiu, Jiang",The American journal of psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.ajp.2020.20070979; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33900813/,0

The most common site of DVT origin is in the lower extremities, with 50% of patients exhibiting no symptoms. Although anticoagulation is the gold standard for DVT, early clot removal, especially of proximal iliofemoral DVT, is felt to reduce the incidence of postthrombotic syndrome (PTS) by preserving valve function. Up to one-half of all patients with an iliofemoral DVT treated only with anticoagulation subsequently develop long-term complications, including PTS. Beside anticoagulation, DVT treatment options may include pharmaceutical and/or mechanical therapies. Mechanical therapies consist of either endovascular percutaneous catheter-directed (PCD) interventions or open operative thrombectomy. There are several different PCD procedures available, consisting of catheter-directed thrombolysis, mechanical thrombectomy, combination pharmacomechanical devices, and postthrombus extraction (angioplasty and/or stenting). Endovascular therapies in the management of acute iliofemoral DVT are evolving with a variety of devices available to treat this disease entity.

70098,Yellow fever vaccine-associated neurological disease: it is not just the silver generation at risk.,2019,"BACKGROUND Applicability of the World Health Organization (WHO) maternal near miss criteria in low-income settings is not systematically addressed in the literature. The objective of this review was to determine the applicability of the WHO maternal near miss tool in sub-Saharan Africa. METHODS We searched PubMed, Embase, Popline, CINAHL, AJOL, and Google scholar using key words for maternal near miss and sub-Saharan Africa. Studies which applied the WHO maternal near miss criteria, containing clear definitions, and published between January 1st, 2009 and December 31st, 2017 were included. Two authors independently extracted data. Quantitative analysis and narrative synthesis were conducted, and medians with interquartile range (IQR) were calculated for summarizing the findings. Methodological quality of the studies was assessed using the Estabrook's quality assessment and validity tool. RESULTS Fifteen studies from nine countries comprising 227,077 participants were included. Median maternal near miss ratio was 24.2 (IQR: 12.4-35.8) per 1000 live births ranging from 4.4 in a population-based study in South Africa to 198 in a rural private hospital in Nigeria. Eight studies reported challenges in implementing the WHO maternal near miss tool, especially related to the threshold for blood transfusion, and availability of several laboratory-based criteria. In three studies, local adaptations were made. CONCLUSION This review showed that the WHO maternal near miss tool is not uniformly applied in sub-Saharan Africa. Therefore, a common adaptation for the region is required to increase its applicability.","Tura, Abera Kenay; Trang, To Lam; van den Akker, Thomas; van Roosmalen, Jos; Scherjon, Sicco; Zwart, Joost; Stekelenburg, Jelle",BMC pregnancy and childbirth,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12884-019-2225-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30808325/,0
73428,Rare cutaneous manifestation of Trichosporon asahii.,2021-06-17,"OBJECTIVE To describe the pharmacokinetics of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) in healthy cats after oral and IV administration. ANIMALS 6 healthy cats. PROCEDURES In a crossover study, cats received NAC (100 mg/kg) via IV and oral routes of administration; there was a 4-week washout period between treatments. Plasma samples were obtained at 0, 5, 15, 30, and 45 minutes and 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, and 48 hours after administration, and NAC concentrations were quantified by use of a validated high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry protocol. Data were analyzed via compartmental and noncompartmental pharmacokinetic analysis. RESULTS Pharmacokinetics for both routes of administration were best described by a 2-compartment model. Mean ± SD elimination half-life was 0.78 ± 0.16 hours and 1.34 ± 0.24 hours for the IV and oral routes of administration, respectively. Mean bioavailability of NAC after oral administration was 19.3 ± 4.4%. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE The pharmacokinetics of NAC for this small population of healthy cats differed from values reported for humans. Assuming there would be similar pharmacokinetics in diseased cats, dose extrapolations from human medicine may result in underdosing of NAC in cats with acute disease. Despite the low bioavailability, plasma concentrations of NAC after oral administration at 100 mg/kg may be effective in the treatment of chronic diseases.","Buur, Jennifer L; Diniz, Pedro P V P; Roderick, Kursten V; KuKanich, Butch; Tegzes, John H",American journal of veterinary research,https://doi.org/10.2460/ajvr.74.2.290; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23363356/,0

METHODS a descriptive, cross-sectional study in a sample of 116 Spanish schoolchildren. The perception of loneliness, happiness, and health was assessed using three items of the Health Behavior in School-aged Children questionnaire. The quality of their Mediterranean diet was assessed using the Mediterranean Diet Quality Index quetsionnaire for children and adolescents. Anthropometric variables were collected through a self-reported questionnaire, and for the calculation of body mass index the Quetelet index (kg/m2) was used. RESULTS the descriptive analysis showed no differences in the perception of loneliness, happiness, or health, quality of diet, or anthropometric variables (p > 0.005), except for weight (p < 0.005), according to sex. The inferential analysis showed that higher values in quality of diet are correlated with higher scores in perceived happiness and health (p < 0.005). In turn, the linear regression test showed an association between quality of diet and perception of happiness after the model was adjusted for normal weight (R2 = 0.382; p < 0.005). Likewise, it showed a significant association between quality of diet and perception of health after the model was adjusted for overweight schoolchildren (R2 = 0.455; p < 0.005). CONCLUSION the association between perceived health and happiness with quality of diet seems to be moderated by weight status.","Carrillo Lopez, Pedro José; Rosa Guillamón, Andrés; Tárraga López, Pedro Juan; García Cantó, Eliseo",Nutricion hospitalaria,https://doi.org/10.20960/nh.03525; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33845582/,0

Methods A total of 134 suspected COVID-19 patients in the isolation ward of the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University were recruited from January 23 to May 23, 2020. We analyze the pathogenic form and clinical characteristics. Results Among them, pathogens were identified in only 84 patients (62.7%), including 23 (17.1%) with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), 30 (22.3%) with other viruses, 31 (25.0%) with other pathogens and 3 (3.5%) with mixed infections. The commonly observed symptoms of COVID-19 patients were cough, fever, fatigue, and muscle aches, which were significantly different than the symptoms of nonviral infections (P<0.05) but from those of other viral infections (P>0.05). Furthermore, lactate dehydrogenase and the neutrophil/lymphocyte were found significantly high in COVID-19 patients compared to non-COVID-19 patients (P<0.05). The most common manifestations of COVID-19 patients were ground-glass opacities (100%) with or without lung consolidation, however, they also often showed involvement of several lobes of both lungs (P<0.05). Due to the clear differential diagnosis, the overall antibiotic use rate was 35.8% (31/87). Conclusions When diagnosing COVID-19, infections with other pathogens should not be ignored. Successful pathogen identification will support accurate treatment.","Li, Shaoqiang; Li, Zhengtu; Chen, Liyan; Cheng, Jing; Zhan, Yangqing; Yang, Feng; Jiang, Qian; Su, Xiaofen; Xie, Yingying; Wu, Zhile; Guo, Wenliang; Gu, Weili; Zhong, Nanshan; Li, Shiyue; Ye, Feng",Annals of translational medicine,https://doi.org/10.21037/atm-20-6600; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33987319/,0
75289,IgG4-related disease: an atypical presentation of steroid-responsive renal mass.,2021-05-24,"Previously, we showed that the presence of the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) gD glycoprotein but not gB potently restricted HIV-1 particle infectivity. This restriction was characterized by incorporation of HSV-1 gD and the exclusion of the HIV-1 gp120/gp41 from budding virus particles. To determine the structural domains involved in gD restriction of HIV-1, a series of deletion mutants and chimeric proteins between gD and the non-restrictive gB were generated. Our results show that deletion of the cytoplasmic tail domain (CTD) of gD or that replacement of the transmembrane domain (TMD) with the TMD from gB slightly reduced restriction activity. However, replacement of the gD CTD with that of gB resulted in lower cell surface expression, significantly less incorporation into HIV-1 particles, and inefficient restriction of the release of infectious HIV-1. Analysis of gB/gD chimeric proteins revealed that removal of the gB CTD or replacement with gD CTD resulted in enhanced surface expression and an increase in restriction activity. Finally, we show that expression of gD without other HSV-1 proteins resulted in gD fractionation into detergent resistant membranes (DRM) and that gD co-localized with the raft marker GM1, which may partially explain its incorporation into budding virus particles. Taken together, our results suggest that expression of gD at the cell surface is likely a major factor but that other intrinsic properties are also involved in the gD-mediated restriction of HIV-1 particle infectivity.IMPORTANCE Previously, we showed that unlike the HSV-1, the presence of the gD glycoprotein in virus producer cells but not gB potently restricted HIV-1 particle infectivity. To better understand the relationship between cell surface expression, virus incorporation and restriction of HIV-1, we analyzed a series of deletion mutants and chimeric proteins in which domains of gD and gB were swapped. Our results indicate that: a) gD/gB chimeras having the cytoplasmic domain (CTD) of gB significantly reduced cell surface expression, release from cells, incorporation into virus, and reduced HIV-1 restriction; b) removal of the gB CTD or replacement with the gD CTD resulted in better surface expression, incorporation into HIV-1, and enhanced restriction; and c) the transmembrane domain of gB can influence transport and ultimately effect incorporation of gB into HIV-1. Overall, these data support a role for gD surface expression as crucial to restriction of infectious HIV-1 release.","Arachchige, Sachith Polpitiya; Henke, Wyatt; Kalamvoki, Maria; Stephens, Edward B",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02355-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33536165/,0
78204,Assessing the healthcare epidemiology environment-A roadmap for SHEA's future.,2021-06-18,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] is a plasma circulating apoB100 (apoB) containing lipoprotein. It has a unique glycoprotein bound to the apoB100, apolipoprotein(a) [apo(a)]. The majority of the population expresses two apo(a) isoforms, when bound to apoB100 they create two circulating Lp(a) particles. Lp(a) levels are genetically determined and epidemiological studies have established elevated levels of Lp(a) to be a causal risk factor of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Lp(a) levels differ across racial groups and Blacks of Sub-Saharan decent have higher levels when compared to white. In comparison to white populations, studies in minorities are less represented in the published literature. Additionally, there is a lack of standardization in the commercial assays used to measured Lp(a) levels, and hence it is difficult to assess risk based on individual Lp(a) levels, but risk seems to occur in the upper percentiles of the population. RECENT FINDINGS A recent study using data from the UK biobank highlights the racial differences in Lp(a) levels and the increase risk in CVD amongst all races. SUMMARY This review will highlight Lp(a) biology and physiology with a focus on available data from racially diverse cohorts. There is a need to perform studies in diverse populations to understand if they are at higher risk than whites are.","Reyes-Soffer, Gissette",Current opinion in lipidology,https://doi.org/10.1097/mol.0000000000000753; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33900209/,0
78418,Interpreting and addressing suboptimal immune responses after COVID-19 vaccination in solid organ transplant recipients.,2021-06-18,"BACKGROUND Understanding and describing the regional and climatic patterns associated with increasing dengue epidemics in Nepal is critical to improving vector and disease surveillance and targeting control efforts. METHODS We investigated the spatial and temporal patterns of annual dengue incidence in Nepal from 2010 to 2019, and the impacts of seasonal meteorological conditions (mean maximum, minimum temperature and precipitation) and elevation on those patterns. RESULTS More than 25 000 laboratory-confirmed dengue cases were reported from 2010 to 2019. Epidemiological trends suggest that dengue epidemics are cyclical with major outbreaks occurring at 2- to 3-y intervals. A significant negative relationship between dengue incidence and increasing elevation (metres above sea level) driven by temperature was observed (p<0.05) with dengue risk being greatest below 500 m. Risk was moderate between 500 and 1500 m and decreased substantially above 1500 m. Over the last decade, increased nightly temperatures during the monsoon months correlated with increased transmission (p<0.05). No other significant relationship was observed between annual dengue cases or incidence and climatological factors. CONCLUSIONS The spatial analysis and interpretation of dengue incidence over the last decade in Nepal confirms that dengue is now a well-established public health threat of increasing importance, particularly in low elevation zones and urbanised areas with a tropical or subtropical climate. Seasonal variations in temperature during the monsoon months are associated with increased transmission.","Gyawali, Narayan; Johnson, Brian J; Dixit, Sameer M; Devine, Gregor J",Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene,https://doi.org/10.1093/trstmh/traa131; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33197254/,0

METHODS Thirty-one patients who underwent evacuation proctography 6 months postoperatively were assessed. Preoperative proctography had been performed in 21 patients of these patients. Defecatory function was evaluated using the constipation scoring system (CSS) and fecal incontinence severity index (FISI). RESULTS The findings of postoperative proctography revealed no full-thickness ERP in any patient, although in 10 patients the ERP was replaced by rectoanal intussusception (RAI). Of the 31 patients, 30 presented with fecal incontinence preoperatively. Ten of 30 had new-onset RAI. Six months postoperatively, a reduction of at least 50 % in the FISI score of the patients with new-onset RAI tended to be significantly smaller than in the patients without RAI (6/10 vs. 18/20, p = 0.141). Seventeen patients presented with obstructed defecation preoperatively. Seven of them had new-onset RAI. Six months postoperatively, a reduction of at least 50 % in their CSS score in the patients with new-onset RAI was significantly smaller than in patients without RAI (0/7 vs. 8/10, p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS Evacuation proctography showed new-onset RAI in some patients with ERP who underwent LVR, which was associated with a lack of symptomatic improvement.","Tsunoda, A; Takahashi, T; Ohta, T; Fujii, W; Kusanagi, H",Techniques in coloproctology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10151-015-1395-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26589950/,0

Improving the intubation procedure is a major goal for all ICU physicians worldwide, and videolaryngoscopy may play a relevant role.Videolaryngoscopes are a heterogeneous entity, including Macintosh blade-shaped optical laryngoscopes, anatomically shaped blade without a tube guide and anatomically shaped blade with a tube guide, which might have theoretical benefits and pitfalls. Videolaryngoscope/videolaryngoscopy improves glottis view and allows supervision by an expert during the intubation process; however, randomized controlled trials in the ICU suggest that the systematic use of videolaryngoscopes for every intubation cannot yet be recommended, especially in non-expert hands. Nevertheless, a videolaryngoscope should be available in all ICUs as a powerful tool to rescue difficult intubation or unsuccessful first-pass laryngoscopy, especially in expert hands.The use of associated devices such as bougie or stylet, glottis view needed (full vs incomplete) and patient position during intubation (ramped, sniffed position) should be further evaluated.

Five simulation sessions were held at Western Health CCL to simulate different cardiac arrest scenarios. Participants included cardiologists, intensivists, anesthetists, nurses, and technicians. Post-simulation feedback was analyzed qualitatively. Challenges encountered were grouped into 4 areas: (1) communication and teamwork, (2) equipment, (3) vascular access and drugs, and (4) physical environment and radiation exposure. Proposed solutions included regular simulation training; increasing familiarity with the physical environment, utilization of specialized equipment; and formation of 2 team leaders to improve efficiency. Cardiac arrest in the CCL is a unique clinical event that necessitates specific training to improve technical and nontechnical skills with potential to improve clinical outcomes.","Al-Mukhtar, Omar; Bilgrami, Irma; Noaman, Samer; Lapsley, Rebecca; Ozcan, John; Marane, Candida; Groen, Fiona; Cox, Nicholas; Chan, William",American journal of medical quality : the official journal of the American College of Medical Quality,https://doi.org/10.1177/1062860620950805; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32840115/,0

While it has been proposed that cognitive control is needed to mediate this conflict between reward and our moral self-image, the exact role of cognitive control in (dis)honesty remains elusive. Here we identify this role, by investigating the neural mechanism underlying cheating. We developed a task which allows for inconspicuously measuring spontaneous cheating on a trial-by-trial basis in the MRI scanner. We found that activity in the nucleus accumbens promotes cheating, particularly for individuals who cheat a lot, while a network consisting of posterior cingulate cortex, temporoparietal junction, and medial prefrontal cortex promotes honesty, particularly in individuals who are generally honest. Finally, activity in areas associated with cognitive control (anterior cingulate cortex and inferior frontal gyrus) helped dishonest participants to be honest, whereas it enabled cheating for honest participants. Thus, our results suggest that cognitive control is not needed to be honest or dishonest per se but that it depends on an individual's moral default.","Speer, Sebastian P H; Smidts, Ale; Boksem, Maarten A S",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2003480117; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32747572/,0
83193,Respiratory viral testing and antibacterial treatment in patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia.,2020-12-01,"OBJECTIVES Biologic mesh (BM) prostheses are increasingly utilized for hernia repairs. Modern BMs are not only derived from different tissue sources, but also undergo various proprietary processing steps-factors that likely impact host tissue responses and mesh performance. We aimed to compare histopathologic responses to various BMs after implantation in a mouse model. MATERIALS AND METHODS Five-mm samples of non-crosslinked [Strattice (ST)], and intentionally crosslinked [CollaMend (CM), Permacol (PC)] porcine-derived biologic meshes were implanted subcutaneously in C57BL/6 mice. 1, 4, 8, and 12 weeks post-implantation, meshes were assessed for inflammation, foreign body reaction (FBR), neocellularization, and collagen deposition using H&E and trichrome stains. RESULTS All meshes induced early polymorphonuclear cell infiltration (highest in CM; lowest in ST) that resolved by 4 weeks. ST was associated with extensive macrophage presence at 12 weeks. Foreign body response was not seen in the ST group, but was present abundantly in the CM and PC groups, highest at 8 weeks. New peripheral collagen deposition was seen only in the ST group at 12 weeks. Collagen organization was highest in the ST group as well. Both CM and PC groups were associated with fibrous encapsulation and no evidence of integration or remodeling. CONCLUSIONS Inflammation appears to be a common component of integration of all biologic meshes studied. Pronounced inflammatory responses as well as profound FBR likely lead to observed encapsulation and poor host integration of the crosslinked BMs. Overall, ST was associated with the lowest foreign body response and the highest degree of new collagen deposition and organization. These features may be key predictors for improved mesh performance during hernia repair.","Novitsky, Y W; Orenstein, S B; Kreutzer, D L",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10029-013-1203-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24370604/,0

Methods Records based retrospective design was applied at a large teaching hospital in Wuhan, China. SPSS 21 version was used for data entry and analysis with univariate and multivariate logistic regression models for comparing study variables. Results Of 300 patients, 224 (74.7%) were known to be hypertensive and admitted with subnormal blood pressure.

The purpose of this study was to create metrics for and evaluate the validity for two new tasks: camera navigation (N) and cannulation (C), and to explore the potential value of adding these tasks to the FLS program. METHODS Participants were assessed by two raters during performance of N and C in addition to the five standard FLS tasks. They also completed a questionnaire regarding the educational value of the new tasks. Validity evidence was assessed by comparing performance between Novice (PGY 1 and 2) and Experienced (PGY 3 and higher) participants, and by correlating new task scores with standard FLS scores. The ability to predict level of training using scores was evaluated by regression analysis. RESULTS Sixty subjects participated from five North American centers.

Prediction of training level using the combination of all seven tasks was 52.6 % (R (2) = 0.526, p < 0.01), adding an additional 2.2 % to the five FLS tasks. Of 55 participants with laparoscopic experience, 51 % reported N to be similar in difficulty to reality. Of 28 participants who perform intraoperative cholangiograms, 43 % found C to be more difficult than reality. Most (70 %) participants thought the new tasks added value to FLS. CONCLUSIONS This study provides preliminary validity evidence for the metrics of these new tasks. The value of adding these tasks to the FLS manual skills assessment is marginal in terms of predicting level of training.","Watanabe, Yusuke; Matt Ritter, E; Schwaitzberg, Steven D; Korndorffer, James R; Scott, Daniel J; Okrainec, Allan; Bilgic, Elif; Kaneva, Pepa A; O'Donnell, Mary T; Feldman, Liane S; Fried, Gerald M; Vassiliou, Melina C",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-014-3721-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25034381/,0

OBJECTIVE To determine whether instillation of a long-acting local anesthetic between the mesh and the peritoneum after LVHR reduces pain or narcotic requirements. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A prospective, double-blind, randomized clinical trial with data collection during a brief hospital stay in a tertiary care, community teaching hospital over 3 years between December 15, 2011, and March 28, 2014. Of 120 screened patients undergoing LVHR in this intention-to-treat analysis, 99 eligible patients were randomized. Forty-two patients received the study drug, and 38 patients received placebo. Patients with a history of chronic narcotic use were excluded. INTERVENTION After mesh placement, a long-acting local anesthetic (bupivacaine hydrochloride, 0.50%) or placebo (0.9% normal saline) was injected between the mesh and the peritoneum. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Postoperative pain (on a standard scale ranging from 0 to 10), and narcotic medication use (intravenous morphine equivalents). There were no adverse events. RESULTS Baseline and operative characteristics were similar except that the treatment group was older (61.8 vs 52.3 years, P = .001). After surgery, pain scores in the recovery room (3.2 vs 4.7, P = .003), interval total narcotic use (6.7 vs 12.5 mg, P = .003 at <4 hours and 0 vs 2.7 mg, P = .01 at 8-12 hours), and total intravenous narcotic use (9.2 vs 17.2 mg of morphine sulfate equivalents, P = .03) were significantly less in the treatment group. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Administration of a long-acting local anesthetic between the mesh and the peritoneum significantly reduces postoperative pain and narcotic use after LVHR.

METHODS A post hoc analysis of the erythropoietin in traumatic brain injury (EPO-TBI) trial that included twice-weekly lower limb ultrasound screening. Venous thrombotic events were defined as ultrasound-proven proximal deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or clinically detected pulmonary embolism (PE). Results are reported as events, percentages or medians and interquartile range (IQR). Cox regression analysis was used to calculate adjusted hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for time to VTE and death. RESULTS Of 603 patients, 119 (19.7%) developed VTE, mostly comprising DVT (102 patients, 16.9%) with a smaller number of PE events (24 patients, 4.0%). Median time to DVT diagnosis was 6 days (IQR 2-11) and to PE diagnosis 6.5 days (IQR 2-16.5). Mechanical prophylaxis (MP) was used in 91% of patients on day 1, 97% of patients on day 3 and 98% of patients on day 7. Pharmacological prophylaxis was given in 5% of patients on day 1, 30% of patients on day 3 and 57% of patients on day 7. Factors associated with time to VTE were age (HR per year 1.02, 95% CI 1.01-1.03), patient weight (HR per kg 1.01, 95% CI 1-1.02) and TBI severity according to the International Mission for Prognosis and Analysis of Clinical Trials risk of poor outcome (HR per 10% increase 1.12, 95% CI 1.01-1.25). The development of VTE was not associated with mortality (HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.51-1.65). CONCLUSIONS Despite mechanical and pharmacological prophylaxis, VTE occurs in one out of every five patients with TBI treated in the ICU. Higher age, greater weight and greater severity of TBI increase the risk. The development of VTE was not associated with excess mortality.","Skrifvars, Markus B; Bailey, Michael; Presneill, Jeffrey; French, Craig; Nichol, Alistair; Little, Lorraine; Duranteau, Jacques; Huet, Olivier; Haddad, Samir; Arabi, Yaseen; McArthur, Colin; Cooper, D James; Bellomo, Rinaldo",Intensive care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00134-016-4655-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28028552/,0

RESULTS Current literature has demonstrated some favorable outcomes using many different products for application in the field of HPB surgery. However, critical findings exist demonstrating lack of reproducible efficacy or benefit. In all, many clinical trials have demonstrated effectiveness of fibrin sealants and other agents at reducing the need for intraoperative and postoperative blood transfusion. Ability to effectively seal tissues providing biliostatic effect or preventing postoperative fistula formation remains debated as definitive evidence is lacking. CONCLUSIONS In the following invited review, we discuss current literature describing the use of topical agents and fibrin sealants in liver and pancreas surgery. We summarize major contemporary clinical trials and their findings regarding the use of these agents in HPB surgery and provide evidence from the preclinical literature as to the translation of these products into the clinical arena.","Hanna, Erin M; Martinie, John B; Swan, Ryan Z; Iannitti, David A",Langenbeck's archives of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00423-014-1215-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24880346/,0

98204,Lockdown dilemma: ingestion of magnetic beads presenting as right iliac fossa pain and subacute small bowel obstruction.,2020-11-04,"BACKGROUND Complete reduction of an indirect inguinal hernia sac during laparoscopic totally extraperitoneal (TEP) repair is not always possible when the sac extends to the scrotum or adheres to adjacent tissues. Laparoscopic TEP repair would be much easier to perform in such cases by transecting the hernia sac. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the safety and efficacy of transection of the hernia sac during laparoscopic TEP. MATERIALS AND METHODS Five hundred twenty laparoscopic TEP repairs were performed on 498 patients by a single surgeon from July 2003 to December 2008. The patients were classified into two groups: the transected sac (TS) group with 269 patients (275 cases) and the completely reduced sac (RS) group with 230 patients (245 cases). RESULTS Statistical analysis between the TS and RS groups showed no significant differences in postoperative pain, length of hospital stay, and recurrence, except for postoperative seromas, which were more frequent in the TS group (24 of 275) than the RS group (6 of 245; P = .002). And the mean operative time was longer in the TS group (23.62 ± 10.25 minutes) than the RS group (21.49 ± 8.17 minutes; P = .010). CONCLUSION Although transection of the hernia sac during laparoscopic TEP repair may cause seromas, our study demonstrated that transection of the hernia sac did not cause significant postoperative complications, including recurrence. Transection of the hernia sac is an alternative technique for laparoscopic TEP repair in cases with difficult hernia sac reduction.","Choi, Yoon Young; Kim, Zisun; Hur, Kyung Yul",Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

99717,Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis associated to COVID-19 in a kidney transplant recipient.,2020-11-13,"OBJECTIVE To compare the incidence of iatrogenic ureteral injury between laparoscopic and open colectomies at a single institution. DESIGN From June 1, 2005, through July 31, 2010, patients were identified from a prospectively maintained database and hospital records were retrospectively reviewed. SETTING Mount Sinai Medical Center. PATIENTS Fourteen patients who underwent colectomy complicated by a ureteral injury. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES A significant increase in ureteral injuries occurred after laparoscopic vs open procedures (0.66% vs 0.15%, P = .007). RESULTS A total of 5729 colectomies were performed during the study period. Fourteen ureteral injuries occurred, resulting in a 0.244% incidence of iatrogenic ureteral injury. Patient demographics demonstrated that 9 injuries (64%) occurred in females and 7 patients (50%) had undergone prior abdominal operations. Operative indications were inflammatory bowel disease (n = 7), diverticulitis (n = 2), and malignant neoplasm (n = 4). Thirteen operations (87%) in this study were elective colectomies, and 7 patients (50%) underwent laparoscopic procedures, with 2 open conversions. Of the 5729 colectomies, 4669 were open and 1060 laparoscopic. Regarding ureteral injuries, no difference was observed in intraoperative identification of ureteral injury in patients who underwent preoperative ureteral stent placement (n = 4) vs those who did not (50% [2 of 4] vs 50% [5 of 10]). CONCLUSIONS A significant increase was found in the incidence of iatrogenic ureteral injuries with laparoscopy compared with open colectomies. Preoperative stent placement did not ensure intraoperative identification of injury. Female sex and increased operative blood loss appear to predispose patients to injury.","Palaniappa, Nandini C; Telem, Dana A; Ranasinghe, Nalin E; Divino, Celia M",Archives of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1001/archsurg.2011.2029; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22430909/,0
101056,Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 infection in adult solid organ transplant recipients in Singapore.,2010,"OBJECTIVE Anxiety is common in older adults with cancer (OACs) and their caregivers and is associated with poor outcomes including worse physical symptoms, poor treatment adherence and response, and longer hospitalizations. This study examined the feasibility, acceptability, adherence, and preliminary efficacy of a cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) intervention for OACs and their caregivers. METHOD Patients with active cancer age 65 years and older and their caregivers were randomized to Managing Anxiety from Cancer (MAC), a seven-session CBT-based psychotherapy intervention delivered over the telephone or usual care. Patients and caregivers completed the intervention separately with licensed social workers. Self-report measures of anxiety, depression, and quality of life were administered after randomization and following intervention completion. Analyses were conducted separately for patients and caregivers and at the dyad level. Hierarchical Linear Modeling accounted for the within-dyad intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) by random intercepts associated with the dyads. RESULTS Twenty-nine dyads were randomized; 28 (96.6%) patients and 26 (89.7%) caregivers completed all study procedures. Of dyads randomized to MAC, 85.7% (n = 12) of patients and caregivers completed all seven sessions. Most patients (≥50%) and over 80% of caregivers rated the overall intervention and intervention components as ""moderately"" to ""very"" helpful. MAC was associated with a greater reduction in anxiety among dyads than usual care, the effect of MAC was greater in caregivers than in patients, and improvement in patient anxiety was associated with the reduction in caregiver anxiety. However, these results did not reach statistical significance. SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS This pilot study demonstrates the feasibility of MAC and suggests strategies for improving acceptability, with a focus on adherence. Furthermore, these results indicate that MAC is promising for the reduction of anxiety in OAC-caregiver dyads and may be particularly beneficial for OAC caregivers. Larger randomized controlled trials are needed to evaluate the efficacy of MAC.","Trevino, Kelly M; Stern, Amy; Hershkowitz, Robin; Kim, Soo Young; Li, Yuelin; Lachs, Mark; Prigerson, Holly G",Palliative & supportive care,https://doi.org/10.1017/s1478951521000286; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33818370/,0

105222,The impacts of COVID-19 preventive and control interventions on other infectious diseases in China.,2021-05-03,"This Review focuses on the changing epidemiology of infections among patients with end-stage renal disease who are undergoing dialysis. In particular, bloodstream infections related to vascular access in patients undergoing hemodialysis, and peritonitis in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis, are highlighted. Gram-positive (staphylococcal and enterococcal) bloodstream infections and Gram-negative peritonitis (especially extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing organisms) contribute substantially to excess health-care use owing to infection caused by dialysis access. Although the management of peritoneal-dialysis-related peritonitis has been hampered by a dearth of randomized, controlled studies, epidemiological data have provided useful information. To overcome the problem of differing methods used to monitor infections within various dialysis centers, uniform reporting systems for vascular-access-related infection and peritoneal-dialysis-related peritonitis, as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis, respectively, are discussed. Infections unrelated to the port of entry for dialysis are also examined, namely hepatitis and respiratory infection.

107121,"Unilateral lung agenesis, hiatal hernia and atrioventricular septal defect: a rare combination of congenital anomalies.",2018,"Omics technologies are widely used in biomedical research. Precision medicine focuses on individual-level disease treatment and prevention. Here, we propose the usage of the term 'precision omics' to represent the combinatorial strategy that applies omics to translate large-scale molecular omics data for precision disease understanding and accurate disease diagnosis, treatment and prevention. Given the complexity of both omics and precision medicine, precision omics requires standardized representation and integration of heterogeneous data types. Ontology has emerged as an important artificial intelligence component to become critical for standard data and metadata representation, standardization and integration. To support precision omics, we propose a precision omics ontology hypothesis, which hypothesizes that the effectiveness of precision omics is positively correlated with the interoperability of ontologies used for data and knowledge integration. Therefore, to make effective precision omics studies, interoperable ontologies are required to standardize and incorporate heterogeneous data and knowledge in a human- and computer-interpretable manner. Methods for efficient development and application of interoperable ontologies are proposed and illustrated. With the interoperable omics data and knowledge, omics tools such as OmicsViz can also be evolved to process, integrate, visualize and analyze various omics data, leading to the identification of new knowledge and hypotheses of molecular mechanisms underlying the outcomes of diseases such as COVID-19. Given extensive COVID-19 omics research, we propose the strategy of precision omics supported by interoperable ontologies, accompanied with ontology-based semantic reasoning and machine learning, leading to systematic disease mechanism understanding and rational design of precision treatment and prevention. SHORT ABSTRACT Precision medicine focuses on individual-level disease treatment and prevention. Precision omics is a new strategy that applies omics for precision medicine research, which requires standardized representation and integration of individual genetics and phenotypes, experimental conditions, and data analysis settings. Ontology has emerged as an important artificial intelligence component to become critical for standard data and metadata representation, standardization and integration. To support precision omics, interoperable ontologies are required in order to standardize and incorporate heterogeneous data and knowledge in a human- and computer-interpretable manner. With the interoperable omics data and knowledge, omics tools such as OmicsViz can also be evolved to process, integrate, visualize and analyze various omics data, leading to the identification of new knowledge and hypotheses of molecular mechanisms underlying disease outcomes. The precision COVID-19 omics study is provided as the primary use case to illustrate the rationale and implementation of the precision omics strategy.","Wang, Zhigang; He, Yongqun",Briefings in functional genomics,https://doi.org/10.1093/bfgp/elab029; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34159360/,0

A growing body of literature has found a significant amount of evidence on the long-term adverse effects of infectious diseases, such as influenza, typhoid fever, and yellow fever. However, we must be careful about the fact that little is known about the long-term consequences of the acute diarrheal disease pandemic cholera - Vibrio cholerae bacillus - which still threatens the health of the population in many developing countries. To bridge this gap in the body of knowledge, we utilized unique census-based data on army height at age 20 in early 20th-century Japan, with a difference-in-differences estimation strategy using regional variation in the intensity of cholera pandemics. We found that early-life exposure to a cholera pandemic had heterogeneous stunting effects on the final height of men; the magnitude of the stunting effects increased as the intensity of exposure increased.","Ogasawara, Kota; Inoue, Tatsuki",Economics and human biology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ehb.2020.100968; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33582501/,0

110614,Personal Protective Equipment for Infectious Disease Preparedness: A Human Factors Evaluation.,2016,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Parent artery occlusion has long been considered the reference treatment for large/giant or fusiform aneurysms of the carotid siphon. However, meager recent data exist on this technique, which tends to be replaced by stent-assisted reconstructive techniques. In our department since 2004, we have assessed the safety, efficacy, and complication risk factors of parent artery occlusion by using coils for trapping these aneurysms. MATERIALS AND METHODS We determined retrospectively the complication rate, factors associated with the occurrence of an ischemic event, changes in symptoms of mass effect, evolution of the aneurysmal size, and the growth of an additional aneurysm after treatment. RESULTS Fifty-six consecutive patients were included, with a median age of 54 years (range, 25-85 years; 92% women), 48% with giant aneurysms and 75% with infraclinoid aneurysms. There was a permanent morbidity rate of 5% exclusively due to ischemia, a zero mortality rate, an aneurysmal retraction rate of 91%, and an improvement rate for pain of 98% and for cranial nerve palsy of 72%, with a median follow-up of >3 years. Para-/supraclinoid topography of the aneurysm (P = .043) and the presence of cardiovascular risk factors (P = .024) were associated with an excessive risk of an ischemic event, whereas the presence of a mural thrombus had a protective role (P = .033). CONCLUSIONS In this study, parent artery occlusion by using coils to treat large/giant or fusiform aneurysms of the carotid siphon was safe and effective, especially for giant infraclinoid aneurysms. According to recent meta-analyses, these results suggest that the validation of stent-assisted reconstructive treatments for these aneurysms requires controlled studies with parent occlusion artery.","Labeyrie, M-A; Lenck, S; Bresson, D; Desilles, J-P; Bisdorff, A; Saint-Maurice, J-P; Houdart, E",AJNR.

We aimed to determine the incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) in patients who were intubated with the PneuX System and to establish whether intermittent subglottic secretion drainage could be performed reliably and safely using the PneuX System. FINDINGS In this retrospective observational study, data was collected from 53 sequential patients. Nine (17%) patients were initially intubated with the PneuX System and 44 (83%) patients underwent elective exchange to the PneuX System. There were no episodes of VAP while the PneuX System was in situ. On an intention to treat basis, the incidence VAP was 1.8%. There were no complications from, or failure of, subglottic secretion drainage during the study. CONCLUSIONS Our study demonstrates that a low incidence of VAP is possible using the PneuX System. Our study also demonstrates that elective exchange and intermittent subglottic secretion drainage can be performed reliably and safely using the PneuX System.","Doyle, Alex; Fletcher, Andrew; Carter, Joseph; Blunt, Mark; Young, Peter",BMC research notes,https://doi.org/10.1186/1756-0500-4-92; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21450078/,0

112181,The forced renaissance of telemedicine during COVID-19: A fellow-in-training's perspective.,2021-02-01,"The distribution pattern of host proteases and their cleavage specificity for viral fusion glycoproteins are key determinants for viral tissue tropism and pathogenicity. The discovery of this protease-dependent virus tropism and pathogenicity has been triggered by the leading studies of the host-induced or -controlled modification of viruses by Homma et al. in 1970s. With the introduction of advanced protein analysis method, the observations by Homma et al. have been clearly explained by the cleavage activation of viral fusion glycoproteins by proteases. The molecular biological features of viruses, which show distinct protease specificity or dependency, have been also revealed by newly introduced nucleotide and molecular analysis method. Highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIVs) have multi-basic cleavage motif in the hemagglutinin (HA) protein and are activated proteolytically by furin. Furin is ubiquitously expressed in eukaryotic cells and thereby HPAIVs have the potential to cause a systemic infection in infected animals. On the other hand, the HA cleavage site of low pathogenic avian influenza viruses (LPAIVs) and seasonal human influenza viruses is mono-basic and thus not recognized by furin. They are likely cleaved by protease(s) localized in specific organs or tissues. However, the protease(s), which cleaves mono-basic HA in vivo, has long been undetermined, although many proteases have been shown as candidates. Finally, recent studies using gene knocked out mice revealed that TMPRSS2, a member of type II transmembrane serine proteases, is responsible for the cleavage of influenza viruses with a mono-basic HA in vivo. A subsequent study further demonstrated that TMPRSS2 contributes to replication and pathology of emerging SARS- and MERS coronaviruses in vivo.","Takeda, Makoto",Uirusu,https://doi.org/10.2222/jsv.69.61; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32938895/,0

This review summarizes the latest developments and current evidence for the use of NIRS in the noncardiac intraoperative setting. RECENT FINDINGS Unanticipated intraoperative physiological disturbances and a substantial interpatient variability in the limits of cerebral autoregulation, pose our patients at risk for adverse cerebral outcome, if the brain is not monitored specifically. In addition to a means to monitor the brain, NIRS has been shown to allow an estimate of overall organ oxygenation. Preliminary data suggest a relationship between cerebral desaturation and both neurologic and major organ morbidity. SUMMARY NIRS offers noninvasive monitoring of cerebral and overall organ oxygenation in a wide range of clinical scenarios. There is an increasing evidence that the optimized cerebral oxygenation is associated with improved outcomes in both neurologic and major organ morbidity in a variety of surgical settings.","Moerman, Anneliese; De Hert, Stefan",Current opinion in anaesthesiology,https://doi.org/10.1097/aco.0000000000000256; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26418554/,0

Monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (M-MDSC) are T cell suppressors that expand in inflammatory conditions, but their role in acute respiratory infections remains unclear. We studied blood and airways of COVID-19 patients across disease severity at multiple timepoints. M-MDSC frequencies were elevated in blood but not in nasopharyngeal or endotracheal aspirates of COVID-19 patients compared to controls. M-MDSCs isolated from COVID-19 patients suppressed T cell proliferation and IFNg production partly via an arginase-1 (Arg-1) dependent mechanism. Furthermore, patients showed increased Arg-1 and IL-6 plasma levels. COVID-19 patients had fewer T cells, and displayed downregulated expression of the CD3ζ chain. Ordinal regression showed that early M-MDSC frequency predicted subsequent disease severity. In conclusion, M-MDSCs expand in blood of COVID-19 patients, suppress T cells and strongly associate with disease severity, suggesting a role for M-MDSCs in the dysregulated COVID-19 immune response.","Falck-Jones, Sara; Vangeti, Sindhu; Yu, Meng; Falck-Jones, Ryan; Cagigi, Alberto; Badolati, Isabella; Österberg, Björn; Lautenbach, Maximilian Julius; Ahlberg, Eric; Lin, Ang; Lepzien, Rico; Szurgot, Inga; Lenart, Klara; Hellgren, Fredrika; Maecker, Holden T; Sälde, Jörgen; Albert, Jan; Johansson, Niclas; Bell, Max; Lore, Karin; Färnert, Anna; Smed-Sörensen, Anna",The Journal of clinical investigation,https://doi.org/10.1172/jci144734; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33492309/,0

Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced lung injury is the most widely used experimental ALI model and provides opportunities for new targeting therapy. In this study, we investigated the effects of tocilizumab, adalimumab, and methylprednisolone in LPS-induced acute lung injury. MATERIALS AND METHODS Lung injury was established by intratracheal instillation of LPS. The rats were randomly divided into six groups: LPS, control, and treatment groups (adalimumab, tocilizumab, methylprednisolone, and adalimumab + tocilizumab). Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and lung tissues were collected at 48 h and 96 h following LPS administration from each group. For histological analysis, hematoxylin?eosin (H&E) staining was performed. The sections were obtained for immunohistochemical analysis. IL-6 and TNF-? immunoreactivity were measured. RESULTS Intratracheal LPS application resulted in inflammatory cell infiltration of interstitial and alveolar spaces and thickening of the alveolar wall. All treatment groups showed signi?cantly amelioration compared to LPS at 48 h. Interestingly, adalimumab and adalimumab + tocilizumab groups showed a significant amelioration of the lung histoarchitecture, compared to the prednisolone group at 96 h (p=0.028, p=0.025, respectively). Compared to the control group, LPS stimulation resulted in a significant increase in IL-6 and TNF-? immunoreactivity (p<0.001). IL-6 and TNF-? expression were markedly reduced in all treatment groups at 48 h but the reduction was greater in the adalimumab and tocilizumab group than in the steroid. Administration with adalimumab and/or tocilizumab effectively decreased expression of TNF-? (p=0.001) and IL-6 (p<0.001) at 96 h, but prednisolone did not exert an effective decrease (p>0.05). CONCLUSION Adalimumab and/or tocilizumab significantly reduce the release of proinflammatory cytokines and improve the tissue inflammation in the experimental model of ALI. Our results suggest that adalimumab and/or tocilizumab have a more potent anti-inflammatory effect on lung injury than the steroid.","Sarioğlu, Nurhan; Sunay, Fatma Bahar; Yay, Arzu Hanim; Korkut, Oğuzhan; Erel, Fuat; Hişmioğullari, Adnan Adil; Köse, Mehmet; Yalçin, Betül",Turkish journal of medical sciences,https://doi.org/10.3906/sag-2010-303; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34217170/,0

Thus, recent theoretical studies have proposed that higher-rank magnetic multipoles formed by clusters of spins (cluster multipoles) can generate the AHE without magnetization. Despite such an intriguing proposal, controlling the unconventional AHE by inducing these cluster multipoles has not been investigated. Here, we demonstrate that strain can manipulate the hidden Berry curvature effect by inducing the higher-rank cluster multipoles in spin-orbit-coupled antiferromagnets. Observing the large AHE on fully strained antiferromagnetic Nd2Ir2O7 thin films, we prove that strain-induced cluster T 1-octupoles are the only source of observed AHE.

Evidence suggests that attentional control may protect those individuals with outcome-specific vulnerabilities from developing maladaptive psychological outcomes. In the present study, attentional control was examined as a moderator of the relation between COVID-19 stress and generalized anxiety symptoms in a community sample (N = 359 adults). As predicted, the relationship between COVID-19 stress and anxiety was moderated by attentional control. Specifically, as attentional control decreased, the strength of the association between COVID-19 stress and anxiety increased. The results suggest that, among those with higher levels of COVID-19 stress, attentional control may act as a protective factor against developing anxiety. It may be beneficial as a matter of standard public health guidance to recommend that the general public engages in activities that are known to improve attentional control and alleviate emotional distress (e.g., mindfulness-based techniques) at the outset of a pandemic or other global catastrophe to reduce the likelihood that prolonged event-related stress will lead to impairing anxiety.","Bardeen, Joseph R; Gorday, Julia Y; Clauss, Kate",Psychological reports,https://doi.org/10.1177/00332941211025260; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34120535/,0

Intracellular nanovesicles (INVs) are transport vesicles that are involved in multiple membrane trafficking steps, including the recycling pathway. The only known marker for INVs is tumor protein D54 (TPD54/TPD52L2), a member of the TPD52-like protein family. Overexpression of TPD52-like family proteins in cancer has been linked to poor prognosis and an aggressive metastatic phenotype, which suggests cell migration may be altered under these conditions. Here, we show that TPD54 directly binds membrane and associates with INVs via a conserved positively charged motif in its C terminus. We describe how other TPD52-like proteins are also associated with INVs, and we document the Rab GTPase complement of all INVs. Depletion of TPD52-like proteins inhibits cell migration and invasion, while their overexpression boosts motility. We show that inhibition of migration is likely due to altered recycling of α5β1 integrins in INVs.","Larocque, Gabrielle; Moore, Daniel J; Sittewelle, Méghane; Kuey, Cansu; Hetmanski, Joseph H R; La-Borde, Penelope J; Wilson, Beverley J; Clarke, Nicholas I; Caswell, Patrick T; Royle, Stephen J",The Journal of cell biology,https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.202009028; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34287617/,0

Life-Space Assessment (LSA) evaluates mobility considering interaction between person and environment. The International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) is a reference to identify and categorise the personal and environmental contextual factors associated to the LSA. Our objective is identifying contextual factors that may influence life-space mobility of older community-dwelling adults based on ICF. METHODS AND ANALYSIS A systematic review of literature will be performed to identify studies published between 1 January 2001 and 10 May 2017 which investigates life-space mobility among older adults. Keywords will be entered into the electronic databases of MEDLINE (PubMed), EMBASE (OVID), CINHAL (EBSCO), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials Cochrane Central (OVID), PsycINFO (EBSCO) and COCH (OVID). Five investigators will work on search databases and standardised screening of the articles. Mobility predictors will be separated into personal and environmental aspects, according to the ICF model. The results will be reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement, and then a meta-analysis will be performed, if applicable. DISCUSSION Knowledge about life-space mobility in community-dwelling older adults by examining related risk and protective aspects may help practitioners better approach older adults' mobility and prevent their decline in old age. Furthermore, researchers will have more clues for investigations into factors related to life-space mobility.

Long term immunosuppressive treatment may be required to minimize the consequences of the disease. METHODS In this retrospective study, we investigated the efficacy of rituximab (RTX) in MMP patients and compare the beneficial effects of early versus late administration of RTX. Medical records of 24 MMP patients who were treated with 500 mg RTX on day 1, then weekly for 4 consecutive week were reviewed. RESULTS Twenty-one patients (87.5%) reached disease control (DC) at the mean interval of 4.95 months (SD: 5.15; range: 1 - 24) after RTX. Complete remission (CR) with scarring was achieved in 45.8% (n = 11) and 33.3% (n = 8) attained CR without any residual scar (total CR with or without scar 79.1%). Two patients (8.3%) reached partial remission including persistent gingivitis. Only one patient progressed from non-cicatricial to cicatricial MMP despite receiving RTX. 47.6% (n = 10) of patients experienced relapse after achieving DC at a mean interval of 15.2 months (range: 6-30, SD: 7.0). Considerably, earlier the RTX was administered, sooner the DC was obtained (Pearson r= 0.742, p-value <0.001).

133252,Patient notification about suspected hospital-associated outbreaks of invasive mold infections: Considerations for public health and hospital personnel.,2021-06-10,"PURPOSE Percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (PRFA) has been used to ablate renal neoplasms with good outcome. However, if bowel lies adjacent to a tumor, ablation increases the risk of thermal bowel injury, and the consequences could be fatal. We describe the technique, effectiveness and safety of using thermo-sensitive hydrogel as insulation to displace the bowel away during PRFA. MATERIALS AND METHODS The study was divided into two main parts: the in vitro and in vivo studies. In in vitro study, to explore the heat insulation of hydrogel, the rabbit kidney was entirely embedded in hydrogel, and then radiofrequency ablation was performed; the temperature on the gel-air and gel-kidney interfaces was measured. In in vivo study, hydrogel of poloxamer 407, 25 % concentration (w/v), was instilled into the perinephric space of 10 rabbits under CT guidance to separate the kidney from adjacent bowel before PRFA performed in the targeted parenchyma in the gel group. For the control group, PRFA was performed in similar portions of 10 rabbits without instillation of hydrogel. Some parameters were recorded such as kidney-to-bowel and electrode-to-bowel distance. Immediately after PRFA, distribution of hydrogel was evaluated and the dimension of radiofrequency ablation zone was measured; bowel thermal injury was compared between the gel and control groups by gross anatomy and histopathological examination. To assess safety, two additional follow-up groups with 10 rabbits in each were set; after PRFA, CT scan was performed every 2 days; gel absorption, thermal damage and some other complications were evaluated during the period. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS In in vitro study, temperature was significantly lower at the gel-air than gel-kidney interface (P < .05), and the temperature gradient was positively associated with gel thickness. In in vivo study, hydrogel was instilled successfully in all rabbits in the gel group. The kidney-to-bowel and electrode-to-bowel distances were larger in the gel than control group [(1.1 ± 0.6 cm vs 0.1 ± 0.0 cm, P < .01), (1.8 ± 0.4 cm vs 0.5 ± 0.1 cm, P < .01), respectively]. The gel and control groups did not differ in size of the ablation zones (0.80 ± 0.2 cm vs 0.75 ± 0.3 cm, P > .05). Thermal injury in adjacent bowel was more serious in the control than gel group (P < .01). As for the follow-up, rabbits with gel instillation showed good condition and gel was absorbed gradually within 5 days. Those rabbits with no bowel displacement by gel got significantly lower survival rate and high complication rate (P < .01). CONCLUSION Hydrogel-dissection by means of thermo-sensitive hydrogel instillation is valuable for protecting the bowel adjacent to ablation area against thermal injury during PRFA.","Wang, Xin; Zhao, Xiaozhi; Lin, Tingsheng; Guo, Hongqian",International urology and nephrology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11255-016-1349-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27394136/,0

Quality-of-life (QOL) assessments provide a patient-reported estimate of well-being that may be clinically relevant. Although the sinonasal tract is integral to ESBS, the change in sinonasal-related QOL with ESBS has not been well studied. The aim of this study was to prospectively assess QOL before and after ESBS using validated outcome measures. METHODS Consecutive adult patients undergoing ESBS for anterior skull base lesions were prospectively enrolled from a tertiary referral center. Each patient was asked to complete the 22-item Sinonasal Outcome Test (SNOT-22) and the Anterior Skull Base Questionnaire (ASBQ) preoperatively, and again at 3 weeks, 6 weeks, 12 weeks, 6 months, and 1 year postoperatively. RESULTS Eighty-five patients were included for study, 44.7% of whom underwent ESBS for nonpituitary pathology. Mean SNOT-22 scores transiently worsened in the early postoperative period, and significantly improved at 1 year after surgery (p < 0.01). Gross-total tumor resection and use of autologous grafting materials were associated with improved SNOT-22 scores at later time points (p < 0.05). Type of reconstruction, tumor pathology, and functionality did not affect QOL scores. Correlation between SNOT-22 and ASBQ scores was good at all time points (r < -0.50). Cerebrospinal fluid leak and other complications were uncommon. CONCLUSION ESBS does not have a detrimental long-term effect and is associated with ultimate improvement in sinonasal-related QOL. Short-term impairments of sinonasal-related QOL are predictable and self-limited.

Methods Color photographs, fundus-autofluorescence images, and optical coherence tomography of 222 melanocytic choroidal tumors were reviewed. Each MOLES feature was retrospectively scored between 0 and 2 and tumors categorized as ""common nevus,"" ""low-risk nevus,"" ""high-risk nevus,"" and ""probable melanoma"" according to the total score. MOLES scores were compared with the experts' diagnosis of melanoma. Results The MOLES scoring system indicated melanoma in all 81 tumors diagnosed as such by ocular oncologists (100% sensitivity) and nevus in 135 of 141 tumors given this diagnosis by these experts (95.7% specificity).

135517,"Dysphagia, dysphonia and a deviated tongue: diagnosing Collet-Sicard syndrome.",2021-05-21,"AIMS The introduction of non-VKA oral anticoagulants (NOACs), which differ from the earlier vitamin K antagonist (VKA) treatments, has changed the approach to stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation (AF). GLORIA-AF is a prospective, global registry programme describing the selection of antithrombotic treatment in newly diagnosed AF patients at risk of stroke. It comprises three phases: Phase I, before the introduction of NOACs; Phase II, during the time of the introduction of dabigatran, the first NOAC; and Phase III, once NOACs have been established in clinical practice. METHODS AND RESULTS In Phase I, 1063 patients were eligible from the 1100 enrolled (54.3% male; median age 70 years); patients were from China (67.1%), Europe (EU; 27.4%), and the Middle East (ME; 5.6%). The majority of patients using VKAs had high stroke risk (CHA2DS2-VASc ≥ 2; 86.5%); 13.5% had moderate risk (CHA2DS2-VASc = 1). Vitamin K antagonist use was higher for persistent/permanent AF (47.7%) than that for paroxysmal (23.9%). Most patients in China were treated with antiplatelet agents (53.7%) vs. 27.1% in EU and 28.8% in ME. In China, 25.9% of patients had no antithrombotic therapy, vs. 8.6% in EU and 8.5% in ME. CONCLUSION Phase I of GLORIA-AF shows that VKAs were mostly used in patients with persistent/permanent (vs. paroxysmal) AF and in those with high stroke risk. Furthermore, there were meaningful geographical differences in the use of VKA therapy in the era before the availability of NOACs, including a much lower use of VKAs in China, where most patients either received antiplatelet agents or no antithrombotic treatment.","Huisman, Menno V; Ma, Chang Sheng; Diener, Hans-Christoph; Dubner, Sergio J; Halperin, Jonathan L; Rothman, Kenneth J; Teutsch, Christine; Schoof, Nils; Kleine, Eva; Bartels, Dorothee B; Lip, Gregory Y H","Europace : European pacing, arrhythmias, and cardiac electrophysiology : journal of the working groups on cardiac pacing, arrhythmias, and cardiac cellular electrophysiology of the European Society of Cardiology",https://doi.org/10.1093/europace/euw073; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27335063/,0

138577,Serologic Evaluation of MERS Screening Strategy for Healthcare Personnel During a Hospital-Associated Outbreak.,2017,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Even a single bout of aerobic exercise (AE) enhances corticospinal excitability (CSE), a biomarker of neuroplasticity. Because neurodegeneration limits capacity for neuroplasticity, it is not clear whether AE would induce CSE changes in people with progressive multiple sclerosis (MS). METHODS People with progressive MS (n = 10) requiring ambulatory assistive devices completed a graded maximal exercise test. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry was used to quantify body fat and lean mass. Before and following one 40-minute AE session using body weight-supported (<10% support) treadmill at moderate intensity, CSE was measured using transcranial magnetic stimulation. Variables included resting and active motor thresholds, motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitudes, recruitment curves, and length of the cortical silent period (CSP). RESULTS Aerobic exercise reduced inhibition (shorter CSP) and increased excitation (increased MEP amplitude) only in the hemisphere corresponding to the stronger hand. Controlling for age, higher fitness and lower body fat significantly predicted exercise-induced reduction in resting motor threshold (ΔR = +0.458, P = 0.046) and CSP (ΔR = +0.568, P = 0.030), respectively. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS Despite high levels of disability, capacity for exercise-induced neuroplasticity was retained among people with progressive MS. The hemisphere contralateral to the weaker hand was resistant to exercise-induced CSE changes, suggesting less neuroplastic potential. Lower fitness and higher body fat were associated with diminished exercise-induced CSE benefits, suggesting that therapists should consider interventions aimed at improving fitness and combating sedentarism to ultimately enhance the benefits of exercise on the brain.Video Abstract available for more insights from the authors (see the Video, Supplemental Digital Content 1, available at: http://links.lww.com/JNPT/A302).","Chaves, Arthur R; Devasahayam, Augustine J; Kelly, Liam P; Pretty, Ryan W; Ploughman, Michelle",Journal of neurologic physical therapy : JNPT,https://doi.org/10.1097/npt.0000000000000308; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32168157/,0
139325,Association between angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers and community acquired pneumonia: a nationwide population propensity-score matching study.,2021-06-09,"Objective: This study analyzed and compared the results of adaptive optics (AO) and fundus autofluorescence (FAF) in various maculopathies. Methods: The study included four different types of maculopathy: central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC), retinitis pigmentosa (RP), Stargardt disease (STGD) and phototoxic retinopathy. In all four cases, cone mosaic and cone density were obtained using AO fundus camera. Further, the high-resolution images were compared with the FAF and optical coherence tomography (OCT) results. Results: In CSC, FAF and AO, changes could be shown in the macula even two years after the subretinal fluid resorption, as opposed to a normal OCT. The improvement of FAF and cone mosaic appearance was concomitant with the visual acuity growth. Several cone mosaic phenotypes were observed in RP and STGD. In RP, the cone density was 24.240 cones /mm2 in the center, and decreased to 8.163 cones/ mm2 in the parafoveal area. In STGD, the cone density was lower in the center, 9.219 cones/ mm2, and higher at the periphery, 12.594 cones/ mm2. In the case of phototoxic retinopathy, AO and OCT were more effective than FAF in highlighting the photoreceptor and retinal pigment epithelium lesions. Conclusions: FAF and AO are very useful tools in macular pathologies examination. FAF can offer a true picture of the metabolic changes in the macula, while AO allows the view of changes up to the cellular level.

METHODS Between January 2013 and December 2014, all consecutive TURP candidates with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) were prospectively randomized 1:1 into M-TURP/B-TURP arms and followed up at 2, and 4 weeks, 6 and 12 months after surgery. All patients were assessed using IIEF-15 (International index of erectile function-15) and Ej-MSHQ (ejaculatory domain-male sexual-health inventory). Changes in IIEF-15, its subdomains and Ej-MSHQ scores were compared between both intervention groups. RESULTS Following M.TURP and B.TURP; 122 and 124 patients were included respectively and were considered for analysis at 1 year. Sexual function did not differ significantly between arms during follow-up (erectile function, P = 0.82; orgasmic function, P = 0.46; sexual desire, P = 0.29; intercourse satisfaction, P = 0.18; overall satisfaction, P = 0.92). There were no differences between arms in the distribution of EF evolution at any time compared with base line (at 12 months: M-TURP vs. B-TURP = improved, 24.5 vs. 26.6%; stable, 66.4 vs. 64.5%; deteriorated, 9.1 vs. 8.9%; P = 0.41). Newly developed erectile dysfunction (ED) was present in 8.2 and 7.3% of patients following M.TURP and B.TURP respectively and was related to presence of DM and obesity. Orgasm perception significantly reduced following M.TURP and B.TURP (P < 0.001). Newly reported ejaculatory dysfunction (Ej-MSHQ < 22) was significantly associated with low orgasm perception.

METHODS 70 PD catheters which were implanted by transplant surgeons in 61 children (median age 3.3years, range 0.01-15.5years, 31 boys and 30 girls) in 2009-2014 were retrospectively reviewed. The incidence of complications and revisions during the first 6months after implantation was analyzed depending on children's weight and diagnosis. RESULTS 17 out of 70 catheters needed a surgical revision within 6months after implantation (24.3%). Peritonitis was the most common complication affecting 18.6% of peritoneal dialysis catheters followed by obstruction and dislocation, which it occurred in 9 (12.9%) and 7 (10%) catheters, respectively. Leakage (n=5) only occurred in children with a weight of less than 10kg. The total proportion of complications was higher in children with less than 10kg of weight (P<0.001). CONCLUSION PD is safe in children with acute renal failure and older children with chronic renal failure; however children with a weight of less than 10kg are more likely to develop complications.","Radtke, Josephine; Lemke, Anja; Kemper, Markus J; Nashan, Bjoern; Koch, Martina",Journal of pediatric surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpedsurg.2015.12.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26775194/,0

Determine optimal scanning conditions for currently-used applicators. MATERIALS AND METHODS Eleven applicators were placed in ex vivo cow livers with implanted mock tumors, surrounded by bolus gel. Various computed tomography scans were performed at 440 mA with 5 mm thickness changing kVp (80, 100, 120, 140), scan time (0.5, 0.7, 1.0, 2.0 seconds), adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction (ASiR) (30, 60, 90), scan type (helical, axial), pitch (0.5, 0.94, 1.37, 1.75), and reconstruction algorithm (soft, standard, lung). Two radiologists blindly scored the images for image quality and artifact quantitatively. RESULTS Cool-tip single (CTS) RF electrode (Covidien) performed significantly better than all other devices in both perceived image quality and artifact while Boston Scientific 4.0 RF electrode (Boston Scientific) underperformed (all P < 0.001), when not controlling for any other factors. An effect for artifact (P < 0.001) was found for kVp and device: for most conditions, 80 kVp was rated significantly lower than all other levels, whereas 120 and 140 performed significantly better than 100 and 80. No significant effect with ASiR level and device was found for the artifact. There was an effect observed for artifact (P < 0.001) between scan time and probe: for most devices, 0.5 seconds was rated significantly lower than all other scan times, but CTS was resilient-showing no difference from other scan times. Algorithm did not show any significant effects. Taking into account ASiR, kVp, and time, CTS outperformed all other devices. CONCLUSIONS Higher kVp and scan times reduce device artifacts. It appears that CTS performs the best, even when considering ASiR, kVp, pitch, scan type, and scan time.","Eltorai, Adam E M; Baird, Grayson L; Monu, Nicholas; Bialo, Darren; Collins, Scott; Kim, Jeom Soon; Dupuy, Damian E",Journal of computer assisted tomography,https://doi.org/10.1097/rct.0000000000000512; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27824668/,0

We evaluated the role of screening for PA in all patients referred for a diagnostic sleep study without selecting for prior diagnoses with these conditions. Plasma aldosterone and renin concentration were measured after an overnight polysomnography. Blood pressure was measured at the sleep center for all patients, while a proportion underwent 24-hour blood pressure monitoring. Of the 85 participating patients, 2 (2.4%) were identified to have likely PA based on an elevated aldosterone:renin ratio and/or clinical characteristics. Another 10 (11.8%) were identified to have possible PA based on their low or normal plasma renin concentration despite taking antihypertensive medications that are known to elevate renin. In participants with both obstructive sleep apnea and hypertension (n=40), the prevalence of likely or possible PA was 30%. However, there was no correlation between aldosterone, rennin, or aldosterone:renin ratio and the apnea-hypopnea index using multiple regression analysis adjusted for interfering medications and hypertension status. The observed high prevalence of possible PA among those with both hypertension and obstructive sleep apnea suggests that they should be routinely screened for PA.","Chee, Min Ru; Hoo, Jesse; Libianto, Renata; Gwini, Stella M; Hamilton, Garun; Narayan, Om; Young, Morag J; Fuller, Peter J; Yang, Jun",Hypertension,https://doi.org/10.1161/hypertensionaha.120.16902; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33896193/,0

150263,Nocardia farcinica masquerading as intracerebral metastases in advanced metastatic prostatic cancer.,2020-09-07,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE In patients with cryptogenic stroke and patent foramen ovale (PFO), the Risk of Paradoxical Embolism (RoPE) Score has been proposed as a method to estimate a patient-specific ""PFO-attributable fraction""-the probability that a documented PFO is causally-related to the stroke, rather than an incidental finding. The objective of this research is to examine the relationship between this RoPE-estimated PFO-attributable fraction and the effect of closure in 3 randomized trials. METHODS We pooled data from the CLOSURE-I (Evaluation of the STARFlex Septal Closure System in Patients With a Stroke and/or Transient Ischemic Attack due to Presumed Paradoxical Embolism through a Patent Foramen Ovale), RESPECT (Randomized Evaluation of Recurrent Stroke Comparing PFO Closure to Established Current Standard of Care Treatment), and PC (Clinical Trial Comparing Percutaneous Closure of Patent Foramen Ovale [PFO] Using the Amplatzer PFO Occluder With Medical Treatment in Patients With Cryptogenic Embolism) trials. We examine the treatment effect of closure in high RoPE score (≥7) versus low RoPE score (<7) patients. We also estimated the relative risk reduction associated with PFO closure across each level of the RoPE score using Cox proportional hazard analysis. We estimated a patient-specific attributable fraction using a PC trial-compatible (9-point) RoPE equation (omitting the neuroradiology variable), as well as a 2-trial analysis using the original (10-point) RoPE equation. We examined the Pearson correlation between the estimated attributable fraction and the relative risk reduction across RoPE strata. RESULTS In the low RoPE score group (<7, n=912), the rate of recurrent strokes per 100 person-years was 1.37 in the device arm versus 1.68 in the medical arm (hazard ratio,0.82 [0.42-1.59] P=0.56) compared with 0.30 versus 1.03 (hazard ratio,0.31 [0.11-0.85] P=0.02) in the high RoPE score group (≥7, n=1221); treatment-by-RoPE score group interaction, P=0.12. The RoPE score estimated attributable fraction anticipated the relative risk reduction across all levels of the RoPE score, in both the 3-trial (r=0.95, P<0.001) and 2-trial (r=0.92, P<0.001) analyses. CONCLUSIONS The RoPE score estimated attributable fraction is highly correlated to the relative risk reduction of device versus medical therapy. This observation suggests the RoPE score identifies patients with cryptogenic stroke who are likely to have a PFO that is pathogenic rather than incidental.","Kent, David M; Saver, Jeffrey L; Ruthazer, Robin; Furlan, Anthony J; Reisman, Mark; Carroll, John D; Smalling, Richard W; Jüni, Peter; Mattle, Heinrich P; Meier, Bernhard; Thaler, David E",Stroke,https://doi.org/10.1161/strokeaha.120.029350; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32921262/,0

Here we demonstrate that metabolic reprogramming induced by mitochondrial fusion can be rate-limiting for immortalization of tumor-initiating cells (TICs) and trigger their irreversible dedication to tumorigenesis. Using single-cell transcriptomics, we find that Drosophila brain tumors contain a rapidly dividing stem cell population defined by upregulation of oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos). We combine targeted metabolomics and in vivo genetic screening to demonstrate that OxPhos is required for tumor cell immortalization but dispensable in neural stem cells (NSCs) giving rise to tumors. Employing an in vivo NADH/NAD+ sensor, we show that NSCs precisely increase OxPhos during immortalization. Blocking OxPhos or mitochondrial fusion stalls TICs in quiescence and prevents tumorigenesis through impaired NAD+ regeneration. Our work establishes a unique connection between cellular metabolism and immortalization of tumor-initiating cells.","Bonnay, François; Veloso, Ana; Steinmann, Victoria; Köcher, Thomas; Abdusselamoglu, Merve Deniz; Bajaj, Sunanjay; Rivelles, Elisa; Landskron, Lisa; Esterbauer, Harald; Zinzen, Robert P; Knoblich, Juergen A",Cell,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2020.07.039; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32916131/,0
150976,Selection of the ideal disinfectant.,2014,"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly spread worldwide since first reported. Timely diagnosis of COVID-19 is crucial both for disease control and patient care. Non-contrast thoracic computed tomography (CT) has been identified as an effective tool for the diagnosis, yet the disease outbreak has placed tremendous pressure on radiologists for reading the exams and may potentially lead to fatigue-related mis-diagnosis. Reliable automatic classification algorithms can be really helpful; however, they usually require a considerable number of COVID-19 cases for training, which is difficult to acquire in a timely manner. Meanwhile, how to effectively utilize the existing archive of non-COVID-19 data (the negative samples) in the presence of severe class imbalance is another challenge. In addition, the sudden disease outbreak necessitates fast algorithm development. In this work, we propose a novel approach for effective and efficient training of COVID-19 classification networks using a small number of COVID-19 CT exams and an archive of negative samples. Concretely, a novel self-supervised learning method is proposed to extract features from the COVID-19 and negative samples. Then, two kinds of soft-labels ('difficulty' and 'diversity') are generated for the negative samples by computing the earth mover's distances between the features of the negative and COVID-19 samples, from which data 'values' of the negative samples can be assessed. A pre-set number of negative samples are selected accordingly and fed to the neural network for training. Experimental results show that our approach can achieve superior performance using about half of the negative samples, substantially reducing model training time.","Li, Yuexiang; Dong, Wei; Chen, Jiawei; Cao, Shelei; Zhou, Hongyu; Zhu, Yanchun; Wu, Jianrong; Lan, Lan; Sun, Wenbo; Qian, Tianyi; Ma, Kai; Xu, Haibo; Zheng, Yefeng",IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics,https://doi.org/10.1109/jbhi.2020.3018181; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32816680/,0

153214,Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease as a cause of dementia.,2021-05-11,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES The objective of this study was to compare mesh contracture, adhesion characteristics, tissue ingrowth, and histologic response of Ventralight ST/SorbaFix (C.R. Bard/Davol, Warwick, RI, USA) with Physiomesh/Securestrap (Ethicon, Somerville, NJ, USA) in a porcine model of laparoscopic ventral hernia repair. METHODS Standard laparoscopic technique was used to bilaterally implant meshes in 10 female Yorkshire swine. Each animal received either two Ventralight ST meshes (oval shaped, 10.2 × 15.2 cm) or two Physiomesh meshes (oval shaped 10 × 15 cm), one on either side of the midline. The meshes were fixated to the intact peritoneum with either SorbaFix (for animals receiving Ventralight ST) or Securestrap (for animals receiving Physiomesh). There were 5 animals in each group, yielding 10 of each meshfixation combination. Mesh contracture, adhesion characteristics, tissue ingrowth, and histologic response were evaluated after 14 days by image analysis, mechanical testing, and histologic staining (hematoxylin-eosin, Masson trichrome, picrosirius red, and von Willebrand factor). RESULTS Ventralight ST/SorbaFix and Physiomesh/Securestrap exhibited a similar percentage of mesh contracture, percentage of adhesion coverage, adhesion tenacity, collagen deposition, and levels of necrosis (P > .05 in all cases). However, Ventralight ST/SorbaFix exhibited significantly less inflammation (P = .0001), fibrosis (P = .0017), hemorrhage (P = .0001), and angiogenesis (P = .0032) and significantly greater strength of tissue ingrowth (P = .0003) than Physiomesh/Securestrap after the 14-day implantation period. CONCLUSIONS Ventralight ST/SorbaFix exhibited more favorable strength of tissue ingrowth and histologic response and similar mesh contracture and adhesion characteristics compared with Physiomesh/Securestrap over a short-term 14-day implantation period in a preclinical porcine model.","Deeken, Corey R; Matthews, Brent D",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,https://doi.org/10.4293/108680813x13693422520125; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24398196/,0

METHODS A prospective comparative analysis was done in 300 patients in each arm who underwent laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and single-incision sleeve gastrectomy from September 2009 till January 2012. Both groups were matched for age and BMI. Postoperative pain scoring was done using visual analogue scale. Outcomes in terms of pain score, scar satisfaction score, excess weight loss, resolution of co-morbidities, and complications were compared in both groups at the end of 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years. RESULTS Female patients preferred to undergo single-incision sleeve gastrectomy. Operating time and intraoperative blood loss were comparable in both groups. Visual analogue scale (VAS) scoring revealed lesser postoperative pain in the single-incision group. Excess weight loss and resolution of co-morbidities were also comparable in both groups at 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years. Incisional hernia was seen in 3 patients (1%) in the single-incision group. Leak rate was comparable. Cosmetic satisfaction was superior in patients who underwent single-incision surgery. CONCLUSIONS Surgical outcomes are comparable in both groups at the end of 2 years. The myth of high long-term incisional hernia rate after single-incision surgery has been dispelled. Single-incision surgery is less painful with better cosmesis. It has come of age and should no longer be considered as an experimental procedure.","Lakdawala, Muffazal; Agarwal, Aditi; Dhar, Shilpa; Dhulla, Neha; Remedios, Carlyne; Bhasker, Aparna Govil",Obesity surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-014-1461-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25322809/,0

159151,Unusual aetiology of lymphocyte-predominant exudative pleural effusion: primary mediastinal actinomycosis.,2020-04-01,"Single-incision laparoscopic hepatic resection has been attracting increased attention from the surgical community in recent years. While there have been reports and studies on this procedure, none has suggested the possibility of doing repeated hepatic resections via a single incision. This report on three such cases aims to determine the feasibility and safety of this approach for such patients. Three patients who had previously had liver resections underwent single-incision laparoscopic hepatic resection in our center. Patient demographics, type of port and instruments used, operating time, complications and incision length were collected. The operating time in each case was less than 230 min. The incision length for the single-port device was 3.5 cm or less. The length of hospital stay was less than 5 days in each case. Intra-operative blood loss was limited to 250 mL in each case. There were no immediate postoperative complications related to hepatic resection. Single-incision laparoscopic hepatic resection is feasible for selected patients who have had previous hepatic resections. Because the port entry site for the single-incision laparoscopic approach is usually slightly larger than that for the conventional approach, it is safer in re-resection cases where there may be adhesions from previous surgery. Other possible benefits, such as cosmesis and reduced port-associated morbidity, are mainly related to the use of only one small incision.","Kim, Guowei; Lau, Arthur Chin-Haeng; Chang, Stephen Kin Yong",Asian journal of endoscopic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1111/ases.12072; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24450347/,0

We aimed to determine whether iodine concentration within contrast-stained parenchyma compared with an internal reference in the superior sagittal sinus on dual-energy CT could predict subsequent intracerebral hemorrhage. MATERIALS AND METHODS Seventy-one patients with small infarct cores (ASPECTS ≥ 7) and good endovascular recanalization (modified TICI 2b or 3) for anterior circulation large-vessel occlusion were included. Brain parenchymal iodine concentration as per dual-energy CT and the percentage of contrast staining relative to the superior sagittal sinus were recorded and correlated with the development of intracerebral hemorrhage using Mann-Whitney U and Fisher exact tests. RESULTS Forty-three of 71 patients had parenchymal hyperdensity on initial dual-energy CT. The median relative iodine concentration compared with the superior sagittal sinus was significantly higher in those with subsequent intracerebral hemorrhage (137.9% versus 109.2%, P = .007). By means of receiver operating characteristic analysis, a cutoff value of 100% (iodine concentration relative to the superior sagittal sinus) enabled identification of patients going on to develop intracerebral hemorrhage with 94.75% sensitivity, 43.4% specificity, and a likelihood ratio of 1.71. CONCLUSIONS Within our cohort of patients, the relative percentage of iodine concentration at dual-energy CT compared with the superior sagittal sinus was a reliable predictor of intracerebral hemorrhage development and may be a useful imaging biomarker for risk stratification after endovascular treatment.","Byrne, D; Walsh, J P; Schmiedeskamp, H; Settecase, F; Heran, M K S; Niu, B; Salmeen, A K; Rohr, B; Field, T S; Murray, N; Rohr, A",AJNR.

The current indication is progressive, mild to moderate, open angle glaucoma uncontrolled on topical medications. According to the literature, adverse events are rare, mild and transient. CASE PRESENTATION Two cases of stand-alone PreserFlo MicroShunt® implantation in patients with uncontrolled open-angle glaucoma are reported. Exposure occurred 7 days and 3 months respectively after implantation. These cases shared common features including preexisting blepharitis and the lack of a Tenon's flap. In both cases, removal of the device was required after several attempts at repair. CONCLUSIONS PreserFlo MicroShunt® exposure is a potentially vision-threatening complication because of the risk of endophthalmitis. Potential risk factors include the absence of a Tenon's flap and pre-existing ocular surface inflammation. Ocular surface inflammation should be detected and treated prior to PM implantation. If a deficiency in Tenon's capsule is noted intraoperatively, close monitoring should be performed because of the higher risk of PM exposure.","Bunod, Roxane; Robin, Mathieu; Buffault, Juliette; Keilani, Chafik; Labbé, Antoine; Baudouin, Christophe",BMC ophthalmology,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12886-021-02032-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34246229/,0

Several frailty assessment tools have been developed and validated for use in patients undergoing TAVR with varying complexity, clinical pragmatism and outcomes assessed. In contemporary TAVR practice, frailty assessment guides patient selection, informs care requirements, and identifies those who may require supplemental treatment. Further opportunities to improve patient care in this area include identification of interventions that can mitigate the deleterious impact of frailty, evaluation of the role of frailty assessment in low surgical risk patients, and development of frailty management models that can be delivered virtually. In this review, we aim to provide an overview of the concept of frailty, the available assessment tools, peri-procedural considerations in frail patients undergoing TAVR and future directions.","Chuang, M.

163890,SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in autoimmune diseases: The euro-covimid study,2021,"Drug development is a long, expensive and multistage process geared to achieving safe drugs with high efficacy. A crucial prerequisite for completing the medication regimen for oral drugs, particularly for pediatric and geriatric populations, is achieving taste that does not hinder compliance. Currently, the aversive taste of drugs is tested in late stages of clinical trials. This can result in the need to reformulate, potentially resulting in the use of more animals for additional toxicity trials, increased financial costs and a delay in release to the market. Here we present BitterIntense, a machine learning tool that classifies molecules into “very bitter” or “not very bitter”, based on their chemical structure. The model, trained on chemically diverse compounds, has above 80% accuracy on several test sets. BitterIntense suggests that intense bitterness does not correlate with toxicity and hepatotoxicity of drugs and that the prevalence of very bitter compounds among drugs is lower than among microbial compounds. BitterIntense allows quick and easy prediction of strong bitterness of compounds of interest for food and pharma industries. We estimate that implementation of BitterIntense or similar tools early in drug discovery and development process may lead to reduction in delays, in animal use and in overall financial burden. Significance Statement Drug development integrates increasingly sophisticated technologies, but extreme bitterness of drugs remains a poorly addressed cause of medicine regimen incompletion. Reformulating the drug can result in delays in the development of a potential medicine, increasing the lead time to the patients. It might also require the use of extra animals in toxicity trials and lead to increased costs for pharma companies. We have developed a computational predictor for intense bitterness, that has above 80% accuracy. Applying the classifier to annotated datasets suggests that intense bitterness does not correlate with toxicity and hepatotoxicity of drugs. BitterIntense can be used in the early stages of drug development to identify drug candidates that require bitterness masking, and thus reduce animal use, time and monetary loss.","Margulis, Eitan; Dagan-Wiener, Ayana; Ives, Robert S.; Jaffari, Sara; Siems, Karsten; Niv, Masha Y.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.24.168914,0

The threat of the virus has also caused a change in tourist travel consumption behavior. This study preliminarily examines the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the tourism consumption characteristics of Taiwanese people. The consumption characteristic changes of 393 people regarding their plans for domestic and outbound tourism during the different stages of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as after the pandemic ends were surveyed and collected. This study also examined and attempted to understand the relationship between people’s satisfaction with the government’s revitalization plan, the pandemic prevention policy, and their domestic tourism frequency during the pandemic period, and the results showed that during the pandemic, people’s tourism characteristics have changed and tend to be conservative. Since the pandemic is over, while there were no significant differences between people’s planned travel expenditures in Taiwan and those before the outbreak, their intended travel time was shortened. Regarding the choice of travel equipment, people had reduced the use of public transportation. Regarding outbound tourism, after the pandemic, as people’s planned travel days will be reduced, it is expected that travel expenditures will be significantly higher than before the pandemic, which shows that the COVID-19 pandemic has an impact on people’s outbound tourism consumption characteristics. During the pandemic, compared with the subsidies for tourism, how to make people feel at ease in the process of tourism is of great importance. Therefore, it is suggested that in the short-term, border control and social pandemic prevention policies should be adopted to enhance people’s confidence in government pandemic prevention, and the general public should be supplemented with travel subsidies in order to promote people’s enthusiasm for tourism. The results of this study provide useful suggestions for government units, tour operators, and related research during the pandemic and offer preliminary insights for the recovery of the tourism industry after the pandemic.","Kuo, Chung-Wei",Sustainability,https://doi.org/10.3390/su13179589,0

Pooled mean group (PMG) and dynamic fixed effect (DFE) models were applied. Hausman test result confirmed that DFE was preferred to PMG. The results confirmed the existence of a long-run equilibrium relationship between commercial banks' profitability and their determinants. In the short-run, banks' profitability in Jordan is positively related to return volatility. However, this is negatively related to credit risk and market concentration. In the long run, profitability is positively related to credit risk and negatively related to operational risk, bank size, stock market volatility, and market concentration. Credit risk and capital have bi-direction causality with banks' profitability, while GDP and market concentration have uni-direction causality. At present, the Jordanian economy during the Covid-19 pandemic triggered the banking sector's impact on the economy as the sector contributed to 20.8% GDP in 2019.

Therefore, understanding the precise molecular mechanisms that underpin plant fertility under environmental constraints is critical to safeguard future food production3. Here, we identified two Argonaute-like proteins whose activities are required to sustain male fertility in maize plants under high temperatures. We found that MALE-ASSOCIATED ARGONAUTE 1 and 2 (MAGO1 and MAGO2) associate with temperature-induced phased secondary small RNAs in pre-meiotic anthers and are essential to control the activity of retrotransposons in male meiocyte initials. Biochemical and structural analyses revealed how MAGO2 activity and its interaction with retrotransposon RNA targets are modulated through the dynamic phosphorylation of a set of highly conserved surface-located serine residues. Our results demonstrate that an Argonaute-dependent RNA-guided surveillance mechanism is critical in plants to sustain male fertility under environmentally constrained conditions by controlling the mutagenic activity of transposons in male germ cells.","Lee, Yang-Seok; Maple, Robert; Dürr, Julius; Dawson, Alexander; Tamim, Saleh; Genio, Charo del; Papareddy, Ranjith; Luo, Anding; Lamb, Jonathan C.; Sylvester, Anne W.; Birchler, James A.; Meyers, Blake C.; Nodine, Michael D.; Rouster, Jacques; Gutierrez-Marcos, Jose",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.03.324764,0

As vaccination progresses smoothly in many countries and the pandemic gradually gets under control, it is important that we understand its impact on the global economy to fully recover from the damage Covid-19 has caused. In this paper, we analyzed over 50000 records of pandemic data for over 200 countries to identify the important factors affecting the GDP per capita of the countries. We also proposed a method ensembling three machine learning models predict a country's GDP based on pandemic data. © 2021 IEEE.","Wu, Y.; Yang, Y.; Boshuai, Y.","2021 IEEE International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Industrial Design, AIID 2021",https://doi.org/10.1109/aiid51893.2021.9456539,0

Characterizations of the C84-D2:22 isomer in this study were performed by infrared and electronic absorption spectroscopy. All of the experimentally observed IR and UV/VIS bands were in excellent agreement with the semi-empirical, DFT and TB potential theoretical calculations for this molecule. The molar extinction coefficients and the integrated molar extinction coefficients of the observed larger number of completely separated infrared absorption maxima and shoulders of fullerene C84-D2:22, as well as of its main convoluted maxima, in different and new relevant entire integration ranges, including neighboring, and all surrounding absorption shoulders were determined and their relative intensities compared. In addition, the molar absorptivity of the electronic absorption bands of this carbon cluster was found. The new IR and UV/VIS spectroscopic parameters that are significant for the quantitative determination, identification and numerous possible applications of C84-D2:22 are obtained and their changes compared to C76-D2 observed. Isolated and characterized C84-D2:22, as well as other fullerenes from this research can be used in electronic, optical, chemical and biomedical devices, superconductors, semiconductors, batteries, catalysts, polymers, sensors, solar cells, nanophotonic lenses with better optical transmission, refraction and wettability, diagnostic and therapeutic pharmaceutical substances, such as those against diabetes, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, free radical scavenging, radio nuclear, antibacterial and antiviral agents that can inhibit HIV 1, HSV, COVID-19, influenza, malaria and so forth. © 2021 by the author.

193617,Infection in renal transplant recipients.,2007,"The 299E prototype strain of human coronavirus (HCV-229E) has so far been mainly associated with infections of the respiratory tract. In the present study, we show evidence for infection of the central nervous system (CNS) by HCV-229E, both in vitro and in vivo. Various human cell lines of CNS origin were tested for their susceptibility to infection by HCV-229E. Production of viral antigens was monitored by indirect immunofluorescence with monoclonal antibodies and infectious progeny virions by plaque assay on the L132 human embryonic lung cell line. The SK-N-SH neuroblastoma and H4 neuroglioma cell lines were highly susceptible to infection. The U-87 MG and U-373 MG astrocytoma cell lines were also infectable by HCV-229E. We could also demonstrate infection of the MO3.13 cell line, which was established by fusion of human oligodendrocytes with a thioguanine-resistant mutant of the TE671 (RD) human rhabdomyosarcoma cell line. An apparently more extensive infection of the MO3.13 cells, when compared to the parental cells, supports the notion that human oligodendrocytes are differentially susceptible to infection by this virus. We also tested for HCV-229E gene expression in pathological brain specimens. For that purpose, we developed a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay to amplify a portion of the mRNA encoding the viral nucleocapsid protein. Using stringent laboratory conditions, viral RNA was detectable in brain tissue of 4 of 11 multiple sclerosis patients and none of 6 neurological and 5 normal controls.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","Talbot, P J; Ekandé, S; Cashman, N R; Mounir, S; Stewart, J N",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8209751/,0

Could a virus currently spreading around the world that causes pseudoinfluenza symptoms be the basis for changing the criterion for determining a pandemic? According to WHO data from May 15, 2020, out of 153,517 confirmed COVID-19 cases, 5,735 deaths were recorded, allowing to determine the mortality rate at about 3.7%, which decreased significantly in the following months. The presented analysis from USA indicated that the elderly and those burdened with comorbidities are the most at risk groups, among them mainly those with cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Similar data were obtained in Sweden, a country where no strict sanitary regimen was introduced, adopting the principle of creating herd immunity. On the other hand, Polish information is not corroborated by reliable studies, both in terms of the number and quality of diagnostic tests performed and the treatment used in individual groups infected with SARS-CoV-2 and patients. This leads to questioning the legitimacy of the introduced epidemiological restrictions. Wellknown mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection and actions of basic drugs indicate the possibility of controlling the potential infection of the whole society.","Płusa, Tadeusz",Polski merkuriusz lekarski : organ Polskiego Towarzystwa Lekarskiego,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33130799/,0

In this study, a secreted recombinant expression plasmid, pVAX-S1, encoding the partial S protein with a signal peptide, was constructed and used to immunize BALB/c mice through electroporation. It was demonstrated that the eukaryotic expression vector pVAX-S1 was successfully constructed by restriction enzyme and sequence analysis. The expressed protein could be detected specifically by Western blot analysis. The serum IgG level of the vaccine group mice was significantly higher than that of the corresponding control group at day 14 after vaccination (P < 0.05). The vaccine group demonstrated significantly higher S1 protein lymphocyte proliferation index (LPI) than the control groups (P < 0.05). Furthermore, in the experimental group, a decrease in the ratio of CD4(+) to CD8(+) T-lymphocytes and an increase level of IFN-gamma in serum were observed. However, interleukin-4 (IL-4) was not detectable in two groups. These results strongly demonstrated that the pVAX-S1 plasmid could induce humoral and cellular immune responses in mice, and may be a potential candidate for a DNA vaccine against the SARS coronavirus.","He, Hongxuan; Tang, Yi; Qin, Ximing; Xu, Wenbo; Wang, Yifei; Liu, Xiangjun; Liu, Xingyou; Xiong, Sheng; Li, Jiuxiang; Zhang, Meiying; Duan, Mingxing",DNA and cell biology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16101350/,0

A mastite infecciosa é a mais importante doença sob o ponto de vista econômico e de saúde pública. A contagem de unidades formadoras de colônias por mililitro (UFC/mL) de leite proveniente diretamente de uma glândula mamária permitiria avaliar o comportamento de cada um dos agentes etiológicos da mastite infecciosa. A comparação desta informação com a contagem de células somáticas (CCS/mL) na amostra de leite permitiria uma avaliação mais acurada do processo infeccioso e inflamatório na glândula mamária.

204921,Frequency of putative enteric zoster diagnosed using saliva samples in patients with abdominal pain: a prospective study,2021,"Solidarity as one of the cornerstone values of the European Union has been once again seated on the red chair and intensively discussed within the European Union and broader. After the economic recession and migrant crisis that marked the last two decades, the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has once again harshly tested the fundamental objectives and values of the European Union and the responsiveness and effectiveness of its governance system on many fronts. In April, 2020 several EU Member States were among the worst affected countries worldwide and this situation soon became similar in their closest neighbourhood. It put a huge pressure on the EU to act faster, while at the same time placing this sui generis community to the test that led to revealing its strengths and weaknesses. As it happened in the previous crises, the Union launched policies and various programmes that were meant to lessen the burden of the Member States and aspiring countries caused by the crises. The objectives of the mentioned soft law instruments that the EU adopted during the COVID-19 crisis has been not only to show that EU law is equipped to react to health and economic crises rapidly but to deliver its support in terms of solidarity to its Member States and its closest neighbours facing the unprecedented health and economic crisis. This article will explore the value and implication of the solidarity principle in times of Covid-19 in its various manifestations. A special focus will be on the financial and material aspects of the EU instruments created to combat the negative consequences of the pandemic and their further impact on shaping the solidarity principle within the EU system. While the character and types of these mechanisms a special focus will be placed on those available to Western Balkan countries, whereas Montenegro as the ""fast runner"" in the EU integration process will be taken as a case study for the purpose of more detailed analyses. One of the major conclusions of the paper will be that although the speed of the EU reactions due to highly complex structure of decision making was not always satisfying for all the actors concerned, the EU once again has shown that it is reliable and that it treats the Western Balkan countries as privileged partners all for the sake of ending pandemic and launching the socio-economic recovery of the Western Balkans. Analytical and comparative methods will be dominantly relied upon throughout the paper. This will allow the authors to draw the main conclusions of the paper and assess the degree of solidarity as well as the effectiveness of the existing EU instruments that are available to Montenegro and aimed at diminishing negative consequences of the crisis.","Đuric, Stefan PhD Lalatovic Bojana PhD",EU and Comparative Law Issues and Challenges Series,,0

As severe acute respiratory syndrome is the major cause of mortality after COVID-19 infection, patients with COVID-19 who are prone to severe acute respiratory problems may require mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO; Alhazzani et al., 2020). Ongoing advances in intensive care medicine are continuing to improve survival in critically ill patients (Kaukonen, Bailey, Suzuki, Pilcher, & Bellomo, 2014). However, intensive care unit (ICU) survivors may experience complications and problems related to their disease and treatment such as critical illness polyneuropathy, critical illness myopathy, and post intensive care syndrome (PICS; Alhazzani et al., 2020). Harvey (2012) reported that 85%-95% of ICU patients have ICU-acquired weakness after ICU discharge and 74% of ICU patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome have cognitive impairment after ICU discharge. Physical disabilities, cognitive impairment, and mental or psychological distress (e.g., anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder) after ICU discharge may be symptoms of PICS, and may continue to affect surviving patients for several years after ICU discharge (Elliott et al., 2014; Held & Moss, 2019; Jackson et al., 2014; Jubran et al., 2010). Efforts to prevent and treat COVID-19 in Taiwan have proven more effective compared to most other places in the world. In addition to the low number of diagnosed cases, the mortality rate (seven of 440 confirmed cases) in Taiwan has been significantly lower than in most other countries (Taiwan Centers for Disease Control, ROC, 2020, May 14). However, post-discharge care for ICU survivors, especially those hospitalized after a sudden onset of severe disease symptoms and then discharged after a long ICU stay or after receiving mechanical ventilation, require specialized care to minimize PICS. Nurses are responsible not only for treating patients with the disease but also for preventing the further spread of disease. Therefore, providing continued care to patients discharged from the ICU is essential. Specifically, interventions to avoid PICS must be implemented rapidly by multidisciplinary medical teams during and immediately after ICU discharge.","Lin, Yu-Hua",Hu Li Za Zhi,,0

Most SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies target the receptor binding domain (RBD) and some the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the spike protein, which is the major antigen of SARS-CoV-2. While the antibody response to RBD has been extensively characterized, the antigenicity and immunogenicity of the NTD protein are less well studied. Using 227 plasma samples from COVID-19 patients, we showed that SARS-CoV-2 NTD-specific antibodies could be induced during infection. As compared to the results of SARS-CoV-2 RBD, the serological response of SARS-CoV-2 NTD is less cross-reactive with SARS-CoV, a pandemic strain that was identified in 2003. Furthermore, neutralizing antibodies are rarely elicited in a mice model when NTD is used as an immunogen. We subsequently demonstrate that NTD has an altered antigenicity when expressed alone. Overall, our results suggest that while NTD offers a supplementary strategy for serology testing, it may not be suitable as an immunogen for vaccine development.","Lv, Huibin; Tsang, Owen Tak-Yin; So, Ray T Y; Wang, Yiquan; Yuan, Meng; Liu, Hejun; Yip, Garrick K; Teo, Qi Wen; Lin, Yihan; Liang, Weiwen; Wang, Jinlin; Ng, Wilson W; Wilson, Ian A; Peiris, J S Malik; Wu, Nicholas C; Mok, Chris K P",Eur. j. immunol,,0

Bevezetés: Egy új, számítógép által segített betegminta-asszociációs analízis eredménye szerint a COVID-19 tüneteinek kialakításában kiemelt tényezoként jelenik meg a bradikinin. Eszerint a bradikinin lebontása lelassul az angiotenzinkonvertáló enzim aktivitásának csökkenése miatt, ami jelentosen megemelkedo bradikininszinthez vezet a tüdoben. Nem merült fel azonban a véralvadási faktorok lehetséges szerepe a ""bradikininviharban"", annak ellenére, hogy az idosebb cardiovascularis betegekben aktiválódó XII-es faktor és a C1-észteráz-inhibitor (C1INH) alacsony szintje nagy mennyiségu bradikinin képzodéséhez vezethet. Módszer: Átfogó irodalmi áttekintés. Eredmények: 1) A vírus által fertozött, sérült endotheliumsejtek felülete az a hely, amellyel érintkezve elindulhat a XII-es véralvadási faktor aktivációja - ez serkenti a prekallikrein/kallikrein/kinin rendszert, és bradikininképzodést okoz. Ez a folyamat megtörténik a súlyos vese- és tüdokárosodást okozó hantavírus-fertozésekben. 2) Idos betegekben az atherosclerosis miatt többszörösen sérült, merev, ""stiff"" erek endotheliumfelszínein jóval magasabb lehet a XII-es faktor kontakt úton történo aktivációja, mint a fiatal egyének ereiben. Ez a tény egyik oka lehet az idos, cardiovascularis betegek körében tapasztalt magasabb halálozásnak. Következtetés: Az aktivált XII-es véralvadási faktor célzott gátlása újabb gyógyítási lehetoség lehet a SARS-CoV-2-fertozött idos betegekben. Jelenleg már hatásosnak bizonyult a bradikininképzést gátló C1INH-nak, továbbá a bradikininreceptor-gátlóknak az adása is. Orv Hetil. 2020; 161(50): 2099-2103. INTRODUCTION: Bradykinin was implicated in a new complex model of pathomechanism leading to the symptoms of COVID-19 created by a computer-assisted association analysis. According to this model, the decrease in angiotensin-converting enzyme expression leads to impaired bradykinin elimination and subsequent enrichment in the lungs. However, there is no mentioning of the importance of blood coagulation factor XII in increased bradykinin production, in spite of its age-dependent activation and the lower level of C1-esterase inhibitor (C1INH). Activated factor XII may be an important contributor to the ""bradykinin storm"" in elder cardiovascular patients. METHOD: Literature review. RESULTS: 1) Activation of the coagulation factor XII on the surface of SARS-CoV-2 infected endothelial cells may trigger the prekallikrein/kallikrein/kinin system producing bradykinin. Such process is taking place in hantavirus infections causing severe lung and kidney damages. 2) The endothelial system is dysregulated in elderly patients, resulting in potentially higher factor XII activities on the surface of damaged endothelial cells in the stiffened arteries. This can contribute to the higher mortality rates in the elderly. CONCLUSION: The targeted inhibition of activated blood coagulation factor XII may represent a new therapeutic target for COVID-19, especially for elder patients. Recently, beneficial results have already been observed by the clinical applications of recombinant C1INH and bradykinin receptor antagonists.

The BCGs are selected from the Spitzer Adaptation of the Red-Sequence Cluster Survey (SpARCS) to be IR-bright and therefore star-forming. We find that molecular gas is common in star-forming BCGs, detecting CO at a detection rate of 80% in our target sample of 30 objects. We additionally provide measurements of the star formation rate (SFR) and stellar mass, calculated from existing MIPS 24 $\mu$m and IRAC 3.6 $\mu$m fluxes, respectively. We find these galaxies have molecular gas masses of $0.7-11.0\times 10^{10}\ \mathrm{M}_\odot$, comparable to other BCGs in this redshift range, and specific star formation rates which trace the Elbaz et al.

We compare our BCGs to those of the lower-redshift, cooling-flow BCG sample assembled by Edge (2001) and find that at z $\lesssim 0.6$ the two samples show very similar correlations between their gas masses and specific SFRs.

216119,Positive RT-PCR in urine from an asymptomatic patient with novel coronavirus 2019 infection: a case report,2020,"Community-acquired pneumonia by primary or superinfections with Streptococcus pneumoniae can lead to acute respiratory distress requiring mechanical ventilation. The pore-forming toxin pneumolysin alters the alveolar-capillary barrier and causes extravasation of protein-rich fluid into the interstitial pulmonary tissue, which impairs gas exchange. Platelets usually prevent endothelial leakage in inflamed pulmonary tissue by sealing inflammation-induced endothelial gaps. We not only confirm that S pneumoniae induces CD62P expression in platelets, but we also show that, in the presence of pneumolysin, CD62P expression is not associated with platelet activation. Pneumolysin induces pores in the platelet membrane, which allow anti-CD62P antibodies to stain the intracellular CD62P without platelet activation. Pneumolysin treatment also results in calcium efflux, increase in light transmission by platelet lysis (not aggregation), loss of platelet thrombus formation in the flow chamber, and loss of pore-sealing capacity of platelets in the Boyden chamber. Specific anti-pneumolysin monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies inhibit these effects of pneumolysin on platelets as do polyvalent human immunoglobulins. In a post hoc analysis of the prospective randomized phase 2 CIGMA trial, we show that administration of a polyvalent immunoglobulin preparation was associated with a nominally higher platelet count and nominally improved survival in patients with severe S pneumoniae-related community-acquired pneumonia.

217359,"Prevalence of HIV, HCV, and HBV in Central Asia and the Caucasus: A Systematic Review",2020,"The dire need of effective preventive measures and treatment approaches against SARS-CoV-2 virus, causing COVID-19 pandemic, calls for an in-depth understanding of its evolutionary dynamics with attention to specific geographic locations, since lockdown and social distancing to prevent the virus spread could lead to distinct localized dynamics of virus evolution within and between countries owing to different environmental and host-specific selection pressures. To decipher any correlation between SARS-CoV-2 evolution and its epidemiology in India, we studied the mutational diversity of spike glycoprotein, the key player for the attachment, fusion and entry of virus to the host cell. For this, we analyzed the sequences of 630 Indian isolates as available in GISAID database till June 07, 2020 (during the time-period before the start of Unlock 1.0 in India on and from June 08, 2020), and detected the spike protein variants to emerge from two major ancestors - Wuhan-Hu-1/2019 and its D614G variant. Average stability of the docked spike protein - host receptor (S-R) complexes for these variants correlated strongly (R2 = 0.96) with the fatality rates across Indian states. However, while more than half of the variants were found unique to India, 67% of all variants showed lower stability of S-R complex than the respective ancestral variants, indicating a possible fitness loss in recently emerged variants, despite a continuous increase in mutation rate. These results conform to the sharply declining fatality rate countrywide (>7-fold during April 11 - June 28, 2020). Altogether, while we propose the potential of S-R complex stability to track disease severity, we urge an immediate need to explore if SARS-CoV-2 is approaching mutational meltdown in India.","Banerjee, Rachana; Basak, Kausik; Ghosh, Anamika; Rajachandran, Vyshakh; Sureka, Kamakshi; Ganguly, Debabani; Chattopadhyay, Sujay",Infect Genet Evol,,0

In this paper, we focus on a) the challenges of assessing motor severity via videos and b) the use of emerging video-based Artificial Intelligence (AI)/Machine Learning techniques to quantitate human movement and its potential utility in assessing motor severity in patients with Parkinson's disease. While we conclude that video-based assessment may be an accessible and useful way of monitoring motor severity of Parkinson's disease, the potential of video-based AI to diagnose and quantify disease severity in the clinical context is dependent on research with large, diverse samples, and further validation using carefully considered performance standards.","Sibley, Krista G; Girges, Christine; Hoque, Ehsan; Foltynie, Thomas",Journal of Parkinson&#039;s disease (Online),,0

Age-related changes in these cells may underlie the differential severity of pneumonia in older patients. We performed an integrated analysis of single-cell RNA-Seq data that revealed homogenous age-related changes in the alveolar macrophage transcriptome in humans and mice. Using genetic lineage tracing with sequential injury, heterochronic adoptive transfer, and parabiosis, we found that the lung microenvironment drove an age-related resistance of alveolar macrophages to proliferation that persisted during influenza A viral infection. Ligand-receptor pair analysis localized these changes to the extracellular matrix, where hyaluronan was increased in aged animals and altered the proliferative response of bone marrow-derived macrophages to granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Our findings suggest that strategies targeting the aging lung microenvironment will be necessary to restore alveolar macrophage function in aging.","McQuattie-Pimentel, Alexandra C; Ren, Ziyou; Joshi, Nikita; Watanabe, Satoshi; Stoeger, Thomas; Chi, Monica; Lu, Ziyan; Sichizya, Lango; Aillon, Raul Piseaux; Chen, Ching-I; Soberanes, Saul; Chen, Zhangying; Reyfman, Paul A; Walter, James M; Anekalla, Kishore R; Davis, Jennifer M; Helmin, Kathryn A; Runyan, Constance E; Abdala-Valencia, Hiam; Nam, Kiwon; Meliton, Angelo Y; Winter, Deborah R; Morimoto, Richard I; Mutlu, Gökhan M; Bharat, Ankit; Perlman, Harris; Gottardi, Cara J; Ridge, Karen M; Chandel, Navdeep S; Sznajder, Jacob I; Balch, William E; Singer, Benjamin D; Misharin, Alexander V; Budinger, G R Scott",J. clin. invest,,0

Virtual management (telemedicine) has been shown to reduce health costs and improve access to care. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this survey is to understand oncologists' awareness of and views on virtual management, challenges, and preferences, as well as their priorities regarding the prescribing of anticancer treatments during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We created a self-administrated electronic survey about the virtual management of patients with cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic. We evaluated its clinical sensibility and pilot tested the instrument. We surveyed practicing oncologists in Gulf and Arab countries using snowball sampling via emails and social media networks. Reminders were sent 1 and 2 weeks later using SurveyMonkey. RESULTS: We received 222 responses from validated oncologists from April 2-22, 2020. An awareness of virtual clinics, virtual multidisciplinary teams, and virtual prescriptions was reported by 182 (82%), 175 (79%), and 166 (75%) respondents, respectively. Reported challenges associated with virtual management were the lack of physical exam (n=134, 60%), patients' awareness and access (n=131, 59%), the lack of physical attendance of patients (n=93, 42%), information technology (IT) support (n=82, 37%), and the safety of virtual management (n=78, 35%). Overall, 111 (50%) and 107 (48%) oncologists did not prefer the virtual prescription of chemotherapy and novel immunotherapy, respectively. However, 188 (85%), 165 (74%), and 127 (57%) oncologists preferred the virtual prescription of hormonal therapy, bone modifying agents, and targeted therapy, respectively. In total, 184 (83%), 183 (83%), and 176 (80%) oncologists preferred to continue neoadjuvant, adjuvant, and perioperative treatments, respectively. Overall, 118 (53%) respondents preferred to continue first-line palliative treatment, in contrast to 68 (30%) and 47 (21%) respondents indicating a preference to interrupt second- and third-line palliative treatment, respectively. For administration of virtual prescriptions, all respondents preferred the oral route and 118 (53%) preferred the subcutaneous route. In contrast, 193 (87%) did not prefer the intravenous route for virtual prescriptions. Overall, 102 (46%) oncologists responded that they would ""definitely"" prefer to manage patients with cancer virtually. CONCLUSIONS: Oncologists have a high level of awareness of virtual management. Although their survey responses indicated that second- and third-line palliative treatments should be interrupted, they stated that neoadjuvant, adjuvant, perioperative, and first-line palliative treatments should continue. Our results confirm that oncologists' views on the priority of anticancer treatments are consistent with the evolving literature during the COVID-19 pandemic. Challenges to virtual management should be addressed to improve the care of patients with cancer.","Tashkandi, Emad; Zeeneldin, Ahmed; AlAbdulwahab, Amal; Elemam, Omima; Elsamany, Shereef; Jastaniah, Wasil; Abdullah, Shaker; Alfayez, Mohammad; Jazieh, Abdul Rahman; Al-Shamsi, Humaid O",J Med Internet Res,,0

We selected these sites as part of a multi-level intervention aimed at introducing more traditional AN subsistence foods, increasing fruit and vegetable intake, and decreasing SSB consumption among young children enrolled in Head Start (preschool) programmes (Clinicaltrials.gov #NCT03601299). Storekeepers in these communities agreed that seasonality and flight schedules were primary factors determining commercial foods' availability. Several storekeepers noted that federal food assistance programmes that specify which food items may be purchased with funds received from the programme and community policies that set limits on less healthy items promote customer purchases of healthier products. The fact that storekeepers are comfortable enforcing government assistance programme guidelines, company policies, and tribal resolutions suggests an important role storekeepers play in improving nutritional intake in their communities.","Koller, Kathryn R; Flanagan, Christie A; Nu, Jennifer; Lee, Flora R; Desnoyers, Christine; Walch, Amanda; Alexie, Lucinda; Bersamin, Andrea; Thomas, Timothy K",Int J Circumpolar Health,,0

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are of interest to treat acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. MAIN BODY: Stem cell-based therapies have been verified for prospective benefits in copious preclinical and clinical studies. MSCs confer potential benefits to develop various cell types and organoids for studying virus-human interaction, drug testing, regenerative medicine, and immunomodulatory effects in COVID-19 patients. Apart from paving the ways to augment stem cell research and therapies, somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) holds unique ability for a wide range of health applications such as patient-specific or isogenic cells for regenerative medicine and breeding transgenic animals for biomedical applications. Being a potent cell genome-reprogramming tool, the SCNT has increased prominence of recombinant therapeutics and cellular medicine in the current era of COVID-19. As SCNT is used to generate patient-specific stem cells, it avoids dependence on embryos to obtain stem cells.

Study designSurvey MethodsRoutine public health surveillance identified a marked increase in the numbers of University of Cambridge students with respiratory illness and SARS-CoV-2 positivity in the 10 days after a national lockdown was announced in the UK on 5 November 2020. Cases were identified both through symptom-triggered testing and a universal asymptomatic testing program. An online questionnaire was sent to all University of Cambridge students on 25 November to investigate risk factors for testing positive in the period after 30th October 2020. This asked about symptoms, SARS-CoV-2 test results, in-person teaching settings, other aspects of University life, and attendance at social events in the period just prior to lockdown, from 30th October and 4th November 2020. Univariate and multivariable analyses were undertaken evaluating potential risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 positivity. ResultsAmong 3,980 students responding to the questionnaire, 99 (2.5%) reported testing SARS-CoV-2 positive in the period studied; 28 (28%) were asymptomatic. We found strong independent associations with SARS-CoV-2 positivity were attendance at two social settings in the City of Cambridge (adjusted odds ratio favouring disease 13.0 (95% CI 6.2,26.9) and 14.2 (95% CI 2.9,70)), with weaker evidence of association with three further social settings. By contrast, we did not observe strong independent associations between disease risk and type of accommodation or attendance at, or participation in, a range of activities associated with the University curriculum. ConclusionsAttendance at social settings can facilitate widespread SARS-CoV-2 transmission in University students.

Manual investigations by human contact tracers remain a dominant way in which this is carried out. This process is limited by the number of contact tracers available, who are often overburdened during an outbreak or epidemic. As a result, a crucial decision in any contact tracing strategy is, given a set of contacts, which person should a tracer trace next? In this work, we develop a formal model that articulates these questions and provides a framework for comparing contact tracing strategies. Through analyzing our model, we give provably optimal prioritization policies via a clean connection to a tool from operations research called a""branching bandit"". Examining these policies gives qualitative insight into trade-offs in contact tracing applications.","Meister, Michela; Kleinberg, Jon",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.09803v1.pdf,0

237383,Alternative Pneumocystis Prophylaxis in Solid Organ Transplant Recipients at Two Large Transplant Centers,2020,"AIM: Lung ultrasound (LUS) is a reliable, radiation-free, and bedside imaging technique used to assess several pulmonary diseases. Although COVID-19 is diagnosed with a nasopharyngeal swab, detection of pulmonary involvement is crucial for safe patient discharge. Computed tomography (CT) is currently the gold standard. To treat paucisymptomatic patients, we have implemented a ""fast track"" pathway in our emergency department, using LUS as a valid alternative. Minimal data is available in the literature about interobserver reliability and the level of expertise needed to perform a reliable examination. Our aim was to assess these. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a single-center prospective study. We enrolled 96 patients. 12 lung areas were explored in each patient with a semiquantitative assessment of pulmonary aeration loss in order to obtain the LUS score. Scans were performed by two different operators, an expert and a novice, who were blinded to their colleague's results. RESULTS: 96 patients were enrolled. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) showed excellent agreement between the expert and the novice operator (ICC 0.975; 0.962-0.983); demographic features (age, sex, and chronic pulmonary disease) did not influence the reproducibility of the method. The ICC was 0.973 (0.950-0.986) in males, 0.976 (0.959-0.986) in females; 0.965 (0.940-0.980) in younger patients (&#8804;â46 yrs), and 0.973 (0.952-0.985) in older (>â46 yrs) patients. The ICC was 0.967 (0.882-0.991) in patients with pulmonary disease and 0.975 (0.962-0.984) in the other patients. The learning curve showed an increase in interobserver agreement. CONCLUSION: Our results confirm the feasibility and reproducibility of the method among operators with different levels of expertise, with a rapid learning curve.","De Molo, Chiara; Consolini, Silvia; Salvatore, Veronica; Grignaschi, Alice; Lanotte, Antonella; Masi, Livia; Giostra, Fabrizio; Serra, Carla",Ultraschall med,,0

To this end, we conducted an online experiment whereby 112 participants provided affective ratings for a set of normative images and reported on their well-being during COVID-19 self-isolation. We found that current valence ratings were significantly lower than the original ones from 2015. This negative shift correlated with key aspects of the personal situation during the confinement, including working and living status, and subjective well-being. These findings indicate that quarantine impacts mood negatively, resulting in a negatively biased perception of emotive stimuli.

249000,Rapid Spread and Control of Multidrug-Resistant Gram-Negative Bacteria in COVID-19 Patient Care Units,2021,"OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to validate the original Caprini score and its modifications considering coronavirus disease (COVID-19) as a severe prothrombotic condition in patients admitted to the hospital. METHODS: The relevant data were extracted from the electronic medical records with an implemented Caprini score and were retrospectively evaluated. The score was calculated twice: by the physician on admission and by the investigator at discharge (death). The final assessment considered additional risk factors that occurred during inpatient treatment. Besides the original Caprini score (a version of 2005), the modified version added the elevation of D-dimer and specific scores for COVID-19 as follows: two points for asymptomatic, three points for symptomatic, and five points for symptomatic infection with positive D-dimer. Cases were evaluated retrospectively. The primary end point was symptomatic venous thromboembolism (VTE) detected during inpatient treatment and confirmed by appropriate imaging testing or autopsy. The secondary end points included those observed during hospitalization (admission to the intensive care unit, a requirement for invasive mechanical ventilation, death, bleeding), and those assessed at 6-month follow-up (symptomatic VTE, bleeding, death). The association of eight different versions of the Caprini score with VTE events was evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 168 patients (83 males and 85 females at the age of 58.3 ± 12.7 years) were admitted to the hospital between April 30 and May 29, 2020, and were discharged or died to the time of data analysis. The original Caprini score varied between 2 and 12 (5.4 ± 1.8) at the admission and between 2 and 15 (5.9 ± 2.5) at discharge or death. The maximal score was observed with modification including specific COVID-19 points of 5 to 20 (10.0 ± 3.0). Patients received prophylactic (enoxaparin 40 mg once daily: 2.4%), intermediate (enoxaparin 80 mg once daily: 76.8%), or therapeutic (enoxaparin 1 mg/kg twice daily: 20.8%) anticoagulation. Despite this, symptomatic VTE was detected in 11 (6.5%) inpatients. Of the 168 individuals, 28 (16.7%) admitted to the intensive care unit, 8 (4.8%) required invasive mechanical ventilation, and 8 (4.8%) died. Clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding was detected in two (1.2%) cases. The Caprini score of all eight versions demonstrated a significant association with inpatient VTE frequency. The highest predictability was observed for the original scale when assessed at discharge (death). Only symptomatic VTE was reported after discharge with a cumulative incidence of 7.1%. This did not affect the predictability of the Caprini score. Extended antithrombotic treatment was prescribed to 49 (29%) patients with a cumulative incidence of bleeding of 1.8% at 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: The study identified a significant correlation between the Caprini score and the risk of VTE in patients with COVID-19. All models including specific COVID-19 scores showed equally high predictability, and use of the original Caprini score is appropriate for patients with COVID-19.","Tsaplin, Sergey; Schastlivtsev, Ilya; Zhuravlev, Sergey; Barinov, Victor; Lobastov, Kirill; Caprini, Joseph A",J.

251036,Effects on gait and balance of home-based active video game interventions in persons with multiple sclerosis: A systematic review,2021,"Tiny plastic particles considered as emerging contaminants have attracted considerable interest in the last few years. Mechanical abrasion, photochemical oxidation and biological degradation of larger plastic debris result in the formation of microplastics (MPs, 1 µm to 5 mm) and nanoplastics (NPs, 1 nm to 1000 nm). Compared with MPs, the environmental fate, ecosystem toxicity and potential risks associated with NPs have so far been less explored. This review provides a state-of-the-art overview of current research on NPs with focus on currently less-investigated fields, such as the environmental fate in agroecosystems, migration in porous media, weathering, and toxic effects on plants. The co-transport of NPs with organic contaminants and heavy metals threaten human health and ecosystems. Furthermore, NPs may serve as a novel habitat for microbial colonization, and may act as carriers for pathogens (i.e., bacteria and viruses). An integrated framework is proposed to better understand the interrelationships between NPs, ecosystems and the human society. In order to fully understand the sources and sinks of NPs, more studies should focus on the total environment, including freshwater, ocean, groundwater, soil and air, and more attempts should be made to explore the aging and aggregation of NPs in environmentally relevant conditions. Considering the fact that naturally-weathered plastic debris may have distinct physicochemical characteristics, future studies should explore the environmental behavior of naturally-aged NPs rather than synthetic polystyrene nanobeads.","Wang, Liuwei; Wu, Wei-Min; Bolan, Nanthi S; Tsang, Daniel C W; Li, Yang; Qin, Muhan; Hou, Deyi",J Hazard Mater,,0

The technique was administered online through a web-based video conferencing platform. The intervention started on week four of the first quarantine in Italy (week commencing 30th March 2020), for a duration of 4 weeks and ended before lockdown measures were loosened. 310 people participated in the study, mean age 28.73 years old (SD = 9.16), 77.8% women. Of these, about half were randomly assigned to the experimental group and the other half served as controls. Participants completed online psychological tests before and after the intervention. 266 people (144 experimental, 122 controls) completed the post-intervention tests. Consistent with our hypothesis, the study's findings indicate a reduction in the levels of stress, anxiety, global distress, and negative affect in the experimental group, compared to the control group. Moreover, the experimental group also showed higher levels of positive affect, compared to controls after the intervention. The present findings add to the current literature in suggesting that the BWM-T reduced stress not only when administered face-to face but also when administered online during the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, we also noted that the BWM-T has an effect on anxiety, global distress, and affect, which we had not investigated in previous studies.","Cozzolino, M.; Celia, G.; Girelli, L.; Limone, P.",Frontiers in Psychology,,0

Family physicians (FPs) have played a critical role in the coordination of care. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In April 2020, we performed an online prospective survey to assess the impact of the pandemic on FPs' practices. RESULTS: Three hundred FPs were included. Mean age was 53.6 ± 13.5 years. Before the pandemic, 60.2% reported >75 outpatient visits/week, which reduced down to an average of <20/week for 79.8% of FPs; 24.2% of FPs discontinued home visits, while for 94.7% of FPs there was a >50% increase in the number of telephone consultations. Concern related to the risk of contagion was elevated (&#8805;3/5 in 74.6%) and even higher to the risk of infecting relatives and patients (&#8805;3/5 in 93.3%). The majority of FPs (87%) supported the role of telemedicine in the near future. Satisfaction regarding the network with hospitals/COVID-19-dedicated wards received a score &#8804;2/5 in 46.9% of cases.

252487,IgG4-related disease: an atypical presentation of steroid-responsive renal mass,2021,"Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a fast-progressive neurodegenerative disease leading to progressive physical immobility with usually normal or mild cognitive and/or behavioural involvement. Many patients are relatively young, instructed, sensitive to new technologies, and professionally active when developing the first symptoms. Older patients usually require more time, encouragement, reinforcement and a closer support but, nevertheless, selecting user-friendly devices, provided earlier in the course of the disease, and engaging motivated carers may overcome many technological barriers. ALS may be considered a model for neurodegenerative diseases to further develop and test new technologies. From multidisciplinary teleconsults to telemonitoring of the respiratory function, telemedicine has the potentiality to embrace other fields, including nutrition, physical mobility, and the interaction with the environment. Brain-computer interfaces and eye tracking expanded the field of augmentative and alternative communication in ALS but their potentialities go beyond communication, to cognition and robotics. Virtual reality and different forms of artificial intelligence present further interesting possibilities that deserve to be investigated. COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented opportunity to speed up the development and implementation of new technologies in clinical practice, improving the daily living of both ALS patients and carers.

Prevention in medicine is considered the best protection action for individuals in order to avoid infections. This study investigates whether Greek citizens (N = 3359) take the necessary precautions to prevent developing the COVID-19 disease, and it segments them based on homogenous behavior groups. Lastly, it provides communication techniques that should be implemented, targeting each citizen segment for a long-term COVID-19 free country. Data analysis revealed the extent of the applied precaution measures. The ones most applied by citizens were to avoid non-mandatory transportation, contact with individuals with respiratory symptoms, and individuals of high risk for severe illness (vulnerable groups). On the other hand, the least applied measures are daily checks of body temperature, monitoring for fever, cough, or dyspnea, use of a face mask when in public places, or when using public transportation. Additionally, cluster analysis revealed five groups of citizens based on self-reported behavior, namely, the Meticulous Proactive Citizens, the Self-isolated Citizens, the Cautious Citizens, the Occasionally Cautious Citizens, and the Unconcerned Citizens. Communication strategies targeting each segment are also discussed.","Kamenidou, Irene Eirini; Stavrianea, Aikaterini; Liava, Christina",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,0
255686,The controversy of using angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers in COVID-19 patients,2021,"Network data are increasingly available in various research fields, motivating statistical analysis for populations of networks where a network as a whole is viewed as a data point. Due to the non-Euclidean nature of networks, basic statistical tools available for scalar and vector data are no longer applicable when one aims to relate networks as outcomes to Euclidean covariates, while the study of how a network changes in dependence on covariates is often of paramount interest. This motivates to extend the notion of regression to the case of responses that are network data. Here we propose to adopt conditional Fr\'{e}chet means implemented with both global least squares regression and local weighted least squares smoothing, extending the Fr\'{e}chet regression concept to networks that are quantified by their graph Laplacians. The challenge is to characterize the space of graph Laplacians so as to justify the application of Fr\'{e}chet regression. This characterization then leads to asymptotic rates of convergence for the corresponding M-estimators by applying empirical process methods. We demonstrate the usefulness and good practical performance of the proposed framework with simulations and with network data arising from NYC taxi records, as well as resting-state fMRI in neuroimaging.","Zhou, Yidong; Muller, Hans-Georg",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.02981v1.pdf,0

256209,Association of SARS-CoV-2 genomic load trends with clinical status in COVID-19: A retrospective analysis from an academic hospital center in New York City,2020,"BACKGROUND: The spread of airborne infectious diseases such as measles is a critical public health concern. The U.S. was certified measles-free in 2000, but the number of measles cases has increased in recent years breaking the record of the nationwide annual number of cases since 1992. Although the characteristics of schools have made them one of the most vulnerable environments during infection outbreaks, the transmission risk of measles among students is not completely understood. We aimed to evaluate how three factors influence measles transmission in schools: personal (vaccination), social (compartmentalizing), and building systems (ventilation, purification, and filtration). METHODS: We used a combination of a newly developed multi-zone transient Wells-Riley approach, a nationwide representative School Building Archetype (SBA) model, and a Monte-Carlo simulation to estimate measles risk among U.S. students. We compared our risk results with the range of reported transmission rates of measles in school outbreaks to validate the risk model. We also investigated the effectiveness of vaccination and ten supplemental infection control scenarios for reducing the risk of measles transmission among students. RESULTS: Our best nationwide estimate of measles transmission risk in U.S. schools were 3.5 and 32% among all (both unvaccinated and immunized) and unvaccinated students, respectively. The results showed the transmission risk of measles among unvaccinated students is > 70 times higher than properly immunized ones. We also demonstrated that the transmission risk of measles in primary schools (assuming teacher self-contained classrooms) is less than secondary schools (assuming departmentalized systems). For building-level interventions, schools with ductless-with-air-filter and ductless-without-air-filter systems have the lowest and highest transmission risks of measles, respectively. Finally, our simulation showed that infection control strategies could cut the average number of infected cases among all students in half when a combination of advanced air filtration, ventilation, and purification was adopted in the modeled schools. CONCLUSIONS: Our results highlight the primary importance of vaccination for reducing the risk of measles transmission among students. Yet, additional and significant risk reduction can be achieved through compartmentalizing students and enhancing building ventilation and filtration systems.","Azimi, Parham; Keshavarz, Zahra; Cedeno Laurent, Jose Guillermo; Allen, Joseph G",BMC Infect Dis,,0

256844,Correction to: Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System Inhibitors and Outcome in Patients With SARS-CoV-2 Pneumonia: A Case Series Study,2020,"COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy has become a major issue in the U.S. as vaccine supply has outstripped demand and vaccination rates slow down. At least one recent global survey has sought to study the covariates of vaccine acceptance, but an inferential model that makes simultaneous use of several socio-demographic variables has been lacking. In this article, we present such a model using US-based survey data collected by Gallup. Our study agrees with the global survey results in some respects, but is also found to exhibit significant differences. For example, women and people aged between 25-54 were found to be more vaccine hesitant. Our conditional inference tree model suggests that trust in government, age and ethnicity are the most important covariates for predicting vaccine hesitancy, and can interact in ways that make them useful for communication-based outreach, especially if conjoined with census data. In particular, we found that the most vaccine hesitant individuals were those who identified as Black Republicans with a high school (or lower) education and lower income levels, who were involuntarily unemployed and trusted in the Trump administration.","Shen, Ke; Kejriwal, Mayank",,,0

BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically affected health systems and professionals worldwide. Italian nurses have key messages for nursing leaders following their acute experiences in the pandemic. METHOD: A descriptive qualitative study with thematic analysis. RESULTS: Twenty-three testimonies from clinical nurses were analysed. Six macrothemes were identified as follows: organisational and logistic change; leadership models adopted to manage the emergency; changes in nursing approaches; personal protective equipment issues; physical and psychological impact on nurses; and team value/spirit. CONCLUSIONS: Our testimonies highlighted the huge impact of COVID-19 on the Italian nursing workforce, especially in terms of the high risks associated with caring for COVID-19 patients, exacerbated by the shortage of appropriate personal protective equipment. Nurses had to care for their colleagues and live separately from their families to avoid infecting them, revealing nurses' resilience and the important role of effective and sensitive management. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: Nurse managers must be prepared for the impact of pandemics on staff and need to ensure availability and replacement of quality personal protective equipment, rehearse strategies for communicating with patients while wearing personal protective equipment and establish protocols for communicating with relatives.","Catania, Gianluca; Zanini, Milko; Hayter, Mark; Timmins, Fiona; Dasso, Nicoletta; Ottonello, Giulia; Aleo, Giuseppe; Sasso, Loredana; Bagnasco, Annamaria",J. nurs. manag,,0

260602,The Practice of Wearing Surgical Masks during the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"Objective: In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, a majority of clinicians have had to quickly and dramatically alter their clinical practices. Two surveys were administered on 3/26/2020 and 3/30/2020, respectively, to document immediate changes and challenges in clinical practice.Method: Two surveys were administered between 3/26/2020 and 3/30/2020, via SurveyMonkey and Google Forms, asking clinicians questions pertaining to practice issues during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Quantitative responses from the second survey were stratified by clinical setting (Medical Hospital vs. Private Practice) prior to analysis. Qualitative, free-response items were coded by the authors to better understand immediate changes in practice and other concerns.Results: 266 neuropsychologists completed Survey 1 and 230 completed Survey 2. Results suggest that practices immediately moved towards remote service provision. A meaningful proportion of clinicians and their staff were immediately affected economically by the pandemic, with clinicians in private practice differentially affected. Furthermore, a small but significant minority of respondents faced ethical dilemmas related to service provision and expressed concerns with initial communication from their employment organizations. Respondents requested clear best-practice guidelines from neuropsychological practice organizations.Conclusions: It is clear that field of neuropsychology has drastically shifted clinical practices in response to COVID-19 and is likely to continue to evolve. While these responses were collected in the early stages of stay-at-home orders, policy changes continue to occur and it is paramount that practice organizations consider the initial challenges expressed by clinicians when formulating practice recommendations and evaluating the clinical utility of telehealth services.","Marra, David E; Hoelzle, James B; Davis, Jeremy J; Schwartz, Eben S",Clin Neuropsychol,,0

The virus underlying the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has caused over 98 million confirmed cases and 2.2 million deaths since January 2020. Although the most recent respiratory viral pandemic swept the globe only a decade ago, the way science operates and responds to current events has experienced a cultural shift in the interim. The scientific community has responded rapidly to the COVID-19 pandemic, releasing over 125,000 COVID-19-related scientific articles within 10 months of the first confirmed case, of which more than 30,000 were hosted by preprint servers. We focused our analysis on bioRxiv and medRxiv, 2 growing preprint servers for biomedical research, investigating the attributes of COVID-19 preprints, their access and usage rates, as well as characteristics of their propagation on online platforms. Our data provide evidence for increased scientific and public engagement with preprints related to COVID-19 (COVID-19 preprints are accessed more, cited more, and shared more on various online platforms than non-COVID-19 preprints), as well as changes in the use of preprints by journalists and policymakers. We also find evidence for changes in preprinting and publishing behaviour: COVID-19 preprints are shorter and reviewed faster. Our results highlight the unprecedented role of preprints and preprint servers in the dissemination of COVID-19 science and the impact of the pandemic on the scientific communication landscape.","Fraser, Nicholas; Brierley, Liam; Dey, Gautam; Polka, Jessica K; Pálfy, Máté; Nanni, Federico; Coates, Jonathon Alexis",PLoS Biol,,0

263775,"The COVID-19 pandemic is deepening the health crisis in South Kivu, Democratic Republic of Congo",2021,"Introduction The nursing profession is extremely demanding and stressful. Nurses have been facing a tremendous amount of fear and anxiety during the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. General self-efficacy is considered one of the most influential factors that can modify the impact of anxiety on nurses' mental health. In this study, we aimed to determine the predictors of self-efficacy and anxiety among nurses during the current COVID-19 pandemic. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional survey involving 368 nurses working in a tertiary care hospital. The General Self-Efficacy scale (GSE) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 (GAD-7) were used for assessing self-efficacy and anxiety. The chi-square test followed by bivariate and multivariable regression analyses was performed to identify the determinants of self-efficacy and anxiety. Results The mean age of the nurses was 28.91 years (SD=3.68), with a mean working experience in the nursing field of 5.32 years (SD=2.48). The mean self-efficacy and anxiety scores were 32.19 (SD=4.53) and 3.82 (SD=2.87), respectively. Mullivariable analysis showed that higher age (&gt;30 years, p=.(X)3), professional education acquired through a diploma course instead of a graduate degree (p&lt;.001), and lack of training on handling COVID-19 patients (p=.003) were significant determinants of higher anxiety among nurses. Similarly, higher economic status (p=.001), sufficient COVID-19 training (p=.049), having family members tested positive for COVID-19 (p=.012), professional experience (&lt;= 5 years, p&lt;0.001), and quarantine period (s14 days, p=.002) were revealed to be independent determinants of a higher sense of self-efficacy among nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusion Receiving adequate levels of training on COVID-19 plays a vital role in improving self-efficacy and reducing anxiety among nurses during the ongoing pandemic. Managing anxiety, increasing self-efficacy, and ensuring more exposure to COVID-19-related training may improve nurses' mental health and prepare them for fighting pandemics in a much better and more efficient manner.","Dharra, S.; Kumar, R.",Cureus,,0

271002,Panton-Valentine Leukocidin-Secreting Staphylococcus aureus Pneumonia Complicating COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: The complication, pulmonary fibrosis (PF) secondary to COVID-19, may have a second wave of late mortality, given the huge number of individuals infected by COVID-19. However, the molecular mechanisms of PF secondary to COVID-19 haven't been fully elucidated, making the identification of novel strategies for targeted therapy challenging. This study aimed to systematically identify the molecular mechanisms and high-frequency core traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) targeting PF secondary to COVID-19 through network pharmacology and data mining. METHODS: The molecular mechanisms of PF secondary to COVID-19 were identified by mapping the COVID-19 differentially expressed gene and known targets associated with PF, protein-protein interactions network analysis, and enrichment pathway analysis; then the high-frequency core TCM targeting PF secondary to COVID-19 were identified by data mining and ""Key targets related to PF secondary to COVID-19 - Ingredients"" and ""Key ingredients-key herbs"" network analysis; and last we validated the interaction between the key ingredients and key targets by molecular docking. RESULTS: The molecular mechanisms of PF secondary to COVID-19 were mainly related to tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling pathway, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction pathway, and NF-&#954;B signaling pathway. Among these, cytokines interleukin 6 (IL-6), TNF, and IL-1ß were identified as the key targets associated with PF secondary to COVID-19. The high-frequency core TCM targeting these key targets were identified, including ingredients of quercetin, epigallocatechin-3-gallate, emodin, triptolide, resveratrol, and herb of Polygonum cuspidatum. Finally, our results were validated by quercetin and resveratrol both well docked to IL-6, TNF, and IL-1ß protein, with the estimated docking energy <0 kcal/mol. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified the cytokines-related molecular mechanisms of PF secondary to COVID-19, and the high-frequency core TCM against PF by targeting IL-6, TNF, and IL-1ß. Which provides new ideas for the discovery of small molecular compounds with potential therapeutic effects on PF secondary to COVID-19.","Yu, Mei-Xiang; Song, Xin; Ma, Xiao-Qin; Hao, Chen-Xia; Huang, Jing-Jing; Yang, Wan-Hua",Ann Palliat Med,,0

276967,"Postvaccination COVID-19 among Healthcare Workers, Israel",2021,"Astronauts are exposed to a wide variety of stressors ranging from radiation and microgravity to persistent fluids shifts, circadian shifts and the psychological stress of prolonged isolation and confinement. On deep space missions, beyond the range of the Earth's magnetosphere, ionizing radiation may increase oxidative stress and DNA damage, immune system dysregulation and alter the effectiveness of the cellular defense mechanisms. By reviewing the health problems reported by astronauts participated in previous space missions, it is evident that viral infections are not rare in space. Recent reports suggest that COVID-19 can last for a long time in communities. Although NASA implements countermeasures designed to limit crew illness during space missions such as a pre-flight quarantine, it is not clear whether an outbreak can be prevented. Currently, it is not likely that astronauts could get a viral infection, but the consequences of potential lifethreatening viral diseases such as COVID-19 should be better characterized. In this paper we discuss why COVID-19 fatality in space might be significantly higher than on the Earth. The reasons for such an increased risk include 1) uselessness of social distancing due to microgravity 2) immune system dysregulation 3) possibly higher mutation rates of RNA viruses such as the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) 4) existence of strong selective pressure and 5) decreased maximum oxygen uptake. Given these considerations, the combined effects of microgravity, space radiation (and possibly other major space stressors) on the immune system of astronauts exposed to SARS-CoV-2 and possible interactions of the virus, space stressors and host should be carefully investigated.","Welsh, J.

The majority of clinics (62%) performed both video and telephone visits; Zoom was the most popular video platform used. Over 95% of clinics reported using CareLink&#8482;, Clarity®, Glooko&#8482;, and/or t:connect® to view device data, with only one center reporting automated data upload into the electronic medical record. The majority of centers had multidisciplinary teams participating in the video visits. All sites reported reimbursement for video visits, and 95% of sites reported coverage for telephone visits early on in the pandemic. Conclusions: There was rapid adoption of telemedicine in T1DX-QI during the COVID-19 pandemic. Future insurance reimbursement for telemedicine visits and the ideal ratio of telemedicine to in-person visits in T1D care remain to be determined.","Lee, Joyce M; Carlson, Emily; Albanese-O039,; Neill, Anastasia; Demeterco-Berggren, Carla; Corathers, Sarah D; Vendrame, Francesco; Weinstock, Ruth S; Prahalad, Priya; Alonso, Guy Todd; Kamboj, Manmohan; DeSalvo, Daniel J; Malik, Faisal S; Izquierdo, Roberto; Ebekozien, Osagie",Diabetes technol. ther,,0

Hence, the main aim of this paper is to help decision-makers in African countries to select the best available waste management strategy during the COVID-19 pandemic. The present research undertakes seamless assessment and prioritization of infectious solid waste (SW) and wastewater (WW) treatment technologies based on a criteria system involving four dimensions, i.e., environment-safety, technology, economics, and sociopolitics. A combined approach that integrates the results of life-cycle assessments and life-cycle costs (LCA-LCC), analytic hierarchy process (AHP), and VIKOR method in an interval-valued fuzzy (IVF) environment is proposed. The results reveal that combined incineration and chemical disinfection approach, and combined chlorination and ultraviolet irradiation are the most sustainable technologies for managing infectious SW and WW treatment in the present context. The proposed approach, alongside the findings of the study, constitutes a reference to devise urgent planning for contagious waste management in African countries as well as developing countries worldwide.","Belhadi, Amine; Kamble, Sachin S; Khan, Syed Abdul Rehman; Touriki, Fatima Ezahra; Kumar M, Dileep",Environ Manage,,0

287111,Preventing nosocomial infections in resource-limited settings: An interventional approach in healthcare facilities in Burkina Faso,2020,"Background: The general lockdown period during the COVID-19 pandemic which covered mid-March to mid-May 2020 in France raised important questions about the direct and indirect psychological effects on children and adolescents. Perceived intuitively as harmful and even traumatic in the media's discourse, we tried to better qualify its effects from two complementary approaches. We carried out a review of the literature on the subject to which we associated a regular assessment of the children's global clinical state in the entire active file of the child-psychiatry department of the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Brest throughout the lockdown period.The findings of the literature review on the psychological effects of lockdowns or quarantines during past or current epidemics, in particular in China, report many deleterious and variable effects such as symptoms of anxiety, depression, as well as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, at a significant rate. However, the definition of the situations experienced and the contexts in which those studies took place appear to be not truly comparable to the French situation. Moreover, the effects of the fear of contamination are not differentiated from those linked to confinement itself. Patients and methods: Among children and adolescents under the care of the above department, 354 underwent an assessment of the impact of lockdown on their global clinical condition using the Clinical Global Impression Improvement (CGI-I) performed by their usual practitioner during the period from March 16 to May 11, 2020. Results: Our results highlight that 50% of children remained in stable condition, 25 to 30% improved and 20 to 25% experienced a slight degradation. The evolution of the clinical status appeared stable over time during the eight weeks. The initial age or severity of mental disorder had no significant influence, although there was a slightly more frequent improvement in adolescents. Conclusion: These results are quite inconsistent with general discourse and common expectations. Several psychopathological hypotheses are discussed to support this absence of psychological degradation which might even be extended to children and adolescents in the general population.","Lavenne-Collot, N; Ailliot, P; Badic, S; Favé, A; François, G; Saint-André, S; Thierry, A; Bronsard, G",Neuropsychiatr. enfance adolesc,,0

Reports on rapidly decreasing antibody titers have led to questions regarding the efficacy of humoral immunity alone. The relevance of T cell memory after coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) remains unclear. Here, we investigated SARS-CoV-2 antibody and T cell responses in matched samples of COVID-19 convalescent individuals up to 6 months after infection. Longitudinal analysis revealed decreasing and stable spike- and nucleocapsid-specific antibody responses, respectively. In contrast, functional T cell responses remained robust, and even increased, in both frequency and intensity. Single peptide mapping of T cell diversity over time identified open reading frame-independent, dominant T cell epitopes mediating long-term SARS-CoV-2 T cell responses. Identification of these epitopes may be fundamental for COVID-19 vaccine design.","Bilich, Tatjana; Nelde, Annika; Heitmann, Jonas S; Maringer, Yacine; Roerden, Malte; Bauer, Jens; Rieth, Jonas; Wacker, Marcel; Peter, Andreas; Hörber, Sebastian; Rachfalski, David; Märklin, Melanie; Stevanovic, Stefan; Rammensee, Hans-Georg; Salih, Helmut R; Walz, Juliane S",Sci. transl. med,,0

294882,Mortality and use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in COVID 19 disease: a systematic review,2020,"Microwave ablation (MWA) is an alternative locoregional therapy to surgical resection of solid tumors in the treatment of malignancies, and is widely used for hepatic tumors. It has a slightly higher overall survival (OS) rate compared to external beam radiation therapy (EBRT), and proton beam therapy (PBT), and better long-term recurrence-free OS rate compared to radiofrequency ablation (RFA). In this paper, current commercial devices, most recent noncommercial designs, and the principles behind them alongside the recently reported developments and issues of MWA are reviewed. The paper also provides microscopic insights on effects of microwave irradiation in the body. Our review shows that MWA is a safe and effective, minimally invasive method with high ablation completion rates. However, for large tumors, the completion rates slightly decrease, and recurrences increase. Thus, for large tumors we suggest using a cooled shaft antenna or multiple antenna placements. Comparisons of the two common ablation frequencies 915 MHz and 2.45 GHz have shown inconsistent results due to non-identical conditions. This review suggests that 915 MHz devices are more effective for ablating large tumors and the theory behind MWA effects corroborates this proposition. However, for small tumors or tumors adjacent to vital organs, 2.45 GHz is suggested due to its more localized ablation zone. Among the antenna designs, the double-slot antenna with a metallic choke seems to be more effective by localizing the radiation around the tip of the antenna, while also preventing backward radiation towards the skin. The review also pertains to the use of MWA in COVID-19 patients and risk factors associated with the disease. MWA should be considered for COVID-19 patients with hepatic tumors as a fast treatment with a short recovery time. As liver injury is also a risk due to COVID-19, it is recommended to apply liver function tests to monitor abnormal levels in alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total bilirubin, and other liver function indicators.","Afaghi, P.; Lapolla, M.

297115,Vaccine development lessons between HIV and COVID-19,2021,"During the pandemic context, diagnostic algorithms had to be adapted considering the decimated medical personnel, local technical resources, and the likelihood of contamination. Given the higher probability of thrombotic complications related to COVID-19 and the availability of a dual-layer spectral computed tomography (CT) scanner, we have recently adopted the use of low-dose, non-gated, chest CT scans performed five minutes after contrast administration among patients admitted with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) undergoing cerebrovascular CT angiography. Dual-layer spectral CT comprises a single X-ray source and two-layer detector with different photon-absorption capabilities. In addition to conventional images, the two distinct energy datasets obtained enable multiparametric spectral analysis without need to change the original scanning protocol. The two spectral features that emerge as most useful for patients with AIS are virtual monoenergetic imaging and iodine-based results. Aside from the evaluation of lung parenchyma, this novel strategy enables ruling out cardioembolic sources and simultaneously providing evidence of pulmonary and myocardial injury in a single session and immediately after CT cerebrovascular angiography. Furthermore, it involves a noninvasive, seemingly accurate, unsophisticated, safer (very low radiation dose and no contrast administration), and cheaper tool for ruling out cardioembolic sources compared to transesophageal echocardiogram and cardiac CT. Accordingly, we sought to standardize the technical aspects and overview the usefulness of delayed-phase, lowdose chest spectral CT in patients admitted with AIS.","Rodriguez-Granillo, Gaston A; Cirio, Juan J; Ciardi, Celina; Caballero, Maria L; Diluca, Pablo; Castrillon, Ricardo; Ceron, Marcos; Scrivano, Esteban; Lylyk, Pedro",,,0
297147,Comparative diagnostic performance of rapid antigen detection tests for COVID-19 in a hospital setting,2021,"BACKGROUND: Acute pancreatitis (AP), one of the most common clinical emergencies, is characterized by variable clinical features and inadequate diagnostic methods. At present, the commonly used indicators do not have high specificity and do not necessarily reflect disease severity. We therefore aimed to investigate diagnostic and prognostic value of plasma procalcitonin, heparin-binding protein, and interleukin-6 for acute pancreatitis by separate detection and joint detection. METHODS: The study involved 451 participants, including 343 AP patients and 108 healthy controls. We analyzed the association of the three biomarkers with the severity and prognosis of AP. RESULTS: A statistically significant increase in the mean plasma analyte levels was detected in the study group compared to the control group. Multivariate comparison showed that plasma levels of PCT, HBP, and IL-6 were all significantly different among the three groups at different sampling times (1st, 3rd, 7th, and 10th day of admission) (p < 0.01). The combination of the three indicators had significantly higher diagnostic value than either the individual markers or pairwise combinations (p < 0.001). The levels of the three were all significantly higher in severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) patients than in non-SAP patients (p < 0.001); meanwhile, patients with high levels had a worse prognosis than those with low levels (p < 0.05). In multivariate analysis adjusted for age and sex, high levels of PCT, HBP, and IL-6 were found to be independently associated with the development of AP. CONCLUSIONS: It dramatically improved the diagnostic power of AP when PCT, HBP, and IL-6 were combined; high PCT, HBP, and IL-6 levels within 3 days of admission may be the potentially useful indicators for predicting SAP.","Zhong, Yuhong; Yu, Zhongqi; Wang, Lin; Yang, Xufeng",J Clin Lab Anal,,0
297148,Comparative diagnostic performance of rapid antigen detection tests for COVID-19 in a hospital setting,2021,"Several cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection transmitted from human owners to their dogs have recently been reported. The first ever case of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from a human owner to a domestic cat was confirmed on March 27, 2020. A tiger from a zoo in New York, USA, was also reportedly infected with SARS-CoV-2. It is believed that SARS-CoV-2 was transmitted to tigers from their caretakers, who were previously infected with this virus. On May 25, 2020, the Dutch Minister of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality reported that two employees were infected with SARS-CoV-2 transmitted from minks. These reports have influenced us to perform a comparative analysis among angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) homologous proteins for verifying the conservation of specific protein regions. One of the most conserved peptides is represented by the peptide ""353-KGDFR-357 (H. sapiens ACE2 residue numbering), which is located on the surface of the ACE2 molecule and participates in the binding of SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding domain (RBD). Multiple sequence alignments of the ACE2 proteins by ClustalW, whereas the three-dimensional structure of its binding region for the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 was assessed by means of Spanner, a structural homology modeling pipeline method. In addition, evolutionary phylogenetic tree analysis by ETE3 was used. ACE2 works as a receptor for the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein between humans, dogs, cats, tigers, minks, and other animals, except for snakes. The three-dimensional structure of the KGDFR hosting protein region involved in direct interactions with SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD of the mink ACE2 appears to form a loop structurally related to the human ACE2 corresponding protein loop, despite of the reduced available protein length (401 residues of the mink ACE2 available sequence vs 805 residues of the human ACE2). The multiple sequence alignments of the ACE2 proteins shows high homology and complete conservation of the five amino acid residues: 353-KGDFR-357 with humans, dogs, cats, tigers, minks, and other animals, except for snakes. Where the information revealed from our examinations can support precision vaccine design and the discovery of antiviral therapeutics, which will accelerate the development of medical countermeasures, the World Health Organization recently reported on the possible risks of reciprocal infections regarding SARS-CoV-2 transmission from animals to humans.","Hayashi, Takuma; Abiko, Kaoru; Mandai, Masaki; Yaegashi, Nobuo; Konishi, Ikuo",Vet Q,,0

The other pandemic coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV), share a considerable level of similarities at genomic and protein levels. However, the differences between them lead to distinct behaviors. These differences result from the accumulation of mutations in the sequence and structure of spike (S) glycoprotein, which plays an essential role in coronavirus infection, pathogenicity, transmission, and evolution. In this review, we brought together many studies narrating a sequence of events and highlighting the differences among S proteins from SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2.

This article addresses the importance of enacting crisis standards of care (CSC) as a policy mechanism to facilitate the shift to population-based medicine. In times of emergencies and crises such as this pandemic, the enactment of CSC enables concrete decisions to be made by governments relating to supply chains, resource allocation and provision of care to maximize societal benefit. This shift from an individual to a population-based societal focus has profound consequences on how clinical decisions are made at the point of care. Failing to enact CSC may have psychological impacts for healthcare providers particularly related to moral distress, through an inability to fully enact individual beliefs (individually focused clinical decisions) which form their moral compass.","Hertelendy, Attila J; Ciottone, Gregory R; Mitchell, Cheryl L; Gutberg, Jennifer; Burkle, Frederick M",Int. j. qual. health care,,0

The effectivity of vitamin D as a therapeutic intervention in critical illness remains less defined. The current study analyzed clinical and immunologic effects of vitamin D levels in patients suffering from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). METHODS: This was a single-center retrospective study in patients receiving intensive care with a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 ARDS. 25-hydroxyvitamin D and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D serum levels, pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and immune cell subsets were measured on admission as well as after 10-15 days. Clinical parameters were extracted from the patient data management system. Standard operating procedures included the daily administration of vitamin D3 via enteral feeding. RESULTS: A total of 39 patients with COVID-19 ARDS were eligible, of which 26 were included in this study as data on vitamin D status was available. 96% suffered from severe COVID-19 ARDS. All patients without prior vitamin D supplementation (n = 22) had deficient serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D. Vitamin D supplementation resulted in higher serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D but not did not increase 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels after 10-15 days. Clinical parameters did not differ between patients with sufficient or deficient levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D. Only circulating plasmablasts were higher in patients with 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels &#8805;30 ng/ml (p = 0.029). Patients with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels below 20 pg/ml required longer mechanical ventilation (p = 0.045) and had a worse acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) II score (p = 0.048). CONCLUSION: The vast majority of COVID-19 ARDS patients had vitamin D deficiency. 25-hydroxyvitamin D status was not related to changes in clinical course, whereas low levels of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D were associated with prolonged mechanical ventilation and a worse APACHE II score.","Notz, Quirin; Herrmann, Johannes; Schlesinger, Tobias; Kranke, Peter; Sitter, Magdalena; Helmer, Philipp; Stumpner, Jan; Roeder, Daniel; Amrein, Karin; Stoppe, Christian; Lotz, Christopher; Meybohm, Patrick",Clin. nutr.

The results indicate that the introduction of a UBI/Flat Tax system in the country could be both extremely effective in reducing poverty and inequality and economically viable.","Siqueira, Rozane Bezerra de; Nogueira, Jose Ricardo Bezerra",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.06020v2.pdf,0

None yet has proved to be an effective cure, but progress in controlling the disease has been made. In June 2020 we published an article that described the mechanistic rationale behind the repurposing of seven licensed drugs in clinical trials for the treatment of COVID-19 and reviewed synthetic routes to these drugs. Several developments have occurred since then. Remdesivir (trade name Veklury) has been approved for use in the U.S. and Europe. Dexamethasone, a steroid drug first approved in 1959, has shown mortality reduction in severe COVID patients. Molnupiravir, a new and promising oral antiviral drug, is being studied in late-stage clinical trials. In this review, we update synthetic work that has been recently published on remdesivir, provide an overview of several routes to molnupiravir, and review classical routes to dexamethasone as well as some of those more recently developed. ©","Hughes, D.

317850,Can Users Search Trends Predict People Scares or Disease Breakout? An Examination of Infectious Skin Diseases in the United States,2020,"Recent studies have provided insights into the pathogenesis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)1-4. However, the longitudinal immunological correlates of disease outcome remain unclear. Here we serially analysed immune responses in 113 patients with moderate or severe COVID-19. Immune profiling revealed an overall increase in innate cell lineages, with a concomitant reduction in T cell number. An early elevation in cytokine levels was associated with worse disease outcomes. Following an early increase in cytokines, patients with moderate COVID-19 displayed a progressive reduction in type 1 (antiviral) and type 3 (antifungal) responses. By contrast, patients with severe COVID-19 maintained these elevated responses throughout the course of the disease. Moreover, severe COVID-19 was accompanied by an increase in multiple type 2 (anti-helminths) effectors, including interleukin-5 (IL-5), IL-13, immunoglobulin E and eosinophils. Unsupervised clustering analysis identified four immune signatures, representing growth factors (A), type-2/3 cytokines (B), mixed type-1/2/3 cytokines (C), and chemokines (D) that correlated with three distinct disease trajectories. The immune profiles of patients who recovered from moderate COVID-19 were enriched in tissue reparative growth factor signature A, whereas the profiles of those with who developed severe disease had elevated levels of all four signatures. Thus, we have identified a maladapted immune response profile associated with severe COVID-19 and poor clinical outcome, as well as early immune signatures that correlate with divergent disease trajectories.","Lucas, Carolina; Wong, Patrick; Klein, Jon; Castro, Tiago B R; Silva, Julio; Sundaram, Maria; Ellingson, Mallory K; Mao, Tianyang; Oh, Ji Eun; Israelow, Benjamin; Takahashi, Takehiro; Tokuyama, Maria; Lu, Peiwen; Venkataraman, Arvind; Park, Annsea; Mohanty, Subhasis; Wang, Haowei; Wyllie, Anne L; Vogels, Chantal B F; Earnest, Rebecca; Lapidus, Sarah; Ott, Isabel M; Moore, Adam J; Muenker, M Catherine; Fournier, John B; Campbell, Melissa; Odio, Camila D; Casanovas-Massana, Arnau; Herbst, Roy; Shaw, Albert C; Medzhitov, Ruslan; Schulz, Wade L; Grubaugh, Nathan D; Dela Cruz, Charles; Farhadian, Shelli; Ko, Albert I; Omer, Saad B; Iwasaki, Akiko",Nature,,0

Although the majority of infected people experience mild disease, some patients develop a serious disease, especially when other pathologies concur. For this reason, it would be very convenient to find pharmacological and immunological mechanisms that help control SARS-CoV-2 infection. Since the COVID-19 and BCoV viruses are very close phylogenetically, different studies demonstrate the existence of cross-immunity as they retain shared epitopes in their structure. As a possible control measure against COVID-19, we propose the use of cow's milk immune to BCoV. Thus, the antigenic recognition of some highly conserved structures of viral proteins, particularly M and S2, by anti-BCoV antibodies present in milk would cause a total or partial inactivation of SARS-COV-2 (acting as a particular vaccine) and be addressed more easily by GALT's highly specialized antigen-presenting cells, thus helping the specific immune response.","Arenas, Antonio; Borge, Carmen; Carbonero, Alfonso; Garcia-Bocanegra, Ignacio; Cano-Terriza, David; Caballero, Javier; Arenas-Montes, Antonio",Front Immunol,,0
333323,Relating angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers with incidence or mortality of COVID-19,2020,"Modes of teaching and learning have had to rapidly shift amid the COVID-19 pandemic. As an emergency response, students from Philippine public schools were provided learning modules based on a minimized list of essential learning competencies in Biology. Using a cross-sectional survey method, we investigated students' perceptions of the Biology self-learning modules (BSLM) that were designed in print and digitized formats according to a constructivist learning approach. Senior high school STEM students from grades 11 (n = 117) and 12 (n = 104) participated in a survey using a 3-point Likert-scale questionnaire uploaded online through Google Forms. The survey results indicate that majority of the students perceived the modules positively, suggesting that aspects of the modules that were salient to students corresponded to essential elements of constructivist pedagogies. However, during interviews, students reported several difficulties in learning with BSLM as it was constrained by, to name a few, the use of unfamiliar words, lack of access to supporting resources, slow internet connection, and time constraints. To address these problems, teachers reported that they gave deadline extensions, complemented modules with other channels of support, and used online and offline platforms for reaching out to students to answer their queries and plan out their schedule for the week. The findings across the data sources point to the complex demands of emergency distance education that teachers, as curriculum designers and enactors, need to bear in mind in order to craft productive pedagogies, constructivist or otherwise, during this unprecedented time. © 2021 The authors and IJLTER.ORG.

In the United States, these problems have been particularly evident, as systemic fragmentation through federalism has frustrated a coordinated response. Rather than working together, states and localities are competing over limited medical resources, while the federal government has not stepped in to alleviate burdens on the lower tiers of government. In this study, we introduce how procurement is managed under normal circumstances and how it changes during emergencies. Easing procurement rules comes with necessary tradeoffs, particularly involving equity and accountability. Using case studies from recent disasters, we identify procurement and management recommendations for the COVID-19 response and future emergencies. We conclude that public procurement is integral to effective management in the 21st century and must be treated as such in the study and practice of public administration and emergency management. © 2020 Weston Medical Publishing.

Non-invasive sampling methods are advantageous to reduce the need for venepuncture, which may be a barrier to investigations particularly in paediatric populations. Oral Fluids are obtained by gingiva-crevicular sampling from children and adults and are very well accepted. ELISA based on these samples have acceptable sensitivity and specificity compared to conventional serum-based antibody ELISAs and are suitable for population-based surveillance. We describe the development and evaluation of SARS-COV-2 IgG ELISAs using SARS-CoV-2 viral nucleoprotein (NP) and spike (S) proteins in IgG isotype capture format and an indirect receptor-binding-domain (RBD) IgG ELISA, intended for use in children. All three assays were assessed using a panel of 1999 paired serum and oral fluids from children and adults participating in national primary school SARS-CoV-2 surveillance studies during and after the first and second pandemic wave in the UK. The anti NP IgG capture assay was the best candidate, with an overall sensitivity of 75% (95% CI: 71-79%) specificity of 99% (95% CI: 78-99%) when compared with paired serum antibodies measured using a commercial assay SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein IgG assay (Abbott, Chicago, IL, USA). Higher sensitivity was observed in children (80%, 95% CI: 71-88%) compared to adults (67%, CI: 60%-74%). Oral fluid assays using spike protein and RBD antigens were also 99% specific and achieved reasonable but lower sensitivity in the target population (78%, 95% CI (68%-86%) and 53%, 95% CI (43%-64%), respectively).

349159,Projected HIV and Bacterial STI Incidence Following COVID-Related Sexual Distancing and Clinical Service Interruption,2021,"BACKGROUND: To date, no immunological data on COVID-19 heterologous vaccination schedules in humans have been reported. We assessed the immunogenicity and reactogenicity of BNT162b2 (Comirnaty, BioNTech, Mainz, Germany) administered as second dose in participants primed with ChAdOx1-S (Vaxzevria, AstraZeneca, Oxford, UK). METHODS: We did a phase 2, open-label, randomised, controlled trial on adults aged 18-60 years, vaccinated with a single dose of ChAdOx1-S 8-12 weeks before screening, and no history of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Participants were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive either BNT162b2 (0·3 mL) via a single intramuscular injection (intervention group) or continue observation (control group). The primary outcome was 14-day immunogenicity, measured by immunoassays for SARS-CoV-2 trimeric spike protein and receptor binding domain (RBD). Antibody functionality was assessed using a pseudovirus neutralisation assay, and cellular immune response using an interferon-Î³ immunoassay. The safety outcome was 7-day reactogenicity, measured as solicited local and systemic adverse events. The primary analysis included all participants who received at least one dose of BNT162b2 and who had at least one efficacy evaluation after baseline. The safety analysis included all participants who received BNT162b2. This study is registered with EudraCT (2021-001978-37) and ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04860739), and is ongoing. FINDINGS: Between April 24 and 30, 2021, 676 individuals were enrolled and randomly assigned to either the intervention group (n=450) or control group (n=226) at five university hospitals in Spain (mean age 44 years [SD 9]; 382 [57%] women and 294 [43%] men). 663 (98%) participants (n=441 intervention, n=222 control) completed the study up to day 14. In the intervention group, geometric mean titres of RBD antibodies increased from 71·46 BAU/mL (95% CI 59·84-85·33) at baseline to 7756·68 BAU/mL (7371·53-8161·96) at day 14 (p<0·0001). IgG against trimeric spike protein increased from 98·40 BAU/mL (95% CI 85·69-112·99) to 3684·87 BAU/mL (3429·87-3958·83). The interventional:control ratio was 77·69 (95% CI 59·57-101·32) for RBD protein and 36·41 (29·31-45·23) for trimeric spike protein IgG. Reactions were mild (n=1210 [68%]) or moderate (n=530 [30%]), with injection site pain (n=395 [88%]), induration (n=159 [35%]), headache (n=199 [44%]), and myalgia (n=194 [43%]) the most commonly reported adverse events. No serious adverse events were reported. INTERPRETATION: BNT162b2 given as a second dose in individuals prime vaccinated with ChAdOx1-S induced a robust immune response, with an acceptable and manageable reactogenicity profile.

349289,Comparative Impacts of ACE (Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme) Inhibitors Versus Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers on the Risk of COVID-19 Mortality,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Smell and taste loss are characteristic symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The aim of this study is to investigate the prevalence and risk factors associated with olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions in coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patients. METHODS: We conducted an observational, retrospective study on 376 patients with documented SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted to the San Gerardo Hospital in Monza, Italy, from March to July 2020. All patients answered a phone questionnaire providing information on age, sex, smoking status, and clinical characteristics. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated through logistic regression models including relevant covariates. RESULTS: The prevalence of olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions in COVID-19 patients was 33.5 and 35.6%, respectively. Olfactory dysfunctions were significantly directly associated with current smoking and history of allergy, the multivariable ORs being 6.53 (95% CI 1.16-36.86) for current smokers versus never smokers, and 1.89 (95% CI 1.05-3.39) for those with an allergy compared to those without any allergy. Respiratory allergy in particular was significantly associated with olfactory dysfunctions (multivariable OR 2.30, 95% CI 1.02-5.17). Significant inverse associations were observed for patients aged 60 years or more (multivariable OR 0.33, 95% CI 0.19-0.57) and hospitalization (multivariable OR 0.22, 95% CI 0.06-0.89). Considering gustatory dysfunctions, after allowance of other variables a significant direct association was found for respiratory allergies (OR 2.24, 95% CI 1.03-4.86), and an inverse association was found only for hospitalization (OR 0.21, 95% CI 0.06-0.76). CONCLUSION: Our study indicates that current smoking and history of allergy (particularly respiratory) significantly increase the risk for smell loss in COVID-19 patients; the latter is also significantly associated to taste loss. Hospitalization has an inverse association with the risk of olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions, suggesting that these may be symptoms characteristics of less severe SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Galluzzi, Francesca; Rossi, Veronica; Bosetti, Cristina; Garavello, Werner",Neuroepidemiology,,0

The aim is to discover their perceptions and opinions about their experiences during the learning process and what they have experienced during this global emergency and period of home confinement. The sample is made up of 100 students from the Primary Education Degree programme and the research was carried out through a qualitative study of the questionnaire. The results, divided into categories of each educational model, show the interpretation that the students make of the current reality and their own learning process. The most important aspect of the face-to-face learning model, according to 75% of the students, is direct communication with the teacher, and for 88% of them this model was effective. For the e-learning model, the flexible schedule, the economic savings and explanatory videos are the relevant ideas that the students express, with 68% stating that it was an effective model. The main conclusion is that the students prefer to continue with the face-to-face learning process (49%) rather than online teaching (7%) or, failing that, mixed or blended learning (44%), where the theoretical classes could be online and the practical classes could be face-to-face.","Costado Dios, María Teresa Piñero Charlo José Carlos",Education Sciences,,0

Until a vaccine is developed, and it reaches high levels of distribution, everyone must continue to be diligent to limit the viral spread. The practice of assisted reproduction during this pandemic presents unique challenges in addition to the risks identified in general clinical care. The established good tissue practices employed in laboratories are not designed to protect gametes and embryos from an airborne virus, particularly one that may be shed by an asymptomatic staff member. Armed with theoretical risks but lacking direct evidence, assisted-reproduction teams must examine every aspect of their practice, identify areas at a risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2, and develop a mitigation plan. Several professional fertility societies have created guidelines for the best practices in patient care during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. As we learn more about SARS-CoV-2, updates have been issued to help adapt infection-control and -prevention protocols. This review discusses what is currently known about SARS-CoV-2 infection risks in assisted reproductive centers and recommends the implementation of specific mitigation strategies.","Sparks, Amy E T; Kresowik, Jessica D",Fertil Steril,,0

360089,Seroprevalence of human coronaviruses among patients visiting hospital-based sentinel sites in Uganda,2021,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has led to global disruption of healthcare. Many students volunteered to provide clinical support. Volunteering to work in a clinical capacity was a unique medical education opportunity; however, it is unknown whether this was a positive learning experience or which volunteering roles were of most benefit to students. METHODS: The COVIDReady2 study is a national cross-sectional study of all medical students at medical schools in the United Kingdom. The primary outcome is to explore the experiences of medical students who volunteered during the pandemic in comparison to those who did not. We will compare responses to determine the educational benefit and issues they faced. In addition to quantitative analysis, thematic analysis will be used to identify themes in qualitative responses. DISCUSSION: There is a growing body of evidence to suggest that service roles have potential to enhance medical education; yet, there is a shortage of studies able to offer practical advice for how these roles may be incorporated in future medical education. We anticipate that this study will help to identify volunteer structures that have been beneficial for students, so that similar infrastructures can be used in the future, and help inform medical education in a non-pandemic setting.

and cardiac troponin-I) Troponin-I levels of less than 0 07 ng / ml were considered normal, as suggested by Sleeper et al Results and conclusion Clinical and anatomical analysis showed that in dogs the development of acute heart failure with myocarditis was promoted by the viral etiology of the development of the primary provoking factor like parvovirus enteritis or coronavirus enteritis Moreover, parvovirus enteritis has a paramount role in the development of myocarditis in dogs as the most formidable complication Given the pathogenetic features of development, clinical pathological criteria can distinguish fulminant lymphocytic myocarditis from acute lymphocytic myocarditis, which determines the prognosis of the disease Diagnostic criteria of myocarditis in the development of acute heart failure in dogs with the course of viral enteritis include troponin I, which has high specificity (89 %) but limited sensitivity (34 %) in the diagnosis of myocarditis, as biomarkers Our clinical and experimental data indicate that an elevated level of cardiac troponin I is more diagnostically reliable than an elevated level of creatine kinase in the development of acute myocarditis Актуальность Сердечная недостаточность у собак может привести к летальному исходу, ее причиной могут быть болезни заразной этиологии В настоящее время не определены основные этиологические факторы, которые влияют на прогноз заболевания Также отсутствует алгоритм клинико-диагностических критериев диагностики и терапевтической коррекции миокардита на фоне острой сердечной недостаточности у собак В связи с этим изучение особенностей клинического и патогенетического течения осложнений, анализ клинико-анатомических данных при болезнях вирусной этиологии с развитием миокардита у собак, имеет особо актуальное значение Материалы и методы В исследование включали собак с клиническими признаками нарушений со стороны сердечно-сосудистой системы, которые проявлялись одышкой при физической нагрузке, кашлем, цианозом видимых слизистых оболочек В дальнейшем проводили специальное клиническое обследование, рентгенологические, лабораторные методы исследований Животным проводили электрокардиографическое (ЭКГ) и эхокардиографическое обследование ЭКГ проводили с использованием устройства BTL SD08® (BTL, UK) в стандартных отведениях aVR, aVL и aVF Эхокардиографическое исследование, выполненное в стандартных условиях с использованием аппарата ультразвуковой диагностики Mindray DC-60, включало: диаметр левого предсердия до аорты, конечные систолические и конечные диастолические измерения левого желудочка, оценку сокращения левого желудочка фракции и фракции выброса, скорость кровотока через аортальные и легочные клапаны и оценку функции атриовентрикулярных клапанов Кроме того, все собаки подверглись общему анализу крови (аланинаминотрансфераза, аспартатаминотрансфераза, мочевина, креатинин, электролитный состав крови Na+, K+ Mg2+, Cl -

363783,Preliminary Assessment of Acute Kidney Injury in Critically Ill Children Associated with SARS-CoV-2 Infection: A Multicenter Cross-Sectional Analysis,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Emergency medicine (EM) is a high-risk specialty for burnout. COVID-19 has had and will continue to have important consequences on wellness and burnout for EM physicians in Canada. Baseline data are crucial to monitor the health of EM physicians in Canada, and evaluate any interventions designed to help during and after COVID-19. OBJECTIVES: To describe the rates of burnout, depression, and suicidality in practicing EM physicians in Canada, just before the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A modified snowball method was used for survey distribution. Participants completed the Maslach Burnout Inventory - Health Services Tool (MBI-HSS), a screening measure for depression (PHQ-9), and a question regarding if the physician had ever or in the past 12 months contemplated suicide. RESULTS: A total of 384 respondent surveys were included in the final analysis: 86.1% (329/382) met at least one of the criteria for burnout, 58% (217/374) scored minimal to none on the PHQ-9 screening tool for depression, 14.3% (53/371) had contemplated suicide during their staff career in EM, and of those, 5.9% (22/371) had actively considered suicide in the past year. CONCLUSION: Canadian EM physicians just before the COVID-19 pandemic had an alarming number of respondents meet the threshold for burnout, confirming EM as a high-risk specialty. This important baseline information can be used to monitor the physical and mental risks to EM physicians during and after COVID-19, and evaluate support for mental health and wellness, which is urgently needed now and post pandemic.","Lim, Rodrick; Aarsen, Kristine Van; Gray, Sara; Rang, Louise; Fitzpatrick, Jada; Fischer, Lisa",CJEM,,0
364179,Primary care provider-reported prevalence of vaccine and polyethylene glycol allergy in Canada,2021,"In 'Ethics of sharing medical knowledge with the community: is the physician responsible for medical outreach during a pandemic?' Strous and Karni note that the revised physician's pledge in the World Medical Association Declaration of Geneva obligates individual physicians to share medical knowledge, which they interpret to mean a requirement to share knowledge publicly and through outreach. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, Strous and Karni defend a form of medical paternalism insofar as the individual physician must reach out to communities who may not want, or know to seek out, medical advice, for reasons of public health and health equity. Strous and Karni offer a novel defence of why physicians ought to intervene even in insular communities, and they offer suggestions for how this could be done in culturally sensitive ways. Yet their view rests on an unfounded interpretation of the Geneva Declaration language. More problematically, their paper confuses shared and collective responsibility, misattributing the scope of individual physician obligations in potentially harmful ways. In response, this reply delineates between shared and collective responsibility, and suggests that to defend the obligation of medical outreach Strous and Karni propose, it is better conceptualised as a collective responsibility of the medical profession, rather than a shared responsibility of individual physicians. This interpretation rejects paternalism on the part of individual providers in favour of a more sensitive and collaborative practice of knowledge sharing between physicians and communities, and in the service of collective responsibility.","Lanphier, Elizabeth",J. med. ethics,,0

Novel Use of a Targeted Ultraviolet Light Device for the Decontamination of a Single-Use Filtering Facepiece Respirator,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has led to significant changes in healthcare systems and its impact on the treatment of cardiovascular conditions, such as ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), is unknown in countries where the healthcare systems were not saturated, as was the case in Portugal. As such, we aimed to assess the effect on STEMI admissions and outcomes in Portuguese centers. METHODS: We conducted a single-center, observational, retrospective study including all patients admitted to our hospital due to STEMI between the date of the first SARS-CoV-2 case diagnosed in Portugal and the end of the state of emergency (March and April 2020). Patient characteristics and outcomes were assessed and compared with the same period of 2019. RESULTS: A total of 104 STEMI patients were assessed, 55 in 2019 and 49 in 2020 (-11%). There were no significant differences between groups regarding age (62±12 vs. 65±14 years, p=0.308), gender (84.8% vs. 77.6% males, p=0.295) or comorbidities. In the 2020 group, there was a significant decrease in the proportion of patients transported to the hospital in pre-hospital emergency medical transportation (38.2% vs. 20.4%, p=0.038), an increase in system delay (49 [30-110.25] vs. 140 [90-180] minutes, p=0.019), a higher Killip-Kimball class, with a decrease in class I (74.5% vs. 51%) and an increase in class III (1.8% vs. 8.2%) and IV (5.5% vs. 18.4%) (p=0.038), a greater incidence of vasoactive support (3.7% vs. 26.5%, p=0.001), invasive mechanic ventilation usage (3.6% vs. 14.3%, p=0.056), and an increase in severe left ventricular dysfunction at hospital discharge (3.6% vs. 16.3%, p=0.03). In-hospital mortality was 14.3% in the 2020 group and 7.3% in the 2019 group p=0.200). CONCLUSION: Despite a lack of significant variation in the absolute number of STEMI admissions, there was an increase in STEMI clinical severity and significantly worse outcomes during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. An increase in system delay, impaired pre-hospital care and patient fear of in-hospital infection can partially justify these results and should be the target of future actions in further waves of the pandemic.","Azul Freitas, André; Baptista, Rui; Gonçalves, Valdirene; Ferreira, Cátia; Milner, James; Lourenço, Carolina; Costa, Susana; Franco, Fátima; Monteiro, Sílvia; Gonçalves, Francisco; Gonçalves, Lino",Rev. port. cardiol,,0

It discusses how schools and teachers have had to make a sudden shift to a largely on-line modality, and the effects of these on teaching and learning in music. It asks questions of curriculum and assessment, especially with regard to the fact that classroom teachers in England are having to use their professional judgment to provide grades for external examinations, where hitherto these would have come from examination boards. It questions the ways in which teachers have been inadequately prepared and supported for this, by years of neoliberal undermining of confidence.

The types of rapid learning envisioned to address Covid-19 and future public health crises require a systems approach that enables sharing of data and lessons learned at scale. Agreement on a systems approach augmented by technology and standards will be foundational to making such learning meaningful and to ensuring its scientific integrity. With this purpose in mind, a group of individuals from Spain, Italy, and the United States have formed a transatlantic collaboration, with the aim of generating a proposed comprehensive standards-based systems approach and data-driven framework for collection, management, and analysis of high-quality data. This framework will inform decisions in managing clinical responses and social measures to overcome the Covid-19 global pandemic and to prepare for future public health crises. We first argue that standardized data of the type now common in global regulated clinical research is the essential fuel that will power a global system for addressing (and preventing) current and future pandemics. We then present a blueprint for a system that will put these data to use in driving a range of key decisions. In the context of this system, we describe and categorize the specific types of data the system will require for different purposes and document the standards currently in use for each of these categories in the three nations participating in this work. In so doing, we anticipate some of the challenges to harmonizing these data but also suggest opportunities for further global standardization and harmonization. While we have scaled this transnational effort to three nations, we hope to stimulate an international dialogue with a culmination of realizing such a system.","Ros, Francisco; Kush, Rebecca; Friedman, Charles; Gil Zorzo, Esther; Rivero Corte, Pablo; Rubin, Joshua C; Sanchez, Borja; Stocco, Paolo; Van Houweling, Douglas",Learn Health Syst,,0

Hematological patients as immunocompromised hosts are vulnerable to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. There is little information available regarding the clinical features of hematological patients concomitant with COVID-19. In this study, 9 concomitant patients were analyzed for their clinical manifestations, laboratory data, radiological findings, and immunologic features. The median age was 50 years (range, 17-68 years) and 6 patients were male. Seven patients were infected through hospital-associated transmission and other 2 through community-associated transmission. Onset of COVID-19 in all patients occurred during routine treatments for their hematological diseases. Eight patients were classified as moderate and 1 patient as critically ill COVID-19. Four patients died, 1 from leukemia progression, 2 from life-threatening secondary infection, and the other from respiratory failure caused by COVID-19. Abruptly elevated levels of cytokines were often correlated with progressive hematological disease or concurrent bacterial infections. Two patients had atypical computed tomography (CT) imaging findings of COVID-19. The median interval from the first CT scan imaging to improvement in survivors was 40 days (range, 14-51 days). Four of 5 survivors had negative serological tests 1 month after symptom onset. Positive viral load in 4 survivors lasted longer than 45 days. Our results indicated concomitant patients formed a distinct subgroup characterized by atypical clinical features, defective viral clearance, and lower level of SARS-CoV-2-specific Abs. Targeted therapies that impair host humoral immunity should be avoided. These findings will be helpful to tailor appropriate management for the concomitant patients.","Zhou, Xiaoxi; Wang, Gaoxiang; Chen, Liting; Meng, Fankai; Huang, Liang; Huang, Lifang; Wang, Na; Li, Tongjuan; Cao, Yang; Zhou, Jianfeng",Cancer Sci,,0

The reciprocal role of SARS-CoV-2 and Bc, their potential interactions and the contribution of the individual therapies to the favourable outcome are unclear. It is debatable whether it was SARS-CoV2 that triggered a Bc pulmonary exacerbation or if the chronic Bc infection facilitated the development of a COVID-19 more aggressive than usually seen in CF. If the latter hypothesis were confirmed by similar cases, Bc colonization should be regarded as a risk factor for severe COVID-19 expression in CF.","Olcese, C; Casciaro, R; Pirlo, D; Debbia, C; Castagnola, E; Cresta, F; Castellani, C",J. cyst. fibros,,0

The study employed the general screening model. The study group comprised 24 music teachers working in the central district of Kastamonu, a city in the north-west of Turkey. An interview form was developed to obtain the music teachers' views about the conduct of online lessons. Necessary permissions were obtained, and the interview form was distributed to the participants via e-mail. The data obtained from the interview forms were tried to be interpreted within theme tables by taking the opinions of the experts. The study employed the content analysis method, one of the qualitative data analysis methods. The study found that the majority of secondary school music teachers thought that distance education was not suitable for music lessons. It was also determined that most of the participants had no prior experience with distance education, had difficulty using instruments in online lessons, and had synchronization problems in all music activities. Furthermore, internet connection problems, low motivation on the student side, the inefficiency of online lessons, digital fatigue, and the risk of children being exposed to harmful content on the internet emerged as other problems encountered by the participants.","Akarsu, Sitki",Educational Policy Analysis and Strategic Research,,0

High specificity was reached by acute liver failure associated by COVID-19 (0.94, 95% CI: 0.71-0.99) and platelet count (0.94, 95% CI: 0.71-0.99) in the case of mortality; chronic liver disease (CLD) (0.98, 95% CI: 0.96-0.99) and platelet count (0.82, 95% CI: 0.72-0.89) in the case of ICU requirement; and CLD (0.97, 95% CI: 0.95-0.98), chronic hepatitis B infection (0.97, 95% CI: 0.95-0.98), platelet count (0.86, 95% CI: 0.77-0.91), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (0.80, 95% CI: 0.66-0.89) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (0.84, 95% CI: 0.77-0.88) activities considering severe COVID-19. High sensitivity was found in the case of C-reactive protein (CRP) for ICU requirement (0.92, 95% CI: 0.80-0.97) and severe COVID-19 (0.91, 95% CI: 0.82-0.96). Conclusion: On-admission platelet count, ALT and AST activities, CRP concentration, and the presence of acute and CLDs predicted the severe course of COVID-19. To highlight, pre-existing liver diseases or acute liver injury associated by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection plays an important role in the prediction of mortality.","Váncsa, Szilárd; Hegyi, Péter Jeno; Zádori, Noémi; Szakó, Lajos; Vörhendi, Nóra; Ocskay, Klementina; Földi, Mária; Dembrovszky, Fanni; Dömötör, Zsuzsa Réka; Jánosi, Kristóf; Rakonczay, Zoltán; Hartmann, Petra; Horváth, Tamara; Eross, Bálint; Kiss, Szabolcs; Szakács, Zsolt; Németh, Dávid; Hegyi, Péter; Pár, Gabriella",Front Med (Lausanne),,0

This study aimed to provide population-level information on racial/ethnic disparities in HIT use and associated trends among those living with chronic diseases. The study sample consisted of adult respondents (&#8805;18 years) of the 2011-2018 National Health Interview Survey living with at least 1 chronic condition. Binomial regression was used to analyze the association between race/ethnicity, year, and 4 measures of HIT use for patient-provider interaction. Regression parameter estimates were used to predict the trends in probability of the outcome variables across race/ethnicity. About 73% of the study sample were non-Hispanic Whites, 15% were non-Hispanic Blacks, and 13% were Hispanics. Compared to non-Hispanic Whites, there were decreased adjusted odds of any HIT use among non-Hispanic Blacks (OR = 0.72; 95% CI = 0.67, 0.76) and Hispanics (OR = 0.78; 95% CI = 0.72, 0.84). The likelihood of any HIT use increased with increasing year (OR: 1.16; 95% CI = 1.15, 1.18). Trends in racial/ethnic disparities were wider for email communication with provider and online prescription refill compared to online scheduling of appointment. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to accelerated adoption or expansion of HIT for patient care. Limited HIT use among non-Hispanic Blacks and Hispanics could worsen the disproportionate chronic disease burden, suboptimal clinical outcomes, and preventable health care costs experienced by this subpopulation. In conclusion, there is a need for intentional and strategic population-level interventions to increase HIT adoption and use among non-Hispanic Blacks and Hispanics living with chronic diseases.","Ojinnaka, Chinedum O; Adepoju, Omolola E",Popul. health manag.

We use a model of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission to estimate the health impact of different exit strategies. The strategy adopted in Italy kept the reproduction number Rt at values close to one until the end of September, with marginal regional differences. Based on the estimated postlockdown transmissibility, reopening of workplaces in selected industrial activities might have had a minor impact on the transmissibility. Reopening educational levels in May up to secondary schools might have influenced SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility only marginally; however, including high schools might have resulted in a marked increase of the disease burden. Earlier reopening would have resulted in disproportionately higher hospitalization incidence. Given community contacts in September, we project a large second wave associated with school reopening in the fall.","Marziano, Valentina; Guzzetta, Giorgio; Rondinone, Bruna Maria; Boccuni, Fabio; Riccardo, Flavia; Bella, Antonino; Poletti, Piero; Trentini, Filippo; Pezzotti, Patrizio; Brusaferro, Silvio; Rezza, Giovanni; Iavicoli, Sergio; Ajelli, Marco; Merler, Stefano",Proc.

407382,Development and evaluation of a serological test for diagnosis of COVID-19 with selected recombinant spike proteins,2020,"Importance: Chilblain-like lesions have been one of the most frequently described cutaneous manifestations during the COVID-19 pandemic. Their etiopathogenesis, including the role of SARS-CoV-2, remains elusive. Objective: To examine the association of chilblain-like lesions with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Design, Setting, and Participants: This prospective case series enrolled 17 adolescents who presented with chilblain-like lesions from April 1 to June 30, 2020, at a tertiary referral academic hospital in Italy. Main Outcomes and Measures: Macroscopic (clinical and dermoscopic) and microscopic (histopathologic) analysis contributed to a thorough understanding of the lesions. Nasopharyngeal swab, serologic testing, and in situ hybridization of the skin biopsy specimens were performed to test for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Laboratory tests explored signs of systemic inflammation or thrombophilia. Structural changes in peripheral microcirculation were investigated by capillaroscopy. Results: Of the 17 adolescents (9 [52.9%] male; median [interquartile range] age, 13.2 [12.5-14.3] years) enrolled during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, 16 (94.1%) had bilaterally localized distal erythematous or cyanotic lesions. A triad of red dots (16 [100%]), white rosettes (11 [68.8%]), and white streaks (10 [62.5%]) characterized the dermoscopic picture. Histologic analysis revealed a remodeling of the dermal blood vessels with a lobular arrangement, wall thickening, and a mild perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate. SARS-CoV-2 infection was excluded by molecular and serologic testing. In situ hybridization did not highlight the viral genome in the lesions. Conclusions and Relevance: This study delineated the clinical, histologic, and laboratory features of chilblain-like lesions that emerged during the COVID-19 pandemic, and its findings do not support their association with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The lesions occurred in otherwise healthy adolescents, had a long but benign course to self-resolution, and were characterized by a microvascular remodeling with perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate but no other signs of vasculitis. These results suggest that chilblain-like lesions do not imply a concomitant SARS-CoV-2 infection. Ongoing studies will help clarify the etiopathogenic mechanisms.","Discepolo, Valentina; Catzola, Andrea; Pierri, Luca; Mascolo, Massimo; Della Casa, Francesca; Vastarella, Maria; Smith, Grace; Travaglino, Antonio; Punziano, Alessandra; Nappa, Paola; Staibano, Stefania; Bruzzese, Eugenia; Fabbrocini, Gabriella; Guarino, Alfredo; Alessio, Maria",JAMA Netw Open,,0

414536,Do-not-intubate status and COVID-19 mortality in patients admitted to Dutch non-ICU wards,2021,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, is a potentially lethal, rapidly-expanding pandemic and many efforts are being carried out worldwide to understand and control the disease. COVID-19 patients may display a cytokine release syndrome, which causes severe lung inflammation, leading, in many instances, to death. OBJECTIVE: This paper is intended to explore the possibilities of controlling the COVID-19-associated hyperinflammation by using licensed drugs with anti-inflammatory effects. HYPOTHESIS: We have previously described that pentoxifylline alone, or in combination with oxypurinol, reduces the systemic inflammation caused by experimentally-induced pancreatitis in rats. Pentoxifylline is an inhibitor of TNF-&#945; production and oxypurinol inhibits xanthine oxidase. TNF-&#945;, in turn, activates other inflammatory genes such as Nos2, Icam or IL-6, which regulate migration and infiltration of neutrophils into the pulmonary interstitial tissue, causing injury to the lung parenchyma. In acute pancreatitis, the anti-inflammatory action of pentoxifylline seems to be mediated by the prevention of the rapid and presumably transient loss of PP2A activity. This may also occur in the hyperinflammatory -cytokine releasing phase- of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, it may be hypothesized that early treatment of COVID-19 patients with pentoxifylline, alone or in combination with oxypurinol, would prevent the potentially lethal acute respiratory distress syndrome. CONCLUSION: Pentoxifylline and oxypurinol are licensed drugs used for diseases other than COVID-19 and, therefore, phase I clinical trials would not be necessary for the administration to SARS-CoV-2- infected people. It would be worth investigating their potential effects against the hyperinflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 infection.","López-Iranzo, Francisco J; López-Rodas, Ana M; Franco, Luis; López-Rodas, Gerardo",Curr Pharm Des,,0

OBJECTIVE: To understand effects of the COVID-19 stay-at-home mandate and the inability to participate in recommended and structured physical interventions as a consequence of these mandates, specifically designed mobile assessments were used that collected both self-reporting information and objective task-based metrics of neurocognitive functions to assess symptom changes for individuals with PD. METHODS: Self-reporting questionnaires focusing on overall quality of life (e.g., when individuals typically feel at their best, changes in activity levels, and symptom progression) were given to all individuals (nâ=â28). In addition, mobile-based neurocognitive assessments were administered to a subset of the population (nâ=â8) to quantitatively assess changes due to COVID-19 restrictions. RESULTS: The highest self-reported factors in which individuals denoted feeling their best were after exercise (67.86%) and being in a comfortable and supportive environment (60.71%). Objective measures found overall duration of physical activity during the stay-at-home mandate decreased significantly (pâ=â0.022). With the lack of overall activity, 82.14%of individuals self-reported having at least one symptom that worsened moderately or higher. Further testing, using mobile-based assessments, showed average completion times of functional tasks increased, taking about 2.1 times longer, while accuracy metrics showed overall degradation. CONCLUSION: Although the COVID-19 stay-at-home mandate was intended to help protect individuals at high risk from coming into contact with the virus, it also prevented individuals from receiving recommended supervised exercise interventions resulting in significant negative effects in social well-being and across motor and speech neurocognitive tasks for individuals with PD.","Templeton, John Michael; Poellabauer, Christian; Schneider, Sandra",Journal of Parkinson&#039;s disease (Online),,0
414865,Persistence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in a male with metabolic syndrome for 72 days: A case report,2021,"Introduction: Despite advances in drug research and development, our knowledge of the underlying molecular mechanisms of many diseases remains inadequate. This have led to limited effective medicines for several diseases. To address these challenges, efficient strategies, novel technologies, and policies are urgently needed. The main obstacles in drug discovery and development are the mounting cost, risk, and time frame needed to develop new medicines. Fair pricing and accessibility is another unmet global challenge. Areas covered: Here, the authors cover the pace, risks, cost, and challenges facing drug development processes. Additionally, they introduce disease-associated data which demand global attention and propose solutions to overcome these challenges. Expert opinion: The massive challenges encountered during drug development urgently call for a serious global rethinking of the way this process is done. A partial solution might be if many consortiums of multi-nations, academic institutions, clinicians, pharma companies, and funding agencies gather at different fronts to crowdsource resources, share knowledge and risks. Such an ecosystem can rapidly generate first-in-class molecules that are safe, effective, and affordable. We think that this article represents a wake-up call for the scientific community to immediately reassess the current drug discovery and development procedures.","Aghila Rani, Koippallil Gopalakrishnan; Hamad, Mohamad A; Zaher, Dana M; Sieburth, Scott McN; Madani, Navid; Al-Tel, Taleb H",Expert Opin Drug Discov,,0

Women shared their thoughts on their feelings on the threat that predominates in biomedical discourse. An air of resignation pervaded their speech. Nearly all of them suffer from chronic diseases and they clearly perceive the risk of their own death. However, the material conditions of their lives limit the scope of their strategies to protect themselves. A dialogue emerged between the women's request for clarity regarding the pandemic and me, a researcher called on as a physician.

432443,Rare case of pancrelipase therapy-induced neutropaenia,2021,"Background: The novel coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) led healthcare providers, including mental health providers, across the U.S. to swiftly shift to telemedicine. Objectives: This shift gave our Department of Psychiatry a chance to better understand key challenges and opportunities vis-à-vis virtual mental healthcare. We aimed to obtain provider feedback on the use of telepsychiatry and to learn from the provider perspective about patient experiences with video visits. This information will be used to inform the telemedicine strategy at a systems level within our psychiatry department, our academic health system, as well as the field of telemedicine as a whole. Design and Sample: A 22-item online questionnaire comprising 16 quantitative and six qualitative items was distributed to providers currently using video visits to provide care. Results: A total of 89 mental health providers completed the questionnaire. Outcomes demonstrated that while providers perceive challenges associated with virtual care (e.g., fatigue, technology-related issues, and age-related concerns), they also recognize a number of benefits to themselves and their patients (e.g., convenience and increased access). Overall, provider satisfaction, comfort, and willingness to use telepsychiatry was high. Conclusions: The vast majority of providers adapted quickly to the use of virtual platforms; many endorse advantages that suggest virtual care will continue to be a modality they provide in the future, post-COVID-19. It will be important to continue to evaluate aspects of virtual care that may limit clinical assessments and to optimize use to improve access, convenience, and cost-efficiency of mental healthcare delivery.","Parikh, Sagar V; Taubman, Danielle S; Grambeau, Mary; Menke, Rena A; Blazek, Mary C; Sullivan, Jennifer; Severe, Jennifer; Patel, Paresh D; Dalack, Gregory W",Psychopharmacol Bull,,0

434127,The Authors Reply,2020,"We are in the midst of the global pandemic. Though acute respiratory coronavirus (SARS-COV2) that leads to COVID-19 infects people of all ages, severe symptoms and mortality occur disproportionately in older adults. Geroscience interventions that target biological aging could decrease risk across multiple age-related diseases and improve outcomes in response to infectious disease. This offers hope for a new host-directed therapeutic approach that could (i) improve outcomes following exposure or shorten treatment regimens; (ii) reduce the chronic pathology associated with the infectious disease and subsequent comorbidity, frailty, and disability; and (iii) promote development of immunological memory that protects against relapse or improves response to vaccination. We review the possibility of this approach by examining available evidence in metformin: a generic drug with a proven safety record that will be used in a large-scale multicenter clinical trial. Though rigorous translational research and clinical trials are needed to test this empirically, metformin may improve host immune defenses and confer protection against long-term health consequences of infectious disease, age-related chronic diseases, and geriatric syndromes.","Justice, Jamie N; Gubbi, Sriram; Kulkarni, Ameya S; Bartley, Jenna M; Kuchel, George A; Barzilai, Nir",Geroscience,,0

444405,Appropriate attitude promotes mask wearing in spite of a significant experience of varying discomfort,2021,"Perchloroethylene (PCE), also known as tetrachloroethylene, is a commercially important chlorinated solvent commonly used in dry cleaning, textile processing, and metal degreasing industries. According to the available studies, the potential genotoxic impacts of this chlorinated solvent on human beings are still controversial. The present work was carried out to determine the genotoxic effects of PCE on human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) using chromosome aberrations (CAs) and cytokinesis-block micronucleus (CBMN) tests. Additionally, the antigenotoxic potential of &#945;-tocopherol (&#945;-Toc), a well-known antioxidant agent, on human lymphocytes treated with PCE in vitro was assessed. The cells were exposed for 48 h to PCE (25, 50, 100, and 150 µg/mL) alone as well as in combination with &#945;-Toc (100 µg/mL). The findings of the study suggested that, relative to solvent control, PCE significantly increased the structural CA and MN formation for all concentrations. However, simultaneous treatment of PCE and &#945;-Toc caused a significant reduction of CAs and MNi as compared to cultures treated with PCE alone. Besides, the results showed that PCE has cytotoxic effects on human PBLs as indicated by the significant decrease in mitotic index (MI) and nuclear division index (NDI). Nevertheless, the co-treatment of &#945;-Toc with PCE did not reduce the cytotoxicity of PCE at a significant level. In conclusion, it can be suggested that PCE is genotoxic and cytotoxic in human PBLs, and &#945;-Toc has an antigenotoxic effect on PCE-induced genotoxicity but has no significant effect on the cytotoxicity triggered by PCE.","Kocaman, Ayse Yavuz; Asfuroglu, Kübra",,,0

447369,My Future in Medicine: How COVID-19 Is Inspiring the Next Generation of Infectious Disease Specialists,2020,"Newly emerging pandemics like COVID-19 call for predictive models to implement precisely tuned responses to limit their deep impact on society. Standard epidemic models provide a theoretically well-founded dynamical description of disease incidence. For COVID-19 with infectiousness peaking before and at symptom onset, the SEIR model explains the hidden build-up of exposed individuals which creates challenges for containment strategies. However, spatial heterogeneity raises questions about the adequacy of modeling epidemic outbreaks on the level of a whole country. Here, we show that by applying sequential data assimilation to the stochastic SEIR epidemic model, we can capture the dynamic behavior of outbreaks on a regional level. Regional modeling, with relatively low numbers of infected and demographic noise, accounts for both spatial heterogeneity and stochasticity. Based on adapted models, short-term predictions can be achieved. Thus, with the help of these sequential data assimilation methods, more realistic epidemic models are within reach.","Engbert, Ralf; Rabe, Maximilian M; Kliegl, Reinhold; Reich, Sebastian",Bull Math Biol,,0

METHODOLOGY: Self-administered questionnaire was sent to SDPs via Google forms. Cohen's stress score scale was used for stress evaluation, and the mean scores were compared based on age, gender, qualification, and occupation. In addition, comparisons of the utilization of stress coping mechanisms and stress busters based on gender, age, and occupation were evaluated. Descriptive statistics were carried out using SPSS (Version 21.0, Chicago, Illinois, USA). RESULTS: A total of 206 SDPs (69% males and 31% females) participated in the study. Male SDPs showed a higher score than females (P>0.05). SDPs around 50 years and above obtained high-stress scores (25±7.4) as compared to other age groups (P<0.05). The occupational level showed higher stress scores (22.6 ± 4.6 than the other occupation groups (P<0.05). The majority of the SDPs used watching TV/mobile/computer (80%) as a stress buster, followed by binge eating (64%), exercise (44%), smoking (32%), do it yourself (DIY-23%), and meditation (17%). CONCLUSION: SDPs are experiencing stress levels during this COVID-19 pandemic time. Male SDPs above 50 years and private practitioners showed higher levels of stress scores. An overall commonly used stress buster was smoking in males and meditation in females.","Aldhuwayhi, Sami; Shaikh, Saquib Ahmed; Mallineni, Sreekanth Kumar; Varadharaju, Vinutha Kumari; Thakare, Amar Ashok; Ahmed Khan, Abdul Rehman; Ziauddin, Mohammed; Manva, Mohnish Z",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,,0

The effect of AKI on the clinical outcomes of these two conditions is unclear. METHODS: This retrospective, territory-wide cohort study used an electronic public healthcare database in Hong Kong to identify patients with SARS or COVID-19 by diagnosis codes, virologic results, or both. The primary endpoint was a composite of intensive care unit admission, use of invasive mechanical ventilation, and/or death. RESULTS: We identified 1670 patients with SARS and 1040 patients with COVID-19 (median ages, 41 versus 35 years, respectively). Among patients with SARS, 26% met the primary endpoint versus 5.3% of those with COVID-19. Diabetes mellitus, abnormal liver function, and AKI were factors significantly associated with the primary endpoint among patients with either SARS or COVID-19. Among patients with SARS, 7.9%, 2.1%, and 3.7% developed stage 1, stage 2, and stage 3 AKI, respectively; among those with COVID-19, 6.6%, 0.4%, and 1.1% developed stage 1, stage 2, and stage 3 AKI, respectively. In both groups, factors significantly associated with AKI included diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Among patients with AKI, those with COVID-19 had a lower rate of major adverse clinical outcomes versus patients with SARS. Renal function recovery usually occurred within 30 days after an initial AKI event. CONCLUSIONS: AKI rates were higher among patients with SARS than those with COVID-19. AKI was associated with major adverse clinical outcomes for both diseases. Patients with diabetes mellitus and abnormal liver function were also at risk of developing severe consequences after SARS and COVID-19 infection.","Teoh, Jeremy Yuen-Chun; Yip, Terry Cheuk-Fung; Lui, Grace Chung-Yan; Wong, Vincent Wai-Sun; Chow, Viola Chi-Ying; Ho, Tracy Hang-Yee; Li, Timothy Chun-Man; Tse, Yee-Kit; Chiu, Peter Ka-Fung; Ng, Chi-Fai; Hui, David Shu-Cheong; Chan, Henry Lik-Yuen; Szeto, Cheuk-Chun; Wong, Grace Lai-Hung",J.

458653,Cause-specific death in hospitalized individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2: more than just acute respiratory failure or thromboembolic events,2020,"BACKGROUND: Overcoming the COVID-19 crisis requires new ideas and strategies for online communication of personal medical information and patient empowerment. Rapid testing of a large number of subjects is essential to monitor, and delay, the spread of SARS-CoV-2 to mitigate the pandemic's consequences. People not knowing that they are infected may not stay in quarantine and, thus, risk infecting others. Unfortunately, the massive number of COVID-19 tests performed is challenging for both laboratories and the units that take the throat swab and communicate the results. OBJECTIVE: Reducing the communication burden for healthcare professionals. We developed a secure and easy-to-use tracking system to report COVID-19 test results online which is simple to understand for the tested subjects as soon as these results become available. Instead of personal calls, the system updates the status and the results of the tests automatically. This aims to reduce the delay when informing testees about their results and, consequently, to slow down the virus spread. METHODS: The application draws on an existing tracking tool. With this open-source and browser-based online tracking system, we aim to minimize the time required to inform the tested person and the test units, e.g. hospitals or the public healthcare system. The system can be integrated into the clinical workflow with very modest effort and avoids excessive load to telephone hotlines. RESULTS: The test status and results are published on a secured web-page enabling regular status checks by patients not using smartphones, which has some importance as smartphone usage diminishes with age. Stress tests and statistics show the performance of our software. CTest is currently running at two University Hospitals (Ulm, Tübingen; Germany) with thousands of tests each week. Results show a mean number of 10 views per testee. CONCLUSIONS: CTest runs independent of existing infrastructures, aims at straight-forward integration, and safe transmission of information. The system is easy-to-use for testees. QR Code links allow for quick accession to the test results. The mean number of views per entry indicates the reduced amount of time for both, healthcare professionals and testees. The system is quite generic and can be extended and adapted to other communication tasks.","Völkel, Gunnar; Fürstberger, Axel; Schwab, Julian D; Werle, Silke D; Ikonomi, Nansi; Gscheidmeier, Thomas; Kraus, Johann M; Groß, Alexander; Holderried, Martin; Balig, Julien; Jobst, Franz; Kuhn, Peter; Kuhn, Klaus A; Kohlbacher, Oliver; Kaisers, Udo X; Seufferlein, Thomas; Kestler, Hans A",J. med. internet res,,0

462503,Elastomeric respirators for all healthcare workers,2021,"The majority of infections with SARS-CoV-2 are asymptomatic or mild without the necessity of hospitalization. It is of importance to reveal if these patients develop an antibody response against SARS-CoV-2 and to define which antibodies confer virus neutralization. We conducted a comprehensive serological survey of 49 patients with a mild course of disease and quantified neutralizing antibody responses against a clinical SARS-CoV-2 isolate employing human cells as targets. Four patients (8%), even though symptomatic, did not develop antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, and two other patients (4%) were positive in only one of the six serological assays employed. For the remaining 88%, antibody response against the S protein correlated with serum neutralization whereas antibodies against the nucleocapsid were poor predictors of virus neutralization. None of the sera enhanced infection of human cells with SARS-CoV-2 at any dilution, arguing against antibody-dependent enhancement of infection in our system. Regarding neutralization, only six patients (12%) could be classified as high neutralizers. Furthermore, sera from several individuals with fairly high antibody levels had only poor neutralizing activity. In addition, employing a novel serological Western blot system to characterize antibody responses against seasonal coronaviruses, we found that antibodies against the seasonal coronavirus 229E might contribute to SARS-CoV-2 neutralization. Altogether, we show that there is a wide breadth of antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 in patients that differentially correlate with virus neutralization. This highlights the difficulty to define reliable surrogate markers for immunity against SARS-CoV-2.IMPORTANCE There is strong interest in the nature of the neutralizing antibody response against SARS-CoV-2 in infected individuals. For vaccine development, it is especially important which antibodies confer protection against SARS-CoV-2, if there is a phenomenon called antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection, and if there is cross-protection by antibodies directed against seasonal coronaviruses. We addressed these questions and found in accordance with other studies that neutralization is mediated mainly by antibodies directed against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 in general and the receptor binding site in particular. In our test system, utilizing human cells for infection experiments, we did not detect ADE. However, using a novel diagnostic test we found that antibodies against the coronavirus 229E might be involved in cross-protection to SARS-CoV-2.","Ruetalo, Natalia; Businger, Ramona; Althaus, Karina; Fink, Simon; Ruoff, Felix; Pogoda, Michaela; Iftner, Angelika; Ganzenmüller, Tina; Hamprecht, Klaus; Flehmig, Bertram; Bakchoul, Tamam; Templin, Markus F; Schindler, Michael",MSphere,,0

Using data from a national, multicentre, prospective cohort, we aimed to characterise people with COVID-19 admitted to hospital with underlying respiratory disease, assess the level of care received, measure in-hospital mortality, and examine the effect of inhaled corticosteroid use. METHODS: We analysed data from the International Severe Acute Respiratory and emerging Infection Consortium (ISARIC) WHO Clinical Characterisation Protocol UK (CCP-UK) study. All patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 across England, Scotland, and Wales between Jan 17 and Aug 3, 2020, were eligible for inclusion in this analysis. Patients with asthma, chronic pulmonary disease, or both, were identified and stratified by age (<16 years, 16-49 years, and &#8805;50 years). In-hospital mortality was measured by use of multilevel Cox proportional hazards, adjusting for demographics, comorbidities, and medications (inhaled corticosteroids, short-acting ß-agonists [SABAs], and long-acting ß-agonists [LABAs]). Patients with asthma who were taking an inhaled corticosteroid plus LABA plus another maintenance asthma medication were considered to have severe asthma. FINDINGS: 75 463 patients from 258 participating health-care facilities were included in this analysis: 860 patients younger than 16 years (74 [8·6%] with asthma), 8950 patients aged 16-49 years (1867 [20·9%] with asthma), and 65 653 patients aged 50 years and older (5918 [9·0%] with asthma, 10 266 [15·6%] with chronic pulmonary disease, and 2071 [3·2%] with both asthma and chronic pulmonary disease). Patients with asthma were significantly more likely than those without asthma to receive critical care (patients aged 16-49 years: adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1·20 [95% CI 1·05-1·37]; p=0·0080; patients aged &#8805;50 years: adjusted OR 1·17 [1·08-1·27]; p<0·0001), and patients aged 50 years and older with chronic pulmonary disease (with or without asthma) were significantly less likely than those without a respiratory condition to receive critical care (adjusted OR 0·66 [0·60-0·72] for those without asthma and 0·74 [0·62-0·87] for those with asthma; p<0·0001 for both). In patients aged 16-49 years, only those with severe asthma had a significant increase in mortality compared to those with no asthma (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1·17 [95% CI 0·73-1·86] for those on no asthma therapy, 0·99 [0·61-1·58] for those on SABAs only, 0·94 [0·62-1·43] for those on inhaled corticosteroids only, 1·02 [0·67-1·54] for those on inhaled corticosteroids plus LABAs, and 1·96 [1·25-3·08] for those with severe asthma). Among patients aged 50 years and older, those with chronic pulmonary disease had a significantly increased mortality risk, regardless of inhaled corticosteroid use, compared to patients without an underlying respiratory condition (adjusted HR 1·16 [95% CI 1·12-1·22] for those not on inhaled corticosteroids, and 1·10 [1·04-1·16] for those on inhaled corticosteroids; p<0·0001). Patients aged 50 years and older with severe asthma also had an increased mortality risk compared to those not on asthma therapy (adjusted HR 1·24 [95% CI 1·04-1·49]). In patients aged 50 years and older, inhaled corticosteroid use within 2 weeks of hospital admission was associated with decreased mortality in those with asthma, compared to those without an underlying respiratory condition (adjusted HR 0·86 [95% CI 0·80-0·92]). INTERPRETATION: Underlying respiratory conditions are common in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19. Regardless of the severity of symptoms at admission and comorbidities, patients with asthma were more likely, and those with chronic pulmonary disease less likely, to receive critical care than patients without an underlying respiratory condition. In patients aged 16 years and older, severe asthma was associated with increased mortality compared to non-severe asthma. In patients aged 50 years and older, inhaled corticosteroid use in those with asthma was associated with lower mortality than in patients without an underlying respiratory condition; patients with chronic pulmonary disease had significantly increased mortality compared to those with no underlying respiratory condition, regardless of inhaled corticosteroid use. Our results suggest that the use of inhaled corticosteroids, within 2 weeks of admission, improves survival for patients aged 50 years and older with asthma, but not for those with chronic pulmonary disease.

474517,Abnormal presentation of haemorrhagic adrenal cyst,2021,"BACKGROUND: Whether vitamin D supplementation has any effect on body fat percentage, especially among elite athletes, remains unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of vitamin D supplementation on serum vitamin D level in elite male collegiate athletes and to analyze its effect on body fat percentage. METHODS: We enrolled a total of 42 elite male collegiate athletes in this prospective cohort study. In March 2020, body composition monitoring and blood test were performed. All athletes were provided with vitamin D3 supplement tablets of 25 µg/day. The use of the supplement was dependent on athletes' preference. During the study period, their club activities were stopped for 2 months due to the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak. A second examination, similar to the first one, was performed after approximately 3 months. Supplement usage by each athlete was also confirmed. The participants were divided into a non-supplement group (without supplementation, n = 15) and a supplement group (with supplementation, n = 27). RESULTS: Regarding baseline data at initial examination, the non-supplement and supplement groups showed significant differences in the mean body fat percentage (9.0% and 12.1%, respectively; P = 0.03) and serum 25(OH)D level (22.7 and 18.5 ng/mL, respectively, P = 0.02). At the time of the second examination, there were no significant differences in the results of both the groups. In terms of mean change value from the first to the second examination, there were significant differences in body fat percentage (1.9 and 0.2%, respectively, P = 0.02) and serum 25(OH)D level (1.7 and 7.2 ng/mL, respectively, P < 0.001) between the two groups. A significant negative correlation was observed between the change ratio of body fat percentage and change value of serum 25(OH)D level (r = - 0.37, P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D supplementation of 25 µg/day significantly increased the serum 25(OH)D level in elite male collegiate athletes. Vitamin D supplementation may play a role in maintaining athletes' body fat percentage under circumstances where sports activity has decreased.","Kawashima, Itaru; Tsukahara, Takashi; Kawai, Ryosuke; Mizuno, Takafumi; Ishizuka, Shinya; Hiraiwa, Hideki; Imagama, Shiro",Nutr Metab (Lond),,0

Guidelines following discharge from acute inpatient rehabilitation have not yet been established. This study seeks to establish outcomes of rehabilitation patients with COVID-19 and characterize their need for long-term care. OBJECTIVE: To determine the functional outcomes and utilization of follow-up medical care for patients with COVID-19 90 days following discharge from acute inpatient rehabilitation, as compared to rehabilitation impairment and age-matched controls. DESIGN: Prospective, single-center cohort study. SETTING: Inpatient rehabilitation facility (IRF). PATIENTS: Sixty-four patients recovering from COVID-19 and 64 age and impairment group category controls were identified to answer survey questions following discharge from inpatient rehabilitation. A total of 36 patients participated in the study (18 patients with COVID-19 and 18 controls). INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Functional outcomes at discharge (GG Self-Care and Mobility Activities items of the IRF-PAI Version 3.0), hospital readmissions, and follow-up care sought by patients. RESULTS: The COVID-19 patient group had similar improvements in functional outcomes as compared to controls. Patients with COVID-19 required fewer 0-90 day readmissions than their matched controls (22.2% vs 61.1%, P < .05), but there were no differences in 0-90 day urgent care/emergency department visits, clinic visits and use of outpatient therapies. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with functional deficits as a result of COVID-19 who require multiple therapy disciplines should be considered for acute inpatient rehabilitation as this study demonstrates their ability to participate in and benefit from IRF level care.","Jain, Esha; Harmon, Erin Y; Sonagere, Matthew B",PM R,,0

Ground NO2 mapping with high spatiotemporal resolution is critical for fine-scale air pollution and environmental health research. We thus developed a spatiotemporal regression kriging model to map daily high-resolution (3-km) ground NO2 concentrations in China using the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) satellite retrievals and geographical covariates. This model combined geographically and temporally weighted regression with spatiotemporal kriging and achieved robust prediction performance with sample-based and site-based cross-validation R2 values of 0.84 and 0.79. The annual mean and standard deviation of ground NO2 concentrations from June 1, 2018 to May 31, 2019 were predicted to be 15.05 ± 7.82 µg/m3, with that in 0.6% of China's area (10% of the population) exceeding the annual air quality standard (40 µg/m3). The ground NO2 concentrations during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) period (January and February in 2020) was 14% lower than that during the same period in 2019 and the mean population exposure to ground NO2 was reduced by 25%. This study was the first to use TROPOMI retrievals to map fine-scale daily ground NO2 concentrations across all of China. This was also an early application to use the satellite-estimated ground NO2 data to quantify the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the air pollution and population exposures. These newly satellite-derived ground NO2 data with high spatiotemporal resolution have value in advancing environmental and health research in China.","Wu, Sensen; Huang, Bo; Wang, Jionghua; He, Lijie; Wang, Zhongyi; Yan, Zhen; Lao, Xiangqian; Zhang, Feng; Liu, Renyi; Du, Zhenhong",Environ Pollut,,0

483275,"Community Responses during Early Phase of COVID-19 Epidemic, Hong Kong",2020,"COVID-19 pandemic outbreak is the most astounding scene ever experienced in the 21st century. It has been determined to be caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). With the global pandemic, the lack of efficient rapid and accurate molecular diagnostic testing tools has hindered the public opportunely response to the emerging viral threat. Herein, a DNA nanoscaffold hybrid chain reaction (DNHCR)-based nucleic acid assay strategy is reported for rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. In this method, the DNA nanoscaffolds have been first constructed by the self-assembly of long DNA strands and self-quenching probes (H1). Then, the SARS-CoV-2 RNA will initiate the hybridization of H1 and free H2 DNA probes along the nanoscaffold, and an illuminated DNA nanostring is instantly obtained. By taking advantages of the localization design of the H1 probes and the temperature tolerance of the isothermal amplification, the proposed DNHCR method can detect target at short responding time (within 10 min) and mild condition (15 °C-35 °C). Moreover, the reliability of DNHCR method in serum and saliva samples have also been validated. Therefore, DNHCR-based method is expected to provide a simple and faster alternative to the traditional SARS-CoV-2 qRT-PCR assay.","Jiao, Jin; Duan, Chengjie; Xue, Lan; Liu, Yunfei; Sun, Weihao; Xiang, Yang",Biosens Bioelectron,,0

486179,Tracheal swab from front of neck airway for SARS-CoV-2; a bronchial foreign body,2020,"The public health policies and sanitary measures taken by governments in various countries to stem the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic (e.g. lockdown, social distancing) have major implications for athletes. The radical changes are challenging and risk causing significant career disruption to athletes, with subsequent negative psychological effects. Thus, the ways athletes cope with such adversity is of critical importance. The present study aimed to identify athletes' coping profiles using a person-centred approach, based on their reported use of multiple coping strategies in response to the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak, and to compare levels of anxiety, stress appraisals, interpersonal coping strategies, and availability and appreciation of the major sources of support across profiles. A total of 526 French athletes competing at national to elite levels answered an online questionnaire during the lockdown. Latent profile analysis results yielded four distinct coping profiles (i.e. self-reliant, engaged, avoidant, active and social). The MANOVA showed that athletes belonging to the four profiles differed on anxiety, stress appraisals, social support, and interpersonal coping. In particular, avoidant copers reported high levels of anxiety, threat, and uncontrollability, and appeared less able to regulate responses to the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak. Using a person-centred approach, the findings could inform the development of more adequate care, support, and intervention for athletes, especially avoidant copers, who were characterized by the least effective coping skills and resources. Accordingly, stress reappraisal and stress mindset interventions could be promising approaches to effectively manage pandemic-related impact during and after the COVID-19 crisis. Highlights The COVID-19 outbreak has major implications for athletes and is causing significant disruption to their careers. Using a person-centred approach, four coping profiles emerge showing athletes' preferred use of several coping strategies in response. The four coping profiles (i.e. self-reliant, engaged, avoidant, active and social) differentiate distinct groups of athletes in relation to anxiety, stress appraisals, social support, and interpersonal coping. Avoidant copers were characterized by the least effective coping skills and social context of coping. Management of the COVID-19 situation may be more problematic for them than other in mitigating its negative psychological effects. Using a person-centred approach, the findings could inform the development of more adequate care, support, and intervention for athletes, especially avoidant copers, who were characterized by the least effective coping skills and resources.","Pété, Emilie; Leprince, Chloé; Lienhart, Noémie; Doron, Julie",Eur J Sport Sci,,0
487383,The effect of the Australian bushfires and the COVID-19 pandemic on health behaviours in people with multiple sclerosis,2021,"BACKGROUND: The novel acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic imposed a national lockdown at the beginning of 2020. People faced social distancing, being forced to stay at home. Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) typically influences life habits and psycho-social relationship. It is now questionable how PAD can be affected by changes in lifestyle imposed by the Sars-CoV-19 Pandemic. This study's main objective is to evaluate how the limitations of social behavior set by Sars-CoV-19 Pandemic impact the perception and evolution of the disease in a group of patients with a diagnosed PAD. METHODS: The changes in the in the perception and the evolution of the PAD were evaluated by comparing results of a modified VascuQol-6 quality of life (QoL) survey referring to the time frame defined ""No-Sars-CoV-2 period"" (from July to December 2019) with results referring to the time frame defined ""Sars-CoV-2 period"" (from January to June 2020). An overall score (range 4-60) was calculated, and a comparison between the two period studies was reported. Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) Curves evaluated a delta value for each patient with revascularization of lower limb peripheral arteries. Optimal cut-offs were chosen based on their specificity, sensitivity. RESULTS: One-hundred-two PAD patients gave their informed consent to take part in the study. A significant general worsening of patients PAD perception in the Sars-CoV-2 period was recorded for the following items: lower limbs health status perception; overall activity limitation; walking ability limitation; overall daily walking distance; lower limbs fatigue perception; concerns about PAD worsening; pain discomfort (P < 0.05). The pain intensity changed from 4.7 ± 2.9 in the No-Sars-CoV-2 period to 6.3 ± 2.9 in the Sars-CoV-2 period significantly (P < 0.0001), even though analgesic drug intake did not increase considerably in Sars-CoV-2 period (Pâ¯=â¯0.15). The overall score was 20.3 ± 7.4 for the No-Sars-CoV-2 period and 27.4 ± 7.6 in the Sars-CoV-2 period (Pâ¯=â¯0.0001). The ROC curve built to analyze the relation between Delta-score and the need for revascularization identifies a cut-off > 8.5 (Area Under the Curve 0.5436; CI 95% 0.4252 to 0.6620) with a sensitivity and specificity respectively of 52.6% (CI 95% 37.26-67.52%) and 65.6% (CI 95% 53.40-76.08%). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with PAD were significantly hit by all the restrictions and the social limitations imposed to reduce the Sars-CoV-19 virus diffusion. Our study confirms that the perception and the evolution of PAD were significantly affected during the ""Sars-CoV-2 period"".","de Donato, Gianmarco; Pasqui, Edoardo; Alba, Giuseppe; Abu Leil, Mustafa; Palasciano, Giancarlo",Ann Vasc Surg,,0

Starchy products were screened and classified as being either high (high-SDS) or low (low-SDS) in SDS (in vitro SDS method). A randomized controlled cross-over pilot study was performed: Eight patients with T2D consumed randomly a high-SDS or a low-SDS diet for one week each, while their glycemic profile was monitored for 6 days. Based on 250 food product SDS analyses and dietary recommendations for patients with T2D, the high-SDS and low-SDS diets were designed. The high-SDS diet significantly increased SDS intake and the SDS/carbohydrates proportion compared to the low-SDS diet (61.6 vs. 11.6 g/day and 30% vs. 6%; p < 0.0001, respectively).

488418,"Trends in Viral Respiratory Infections During COVID-19 Pandemic, South Korea",2021,"As of the end of 2020, the State of Israel, with a population of 9.3 million, had administered more COVID-19 vaccine doses than all countries aside from China, the US, and the UK. Moreover, Israel had administered almost 11.0 doses per 100 population, while the next highest rates were 3.5 (in Bahrain) and 1.4 (in the United Kingdom). All other countries had administered less than 1 dose per 100 population.While Israel's rollout of COVID-19 vaccinations was not problem-free, its initial phase had clearly been rapid and effective. A large number of factors contributed to this early success, and they can be divided into three major groups.The first group of factors consists of long-standing characteristics of Israel which are extrinsic to health care. They include: Israel's small size (in terms of both area and population), a relatively young population, relatively warm weather in December 2020, a centralized national system of government, and well-developed infrastructure for implementing prompt responses to large-scale national emergencies.The second group of factors are also long-standing, but they are health-system specific. They include: the organizational, IT and logistical capacities of Israel's community-based health care providers, the availability of a cadre of well-trained, salaried, community-based nurses who are directly employed by those providers, a tradition of effective cooperation between government, health plans, hospitals, and emergency care providers - particularly during national emergencies; and support tools and decisionmaking frameworks to support vaccination campaigns.The third group consists of factors that are more recent and are specific to the COVID-19 vaccination effort. They include: the mobilization of special government funding for vaccine purchase and distribution, timely contracting for a large amount of vaccines relative to Israel's population, the use of simple, clear and easily implementable criteria for determining who had priority for receiving vaccines in the early phases of the distribution process, a creative technical response that addressed the demanding cold storage requirements of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, and well-tailored outreach efforts to encourage Israelis to sign up for vaccinations and then show up to get vaccinated.While many of these facilitating factors are not unique to Israel, part of what made the Israeli rollout successful was its combination of facilitating factors (as opposed to each factor being unique separately) and the synergies it created among them. Moreover, some high-income countries (including the US, the UK, and Canada) are lacking several of these facilitating factors, apparently contributing to the slower pace of the rollout in those countries.","Rosen, Bruce; Waitzberg, Ruth; Israeli, Avi",Isr J Health Policy Res,,0

Care has been transformed by the crisis, but enduring lessons have been learned. In this article, we review how COVID-19 will impact cirrhosis care. We describe how this impact unfolds over 3 waves; i) an intense period with prioritized high-acuity care with delayed elective procedures and routine care during physical distancing, ii) a challenging 'return to normal' following the end of physical distancing, with increased emergent decompensations, morbidity, and systems of care overwhelmed by the backlog of deferred care, and iii) a protracted period of suboptimal outcomes characterized by missed diagnoses, progressive disease and loss to follow-up. We outline the concrete steps required to preserve the quality of care provided to patients with cirrhosis. This includes an intensification of the preventative care provided to patients with compensated cirrhosis, proactive chronic disease management, robust telehealth programs, and a reorganization of care delivery to provide a full service of care with flexible clinical staffing. Managing the pandemic of a serious chronic disease in the midst of a global infectious pandemic is challenging.

SARS-CoV-2 viral infection has become a global chaos, affecting millions of people. There is an urgent need to contain the pandemic and develop reliable therapies. We report the use of a humanized zebrafish model, xeno-transplanted with human lung epithelial cells, A549, for studying the protective effects of a tri-herbal medicine Coronil. At human relevant doses of 12 and 58 µg/kg, Coronil inhibited SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, induced humanized zebrafish mortality, and rescued from behavioral fever. Morphological and cellular abnormalities along with granulocyte and macrophage accumulation in the swim bladder were restored to normal. Skin hemorrhage, renal cell degeneration, and necrosis were also significantly attenuated by Coronil treatment. Ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) analysis identified ursolic acid, betulinic acid, withanone, withaferine A, withanoside IV-V, cordifolioside A, magnoflorine, rosmarinic acid, and palmatine as phyto-metabolites present in Coronil. In A549 cells, Coronil attenuated the IL-1ß induced IL-6 and TNF-&#945; cytokine secretions, and decreased TNF-&#945; induced NF-&#954;B/AP-1 transcriptional activity. Taken together, we show the disease modifying immunomodulatory properties of Coronil, at human equivalent doses, in rescuing the pathological features induced by the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, suggesting its potential use in SARS-CoV-2 infectivity.","Balkrishna, Acharya; Solleti, Siva Kumar; Verma, Sudeep; Varshney, Anurag",Molecules (Basel),,0

500867,Compartment syndrome: a rare complication following laparoscopic colorectal surgery,2021,"BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is an urgent public health crisis, with epidemiologic models predicting severe consequences, including high death rates, if the virus is permitted to run its course without any intervention or response. Contact tracing using smartphone technology is a powerful tool that may be employed to limit disease transmission during an epidemic or pandemic; yet, contact tracing apps present significant privacy concerns regarding the collection of personal data such as location. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to develop an effective contact tracing smartphone app that respects user privacy by not collecting location information or other personal data. METHODS: We propose the use of an anonymized graph of interpersonal interactions to conduct a novel form of contact tracing and have developed a proof-of-concept smartphone app that implements this approach. Additionally, we developed a computer simulation model that demonstrates the impact of our proposal on epidemic or pandemic outbreak trajectories across multiple rates of adoption. RESULTS: Our proof-of-concept smartphone app allows users to create ""checkpoints"" for contact tracing, check their risk level based on their past interactions, and anonymously self-report a positive status to their peer network. Our simulation results suggest that higher adoption rates of such an app may result in a better controlled epidemic or pandemic outbreak. CONCLUSIONS: Our proposed smartphone-based contact tracing method presents a novel solution that preserves privacy while demonstrating the potential to suppress an epidemic or pandemic outbreak. This app could potentially be applied to the current COVID-19 pandemic as well as other epidemics or pandemics in the future to achieve a middle ground between drastic isolation measures and unmitigated disease spread.","Yasaka, Tyler M; Lehrich, Brandon M; Sahyouni, Ronald",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,,0

Considerable scientific progress was recorded regarding SARS-CoV-2 infection in terms of genomic structure, diagnostic tools, viral transmission, mechanism of viral infection, symptomatology, clinical impact, and complications, but these data evolve constantly. Up to date, neither an effective vaccine nor SARS-CoV-2 specific antiviral agents have been approved, but significant advances were enlisted in this direction by investigating repurposed approved drugs (ongoing clinical trials) or developing innovative antiviral drugs (preclinical and clinical studies). This review presents a thorough analysis of repurposed drug admitted for compassionate use from a chemical structure—biological activity perspective highlighting the ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) properties and the toxicophore groups linked to potential adverse effects. A detailed pharmacological description of the novel potential anti-COVID-19 therapeutics was also included.

504160,Acute lung toxicity by nitrofurantoin,2021,"INTRODUCTION: The coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) pandemic is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Pre-existing cardiovascular disease (CVD) increases the morbidity and mortality of COVID-19, and COVID-19 itself causes serious cardiac sequelae. Strategies to minimise the risk of viral transmission to health care workers and uninfected cardiac patients while prioritising high quality cardiac care are urgently needed. We conducted a rapid literature appraisal and review of key documents identified by the Cardiac Society of Australia and New Zealand Board and Council members, the Australian and New Zealand Society of Cardiac and Thoracic Surgeons, and key cardiology, surgical and public health opinion leaders. MAIN RECOMMENDATIONS: Common acute cardiac manifestations of COVID-19 include left ventricular dysfunction, heart failure, arrhythmias and acute coronary syndromes. The presence of underlying CVD confers a five- to tenfold higher case fatality rate with COVID-19 disease. Special precautions are needed to avoid viral transmission to this population at risk. Adaptive health care delivery models and resource allocation are required throughout the health care system to address this need. CHANGES IN MANAGEMENT AS A RESULT OF THIS STATEMENT: Cardiovascular health services and cardiovascular health care providers need to recognise the increased risk of COVID-19 among CVD patients, upskill in the management of COVID-19 cardiac manifestations, and reorganise and innovate in service delivery models to meet demands. This consensus statement, endorsed by the Cardiac Society of Australia and New Zealand, the Australian and New Zealand Society of Cardiac and Thoracic Surgeons, the National Heart Foundation of Australia and the High Blood Pressure Research Council of Australia summarises important issues and proposes practical approaches to cardiovascular health care delivery to patients with and without SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Zaman, Sarah; MacIsaac, Andrew I; Jennings, Garry Lr; Schlaich, Markus P; Inglis, Sally C; Arnold, Ruth; Kumar, Saurabh; Thomas, Liza; Wahi, Sudhir; Lo, Sidney; Naismith, Carolyn; Duffy, Stephen J; Nicholls, Stephen J; Newcomb, Andrew; Almeida, Aubrey A; Wong, Selwyn; Lund, Mayanna; Chew, Derek P; Kritharides, Leonard; Chow, Clara K; Bhindi, Ravinay",Med. j.

504925,A dynamic modeling tool for estimating healthcare demand from the COVID19 epidemic and evaluating population-wide interventions,2020,"Colorectal cancer(CRC) is one of the most prevalent malignancies in the Asia-Pacific region, and many countries in this region have launched population CRC service screening. In this study, CRC screening key indicators, including the FIT(fecal immunochemical test) screening rate (or participation rate) and the rate of undergoing colonoscopy after positive FIT in 2019 and 2020, were surveyed in individual countries in the Asia-Pacific region. The impact of the pandemic on the effectiveness of CRC screening was simulated given different screening rates and colonoscopy rates and assuming the pandemic would persist or remain poorly controlled for a long period of time, using the empirical data from the Taiwanese program and the CRC natural history model. During the COVID-19 pandemic, most of the programs in this region were affected, but to different extents, which was largely influenced by the severity of the local pandemic. Most of the programs continued screening services in 2020, although a temporary pause occurred in some countries. The modeling study revealed that prolonged pauses of screening led to 6% lower effectiveness in reducing CRC mortality. Screening organizers should coordinate with health authorities to elaborate on addressing screening backlogs, setting priorities for screening, and applying modern technologies to overcome potential obstacles. Many novel approaches that were developed and applied during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as the risk-stratified approach that takes into account personal CRC risk and the local epidemic status, as well as new digital technologies, are expected to play important roles in CRC screening in the future.","Chiu, Han-Mo; Su, Chiu-Wen; Hsu, Weng-Feng; Jen, Grace Hsiao-Hsuan; Hsu, Chen-Yang; Chen, Sam Li-Shen; Chen, Hsiu-Hsi",Prev Med,,0

509386,Angiotensin-converting Enzyme Inhibitor/Angiotensin Receptor Blocker Use and COVID-19: Time to Change Practice or Keep Gathering Data?,2020,"Dengue, a mosquito-borne disease, has appeared as a major infectious disease globally. The virus requires its proteins to replicate and reproduce in the host cell. The NS3 protease converts the polyprotein to functional proteins with the help of the NS2B cofactor. Thus, NS3 protease is a promising target to develop antiviral inhibitors against the dengue virus. A systematic screening including ADMET properties, molecular docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, binding free energy calculation, and QSAR studies is carried out to predict potent inhibitors against the NS3 protease. From the screening of 40 antiviral phytochemicals, ADMET properties analysis was used to screen out ligands that violate ADME rules and have probable toxicity. Cyanidin 3-Glucoside, Dithymoquinone, and Glabridin were predicted to be potent inhibitors against the NS3 protease according to their binding affinity. These ligands showed several noncovalent interactions, including hydrogen bond, hydrophobic interaction, electrostatic interaction, pi-sulfur interactions. The ligand-protein complexes were further scrutinized using 250 ns molecular dynamics simulation. The MM-PBSA binding free energy calculation was conducted to investigate their binding stability in dynamic conditions. The calculated pIC50(mM) value was predicted using the QSAR model with 89.91% goodness of fit. The predicted biologocal activity value for the ligands indicates they might have good potency.","Rahman, Md Mahbubur; Biswas, Sourav; Islam, Kazi Jahidul; Paul, Archi Sundar; Mahato, Shiplob Kumar; Ali, Md Ackas; Halim, Mohammad A",Comput Biol Med,,0

Household chaos may act upon maternal behaviors of physical activity and sleep, potentially via higher stress. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the relationships among household chaos, maternal stress, and maternal physical activity and sleep, and identify barriers to home organization during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: A cross-sectional study using an online survey of 1721 mothers of preschoolers (ages = 3.0-5.9 years) in the United States was conducted in May 2020 during COVID-19 stay-at-home orders and early reopening. Mothers reported demographic characteristics, household chaos, stress, physical activity and sleep, and barriers to home organization during the outbreak. Mediation models were conducted among household chaos, stress, and physical activity and sleep with adjustment for covariates. RESULTS: About half of mothers were middle income (48.2%), employed full-time prior to the outbreak (59.1%), and met the physical activity (47.7%), and sleep guideline (49.7%, 7-9 h/day). Household chaos and stress were both negatively related to physical activity and sleep. For every 1 unit increase in mother's current stress, mothers were 11% (95% confidence interval = 6% to 16%) less likely to meet the physical activity guideline and 19% (95% confidence interval = 14% to 23%) less likely to meet the sleep guideline. Household chaos was positively related to stress. Stress partially mediated the relationship between household chaos and physical activity and sleep. Virus concerns, occupational changes (i.e. teleworking), and lack of childcare were barriers to home organization. CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 outbreak, many mothers had poor sleep and physical activity, which was associated with household chaos and stress.

Independent, well-powered studies could further our understanding of this association. Objective: To examine whether low levels of vitamin D are associated with SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity, an indicator of previous infection. Design, Setting, and Participants: This is a cohort study of employees and spouses who elected to be tested for SARS-CoV-2 IgG as part of an annual employer-sponsored health screening program conducted in August to November 2020. This program includes commonly assessed demographic, biometric, and laboratory variables, including total vitamin D measurement. Baseline (prepandemic) levels of vitamin D and potential confounders were obtained from screening results from the previous year (September 2019 to January 2020). Data analysis was performed from December 2020 to March 2021. Exposures: Low total serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D, defined as either less than 20 ng/mL or less than 30 ng/mL. Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcome was SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity, as determined with US Food and Drug Administration emergency use-authorized assays. The association of SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity with vitamin D levels was assessed by multivariable logistic regression analyses and propensity score analyses. Results: The 18â¯148 individuals included in this study had test results for SARS-CoV-2 IgG in 2020 and vitamin D levels from the prepandemic and pandemic periods.

Healthcare workers are at high risk of acquiring COVID-19 from occupational exposure to COVID-19 virus during their daily medical service work Excellent infection prevention and control measures and adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) are essential to reduce the risk of hospital-acquired COVID-19 What is added by this report? On March 17, 2021, a female healthcare professional who already received both doses of the COVID-19 vaccination and was working in the isolation area of a designated COVID-19 hospital was diagnosed with COVID-19 in Xi’an city Her exposure likely occurred five days before illness onset when she obtained nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs from the two imported cases that were identified as belonging to the B 1 1 7 lineage, the variant first detected in the United Kingdom What are the implications for public health practices? Since the healthcare worker had been fully vaccinated and had mild symptomatology, it is considered a mild breakthrough infection All vaccines are associated with breakthrough infections In addition to rigorous adherence to infection prevention and control measures, use of adequate PPE, and using good clinical practices, the potential role of chronic upper respiratory infection in acquiring COVID-19 during medical procedures deserves further consideration","Chaofeng, Ma Songtao Xu Yecheng Yao Pengbo Yu You Xu Rui Wu Hailong Chen Xiaoping Dong",China CDC Weekly,,0

518458,The Indirect Implication of SARS-CoV-2 Resulting in Kayexalate Toxicity in a Patient with Acute Kidney Injury,2021,"INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: This article reports the results of the 2020 Spanish Catheter Ablation Registry, a year marked by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. METHODS: Data were collected retrospectively through completion and return of a specific form by the participating centers. RESULTS: Data from 97 centers (67 public, 30 private) were analyzed. A total of 15 169 ablation procedures were reported with a mean of 155 ± 117 and a median [interquartile range] of 115 [62-227]. Because of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, both procedures and participating centers markedly decreased (-3380 procedures, -18%) and there were 5 centers less than in 2019. The most common procedure continued to be atrial fibrillation ablation (4513; 30%), well ahead of the remaining substrates, followed by ablation of the cavotricuspid isthmus (3188; 21%), and intranodal re-entry tachycardia (2808; 18%). Ablation of these 3 substrates continued to form the bulk of the procedures. The total success rate was slightly lower than in previous years (88%) with a similar complication rate (n = 309; 2%) and mortality (n = 7; 0.04%). A total of 243 procedures were performed in pediatric patients (1.6%). CONCLUSIONS: The Spanish Catheter Ablation Registry systematically and continuously reflects the national trajectory, which, in 2020, was markedly affected by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Although slightly lower than in previous years, the success rate remained high, with a low complication rate.","León, Rocío Cózar; Camós, Ignasi Anguera; Pérez, Óscar Cano",Rev. esp. cardiol.

All cases occurred from April to December, and the epidemic peaked from May to August. The ages of patients ranged from 10 to 86 years (median = 55 years), and the incidence of SFTS increased with age. The female:male ratio of cases was 1.008:1, and 54.6% (77/141) and 1.4% (2/141) of the cases were confirmed by qPCR to be SFTSV and Hantavirus (HV) infection, respectively. No case of simultaneous infection with two or more pathogens was found. The research in this paper showed that some suspected SFTS cases are confused with HV infection due to similar symptoms. The analysis showed that the distribution of SFTSV has a marked regional aggregation in Hubei province.","Zhan, Jianbo; Cheng, Jing; Hu, Bing; Li, Jing; Pan, Ruangang; Yang, Zhaohui; Zou, Wenjing; Zhan, Faxian; Guo, Deyin",Virus Res,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2017.01.009; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170216306979; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170216306979; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28089865/,0

With ~140,000 live births annually in Ohio and ~1 in 9,000 overall prevalence of MtDs, we estimate 2 to 3 newborns will have PDCD and 13 to 14 others likely will have another MtD annually. We compared the sensitivities of plasma amino acids (AA) Alanine (Ala), Alanine:Leucine (Ala:Leu), Alanine:Lysine and the combination of Ala:Leu and Proline:Leucine (Pro:Leu), in subjects with known primary‐specific PDCD due to PDHA1 and PDHB mutations vs controls. Furthermore, in collaboration with the Ohio newborn screening (NBS) laboratory, we determined Ala and Pro concentrations in dried blood spot (DBS) specimens using existing NBS analytic approaches and evaluated Ala:Leu and Pro:Leu ratios from DBS specimens of 123,414 Ohio newborns in a 12‐month period. We used the combined Ala:Leu ≥4.0 and Pro:Leu ≥3.0 ratio criterion from both DBS and plasma specimens as a screening tool in our retrospective review of newborn data. The screening tool applied on DBS and/or plasma (or serum) AA specimens successfully identified three unrelated females with novel de novo PDHA1 mutations, one male with a novel de novo X‐linked HSD17B10 mutation, and a female with VARS2 mutations. This work lays the first step for piloting an NBS protocol in Ohio for identifying newborns at high risk for primary‐specific PDCD and other MtDs who might benefit from neonatal diagnosis and early institution of known therapy and/or potential novel therapies for such disorders.","Bedoyan, Jirair K.; Hage, Rosemary; Shin, Ha Kyung; Linard, Sharon; Ferren, Edwin; Ducich, Nicole; Wilson, Kirkland; Lehman, April; Schillaci, Lori‐Anne; Manickam, Kandamurugu; Mori, Mari; Bartholomew, Dennis; DeBrosse, Suzanne; Cohen, Bruce; Parikh, Sumit; Kerr, Douglas",JIMD Rep,https://doi.org/10.1002/jmd2.12153; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33204598/,0

They are of interest for their simplicity, versatility, adaptability, ease of use and prototyping, which allow them to serve as a starting point for projects and as reference for all kinds of designs. In this sense, there are innumerable applications integrating sensors and communication technologies where they are increasingly used, including robotics, domotics, testing and measurement, Do-It-Yourself (DIY) projects, Internet of Things (IoT) devices in the home or workplace and science, technology, engineering, educational and also academic world for STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) skills. The interest in single-board architectures and their applications have caused that all electronics manufacturers currently develop low-cost single board platform solutions. In this paper we realized an analysis of the most important topics related with single-board architectures integrating sensors. We analyze the most popular platforms based on characteristics as: cost, processing capacity, integrated processing technology and open-source license, as well as power consumption (mA@V), reliability (%), programming flexibility, support availability and electronics utilities.

592669,Time to strengthen capacity in infectious disease control at the European level,2020-08-08,"Severe pneumonia and multiorgan dysfunction in COVID-19 and dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) are two diseases that can associate with an altered immune response to the infecting virus. To determine the similarities and differences in the cytokine and chemokine responses in these two infections, we compared responses in patients with varying severity of COVID-19 and acute dengue at different time points of illness. During early disease, patients who proceeded to develop COVID-19 severe pneumonia (SP) and DHF had significantly higher levels of IL-6, IL-10 and MIP3α than those who developed mild illness. The lowest levels of IFNγ in early illness were seen in those who succumbed to their illness due to COVID-19. Levels of serum IL-10 (p = 0.0001), IL-6 (p = 0.002), MIP-3α (p = 0.02) and CD40-L levels (p = 0.002) significantly increased from 5 to 9 day of illness to 10–21 day of illness in patients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19, but not in those with mild illness. In contrast, these cytokine/chemokine levels remained unchanged in those with DHF or dengue fever (DF) during febrile and critical phases. Although IL-10 levels were significantly higher in COVID-19 patients with SP, patients with DHF had 25-fold higher levels, whereas IL-6 levels were 11-fold higher in those with COVID-19 SP. IL-10 and other cytokines were evaluated in a larger cohort of patients during early illness (≤ 4 days) who proceeded to develop DF (n = 71) or DHF (n = 64). Of the cytokines evaluated, IL-10 was significantly higher (p < 0.0001) in those who went on to develop DHF compared to DF. Low IFNγ response to the SARS-CoV2 and high levels of immunosuppressive IL-10 in both COVID-19 and dengue during early illness are indicators of an altered antiviral response potentially contributing to disease severity.","Dayarathna, Shashika; Jeewandara, Chandima; Gomes, Laksiri; Somathilaka, Gayasha; Jayathilaka, Deshni; Vimalachandran, Vimalahan; Wijewickrama, Ananda; Narangoda, Eranga; Idampitiya, Damayanthi; Ogg, Graham S.; Malavige, Gathsaurie Neelika",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-76836-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33199778/,0

A brief prelude on the current state of affairs with COVID-19 is given. In addition to an overview of ACE2, Ang II, and Ang (1–7), this review presents a brief statement on hypertension, including the function of enzymes involved in the control of hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and other malignancies. RECENT FINDINGS: There is currently no data in support of the concerns raised with the use of ACEIs/ARBs. Many researchers have voiced concerns that the use of ACEIs and ARBs may increase tissue ACE2 levels. These researchers therefore recommend that individuals on ACEIs/ARB’s medications withhold such antihypertensive drugs, unless advised by their physicians to do so. SUMMARY: SARS-CoV-2 uses ACE2 receptors as the port of entry to human hosts. ACE2 and ACE are different enzymes and ACE inhibitors do not inhibit ACE2. Therefore, the use of ARB’s or ACEIs should not be discontinued if an individual is infected by SARS-CoV-2. Further studies are required to investigate the effect of ACEIs and ARBs on ACE2 expression and COVID-19.","Gathiram, Premjith; Mackraj, Irene; Moodley, Jagidesa",Curr Hypertens Rep,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11906-021-01134-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33768439/,0

Six days earlier, the Japan Surgical Society had recommended postponing elective surgical procedures. Along with the growing public fear of COVID-19, hospital visits in Japan decreased. METHODS: Using claims data from the Quality Indicator/Improvement Project (QIP) database, this study aimed to clarify the impact of the first wave of the pandemic, considered to be from March to May 2020, on case volume and claimed hospital charges in acute care hospitals during this period. To make year-over-year comparisons, we considered cases from July 2018 to June 2020. RESULTS: A total of 2,739,878 inpatient and 53,479,658 outpatient cases from 195 hospitals were included. In the year-over-year comparisons, total claimed hospital charges decreased in April, May, June 2020 by 7%, 14%, and 5%, respectively, compared to the same months in 2019. Our results also showed that per-case hospital charges increased during this period, possibly to compensate for the reduced case volumes. Regression results indicated that the hospital charges in April and May 2020 decreased by 6.3% for hospitals without COVID-19 patients. For hospitals with COVID-19 patients, there was an additional decrease in proportion with the length of hospital stay of COVID-19 patients including suspected cases. The mean additional decrease per COVID-19 patient was estimated to 5.5 million JPY.

Objectives: Describe the signalment, physical examination, diagnostic testing, clinical, and histopathologic findings related to diaphragmatic paralysis in alpacas. Animals: Eleven alpacas with spontaneous diaphragmatic paralysis. Methods: A retrospective study examined medical records from a 10‐year period and identified 11 alpacas with confirmed diaphragmatic paralysis admitted to Washington State University and Colorado State University Veterinary Teaching Hospitals between September 2003 and October 2009. Results: The 11 alpacas ranged in age from 2 to 12 months. Fluoroscopic imaging confirmed the presence of bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis in the 7 alpacas that were imaged. Arterial blood gas analyses showed hypercapnea, hypoxemia, and low oxygen saturation. Seven alpacas died or were euthanized between 2 and 60 days after onset of respiratory signs. Histopathologic examination of tissues found phrenic nerve degeneration in the 6 alpacas that were necropsied and additional long nerves examined demonstrated degeneration in 2 of these animals.

In the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol, three major glycopolypeptides, gp180, gp69, gp25 (as a group of similar species) and one major non-glycosylated polypeptide p58 were detected. The gp69 is a DVIM specific glycopolypeptide, in which the glycosidic moieties are linked to the core polypeptide through N-glycosidic bonds, and hence may be correlated with the short projections of the viral envelope. Further gp140, which appears in the absence of reducing agents, is apparently a dimer of gp69 held together by disulfide linkages. The gp25 family, on the other hand, consists of four polypeptides, two of which are not metabolically inhibited by tunicamycin suggesting that they are O-linked glycopolypeptides. DVIM seems to be serologically closely related to the MHV-S strain as shown by neutralization.","Sugiyama, K.; Ishikawa, R.; Fukuhara, N.",Arch Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3718235/,0

Multi-directional efforts are made to design small molecule inhibitors, and vaccines and many other therapeutic options are practiced, but their final therapeutic potential is still to be tested. Using the old drug or vaccine or peptides could aid this process to avoid such long experimental procedures. Hence, here, we have repurposed a small peptide (ATLQAIAS) from the previous study, which reported the inhibitory effects of this peptide. We used in silico mutagenesis approach to design more peptides from the native wild peptide, which revealed that substitutions (T2W, T2Y, L3R, and A5W) could increase the binding affinity of the peptide towards the 3CLpro. Furthermore, using MD simulation and free energy calculation confirmed its dynamics stability and stronger binding affinities. Per-residue energy decomposition analysis revealed that the specified substitution significantly increased the binding affinity at the residue level. Our wide-ranging analyses of binding affinities disclosed that our designed peptide owns the potential to hinder the SARS-CoV-2 and will reduce the progression of SARS-CoV-2-borne pneumonia. Our research strongly suggests the experimental and clinical validation of these peptides to curtail the recent corona outbreak.

Seasonal influenza viruses A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09 and B/Victoria-lineage were detected using a real-time RT-PCR in 323 (23.3%), 149 (10.7%) and 138 (9.9%) out of 1387 patient samples studied, respectively. The HA genes of A(H3N2) viruses analysed belonged to clades 3C.3a (21 strains) and 3C.2a (5 strains): subclades 3C.2a1b + T131K, 3C.2a1b + T135K-B and 3C.2a1b + T135K-A. The clade 3C.3a and subclade 3C.2a1b viruses carried 5 and 14–17 substitutions in HA, as well as 3 and 9 substitutions in NA, respectively, in comparison with the A/Kansas/14/2017 vaccine virus, including some substitutions in the HA antigenic sites A, B, C and E. All 21 A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses sequenced fell into 6B.1A5A subclade.

595543,Zoonotic disease research in East Africa,2018-11-03,"BACKGROUND: Class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules bind, and present to T cells, short peptides derived from intracellular processing of proteins. The peptide repertoire of a specific molecule is to a large extent determined by the molecular structure accommodating so-called main anchor positions of the presented peptide. These receptors are extremely polymorphic, and much of the polymorphism influences the peptide-binding repertoire. However, despite this polymorphism, class I molecules can be clustered into sets of molecules that bind largely overlapping peptide repertoires. Almost a decade ago we introduced this concept of clustering human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles and defined nine different groups, denominated as supertypes, on the basis of their main anchor specificity. The utility of this original supertype classification, as well several other subsequent arrangements derived by others, has been demonstrated in a large number of epitope identification studies. RESULTS: Following our original approach, in the present report we provide an updated classification of HLA-A and -B class I alleles into supertypes. The present analysis incorporates the large amount of class I MHC binding data and sequence information that has become available in the last decade. As a result, over 80% of the 945 different HLA-A and -B alleles examined to date can be assigned to one of the original nine supertypes. A few alleles are expected to be associated with repertoires that overlap multiple supertypes. Interestingly, the current analysis did not identify any additional supertype specificities. CONCLUSION: As a result of this updated analysis, HLA supertype associations have been defined for over 750 different HLA-A and -B alleles. This information is expected to facilitate epitope identification and vaccine design studies, as well as investigations into disease association and correlates of immunity. In addition, the approach utilized has been made more transparent, allowing others to utilize the classification approach going forward.","Sidney, John; Peters, Bjoern; Frahm, Nicole; Brander, Christian; Sette, Alessandro",BMC Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18211710/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2172-9-1,0

Humanitas Clinical and Research Hospital (Rozzano, MI, Italy) was declared a regional hub for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. Our plastic surgery team, in consultation with our breast surgery colleagues, decided to perform immediate implant-based breast reconstruction for patients undergoing mastectomy for cancer. In this report, we present our experience performing breast reconstruction with a new protocol in the first month following the COVID-19 pandemic in the most affected region in Italy. METHODS: We adopted a new protocol to treat patients with breast cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic. The main goals of our protocol were to reduce the risk of COVID-19 spread for both patients and clinicians, postpone nononcologic and more advanced surgery, develop rapid recovery for early patient discharge (within 24 hours from surgery) through pain management, and finally reduce postoperative consultations. RESULTS: The protocol was applied to 51 patients between early March and early April 2020. After 1 month, we decided to retrospectively review our experience. We found no significant differences in terms of postoperative pain and complication rate compared with our data in the pre-COVID period. CONCLUSION: Our new protocol is safe and effective, enabling tumor resection and immediate implant-based breast reconstruction, without increasing risks to the patient or staff.","Lisa, Andrea; Battistini, Andrea; Giannasi, Silvia; Veronesi, Alessandra; Bandi, Valeria; Maione, Luca; Vinci, Valeriano; Tinterri, Corrado; Babbini, Marco; Klinger, Marco",Plastic and reconstructive surgery.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We included COVID-19 outpatients of a Peruvian primary care center from Lima, Peru, who were treated between April 30 - September 30, 2020, with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. Logistic regression was applied to determine factors associated with case-fatality rate. RESULTS: A total of 1265 COVID-19 patients with an average age of 44.5 years were studied. Women represented 50.1% of patients, with an overall 5.9 symptom days, SpO2 97%, temperature of 37.3 °C, 41% with at least one comorbidity and 96.1% one symptom or sign. No patient treated within the first 72 h of illness died. The factors associated with higher case fatality rate were age (OR = 1.06; 95% CI 1.01–1.11, p = 0.021), SpO2 (OR = 0.87; 95% CI 0.79–0.96, p = 0.005) and treatment onset (OR = 1.16; 95% CI 1.06–1.27, p = 0.002), being the latter the only associated in the multivariate analysis (OR = 1.18; 95% CI 1.05–1.32, p = 0.005). 0.6% of our patients died.

604441,COVID-19 and antimicrobial stewardship: What is the interplay?,2020-05-15,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel human coronavirus causing the pandemic of severe pneumonia (Coronavirus Disease 2019, COVID-19). SARS-CoV-2 is highly pathogenic in human, having posed immeasurable public health challenges to the world. Innate immune response is critical for the host defense against viral infection and the dysregulation of the host innate immune responses probably aggravates SARS-CoV-2 infection, contributing to the high morbidity and lethality of COVID-19. It has been reported that some coronavirus proteins play an important role in modulating innate immunity of the host, but few studies have been conducted on SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we screened the viral proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and found that the viral ORF6, ORF8 and nucleocapsid proteins were potential inhibitors of type I interferon signaling pathway, a key component for antiviral response of host innate immune. All the three proteins showed strong inhibition on type I interferon (IFN-β) and NF-κB-responsive promoter, further examination revealed that these proteins were able to inhibit the interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE) after infection with Sendai virus, while only ORF6 and ORF8 proteins were able to inhibit the ISRE after treatment with interferon beta. These findings would be helpful for the further study of the detailed signaling pathway and unveil the key molecular player that may be targeted.","Li, Jin-Yan; Liao, Ce-Heng; Wang, Qiong; Tan, Yong-Jun; Luo, Rui; Qiu, Ye; Ge, Xing-Yi",Virus Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32589897/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2020.198074; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170220308170?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170220308170,0

In summer, 2020, we distributed an online survey to executive administrators of 286 Villages in the network. During the pandemic, over 75% of Villages were seen as more or equally valuable for members. Seventy-seven percent of Villages offered virtual socialization events. Most Villages reported a decrease in service requests, given reductions in need for transportation. New services of food and medication delivery were initiated. There is much variation between organizations, but findings suggest that Villages that are older, have more members, and bigger budgets had more capacity and cushion; and although they took a negative hit in income and participation, it was a smaller hit proportionately, compared to younger and smaller Villages. Villages have demonstrated adaptability and creativity. They kept their operations running, provided services, and offered social connection. Vulnerabilities have been exposed: memberships have dropped for many and some members have not been able to participate as before the pandemic.

Concern about its associated morbidity and cost has led to a large body of research that has been summarised in systematic reviews and integrated into clinical practice guidelines in several countries. The evidence and guideline recommendations consistently support a clinical diagnosis with the limited role for diagnostic testing for children presenting with the typical clinical syndrome of viral upper respiratory infection progressing to the lower respiratory tract. Management is largely supportive, focusing on maintaining oxygenation and hydration of the patient. Evidence suggests no benefit from bronchodilator or corticosteroid use in infants with a first episode of bronchiolitis. Evidence for other treatments such as hypertonic saline is evolving but not clearly defined yet. For infants with severe disease, the insufficient available data suggest a role for high-flow nasal cannula and continuous positive airway pressure use in a monitored setting to prevent respiratory failure.","Florin, Todd A; Plint, Amy C; Zorc, Joseph J",The Lancet,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673616309515; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0140673616309515; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27549684/; https://doi.org/10.1016/s0140-6736(16)30951-5,0
607188,Possible protective role of 17β-estradiol against COVID-19,2020-08-19,"BACKGROUND: Local anaesthesia (LA) is used widely in several clinical scenarios in hospital practice. A number of minor trauma wounds are treated under LA at the North Bristol Trust, and on most occasions, these patients are admitted to the emergency department (ED) and treated there. On other occasions, more complex wounds may be treated by the plastic surgery team. The aim of this study is to compare the preferences of LA agents between these departments in cases of minor trauma. The authors also present a narrative review of the literature and determine best practice. METHODS: A single-centre clinical practice survey was developed and distributed to both departments which involved two case scenarios, one involving a head injury to the occiput (scenario 1) and one nailed repair (scenario 2) both requiring treatment under LA. RESULTS: In both scenarios ED favoured lidocaine (89%) whereas the plastic surgery team preferred to mix solutions. In scenario 1, 89% of ED participants chose lidocaine 1%, but only 38% of the plastic surgery team chose it. Forty-two percent of ED chose to use adrenaline but 100% plastic surgery team chose it. Both teams refrained from using adrenaline in digits, but 23% of the plastic surgery team chose it. Eighty-four percent of ED chose 25G needles, and the plastic surgery team’s choices varied. CONCLUSIONS: This study has shown marked differences in the use of LA between two specialties in a major trauma centre. There is good quality evidence to support the safety of adrenaline use in digits with the addition of sodium bicarbonate to decrease the pain inflicted to the patient upon infiltration of LA. This study serves to raise awareness of the surgical dogma around adrenaline use and provide clinicians with an evidence-based guide to managing minor trauma with LA.

607681,The Epidemiology of Invasive Meningococcal Disease in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia: A Narrative Review with Updated Analysis,2021-08-14,"SARS-CoV-2 is causing a pandemic resulting in high morbidity and mortality. COVID-19 patients suffering from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are often critically ill and show lung injury and hemolysis. Heme is a prosthetic moiety crucial for the function of a wide variety of heme-proteins, including hemoglobin and cytochromes. However, injury-derived free heme promotes adhesion molecule expression, leukocyte recruitment, vascular permeabilization, platelet activation, complement activation, thrombosis, and fibrosis. Heme can be degraded by the anti-inflammatory enzyme heme oxygenase (HO) generating biliverdin/bilirubin, iron/ferritin, and carbon monoxide. We therefore postulate that free heme contributes to many of the inflammatory phenomena witnessed in critically ill COVID-19 patients, whilst induction of HO-1 or harnessing heme may provide protection. HO-activity not only degrades injurious heme, but its effector molecules possess also potent salutary anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory properties. Until a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 becomes available, we need to explore novel strategies to attenuate the pro-inflammatory, pro-thrombotic, and pro-fibrotic consequences of SARS-CoV-2 leading to morbidity and mortality. The heme-HO system represents an interesting target for novel “proof of concept” studies in the context of COVID-19.","Wagener, Frank A. D. T.

Telemedicine shows promise to address these challenges but lacks comprehensive evaluation in the inpatient environment. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to evaluate an intrahospital telemedicine program (virtual care), along with its impact on exposure risk and communication. METHODS: We conducted a natural experiment of virtual care on patients admitted for COVID-19. The primary exposure variable was documented use of virtual care. Patient characteristics, PPE use rates, and their association with virtual care use were assessed. In parallel, we conducted surveys with patients and clinicians to capture satisfaction with virtual care along the domains of communication, medical treatment, and exposure risk. RESULTS: Of 137 total patients in our primary analysis, 43 patients used virtual care. In total, there were 82 inpatient days of use and 401 inpatient days without use. Hospital utilization and illness severity were similar in patients who opted in versus opted out. Virtual care was associated with a significant reduction in PPE use and physical exam rate. Surveys of 41 patients and clinicians showed high rates of recommendation for further use, and subjective improvements in communication. However, providers and patients expressed limitations in usability, medical assessment, and empathetic communication. CONCLUSIONS: In this pilot natural experiment, only a subset of patients used inpatient virtual care. When used, virtual care was associated with reductions in PPE use, reductions in exposure risk, and patient and provider satisfaction.","Legler, Sean; Diehl, Matthew; Hilliard, Brian; Olson, Andrew; Markowitz, Rebecca; Tignanelli, Christopher; Melton, Genevieve B; Broccard, Alain; Kirsch, Jonathan; Usher, Michael",J Med Internet Res,https://doi.org/10.2196/25987; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33872187/,0

However, the mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 triggers inflammatory responses remains unclear. Here, we aimed to explore the regulatory role of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in infected cells and attempted to elucidate the molecular mechanism of SARS-CoV-2-induced inflammation. METHODS: SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudovirions (SCV-2-S) were generated using the spike-expressing virus packaging system. Western blot, mCherry-GFP-LC3 labeling, immunofluorescence, and RNA-seq were performed to examine the regulatory mechanism of SCV-2-S in autophagic response. The effects of SCV-2-S on apoptosis were evaluated by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL), Western blot, and flow cytometry analysis. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was carried out to examine the mechanism of SCV-2-S in inflammatory responses. RESULTS: Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)-mediated SCV-2-S infection induced autophagy and apoptosis in human bronchial epithelial and microvascular endothelial cells. Mechanistically, SCV-2-S inhibited the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway by upregulating intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, thus promoting the autophagic response. Ultimately, SCV-2-S-induced autophagy triggered inflammatory responses and apoptosis in infected cells. These findings not only improve our understanding of the mechanism underlying SARS-CoV-2 infection-induced pathogenic inflammation but also have important implications for developing anti-inflammatory therapies, such as ROS and autophagy inhibitors, for COVID-19 patients.","Li, Fei; Li, Jingyao; Wang, Pei-Hui; Yang, Nanyan; Huang, Junyu; Ou, Jinxin; Xu, Ting; Zhao, Xin; Liu, Taoshu; Huang, Xueying; Wang, Qinghuan; Li, Miao; Yang, Le; Lin, Yunchen; Cai, Ying; Chen, Haisheng; Zhang, Qing",Biochim Biophys Acta Mol Basis Dis,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0925443921001939; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34461258/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925443921001939?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbadis.2021.166260,0

612229,Case Report: Severe COVID-19 in a Kidney Transplant Recipient Without Humoral Response to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA Vaccine Series,2021-08-06,"The appearance of novel pathogens of humans with epidemic potential and high mortality rates have threatened global health security for centuries. Over the past few decades new zoonotic infectious diseases of humans caused by pathogens arising from animal reservoirs have included West Nile virus, Yellow fever virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus, Lassa Fever virus, Hanta virus, Dengue fever virus, Rift Valley fever virus, Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus, and Zika virus. The recent Ebola Virus Disease epidemic in West Africa and the ongoing Zika Virus outbreak in South America highlight the urgent need for local, regional and international public health systems to be be more coordinated and better prepared. The One Health concept focuses on the relationship and interconnectedness between Humans, Animals and the Environment, and recognizes that the health and wellbeing of humans is intimately connected to the health of animals and their environment (and vice versa). Critical to the establishment of a One Health platform is the creation of a multidisciplinary team with a range of expertise including public health officers, physicians, veterinarians, animal husbandry specialists, agriculturalists, ecologists, vector biologists, viral phylogeneticists, and researchers to co-operate, collaborate to learn more about zoonotic spread between animals, humans and the environment and to monitor, respond to and prevent major outbreaks. We discuss the unique opportunities for Middle Eastern and African stakeholders to take leadership in building equitable and effective partnerships with all stakeholders involved in human and health systems to take forward a ‘One Health’ approach to control such zoonotic pathogens with epidemic potential.","Zumla, Alimuddin; Dar, Osman; Kock, Richard; Muturi, Matthew; Ntoumi, Francine; Kaleebu, Pontiano; Eusebio, Macete; Mfinanga, Sayoki; Bates, Matthew; Mwaba, Peter; Ansumana, Rashid; Khan, Mishal; Alagaili, Abdulaziz N.; Cotten, Matthew; Azhar, Esam I.; Maeurer, Markus; Ippolito, Giuseppe; Petersen, Eskild",Int J Infect Dis,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971216310967; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27321961/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971216310967; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2016.06.012,0

Detailed evaluations of phenotypic expressions of illness are required to characterize important biological outcomes. We hypothesized that classifying dairy calf mortality phenotypes via a systematic postmortem analysis would identify different cause-of-death diagnoses than those derived from treatments alone. This cross-sectional study was carried out on a dairy calf ranch in the northwestern United States from June to September 2017 and focused on calves ≤90 d of age. Comparisons were made between causes of death based on 3 levels of information: on-farm treatment records alone, necropsy-based postmortem analyses in addition to treatment records, and Washington Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory (WADDL) results in addition to all other information. A total of 210 dairy calves were necropsied during this study, of which 122 cases were submitted to WADDL. Necropsy- and WADDL-derived mortality phenotypes were in almost perfect agreement (Cohen's κ = 0.86) when broadly categorized as diarrhea, respiratory, diarrhea and respiratory combined, or other causes. The level of agreement between on-farm treatment records and postmortem-derived results was low and varied by the level of diagnostic detail provided. There was just fair agreement (κ = 0.22) between treatment-based and necropsy-based phenotypes without WADDL input and only slight agreement (κ = 0.13) between treatment-based and corresponding necropsy-based phenotypes with WADDL input. Even for those cases in which causes of death aligned along a comparable pathologic spectrum, the lack of detail inherent to standard treatment-based causes of death failed to identify meaningful target areas for intervention. This was especially apparent for numerous cases of necrotizing enteritis and typhlitis (cecal inflammation) that were variously categorized as diarrhea and pneumonia by treatment-based diagnoses. The specificity of these lesions stood in stark contrast to the otherwise generic cause of death diagnoses derived from treatments. The findings from this study supported the hypothesis and highlighted the value of on-farm necropsies and laboratory-based diagnostics to (1) detect antemortem disease misclassifications, (2) provide detail regarding disease processes and mortality phenotypes, and (3) direct disease mitigation strategies.","McConnel, C.S.; Nelson, D.D.; Burbick, C.R.; Buhrig, S.M.; Wilson, E.A.; Klatt, C.T.; Moore, D.A.",J Dairy Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30879809/; https://doi.org/10.3168/jds.2018-15527; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022030219302528; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022030219302528,0

Transactional Model of Stress and Coping is an established model, conceptualizing stressful experiences via person–environment relationship. This cross-sectional study aimed to explore the pathway from stress to depression/anxiety, with a focus on self-criticism (inadequate-self and hated-self) and self-reassurance (reassured-self) in Czech students who suffered from high prevalence of mental health problems. Convenience sample of 119 undergraduates completed the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 and the Forms of the Self-Criticizing/Attacking & Self-Reassuring Scale. Correlation and path analyses were conducted. The Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines were used to aid an accurate and complete report of the study. Depression, anxiety, and stress were positively associated with inadequate-self and hated-self while negatively associated with reassured-self. Both inadequate-self and hated-self partially mediated the stress–depression and stress–anxiety relationships, whereas reassured-self only partially mediated the stress–depression relationship. Inadequate-self had greater impact on the stress–depression/anxiety pathways than hated-self and reassured-self. Findings indicate that clinical treatment may benefit from targeting the feelings of inadequacy to prevent stress progressing to psychopathology. This is particularly relevant as stress levels are rising globally. Our findings offer developments to the Transactional Model, and help practitioners and educators identify solutions to protect mental health of Czech university students.","Kotera, Yasuhiro; Dosedlova, Jaroslava; Andrzejewski, Denise; Kaluzeviciute, Greta; Sakai, Makoto",Int J Ment Health Addict,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33723485/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11469-021-00516-z,0

The characterization of the immunological mechanisms involved in disease symptomatology and protective response is important to advance in disease control and prevention. Humans evolved by losing the capacity to synthesize the glycan Galα1-3Galβ1-(3)4GlcNAc-R (α-Gal), which resulted in the development of a protective response against pathogenic viruses and other microorganisms containing this modification on membrane proteins mediated by anti-α-Gal IgM/IgG antibodies produced in response to bacterial microbiota. In addition to anti-α-Gal antibody-mediated pathogen opsonization, this glycan induces various immune mechanisms that have shown protection in animal models against infectious diseases without inflammatory responses. In this study, we hypothesized that the immune response to α-Gal may contribute to the control of COVID-19. To address this hypothesis, we characterized the antibody response to α-Gal in patients at different stages of COVID-19 and in comparison with healthy control individuals. The results showed that while the inflammatory response and the anti-SARS-CoV-2 (Spike) IgG antibody titers increased, reduction in anti-α-Gal IgE, IgM and IgG antibody titers and alteration of anti-α-Gal antibody isotype composition correlated with COVID-19 severity. The results suggested that the inhibition of the α-Gal-induced immune response may translate into more aggressive viremia and severe disease inflammatory symptoms. These results support the proposal of developing interventions such as probiotics based on commensal bacteria with α-Gal epitopes to modify the microbiota and increase the α-Gal-induced protective immune response and reduce the severity of COVID-19.","Urra, José Miguel; Ferreras-Colino, Elisa; Contreras, Marinela; Cabrera, Carmen M.; Fernández de Mera, Isabel G.; Villar, Margarita; Cabezas-Cruz, Alejandro; Gortázar, Christian; de la Fuente, José",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.14.201954,0

Detection of these RNA H-type pseudoknots can improve our understanding of RNA structures and their associated functions. However, the currently existing programs for detecting such RNA H-type pseudoknots are still time consuming and sometimes even ineffective. Therefore, efficient and effective tools for detecting the RNA H-type pseudoknots are needed. Results: In this paper, we have adopted a heuristic approach to develop a novel tool, called HPknotter, for efficiently and accurately detecting H-type pseudoknots in an RNA sequence. In addition, we have demonstrated the applicability and effectiveness of HPknotter by testing on some sequences with known H-type pseudoknots. Our approach can be easily extended and applied to other classes of more general pseudoknots.

Housing of the dam, conditions for birth, preparation for intervention, and plans for treatment and hand-rearing of sick neonates must all be considered carefully before undertaking nondomestic ruminant breeding. Unfortunately, neonatal losses tend to be much higher in nondomestic calves before weaning than in domestic cattle, sheep, and goat herds.1 With continued habitat and population declines in wild species, successful captive breeding of nondomestic herds becomes more important to species sustainability and potential reintroduction programs. The primary challenges contributing to neonatal losses in nondomestic ruminants are often animal temperament and adaptation to captivity. Only through experience can some of these challenges be overcome. However, by understanding some species-specific behavioral tendencies and the fractious nature of nondomestic ruminants in general, we can improve our success in managing and maintaining healthy populations of nondomestic ruminants in captivity.","Wolfe, Barbara A.; Lamberski, Nadine",Vet Clin North Am Exot Anim Pract,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1094919412000060; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1094919412000060; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cvex.2012.02.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22640541/,0

In this work it was aimed to assess ventilation conditions (carbon dioxide, CO(2)) and suspended particulate matter (PM(2.5), PM(10) and UFP) levels in 19 classrooms – including preschool, primary and secondary education – located in the metropolitan area of Ciudad Real, Central-Southern Spain, during the school’s reopening (from September 30th until October 27th, 2020) after about 7 months of lockdown due to COVID-19 pandemic. The classrooms that presented the worst indoor environmental conditions, according to the highest peak of concentration obtained, were particularly explored to identify the possible influencing factors and respective opportunities for improvement. Briefly, findings suggested that although ventilation promoted through opening windows and doors according to official recommendations is guaranteeing adequate ventilation conditions in most of the studied classrooms, thus minimizing the risk of SARS-CoV-2 airborne transmission, a total of 5 (26%) surveyed classrooms were found to exceed the recommended CO(2) concentration limit value (700 ppm). In general, preschool rooms were the educational environments that registered better ventilation conditions, while secondary classrooms exhibited the highest peak and average CO(2) concentrations. In turn, for PM(2.5), PM(10) and UFP, the concentrations assessed in preschools were, on average about 2-fold greater than the levels obtained in both primary and secondary classrooms. In fact, the indoor PM(2.5) and PM(10) concentrations substantially exceeded the recommended limits of 8hr-exposure, established by WHO, in 63% and 32% of the surveyed classrooms, respectively. Overall, it is expected that the findings presented in this study will assist the establishment of evidence-based measures (namely based on ensuring proper ventilation rates and air filtration) to mitigate preventable environmental harm in public school buildings, mainly at local and national levels.","Villanueva, Florentina; Notario, Alberto; Cabañas, Beatriz; Martín, Pilar; Salgado, Sagrario; Gabriel, Marta Fonseca",Environ Res,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935121003868?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0013935121003868; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2021.111092; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33785326/,0

In the current study, two recombinant baculovirus were generated to express the spike (S) protein of SARS-like coronavirus (SL-CoV) isolated from bats (vAcBS) and the envelope (E) and membrane (M) proteins of SARS-CoV, respectively. Co-infection of insect cells with these two recombinant baculoviruses led to self-assembly of virus-like particles (BVLPs) as demonstrated by electron microscopy. Incorporation of S protein of vAcBS (BS) into VLPs was confirmed by western blot and immunogold labeling. Such BVLPs up-regulated the level of CD40, CD80, CD86, CD83, and enhanced the secretion of IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-α in immature dendritic cells (DCs). Immune responses were compared in immature DCs inoculated with BVLPs or with VLPs formed by S, E and M proteins of human SARS-CoV. BVLPs showed a stronger ability to stimulate DCs in terms of cytokine induction as evidenced by 2 to 6 fold higher production of IL-6 and TNF-α. Further study indicated that IFN-γ+ and IL-4+ populations in CD4+ T cells increased upon co-cultivation with DCs pre-exposed with BVLPs or SARS-CoV VLPs. The observed difference in DC-stimulating activity between BVLPs and SARS CoV VLPs was very likely due to the S protein. In agreement, SL-CoV S DNA vaccine evoked a more vigorous antibody response and a stronger T cell response than SARS-CoV S DNA in mice. Our data have demonstrated for the first time that SL-CoV VLPs formed by membrane proteins of different origins, one from SL-CoV isolated from bats (BS) and the other two from human SARS-CoV (E and M), activated immature DCs and enhanced the expression of co-stimulatory molecules and the secretion of cytokines. Finding in this study may provide important information for vaccine development as well as for understanding the pathogenesis of SARS-like CoV.","Bai, Bingke; Hu, Qinxue; Hu, Hui; Zhou, Peng; Shi, Zhengli; Meng, Jin; Lu, Baojing; Huang, Yi; Mao, Panyong; Wang, Hanzhong",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0002685; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18628832/,0

The aim of this rapid review is to highlight the role of thrombosis in COVID-19 and provide new insights on the use of antithrombotic therapy in its management. A rapid systematic review was performed using preferred reporting items for systematic reviews. Papers published in English on antithrombotic agent use and COVID-19 complications were eligible. Results showed that the use of anticoagulants increased survival and reduced thromboembolic events in patients. However, despite the use of anticoagulants, patients still suffered thrombotic events likely due to heparin resistance. Data on antiplatelet use in combination with anticoagulants in the setting of COVID-19 is quite scarce. Current side effects of anticoagulation therapy emphasize the need to update treatment guidelines. In this rapid review, we address a possible modulatory role of antiplatelet and anticoagulant combination against COVID-19 pathogenesis.

624239,SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 INFECTION IN TRANSPLANT RECIPIENTS AND IN PATIENTS ON THE ORGAN TRANSPLANT WAITING LIST IN COLOMBIA,2021-01-13,"Background: Since its first report on March 08, COVID-19 positive cases and number of deaths are increasing in Bangladesh. In the first month of COVID-19 infection, incidence of daily positive cases did follow the susceptible, infected and recovered (SIR) based predictions we reported in April, but started to deviate in the following month. COVID-19 transmission and disease progression depends on multifaceted determinants e.g. viral genetics, host immunity, social distancing, co-morbidity, socio-demographic and environmental parameters. Therefore deviation in confirmed cases from predicted model may appear and warrant thorough investigation. In this short report, we tried to demonstrate and analyze the possible factors associated with the deviation which included preventive intervention strategies, socioeconomic capabilities, climatic and meteorological indexes, acquired immunity of Bangladeshi population, demographic characteristics, health indicators and food habits. Findings: The key factor responsible for the deviation was found to be the number of tests performed. Having population with low median age, young age groups are being mostly infected. Low prevalence of non-communicable diseases among them and strong immunity compared to the elderly might have kept most of them asymptomatic with silent recovery. Warm temperature, humidity and UV index of Bangladesh during this summer period might have contributed to the slow progression of infection. Longer daylight mediated immunity, fresh air circulations and ventilation, less density in rural areas and certain food habits perhaps helped the large number of populations to restrict the infection. Conclusion: Despite all these helpful determinants in Bangladesh, person to person contact is still the leading risk factor for COVID-19 transmission. Infection may increase rapidly if safe distance and preventive measures are not strictly followed while resuming the normal social and work life. A global second wave may hit in many countries in autumn and as well as in Bangladesh in mid-October when winter starts to approach. Strong collaborative action plans, strategies and implementation are needed immediately to prevent catastrophe.","Ahmed, A.; Rahman, M.

Influenza C virus is unique since it contains only one spike protein, the hemagglutinin-esterase-fusion glycoprotein HEF that possesses receptor binding, receptor destroying and membrane fusion activities, thus combining the functions of Hemagglutinin (HA) and Neuraminidase (NA) of influenza A and B viruses. Here we briefly review the epidemiology and pathology of the virus and the morphology of virus particles and their genome. The main focus is on the structure of the HEF protein as well as on its co- and post-translational modification, such as N-glycosylation, disulfide bond formation, S-acylation and proteolytic cleavage into HEF1 and HEF2 subunits. Finally, we describe the functions of HEF: receptor binding, esterase activity and membrane fusion.

Dry and cold conditions during winter are the major drivers for increased respiratory tract infections as they increase virus stability and transmission and weaken the host immune system. The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in China in December 2020 and swiftly spread across the globe causing substantial health and economic burdens. Several countries are battling with the second wave of the virus after a devastating first wave of spread, while some are still in the midst of their first wave. It remains unclear whether SARS-CoV-2 will eventually become seasonal or will continue to circulate year-round. In an attempt to address this question, we review the current knowledge regarding the seasonality of respiratory viruses including coronaviruses and the viral and host factors that govern their seasonal pattern. Moreover, we discuss the properties of SARS-CoV-2 and the potential impact of meteorological factors on its spread.","Audi, Amani; AlIbrahim, Malak; Kaddoura, Malak; Hijazi, Ghina; Yassine, Hadi M.; Zaraket, Hassan",Front Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33042956/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2020.567184,0

Major advances have been made in identifying RIG-I ligands, but our knowledge of the ligands for MDA5 remains restricted to data from transfection experiments mostly using poly(I:C), a synthetic dsRNA mimic. Here, we dissected the IFN-α/β-stimulatory activity of different viral RNA species produced during picornavirus infection, both by RNA transfection and in infected cells in which specific steps of viral RNA replication were inhibited. Our results show that the incoming genomic plus-strand RNA does not activate MDA5, but minus-strand RNA synthesis and production of the 7.5 kbp replicative form trigger a strong IFN-α/β response. IFN-α/β production does not rely on plus-strand RNA synthesis and thus generation of the partially double-stranded replicative intermediate.

626937,Drape to Prevent Disease Transmission During Endotracheal Intubation,2020-07-03,"Detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antigens in the fluid has important uses in biotechnology, and is integral to many point-of-care SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics. Sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) are a sensitive, well-established method of measuring antigens in solutions. They use one ligand to capture and the other ligand to detect the target analyte. Detection is commonly achieved using colorimetric readout obtained upon the reaction of a substrate with HRP-conjugated secondary ligand. Nanobodies, the V(H)H domain of camelid antibodies, have expanded the repertoire of molecules used in antigen detection. Nanobodies' high affinity for target antigens, their compact structure, their high stability and ease of production has driven research into their use as diagnostic reagents. Guided by a structural understanding of epitopes on the receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, we investigated various combinations of engineered nanobodies in a sandwich ELISA to detect the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. We have identified an optimal combination of nanobodies. These were selectively functionalized to further improve antigen capture, enabling the measurement of sub-picomolar amounts of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein in solution. With this combination, the routine detection limit in samples inactivated by heat and detergent corresponded to less than seven focus-forming units of infectious SARS-CoV-2.","Girt, Georgina C.; Lakshminarayanan, Abirami; Huo, Jiandong; Dormon, Joshua; Norman, Chelsea; Afrough, Babak; Harding, Adam; James, William; Owens, Raymond J.; Naismith, James H.",Royal Society open science,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34631127/; https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.211016,0

628125,Endophthalmitis caused by Mycobacterium houstonense: case report,2020-11-16,"Background: In the current coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, lung ultrasound (LUS) has been extensively employed to evaluate lung involvement and proposed as a useful screening tool for early diagnosis in the emergency department (ED), prehospitalization triage, and treatment monitoring of COVID-19 pneumonia. However, the actual effectiveness of LUS in characterizing lung involvement in COVID-19 is still unclear. Our aim was to evaluate LUS diagnostic performance in assessing or ruling out COVID-19 pneumonia when compared with chest CT (gold standard) in a population of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. Methods: A total of 260 consecutive RT-PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2-infected patients were included in the study. All the patients underwent both chest CT scan and concurrent LUS at admission, within the first 6–12 h of hospital stay. Results: Chest CT scan was considered positive when showing a “typical” or “indeterminate” pattern for COVID-19, according to the RSNA classification system. Disease prevalence for COVID-19 pneumonia was 90.77%. LUS demonstrated a sensitivity of 56.78% in detecting lung alteration. The concordance rate for the assessment of abnormalities by both methods increased in the case of peripheral distribution and middle-lower lung location of lesions and in cases of more severe lung involvement. A total of nine patients had a “false-positive” LUS examination. Alternative diagnosis included chronic heart disease (six cases), bronchiectasis (two cases), and subpleural emphysema (one case). LUS specificity was 62.50%. Collateral findings indicative of overlapping conditions at chest CT were recorded also in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and appeared distributed with increasing frequency passing from the group with mild disease (17 cases) to that with severe disease (40 cases). Conclusions: LUS does not seem to be an adequate tool for screening purposes in the ED, due to the risk of missing some lesions and/or to underestimate the actual extent of the disease. Furthermore, the not specificity of LUS implies the possibility to erroneously classify pre-existing or overlapping conditions as COVID-19 pneumonia. It seems more safe to integrate a positive LUS examination with clinical, epidemiological, laboratory, and radiologic findings to suggest a “virosis.” Viral testing confirmation is always required.","Quarato, Carla Maria Irene; Mirijello, Antonio; Maggi, Michele Maria; Borelli, Cristina; Russo, Raffaele; Lacedonia, Donato; Foschino Barbaro, Maria Pia; Scioscia, Giulia; Tondo, Pasquale; Rea, Gaetano; Simeone, Annalisa; Feragalli, Beatrice; Massa, Valentina; Greco, Antonio; De Cosmo, Salvatore; Sperandeo, Marco",Front Med (Lausanne),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34350201/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2021.707602,0

DESIGN: We conducted a cross-sectional multi-country online survey between May and July 2020. We used a study-specific questionnaire mainly based on the adaptation of questions to assess food security and coping strategies from the World Food Programme’s ‘Emergency Food Security Assessment’ and ‘The Coping Strategy Index’. SETTING: The questionnaire was hosted online using Google Forms and shared using social media platforms. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1075 adult participants from eighty-two countries completed the questionnaire. RESULTS: As a prelude to COVID-19 lockdowns, 62·7 % of the participants reported to have stockpiled food, mainly cereals (59·5 % of the respondents) and legumes (48·8 %). An increase in the prices of staples, such as cereals and legumes, was widely reported. Price increases have been identified as an obstacle to food acquisition by 32·7 % of participants. Participants reported having lesser variety (50·4 %), quality (30·2 %) and quantity (39·2 %) of foods, with disparities across regions. Vulnerable groups were reported to be facing some struggle to acquire adequate food, especially people with chronic diseases (20·2 %), the elderly (17·3 %) and children (14·5 %). To cope with the situation, participants mostly relied on less preferred foods (49 %), reduced portion sizes (30 %) and/or reduced the number of meals (25·7 %). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted food accessibility and availability, altered dietary practices and worsened the food insecurity situation, particularly in the most fragile regions.","Jafri, Ali; Mathe, Nonsikelelo; Aglago, Elom K; Konyole, Silvenus O; Ouedraogo, Moussa; Audain, Keiron; Zongo, Urbain; Laar, Amos K; Johnson, Jeffrey; Sanou, Dia",Public health nutrition,https://doi.org/10.1017/s1368980021000987; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33663623/,0

The high incidence and mortality of COVID-19 was the reason for the beginning of intensive work on the development of an effective vaccine. In Poland, mass vaccinations against this disease began at the end of December 2020. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the presented study was to determine the effectiveness of stimulating the production of specific antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 by the Pfizer vaccine. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The presence of IgA and IgG antibodies to the spike (S protein) of SARSCoV-2 was tested by the ELISA/Euroimmun in serum samples obtained from 140 the employees of NIPH-NIH (137 were vaccinated). In addition, the presence of IgG antibodies to S protein, nucleoprotein, and mixture of both in selected serum samples was tested by the newly developed in NIPH-NIH in-house ELISA assay. RESULTS: IgA and IgG antibodies to the S protein of the SARS-CoV-2 were detected by ELISA/Euroimmun, respectively in 136 and in all 137 vaccinated persons. There were no statistically significant differences in the level of antibodies depending on the sex and age of the vaccinated persons. Slightly higher levels of antibodies have been demonstrated in vaccinated subjects with documented preexisting SARS-CoV-2 immunity compared to subjects without COVID-19 history. The presence of IgA and IgG antibodies was found in respectively, 18 (45.0%) and all 40 (100.0%) tested vaccinated persons by the in-house ELISA with mixture antigen. The study showed that ELISA assay with N protein as an antigen may enable the distinction between antibodies acquired after infection and after vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: The results obtained in the presented study clearly demonstrate the high effectiveness of the Pfizer vaccine in stimulation of the human immune system to produce antibodies specific for the S protein of the SARS-CoV-2. It is necessary to continue testing vaccine antibody levels at various times after vaccination to determine the potential duration of humoral immunity.","Rastawicki, Waldemar; Plaza, Klaudia",Przegl Epidemiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34328282/; https://doi.org/10.32394/pe.75.01,0

634262,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Biophysical and biochemical aspects of SARS-CoV-2 and general characteristics,2021-05-24,"BACKGROUND: A key factor in the development of viral encephalitis is a virus crossing the blood-brain barrier (BBB). We have previously shown that age-related susceptibility of mice to the La Crosse virus (LACV), the leading cause of pediatric arbovirus encephalitis in the USA, was associated with the ability of the virus to cross the BBB. LACV infection in weanling mice (aged around 3 weeks) results in vascular leakage in the olfactory bulb/tract (OB/OT) region of the brain, which is not observed in adult mice aged > 6–8 weeks. Thus, we studied age-specific differences in the response of brain capillary endothelial cells (BCECs) to LACV infection. METHODS: To examine mechanisms of LACV-induced BBB breakdown and infection of the CNS, we analyzed BCECs directly isolated from weanling and adult mice as well as established a model where these cells were infected in vitro and cultured for a short period to determine susceptibility to virus infection and cell death. Additionally, we utilized correlative light electron microscopy (CLEM) to examine whether changes in cell morphology and function were also observed in BCECs in vivo. RESULTS: BCECs from weanling, but not adult mice, had detectable infection after several days in culture when taken ex vivo from infected mice suggesting that these cells could be infected in vitro. Further analysis of BCECs from uninfected mice, infected in vitro, showed that weanling BCECs were more susceptible to virus infection than adult BCECs, with higher levels of infected cells, released virus as well as cytopathic effects (CPE) and cell death. Although direct LACV infection is not detected in the weanling BCECs, CLEM analysis of brain tissue from weanling mice indicated that LACV infection induced significant cerebrovascular damage which allowed virus-sized particles to enter the brain parenchyma. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that BCECs isolated from adult and weanling mice have differential viral load, infectivity, and susceptibility to LACV. These age-related differences in susceptibility may strongly influence LACV-induced BBB leakage and neurovascular damage allowing virus invasion of the CNS and the development of neurological disease.

The aim of this study was to report a case of PR after a second dose of Oxford-AstraZeneca, the adopted therapy and a brief literature review. A 53-year-old woman, phototype II, presented an erythematous lesion in the posterior right thigh 15 days after the second dose of Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. Eight days after the initial injury, new injuries appeared in the calf, buttocks and thighs. The diagnosis was PR with a 5-week eruption cycle. The treatment consisted of the use of L-Lysine, 3 grams loading dose and 500mg for 30 days and moisturizing/healing lotion, starting 14 days after the herald patch. After the 5th week of the disease cycle, there were no new eruptions and the repair cycle continued for up to 8 weeks leaving some residual skin spots. It is concluded that the patient may be a carrier a latent virus, HHV-6, and the vaccine administration with immune system stimulation, would have activated the possible virus causing PR.

During May 2020, the authors examined intended vaccination in the next 12 months in relationship to demographic variables, healthcare attitudes, and personal COVID-19 experiences for two samples of adults--those who did not receive influenza vaccine during the prior 12 months, and those who did. Methods In May 2020, a cross-sectional online survey was conducted with a national US sample. Participants reported prior influenza vaccination (yes/no during prior 12 months) and anticipated vaccination (yes/no during next 12 months). Covariates included demographic characteristics (e.g., gender, race-ethnicity, political ideology), general beliefs (e.g., benefits of vaccines, altruistic attitudes), and COVID-19 health beliefs and experiences (COVID-19 worry and severity, perception of COVID-19 as a community threat, knowing someone with COVID-19).

Results Among participants (n=3,502), 47% did not receive influenza vaccine in the prior 12 months and 53% had; 25.5% of non-vaccinators and 91.9% of vaccinators intended future vaccination. For non-vaccinators, odds of intending vaccination was associated with race/ethnicity (Hispanics were more likely to intend than white-NH; AOR=1.74; 95%CI=1.23-2.4), greater perceived benefits of vaccination (AOR=2.19;95%CI=1.88-2.54), and perception of COVID-19 as a community threat (AOR=1.91;95%CI=1.49-2.45). For vaccinators, odds of intending vaccination was associated with age (AOR=1.04;95%CI=1.03-1.05), race/ethnicity (Black-NH and Other-NH were less likely to intend than white-NH, AOR=.60;95%CI=.36-.999; and AOR=.45;95%CI=.24-.84, respectively), greater perceived benefits of vaccination (AOR=1.88;95%CI=1.45-2.45) and greater perception of collective benefits of vaccines (AOR=1.48;95%CI=1.15-1.90). Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic may have served as a cue to action for influenza vaccination intention among some prior non-vaccinators whereas intention among prior vaccinators is more related to positive attitudes toward vaccination.","Sturm, Lynne; Kasting, Monica L.; Head, Katharine J.; Hartsock, Jane A.; Zimet, Gregory D.",Vaccine,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X21002711?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.03.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33715898/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X21002711,0
637019,Peripartum considerations and challenges in the management of type IV Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.,2021-07-30,"The misuse of antibiotics combined with a lack of newly developed ones is the main contributors to the current antibiotic resistance crisis. There is a dire need for new and alternative antibacterial options and nanotechnology could be a solution. Metal-based nanoparticles, particularly silver nanoparticles (NAg), have garnered widespread popularity due to their unique physicochemical properties and broad-spectrum antibacterial activity. Consequently, NAg has seen extensive incorporation in many types of products across the healthcare and consumer market. Despite clear evidence of the strong antibacterial efficacy of NAg, studies have raised concerns over the development of silver-resistant bacteria. Resistance to cationic silver (Ag(+)) has been recognised for many years, but it has recently been found that bacterial resistance to NAg is also possible. It is also understood that exposure of bacteria to toxic heavy metals like silver can induce the emergence of antibiotic resistance through the process of co-selection. Acinetobacter baumannii is a Gram-negative coccobacillus and opportunistic nosocomial bacterial pathogen. It was recently listed as the “number one” critical level priority pathogen because of the significant rise of antibiotic resistance in this species. NAg has proven bactericidal activity towards A. baumannii, even against strains that display multi-drug resistance. However, despite ample evidence of heavy metal (including silver; Ag(+)) resistance in this bacterium, combined with reports of heavy metal-driven co-selection of antibiotic resistance, little research has been dedicated to assessing the potential for NAg resistance development in A. baumannii. This is worrisome, as the increasingly indiscriminate use of NAg could promote the development of silver resistance in this species, like what has occurred with antibiotics.","McNeilly, Oliver; Mann, Riti; Hamidian, Mohammad; Gunawan, Cindy",Front Microbiol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2021.652863; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33936010/,0

Both viruses are simultaneously detected in clinical cases, but a study involving the co-infection has not been reported. The study was therefore conducted to investigate the disease severity following a co-infection with PEDV and PDCoV. In the study, 4-day-old pigs were orally inoculated with PEDV and PDCoV, either alone or in combination. Following challenge, fecal score was monitored on a daily basis. Fecal swabs were collected and assayed for the presence of viruses. Three pigs per group were necropsied at 3 and 5 days post inoculation (dpi). Microscopic lesions and villous height to crypt depth (VH:CD) ratio, together with the presence of PEDV and PDCoV antigens, were evaluated in small intestinal tissues. Expressions of interferon alpha (IFN-α) and interleukin 12 (IL12) were investigated in small intestinal mucosa. The findings indicated that coinoculation increased the disease severity, demonstrated by significantly prolonged fecal score and virus shedding and decreasing VH:CD ratio in the jejunum compared with pigs inoculated with either PEDV or PDCoV alone. Notably, in single-inoculated groups, PEDV and PDCoV antigens were detected only in villous enterocytes wile in the coinoculated group, PDCoV antigen was detected in both villous enterocytes and crypts. IFN-α and IL12 were significantly up-regulated in coinoculated groups in comparison with single-inoculated groups. In conclusion, co-infection with PEDV and PDCoV exacerbate clinical signs and have a synergetic on the regulatory effect inflammatory cytokines compared to a single infection with either virus.","Saeng-chuto, Kepalee; Madapong, Adthakorn; Kaeoket, Kampon; Piñeyro, Pablo Enrique; Tantituvanont, Angkana; Nilubol, Dachrit",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33542409/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-82738-8,0

METHOD: This was a cross-sectional study with snowball sampling. The sample came to 1014 Spanish adults (67.2% women and 32.8% men). The Perception of Threat from COVID-19 questionnaire, the Affective Balance Scale and the Mood Evaluation Scale were used. RESULTS: The results showed that the perception of threat from COVID-19 was related positively to negative affect and emotional signs, that is, sadness-depression, anxiety and anger-hostility. There was a direct positive effect of perceived threat from COVID-19 on sadness-depression, anxiety and anger-hostility moods, while anxiety and anger-hostility had a direct positive effect on perception of threat from the virus. Thus, there was a circular relationship, in which perceived threat influenced the presence of negative mood, and negative mood, in turn, linked to emotions of irritation and agitation from a present situation, promoted the feeling of threat. CONCLUSIONS: A negative affective balance increases both one’s perception of threat from COVID-19 and negative mood. Thus, knowing the emotional and cognitive effects on the population would enable measures to be put into service to facilitate their effective coping.","Pérez-Fuentes, María del Carmen; Molero Jurado, María del Mar; Martos Martínez, África; Gázquez Linares, Jose Jesús",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0235305; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32584897/,0

641761,Values and preferences for hepatitis C self-testing among people who inject drugs in Kyrgyzstan,2021-06-26,"Initial phase of COVID-19 infection is associated with the binding of viral spike protein S1 receptor binding domain (RBD) with the host cell surface receptor, ACE2. Peptide inhibitors typically interact with spike proteins in order to block its interaction with ACE2, and this knowledge would promote the use of such peptides as therapeutic scaffolds. The present study examined the competitive inhibitor activity of a broad spectrum antimicrobial peptide, Dermaseptin-S4 (S4) and its analogues. Three structural S4 analogues viz., S4 (K(4)), S4 (K(20)) and S4 (K(4)K(20)) were modelled by substituting charged lysine for non-polar residues in S4 and subsequently, docked with S1. Further, the comparative analysis of inter-residue contacts and non-covalent intermolecular interactions among S1–S4 (K(4)), S1–S4 (K(4)K(20)) and S1–ACE2 complexes were carried out to explore their mode of binding with S1. Interestingly, S1–S4 (K(4)) established more inter-molecular interactions compared to S4 (K(4)K(20)) and S1–ACE2. In order to substantiate this study, the normal mode analysis (NMA) was conducted to show how the structural stability of the flexible loop region in S1 is affected by atomic displacements in unbound S1 and docked complexes. Markedly, the strong interactions consistently maintained by S1–S4 (K(4)) complex revealed their conformational transition over the harmonic motion period. Moreover, S1–S4 (K(4)) peptide complex showed a higher energy deformation profile compared to S1–S4 (K(4)K(20)), where the higher energy deformation suggests the rigidity of the docked complex and thus it’s harder deformability, which is also substantiated by molecular dynamics simulation. In conclusion, S1–S4 (K(4)) complex has definitely exhibited a functionally significant dynamics compared to S1–ACE2 complex; this peptide inhibitor, S4 (K(4)) will need to be considered as the best therapeutic scaffold to block SARS-CoV-2 infection.

642122,Human Coronavirus and Acute Respiratory Illness in Older Adults with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease,2009-03-15,"SARS-CoV-2 exploits angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor to invade cells. It has been reported that the UK and South African strains may have higher transmission capabilities, eventually due to amino acid substitutions on the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. The pathogenicity seems modified but is still under investigation. Here we used the experimental structure of the Spike RBD domain co-crystallized with part of the ACE2 receptor and several in silico methods to analyze the possible impacts of three amino acid replacements (Spike K417N, E484K, N501Y) with regard to ACE2 binding. We found that the N501Y replacement in this region of the interface (present in both UK and South African strains) should be favorable for the interaction with ACE2 while the K417N and E484K substitutions (South African) would seem unfavorable. It is unclear if the N501Y substitution in the South African strain could counterbalance the predicted less favorable (regarding binding) K417N and E484K Spike replacements. Our finding suggests that, if indeed the South African strain has a high transmission level, this could be due to the N501Y replacement and/or to substitutions in regions outside the direct Spike-ACE2 interface. Hihglights Transmission of the UK and possibly South African SARS-CoV-2 strains appears substantially increased compared to other variants This could be due, in part, to increased affinity between the variant Spike proteins and ACE2 We investigated in silico the 3D structure of the Spike-ACE2 complex with a focus on Spike K417N, E484K and N501Y The N501Y substitution is predicted to increase the affinity toward ACE2 (UK strain) with subsequent enhanced transmissibility and possibly pathogenicity Additional substitutions at positions 417 and 484 (South African strain) may pertub the interaction with ACE2 raising questions about transmissibility and pathogenicity","Villoutreix, Bruno O.; Calvez, Vincent; Marcelin, Anne-Genevieve; Khatib, Abdel-Majid",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.24.427939,0
643106,Long COVID or post COVID-19 syndrome,2021-09-17,"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) virus (PRRSV) infections are characterized by prolonged viremia and viral shedding consistent with incomplete immunity. Type I interferons (IFN) are essential for mounting efficient antiviral innate and adaptive immune responses, but in a recent study, North American PRRSV genotype 2 isolates did not induce, or even strongly inhibited, IFN-α in plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC), representing “professional IFN-α-producing cells”. Since inhibition of IFN-α expression might initiate PRRSV pathogenesis, we further characterized PRRSV effects and host modifying factors on IFN-α responses of pDC. Surprisingly, a variety of type 1 and type 2 PRRSV directly stimulated IFN-α secretion by pDC. The effect did not require live virus and was mediated through the TLR7 pathway. Furthermore, both IFN-γ and IL-4 significantly enhanced the pDC production of IFN-α in response to PRRSV exposure. PRRSV inhibition of IFN-α responses from enriched pDC stimulated by CpG oligodeoxynucleotides was weak or absent. VR-2332, the prototype genotype 2 PRRSV, only suppressed the responses by 34%, and the highest level of suppression (51%) was induced by a Chinese highly pathogenic PRRSV isolate. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that pDC respond to PRRSV and suggest that suppressive activities on pDC, if any, are moderate and strain-dependent. Thus, pDC may be a source of systemic IFN-α responses reported in PRRSV-infected animals, further contributing to the puzzling immunopathogenesis of PRRS.","Baumann, Arnaud; Mateu, Enric; Murtaugh, Michael P; Summerfield, Artur",Vet Res,https://doi.org/10.1186/1297-9716-44-33; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23675981/,0

The complexity of COVID-19 such as the potential mutations of the virus leading to antigenic drift and the uncertainty on the duration of the immunity induced by the vaccine have hampered the efforts to control the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, we suggest an alternative interim treatment strategy based on biological response modifier glucans such as the Aureobasidium pullulans AFO-202-derived β-glucan, which has been reported to induce trained immunity, akin to that induced by the Bacille Calmette-Guérin vaccine, by epigenetic modifications at the central level in the bone marrow. These β-glucans act as pathogen-associated molecular patterns, activating mucosal immunity by binding with specific pathogen recognition receptors such as dectin-1 and inducing both the adaptive and innate immunity by reaching distant lymphoid organs. β-Glucans have also been used as immune adjuvants for vaccines such as the influenza vaccine. Therefore, until a conventional vaccine is widely available, an orally consumable vaccine adjuvant that acts like biosimilars, termed as the wide-spectrum immune-balancing food-supplement-based enteric (β-WIFE) vaccine adjuvant approach, with well-reported safety is worth in-depth investigation and can be considered for a clinical trial.","Ikewaki, Nobunao; Iwasaki, Masaru; Kurosawa, Gene; Rao, Kosagi-Sharaf; Lakey-Beitia, Johant; Preethy, Senthilkumar; Abraham, Samuel JK",Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,https://doi.org/10.1080/21645515.2021.1880210; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33651967/,0

Although 61,888 confirmed cases had been reported in Brazil by 28 April 2020, little was known about the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in the country. To better understand the recent epidemic in the second most populous state in southeast Brazil (Minas Gerais, MG), we looked at existing epidemiological data from 3 states and sequenced 40 complete genomes from MG cases using Nanopore. We found evidence of multiple independent introductions from outside MG, both from genome analyses and the overly dispersed distribution of reported cases and deaths. Epidemiological estimates of the reproductive number using different data sources and theoretical assumptions all suggest a reduction in transmission potential since the first reported case, but potential for sustained transmission in the near future. The estimated date of introduction in Brazil was consistent with epidemiological data from the first case of a returning-traveler from Lombardia, Italy. These findings highlight the unique reality of MGs epidemic and reinforce the need for real-time and continued genomic surveillance strategies as a way of understanding and therefore preparing against the epidemic spread of emerging viral pathogens.","Xavier, J.; Giovanetti, M.; Adelino, T.; Fonseca, V.; Vitor Barbosa da Costa, A.; Aparecida Ribeiro, A.; Nascimento Felicio, K.; Guerra Duarte, C.; Vinicius Ferreira Silva, M.; Salgado, A.; Teixeira Lima, M.; de Jesus, R.; Fabri, A.; Franco Soares Zoboli, C.; Gutemberg Souza Santos, T.; Iani, F.; Maria Bispo de Filippis, A.; Agudo Mendonca Teixeira de Siqueira, M.; Luiz de Abreu, A.; de Azevedo, V.; Brock Ramalho, D.; F.

Parents of children aged 5 to 9 years from Western Australia were eligible to participate and recruited through convenience sampling. An online survey instrument that included validated measures of their children’s physical activity (unstructured, organized, home-based, indoor/outdoor active play, dog play/walking), sociodemographic, and other potential confounders was administered to parents. Paired t-tests and mixed ANOVA models assessed changes in physical activity outcomes. The analytic sample comprised parents of 157 children who were 6.9 years of age (SD = 1.7) on average. Overall, weekly minutes of total physical activity (PA) did not change from before to during COVID-19. However, frequency and duration (total and home-based) of unstructured physical activity significantly increased. Outdoor play in the yard or street around the house, outdoor play in the park or playground or outdoor recreation area, and active indoor play at home all significantly increased. Frequency and total duration of organised physical activity significantly declined during COVID-19 distancing. During Western Australian COVID-19 restrictions, there was an increase in young children’s unstructured physical activity and outdoor play and a decrease in organised physical activity.

This study evaluated the efficacy of Emotional Freedom Techniques (EFT) on self-reported CRCI (sr-CRCI). METHODS: In this prospective multicentre randomised wait-list controlled study (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02771028), eligible cancer survivors had completed curative treatment, were 18 years or older and screened positive for sr-CRCI with ≥ 43 on the Cognitive Failures Questionnaire (CFQ). Participants were randomised to the immediate treatment group (ITG) or wait-list control (WLC) group, based on age (< or ≥ 65 years), gender, treatment (chemotherapy or not), and centre. The ITG started to apply EFT after inclusion and performed this for 16 weeks. The WLC group could only start the application of EFT after 8 weeks of waiting. Evaluations took place at baseline (T0), 8 weeks (T1) and 16 weeks (T2). The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with sr-CRCI according to the CFQ score. FINDINGS: Between October 2016 and March 2020, 121 patients were recruited with CFQ ≥ 43 indicating sr-CRCI. At T1, the number of patients scoring positive on the CFQ was significantly reduced in the ITG compared to the WLC group (40.8% vs. 87.3% respectively; p<0.01). For the WLC group, a reduction in CFQ scores was observed at T2, comparable to the effect of the ITG at T1. Linear mixed model analyses indicated a statistically significant reduction in the CFQ score, distress, depressive symptoms, fatigue and also an improvement in quality of life. INTERPRETATION: This study provides evidence for the application of EFT for sr-CRCI in cancer survivors and suggests that EFT may be useful for other symptoms in cancer survivors.","Tack, Laura; Lefebvre, Tessa; Lycke, Michelle; Langenaeken, Chistine; Fontaine, Christel; Borms, Marleen; Hanssens, Marianne; Knops, Christel; Meryck, Kathleen; Boterberg, Tom; Pottel, Hans; Schofield, Patricia; Debruyne, Philip R.",EClinicalMedicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34466793/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eclinm.2021.101081,0

The collections were performed on 39 farms, belonging to 29 municipalities located in eight states of Brazil. It was possible to conclude that the prevalence of Coronavirus, Rotavirus, Cryptosporidium spp., Eimeria spp., and nematodes was 7.20% (95% CI 4.54–9.78), 6.37% (95% CI 3.85–8.89), 51.52% (95% CI 45.26–55.57), 3.46% (95% CI 2.24–4.67), and 3.46% (95% CI 2.24–4.67), respectively. Ages with higher probabilities of occurrence of these diseases in calves were < 10, > 8, > 6, > 37, and > 36 days, respectively.

Sera from four groups were tested for antibodies to Vesivirus as follows: blood donors whose units were cleared for donation, blood donors whose units were not accepted for donation solely because of elevated blood liver alanine aminotransferase (ALT) concentrations, patients with clinical hepatitis of unknown but suspected infectious cause, and patients with clinical hepatitis of unknown cause but associated with blood transfusion or dialysis. Additionally, sera were tested for Vesivirus genome by three methods: dot‐blot and two reverse transcription‐polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR) methods. The calculated seroprevalence against Vesivirus virions within these groups (N = 765) was 12%, 21%, 29%, and 47%, respectively (P < 0.001 for group differences). Additionally, 11 (9.8%) of 112 sera tested yielded RT‐PCR amplicons that by nucleotide sequence were distinct from each other and related to known Vesivirus.

648983,Severe SARS-CoV-2 Infection in a Pediatric Patient Requiring Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation,2020-10-09,"The 2020 annual Congress of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) was the first ever to be held virtually. Under the spotlight of ‘the cutting edge of cardiology’, exciting and ground-breaking cardiovascular (CV) science was presented both in basic and clinical research. This commentary summarizes essential updates from ESC 2020—The Digital Experience. Despite the challenges that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has posed on the conduct of clinical trials, the ESC Congress launched the results of major studies bringing innovation to the field of general cardiology, cardiac surgery, heart failure, interventional cardiology, and atrial fibrillation. In addition to three new ESC guidelines updates, the first ESC Guidelines on Sports Cardiology and Exercise in Patients with Cardiovascular Disease were presented. As former ESC president, Professor Casadei undoubtedly pointed out the ESC Congress 2020 was a great success. During the ESC 2020 Congress, BMC Cardiovascular Disorders updated to seven journal sections including Arrhythmias and Electrophysiology, CV Surgery, Coronary Artery Disease, Epidemiology and Digital health, Hypertension and Vascular biology, Primary prevention and CV Risk, and Structural Diseases, Heart Failure, and Congenital Disorders. To conclude, an important take-home message for all CV health care professionals engaged in the COVID-19 pandemic is that we must foresee and be prepared to tackle the dramatic, long-term CV complications of COVID-19 patients.","Gallego-Colon, Enrique; Bonaventura, Aldo; Vecchié, Alessandra; Cannatà, Antonio; Fitzpatrick, Ciarán Martin",BMC Cardiovasc Disord,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33070781/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12872-020-01734-4,0
649173,Viral Loads and Duration of Viral Shedding in Adult Patients Hospitalized with Influenza,2009-08-01,"AIM: There is a lack of an overview of the factors associated with postacute COVID‐19 musculoskeletal symptoms. The aims of this study were as follows: 1‐ to evaluate the most frequent admission symptoms and the frequency of musculoskeletal symptoms in postacute COVID‐19 patients; and 2‐ to determine the related factors with the postacute COVID‐19 musculoskeletal symptoms. METHODS: A total of 280 postacute COVID‐19 patients (183 females, 97 males) were enrolled and divided into two groups: 1‐ patients whose musculoskeletal symptoms initiated with or were aggravated by COVID‐19 (n = 240); and 2‐ patients whose musculoskeletal symptoms did not change with COVID‐19 (n = 40). The variables were demographic and treatment data, symptoms on admission, postacute COVID‐19 symptoms, laboratory results (complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C‐reactive protein, ferritin and d‐dimer), chest computed tomography findings and symptoms during acute COVID‐19. RESULTS: Most of the patients have fatigue (71.8%), spine pain (70.7%) and myalgia (60.7%). The most common pain region was the back (30.4%). The frequency of dyspnoea was 30%, cough 18.5% and chest pain 10.7%. Having any chronic disease (P = .031), the duration of hospital stay (P = .016), frequency of back pain during acute COVID‐19 (P = .018), tomography findings and d‐dimer (P = .035) levels were significantly higher, and lymphocyte (P = .024) levels were significantly lower in the patients whose symptoms began with or were aggravated by COVID‐19. CONCLUSION: Back pain was the most frequent symptom on admission. The most common postacute COVID‐19 musculoskeletal symptoms were fatigue, spine pain and myalgia. Lower lymphocyte and higher d‐dimer levels, the presence of COVID‐19 findings in tomography and back pain during acute COVID‐19 infection, higher duration of hospital stay and having chronic diseases were related to post‐COVID‐19 musculoskeletal symptoms.","Bakılan, Fulya; Gökmen, İsmail Güneş; Ortanca, Burcu; Uçan, Anıl; Eker Güvenç, Şebnem; Şahin Mutlu, Fezan; Gökmen, Hatice Merve; Ekim, Ayşe",Int J Clin Pract,https://doi.org/10.1111/ijcp.14734; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34387911/,0
649218,Dynamic change process of target genes by RT-PCR testing of SARS-Cov-2 during the course of a Coronavirus Disease 2019 patient,2020-03-27,"PURPOSE: To investigate university students’ willingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine when it becomes available to them. METHOD: A multi-methods approach was used—online convenience sample surveys and semi-structured interviews—of young adults attending a large Canadian public university. Two survey samples were collected (June 20-July 28, 2020 and September 22-October 17, 2020). Semi-structured interviews were conducted following each survey, interviewing 20 students in each round. RESULTS: In June 77.8% of surveyed students (n = 483) were willing to get the COVID-19 vaccine; in September 79.6% were willing (n = 1269). Multinomial and binary logistic regression analyses found that increasing perception of the severity of COVID-19 predicted the likelihood that a respondent was willing to get the COVID-19 vaccine in both surveys. In the latter survey students who indicated they would be encouraged to get the COVID-19 vaccine if their doctor/pharmacist recommended it were 76 times more likely to be willing to get the vaccine than those who would not be encouraged by medical advice. Interviews revealed concerns about the speed of the vaccine roll out, safety, and efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of university students intend to get the COVID-19 vaccine, but there are nuanced concerns about efficacy and safety that must be taken into account by public health authorities as the vaccine becomes available to this group. Ensuring that family doctors, pharmacists, and other front-line healthcare workers have consistent and clear information regarding the benefits of vaccination will be critical to encouraging uptake among young adults.","Mant, Madeleine; Aslemand, Asal; Prine, Andrew; Jaagumägi Holland, Alyson",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0255447; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34343202/,0
650509,Time series analysis of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in mainland China by using an XGBoost forecasting model,2021-08-19,"Complement system hyperactivation has been proposed as a potential driver of adverse outcomes in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infected patients, given prior research of complement deposits found in tissue and blood samples, as well as evidence of clinical improvement with anticomplement therapy. Its role in augmenting thrombotic microangiopathy mediated organ damage has also been implicated in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19). This study aimed to examine associations between complement parameters and progression to severe COVID‐19 illness, as well as correlations with other systems. Blood samples of COVID‐19 patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) were analyzed for a wide panel of complement and inflammatory biomarkers. The primary outcome was COVID‐19 severity at index ED visit, while the secondary outcome was peak disease severity over the course of illness. Fifty‐two COVID‐19 patients were enrolled. C3a (p = 0.018), C3a/C3 ratio (p = 0.002), and sC5b‐9/C3 ratio (p = 0.021) were significantly elevated in with severe disease at ED presentation. Over the course of illness, C3a (p = 0.028) and C3a/C3 ratio (p = 0.003) were highest in the moderate severity group. In multivariate regression controlled for confounders, complement hyperactivation failed to predict progression to severe disease. C3a, C3a/C3 ratio, and sC5b‐9/C3 ratio were correlated positively with numerous inflammatory biomarkers, fibrinogen, and VWF:Ag, and negatively with plasminogen and ADAMTS13 activity. We found evidence of complement hyperactivation in COVID‐19, associated with hyperinflammation and thrombotic microangiopathy. Complement inhibition should be further investigated for potential benefit in patients displaying a hyperinflammatory and microangiopathic phenotype.","Henry, Brandon Michael; Szergyuk, Ivan; de Oliveira, Maria Helena Santos; Lippi, Giuseppe; Benoit, Justin L.; Vikse, Jens; Benoit, Stefanie W.",J Med Virol,https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.27077; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33974276/,0
650947,"""COVID Toes"" in Three Siblings",2021,"OBJECTIVES: Although healthcare workers (HCWs) have been particularly affected by SARS-CoV-2, detailed data remain scarce. In this study, we investigated infection rates, clinical characteristics, occupational exposure and household transmission among all symptomatic HCWs screened by SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR between 17 March (French lockdown) and 20 April. METHODS: SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR was proposed to symptomatic (new cough or dyspnoea) HCWs at Creteil Hospital in one of the Parisian suburbs most severely affected by COVID-19. Data on occupational profile, living situation and household, together with self–isolation and mask use at home were collected, as well as the number of cases in the household. RESULTS: The incidence rate of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 was estimated to be 5% (110/2188). A total of 110 (35%) of the 314 HCWs tested positive and 9 (8%) were hospitalised. On multivariate analysis, factors independently associated with positive RT-PCR were occupational profile with direct patient facing (OR 3.1, 95% CI 1.1 to 8.8), p<0.03), and presence of anosmia (OR 5.7, 95% CI 3.1 to 10.6), p<0.0001). Being a current smoker was associated with negative RT-PCR (OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.1 to 0.7), p=0.005). Transmission from HCWs to household members was reported in 9 (14%) cases, and 2 deaths occurred. Overall, self-isolation was possible in 52% of cases, but only 31% of HCWs were able to wear a mask at home. CONCLUSION: This is the first study to report infection rates among HCWs during the peak of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in France and the lockdown period, highlighting the risk related to occupational profile and household transmission.","Krastinova, Evguenia; Garrait, Valérie; Lecam, Marie-Thérèse; Coste, André; Varon, Emmanuelle; Delacroix, Isabelle; Si Ali, Amine; Jung, Camille; Smati, Mounira; Cherbit, Muriel; Maître, Bernard; Pairon, Jean-Claude; Andujar, Pascal",Occup Environ Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33277384/; https://doi.org/10.1136/oemed-2020-106866,0

Importantly, one of the main sources of insight into dreaming activity are the (oral or written) reports provided by dreamers upon awakening from their sleep. Classically, two main types of information are commonly extracted from dream reports: structural and semantic, content-related information. Extracted structural information is typically limited to the simple count of words or sentences in a report. Instead, content analysis usually relies on quantitative scores assigned by two or more (blind) human operators through the use of predefined coding systems. Within this review, we will show that methods borrowed from the field of linguistic analysis, such as graph analysis, dictionary-based content analysis, and distributional semantics approaches, could be used to complement and, in many cases, replace classical measures and scales for the quantitative structural and semantic assessment of dream reports. Importantly, these methods allow the direct (operator-independent) extraction of quantitative information from language data, hence enabling a fully objective and reproducible analysis of conscious experiences occurring during human sleep. Most importantly, these approaches can be partially or fully automatized and may thus be easily applied to the analysis of large datasets.","Elce, Valentina; Handjaras, Giacomo; Bernardi, Giulio",Clocks Sleep,https://doi.org/10.3390/clockssleep3030035; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34563057/,0

The dynamics of vascular damage, and whether it is a direct consequence of endothelial infection or an indirect consequence of an immune cell‐mediated cytokine storm remain unknown. Using a vascularized lung‐on‐chip model, we find that infection of alveolar epithelial cells leads to limited apical release of virions, consistent with reports of monoculture infection. However, viral RNA and proteins are rapidly detected in underlying endothelial cells, which are themselves refractory to apical infection in monocultures. Although endothelial infection is unproductive, it leads to the formation of cell clusters with low CD31 expression, a progressive loss of barrier integrity and a pro‐coagulatory microenvironment. Viral RNA persists in individual cells generating an inflammatory response, which is transient in epithelial cells but persistent in endothelial cells and typified by IL‐6 secretion even in the absence of immune cells. Inhibition of IL‐6 signalling with tocilizumab reduces but does not prevent loss of barrier integrity. SARS‐CoV‐2‐mediated endothelial cell damage thus occurs independently of cytokine storm.","Thacker, Vivek V; Sharma, Kunal; Dhar, Neeraj; Mancini, Gian‐Filippo; Sordet‐Dessimoz, Jessica; McKinney, John D",EMBO Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33908688/; https://doi.org/10.15252/embr.202152744,0

We present a literature review on the extent to which research in this field has developed over the years, and reveal gaps in gender-sensitive awareness between the clinical portrayal and the translation into gender-specific treatment regimens, guidelines and into gender-oriented preventive strategies and health policies. Subsequently, through the lens of gender, we describe these domains in detail for four selected medical conditions: Asthma, obesity and overweight, chronic kidney disease and coronavirus disease 2019. As some of the key gender differences become more apparent during adolescence, we focus on this developmental stage. Finally, we propose a model which is based on three influential issues: (1) Investigating gender-specific medical profiles of related health conditions, rather than a single disease; (2) The dynamics of gender disparities across developmental stages; and (3) An integrative approach which takes into account additional risk factors (ethnicity, socio-demographic variables, minorities, lifestyle habits etc.). Increasing the awareness of gender-specific medicine in daily practice and in tailored guidelines, already among adolescents, may reduce inequities, facilitate the prediction of future trends and properly address the characteristics and needs of certain subpopulations within each gender.","Machluf, Yossy; Chaiter, Yoram; Tal, Orna",World J Clin Cases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32953842/; https://doi.org/10.12998/wjcc.v8.i17.3645,0

Using NVIVO 12, caregiver diaries were coded for (1) “social connection” (n = 23), defined as being able to access or seeking informal or formal social support networks; (2) “isolation” (n = 17), defined as being unable or reluctant to access informal or formal social support networks, or feeling alone; and (3) “bereavement processes” (n = 147), informed by the dual process model of bereavement (restoration and loss-oriented stressors). Content analysis revealed that caregivers were able to connect with others despite physical distancing expectations, expressed loneliness and grief while in isolation, and described moving on in the face of uncertainty. Findings provide insight into how caregivers experienced bereavement during the initial period of the pandemic and highlight implications for hospice bereavement services.","Tay, Djin L.; Thompson, Casidee; Jones, Miranda; Gettens, Caroline; Cloyes, Kristin G.; Reblin, Maija; Thomas Hebdon, Megan C.; Beck, Anna C.; Mooney, Kathleen; Ellington, Lee",J Hosp Palliat Nurs,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33660671/; https://doi.org/10.1097/njh.0000000000000763,0
661251,Infectious disease risk from the Syrian conflict,2013-07-13,"INTRODUCTION: Although most patients recover within several weeks after acute COVID‐19, some of them develop long‐lasting clinical symptoms. Renal transplant recipients have an increased mortality risk from COVID‐19. We aimed to describe complications occurring after COVID‐19 in this group of patients. METHODS: A prospective single‐center cohort study was conducted at University Hospital Centre Zagreb. Patients with two negative reverse transcriptase‐polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR) tests for SARS‐CoV‐2 after COVID‐19 were eligible for further follow‐up at our outpatient clinic. They underwent detailed clinical and laboratory assessments. The primary outcome was the development of complications after COVID‐19. RESULTS: Only 11.53% of renal transplant recipients who survived acute COVID‐19 were symptomless and free from new‐onset laboratory abnormalities during the median follow‐up of 64 days (range: 50–76 days). Three patients died from sepsis after discharge from the hospital. In 47 patients (45.2%), clinical complications were present, while 74 patients (71.2%) had one or more laboratory abnormalities. The most common clinical complications included shortness of breath (19.2%), tiredness (11.5%), peripheral neuropathy (7.7%), self‐reported cognitive impairments (5.7%), and dry cough (7.7%). Most common laboratory abnormalities included shortened activated partial thromboplastin time (50%), elevated D‐dimers (36.5%), elevated fibrinogen (30.16%), and hypogammaglobulinemia (24%). Positive RT‐PCR for cytomegalovirus (8.7%), Epstein–Barr virus (26%), or BK virus (16.3%). Multivariate analysis identified the history of diabetes mellitus and eGFR CKD‐EPI as predictors for the development of post‐COVID clinical complications. Six months after acute COVID‐19, elevated D‐dimers persisted with normalization of other laboratory parameters. Twenty‐nine patients were hospitalized, mostly with several concomitant problems. However, initially reported clinical problems gradually improved in the majority of patients. CONCLUSION: Post‐COVID‐19 clinical and laboratory complications are frequent in the renal transplant population, in some of them associated with significant morbidity. All patients recovered from acute COVID‐19 should undergo long‐term monitoring for evaluation and treatment of complications.","Basic‐Jukic, Nikolina; Juric, Ivana; Furic‐Cunko, Vesna; Katalinic, Lea; Radic, Josipa; Bosnjak, Zrinka; Jelakovic, Bojan; Kastelan, Zeljko",Immun Inflamm Dis,https://doi.org/10.1002/iid3.509; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34414665/,0
662541,Rapid clinical recovery of a SARS-CoV-2 infected common variable immunodeficiency patient following the infusion of COVID-19 convalescent plasma,2021-02-05,"PURPOSE: Chronic pain is common in adolescents. Evidence-based guidelines recommend interdisciplinary treatment, but access is limited by geography. The development of hybrid programs utilizing both face-to-face and videoconference treatment may help overcome this. We developed a 7-week hybrid pediatric interdisciplinary pain program (Hybrid-PIPP) and wished to compare it to individual face-to-face sessions (Standard Care). Our objective was to test the feasibility of a protocol that used a matched pair un-blinded randomized controlled design to investigate the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of the Hybrid-PIPP compared to Standard Care. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Parent–adolescent dyads were recruited from tertiary pediatric clinics and matched by disability before randomization to minimize allocation bias. The adolescents (aged 11–17) had experienced primary pain for >3 months. Hybrid-PIPP involved 11 hrs of group therapy and 4 individual videoconference sessions. Standard care was provided by the same clinical team, using the same treatment model and similar intensity as the Hybrid-PIPP. The intention was to recruit participants for 3 Hybrid-PIPP groups with a comparison stream. Recruitment was ceased after 2 groups due to the high participant disability requiring more intensive intervention. RESULTS: Eighteen dyads were screened and 13 randomized (7 Hybrid-PIPP, 6 Standard Care, 2 unsuitable, 3 unallocated when the study was stopped). The study met a priori feasibility criteria for staff availability; recruitment rate; treatment completion; and data collection. Global satisfaction ratings were similar in both streams (SC median 7, range 5–9 and Hybrid-PIPP median 8.5, range 5–10). Challenges were identified in both streams. A future modified Hybrid-PIPP was considered acceptable if the intensity is increased to manage the high level of disability. Standard care was considered inefficient. No adverse events were reported. CONCLUSION: The study determined that the protocol met a priori feasibility criteria, but to be practicable in a real world, health environment requires significant modifications.

The purpose of this study was to validate the performance of Corona-Score in a cohort of Pakistani patients pursuing care for suspected infection. METHODS: After seeking institution's ethical committee exemption, results of serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, absolute lymphocyte and neutrophil counts, chest x-ray findings and demographics of suspected COVID-19 cases with respiratory symptoms were recouped from electronic medical record. The pre-validated score as proposed by Kurstjens S et al., was calculated. The subjects were divided into SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative on the basis of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) findings. Median and interquartile range (IQR) was calculated for the score in the two groups and the difference was assessed using the independent sample median test. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis was plotted. Statistical analyses were carried out using SPSS 26, with statistical significance set at p value < 0.05. RESULTS: A total of sixty cases, 30 (50%) RT-PCR positive and 30 (50%) negative with a median Corona-Score of 3.5 (IQR: 0–6) and 1.5 (IQR: 0–4) respectively, were evaluated. A p-value of 0.61 showing no statistically significant between group differences was observed. The area under the curve of Corona-Score in our population of patients was 0.59 (95% CI: 0.45–0.74). Using the cut-off values of four originally identified by Kurstjens et al. the model displayed 43.3% sensitivity and 70% specificity with an overall accuracy of 56.67%. CONCLUSION: Corona-Score displayed a lower diagnostic accuracy which may be attributable to the different genetic framework, viral strain and severity of the disease in Pakistanis compared to the population where this score was originally validated. However, large multi-center studies across the country are dire need of time to evaluate the score in overly exhausted health care setup and limited availability of PCR testing.","Ahmed, Sibtain; Naeem Effendi, Muhammad Umer; Ahmed, Zeeshan Ansar; Siddiqui, Imran; Jafri, Lena",Ann Med Surg (Lond),https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2049080121004878; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amsu.2021.102537; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34230853/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2049080121004878?v=s5,0

The protocol covered patient screening, clinic flow, required personal protective equipment and modifications of ophthalmic equipment for improved safety. CONCLUSION: Important literature emerged with respect to the practice of ophthalmology in the era of COVID-19. An evidence-based ophthalmic practice protocol was established and should be modified in the future to accommodate new insights on the COVID-19 pandemic.","Safadi, Khaled; Kruger, Joshua M.; Chowers, Itay; Solomon, Abraham; Amer, Radgonde; Aweidah, Hamzah; Frenkel, Shahar; Mechoulam, Hadas; Anteby, Irene; Ben Eli, Hadas; Lavy, Itay; Jaouni, Tarek; Landau, David; Tiosano, Liran; Greifner, Gabriel; Ofir, Shay; Levi Vineberg, Tamar; Levy, Jaime",BMJ Open Ophthalmol,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjophth-2020-000487; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32432169/,0

667060,"Clinical course and outcomes in patients with asthma hospitalized for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia:a single-center, retrospective study.",2020-08-01,"BACKGROUND: Chronic pain imposes a large burden on individuals and society. A patient-centric digital chronic pain management app called Manage My Pain (MMP) can be used to enhance communication between providers and patients and promote self-management. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the real-world engagement of patients in urban and rural settings in Ontario, Canada with the MMP app alongside their standard of care and assess the impact of its usage on clinical outcomes of pain and related mental health. METHODS: A total of 246 participants with chronic pain at a rural and 2 urban pain clinics were recruited into this prospective, open-label, exploratory study that compared the use of MMP, a digital health app for pain that incorporates validated questionnaires and provides patients with summarized reports of their progress in combination with standard care (app group), against data entered on paper-based questionnaires (nonapp group). Participants completed validated questionnaires on anxiety, depression, pain catastrophizing, satisfaction, and daily opioid consumption up to 4.5 months after the initial visit (short-term follow-up) and between 4.5 and 7 months after the initial visit (long-term follow-up). Engagement and clinical outcomes were compared between participants in the two groups. RESULTS: A total of 73.6% (181/246) of the participants agreed to use the app, with 63.4% (111/175) of them using it for at least one month. Individuals who used the app rated lower anxiety (reduction in Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item questionnaire score by 2.10 points, 95% CI –3.96 to –0.24) at short-term follow-up and had a greater reduction in pain catastrophizing (reduction in Pain Catastrophizing Scale score by 5.23 points, 95% CI –9.55 to –0.91) at long-term follow-up relative to patients with pain who did not engage with the MMP app. CONCLUSIONS: The use of MMP by patients with chronic pain is associated with engagement and improvements in self-reported anxiety and pain catastrophizing. Further research is required to understand factors that impact continued engagement and clinical outcomes in patients with chronic pain.

Quantification of IgA and IgG antibodies in saliva allows studies of the mucosal and systemic immune response after natural infection or vaccination. We developed and validated an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) to detect and quantify salivary IgA and IgG antibodies against the prefusion-stabilized form of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Normalization against total antibody isotype was performed to account for specimen differences, such as collection time and sample volume. Saliva samples collected from 187 SARS-CoV-2 confirmed cases enrolled in 2 cohorts and 373 pre-pandemic saliva samples were tested. The sensitivity of both EIAs was high (IgA: 95.5%; IgG: 89.7%) without compromising specificity (IgA: 99%; IgG: 97%). No cross reactivity with seasonal coronaviruses was observed. The limit of detection for SARS-CoV-2 salivary IgA and IgG assays were 1.98 ng/mL and 0.30 ng/mL, respectively. Salivary IgA and IgG antibodies were detected earlier in patients with mild COVID-19 symptoms than in severe cases. However, severe cases showed higher salivary antibody titers than those with a mild infection. Salivary IgA titers quickly decreased after 6 weeks in mild cases but remained detectable until at least week 10 in severe cases. Salivary IgG titers remained high for all patients, regardless of disease severity. In conclusion, EIAs for both IgA and IgG had high specificity and sensitivity for the confirmation of current or recent SARS-CoV-2 infections and evaluation of the IgA and IgG immune response.","Costantini, Veronica P.; Nguyen, Kenny; Lyski, Zoe; Novosad, Shannon; Bardossy, Ana C.; Lyons, Amanda K.; Gable, Paige; Kutty, Preeta K.; Lutgring, Joseph D.; Brunton, Amanda; Thornburg, Natalie; Brown, Allison C.; McDonald, L.

668009,Empiric Antibiotic Therapy in the Treatment of Community-acquired Pneumonia in a General Hospital in Saudi Arabia,2019,"PURPOSE: To establish if day case superficial parotidectomy is feasible, safe and does not result in excess readmissions. METHOD: A retrospective review was carried out of all patients listed for superficial parotidectomy with day case intent by a single surgeon between January 2016 and December 2019 inclusively. The reasons for failure of same day discharge were established. Postoperative complications and readmissions were recorded. Our approach for a superficial parotidectomy typically includes the use of a 10Fr suction drain which is removed at 4 h postoperatively if the output is less than 30 ml. RESULTS: Ninety-one consecutive superficial parotidectomies listed for day case surgery were eligible for inclusion. Seventeen patients failed to be discharged on the same day and were admitted giving a day case success rate of 81%. Most of these (n = 9) occurred in the first year of adopting day case surgery. The most common reason to admit patients was a late finish (n = 8, 47%). Six patients (25%) were admitted due to anaesthetic complications. One patient had a surgical complication requiring admission. CONCLUSION: Our series demonstrates that day case superficial parotidectomy using a surgical drain is feasible, safe and does not result in an unacceptable readmission rate. In our experience, surgical complications are an uncommon cause for day case failure. The most common cause for day case failure was a late finish. Postoperative complications including bleeding, seroma/salivary collection and facial nerve palsy were in keeping with or better than those quoted in the literature.","Edmond, Mark; Campbell, Elaine; Reddy, Venkat",Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33555439/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00405-021-06642-7,0

668500,Editorial: Transplant infectious disease landscape in the COVID19-Era,2021,"OBJECTIVES: Determine the diagnostic accuracy of two antigen-detecting rapid diagnostic tests (Ag-RDT) for SARS-CoV-2 at the point of care and define individuals’ characteristics providing best performance. METHODS: We performed a prospective, single-center, point of care validation of two Ag-RDT in comparison to RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs. RESULTS: Between October 9(th) and 23(rd), 2020, 1064 participants were enrolled. The Panbio(TM) Covid-19 Ag Rapid Test device (Abbott) was validated in 535 participants, with 106 positive Ag-RDT results out of 124 positive RT-PCR individuals, yielding a sensitivity of 85.5% (95% CI: 78.0–91.2). Specificity was 100.0% (95% CI: 99.1–100) in 411 RT-PCR negative individuals. The Standard Q Ag-RDT (SD Biosensor, Roche) was validated in 529 participants, with 170 positive Ag-RDT results out of 191 positive RT-PCR individuals, yielding a sensitivity of 89.0% (95%CI: 83.7–93.1). One false positive result was obtained in 338 RT-PCR negative individuals, yielding a specificity of 99.7% (95%CI: 98.4–100). For individuals presenting with fever 1–5 days post symptom onset, combined Ag-RDT sensitivity was above 95%. Lower sensitivity of 88.2% was seen on the same day of symptom development (day 0). CONCLUSIONS: We provide an independent validation of two widely available commercial Ag-RDTs, both meeting WHO criteria of ≥80% sensitivity and ≥97% specificity. Although less sensitive than RT-PCR, these assays could be beneficial due to their rapid results, ease of use, and independence from existing laboratory structures.

METHODS Patients aged 18-65 years who were diagnosed with COVID-19 in one of 1,255 general practices in Germany between March 2020 and February 2021 were included in this study. Long-term sick leave was defined as sick leave of at least four weeks. The association between these independent variables and long-term sick leave was studied using an adjusted logistic regression model. RESULTS This study included 30,950 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 (51.7% women, mean [standard deviation] age 41.5 [13.0] years). The prevalence of long-term sick leave was 5.8%. Female sex, older age, and several conditions (i.e., noninfective enteritis and colitis, reaction to severe stress, and adjustment disorders, atopic dermatitis, mononeuropathies, reflux diseases, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension) were positively and significantly associated with long-term sick leave. CONCLUSION Long-term sick leave was relatively rare in COVID-19 patients followed in general practices in Germany. These results should be confirmed or invalidated in other settings and countries.","Jacob, Louis; Koyanagi, Ai; Smith, Lee; Tanislav, Christian; Konrad, Marcel; van der Beck, Susanne; Kostev, Karel",International journal of infectious diseases : IJID : official publication of the International Society for Infectious Diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34224870/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2021.06.063,0

This study describes epidemiological and clinical characteristics of EV infections involved in HFMD and other mucocutaneous symptoms from 2006 to 2020 in Spain. EV-positive samples from 368 patients were included. EV species A were identified in 85.1% of those typed EV. Coxsackievirus (CV) A6 was the prevalent serotype (60.9%), followed by EV-A71 (9.9%) and CVA16 (7.7%). Infections affected children (1–6 years old) mainly, and show seasonality with peaks in spring–summer and autumn. Clinical data indicated few cases of atypical HFMD as well as those with neurological complications (associated with the 2016 EV-A71 outbreak). Phylogenetic analysis of CVA6 VP1 sequences showed different sub-clusters circulating from 2010 to present. In conclusion, HFMD or exanthemas case reporting has increased in Spain in recent years, probably associated with an increase in circulation of CVA6, although they did not seem to show greater severity. However, EV surveillance in mucocutaneous manifestations should be improved to identify the emergence of new types or variants causing outbreaks and more severe pathologies.","Martínez-López, Nieves; Muñoz-Almagro, Carmen; Launes, Cristian; Navascués, Ana; Imaz-Pérez, Manuel; Reina, Jordi; Romero, María Pilar; Calvo, Cristina; Ruiz-García, Montserrat; Megias, Gregoria; Valencia-Ramos, Juan; Otero, Almudena; Cabrerizo, María",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33924875/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v13050781,0

Here I discuss it in the context of engineering systems and biology, where strong emergence takes place due to a combination of upwards emergence and downwards causation (Ellis, Emergence in Solid State Physics and Biology, 2020, arXiv:2004.13591). Firstly, I show that causal closure is strictly limited in terms of spatial interactions because these are cases that are of necessity strongly interacting with the environment. Effective Spatial Closure holds ceteris parabus, and can be violated by Black Swan Events. Secondly, I show that causal closure in the hierarchy of emergence is a strictly interlevel affair, and in the cases of engineering and biology encompasses all levels from the social level to the particle physics level. However Effective Causal Closure can usefully be defined for a restricted set of levels, and one can experimentally determine Effective Theories that hold at each level. This does not however imply those effective theories are causally complete by themselves. In particular, the particle physics level is not causally complete by itself in the contexts of solid state physics (because of interlevel wave–particle duality), digital computers (where algorithms determine outcomes), or biology (because of time dependent constraints). Furthermore Inextricably Intertwined Levels occur in all these contexts.","Ellis, George F. R.",Found Phys,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10701-020-00366-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32836326/,0

Our study focused on the foreign-imported COVID-19 cases to provide detailed data for insights into the prevention, early diagnosis, treatment and control of imported COVID-19. METHODS: For this observational and retrospective study, we investigated the clinical characteristics of imported COVID-19 cases that were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR in the Xi’an Public Health Center from 29 March 2020 to 31 August 2020. RESULTS: Of the 79 patients with COVID-19, 19 (24.1%) had exposure to confirmed COVID-19 patients, 15 (19.0%) had exposure to suspicious COVID-19 patients, and 45 (56.9%) had an unclear history of exposure to confirmed patients. The mean age of the patients was 38 years, and 70 (88.7%) patients were male. Except for 2 severe cases, the remaining 58 (73.4%) cases displayed mild or moderate symptoms, and 19 (24.2%) infected patients were asymptomatic. Twenty-one (26.6%) patients were not diagnosed until a third or later nucleic acid test. Ten (12.7%) patients had chronic diseases. The most common manifestations of the patients were cough [18 (22.8%) cases], fever [9 (11.4%) cases] and sore throat [9 (11.4%) cases]. Forty-one (51.9%) cases showed abnormal chest CT images, To date, all patients have been discharged, and no patient has died. CONCLUSION: The imported COVID-19 cases in Xi’an were mainly young and middle-aged adults with mild or moderate symptoms who had a low rate of comorbidity, showed favourable laboratory and chest CT images, and had a better prognosis.

Clinical presentation, electrocardiography, and cardiac biomarkers seem not to be sufficient for a reliable diagnosis. In fact, an unequivocal myocardial characterization is needed, applying endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR), a technique which demonstrates high accuracy to histology. Besides the assessment of functional parameters (volumes, ejection fraction), established late gadolinium enhancement and recent T1 and T2 mapping techniques including the calculation of extracellular volume fraction allow distinct myocardial tissue analysis by a noninvasive approach without the need of radiation. However, EMB is the only method which allows the identification of the underlying etiology of cardiac inflammation. Since myocardial damage and inflammation seem to be prevalent in a considerable number of patients even in the mid-term range after COVID-19, CMR and EMB seem to be adequate tools to further investigate these findings.

Methods: The population-based retrospective cohort study was conducted in the International Peace Maternity and Child Health Hospital (IPMCH) in Shanghai, China. Pregnant women without COVID-19 received perinatal healthcare during lockdown (from January 24, 2020 to March 24, 2020) and non-lockdown (from January 24, 2019 to March 24, 2019) period and giving birth to a live infant at IPMCH were enrolled. 1:1 propensity score matching and Inverse probability of treatment weighting were used to evaluate preterm birth (<37 weeks), very preterm birth (<34 weeks), preterm birth with premature rupture of membranes (PROM-PTB), spontaneous preterm birth with intact membranes (S-PTB), and medically induced preterm birth (MI-PTB) between two groups. Results: 8,270 pregnant women were in the lockdown group, and 9,815 were in the non-lockdown group. Pregnant women in second trimester during lockdown had a higher risk of PTB than those during the non-lockdown period [OR: 1.43 (CI 1.01–2.02), ARD: 1.7% (CI 0.04–3.4%), p = 0.045]. Furthermore, pregnant women in third trimester during lockdown had a higher risk of PROM-PTB than those during the non-lockdown period [OR: 1.64 (CI 1.09–2.47), ARD: 0.9% (CI 0.2–1.6%), p = 0.02]; no group differences were found related to rates of VPTB, S-PTB or MI-PTB.

Soon after the deadly disease outbreak, the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was identified as a functional cellular receptor in vitro and in vivo for SARS-CoV spike protein. However, ACE2 solely is not sufficient to allow host cells to become susceptible to SARS-CoV infection, and other host factors may be involved in SARS-CoV spike protein-ACE2 complex. RESULTS: A host intracellular filamentous cytoskeletal protein vimentin was identified by immunoprecipitation and LC-MS/MS analysis following chemical cross-linking on Vero E6 cells that were pre-incubated with the SARS-CoV spike protein. Moreover, flow cytometry data demonstrated an increase of the cell surface vimentin level by 16.5 % after SARS-CoV permissive Vero E6 cells were treated with SARS-CoV virus-like particles (VLPs). A direct interaction between SARS-CoV spike protein and host surface vimentin was further confirmed by far-Western blotting. In addition, antibody neutralization assay and shRNA knockdown experiments indicated a vital role of vimentin in cell binding and uptake of SARS-CoV VLPs and the viral spike protein. CONCLUSIONS: A direct interaction between vimentin and SARS-CoV spike protein during viral entry was observed. Vimentin is a putative anti-viral drug target for preventing/reducing the susceptibility to SARS-CoV infection.","Yu, Yvonne Ting-Chun; Chien, Ssu-Chia; Chen, I-Yin; Lai, Chia-Tsen; Tsay, Yeou-Guang; Chang, Shin C.; Chang, Ming-Fu",J Biomed Sci,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12929-016-0234-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26801988/,0

It is appreciated as a tecton for the rational design of new bio-active substances. Herein, we present a short overview of the subject. We analyzed 2366 proline-derived structures deposited in the Cambridge Structure Database, with emphasis on the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. The latter are the first-line antihypertensive and cardiological drugs. Their side effects prompt a search for improved pharmaceuticals. Characterization of tectons (molecular building blocks) and the resulting supramolecular synthons (patterns of intermolecular interactions) involving proline derivatives, as presented in this study, may be useful for in silico molecular docking and macromolecular modeling studies. The DFT, Hirshfeld surface and energy framework methods gave considerable insight into the nature of close inter-contacts and supramolecular topology. Substituents of proline entity are important for the formation and cooperation of synthons. Tectonic subunits contain proline moieties characterized by diverse ionization states: -N and -COOH(-COO(−)), -N(+) and -COOH(-COO(−)), -NH and -COOH(-COO(−)), -NH(+) and -COOH(-COO(−)), and -NH(2)(+) and -COOH(-COO(−)).

Therefore, one of the diagnostic challenges of PCR positive cases is differentiating between acute COVID-19 disease and convalescent phase. Recently, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antigen in serum samples of COVID-19 patients was published [Le Hingrat et al. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 N-antigen in blood during acute COVID-19 provides a sensitive new marker and new testing alternatives, Clinical Microbiology and Infection, 2020]. Our study aimed to characterize the analytical specificity and sensitivity of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Salocor SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Quantitative Assay Kit (Salofa Ltd, Salo, Finland)) for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antigen in serum, and to characterize the kinetics of antigenemia. The evaluation material included a negative serum panel of 155 samples, and 126 serum samples from patients with a PCR-confirmed COVID-19. The specificity of the Salocor SARS-CoV-2 serum N antigen test was 98.0%. In comparison with simultaneous positive PCR from upper respiratory tract (URT) specimens, the test sensitivity was 91.7%. In a serum panel in which the earliest serum sample was collected two days before the collection of positive URT specimen, and the latest 48 days after (median 1 day post URT sample collection), the serum N antigen test sensitivity was 94% within 14 days post onset of symptoms. The antigenemia resolved approximately two weeks after the onset of disease and diagnostic PCR. The combination of simultaneous SARS-CoV-2 antigen and antibody testing appeared to provide useful information for timing of COVID-19.

678548,Protecting the gains of malaria elimination in China,2020-04-24,"BACKGROUND: Immune and inflammatory dysfunction was reported to underpin critical COVID-19(coronavirus disease 2019). We aim to develop a machine learning model that enables accurate prediction of critical COVID-19 using immune-inflammatory features at admission. METHODS: We retrospectively collected 2076 consecutive COVID-19 patients with definite outcomes (discharge or death) between January 27, 2020 and March 30, 2020 from two hospitals in China. Critical illness was defined as admission to intensive care unit, receiving invasive ventilation, or death. Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) was applied for feature selection. Five machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Gradient Boosted Decision Tree (GBDT), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Neural Network (NN) were built in a training dataset, and assessed in an internal validation dataset and an external validation dataset. RESULTS: Six features (procalcitonin, [T + B + NK cell] count, interleukin 6, C reactive protein, interleukin 2 receptor, T-helper lymphocyte/T-suppressor lymphocyte) were finally used for model development. Five models displayed varying but all promising predictive performance. Notably, the ensemble model, SPMCIIP (severity prediction model for COVID-19 by immune-inflammatory parameters), derived from three contributive algorithms (SVM, GBDT, and NN) achieved the best performance with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.991 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.979–1.000) in internal validation cohort and 0.999 (95% CI 0.998–1.000) in external validation cohort to identify patients with critical COVID-19. SPMCIIP could accurately and expeditiously predict the occurrence of critical COVID-19 approximately 20 days in advance. CONCLUSIONS: The developed online prediction model SPMCIIP is hopeful to facilitate intensive monitoring and early intervention of high risk of critical illness in COVID-19 patients.

679542,Insights in the approach of long‐term liver transplant recipients with COVID‐19,2020-07-23,"A global effort is currently undertaken to restrain the COVID-19 pandemic. Host immunity has come out as a determinant for COVID-19 clinical outcome, and several studies investigated the immune profiling of SARS-CoV-2 infected people to properly direct the clinical management of the disease. Thus, lymphopenia, T-cell exhaustion, and the increased levels of inflammatory mediators have been described in COVID-19 patients, in particular in severe cases1. Age represents a key factor in COVID-19 morbidity and mortality2. Understanding age-associated immune signatures of patients is therefore important to identify preventive and therapeutic strategies. In this study, we investigated the immune profile of COVID-19 hospitalized patients identifying a distinctive age-dependent immune signature associated with disease severity. Indeed, defined circulating factors - CXCL8, IL-10, IL-15, IL-27 and TNF- - positively correlate with older age, longer hospitalization, and a more severe form of the disease and may thus represent the leading signature in critical COVID-19 patients.","Angioni, R.; Sanchez-Rodriguez, R.; Munari, F.; Bertoldi, N.; Arcidiacono, D.; Cavinato, S.; Marturano, D.; Cattelan, A.; Viola, A.; Molon, B.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.07.28.20162735v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.28.20162735,0

OBJECTIVES: We aimed to assess: (a) circulating sex steroids levels in a cohort of 286 symptomatic men with laboratory‐confirmed COVID‐19 at hospital admission compared to a cohort of 281 healthy men; and (b) the association between serum testosterone levels (tT), COVID‐19, and clinical outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Demographic, clinical, and hormonal values were collected for all patients. Hypogonadism was defined as tT ≤9.2 nmol/l. The Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) was used to score health‐significant comorbidities. Severe clinical outcomes were defined as patients either transferred to intensive care unit (ICU) or death. Descriptive statistics and multivariable linear and logistic regression models tested the association between clinical and laboratory variables and tT levels. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression models tested the association between tT and severe clinical outcomes. RESULTS: Overall, a significantly lower levels of LH and tT were found in patients with COVID‐19 compared to healthy controls (all p < 0.0001); conversely, healthy controls depicted lower values of circulating E(2) (p < 0.001). Testosterone levels suggestive for hypogonadism were observed in 257 (89.8%) patients at hospital admission. In as many as 243 (85%) cases, hypogonadism was secondary. SARS‐CoV‐2 infection status was independently associated with lower tT levels (p < 0.0001) and greater risk of hypogonadism (p < 0.0001), after accounting for age, BMI, CCI, and IL‐6 values. Lower tT levels were associated with higher risk of ICU admission and death outcomes (all p ≤ 0.05), after accounting for clinical and laboratory parameters. CONCLUSIONS: We unveil an independent association between SARS‐CoV‐2 infection status and secondary hypogonadism already at hospital admission, with lower testosterone levels predicting the most severe clinical outcomes.","Salonia, Andrea; Pontillo, Marina; Capogrosso, Paolo; Gregori, Silvia; Tassara, Michela; Boeri, Luca; Carenzi, Cristina; Abbate, Costantino; Cignoli, Daniele; Ferrara, Anna Maria; Cazzaniga, Walter; Rowe, Isaline; Ramirez, Giuseppe A.; Tresoldi, Cristina; Mushtaq, Junaid; Locatelli, Massimo; Santoleri, Luca; Castagna, Antonella; Zangrillo, Alberto; De Cobelli, Francesco; Tresoldi, Moreno; Landoni, Giovanni; Rovere‐Querini, Patrizia; Ciceri, Fabio; Montorsi, Francesco",Andrology,https://doi.org/10.1111/andr.12993; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33635589/,0

The COVID-19 pandemic has strained patients and nurses and, in turn, may have increased WPV. The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to describe and compare a sample of nurses' reported prevalence of Type II WPV and their reporting of these events during the pandemic. METHODS: Data from an online survey of registered nurses (N = 373) working in hospitals were included. Prevalence was calculated for physical violence and verbal abuse, and their reporting of these events, including the experience of violence between nurses who did and did not care for patients with COVID-19. FINDINGS: Overall, 44.4% and 67.8% of the nurses reported experiencing physical violence and verbal abuse, respectively, between February and May/June 2020. Nurses who provided care for patients with COVID-19 experienced more physical violence (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 2.18, 95% confidence interval [CI] = [1.30, 3.67]) and verbal abuse (aOR = 2.10, 95% CI = [1.22, 3.61]) than nurses who did not care for these patients. One in 10 nurses felt reporting the incident was more difficult during the pandemic. CONCLUSION/APPLICATION TO PRACTICE: A significant proportion of nurses who cared for patients with COVID-19 experienced more physical violence and verbal abuse, and more difficulty in reporting to management. As the pandemic continues, health care organizations need to recognize that workers may be at an elevated risk for experiencing WPV and may be less likely to report, resulting in an urgent need for prevention efforts on their part.","Byon, Ha Do; Sagherian, Knar; Kim, Yeonsu; Lipscomb, Jane; Crandall, Mary; Steege, Linsey",Workplace Health Saf,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34344236/; https://doi.org/10.1177/21650799211031233,0
684212,Estimating the nationwide transmission risk of measles in US schools and impacts of vaccination and supplemental infection control strategies,2020-07-11,"The SARS-CoV-2, a positive-sense single-stranded RNA Coronavirus, is a global threat to human health. Thus, understanding its life cycle mechanistically would be important to facilitate the design of antiviral drugs. A key aspect of viral progression is the synthesis of viral proteins by the ribosome of the human host. In Coronaviruses, this process is regulated by the viral 5ʹ and 3ʹ untranslated regions (UTRs), but the precise regulatory mechanism has not yet been well understood. In particular, the 5ʹ-UTR of the viral genome is most likely involved in translation initiation of viral proteins. Here, we performed inline probing and RNase V1 probing to establish a model of the secondary structure of SARS-CoV-2 5ʹ-UTR. We found that the 5ʹ-UTR contains stable structures including a very stable four-way junction close to the AUG start codon. Sequence alignment analysis of SARS-CoV-2 variants 5ʹ-UTRs revealed a highly conserved structure with few co-variations that confirmed our secondary structure model based on probing experiments.","Miao, Zhichao; Tidu, Antonin; Eriani, Gilbert; Martin, Franck",RNA biology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32965173/; https://doi.org/10.1080/15476286.2020.1814556,0

686619,"Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) cases are not random: explaining trend, low- and high-frequency oscillations based on the Austrian TBE time series",2020-06-26,"BACKGROUND: Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a potentially fatal complication after arthroplasty. Numerous prophylactic strategies and studies to reduce VTEs have focused on the duration of the hospital stay and on few extramural hospitals. This study aimed to investigate extramural hospital management of VTE after total hip/knee arthroplasty (THA/TKA) in China with a novel survey tool. METHODS: A total of 180 patients undergoing arthroplasty, including 68 THA patients and 112 TKA patients, were enrolled in this study. All patients received anticoagulant treatment management. A survey querying VTE management and adherence, such as therapy information, understanding of anticoagulation, satisfaction with the ability of medical staff, and satisfaction with health care costs, was administered by a questionnaire (TKA/THA Patients’ Experience with Anticoagulation in the Post-discharge Period) for quality improvement. RESULTS: The average age of the patients was 65.27 ± 13.62 years. All patients knew their follow-up times. 85 % of them were suggested that re-examine at the next 14 days, and the others at the next 28 days. All patients continued to visit the orthopaedic clinic after discharge without choosing other types of outpatient services, such as an anticoagulant clinic or home visit with a nurse/pharmacist or remote evaluation by telephone. A total of 96.6 % of all patients used new oral anticoagulants, and the most common treatment duration was 2–4 weeks (93.3 %). 48 % informed their physicians that they were taking anticoagulation medications when they visited ophthalmology, dentistry, dermatology, and other departments. The overall rate of satisfaction with anticoagulation management was 81.67 %, and 6.67 % of patients were not unsatisfied with their medical expenses. Patient compliance decreased with increasing follow-up time. Continuous follow-ups after discharge significantly improved patient compliance. CONCLUSIONS: These results elucidate how we can improve the quality of anticoagulation. Continuous follow-up appointments for 30 days after discharge, especially for individuals over 65 years old, significantly improved patient satisfaction and reduced the incidence of VTE and medical costs.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. PARTICIPANTS: Patients previously implanted with a telemetric IOP sensor (Eyemate; Implandata GmbH) were included. METHODS: Intraocular pressure measurements acquired by the patients during the lockdown were collected by physicians who were located remotely. A questionnaire was sent to 10 participating study centers to evaluate the clinical impact of remote monitoring of IOP via the IOP sensor system. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Number of patients who obtained home IOP measurements. RESULTS: Data were available from all centers and from 37 eyes of 37 patients (16 patients with a sulcus-based sensor and 21 patients with a suprachoroidal sensor). Thirty-four patients obtained IOP measurements during the lockdown. Mean age of the patients was 69.3 ± 9.6 years, and 48.6% were women. A total of 8415 IOP measurements from 370 measurement days were obtained. Based on remote IOP measurements, treatment was changed in 5 patients. In another 5 patients, treatment change was considered when physicians received the IOP measurements after the lockdown. Nine of the 10 study centers judged remote IOP measurements to have a clinical impact. CONCLUSIONS: These results show the feasibility of patient-acquired measurement of IOP in conjunction with remote IOP monitoring by physicians with an implantable sensor. The data obtained impacted clinical decision making, including adjustment of ocular hypotensive therapy and avoiding unnecessary office visits during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Mansouri, Kaweh; Kersten-Gomez, Inga; Hoffmann, Esther M.; Szurman, Peter; Choritz, Lars; Weinreb, Robert N.",Ophthalmol Glaucoma,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589419620303264; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ogla.2020.12.008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33358988/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2589419620303264,0

STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. METHODS: This quantitative research was undertaken by means of an online survey instrument, with questions on participants’ behaviour towards COVID-19 and their belief with respect to susceptibility, barriers, benefits, cues to actions and self-efficacy. RESULTS: In total, 405 participants completed the survey. Participants had a low mean COVID-19 perceived susceptibility and perceived severity. Significant differences in susceptibility were observed among different age groups, places of residence and educational levels. A significant difference in self-efficacy was found between people living in urban and rural areas. Participants aged <39 years showed a significantly lower perceived benefit of staying at home to avoid COVID-19 infection compared with those aged 39–54 years. Multiple linear regression modelling revealed that participants aged 39–65 years and those who were single were the most concerned about the risk of COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study provide the basis for evidence-based health education programmes that are tailor-made for specific targeted audience. Sensitisation campaigns on the benefits of staying home should be aimed at younger social media users (aged <39 years). Community health centres in rural areas need to be involved in providing educational videos to empowering people towards self-efficacy.","Sun, Marie Chan; Jeetun, Beneeta; Neerunjun, Deevya; Cheeneebash, Jayrani",Public Health Pract (Oxf),https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2666535221000811; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34189491/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666535221000811?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.puhip.2021.100156,0

Various anticoagulation regimens are now being considered for these patients. Anticoagulation is known to increase the risk for adverse bleeding events, of which intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) is one of the most feared. We present a retrospective study of 33 patients positive for COVID-19 with neuroimaging-documented ICH and examine anticoagulation use in this population. Methods : Patients over the age of 18 with confirmed COVID-19 and radiographic evidence of ICH were included in this study. Evidence of hemorrhage was confirmed and categorized by a fellowship trained neuroradiologist. Electronic health records were analyzed for patient information including demographic data, medical history, hospital course, laboratory values, and medications. Results : We identified 33 COVID-19 positive patients with ICH, mean age 61.6 years (range 37 to 83 years), 21.2% of whom were female. Parenchymal hemorrhages with mass effect and herniation occurred in 5 (15.2%) patients, with a 100% mortality rate. Of the remaining 28 patients with ICH, 7 (25%) had punctate hemorrhages, 17 (60.7%) had small- moderate size hemorrhages, and 4 (14.3%) had a large single site of hemorrhage without evidence of herniation. Almost all patients received either therapeutic dose anticoagulation (in 22 [66.7%] patients) or prophylactic dose (in 3 [9.1] patients) prior to ICH discovery. Conclusions : Anticoagulation therapy may be considered in patients with COVID-19 though the risk of ICH should be taken into account when developing a treatment regimen.","Dogra, Siddhant; Jain, Rajan; Cao, Meng; Bilaloglu, Seda; Zagzag, David; Hochman, Sarah; Lewis, Ariane; Melmed, Kara; Hochman, Katherine; Horwitz, Leora; Galetta, Steven; Berger, Jeffrey",J Stroke Cerebrovasc Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32689588/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2020.104984; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S105230572030402X?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S105230572030402X,0
