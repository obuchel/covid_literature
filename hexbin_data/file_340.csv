3359,Transmission of Influenza A in a Student Office Based on Realistic Person-to-Person Contact and Surface Touch Behaviour,2018-08-09,"Influenza A viruses result in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of individuals worldwide each year. In this study, influenza A transmission in a graduate student office is simulated via long-range airborne, fomite, and close contact routes based on real data from more than 3500 person-to-person contacts and 127,000 surface touches obtained by video-camera. The long-range airborne, fomite and close contact routes contribute to 54.3%, 4.2% and 44.5% of influenza A infections, respectively. For the fomite route, 59.8%, 38.1% and 2.1% of viruses are transmitted to the hands of students from private surfaces around the infected students, the students themselves and other susceptible students, respectively. The intranasal dose via fomites of the students’ bodies, belongings, computers, desks, chairs and public facilities are 8.0%, 6.8%, 13.2%, 57.8%, 9.3% and 4.9%, respectively. The intranasal dose does not monotonously increase or decrease with the virus transfer rate between hands and surfaces. Mask wearing is much more useful than hand washing for control of influenza A in the tested office setting. Regular cleaning of high-touch surfaces, which can reduce the infection risk by 2.14%, is recommended and is much more efficient than hand-washing.","Zhang, Nan; Li, Yuguo",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6121424/,340
3574,Infections in Healthcare Workers in Germany—22-Year Time Trends †,2018-11-26,"Health workers (HWs) run an increased risk of infection. The standardised data set of an accident insurer was used to analyse the time trends of infection-related claims and confirmed occupational diseases (ODs) in HWs. The numbers of claims and confirmed claims for different infections were analysed for the years 1996 to 2017. The rate of claims and confirmed ODs were calculated per 100,000 full-time workers. The number of claims was relatively stable over time. However, the rate per 100,000 full-time workers decreased from 25.2 to 15.4. The decrease was most pronounced for hepatitis B and hepatitis C infections, which were the most frequent infections for which claims were made at the start of the period. In 2017, tuberculosis (TB)-related claims were more frequent than those related to blood-borne virus infections. However, the growing number of TB claims does not reflect an increased infection risk, but rather improved methods for the diagnosis of latent TB infection (LTBI). Measures to prevent blood-borne virus infections in HWs were successful in the last 22 years, but attention should be paid to newly emerging infections.","Nienhaus, Albert",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6313552/,340
12050,Mind over Matter: Testing the Efficacy of an Online Randomized Controlled Trial to Reduce Distraction from Smartphone Use,2020-07-05,"BACKGROUND: The indications for general anesthesia (GA) in obstetric settings, which are determined in consideration of maternal and fetal outcome, could be affected by local patterns of clinical practice grounded in unique situations and circumstances that vary among medical institutions. Although the use of GA for cesarean delivery has become less common with more frequent adoption of neuraxial anesthesia, GA was previously chosen for pregnancy with placenta previa at our institution in case of unexpected massive hemorrhage. However, the situation has been gradually changing since formation of a team dedicated to obstetric anesthesia practice. Here, we report the results of a review of all cesarean deliveries performed under GA, and assess the impact of our newly launched team on trends in clinical obstetric anesthesia practice at our institution. METHODS: Our original database for obstetric GA during the period of 2010 to 2019 was analyzed. The medical records of all parturients who received GA for cesarean delivery were reviewed to collect detailed information. Interrupted time series analysis was used to evaluate the impact of the launch of our obstetric anesthesia team. RESULTS: As recently as 2014, more than 10% of cesarean deliveries were performed under GA, with placenta previa accounting for the main indication in elective and emergent cases. Our obstetric anesthesia team was formed in 2015 to serve as a communication bridge between the department of anesthesiology and the department of obstetrics. Since then, there has been a steady decline in the percentage of cesarean deliveries performed under GA, decreasing to a low of less than 5% in the latest 2 years. Interrupted time series analysis revealed a significant reduction in obstetric GA after 2015 (P = 0.04), which was associated with decreased use of GA for pregnancy with placenta previa. On the other hand, every year has seen a number of urgent cesarean deliveries requiring GA. CONCLUSIONS: There has been a trend towards fewer obstetric GA since 2015. The optimized use of GA for cesarean delivery was made possible mainly through strengthened partnerships between anesthesiologists and obstetricians with the support of our obstetric anesthesia team.","Ikeda, Takamitsu; Kato, Atsuko; Bougaki, Masahiko; Araki, Yuko; Ohata, Takuya; Kawashima, Seiichiro; Imai, Yousuke; Ninagawa, Jun; Oba, Koji; Chang, Kyungho; Uchida, Kanji; Yamada, Yoshitsugu",BMC Health Serv Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7371464/,340

This study developed a four-dimension framework including self-disclosure, genuine response, functional interactivity, and genuineness in Chinese culture to investigate the effect of genuineness in the communication of Chinese social media influencers in pediatrics on public engagement. Content analysis was employed to examine these dimensions and the related public engagement in 300 social media posts on the largest microblogging site in China. The findings indicate that genuine response was positively associated with the number of comments and positive comments, while negatively related to the number of shares. Functional interactivity made the site more appealing, resulting in likes and shares. Genuineness in Chinese culture was reflected in engagement through sharing posts by the public. This study is the first to develop an integrated framework to measure genuineness in online health communication and contributes to the understanding of the effect of genuineness on Chinese public engagement in social media.","Lu, Wenze; Ngai, Cindy Sing Bik; Yang, Lu",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7579357/,340
14256,"Clinical Risk and Overall Survival in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus, Hyperglycemia and Glioblastoma Multiforme. A Review of the Current Literature",2020-11-17,"Growth of Legionella pneumophila and other opportunistic pathogens (OPs) in drinking water premise plumbing poses an increasing public health concern. Premise plumbing is constructed of a variety of materials, creating complex environments that vary chemically, microbiologically, spatially, and temporally in a manner likely to influence survival and growth of OPs. Here we systematically review the literature to critically examine the varied effects of common metallic (copper, iron) and plastic (PVC, cross-linked polyethylene (PEX)) pipe materials on factors influencing OP growth in drinking water, including nutrient availability, disinfectant levels, and the composition of the broader microbiome. Plastic pipes can leach organic carbon, but demonstrate a lower disinfectant demand and fewer water chemistry interactions. Iron pipes may provide OPs with nutrients directly or indirectly, exhibiting a high disinfectant demand and potential to form scales with high surface areas suitable for biofilm colonization. While copper pipes are known for their antimicrobial properties, evidence of their efficacy for OP control is inconsistent. Under some circumstances, copper’s interactions with premise plumbing water chemistry and resident microbes can encourage growth of OPs. Plumbing design, configuration, and operation can be manipulated to control such interactions and health outcomes. Influences of pipe materials on OP physiology should also be considered, including the possibility of influencing virulence and antibiotic resistance. In conclusion, all known pipe materials have a potential to either stimulate or inhibit OP growth, depending on the circumstances. This review delineates some of these circumstances and informs future research and guidance towards effective deployment of pipe materials for control of OPs.","Cullom, Abraham C.; Martin, Rebekah L.; Song, Yang; Williams, Krista; Williams, Amanda; Pruden, Amy; Edwards, Marc A.",Pathogens,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7698398/,340
16743,A Clinical Bridge between Family Caregivers and Older Adults: The Contribution of Patients’ Frailty and Optimism on Caregiver Burden,2021-03-25,"A molecular docking approach was employed to evaluate the binding affinity of six triterpenes, namely epifriedelanol, friedelin, α-amyrin, α-amyrin acetate, β-amyrin acetate, and bauerenyl acetate, towards the cannabinoid type 1 receptor (CB1). Molecular docking studies showed that friedelin, α-amyrin, and epifriedelanol had the strongest binding affinity towards CB1. Molecular dynamics simulation studies revealed that friedelin and α-amyrin engaged in stable non-bonding interactions by binding to a pocket close to the active site on the surface of the CB1 target protein. The studied triterpenes showed a good capacity to penetrate the blood–brain barrier. These results help to provide some evidence to justify, at least in part, the previously reported antinociceptive and sedative properties of Vernonia patula.","Afjalus Siraj, Md; Rahman, Md.

Some of the most important outcome measures in such studies are behavioral. Unfortunately, reports from different labs are often conflicting, and preclinical studies in rodent models are not often corroborated in human trials. There are many well-established tests for assessing various behavioral readouts, but subtle aspects can influence measurements. Features such as housing conditions, conditions of testing, and the sex and strain of the animals can all have effects on tests of behavior. In the conduct of behavior testing, it is important to keep these features in mind to ensure the reliability and reproducibility of results. In this review, we highlight factors that we and others have encountered that can influence behavioral measures. Our goal is to increase awareness of factors that can affect behavior in rodents and to emphasize the need for detailed reporting of methods.","Saré, Rachel Michelle; Lemons, Abigail; Smith, Carolyn Beebe",Brain Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8073298/,340

In this review, 335 research articles were referred from the popular scientific database (e.g., Scopus and Web of Science) to elaborate on the importance of quercetin in addressing human ailments and the health-protective role imparted. Being a valuable bioactive compound within the circular economy context, the source for obtaining quercetin has been extended for food industrial wastes/byproducts (mainly of fresh produce). Further, the establishment of the molecular mechanism, antioxidant potential, oxidative stress, metabolic process, myocardial damage, anti neurogenerative potential, enzymatic expression, and ROS inhibition renders quercetin an ideal phytochemical that can provide protective benefits against cardiac and neurodegenerative diseases. ABSTRACT: Quercetin, a bioactive secondary metabolite, holds incredible importance in terms of bioactivities, which has been proved by in vivo and in vitro studies. The treatment of cardiovascular and neurological diseases by quercetin has been extensively investigated over the past decade. Quercetin is present naturally in appreciable amounts in fresh produce (fruits and vegetables). However, today, corresponding to the growing population and global demand for fresh fruits and vegetables, a paradigm shift and focus is laid towards exploring industrial food wastes and/or byproducts as a new resource to obtain bioactive compounds such as quercetin. Based on the available research reports over the last decade, quercetin has been suggested as a reliable therapeutic candidate for either treating or alleviating health issues, mainly those of cardiovascular and neurological diseases. In the present review, we have summarized some of the critical findings and hypotheses of quercetin from the available databases foreseeing its future use as a potential therapeutic agent to treat cardiovascular and neurological diseases. It is anticipated that this review will be a potential reference material for future research activities to be undertaken on quercetin obtained from fresh produce as well as their respective processing wastes/byproducts that rely on the circular concept.","Bhat, Irshad Ul Haq; Bhat, Rajeev",Biology (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8301140/,340
20417,A Cross-Sectional Analysis of the Association between Domestic Cooking Energy Source Type and Respiratory Infections among Children Aged under Five Years: Evidence from Demographic and Household Surveys in 37 Low-Middle Income Countries,2021-08-12,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: We used multi-omics approaches to evaluate the association of complement signature C3/C5/C3AR1/C5AR1 with tumor immune phenotypes and prognosis across various cancer types. We found that the gene signatures have deregulated expression in human malignancies and demonstrated context-dependent association with tumor immune evasion, prognosis, and therapy response across the various cancer types. Further analysis revealed that C3, C5, C3AR1, and C5AR1 were associated with tumor immune evasion via dysfunctional T-cell phenotypes with a lesser contribution of T-cell exclusion. Lastly, we also demonstrated that the expression levels of C3, C5, C3AR1, and C5AR1 were associated with context-dependent chemotherapy, lymphocyte-mediated tumor killing, and immunotherapy outcomes in different cancer types. The complement components C3, C5, C3AR1, and C5AR1 serve as attractive targets for strategizing cancer immunotherapy and response follow-up. ABSTRACT: Despite the advances in our understanding of the genetic and immunological basis of cancer, cancer remains a major public health burden with an ever-increasing incidence rate globally. Nevertheless, increasing evidence suggests that the components of the complement system could regulate the tumor microenvironment (TME) to promote cancer progression, recurrence, and metastasis. In the present study, we used an integrative multi-omics analysis of clinical data to explore the relationships between the expression levels of and genetic and epigenetic alterations in C3, C5, C3AR1, and C5AR1 and tumor immune evasion, therapy response, and patient prognosis in various cancer types. We found that the complements C3, C5, C3AR1, and C5AR1 have deregulated expression in human malignancies and are associated with activation of immune-related oncogenic processes and poor prognosis of cancer patients. Furthermore, we found that the increased expression levels of C3, C5, C3AR1, and C5AR1 were primarily predicted by copy number variation and gene methylation and were associated with dysfunctional T-cell phenotypes. Single nucleotide variation in the gene signature co-occurred with multiple oncogenic mutations and is associated with the progression of onco-immune-related diseases. Further correlation analysis revealed that C3, C5, C3AR1, and C5AR1 were associated with tumor immune evasion via dysfunctional T-cell phenotypes with a lesser contribution of T-cell exclusion. Lastly, we also demonstrated that the expression levels of C3, C5, C3AR1, and C5AR1 were associated with context-dependent chemotherapy, lymphocyte-mediated tumor killing, and immunotherapy outcomes in different cancer types.

20965,Behavioral Theory-Based Framework for Prediabetes Self-Care System—Design Perspectives and Validation Results,2021-08-31,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: In this review article we summarize the current literature on the pro- and anti-metastatic roles of distinct microRNAs in prostate cancer with a particular focus on their impact on invasion, migration and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Moreover, we give a brief overview on how this knowledge developed so far into novel therapeutic approaches to target metastatic prostate cancer. ABSTRACT: Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most prevalent cancer types in males and the consequences of its distant metastatic deposits are the leading cause of PCa mortality. Therefore, identifying the causes and molecular mechanisms of hematogenous metastasis formation is of considerable clinical importance for the future development of improved therapeutic approaches. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level by targeting messenger RNAs. Numerous studies have identified miRNAs as promotors or inhibitors of metastasis and revealed, in part, their targeting pathways in PCa. Because miRNAs are remarkably stable and can be detected in both tissue and body fluid, its potential as specific biomarkers for metastasis and therapeutic response is also currently under preclinical evaluation. In the present review, we focus on miRNAs that are supposed to initiate or suppress metastasis by targeting several key mRNAs in PCa. Metastasis-suppressing miRNAs include miR-33a-5p, miR-34, miR-132 and miR-212, miR-145, the miR-200 family (incl. miR-141-3p), miR-204-5p, miR-532-3p, miR-335, miR-543, miR-505-3p, miR 19a 3p, miR-802, miR-940, and miR-3622a. Metastasis-promoting RNAs, such as miR-9, miR-181a, miR-210-3, miR-454, miR-671-5p, have been shown to increase the metastatic potential of PCa cells. Other metastasis-related miRNAs with conflicting reports in the literature are also discussed (miR-21 and miR-186). Finally, we summarize the recent developments of miRNA-based therapeutic approaches, as well as current limitations in PCa. Taken together, the metastasis-controlling miRNAs provide the potential to be integrated in the strategy of diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of metastatic PCa. Nevertheless, there is still a lack of consistency between certain miRNA signatures and reproducibility, which impedes clinical implementation.","Oh-Hohenhorst, Su Jung; Lange, Tobias",Cancers (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8431208/,340

In order to analyze whether the multicomponent physical–cognitive training is beneficial for this population, 17 MPO-Ps (81.59 ± 5.63 years) completed a >26 weeks home-based intervention (20–50 min/session, three sessions/week). Twenty-eight supervised and thirty-two autonomous sessions were gradually distributed along three phases: supervised training (ST), reduced supervision training (RST), and autonomous training (AT). Physical function (gait speed, hand grip and lower-limb strength, balance, and agility), mental status (MMSE), and autonomy in daily living (the Barthel Index) were assessed. Categorical analyses regarding the changes in the walking aids used in the test were added to improve the assessment of strength and agility along the intervention. Despite important study limitations, such as the small sample size and lack of a control group, and despite the MPO-Ps’ very low baseline fitness and initial exercise intolerance, they benefited from the dual-tasking approach, especially in autonomy, lower-limb strength, and balance. Agility improvements were shown only by categorical analyses. As expected, most benefits increased the supervision (ST phase). Gait speed and cognitive status maintained despite the total autonomy in training in the last phase. Further research with larger samples should confirm if multicomponent physical–cognitive exercise, individualized and tailored on daily-basis, together with technical assistance and medical supervision, benefits this MPO-Ps population, and if it can be prescribed to them with security, in spite some of them already being palliative patients.","Blasco-Lafarga, Cristina; Sanchis-Soler, Gema; Llorens, Pere",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8431350/,340

To date, much of medicine has protected and treated patients as if they were a single species. This has resulted in unintended damage to the microbiome and an epidemic of chronic disorders [e.g., noncommunicable diseases and conditions (NCDs)]. Along with NCDs came loss of colonization resistance, increased susceptibility to infectious diseases, and increasing multimorbidity and polypharmacy over the life course. To move toward sustainable healthcare, the human microbiome needs to be front and center. This paper presents microbiome-human physiology from the view of systems biology regulation. It also details the ongoing NCD epidemic including the role of existing drugs and other factors that damage the human microbiome. Examples are provided for two entryway NCDs, asthma and obesity, regarding their extensive network of comorbid NCDs. Finally, the challenges of ensuring safety for the microbiome are detailed. Under Microbiome-First Medicine and considering the importance of keystone bacteria and critical windows of development, changes in even a few microbiota-prioritized medical decisions could make a significant difference in health across the life course.","Dietert, Rodney R.",Biomedicines,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8468398/,340

54369,Quality of Life in Hidradenitis Suppurativa: An Update,2021-06-06,"OBJECTIVE: When COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic, collegiate athletic departments faced the difficult decision to postpone or cancel sport activities. Aside from concerns of virus transmission, disruptions in sport impacted student-athletes broadly. This study aimed to investigate athletes’ experiences during the pandemic toward developing a better understanding of athletes’ attitudes about the virus and returning to sport. METHODS: Participants included 245 varsity student-athletes across NCAA sports and divisions who voluntarily completed an online survey between August and October 2020. RESULTS: A positive COVID-19 result during the pandemic was reported by 1 in 4 athletes. Mental health, cancelled seasons, and academic progress were rated the top three COVID-related concerns. Declines in physical fitness were reported by 50% of participants and change in weight was reported by 45%. While agreement that their athletic department was taking COVID-19 seriously was endorsed by 78% of athletes, 26% believed the proposed safety procedures lacked feasibility. Concern about speaking up if the procedures were not followed was endorsed by 79% of athletes. Of the participants, 88% agreed that they have a social responsibility to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Only 44% worried about being exposed to the virus during sport participation. Comfort returning to sport immediately was endorsed by 70% of student-athletes. Just over half said they would get vaccinated if the vaccine became available. CONCLUSIONS: Student-athletes have been affected by the pandemic in several ways. It is evident that athletes are concerned about the pandemic’s impact on mental and physical health and are eager to return to sport.","MA, Davies; A, LoGalbo",Arch Clin Neuropsychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8194654/,340

In this study, the effects of this parameter on the tensile and the surface roughness properties were investigated. It was determined that the ultimate tensile strength (UTS) decreased with increasing raster angle; hence, 0° raster angle where tensile loading direction is parallel to the raster yielded the highest strength. Besides ±45° raster angle resulted the most ductile behaviour with the highest fracture strains. Fracture occurred due to raster failure for 0° raster angle but for 90° raster angle, it was due to the failure of the interlayer raster bonds. In the case of ±45°, both of the failure mechanisms were effective. Surface roughness values increased up to 7 µm when measurement was perpendicular to the raster and dropped below 1 µm when it was parallel to the raster.","Çakan, Betül Gülçimen",J Mech Sci Technol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8295972/,340

The BZgA targets its information according to the needs of specific groups and actively involves multipliers.In order to incorporate the perspectives of the population as well as those of prevention and health promotion professionals into the services developed by the BZgA, given the particularly initial low level of knowledge in the population, various methods and data sources were used: the COVID-19 Snapshot Monitoring (COSMO) population survey, the monitoring of citizens' enquiries via telephone and e­mail to the BZgA, surveys of counselling professionals from nationwide telephone and online counselling centres, surveys of health professionals in early help (NZFH) and interdisciplinary practice expert hearings. Beyond providing pure information, practical and everyday offers should be developed and provided according to WHO guidelines and evidence-based criteria of effective communication in order to support the competences for a gradual adaptation to a ""new normality"".The paper describes the data-based and evidence-informed development process of communication content and offers, their dissemination via existing websites and channels for other topics as well as their integration into the new online platform www.zusammengegencorona.de . This demonstrates how demand-driven and target group-specific communication offers can be implemented beyond the classic and proven campaign appearance.","von Rüden, Ursula; Spura, Anke; Horstmann, Sabine; Renner, Ilona; Merkel, Christina; Buhs, Bernhard; Thaiss, Heidrun; De Bock, Freia",Bundesgesundheitsblatt Gesundheitsforschung Gesundheitsschutz,,340
216179,Veno-Venous Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation in COVID-19-Where Are We Now?,2021,"Background: Since December 2019, a number of patients infected with COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) have been identified in Wuhan, Hubei, China. As the epidemic has spread, similar cases have also been found in other parts of mainland China and abroad. The main reason for this spread is the highly contagious nature of the virus and the fact that children can also become infected during its incubation period. This has made the virus a substantial challenge for the outpatient triage staff of children's hospitals outside the epidemic area of the Hubei Province. It is very important for the preview and triage personnel to accurately grasp the epidemiology of the virus and identify children's symptoms in the fever clinic. Methods: We performed an analysis of our early preview and triage of suspected COVID-19 in 36 children presenting at fever clinics. Two specialists either excluded suspected cases or referred cases to the isolation ward for new nucleic acid testing. Results: All 14 children who were transferred to the isolation ward had a fever, and 71.43% of them had a cough. Their nucleic acid testing results were negative. The suspected cases and excluded suspected cases had similar epidemiology history as well as complete blood count results. With reference to the diagnostic criteria in existing pediatric guidelines, we have further improved the triage screening questionnaire for children with fever in our hospital. Conclusions: According to the situation in our city and hospital, an evaluation questionnaire that is suitable for use with children in our hospital has been formulated to achieve the goals of early detection, isolation, diagnosis, and treatment. We provided an important basis for the next step in developing accurate preview and triage screening standards and appropriate guidelines for pediatric patients.","Zhang, Ni; Deng, Yuebi; Li, Weiguo; Liu, Junhong; Li, Haiying; Liu, Enmei; Zheng, Xianlan",Transl.

228421,Distribution of the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic and Its Monthly Forecast Based on Seasonal Climate Patterns,2020,"PURPOSE: To report imaging findings at computed tomography angiography (CTA) and venography (CTV) of the abdomen and pelvis in evaluation of hemorrhagic and thrombotic lesions in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. METHODS: In this retrospective observational study, patients admitted to a single tertiary care center from April 1 to July 20, 2020, who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and developed acute abdominal pain or decreasing hemoglobin levels over the course of hospitalization were included. Abdominal CTA/CTV imaging studies performed in these patients were reviewed, and acute hemorrhagic or thromboembolic findings were recorded. RESULTS: A total of 40 patients (mean age, 59.7 years; 20 men, 20 women) were evaluated. Twenty-five patients (62.5%) required intensive care unit (ICU) admission and 15 patients (37.5%) were treated in the medical ward. Hemorrhagic complications were detected in 19 patients (47.5%), the most common was intramuscular hematoma diagnosed in 17 patients; It involved the iliopsoas compartment unilaterally in 10 patients, bilaterally in 2 patients and the rectus sheath in 5 cases. Pelvic extraperitoneal hemorrhage was found in 3 patients, and mesenteric hematoma in one patient. Thromboembolic events were diagnosed in 8 patients (20%) including; arterial thrombosis (n = 2), venous thrombosis (n = 2), splenic infarct (n = 1), bowel ischemia (n = 1) and multiple sites of thromboembolism (n = 2). CONCLUSION: Our study highlights that both hemorrhagic and thromboembolic complications can be seen in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. It is important that radiologists maintain a high index of suspicion for early diagnosis of these complications.","Abdelmohsen, Mohsen Ahmed; Alkandari, Buthaina M; Abdel Razek, Ahmed Abdel Khalek; Tobar, Ahmed Mohamed; Gupta, Vikash K; Elsebaie, Nermeen",Clin Imaging,,340

Methods The is a retrospective, descriptive and comparative study of epidemiological, clinical and endoscopic characteristics of patients who had emergency ERCP over two successive 8 months:Period(1):01/03/2019-31/10/2019 andPeriod(2):01/03/2020-31/10/2020 in our department of hepatogastroenterology of university hospital Mohammed VIOujda. Results The average age of patients was 62 years(12-93) during period(2) versus 67 years(25-104)during period(1),there were a female predominance in two groups.During period(2) 145 ERCP were performed,87(60 %) were in emergencycontext for acute cholangitis,9 had acute pancreatitis associated,12.6 % were in grade III of acute cholangitis and theaverage of bilirubin before the procedure was 115 mg/l and 54 mg/l after versus 166 ERCP during the period(1),93(56 %)having emergency ERCP for acute cholangitis, and acute pancreatitis was associated in 9 patients,17.2 % were in gradeIII, and the average of bilirubin before the procedure was 130 mg/l and 64 mg/l after during period(1),52.9 % patients whohad placement of prosthesis in period(2) versus 47.3 % in period(1),and 57.5 % patients had an endoscopic sphincterotomyversus 57 % respectively.In period(2),the etiology was lithiasis in 51.7 % patients, tumoral in 43.7 % patients, and hydatidcyst in 4.6 % patients, In period(1)the lithiasis patholology was in 58 % patients, tumoral in 36.8 % patients, two cases ofprosthesis dysfunction,1 with hydatid cyst and 1 with sump syndrom.In period(2),failed drainage was noted in 3(3.4 %)patients:2 patients:surgical drainage,1 patient:nasobiliary drainage, in period(1) 5(5.3 %)patients:3 patients:surgicaldrainage 2 patients:percutaneous drainage. Conclusions The results of our comparative study between period (1) and (2) are the age was around 60, female sexpredominate over male, therefore lithiasis pathology was the most predominant cause due to not having cholecystectomy, followed by the tumoral cause which is tardily diagnosed after complications and requiring drainage, placement of prosthesis was preferred during the covid period to reduce the risk of recurrence, the delay to perform ERCP, complications post-ERCP and hospital staying are decreased during the period(2), given the constraints of the pandemy.","Nasiri, M.; El Mqaddem, O.; Taiymi, A.; Zazour, A.; El Mekkaoui, A.; Khannoussi, W.; Kharrasse, G.; Ismaili, Z.",Endoscopy,,340

235278,Stigma and Discrimination (SAD) at the Time of the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic,2020,"On March 15, 2020 Puerto Rico implemented non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), including a mandatory curfew, as part of a state of emergency declaration to prevent the community transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The strict enforcement of this curfew was extended through May 25, with a gradual relaxation beginning on May 1. This report summarizes an assessment of these early mitigation measures on the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic in the island. From March 15 to May 15, 2020, 70,656 results of molecular (RT-PCR) tests were reported to the Puerto Rico Department of Health. Of these, 1,704 were positive, corresponding to 1,311 individuals with COVID-19 included in the study. We derived the epidemic growth rates (r) and the corresponding reproductive numbers (R) from the epidemic curve of these 1,311 individuals with laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 using their date of test collection as a proxy for symptoms onset. Through May 31, 2020, there were 143 COVID-19 associated deaths in Puerto Rico, for a case fatality risk of 10.9%. We compared the observed cases and deaths with Gompertz model projections had the mitigation measures not been implemented. The number of daily RT-PCR-confirmed cases peaked on March 30 (85 cases), showing a weekly cyclical trend, with lower counts on weekends and a decreasing secular trend since March 30. The initial exponential growth rate (r) was 15.87% (95% CI: 7.59%, 24.15%), corresponding to R of 1.82 (95% CI:1.37, 2.30). After March 30, the r value reverted to an exponential decay rate (negative) of -2.95% (95% CI: -4.99%, -0.92%), corresponding to R of 0.93 (95% CI: 0.86, 0.98). We estimate that, had the initial growth rate been maintained, a total of 6,155 additional COVID-19 cases would have occurred by May 15, with 211 additional COVID-19 deaths by May 31. These findings are consistent with very effective implementation of early NPIs as mitigation measures in Puerto Rico. These results also provide a baseline to assess the impact of the transition from mitigation to subsequent containment stages in Puerto Rico.","Valencia, Miguel; Becerra, José E; Reyes, Juan C; Castro, Kenneth G",PLoS One,,340

240501,SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic Impact on Pediatric Emergency Rooms: A Multicenter Study,2020,"Governmental restrictions aspiring to slow down the spread of epidemic and pandemic outbreaks lead to impairments for economic operations, which impact transportation networks comprising the maritime, rail, air, and trucking industries. Witnessing a substantial increase in the number of infections in Germany, the authorities have imposed drastic restrictions on everyday life. Resulting panic buying and increasing home consumption had versatile impacts on transport volume and freight capacity dynamics in German food retail logistics. Due to the lack of prior research on the effects of COVID-19 on transport volume in retail logistics, as well as resulting implications, this article aspires to shed light on the phenomenon of changing volume and capacity dynamics in road haulage. After analyzing the transport volume of n = 15,715 routes in the timeframe of 23.03.2020 to 30.04.2020, a transport volume growth rate expressing the difference of real and expected transport volume was calculated. This ratio was then examined concerning the number of COVID-19 infections per day. The results of this study prove that the increasing freight volume for dry products in retail logistics does not depend on the duration of the COVID-19 epidemy but on the strength quantified through the total number of new infections per day. This causes a conflict of interest between transportation companies and food retail logistics for non-cooled transport capacity. The contributions of this paper are highly relevant to assess the impact of a possibly occurring second COVID-19 virus infection wave.","Loske, Dominic",Transp. Res. Interdiscip. Perspect.,,340
253386,SARS/MERS/SARS-CoV-2 Outbreaks and Burnout Syndrome among Healthcare Workers. An Umbrella Systematic Review,2021,"Systemic vascular inflammation plays multiple maladaptive roles which contribute to the progression and destabilization of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). These roles include: (i) driving atheroprogression in the clinically stable phase of disease; (ii) inciting atheroma destabilization and precipitating acute coronary syndromes (ACS); and (iii) responding to cardiomyocyte necrosis in myocardial infarction (MI). Despite an evolving understanding of these biologic processes, successful clinical translation into effective therapies has proven challenging. Realizing the promise of targeting inflammation in the prevention and treatment of ASCVD will likely require more individualized approaches, as the degree of inflammation differs among cardiovascular patients. A large body of evidence has accumulated supporting the use of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) as a clinical measure of inflammation. Appreciating the mechanistic diversity of ACS triggers and the kinetics of hsCRP in MI may resolve purported inconsistencies from prior observational studies. Future clinical trial designs incorporating hsCRP may hold promise to enable individualized approaches. The aim of this Clinical Review is to summarize the current understanding of how inflammation contributes to ASCVD progression, destabilization, and adverse clinical outcomes. We offer forward-looking perspective on what next steps may enable successful clinical translation into effective therapeutic approaches-enabling targeting the right patients with the right therapy at the right time-on the road to more individualized ASCVD care.","Lawler, Patrick R; Bhatt, Deepak L; Godoy, Lucas C; Lüscher, Thomas F; Bonow, Robert O; Verma, Subodh; Ridker, Paul M",Eur. heart j,,340

This study aimed to identify the factors associated with increased COVID-19 severity and evaluate the current antiviral drugs, especially in severe patients. METHODS: This was a retrospective observational study performed at the No. 7 Hospital of Wuhan (Wuhan, China) with hospitalized patients confirmed with COVID-19 from January 11 to March 13, 2020. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify the associated factors of severe COVID. Treatments of antivirus drugs were collected and evaluated. RESULTS: Of the 550 patients, 292 (53.1%) were female and 277 (50.4%) were > 60 years old. The most common symptom was fever (n = 372, 67.7%), followed by dry cough (n = 257, 46.7%), and dyspnea (n = 237, 43.1%), and fatigue (n = 224, 40.7%). Among the severe patients, 20.2% required invasive ventilator support and 18.0% required non-invasive ventilator. The identified risk factors for severe cases were: age &#8805; 60 years (odds ratio (OR) =3.02, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.13-8.08, P = 0.028), D-dimer > 0.243 µg/ml (OR = 2.734, 95%CI: 1.012-7.387, P = 0.047), and low oxygenation index (OR = 0.984, 95%CI: 0.980-0.989, P < 0.001). In severe cases, the benefits (relief of clinical symptoms, clinical outcome, and discharge rate) of arbidol alone was 73.3%, which was better than ribavirin (7/17, 41.2%, P = 0.029). CONCLUSIONS: Age > 60 years, D-dimer > 0.243 µg/ml, and lower oxygenation index were associated with severe COVID-19.

OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the intervention program for immobile patients with stroke in China. DESIGN: A cost-effectiveness analysis alongside a pre-test/post-test (before and after) study was undertaken from a health care perspective. SETTINGS: Participants were recruited from 25 hospitals among six provinces or municipal cities in eastern (Guangdong province, Zhejiang province, and Beijing municipal city), western (Sichuan province), and central (Henan province and Hubei province) China. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 7,653 immobile stroke patients were included in our sample. Patients in routine care settings were recruited from November 2015 to June 2016, and the recruitment of the intervention group patients was from November 2016 to July 2017. METHODS: To adjust for potential bias from confounding variables, the 1:1 propensity score matching yielded matched pairs of 2,966 patients in the routine care group and 2,966 patients in the intervention group, with no significant differences in sociodemographic or clinical characteristics between two groups. All patients were followed-up 3 months after enrolment in the study. Total healthcare costs were extracted from the hospital information system, with the health outcome effectiveness of the intervention program measured using the EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire (EQ-5D) instrument and the cost-effectiveness of the intervention measured by the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio with a time horizon of 3 months. RESULTS: Compared to routine care, the intervention program decreased the total costs of stroke patients by CN¥4,600 (95% confidence interval [CI]: [-7050, -2151]), while increasing quality-adjusted life year 0.009 (95% CI: [0.005, 0.013]). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios over 3 months was CN¥-517,011 per quality-adjusted life year (95% CI: [-1,111,442, -203,912]). Subgroup analysis reveals that both the health-related quality of life and cost effectiveness improved significantly for ischemic patients and tertiary hospitals patients while for hemorrhagic patients and non-tertiary hospital patients only the health-related quality of life improved significantly. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this first cost-effectiveness analysis in immobile stroke patients provide evidence that an intervention program provided significant cost saving, but mainly in ischemic patients and tertiary hospital patients. Wider adoption of such programs may be a sensible approach to reducing the burden of stroke and for immobile patients more generally.","Liu, Hongpeng; Zhu, Dawei; Song, Baoyun; Jin, Jingfen; Liu, Yilan; Wen, Xianxiu; Cheng, Shouzhen; Nicholas, Stephen; Wu, Xinjuan",Int J Nurs Stud,,340

318459,"Public Perception of the First Major SARS-Cov-2 Outbreak in the Suceava County, Romania",2021,"To control the spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), Saudi Arabia's government imposed a strict lockdown during March-July 2020. As a result, the public was confined to indoors, and most of their daily activities were happening in their indoor places, which might have resulted in lower indoor environment quality. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were analyzed in household dust (n = 40) collected from different residential districts of Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, during the lockdown period. PAHs' levels were two folds higher than the previously reported PAHs in indoor dust from this region. We detected low molecular weight (LMW) with two to four aromatic ring PAHs in all the samples with a significant contribution from Phenanthrene (Phe), present at an average concentration of 1590 ng/g of dust. Although high molecular weight (HMW) (5-6 aromatic ring) PAHs were detected at lower concentrations than LMW PAHs, however, they contributed >90% in the carcinogenic index of PAHs. The estimated daily intake (EDI) of specific PAHs was above the reference dose (RfD) for young children in high-end exposure and the calculated Incremental Lifetime Cancer Risk (ILCR) was >1.00 × 10-4 for both Saudi adults and young children. The study highlighted that indoor pollution has increased significantly during lockdown due to the increased indoor activities and inversely affect human health.

321764,Aerial Transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 Virus through Environmental E-Cigarette Aerosols: Implications for Public Policies,2021,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS CoV-2) is the causative agent of the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Coronaviruses enter cells via fusion of the viral envelope with the plasma membrane and/or via fusion of the viral envelope with endosomal membranes after virion endocytosis. The spike (S) glycoprotein is a major determinant of virus infectivity. Herein, we show that the transient expression of the SARS CoV-2 S glycoprotein in Vero cells caused extensive cell fusion (formation of syncytia) in comparison to limited cell fusion caused by the SARS S glycoprotein. Both S glycoproteins were detected intracellularly and on transfected Vero cell surfaces. These results are in agreement with published pathology observations of extensive syncytia formation in lung tissues of patients with COVID-19. These results suggest that SARS CoV-2 is able to spread from cell-to-cell much more efficiently than SARS effectively avoiding extracellular neutralizing antibodies. A systematic screening of several drugs including cardiac glycosides and kinase inhibitors and inhibitors of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) entry revealed that only the FDA-approved HIV protease inhibitor, nelfinavir mesylate (Viracept) drastically inhibited S-n- and S-o-mediated cell fusion with complete inhibition at a 10-µM concentration. In-silico docking experiments suggested the possibility that nelfinavir may bind inside the S trimer structure, proximal to the S2 amino terminus directly inhibiting S-n- and S-o-mediated membrane fusion. Also, it is possible that nelfinavir may act to inhibit S proteolytic processing within cells. These results warrant further investigations of the potential of nelfinavir mesylate to inhibit virus spread at early times after SARS CoV-2 symptoms appear.","Musarrat, Farhana; Chouljenko, Vladimir; Dahal, Achyut; Nabi, Rafiq; Chouljenko, Tamara; Jois, Seetharama D; Kousoulas, Konstantin G",J. med. virol,,340
323902,"Transmission Dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 during an Outbreak in a Roma Community in Thessaly, Greece-Control Measures and Lessons Learned",2021,"SARS-CoV-2, the agent of COVID-19, is similar to two other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, in causing life-threatening maternal respiratory infections and systemic complications. Because of global concern for potential intrauterine transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from pregnant women to their infants, this report analyzes the effects on pregnancy of infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory RNA viruses, and examines the frequency of maternal-fetal transmission with SARS-CoV-2, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza (HPIV) and metapneumovirus (hMPV). There have been no confirmed cases of intrauterine transmission reported with COVID-19 or any other coronavirus infections. Influenza virus, despite causing approximately one billion annual infections globally, has only a few cases of confirmed or suspected intrauterine fetal infections reported. RSV is in an unusual cause of illness among pregnant women, and with the exception of one premature infant with congenital pneumonia, no other cases of maternal-fetal infection are described. Parainfluenza virus and human metapneumovirus can produce symptomatic maternal infections but do not cause intrauterine fetal infection. In summary, it appears that the absence thus far of maternal-fetal transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus during the COVID-19 pandemic is similar to other coronaviruses, and is also consistent with the extreme rarity of suggested or confirmed cases of intrauterine transmission of other respiratory RNA viruses. This observation has important consequences for pregnant women as it appears that if intrauterine transmission of SARSCoV-2 does eventually occur, it will be a rare event. Potential mechanisms of fetal protection from maternal viral infections are also discussed.","Schwartz, David A; Dhaliwal, Amareen",Arch. pathol. lab. med. (1976),,340

A few days after discharge from hospital, the patient developed fever and severe pain in several joints in the lower extremities. The pain was so severe that the patient was unable to stand on his feet. Synovial fluid from the right-side knee contained a high number of polynuclear cells and a few mononuclear cells. Microscopy, culture and PCR tests for bacterial infection were all negative. Furthermore, the patient tested negative for rheumatoid factor, anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide and human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B27. Thus, the condition was compatible with reactive arthritis. The condition improved markedly after a few days' treatment with non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs and prednisolone.","Hønge, Bo Langhoff; Hermansen, Marie-Louise From; Storgaard, Merete",BMJ case reports,,340

Pressupõe-se que as políticas de distanciamento social são heterogêneas, apesar da liderança dos governos, ou seja, apresentam certo grau de assimetria nas restrições do funcionamento do comércio e de atividades com potencial de aglomeração de pessoas. Diante disso, foram combinados os debates sobre processo de produção de políticas públicas e sobre autonomia e federalismo, para investigar a influência dos fatores políticos ou técnico-administrativos nas políticas estaduais. Os seguintes procedimentos metodológicos foram utilizados: análise de conteúdo de 134 normativas estaduais; mapeamento do alinhamento político-partidário dos governadores estaduais ao presidente da República; análise dos recursos médico-hospitalares de cada unidade da federação baseada no Cadastro Nacional de Estabelecimentos de Saúde (CNES). O contexto emergencial revelou baixa coordenação interfederativa pelo governo federal, provocando uma competição entre entes federativos e forte liderança estadual na gestão da crise no âmbito local. A pesquisa mostra, por um lado, que as decisões sobre as políticas de distanciamento social não podem ser explicadas por fatores políticos; e por outro, a correspondência entre a capacidade do sistema de saúde local e o nível de rigor das políticas de distanciamento social. Conclui-se que, na atual situação de transtorno social intenso, preferiu-se a racionalidade técnica a barganhas políticas.","Pereira, Ana Karine; Oliveira, Marília Silva; Sampaio, Thiago da Silva",Rev. adm. pública (Online),,340
351043,Childbirth Care among SARS-CoV-2 Positive Women in Italy,2021,"This paper studies the effect of the end of school summer breaks on SARS-CoV-2 cases in Germany. The staggered timing of summer breaks across federal states allows us to implement an event study design. We base our analysis on official daily counts of confirmed coronavirus infections by age groups across all 401 German counties. We consider an event window of two weeks before and four weeks after the end of summer breaks. We do not find evidence of a positive effect of school re-openings on case numbers. For individuals aged between 5 and 59 years, comprising school-aged children and their parents, our preferred specification indicates that the end of summer breaks had a negative but insignificant effect on the number of new confirmed cases. Our results are not explained by changes in mobility patterns around school re-openings arising from travel returnees. Analyses of Google Trends data suggest that behavioral changes of parents may have contributed to contain larger outbreaks after school re-openings. We conclude that school re-openings in Germany under strict hygiene measures combined with quarantine and containment measures have not increased the number of newly confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections.","Isphording, Ingo E.; Lipfert, Marc Pestel Nico",Journal of Public Economics,,340

374692,SARS-CoV-2 Infection and Inflammatory Response in a Twin Pregnancy,2021,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 containment measures and the uncertainties associated with the pandemic may have contributed to changes in mental health risks and mental health problems in university students. Due to the high burden of the disease, depression is of particular concern. However, knowledge about the prevalence of depressive symptoms in Swiss university students during the pandemic is limited. We therefore assessed the prevalence of depressive symptoms and their change during the COVID-19 pandemic in a large sample of Swiss university students. METHODS: We assessed depressive symptoms in two cross-sectional cohorts of university students (n = 3571) in spring and autumn 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic and compared them with a matched sample of the Swiss national population (n = 2328). Binary logistic regression models estimated prevalence with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). RESULTS: Adjusted prevalence of depressive symptoms in female (30.8% (95% CI: 28.6-33.0)) and male students (24.8% (95% CI: 21.7-28.1)) was substantially higher than in the matching female (10.9% (95% CI: 8.9-13.2)) and male (8.5% (6.6-11.0)) pre-pandemic national population. Depressive symptoms in the two consecutive student cohorts did not significantly differ. CONCLUSIONS: More than a quarter of Swiss university students reported depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic, which was substantially higher as compared to the matched general population. Universities should introduce measures to support students in such times of crisis and gain an understanding of the factors impacting mental health positively or negatively and related to university structures and procedures.","Volken, Thomas; Zysset, Annina; Amendola, Simone; Klein Swormink, Anthony; Huber, Marion; von Wyl, Agnes; Dratva, Julia",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,340

The continually unfolding events precipitated by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic have further highlighted the importance of HL behaviors, as indicated by the characteristics of those who have been hospitalized and died from this viral infection. There has already been recognition that leading a healthy lifestyle, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, may have a substantial protective effect in those who become infected with the virus. Now more than ever, HL behaviors and HLM are essential and must be promoted with a renewed vigor across the globe. In response to the rapidly evolving world since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the clear need to change lifestyle behaviors to promote human resilience and quality of life, the HL for Pandemic Event Protection (HL-PIVOT) network was established. The 4 major areas of focus for the network are: (1) knowledge discovery and dissemination; (2) education; (3) policy; (4) implementation. This HL-PIVOT network position statement provides a current synopsis of the major focus areas of the network, including leading research in the field of HL behaviors and HLM, examples of best practices in education, policy, and implementation, and recommendations for the future.","Arena, Ross; Myers, Jonathan; Kaminsky, Leonard A; Williams, Mark; Sabbahi, Ahmad; Popovic, Dejana; Axtell, Robert; Faghy, Mark A; Hills, Andrew P; Olivares Olivares, Silvia Lizett; Lopez, Mildred; Pronk, Nicolaas P; Laddu, Deepika; Babu, Abraham Samuel; Josephson, Richard; Whitsel, Laurie P; Severin, Rich; Christle, Jeffrey W; Dourado, Victor Zuniga; Niebauer, Josef; Savage, Patrick; Austford, Leslie D; Lavie, Carl J",Curr Probl Cardiol,,340

407334,Association between Viral Infections and Risk of Autistic Disorder: An Overview,2021,"RATIONALE: Gynecological high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy has progressed for years, but it remains difficult for bulky tumors to be controlled locally. Dose limitations to organs at risk (OARs) are invariably obstacles in increasing the prescription dose. Additionally, it is controversial that the excessive hyperdose sleeve, the volume receiving a dose equal to or greater than twice the reference dose, should be eliminated in gynecological HDR brachytherapy. On the other hand, the technique of simultaneous integrated protection was reported for large hepatocellular carcinoma treatment, and similarly, internal high-dose brachytherapy could be used for treating bulky cervical carcinoma. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 54-year-old female had irregular genital bleeding and lost 13âkg in one year. DIAGNOSIS: She was diagnosed with T3bN1M0 cervical cancer in another hospital. The transverse diameter of the primary tumor was 10.5âcm. INTERVENTIONS: The whole pelvis and para-aortic lymph node were irradiated with a total of 50âGy in 25 fractions, but the size of the tumor showed only a slight decrease to 8.9âcm. After external beam radiotherapy, first-time high-dose-rate interstitial brachytherapy (HDR-ISBT) was administered without ""intentional internal high-dose (IIHD) policy,"" the technique of high-dose administration to only the inside of the tumor. Considering the rectum dose limitation, in the additional 2 times of brachytherapy, ""IIHD policy"" HDR-ISBT was applied. In the second and third HDR-ISBT, the percentage of the volume exposed to 200% of the prescribed dose for high-risk clinical target volume increased by 241% and 204% compared with the first HDR-ISBT, while the doses to OARs were not significantly higher than those of the first-time HDR-ISBT. OUTCOMES: Complete response was obtained, and no recurrence findings and side effects caused by HDR-ISBT have been detected for 2 years and 9 months. LESSONS: To our knowledge, this is the first report of IIHD HDR-ISBT for bulky cervical cancer. This technique can be the solution for treating bulky cervical cancer.","Kashihara, Tairo; Kobayashi, Kazuma; Iijima, Kotaro; Murakami, Naoya; Yoshida, Ken; Okuma, Kae; Nakamura, Satoshi; Takahashi, Kana; Inaba, Koji; Igaki, Hiroshi; Nakayama, Yuko; Kato, Tomoyasu; Uno, Takashi; Itami, Jun",Medicine (Baltimore),,340

It follows a non-contact based screening test which is very easy to apply being non-invasive and simply carried out within the boundaries of home so that the medical testing centers are not over flooded with patients and there is an overwhelming pressure because of maintenance of those patients with shortage of adequate infrastructure facilities. The dataset used in this study has been derived from the Coswara database which comprises of around 160 infected and 480 healthy individuals. Therefore, Artificial Intelligence based machine learning classifiers were used as an alternative means of diagnosis. Logistic regression (LR), K- Nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector machines (SVM), decision tree algorithms were used as classifiers in the proposed work. The results of this study show that the SVM classifier turned out to be the best in comparing among the COVID-19 and non COVID- 19 coughs with area under receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) of 0.98. The novelty in the proposed work includes the collection of dry cough samples which would aid in preliminary diagnosis of the infection.

The patient was successfully treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention and concurrent aggressive potassium repletion. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first case of COVID-19 presenting not only with an acute coronary thrombosis but also severe hypokalemia, both of which contributed to his cardiac arrest. The association of COVID-19 with acute coronary thrombosis, including the challenges surrounding the diagnosis and management in this patient population, is discussed. Additionally, the effect of COVID-19 on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is reviewed with a focus on hypokalemic presentations.","Lavoie, Matthew; Ramirez, Ariana; Kunz, Jeffrey",Mil. med,,340

Several observational studies investigated the relationship between Proton Pump Inhibitors use and the risk of COVID-19 development and mortality. AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of this meta-analysis is to investigate the association between current PPIs use and the development of COVID-19 as well as its mortality. METHODS: Pubmed, Google Scholar, ScienceDirect and medRxiv were searched until November 21, 2020 using the following keywords: proton pump inhibitors and COVID-19 as well as their related MESH terms. The studies considered in the meta-analysis were either cohort or case-control in design and adjusted for confounding factors. The quality of the studies included in this meta-analysis was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. In addition, a random-effects model was used to calculate the pooled Odds Ratio (ORs) and the corresponding confidence interval (95% CI). Heterogeneity was evaluated using The Cochran's Q heterogeneity test and I2 statistic. RESULTS: Six observational studies with 195,230 participants were included. In this meta-analysis, current use of PPIs increased risk of COVID-19 development (ORâ¯=â¯1.19; 95% CI: 0.62-2.28) and mortality (ORâ¯=â¯1.67; 95% CI: 1.41-1.97).

The development of effective antiviral compounds and vaccines requires detailed descriptive studies of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins. The SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein mediates virion binding to the human cells through its interaction with the ACE2 cell surface receptor and is one of the prime immunization targets. A functional virion is composed of three S1 and three S2 subunits created by furin cleavage of the spike protein at R682, a polybasic cleavage sites that differs from the SARS-CoV spike protein of 2002. We observe that the spike protein is O-glycosylated on a threonine (T678) near the furin cleavage site occupied by core-1 and core-2 structures. In addition, we have identified eight additional O-glycopeptides on the spike glycoprotein and we confirmed that the spike protein is heavily N-glycosylated. Our recently developed LC-MS/MS methodology allowed us to identify LacdiNAc structural motives on all occupied N-glycopeptides and polyLacNAc structures on six glycopeptides of the spike protein. In conclusion, our study substantially expands the current knowledge of the spike protein’s glycosylation and enables the investigation of the influence of the O-glycosylation on its proteolytic activation.","Sanda, Miloslav; Morrison, Lindsay; Goldman, Radoslav",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.05.187344; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32676595/,340
596130,Knowledge of Palliative Care in Ecuador,2021-04-30,"Understanding the ecological factors that drive animal density patterns in time and space is key to devising effective conservation strategies. In Tanzania, most chimpanzees (~75%) live outside national parks where human activities threaten their habitat’s integrity and connectivity. Mahale Mountains National Park (MMNP), therefore, is a critical area for chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) in the region due to its location and protective status. Yet, despite its importance and long history of chimpanzee research (>50 years), a park-wide census of the species has never been conducted. The park is categorized as a savanna-woodland mosaic, interspersed with riparian forest, wooded grassland, and bamboo thicket. This heterogeneous landscape offers an excellent opportunity to assess the ecological characteristics associated with chimpanzee density, a topic still disputed, which could improve conservation plans that protect crucial chimpanzee habitat outside the park. We examined the influence of fine-scale vegetative characteristics and topographical features on chimpanzee nest density, modeling nest counts using hierarchical distance sampling. We counted 335 nests in forest and woodland habitats across 102 transects in 13 survey sites. Nests were disproportionately found more in or near evergreen forests, on steep slopes, and in feeding tree species. We calculated chimpanzee density in MMNP to be 0.23 ind/km(2), although density varied substantially among sites (0.09–3.43 ind/km(2)). Density was associated with factors related to the availability of food and nesting trees, with topographic heterogeneity and the total basal area of feeding tree species identified as significant positive predictors. Species-rich habitats and floristic diversity likely play a principal role in shaping chimpanzee density within a predominately open landscape with low food abundance. Our results provide valuable baseline data for future monitoring efforts in MMNP and enhance our understanding of this endangered species’ density and distribution across Tanzania.","Chitayat, Adrienne B.; Wich, Serge A.; Lewis, Matthew; Stewart, Fiona A.; Piel, Alex K.",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0246628; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33577598/,340

This article examines service responses in Australia, exploring practitioners' accounts of adapting service delivery models in the early months of the pandemic. Data from a qualitatively enriched online survey of practitioners (n = 100) show the ways services rapidly shifted to engage with clients via remote, technology-mediated modes, as physical distancing requirements triggered rapid expansion in the use of phone, email, video calls and messaging, and many face-to-face interventions temporarily ceased. Many practitioners and service managers found that remote service delivery improved accessibility and efficiency. Others expressed concerns about their capacity to assess risk without face-to-face contact, and were unsure whether new service modalities would meet the needs of all client groups and reflect best practice. Findings attest to practitioners' mixed experiences during this period of rapid service innovation and change, and underline the importance of monitoring emerging approaches to establish which service adaptations are effective for different groups of people, and to determine good practice for combining remote and face-to-face service options in the longer term.","Cortis, Natasha; Smyth, Ciara; valentine, Kylie; Breckenridge, Jan; Cullen, Patricia",Br J Soc Work,https://doi.org/10.1093/bjsw/bcab105; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34393655/,340

The diagnosis of DIC was confirmed by an International Society of Thrombosis and Hemostasis score greater than or equal to 5. The maternal outcomes included the changes in organ function 24 h after ICU admission. The durations of hospital stay and ICU stay were recorded as secondary outcomes. Among 297 ICU admissions (median Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, 4) for obstetric diseases, there were 87 DIC cases, with an estimated DIC incidence of 87 per 87,580 deliveries. Postpartum hemorrhage was the leading disease associated with DIC (71, 81.6%), followed by hypertensive disorders (27, 31.0%), sepsis (15, 17.2%), acute fatty liver of pregnancy (11, 12.6%) and amniotic fluid embolism (10, 11.5%). Compared with patients without DIC, those with DIC had higher rates of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome/death (27.6% vs 4.8%, p = 0.000), organ failure (36.8% vs 24.3%, p = 0.029), among which organ failure included acute renal failure (32.2% vs 10.0%, p = 0.000), respiratory failure (16.1% vs 8.6%, p = 0.057), disturbance of consciousness (12.6% vs 2.4%, p = 0.000) and DIC group also had higher rates of massive transfusion (52.9% vs 21.9%, p = 0.000), hysterectomy (32.2% vs 15.7%, p = 0.001), longer ICU (4 days vs 2 days, p = 0.000) and hospital stays (14 days vs 11 days, p = 0.005). DIC and amniotic fluid embolism were independent risk factors for organ failure in patients admitted to the ICU. Postpartum hemorrhage was the leading cause of DIC associated organ failure in obstetrics admitted to the ICU.

We also explored the ability of ergothioneine, hercynine, or histidine to inhibit hyaluronan degradation. Rotational viscometry showed that ergothioneine decreased the degree of hyaluronan radical degradation in a dose-dependent manner. While histidine was shown to be potent in scavenging (•)OH radicals, however, hercynine was ineffective. In vivo results showed that the addition of each investigated agent to chitosan/hyaluronan membranes contributed to a more potent treatment of ischemic skin wounds in rabbits compared to untreated animals and animals treated only with chitosan/hyaluronan membranes.","Valachova, Katarina; Svik, Karol; Biro, Csaba; Collins, Maurice N.; Jurcik, Rastislav; Ondruska, Lubomir; Soltes, Ladislav",Polymers (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33383628/; https://doi.org/10.3390/polym13010095,340

In less developed settings, the WHO recommended guidelines are useful for initiating care, but are non-specific. Blood culture has low sensitivity, while radiological findings are non-specific and do not discriminate between viral and bacterial causes of pneumonia. In vaccine probe studies, efficacy is dependent on the specificity of the study outcome to detect pneumonia and the impact of the vaccine on the selected outcome, and may underestimate the true burden of bacterial pneumonia. The rising incidence of antibiotic resistance, emerging respiratory pathogens, potential replacement pneumococcal disease following widespread introduction of pneumococcal polysaccharide-protein conjugate vaccine, the limited specificity of chest radiography, and the poor sensitivity of blood culture are substantial obstacles to accurate surveillance.

Anecdotal evidence suggests this increase in neurosurgical survey dissemination has led to a phenomenon of survey fatigue, characterized by decreased response rates and reducing the quality of data. This paper aims to analyze the effect of COVID-19 on neurosurgery surveys and their response rates, and suggest strategies for improving survey data collection. Methods: A search was conducted on March 20, 2021, on Medline and EMBASE. This included the terms “neurosurgery,” “cranial surgery,” “spine surgery,” and “survey” and identified surveys written in English, on a neurosurgical topic, distributed to neurosurgeons, trainees, and medical students. Results were screened by two authors according to these inclusion criteria, and included articles were used for data extraction, univariable, and bivariable analysis with Fisher's exact-test, Wilcoxon rank-sum test, and Spearman's correlation. Results: We included 255 articles in our analysis, 32.3% of which were published during the COVID-19 pandemic. Surveys had an average of 25.6 (95% CI = 22.5–28.8) questions and were mostly multiple choice (78.8%). They were disseminated primarily by email (75.3%, 95% CI = 70.0–80.6%) and there was a significant increase in dissemination via social media during the pandemic (OR = 3.50, 95% CI = 1.30–12.0). COVID-19 surveys were distributed to more geographical regions than pre-pandemic surveys (2.1 vs. 1.5, P = 0.01) and had higher total responses (247.0 vs. 206.4, P = 0.01), but lower response rates (34.5 vs. 51.0%, P < 0.001) than pre-COVID-19 surveys. Conclusion: The rise in neurosurgical survey distribution during the COVID-19 pandemic has led to survey fatigue, reduced response rates, and data collection quality.

METHODS: The medical records of adult patients admitted to 2 hospitals who had an active CMO order at the time of death and received opioid dose escalations after CMO pronouncement were assessed in a retrospective cohort study. Patients were categorized into higher and lower opioid dose escalation groups according to an institutional palliative care symptom guide. A Cox proportional hazards model was constructed to test the associations between dose escalation group, patient sex, opioid naivety, palliative care consultation, and opioid dosage after CMO pronouncement (independent variables) and time to death (dependent variable). RESULTS: In the 71-patient cohort, 39 patients (54.9%) were male and 32 (45.1%) were female. The mean (SD) age of patients was 67.2 (16.6) years.

At the same time, 52.2% of them agreed that E-interviews allowed them to represent themselves accurately. 28.2% felt no stress at all with their E-interviews experience, while 41.2% felt little stressed and only 8.2% felt highly stressed. The factors that were independently and inversely associated with applicants’ level of stress with E-interviews experience were their ability to represent themselves during the interviews (p = 0.001), cost-savings (p < 0.001), their overall rating of the E-interviews quality (p = 0.007) and the speed of the internet connection (p < 0.006). CONCLUSION: Videoconferencing was implemented on an urgent basis during the COVID-19 pandemic in the medical residency application process in Saudi Arabia. It was perceived as an adequate and promising tool to replace in-person interviews in the future. Applicants’ satisfaction was mainly driven by good organization, cost-saving, and their ability to present themselves. Future studies to enhance this experience are warranted.

632429,A Review of Registered Randomized Controlled Trials for the Prevention of Obesity in Infancy,2021-03-02,"Factors affecting a residential unit's price are always of interest to homebuyers and building developers, especially in a city like Hong Kong which is known for expensive housing. Literature review indicates that the governing factors can be categorized into architectural and environmental attributes. Among different methods commonly used for pricing, the hedonic price approach is viewed as the most suitable. However, the successful use of this method requires that homebuyers know and choose the attributes. Whilst choosing architectural attributes are not a problem for homebuyers, the same does not apply to environmental attributes. Previous studies by the authors have proposed some simple indicators for quantifying the environmental attributes. Based upon the developed performance indicators and the transaction records of two representative housing estates (Royal Ascot = RA and City One Shatin = COS), details of the properties, including transaction prices, architectural particulars and environmental characteristics were numerically transformed for the hedonic price analysis. The analysis results revealed that the willingness to pay (percentage of house price in parenthesis) for architectural and environmental attributes was HK$302.3/ft(2) (5.8%) and HK$886.8/ft(2) (28.2%), respectively, for RA and HK$1672.7/ft(2) (31.9%) and HK$111.5/ft(2) (3.5%) for COS. It was found that elasticity of substitution (ES) of environmental attributes contributed 3.4–13.3% of the property price, compared to 0.6–5.5% for architectural attributes.","Fung, Y.W.; Lee, W.L.",Habitat Int,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287701/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.habitatint.2014.06.004; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0197397514000800; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0197397514000800,340
633810,Flexibility and Bed Margins of the Community of Madrid’s Hospitals during the First Wave of the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic,2021-03-28,"A key public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic is the mandate to stay home and practice physical distancing. In Canada, with essential activities such as grocery shopping, outdoor exercise and transportation, people need to be able to safely navigate dense, urban spaces while staying at least two metres or six feet apart. This pandemic has exacerbated the health inequities across neighbourhoods in cities like Toronto, Canada which are often segregated along racial and income lines. These inequities impact who has access to urban infrastructure that promotes health and quality of life. Safety in a time of COVID-19 goes beyond just exposure to the virus, it is complicated by notions of who belongs where, and who has access to what resources. The built environment has a role in maintaining and promoting physical and mental health during this pandemic and beyond it. This paper puts forwards three considerations for built environment interventions to promote health equitably: (i) addressing structural determinants of health and embedding anti-racist intersectional principles, (ii) revisiting tactical urbanism as a health promotion tool and (iii) rethinking community engagement processes through equity-based placemaking. This paper outlines four built environment interventions in Toronto, Canada that seek to address the challenges in navigating urban space safely in the short term, including street design that prioritizes pedestrians, protected cycling infrastructure, access to inclusive green space and safe, affordable housing. Longer-term strategies to create health-promoting urban environments that are equitable are discussed and may be valuable to other cities with similar urban equity concerns.","Hassen, Nadha",Health Promot Int,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34423362/; https://doi.org/10.1093/heapro/daab128,340

We retrospectively reviewed 46 COVID-19 patients with two consecutive negative RT-PCR tests after treatment. The cases were divided into moderate group and severe/critical group according to disease severity. Clinical and CT scanning data were collected. CT signs of pulmonary lesions and the score of lung involvement were expounded. Thirty-nine moderate cases and seven severe/critical cases were included. Residual pulmonary lesions were visible in CT images. Moderate patients showed peripheral lesions while severe/critical cases exhibited both central and peripheral lesions with all lobes involvement. Mixed ground glass opacity (GGO) and pulmonary consolidation were noted. A larger proportion of severe patients showed reticular pulmonary interstitium thickening. Air bronchogram, pleural effusion, vascular enlargement, bronchial wall thickening, bronchiectasis, pleural thickening and pleural adhesion were more frequently observed in severe/critical group. The severe/critical group showed higher CT score. Pulmonary lesions persisted even after twice consecutive negative nucleic acid tests. We strongly recommended regular follow-up of CT scans after nucleic acid tests conversion. Evaluation of complete remission should base on chest CT.","Fu, Zhao; Tang, Ningning; Chen, Yanqing; Ma, Longbai; Wei, Youyong; Lu, Yumin; Ye, Kun; Liu, Hang; Tang, Fen; Huang, Guangyi; Yang, Yingxia; Xu, Fan",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-68509-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32665633/,340
637333,SARS-CoV-2 Short-Time Infection Produces Relevant Cytopathic Effects in Vero E6 Cell Line,2021-08-26,"Abstract Human coronaviruses (HCV) are important pathogens responsible for respiratory, gastrointestinal and possibly neurological disorders. To better understand the molecular biology of the prototype HCV-229E strain, the nucleotide sequence of the 5'-unique regions of mRNAs 4 and 5 were determined from cloned cDNAs. Sequence analysis of the cDNAs synthesized from mRNA 4 revealed a major difference with previously published results. However, polymerase chain reaction amplification of this region showed that the sequenced cDNAs were produced from minor RNA species, an indication of possible genetic polymorphism in this region of the viral genome. The mutated messenger RNA 4 contains two ORFs: (1) ORF4a consisting of 132 nucleotides which potentially encodes a 44-amino acid polypeptide of 4653 Da; this coding sequence is preceded by a consensus transcriptional initiation sequence, CUAAACU, similar to the ones found upstream of the N and M genes; (2) ORF4b of 249 nucleotides potentially encoding an 83-amino acid basic and leucine-rich polypeptide of 9550 Da. On the other hand, mRNA 5 contains one single ORF of 231 nucleotides which could encode a 77-amino acid basic and leucine-rich polypeptide of 9046 Da. This putative protein presents a significant degree of amino acid homology (33%) with its counterpart found in transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV). The proteins in the two different viruses exhibit similar molecular weights and are extremely hydrophobic. Interestingly, a sequence homology of five amino acids was found between the protein encoded by ORF4b of HCV-229E and an immunologically important region of human myelin basic protein.","Jouvenne, Patricia; Mounir, Samir; Stewart, Janet N.; Richardson, Christopher D.; Talbot, Pierre J.",Virus Research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1373555/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/016817029290039C; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/016817029290039C,340

An analysis of resources shows that the credits allocated to it in 2020 correspond to only 17.2 % of the total allocated to research, the lowest ratio for at least 15 years. Another weakness of the hospital research support system is the way in which national health insurance credits are allocated. Bringing it into line with international best practices would mean entrusting the task of allocating these credits to a “Hospital Research Policy Council”, which should also be an actor in the implementation of national research programs. Another article addresses the organization of research. Recommendations are also made for a better functioning of the research system at the local level, including university hospitals, and at the national level.","Migus, Arnold; Ardaillou, Raymond; Berche, Patrick; Boitard, Christian; Clément, Bruno; Couvreur, Patrick; Debré, Patrice; Netter, Patrick",Bull Acad Natl Med,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0001407921001977; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.banm.2021.05.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34092797/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001407921001977?v=s5,340

The aim of our study is to compare the results between AP patients with and without COVID−19, and to reveal the effects of COVID−19 on the course, intensive care needs and mortality of AP patients. MATERIAL METHODS: This was a single-center, retrospective and observational study. Patients over 18 years of age, who were diagnosed with AP during the current pandemic. According to the RT-PCR test result, patients were divided into two groups: COVID-19 positive and COVID-19 negative. Gender, age, laboratory parameters, intensive care unit admission, length of hospital stay, severity and mortality of AP were compared between these two groups. RESULTS: We reviewed 562 patients presenting to the emergency department who were diagnosed with acute pancreatitis between 10.03.2020 and 31.12.2020 and included 189 patients in our study. Positive patients need for intensive care (7.23%) were higher compared to negative patients (0.94%). 32.53% of positive patients and 14.15% of negative patients had severe AP (p < 0.03). We established that being COVID-19 positive, CCI scores of ≥5, presence of COVID-19 compatible pneumonia on CT and BISAP scores had an effect on mortality (p < 0,05). CONCLUSION: The severity and mortality of AP increase in patients with both AP and COVID-19. This rate increases even more in the presence of COVID-19-associated pneumonia. We believe that new strategies should be developed for the follow-up and treatment of patients with both these conditions.","Karaali, Rezan; Topal, Firdes",Am J Emerg Med,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0735675721005295?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajem.2021.06.045; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34246968/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0735675721005295,340

647931,An Epidemiological Study on the Prevalence of the Clinical Features of SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Romanian People,2020-07-14,"BACKGROUND: Chronic pain affects about 20 % of the Canadian population and can lead to physical, psychological and social vulnerabilities. However, this condition remains poorly recognized and undertreated. During 2020, as the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted daily living and health care systems, the situation of people with chronic pain has drawn little public attention. METHODS: This qualitative study was part of a pan-Canadian mixed-methods project and aimed to understand the experiences and challenges of people living with chronic pain during the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada. Between May and August 2020, we conducted in-depth semi-structured interviews with 22 individuals living with chronic pain across the country. We used reflexive thematic analysis to interpret data. RESULTS: Our findings underscored four dimensions of the chronic pain experience during the pandemic: (1) Reinforced vulnerability due to uncertainties regarding pain and its management; (2) Social network as a determinant of pain and psychological condition; (3) Increasing systemic inequities intermingling with the chronic pain experience; (4) More viable living conditions due to confinement measures. Though several participants reported improvements in their quality of life and reduced social pressure in the context of stay-at-home orders, participants from socio-economically deprived groups and minorities reported more challenges in accessing pain relief, health care services, and psychosocial support. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed and intensified pre-existing disparities and challenges among people living with chronic pain in terms of material resources, psychosocial condition, social support, and access to care. In post-pandemic times, it will be essential to address flaws in health and welfare policies to foster equity and social inclusiveness of people with chronic pain.","Dassieu, Lise; Pagé, M.

648357,SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Screening in Healthcare Workers in Non-Infectious Hospitals in Two Different Regions of Southern Poland (Upper Silesia and Opole Voivodeships): A Prospective Cohort Study,2021-04-20,"BACKGROUND: Severe COVID-19 is characterised by inflammation and coagulation in the presence of complement system activation. We aimed to explore the potential benefit and safety of selectively blocking the anaphylatoxin and complement protein C5a with the monoclonal antibody IFX-1 (vilobelimab), in patients with severe COVID-19. METHODS: We did an exploratory, open-label, randomised phase 2 trial (part of the adaptive phase 2/3 PANAMO trial) of intravenous IFX-1 in adults with severe COVID-19 at three academic hospitals in the Netherlands. Eligibility criteria were age 18 years or older; severe pneumonia with pulmonary infiltrates consistent with pneumonia, a clinical history of severe shortness of breath within the past 14 days, or a need for non-invasive or invasive ventilation; severe disease defined as a ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fractional concentration of oxygen in inspired air (PaO(2)/FiO(2)) between 100 mm Hg and 250 mm Hg in the supine position; and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection confirmed by RT-PCR. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive IFX-1 (up to seven doses of 800 mg intravenously) plus best supportive care (IFX-1 group) or best supportive care only (control group). The primary outcome was the percentage change in PaO(2)/FiO(2) in the supine position between baseline and day 5. Mortality at 28 days and treatment-emergent and serious adverse events were key secondary outcomes. The primary analysis was done in the intention-to-treat population and safety analyses were done in all patients according to treatment received. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04333420). FINDINGS: Between March 31 and April 24, 2020, 30 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to the IFX-1 group (n=15) or the control group (n=15). During the study it became clear that several patients could not be assessed regularly in the supine position because of severe hypoxaemia. It was therefore decided to focus on all PaO(2)/FiO(2) assessments (irrespective of position). At day 5 after randomisation, the mean PaO(2)/FiO(2) (irrespective of position) was 158 mm Hg (SD 63; range 84–265) in the IFX-1 group and 189 mm Hg (89; 71–329) in the control group. Analyses of the least squares mean relative change in PaO(2)/FiO(2) at day 5 showed no differences between treatment groups (17% change in the IFX-1 group vs 41% in the control group; difference −24% [95% CI −58 to 9], p=0·15. Kaplan-Meier estimates of mortality by 28 days were 13% (95% CI 0–31) for the IFX-1 group and 27% (4–49) for the control group (adjusted hazard ratio for death 0·65 [95% CI 0·10–4·14]). The frequency of serious adverse events were similar between groups (nine [60%] in the IFX-1 group vs seven [47%] in the control group) and no deaths were considered related to treatment assignment. However, a smaller proportion of patients had pulmonary embolisms classed as serious in the IFX-1 group (two [13%]) than in the control group (six [40%]). Infections classed as serious were reported in three (20%) patients in the IFX-1 group versus five (33%) patients in the control group. INTERPRETATION: In this small exploratory phase 2 part of the PANAMO trial, C5a inhibition with IFX-1 appears to be safe in patients with severe COVID-19. The secondary outcome results in favour of IFX-1 are preliminary because the study was not powered on these endpoints, but they support the investigation of C5a inhibition with IFX-1 in a phase 3 trial using 28-day mortality as the primary endpoint.

649744,Factors Associated with SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Physician Trainees in New York City during the First COVID-19 Wave,2021-05-15,"Background The gold standard for COVID-19 diagnosis is detection of viral RNA through PCR. Due to global limitations in testing capacity, effective prioritization of individuals for testing is essential. Methods We devised a model estimating the probability of an individual to test positive for COVID-19 based on answers to 9 simple questions that have been associated with COVID-19 infection. Our model was devised from a subsample of a national symptom survey that was answered over 2 million times in Israel in its first 2 months and a targeted survey distributed to all residents of several cities in Israel. Overall, 43,752 adults were included, from which 498 self-reported as being COVID-19 positive. Findings Our model was validated on a held-out set of individuals from Israel where it achieved an auROC of 0.737 (CI: 0.712-0.759), auPR of 0.144 (CI: 0.119-0.177) and demonstrated its applicability outside of Israel in an independently-collected symptom survey dataset from the U.S., U.K. and Sweden. Our analyses revealed interactions between several symptoms and age, suggesting variation in the clinical manifestation of the disease in different age groups. Conclusions our tool can be used online and without exposure to suspected patients, thus suggesting worldwide utility in combating COVID-19 by better directing the limited testing resources through prioritization of individuals for testing, thereby increasing the rate at which positive individuals can be identified. Moreover, individuals at high risk for a positive test result can be isolated prior to testing.","Shoer, Saar; Karady, Tal; Keshet, Ayya; Shilo, Smadar; Rossman, Hagai; Gavrieli, Amir; Meir, Tomer; Lavon, Amit; Kolobkov, Dmitry; Kalka, Iris; Godneva, Anastasia; Cohen, Ori; Kariv, Adam; Hoch, Ori; Zer-Aviv, Mushon; Castel, Noam; Sudre, Carole; Zohar, Anat Ekka; Irony, Angela; Spector, Tim; Geiger, Benjamin; Hizi, Dorit; Shalev, Varda; Balicer, Ran; Segal, Eran",Med (N Y),https://doi.org/10.1016/j.medj.2020.10.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33073258/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666634020300192?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2666634020300192,340

We carried out a bibliometric analysis to describe the COVID-19 research output in Africa in terms of setting, study design, research themes and author affiliation. METHODS: We searched for articles published between 1 December 2019 and 3 January 2021 from various databases including PubMed, African Journals Online, medRxiv, Collabovid, the WHO global research database and Google. All article types and study design were included. RESULTS: A total of 1296 articles were retrieved. 46.6% were primary research articles, 48.6% were editorial-type articles while 4.6% were secondary research articles. 20.3% articles used the entire continent of Africa as their study setting while South Africa (15.4%) was the most common country-focused setting. The most common research topics include ‘country preparedness and response’ (24.9%) and ‘the direct and indirect health impacts of the pandemic’ (21.6%). However, only 1.0% of articles focus on therapeutics and vaccines. 90.3% of the articles had at least one African researcher as author, 78.5% had an African researcher as first author, while 63.5% had an African researcher as last author. The University of Cape Town leads with the greatest number of first and last authors. 13% of the articles were published in medRxiv and of the studies that declared funding, the Wellcome Trust was the top funding body. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights Africa’s COVID-19 research and the continent’s existing capacity to carry out research that addresses local problems. However, more studies focused on vaccines and therapeutics are needed to inform local development.

The performances of the test were analyzed on 575 serum samples including 192 from SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction–confirmed patients, 13 from seasonal coronaviruses, 70 from different inflammatory/autoimmune diseases, and 300 from healthy donors. Anti-S1 IgM were detected by monoplex ALBIA-IgM-S1. Comparison with chemiluminescent assays or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays was performed using commercial tests. Multiplex ALBIA-IgG-S1/N was effective in detecting and quantifying anti–SARS-CoV-2 IgG Abs. Two weeks after first symptoms, sensitivity and specificity were 97.7 and 98.0% (anti-S1), and 100 and 98.7% (anti-N), respectively. Agreement with commercial tests was good to excellent, with a higher sensitivity of ALBIA. ALBIA-IgG-S1/N was positive in 53% of patients up to day 7, and in 75% between days 7 and 13. For ALBIA-IgM-S1, sensitivity and specificity were 74.4 and 98.7%, respectively. Patients in intensive care units had higher IgG Ab levels (Mann–Whitney test, p < 0.05). ALBIA provides a robust method for exploring humoral immunity to SARS-CoV-2. Serology should be performed after 2 weeks following first symptoms, when all COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) patients had at least one anti-S1 or anti-N IgG Ab, illustrating the interest of a multiplex test.","Drouot, Laurent; Hantz, Sébastien; Jouen, Fabienne; Velay, Aurélie; Lamia, Bouchra; Veber, Benoit; Sibilia, Jean; Lotellier, Marlène; Candon, Sophie; Alain, Sophie; Fafi-Kremer, Samira; Boyer, Olivier",Front Microbiol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2020.603931; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33324387/,340
658575,"Is It Possible to Prevent Sars-Cov-2 Infection in a Non-Infectious Diseases Ward during the Pandemic on the Example of a Diabetes Clinic Institute of Rural Health, Lublin, Poland?",2021-07-16,"The ongoing outbreaks of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have resulted in unprecedented challenges to global health. To effectively contain the COVID-19 transmission, rapid tests for detecting existing SARS-CoV-2 infections and assessing virus spread are critical. To address the huge need for ever-increasing tests, we developed a facile all-in-one nucleic acid testing assay by combining Si-OH activated glass bead (aGB)-based viral RNA fast extraction and in situ colorimetric reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) detection in a single tube. aGBs demonstrate a strong ability to capture viral RNA in a guanidinium-based lysis buffer, and the purified aGBs/RNA composite, without RNA elution step, could be directly used to perform RT-LAMP assay. The assay was well characterized by using a novel SARS-CoV-2-like coronavirus GX/P2V, and showed a limit of detection (LOD) of 15 copies per µL in simulated clinical samples within 50 min. We further demonstrated our assay by testing simulated SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus samples, showing an LOD of 32 copies per µL and high specificity without cross-reactivity with the most closely related GX/P2V or host DNA/RNA. The all-in-one approach developed in this study has the potential as a simple, scalable, and time-saving alternative for point-of-care testing of SARS-CoV-2 in low-income regions, as well as a promising tool for at-home testing.","He, Yugan; Wang, Liqin; An, Xiaoping; Tong, Yigang",Analyst,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34505858/; https://doi.org/10.1039/d1an01043c,340
659887,"Assessment of Copper and Heavy Metals in Family-Run Vineyard Soils and Wines of Campania Region, South Italy",2021-08-11,"BACKGROUND: Currently, existing biomedical literature repositories do not commonly provide users with specific means to locate and remotely access biomedical databases. OBJECTIVE: To address this issue, we developed the Biomedical Database Inventory (BiDI), a repository linking to biomedical databases automatically extracted from the scientific literature. BiDI provides an index of data resources and a path to access them seamlessly. METHODS: We designed an ensemble of deep learning methods to extract database mentions. To train the system, we annotated a set of 1242 articles that included mentions of database publications. Such a data set was used along with transfer learning techniques to train an ensemble of deep learning natural language processing models targeted at database publication detection. RESULTS: The system obtained an F1 score of 0.929 on database detection, showing high precision and recall values. When applying this model to the PubMed and PubMed Central databases, we identified over 10,000 unique databases. The ensemble model also extracted the weblinks to the reported databases and discarded irrelevant links. For the extraction of weblinks, the model achieved a cross-validated F1 score of 0.908. We show two use cases: one related to “omics” and the other related to the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: BiDI enables access to biomedical resources over the internet and facilitates data-driven research and other scientific initiatives. The repository is openly available online and will be regularly updated with an automatic text processing pipeline. The approach can be reused to create repositories of different types (ie, biomedical and others).","Rosado, Eduardo; Garcia-Remesal, Miguel; Paraiso-Medina, Sergio; Pazos, Alejandro; Maojo, Victor",JMIR Med Inform,https://doi.org/10.2196/22976; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33629960/,340
660409,Worldviews on Evidence-Based Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Using a Novel Method,2021-09-10,"Supply shortages of N95 respirators during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic have motivated institutions to develop feasible and effective N95 respirator reuse strategies. In particular, heat decontamination is a treatment method that scales well and can be implemented in settings with variable or limited resources. Prior studies using multiple inactivation methods, however, have often focused on a single virus under narrowly defined conditions, making it difficult to develop guiding principles for inactivating emerging or difficult-to-culture viruses. We systematically explored how temperature, humidity, and virus deposition solutions impact the inactivation of viruses deposited and dried on N95 respirator coupons. We exposed four virus surrogates across a range of structures and phylogenies, including two bacteriophages (MS2 and phi6), a mouse coronavirus (murine hepatitis virus [MHV]), and a recombinant human influenza A virus subtype H3N2 (IAV), to heat treatment for 30 min in multiple deposition solutions across several temperatures and relative humidities (RHs). We observed that elevated RH was essential for effective heat inactivation of all four viruses tested. For heat treatments between 72°C and 82°C, RHs greater than 50% resulted in a >6-log(10) inactivation of bacteriophages, and RHs greater than 25% resulted in a >3.5-log(10) inactivation of MHV and IAV. Furthermore, deposition of viruses in host cell culture media greatly enhanced virus inactivation by heat and humidity compared to other deposition solutions, such as phosphate-buffered saline, phosphate-buffered saline with bovine serum albumin, and human saliva. Past and future heat treatment methods must therefore explicitly account for deposition solutions as a factor that will strongly influence observed virus inactivation rates. Overall, our data set can inform the design and validation of effective heat-based decontamination strategies for N95 respirators and other porous surfaces, especially for emerging viruses that may be of immediate and future public health concern. IMPORTANCE Shortages of personal protective equipment, including N95 respirators, during the coronavirus (CoV) disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic have highlighted the need to develop effective decontamination strategies for their reuse. This is particularly important in health care settings for reducing exposure to respiratory viruses, like severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes COVID-19. Although several treatment methods are available, a widely accessible strategy will be necessary to combat shortages on a global scale. We demonstrate that the combination of heat and humidity inactivates a range of RNA viruses, including both viral pathogens and common viral pathogen surrogates, after deposition on N95 respirators and achieves the necessary virus inactivation detailed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration guidelines to validate N95 respirator decontamination technologies. We further demonstrate that depositing viruses onto surfaces when suspended in culture media can greatly enhance observed inactivation, adding caution to how heat and humidity treatment methods are validated.","Rockey, Nicole; Arts, Peter J.; Li, Lucinda; Harrison, Katherine R.; Langenfeld, Kathryn; Fitzsimmons, William J.; Lauring, Adam S.; Love, Nancy G.; Kaye, Keith S.; Raskin, Lutgarde; Roberts, William W.; Hegarty, Bridget; Wigginton, Krista R.",mSphere,https://doi.org/10.1128/msphere.00588-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33087516/,340
660638,Coronavirus Outbreak and Stress in Iranians,2020-06-20,"In humans, killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs), expressed on natural killer (NK) and thymus-derived (T) cells, and their ligands, primarily the classical class I molecules of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) expressed on nearly all cells, are both polymorphic. The variation of this receptor-ligand interaction, based on which alleles have been inherited, is known to play crucial roles in resistance to infectious disease, autoimmunity, and reproduction in humans. However, not all the variation in response is inherited, since KIR binding can be affected by a portion of the peptide bound to the class I molecules, with the particular peptide presented affecting the NK response. The extent to which the large multigene family of chicken immunoglobulin-like receptors (ChIRs) is involved in functions similar to KIRs is suspected but not proven. However, much is understood about the two MHC-I molecules encoded in the chicken MHC. The BF2 molecule is expressed at a high level and is thought to be the predominant ligand of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), while the BF1 molecule is expressed at a much lower level if at all and is thought to be primarily a ligand for NK cells. Recently, a hierarchy of BF2 alleles with a suite of correlated properties has been defined, from those expressed at a high level on the cell surface but with a narrow range of bound peptides to those expressed at a lower level on the cell surface but with a very wide repertoire of bound peptides. Interestingly, there is a similar hierarchy for human class I alleles, although the hierarchy is not as wide. It is a question whether KIRs and ChIRs recognize class I molecules with bound peptide in a similar way, and whether fastidious to promiscuous hierarchy of class I molecules affect both T and NK cell function. Such effects might be different from those predicted by the similarities of peptide-binding based on peptide motifs, as enshrined in the idea of supertypes. Since the size of peptide repertoire can be very different for alleles with similar peptide motifs from the same supertype, the relative importance of these two properties may be testable.","Kaufman, Jim",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33381122/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2020.601089,340
660906,Current Update on the Clinical Utility of MMSE and MoCA for Stroke Patients in Asia: A Systematic Review,2021-08-25,"The current COVID-19 pandemic began in December 2019 in Wuhan (China) and rapidly extended to become a global sanitary and economic emergency. Its etiological agent is the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. COVID-19 presents a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations, which ranges from an asymptomatic infection to a severe pneumonia accompanied by multisystemic failure that can lead to a patient's death. The immune response to SARS-CoV-2 is known to involve all the components of the immune system that together appear responsible for viral elimination and recovery from the infection. Nonetheless, such immune responses are implicated in the disease's progression to a more severe and lethal process. This review describes the general aspects of both COVID-19 and its etiological agent SARS-CoV-2, stressing the similarities with other severe coronavirus infections, such as SARS and MERS, but more importantly, pointing toward the evidence supporting the hypothesis that the clinical spectrum of COVID-19 is a consequence of the corresponding variable spectrum of the immune responses to the virus. The critical point where progression of the disease ensues appears to center on loss of the immune regulation between protective and altered responses due to exacerbation of the inflammatory components. Finally, it appears possible to delineate certain major challenges deserving of exhaustive investigation to further understand COVID-19 immunopathogenesis, thus helping to design more effective diagnostic, therapeutic, and prophylactic strategies.","García, Luis F.",Front Immunol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2020.01441; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32612615/,340

One open question is whether genetics could influence the severity of symptoms. Considering the limited data on cancer patients, we analyzed public data repositories limited to investigate angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) expressions and genetic variants to identify the basis of individual susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. Gene expression and variant data were retrieved from Tissue Cancer Genome Atlas, Genotype-Tissue Expression, and gnomAD. Differences in gene expression were tested with Mann-Whitney U-test. Allele frequencies of germline variants were explored in different ethnicities, with a special focus on ACE2 variants located in the binding site to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The analysis of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expressions in healthy tissues showed a higher expression in the age class 20 to 59 years (false discovery rate [FDR] < 0.0001) regardless of gender. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were more expressed in tumors from males than females (both FDR < 0.0001) and, opposite to the regulation in tissues from healthy individuals, more expressed in elderly patients (FDR = 0.005; FDR < 0.0001, respectively). ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expressions were higher in cancers of elderly patients compared with healthy individuals (FDR < 0.0001). Variants were present at low frequency (range 0% to 3%) and among those with the highest frequency, the variant S19P belongs to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binding site and it was exclusively present in Africans with a frequency of 0.2%. The mechanisms of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 regulation could be targeted for preventive and therapeutic purposes in the whole population and especially in cancer patients. Further studies are needed to show a direct correlation of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expressions in cancer patients and the incidence of COVID-19.","Ravaioli, Sara; Tebaldi, Michela; Fonzi, Eugenio; Angeli, Davide; Mazza, Massimiliano; Nicolini, Fabio; Lucchesi, Alessandro; Fanini, Francesca; Pirini, Francesca; Tumedei, Maria Maddalena; Cerchione, Claudio; Viale, Pierluigi; Sambri, Vittorio; Martinelli, Giovanni; Bravaccini, Sara",Cell Transplant,https://doi.org/10.1177/0963689720968749; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33108902/,340

Objective: To determine the geographic accessibility to SARS-CoV-2 testing sites in the United States, as quantified by travel time. Design: Cross-sectional analysis of SARS-CoV-2 testing sites as of April 7, 2020 in relation to travel time. Setting: United States COVID-19 pandemic. Participants: The United States, including the 48 contiguous states and the District of Columbia. Exposures: Population density, percent minority, percent uninsured, and median income by county from the 2018 American Community Survey demographic data. Main Outcome: SARS-CoV-2 testing sites identified in two national databases (Carbon Health and CodersAgainstCovid), geocoded by address. Median county 1 km2 gridded friction surface of travel times, as a measure of geographic accessibility to SARS-CoV-2 testing sites. Results: 6,236 unique SARS-CoV-2 testing sites in 3,108 United States counties were identified. Thirty percent of the U.S. population live in a county (N = 1,920) with a median travel time over 20 minutes. This was geographically heterogeneous; 86% of the Mountain division population versus 5% of the Middle Atlantic population lived in counties with median travel times over 20 min. Generalized Linear Models showed population density, percent minority, percent uninsured and median income were predictors of median travel time to testing sites. For example, higher percent uninsured was associated with longer travel time (B= 0.41 min/percent, 95% confidence interval 0.3-0.53, p = 1.2x10-12), adjusting for population density. Conclusions and Relevance: Geographic accessibility to SARS-Cov-2 testing sites is reduced in counties with lower population density and higher percent of minority and uninsured, which are also risk factors for worse healthcare access and outcomes. Geographic barriers to SARS-Cov-2 testing may exacerbate health inequalities and bias county-specific transmission estimates. Geographic accessibility should be considered when planning the location of future testing sites and interpreting epidemiological data.","Rader, B.; Astley, C. M.; Sy, K. T.

Food safety ensures reduced food losses and, therefore, contributes to food security. Although there have been extensive studies on the food industry with different perspectives, no study has so far been conducted on the challenges in terms of the food security. The present study is a qualitative one conducted in 2019 in one of the largest agricultural production chain companies in Khorasan Razavi province, Iran. RESULTS: The research method was based on the conventional content analysis. Triangulation method was used for the data collection being a combination of the participant observations, focus group discussions (17 managers) and semi-structured interviews with the president of the company. Participants believed that their company plays an important role and has a prestigious position in the food security of Iran. However, the main challenges of the company are regulatory system, food safety risks, market unpredictability, traditional management and sanctions. CONCLUSIONS: The company is highly resilient to all these challenges; however, the traditional management is still a serious disadvantage. This leads to the managers’ burnout along with the company survival problem, removing unfair sanctions and protecting agricultural development in developing countries is a necessity. In general, paying attention to the modern organizational management of these companies and their survival is an essential policy. For this reason, it is suggested that trust must be established between policymakers and companies on one hand and relationship between the academia and such companies to promote the organizational management on the other hand.","Sadati, Ahmad Kalateh; Nayedar, Mehdi; Zartash, Leila; Falakodin, Zahra",Agric Food Secur,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40066-021-00304-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34642601/,340

It is one of the largest and most widely used primary health care EHR databases in Australia. This study examined the validity of algorithms that use information from various fields in the MedicineInsight data to indicate whether patients have specific health conditions. This study examined the validity of MedicineInsight algorithms for five common chronic conditions: anxiety, asthma, depression, osteoporosis and type 2 diabetes. METHODS: Patients’ disease status according to MedicineInsight algorithms was benchmarked against the recording of diagnoses in the original EHRs. Fifty general practices contributing data to MedicineInsight met the eligibility criteria regarding patient load and location. Five were randomly selected and four agreed to participate. Within each practice, 250 patients aged ≥ 40 years were randomly selected from the MedicineInsight database. Trained staff reviewed the original EHR for as many of the selected patients as possible within the time available for data collection in each practice. RESULTS: A total of 475 patients were included in the analysis. All the evaluated MedicineInsight algorithms had excellent specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value (above 0.9) when benchmarked against the recording of diagnoses in the original EHR. The asthma and osteoporosis algorithms also had excellent sensitivity, while the algorithms for anxiety, depression and type 2 diabetes yielded sensitivities of 0.85, 0.89 and 0.89 respectively.

COXs/PGE(2) signaling pathways have also been demonstrated to have proviral or antiviral effects, which appeared different even in the same virus family. A porcine sapovirus Cowden strain, a member of genus Sapovirus within the Caliciviridae family, induces strong COX-2/PGE(2) but transient COX-1/PGE(2) signaling to enhance virus replication. However, whether infections of other viruses in the different genera activate COXs/PGE(2) signaling, and thus affect the replication of viruses, remains unknown. In the present study, infections of cells with the feline calicivirus (FCV) F9 strain in the genus Vesivirus and murine norovirus (MNV) CW-1 strain in the genus Norovirus only activated the COX-2/PGE(2) signaling in a time-dependent manner. Treatment with pharmacological inhibitors or transfection of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) against COX-2 enzyme significantly reduced the production of PGE(2) as well as FCV and MNV replications. The inhibitory effects of these pharmacological inhibitors against COX-2 enzyme on the replication of both viruses were restored by the addition of PGE(2). Silencing of COX-1 via siRNAs and inhibition of COX-1 via an inhibitor also decrease the production of PGE(2) and replication of both viruses, which can be attributed to the inhibition COX-1/PGE(2) signaling pathway. These data indicate that the COX-2/PGE(2) signaling pathway has proviral effects for the replication of FCV and MNV, and pharmacological inhibitors against these enzymes serve as potential therapeutic candidates for treating FCV and MNV infections.","Alfajaro, Mia Madel; Cho, Eun-Hyo; Park, Jun-Gyu; Kim, Ji-Yun; Soliman, Mahmoud; Baek, Yeong-Bin; Kang, Mun-Il; Park, Sang-Ik; Cho, Kyoung-Oh",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0200726; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30021004/,340

Blockade of the gut-tropic integrin α4β7 and its subunits has been exploited as a therapeutic target in IBD. Natalizumab (anti-α4) is approved for moderate to severe Crohn’s disease (CD), but its use is limited due to potential risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy.

The attacks of 11 September 2001 and the ensuing anthrax mailings of 2001 highlighted the public health readiness and response hurdles posed by intentionally caused injury and illness. At the same time, recent natural disasters have highlighted the need for comparable public health readiness and response capabilities. Public health readiness and response activities can be conceptualized similarly for intentional attacks, natural disasters, and human-caused accidents. Consistent with this view, the federal government has adopted the all-hazards response model as its fundamental paradigm. Adoption of this paradigm provides powerful improvements in efficiency and efficacy, because it reduces the need to create a complex family of situation-specific preparedness and response activities. However, in practice, public health preparedness requires additional models and tools to provide a framework to better understand and prioritize emergency readiness and response needs, as well as to facilitate solutions; this is particularly true at the local health department level. Here, we propose to extend the use of the Haddon matrix—a conceptual model used for more than two decades in injury prevention and response strategies—for this purpose.","Barnett, Daniel J.; Balicer, Ran D.; Blodgett, David; Fews, Ayanna L.; Parker, Cindy L.; Links, Jonathan M.",Environ Health Perspect,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15866764/,340

While the genetic structure of the Heinsberg outbreak indicates a clonal origin, reflective of superspreading dynamics during the carnival season, distinct viral strains are circulating in Dusseldorf, reflecting the city's international links. Limited detection of Heinsberg strains in the Dusseldorf area despite geographical proximity may reflect efficient containment and contact tracing efforts.","Walker, A.; Houwaart, T.; Wienemann, T.; Kohns Vasconcelos, M.; Strelow, D.; Senff, T.; HuÌlse, L.; Adams, O.; Andree, M.; Hauka, S.; Feldt, T.; Jensen, B.-E.; Keitel, V.; Kindgen-Milles, D.; Timm, J.; Pfeffer, K.; Dilthey, A.

688448,Predicting SARS-CoV-2 Weather-Induced Seasonal Virulence from Atmospheric Air Enthalpy,2020-12-04,"In the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe, many patients were treated in hospitals using mechanical ventilation. However, due to a shortage of ICU ventilators, hospitals worldwide needed to deploy anesthesia machines for ICU ventilation (which is off-label use). A joint guidance was written to apply anesthesia machines for long-term ventilation. The goal of this research is to retrospectively evaluate the differences in measurable ventilation parameters between the ICU ventilator and the anesthesia machine as used for COVID-19 patients. In this study, we included 32 patients treated in March and April 2020, who had more than 3 days of mechanical ventilation, either in the regular ICU with ICU ventilators (Hamilton S1), or in the temporary emergency ICU with anesthetic ventilators (Aisys, GE). The data acquired during regular clinical treatment was collected from the Patient Data Management Systems. Available ventilation parameters (pressures and volumes: PEEP, P(peak) , P(insp) , V(tidal) ), monitored parameters EtCO(2), SpO(2) , derived compliance C, and resistance R were processed and analyzed. A sub-analysis was performed to compare closed-loop ventilation (INTELLiVENT-ASV) to other ventilation modes. The results showed no major differences in the compared parameters, except for P(insp) . PEEP was reduced over time in the with Hamilton treated patients. This is most likely attributed to changing clinical protocol as more clinical experience and literature became available. A comparison of compliance between the 2 ventilators could not be made due to variances in the measurement of compliance. Closed loop ventilation could be used in 79% of the time, resulting in more stable EtCO(2) . From the analysis it can be concluded that the off-label usage of the anesthetic ventilator in our hospital did not result in differences in ventilation parameters compared to the ICU treatment in the first 4 days of ventilation.","Dijkman, Wouter M.; van Acht, Niels M.

690753,Provision of Assistive Technology for Students with Disabilities in South African Higher Education,2021-04-08,"Knowledge, technology, and society as well as natural systems are increasingly coherent and complex, and new systems are continuously formed at their interfaces. Convergence is a problem-solving strategy to holistically understand, create, and transform a system for reaching a common goal, such as advancing an emerging technology in society. The systems may be either in natural, scientific, technological, economic, or societal settings. Convergence offers a unifying strategy applicable to all systems that can be modeled as evolving neural-like networks. The paper presents an overview of the convergence science including underlying theories, principles, and methods and illustrates its implementation in key areas of application. The convergence approach begins with deep integration of previously separated fields, communities, and modes of thinking, to form and improve a new system, from where solutions divergence to previously unattainable applications and outcomes. The worldwide science and technology (S&T) landscape is changing at the beginning of the twenty-first century because of convergence. First, there is the affirmation of three transdisciplinary general-purpose technologies—nanotechnology, digital technology, and artificial intelligence (AI). A second main characteristics is the deep integration of five foundational science and technology fields (NBICA: nanoscale, modern biology, information, cognition, and artificial intelligence) from their basic elements—atoms, genes, bits, neurons, and logic steps and their collective action—to address global challenges and opportunities. The affirmation of nanotechnology at the confluence of disciplines toward systematic control of matter at the nanoscale has been an enabling inspiration and foundation for other S&T fields, emerging industries, and convergence solutions in society. Several future opportunities for implementation of convergence principles are the global S&T system, realizing sustainable society, advancing human capabilities, and conflict resolution.","Roco, Mihail C.",J Nanopart Res,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11051-020-05032-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33106748/,340
