204,204,204,Cross-subtype Immunity against Avian Influenza in Persons Recently Vaccinated for Influenza,12.83674,10.734229,2008-01-11,"Avian influenza virus (H5N1) can be transmitted to humans, resulting in a severe or fatal disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate the immune cross-reactivity between human and avian influenza (H5N1) strains in healthy donors vaccinated for seasonal influenza A (H1N1)/(H3N2). A small frequency of CD4 T cells specific for subtype H5N1 was detected in several persons at baseline, and seasonal vaccine administration enhanced the frequency of such reactive CD4 T cells. We also observed that seasonal vaccination is able to raise neutralizing immunity against influenza (H5N1) in a large number of donors. No correlation between influenza-specific CD4 T cells and humoral responses was observed. N1 may possibly be a target for both cellular and humoral cross-type immunity, but additional experiments are needed to clarify this point. These findings highlight the possibility of boosting cross-type cellular and humoral immunity against highly pathogenic avian influenza A virus subtype H5N1 by seasonal influenza vaccination.","Gioia, Cristiana; Castilletti, Concetta; Tempestilli, Massimo; Piacentini, Paola; Bordi, Licia; Chiappini, Roberta; Agrati, Chiara; Squarcione, Salvatore; Ippolito, Giuseppe; Puro, Vincenzo; Capobianchi, Maria R.; Poccia, Fabrizio",Emerg Infect Dis,107,3

287,287,287,Increased Host Species Diversity and Decreased Prevalence of Sin Nombre Virus,12.63313,10.625489,2009-07-11,"Emerging outbreaks of zoonotic diseases are affecting humans at an alarming rate. Until the ecological factors associated with zoonoses are better understood, disease emergence will continue. For Lyme disease, disease suppression has been demonstrated by a dilution effect, whereby increasing species diversity decreases disease prevalence in host populations. To test the dilution effect in another disease, we examined 17 ecological variables associated with prevalence of the directly transmitted Sin Nombre virus (genus Hantavirus, etiologic agent of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome) in its wildlife host, the deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus). Only species diversity was statistically linked to infection prevalence: as species diversity decreased, infection prevalence increased. The increase was moderate, but prevalence increased exponentially at low levels of diversity, a phenomenon described as zoonotic release. The results suggest that species diversity affects disease emergence.","Dizney, Laurie J.; Ruedas, Luis A.",Emerg Infect Dis,107,3
1208,1208,1208,Transmission Potential of Rift Valley Fever Virus over the Course of the 2010 Epidemic in South Africa,12.426827,10.751196,2013-06-11,"A Rift Valley fever (RVF) epidemic affecting animals on domestic livestock farms was reported in South Africa during January–August 2010. The first cases occurred after heavy rainfall, and the virus subsequently spread countrywide. To determine the possible effect of environmental conditions and vaccination on RVF virus transmissibility, we estimated the effective reproduction number (R(e)) for the virus over the course of the epidemic by extending the Wallinga and Teunis algorithm with spatial information. R(e) reached its highest value in mid-February and fell below unity around mid-March, when vaccination coverage was 7.5%–45.7% and vector-suitable environmental conditions were maintained. The epidemic fade-out likely resulted first from the immunization of animals following natural infection or vaccination. The decline in vector-suitable environmental conditions from April onwards and further vaccination helped maintain R(e) below unity. Increased availability of vaccine use data would enable evaluation of the effect of RVF vaccination campaigns.","Métras, Raphaëlle; Baguelin, Marc; Edmunds, W.

We evaluated the potential of a stockpiled A(H5N1) A/Anhui/1/2005 (clade 2.3.4) vaccine to elicit cross-reactive antibody responses to these emerging viruses. Sera from subjects who received 2 doses of MF59-adjuvanted A/Anhui/1/2005, or 1 dose of MF59-adjuvanted A/Anhui/1/2005 following priming with a clade 1 vaccine were characterized by microneutralization assays and modified hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays. Only heterologous prime-boost vaccination induced modest cross-reactive HI antibody responses to H5Nx viruses. Heterologous prime-boost may provide a more effective vaccination strategy to broaden the antibody responses to emerging viruses.","Levine, Min Z; Holiday, Crystal; Liu, Feng; Jefferson, Stacie; Gillis, Eric; Bellamy, Abbie R; Tumpey, Terrence; Katz, Jacqueline M",J Infect Dis,107,3

Antibody responses in survivors 11 years after infection have been documented. However, this report is the first characterization of anti-Ebola virus antibody persistence and neutralization capacity 40 years after infection. Using ELISAs we measured survivor’s immunological response to Ebola virus Zaire (EBOV) glycoprotein and nucleoprotein, and assessed VP40 reactivity. Neutralization of EBOV was measured using a pseudovirus approach and plaque reduction neutralization test with live EBOV. Some survivors from the original EBOV outbreak still harbor antibodies against all 3 measures. Interestingly, a subset of these survivors’ serum antibodies could still neutralize live virus 40 years postinitial infection. These data provide the longest documentation of both anti-Ebola serological response and neutralization capacity within any survivor cohort, extending the known duration of response from 11 years postinfection to at least 40 years after symptomatic infection.","Rimoin, Anne W; Lu, Kai; Bramble, Matthew S; Steffen, Imke; Doshi, Reena H; Hoff, Nicole A; Mukadi, Patrick; Nicholson, Bradly P; Alfonso, Vivian H; Olinger, Gerrard; Sinai, Cyrus; Yamamoto, Lauren K; Ramirez, Christina M; Okitolonda Wemakoy, Emile; Kebela Illunga, Benoit; Pettitt, James; Logue, James; Bennett, Richard S; Jahrling, Peter; Heymann, David L; Piot, Peter; Muyembe-Tamfum, Jean Jacques; Hensley, Lisa E; Simmons, Graham",J Infect Dis,107,3

7177,7177,7177,Viral Interference: The Case of Influenza Viruses,12.857686,10.567802,2015-12-01,"BACKGROUND. We examined associations between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of IFITM3, TLR3, and CD55 genes and influenza clinical outcomes in Chinese. METHODS. A multicenter study was conducted on 275 adult cases of avian (H7N9) and pandemic (H1N1(pdm09)) influenza. Host DNA was extracted from diagnostic respiratory samples; IFITM3 rs12252, TLR3 rs5743313, CD55 rs2564978, and TLR4 rs4986790/4986791 were targeted for genotyping (Sanger sequencing). The primary outcome analyzed was death. RESULTS. IFITM3 and TLR3 SNPs were in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium; their allele frequencies (IFITM3/C-allele 0.56, TLR3/C-allele 0.88) were comparable to 1000 Genomes Han Chinese data. We found over-representation of homozygous IFITM3 CC (54.5% vs 33.2%; P = .02) and TLR3 CC (93.3% vs 76.9%; P = .04) genotypes among fatal cases. Recessive genetic models showed their significant independent associations with higher death risks (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 2.78, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.29–6.02, and aHR 4.85, 95% CI 1.11−21.06, respectively). Cumulative effects were found (aHR 3.53, 95% CI 1.64−7.59 per risk genotype; aHR 9.99, 95% CI 1.27−78.59 with both). Results were consistent for each influenza subtype and other severity indicators. The CD55 TT genotype was linked to severity. TLR4 was nonpolymorphic. CONCLUSIONS. Host genetic factors may influence clinical outcomes of avian and pandemic influenza infections. Such findings have important implications on disease burden and patient care in at-risk populations.","Lee, Nelson; Cao, Bin; Ke, Changwen; Lu, Hongzhou; Hu, Yunwen; Tam, Claudia Ha Ting; Ma, Ronald Ching Wan; Guan, Dawei; Zhu, Zhaoqin; Li, Hui; Lin, Mulei; Wong, Rity Y.

Fragile X-related protein 1 (FXR1P), which plays an important role in normal muscle development, is one of the two autosomal paralogs of FMRP. To understand the functions of FXR1P, we screened FXR1P-interacting proteins by using a yeast two-hybrid system. The fragile X-related gene 1 (FXR1) was fused to pGBKT7 and then used as the bait to screen the human fetal brain cDNA library. The screening results revealed 10 FXR1P-interacting proteins including Bcl-2-associated transcription factor 1 (BTF). The interaction between FXR1P and BTF was confirmed by using both β-galactosidase assay and growth test in selective media. Co-immunoprecipitation assay in mammalian cells was also carried out to confirm the FXR1P/BTF interaction. Moreover, we confirmed that BTF co-localized with FXR1P in the cytoplasm around the nucleus in rat vascular smooth muscle cells by using confocal fluorescence microscopy. These results provide clues to elucidate the relationship between FXR1P and FXS.","Ma, Yun; Wang, Changbo; Li, Binyuan; Qin, Lingxue; Su, Jiao; Yang, Manjun; He, Shuya",Acta Biochim Biophys Sin (Shanghai),107,3

These include defining proper goals of intensive care treatment, managing acute respiratory failure with diverse differential considerations, treating immunologic side-effects of ever new and innovative cancer therapies, as well as numerous clinical scenarios which may exclusively arise in cancer patients. To help clinicians handle such challenges, the initiative Intensive Care in Hematologic and Oncologic Patients (iCHOP) has been dealing with these topics for several years. Supported by several Austrian and German medical societies of intensive care medicine, hematology and oncology, the first “Consensus statement for cancer patients requiring intensive care support” has only recently been released. Acute respiratory failure and its management continues to be a major focus in critically ill cancer patients due to its frequency and its prognostic impact. While noninvasive oxygenation strategies were considered the gold standard of therapy, more recent high-quality data do not show clinical benefits of such techniques including high flow nasal oxygen. On the contrary, several studies revealed an unidentified etiology of an acute respiratory failure as the only potentially modifiable risk factor for adverse outcome. Consequently, evidence-based and rigorously applied diagnostic algorithms are of utmost importance in these patients. Furthermore, intensivists are increasingly confronted with the rising incidence of various and new immunotherapy-associated toxicities and their management.","Wohlfarth, P.; Schellongowski, P.",Med Klin Intensivmed Notfmed,107,20
13335,13335,13335,Effect of Influenza A(H5N1) Vaccine Prepandemic Priming on CD4(+) T-Cell Responses,12.787949,10.5471,2014-11-06,"INTRODUCTION: Community detection of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders (ADRD) is a challenge. While Gold Standard assessments are commonly used in research centers, these methods are time consuming, require extensive training, and are not practical in most clinical settings or in community-based research projects. Many of these methods require an informant (e.g., spouse, adult child) to provide ratings of the patients’ cognitive and functional abilities. A patient-reported outcome that captures the presence of cognitive impairment and corresponds to Gold Standard assessments could improve case ascertainment, clinical care, and recruitment into clinical research. We tested the patient version of the Quick Dementia Rating System (QDRS) as a patient-reported outcome to detect MCI and ADRD. METHODS: The patient QDRS was validated in a sample of 261 consecutive patient-caregiver dyads compared with the informant version of the QDRS, the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR), neuropsychological tests, and Gold Standard measures of function, behavior, and mood. Psychometric properties including item variability, floor and ceiling effects, construct, concurrent, and known-groups validity, and internal consistency were determined. RESULTS: The patient QDRS strongly correlated with Gold Standard measures of cognition, function, mood, behavior, and global staging methods (p-values < .001) and had strong psychometric properties with excellent data quality and internal consistency (Cronbach alpha = 0.923, 95%CI:0.91–0.94). The patient QDRS had excellent agreement with the informant QDRS, the CDR and its sum of boxes (Intraclass Correlation Coefficients: 9.781–0.876). Receiver operator characteristic curves showed excellent discrimination between normal controls from CDR 0.5 (AUC:0.820;95% CI: 0.74–0.90) and for normal controls from any cognitive impairment (AUC:0.885;95% CI: 0.83–0.94). DISCUSSION: The patient QDRS validly and reliably differentiates individuals with and without cognitive impairment and can be completed by patients through all stages of dementia. The patient QDRS is highly correlated with Gold Standard measures of cognitive, function, behavior, and global staging. The patient QDRS provides a rapid method to screen patients for MCI and ADRD in clinical practice, determine study eligibility, improve case ascertainment in community studies.","Galvin, James E.; Tolea, Magdalena I.; Chrisphonte, Stephanie",PLoS One,107,3

Scalable conversational agents, designed to assist health care professionals, may play a significant role in supporting this collaboration in a scalable way by reaching out to the everyday lives of patients and their family members. However, to date, it remains unclear whether conversational agents, in such a role, would be accepted and whether they can support this multistakeholder collaboration. OBJECTIVE: With asthma in children representing a relevant target of chronic disease management, this study had the following objectives: (1) to describe the design of MAX, a conversational agent–delivered asthma intervention that supports health care professionals targeting child-parent teams in their everyday lives; and (2) to assess the (a) reach of MAX, (b) conversational agent–patient working alliance, (c) acceptance of MAX, (d) intervention completion rate, (e) cognitive and behavioral outcomes, and (f) human effort and responsiveness of health care professionals in primary and secondary care settings. METHODS: MAX was designed to increase cognitive skills (ie, knowledge about asthma) and behavioral skills (ie, inhalation technique) in 10-15-year-olds with asthma, and enables support by a health professional and a family member. To this end, three design goals guided the development: (1) to build a conversational agent–patient working alliance; (2) to offer hybrid (human- and conversational agent–supported) ubiquitous coaching; and (3) to provide an intervention with high experiential value. An interdisciplinary team of computer scientists, asthma experts, and young patients with their parents developed the intervention collaboratively. The conversational agent communicates with health care professionals via email, with patients via a mobile chat app, and with a family member via SMS text messaging. A single-arm feasibility study in primary and secondary care settings was performed to assess MAX. RESULTS: Results indicated an overall positive evaluation of MAX with respect to its reach (49.5%, 49/99 of recruited and eligible patient-family member teams participated), a strong patient-conversational agent working alliance, and high acceptance by all relevant stakeholders. Moreover, MAX led to improved cognitive and behavioral skills and an intervention completion rate of 75.5%. Family members supported the patients in 269 out of 275 (97.8%) coaching sessions. Most of the conversational turns (99.5%) were conducted between patients and the conversational agent as opposed to between patients and health care professionals, thus indicating the scalability of MAX. In addition, it took health care professionals less than 4 minutes to assess the inhalation technique and 3 days to deliver related feedback to the patients. Several suggestions for improvement were made. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first evidence that conversational agents, designed as mediating social actors involving health care professionals, patients, and family members, are not only accepted in such a “team player” role but also show potential to improve health-relevant outcomes in chronic disease management.","Kowatsch, Tobias; Schachner, Theresa; Harperink, Samira; Barata, Filipe; Dittler, Ullrich; Xiao, Grace; Stanger, Catherine; v Wangenheim, Florian; Fleisch, Elgar; Oswald, Helmut; Möller, Alexander",J Med Internet Res,107,32

A second-generation anti-CEA CAR derived from CEA-specific antibody T84.66 was used to treat murine MC38 colon or E0771 breast carcinomas transfected with CEA. Anti-CEA CAR vs. mock transduced T cells exhibited a CEA-specific cytotoxic and IFN[Image: see text] dose response to both CEA transfected cell lines vs. their CEA-negative controls. Anti-CEA CAR vs. mock transduced T cells delayed the median survival of CEA transfected s.c. MC38 or orthotopic E0771 tumor-bearing CEATg mice by 2 days. With the addition of one-day prior cyclophosphamide (CY) lymphodepletion, anti-CEA CAR T cell treatment delayed the median survival of MC38/CEA and E0771/CEA tumor-bearing CEATg mice by ten and 3 days, respectively. Since CAR T cells require IL2 for survival and expansion, anti-CEA-IL2 immunocytokine (ICK) treatment was performed post CAR T cell therapy. Single ICK treatment 1 day after CY plus anti-CEA CAR T cell therapy in the MC38/CEA model, and two ICK treatments every 3 days after CY plus anti-CEA CAR T cell therapy in the E0771/CEA model were ineffective, while four ICK treatments every 3 days after CY plus anti-CEA CAR T cell therapy completely eradicated MC38/CEA tumor growth and induced tumor immunity when the mice were re-challenged with tumor. These studies show the therapeutic potential of anti-CEA CAR T cells combined with ICK to treat CEA-positive tumors.

The multisystemic vasculitis common in patients with KD may influence blood perfusion in the brain, and thus caregivers of children with KD may feel stress with regard to caring for them. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) infusion is the standard treatment for acute KD, and the most serious complication of KD is coronary artery aneurysms (coronary artery lesion (CAL)). This study aimed to investigate the relationships between KD heterogeneity and the risk of patients’ cognitive impairment or caregivers’ parenting stress. DESIGN: A case–control study with consecutive sampling. SETTING: A medical centre (Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taiwan). PARTICIPANTS: This study consisted of 176 patients with KD (mean age: 5.5 years, 60.8% boys) and 85 healthy children (mean age: 6.4 years, 54.1% boys). PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Based on the children’s age, each patient with KD and control subject was administered an assessment using the Mullen Scales of Early Learning or the Wechsler Intelligence Scale, and parenting function of their caregivers was assessed using the Parenting Stress Index (PSI)-Short Form. RESULTS: We observed no significant differences in any developmental index, cognitive function or parenting stress between patients with KD and controls. Among the children with KD, IVIG administration nor CAL was associated with children’s cognitive scores. However, the caregivers of patients who had CAL suffered from greater PSI total scores than those of patients without CAL. Furthermore, the caregivers who had education levels of a master’s degree or above showed less parenting stress than those who had an education level of college or lower. CONCLUSION: Caregivers’ education is associated to parenting stress, and caregivers of patients with KD who developed CAL may feel stress about the unpredictable sequela caused by CAL for their children. Such caregivers may require support to fulfil their parenting roles.","Wang, Liang-Jen; Tsai, Zi-Yu; Chang, Ling-Sai; Kuo, Ho-Chang",BMJ Open,107,1

The blood half-life of XTEN864-anxA5 was 13 h in mice after IV injection, markedly longer than the 7-min half-life of anxA5. 96 h after injection, highest amounts of XTEN864-anxA5 were found in liver, spleen, and kidney. XTEN864-anxA5 was found to target the adventitia adjacent to atherosclerotic plaques. XTEN864-anxA5 is a long-circulating fusion protein that can be efficiently produced in E. coli and potentially circulates in humans for several days, making it a promising therapeutic drug.

We examine a few legal cases that highlight some of the controversies surrounding the validity of brain death tests in light of varying state laws and institutional policy, the appropriateness of making religious accommodations, the dilemma of continuing organ-sustaining support in a pregnant brain-dead patient, and the issue of whether to obtain informed consent from surrogate decision makers before proceeding to testing. RECENT FINDINGS: In response to physician concerns about navigating these complex cases, especially with laws that vary from state to state, the American Academy of Neurology has published a position statement in January of 2019 endorsing brain death as the irreversible loss of all functions of the entire brain. It provides positions on the determination of brain death as well as guidance surrounding requests for accommodation. SUMMARY: Although death by neurologic criteria has been accepted as death medically for over 40 years, legal variance exists throughout the states, especially regarding religious accommodations and in pregnancy. Questions of whether to obtain informed consent from surrogate decision makers prior to brain death testing remain, and there is no guideline regarding obtaining ancillary testing. We expect to see continued cases that cause medical, legal, and ethical controversies in our ICUs. As such, uniform training in proper methodology in performing the brain death examination and appropriate use of ancillary testing is crucial, and there is a need for legal consistency in the acceptance of the medical standard.","Biel, Sarang; Durrant, Julia",Curr Treat Options Neurol,107,20

Synchrogram index is a new parameter that can quantify this interaction and has the potential to apply in COPD patients. Our objective in this study was to characterize cardiorespiratory interactions in terms of cardiorespiratory coupling (CRC) using the synchrogram index of the heart rate and respiratory flow signals in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional and preliminary data from a prospective study, which examines 55 COPD patients. K-means clustering analysis was applied to cluster COPD patients based on the synchrogram index. Linear regression and multivariable regression analysis were used to determine the correlation between the synchrogram index and the exercise capacity assessed by a six-minute walking test (6MWT). RESULTS: The 55 COPD patients were separated into a synchronized group (median 0.89 (0.64–0.97), n = 43) and a desynchronized group (median 0.23 (0.02–0.51), n = 12) based on K-means clustering analysis. Synchrogram index was correlated significantly with six minutes walking distance (r = 0.42, p = 0.001) and distance saturation product (r = 0.41, p = 0.001) assessed by 6MWT, and still was an independent variable by multivariable regression analysis. CONCLUSION: This is the first result studying the heart–lung interaction in terms of cardiorespiratory coupling in COPD patients by the synchrogram index, and COPD patients are clustered into synchronized and desynchronized groups. Cardiorespiratory coupling is associated with exercise capacity in patients with COPD.","Huang, Yu-Chen; Lin, Ting-Yu; Wu, Hau-Tieng; Chang, Po-Jui; Lo, Chun-Yu; Wang, Tsai-Yu; Kuo, Chih-Hsi Scott; Lin, Shu-Min; Chung, Fu-Tsai; Lin, Horng-Chyuan; Hsieh, Meng-Heng; Lo, Yu-Lun",BMC Pulm Med,107,24

We hypothesized that DMF administration to simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-infected rhesus macaques would induce antioxidant enzyme expression and reduce oxidative injury and inflammation throughout the brain. Nine SIV-infected, CD8(+)-T-lymphocyte-depleted rhesus macaques were studied. Five received oral DMF prior to the SIV infection and through to the necropsy day. Protein expression was analyzed in 11 brain regions, as well as the thymus, liver, and spleen, using Western blot and immunohistochemistry for antioxidant, inflammatory, and neuronal proteins. Additionally, oxidative stress was determined in brain sections using immunohistochemistry (8-OHdG, 3NT) and optical redox imaging of oxidized flavoproteins containing flavin adenine dinucleotide (Fp) and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH). The DMF treatment was associated with no changes in virus replication; higher expressions of the antioxidant enzymes NQO1, GPX1, and HO-1 in the brain and PRDX1 and HO-2 in the spleen; lower levels of 8-OHdG and 3NT; a lower optical redox ratio. The DMF treatment was also associated with increased expressions of cell-adhesion molecules (VCAM-1, ICAM-1) and no changes in HLA-DR, CD68, GFAP, NFL, or synaptic proteins. The concordantly increased brain antioxidant enzyme expressions and reduced oxidative stress in DMF-treated SIV-infected macaques suggest that DMF could limit oxidative stress throughout the brain through effective induction of the endogenous antioxidant response. We propose that DMF could potentially induce neuroprotective brain responses in persons living with HIV.","Garcia-Mesa, Yoelvis; Xu, He N.; Vance, Patricia; Gruenewald, Analise L.; Garza, Rolando; Midkiff, Cecily; Alvarez-Hernandez, Xavier; Irwin, David J.; Gill, Alexander J.; Kolson, Dennis L.",Antioxidants (Basel),107,22

A higher BMI value increases the risk factor for critical diseases, e.g., high blood pressure (hypertension), cardiovascular disease, gallbladder disease, type 2 diabetes, etc. Obesity also increases the risk factor of COVID-19 in patients. BMI, the ratio of mass (in kilogram) to the square of height (in meter), is an estimation of an individual's physique. It depends upon the adult’s height and mass and is intended to evaluate the tissue mass. In this article, we have described the design and developmental aspects of a temperature-compensated BMI measuring system. The developed BMI measuring system is comprised of an ultrasonic sensor for height measurement, strain gauge-based load cell for precise and accurate mass measurement, a temperature sensor to eliminate the effect of temperature, and a microcontroller with related electronics, software, and display system. The developed BMI system is capable to measure mass precisely in the range (0–200) kg with a resolution of 0.01 kg, and height in the range of (0–4) m with resolution of 0.01 m. The expanded uncertainty in height measurement is estimated as 2.8 mm. The BMI value is determined with the help of these parameters and displayed with precision of 0.01. The novelty of the developed system is temperature compensation in the height measurement using an ultrasonic sensor, which has been introduced first time. Also, system is improved for its highly precise and accurate measurements at a comparatively lower cost than the commercially available existing systems.","Kumar, Rahul; Dubey, P.

Specifically, the pandemic has demonstrated that burn disaster planning should involve non-burn disasters that threaten staff, supplies, or space. The ABA facilitated bed counts with the assistance of regional disaster coordinators from April through August of 2020. Our analysis examines the impact of the pandemic on burn surge and bed capacity in the U.S. METHODS: Bed availability was obtained by the ABA regional disaster coordinators through an initiative by the Organization and Delivery of Burn Care Committee. Bed availability was defined as immediately available burn beds and categorized as adult, pediatric, or flexible. Surge capacity was defined as the maximum number of patients that a burn center could admit in a surge situation. Data was deidentified by the central office with descriptive statistics to determine bed availability and surge capacity trends regionally and nationally. RESULTS: Bed counts were performed 6 times from 04/17/2020 through 08/14/2020. Response rates from the 137 North American burn centers varied from 86–96%. At least 6 burn centers (5%) were either closed or converted for COVID patients during the initial two bed counts. The total number of adult or pediatric burn beds was 2,082. Total bed availability decreased from 845 at the first survey down to 572 beds at the last survey. Surge capacity baseline was 1,668 beds and decreased from 1,132 beds in the initial survey down to 833 beds in the final survey. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates a significant impact on burn bed availability due to the COVID-19 pandemic with a 37% reduction in available burn beds from April to August and a 26% reduction in surge capacity. This study demonstrates a substantial reduction in bed availability during the pandemic with additional analysis in process to examine regional trends.","Carter, Jeffrey E; Phelan, Herbert; Ryan, Colleen M; Jeng, James C; Mai, Kathryn; Conlon, Kathe M; Newman, Annette F; Johnston, Mark; Placek, Judy; Wegryn, Cindy; Joe, Victor C",J Burn Care Res,107,20

Main funding source(s): Fundacion del Corazon INTRODUCTION: COVID19 has emerged as a new disease, spreading around the world, leading to a complete lockdown. It is known that other infectious diseases can affect the heart inducing myocarditis. As a new entity, it was unknown if SARS-COV2 could provoke that cardiovascular manifestation. This national registry was created to describe COVID19 cardiac affection and its severity. METHODS AND RESULTS: A multicenter registry was conducted, including 28 centers in Spain. Patients with COVID19 diagnosis presenting an acute cardiovascular event between March 1st and May 30th were included. Eighty-two patients were included. Of them, 9 (14,1%, excluding missing data) presented with acute myocarditis; the rest were diagnosed of acute myocardial infarction or stress cardiomyopathy. Baseline characteristics of these patients are summarised in Table 1. The 83,3% of patients with myocarditis presented with heart failure and 25% simulating an acute coronary syndrome. According to severity, 5 patients (62,5%) were admitted in the Intensive Care Unit, requiring orotracheal intubation 4 patients (57,1%). Left ventricle was affected in 66,7% of patients, whereas the remaining 33,3% presented biventricular failure. Mean left ventricle ejection fraction was 46% [30,0%-52%]. One patient developed refractory cardiogenic shock requiring implantation of both intra-aortic balloon pump and VA- ECMO. Three patients died during hospitalization. Cardiac magnetic resonance was conducted in 2 patients (28,6%), showing oedema and subepicardial enhacement in postero-lateral segments. Cardiac biopsy was performed in one patient showing significant lymphoid infiltration and intersticial oedema. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with COVID 19 who develop acute myocarditis usually present with heart failure secondary to ventricular failure. This entity has a bad prognosis with high in-hospital mortality rate.","Abellas Sequeiros, M; Sanmartin Fernandez, M; Cosin Sales, J; Corbi Pascual, M; Escudier Villa, JM; Ortiz Cortes, C; Baron Esquivas, G; Gomez Doblas, JJ; Barge Caballero, E; Garcia Del Egido, A; Barrios Alonso, V; Gonzalez Juanatey, C; Anguita Sanchez, M; Zamorano, JL",Eur Heart J Acute Cardiovasc Care,107,16

A process evaluation of the ‘Improving the Safety and Continuity Of Medicines management at care Transitions’ (ISCOMAT) cluster randomised control trial of an intervention for improving medicines use for people living with heart failure is being conducted. The intervention includes patient held information on heart medicines and care, enhanced communication between hospital and community pharmacists, and increased engagement of community pharmacists with patient care post‐hospital discharge. ISCOMAT patients living with heart failure were interviewed about experiences with the intervention. We sought to gain insights from patients on data collected to enhance our understanding of experiences with the intervention. OBJECTIVE: To develop a method for involving patients as analysts of qualitative data in a process evaluation. DESIGN: Patients and researchers co‐analysed qualitative data. A framework method was applied involving; familiarisation, coding, developing an analytical framework and interpretation. The process was facilitated through home working and a workshop with a training component. RESULTS: The co‐designed framework enabled researchers to map all further patient interview data. Patients' specialist knowledge enhanced understanding of how the ISCOMAT intervention can be best implemented. CONCLUSIONS: Patients’ unique experiences can enhance validity and rigour in data analysis through sharing their interpretations of qualitative data. The involvement process is crucial in elucidating knowledge and avoiding tokenism. As analysts, patients gain an appreciation of research processes, building trust between researchers and patients. Group dynamics and involving patients throughout the whole research process are important considerations.","Powell, Catherine; Ismail, Hanif; Cleverley, Richard; Taylor, Andrew; Breen, Liz; Fylan, Beth; Alderson, Sarah L; Alldred, David P",Health Expect,107,1

There are many women in the field of diabetes: registration for the ADA Scientific Sessions has been 43% female since 2016, and for over five decades, women comprised 83% of ADA Presidents of Health Care and Education. Yet, only 9% of ADA Presidents of Medicine and Science have been women. Women were well represented on editorial boards for journals focused on diabetes education (Diabetes Spectrum, 89% female) and primary care (Clinical Diabetes, 49% female) but not for the more academically targeted Diabetes Care (34% female), Diabetes (21% female), and Diabetologia (30% female). Only one-third of ADA Pathway to Stop Diabetes and JDRF grants have been awarded to women, and females only lead 2 of 18 (11%) of the P30-supported Diabetes Research Centers. Finally, only 2–12% of major ADA, JDRF, and EASD awards were given to women, without significant change over time. Despite increasing recognition of gender imbalance in research and medicine, many disparities in the field of diabetes persist. We call for decreasing barriers for advancement of female investigators and creating environments that promote their retention and equitable recognition for their contributions to the field.","Dunne, Jessica L.; Maizel, Jennifer L.; Posgai, Amanda L.; Atkinson, Mark A.; DiMeglio, Linda A.",Diabetes,107,1

Drawing on an affordance perspective, we investigate how entrepreneurs interact with online communities and base our qualitative analysis on conversation data (76,365 posts) from an online community of entrepreneurs on Reddit during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings draw out four affordances that online communities offer to entrepreneurs (resolving problems, reframing problems, reflecting on situations, refocusing thinking and efforts), resulting in a framework of entrepreneurial support creation in online communities.

Methods: This study involved a cross-sectional, nonrepresentative, online survey in the United States of individuals tested for COVID-19. Testing survey items measured the performance of conventional contact tracing programs, quantified the stigma related to the notification of COVID-19 close contacts, and assessed the acceptability of a website service for digital contact tracing. Results: A sample of 668 (19.9%) individuals met the inclusion criteria and consented to participation. Among the 95 participants with COVID-19, results were received after a median of 2 days, 63.2% interacted with a contact tracing program a median of 2 days after receiving test results, 62.1% had close contacts, and 37.1% of participants with COVID-19 and close contacts did not disclose their results to all close contacts. Among all participants, 17% had downloaded a mobile application and 40.3% reported interest in a website service. One hundred and nine participants perceived stigma with the disclosure of COVID-19 test results; of these, 58.7% reported that a website service for close contact notification would decrease this stigma. Discussion: Conventional contact tracing programs did not comprehensively contact individuals who tested positive for COVID-19 nor did so within a meaningful time frame. Digital contact tracing innovations may address these shortcomings; however, the low penetration of mobile application services in the United States indicates that a suite of digital contact tracing tools, including website services, are warranted for a more exhaustive coverage of the population. Conclusions: Public health officials should develop a complementary toolkit of digital contact tracing strategies to enable effective pandemic containment strategies.","Trevino, Jesus; Keswani, Meghana; Pourmand, Ali",Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association,107,1

Selenium (Se) is known for its antioxidant property and can resist several stressors affecting farm animals. The aims of this study were (Ⅰ) to determine how excess NH3 exert nephrotoxic effects in pigs and (Ⅱ) to investigate whether selenomethionine has an alleviative effect on NH3 toxicity. Two diets supplemented with different doses of Se (0.22 mg/kg or 0.50 mg/kg) and two concentrations of NH3 (< 5 mg/m3 or 89.8 mg/m3) were used in a 2 × 2 factorial design trial for a period of 30 days. The results showed that NH3 exposure caused apoptosis and increased the number of apoptotic cells in pig kidneys. Further, the activities of antioxidant enzymes were decreased, and the transcriptional and translational levels of endoplasmic reticulum stress-related genes, Bcl-2 and Caspase family members were increased under NH3 exposure. In addition, Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway was suppressed after NH3 treatment. Dietary supplement with selenomethionine appears to offer protection against NH3-induced kidney injury in pigs and the pathologic changes above were alleviated. Our findings provide additional insight into the mechanism of NH3 toxicity in pigs while elucidating the role of Se as a potential antidote against NH3 poisoning.","Han, Qi; Liu, Honggui; Zhang, Runxiang; Yang, Xuesong; Bao, Jun; Xing, Houjuan",Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,107,30

Two main designs of stents, the closed- (CCS) and open-cell (OCS), are used in combination for a crossing Y-construct. This in vitro study was conducted to assess the mechanical characteristics of each stent-combination and to suggest an optimal combination for clinical practice. METHODS The Enterprise and the Neuroform3 stents were used as closed-cell and open-cell stents, respectively. Four different Y-stent combinations; double CCSs (CCS-CCS; Enterprise-Enterprise), OCS followed by CCS (OCS-CCS; Neuroform-Enterprise), CCS followed by OCS (CCS-OCS; Enterprise-Neuroform), and double OCSs (OCS-OCS; Neuroform-Neuroform) were tested in a bifurcation aneurysm model. Images of the model were obtained by digital subtraction angiography (DSA), and morphological changes of Y-constructs caused by interaction between stents were compared. RESULTS Double OCSs showed the best stent apposition to model branches and no collapse of the second stent at the intersection, whereas Y-stent combinations using a CCS as the second stent showed tubular collapse of the second stent at the crossing point. These combinations revealed unsatisfactory apposition to the model branch in which the second stent was deployed. Most narrowing of the second stent was noted in the double CCSs construct, which resulted in poorest stent apposition. CONCLUSION Based on a simple in vitro experiment, we suggest that double OCSs Y-construct is optimal for achieving best stent-wall apposition. Furthermore, our findings suggest that Y-stent combinations utilizing a CCS as the second stent may increase the risk of thromboembolic complications due to poor stent-wall apposition.","Lee, Chang-Young; Park, Seong-Ho; Kim, Chang-Hyun; Benndorf, Goetz",Neuroradiology,107,1

We determined whether the stenting versus aggressive medical therapy for intracranial arterial stenosis (SAMMPRIS) trial supported this approach by comparing the treatments within subgroups of patients whose qualifying event (QE) occurred on versus off of AT. METHODS The primary outcome, 30-day stroke and death and later strokes in the territory of the qualifying artery, was compared between (1) percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stenting plus aggressive medical therapy (PTAS) versus aggressive medical management therapy alone (AMM) for patients whose QE occurred on versus off AT and between (2) patients whose QE occurred on versus off AT separately for the treatment groups. RESULTS Among the 284/451 (63%) patients who had their QE on AT, the 2-year primary end point rates were 15.6% for those randomized to AMM (n=140) and 21.6% for PTAS (n=144; P=0.043, log-rank test). In the 167 patients not on AT, the 2-year primary end point rates were 11.6% for AMM (n=87) and 18.8% for PTAS (n=80; P=0.31, log-rank test). Within both treatment groups, there was no difference in the time to the primary end point between patients who were on or off AT (AMM, P=0.96; PTAS, P=0.52; log-rank test). CONCLUSIONS SAMMPRIS results indicate that the benefit of AMM over PTAS is similar in patients on versus off AT at the QE and that failure of AT is not a predictor of increased risk of a primary end point.

Participants (764, predominantly male) completed a battery of self-report measures on perceived occupational stress, negative affectivity, and illness symptoms. In line with previous research, negative affectivity exerted a nuisance effect, by inflating the association between reported stressors and illness symptoms, and significantly predicted illness symptoms, over and above the effects of stressors. In addition, negative affectivity influenced reported illness symptom indirectly, through the effects of stressors, and moderated the relationship between interpersonal conflict at work and illness symptoms. The findings suggest that negative affectivity can largely explain and influence in different ways the associations between self-reported stress and physical strain. It is recommended that future studies of occupational stress should control for the effects of negative affectivity, and that health professionals should be cautious of its effects when interpreting relationships between self-reported occupational stress and physical well-being.","Lazuras, Lambros; Rodafinos, Angelos; Matsiggos, Georgios; Stamatoulakis, Alexander",Social science & medicine,107,16

Unfortunately, the inherent instability of RNA and translational efficiency are major limitations of RNA vaccine. Here, we report an injectable hydrogel formed with graphene oxide (GO) and polyethylenimine (PEI), which can generate mRNA (ovalbumin, a model antigen) and adjuvants (R848)-laden nanovaccines for at least 30 days after subcutaneous injection. The released nanovaccines can protect the mRNA from degradation and confer targeted delivering capacity to lymph nodes. The data show that this transformable hydrogel can significantly increase the number of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells and subsequently inhibit the tumor growth with only one treatment. Meanwhile, this hydrogel can generate an antigen specific antibody in the serum which in turn prevents the occurrence of metastasis. Collectively, these results demonstrate the potential of the PEI-functionalized GO transformable hydrogel for effective cancer immunotherapy.","Yin, Yue; Li, Xiaoyang; Ma, Haixia; Zhang, Jie; Yu, Di; Zhao, Ruifang; Yu, Shengji; Nie, Guangjun; Wang, Hai",Nano letters,107,4

BACKGROUND Host characteristics and surgical site assessments may predict remodeling degree for biologic meshes used to reinforce abdominal tissue repair sites. METHODS Biologic meshes were biopsied from the abdominal tissue repair sites of n = 40 patients during an abdominal reexploration, stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and evaluated according to a semi-quantitative scoring system for remodeling characteristics (cell types, cell infiltration, extracellular matrix deposition, scaffold degradation, fibrous encapsulation, and neovascularization) and a mean composite score. Biopsies were stained with Sirius Red and Fast Green and analyzed to determine the collagen I:III ratio. On the basis of univariate analyses between subject clinical characteristics or surgical site classification and the histologic remodeling scores, cohort variables were selected for multivariable regression models using P ≤ 0.200. RESULTS The model selection process for cell infiltration score yielded 2 variables: age at mesh implantation and mesh classification (C statistic = 0.989). For the mean composite score, the model selection process yielded 2 variables: age at mesh implantation and mesh classification (r = 0.449). CONCLUSIONS These preliminary results constitute the first steps in generating a risk-prediction model that predicts the patients and clinical circumstances most likely to experience nonconstructive remodeling of abdominal tissue repair sites with biologic mesh reinforcement.","Cavallo, Jaime A; Roma, Andres A; Jasielec, Mateusz S; Ousley, Jenny; Creamer, Jennifer; Pichert, Matthew D; Baalman, Sara; Frisella, Margaret M; Matthews, Brent D; Deeken, Corey R",Annals of surgery,107,24

It is important to accurately and rapidly detect respiratory viruses. To compensate for the limits of current respiratory virus detection methods, we developed a 24-plex analysis (common respiratory virus-mass spectrometry [CRV-MS]) that can simultaneously detect and identify 21 common respiratory viruses based on a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry system. To evaluate the efficacy of the CRV-MS method, we used 102 samples that were confirmed positive for these common respiratory viruses. All tests using the CRV-MS method were effective, with no cross-reactivity observed with other common respiratory viruses. To confirm the usefulness of the CRV-MS method, we screened 336 nasal and throat swabs that were collected from adults or children with suspected viral acute respiratory tract infections using the CRV-MS method and consensus PCR/reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) methods. Excluding four RNase P-negative samples, the CRV-MS and consensus PCR/RT-PCR methods detected respiratory viruses in 92.5% (307/332) and 89.5% (297/332) of the samples, respectively. The two methods yielded identical results for 306 (92.2%) samples, including negative results for 25 samples (7.5%) and positive results for 281 samples (84.6%). Differences between the two methods may reflect their different sensitivities. The CRV-MS method proved to be sensitive and robust, and it can be used in large-scale epidemiological studies of common respiratory virus infections.","Zhang, Chi; Xiao, Yan; Du, Jiang; Ren, Lili; Wang, Jianwei; Peng, Junping; Jin, Qi",Journal of clinical microbiology,107,7

Both G irradiances (I(g)) and PAR irradiances (I(p)) showed similar seasonal features that peaked in values at noon during summer and reached their lower values in winter. F(p) reached higher values during either sunrise or sunset; lower values of F p appeared at local noon because of the absorption effects of water vapor and clouds on long-wave radiation. There was an inverse relationship between clearness index (K(t)) and F(p); the maximum I(p) decreased by 22.3 % (39.7 %) when sky conditions changed from overcast to cloudless in summer (winter); solar radiation was more affected by cloudiness than the seasonal variation in cloudy skies when compared with that in clear skies. The maximum daily PAR irradiation (R(p)) was 11.89 MJ m⁻² day⁻¹ with an annual average of 4.85 MJ m⁻² day⁻¹. F p was in the range of 29-61.5 % with annual daily average value being about 42 %. Meanwhile, hourly, daily, and monthly relationships between R p and G irradiation (R g) under different sky conditions were investigated. It was discovered that cloudy skies were the dominated sky condition in this region. Finally, a clear-sky PAR model was developed by analyzing the dependence of PAR irradiances on optical air mass under various sky conditions for the whole study period in Central China, which will lay foundations for ecological process study in the near future.","Wang, Lunche; Gong, Wei; Lin, Aiwen; Hu, Bo",International journal of biometeorology,107,1

Recently, the focus has been on the development of minimally invasive techniques in the form of single-incision laparoscopic surgery. The single-incision technique provides a less invasive alternative to conventional laparoscopic surgery, requiring only one incision disguised within the umbilical folds in contrast to the three to five incisions in conventional laparoscopic surgery. The availability of a number of specialised ports has aided the development of single-incision laparoscopic surgery, and led to its widespread use. The successful use of single-incision laparoscopic surgery has been reported for a number of surgical procedures, and offers several potential benefits versus conventional laparoscopic surgery, including reduced pain, reduced time to recovery and improved cosmesis. This review of international literature assesses the current status, as well as the experience, of single-incision laparoscopic surgery within general, colorectal, bariatric, metabolic, gynaecological and urological surgery.

However, such a practice is widespread and is likely to be as common in Papua New Guinea as in many other countries. METHODS In a cross-sectional descriptive study, children were recruited who had been diagnosed with a common cold or URTI by attending clinical staff-mostly nurses-in a provincial hospital's children's outpatient department using a standard definition. The frequency of antibiotic prescribing was determined and the clinical knowledge and practices of nurses, health extension officers, community health workers and doctors working in the children's outpatients department regarding the common cold and its management was assessed. RESULTS One hundred and eight children diagnosed with the common cold were enrolled; 89 (82.4%) were prescribed antibiotics. Children with fever on examination, those older than 12 months and those whose symptoms lasted ≥7 days were more likely to be prescribed antibiotics. Of the health workers surveyed, 95% knew that viruses were the cause of the common cold, but 30% thought that antibiotics were needed for treatment. CONCLUSIONS Although among healthcare workers, there was a gap between knowledge of aetiology and knowledge of appropriate management of the common cold, there was a larger apparent gap between that knowledge and practice. Findings from this study could be used to identify interventions promoting rational antibiotic use, targeting both health-care workers and the community.","Zamunu, Andree; Pameh, Wendy; Ripa, Paulus; Vince, John; Duke, Trevor",Paediatrics and international child health,107,29

Tryptophan metabolism is an important mechanism for regulation of serotonin levels. Preimplantation mouse embryos are known to express serotonin receptors, specifically the 5-HT1D and 5-HT7 serotonin receptor subtypes. Here we demonstrate that Hoxa10 regulates endometrial TDO expression and improves embryo viability through increased serotonin production. Transfection of pcDNA-Hoxa10 to the murine uterus increased total TDO expression. In vitro, epithelial cell TDO expression was decreased after transfection with Hoxa10. Decreased glandular TDO in response to HOXA10 may augment serotonin production by increasing tryptophan availability. Conversely, stromal TDO expression increased with constitutive Hoxa10 expression. In mice, epithelial serotonin was increased in response to constitutive expression of Hoxa10. Embryo quality was impaired after treatment with Hoxa10 antisense. Blockade of serotonin receptors 1D and 7 also resulted in impaired embryo development, indicating an essential role for Hoxa10 induction of TDO and subsequent serotonin production in embryo development. Transfection of pcDNA-TDO also decreased the number of T cells in the endometrial stroma. We have shown a novel mechanism by which HOXA10 regulates endometrial TDO expression. In the endometrial stroma, HOXA10 increases TDO mRNA, which may increase tryptophan catabolism, allowing for immune tolerance at the time of embryo implantation. In endometrial glands, HOXA10 decreases TDO mRNA leading to increased serotonin that in turn acts to promote normal embryo development.","Doherty, Leo F; Kwon, Hye Eun; Taylor, Hugh S",American journal of physiology.

Evidence is scarce about its utility in gynecologic surgery. AIM To compare our initial experience using LESS for benign adnexal disease to traditional laparoscopy. METHODS Since November 2008, we have performed LESS in 28 patients diagnosed with benign adnexal disease (group I). Patients with adnexal masses and a body mass index <35 were selected. An age-matched control group of patients with similar diagnoses who underwent traditional operative laparoscopy was included (n = 50; group II). RESULTS Both groups were comparable with regard to age, body mass index, preoperative diagnosis, indication of surgery and history of previous abdominal surgery. The operative blood loss ranged from minimal to <50 ml for both groups. The mean ± SD duration of surgery in group I (45 ± 19.5 min) was comparable to that of group II (46.4 ± 18.3 min). The duration of hospital stay was <24 h in both groups. Minimal use of postoperative narcotics was required in study subjects and no intraoperative complications occurred. CONCLUSIONS LESS for benign adnexal disease is feasible in patients with or without previous surgery and is comparable to traditional laparoscopic surgery.

Nevertheless, the mechanisms of its emergence, adaptability in siliciclastic-dominated margins and demise, especially in southern South China Sea (SCS), are largely speculative and remains enigmatic along with a scarcity of constraints on paleoclimatic and palaeoceanographic conditions. Here we show, through newly acquired high-resolution geophysical data and accurate stratigraphic records based on strontium isotopic dating, the evolution of these platforms from ~15.5-9.5 Ma is initially tied to tectonics and eustasy, and ultimately, after ~9.5 Ma, to changes in the global climate patterns and consequent palaeoceanographic conditions. Our results demonstrate at least two paleodeltas that provided favourable substratum of elevated sand bars, which conditioning the emergence of the buildups that inadvertently mirrored the underlying strata. We show unprecedented evidences for ocean current fluctuations linked to the intensification of the Asian summer monsoon winds resulting in the formation of drifts and moats, which extirpated the platforms through sediment removal and starvation.

A number of agents, including docetaxel, cabazitaxel, abiraterone acetate, enzalutamide and sipuleucel-T, have been reported to improve outcomes in men with castration-resistant disease and their use is being explored in hormone-sensitive prostate cancer. OBJECTIVES To assess the effects of early taxane-based chemohormonal therapy for newly diagnosed, metastatic, hormone-sensitive prostate cancer. SEARCH METHODS We performed a comprehensive search using multiple databases (the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, Google Scholar, and Web of Science), trials registries, other sources of grey literature, and conference proceedings, up to 10 August 2018. We applied no restrictions on publication language or status. SELECTION CRITERIA We included randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials in which participants were administered taxane-based chemotherapy with systemic androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) within 120 days of beginning ADT versus ADT alone at the time of diagnosis of metastatic disease. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently classified studies and abstracted data from the included studies. We performed statistical analyses using a random-effects model. We rated the quality of evidence according to the GRADE approach. MAIN RESULTS The search identified three studies in which 2,261 participants were randomized to receive either ADT alone, or taxane-based chemotherapy at a dose of 75mg per square meter of body surface area at three-weekly intervals for six or nine cycles in addition to ADT.Primary outcomesEarly treatment with taxane-based chemotherapy in addition to ADT probably reduces death from any cause compared to ADT alone (hazard ratio (HR) 0.77, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.68 to 0.87; moderate-certainty evidence); this would result in 94 fewer deaths per 1,000 men (95% CI 51 to 137 fewer deaths). We downgraded the certainty of evidence due to study limitations related to potential performance bias. Based on the results of one study with 375 participants, the addition of taxane-based chemotherapy to ADT may increase the incidence of Grade III to V adverse events compared to ADT alone (risk ratio (RR) 2.98, 95% CI 2.19 to 4.04; low-certainty evidence); this would result in 405 more Grade III to V adverse events per 1,000 men (95% CI 243 to 621 more events). We downgraded the certainty of evidence due to study limitations and imprecision.Secondary outcomesEarly taxane-based chemotherapy in addition to ADT probably reduces the risk of prostate cancer-specific death (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.89; moderate-certainty evidence). We downgraded the certainty of evidence due to study limitations related to potential performance and detection bias. The addition of taxane-based chemotherapy also probably reduces disease progression compared to ADT alone (HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.71; moderate-certainty evidence). We downgraded the certainty of evidence because of study limitations related to potential performance bias. The addition of taxane-based chemotherapy to ADT may result in a large increase in the risk of treatment discontinuation due to adverse events (RR 79.41, 95% CI 4.92 to 1282.78; low-certainty evidence). We downgraded the certainty of evidence due to study limitations and imprecision. This estimate is derived from a single study with no events in the control arm but a discontinuation rate of 20% in the intervention arm. Taxane-based chemotherapy may increase the incidence of adverse events of any grade (RR 1.11, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.17; low-certainty evidence). We downgraded our assessment of the certainty of evidence due to very serious study limitations. There may be a small improvement, which may not be clinically important, in quality of life at 12 months with combination treatment (mean difference (MD) 2.85 on the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate scale, 95% CI 0.13 higher to 5.57 higher; low-certainty evidence). We downgraded the certainty of evidence for study limitations related to potential performance, detection and attrition bias. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Compared to ADT alone, the early (within 120 days of beginning ADT) addition of taxane-based chemotherapy to ADT for hormone-sensitive prostate cancer probably prolongs both overall and disease-specific survival and delays disease progression. There may be an increase in toxicity with taxane-based chemotherapy in combination with ADT. There may also be a small, clinically unimportant improvement in quality of life at 12 months with taxane-based chemotherapy and ADT treatment.","Sathianathen, Niranjan J; Philippou, Yiannis A; Kuntz, Gretchen M; Konety, Badrinath R; Gupta, Shilpa; Lamb, Alastair D; Dahm, Philipp",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,107,28

In both settings, recommended precautions for restarting or continuing EEG recording included strict hygienic rules, social distance, and assessment for infection symptoms among staff and patients/participants. CONCLUSIONS The COVID-19 pandemic interfered with the use of EEG recordings in clinical practice and even more in clinical research. We suggest updated best practices to allow safe EEG recordings in both research and clinical settings. The continued use of EEG is important in those with psychiatric diseases, particularly in times of social alarm such as the COVID-19 pandemic.","Campanella, Salvatore; Arikan, Kemal; Babiloni, Claudio; Balconi, Michela; Bertollo, Maurizio; Betti, Viviana; Bianchi, Luigi; Brunovsky, Martin; Buttinelli, Carla; Comani, Silvia; Di Lorenzo, Giorgio; Dumalin, Daniel; Escera, Carles; Fallgatter, Andreas; Fisher, Derek; Giordano, Giulia Maria; Guntekin, Bahar; Imperatori, Claudio; Ishii, Ryouhei; Kajosch, Hendrik; Kiang, Michael; López-Caneda, Eduardo; Missonnier, Pascal; Mucci, Armida; Olbrich, Sebastian; Otte, Georges; Perrottelli, Andrea; Pizzuti, Alessandra; Pinal, Diego; Salisbury, Dean; Tang, Yingying; Tisei, Paolo; Wang, Jijun; Winkler, Istvan; Yuan, Jiajin; Pogarell, Oliver",Clinical EEG and neuroscience,107,1

We performed a multicenter randomized crossover trial comparing EUS-FNB with a 20G Procore needle vs. a 22G Acquire needle. The aims were to compare the quantity of targeted tissue (pancreas) and diagnostic accuracy for the two needles. METHODS : 60 patients admitted for EUS-FNB in three endoscopy units were included. One pass was performed consecutively with each needle, in a randomized order. Histologic material was studied in a blinded manner with respect to the needle. The primary end point was mean cumulative length of tissue core biopsies per needle pass. RESULTS : Final diagnosis was adenocarcinoma (n = 46; 77 %), neuroendocrine neoplasm (n = 11; 18 %), autoimmune pancreatitis (n = 2), and mass-forming chronic pancreatitis (n = 1). The mean cumulative length of tissue core biopsies per needle pass was significantly higher with the 22G Acquire needle at 11.4 mm (95 % confidence interval [CI] 9.0 - 13.8] vs. 5.4 mm (95 %CI 3.8 - 7.0) for the 20G Procore needle (P < 0.001), as was the mean surface area (3.5 mm2 [95 %CI 2.7 - 4.3] vs. 1.8 mm2 [95 %CI 1.2 - 2.3]; P < 0.001). Diagnostic adequacy and accuracy were 100 % and 87 % with the 22G Acquire needle, and 82 % and 67 % with the 20G Procore needle (P = 0.001 and P = 0.02, respectively). CONCLUSIONS : EUS-guided biopsy of pancreatic masses with the 22G Acquire needle provided more tissue for histologic evaluation and better diagnostic accuracy than the 20G Procore needle.","Karsenti, David; Palazzo, Laurent; Perrot, Bastien; Zago, Jacqueline; Lemaistre, Anne-Isabelle; Cros, Jérôme; Napoléon, Bertrand",Endoscopy,107,17

The virus first appeared in early December 2019 in China, and on 1 March, the first positive person in the Czech Republic was confirmed. The Ministry of Health and subsequently the Government of the Czech Republic took relatively strict epidemiological measures in connection with the development of the epidemic in China, subsequently in individual countries of the European Union and in other countries throughout the world. In order to effectively implement epidemiological measures, the Government declared a state of emergency for the Czech Republic due to health threats in connection with the proof of occurrence of coronavirus SARS CoV-2 from 14.00 on 12 March 2020 for 30 days. The state of emergency was then extended until 17 May 2020. The aim of the article is to investigate the emerging solutions and impacts of the COVID-19 epidemic on selected spheres of society in the Czech Republic in the period from March to April 2020, focusing on specific procedures in the South Bohemian Region. As part of the epidemiological measures, it was necessary to address the situation of socially disadvantaged groups, such as the homeless or those ordered out due to domestic violence. The case study examined the provision of care for homeless people and those ordered out due to domestic violence who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and were not hospitalised or quarantined. In practice, crisis management tools in conjunction with epidemiological approaches have proven to be effective and usable. The examples show that, despite the complexity of the situation, regional and local governments have found a way to implement the necessary measures to mitigate the impact on local society and the community.","Kavan, Stepan",Health & social care in the community,107,16

In the current paper we have developed novel, carrier-resolved, single-label-based multiplexed assays for the simultaneous detection and quantification of a limited number of DNA targets associated with breast cancer. In contrast to current encoding strategies, every hybridization signal for the corresponding DNA target in our protocol is uniquely immobilized onto one carrier vehicle with a unique and intrinsic physico-chemical signature. Moreover, a simple chemiluminescence setup is employed to read the carrier code instead of expensive and complicated flow-cytometer or imaging-systems commonly used for multiplexed assays. Herein we demonstrate a new protocol using three homogeneous carriers, i.e. thermo-sensitive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIP), polystyrene beads, and magnetic beads respectively. This new methodology allowed for the simultaneous determination of three oligonucleotide sequences (60 bases in length) associated with the breast cancer gene (BRCA1) and showed high selectivity and attomolar-femtomolar sensitivity. The mixture of three different capture probe conjugates first hybridizes with three corresponding target sequences, sandwiches with three biotinylated DNAs, and then reacts with peroxidase-streptavidin polymer in a single vessel without any washing, leading to the development of a 'one-pot reaction system'. Only one washing step in our protocol is required prior to detection leading to our whole procedure being simple and efficient. The results show that the hybridization response to sample mixtures containing increasing levels of each target is proportional to the amount of corresponding DNA targets, indicating minimal cross-interferences. The work presented here validates the design and concept of a system for the detection of a limited number of DNA targets and provides the foundation for the development of highly sensitive techniques with increased multi-analyte capabilities.","Li, Huan; Lau, Choiwan; Lu, Jianzhong",The Analyst,107,13

CD133+BMSC adhesion to all types of EC were increased in the presence of platelets under shear stress.

PROCEDURES A secondary data analysis was conducted from the Domestic Violence Enhanced Perinatal Home Visits (DOVE) study of abused pregnant women (N = 239) and their infants' neurodevelopment from baseline through 12-months postpartum. RESULTS Although all women reported decreased violence from baseline to 12 months postpartum, there was a significant main effect between baseline IPV scores and infant risk for developmental delay at 12 months (β = .19; p < .05) and a significant interaction between baseline IPV scores and multiple partner categories (β = .89; p < .01). Women in the single abusive partner category demonstrated a negative association between baseline IPV and 12-month infant risk scores (β = -.56; p < .01). Whereas women in the mixed and multiple abusive partner groups demonstrated a positive association between IPV and infant risk scores (β = .32; p < .05). CONCLUSION This study provides evidence that an infant's neurodevelopment is impacted by exposure to violence in the home.

The loop-tree duality is a novel method aimed at overcoming this bottleneck by opening the loop amplitudes into trees and combining them at integrand level with the real-emission matrix elements. In this Letter, we generalize the loop-tree duality to all orders in the perturbative expansion by using the complex Lorentz-covariant prescription of the original one-loop formulation. We introduce a series of mutiloop topologies with arbitrary internal configurations and derive very compact and factorizable expressions of their open-to-trees representation in the loop-tree duality formalism. Furthermore, these expressions are entirely independent at integrand level of the initial assignments of momentum flows in the Feynman representation and remarkably free of noncausal singularities. These properties, that we conjecture to hold to other topologies at all orders, provide integrand representations of scattering amplitudes that exhibit manifest causal singular structures and better numerical stability than in other representations.","Aguilera-Verdugo, J Jesús; Driencourt-Mangin, Félix; Hernández-Pinto, Roger J; Plenter, Judith; Ramírez-Uribe, Selomit; Rentería-Olivo, Andrés E; Rodrigo, Germán; Sborlini, Germán F R; Bobadilla, William J Torres; Tracz, Szymon",Physical review letters,107,12

A total of 200 one-day-old healthy broilers were allocated to two groups. The experimental group was fed a self-made low-Se diet (0.004 mg/kg) while the control group was fed a complete formula feed (0.2 mg/kg) for 15, 25, 35, 45, and 55 days, respectively. We observed histopathological changes in the chicken spleens. The messenger RNA(mRNA) expression levels of 8 kinds of ChTLRs, myeloid differential protein-88 (MyD88), toll-interleukine-1 receptor domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-β (TRIF), nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), and cytokine (IL-6, TNF-α, IL-2, and IFN-γ) were detected via quantitative real-time PCR. Western blotting was used to detect the protein expression level of TLR4. Then principal component analysis (PCA) was used to analyze the correlation between the ChTLRs, MyD88, TRIF, and NF-κB. The results showed that the boundary between red pulp and white pulp was unclear, the number of lymphocytes decreased, and the nucleus was fragmented and dissolved in the experimental group at 25-55 days. At 15-45 days, the relative expression of TLR4 mRNA was higher than in the control group, and the difference was extremely significant on day 15 (P < 0.01).The relative expression of TRIF mRNA in the experimental group was higher than in the control group at 25-55 days, and the relative expression of NF-κB mRNA in the experimental group was higher than in the control group at 15-45 days. The relative expression of IL-6 mRNA in the experimental group was higher than in the control group at 15-45 days. The protein expression level of TLR4 in the experimental group was higher than in the control group at 15-45 days. The PCA results showed that there was a strong correlation between TLR4, TRIF, and component 1. The results suggest that TLR4 plays an important role in regulating the expression of inflammatory cytokines in the spleens of Se-deficient chickens, and Se deficiency may cause inflammatory injury through the TLR4/TRIF/NF-κB signaling pathway in chicken spleen.","Zhang, Ruili; Guo, Rong; Liu, Qing; Li, Guangxing; Sun, Bin; Huang, Xiaodan",Biological trace element research,107,0

The objectives of this scoping review are to: (1) identify definitions of successful transitions from CAMHS to AMHS; and (2) identify indicators that have been used to measure CAMHS-AMHS transition care processes and quality, and outcomes. METHODS We will search 8 electronic bibliographic databases from 1980 to 2016 (eg, Medline, EMBASE, PsycINFO), professional associations, policy documents, and other grey literature to identify relevant material. We will include experimental, quasi-experimental, observational studies, and non-research studies (guidelines, narrative reviews, policy documents) examining the transition from CAMHS to AMHS. 2 raters will independently screen each retrieved title and abstract for eligibility using the study inclusion criteria (level 1), and then will independently assess full-text articles to determine if these meet the inclusion criteria (level 2). Data extraction will be completed and results will be synthesised both quantitatively and qualitatively.

Reduction in PP2A activity has been linked to progression of microglial mediated neuroinflammatory diseases. Inflammatory conditions are characterized by increased population of CD86+ve M1 cells and a therapeutic strategy to polarize microglial cells towards CD206+ve M2 cells is the need of hour. In this paper we analyzed A: whether the level of PP2A is altered in CD86+ve cells, B: whether FTY720, a known modulator of PP2A, is able to restore the level of PP2A in inflamed CD86+ve cells. Results revealed that PP2A activity was significantly diminished in inflamed cells but the surprising observation was the cell viability of only 35.99% upon FTY720 treatment in inflamed cells lacking basal PP2A activity. A sharp increase at mRNA level of CD95 and ASK-1 indicated that apoptosis occurred in these cells through CD95/ASK-1/JNK pathway. Importantly, flow cytometric analysis revealed apoptosis of not only CD86+ve cells but also CD206+ve cells. Previous studies have reported that FTY720 polarizes microglial cells towards M2 states; however apoptosis of M2 cells was not studied. As western blot analysis revealed that FTY720 failed to completely restore PP2A, another PP2A modulator, Memantine, was used for co-treatment. Upon co-treatment, the level of PP2A was completely restored and also viability of microglial cells was significantly improved with a significant reduction in apoptosis of M2 cells. These findings suggest that co-treatment strategy may prove beneficial to balance M1/M2 microglial population, thereby improving neuronal functions.","Nematullah, Md; Hoda, M N; Nimker, Shwetanjali; Khan, Farah",Toxicology and applied pharmacology,107,24

Saccular aneurysms were created from an arterial graft from the descending aorta.The aneurysms were microsurgically transplanted through end-to-side anastomosis to the infrarenal abdominal aorta of a syngenic male Wistar rat weighing >500 g. Following aneurysm anastomosis, aneurysm embolization was performed using balloon expandable magnesium stents (2.5 mm x 6 mm). The stent system was retrograde introduced from the lower abdominal aorta using a modified Seldinger technique. Following a pilot series of 6 animals, a total of 67 rats were operated according to established standard operating procedures. Mean surgery time, mean anastomosis time, and mean suturing time of the artery puncture site were 167 ± 22 min, 26 ± 6 min and 11 ± 5 min, respectively. The mortality rate was 6% (n=4). The morbidity rate was 7.5% (n=5), and in-stent thrombosis was found in 4 cases (n=2 early, n=2 late in stent thrombosis).

However, the current two-dimensional (2D) in vitro cell culture systems cannot accurately depict and simulate the rich environment and complex processes observed in vivo, while animal studies present significant drawbacks with inherited species-specific differences and low throughput for increased demands. To improve the nonclinical prediction of drug safety and efficacy, researchers continue to develop novel models to evaluate and promote the use of improved cell- and organ-based assays for more accurate representation of human susceptibility to drug response. Among others, the three-dimensional (3D) cell culture models present physiologically relevant cellular microenvironment and offer great promise for assessing drug disposition and pharmacokinetics (PK) that influence drug safety and efficacy from an early stage of drug development. Currently, there are numerous different types of 3D culture systems, from simple spheroids to more complicated organoids and organs-on-chips, and from single-cell type static 3D models to cell co-culture 3D models equipped with microfluidic flow control as well as hybrid 3D systems that combine 2D culture with biomedical microelectromechanical systems. This article reviews the current application and challenges of 3D culture systems in drug PK, safety and efficacy assessment, and provides a focused discussion and regulatory perspectives on the liver-, intestine-, kidney- and neuron-based 3D cellular models.","Wang, Hongbing; Brown, Paul C; Chow, Edwin C Y; Ewart, Lorna; Ferguson, Stephen S; Fitzpatrick, Suzanne; Freedman, Benjamin S; Guo, Grace L; Hedrich, William; Heyward, Scott; Hickman, James; Isoherranen, Nina; Li, Albert P; Liu, Qi; Mumenthaler, Shannon M; Polli, James; Proctor, William R; Ribeiro, Alexandre; Wang, Jian-Ying; Wange, Ronald L; Huang, Shiew-Mei",Clinical and translational science,107,29

A new MBM-device may have advantages over the current MBM-device with improved visualization, easier passage of accessories, and higher suction power due to different trip wire and cap. METHODS Rubber bands were released one by one for both MBM-devices while endoscopic images were collected. First, free endoscopic view was assessed by computer-assisted measurements (quantitative) and by ranking the images by a panel of 11 endoscopists (qualitative). Second, using a visual analog scale, three 'blinded' endoscopists assessed introduction and advancement of three types of endoscopic devices through the working channel of a diagnostic endoscope with the MBM-devices assembled. Third, suction power was evaluated by a manometer attached to the cap of the assembled MBM-devices in four endoscopes. Negative pressures were measured after 5 and 10 s of suction and repeated five times. The passage and suction experiments were performed with dry trip wires and repeated after soaking with bloody, mucous fluids. RESULTS With all bands present, endoscopic views were 90 and 40% in the new and current MBM-device, respectively. With the release of more bands, differences slowly disappeared. The panel scored a better endoscopic view in the new MBM-device (p = 0.03). Passage of all accessories was considered significantly easier in the new MBM-device. With the associated snare in the working channel, suction power was significantly better with the new MBM-device. CONCLUSION Compared to the currently available MBM-device, the new MBM-device provides improved endoscopic visibility, smoother passage of accessories, and higher suction power.","Schölvinck, D W; Belghazi, K; Pouw, R E; Curvers, W L; Weusten, B L A M; Bergman, J J G H M",Surgical endoscopy,107,1

Leukotoxin is the primary virulence factor of this organism. BHS are more susceptible to developing fatal pneumonia than the related species Ovis aries (domestic sheep [DS]). In BHS herds affected by pneumonia, lamb recruitment is severely impaired for years subsequent to an outbreak. We hypothesized that a lack of maternally derived antibodies (Abs) against M. haemolytica provides an immunologic basis for enhanced susceptibility of BH lambs to population-limiting pneumonia. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine the titers of Abs directed against M. haemolytica in the sera of BH and domestic lambs at birth through 12 weeks of age. Results revealed that BH lambs had approximately 18-fold lower titers of Ab against surface antigens of M. haemolytica and approximately 20-fold lower titers of leukotoxin-neutralizing Abs than domestic lambs. The titers of leukotoxin-neutralizing Abs in the serum and colostrum samples of BH ewes were approximately 157- and 50-fold lower than those for domestic ewes, respectively. Comparatively, the higher titers of parainfluenza 3 virus-neutralizing Abs in the BH lambs ruled out the possibility that these BHS had an impaired ability to passively transfer Abs to their lambs. These results suggest that lower levels of leukotoxin-neutralizing Abs in the sera of BH ewes, and resultant low Ab titers in their lambs, may be a critical factor in the poor lamb recruitment in herds affected by pneumonia.","Herndon, Caroline N; Shanthalingam, Sudarvili; Knowles, Donald P; Call, Douglas R; Srikumaran, Subramaniam",Clinical and vaccine immunology : CVI,107,12

It has thought to be originated from Wuhan, China, in December 2019. This outbreak has link to Wuhan's seafood and exotic animal wholesale markets [3,4]. As SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious, it has now spread to each and every corner of the world [1,2]. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) situation report (77th), updated on 6 April, 2020 there have been globally 1210956 confirmed cases and 67 594 deaths of COVID-19 [2]. This viral outbreak has now posed a global threat to healthcare systems. So many, efforts are going on to find new drugs or to repurpose already existed drugs [1,5-7]. Majoritily, it has been found that most of the COVID-19 patients belong to cardiovascular comorbidities [8-10]. It is obvious that they qualify for antihypertensive therapy. Many of them are treating with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB)[8]. There has been considerable debate in scientific community and health professionals about whether angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) may increase attractiveness towards the COVID-19 virus infection or not ?[9-16]. One of the important concern highlighted by these studies involving antihypertensive medications suggested that these drugs might cause increments in abundance of SARS-CoV-2 receptor henceforth causing COVID-19 by entering into cells [17,18]. This suggests plausible increase in ACE2 receptors on lung and heart cells and hence offering more entry points for SARS-CoV-2[17]. However, no strong evidence has been noted. There has been more number of commentaries published explaining both sides and still they are appearing on daily basis [12-16]. Herein, we tried to summaries, clinical aspects on ACEs and ARBs based on literature and commentaries to explain both the sides. A recent published article in Nature by Zhou et al. (2020)[19], reported that the angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) is acting as receptor for SARS Coronavirus 2.This receptors was also acted as receptors for SARS-CoV and HCoV-NL63. Zhou et al. (2020), clearly wrote that ""We show that 2019-nCoV (COVID-19) is able to use ACE2 proteins as an entry receptor to enter ACE2-expressing cells, but not cells that did not express ACE2, indicating that ACE2 is probably the cell receptor through which 2019-nCoV enters cells"". ACE2 is aminopeptidase responsible for cleaving angiotensin I and angiotensin II into the angiotensin-(1-9) and angiotensin-(1-7) peptides[20]. Normally, ACE2 have been found to be overexpressed in clinical conditions including heart failure, arterial hypertension, etc. It has also been noted that ACE2 acts as a functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry. There have been several literatures supporting the role of a cardiovascular-protective ACE2-angiotensin-(1-7)-Mas receptor axis. Recent viewpoint article published in JAMA journal by author Majd AlGhatrif exaplains[15] correlations among aging, cardiovascular diseases and COVID-19 patients. He clearly concluded important fact saying, ""compared with young individuals, older persons with cardiovascular disorders (CVD); who already have reduced ACE2 levels will be expected to be more predisposed to exaggerated inflammation with further reduction in ACE2 expression in the context of COVID-19, manifesting with greater disease severity"". One of well-known Austrian scientist Prof. Josef Penninger[21], Josef Penninger noted important relationship between RAS (the renin-angiotensin system) and ACE2. He is particularly focusing on ACE2 as a potential treatment approach. In one of the article by Mourad et al., (2020), explained different effects on ACE2 levels in correlation with different administrations of RAAS inhibitors and believed that chronic treatment with ACE inhibitors has no reason to influence the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection[22]. A reply to this article has also been published by Zheng et al., (2020)[23] saying that ""although ACE2 has been identified as the functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2, the role of ACE2 in the progression of COVID-19 after SARS-CoV-2 infection is still controversial, so the benefits of aliskiren use in patients with COVID-19 needs further investigation"". Today, many healthcare societies' especially cardiovascular societies are urging the patients suffering from CVDs (cardiovascular diseases) not to discontinue their medications[24-26]. These healthcare societies give more stress upon statement saying that there is no sound evidence to correlate ACEs and ARBs leading risk of COVID-19 infection. It has also been noted that healthcare societies do not suggest immediate starting of ACEIs/ARBs in those patients having no settlements with clinical conditions like heart failure, diabetes, hypertension, etc. As these statements adheres to current state of evidences. The same conclusion has been derived from the recent article by Ankit Patel et al., (2020)[24]. This article suggested that there has been no definitive evidence to suggest ACE inhibitors and ARBs worsening of COVID-19. A study published by Vaduganathan et al., (2020) in New England Journal of Medicine discussed the uncertain effects of RAAS blockers on ACE2 levels[27]. They also derived to conclusion that ACE2 may be beneficial in COVID-19 patients with lung injury. This team also suggests that withdrawal of RAAS inhibitors may be harmful. A very recent review published by Dr. Sanchis-Gomar and his co-authors in Mayo Clinic Proceedings[14], by analysing more than 60 articles, concluded the fact that ""no studies have reported an increase in circulating ACE2 levels or expression thus far, and increased expression would not necessarily imply an increased risk of infection or disease severity"". Dr. Sanchis-Gomar, studies both articles explaining that elevated levels of angiotensin II fostering acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) as well as significance of RAAS inhibitors in therapy in treating patients with COVID-19. However, authors noted that more research in this regard is needed. CONCLUSION In this regards, more laboratory and clinical evidences are required in order to decide COVID-19 treatment. In conclusion to this debate, suggesting roles of antihypertensive agents and severity leading changes in ACE2 levels, may shed more light on infectivity and outcome of COVID-19.There is an urgent need to establish whether treatments with antihypertensive (ACEI's/ ARBs) needs to be determined.","Mali, Suraj N; Thorat, Bapu R; Chopade, Atul R",Infectious disorders drug targets,107,12

Within this context, the notion of Yasashii Nihongo or Simplified Japanese has been gaining attention over recent years. Originally designed as a tool for transmitting information in disaster-related situations and proposed for disaster mitigation purposes, at present it is being advocated as a means of communication to be used in non-disaster situations as well. The authors argue that ultimately Yasashii Nihongo for non-disaster situations may be just a means to an end. Seen from the perspective of ""reasonable accommodation"", a concept prevalent in the domain of disability studies, they assert that by de facto creating a new linguistic category making it a tacit prerequisite to communicate in ""Japanese only"", Yasashii Nihongo is but a concept geared towards the language majority (speakers using Japanese as their first language) and is potentially serving no other purpose than to alleviate the psychological burden of having to speak in a language other than Japanese, thus potentially leading to a new form of discrimination towards language minorities. Offering an alternative approach for improving multicultural communication aimed at establishing a communicative space based on openness, equality, and mutual respect for each other's cultural, linguistic and ethnic identities, the authors propose the introduction of language education based on the notion of plurilingualism, as outlined in the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) by the Council of Europe.","Ito, Hideaki; Tokarev, Alexander",F1000Research,107,1

A large number of immune mediators are present in the digestive tract and interact with gut bacteria to impact immune function. The gut microbiota itself is also an important initiator of inflammation, for example by releasing compounds such as lipopolysaccharides (LPS) that may influence cytokine production and immune cell function. Certain nutrients (e.g., probiotics, ω-3 fatty acids [FA]) may increase gut microbiota diversity and reduce inflammation. Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria, among others, prevent gut hyperpermeability and lower LPS-dependent chronic low-grade inflammation. Furthermore, ω-3 FA generate positive effects on inflammation-related conditions (e.g., hypertriglyceridemia, diabetes) by interacting with immune, metabolic, and inflammatory pathways. Ω-3 FA also increase LPS-suppressing bacteria (i.e., Bifidobacteria) and decrease LPS-producing bacteria (i.e., Enterobacteria). Additionally, ω-3 FA appear to promote short-chain FA production. Therefore, combining probiotics with ω-3 FA presents a promising strategy to promote beneficial immune regulation via the gut microbiota, with potential beneficial effects on conditions of inflammatory origin, as commonly experienced by aged and obese individuals, as well as improvements in gut-brain-axis communication.","Hutchinson, Ashley N; Tingö, Lina; Brummer, Robert Jan",Nutrients,107,1

METHODOLOGY We searched PubMed, LILACS, Cochrane and Google Scholar. The studies were divided in two groups: randomized and observational studies, from 1990 to 2018 that included patients with severe preeclampsia before 34 weeks of gestation with pregnancy prolongation ≥48 h but that did not include fetal growth restriction or HELLP syndrome at the beginning. The main variables recorded were maternal and perinatal complications. MAIN RESULTS Forty-four studies met the inclusion criteria, and 5 of these were randomized. The average pregnancy prolongation was 9 days, with no difference between groups. Maternal complications were significantly more common in observational studies, RR = 0.71, 95% CI (0.54-0.93), p = .009. Perinatal complications were also significantly more common in observational studies (RR = 0.89, 95% CI (0.80-0.98), p = .01) at the expense of stillbirth and neonatal deaths. The percentages of cesarean sections were significantly higher in randomized studies, RR = 1.54, 95% CI (1.46-1.64). There were 2 maternal deaths, both in observational studies. CONCLUSION Observational studies in which conservative management of early-onset preeclampsia is performed and do not include patients with fetal growth restriction or patients with HELLP syndrome and where at least 2 days of pregnancy prolongation is achieved are associated with significantly more maternal and perinatal complications.","Vigil-De Gracia, Paulino; Ludmir, Jack","The journal of maternal-fetal & neonatal medicine : the official journal of the European Association of Perinatal Medicine, the Federation of Asia and Oceania Perinatal Societies, the International Society of Perinatal Obstetricians",107,1

Accumulating evidence has suggested that the therapeutic effects of MSCs are not due to their direct differentiation into functional β-cells but are instead mediated by their paracrine functions. Among them, exosomes, nano-sized extracellular vesicles, are important substances that exert paracrine functions. However, the underlying mechanisms of exosomes in ameliorating T2DM remain largely unknown. METHODS Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell (bmMSC)-derived exosomes (bmMDEs) were administrated to T2DM rats and high-glucose-treated primary islets in order to detect their effects on β-cell dedifferentiation. Differential miRNAs were then screened via miRNA sequencing, and miR-146a was isolated after functional verification. TargetScan, reporter gene detection, insulin secretion assays, and qPCR validation were used to predict downstream target genes and involved signaling pathways of miR-146a. RESULTS Our results showed that bmMDEs reversed diabetic β-cell dedifferentiation and improved β-cell insulin secretion both in vitro and in vivo. Results of miRNA sequencing in bmMDEs and subsequent functional screening demonstrated that miR-146a, a highly conserved miRNA, improved β-cell function. We further found that miR-146a directly targeted Numb, a membrane-bound protein involved in cell fate determination, leading to activation of β-catenin signaling in β-cells. Exosomes derived from miR-146a-knockdown bmMSCs lost the ability to improve β-cell function. CONCLUSIONS These findings demonstrate that bmMSC-derived exosomal miR-146a protects against diabetic β-cell dysfunction by acting on the NUMB/β-catenin signaling pathway, which may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for T2DM.","He, Qin; Song, Jia; Cui, Chen; Wang, Jinbang; Hu, Huiqing; Guo, Xinghong; Yang, Mengmeng; Wang, Lingshu; Yan, Fei; Liang, Kai; Liu, Zhaojian; Liu, Fuqiang; Sun, Zheng; Dong, Ming; Hou, Xinguo; Chen, Li",Stem cell research & therapy,107,17

Implementation of DISE with propofol requires a dosing strategy that reliably and efficiently produces obstruction while minimizing oxygen desaturation. METHODS The surgeon in a prospective study of transoral robotic resection of the tongue base enrolled 97 patients with obstructive sleep apnea confirmed by polysomnography who failed continuous positive airway pressure. All patients were screened by DISE. Propofol dose was determined using custom software written in MATLAB, which has been previously described. Studies were performed in an operating room with standard monitors and resuscitation equipment. No topical anesthesia was used, and no IV drugs other than propofol were used. All patients received 2 L/min supplemental oxygen via a nasal cannula placed in the mouth. After initiation of propofol sedation, a pediatric bronchoscope was positioned via the naris to observe the velopharynx. The sedation sequence was continued until the clinical end point of obstruction onset was noted. Observation of the pharynx was performed for a sufficient period to obtain images of the anatomic site(s) of obstruction. The infusion was then terminated. Statistical analysis was performed with MATLAB (MathWorks, version 2012b). Comparison of saturation nadirs between DISE and subject sleep studies was performed with both the paired and unpaired Student t test. RESULTS The subject population was characterized by a median body mass index of 32.1 (interquartile range [IQR] 6.8) kg/m and apnea-hypopnea index of 48 (IQR 32). All patients demonstrated obstruction within the design variables. Obstruction was observed after 236 (±57.9) seconds at an estimated effect-site concentration of 4.2 ± 1.3 mcg/mL. The median saturation nadir during DISE was significantly higher (91.4% (IQR 5.1)) than that during standard sleep studies (81.0% [IQR 11.2], P < 0.0001). Ninety-five percent confidence intervals for correlations between DISE saturation nadir and body mass index, age, apnea-hypopnea index, or administered propofol dose included zero in all cases. CONCLUSIONS A propofol infusion strategy that requires limited experience with propofol dose selection and only 1 pump dosing change reliably produced airway obstruction in patients with severe sleep apnea. Clinical obstruction was achieved faster than target-controlled infusion-based systems for similar procedures reported in the literature. The observed degree of oxygen desaturation in the model system was within a clinically acceptable range.","Atkins, Joshua H; Mandel, Jeff E; Rosanova, Giulia",Anesthesia and analgesia,107,13

METHODS Medline, Embase, Cochrane, and PEDro databases were screened, from inception to April 2015, in search for randomized clinical trials (RCT) of home-based exercise interventions versus individualized and supervised outpatient physical therapy after primary TKA. Target outcomes were: knee range of motion (ROM), patient-reported pain and function, functional performance, and safety. Risk of bias was assessed with the PEDro scale. After assessing homogeneity, data were combined using random effects meta-analysis and reported as standardized mean differences or mean differences. We set a non-inferiority margin of four points in mean differences. RESULTS The search and selection process identified 11 RCT of moderate quality and small sample sizes. ROM active extension data suitable for meta-analysis was available from seven studies with 707 patients, and ROM active flexion from nine studies with 983 patients. Most studies showed no difference between groups. Pooled differences were within the non-inferiority margin. Most meta-analyses showed significant statistical heterogeneity.

The present investigation summarizes the clinical characteristics and early prognosis of COVID-19 infection in a cohort of patients with fractures. METHODS Data on 10 patients with a fracture and COVID-19 were collected from 8 different hospitals located in the Hubei province from January 1, 2020, to February 27, 2020. Analyses of early prognosis were based on clinical outcomes and trends in laboratory results during treatment. RESULTS All 10 patients presented with limited activity related to the fracture. The most common signs were fever, cough, and fatigue at the time of presentation (7 patients each). Other, less common signs included sore throat (4 patients), dyspnea (5 patients), chest pain (1 patient), nasal congestion (1 patient), headache (1 patient), dizziness (3 patients), abdominal pain (1 patient), and vomiting (1 patient). Lymphopenia (<1.0 × 10 cells/L) was identified in 6 of 10 patients, 9 of 9 patients had a high serum level of D-dimer, and 9 of 9 patients had a high level of C-reactive protein. Three patients underwent surgery, whereas the others were managed nonoperatively because of their compromised status. Four patients died on day 8 (3 patients) or day 14 (1 patient) after admission. The clinical outcomes for the surviving patients are not yet determined. CONCLUSIONS The clinical characteristics and early prognosis of COVID-19 in patients with fracture tended to be more severe than those reported for adult patients with COVID-19 without fracture. This finding may be related to the duration between the development of symptoms and presentation. Surgical treatment should be carried out cautiously or nonoperative care should be chosen for patients with fracture in COVID-19-affected areas, especially older individuals with intertrochanteric fractures.

Although the currently available anti-inflammatory therapies have had little impact on intestinal fibrosis in Crohn's disease (CD), increased understanding of the pathophysiology and the development of therapies targeting fibrogenic pathways hold promise for the future. One of the critical challenges is how reduction or reversal of intestinal fibrosis should be defined and measured in the setting of clinical trials and drug approval. The International Organization for Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IOIBD) organized a workshop in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, on December 19th and 20th, 2018 in an attempt to review the current knowledge of the biological background, diagnosis, treatment of intestinal fibrosis and clinical trial endpoints. Basic and clinical scientists discussed the pathophysiology of intestinal fibrosis, the current status of biomarkers and imaging modalities in stenosing CD, and recent clinical studies in this area. Researchers from outside of the IBD field presented advances in the understanding of fibrotic processes in other organs, such as the skin, liver and lungs. Lastly, the design of clinical trials with antifibrotic therapy for IBD was discussed, with priority on patient populations, patient reported outcomes (PROs) and imaging. This report summarizes the key findings, discussions and conclusions of the workshop.","D'Haens, Geert; Rieder, Florian; Feagan, Brian G; Higgins, Peter D R; Panes, Julian; Maaser, Christian; Rogler, Gerhard; Löwenberg, Mark; van der Voort, Robbert; Pinzani, Massimo; Peyrin-Biroulet, Laurent; Danese, Silvio",Gastroenterology,107,32

The objective of this scoping review was to conduct an evaluation of studies using spatial statistics approaches for national health survey data in the SSA region. An organized literature search for studies related to spatial statistics and national health surveys was conducted through PMC, PubMed/Medline, Scopus, NLM Catalog, and Science Direct electronic databases. Of the 4,193 unique articles identified, 153 were included in the final review. Spatial smoothing and prediction methods were predominant (n = 108), followed by spatial description aggregation (n = 25), and spatial autocorrelation and clustering (n = 19). Bayesian statistics methods and lattice data modelling were predominant (n = 108). Most studies focused on malaria and fever (n = 47) followed by health services coverage (n = 38). Only fifteen studies employed nonstandard spatial analyses (e.g., spatial model assessment, joint spatial modelling, accounting for survey design). We recommend that for future spatial analysis using health survey data in the SSA region, there must be an improve recognition and awareness of the potential dangers of a naïve application of spatial statistical methods. We also recommend a wide range of applications using big health data and the future of data science for health systems to monitor and evaluate impacts that are not well understood at local levels.","Manda, Samuel; Haushona, Ndamonaonghenda; Bergquist, Robert",International journal of environmental research and public health,107,1

STUDY DESIGN Prospective observational study. METHODS ADHERE captures UAS outcomes including apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS), therapy usage, patient satisfaction, clinician assessment, and safety over a 1-year period. BMI ≤32 kg/m2 (BMI32 ) and 32 < BMI ≤35 kg/m2 (BMI35 ) group outcomes were examined. RESULTS One thousand eight hundred forty-nine patients enrolled in ADHERE, 1,019 reached final visit, 843 completed the visit. Significant changes in AHI (-20.9, P < .0001) and ESS (- 4.4, P < .0001) were demonstrated. Mean therapy usage was 5.6 ± 2.2 hr/day. Significant therapy use difference was present in patients with reported discomfort versus no discomfort (4.9 ± 2.5 vs. 5.7 ± 2.1 hr/day, P = .01). Patients with discomfort had higher final visit mean AHI versus without discomfort (18.9 ± 18.5 vs. 13.5 ± 13.7 events/hr, P = .01). Changes in AHI and ESS were not significantly different. Serious adverse events reported in 2.3% of patients. Device revision rate was 1.9%. Surgical success was less likely in BMI35 versus BMI32 patients (59.8% vs. 72.2%, P = .02). There was a significant therapy use difference: 5.8 ± 2.0 hr/day in BMI32 versus 5.2 ± 2.2 hr/day in BMI35 (P = .028). CONCLUSIONS Data from ADHERE demonstrate high efficacy rates for UAS. Although surgical response rate differs between BMI32 and BMI35 patient groups, the AHI and ESS reduction is similar. Discomfort affects therapy adherence and efficacy. Thus, proper therapy settings adjustment to ensure comfort is imperative to improve outcomes.

A 15-items questionnaire evaluating satisfaction was carried out remotely (score ranging from 1 to 10). Primary outcome was satisfaction with consultation allowing the comparison of a group preferring FC (FC+) against a group in favor or equivalent of PbC (PbC +).Results30 patients were recruited (mean age 26.93 years old (4.9 SD), Male 56%. Diagnoses were SCZ 60% and FEP 40%. 20/30 participants belonged to (FC+) group. Total scores of satisfaction for the PbC differed between the (PbC+) group (mean 9 (1.69 SD)) and (FC+) group (mean 6.80, (1.32 SD)) p < 0.05. The (FC+) group tends to have PbC more frequently (40%) than the (PbC+) group (10%) and to find the phone interface more stressfull (40%) than the PbC+ group (10%). The (FC+) group tends to less wish (40%) PbC follow up in future than the (PbC+) group (90%).ConclusionsThis study shows that the PbCs were favorably evaluated by a third of the patients. The anxiety-inducing experience of the PbC in the (FC+) group could be explained by the severity of their pathology.","Kiesmann, E.; Mallet, J.; Charlot, V.; Dubertret, C.",European Psychiatry,107,11

We sought to evaluate whether current levels of vaccine coverage and contact reduction could mitigate a potential 4th wave fueled by the Delta variant, or whether the reinstitution of more intense public health measures will be required. Methods: We developed an age-stratified dynamic transmission model of COVID-19 in a mid-sized city (population 500,000) currently experiencing a relatively low, but increasing, infection rate in Step 3 of Ontario's Wave 3 recovery. We parameterized the model using the medical literature, grey literature, and government reports. We estimated the current level of contact reduction by model calibration to cases and hospitalizations. We projected the number of infections, number of hospitalizations, and the time to re-instate high intensity public health measures over the fall of 2021 under different levels of vaccine coverage and contact reduction. Results: Maintaining contact reductions at the current level, estimated to be a 17% reduction compared to pre-pandemic contact levels, results in COVID-related admissions exceeding 20% of pre-pandemic critical care capacity by late October, leading to cancellation of elective surgeries and other non-COVID health services. At high levels of vaccination and relatively high levels of mask wearing, a moderate additional effort to reduce contacts (30% reduction compared to pre-pandemic contact levels), is necessary to avoid re-instating intensive public health measures. Compared to prior waves, the age distribution of both cases and hospitalizations shifts younger and the estimated number of pediatric critical care hospitalizations may substantially exceed 20% of capacity. Discussion: High rates of vaccination coverage in people over the age of 12 and mask wearing in public settings will not be sufficient to prevent an overwhelming resurgence of COVID-19 in the Fall of 2021. Our analysis indicates that immediate moderate public health measures can prevent the necessity for more intense and disruptive measures later.","Cipriano, L. E.; Haddara, W. M.

As an effective treatment with few side effects, music therapy has been used to reduce anxiety for decades in clinical practice. Yet therapists continue to perform music selection, a key step in music therapy, manually. Considering the growing need for music therapy services and social distancing amid public emergencies, an automatic method for music selection would be of great practical utility. This paper marks the first effort to identify music with therapeutic effects on anxiety reduction via a novel music scoring model. We formulate the calculation of a therapeutic score as a quadratic programming problem, which minimizes score variance among known therapeutic songs while maintaining their superiority over other songs. The proposed model can uncover common features that contribute to anxiety reduction by learning from small and unbalanced data. Using a music therapy experiment, we find that the proposed model outperforms existing techniques in predicting therapeutic songs. Feature analysis is also conducted, revealing that high-frequency spectrums are important in therapeutic scoring.","Chen, G.; Hu, Z. J.; Guan, N. H.; Wang, X.

An adequate immune response is vital in counteracting the unwanted activities of pathogens such as bacteria, protozoa, and viruses. Some diseases caused by viral pathogens such as measles, chickenpox, Ebola, and human immunodeficiency virus may result in death or dire consequences in mammals with inadequate immunity. Ever since coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) boisterously announced itself to the world in December 2019, there has been a surge in the number of researches targeting medicinal plants as candidates for a potent vaccine and antiviral drug. COVID-19 is a member of a family of coronaviruses that have been responsible for past pandemics such as the Middle East respiratory syndrome and severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreaks. However, the nascent COVID-19 defeated existing pharmaceutical advances and nonpharmacological measures such as high personal hygiene, physical distancing, and lockdown to stop the vicious mortality arising from the viral outbreak. Consequently, the battle against this virus relies majorly on a vibrant immune system. It is therefore imperative to promote interest in the use of medicinal plants that will significantly assist in the management of COVID-19 infection by boosting body's immune responses or arresting symptoms/molecules associated with COVID-19 pathogenesis. This review underscores the need for the exploration of plant-based agents that may prove effective in fighting COVID-19 based on scientific evidence of their positive immunomodulatory effects.","Ogunrinola, Olabisi O.; Kanmodi, Rahmon I.; Ogunrinola, Oluwaseyi A.",Food Frontiers,107,22

The transmission of aggregates requires neuron-released Tau to interact with surface receptors on target cells. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms in astrocytes and downstream effects are unclear. Here, using a spatially resolved proteomic mapping strategy, we show that integrin αV/β1 receptor binds recombinant human Tau, mediating the entry of Tau fibrils in astrocytes. The binding of distinct Tau species to the astrocytic αV/β1 receptor differentially activate integrin signaling. Furthermore, Tau-mediated activation of integrin signaling results in NFκB activation, causing upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, induction of a sub-group of neurotoxic astrocytic markers, and release of neurotoxic factors. Our findings suggest that filamentous recombinant human Tau-mediated activation of integrin signaling induces astrocyte conversion towards a neurotoxic state, providing a mechanistic insight into tauopathies.","Wang, Peng; Ye, Yihong",bioRxiv,107,29

We also sought to understand how various environmental and organizational features may have influenced these conditions and thus the likelihood of learning taking place. We find principals reported varied levels of psychological safety in their schools with associated differing levels of organizational learning and responsiveness to the crisis. However, rather being grounded in environmental conditions (e.g., urbanicity, demographics, etc.), organizational factors and specifically, differences in accountability, principal autonomy, professional culture and teacher decision-making were all key in the degree of psychological safety exhibited. Together, these findings serve to expand understanding of leadership as creating conditions for learning and give insight into the degree our pre-COVID-19 system may have facilitated or stymied the ability or capacity of school leaders in different settings to support transformational learning.

Given Pakistan's large young population and gender and urban-rural inequalities in access to education, training and employment, such investments offer opportunities. LEAPS is a youth-led ECCE program that trains female youth, 18-24 years, as Community Youth Leaders (CYLs) to deliver high quality ECCE for children, 3.5-5.5 years, in rural Sindh, Pakistan. Methods: We use a stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial to evaluate implementation of LEAPS. Ninety nine clusters will be randomized to receive the intervention in one of three seven-month steps (33 clusters/step). Primary outcomes are children's school readiness (measured with the International Development and Early Learning Assessment) and executive functions. Secondary outcomes are youth personal and professional development, depressive symptoms, and executive functions. Data is collected in cross-sectional surveys of 1,089 children (11 children/cluster from 99 clusters) aged 4.5-5.5 years at four time points (baseline and at the end of each step). We will enroll three youth participant open cohorts, one per step (33 CYLs: 66 comparison youth per cohort; 99:198 in total). Youth cohorts will be assessed at enrollment and every six to seven months thereafter (i.e., once per consecutive Step). A school cohort of 330 LEAPS students (10 students/cluster from 33 clusters) will be enrolled and assessed during Step 1 after intervention rollout and at endline. The quality of the learning environment will be assessed in each LEAPS ECCE center and in a comparison center at two time points midway following rollout and at endline. A concurrent mixed-methods implementation evaluation will assess program fidelity and quality, as well as the extent to which a technical support strategy is successful in strengthening systems for program expansion. A cost evaluation will assess cost-per-beneficiary. Data collection for implementation and cost evaluations will occur in Step 3. Discussion: Youth-led models for ECCE offer a promising approach to support young children and youth; however, there is little empirical evidence on real-world implementation. This study will contribute to the evidence as a means to promote sustainable human development across multiple SDG targets.","Yousafzai, A. K.; Sudfeld, C. R.; Franchett, E.

Similarly, viral infections can exert diverse selective pressures on populations of clonally related T cells. Technical limitations have nevertheless made it challenging to investigate the relationship between clonal selection and transcriptional phenotypes of virus-specific T cells. We therefore performed single-cell T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire and transcriptome sequencing of virus-specific CD8 T cells in murine models of acute, chronic and latent infection. We observed clear infection-specific populations corresponding to memory, effector, exhausted, and inflationary phenotypes. We further uncovered a mouse-specific and polyclonal T cell response, despite all T cells sharing specificity to a single viral epitope, which was accompanied by stereotypic TCR germline gene usage in all three infection types. Persistent antigen exposure during chronic and latent viral infections resulted in a higher proportion of clonally expanded T cells relative to acute infection. We furthermore observed a relationship between transcriptional heterogeneity and clonal expansion for all three infections, with highly expanded clones having distinct transcriptional phenotypes relative to lowly expanded clones. Finally, we developed and utilized a bioinformatic pipeline integrating pseudotime and clonality, termed Clonotyme, to further support a model in which expanded virus-specific CD8+ T cells adopt heterogenic, yet preferentially, effector-like phenotypes. Together our work relates clonal selection to gene expression in the context of viral infection and further provides a dataset and accompanying software for the immunological community.","Kuhn, Raphael; Sandu, Ioana; Agrafiotis, Andreas; Hong, Kai-Lin; Neumeier, Daniel; Merkler, Doron; Oxenius, Annette; Reddy, Sai T.; Yermanos, Alexander",bioRxiv,107,20

Buprenorphine/naloxone treatment is associated with improved pregnancy and fetal outcomes, but prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, there were multiple barriers to accessing buprenorphine/naloxone during pregnancy. Care disruptions during the pandemic may have further exacerbated these already existing barriers. To quantify these changes, we examined trends in the number of individuals filling prescriptions for prenatal buprenorphine/naloxone prescriptions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We estimated an interrupted time series model using linked national pharmacy claims and medical claims data from May 2019 to December 2020. We estimated changes in the level and trend in the monthly number of individuals filling prescriptions for prenatal buprenorphine/naloxone during the COVID-19 pandemic. We then stratified our analyses by payer. Results: We identified 2,947 pregnant patients filling buprenorphine/naloxone prescriptions. Before the pandemic, there was positive growth in the monthly number of individuals filling prescriptions for prenatal buprenorphine/naloxone (4.83% (95% confidence interval (CI): 3.40% to 6.26%). During the pandemic, the monthly growth rate in individuals filling prescriptions for prenatal buprenorphine/naloxone declined for both patients on commercial insurance and patients on Medicaid (all payers: -5.53% (95% CI: -7.28% to -3.78%); Medicaid: -7.66% (95% CI: -10.42% to -4.90%); Commercial: -3.59% (95% CI: -5.53% to -1.66%)).

Data were empirically validated using the two-staged structural equation model (SEM)-neural network analysis approach.FindingsThe robustness of the classical UTAUT model remains intact in the context of online pharmacy adoption. Among the integrated variables, while perceived trust and health literacy were found significant, perceived risk and personal innovativeness were found insignificant in determining consumers’ intention to adopt online pharmacy. The neural network analysis provided further verification of these findings derived from the SEM.Practical implicationsThe findings of this study would facilitate in devising better strategies for entering or expanding online pharmacy business in developing countries such as Bangladesh.Originality/valueThe originality of the current study relates to the two-fold contributions of this study. First, while this study extended the classical UTAUT model by incorporating perceived risk, perceived trust, personal innovativeness and health literacy, the inclusion of the following two variables is fresh within the extant online pharmacy literature. Second, by using a two-staged SEM-neural network analysis approach, this study advances the past studies on e-commerce adoption in pharmaceutical settings and provides a general understanding of the customers of developing countries.","Md Mahiuddin, Sabbir Islam Mazharul Das Samir",Journal of Science and Technology Policy Management,107,20

To address this question, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure neural responses evoked by food and social cues after participants (n=40) experienced ten hours of mandated fasting or total social isolation. After isolation, people felt lonely and craved social interaction. Midbrain regions showed selective activation to food cues after fasting and to social cues after isolation; these responses were correlated with self-reported craving. By contrast, striatal and cortical regions differentiated between craving food versus social interaction. Across deprivation sessions, we find that deprivation narrows and focuses the brain’s motivational responses to the deprived target. Our results support the intuitive idea that acute isolation causes social craving, similar to the way fasting causes hunger.","Tomova, Livia; Wang, Kimberly L.; Thompson, Todd; Matthews, Gillian A.; Takahashi, Atsushi; Tye, Kay M.; Saxe, Rebecca",bioRxiv,107,1

Our survey includes a broad range of stressors (15 explanatory variables) specific to high schoolers, controls (4 factors for pre-existing conditions), and mental health estimators (7 dependent variables) to identify changes in mental wellbeing during the pandemic. The results (n = 107) show good consistency in our estimators (Cronbach's alpha = 0.78) and statistically significant (t = 0.636, p << 0.001) degradation in the mental health. Correlation (r = 0.2, p = 0.034) and regression analysis showed that online learning (beta 1 = -0.96, p = 0.004) has the most influence on degradation in mental health, with some race-based differences. Exercise time helps reduce mental health degradation (beta 3 = -0.153, p = 0.037). Many other factors such as gender, homework time, school time, pre-existing mental health issues, and therapy did not have a significant influence on mental health degradation. Analysis of freeform feedback identified the following three recurring themes: increased stress due homework (13.2%), social isolation or lack of social interactions (8.5%), and lack of support for mental wellbeing (12.3%).","Rao, M.

Yet, it remains uncertain to exert the antiviral effect of CT-P59 on the Delta and its associated variants (L452R). To tackle this question, we carried out cell tests and animal study. CT-P59 showed reduced antiviral activity but enabled neutralization against Delta, Epsilon, and Kappa variants in cells. In line with in vitro results, the mouse challenge experiment with the Delta variant substantiated in vivo potency of CT-P59 showing symptom remission and virus abrogation in the respiratory tract. Collectively, cell and animal studies showed that CT-P59 is effective against the Delta variant infection, hinting that CT-P59 has therapeutic potency for patients infected with Delta and its associated variants. Highlights CT-P59 exerts the antiviral effect on authentic Delta, Epsilon and Kappa variants in cell-based experiments. CT-P59 showed neutralizing potency against variants including Delta, Epsilon, Kappa, L452R, T478K and P681H pseudovirus variants.

Replication of SARS-CoV-2 is characterised by transcription and replication of genomic length RNA and shorter subgenomic RNAs to produce virus proteins and ultimately progeny virions. Here we explore the pattern of both genome-length and subgenomic RNAs and positive and negative strand SARS-CoV-2 RNAs in diagnostic nasopharyngeal swabs using sensitive probe based PCR assays as well as Ampliseq panels designed to target subgenomic RNAs. Using these assays, we measured the ratios of genomic to subgenomic RNAs as well as the ratios of positive to negative strand RNAs in SARS-CoV-2 positive nasopharyngeal swab samples. We found that while subgenomic RNAs and negative strand RNA can be readily detected in swab samples taken up to 19 and 17 days post symptom onset respectively, and therefore their detection alone is not likely an indicator of active SARS-CoV-2 replication. However, the ratios of genomic-length to subgenomic RNA and also of positive to negative strand RNA were elevated in some swabs, particularly those collected around the onset of clinical symptoms or in an individual with decreasing PCR Cts in successive swab samples. We tentatively conclude that it may be possible to refine such molecular assays to help determine if active replication of virus is occurring and progeny virions likely present in a SARS-CoV-2 positive individual. Assays targeting subgenomic N or ORF7a RNAs as well as strand specific ORF7a total genome-length and subgenomic RNAs may be the most sensitive for this purpose as these targets were consistently the most abundant in the swab samples.","Chamings, A.; Bhatta, T.

The altered input to spinal circuits below the lesion leads to maladaptive reorganisation which often leads to hyperreflexia in proprioceptive circuits. Neurotrophin 3 (NT3) is growth factor essential for the development of proprioceptive neurons. We have previously shown that following bilateral corticospinal tract axotomy, intramuscular delivery of an Adeno-Associated Viral vector encoding NT3 (AAV-NT3) induces proprioceptive circuit reorganisation linked to functional recovery. To assess its therapeutic effects following a clinically relevant bilateral C5-C6 contusion in rats, AAV-NT3 was injected intramuscularly into the dominant limb 24 hours after injury and forelimb function was assessed over 13 weeks. The injury generated hyperreflexia of a distal forelimb proprioceptive circuit. There was also loss of fine motor skills during reach-and-grasp and walking on a horizontal ladder. Ex vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed atrophy of the spinal cord and white matter disruption throughout the lesion site together with extensive loss of grey matter. Unexpectedly, animals treated with AAV-NT3 had a slightly smaller lesion in the regions close to the epicentre compared to PBS treated animals. Rats treated with AAV-NT3 showed subtly better performance on the horizontal ladder and transient benefits on reach-and-grasp. AAV-NT3 did not normalise hyperreflexia in a treated muscle. The treatment increased the amount of NT3 in treated muscles but, unexpectedly, serum levels were only elevated in a small subset of animals. These results show that this dose and delivery of AAV-NT3 may generate subtle improvements in locomotion but additional treatments will be required to overcome the widespread sensorimotor deficits caused by contusion injury.","Sydney Smith, Jared D.; Megaro, Vanessa; Spejo, Aline Barroso; Moon, Lawrence D.

Although chlorhexidine (CHD) has been shown to be effective, it is associated with serious anaphylaxis reactions. Biofilm disrupters (BDs) are novel agents with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity. BDs have been used in the management of chronic wounds and to sterilize environmental surfaces. The goal of this study was to evaluate BDs against polymicrobial biofilms compared to CHD. Methodology We evaluated various BDs (BlastX, Torrent, NSSD) and CHD against Candida spp and S. aureus polymicrobial biofilms by zone of inhibition, biofilm, and time-kill assays. Effectiveness was based on the inhibition zone and the reduction of CFU, respectively, compared to the drug-free control. Results All BDs and CHD inhibited C. auris growth effectively in a concentration-dependent manner. Additionally, CHD and the BDs all showed excellent antimicrobial activity against polymicrobial biofilms. BDs were all highly effective against both C. auris isolates, whereas CHD was only moderately effective against C. auris 0386, suggesting resistance/tolerance. A comparative analysis of the BDs and CHD against C. auris and C. albicans by biofilm kill-curves showed at least 99.999% killing. Conclusions All three BDs and CHD have excellent activity against different Candida species, including C. auris. However, certain isolates of C. auris showed resistance/tolerance to CHD, but not to the BDs. The fungicidal activity of these novel agents will be valuable in eradicating surface colonization of Candida spp, including C. auris.","Cox, Claudia A; Vazquez, Jose A; Wakade, Sushama; Bogacz, Marek; Myntti, Matthew; Manavathu, Elias K",bioRxiv,107,19

Results: Findings from this study provide valuable insights from people with lived experience and staff on the complexity underpinning high mortality rates for individuals experiencing multiple and complex needs. Mental ill-health and substance misuse (often co-occurring dual diagnosis) were highlighted as significant factors underlying premature mortality among multiple and complex needs groups. Potential triggers to identify people at-risk included critical life events (e.g. bereavement, relationship breakdown) and transitions (e.g. release from prison, completion of drug treatment). Early prevention, particularly supporting young people experiencing adverse childhood experiences was also highlighted as a priority. Conclusion: High mortality in MCN groups may be reduced by addressing dual diagnosis, providing more support at critical life events, and investing in early prevention efforts.

OBJECTIVE To evaluate the efficacy and safety of CQ and HCQ in the treatment of COVID-19. DATA SOURCES We systematically searched the PubMed, Embase, MEDLINE, Cochrane CENTRAL, CINAHL, Scopus, Joanna Briggs Institute Database, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR) for all articles published between 01 January 2020 to 15 September 2020 on CQ/HCQ and COVID-19 using a predefined search protocol; without any language restrictions. A search of grey literature repositories (New York Academy of Medicine Grey Literature and Open Grey), and pre-publication server deposits (medRxIV and bioRxIV) was also performed. STUDY SELECTION Randomized clinical trials (RCT) which compared CQ/HCQ to standard supportive therapy in treating COVID-19 were included. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Data were extracted from original publications by four independent reviewers. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration's assessment tool. Data were meta-analyzed using a random-effect models. Results are reported according to PRISMA guidelines. Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s): The primary prespecified efficacy outcome was all-cause mortality. The primary safety outcome was any adverse effect attributed to use of CQ/HCQ. RESULTS Eight RCTs were included and pooled in the mortality meta-analysis (6,592 unique participants; mean age = 59.4 years; 42% women). CQ/HCQ did not show any mortality benefit when compared to standard supportive therapy (Pooled Relative Risk [RR] 1.07; 95% CI = 0.97-1.18; I2 statistic = 0.00%).

It has become a common therapy for patients with respiratory failure. However, independent measurement of heat and humidity during HFNC and comparison of HFNC devices are lacking. METHODS We evaluated 2 HFNC (Airvo 2 and Optiflow system) devices. Each HFNC was connected to simulated external nares using the manufacturer's standard circuit. The Airvo 2 outlet-chamber temperature was set at 37°C. The Optiflow system incorporated an O2/air blender and a heated humidifier, which was set at 40°C/3. For both systems, HFNC flow was tested at 20, 40, and 50 L/min. Simulating spontaneous breathing using a mechanical ventilator and TTL test lung, we tested tidal volumes (VT) of 300, 500, and 700 mL, and breathing frequencies of 10 and 20 breaths/min. The TTL was connected to the simulated external nares with a standard ventilator circuit. To prevent condensation, the circuit was placed in an incubator maintained at 37°C. Small, medium, and large nasal prongs were tested. Absolute humidity (AH) of inspired gas was measured at the simulated external nares. RESULTS At 20, 40, and 50 L/min of flow, respective AH values for the Airvo 2 were 35.3 ± 2.0, 37.1 ± 2.2, and 37.6 ± 2.1 mg/L, and for the Optiflow system, 33.1 ± 1.5, 35.9 ± 1.7, and 36.2 ± 1.8 mg/L. AH was lower at 20 L/min of HFNC flow than at 40 and 50 L/min (P < .01). While AH remained constant at 40 and 50 L/min, at 20 L/min of HFNC flow, AH decreased as VT increased for both devices. CONCLUSIONS During bench use of HFNC, AH increased with increasing HFNC flow. When the inspiratory flow of spontaneous breathing exceeded the HFNC flow, AH was influenced by VT. At all experimental settings, AH remained > 30 mg/L.","Chikata, Yusuke; Izawa, Masayo; Okuda, Nao; Itagaki, Taiga; Nakataki, Emiko; Onodera, Mutsuo; Imanaka, Hideaki; Nishimura, Masaji",Respiratory care,107,1

When who-infects-whom is observed, we derive a profile likelihood maximized over all possible baseline hazard functions that is similar to the Cox partial likelihood. When who-infects-whom is not observed, we derive an EM algorithm to maximize the profile likelihood integrated over all possible combinations of who-infected-whom. This extends the most important class of regression models in survival analysis to infectious disease epidemiology.

Both viruses use N-acetyl-9-O-acetylneuraminic acid as a receptor determinant for attachment to cells. Virus binding assays with immobilized proteins indicated that a glycoprotein of 40 kDa is the major surface protein containing the receptor determinant for the two viruses. MDCK cells grown on filters for permeable support were found to have differential sensitivity to infection by these viruses. Both viruses were able to initiate infection via the apical domain of the plasma membrane, but only influenza C virus also accomplished infection via the basolateral plasma membrane. The resistance of MDCK cells to BCV infection from the basal filter chamber was overcome when the cell polarity was abolished by maintaining the cells in calcium-free medium. This finding indicates that the resistance to basolateral infection by BCV is a property of the cell line and not due to a technical problem related to the use of filters.

HCoV-229E infection was facilitated by crossing APN transgenic mice into signal transducers and activators of transcription (Stat) 1 null mice and by adaptation of HCoV-229E to grow in primary APN transgenic, Stat1 null fibroblasts. Double transgenic mice allow the study of human coronavirus group 1 infections in an animal model, in particular, viral tropism, replication, recombination, and spread in an immunocompromised situation. Furthermore, these mice provide an important tool for the evaluation of biosafety and efficacy of coronavirus-based vectors.","Lassnig, Caroline; Sanchez, Carlos M; Egerbacher, Monika; Walter, Ingrid; Majer, Susanne; Kolbe, Thomas; Pallares, Pilar; Enjuanes, Luis; Müller, Mathias",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,107,20

A hitherto unknown animal coronavirus (CoV) that had crossed the species barrier through close contact of humans with infected animals was identified as the etiological agent. It rapidly adapted to the new host and not only became readily transmissible between humans but also more pathogenic. Air travel spread it rapidly around the world and ultimately the virus infected 8096 people and caused 774 deaths in 26 countries on 5 continents. Aggressive quarantine measures successfully terminated the disease. Currently, there are no SARS cases recorded and most likely the virus no longer circulates in the human population. In this review we present an overview over SARS-Co virus biology, the disease and discuss strategies to develop antiviral drugs and vaccines.","Stadler, K; Rappuoli, R",Current molecular medicine,107,24

OBJECTIVE: To examine the effect of COVID-19-related state closures on consumer spending, business revenue, and employment, while controlling for changes in COVID-19 incidence and death. DESIGN: The analysis estimated a difference-in-difference model, utilizing temporal and geographic variation in state closure orders to analyze their impact on the economy, while controlling for COVID-19 incidence and death. PARTICIPANTS: State-level data on economic outcomes from the Opportunity Insights data tracker and COVID-19 cases and death data from usafacts.org. INTERVENTIONS: The mitigation strategy analyzed within this study was COVID-19-related state closure orders. Data on these orders were obtained from state government Web sites containing executive or administrative orders. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcomes include state-level estimates of consumer spending, business revenue, and employment levels. RESULTS: Analyses showed that although state closures led to a decrease in consumer spending, business revenue, and employment, they accounted for only a small portion of the observed decreases in these outcomes over the first wave of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: The impact of COVID-19 on economic activity likely reflects a combination of factors, in addition to state closures, such as individuals' perceptions of risk related to COVID-19 incidence, which may play significant roles in impacting economic activity.","Dunphy, Christopher; Miller, Gabrielle F; Rice, Ketra; Vo, Linda; Sunshine, Gregory; McCord, Russell; Howard-Williams, Mara; Coronado, Fátima",J. public health manag. pract.

The CEO/HPCD composite was characterized by UV-visible spectrophotometry and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and the changes in the principal components of CEO upon encapsulation by HPCD were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The physicochemical properties, release kinetics and antimicrobial activity of the fabricated gels were investigated. The hardness of the KC gels increased with composite concentration in the range of 1.0-3.0% (w/v) and thereafter decreased. A similar trend was observed for the gumminess and chewiness, whereas the gel springiness remained essentially constant. The CEO/HPCD composite also enhanced the fluidity of the system, and the syneresis was positively correlated with the composite concentration. The controlled release of CEO from the gels was affected by the relative humidity (RH) and CEO content. The Ritger-Peppas model indicated that the CEO release kinetics from the gels proceeded through a combination of diffusion and framework erosion. The KC gel containing 5% CEO/HPCD composite displayed effective antimicrobial activity, prolonging the shelf life of sliced bread by at least two days. The reported gels may have potential applications as a promising material for food preservation.","Wang, Yanli; Yuan, Chao; Liu, Yawei; Cui, Bo",Int. j. biol. macromol,107,20

This pandemic, like previous viral outbreaks, has resulted in spikes in anxiety, depression, and stress. Even though millions of individuals face the physical health consequences of infection by COVID-19, even more individuals are confronted with the mental health consequences of this pandemic. This significantly increased demand for mental health services cannot be easily met by existing mental health systems, which often rely on courses of therapy to be delivered over months. Single session interventions (SSIs) may be one important approach to meeting this increased demand, as they are treatments designed to be delivered over the course of a single meeting. SSIs have been found to be effective for a range of mental health challenges, with durable effects lasting months to years later. Here, we describe an SSI designed for the COVID-19 pandemic. This Brief Assessment-informed Skills Intervention for COVID-19 (BASIC) program draws upon therapeutic skills from existing empirically supported treatments to target common presenting complaints due to this pandemic. We discuss the process of developing and implementing this intervention, as well as explore feasibility and initial clinical insights. In short, BASIC is an easy-to-adopt intervention that is designed to be effective in a single session, making it well-suited for handling the increased demand for mental health services due to COVID-19.","Hsu, Kean J; Carl, Emily; DiVita, Annabelle; Feldman, Talya; Alban Foulser, Anna; Freihart, Bridget; Madole, James; McNamara, Mary E; Rubin, Mikael; Stein, Aliza T; Tretyak, Valeria; Smits, Jasper A J",,107,1

The emergence of this new coronavirus increases the importance of understanding SADS-CoV as well as antivirals. Coronaviral proteases, including main proteases and papain-like proteases (PLP), are attractive antiviral targets because of their essential roles in polyprotein processing and thus viral maturation. Here, we describe the biochemical and structural identification of recombinant SADS papain-like protease 2 (PLP2) domain of nsp3. The SADS-CoV PLP2 was shown to cleave nsp1 proteins and also peptides mimicking the nsp2|nsp3 cleavage site and also had deubiquitinating and deISGynating activity by in vitro assays. The crystal structure adopts an architecture resembling that of PLPs from other coronaviruses. We characterize both conserved and unique structural features likely directing the interaction of PLP2 with the substrates, including the tentative mapping of active site and other essential residues. These results provide a foundation for understanding the molecular basis of coronaviral PLPs' catalytic mechanism and for the screening and design of therapeutics to combat infection by SADS coronavirus.","Wang, Lu; Hu, Weihua; Fan, Chengpeng",Protein Sci,107,27

He was suspected to have SPE;however, a CT pulmonary angiogram could not be performed to estimate the clot burden due to an acute kidney injury. He was diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia during the hospitalization and had a delayed EKOS procedure with minimal improvement in oxygenation and clot burden.

DISCUSSION: In severe cases, COVID-19 leads to hypoxemic respiratory failure that may meet criteria for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The mainstay of treatment for ARDS includes a lung protective ventilation strategy with low tidal volumes (4-8 mL/kg predicted body weight), adequate positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), and maintaining a plateau pressure of < 30 cm H2O. While further COVID-19 specific studies are needed, current management should focus on supportive care, preventing further lung injury from mechanical ventilation, and treating the underlying cause.

Simulations provided to younger normal-hearing adults were used to investigate the effect of sensation level, speech presentation level, and spectral shape in comparison to older adults with hearing loss. Method Measures were assessed in quiet, steady-state noise, and speech-modulated noise. Older adults with hearing loss listened to speech that was spectrally shaped according to their hearing thresholds. Younger adults with normal hearing listened to speech that simulated the hearing-impaired group's (a) reduced audibility, (b) increased speech levels, and (c) spectral shaping. Group comparisons were made based on speech recognition performance and masking release. Additionally, younger adults completed measures of listening effort and perceived speech quality to assess if differences across simulations in these outcome measures were similar to those for speech recognition. Results Across the various simulations employed, testing in the presence of a threshold matching noise best matched differences in speech recognition and masking release between younger and older adults. This result remained consistent across the other two outcome measures. Conclusions A combination of audibility, speech level, and spectral shape factors is required to simulate differences between listeners with normal and impaired hearing in recognition, listening effort, and perceived speech quality. The use of spectrally shaped and amplified speech in the presence of threshold matching noise best provided this simulated control.

RESULTS: Of 204 patients, 115 tested RT-PCR-positive and 89 tested negative. The patients who presented with SARI, using CXR-based score of 4 or more, TLC of less than 8,700 cells/µL, and NLR of <7 had a statistically significant area under the curve (p<0.001) for diagnosing COVID-19. The sensitivity and specificity of the CXR score was 80.8% and 73.0%, of TLC was 70.1% and 74.7%, and of NLR was 70.1% and 59.0%, respectively, in diagnosing COVID-19 alone. The specificity further increased to 90.4% when we used the CXR score with NLR and to 92.8% when we used the CXR score with TLC. The post-test odds (""rule in"" disease) of a positive test for having the disease were 3, 2.77, and 1.71 times with the use of either CXR score, TLC, or NLR criteria, respectively; whereas, combined use of CXR score and NLR increased the post-test odds by 5.53 times, and combination of CXR score with TLC increased the post-test odds by 7.5 times. CONCLUSION: CXR score with TLC and NLR can predict COVID-19 infection among those who presented with features of SARI.

This study aims to determine whether SCD is a risk factor for severe COVID-19 infection in regard to the requirement of noninvasive ventilation/high flow nasal cannula (NIV/HFNC), mechanical ventilation (MV), or death in hospitalized patients. Methods: Retrospective cohort study included COVID-19 patients admitted to four COVID-19 treatment facilities in Bahrain between February 24, 2020 and July 31, 2020. All SCD patients with COVID-19 were included and compared to a randomly selected sample of non-SCD patients with COVID-19. Data were collected from the medical records. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to control for confounders and estimate the effect of SCD on the outcomes. Results: 1792 patients with COVID-19 were included; 38 of whom were diagnosed with SCD as well. In the SCD group, one (2.6%) patient required NIV/HFNC, one (2.6%) required MV, and one (2.6%) death occurred. In comparison, 56 (3.2%) of the non-SCD patients required NIV/HFNC, 47 (2.7%) required MV, and death occurred in 58 (3.3%) patients. Upon adjusting for confounders, SCD had an odds ratio of 1.847 (95% CI: 0.39-8.83; p = 0.442). Conclusion: Our results indicate that SCD is not a risk factor for worse COVID-19 outcomes in hospitalized patients.","Abdulrahman, Abdulkarim; Wael, Mohammed; AlAmmadi, Fajer; Almosawi, Zahra; Alsherooqi, Reem; Abduljalil, Manal; Kumar, Nitya; AlQahtani, Manaf",,107,32

In 2020, the devastating influences generated by the COVID-19 global pandemic had established high uncertainty in the manufacturers' capacity, which can hinder the fulfillment of such goals. To address such a problem, in this research, we analyze a two-echelon RSC, including a re-manufacturer who, despite facing the remanufacturing capacity uncertainty, remanufactures eligible obsolete products, then re-enters the marketplace, and a collector who accumulates eligible obsolete products from consumers. We survey centralized and decentralized decisions, and also a condition where the collector, as a Stackelberg game leader, offers a put option contract as a risk-sharing approach and decides on both option and exercise prices; in return, the re-manufacturer determines the order quantity. Contrary to previous studies in which the value of option contracts has been analyzed under demand disruptions, this paper aims to address the performance of a put option contract to mitigate the remanufacturing capacity uncertainty in an RSC. Our results demonstrate that by offering the put option contract and determining the option price as nearly low as the marginal refund cost, not only can the collector motivate the re-manufacturer to augment its order quantity but both parties also attain a win-win profit-sharing outcome. Besides, the customized put option contract can achieve Pareto-improving channel coordination in the condition of remanufacturing capacity uncertainty.","Bakhshi, Alireza; Heydari, Jafar",Ann Oper Res,107,16

In this study, we investigate the clinical and laboratory features and short-term outcomes of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: All patients with COVID-19 admitted to Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital in Wuhan, China, between 3 January and 1 February 2020 were included. All those patients were with laboratory-confirmed infections. Epidemiological, clinical, and radiological characteristics; underlying diseases; laboratory tests; treatments; complications; and outcomes data were collected. Outcomes were followed up at discharge until 15 February 2020. RESULTS: The study cohort included 102 adult patients. The median age was 54 years (interquartile ranger, 37-67 years), and 48.0% were female. A total of 34 patients (33.3%) were exposed to a source of transmission in the hospital setting (as health-care workers, patients, or visitors) and 10 patients (9.8%) had a familial cluster. There were 18 patients (17.6%) who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), and 17 patients died (mortality, 16.7%; 95% confidence interval, 9.4-23.9%). Those patients who survived were younger, were more likely to be health-care workers, and were less likely to suffer from comorbidities. They were also less likely to suffer from complications. There was no difference in drug treatment rates between the survival and nonsurvival groups. Those patients who survived were less likely to require admission to the ICU (14.1% vs 35.3% of those admitted). Chest imaging examinations showed that patients who died were more likely to have ground-glass opacity (41.2% vs 12.9% in survivors). CONCLUSIONS: The mortality rate was high among the COVID-19 patients described in our cohort who met our criteria for inclusion in this analysis. The patient characteristics seen more frequently in those who died were the development of systemic complications following onset of the illness and a severity of disease requiring admission to the ICU. Our data support those described by others indicating that COVID-19 infection results from human-to-human transmission, including familial clustering of cases, and from nosocomial transmission. There were no differences in mortality among those who did or did not receive antimicrobial or glucocorticoid drug treatments.","Cao, Jianlei; Tu, Wen-Jun; Cheng, Wenlin; Yu, Lei; Liu, Ya-Kun; Hu, Xiaorong; Liu, Qiang",Clin Infect Dis,107,20

However, they may encounter difficulties adapting their practices to the pandemic. We provide here an analysis of guidelines for the reorganisation of GP surgeries during the beginning of the pandemic from 15 countries. METHODS: A network of GPs collaborated together in a three-step process: (i) identification of key recommendations of GP surgery reorganisation, according to WHO, CDC and health professional resources from health care facilities; (ii) collection of key recommendations included in the guidelines published in 15 countries; (iii) analysis, comparison and synthesis of the results. RESULTS: Recommendations for the reorganisation of GP surgeries of four types were identified: (i) reorganisation of GP consultations (cancelation of non-urgent consultations, follow-up via e-consultations), (ii) reorganisation of GP surgeries (area partitioning, visual alerts and signs, strict hygiene measures), (iii) reorganisation of medical examinations by GPs (equipment, hygiene, partial clinical examinations, patient education), (iv) reorganisation of GP staff (equipment, management, meetings, collaboration with the local community). CONCLUSIONS: We provide here an analysis of guidelines for the reorganisation of GP surgeries during the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak from 15 countries. These guidelines focus principally on clinical care, with less attention paid to staff management, and the area of epidemiological surveillance and research is largely neglected. The differences of guidelines between countries and the difficulty to apply them in routine care, highlight the need of advanced research in primary care. Thereby, primary care would be able to provide recommendations adapted to the real-world settings and with stronger evidence, which is especially necessary during pandemics.","Tsopra, Rosy; Frappe, Paul; Streit, Sven; Neves, Ana Luisa; Honkoop, Persijn J; Espinosa-Gonzalez, Ana Belen; Geroglu, Berk; Jahr, Tobias; Lingner, Heidrun; Nessler, Katarzyna; Pesolillo, Gabriella; Sivertsen, Øyvind Stople; Thulesius, Hans; Zoitanu, Raluca; Burgun, Anita; Kinouani, Shérazade",BMC Fam Pract,107,1

Their antiviral activity depends on the recognition of glycoprotein receptors on the surface of sensitive host cells-in particular, hemagglutinin for influenza virus or gp120 for HIV-1, which in turn triggers fusion events, allowing the entry of the viral genome into the cells and its subsequent replication. The diversity of glycans present on the S-glycoproteins forming the spikes covering the SARS-CoV-2 envelope, essentially complex type N-glycans and high-mannose type N-glycans, suggests that high-mannose-specific seaweed lectins are particularly well adapted as glycan probes for coronaviruses. This review presents a detailed study of the carbohydrate-binding specificity of high-mannose-specific seaweed lectins, demonstrating their potential to be used as specific glycan probes for coronaviruses, as well as the biomedical interest for both the detection and immobilization of SARS-CoV-2 to avoid shedding of the virus into the environment. The use of these seaweed lectins as replication blockers for SARS-CoV-2 is also discussed.","Barre, Annick; Damme, Els J M Van; Simplicien, Mathias; Benoist, Hervé; Rougé, Pierre",Mar. drugs,107,1

Oncomine database analysis showed that IGSF10 expression was significantly reduced in most cancer types, including lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). In the TCGA-LUAD dataset, IGSF10 expression correlated positively with proportions of tumor-infiltrated B cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, neutrophils, macrophages, and dendritic cells. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that overall survival of patients with low IGSF10 expression was significantly shorter than those with high IGSF10 expression. MiRWalk2.0 database analysis and dual luciferase reporter assays confirmed that miR-106b-5p suppressed IGSF10 expression by binding to its 3'UTR. MiR-106b-5p levels inversely correlated with IGSF10 expression in the TCGA-LUAD dataset. Moreover, inhibition of miR-106b-5p significantly decreased in vitro proliferation, migration, and invasion by LUAD cells, whereas miR-106b-5p overexpression reversed those effects. These results demonstrate that IGSF10 is an independent prognostic factor for LUAD. Furthermore, miR-106b-5p suppressed IGSF10 expression in LUAD tissues by binding to its 3'UTR, which makes IGSF10 and miR-106b-5p potential prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets in LUAD patients.","Ling, Bo; Liao, Xianjiu; Tang, Qiang; Ye, Guangbin; Bin, Xiaoyun; Wang, Jianchu; Pang, Yaqin; Qi, Guangzi",Aging (Albany NY),107,1

Several prophylactic interventions are being performed to discover the effective anti-COVID-19 agent. Thus, the present study aims to identify the cryptogamic secondary metabolites (CSMs) as potent inhibitors of two major targets of SARS-Cov2, namely 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CL&lt;sup&gt;pro&lt;/sup&gt;) and receptor-binding domain (RBD) of spike glycoprotein (SGP), by implementing a computational approach. Molecular docking was carried out on Autodock 4.2 software with the 3CL&lt;sup&gt;pro&lt;/sup&gt; (PDB ID:6LU7) and RBD of SGP (PDB ID:6W41) of the virus. Lopinavir and Arbidol were taken as positive controls to compare the efficacy of randomly selected 53 CSMs. The drug-likeness and pharmacokinetics properties of all metabolites were accessed to discern the anti-COVID 19 activity acting well at the physiological conditions. The docking results predicted that Marchantin E and Zeorin would potentially block the catalytic site of 3CL&lt;sup&gt;pro&lt;/sup&gt; with the interaction energy values of -8.42 kcal/mol and -9.04 kcal/mol, respectively. In addition, Usnic acid revealed its ability to combat the interaction of RBD of SGP to angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 in docking analysis. To certify the potent metabolites for both targets of SARS-CoV-2, MD analysis was performed for 100 ns. The results confirmed that Marchantin E could inhibit SARS-CoV-2 3CL&lt;sup&gt;pro&lt;/sup&gt; and RBD of SGP as well as reveals excellent pharmacokinetic properties. The present study suggests that the identified CSMs could be quickly positioned for further experimental validation to propose promising inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2.","Prateeksha, G.; Rana, T.

The aim of the study was to determine if sufficient literature exists to require clinicians to disclose the specific risk that COVID-19 vaccines could worsen disease upon exposure to challenge or circulating virus. METHODS USED TO CONDUCT THE STUDY: Published literature was reviewed to identify preclinical and clinical evidence that COVID-19 vaccines could worsen disease upon exposure to challenge or circulating virus. Clinical trial protocols for COVID-19 vaccines were reviewed to determine if risks were properly disclosed. RESULTS OF THE STUDY: COVID-19 vaccines designed to elicit neutralising antibodies may sensitise vaccine recipients to more severe disease than if they were not vaccinated. Vaccines for SARS, MERS and RSV have never been approved, and the data generated in the development and testing of these vaccines suggest a serious mechanistic concern: that vaccines designed empirically using the traditional approach (consisting of the unmodified or minimally modified coronavirus viral spike to elicit neutralising antibodies), be they composed of protein, viral vector, DNA or RNA and irrespective of delivery method, may worsen COVID-19 disease via antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). This risk is sufficiently obscured in clinical trial protocols and consent forms for ongoing COVID-19 vaccine trials that adequate patient comprehension of this risk is unlikely to occur, obviating truly informed consent by subjects in these trials. CONCLUSIONS DRAWN FROM THE STUDY AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The specific and significant COVID-19 risk of ADE should have been and should be prominently and independently disclosed to research subjects currently in vaccine trials, as well as those being recruited for the trials and future patients after vaccine approval, in order to meet the medical ethics standard of patient comprehension for informed consent.","Cardozo, Timothy; Veazey, Ronald",Int J Clin Pract,107,20

Further, data from Mexico arehospitable population-based without signs and symptoms information. Thus, this work aims to provide epidemiology information about the burden of COVID-19 in Mexican outpatients and to identify symptomatic COVID-19 profiles that could help in the early diagnosis of the disease. METHODS: From June to September, epidemiological, clinical, and demographic data of 482,413 individuals diagnosed by RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 in Salud Digna clinics were collected. RESULTS: We observed a 41% incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections with a mean age of 36 years and with young adults (20-40 years) being the most affected. Among occupations, delivery persons (OR 1.38) or informal traders (OR 1.33) had a higher risk of COVID-19. Moreover, 13% of SARS-CoV-2 infections were in presymptomatic patients. Finally, we identified three different symptomatic profiles (common, respiratory, and gastrointestinal) associated with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: The incidence of SARS-CoV-2 was high among outpatients with a significant proportion of presymptomatic carriers, and thus it is necessary to increase testing and continue SARS-CoV-2 surveillance with a better description of signs and symptoms; in this regard, we identified three symptomatic profiles that could help in the diagnosis of COVID-19.","Fernández-Rojas, Miguel A; Luna-Ruiz Esparza, Marco A; Campos-Romero, Abraham; Calva-Espinosa, Diana Y; Moreno-Camacho, José L; Langle-Martínez, Ariadna P; García-Gil, Abraham; Solís-González, Claudia J; Canizalez-Román, Adrián; León-Sicairos, Nidia; Alcántar-Fernández, Jonathan",Int J Infect Dis,107,17

Demographic details and clinical information regarding previous history of COVID 19 were collected at the time of SARS-CoV-2 IgG testing. ResultsFrom 979 subjects, the data with respect to 940 health care workers were analysed. SARS-CoV-2 IgG was detected in 19.1% of HCWs. Seroprevalence among high risk group was 20.3% and that in low risk group was 7.4% [p=0.005]. In high-risk group, seropositivity was noted in 30.54 % of nurses, 19% hospital attenders, 18.9% resident doctors and 6.4% consultant doctors. In those with past history of SARS-CoV-2 infection, seropositivity was 75.4%. In those who were COVID positive during July2020, 33.3% were still IgG reactive. Interpretation and conclusionThe study reported 19.1% SARS CoV-2 IgG reactivity among health care workers in our hospital. Seropositivity was significantly higher in high risk group compared to low risk group. Antibody decay kinetics in our study is comparable to that in published literature. Infection control challenges in hybrid hospitals account for higher seropositivity in this study compared to overall seroprevalence among HCWs in Kerala.","JessyS, J; Beegum, Shamha; Gopakumar, Genga; Bindu, G; Chntha, S; Sasidharan, Sukshma; Tonio, Ansu; REGHUKUMAR, ARAVIND",,107,20

Population-based evidence of the association between SDOH and practicing such mitigation strategies in adults with CVD is lacking. We used the National Opinion Research Center's COVID-19 Household Impact Survey conducted between April and June 2020 to evaluate sociodemographic disparities in adherence to COVID-19 risk mitigation measures in a sample of respondents with underlying CVD representing 18 geographic areas of the United States. METHODS: CVD status was ascertained by self-reported history of receiving heart disease, heart attack, or stroke diagnosis. We built de novo, a cumulative index of SDOH burden using education, insurance, economic stability, 30-day food security, urbanicity, neighborhood quality, and integration. We described the practice of measures under the broad strategies of personal protection (mask, hand hygiene, and physical distancing), social distancing (avoiding crowds, restaurants, social activities, and high-risk contact), and work flexibility (work from home, canceling/postponing work). We reported prevalence ratios and 95% CIs for the association between SDOH burden (quartiles of cumulative indices) and practicing these measures adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, comorbidity, and interview wave. RESULTS: Two thousand thirty-six of 25 269 (7.0%) adults, representing 8.69 million in 18 geographic areas of the United States, reported underlying CVD. Compared with the least SDOH burden, fewer individuals with the greatest SDOH burden practiced all personal protection (75.6% versus 89.0%) and social distancing measures (41.9% versus 58.9%) and had any flexible work schedule (26.2% versus 41.4%). These associations remained statistically significant after full adjustment: personal protection (prevalence ratio, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.73-0.96]; P=0.009), social distancing (prevalence ratio, 0.69 [95% CI, 0.51-0.94]; P=0.018), and work flexibility (prevalence ratio, 0.53 [95% CI, 0.36-0.79]; P=0.002).

The article addresses in detail ineffectiveness and potential danger of hydroxychloroquine, which demonstrated neither a decrease in the time of clinical recovery nor any improvement of prognosis for patients with COVID-19. The major objective was substantiating a possible use of bromhexine, a mucolytic and anticough drug, which can inhibit transmembrane serin protease 2 required for entry of the SARS-CoV-2 virus into cells. Spironolactone may have a similar feature. Due to its antiandrogenic effects, spironolactone can inhibit X-chromosome-related synthesis of ACE-2 receptors and activation of transmembrane serin protease 2.

Whether cardiac injury, including myocarditis, also occurs with asymptomatic or mild-severity COVID-19 infection is uncertain. There is an ongoing concern about COVID-19-associated cardiac pathology among athletes because myocarditis is an important cause of sudden cardiac death during exercise. Observations: Prior to relaxation of stay-at-home orders in the US, the American College of Cardiology's Sports and Exercise Cardiology Section endorsed empirical consensus recommendations advising a conservative return-to-play approach, including cardiac risk stratification, for athletes in competitive sports who have recovered from COVID-19. Emerging observational data coupled with widely publicized reports of athletes in competitive sports with reported COVID-19-associated cardiac pathology suggest that myocardial injury may occur in cases of COVID-19 that are asymptomatic and of mild severity. In the absence of definitive data, there is ongoing uncertainty about the optimal approach to cardiovascular risk stratification of athletes in competitive sports following COVID-19 infection. Conclusions and Relevance: This report was designed to address the most common questions regarding COVID-19 and cardiac pathology in athletes in competitive sports, including the extension of return-to-play considerations to discrete populations of athletes not addressed in prior recommendations. Multicenter registry data documenting cardiovascular outcomes among athletes in competitive sports who have recovered from COVID-19 are currently being collected to determine the prevalence, severity, and clinical relevance of COVID-19-associated cardiac pathology and efficacy of targeted cardiovascular risk stratification. While we await these critical data, early experiences in the clinical oversight of athletes following COVID-19 infection provide an opportunity to address key areas of uncertainty relevant to cardiology and sports medicine practitioners.","Kim, Jonathan H; Levine, Benjamin D; Phelan, Dermot; Emery, Michael S; Martinez, Mathew W; Chung, Eugene H; Thompson, Paul D; Baggish, Aaron L",JAMA cardiol.

Data were collected at two different points: November 2019 (Coronavirus disease 19 had not yet spread) and April 2020 (during the lockdown in Italy). Twenty-two study participants were recruited from three residential accredited psychiatric facilities. During lockdown, the patients showed a small increase in symptomatology in terms of emotional isolation. In addition, it was been observed significant differences in certain functional areas of the behavior, measured as lower inclination towards violent behaviors during lockdown, and higher scores in substance abuse and medical impairment. The lockdown condition could represent a form of containment; daily routines, along with adequate social support, are important aspects of the stability and the level of behavioral functioning of psychiatric patients. Social support and continuity of care offered by psychiatric communities can be an effective safeguard against the psychological impact of the COVID-19 epidemic.","Cordellieri, Pierluigi; Barchielli, Benedetta; Masci, Valeria; Viani, Francesca; de Pinto, Ivan; Priori, Andrea; Torriccelli, Felice Damiano; Cosmo, Chiara; Ferracuti, Stefano; Giannini, Anna Maria; Burrai, Jessica",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),107,26

We performed a systematic review to synthesize the currently available evidence over the efficacy and safety of HCQ/CQ therapy alone against SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: We searched Embase, PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane central for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and prospective cohort studies published until October 15, 2020 and assessing the efficacy of HCQ alone against SARS-CoV-2 infection. We included studies evaluating HCQ/CQ alone as intervention and placebo/standard care as a control group. Retrospective studies and studies using other drugs (namely azithromycin, corticosteroids, immunomodulators, etc.) we excluded. Thirteen RCTs and three prospective cohort studies were included in this review. We pooled data using a random-effect model. RESULTS: Pooled data from 12 studies (9917 participants) showed that HCQs increase mortality as compared to placebo/standard of care (RR 1.10; 95% CI:1.00-1.20). Hydroxychloroquine did not reduce the need for hospitalization in out-patients (RR 0.57; 95% CI 0.31-1.02). HCQ group has a significantly higher rate of any adverse event (RR 2.68; 95% CI 1.55-4.64), as compared to the control group. Also, using HCQ for prophylaxis against SARS-CoV-2 infection did not reduce the risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infection (RR 1.04; 95% CI 0.58-1.88). CONCLUSIONS: HCQ therapy for COVID-19 is associated with an increase in mortality and other adverse events. The negative effects are more pronounced in hospitalized patients. Therefore, with the available evidence, HCQ should not be used in prophylaxis or treatment of patients with COVID-19.","Kumar, Jogender; Jain, Siddharth; Meena, Jitendra; Yadav, Arushi",J Infect Chemother,107,20

METHODS: One hundred and sixty one consecutive severe and critical COVID-19 patients admitted in intensive care unit (ICU) were retrospectively reviewed in this multicenter study. Demographic features, medical histories, clinical symptoms, lung computerized tomography (CT) findings, and laboratory indexes on admission were collected. Post-admission complications, treatment regimens, and clinical outcomes were also documented. RESULTS: The mean age was 59.38 ± 16.54 years, with 104 (64.60%) males and 57 (35.40%) females. Hypertension (44 [27.33%]) and diabetes were the most common medical histories. Fever (127 [78.88%]) and dry cough (111 [68.94%]) were the most common symptoms. Blood routine indexes, hepatic and renal function indexes, and inflammation indexes were commonly abnormal. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was the most common post-admission complication (69 [42.86%]), followed by electrolyte disorders (48 [29.81%]), multiple organ dysfunction (MODS) (37 [22.98%]), and hypoproteinemia (36 [22.36%]). The most commonly used antiviral drug was lopinavir/ritonavir tablet. 50 (31.06%) patients died, while 78 (48.45%) patients healed and discharged, and the last 33 (20.50%) patients remained in hospital. Besides, the mean hospital stay of deaths was 21.66 ± 11.18 days, while the mean hospital stay of discharged patients was 18.42 ± 12.77 days. Furthermore, ARDS (P < .001) and MODS (P = .008) correlated with increased mortality rate. CONCLUSION: Severe and critical COVID-19 presents with high mortality rate, and occurrence of ARDS or MODS greatly increases its mortality risk.","Shi, Ming; Chen, Lianhua; Yang, Yadong; Zhang, Jingpeng; Xu, Ji; Xu, Gang; Li, Bin; Yin, Yiping",J Clin Lab Anal,107,20

So far, without vaccines or specific therapy, all efforts to design drugs or clinical trials are worthwhile. Vitamin D and its receptor vitamin D receptor (VDR) exert a critical role in infections due to their remarkable impact on both innate and adaptive immune responses and on the suppression of the inflammatory process. The protective properties of vitamin D supplementation have been supported by numerous observational studies and by meta-analysis of clinical trials for prevention of viral acute respiratory infection.

As an outstanding scientific discovery, the scientist who discovered glucocorticoids was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine in 1950. Cortisone (hydrocortisone) is a natural glucocorticoid, which is secreted with circadian rhythm by the cortical cells of adrenal glands. Physiologically, about 10-20 mg of hydrocortisone are secreted each day for maintaining homeostasis. Since the biological half-life of natural glucocorticoid is short, scientists developed various synthetic glucocorticoids including prednisone, prednisolone, methylprednisolone, triamcinolone, dexamethasone, betamethasone, and so on. These synthetic glucocorticoids are generated by modifying some structures based on the cortisone backbone, leading to extension of their biological half-life with stronger activities. In the face of severe infection, allergy, shock, trauma, pain, and other stresses, the demand for glucocorticoids increases dramatically. It is critical to supplement extra glucocorticoids to protect the biological functions of vital organs. However, the amount and duration of glucocorticoid administration need to be carefully adjusted, because a series of side effects may occur after long-term or high-dose usage of glucocorticoids. This review article will discuss the application of glucocorticoids in the treatment of patients with severe or critical COVID-19 and solid tumors of advanced stage. The controversy of using glucocorticoid in medical community will also be discussed.

Human activities are constantly affecting the quality of the environment and altering the ecosystems, which produce negative consequences also on human wellbeing. Within this context, it has been much discussed how cities and the built environment can counteract this process by supporting more sustainable development. Adaptive reuse is defined as “a process that changes a disused or ineffective item into a new item that can be used for a different purpose”, which strongly triggers the sustainable development of cities. It can be recognized as a promoter of economic growth, social wellbeing, and environmental preservation, given its capability of both preserving past values and creating new ones. The adaptive reuse matches the main points of the circular economy, seen as the sustainable economy, which is aimed at the reduction of natural resource extraction and environmental impact by extending the useful life of materials and promoting recovery, reuse, and regeneration processes. Given these premises, the current contribution aimed to evaluate alternative scenarios for reuse in Castello Visconteo in Cusago, located in the Lombardy region (Italy), and understanding how adaptive reuse could contribute to generating new values within a circular economy perspective. In detail, four alternative scenarios were proposed to face the new needs born during the COVID‐19 pandemic period. Since both intangible and tangible values must be considered, a multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) has been applied by combining economic and qualitative indicators to define the most suitable function for its adaptive reuse. In detail, the Novel Approach to Imprecise Assessment and Decision Environments (NAIADE) was used to identify the best alternative solution based on the opinions of conflicting stakeholders. The innovativeness of the contribution is given by the combination of different methodologies, the preservation of the memory and the generation of new values, and the consideration of adaptive reuse as a strategy for the achievement of sustainable development within a circular economy perspective. © 2021 by the authors.

The role of other antibody isotypes that could also contribute to vaccine efficacy remains unclear. Here we investigated whether RTS,S/AS01E elicits antigen-specific serum IgA antibodies to the vaccine and other malaria antigens, and we explored their association with protection. METHODS: Ninety-five children (age 5-17 months old at first vaccination) from the RTS,S/AS01E phase 3 clinical trial who received 3 doses of RTS,S/AS01E or a comparator vaccine were selected for IgA quantification 1 month post primary immunization. Two sites with different malaria transmission intensities (MTI) and clinical malaria cases and controls, were included. Measurements of IgA against different constructs of the circumsporozoite protein (CSP) vaccine antigen and 16 vaccine-unrelated Plasmodium falciparum antigens were performed using a quantitative suspension array assay. RESULTS: RTS,S vaccination induced a 1.2 to 2-fold increase in levels of serum/plasma IgA antibodies to all CSP constructs, which was not observed upon immunization with a comparator vaccine. The IgA response against 13 out of 16 vaccine-unrelated P. falciparum antigens also increased after vaccination, and levels were higher in recipients of RTS,S than in comparators. IgA levels to malaria antigens before vaccination were more elevated in the high MTI than the low MTI site. No statistically significant association of IgA with protection was found in exploratory analyses. CONCLUSIONS: RTS,S/AS01E induces IgA responses in peripheral blood against CSP vaccine antigens and other P. falciparum vaccine-unrelated antigens, similar to what we previously showed for IgG responses. Collectively, data warrant further investigation of the potential contribution of vaccine-induced IgA responses to efficacy and any possible interplay, either synergistic or antagonistic, with protective IgG, as identifying mediators of protection by RTS,S/AS01E immunization is necessary for the design of improved second-generation vaccines.

However, the COVID-19 pandemic brought historic disruptions including widespread visitation restrictions. Here, we characterize in-depth the visitor policies of NCI-designated comprehensive cancer centers (CCCs) and analyze geographic/temporal patterns across CCCs. METHODS: The public-facing CCC websites, including archived webpages, were reviewed to abstract initial visitation policies and revisions, including end-of-life (EoL) exceptions and timing of visitation restrictions relative to regional lockdowns. Chi-squared and Fisher's exact tests were employed to analyze associations between geographic region, timing, and severity of restrictions. RESULTS: Most CCCs (n=43, 86%) enacted visitation restrictions between March 15 and April 15, 2020. About half barred all visitors for COVID-negative inpatients (n=24, 48%) or outpatients (n=26, 52%). Most (n=36, 72%) prohibited visitors for patients with confirmed/suspected COVID-19. Most (n=40, 80%) published EoL exceptions but the specifics were highly variable. The median time from initial restrictions to government-mandated lockdowns was 1 day, with a wide range (25 days before to 26 days after). There was no association between timing of initial restrictions and geographic location (p=0.14) or severity of inpatient policies (p=1.0), even among centers in the same city. Outpatient policies published reactively (after lockdown) were more restrictive than those published proactively (p=0.04). CONCLUSION: CCCs enacted strict but strikingly variable COVID-19 visitation restrictions, with important implications for patients/families seeking cancer care. A unified, evidence-based approach to visitation policies is needed to balance proven infection control measures with the needs of patients and families.","Yeh, Jonathan C; Subbiah, Ishwaria M; Dhawan, Natasha; Thompson, Benjamin W; Hildner, Zachary; Jawed, Areeba; Prommer, Eric; Sinclair, Christian T",Support. care cancer,107,20

Neurosurgical recommendations are to postpone the endoscopic endonasal pituitary surgeries during the pandemic. We would like to express our experience with urgent pituitary adenomas during the current COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: In our country, COVID-19 has started to become a paramount problem by March 2020. Nine cases of pituitary adenomas have presented with urgent manifestations. The endoscopic endonasal approach was performed in eight patients, while a craniotomy was selected for a recurrent pituitary adenoma. Pre- and postoperative thorough clinical evaluations with chest CT scans were performed. Other strict infection control measures have been applied. Results: In 8 weeks duration starting from the past days of February 2020, we have operated on four females and five males of pituitary adenomas. Visual deterioration was the main presenting symptom. The driving factor for surgery was saving vision in eight patients. Fortunately, the postoperative course was uneventful for all patients. No suspected COVID-19 infection has been reported in any patient or health-care team except one patient. In our city, PCR test was routinely not available. Conclusion: In the era of COVID-19, strict infection control precautions should be employed to limit the possibility of transmission of any possible infection to patient or any of the surgical team. We believe that the risk of getting such infection is not increased by the endonasal approach.

It has posed a significant challenge for the global economies, especially the healthcare sector. Even with a robust healthcare system, countries were not prepared for the ramifications of COVID-19. Several statistical, dynamic, and mathematical models of the COVID-19 outbreak including the SEIR model have been developed to analyze the infection its transmission dynamics. The objective of this research is to use public data to study the properties associated with the COVID-19 pandemic to develop a dynamic hybrid model based on SEIRD and ascertainment rate with automatically selected parameters. The proposed model consists of two parts: the modified SEIRD dynamic model and ARIMA models. We fit SEIRD model parameters against historical values of infected, recovered and deceased population divided by ascertainment rate, which, in its turn, is also a parameter of the model. Residuals of the first model for infected, recovered, and deceased populations are then corrected using ARIMA models. The model can analyze the input data in real-time and provide long- and short-term forecasts with confidence intervals. The model was tested and validated on the USA COVID statistics dataset from the COVID Tracking Project. For validation, we use unseen recent statistical data. We use five common measures to estimate model prediction ability: MAE, MSE, MLSE, Normalized MAE, and Normalized MSE. We proved a great model ability to make accurate predictions of infected, recovered, and deceased patients. The output of the model can be used by the government, private sectors, and policymakers to reduce health and economic risks signiï¬cantly improved consumer credit scoring.","Ala039,; raj, Maher; Majdalawieh, Munir; Nizamuddin, Nishara",,107,16

In the developing brain they can cause neuronal and oligodendroglia apoptosis, impair synaptogenesis, inhibit neurogenesis and trigger long-term neurocognitive sequelae. In humans, the vulnerable period is projected to extend from the third trimester of pregnancy to the third year of life. Infants with seizures and epilepsies may receive barbiturates, benzodiazepines and their combinations for days, months or years. How exposure duration affects neuropathological sequelae is unknown. Here we investigated toxicity of phenobarbital/midazolam (Pb/M) combination in the developing nonhuman primate brain. Neonatal rhesus monkeys received phenobarbital intravenously, followed by infusion of midazolam over 5 (nâ¯=â¯4) or 24â¯h (nâ¯=â¯4). Animals were euthanized at 8 or 36â¯h and brains examined immunohistochemically and stereologically. Treatment was well tolerated, physiological parameters remained at optimal levels. Compared to naïve controls, Pb/M exposed brains displayed widespread apoptosis affecting neurons and oligodendrocytes. Pattern and severity of cell death differed depending on treatment-duration, with more extensive neurodegeneration following longer exposure. At 36â¯h, areas of the brain not affected at 8â¯h displayed neuronal apoptosis, while oligodendroglia death was most prominent at 8â¯h. A notable feature at 36â¯h was degeneration of neuronal tracts and trans-neuronal death of neurons, presumably following their disconnection from degenerated presynaptic partners. These findings demonstrate that brain toxicity of Pb/M in the neonatal primate brain becomes more severe with longer exposures and expands trans-synaptically. Impact of these sequelae on neurocognitive outcomes and the brain connectome will need to be explored.","Noguchi, Kevin K; Fuhler, Nicole A; Wang, Sophie H; Capuano, Saverio; Brunner, Kevin R; Larson, Shreya; Crosno, Kristin; Simmons, Heather A; Mejia, Andres F; Martin, Lauren D; Dissen, Gregory A; Brambrink, Ansgar; Ikonomidou, Chrysanthy",Neurobiol Dis,107,20

Outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted our original plans for the Internship Program in summer 2020;thus, we redesigned the Program as a remote internship focusing on science reading, writing, and interpretation skills in order to continue providing an authentic research experience for our high school interns. During the first three years of the Program, we focused on hands-on participation in physiology research to expose students to an academic research environment and to explore mechanisms for mentoring students in early phases of the STEM pipeline. As we planned for our fourth summer, we originally aimed to expand the Program by increasing the number of high school students placed in research labs at Sac State. With on-campus research severely limited due to COVID-19, we instead worked with the mentoring professors at Sac State to pivot the Program's emphases and create a remote internship experience. Feedback gathered from previous student interns indicated their desire to be more involved in the entire scientific process and learn how to read, write, analyze, and communicate data for a scientific audience. We embraced the unexpected turn of events due to the COVID-19 pandemic as an opportunity to focus on these skills and continue providing authentic research experiences, even if we were not able to conduct traditional, hands-on laboratory research with the student interns. Three Sac State mentors and five student interns participated in the remote version of the Internship Program in summer of 2020. Student interns participated in a wide range of training activities, including the following: quantitative data analysis, statistics and computer coding tutorials, strategies for reading scientific manuscripts, journal club presentations, protocol development, writing funding proposals, literature search techniques to develop new lines of inquiry, and oral communication of science. At the conclusion of the Program, informal feedback from the student interns indicated general satisfaction with the remote internship model;they valued the opportunity to learn and practice science reading, writing, and interpretation skills and felt they were truly members of their research teams. However, they also commented their research experiences were not as impactful as they could have been, since they could not conduct hands-on experiments in the laboratory. For future iterations of our Internship Program, either in-person or remote, including a component that emphasizes science reading, writing, and interpretation skills merits consideration based on positive feedback from the initial pilot of this component during our pivot to a remote internship model due to COVID-19.","Altman, Robin Vivaik Pragathi Kaschner Meghan Whited Kellie",The FASEB Journal,107,24

Here, we aim to overcome these limitations by searching the parameter space of different fixation, resin, embedding, etching, retrieval, and elution conditions. Our optimizations reveal that etching epoxy-resin-embedded ultrathin sections with Na-ethanolate and treating them with SDS dramatically increase the labeling efficiency of synaptic proteins. We also demonstrate that this method is ideal for the molecular characterization of individual synapses following paired recordings, two-photon [Ca2+] or glutamate-sensor (iGluSnFR) imaging.

It is a safe therapy, with few potential risks even if administered at high concentration. Inhaled NO gas is routinely used to increase systemic oxygenation in different disease conditions. The administration of high concentrations of NO also exerts a virucidal effect in vitro. Owing to its favorable pharmacodynamic and safety profiles, the familiarity in its use by critical care providers, and the potential for a direct virucidal effect, NO is clinically used in patients with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). Nevertheless, no device is currently available to easily administer inhaled NO at concentrations higher than 80 parts per million (ppm) at various inspired oxygen fractions, without the need for dedicated, heavy, and costly equipment. The development of a reliable, safe, inexpensive, lightweight, and ventilator-free solution is crucial, particularly for the early treatment of non-intubated patients outside of the intensive care unit (ICU) and in a limited-resource scenario. To overcome such a barrier, a simple system for the non-invasive NO gas administration up to 250 ppm was developed using standard consumables and a scavenging chamber. The method has been proven safe and reliable in delivering a specified NO concentration while limiting nitrogen dioxide levels. This paper aims to provide clinicians and researchers with the necessary information on how to assemble or adapt such a system for research purposes or clinical use in COVID-19 or other diseases in which NO administration might be beneficial.","Pinciroli, Riccardo; Traeger, Lisa; Fischbach, Anna; Gianni, Stefano; Morais, Caio Cesar Araujo; Fakhr, Bijan Safaee; Di Fenza, Raffaele; Robinson, Dianna; Carroll, Ryan; Zapol, Warren M; Berra, Lorenzo",J. vis. exp,107,24

Healthcare workers have previously been shown to have experienced higher rates of infection than the general population. We aimed to assess the extent of infection in staff working in our healthcare setting. DESIGN: A retrospective analysis of antibody results, compared with staff demographic data, and exposure to patients with COVID-19 infection. SETTING: A large teaching hospital in the North West of England. PARTICIPANTS: 4474 staff in diverse clinical and non-patient facing roles who volunteered for SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing by the Roche Elecsys assay between 29 May and 4 July 2020. RESULTS: Seroprevalence was 17.4%. Higher rates were seen in Asian/Asian British (OR 1.61, 95% CI 1.27 to 2.04) and Black/Black British (OR 2.08, 95% CI 1.25 to 3.45) staff. Staff working in any clinical location were more likely to be seropositive (OR 2.68, 95% 2.27 to 3.15). Staff were at an increased risk of seropositivity as the 'per 100 COVID-19 bed-days change' increased in the clinical area in which they worked (OR 1.12, 95% 1.10 to 1.14). Staff working in critical care were no more likely to have detectable antibodies than staff working in non-clinical areas. Symptoms compatible with COVID-19 were reported in 41.8% and antibodies were detected in 30.7% of these individuals. In staff who reported no symptoms, antibodies were detected in 7.7%. In all staff who had detectable antibodies, 25.2% reported no symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Staff working in clinical areas where patients with COVID-19 were nursed were more likely to have detectable antibodies. The relationship between seropositivity in healthcare workers and the increase in 'per 100 COVID-19 bed-days' of the area in which they worked, although statistically significant, was weak, suggesting other contributing factors to the risk profile. Of staff with detectable antibodies and therefore evidence of prior infection, a quarter self-reported that they had experienced no compatible symptoms. This has implications for potential unrecorded transmission in both staff and patients.","Shorten, Robert John; Haslam, Shonagh; Hurley, Margaret A; Rowbottom, Anthony; Myers, M; Wilkinson, Paul; Orr, David",BMJ Open,107,29

Lockdown measures have caused the reductions of various urban pollutants, such as nitrogen dioxide (NO2), particulate matters (PMs), and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). COVID-19 pandemic has also established remote-working as an antidote to declining economic activity due to lockdown measures. The environmental health implications of the new hybrid-working model, which drastically reduces the number of circulating vehicles, appear to be positive enough to reveal an emerging opportunity. Since this hybrid model may have started becoming a widely accepted working model, the current situation has revealed the opportunity of remote-working arrangements to serve as a supplementary mitigative and adaptive measure against urban environmental deterioration. Also, a remote-working carbon-saving footprint may be introduced in order to evaluate a firm's carbon footprint reduction due to remote-working arrangements. These workings arrangements may be accompanied by improvements and expansions of urban green spaces and with broader use of electric vehicles, transforming our cities into more sustainable, safe, healthy, and worth-living environments.","Maipas, S.; Panayiotides, L.

Its use can be difficult, posing a high risk of contamination, mainly during doffing, then with the risk of becoming infected. METHODS: We conducted a prospective before-and-after design that used clinical simulation as a research methodology in a clinical simulation center of Colombia. A simulation-based educational intervention with two cases related to COVID-19 was proposed in the emergency room and the intensive care unit. We conducted A workshop for donning and doffing of personal protective equipment (PPE) and a debriefing after the first case. RESULTS: In the pre-test, 100% of participants failed donning and doffing PPE, 98.4% were contaminated, only one-person did not contaminate out of. The mean cognitive load was high (7.43±0.9 points). In the post-test, 100% were successful in donning the PPE and 94.8% in doffing; only 9.8% were contaminated. The mean of the cognitive load was low (4.1±1.4 points), and the performance was high (7.9±1.1). Of the total, 73.8% of participants reported overload in the doffing. The most difficulties were in gown/overall, and N95 mask removal. DISCUSSION: The PPE donning and doffing is critical and may be changed significantly by active training. In responding to the current COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, activities of training in donning and doffing PPE would provide a means of training personnel, reducing the cognitive load and maybe the risk of contamination and infection of health care workers.","Díaz-Guio, Diego Andrés; Ricardo-Zapata, Alejandra; Ospina-Velez, Jeniffer; Gómez-Candamil, Gabriel; Mora-Martinez, Santiago; Rodriguez-Morales, Alfonso J",Infez Med,107,1

This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the impact of prone positioning on oxygenation and clinical outcomes. DESIGN AND SETTING: We searched PubMed, Embase, and the coronavirus diseases 2019 living systematic review from December 1, 2019, to November 9, 2020. SUBJECTS AND INTERVENTION: Studies reporting prone positioning in hypoxemic, nonintubated adult patients with coronavirus diseases 2019 were included. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Data on prone positioning location (ICU vs non-ICU), prone positioning dose (total minutes/d), frequency (sessions/d), respiratory supports during prone positioning, relative changes in oxygenation variables (peripheral oxygen saturation, Pao2, and ratio of Pao2 to the Fio2), respiratory rate pre and post prone positioning, intubation rate, and mortality were extracted. Twenty-five observational studies reporting prone positioning in 758 patients were included. There was substantial heterogeneity in prone positioning location, dose and frequency, and respiratory supports provided. Significant improvements were seen in ratio of Pao2 to the Fio2 (mean difference, 39;95% CI, 25-54), Pao2 (mean difference, 20 mm Hg;95% CI, 14-25), and peripheral oxygen saturation (mean difference, 4.74%;95% CI, 3-6%). Respiratory rate decreased post prone positioning (mean difference, -3.2 breaths/min;95% CI, -4.6 to -1.9). Intubation and mortality rates were 24% (95% CI, 17-32%) and 13% (95% CI, 6-19%), respectively. There was no difference in intubation rate in those receiving prone positioning within and outside ICU (32% [69/214] vs 33% [107/320];p = 0.84). No major adverse events were recorded in small subset of studies that reported them. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the significant variability in frequency and duration of prone positioning and respiratory supports applied, prone positioning was associated with improvement in oxygenation variables without any reported serious adverse events. The results are limited by a lack of controls and adjustments for confounders.

This study aimed to disclose the association between statins and 60-day COVID-19 mortality. Approach and Results: All patients hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled in this study from January 19 to April 16, 2020, in Korea. We evaluated the association between the use of statins and COVID-19-related mortality in the overall and the nested 1:2 propensity score-matched study. Furthermore, a comparison of the hazard ratio for death was performed between COVID-19 patients and a retrospective cohort of patients hospitalized with pneumonia between January and June 2019 in Korea. The median age of the 10 448 COVID-19 patients was 45 years. Statins were prescribed in 533 (5.1%) patients. After adjusting for age, sex, and comorbidities, Cox regression showed a significant decrease in hazard ratio associated with the use of statins (hazard ratio, 0.637 [95% CI, 0.425-0.953]; P=0.0283). Moreover, on comparing the hazard ratio between COVID-19 patients and the retrospective cohort of hospitalized pneumonia patients, the use of statins showed similar benefits.

The aim of this study is to describe a novel hospital capacity versus clinical justification triage score (CCTS) to prioritize patients who require surgery during the ""new normal state"" of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODOLOGY: A consensus study using the Delphi technique was carried out among clinicians from the Orthopaedic Surgery, Neurosurgery, and Anaesthesia departments. Three rounds of consensus were carried out via survey and Webinar discussions. RESULTS: A 50-points score system consisting of 4 domains with 4 subdomains was formed. The CCTS were categorized into the hospital capacity, patient factors, disease severity, and surgery complexity domains. A score between 30 and 50 points indicated that the proposed operation should proceed without delay. A score of less than 20 indicates that the proposed operation should be postponed. A score between 20 and 29 indicates that the surgery falls within a grey area where further discussion should be undertaken to make a joint justification for approval of surgery. CONCLUSION: This study is a proof of concept for the novel CCTS scoring system to prioritize surgeries to meet the rapidly changing demands of the COVID-19 pandemic. It offers a simple and objective method to stratify patients who require surgery and allows these complex and difficult decisions to be unbiased and made transparently among surgeons and hospital administrators.","Liu, Gabriel; Tan, Jun-Hao; Hey, Hwee Weng Dennis; Lau, Leok Lim; Thambiah, Joseph; Kumar, Naresh; Tan, Jonathan; Ruiz, John; Nga, Vincent; Lwin, Sein; Teo, Kejia; Ning, Chou; Agrawal, Rohit Vijay; Ng, Bryan; Wong, Weng Hoa; Yeo, Tseng Tsai; Wong, Hee-Kit",Eur. spine j,107,25

Convalescents had higher frequency of spike protein specific memory B cells and by cell sorting delivered 3,532 B cells, compared with 2,352 from naive people. Of these, 944 from naive and 2,299 from convalescents produced monoclonal antibodies against the spike protein and 411 of them neutralized the original Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 virus. More than 75% of the monoclonal antibodies from naive people lost their neutralization activity against the B.1.351 (beta) and B.1.1.248 (gamma) variants while this happened only for 61% of those from convalescents. The overall loss of neutralization was lower for the B.1.1.7 (alpha) and B.1.617.2 (delta) variants, however it was always significantly higher in those of naive people. In part this was due to the IGHV2-5;IGHJ4-1 germline, which was found only in convalescents and generated potent and broadly neutralizing antibodies. Overall, vaccination of seropositive people increases the frequency of B cells encoding antibodies with high potency and that are not susceptible to escape by any of the four variants of concern. Our data suggest that people that are seropositive following infection or primary vaccination will produce antibodies with increased potency and breadth and will be able to better control SARS-CoV-2 emerging variants.","Andreano, Emanuele; Paciello, Ida; Piccini, Giulia; Manganaro, Noemi; Pileri, Piero; Hyseni, Inesa; Leonardi, Margherita; Pantano, Elisa; Abbiento, Valentina; Benincasa, Linda; Giglioli, Ginevra; Santi, Concetta De; Fabbiani, Massimiliano; Rancan, Ilaria; Tumbarello, Mario; Montagnani, Francesca; Sala, Claudia; Montomoli, Emanuele; Rappuoli, Rino",,107,10

Here we utilize a mathematical model to assess the impact of masking on transmission within individual transmission pairs and at the population level. Our model quantitatively links mask efficacy to reductions in viral load and subsequent transmission risk. Our results reinforce that the use of masks by both a potential transmitter and exposed person substantially reduces the probability of successful transmission, even if masks only lower exposure viral load by ~ 50%. Slight increases in mask adherence and/or efficacy above current levels would reduce the effective reproductive number (Re) substantially below 1, particularly if implemented comprehensively in potential super-spreader environments. Our model predicts that moderately efficacious masks will also lower exposure viral load tenfold among people who get infected despite masking, potentially limiting infection severity. Because peak viral load tends to occur pre-symptomatically, we also identify that antiviral therapy targeting symptomatic individuals is unlikely to impact transmission risk. Instead, antiviral therapy would only lower Re if dosed as post-exposure prophylaxis and if given to ~ 50% of newly infected people within 3 days of an exposure. These results highlight the primacy of masking relative to other biomedical interventions under consideration for limiting the extent of the COVID-19 pandemic prior to widespread implementation of a vaccine. To confirm this prediction, we used a regression model of King County, Washington data and simulated the counterfactual scenario without mask wearing to estimate that in the absence of additional interventions, mask wearing decreased Re from 1.3-1.5 to ~ 1.0 between June and September 2020.","Goyal, Ashish; Reeves, Daniel B; Thakkar, Niket; Famulare, Mike; Cardozo-Ojeda, E Fabián; Mayer, Bryan T; Schiffer, Joshua T",Sci Rep,107,21

Plasmin is a central enzyme in this process via its capacity to cleave fibrin. The kinetics of plasmin generation (PG) and inhibition during fibrinolysis have been poorly understood until the recent development of assays to quantify these metrics. The assessment of plasmin kinetics allows for the identification of fibrinolytic dysfunction and better understanding of the relationships between abnormal fibrin dissolution and disease pathogenesis. Additionally, direct measurement of the inhibition of PG by antifibrinolytic medications, such as tranexamic acid, can be a useful tool to assess the risks and effectiveness of antifibrinolytic therapy in hemorrhagic diseases. This review provides an overview of available PG assays to directly measure the kinetics of plasmin formation and inhibition in human and mouse plasmas and focuses on their applications in defining the role of plasmin in diseases, including angioedema, hemophilia, rare bleeding disorders, COVID-19, or diet-induced obesity. Moreover, this review introduces the PG assay as a promising clinical and research method to monitor antifibrinolytic medications and screen for genetic or acquired fibrinolytic disorders.","Miszta, Adam; Huskens, Dana; Donkervoort, Demy; Roberts, Molly J M; Wolberg, Alisa S; de Laat, Bas",Int. j. mol. sci.

Importance:The purpose of this clinical case is to highlight the importance of considering less prevalent causes of ARDS amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Case report:We present a 56-year-old Belgian female of African descent without past medical history who demonstrated typical signs of COVID-19 at the start of the pandemic. Based on the disease course as well as CT-scan findings, a diagnosis of COVID-19 was made. She progressed to ARDS for which she got intubated and was started on venovenous membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO). Despite initial negative screening for antinuclear antibodies, further analysis revealed anti-Jo-antibodies. Diagnosis of ASSD was eventually retained and immunosuppressive therapy was started. However, pulmonary fibrosis had evolved too far and therapy was halted shortly after.","Van Cauwelaert, Stefan; Stylemans, Dimitri; D039,; Haenens, Alexander; Slabbynck, Hans; Nieuwendijk, Rogier",Acta Clin Belg,107,22

Purpose To develop an artificial intelligence algorithm to differentiate COVID-19 pneumonia from other causes of CXR abnormalities. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, a deep neural network, CV19-Net, was trained, validated, and tested on CXRs from patients with and without COVID-19 pneumonia. For the COVID-19 positive CXRs, patients with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction positive results for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 with positive pneumonia findings between February 1, 2020 and May 30, 2020 were included. For the non-COVID-19 CXRs, patients with pneumonia who underwent CXR between October 1, 2019 and December 31, 2019 were included. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity were calculated to characterize diagnostic performance. To benchmark the performance of CV19-Net, a randomly sampled test dataset containing 500 CXRs from 500 patients was evaluated by both the CV19-Net and three experienced thoracic radiologists. Results A total of 2060 patients (5806 CXRs; mean age 62 ± 16, 1059 men) with COVID-19 pneumonia and 3148 patients (5300 CXRs; mean age 64 ± 18, 1578 men) with non-COVID-19 pneumonia were included and split into training + validation and test datasets. For the test set, CV19-Net achieved an AUC of 0.92 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.91, 0.93) corresponding to a sensitivity of 88% (95% CI: 87%, 89%) and a specificity of 79% (95% CI: 77%, 80%) using a high sensitivity operating threshold, or a sensitivity of 78% (95% CI: 77%, 79%) and a specificity of 89% (95% CI: 88%, 90%) using a high specificity operating threshold. For the 500 sampled CXRs, CV19-Net achieved an AUC of 0.94 (95% CI: 0.93, 0.96) compared to a 0.85 AUC (95% CI: 0.81, 0.88) of radiologists. Conclusion CV19-Net was able to differentiate COVID-19 related pneumonia from other types of pneumonia with performance exceeding that of experienced thoracic radiologists.","Zhang, Ran; Tie, Xin; Qi, Zhihua; Bevins, Nicholas B; Zhang, Chengzhu; Griner, Dalton; Song, Thomas K; Nadig, Jeffrey D; Schiebler, Mark L; Garrett, John W; Li, Ke; Reeder, Scott B; Chen, Guang-Hong",Radiology,107,15

SARS-CoV-2 seems to have originated from bats as their reservoir hosts over time. Similar to SARS-CoV, this new virus also exerts its action on the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. This action causes infections in cells and establishes an infectious disease, COVID-19. Against this viral invasion, the human body starts to activate the innate immune system in producing and releasing proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-1ß, IL-8, TNF-&#945;, and other chemokines, such as G-CSF, IP10 and MCPl, which all develop and increase the inflammatory response. In cases of COVID-19, excessive inflammatory responses occur, and exaggerated proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines are detected in the serum, resulting in cytokine release syndrome or cytokine storm. This causes coagulation abnormalities, excessive oxidation developments, mitochondrial permeability transition, vital organ damage, immune system failure and eventually progresses to disseminated intravascular coagulation and multiple organ failure. Additionally, the excessive inflammatory responses also cause mitochondrial dysfunction due to progressive and persistent stress. This damages cells and mitochondria, leaving products containing mitochondrial DNA and cell debris involved in the excessive chronic inflammation as damage-associated molecular patterns. Thus, the respiratory infection progressively leads to disseminated intravascular coagulation from acute respiratory distress syndrome, including vascular endothelial cell damage and coagulation-fibrinolysis system disorders. This condition causes central nervous system disorders, renal failure, liver failure and, finally, multiple organ failure. Regarding treatment for COVID-19, the following are progressive and multiple steps for mitigating the excessive inflammatory response and subsequent cytokine storm in patients. First, administering of favipiravir to suppress SARS-CoV-2 and nafamostat to inhibit ACE2 function should be considered. Second, anti-rheumatic drugs (monoclonal antibodies), which act on the leading cytokines (IL-1ß, IL-6) and/or cytokine receptors such as tocilizumab, should be administered as well. Finally, melatonin may also have supportive effects for cytokine release syndrome, resulting in mitochondrial function improvement. This paper will further explore these subjects with reports mostly from China and Europe.","Yokota, Shumpei; Miyamae, Takako; Kuroiwa, Yoshiyuki; Nishioka, Kusuki",,107,16

DESIGN: A retrospective observational cohort study. SETTING: Tertiary-care facility. PATIENTS: All patients 2 years of age and older tested for SARS-CoV-2 between March 14, 2020, and April 30, 2020, who had at least 2 SARS-CoV-2 reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction tests within 7 days. METHODS: The primary outcome measure was a false-negative testing episode, which we defined as an initial negative test followed by a positive test within the subsequent 7 days. Data collected included symptoms, demographics, comorbidities, vital signs, labs, and imaging studies. Logistic regression was used to model associations between clinical variables and false-negative SARS-CoV-2 test results. RESULTS: Of the 1,009 SARS-CoV-2 test results included in the analysis, 4.0% were false-negative results. In multivariable regression analysis, compared with true-negative test results, false-negative test results were associated with anosmia or ageusia (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 8.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4-50.5; P = .02), having had a COVID-19-positive contact (aOR, 10.5; 95% CI, 4.3-25.4; P < .0001), and having an elevated lactate dehydrogenase level (aOR, 3.3; 95% CI, 1.2-9.3; P = .03). Demographics, symptom duration, other laboratory values, and abnormal chest imaging were not significantly associated with false-negative test results in our multivariable analysis.

It can be subdivided into three major classifications based on the component of the neuromuscular system (i.e. peripheral nerves or skeletal muscle or both) that are affected. This includes critical illness polyneuropathy (CIP), critical illness myopathy (CIM), and an overlap syndrome, critical illness polyneuromyopathy (CIPNM). It is a common complication observed in people with critical illness requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Given CIAW is found in individuals experiencing grave illness, it can be challenging to study from a practical standpoint. However, over the past 2 decades, many insights into the pathophysiology of this condition have been made. Results from studies in both humans and animal models have found that a profound systemic inflammatory response and factors related to bioenergetic failure as well as microvascular, metabolic, and electrophysiological alterations underlie the development of CIAW. Current management strategies focus on early mobilization, achieving euglycemia, and nutritional optimization. Other interventions lack sufficient evidence, mainly due to a dearth of large trials. The goal of this Physiology in Medicine article is to highlight important aspects of the pathophysiology of these enigmatic conditions. It is hoped that improved understanding of the mechanisms underlying these disorders will lead to further study and new investigations for novel pharmacologic, nutritional, and exercise-based interventions to optimize patient outcomes.","Cheung, Kevin; Rathbone, Alasdair; Melanson, Michel; Trier, Jessica; Ritsma, Benjamin R; Allen, Matti D",J Appl Physiol (1985),107,24

If leveraged properly, that data could assist end-users, energy producers and utility companies in detecting anomalous power consumption and understanding the causes of each anomaly. Therefore, anomaly detection could stop a minor problem to become widespread, costly and time-consuming issue. Moreover, this will help in better decision-making to reduce wasted energy and promote sustainable and energy efficiency behavior. In this regard, this paper is proposed to indepthly review existing frameworks of anomaly detection in power consumption and provide a critical analysis of existing solutions. Specifically, a comprehensive survey is introduced, in which a novel taxonomy is introduced to classify existing algorithms based on different factors adopted in their implementation, such as the machine learning algorithm, feature extraction approach, detection level, computing platform, application scenario and privacy preservation. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first review article that discusses the anomaly detection in building energy consumption. Moving forward, important findings along with domain-specific problems, difficulties and challenges that remain unresolved are thoroughly discussed, including the absence of: (i) precise definitions of anomalous power consumptions, (ii) annotated datasets, (iii) unified metrics to assess the performance of existing solutions, and (iv) platforms for reproducibility. Following, insights about current research trends that anomaly detection technology needs to target for widespreading its application and facilitate its implementation are described before deriving a set of challenging future directions attracting significant research and development attention.","Himeur, Yassine; Ghanem, Khalida; Alsalemi, Abdullah; Bensaali, Faycal; Amira, Abbes",,107,16

This study focuses on their psychological status, and analyzes the main factors affecting their emotions of pregnant women so as to provide guidance for psychological counseling and social intervention during epidemics. METHODS: Multiple researchers distributed a questionnaire online via the Internet. Pregnant women volunteered, and the questionnaire was automatically collected in the background. RESULTS: The 298 valid questionnaires recovered showed that 82 cases of pregnant women were in states of anxiety, accounting for 27.51%, of which 78.05% were mild (82 cases), 19.51% were moderate (16 cases), and 2.44% were severe (2 cases). Moreover, 31.21% of pregnant women were in states of depression (93 cases), of which 52.69% were mild (49 cases), 40.86% were moderate (38 cases), and 6.45% were severe (6 cases). The risk factors for states of anxiety or depression were fear of fetal malformation or genetic disease, history of adverse pregnancy, can't do routine prenatal examination, and insufficient support and care from husbands and families. Besides, 16 cases had sought psychological help during the epidemic, among whom 62.50% (10 cases) experienced anxiety, 68.75% (11 cases) had depression. CONCLUSIONS: During the outbreak of COVID-19, obstetricians may take use of the Internet, based on the advantages in epidemic prevention, controlling health education, and popularizing science.

Despite a potentially higher risk of pregnant women acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with the non-pregnant population (particularly in some ethnic minorities), no additional specific recommendations to avoid exposure are needed in pregnancy. The most common clinical symptoms and laboratory signs of SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy are fever, cough, lymphopenia and elevated C-reactive protein levels. Pregnancy is associated with a higher risk of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with the non-pregnant population, including pneumonia, admission to the intensive care unit and death, even after adjusting for potential risk factors for severe outcomes. The risk of miscarriage does not appear to be increased in women with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Evidence with regards to preterm birth and perinatal mortality is conflicting, but these risks are generally higher only in symptomatic, hospitalized women. The risk of vertical transmission, defined as the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from the mother to the fetus or the newborn, is generally low. Fetal invasive procedures are considered to be generally safe in pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection, although the evidence is still limited. In pregnant women with COVID-19, use of steroids should not be avoided if clinically indicated; the preferred regimen is a 2-day course of dexamethasone followed by an 8-day course of methylprednisolone. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may be used if there are no contraindications. Hospitalized pregnant women with severe COVID-19 should undergo thromboprophylaxis throughout the duration of hospitalization and at least until discharge, preferably with low molecular weight heparin. Hospitalized women who have recovered from a period of serious or critical illness with COVID-19 should be offered a fetal growth scan about 14 days after recovery from their illness. In asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic women who have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection at full term (i.e. &#8805; 39 weeks of gestation), induction of labor might be reasonable. To date, there is no clear consensus on the optimal timing of delivery for critically ill women. In women with no or few symptoms, management of labor should follow routine evidence-based guidelines. Regardless of COVID-19 status, mothers and their infants should remain together and breastfeeding, skin-to-skin contact, kangaroo mother care and rooming-in throughout the day and night should be practiced, while applying necessary infection prevention and control measures. Many pregnant women have already undergone vaccination, mostly in the USA where the first reports show no significant difference in pregnancy outcomes in pregnant women receiving SARS-CoV-2 vaccination during pregnancy compared with the background risk. Vaccine-generated antibodies were present in the umbilical cord blood and breast milk samples of pregnant and lactating women who received the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. Based on the available limited data on the safety of the COVID-19 vaccine in pregnancy, it seems reasonable to offer the option of vaccination to pregnant women after accurate counseling on the potential risk of a severe course of the disease and the unknown risk of fetal exposure to the vaccine. © 2021 International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology.","Di Mascio, D; Buca, D; Berghella, V; Khalil, A; Rizzo, G; Odibo, A; Saccone, G; Galindo, A; Liberati, M; D039,; Antonio, F",Ultrasound Obstet Gynecol,107,22

BACKGROUND: The stress level of clinical nurses directly affects their physical and mental health and work efficiency. DESIGN: This study was a cross-sectional investigation, which was performed following the STROBE checklist. The current study was conducted in February 2020 by selecting clinical nurses from the Zigong First People's Hospital for investigation. METHODS: At the peak of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, we assessed clinical nurses with the Stanford Acute Stress Reaction Questionnaire, the General Self-Efficacy Scale and the Perceived Social Support Scale. Specifically, the nurses were divided into three groups: (a) nurses supporting Wuhan; (b) nurses in the department of treating the COVID-19 patients in our hospital (epidemic department); and (c) nurses in the general department without the COVID-19 patients in our hospital (non-epidemic department). RESULTS: A total of 1092 clinical nurses were surveyed with 94 nurses in Wuhan, 130 nurses treating COVID-19 patients in our hospital and 868 nurses working without direct contact with diagnosed COVID-19 patients. The mean stress score of all surveyed nurses was 33.15 (SD: 25.551). There was a statistically significant difference in stress response scores between different departments. Noticeably, the nurses who went to support in Wuhan showed a weaker stress response than the nurses who stayed in our hospital (mean: 19.98 (Wuhan) vs. 32.70 (epidemic department in our hospital) vs. 34.64 (non-epidemic department in our hospital)). In addition, stress was negatively correlated with general self-efficacy and perceived social support. CONCLUSION: The present study suggested that the stress status of second-line nurse without direct contact with diagnosed COVID-19 patients was more severe than that of first-line nurses who had direct contact with COVID-19 patients. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Our study indicated the importance of psychological status of second-line medical staff during the global pandemic.","Liao, Changju; Guo, Linghong; Zhang, Cuicui; Zhang, Meiqi; Jiang, Wenjing; Zhong, Ying; Lin, Qingfang; Liu, Yin",J. clin. nurs,107,4

We show that the large-population dynamics are deterministic and relate to the Kermack-McKendrick PDE. Our assumptions are minimalistic in the sense that the only important requirement is that the basic reproduction number of the epidemic $R_0$ be finite, and allow us to tackle both Markovian and non-Markovian dynamics. The novelty of our approach is to study the""infection graph""of the population. We show local convergence of this random graph to a Poisson (Galton-Watson) marked tree, recovering Markovian backward-in-time dynamics in the limit as we trace back the transmission chain leading to a focal infection. This effectively models the process of contact tracing in a large population. It is expressed in terms of the Doob $h$-transform of a certain renewal process encoding the time of infection along the chain.

It is not known whether older adults are accessing emergency care differently from their younger counterparts. Our objective was to determine patterns of ED visit counts for emergent conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic for older adults. DESIGN: Retrospective, observational study. SETTING: Observational analysis of ED sites enrolled in a national clinical quality registry. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred and sixty-four ED sites in 33 states from January 1, 2019 to November 15, 2020. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: We measured daily ED visit counts for acute myocardial infarction (AMI), stroke, sepsis, fall, and hip fracture, as well as deaths in the ED, by age categories. We estimated Poisson regression models comparing early and post-early pandemic periods (defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) to the pre-pandemic period. We report incident rate ratios to summarize changes in visit incidence. RESULTS: For AMI, stroke, and sepsis, the older (75-84) and oldest old (85+ years) had the greatest decline in visit counts initially and the smallest recovery in the post-early pandemic periods. For falls, visits declined early and partially recovered uniformly across age categories. In contrast, hip fractures exhibited less change in visit rates across time periods. Deaths in the ED increased during the early pandemic period, but then fell and were persistently lower than baseline, especially for the older (75-84) and oldest old (85+ years). CONCLUSIONS: The decline in ED visits for emergent conditions among older adults has been more pronounced and persistent than for younger patients, with fewer deaths in the ED. This is concerning given the greater prevalence and risk of poor outcomes for emergent conditions in this age group that are amenable to time-sensitive ED diagnosis and treatment, and may in part explain excess mortality during the COVID-19 era among older adults.","Janke, Alexander T; Jain, Snigdha; Hwang, Ula; Rosenberg, Mark; Biese, Kevin; Schneider, Sandra; Goyal, Pawan; Venkatesh, Arjun K",J. am. geriatr. soc,107,1

This exposes them to a higher risk of developing chronic stress, psychological distress, and any other mental health symptoms. OBJECTIVE: to evaluate stress and burnout in a health workers population and, in addition, to measure hair cortisol concentration as a current biomarker of stress. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 234 health workers from Hospital de Clínicas ""José de San Martín"", Buenos Aires University, were included in this study. In this population hair samples were obtained from the posterior vertex as close to the scalp as possible and the individuals completed the following surveys: perceived stress, social support, burnout scale, life event scale, and sociodemographic data. Hair cortisol was measured by an automated chemiluminescent method. The studied population was divided into three groups considering those individuals below the healthy reference sample range (< 40 pg/mg hair), within the healthy reference range (40-128 pg/mg hair) and above the reference range (> 128 pg/mg hair). This study used a transversal and observational design. RESULTS: Our results show that 40% of the studied population presented hair cortisol values outside of the healthy reference range. In the whole studied population, a direct correlation was found between hair cortisol concentration and perceived stress as well as between hair cortisol concentration and the emotional exhaustion component of burnout (r = 0.142, p = 0.030; r = 0.143, p = 0.029, respectively). 12% of the studied population showed Burnout (52% doctors and residents, 19% nurses, 19% administrative personnel). Higher values in hair cortisol levels were found in the group with burnout versus individuals without burnout (p = 0.034). Finally, a mediation analysis was performed, finding that depersonalization is a mediating variable in the relationship between self-perceived stress and hair cortisol level (F = 4.86, p = 0.0086; indirect effect IC: 0.0987-1.8840). CONCLUSION: This is the first study in which a stress biomarker such as hair cortisol is evaluated in this population and in this context. Healthcare workers are subjected to increased levels of stress and burnout. High depersonalization, emotional exhaustion, and decreased personal sense of accomplishment characterize this population. It is the responsibility of the health authorities to implement strategies to manage this psychological emergency.","Ibar, Carolina; Fortuna, Federico; Gonzalez, Diego; Jamardo, Juan; Jacobsen, Dario; Pugliese, Lucas; Giraudo, Laura; Ceres, Veronica; Mendoza, Cynthia; Repetto, Esteban M; Reboredo, Graciela; Iglesias, Silvia; Azzara, Sergio; Berg, Gabriela; Zopatti, Damian; Fabre, Bibiana",Psychoneuroendocrinology,107,16

It was unknown whether this negative messaging could be detrimental to the mental health of older individuals, and whether the relatively uncommon positive messaging about older individuals could benefit their mental health.

The negative versions of the two types of messaging reflected the age stereotype of decline whereas the positive versions of the two types of messaging reflected the age stereotype of resilience. RESULTS: As expected, the exposure of older individuals to the negative-age-stereotype-messaging interventions led to significantly worse mental health (more anxiety and less peacefulness), compared to a neutral condition; in contrast, the positive-age-stereotype-messaging interventions led to significantly better mental health (less anxiety and more peacefulness), compared to a neutral condition. The findings were equally strong for the personified and enumerative conditions. Also as expected, the interventions, which were self-irrelevant to the younger participants, did not significantly impact their mental health. DISCUSSION: This is the first-known study to experimentally demonstrate that institutional ageism, and statistics that reflect stereotypes about older individuals, can impact mental health. The results demonstrate the need for media messaging aimed at empowering older individuals during the pandemic and beyond.","Levy, Becca R; Chang, E-Shien; Lowe, Sarah; Provolo, Natalia; Slade, Martin D",,107,8

Recently, a specific score (named COVID-GRAM) for severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, based on a nationwide Chinese cohort, has been proposed. We routinely applied the National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2) to predict critical COVID-19. Aim of this study is to compare NEWS2 and COVID-GRAM score. METHODS: We retrospectively analysed data of 121 COVID-19 patients admitted in two Clinics of Infectious Diseases in the Umbria region, Italy. The primary outcome was critical COVID-19 illness defined as admission to the intensive care unit, invasive ventilation, or death. Accuracy of the scores was evaluated with the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUROC). Differences between scores were confirmed used Hanley-McNeil test. RESULTS: The NEWS2 AUROC curve measured 0.87 (standard error, SE 0.03; 95% CI 0.80-0.93; p < 0.0001). The COVID-GRAM score AUROC curve measured 0.77 (SE 0.04; 95% CI 0.68-0.85; p < 0.0001). Hanley-McNeil test showed that NEWS2 better predicted severe COVID-19 (Z = 2.03).

Given that this contagious viral outbreak is still unfolding, it is urgent to understand the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection and explore effective treatments to protect patients from developing a severe illness related to COVID-19. Recently, IFN-&#945; has been considered a potential therapeutic strategy to treat COVID-19 disease, mainly because the innate immune system rapidly produces IFN-&#945; as the first line of defense to combat viral infections. However, IFN-&#945; can also play a role in immunoregulatory effects, causing pathogenic damage and uncontrolled inflammatory responses. There are 13 human IFN-&#945; subtypes that bind to the same receptor and induce different interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression, regulating various antiviral and immunoregulatory effects. The varying degrees of inflammatory regulations may raise concerns about the possible side effects to enlarge the inflammatory responses, exacerbating the severity of infection. Thus, the analysis of various IFN-&#945; subtype induction during SARS-CoV-2 infection is necessary in exploring the mechanism of COVID-19 pathogenesis. This review summarizes the current understanding of IFN-&#945; in the pathogenesis of respiratory virus diseases and IFN-&#945; based clinical intervention used in SARS-CoV-2 infection and other respiratory virus diseases.

The impact of this post-translational modification on viral entry is yet unestablished. We expressed different glycoforms of the Spike-protein and ACE2 in CRISPR-Cas9 glycoengineered cells, and developed corresponding SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus. We observed that N- and O-glycans had only minor contribution to Spike-ACE2 binding. However, these carbohydrates played a major role in regulating viral entry. Blocking N-glycan biosynthesis at the oligomannose stage using both genetic approaches and the small molecule kifunensine dramatically reduced viral entry into ACE2 expressing HEK293T cells. Blocking O-glycan elaboration also partially blocked viral entry. Mechanistic studies suggest multiple roles for glycans during viral entry. Among them, inhibition of N-glycan biosynthesis enhanced Spike-protein proteolysis. This could reduce RBD presentation on virus, lowering binding to host ACE2 and decreasing viral entry. Overall, chemical inhibitors of glycosylation may be evaluated for COVID-19.","Yang, Qi; Hughes, Thomas A; Kelkar, Anju; Yu, Xinheng; Cheng, Kai; Park, Sheldon; Huang, Wei-Chiao; Lovell, Jonathan F; Neelamegham, Sriram",eLife (Cambridge),107,29

The evidence base regarding protection from respiratory pathogens in dentistry is poor. Those with a positive SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody are non-infectious (>99% certainty) and can be safely treated with good universal precautions, even for aerosol generating procedures. Viral infectivity with SARS-CoV-2 lasts eight days, unlike viral polymerase chain reaction (PCR) swab tests which can persist for as long as seven weeks. SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody becomes detectable from 11 days after infection. SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies are usually neutralising against the virus and their direct antiviral activity was partially demonstrated in 33,000 patients with COVID-19 treated with convalescent plasma in the USA. So, a positive SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody is a much more accurate determination of infectiousness than a repeat PCR which is only 70% sensitive. It remains to be seen whether SARS-Cov-2 vaccine responses include protective IgG titres and, once vaccines become widespread, can be used to assist decision-making on appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) in dentistry.","Denning, David W; Kilcoyne, Anthony; Ucer, Cemal",Br Dent J,107,16

We analyzed serum immunoglobulins IgM, -A, and -G directed against SARS-CoV-2 proteins by immunoblot analysis from 12 infected patients. We determined IgG isotype antibodies by commercially available ELISA and assessed the clinical parameters of inflammation status and kidney and liver injury. Unexpectedly, we found no correlation between the presence of antibodies and the future course of the disease. However, attention should be paid to the parameters CRP, IL-6, and LDH. We found evidence of antibody cross-reactivity, which questions the reliability of results for serum samples that tested negative for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies when assessed by immunoassays. Nevertheless, for the detection of IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, our data suggest that the use of the spike glycoprotein in immunoassays should be sufficient to identify positive patients. Using a combination of the spike glycoprotein and the open reading frame 8 protein could prove to be the best way of detecting anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM antibodies.","Meinberger, Denise; Koch, Manuel; Roth, Annika; Hermes, Gabriele; Stemler, Jannik; Cornely, Oliver A; Streichert, Thomas; Klatt, Andreas R",Sci Rep,107,30

It is vital to assess the performance of any diagnosis method on an independent data set and at very early stage of the disease when the disease severity of is very low. In such cases, most of the diagnosis methods fail. A total of 378 CXR images containing both normal lung and pneumonia (both COVID-19 and others lung conditions) were collected from publically available data set. 71 radiomics features for each lung segment were chosen from 100 extracted features based on Z-score heatmap and one way ANOVA test that can detect COVID-19. Three best performing classical machine learning algorithms during the training phase - 1) fine Gaussian support vector machine (SVM), 2) fine k-nearest neighbor (KNN) and 3) ensemble bagged model (EBM) trees were chosen for further evaluation on an independent test data set. The independent test data set consists of 115 COVID-19 CXR images collected from a local hospital and 100 CXR images collected from publically available data set containing normal lung and viral/bacterial pneumonia. Severity was scored between 0 to 4 by two experienced radiologists for each lung with pneumonia (both COVID-19 and non COVID-19) for the test data set. Ensemble Bagging Model Trees (EBM) with the selected radiomics features is the most suitable to distinguish between COVID-19 and other lung infections with an overall sensitivity of 87.8% and specificity of 97% (95.2% accuracy and 0.9228 area under curve) and is robust across severity levels. The method also can detect COVID-19 from CXR when two experienced radiologists were unable to detect any abnormality in the lung CXR (represented by severity score of 0). Once the CXR is acquired and lung is segmented, it takes less than two minutes for extracting radiomics features and providing diagnosis result. Since the proposed method does not require any manual intervention (e.g., sample collection etc.), it can be straightway integrated with standard X-ray reporting system to be used as an efficient, cost-effective and rapid early diagnosis device.","Tamal, Mahbubunnabi Alshammari Maha Alabdullah Meernah Hourani Rana Alola Hossain Abu Hegazi Tarek M.",Expert Systems with Applications,107,26

We aimed to compare the risk of death between COVID-19-related ARDS patients with corticosteroid treatment and those without. METHODS: In this single-center retrospective observational study, patients with ARDS caused by COVID-19 between January 20, 2020, and February 24, 2020, were enrolled. The primary outcome was 60-day in-hospital death. The exposure was prescribed systemic corticosteroids or not. Time-dependent Cox regression models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for 60-day in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: A total of 382 patients [60.7 ± 14.1 years old (mean ± SD), 61.3% males] were analyzed. The median of sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score was 2.0 (IQR 2.0-3.0). Of these cases, 94 (24.6%) patients had invasive mechanical ventilation. The number of patients received systemic corticosteroids was 226 (59.2%), and 156 (40.8%) received standard treatment. The maximum dose of corticosteroids was 80.0 (IQR 40.0-80.0) mg equivalent methylprednisolone per day, and duration of corticosteroid treatment was 7.0 (4.0-12.0) days in total. In Cox regression analysis using corticosteroid treatment as a time-varying variable, corticosteroid treatment was associated with a significant reduction in risk of in-hospital death within 60 days after adjusting for age, sex, SOFA score at hospital admission, propensity score of corticosteroid treatment, comorbidities, antiviral treatment, and respiratory supports (HR 0.42; 95% CI 0.21, 0.85; p = 0.0160). Corticosteroids were not associated with delayed viral RNA clearance in our cohort. CONCLUSION: In this clinical practice setting, low-dose corticosteroid treatment was associated with reduced risk of in-hospital death within 60 days in COVID-19 patients who developed ARDS.","Wu, Chaomin; Hou, Dongni; Du, Chunling; Cai, Yanping; Zheng, Junhua; Xu, Jie; Chen, Xiaoyan; Chen, Cuicui; Hu, Xianglin; Zhang, Yuye; Song, Juan; Wang, Lu; Chao, Yen-Cheng; Feng, Yun; Xiong, Weining; Chen, Dechang; Zhong, Ming; Hu, Jie; Jiang, Jinjun; Bai, Chunxue; Zhou, Xin; Xu, Jinfu; Song, Yuanlin; Gong, Fengyun",Crit Care,107,24

Epidemiologic observations, such as higher leukemia incidence in children living near roadways and industrial sources of air pollution, and new in vitro technologies that decode carcinogenesis at the molecular level, illustrate the diverse evidence that primary prevention of some cancers may be achieved by reducing harmful chemical exposures. The path forward requires cross-disciplinary approaches, increased environmental research investment, system-wide collaboration to develop safer economic alternatives, and community engagement to support evidence-informed action.

The disturbing statistics of this infection promoted us to develop an effective vaccine candidate against the COVID-19. In this study, bioinformatics approaches were employed to design and introduce a novel multi-epitope vaccine against 2019-nCoV that can potentially trigger both CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell immune responses and investigated its biological activities by computational tools. Three known antigenic proteins (Nucleocapsid, ORF3a, and Membrane protein, hereafter called NOM) from the virus were selected and analyzed for prediction of the potential immunogenic B and T-cell epitopes and then validated using bioinformatics tools. Based on in silico analysis, we have constructed a multi-epitope vaccine candidate (NOM) with five rich-epitopes domain including highly scored T and B-cell epitopes. After predicting and evaluating of the third structure of the protein candidate, the best 3 D predicted model was applied for docking studies with Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and HLA-A*11:01. In the next step, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was used to evaluate the stability of the designed fusion protein with TLR4 and HLA-A*11:01 receptors. MD studies demonstrated that the NOM-TLR4 and NOM-HLA-A*11:01 docked models were stable during simulation time. In silico evaluation showed that the designed chimeric protein could simultaneously elicit humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Effects on quality of life of persistent poor physical or mental health associated with COVID-19 are not well understood. METHODS: Adults aged &#8805;18 years with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and matched control patients who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 infection at outpatient facilities associated with 11 medical centers in the United States were interviewed to assess symptoms, illness duration, and health-related quality of life. Duration of symptoms, health-related quality of life measures, and days of poor physical health by symptoms experienced during illness were compared between case patients and controls using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. Symptoms associated with COVID-19 case status were evaluated by multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: Among 320 participants included, 157 were COVID-19 cases and 163 were SARS-CoV-2 negative controls. Loss of taste or smell was reported by 63% of cases and 6% of controls and was strongly associated with COVID-19 in logistic regression models (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 32.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 12.6-83.1). COVID-19 cases were more likely than controls to have experienced fever, body aches, weakness, or fatigue during illness, and to report &#8805;1 persistent symptom more than 14 days after symptom onset (50% vs 32%, P < .001). Cases reported significantly more days of poor physical health during the past 14 days than controls (P < .01). CONCLUSIONS: Differentiating COVID-19 from other acute illnesses will require widespread diagnostic testing, especially during influenza seasons.

It was affirmed that the preoccupation with the COVID-19 cases caused many other critical socioeconomic issues (like education, infrastructure development, and employment) to suffer a state of negligence or be overlooked. Like other developing countries, Nigeria could become poorer, given the increased unemployment rate and the anticipated difficulty in servicing debt resulting from the COVID-19 outbreak. Hence, festering challenges including poverty, limited access to health care, low education quality, poor road networks among others, could be further entrenched. These incidents could be detrimental to sustainable development goals (SDGs) 2030 agenda. The current crisis, therefore, poses a threat to Nigeria’s development prospects, as it may take more time to recover, especially in the post-COVID-19 era. Thus, it is critical to recognize the significance of securing strong institutional regulatory setup and resources (including financial and material resources) needed to facilitate sustainable change in the economy.","Fagbemi, Fisayo",Research in Globalization,107,16

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a retrospective study conducted from 22 January to 17 March 2020, 453 patients were admitted to Union Hospital in Wuhan, China, with laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. Patients were classified into four categories: normal glucose, hyperglycaemia (fasting glucose 5.6-6.9 mmol/L and/or HbA1c 5.7%-6.4%), newly diagnosed diabetes (fasting glucose &#8805;7 mmol/L and/or HbA1c &#8805;6.5%) and known diabetes. The major outcomes included in-hospital mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) admission and invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). RESULTS: Patients with newly diagnosed diabetes constituted the highest percentage to be admitted to the ICU (11.7%) and require IMV (11.7%), followed by patients with known diabetes (4.1%; 9.2%) and patients with hyperglycaemia (6.2%; 4.7%), compared with patients with normal glucose (1.5%; 2.3%), respectively.

The aim of the present study was to describe the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) at 90 days after ICU discharge in a cohort of COVID-19 patients undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation and to compare it with an age and sex-matched sample from the general Italian and Finnish populations. Moreover, the possible associations between clinical, demographic, social factors, and HRQoL were investigated. METHODS: COVID-19 ARDS survivors from 16 participating ICUs were followed up until 90 days after ICU discharge and the HRQoL was evaluated with the 15D instrument. A parallel cohort of age and sex-matched Italian population from the same geographic areas was interviewed and a third group of matched Finnish population was extracted from the Finnish 2011 National Health survey. A linear regression analysis was performed to evaluate potential associations between the evaluated factors and HRQoL. RESULTS: 205 patients answered to the questionnaire. HRQoL of the COVID-19 ARDS patients was significantly lower than the matched populations in both physical and mental dimensions. Age, sex, number of comorbidities, ARDS class, duration of invasive mechanical ventilation, and occupational status were found to be significant determinants of the 90 days HRQoL. Clinical severity at ICU admission was poorly correlated to HRQoL. CONCLUSION: COVID-19-related ARDS survivors at 90 days after ICU discharge present a significant reduction both on physical and psychological dimensions of HRQoL measured with the 15D instrument.

Reducing the proportion of young adults who get sunburned may reduce the incidence of melanoma, a deadly form of skin cancer. Advances in technology have enabled the delivery of real-time UV light exposure and content-relevant health interventions. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to examine the feasibility of young adults performing the following tasks daily: wearing a UV dosimeter, receiving text messages and real-time UV-B doses on their smartphone, and responding to daily web-based surveys about sunburn and sun protection. METHODS: Young adults aged 18-39 years (n=42) were recruited in the United States in June 2020 via social media. Participants received the UV Guard sun protection system, which consisted of a UV dosimeter and a smartphone app. During 3 consecutive periods, intervention intensity increased as follows: real-time UV-B dose; UV-B dose and daily behavioral facilitation text messages; and UV-B dose, goal setting, and daily text messages to support self-efficacy and self-regulation. Data were self-reported through daily web-based surveys for 28 days, and UV-B doses were transmitted to cloud-based storage. RESULTS: Patients' median age was 22 years (IQR 20, 29), and all patients had sun-sensitive skin. Sunburns were experienced during the study by fewer subjects (n=18) than those in the preceding 28 days (n=30). In July and August, the face was the most commonly sunburned area among 13 body locations; 52% (22/42) of sunburns occurred before the study and 45% (19/42) occurred during the study. The mean daily UV-B dose decreased during the 3 periods; however, this was not statistically significant. Young adults were most often exercising outdoors from 2 to 6 PM, walking from 10 AM to 6 PM, and relaxing from noon to 2 PM. Sunburn was most often experienced during exercise (odds ratio [OR] 5.65, 95% CI 1.60-6.10) and relaxation (OR 3.69, 95% CI 1.03-4.67) relative to those that did not exercise or relax in each category. The self-reported exit survey indicated that participants felt that they spent less time outdoors this summer compared to the last summer because of the COVID-19 pandemic and work. In addition, 38% (16/42) of the participants changed their use of sun protection based on their app-reported UV exposure, and 48% (20/42) shifted the time they went outside to periods with less-intense UV exposure. A total of 79% (33/42) of the participants were willing to continue using the UV Guard system outside of a research setting. CONCLUSIONS: In this proof-of-concept research, young adults demonstrated that they used the UV Guard system; however, optimization was needed. Although some sun protection behaviors changed, sunburn was not prevented in all participants, especially during outdoor exercise.

Mounting evidence shows that the characteristics of the age-related clinical severity of COVID-19 are attributed to insufficient antiviral immune function and excessive self-damaging immune reaction, involving T cell immunity and associated with pre-existing basal inflammation in the elderly. Age-related changes to T cell immunosenescence is characterized by not only restricted T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire diversity, accumulation of exhausted and/or senescent memory T cells, but also by increased self-reactive T cell- and innate immune cell-induced chronic inflammation, and accumulated and functionally enhanced polyclonal regulatory T (Treg) cells. Many of these changes can be traced back to age-related thymic involution/degeneration. How these changes contribute to differences in COVID-19 disease severity between young and aged patients is an urgent area of investigation. Therefore, we attempt to connect various clues in this field by reviewing and discussing recent research on the role of the thymus and T cells in COVID-19 immunity during aging (a synergistic effect of diminished responses to pathogens and enhanced responses to self) impacting age-related clinical severity of COVID-19. We also address potential combinational strategies to rejuvenate multiple aging-impacted immune system checkpoints by revival of aged thymic function, boosting peripheral T cell responses, and alleviating chronic, basal inflammation to improve the efficiency of anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunity and vaccination in the elderly.","Wang, Weikan; Thomas, Rachel; Oh, Jiyoung; Su, Dong-Ming",,107,4

Due to the virus' novelty and high infectivity, early diagnosis is key to curtailing spread. The knowledge and identification of chest Computerized Tomography (CT) features in Patients Under Investigation (PUI) for the disease would help in its management and containment. Objectives: To describe the chest CT findings of PUI for COVID-19 pneumonia referred to the Department of Radiology of the Korle Bu Teaching Hospital; as well as to determine the relationship between symptom onset and severity of the chest CT findings. Methods: The study was retrospective and included 63 PUI for COVID-19 referred to the Department between 11th April, 2020 and 10th June, 2020, for non-enhanced chest CT imaging. Clinical data were obtained from patients' records and Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) results were acquired after the CT evaluation. Results: The mean age in years was 51.1±19.9 SD. More males (52.8%) than females (47.2%) tested positive for COVID-19 and the age range for positive cases was 7 months to 86 years, with a mean of 53.2±21 SD years. Common features of COVID-19 pneumonia were bilateral posterior basal consolidations, Ground Glass Opacities (GGO) and air bronchograms.

Unfortunately, there is not yet a specific vaccine or effective antiviral drug for treating COVID-19. Many of these patients deteriorate rapidly and require intubation and are mechanically ventilated, which is causing the collapse of the health system in many countries due to lack of ventilators and intensive care beds. In this document we review two simple adjuvant therapies to administer, without side effects, and low cost that could be useful for the treatment of acute severe coronavirus infection associated with acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2). VitaminC, a potent antioxidant, has emerged as a relevant therapy due to its potential benefits when administered intravenous. The potential effect of vitaminC in reducing inflammation in the lungs could play a key role in lung injury caused by coronavirus infection. Another potential effective therapy is ozone: it has been extensively studied and used for many years and its effectiveness has been demonstrated so far in multiples studies. Nevertheless, our goal is not to make an exhaustive review of these therapies but spread the beneficial effects themselves. Obviously clinical trials are necessaries, but due to the potential benefit of these two therapies we highly recommended to add to the therapeutic arsenal.","Hernández, A; Papadakos, P J; Torres, A; González, D A; Vives, M; Ferrando, C; Baeza, J",Rev Esp Anestesiol Reanim,107,22

Older adults with underlying health conditions are at an especially high risk of developing life-threatening complications if infected. Most intensive care unit (ICU) admissions and non-ICU hospitalizations have been among patients with at least one underlying health condition. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop a model to estimate the risk status of the patients of a nationwide pharmacy chain in the United States, and to identify the geographic distribution of patients who have the highest risk of severe COVID-19 complications. METHODS: A risk model was developed using a training test split approach to identify patients who are at high risk of developing serious complications from COVID-19. Adult patients (aged &#8805;18 years) were identified from the Walgreens pharmacy electronic data warehouse. Patients were considered eligible to contribute data to the model if they had at least one prescription filled at a Walgreens location between October 27, 2019, and March 25, 2020. Risk parameters included age, whether the patient is being treated for a serious or chronic condition, and urban density classification. Parameters were differentially weighted based on their association with severe complications, as reported in earlier cases. An at-risk rate per 1000 people was calculated at the county level, and ArcMap was used to depict the rate of patients at high risk for severe complications from COVID-19. Real-time COVID-19 cases captured by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) were layered in the risk map to show where cases exist relative to the high-risk populations. RESULTS: Of the 30,100,826 adults included in this study, the average age is 50 years, 15% have at least one specialty medication, and the average patient has 2 to 3 comorbidities. Nearly 28% of patients have the greatest risk score, and an additional 34.64% of patients are considered high-risk, with scores ranging from 8 to 10. Age accounts for 53% of a patient's total risk, followed by the number of comorbidities (29%); inferred chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, or diabetes (15%); and urban density classification (5%). CONCLUSIONS: This risk model utilizes data from approximately 10% of the US population. Currently, this is the most comprehensive US model to estimate and depict the county-level prognosis of COVID-19 infection. This study shows that there are counties across the United States whose residents are at high risk of developing severe complications from COVID-19. Our county-level risk estimates may be used alongside other data sets to improve the accuracy of anticipated health care resource needs. The interactive map can also aid in proactive planning and preparations among employers that are deemed critical, such as pharmacies and grocery stores, to prevent the spread of COVID-19 within their facilities.","Smith-Ray, Renae; Roberts, Erin E; Littleton, Devonee E; Singh, Tanya; Sandberg, Thomas; Taitel, Michael",JMIR Public Health Surveill,107,16

Nafamostat has recently been reported as a therapeutic agent for COVID-19. However, there is a lack of information on the compatibility of nafamostat with the aforementioned drug classes. This study evaluated the physical compatibility of nafamostat with these drug classes. METHODS: Nafamostat was combined with 1-3 target drugs (fentanyl, morphine, midazolam, dexmedetomidine, and rocuronium). Fifteen physical compatibility tests were conducted. Nafamostat was dissolved in 5% glucose solution; the final concentration was 10 mg/mL. All other medications were diluted in 0.9% sodium chloride to obtain clinically relevant concentrations. The power of hydrogen (pH) of all medications was measured during each test. Compatibility tests were conducted with four test solutions wherein nafamostat and the target drugs were compounded at equal volume ratios (1:1, 1:1:1, or 1:1:1:1). Visual appearance, turbidity, and pH were evaluated immediately after mixing and at 1 and 3 hours. Physical incompatibilities were defined as gross precipitation, cloudiness, appearance of the Tyndall effect, or a turbidity change of &#8805;0.5 nephelometric turbidity unit (NTU) based on nafamostat. RESULTS: The mean pH of nafamostat was 3.13 ± 0.03. The combination of nafamostat, fentanyl, and dexmedetomidine had the highest pH (3.39 ± 0.01; 3 hours after mixing). All drugs were compatible with nafamostat until 3 hours after admixture, with a mean turbidity value of <0.03 NTU. CONCLUSIONS: Infusions combining nafamostat with the tested sedatives, analgesics, and muscle relaxants could be safely administered.","Kondo, Masayoshi; Nagano, Makihiko; Yoshida, Mariko; Yoshida, Naoki; Tagui, Naoya; Yoshida, Masato; Sugaya, Kazutoshi; Takase, Hisamitsu",J.

METHODS: The DOX&IR780@PEG-PCL-SS NPs were prepared by co-precipitation method. We investigated the tumor targeting capability of NPs in vitro and in vivo. The orthotopic bladder cancer model in C57BL/6 mice was established for in vivo study and the photothermal effects and therapeutic efficacy of NPs were evaluated. RESULTS: The DOX&IR780@PEG-PCL-SS NPs were synthesized using internal cross-linking strategy to increase the stability of nanoparticles. Nanoparticles can be ingested by tumor cells in a short time. The DOX&IR780@PEG-PCL-SS NPs have dual sensitivity to high levels of glutathione in bladder cancer cells and near-infrared laser irradiation. Glutathione triggers chemical structural changes of nanoparticles and preliminarily releases drugs, Near-infrared laser irradiation can promote the complete release of the drugs from the nanoparticles and induce a photothermal effect, leading to destroying the tumor cells. Given the excellent tumor-targeting ability and negligible toxicity to normal tissue, DOX&IR780@PEG-PCL-SS NPs can greatly increase the concentration of the anti-cancer drugs in tumor cells. The mice treated with DOX&IR780@PEG-PCL-SS NPs have a significant reduction in tumor volume. The DOX&IR780@PEG-PCL-SS NPs can be tracked by in vivo imaging system and have good tumor targeting ability, to facilitate our assessment during the experiment. CONCLUSION: A nanoparticle delivery system with dual sensitivity to glutathione and near-infrared laser irradiation was developed for delivering IR780 and DOX. Chemo-photothermal synergistic therapy of both primary bladder cancer and their metastases was achieved using this advanced delivery system.","Zhu, Guanchen; Wang, Kaikai; Qin, Haixiang; Zhao, Xiaozhi; Chen, Wei; Xu, Linfeng; Cao, Wenmin; Guo, Hongqian",J Nanobiotechnology,107,20

The outbreak that started from January 22, 2020, in Fujian Province has been controlled as the number of indigenous cases has not increased since March. We aimed to describe the clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 in Fujian Province, China. METHODS: In this retrospective, multicenter study, we collected and analyzed the epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory data of all cases confirmed by nucleic acid tests in five designated hospitals in Fujian Province between January 22 and February 27, 2020. All patients were followed up until discharge. COVID-19 severity was classified as mild, moderate, severe, or critical. RESULTS: Of 199 discharged patients with COVID-19, 105 patients were male, with a median age of 46.3 years, and 17 patients were severe, and 5 patients were critical on admission. Hypertension and diabetes were the most common comorbidities. The symptoms at illness onset were mainly fever (76.4%), cough (60.8%), and myalgia or fatigue (27.6%). A total of 96.5% of patients had abnormal imaging findings on chest computed tomography. Lymphopenia (37.2%) and hypoxemia (13.6%) were observed. Acute respiratory distress syndrome and respiratory failure occurred in 9 patients (4.5%) and 8 patients (4.0%) respectively. One patient died and the others were cured and discharged with the median hospital stay of 19 days. Old age was negatively correlated with lymphocyte count (r = - 0.296, p < 0.001) and oxygenation index (r = - 0.263, p = 0.001). Bivariate regression analysis revealed that old age (&#8805; 75 years), hypertension, diabetes, and lymphopenia were correlated with the severity of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Patients in Fujian Province were mostly nonsevere cases with mild or moderate symptoms, and had a lower mortality than patients in Wuhan (4.3%-15%). Older age, hypertension, diabetes, and lymphopenia were risk factors for severity of COVID-19.","Wang, Sijiao; Chen, Zhisheng; Lin, Yijian; Lin, Li; Lin, Qunying; Fang, Sufang; Shi, Yonghong; Zhuang, Xibin; Ye, Yuming; Wang, Ting; Zhang, Hongying; Shao, Changzhou",PLoS One,107,32

It is the third zoonotic coronavirus-dependent outbreak in the last twenty years and represents a major infective threat for public health worldwide. A main aspect of the infection, in analogy to other viral infections, is the so-called ""cytokine storm"", an inappropriate molecular response to virus spread which plays major roles in tissue and organ damage. Immunological therapies, including vaccines and humanized monoclonal antibodies, have been proposed as major strategies for prevention and treatment of the disease. Accordingly, a detailed mechanistic knowledge of the molecular events with which the virus infects cells and induces an immunological response appears necessary. In this review, we will report details of the initial process of SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry with major emphasis on the maturation of the spike protein. Then, a particular focus will be devoted to describe the possible mechanisms by which dendritic cells, a major cellular component of innate and adaptive immune responses, may play a role in the spread of the virus in the human body and in the clinical evolution of the disease.","Campana, Pasquale; Parisi, Valentina; Leosco, Dario; Bencivenga, Debora; Della Ragione, Fulvio; Borriello, Adriana",,107,16

To this end, it provides an overview of the nature and evolution of Indian secularism. Thereafter, it encapsulates the steps taken by the State to meet the exigencies of the present contagion and attempts to gauge the impact of the said steps on the jurisprudence on religious freedoms. It then seeks to contextualise this impact by using it to inform the Indian conception of secularism and, thereby, promote a richer, more holistic understanding of how a deeply divided society has functioned as a secular State for seven decades.

This study aims to evaluate the effects of the pandemic on emergency department visits of surgical patients. METHODS: The hospital database records of general surgery patients who presented at the emergency department in the period of March 2020-May 2020 (pandemic period) and March 2019-May 2019 (non-pandemic period) were retrospectively analyzed and compared. The primary outcome of this study was the emergency department visit rate of patients requiring a general surgery consultation. Secondary outcomes of this study were patient complaints, diagnosis and treatments, treatment rejection rate, triage category data, the effects of age and gender, and the hospitalization rate. RESULTS: In this study, 618 patients were included: 265 patients from the pandemic period and 353 patients from the non-pandemic period. The analysis and comparison revealed that during the pandemic period, the presentation rate of female patients was lower than that of male patients (45.5% vs. 55.5%, respectively, p=0.045). The triage category rates of patient visits to the hospital during the pandemic period were higher in yellow and red, and lower in green (p<0.01). The incidence of a surgical pathology finding was higher during the pandemic period (p=0.019). The incidence of diseases related to the gastrointestinal tract was higher during the pandemic period (p=0.011). The rate of open surgery in the pandemic period was higher than that of the non-pandemic period (80.5% vs. 32.7%, respectively; p<0.01). The treatment rejection rate was also higher in the pandemic period compared with the non-pandemic period (20% vs. 3.7%, respectively; p<0.01, r). In addition, the hospitalization period was shorter in the pandemic period (p=0.021). CONCLUSION: A 25% reduction in the number of surgical patient visits to the emergency department was observed during the COVID-19 outbreak. The biggest decrease was seen in patients with a green triage code and female patients. It is significant to evaluate the effects of the pandemic on surgical patients visited the emergency department to manage the post-epidemic period and to prepare for possible future epidemic periods.","Göksoy, Beslen; Akça, Muhammed Tahir; Inanç, Ömer Faruk",Ulus Travma Acil Cerrahi Derg,107,9

This study aims to identify and evaluate the forms of supportive care for patients with respiratory diseases. Methods: An umbrella review of supportive care for patient with respiratory diseases was undertaken. We comprehensively searched the following databases: Medline, EMBASE, Web of Science, CNKI (China National Knowledge Infrastructure), Wanfang Data and CBM (SinoMed) from their inception to 31 March 2020, and other sources to identify systematic reviews and meta-analyses related to supportive treatments for patient with respiratory diseases including Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and influenza. We assessed the methodological quality using the AMSTAR score and the quality of the evidence for the primary outcomes of each included systematic review and meta-analysis. Results: We included 18 systematic reviews and meta-analyses in this study. Most studies focused on the respiratory and circulatory support. Ten studies were of high methodological quality, five studies of medium quality, and three studies of low quality. According to four studies extracorporeal membrane oxygenation did not reduce mortality in adults [odds ratio/relative risk (OR/RR) ranging from 0.71 to 1.28], but two studies reported significantly lower mortality in patients receiving venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation than in the control group (OR/RR ranging from 0.38 to 0.73). Besides, monitoring of vital signs and increasing the number of medical staff may also reduce the mortality in patients with respiratory diseases. Conclusions: Our overview suggests that supportive care may reduce the mortality of patients with respiratory diseases to some extent. However, the quality of evidence for the primary outcomes in the included studies was low to moderate. Further systematic reviews and meta-analyses are needed to address the evidence gap regarding the supportive care for SARS, MERS and COVID-19.","Luo, Xufei; Lv, Meng; Wang, Xiaoqing; Long, Xin; Ren, Mengjuan; Zhang, Xianzhuo; Liu, Yunlan; Li, Weiguo; Zhou, Qi; Ma, Yanfang; Fukuoka, Toshio; Ahn, Hyeong Sik; Lee, Myeong Soo; Luo, Zhengxiu; Liu, Enmei; Wang, Xiaohui; Chen, Yaolong",Ann.

The regular practice of physical activity (PA) is a time cue that decreased during SDIST. However, it is unknown if decreased PA may be associated with increase of eveningness preference. This study aimed to investigate if PA changes might be associated with changes in the morningness-eveningness preference of individuals practicing SDIST in Brazil. For this, 322 adults (18-89 years-old) regularly living in Brazil between March and October 2020 answered an online survey including questions considering the before and during SDIST period on PA (min/week) and morningness-eveningness questionnaire score. Sociodemographic, SDIST, anthropometric, and health characteristics were also included in the online survey. Participants self-reported an increase of eveningness preference comparing Before-SDIST with During-SDIST scores (56 ± 12 vs. 52 ± 13, p < .0001). Self-reported PA decreased comparing Before-SDIST with During-SDIST (230 ± 170 vs. 149 ± 155 min/week, p < .0001).

Important to note that this concept alone can be easily misinterpreted as it is bound to many internal assumptions of the underlying model and significantly affected by the assumed recovery period. Here we present our experience, as part of the Basque Country Modeling Task Force (BMTF), in monitoring the development of the COVID-19 epidemic, by considering not only the behaviour of r(t) estimated for the new tested positive cases-significantly affected by the increased testing capacities, but also the momentary growth rates for hospitalizations, ICU admissions, deceased and recovered cases, in assisting the Basque Health Managers and the Basque Government during the lockdown lifting measures. Two different data sets, collected and then refined during the COVID-19 responses, are used as an exercise to estimate the momentary growth rates and reproduction numbers over time in the Basque Country, and the implications of using those concepts to make decisions about easing lockdown and relaxing social distancing measures are discussed. These results are potentially helpful for task forces around the globe which are now struggling to provide real scientific advice for health managers and governments while the lockdown measures are relaxed.","Aguiar, Maíra; Van-Dierdonck, Joseba Bidaurrazaga; Stollenwerk, Nico",PLoS One,107,17

The resulting disease, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), can cause multi-organ system dysfunction in patients requiring hospitalisation and intensive care treatment. Serious infections like COVID-19 often negatively affect nutritional status, and the resulting nutritional deficiencies may increase disease severity and impair recovery. One example is the viral infection measles, where associated vitamin A (VA) deficiency increases disease severity and appropriately timed supplementation during recovery reduces mortality and hastens recovery. VA may play a similar role in COVID-19. First, VA is important in maintaining innate and adaptive immunity to promote clearance of a primary infection as well as minimise risks from secondary infections. Second, VA plays a unique role in the respiratory tract, minimising damaging inflammation, supporting repair of respiratory epithelium and preventing fibrosis. Third, VA deficiency may develop during COVID-19 due to specific effects on lung and liver stores caused by inflammation and impaired kidney function, suggesting that supplements may be needed to restore adequate status. Fourth, VA supplementation may counteract adverse effects of SARS-CoV2 on the angiotensin system as well as minimises adverse effects of some COVID-19 therapies. Evaluating interactions of SARS-CoV2 infection with VA metabolism may thus provide improved COVID-19 therapy.","Stephensen, C B; Lietz, G",Br J Nutr,107,12

People living with human immunodeficiency virus (PLHIV) have concerns about whether they have a higher risk of getting the infection and suffer worse COVID-19 outcomes. Findings from studies on these questions have largely been inconsistent. We aimed to determine the epidemiological characteristics, clinical signs and symptoms, blood parameters, and clinical outcomes among PLHIV who contracted COVID-19. Relevant studies were identified through Medline, Cinahl, and PubMed databases. A random-effects model was used in meta-analyses with a 95% confidence interval. Eighty-two studies were included in the systematic review and sixty-seven studies for the meta-analysis. The pooled incidence proportion of COVID-19 among PLHIV was 0.9% (95% CI 0.6%, 1.1%) based on the data from seven cohort studies. Overall, 28.4% were hospitalised, of whom, 2.5% was severe-critical cases and 3.5% needed intensive care. The overall mortality rate was 5.3%. Hypertension was the most commonly reported comorbidity (24.0%). Fever (71.1%) was the most common symptom. Chest imaging demonstrated a wide range of abnormal findings encompassing common changes such as ground glass opacities and consolidation as well as a spectrum of less common abnormalities. Laboratory testing of inflammation markers showed that C-reactive protein, ferritin, and interleukin-6 were frequently elevated, albeit to different extents. Clinical features as well as the results of chest imaging and laboratory testing were similar in highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART)-treated and non-treated patients. PLHIV were not found to be at higher risk for adverse outcomes of COVID-19. Hence, in COVID-19 management, it appears that they can be treated the same way as HIV negative individuals. Nevertheless, as the pandemic situation is rapidly evolving, more evidence may be needed to arrive at definitive recommendations.","Lee, Kai Wei; Yap, Sook Fan; Ngeow, Yun Fong; Lye, Munn Sann",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),107,16

For example, when given time series of COVID-19 cases in a region, we may raise early warning signals of an epidemic by detecting signs of changes in the data. We propose a novel methodology to address this issue. The key idea is to employ a new information-theoretic notion, which we call the differential minimum description length change statistics (D-MDL), for measuring the scores of change sign. We first give a fundamental theory for D-MDL. We then demonstrate its effectiveness using synthetic datasets. We apply it to detecting early warning signals of the COVID-19 epidemic using time series of the cases for individual countries. We empirically demonstrate that D-MDL is able to raise early warning signals of events such as significant increase/decrease of cases. Remarkably, for about $64\%$ of the events of significant increase of cases in studied countries, our method can detect warning signals as early as nearly six days on average before the events, buying considerably long time for making responses. We further relate the warning signals to the dynamics of the basic reproduction number $R0$ and the timing of social distancing. The results show that our method is a promising approach to the epidemic analysis from a data science viewpoint.

Deaths caused by COVID-19 are still increasing day by day and early diagnosis has become crucial. Since current diagnostic methods have many disadvantages, new investigations are needed to improve the performance of diagnosis. METHODS: A novel method is proposed to automatically diagnose COVID-19 by using Electrocardiogram (ECG) data with deep learning for the first time. Moreover, a new and effective method called hexaxial feature mapping is proposed to represent 12-lead ECG to 2D colorful images. Gray-Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM) method is used to extract features and generate hexaxial mapping images. These generated images are then fed into a new Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture to diagnose COVID-19. RESULTS: Two different classification scenarios are conducted on a publicly available paper-based ECG image dataset to reveal the diagnostic capability and performance of the proposed approach. In the first scenario, ECG data labeled as COVID-19 and No-Findings (normal) are classified to evaluate COVID-19 classification ability. According to results, the proposed approach provides encouraging COVID-19 detection performance with an accuracy of 96.20% and F1-Score of 96.30%. In the second scenario, ECG data labeled as Negative (normal, abnormal, and myocardial infarction) and Positive (COVID-19) are classified to evaluate COVID-19 diagnostic ability. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed approach provides satisfactory COVID-19 prediction performance with an accuracy of 93.00% and F1-Score of 93.20%. Furthermore, different experimental studies are conducted to evaluate the robustness of the proposed approach. CONCLUSION: Automatic detection of cardiovascular changes caused by COVID-19 can be possible with a deep learning framework through ECG data. This not only proves the presence of cardiovascular changes caused by COVID-19 but also reveals that ECG can potentially be used in the diagnosis of COVID-19. We believe the proposed study may provide a crucial decision-making system for healthcare professionals.

These arms are dexterous and high-dimensional; however, the interfaces people must use to control their robots are low-dimensional. Consider teleoperating a 7-DoF robot arm with a 2-DoF joystick. The robot is helping you eat dinner, and currently you want to cut a piece of tofu. Today's robots assume a pre-defined mapping between joystick inputs and robot actions: in one mode the joystick controls the robot's motion in the x-y plane, in another mode the joystick controls the robot's z-yaw motion, and so on. But this mapping misses out on the task you are trying to perform! Ideally, one joystick axis should control how the robot stabs the tofu and the other axis should control different cutting motions. Our insight is that we can achieve intuitive, user-friendly control of assistive robots by embedding the robot's high-dimensional actions into low-dimensional and human-controllable latent actions. We divide this process into three parts. First, we explore models for learning latent actions from offline task demonstrations, and formalize the properties that latent actions should satisfy. Next, we combine learned latent actions with autonomous robot assistance to help the user reach and maintain their high-level goals. Finally, we learn a personalized alignment model between joystick inputs and latent actions. We evaluate our resulting approach in four user studies where non-disabled participants reach marshmallows, cook apple pie, cut tofu, and assemble dessert. We then test our approach with two disabled adults who leverage assistive devices on a daily basis.","Losey, Dylan P.; Jeon, Hong Jun; Li, Mengxi; Srinivasan, Krishnan; Mandlekar, Ajay; Garg, Animesh; Bohg, Jeannette; Sadigh, Dorsa",,107,24

Previous studies in animal models of GN and sclerosing kidney diseases have demonstrated protective effects of bradykinin receptor 1 (B1R) blockade via interference with myeloid cell trafficking. METHODS: To investigate the role of B1R in a murine model of MPO-ANCA GN, we evaluated effects of B1R genetic ablation and pharmacologic blockade. We used bone marrow chimeric mice to determine the role of B1R in bone marrow-derived cells (leukocytes) versus nonbone marrow-derived cells. We elucidated mechanisms of B1R effects using in vitro assays for MPO-ANCA-induced neutrophil activation, endothelial adherence, endothelial transmigration, and neutrophil adhesion molecule surface display. RESULTS: B1R deficiency or blockade prevented or markedly reduced ANCA-induced glomerular crescents, necrosis, and leukocyte influx in mice. B1R was not required for in vitro MPO-ANCA-induced neutrophil activation. Leukocyte B1R deficiency, but not endothelial B1R deficiency, decreased glomerular neutrophil infiltration induced by MPO-ANCA in vivo. B1R enhanced ANCA-induced neutrophil endothelial adhesion and transmigration in vitro. ANCA-activated neutrophils exhibited changes in Mac-1 and LFA-1, important regulators of neutrophil endothelial adhesion and transmigration: ANCA-activated neutrophils increased surface expression of Mac-1 and increased shedding of LFA-1, whereas B1R blockade reduced these effects. CONCLUSIONS: The leukocyte B1R plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of MPO-ANCA-induced GN in a mouse model by modulating neutrophil-endothelial interaction. B1R blockade may have potential as a therapy for ANCA GN and vasculitis.","Hu, Peiqi; Su, Hua; Xiao, Hong; Gou, Shen-Ju; Herrera, Carolina A; Alba, Marco A; Kakoki, Masao; Falk, Ronald J; Jennette, J Charles",J Am Soc Nephrol,107,16

The clinical and research capacity across the USA is unparalleled, yet compared to other high and even some middle-income countries, the average health indicators of the population remain suboptimal in 2020, a finding at least in part explained by inequity in healthcare access. In this context, COVID-19 has rapidly emerged as a major threat to the public's health. While it was initially thought that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 would be the great equaliser as it would not discriminate, it is clear that COVID-19 incidence and mortality have rapidly reinforced health disparities drawn by historical and contemporary inequities. Here, we synthesise the data highlighting specific risks among particular marginalised and under-resourced communities including those in jails, prisons and detention centers, immigrants and the undocumented, people with disabilities and people experiencing homelessness across the USA. The drivers of these disparities are pervasive structural risks including limited access to preventive services, inability to comply with physical distancing recommendations, underlying health disparities and intersecting stigmas particularly affecting racial and ethnic minorities across the country, including African Americans, Latinx Americans and Native Americans. Advancing the COVID-19 response, saving lives and restarting the economy necessitate rapidly addressing these inequities rather than ignoring and even reinforcing them.","Okonkwo, Nneoma E; Aguwa, Ugochi T; Jang, Minyoung; Barré, Iman A; Page, Kathleen R; Sullivan, Patrick S; Beyrer, Chris; Baral, Stefan",BMJ Evid.

Following severe tissue trauma, patients frequently develop acute lung injury (ALI) and/or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) despite modern surgical and intensive care concepts. The underlying complex pathophysiology of life-threatening ALI/ARDS has been intensively studied in experimental and clinical settings. However, currently, the coronavirus family has become the focus of ALI/ARDS research because it represents an emerging global public health threat. The clinical presentation of the infection is highly heterogeneous, varying from a lack of symptoms to multiple organ dysfunction and mortality. In a particular subset of patients, the primary infection progresses rapidly to ALI and ARDS. The pathophysiological mechanisms triggering and driving severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-induced ALI/ARDS are still poorly understood. Although it is also generally unknown whether insights from trauma-induced ARDS may be readily translated to SARS-CoV-2-associated ARDS, it was still recommended to treat coronavirus-positive patients with ALI/ARDS with standard protocols for ALI/ARDS. However, this strategy was questioned by clinical scientists, because it was documented that some severely hypoxic SARS-CoV-2-infected patients exhibited a normal respiratory system compliance, a phenomenon rarely observed in ARDS patients with another underlying etiology. Therefore, coronavirus-induced ARDS was defined as a specific ARDS phenotype, which accordingly requires an adjusted therapeutic approach. These suggestions reflect previous attempts of classifying ARDS into different phenotypes that might overall facilitate ARDS diagnosis and treatment. Based on the clinical data from ARDS patients, two major phenotypes have been proposed: hyper- and hypo-inflammatory. Here, we provide a comparative review of the pathophysiological pathway of trauma-/hemorrhagic shock-induced ARDS and coronavirus-induced ARDS, with an emphasis on the crucial key points in the pathogenesis of both these ARDS forms. Therefore, the manifold available data on trauma-/hemorrhagic shock-induced ARDS may help to better understand coronavirus-induced ARDS.","Lupu, Ludmila; Palmer, Annette; Huber-Lang, Markus",Front Immunol,107,1

Many contributors to bile acid synthesis and transport have previously been reported to be downregulated in patients with BA; yet, the driving factors of the abnormal bile acid synthesis and transport in regard to BA have not been previously studied. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Wild type or Ig-&#945;-/- mice were injected with salt solution (control) or rotavirus on day of life 0, and analyses were performed on day of life 14. The mRNA levels of bile acid transporters/nuclear receptors and liver microRNAs (miRNAs) were compared between groups. A mouse hepatocyte cell line was used to examine the effects of innate cytokines on miRNA levels and bile acid transporter/nuclear receptor expression and miRNAs on bile acid transporter/nuclear receptor expression. RESULTS: BA mice had significantly increased mRNA expression of innate cytokines and miRNAs known to bind bile acid transporters/nuclear receptors (miRNAs -22-5p, -34a-5p, and -222-3p) and decreased mRNA expression of bile acid transporters and nuclear receptors. In vitro, TNF-&#945; and IL-1ß decreased BSEP and CYP7A1 while increasing miRNA-34a-5p and miRNA 222-3p. LXR, SHP, CYP7A1, NTCP, and MRP2 were decreased by miRNA-34a-5p, whereas miRNA-222-3p decreased NTCP and MRP4. TNF-&#945; and IL-1ß increased expression of miRNAs 34a-5p and 222-3p and these miRNAs then decrease expression of multiple bile acid transporters and nuclear receptors. CONCLUSIONS: Loss of bile acid transporters increases hepatotoxicity via bile acid retention.

To investigate the immune characteristics of early SARS-CoV-2 infection in children and possible key prognostic factors for early identification of critical COVID-19, a retrospective study including 121 children with COVID-19 was conducted. Peripheral blood lymphocyte subset counts, T cell-derived cytokine concentrations, inflammatory factor concentrations, and routine blood counts were analyzed statistically at the initial presentation. RESULTS: The T lymphocyte subset and natural killer cell counts decreased with increasing disease severity. Group III (critical cases) had a higher Th/Tc ratio than groups I and II (common and severe cases); group I had a higher B cell count than groups II and III. IL-6, IL-10, IFN-Î³, SAA, and procalcitonin levels increased with increasing disease severity. Hemoglobin concentration, and RBC and eosinophil counts decreased with increasing disease severity. Groups II and III had significantly lower lymphocyte counts than group I. T, Th, Tc, IL-6, IL-10, RBC, and hemoglobin had relatively high contribution and area under the curve values. CONCLUSIONS: Decreased T, Th, Tc, RBC, hemoglobin and increased IL-6 and IL-10 in early SARS-CoV-2 infection in children are valuable indices for early diagnosis of severe disease. The significantly reduced Th and Tc cells and significantly increased IL-6, IL-10, ferritin, procalcitonin, and SAA at this stage in children with critical COVID-19 may be closely associated with the systemic cytokine storm caused by immune dysregulation.","Lu, Wenjie; Yang, Li; Li, Xiong; Sun, Ming; Zhang, Aiping; Qi, Shanshan; Chen, Zhi; Zhang, Lannan; Li, Jianxin; Xiong, Hao",BMC Pediatr,107,1

To this end, we conducted a systematic evaluation of studies that investigated laboratory abnormalities in patients with COVID-19 and compared i. patients with a severe form of disease and patients with a non-severe form of the disease, ii. patients who were in critical condition and patients who were not in critical condition, and iii. patients who survived and patients who died. We included 54 studies in the data synthesis. Compared to patients with a non-severe form of COVID-19, patients who had a severe form of disease revealed higher values for white blood cells (WBC), polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN), total bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), creatinine, troponin, procalcitonin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and D-dimer. By contrast, platelet count, lymphocyte count, and albumin levels were decreased in patients with a severe form of COVID-19. Also, patients with a severe phenotype of disease were more likely to have diabetes, chronic heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cerebrovascular disease, hypertension, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and malignancy. Compared to patients who survived, patients who died had higher WBC, PMN, total bilirubin, ALT, procalcitonin, IL-6, creatinine, PT, lymphocyte count, platelet count, and albumin. Also, non-survivors revealed a higher prevalence of diabetes, chronic heart disease, COPD, cerebrovascular disease, and CKD. Meta-analyses identified several laboratory parameters that might help the prediction of severe, critical, and lethal phenotypes of COVID-19.

The association of the virus spread from the market is supported by the close relation of genome sequences of environmental surface samples with virus samples from earliest patients by phylogenetic analysis. Objectives: To have an insight into the SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences reported from India for better understanding on their epidemiology and virulence. Methods: Genome sequences of Indian isolates of SARS-CoV-2 were analyzed to understand their phylogeny and divergence with respect to other isolates reported from other countries. Amino acid sequences of individual open reading frames (ORFs) from SARS-CoV-2 Indian isolates were aligned with sequences of isolates reported from other countries to identify the mutations occurred in Indian isolates. Results: Our analysis suggests that Indian SARS-CoV-2 isolates are closely related to isolates reported from other parts of the world. Most ORFs are highly conserved; mutations were also detected in some ORFs. We found that most isolates reported from India have key mutations at 614th position of the S protein and 84th position of the ORF 8, which has been reported to be associated with high virulence and high transmission rate. Conclusion: An attempt was made to understand the SARS-CoV-2 virus reported from India. SARS-CoV-2 reported from India was closely similar to other SARS-CoV-2 reported from other parts of the world, which suggests that vaccines and other therapeutic methods generated from other countries might work well in India. In addition, available sequence data suggest that majority of Indian isolates are capable of high transmission and virulence.","Devendran, Ragunathan; Kumar, Manish; Chakraborty, Supriya",Indian J Public Health,107,8

The person-to-person transmission of SARS-Cov-2 when in close contact is facilitated by respiratory droplets containing the virus particles, and by skin contact with contaminated surfaces. However, the large number of COVID-19 infections cannot be explained only by droplet deposition or contact contamination. It seems very plausible that aerosols are important in transmitting SARS-Cov-2. It has been demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 remains viable in aerosols for hours, facilitating rapid distribution of the virus over great distances. Aerosols may, therefore, also be responsible for so-called super-spreader events. Indirect evidence points to a correlation between ventilation and the transmission and spread of SARS-Cov-2, supporting ventilation as an important factor in preventing airborne transmission. Further actions to avoid transmission of COVID-19 include social distancing, hygiene measures, and barrier measures, such as face-coverings. Professional masks offer better protection than cloth masks. These protection measures are especially relevant to health care workers, when performing endotracheal intubation, but the risk from non-invasive ventilation and nebulizing treatment seems to be moderate.","van der Valk, Johanna P M; 039, In; t Veen, Johannes C C M",J Occup Environ Med,107,29

It remains unclear whether seasonal changes in ambient temperature will alter spreading trajectory of the COVID-19 epidemic. The probable mechanism on this is still lacking. This review summarizes the most recent research data on the effect of ambient temperature on the COVID-19 epidemic characteristic. The available data suggest that (i) mesophilic traits of viruses are different due to their molecular composition; (ii) increasing ambient temperature decreases the persistence of some viruses in aquatic media; (iii) a 1°C increase in the average monthly minimum ambient temperatures (AMMAT) was related to a 0.72% fewer mammalian individuals that would be infected by coronavirus; (iv) proportion of zoonotic viruses of mammals including humans is probably related to their body temperature difference; (v) seasonal divergence between the northern and southern hemispheres may be a significant driver in determining a waved trajectory in the next 2 years.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cross-sectional study in a convenience sample of professionals from 30 health centers and 30 nursing homes from the primary care management division of the Healthcare Area of Leon. The work center, type of profession, COVID-19 infection, level of exposure, compliance with preventive measures, isolation (if required) and diagnostic tests carried out were collected. The determination of infection was made by differentiated rapid diagnostic test (dRDT), using a finger-stick whole-blood sample. The association of variables with infection was assessed by multivariable non-conditional logistic regression. The true prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was calculated according to two scenarios for RDT (Sensitivity=0.6 and Specificity=0.985; Sensitivity=0.8 and Specificity=1). RESULTS: The true prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was between 4.9% and 11.0%. The observed prevalence was 5.9% and was higher in nursing homes than in primary care centers (9.5% vs. 5.5%). No statistically significant differences were observed by sex, type of professional, level of exposure or compliance with preventive measures. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in this group is low. A high number of professionals remain susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and therefore protective measures should be taken, especially for professionals working in nursing homes.","Martín, V; Fernández-Villa, T; Lamuedra Gil de Gomez, M; Mencía-Ares, O; Rivero Rodríguez, A; Reguero Celada, S; Montoro Gómez, M; Nuevo Guisado, M T; Villa Aller, C; Díez Flecha, C; Carvajal, A; Fernández Vázquez, J P",Semergen,107,32

We provide a comprehensive look at COVID-19 epidemiology across the state of Georgia, which includes vast rural communities that may be disproportionately impacted by the spread of this infectious disease. Methods: All 159 Georgia counties were included in this study. We examined the geographic variation of COVID-19 in Georgia from March 3 through April 24, 2020 by extracting data on incidence and mortality from various national and state datasets. We contrasted county-level mortality rates per 100,000 population (MRs) by county-level factors. Results: Metropolitan Atlanta had the overall highest number of confirmed cases; however, the southwestern rural parts of Georgia, surrounding the city of Albany, had the highest bi-weekly increases in incidence rate. Among counties with >10 cases, MRs were highest in the rural counties of Randolph (233.2), Terrell (182.5), Early (136.3), and Dougherty (114.2). Counties with the highest MRs (22.5-2332 per 100,000) had a higher proportion of: non-Hispanic Blacks residents, adults aged 60+, adults earning <$20,000 annually, and residents living in rural communities when compared with counties with lower MRs. These counties also had a lower proportion of the population with a college education, lower number of ICU beds per 100,000 population, and lower number of primary care physicians per 10,000 population. Conclusions: While urban centers in Georgia account for the bulk of COVID-19 cases, high mortality rates and low critical care capacity in rural Georgia are also of critical concern.","Moore, Justin Xavier; Langston, Marvin E; George, Varghese; Coughlin, Steven S",,107,24

In this study we use longitudinal high-throughput T cell receptor sequencing to track changes in the T cell repertoire following two mild cases of COVID-19 infection. In both donors we identified SARS-CoV-2-responding CD4+ and CD8+ T cell clones. We describe characteristic motifs in TCR sequences of COVID-19-reactive clones, suggesting the existence of immunodominant epitopes.

This study aimed to estimate the monthly incidence of MERS-CoV cases and to investigate their correlation to climate factors. Methods: The study used aggregated monthly MERS-CoV cases that reported to the Saudi Center for Disease Prevention and Control from the Riyadh Region between November 1, 2012 and December 31, 2018. Data on the meteorological situation throughout the study period was calculated based on Google reports on the Riyadh Region (24.7136 °N, 46.6753 °E). The Poisson regression was used to estimate the incidence rate ratio (IRR) and its 95% confidence intervals (CI) for each climate factor. Results: A total of 712 MERS-CoV cases were included in the analysis (mean age 54.2 ± 9.9 years), and more than half (404) (56.1%) MERS-CoV cases were diagnosed during a five-month period from April to August. The highest peak timing positioned in August 2015, followed by April 2014, June 2017, March 2015, and June 2016. High temperatures (IRR = 1.054, 95% CI: 1.043–1.065) and a high ultraviolet index (IRR = 1.401, 95% CI: 1.331–1.475) were correlated with a higher incidence of MERS-CoV cases. However, low relative humidity (IRR = 0.956, 95% CI: 0.948–0.964) and low wind speed (IRR = 0.945, 95% CI: 0.912–0.979) were correlated with a lower incidence of MERS-CoV cases. Conclusion: The novel coronavirus, MERS-CoV, is influenced by climate conditions with increasing incidence between April and August. High temperature, high ultraviolet index, low wind speed, and low relative humidity are contributors to increased MERS-CoV cases. The climate factors must be evaluated in hospitals and community settings and integrated into guidelines to serve as source of control measures to prevent and eliminate the risk of infection.","Altamimi, Asmaa; Ahmed, Anwar E.",J.

CXCR3 deletion in mice improves survival, diminishes neurological deficits, and limits neuronal damage without suppressing fungal clearance. CD4+ T cell accumulation and TH1 skewing are reduced in the CNS but not spleens of infected CXCR3-/- mice. Adoptive transfer of WT, but not CXCR3-/- CD4+ T cells, into CXCR3-/- mice phenocopies the pathology of infected WT mice.

DESIGN AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted from May 25, 2020 to June 25, 2020 in a city located in the northwest of Turkey. The data were collected using a personal information form, the Beck Anxiety Scale, administered in face-to-face interviews, and online questionnaires. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Kruskal-Wallis, Mann-Whitney U, and logistic regression analyses. FINDINGS: The anxiety level of individuals under quarantine (Median: min-max = 1: 0-55) was significantly lower statistically compared to that of the rest of the society (Median: min-max = 6: 0-63) and hospitalized COVID-19 patients (Median: min-max = 5: 0-42) (p = 0.0001). Female gender, being 61 years of age and older, having psychiatric and chronic illnesses, and experiencing disrupted sleep patterns were determined to be the factors associated with high levels of anxiety. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: This study found that society in general and hospitalized COVID-19 patients had high anxiety levels. The study results can be useful for creating training and population-based screening programs to control the anxiety of individuals under quarantine, hospitalized COVID-19 patients, and the rest of the society during the pandemic.

Due to its highly contagious nature, it has spread rapidly, resulting in major disruption to public health. In addition, it has also had a severe negative impact on the world economy. As a result, it is widely recognized now that widespread testing is key to containing the spread of the disease and opening up the economy. However, the current testing regime has been unable to keep up with testing demands. Hence, there is a need for an alternative approach for repeated large-scale testing of COVID-19. The emergence of wearable medical sensors (WMSs) and novel machine learning methods, such as deep neural networks (DNNs), points to a promising approach to address this challenge. WMSs enable continuous and user-transparent monitoring of the physiological signals. However, disease detection based on WMSs/DNNs and their deployment on resource-constrained edge devices remain challenging problems. In this work, we propose CovidDeep, a framework that combines efficient DNNs with commercially available WMSs for pervasive testing of the coronavirus. We collected data from 87 individuals, spanning four cohorts including healthy, asymptomatic (but SARS-CoV-2-positive) as well as moderately and severely symptomatic COVID-19 patients. We trained DNNs on various subsets of the features extracted from six WMS and questionnaire categories to perform ablation studies to determine which subsets are most efficacious in terms of test accuracy for a four-way classification. The highest test accuracy obtained was 99.6%. Since different WMS subsets may be more accessible (in terms of cost, availability, etc.) to different sets of people, we hope these DNN models will provide users with ample flexibility. The resultant DNNs can be easily deployed on edge devices, e.g., smartwatch or smartphone, which also has the benefit of preserving patient privacy.","Hassantabar, Shayan; Stefano, Novati; Ghanakota, Vishweshwar; Ferrari, Alessandra; Nicola, Gregory N.; Bruno, Raffaele; Marino, Ignazio R.; Jha, Niraj K.",,107,16

There have been several reports of infrequent post vaccine associated thrombotic events, in particular for adenovirus-based vaccines. These have variously been termed VIPIT (vaccine-induced prothrombotic immune thrombocytopenia), VITT (vaccine-induced [immune] thrombotic thrombocytopenia), VATT (vaccine-associated [immune] thrombotic thrombocytopenia), and TTS (thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome). In this report, the laboratory test processes, as utilised to assess suspected VITT, are reviewed. In published reports to date, there are notable similarities and divergences in testing approaches, potentially leading to identification of slightly disparate patient cohorts. The key to appropriate identification/exclusion of VITT, and potential differentiation from heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis (HITT), is identification of potentially differential test patterns. In summary, testing typically comprises platelet counts, D-dimer, fibrinogen, and various immunological and functional assays for platelet factor 4 (PF4) antibodies. In suspected VITT, there is a generally highly elevated level of D-dimer, thrombocytopenia, and PF4 antibodies can be identified by ELISA-based assays, but not by other immunological assays typically positive in HITT. In addition, in some functional platelet activation assays, standard doses of heparin have been identified to inhibit activation in suspected VITT, but they tend to augment activation in HITT. Conversely, it is also important to not over-diagnose VITT, given that not all cases of thrombosis post vaccination will have an immune basis and not all PF4-ELISA positive patients will be VITT.","Favaloro, Emmanuel J",Int J Lab Hematol,107,30

So far, clinical applications have focused on diagnosis and on prediction of outcomes. It is less clear in what way AI can or should support complex clinical decisions that crucially depend on patient preferences. In this paper, we focus on the ethical questions arising from the design, development and deployment of AI systems to support decision-making around cardiopulmonary resuscitation and the determination of a patient's Do Not Attempt to Resuscitate status (also known as code status). The COVID-19 pandemic has made us keenly aware of the difficulties physicians encounter when they have to act quickly in stressful situations without knowing what their patient would have wanted. We discuss the results of an interview study conducted with healthcare professionals in a university hospital aimed at understanding the status quo of resuscitation decision processes while exploring a potential role for AI systems in decision-making around code status. Our data suggest that (1) current practices are fraught with challenges such as insufficient knowledge regarding patient preferences, time pressure and personal bias guiding care considerations and (2) there is considerable openness among clinicians to consider the use of AI-based decision support. We suggest a model for how AI can contribute to improve decision-making around resuscitation and propose a set of ethically relevant preconditions-conceptual, methodological and procedural-that need to be considered in further development and implementation efforts.","Biller-Andorno, Nikola; Ferrario, Andrea; Joebges, Susanne; Krones, Tanja; Massini, Federico; Barth, Phyllis; Arampatzis, Georgios; Krauthammer, Michael",J. med. ethics,107,10

We reviewed our database for all oncological molecular tests requested between March and April of 2019 and 2020. For each case, we recorded age, sex, region of the country, requesting institution, sample type, testing method, and turnaround time (TAT). A comparison between years was made. Results: The total number of tests decreased from 421 in 2019 to 319 in 2020 (p = 0.0027). The greatest reduction was in clinical trial-related cases. Routine cases were similar between years (267 vs. 256). TAT was higher in 2019 (mean 15 days vs. 12.3 days; p = 0.0003). Medium- to large-sized public hospitals in the north of the country were mostly responsible for the reduction in cases (p = 0.0153). Conclusions: Case reduction was observed at hospitals that have mostly been involved in the treatment of COVID-19 and in the north of the country, the region worst-hit by the pandemic. Similar to other studies, our TAT decreased, even with a similar number of routine cases.

In COVID-19, some preliminary results have shown that PCT testing could act as a predictor of bacterial co-infection and be a useful marker for assessment of disease severity. Methods: We studied 83 COVID-19 hospitalized patients in whom PCT was specifically ordered by attending physicians. PCT results were evaluated according to the ability to accurately predict bacterial co-infections and death in comparison with other known biomarkers of infection and with major laboratory predictors of COVID-19 severity. Results: Thirty-three (39.8%) patients suffered an in-hospital bacterial co-infection and 44 (53.0%) patients died. In predicting bacterial co-infection, PCT showed a relatively low accuracy (area under receiver-operating characteristic [ROC] curve [AUC]: 0.757; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.651-0.845), with a strength for detecting the outcome not significantly different from that of white blood cell count and C-reactive protein (CRP). In predicting patient death, PCT showed an AUC of 0.815 (CI: 0.714-0.892), not better than those of other more common laboratory tests, such as blood lymphocyte percentage (AUC: 0.874, p=0.19), serum lactate dehydrogenase (AUC: 0.860, p=0.47), blood neutrophil count (AUC: 0.845, p=0.59), and serum albumin (AUC: 0.839, p=0.73). Conclusions: Procalcitonin (PCT) testing, even when appropriately ordered, did not provide a significant added value in COVID-19 patients when compared with more consolidated biomarkers of infection and poor clinical outcome. The major application of PCT in COVID-19 is its ability, associated with a negative predictive value >90%, to exclude a bacterial co-infection when a rule-out cut-off (<0.25 µg/L) is applied.","Dolci, Alberto; Robbiano, Cristina; Aloisio, Elena; Chibireva, Mariia; Serafini, Ludovica; Falvella, Felicia Stefania; Pasqualetti, Sara; Panteghini, Mauro",Clin Chem Lab Med,107,1

Despite surveillance programs, 70% of HCC patients are not suitable for curative options at diagnosis, and therefore, non-curative treatments are essential to modern clinical practice. There are many novel treatments, though their roles are not well defined. This study aimed to contrast Selective Internal Radiation Therapy (SIRT) and Drug Eluting Bead Transarterial Chemoembolisation (DEB-TACE) to further define their roles. METHODS: This was a retrospective multicentre cohort study. Factors included for analysis were type of HCC treatment, number of lesions, lesion size, multiple disease severity scores, cirrhosis and vascular invasion. The primary endpoint was transplant-free survival. RESULTS: Transplant-free survival was similar between the two cohorts (p = 0.654), despite a variation in median lesion size, SIRT: 54.5 mm, DEB-TACE: 34 mm (p &#8804; 0.001). A univariate Cox proportional hazard model utilising treatment modality as the covariate showed no significant difference in survival (DEB-TACE HR 1.4 (95%CI 0.85-2.15 p = 0.207). The size of the largest lesion was the best predictor of 3-year survival (p = 0.035). Lesion size was inversely associated with survival (HR 1.01 (95%CI 1-1.02, p = 0.025)) on multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION: This study is the first to catalogue the experience of using SIRT in HCC in a real-world Australian population. It has demonstrated no difference in survival outcomes between DEB-TACE and SIRT. Further, it has shown SIRT to be a reasonable alternative to DEB-TACE especially in larger lesions and has demonstrated that DEB-TACE has a role in select patients with advanced disease.","Hirsch, Ryan D; Mills, Chris; Sawhney, Rohit; Sood, Siddharth; Bird, Virginia; Mishra, Gauri; Dev, Anouk; Kemp, William; Lubel, John; Roberts, Stuart K; Gow, Paul; Nicoll, Amanda J",,107,5

METHODS: Data collection forms were sent online to nursing students of three different state or foundation universities in Turkey. In all, 456 individuals who answered the data collection forms were included in the study. FINDINGS: Study results revealed that the total average score for the ""Attitude Scale for Nursing Profession"" was 162 ± 15.6. The Professional characteristics subdimension score average was 80.64 ± 7.02. Furthermore, the state of choosing nursing profession subdimension score average was 50.05 ± 9.23, whereas the Attitude for the general status of nursing profession subdimension score average was 34.38 ± 2.97. Due to the pandemic, anxiety levels for the nursing profession were 4.86 ± 2.76 (between 0 and 10). It was determined that nursing students who studied in cities where the virus was very common had a more positive attitude toward the profession. Anxiety levels of nursing students studying in cities where the virus impact was moderate and in cities where the virus presence was quite common were higher (p > 0.05). PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: It was found that nursing students had a positive and high-level attitude toward the nursing profession.

The basis of suspicion was clinico-eco-epidemiologic-radiological findings as, by that time, about 20 COVID19 cases were reported from the state of Rajasthan including a big Italian group of tourists who travelled extensively in Rajasthan, including Udaipur city. Objectives: The current study presents the field experience of the Central and the State Rapid Response Teams (RRTs) in the cluster containment at Bhilwara. Methods: The information regarding the sociodemographic profile of the cases was provided by the Senior Medical Officer In-charge. The containment strategy was modeled under 6 pillars. Google Maps was used for preparing spot map. Results: Immediate public health actions of cluster containment including contact tracing, quarantine, and isolation were initiated using epidemiological approach of mapping the cluster and taking care of reservoir of infection by the District Public Health Team supported by Multidisciplinary Rapid Response Team. This was supplemented by strict enforcement of lock down in the District taking care of daily need of the community by the leadership of administration with very strong intersectoral co-ordination (locally called ""ruthless containment""). Conclusion: The forthcoming challenge resides in re-establishment of inter-district and inter-state travel, which can become a risk of re-entry of the new cases, which needs to be taken care of, with the help of stringent administrative measures and screening at all points of entry. The team in Bhilwara needs to remain vigilant to pick up any imported cases early before local transmission establishes.","Meghwal, Badrilal; Behera, Shyambhavee; Dhariwal, Akshay C; Saxena, Deepak; Singh, Rommel; Kumar, Sanjiv",Indian J Public Health,107,10

While many medical schools canceled laboratory teaching sessions in the anatomical sciences, a minority maintained laboratory teaching, including ours. Due to the pandemic, students had far fewer opportunities to interact with their peers and faculty, and students may have experienced greater non-academic stress, all of which would be expected to negatively impact student academic performance. Also, some faculty members feel that virtual vs. in-person lectures hinder student learning. Taken together, these issues led to significant concern about lower academic performance by first-year medical students in 2020. Our curriculum changed very little between 2019 and 2020, presenting the opportunity to assess the impact of online lectures while keeping the laboratory component essentially unchanged. We hypothesized that maintaining laboratory-based teaching minimized the negative effects of online lectures and student stress in 2020. Methods Academic performance in the anatomical sciences between 2019 (98 students) and 2020 (143 students) was compared using scores from five written and five laboratory exams from Medical Gross Anatomy (MGA) and four histology laboratory exams from the Foundations of Medicine I course (FOM-I). In addition, course evaluation data for the two courses between 2019 and 2020 was compared. Results The exam scores between 2019 and 2020 differed significantly overall (one-way PERMANOVA for non-parametric data, p = 0.003, 9999 permutations). In pairwise comparisons of specific exams between the two years, students in 2020 performed significantly better on one gross anatomy written exam, one gross anatomy laboratory exam, and one histology laboratory exam, whereas 2019 students performed significantly better on one histology laboratory exam (Mann-Whitney U tests, dfs = 239, p-values = 0.02 or less). The mean scores from student course evaluations for both MGA and FOM-I were slightly higher in 2020 compared to 2019, although the differences were not statistically significant (Independent Sample t-tests, dfs = 213, p = 0.23, 0.13, respectively). Discussion These results indicate that the change to all-online lectures with standard in-person laboratory sessions in 2020 did not harm student academic performance in the anatomical sciences. The one lower exam score in histology in 2020 may be due to two additional topics being included on that exam in 2020. If the likely extra-academic stressors that some students may have experienced due to the pandemic (whether from social isolation or direct impact of the disease on family, friends, or themselves) are factored in, the similarity in academic performance in 2019 and 2020 suggests that online lectures paired with in-person laboratory learning may in fact be beneficial for student academic performance, although this would need further investigation. This study will enable comparisons with medical schools that had entirely virtual courses, with either virtual or no laboratory sessions.

Online multilingual survey consisting of 23 items, between 17 May -15 July of 2019 targeting the opinions and practices of ICTs regarding the 2018-2019 influenza season was employed. Participants were reached via European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) and European Union Certificate for Infection Control (EUCIC) newsletters,social media, and national societies. In total, 899 participants from 56 countries responded to the survey. The overall vaccination rate was 76%, being the highest in Finland, Portugal, Norway, and Israel (100%), whereas the lowest in Italy (68%) and Turkey (39%). Influenza vaccination rate was 86% among IC physicians and 52% among IC nurses. The most significant factors affecting participants' decision were personal influenza vaccine experience (49%) and attitude of the scientific authorities (48%). In multivariate analysis, vaccination of the ICT head (OR: 16.04, 95%CI: 8.4-30.8, p < 0.001) and having free vaccine (OR: 7.56, 95%CI: 2.1-27.4, p = 0.02) were found to be the strongest predictors for influenza vaccination, whereas working in Turkey (OR: 0.41, 95%CI: 0.22-0.77, p = 0.006) and being an IC nurse (OR:0.43, 95%CI: 0.24-0.80, p = 0.007) were significantly associated with not having been vaccinated. In conclusion, COVID-19 pandemic increased the importance of protection against respiratory viruses including influenza. Vaccination strategies should have a special emphasis on IC nurses, who have a relatively lower vaccination rate, should enhance the vaccination of the ICT leaders, and put effort to provide free availability of the influenza vaccine.","Keske, Siran; Mutters, Nico T; Tsioutis, Constantinos; Ergönül, Önder",Vaccine,107,29

The goal of this ecological cross-sectional study is to examine the demographic and economic nature of spatial hot and cold spots of SARS-CoV-2 rates in New York City and Chicago as of April 13, 2020 using data from the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, Illinois Department of Public Health, and the American Community Survey. In both cities, cold spots (clusters of low SARS-CoV-2 rate ZIP code tabulation areas as identified by the Getis-Ord (GI*) statistic) demonstrated social determinants of health characteristics typically associated with better health outcomes and the ability to maintain physical distance (""social distancing""). These neighborhoods tended to be wealthier, have higher educational attainment, higher proportions of non-Hispanic white residents, and more workers in managerial occupations (all p values < 0.01 using Wilcoxon two-sample test). Hot spots (clusters of high SARS-CoV-2 rate ZIP code tabulation areas) had similarities as well, such as lower rates of college graduates and higher proportions of people of color. It also appears that household size (more people per household), rather than overall population density (people per square mile), is more strongly associated with hot spots. New York City had an average of 3.0 people per household in hot spots and 2.1 in cold spots (p < 0.01), and Chicago had 2.8 people per household in hot spots and 2.0 in cold spots (p = 0.03). However, hotspots were located in neighborhoods that were significantly less dense (New York City: 22,900 people per square mile in hot spots and 68,900 in cold spots (p < 0.01); Chicago: 10,000 people per square mile in hot spots and 23,400 in cold spots (p = 0.03)). Findings suggest important differences between the cities' hot spots as well. NYC hot spots can be described as working-class and middle-income communities, perhaps indicative of greater concentrations of service workers and other occupations (including those classified as ""essential services"" during the pandemic) that may not require a college degree but pay wages above poverty levels. Chicago's hot spot neighborhoods, on the other hand, are among the city's most vulnerable, low-income neighborhoods with extremely high rates of poverty, unemployment, and non-Hispanic Black residents.","Maroko, Andrew R; Nash, Denis; Pavilonis, Brian T",J Urban Health,107,22

This study investigated the impact of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) on the risk for respiratory failure and mortality in COVID-19 patients. A nationwide retrospective cohort study was conducted in 4610 patients (&#8805; 40 years old) infected with COVID-19 between January 20 and May 27, 2020, using data from the Ministry of Health and Welfare and Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service in Korea. The clinical course and various clinical features were compared between COPD and non-COPD patients, and the risks of respiratory failure and all-cause mortality in COPD patients were analyzed using a multivariate logistic regression model. Among 4610 COVID-19 patients, 4469 (96.9%) and 141 (3.1%) were categorized into the non-COPD and COPD groups, respectively. The COPD group had greater proportions of older (&#8805; 60 years old) (78.0% vs. 45.2%, P < 0.001) and male (52.5% vs. 36.6%, P < 0.001) patients than the non-COPD group. Relatively greater proportions of patients with COPD received intensive critical care (7.1% vs. 3.7%, P = 0.041) and mechanical ventilation (5.7% vs. 2.4%, P = 0.015). Multivariate analyses showed that COPD was not a risk factor for respiratory failure but was a significant independent risk factor for all-cause mortality (OR = 1.80, 95% CI 1.11-2.93) after adjustment for age, sex, and Charlson Comorbidity Index score. Among COVID-19 patients, relatively greater proportions of patients with COPD received mechanical ventilation and intensive critical care. COPD is an independent risk factor for all-cause mortality in COVID-19 patients in Korea.","Lee, Sang Chul; Son, Kang Ju; Han, Chang Hoon; Park, Seon Cheol; Jung, Ji Ye",Sci Rep,107,13

The first known cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Zambia occurred in a married couple who had traveled to France and were subject to port-of-entry surveillance and subsequent remote monitoring of travelers with a history of international travel for 14 days after arrival. They were identified as having suspected cases on March 18, 2020, and tested for COVID-19 after developing respiratory symptoms during the 14-day monitoring period. In March 2020, the Zambia National Public Health Institute (ZNPHI) defined a suspected case of COVID-19 as 1) an acute respiratory illness in a person with a history of international travel during the 14 days preceding symptom onset; or 2) acute respiratory illness in a person with a history of contact with a person with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in the 14 days preceding symptom onset; or 3) severe acute respiratory illness requiring hospitalization; or 4) being a household or close contact of a patient with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. This definition was adapted from World Health Organization (WHO) interim guidance issued March 20, 2020, on global surveillance for COVID-19 (2) to also include asymptomatic contacts of persons with confirmed COVID-19. Persons with suspected COVID-19 were identified through various mechanisms, including port-of-entry surveillance, contact tracing, health care worker (HCW) testing, facility-based inpatient screening, community-based screening, and calls from the public into a national hotline administered by the Disaster Management and Mitigation Unit and ZNPHI. Port-of-entry surveillance included an arrival screen consisting of a temperature scan, report of symptoms during the preceding 14 days, and collection of a history of travel and contact with persons with confirmed COVID-19 in the 14 days before arrival in Zambia, followed by daily remote telephone monitoring for 14 days. Travelers were tested for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, if they were symptomatic upon arrival or developed symptoms during the 14-day monitoring period. Persons with suspected COVID-19 were tested as soon as possible after evaluation for respiratory symptoms or within 7 days of last known exposure (i.e., travel or contact with a confirmed case). All COVID-19 diagnoses were confirmed using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing (SARS-CoV-2 Nucleic Acid Detection Kit, Maccura) of nasopharyngeal specimens; all patients with confirmed COVID-19 were admitted into institutional isolation at the time of laboratory confirmation, which was generally within 36 hours. COVID-19 patients were deemed recovered and released from isolation after two consecutive PCR-negative test results &#8805;24 hours apart. A Ministry of Health memorandum was released on April 13, 2020, mandating testing in public facilities of 1) all persons admitted to medical and pediatric wards regardless of symptoms; 2) all patients being admitted to surgical and obstetric wards, regardless of symptoms; 3) any outpatient with fever, cough, or shortness of breath; and 4) any facility or community death in a person with respiratory symptoms, and 5) biweekly screening of all HCWs in isolation centers and health facilities where persons with COVID-19 had been evaluated.

However, AIS has not been described as a late sequelae in patients without respiratory symptoms of COVID-19. Objective: To assess AIS experienced by adults 50 years or younger in the convalescent phase of asymptomatic COVID-19 infection. Design, Setting, and Participants: This case series prospectively identified consecutive male patients who received care for AIS from public health hospitals in Singapore between May 21, 2020, and October 14, 2020. All of these patients had laboratory-confirmed asymptomatic COVID-19 infection based on a positive SARS-CoV-2 serological (antibodies) test result. These patients were individuals from South Asian countries (India and Bangladesh) who were working in Singapore and living in dormitories. The total number of COVID-19 cases (54 485) in the worker dormitory population was the population at risk. Patients with ongoing respiratory symptoms or positive SARS-CoV-2 serological test results confirmed through reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction nasopharyngeal swabs were excluded. Main Outcomes and Measures: Clinical course, imaging, and laboratory findings were retrieved from the electronic medical records of each participating hospital. The incidence rate of AIS in the case series was compared with that of a historical age-, sex-, and ethnicity-matched national cohort. Results: A total of 18 male patients, with a median (range) age of 41 (35-50) years and South Asian ethnicity, were included. The median (range) time from a positive serological test result to AIS was 54.5 (0-130) days. The median (range) National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was 5 (1-25). Ten patients (56%) presented with a large vessel occlusion, of whom 6 patients underwent intravenous thrombolysis and/or endovascular therapy. Only 3 patients (17%) had a possible cardiac source of embolus. The estimated annual incidence rate of AIS was 82.6 cases per 100â¯000 people in this study compared with 38.2 cases per 100â¯000 people in the historical age-, sex-, and ethnicity-matched cohort (rate ratio, 2.16; 95% CI, 1.36-3.48; P < .001). Conclusions and Relevance: This case series suggests that the risk for AIS is higher in adults 50 years or younger during the convalescent period of a COVID-19 infection without respiratory symptoms. Acute ischemic stroke could be part of the next wave of complications of COVID-19, and stroke units should be on alert and use serological testing, especially in younger patients or in the absence of traditional risk factors.","Tu, Tian Ming; Seet, Christopher Ying Hao; Koh, Jasmine Shimin; Tham, Carol Huilian; Chiew, Hui Jin; De Leon, Jasmyn Angon; Chua, Christopher Yuan Kit; Hui, Andrew Che-Fai; Tan, Shaun Shi Yan; Vasoo, Shawn Sushilan; Tan, Benjamin Yong-Qiang; Umapathi, N Thirugnanam; Tambyah, Paul Anantharajah; Yeo, Leonard Leong Litt",JAMA Netw Open,107,22

The objectives of this work were to assess the incidence of initially normal chest CT in a cohort of consecutive confirmed COVID-19 patients with respiratory symptoms and to compare their clinical characteristics and their outcome to matched patients with typical COVID-19 lesions at initial CT. METHODS: From March 6th to April 22nd, all consecutive adult patients referred to the COVID-19 clinic of our Emergency Department were retrospectively analyzed. Each patient with a positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and a normal initial chest CT after second reading was 1:1 matched based on sex, age and date of CT acquisition to a patient with positive RT-PCR and initial chest CT with typical COVID-19 lesions. Clinical data, laboratory results and outcomes (major being mechanical ventilation and/or death) were compared between both groups, using Wilcoxon signed-rank test, McNemar's chi-squared test and/or exact McNemar's test where appropriate. RESULTS: Fifty-seven chest CT out of 1091 (5.2%, 95% CI 4.0-6.7) in symptomatic patients with positive RT-PCR were normal, with a median onset of symptoms of 4.5 days (IQR [1.25-10.25]). After a median follow-up of 43 days, death and/or mechanical ventilation occurred in 3 patients (5.3%) in the study group, versus 11 (19.3%) in the control group (p = 0.011). CONCLUSIONS: Normal initial chest CT occurred in 5.2% of symptomatic confirmed COVID-19 cases in our cohort. While better than those with abnormal chest CT, outcome was not entirely benign with 5.3% death and/or mechanical ventilation. KEY POINTS: â¢ In a cohort of 1091 symptomatic COVID-19 patients, initial chest CT was normal in 5.2% of cases. â¢ Normal chest CT in confirmed COVID-19 is frequent even when onset of symptoms is greater than 3 days. â¢ The outcome of COVID-19 patients with initial normal chest CT, while better than those with abnormal CT, was not entirely benign with 5.3% death and/or mechanical ventilation.","Leonard-Lorant, Ian; Severac, François; Bilbault, Pascal; Muller, Joris; Leyendecker, Pierre; Roy, Catherine; Ohana, Mickaël",Eur. radiol,107,16

This has led to substantial interest in their ""test, trace, isolate"" strategy. However, it is important to understand the epidemiological peculiarities of South Korea's outbreak and characterise their response before attempting to emulate these measures elsewhere. METHODS: We systematically extracted numbers of suspected cases tested, PCR-confirmed cases, deaths, isolated confirmed cases, and numbers of confirmed cases with an identified epidemiological link from publicly available data. We estimated the time-varying reproduction number, Rt, using an established Bayesian framework, and reviewed the package of interventions implemented by South Korea using our extracted data, plus published literature and government sources. RESULTS: We estimated that after the initial rapid growth in cases, Rt dropped below one in early April before increasing to a maximum of 1.94 (95%CrI, 1.64-2.27) in May following outbreaks in Seoul Metropolitan Region. By mid-June, Rt was back below one where it remained until the end of our study (July 13th). Despite less stringent ""lockdown"" measures, strong social distancing measures were implemented in high-incidence areas and studies measured a considerable national decrease in movement in late February. Testing the capacity was swiftly increased, and protocols were in place to isolate suspected and confirmed cases quickly; however, we could not estimate the delay to isolation using our data. Accounting for just 10% of cases, individual case-based contact tracing picked up a relatively minor proportion of total cases, with cluster investigations accounting for 66%. CONCLUSIONS: Whilst early adoption of testing and contact tracing is likely to be important for South Korea's successful outbreak control, other factors including regional implementation of strong social distancing measures likely also contributed. The high volume of testing and the low number of deaths suggest that South Korea experienced a small epidemic relative to other countries. Caution is needed in attempting to replicate the South Korean response in populations with larger more geographically widespread epidemics where finding, testing, and isolating cases that are linked to clusters may be more difficult.","Dighe, Amy; Cattarino, Lorenzo; Cuomo-Dannenburg, Gina; Skarp, Janetta; Imai, Natsuko; Bhatia, Sangeeta; Gaythorpe, Katy A M; Ainslie, Kylie E C; Baguelin, Marc; Bhatt, Samir; Boonyasiri, Adhiratha; Brazeau, Nicholas F; Cooper, Laura V; Coupland, Helen; Cucunuba, Zulma; Dorigatti, Ilaria; Eales, Oliver D; van Elsland, Sabine L; FitzJohn, Richard G; Green, William D; Haw, David J; Hinsley, Wes; Knock, Edward; Laydon, Daniel J; Mellan, Thomas; Mishra, Swapnil; Nedjati-Gilani, Gemma; Nouvellet, Pierre; Pons-Salort, Margarita; Thompson, Hayley A; Unwin, H Juliette T; Verity, Robert; Vollmer, Michaela A C; Walters, Caroline E; Watson, Oliver J; Whittaker, Charles; Whittles, Lilith K; Ghani, Azra C; Donnelly, Christl A; Ferguson, Neil M; Riley, Steven",BMC Med,107,23

We show that on average, the image regions with the proposed causal features require 15% less bits when encoded using Huffman encoding, compared to Grad-CAM, for an average increase of 3% classification accuracy, over Grad-CAM. Moreover, we validate the transfer-ability of causal features between networks and comment on the non-human interpretable causal nature of current networks.","Prabhushankar, Mohit; AlRegib, Ghassan",,107,16

The aim of this study was to examine unguided low intensity cognitive behaviour therapy for anxiety and depression during the pandemic. A sample of 225 individuals in Australia and the United Kingdom (M age 37.79, SD = 14.02, range 18-80 years; 85% female) were randomised into intervention or waitlist control. The intervention group demonstrated significant decreases in anxiety (d = 0.36 [0.18, 0.54]) and depression (d = 0.28 [0.11, 0.45]) compared to controls. The majority of participants (96%) rated the intervention as useful, and most (83%) reported they spent 30 min or less reading the guide, with 83% agreeing the intervention was easy to read. The results indicate that low intensity cognitive behaviour therapy has efficacy in reducing anxiety and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic. There is an urgent need to disseminate low intensity psychological therapies to improve mental health in this challenging time.","Egan, Sarah J; McEvoy, Peter; Wade, Tracey D; Ure, Sarah; Johnson, Andrew R; Gill, Christopher; Greene, Danyelle; Wilker, Lienke; Anderson, Rebecca; Mazzucchelli, Trevor G; Brown, Samantha; Shafran, Roz",Behav Res Ther,107,22

Our results indicate that the penetration distance was comparable between loud intensity speech (for example during singing, classroom lectures, parties etc.) and moderate intensity cough. Based on theoretical aerosol propagation distance and time, the 6 feet physical distancing recommendations are likely sufficient to avoid incidental exposure by the initial penetration of the aerosol cloud, but insufficient for prolonged exposure to slow propagating aerosol clouds.","Raghav, Vrishank; Tan, Zu Puayen; Bhatt, Surya P.",,107,26

COVID-19 has its origin in Wuhan, China, and spread to other provinces of China and subsequently to other countries resulting in a pandemic worldwide. The virus is extremely contagious and causes pneumonia and respiratory failure. Since its emergence, researchers around the world are trying to develop vaccines and find suitable drugs for the treatment of COVID-19. Objective: To give an overview of the various therapeutic agents for COVID-19 such as vaccines and drugs that are in preclinical stage or under different stages of clinical trials. Results: As per World Health Organization (WHO), there are 137 vaccines under development to date, out of which few vaccines have successfully completed preclinical studies and reached clinical trials. According to the present scenario, only one coronavirus vaccine (sputnik-V) has been approved by the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation. Till date, there are no United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) approved drugs to treat COVID-19 patients. However, depending on patient's condition, different drugs such as antiviral agents like Remdesivir, antimalarial drugs like Hydroxychloroquine, antibiotics like Azithromycin and corticosteroids like Dexamethasone are being applied and some of them have proved to be effective up to a certain extent. Conclusion: Although several vaccines for COVID-19 are under development and various drugs have been tried for its treatment, an ideal drug candidate or a vaccine is still lacking. Almost all the big pharmaceutical companies are associated with one or more research initiatives in order to develop vaccines and drugs. Many of them are going through clinical stages, expecting a positive outcome by the end of 2020.","Manna, S.; Mal, M.; Bhowmik, M.; Mandal, D.",Current Drug Therapy,107,26

We found that bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) macrophage clusters FCN1+ and FCN1+SPP1+ predominant in severe COVID-19 were transcriptionally related to synovial tissue macrophage (STM) clusters CD48hiS100A12+ and CD48+SPP1+ that drive rheumatoid arthritis (RA) synovitis. BALF macrophage cluster FABP4+ predominant in healthy lung was transcriptionally related to STM cluster TREM2+ that governs resolution of synovitis in RA remission. Plasma concentrations of SPP1 and S100A12 (key products of macrophage clusters shared with active RA) were high in severe COVID-19 and predicted the need for Intensive Care Unit transfer, and they remained high in the post-COVID-19 stage. High plasma levels of SPP1 were unique to severe COVID-19 when compared with other causes of severe pneumonia, and IHC localized SPP1+ macrophages in the alveoli of COVID-19 lung. Investigation into SPP1 mechanisms of action revealed that it drives proinflammatory activation of CD14+ monocytes and development of PD-L1+ neutrophils, both hallmarks of severe COVID-19. In summary, COVID-19 pneumonitis appears driven by similar pathogenic myeloid cell pathways as those in RA, and their mediators such as SPP1 might be an upstream activator of the aberrant innate response in severe COVID-19 and predictive of disease trajectory including post-COVID-19 pathology.","MacDonald, Lucy; Alivernini, Stefano; Tolusso, Barbara; Elmesmari, Aziza; Somma, Domenico; Perniola, Simone; Paglionico, Annamaria; Petricca, Luca; Bosello, Silvia L; Carfì, Angelo; Sali, Michela; Stigliano, Egidio; Cingolani, Antonella; Murri, Rita; Arena, Vincenzo; Fantoni, Massimo; Antonelli, Massimo; Landi, Francesco; Franceschi, Francesco; Sanguinetti, Maurizio; McInnes, Iain B; McSharry, Charles; Gasbarrini, Antonio; Otto, Thomas D; Kurowska-Stolarska, Mariola; Gremese, Elisa",JCI insight,107,29

Scalable, sensitive and specific serological assays are essential to this process. The detection of antibody in hospitalized patients with severe disease has proven relatively straightforward; detecting responses in subjects with mild disease and asymptomatic infections has proven less reliable. We hypothesized that the suboptimal sensitivity of antibody assays and the compartmentalization of the antibody response may contribute to this effect. We systematically developed an ELISA, optimizing different antigens and amplification steps, in serum and saliva from non-hospitalized SARS-CoV-2-infected subjects. Using trimeric spike glycoprotein, rather than nucleocapsid, enabled detection of responses in individuals with low antibody responses. IgG1 and IgG3 predominate to both antigens, but more anti-spike IgG1 than IgG3 was detectable. All antigens were effective for detecting responses in hospitalized patients. Anti-spike IgG, IgA and IgM antibody responses were readily detectable in saliva from a minority of RT-PCR confirmed, non-hospitalized symptomatic individuals, and these were mostly subjects who had the highest levels of anti-spike serum antibodies. Therefore, detecting antibody responses in both saliva and serum can contribute to determining virus exposure and understanding immune responses after SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Faustini, Sian E; Jossi, Sian E; Perez-Toledo, Marisol; Shields, Adrian M; Allen, Joel D; Watanabe, Yasunori; Newby, Maddy L; Cook, Alex; Willcox, Carrie R; Salim, Mahboob; Goodall, Margaret; Heaney, Jennifer L; Marcial-Juarez, Edith; Morley, Gabriella L; Torlinska, Barbara; Wraith, David C; Veenith, Tonny V; Harding, Stephen; Jolles, Stephen; Ponsford, Mark J; Plant, Tim; Huissoon, Aarnoud; O039,; Shea, Matthew K; Willcox, Benjamin E; Drayson, Mark T; Crispin, Max; Cunningham, Adam F; Richter, Alex G",Immunology,107,32

This resource is considered safe and effective and has attracted an exponential interest in the context of the COVID pandemic. Expanded to dizzy patients, it would be able to provide diagnosis and treatment, minimizing the risk of disease transmission. Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is the most common vestibular disorder. The diagnosis typically rests on the description of the symptoms along with the nystagmus observed at a well-established positional testing. Objectives The aim of the present study was to propose a teleconsultation and teletreatment protocol to manage patients with BPPV during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Specialists in the vestibular field met through remote access technologies to discuss the best strategy to manage BPPV patients by teleconsultation and teletreatment system. Additionally, several scientific sources were consulted. Technical issues, patient safety, and clinical assessment were independently analyzed. All relevant information was considered in order to design a clinical protocol to manage BPPV patients in the pandemic context. Results Teleconsultation for BPPV patients requires a double way (video and audio) digital system. An adapted informed consent to follow good clinical practice statements must be considered. The time, trigger and target eye bedside examination (TiTRaTe) protocol has proven to be a valuable first approach. The bow and lean test is the most rational screening maneuver for patients with suspected positional vertigo, followed by most specific maneuvers to diagnostic the sub-variants of BPPV. Conclusion Although with limited evidence, teleconsultation and teletreatment are both reasonable and feasible strategies for the management of patients with BPPV in adverse situations for face-to-face consultation.","Barreto, Renato Gonzaga; Yacovino, Darío Andrés; Teixeira, Lázaro Juliano; Freitas, Mayanna Machado",Int. arch. otorhinolaryngol.

The aim of this study was to compare the risk of IMV between two strategies of oxygenation (conventional oxygenation and HFNO) in critically ill COVID 19 patients. METHODS: This was a bicenter retrospective study which took place in two intensive care units (ICU) of tertiary hospitals in the Paris region from March 11, to May 3, 2020. We enrolled consecutive patients hospitalized for COVID-19 and acute respiratory failure (ARF) who did not receive IMV at ICU admission. The primary outcome was the rate of IMV after ICU admission. Secondary outcomes were death at day 28 and day 60, length of ICU stay and ventilator-free days at day 28. Data from the HFNO group were compared with those from the standard oxygen therapy (SOT) group using weighted propensity score. RESULTS: Among 138 patients who met the inclusion criteria, 62 (45%) were treated with SOT alone, and 76 (55%) with HFNO. In HFNO group, 39/76 (51%) patients received IMV and 46/62 (74%) in SOT group (OR 0.37 [95% CI, 0.18-0.76] p = 0.007). After weighted propensity score, HFNO was still associated with a lower rate of IMV (OR 0.31 [95% CI, 0.14-0.66] p = 0.002). Length of ICU stay and mortality at day 28 and day 60 did not significantly differ between HFNO and SOT groups after weighted propensity score. Ventilator-free days at days 28 was higher in HNFO group (21 days vs 10 days, p = 0.005). In the HFNO group, predictive factors associated with IMV were SAPS2 score (OR 1.13 [95%CI, 1.06-1.20] p = 0.0002) and ROX index > 4.88 (OR 0.23 [95%CI, 0.008-0.64] p = 0.006).

Nonadherence to treatment is related to several factors and may lead to persistence of symptoms and relapse. Worldwide, the rate of nonadherence to treatment in individuals with schizophrenia is around 50%. OBJECTIVES: To compare the clinical profile of nonadherent and adherent patients among individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia receiving treatment at psychosocial care centers in a city in southern Brazil. METHOD: The clinical-epidemiological profile of patients with schizophrenia was retrospectively analyzed based on medical records entered into the system between January and December 2016, evaluating data at one-year follow-up. RESULTS: 112 patients were included. The disease was more prevalent in men; mean age was 40.5 years, being lower among men. Most of the sample had a low level of education, was unemployed/retired, did not have children and resided with relatives. The highest rate of diagnosis was among young adults. Psychotic symptoms were most frequently described, and the most commonly prescribed antipsychotic was haloperidol. The nonadherence rate was 15.2%; only one patient required admission to a psychiatric hospital. Among nonadherent patients, the mean time of attendance was 6 months; there were more nonadherent women than men. The most prevalent age range of nonadherence was 41-64 years. Psychosocial and clinical data were similar across the whole sample. CONCLUSION: A nonadherence rate of 15.2% was found among individuals receiving treatment for schizophrenia, suggesting that psychosocial care centers were effective in treating and monitoring these patients.","Viveiros, Camila Poletto; Tatar, Camila Rodrigues; Dos Santos, Deivisson Vianna Dantas; Stefanello, Sabrina; Nisihara, Renato",Trends Psychiatry Psychother,107,29

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective observational study, hospitalized COVID-19 patients were identified and divided into two groups based on the antiviral agents during their hospitalization. Patients in group LR were treated with lopinavir-ritonavir 400 mg/100 mg, twice a day, while patients in group LR+Ar were treated with lopinavir-ritonavir 400 mg/100 mg twice a day and arbidol 200 mg three times a day for at least 3 days. Data from these patients were collected from electronic medical record management system. RESULTS: 73 patients were divided into two groups: group LR (34 cases) and group LR+Ar (39 cases), according to the antiviral agents. The overall cure rate of COVID-19 in group LR+Ar and group LR were 92.3% and 97.1%, respectively, with no significant difference (p = 0.62). In a modified intention-to-treat analysis, lopinavir-ritonavir combined with arbidol led to a median time of hospital stay that was shorter by 1.5 days than in group LR (12.5 days vs. 14 days). The percentages of -COVID-19 RNA clearance was 92.3 in group LR and 97.1 in group LR+Ar which was similar to the cure rate. The median time to nucleic acid turning negative = (date of first negative PCR test) - (date of last positive PCR test) was 8.0 days in both groups with no significant difference (p = 0.59). Treatment of lopinavir-ritonavir combined with arbidol did not significantly accelerate main symptom improvement and promote the image absorption of pulmonary inflammation. CONCLUSION: No benefit was observed in the antiviral effect of lopinavir-ritonavir combined with arbidol compared with lopinavir-ritonavir alone in the hospitalized patients with COVID-19. More clinical observations in COVID-19 patients may help to confirm or exclude the effect of antiviral agents.","Lan, Xiu; Shao, Chuxiao; Zeng, Xu; Wu, Zhenbo; Xu, Yanyan",Int. j. clin. pharmacol. ther,107,4

Therefore, we aimed to determine the incidence of bacterial co-infections, antibiotic use and application of antimicrobial stewardship principles in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We performed a retrospective observational study in four hospitals (1 university, 2 non-university teaching, 1 non-teaching hospital) in the Netherlands from March to May 2020 including consecutive patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19. Data on first microbiological investigations obtained at the discretion of the physician and antibiotic use in the first week of hospital admission were collected. RESULTS: Twelve (1.2%) of the 925 patients included had a documented bacterial co-infection (75.0% pneumonia) within the first week. Microbiological testing was performed in 749 (81%) patients: sputum cultures in 105 (11.4%), blood cultures in 711 (76.9%), pneumococcal urinary antigen testing in 202 (21.8%), and Legionella urinary antigen testing in 199 (21.5%) patients, with clear variation between hospitals. On presentation 556 (60.1%; range 33.3-73.4%) patients received antibiotics for a median duration of 2 days (IQR 1-4). Intravenous to oral switch was performed in 41 of 413 (9.9%) patients who received intravenous treatment >48 h. Mean adherence to the local guideline on empiric antibiotic therapy on day 1 was on average 60.3% (range 45.3%-74.7%). CONCLUSIONS: On presentation to the hospital bacterial co-infections are rare, while empiric antibiotic use is abundant. This implies that in patients with COVID-19 empiric antibiotic should be withheld. This has the potential to dramatically reduce the current overuse of antibiotics in the COVID-19 pandemic.","Karami, Zara; Knoop, Bram T; Dofferhoff, Anton S M; Blaauw, Marc J T; Janssen, Nico A; van Apeldoorn, Marjan; Kerckhoffs, Angèle P M; van de Maat, Josephine S; Hoogerwerf, Jacobien J; Ten Oever, Jaap",Infect Dis (Lond),107,1

The morbidity, mortality, and economic costs of these pandemics have been staggering. We desperately need a more targeted, cost-efficient, and sustainable strategy to detect and mitigate future zoonotic respiratory virus threats. Evidence suggests that the transition from an animal virus to a human pathogen is incremental and requires a considerable number of spillover events and considerable time before a pandemic variant emerges. This evolutionary view argues for the refocusing of public health resources on novel respiratory virus surveillance at human-animal interfaces in geographical hotspots for emerging infectious diseases. Where human-animal interface surveillance is not possible, a secondary high-yield, cost-efficient strategy is to conduct novel respiratory virus surveillance among pneumonia patients in these same hotspots. When novel pathogens are discovered, they must be quickly assessed for their human risk and, if indicated, mitigation strategies initiated. In this review, we discuss the most common respiratory virus threats, current efforts at early emerging pathogen detection, and propose and defend new molecular pathogen discovery strategies with the goal of preempting future pandemics.","Gray, Gregory C; Robie, Emily R; Studstill, Caleb J; Nunn, Charles L",Viruses,107,16

BACKGROUND: PPE can have physical consequences like headache and pain, which could result in increased nurse stress levels. METHODS: A total of 2600 nurses participated in this online survey. The questionnaire is based on literature and includes the perceived level of stress scale. RESULTS: We found no significant association between the use of PPE and stress. Nurses who wore masks for more than 8 h had significant higher stress levels than those who used the masks for a shorter period. CONCLUSIONS: The duration of wearing masks is associated with nurse's stress level. Our findings can help nurses to argue a higher frequency of breaks and a maximum duration of mask usage in their organisations. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: We recommend that nursing managers implement practical strategies such as a mask break task force. This task force could promote awareness for mask breaks and recommend and allocate rooms or locations such as balconies for mask breaks.","Hoedl, Manuela; Eglseer, Doris; Bauer, Silvia",J. nurs. manag,107,24

DESIGN: Guided by the PRECEDE-PROCEED model, virtual focus groups were conducted in five urban and rural Alabama communities using secure Zoom meetings. Community residents and stakeholders (N = 36 total) participated; meetings were audio- and video-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed according to Thematic Analysis. Themes were organized by the PRECEDE portion of the model in Predisposing, Reinforcing, and Enabling barriers and facilitators in three focus areas: prevention, coping, and testing. RESULTS: Prevention barriers included apathy, difficulty with social distancing, lack of information, mixed messages from authority figures, and lack of personal protective equipment (PPE). Prevention facilitators included concerns about contracting COVID-19, clear and consistent messages from trusted sources, contact tracing, and the provision of PPE. Coping barriers included food insecurity, mental health issues, isolation, economic hardships, lack of health care access, and issues with virtual schooling and church services, which were exacerbated by the inability to connect to the internet. Facilitators to coping included religious faith, increased physical activity, and a sense of hope. Testing barriers included misunderstanding, fear, mistrust, testing restrictions, and location of testing sites. Facilitators to testing included incentives, clear information from trusted sources, convenient testing locations, and free tests. CONCLUSION: Gaining community members' perspectives can identify barriers and facilitators to prevention, coping, and testing and potentially improve outcomes. While addressing the social determinants of health (e.g. income, education, medical trust) would be an effective path by which to diminish health disparities related to COVID-19, there is an urgent need to mitigate the spread and severity of COVID-19 in vulnerable populations. Interventions should focus on downstream determinants, such as those emerging from our study.","Bateman, Lori Brand; Schoenberger, Yu-Mei M; Hansen, Barbara; Osborne, Tiffany N; Okoro, Grace C; Speights, Kimberly M; Fouad, Mona N",Ethn Health,107,16

In a metapopulation model, one considers a network composed of subpopulations and their pairwise connections, and individuals are assumed to migrate from one subpopulation to another obeying a given mobility rule. While how different mobility rules affect epidemic dynamics in metapopulation models has been much studied, there have been relatively few efforts on systematic comparison of the effects of simple (i.e., unbiased) random walks and more complex mobility rules. Here we study a susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) dynamics in a metapopulation model, in which individuals obey a parametric second-order random-walk mobility rule called the node2vec. We map the second-order mobility rule of the node2vec to a first-order random walk in a network whose each node is a directed edge connecting a pair of subpopulations and then derive the epidemic threshold. For various networks, we find that the epidemic threshold is large (therefore, epidemic spreading tends to be suppressed) when the individuals infrequently backtrack or infrequently visit the common neighbors of the currently visited and the last visited subpopulations than when the individuals obey the simple random walk. The amount of change in the epidemic threshold induced by the node2vec mobility is in general not as large as, but is sometimes comparable with, the one induced by the change in the overall rate at which individuals diffuse from one subpopulation to another.","Meng, Lingqi; Masuda, Naoki",,107,24

METHODS: Seventy-seven patients consecutively hospitalized for COVID-19 in a geriatric unit were included. Intervention groups were participants regularly supplemented with vitamin D over the preceding year (Group 1), and those supplemented with vitamin D after COVID-19 diagnosis (Group 2). The comparator group involved participants having received no vitamin D supplements (Group 3). Outcomes were 14-day mortality and highest (worst) score on the ordinal scale for clinical improvement (OSCI) measured during COVID-19 acute phase. Potential confounders were age, gender, functional abilities, undernutrition, cancer, hypertension, cardiomyopathy, glycated hemoglobin, number of acute health issues at admission, hospital use of antibiotics, corticosteroids, and pharmacological treatments of respiratory disorders. RESULTS: The three groups (n = 77; mean ± SD, 88 ± 5years; 49% women) were similar at baseline (except for woman proportion, p = 0.02), as were the treatments used for COVID-19. In Group 1 (n = 29), 93.1% of COVID-19 participants survived at day 14, compared to 81.2% survivors in Group 2 (n = 16) (p = 0.33) and 68.7% survivors in Group 3 (n = 32) (p = 0.02). While considering Group 3 as reference (hazard ratio (HR) = 1), the fully-adjusted HR for 14-day mortality was HR = 0.07 (p = 0.017) for Group 1 and HR = 0.37 (p = 0.28) for Group 2.

The two events were supposed to be correlated, also based on the limited information available about the new virus. Despite that clear indications about the role of particulate matter (PM) in the virus mechanism dispersion cannot be found in literature, some researchers supposed that PM can act as virus carrier, promoting its diffusion through the air. This paper, for the first time, analyses the PM10 situation in Lombardy (from 10th February to March 27, 2020), several days before the sanitary emergency explosion. The data of the detected infection cases are reported and discussed parallelly. As a comparison, the situation of Piedmont, located near to the Lombardy is also presented. Data are reported for Brescia, Bergamo, Cremona, Lodi, Milano, Monza-Brianza, Pavia (Lombardy), Alessandria, Vercelli, Novara, Biella, Asti, and Torino (Piedmont). The results show that it is not possible to conclude that COVID-19 diffusion mechanism also occurs through the air, by using PM10 as a carrier. In particular, it is shown that Piedmont cities, presenting lower detected infections cases in comparison to Brescia and Bergamo in the investigated period, had most sever PM10 pollution events in comparison to Lombardy cities. This first study may serve as a reference to better understand and predict the factors affecting the COVID-19 diffusion and transmission routes, focusing on the role of air particulate matter in the atmosphere.","Bontempi, E",Environ Res,107,26

Here we use virus-host receptor binding and infection assays to examine 46 ACE2 orthologues from phylogenetically diverse bat species, including those in close and distant contact with humans. We found that 24, 21 and 16 of them failed to support infection by SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 or both viruses, respectively. Furthermore, we confirmed that infection assays in human cells were consistent with those in two bat cell lines. Additionally, we used genetic and functional analyses to identify critical residues in bat ACE2 receptors associated with viral entry restrictions. Our results suggest that many bat species may not be the potential hosts of one or both viruses and that no correlation was identified between proximity to humans and probability of being natural hosts of SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2.

This review is aimed at providing updated information on the clinical manifestations, diagnosis, preventive measures and therapeutic drugs used against SARS-CoV-2. The finding of this review revealed that some of these drugs are transmembrane protease, serine 2, and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 inhibitors with the capacity to block the entrance/replication of SARS-CoV-2 in a host cell and therefore, may be promising in preventing the spread and mortality of SARS-CoV-2. However, these drugs may cause detrimental health effects such as toxic and non-efficacy issues. Therefore great caution should be employed by health professionals when prescribing these drugs to COVID-19 patients.","Ikonne, Eleazer U; Ikpeazu, Victor O; Ugbogu, Ositadinma C; Emmanuel, Okezie; Nwakuche, Ikechukwu P; Iweala, Emeka J; Ugbogu, Eziuche A",Drug Metab.

Classifying MAS using the immunological disease continuum model, with strict boundaries that define the limits of innate and adaptive immunity, at one boundary is MAS with loss of immune function, as occurs in the 'perforinopathies' and some cases of sJIA-AOSD. Conversely, at the other boundary, immune hypersensitivity with gain of immune function in MHC class II-associated sJIA-AOSD and with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy also triggers MAS. This provides a benchmark for evaluating severe inflammation in some patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, which cripples primary type I interferon immunity and usually culminates in a lung-centric 'second wave' cytokine-driven alveolitis with associated immunothrombosis; this phenomenon is generally distinct from MAS but can share features with the proposed 'loss of immune function' MAS variant. This loss and gain of function MAS model offers immune cartography for a novel mechanistic classification of MAS with therapeutic implications.","McGonagle, Dennis; Ramanan, Athimalaipet V; Bridgewood, Charlie",Nat Rev Rheumatol,107,1

The severity of the disease has been supposed to be associated with some profile not reported with other bacterial and viral pneumonia. We proposed a study in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 infection to evaluate the interleukin patterns and its role as prognosis factors. METHODS: A prospective cohort with moderate and severe cases of COVID-19 infection from June to July 2020. Blood samples from patients were collected regularly to evaluate IFN-Î³, TNF-&#945;, IL-4, IL-6, and IL-10. Clinical, laboratory, radiological data, and outcomes were recorded. The outcome variable was in-hospital death, survival, mechanical ventilation, and admission at the intensive care unit. Data are presented in median and interquartile range [IQR]. RESULTS: We evaluated the Th1 and Th2 responses according to evolution, distinguishing possible predictive markers. The IFN-Î³ median of 323 pg/mL [IQR 166-570] was found in patients who died and 208 pg/mL [IQR 155-392] in the survival group (p = 0.017). IFN-Î³ was also higher in the early stages of the disease (394 pg/mL [IQR 229-575] against 162 pg/mL [IQR 117-259], p < 0.001). IL-4 that was increased in late-stage (182 pg/mL [IQR 162-199] against 131 pg/mL [IQR 124-152], p < 0.001) but not associated with mortality. Also, death was also related to male gender (relative risk = 1.5 [95 % confidence interval = 1.1-2.0]). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the activation of the host immune response between Th1 or Th2 in COVID-19 infection may be related to the final result between discharge or death. This implies an attempt to control cytokines, such as IFN-Î³, with combined therapies for clinical treatment.","Gadotti, Ana Carolina; de Castro Deus, Marina; Telles, Joao Paulo; Wind, Rafael; Goes, Marina; Garcia Charello Ossoski, Roberta; de Padua, Alessandra Michalski; de Noronha, Lucia; Moreno-Amaral, Andrea; Baena, Cristina Pellegrino; Tuon, Felipe Francisco",Virus Res,107,20

The imminent adoption of 5G networks worldwide and the future establishment of next-generation wireless networks will allow various applications, such as autonomous vehicles, connected robotics, and most recently, crowd monitoring for fighting infectious diseases, such as COVID-19. In this context, radio localization techniques have become an essential tool to provide solid performance for mobile positioning systems, through increased accuracy or less computational time. With this in mind, we propose a trilateration-based approach using machine learning (ML) and sequential least-square programming (SLSQP) optimization to estimate the outdoor position of mobile terminals in cellular networks. The ML technique employed is the k-nearest neighbors (k-NN). The optimization methods analyzed are Nelder–Mead (NM), genetic algorithms (GA), and SLSQP. Different environments (noise-free and noisy) and network scenarios (different numbers of base stations) are considered to evaluate the approaches. Numerical results indicate that the k-NN/SLSQP technique has similar accuracy compared to the k-NN/GA with eight generations. Both perform better than k-NN/NM in all scenarios and environments. When comparing computational times, our proposal is considerably more time-efficient. Aside from that, SLSQP computational time is less affected by network scenarios with more base stations in comparison with GA. That feature is significant considering the ultra-dense base station deployment forecasted for the next-generation cellular networks. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Marques, J. P. P. G.; Cunha, D.

Social network analysis supports an objective, quantitative evaluation of social networks among individuals with aphasia along with potential impacts of social programming and interventions on an individual's social network. Social network analysis may also support better understanding of the impact of Covid on individuals with aphasia. Aims: This pilot evaluation utilized social network analysis via R to evaluate the social network characteristics of a community-based aphasia network across a 12-month pre-Covid period. Social network aphasia group data for a standard duration of time pre- and post-Covid were also compared to identify potential social implications of Covid in a population already at higher risk for reduced social interactions. This presentation will also provide fundamental concepts relevant to social network analysis for those interested in pursuing such analysis in further depth. Methods: Twelve months of pre-Covid aphasia group program attendance data were examined using the visNetwork R package.

Multiple social network characteristics were analyzed and displayed including node, edgeness, directionality, weight, and centrality indices across individuals with aphasia, care partners and community members and settings. Results and Conclusions: Network analysis reveals a directed network graph with primarily unidirectional relationships. There is an emergence of several aphasia group participant behavior types, both pre- and post-Covid, relevant for future planning including: communities of individuals who have similar behaviors in terms of type of event attendance;key individuals who are “heavy users” of various services in terms of frequency and breadth of event attendance;and peripheral users who use only one service.

It has exposed unexpected cardiovascular vulnerabilities at all stages of the disease (pre-infection, acute phase and subsequent chronic phase). The major cardiometabolic drivers identified to have epidemiological and mechanistic associations with COVID-19 are abnormal adiposity, dysglycemia, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. Hypertension is of particular interest, because components of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), which are critically involved in the pathophysiology of hypertension, are also implicated in COVID-19. Specifically ACE2, a multifunctional protein of the RAS, which is part of the protective axis of the RAS, is also the receptor through which SARS-CoV-2 enters host cells causing viral infection. Cardiovascular and cardiometabolic co-morbidities not only predispose to COVID-19, but are complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, increasing evidence indicates that acute kidney injury is common in COVID-19, that it occurs early and in temporal association with respiratory failure and is associated with poor prognosis, especially in the presence of cardiovascular risk factors. Here we discuss cardiovascular and kidney disease in the context of COVID-19 and provide recent advances on putative pathophysiological mechanisms linking cardiovascular disease and COVID-19, focusing on the RAS and ACE2 as well as the immune system and inflammation. We provide up-to-date information on the relationship between hypertension, diabetes, and COVID-19 and emphasize the major cardiovascular diseases associated with COVID-19.

METHODS: We started to develop a pandemic plan to maintain oncological rehabilitation in February 2020. With the involvement of the whole clinic staff we developed protection scenarios with the aim of achieving Covid-19-free clinics. Schedules were developed and implemented based on the epidemiological bulletins of the RKI (Robert Koch Institute, Germany) of 2017 (influenza infection) and 2020 (Covid-19). The effects of these measures were evaluated by means of a patient and employee survey. RESULTS: The challenges of the pandemic have been successfully implemented. Both the patient and employee surveys showed a high level of acceptance of the measures. For example, 98.5% of patients stated that the continuation of rehabilitation was important for their health, even in the pandemic situation. At the same time, 87% felt safe. 88% of all employees (MA) and 93% of MA in the risk group stated that the protective measures were introduced at the right time. At the same time, 76% of all employees and 84% of the employees in the risk group agreed with the additional burden. In spite of the high risk potential in the clinics (immunocompromised patients, patients from different districts with different levels of exposure), an outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 could be avoided in the clinics. CONCLUSION: The timely roll-out of adapted pandemic rules in rehabilitation clinics enables the continuation of high-quality oncological rehabilitation even in pandemic times and thus contributes to a stabilisation of the supply chain for cancer diseases. A high level of acceptance of the measures among patients and hospital staff was evaluated.","Leibbrand, Birgit; Seifart, Ulf",Rehabilitation (Stuttg),107,30

It was first time reported in December 2019 in Wuhan, China and thereafter quickly spread across the globe. Till September 19, 2020, COVID-19 has spread to 216 countries and territories. Severe infection of SARS-CoV-2 cause extreme increase in inflammatory chemokines and cytokines that may lead to multi-organ damage and respiratory failure. Currently, no specific treatment and authorized vaccines are available for its treatment. Renin angiotensin system holds a promising role in human physiological system specifically in regulation of blood pressure and electrolyte and fluid balance. SARS-CoV-2 interacts with Renin angiotensin system by utilizing angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor for its cellular entry. This interaction hampers the protective action of ACE2 in the cells and causes injuries to organs due to persistent angiotensin II (Ang-II) level. Patients with certain comorbidities like hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease are under the high risk of COVID-19 infection and mortality. Moreover, evidence obtained from several reports also suggests higher susceptibility of male patients for COVID-19 mortality and other acute viral infections compared to females. Analysis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS) epidemiological data also indicate a gender-based preference in disease consequences. The current review addresses the possible mechanisms responsible for higher COVID-19 mortality among male patients. The major underlying aspects that was looked into includes smoking, genetic factors, and the impact of reproductive hormones on immune systems and inflammatory responses. Detailed investigations of this gender disparity could provide insight into the development of patient tailored therapeutic approach which would be helpful in improving the poor outcomes of COVID-19.

Health care workers (HCWs) face enormous pressure due to work overload, negative emotions, exhaustion, lack of contact with their families, and risk of catching the infection and death. AIM: This study aims to assess the level of stress perceived by HCWs and possible associated factors during the COVID-19 outbreak in Palestine. METHODS: A cross-sectional sample of 430 frontlines HCWs was conducted using an online self-reported questionnaire. HCWs' stress from the COVID-19 outbreak, factors that increase stress, and the activities that reduced stress were assessed. Chi-square test was used to compare between a categorical variable and the study outcome; associations are presented as odds ratios (OR) and confidence intervals (95% CI) with 0.05 significance level. Al-Najah National University institutional review board granted ethics approval. RESULTS: Most respondents (74.0%) reported high-stress levels during the outbreak. Fear of transmitting the virus to family was the most stressful factor (91.6%). HCWs who did not have training on the outbreak response were more likely to have high-stress levels (OR = 2.7 [95% CI = 1.7-4.4], P < .001). Those with high stress reported being disappointed (OR = 2.4 [95% CI = 1.5-3.6], P < .001), and strongly considered taking sick leave (OR = 3.9 [95% CI = 1.9-7.9], P < .001). CONCLUSION: HCWs are under tremendous stress, given the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Understanding the psychological impact of the outbreak on HCWs and the activities that mitigate the stress is crucial to guide policies and interventions that can maintain psychological well-being.","Maraqa, Beesan; Nazzal, Zaher; Zink, Therese",J Prim Care Community Health,107,5

METHODS: In total, 2,558 upper respiratory tract (URT) and lower respiratory tract (LRT) specimens from 138 patients with laboratory-confirmed coronavirus disease were analyzed. Measurements of sequential viral loads were aggregated using the cubic spline smoothing function of a generalized additive model. The time to negative conversion was compared between symptom groups using survival analysis. RESULTS: In URT samples, viral RNA levels peaked on day 4 after symptom onset and rapidly decreased until day 10 for both E and RdRp genes, whereas those in LRT samples immediately peaked from symptom onset and decreased until days 15.6 and 15.0 for E and RdRp genes, respectively. Median (interquartile range) time to negative conversion was significantly longer in symptomatic (18.0 [13.0-25.0] days) patients than in asymptomatic (13.0 [9.5-17.5] days) patients. The more types of symptoms a patient had, the longer was the time to negative conversion. CONCLUSIONS: The viral load rapidly changes depending on the time after symptom onset; viral shedding period may be longer with more clinical symptoms.

Expanded tracing-testing efforts were touted as a key solution that would allow for a precision approach, thus preventing economies from having to shut down again. However, it is now clear that many regions of the U.S. were unable to mount robust enough testing-tracing programs to prevent major resurgences of disease.

We analyzed the role of these two forces in the evolution of viruses belonging to the Betacoronavirus genus. The results showed that recombination has been pervasive during sarbecovirus evolution, and it is more widespread in this subgenus compared to the other two. In both sarbecoviruses and merbecoviruses, recombination hotspots are clearly observed. Conversely, positive selection was a less prominent force in sarbecoviruses compared to embecoviruses and merbecoviruses and targeted distinct genomic regions in the three subgenera, with S being the major target in sarbecoviruses alone.

We compared the occurrence and detectability of birds during the spring 2020 lockdown with baseline data from previous years in the same urban areas and dates. We found that birds did not increase their probability of occurrence in urban areas during the lockdown, refuting the hypothesis that nature has recovered its space in human-emptied urban areas. However, we found an increase in bird detectability, especially during early morning, suggesting a rapid change in the birds' daily routines in response to quieter and less crowded cities.

O cultivo aquapônico pode ser realizado em basicamente dois tipos de sistemas, o deep water system ou flutuante (DWS) e o nutrient film technique ou leito cultivado (NFT). A Sarcocornia ambigua (Michx.) Alonso & Crespo (Amaranthaceae) é um subarbusto perene, nativo das marismas temperadas e tropicais da costa atlântica da América do Sul e capaz de atingir alta produtividade quando irrigado com efluentes salinos da maricultura. Estas características sugerem um grande potencial desta planta para utilização em sistemas de recirculação de água (RAS; abreviatura inglesa de Recirculating Aquaculture Systems), indispensáveis aos modernos sistemas intensivos de ciclo fechado da maricultura intensiva. O presente estudo teve como objetivo avaliar a capacidade de remoção de compostos nitrogenados e fosfatos da água de recirculação de uma piscicultura marinha intensiva através de dois RAS aquapônicos, constituídos de plantas de S. ambigua crescendo em sistemas NFT e DWS, além de quantificar o crescimento e a produção de biomassa dessa planta. O NFT foi montado em uma bancada hidropônica comercial, com 8 tubos de PVC com 6 m de comprimento acomodando um total de 120 plantas, recebendo água de uma caixa dágua contendo 450 L, com um fluxo de 385,2 L/hora e uma taxa de renovação diária da água de 20,5 vezes. O DWS era composto por um tanque plástico de cultivo (1,89m x 1,26m x 0,42m) de 1000 L com 6 balsas flutuantes contendo um total de 120 plantas, que recirculava água com uma caixa plástica coletora de 60 L, com um fluxo de 61,2 L/hora e uma taxa de renovação diária de 1,5 vezes. O delineamento experimental do trabalho foi composto dos dois RAS aquapônicos citados acima, que receberam água salgada de recirculação de tanques de engorda do cultivo intensivo em ciclo fechado do peixe marinho bijupirá (Rachycentron canadum Linnaeus, 1766). A eficiência na remoção dos nutrientes nos dois RAS aquapônicos foi avaliada em três ciclos de recirculação (C1, C2 e C3) com duração de 72 horas, sendo coletadas amostras de água a cada 24 horas para análises dos compostos nitrogenados, fosfatos e parâmetros da qualidade de água, assim como clorofila a. O desenvolvimento das plantas foi avaliado através de biometria periódica e coleta final da biomassa de caules e raízes. As concentrações de N-NO3, N-NO2, N-NAT (nitrogênio amoniacal total) e P-PO4, bem como salinidade, temperatura e pH durante o experimento se mantiveram dentro dos limites recomendados para o bijupirá. Os cultivos aquapônicos demonstraram um bom potencial de uso para remoção de composto nitrogenados do cultivo intensivo do bijupirá, mas particularmente para o NAT (até 93,3% em 72 horas) e com menor eficiência para o nitrato (até 67,4% em 72 horas). Nos dois RAS, houve grandes X variações nas taxas de remoção entre ciclos e entre os tempos de retenção nos ciclos, bem como incorporações de nitrito (até 0,15 mg N-NO2/L) e nitrato (até 55,8 mg N-NO3/L) na água de recirculação. Condições significativamente mais acidificadas, associadas aos eventos de incorporações de nitrito e nitrato (marcadamente em DWS durante C2 e C3), sugerem o estabelecimento de uma comunidade de microrganismos caracteristicamente mais nitrificante. Os teores médios de fosfato na água dos tanques de bijupirá aumentaram ao longo das três semanas de experimentação (de 0,56 para 7,60 mg P-PO4/L). Em ambos RAS aquapônicos e em todos os ciclos, o fosfato apresentou altas taxas de incorporação (até 257,1% após 72 horas) na água em recirculação, provavelmente resultante da mineralização do fósforo orgânico dissolvido, originado tanto da comida ofertada como de células fitoplanctônicas mortas. Concentrações médias globais significativamente menores de todos nutrientes ocorreram NFT. As plantas de S. ambigua mostraram um bom desenvolvimento em aquaponia. Um maior crescimento individual foi observado no NFT, onde 88 dias após poda dos caules, as plantas apresentaram médias de altura do caule de 26,4 cm, 5,4 ramificações por caule com comprimento máximo médio de 16,5 cm e uma massa fresca de caule de 36,2 g. O menor crescimento das plantas no DWS pode ter sido ocasionado por baixa oxigenação das raízes, devido ao menor fluxo de água e a ausência de aeração no tanque de cultivo. A produção potencial de biomassa fresca de caules de S. ambigua variou entre 0,62 (NFT) e 1,10 kg/m²/88dias (DWS). Apesar no menor crescimento das plantas, a maior produção de biomassa em DWS ocorreu devido ao maior número de indivíduos por área de cultivo (50,4 plantas/m²) do que no NFT (11,1 plantas/m²). Ambos os sistemas apresentaram um bom potencial de remoção de nutrientes da piscicultura marinha intensiva do bijupirá. Um mais rápido desenvolvimento de plantas de S. ambigua pode ser obtido no NFT, mas um menor uso de espaços e maiores produtividades primárias por área de plantio podem ser obtidas no DWS.","OLIVEIRA, GLAUCE DA SILVA",,107,24

The attitude towards flu vaccination in light of the COVID-19 pandemic has so far been studied in the literature mostly with the help of surveys and questionnaires. Whether a person chooses to be vaccinated or not during the COVID-19 pandemic, however, speaks louder than any declaration of intention. In our teaching hospital, we registered a statistically significant increase in flu vaccination coverage across all professional categories between the 2019/2020 and the 2020/2021 campaign (24.19% vs. 54.56%, p < 0.0001). A linear regression model, based on data from four previous campaigns, predicted for the 2020/2021 campaign a total flu vaccination coverage of 30.35%. A coverage of 54.46% was, instead, observed, with a statistically significant difference from the predicted value (p < 0.0001). The COVID-19 pandemic can, therefore, be considered as an incentive that significantly and dramatically increased adherence to flu vaccination among our healthcare workers.","Di Pumpo, Marcello; Vetrugno, Giuseppe; Pascucci, Domenico; Carini, Elettra; Beccia, Viria; Sguera, Anna; Zega, Maurizio; Pani, Marcello; Cambieri, Andrea; Nurchis, Mario Cesare; D039,; Ambrosio, Floriana; Damiani, Gianfranco; Laurenti, Patrizia",,107,20

Two studies were conducted with undergraduate students (Study 1: n = 210, 63% male and 37% female, Mage = 26.93 years, SD = 5.94 years;Study 2: n = 303, 59% male and 41% female, Mage = 26.13 years, SD = 7.05 years), including one during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results of Study 1 showed that obsessive passion was positively related to negative emotions, whereas harmonious passion was negatively related to negative and positively to positive emotions. In turn, negative emotions positively related to academic procrastination, while positive emotions prevented it. Study 2 replicated the model of Study 1 and extended it to include the role of students' passion and emotions towards their favorite non-academic activity as predictors of academic procrastination. The results of Study 2 showed that passion and emotions for other activities also predict academic procrastination over and beyond academic passion and emotions. These findings provide support for the role of passion and emotions in academic and leisure settings as predictors of academic procrastination behaviors and yield theoretical and practical implications. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Rahimi, S.; Vallerand, R.

This study aimed to further clarify the determinants and clinical risk factors of the disease severity in patients infected with COVID-19. METHODS: A multi-centre descriptive study on all patients who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 in the province of Tehran from March 2020 up to Dec 2020 was conducted. Data on socio-demographic characteristics, clinical presentations, comorbidities, and the health outcomes of 205,654 patients were examined. Characteristics of the study population were described. To assess the association of study variables with the disease severity, the Chi-Squared test and Multiple Logistic Regression model were applied. RESULTS: The mean age of the study population was 52.8 years and 93,612 (45.5%) were women. About half of the patients have presented with low levels of blood oxygen saturation. The ICU admission rate was 17.8% and the overall mortality rate was 10.0%. Older age, male sex, comorbidities including hypertension, cancer, chronic respiratory diseases other than asthma, chronic liver diseases, chronic kidney diseases, chronic neurological disorders, and HIV/AIDS infection were risk markers of poor health outcome. Clinical presentations related with worse prognosis included fever, difficulty breathing, impaired consciousness, and cutaneous manifestations. CONCLUSION: These results might alert physicians to pay attention to determinants and risk factors associated with poor prognosis in patients with COVID-19. In addition, our findings aid decision makers to emphasise on vulnerable groups in the public health strategies that aim at preventing the spread of the disease and its mortalities.","Sohrabi, Mohammad-Reza; Amin, Rozhin; Maher, Ali; Bahadorimonfared, Ayad; Janbazi, Shahriar; Hannani, Khatereh; Kolahi, Ali-Asghar; Zali, Ali-Reza",BMC Infect Dis,107,16

CASE REPORT We present the cases of 3 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 via RT-PCR in their third trimester of pregnancy. All patients underwent emergent cesarean sections and were managed on mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit and eventually discharged in stable condition. CONCLUSIONS Early cesarean section and aggressive management with mechanical ventilation has been shown to be very beneficial for mothers diagnosed with COVID-19 and their infants. All 3 patients were successfully extubated, and all 3 infants tested negative for COVID-19, suggesting no vertical transmission; although, further studies are needed to confirm this finding.","Douedi, Steven; Albayati, Asseel; Alfraji, Nasam; Mazahir, Usman; Costanzo, Eric",Am J Case Rep,107,21

A two-way ANOVA revealed significant differences in the symptom intensity between the three diseases (p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: This modified Delphi approach enabled the differentiation of upper respiratory symptoms between COVID-19, the common cold and allergic rhinitis. An electronic algorithm will be devised using the questionnaire.","Hagemann, Jan; Onorato, Gabrielle L; Jutel, Marek; Akdis, Cezmi A; Agache, Ioana; Zuberbier, Torsten; Czarlewski, Wienczyslawa; Mullol, Joaquim; Bedbrook, Anna; Bachert, Claus; Bennoor, Kazi S; Bergmann, Karl-Christian; Braido, Fulvio; Camargos, Paulo; Caraballo, Luis; Cardona, Victoria; Casale, Thomas; Cecchi, Lorenzo; Chivato, Tomas; Chu, Derek K; Cingi, Cemal; Correia-de-Sousa, Jaime; Del Giacco, Stefano; Dokic, Dejan; Dykewicz, Mark; Ebisawa, Motohiro; El-Gamal, Yehia; Emuzyte, Regina; Fauquert, Jean-Luc; Fiocchi, Alessandro; Fokkens, Wytske J; Fonseca, Joao A; Gemicioglu, Bilun; Gomez, René-Maximiliano; Gotua, Maia; Haahtela, Tari; Hamelmann, Eckard; Iinuma, Tomohisa; Ivancevich, Juan Carlos; Jassem, Ewa; Kalayci, Omer; Kardas, Przemyslaw; Khaitov, Musa; Kuna, Piotr; Kvedariene, Violeta; Larenas-Linnemann, Desiree E; Lipworth, Brian; Makris, Michael; Maspero, Jorge F; Miculinic, Neven",Allergy,107,30

The term 'digital competence of a teacher' is disclosed and a comparative analysis of the attitude to distance learning of teachers and students using a sociological survey is made. The teachers identified the lack of direct contact with the student as the main disadvantage of distance learning, and students feel discomfort due to the inability to receive knowledge directly from the teacher. A number of problems of distance learning have been identified and a course program has been created to improve the digital competence of a teacher. The course content covers the basics of pedagogical design, rubrics of educational results, platforms for collaboration, tools for creating a video lecture, platforms for monitoring and collecting information, digital footprint and analysis, online resources of virtual laboratory work. As a result of learning, 680 university teachers and teachers of secondary schools in Kazakhstan designed their own course. At the end of the first semester, the approbation of these courses was considered. The authors performed a two-step data analysis procedure using deductive and inductive analysis methods. According to the course indicators, many of the identified problems have significantly decreased. © 2021 IEEE.","Darazha, I.; Lyazzat, R.; Ulzharkyn, A.; Saira, Z.; Manat, Z.","9th International Conference on Information and Education Technology, ICIET 2021",107,16

Methods: A systematic literature search using PubMed, Embase, and EuropePMC was performed on 8 October 2020. This study's main outcome is a poor composite outcome, comprising of mortality and severe COVID-19. Results: There were 9 studies with 3,663 patients. The prevalence of dyslipidemia in this pooled analysis was 18% (4%-32%). Dyslipidemia was associated with increased composite poor outcome (RR 1.39 [1.02, 1.88], p=0.010; I2: 56.7%, p=0.018). Subgroup analysis showed that dyslipidemia was associated with severe COVID-19 (RR 1.39 [1.03, 1.87], p=0.008; I2: 57.4%, p=0.029). Meta-regression showed that the association between dyslipidemia and poor outcome varies by age (coefficient: -0.04, p=0.033), male gender (coefficient: -0.03, p=0.042), and hypertension (coefficient: -0.02, p=0.033), but not diabetes (coefficient: -0.24, p=0.135) and cardiovascular diseases (coefficient: -0.01, p=0.506). Inverted funnel-plot was relatively symmetrical. Egger's test indicates that the pooled analysis was not statistically significant for small-study effects (p=0.206). Conclusion: Dyslipidemia potentially increases mortality and severity of COVID-19. The association was stronger in patients with older age, male, and hypertension.

AIM: To examine associations between ethnicity and deprivation with timing of palliative care referral for inpatients with COVID-19. DESIGN: Service evaluation of consecutive patients with COVID-19 referred to palliative care. Sociodemographic (including age, sex, Index of Multiple Deprivation, ethnicity coded as White/non-White) and clinical variables were described. The primary outcome was timing of referral to palliative care. Associations between ethnicity and socioeconomic deprivation with the primary outcome were explored using multivariable regression. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Patients with COVID-19 referred to a hospital palliative care service across two London hospitals February-May 2020. RESULTS: A total of 334 patients were included. 119 (36%) were from a non-White ethnic group; most commonly Black British (77, 23%) and Asian British (26, 8%). A longer time between admission and palliative care referral was associated with male gender (IRR 1.23, 95% CI 1.14-1.34) and lower levels of socioeconomic deprivation (IRR 1.61, 95% CI 1.36-1.90) but not ethnicity (IRR = 0.96, 95% CI 0.87-1.06). CONCLUSIONS: This large service evaluation showed no evidence that patients from ethnic minority or more deprived socioeconomic groups had longer time to palliative care referral.

When reading and interpreting data, personal knowledge about the data plays an important role. Data visualization, however, has neither a concept defining personal knowledge about datasets, nor the methods or tools to robustly integrate them into an analysis process, thus hampering analysts' ability to express their personal knowledge about datasets, and others to learn from such knowledge. In this work, we define such personal knowledge about datasets as data hunches and elevate this knowledge to another form of data that can be externalized, visualized, and used for collaboration. We establish the implications of data hunches and provide a design space for externalizing and communicating data hunches through visualization techniques. We envision such a design space will empower users to externalize their personal knowledge and support the ability to learn from others' data hunches.","Lin, Haihan; Akbaba, Derya; Meyer, Miriah; Lex, Alexander",,107,7

Due to shortfalls of PPE during the SARS CoV-2 pandemic, the need for FFR decontamination and reuse (FFR-DR) strategies is paramount. This paper aims to discuss primary decontamination strategies, with an in-depth analysis of ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI), arriving at the decontamination strategy utilized at the Nebraska Medical Center (NMC). Methods: Review of the primary literature in regard to FFR-DR as well as a synopsis of the current protocol for FFR-DR at NMC. Recent findings: UVGI demonstrates effective decontamination of multiple pathogens-including several human respiratory viruses-while maintaining mask integrity and filtering capacity. UVGI was associated with degradation of strap integrity at higher doses than that utilized for decontamination or with reuse beyond 20 times. Summary: UVGI effectively decontaminates N95 FFRs without significant reduction to fit or strap integrity and can be employed as a strategy for FFR-DR in times of emergency.","Ridder, Mark P; Paladino, Katie D; Lowe, John J; Rupp, Mark E",Curr Treat Options Infect Dis,107,20

Objective: To examine the risk of severe COVID-19 illness among children associated with underlying medical conditions and medical complexity. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study included patients aged 18 years and younger with International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification code U07.1 (COVID-19) or B97.29 (other coronavirus) during an emergency department or inpatient encounter from March 2020 through January 2021. Data were collected from the Premier Healthcare Database Special COVID-19 Release, which included data from more than 800 US hospitals. Multivariable generalized linear models, controlling for patient and hospital characteristics, were used to estimate adjusted risk of severe COVID-19 illness associated with underlying medical conditions and medical complexity. Exposures: Underlying medical conditions and medical complexity (ie, presence of complex or noncomplex chronic disease). Main Outcomes and Measures: Hospitalization and severe illness when hospitalized (ie, combined outcome of intensive care unit admission, invasive mechanical ventilation, or death). Results: Among 43â¯465 patients with COVID-19 aged 18 years or younger, the median (interquartile range) age was 12 (4-16) years, 22â¯943 (52.8%) were female patients, and 12â¯491 (28.7%) had underlying medical conditions. The most common diagnosed conditions were asthma (4416 [10.2%]), neurodevelopmental disorders (1690 [3.9%]), anxiety and fear-related disorders (1374 [3.2%]), depressive disorders (1209 [2.8%]), and obesity (1071 [2.5%]). The strongest risk factors for hospitalization were type 1 diabetes (adjusted risk ratio [aRR], 4.60; 95% CI, 3.91-5.42) and obesity (aRR, 3.07; 95% CI, 2.66-3.54), and the strongest risk factors for severe COVID-19 illness were type 1 diabetes (aRR, 2.38; 95% CI, 2.06-2.76) and cardiac and circulatory congenital anomalies (aRR, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.48-1.99). Prematurity was a risk factor for severe COVID-19 illness among children younger than 2 years (aRR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.47-2.29). Chronic and complex chronic disease were risk factors for hospitalization, with aRRs of 2.91 (95% CI, 2.63-3.23) and 7.86 (95% CI, 6.91-8.95), respectively, as well as for severe COVID-19 illness, with aRRs of 1.95 (95% CI, 1.69-2.26) and 2.86 (95% CI, 2.47-3.32), respectively. Conclusions and Relevance: This cross-sectional study found a higher risk of severe COVID-19 illness among children with medical complexity and certain underlying conditions, such as type 1 diabetes, cardiac and circulatory congenital anomalies, and obesity.

Compared to pregnant women without SARS-CoV-2, women hospitalized with symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 were more likely to be overweight or obese (adjusted OR 1.86, (95% CI 1.39-2.48) and aOR 2.07 (1.53-2.29)), to be of Black, Asian or Other minority ethnic group (aOR 6.24, (3.93-9.90), aOR 4.36, (3.19-5.95) and aOR 12.95, (4.93-34.01)), and to have a relevant medical comorbidity (aOR 1.83 (1.32-2.54)). Hospitalized pregnant women with symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 were more likely to be admitted to intensive care (aOR 57.67, (7.80-426.70)) but the absolute risk of poor outcomes was low. Cesarean births and neonatal unit admission were increased regardless of symptom status (symptomatic aOR 2.60, (1.97-3.42) and aOR 3.08, (1.99-4.77); asymptomatic aOR 2.02, (1.52-2.70) and aOR 1.84, (1.12-3.03)). The risks of stillbirth or neonatal death were not significantly increased, regardless of symptom status. CONCLUSIONS: We have identified factors that increase the risk of symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 in pregnancy. Clinicians can be reassured that the majority of women do not experience severe complications of SARS-CoV-2 in pregnancy.","Vousden, Nicola; Bunch, Kathryn; Morris, Edward; Simpson, Nigel; Gale, Christopher; O039,; Brien, Patrick; Quigley, Maria; Brocklehurst, Peter; Kurinczuk, Jennifer J; Knight, Marian",PLoS One,107,1

Training in endoscopic skills is essential for ENT residents, and is especially important during the coronavirus disease 2019 lockdown period. In such difficult times, ENT residents and surgeons can undergo hands-on training using a papaya petiole, even within their homes. OBJECTIVE: Endoscopic ear surgery training can be carried out using a papaya petiole, enabling the practice of grommet insertion, tympanomeatal flap elevation and foreign body removal from the external auditory canal. This model does not need any laboratory setup. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The hollow structure of the papaya petiole model is very similar to that of the external auditory canal, making training in endoscopic ear surgery easy. Use of the model helps a beginner to train in endoscopic handling and microsurgical instrumentation, and improves depth perception. In addition, it does not require high-end facilities to store equipment or undertake the training at any given point in time.","Narendrakumar, V",J Laryngol Otol,107,29

Accordingly, we sought to perform a systematic review of the effects of remotely delivered interventions to improve exercise behaviour in sedentary adults living with and beyond cancer. METHODS: Eligible studies were randomised controlled trials comparing a remotely delivered exercise intervention to a usual care comparison in sedentary people over 18 years old with a primary cancer diagnosis. Nine electronic databases were searched from inception to November 2020. RESULTS: The review included three trials, totalling 186 participants. Two of the included trials incorporated prescriptions that meet current aerobic exercise recommendations, one of which also meets the guidelines for resistance exercise. No trials reported an intervention adherence of 75% or more for a set prescription that meets current exercise guidelines. CONCLUSION: There is little evidence suggesting that remote exercise interventions promote exercise behaviours or improve physical function in sedentary adults living with and beyond cancer. The development and evaluation of novel remote exercise interventions is needed to establish their usefulness for clinical practice. Given the social response to the COVID-19 pandemic, further research in this area is urgently needed.","Ibeggazene, Saïd; Turner, Rebecca; Rosario, Derek; Bourke, Liam",BMC Cancer,107,1

During the current coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, there is a greater need to encourage participation in the SDM process. The pandemic has created both challenges and opportunities for delivering care, as system adaptations influence the physician-patient relationship. Although social distancing and health service reallocation can interfere with preference for an in-person visit, these measures also provide an avenue to study and implement virtual SDM processes. Communicating risk at a time of heightened uncertainty may pose a barrier to SDM engagement but provides the opportunity to foster a patient-centered approach within a more personalized context. Social media influence during coronavirus disease 2019 has resulted in an ""infodemic"" but highlights the importance of patient engagement. The pandemic has changed how we deliver care but allows us to re-evaluate common practices and enhance effectiveness of our management strategies. Navigating the uncertainty of subsequent pandemic waves creates confusion about how to safely reinitiate clinical service. This will require ongoing SDM with our patients and among colleagues through current-and future-challenges.

One vital device is an appropriate syringe for delivering vaccine. With the potential for millions to be infected and the vaccine supply severely stretched it is imperative that the syringe used to vaccinate waste as little vaccine as possible and thus allow for a maximum number of persons to be vaccinated. Our study tested seven leading candidate vaccine syringes for dosing accuracy, dose-capacity per vial, medication wastage and a battery of ergonomic features. One device, the Flu+™ syringe, proved superior to the others in all important categories, possibly due to its low dead-space volume and its dosing accuracy. The data suggest that switching to this device from any of the others tested would provide between 2 and 19% additional vaccine doses per vial if the current 10-dose vials are used. Extrapolations from this data suggest that many thousands to millions of additional persons could be vaccinated in mass campaigns. Use of a syringe of this type, and the vaccine savings that would accrue, would likely be important in reducing morbidity and mortality in the event of a pandemic of influenza.","Strauss, Kenneth; van Zundert, André; Frid, Anders; Costigliola, Vincenzo",Vaccine,107,21

Thus, our purpose was to more precisely evaluate these impacts on radiologists through a nationwide survey. METHODS: A 43-item anonymous questionnaire was adapted from the AO Spine Foundation's survey and distributed to 1521 unique email addresses using REDCap™. Additional invitations were sent out to American Society of Emergency Radiology (ASER) and Association of University Radiologists (AUR) members. Responses were collected over a period of 8 days. Descriptive analyses and multivariate modeling were performed using SAS v9.4 software. RESULTS: A total of 689 radiologists from 44 different states met the criteria for inclusion in the analysis. As many as 61% of respondents rated their level of anxiety with regard to COVID-19 to be a 7 out of 10 or greater, and higher scores were positively correlated the standardized number of COVID-19 cases in a respondent's state (RR = 1.11, 95% CI: 1.02–1.21, p = 0.01). Citing the stressor of “personal health” was a strong predictor of higher anxiety scores (RR 1.23; 95% CI: 1.13–1.34, p < 0.01). By contrast, participants who reported needing no coping methods were more likely to self-report lower anxiety scores (RR 0.4; 95% CI: 0.3–0.53, p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 has had a significant impact on radiologists across the nation. As these unique stressors continue to evolve, further attention must be paid to the ways in which we may continue to support radiologists working in drastically altered practice environments and in remote settings.","Demirjian, Natalie L.; Fields, Brandon K.K.; Song, Catherine; Reddy, Sravanthi; Desai, Bhushan; Cen, Steven Y.; Salehi, Sana; Gholamrezanezhad, Ali",Clin Imaging,107,1

However, this survival benefit attenuates with increased acculturation to Western lifestyles, potentially due to adoption of unhealthy behaviors. Accordingly, we assessed whether Hispanic ethnicity and linguistic acculturation, as measured by English proficiency, were associated with nonadherence to cardiovascular medications. We enrolled patients presenting to an academic medical center emergency department with suspected acute coronary syndrome between May 2014 and November 2017. Ethnicity, native language, and English proficiency were self-reported. Cardiovascular medication adherence was assessed using an electronic pill bottle that recorded the date and time of each bottle opening. Generalized linear models with a logit link were used to examine the association of Hispanic ethnicity and English proficiency with daily cardiovascular medication adherence, adjusting for demographics, comorbidities, and dosing frequency of the electronically-monitored medication. Among 332 included patients, mean age was 61.68 ± 12.05 years, 43.07% were women, and 62.95% were Hispanic, of whom 80.38% were native Spanish-speakers. Overall, Hispanics had higher odds of medication adherence than non-Hispanics (adjusted OR 1.31, 95% CI 1.16–1.49, p < 0.001).

Although Hispanics had better medication adherence than non-Hispanics overall, increased linguistic acculturation among native Spanish-speakers was associated with worse adherence behaviors.","Liyanage-Don, Nadia A.; Cornelius, Talea; Romero, Emily K.; Alcántara, Carmela; Kronish, Ian M.",Prev Med Rep,107,26

The treatments and vaccines rely on the basic biophysics of the complex viral apparatus. While proteins are serving as main drug and vaccine targets, therapeutic approaches targeting the 30,000 nucleotide RNA viral genome form important complementary approaches. Indeed, the high conservation of the viral genome, its close evolutionary relationship to other viruses, and the rise of gene editing and RNA-based vaccines all argue for a focus on the RNA agent itself. One of the key steps in the viral replication cycle inside host cells is the ribosomal frameshifting required for translation of overlapping open reading frames. The frameshifting element (FSE), one of three highly conserved regions of coronaviruses, includes an RNA pseudoknot considered essential for this ribosomal switching. In this work, we apply our graph-theory-based framework for representing RNA secondary structures, “RAG” (RNA-As Graphs), to alter key structural features of the FSE of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Specifically, using RAG machinery of genetic algorithms for inverse folding adapted for RNA structures with pseudoknots, we computationally predict minimal mutations that destroy a structurally-important stem and/or the pseudoknot of the FSE, potentially dismantling the virus against translation of the polyproteins. Additionally, our microsecond molecular dynamics simulations of mutant structures indicate relatively stable secondary structures. These findings not only advance our computational design of RNAs containing pseudoknots; they pinpoint to key residues of the SARS-CoV-2 virus as targets for anti-viral drugs and gene editing approaches.","Schlick, T.; Zhu, Q.; Jain, S.; Yan, S.",bioRxiv,107,29

It is unclear whether responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines based on the prototypic strain will be impacted by mutations found in B.1.1.7. Here we assessed immune responses following vaccination with mRNA-based vaccine BNT162b2. We measured neutralising antibody responses following a single immunization using pseudoviruses expressing the wild-type Spike protein or the 8 amino acid mutations found in the B.1.1.7 spike protein. The vaccine sera exhibited a broad range of neutralising titres against the wild-type pseudoviruses that were modestly reduced against B.1.1.7 variant. This reduction was also evident in sera from some convalescent patients. Decreased B.1.1.7 neutralisation was also observed with monoclonal antibodies targeting the N-terminal domain (9 out of 10), the Receptor Binding Motif (RBM) (5 out of 31), but not in neutralising mAbs binding outside the RBM.

The hemolymph of Spodoptera litura larvae infected with the bi-cistronic baculovirus was collected for the purification of the recombinant HA1, which was found to be glycosylated, and monomeric and trimeric forms of the recombinant HA1 were identified. Proteins expressed in both the cell culture and larvae served as effective subunit vaccines for the production of antiserum against HA. The antiserum recognized the H6 subtype of AIV but not the H5 subtype.","Hsieh, Ming-Shou; He, Jie-Long; Wu, Tzong-Yuan; Juang, Rong-Huay",J Immunol Methods,107,1

These presumed abnormalities in hemostasis have been associated with filter clotting during continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). The incidence, clinical features, and treatment strategies to address severe filter clotting in patients with COVID-19 is unknown. Aim: We aimed to characterize the burden of CRRT filter clotting in patients with COVID-19 infection and to describe a CRRT anticoagulation protocol that used anti-factor Xa levels for systemic heparin dosing. Methods: Consecutive patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection admitted between March 16, 2020 and April 27, 2020 who required CRRT were included in this multi-center retrospective study. Severe clotting was defined as >2 filter losses in 48 hours or one filter loss <8 hours into CRRT. Primary outcome was time to CRRT filter loss. Due to the unreliability of PTT levels in patients with COVID-19, a COVID-specific CRRT anticoagulation protocol (referred to as protocol henceforth) which dosed systemic unfractionated heparin (UFH) by anti-factor Xa levels was piloted at one center starting April 13, 2020. Given that there was no difference in the treatment plan from CRRT initiation to first filter loss between the two anticoagulation approaches, this period served as a run-in period. Time from first to second filter loss (where protocol patients were exposed to low systemic UFH dosing) and time from second to third filter loss (where protocol patients were exposed to high systemic UFH dosing) were analyzed with a log-rank test. Results: Sixty-five patients were analyzed, with 17 using the anti-factor Xa protocol to guide systemic heparin dosing whereas 48 were treated with standard of care anticoagulation dosed by PTT . There were no major differences between groups in age, sex, race, ethnicity, body mass index, or baseline medications. Fifty-seven out of 65 patients (88%) initiated CRRT for AKI, whereas 8/65 patients (12%) had end stage renal disease. At the time of CRRT initiation, 64/65 patients (98%) were mechanically ventilated, 22/65 patients (34%) required prone ventilation, and 59/65 patients (91%) were on intravenous vasopressors. Patients spent a median of 6 [2, 13] days on CRRT. Fifty-four out of 65 patients (83%) lost at least one filter. Median first filter survival time was 6.5 [2.5, 33.5] hours. There was no difference between groups in percentage who lost their first filter (88% vs. 81%), or second filter (73% vs. 72%). However, fewer patients in the protocol group lost their third filter (55% vs. 93%) resulting in a longer median third filter survival time (24 [15.1, 54.2] vs. 17.3 [9.5, 35.1] hours, p = 0.04), Figure 1. Conclusions: The rate of CRRT filter loss is high in COVID-19 infection. An anticoagulation protocol using systemic unfractionated heparin, dosed by anti-factor Xa levels is a reasonable approach to anticoagulation in this population.

Previous studies by our group and others have demonstrated that porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) infection could activate NF-κB in MARC-145 cells and alveolar macrophages. The nucleocapsid (N) protein was identified as an NF-κB activator among the structural proteins encoded by PRRSV; however, it remains unclear whether the nonstructural proteins (Nsps) contribute to NF-κB activation. In this study, we identified which Nsps can activate NF-κB and investigated the potential mechanism(s) by which they act. RESULTS: By screening the individual Nsps of PRRSV strain WUH3, Nsp2 exhibited great potential to activate NF-κB in MARC-145 and HeLa cells. Overexpression of Nsp2 induced IκBα degradation and nuclear translocation of NF-κB. Furthermore, Nsp2 also induced NF-κB-dependent inflammatory factors, including interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, COX-2, and RANTES. Compared with the Nsp2 of the classical PRRSV strain, the Nsp2 of highly pathogenic PRRSV (HP-PRRSV) strains that possess a 30 amino acid (aa) deletion in Nsp2 displayed greater NF-κB activation. However, the 30-aa deletion was demonstrated to not be associated with NF-κB activation. Further functional domain analyses revealed that the hypervariable region (HV) of Nsp2 was essential for NF-κB activation. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these data indicate that PRRSV Nsp2 is a multifunctional protein participating in the modulation of host inflammatory response, which suggests an important role of Nsp2 in pathogenesis and disease outcomes.","Fang, Ying; Fang, Liurong; Wang, Yang; Lei, Yingying; Luo, Rui; Wang, Dang; Chen, Huanchun; Xiao, Shaobo",Virol J,107,3

Projections of rising greenhouse gas emissions suggest increasing direct and indirect burden of infectious and noninfectious disease, effects on food and water security, and other societal disruptions. As the effects of climate change cannot be isolated from social and ecological determinants of disease that will mitigate or exacerbate forecasted health outcomes, multidisciplinary collaboration is critically needed. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this article was to review the links between climate change and its upstream drivers (ie, processes leading to greenhouse gas emissions) and health outcomes, and identify existing opportunities to leverage more integrated global health and climate actions to prevent, prepare for, and respond to anthropogenic pressures. METHODS: We conducted a literature review of current and projected health outcomes associated with climate change, drawing on findings and our collective expertise to review opportunities for adaptation and mitigation across disciplines. FINDINGS: Health outcomes related to climate change affect a wide range of stakeholders, providing ready collaborative opportunities for interventions, which can be differentiated by addressing the upstream drivers leading to climate change or the downstream effects of climate change itself. CONCLUSIONS: Although health professionals are challenged with risks from climate change and its drivers, the adverse health outcomes cannot be resolved by the public health community alone. A phase change in global health is needed to move from a passive responder in partnership with other societal sectors to drive innovative alternatives. It is essential for global health to step outside of its traditional boundaries to engage with other stakeholders to develop policy and practical solutions to mitigate disease burden of climate change and its drivers; this will also yield compound benefits that help address other health, environmental, and societal challenges.","Machalaba, Catherine; Romanelli, Cristina; Stoett, Peter; Baum, Sarah E.; Bouley, Timothy A.; Daszak, Peter; Karesh, William B.",Ann Glob Health,107,20

The objective of this study is to determine the scientific community’s response patterns to COVID-19 through a bibliometric analysis of the time-trends, global contribution, international collaboration, open-access provision, science domains of focus, and the behavior of journals. METHODS: The bibliographic records on COVID-19 literature were retrieved from both PubMed and Scopus. The period for searching was set from November 1, 2019, to April 15, 2021. The bibliographic data were coupled with COVID-19 incidence to explore possible association, as well as World Bank indicators and classification of economies. RESULTS: A total of 159132 records were included in the study. Following the escalation of incidences of COVID-19 in late 2020 and early 2021, the monthly publication count made a new peak in March 2021 at 20505. Overall, 125155 (78.6%) were national, 22548 (14.2%) were bi-national, and 11429 (7.2%) were multi-national. Low-income countries with 928 (66.8%) international publications had the highest percentage of international. The open-access provision decreased from 85.5% in February 2020 to 62.0% in April 2021. As many as 82841 (70.8%) publications were related to health sciences, followed by life sciences 27031 (23.1%), social sciences 20291 (17.3%), and physical sciences 15141 (12.9%). The top three medical subjects in publications were general internal medicine, public health, and infectious diseases with 28.9%, 18.3%, and 12.6% of medical publications, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The association between the incidence and publication count indicated the scientific community’s interest in the ongoing situation and timely response to it. Only one-fifth of publications resulted from international collaboration, which might lead to redundancy without adding significant value. Our study underscores the necessity of policies for attraction of international collaboration and direction of vital funds toward domains of higher priority.","Malekpour, Mohammad-Reza; Abbasi-Kangevari, Mohsen; Azadnajafabad, Sina; Ghamari, Seyyed-Hadi; Rezaei, Negar; Rezazadeh-Khadem, Sahba; Rezaei, Nazila; Aminorroaya, Arya; Abdolhamidi, Elham; Mohammadi Fateh, Sahar; Haghshenas, Rosa; Roshani, Shahin; Ahmadi, Naser; Jamshidi, Kosar; Naderimagham, Shohreh; Farzadfar, Farshad",PLoS One,107,16

The study aimed to investigate the epidemiological characteristics of infectious diseases after lung transplantation in the current era. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All patients who underwent lung or heart–lung transplantation at our institution between October 29, 2008 and April 3, 2019 were enrolled. We retrospectively reviewed the patients' medical records till April 2, 2020. RESULTS: In total, 100 consecutive lung transplant recipients were enrolled. The median follow-up period was 28 months after lung transplantation. A total of 127 post–lung transplantation bacterial infections occurred. Catheter-related bloodstream infection (25/84, 29.8%) was the most common within 6 months and pneumonia (23/43, 53.5%) was the most common after 6 months. Most episodes (35/40, 87.5%) of respiratory viral infections occurred after 6 months, mainly as upper respiratory infections. The remaining episodes (5/40, 12.5%) mostly manifested as lower respiratory tract infections. Seventy cytomegalovirus infections observed in 43 patients were divided into 23 episodes occurring before and 47 episodes occurring after discontinuing prophylaxis. Of 10 episodes of cytomegalovirus disease, four occurred during prophylaxis and six occurred after prophylaxis. Of 23 episodes of post–lung transplantation fungal infection, 7 were aspergillosis and all occurred after the discontinuation of prophylaxis. CONCLUSION: Lung transplant recipients experienced a high burden of infection even after 6 months, especially after the end of the prophylaxis period.

We used data on age, ethnicity, deprivation index, pre-existing health conditions, and clinical outcomes on 1,829 COVID-19 cases reported in New Zealand. We used a logistic regression model to calculate odds ratios for the risk of hospitalisation by ethnicity. We also consider length of hospital stay and risk of fatality. Results. M[a]ori have 2.5 times greater odds of hospitalisation than non-M[a]ori, non-Pacific people, after controlling for age and pre-existing conditions. Similarly, Pacific people have 3 times greater odds. Conclusions. Structural inequities and systemic racism in the healthcare system mean that M[a]ori and Pacific communities face a much greater health burden from COVID-19. Older people and those with pre-existing health conditions are also at greater risk. This should inform future policy decisions including prioritising groups for vaccination.","Steyn, N.; Binny, R.

We aimed to examine the psychological impact of the MCO among clinical undergraduates. A cross-sectional study was conducted using self-reported questionnaires that were distributed online using the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 (DASS 21), Short Warwick Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale (SWEMWBS), and the newly designed MCO effect questionnaire. Seven hundred seventy-two students completed the survey. The prevalence of psychological distress was 52.8%, with around 60% of respondents reporting disruption to their daily lives. Older (p = 0.015) and more senior students (p < 0.001) were less likely to be anxious than their younger and junior counterparts, respectively. A greater number of social support (three or more) was linked to a lower score of depression (p = 0.005) and stress (p = 0.045). Undergraduates who received family support demonstrated lower depression scores (p = 0.037) and higher mental wellbeing (p = 0.020) compared to those without. Government support was independently associated with a lesser risk of depressive symptoms (Adjusted odds ratio, AOR 0.68; 95% confidence interval, CI 0.47–0.99) and a greater sense of mental wellbeing (AOR 1.54; 95% CI 1.06–2.22). The present finding provides evidence of a high prevalence of psychological distress among clinical undergraduates during the COVID-19 pandemic. Appropriate social support is important in alleviating anxiety and stress and promoting greater mental wellbeing amongst students during the nationwide quarantine.","Kalok, Aida; Sharip, Shalisah; Abdul Hafizz, Abdul Muzhill; Zainuddin, Zulkifli Md; Shafiee, Mohamad Nasir",Int J Environ Res Public Health,107,1

This means of monitoring for outbreaks has been used at municipal wastewater treatment centers to analyze COVID-19 trends in entire communities, as well as by universities and other community living environments to monitor COVID-19 spread in buildings. Sample concentration is crucial, especially when viral abundance in raw wastewater is below the threshold of detection by RT-qPCR analysis. We evaluated the performance of a rapid ultrafiltration-based virus concentration method using InnovaPrep Cp Select pipette tips and compared this to the established electronegative membrane filtration (EMF) method. We evaluated the sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 quantification, surrogate virus recovery rate, and sample processing time. Results suggest that the Cp Select concentrator is more efficient at concentrating SARS-CoV-2 from wastewater compared to the EMF method. 30% of samples that tested negative when concentrated with the EMF method produced a positive signal with the Cp Select protocol. Increased recovery of the surrogate virus control using the Cp Select confirms this observation. We optimized the Cp Select protocol by adding AVL lysis buffer and sonication, to increase the recovery of virus. Sonication increased BCoV recovery by 19%, which seems to compensate for viral loss during centrifugation. Filtration time decreases by approximately 30% when using the Cp Select protocol, making this an optimal choice for building surveillance applications where a quick turnaround time is necessary.","Juel, M.

The reason is that in recent decades, infectious diseases such as HIV/SIDA, SARS and Influenza have shown that we need new approaches and concepts in order to understand how biological emergencies and health alerts deploy new scales of action. Especially relevant has been the case of A(H1N1) influenza. This reached the status of global threat virtually from its onset, triggering an international response with a diffusion, visibility and rapidity unparalleled in previous health alerts. This article maintains that this global condition cannot be explained solely by the epidemiologic characteristics of the disease, such as mortality rate, severe cases, propagation capacity, etc. Resorting to the approach proposed by the Actor-Network Theory (ANT), this paper suggests that the action of certain socio-technical operators was what built a heterogeneous network of ideas, concepts and materials that turned the A (H1N1) influenza into a global-scale phenomenon with unprecedented speed. Among these operators, the most important ones were: the speaking position, a discourse about threat, the protocols and guidelines that were used and, lastly, the maps that allowed a real-time monitoring of the influenza. The paper ends with the notion of panorama, as defined by Bruno Latour: a suggestion to describe the common denominator of the aforementioned operators, and a means to foresee the development of global scales for certain health alerts. The paper will conclude by proposing that this type of analysis would allow the One World One Health to understand with greater precision the dynamic of epidemics and thus make its principles of action much more specific as well as its definition of what global health should be.","Tirado, Francisco; Gómez, Andrés; Rocamora, Verónica",Soc Sci Med,107,1

AIMS To evaluate the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiologic findings and the clinical outcomes of children who were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and to evaluate the effect of the trends in intervention measures. STUDY DESIGN Between April 2, 2020 and January 16, 2021, children aged 0-18 years who had presented at the pediatric emergency department and were diagnosed with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 by PCR were enrolled. METHODS Details on demographics, epidemiologic characteristics, clinical findings, laboratory data, and radiologic investigations, hospital admissions, and prognosis were recorded. According to clinical severity, patients were divided into 5 groups as asymptomatic, mild, moderate, severe, or critical. We classified the outbreak into 3 periods. The first was between April 2, 2020, the date when the first pediatric case of our hospital was detected, and June 1, 2020, when restrictive measures were relaxed. The second period was between June 1, 2020 and November 15, 2020, when restrictive measures were reimplemented. The third period was between November 15, 2020 and January 16, 2021. RESULTS A total of 600 patients [median age: 10.3 years (IQR: 4.4-15.1); 304 females] were enrolled. Among them, 25.0% were asymptomatic, while the 3 most common symptoms among symptomatic cases were fever, cough, and fatigue. There was contact with a COVID-19 PCRpositive individual in 73.5% of the cases, with 76.6% of those being a household contact. There were 23 (3.9%) moderate, severe, or critical cases in terms of clinical severity. The presence of chronic disease, a pathological physical chest examination, and procalcitonin levels of >0.05 ng/mL were identified as predictors of being moderate, severe, or critical. Twenty-four (4.0%) patients were admitted to the hospital; 14 (2.3%) to the ward and 10 (1.6%) to the pediatric intensive care unit. In the second intervention period, we observed a rapidly increasing number of new cases daily, especially in August. From September, an increase was observed, being particularly marked from October to November 18. Since then, there was a decrease in the daily number of cases. CONCLUSION The majority of the cases were asymptomatic or had a mild clinical presentation. The presence of chronic disease, a pathological physical chest examination, and procalcitonin levels of >0.05 ng/mL were identified as predictors of being moderate, severe, or critical in terms of clinical severity.

Le centre 1 est un service adulte généraliste à orientation otologique. Le centre 2 est un service adulte généraliste à orientation cancérologique. Le 3ème centre est exclusivement pédiatrique. Une analyse comparative de la baisse de l’activité chirurgicale a été effectuée entre 2019 et 2020. Objectif: Analyser la baisse de l’activité chirurgicale Résultats: Les 3 centres ont opéré 540 patients en 2019, versus 89 en 2020, soit une baisse de 84%. Cette diminution est de 89% dans le centre 1, de 61% dans le centre 2, et 95% dans le centre pédiatrique.

Le polmoniti nosocomiali acquisite sotto ventilazione meccanica (PNAVM) compaiono dopo almeno 48 ore di ventilazione meccanica invasiva. Il loro meccanismo è multifattoriale, ma predomina la nozione di inalazione che compare dopo una colonizzazione orofaringea, gastrica o tracheale. Il tempo di comparsa permette di classificare queste PNAVM come precoci o tardive a seconda che compaiano prima o dopo il 5° giorno di ventilazione meccanica. La diagnosi può essere aiutata dalla clinica, essenzialmente grazie al punteggio CPIS (Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score), e dal lavaggio broncoalveolare (BAL), che sembra l’esame più utile per la diagnosi microbiologica. La diagnosi differenziale con una pneumopatia non batterica o anche non infettiva (neoplastica, infiammatoria, fibrotica) o la ricerca di un altro focolaio infettivo devono sempre essere discusse in funzione dell’orientamento clinico iniziale o del fallimento della terapia antibiotica. Il ricorso preferenziale alla ventilazione non invasiva, quando possibile, sembra utile per prevenire l’insorgenza di una pneumopatia nosocomiale. La posizione semiseduta del paziente a 30–45° è la sola misura profilattica veramente validata di prevenzione delle PNAVM. Il trattamento curativo delle polmoniti batteriche si basa in genere su una doppia terapia antibiotica. Quest’ultima può essere orientata dai dati di prelievi non invasivi, come le aspirazioni tracheali, realizzate in modo periodico e sistematico. La durata del trattamento è discussa, ma gli ultimi dati sono in favore di una terapia antibiotica relativamente breve, di 8 giorni.","Donati, S. Y.; Papazian, L.",EMC - Anestesia-Rianimazione,107,1

Given the lack of specific antiviral therapies, application of human convalescent plasma retaining neutralizing activity could be a viable therapeutic option that can bridge this gap. METHODS: We traced antibody responses and memory B cells in peripheral blood collected from 70 recovered MERS-CoV patients for three years after the 2015 outbreak in South Korea. We also used a mouse infection model to examine whether the neutralizing activity of collected sera could provide therapeutic benefit in vivo upon lethal MERS-CoV challenge. RESULTS: Anti-spike-specific IgG responses, including neutralizing activity and antibody-secreting memory B cells, persisted for up to 3 years, especially in MERS patients that suffered from severe pneumonia. Mean antibody titers gradually decreased annually by less than two fold. Levels of antibody responses were significantly correlated with fever duration, viral shedding periods, and maximum viral loads observed during infection periods. In a transgenic mice model challenged with lethal doses of MERS-CoV, a significant reduction in viral loads and enhanced survival was observed when therapeutically treated with human plasma retaining high neutralizing titer (> 1/5,000). However, this failed to reduce pulmonary pathogenesis, as revealed by pathological changes in lungs and initial weight loss. CONCLUSIONS: High titers of neutralizing activity are required for suppressive effect on the viral replication but may not be sufficient to reduce inflammatory lesions upon fatal infection. Therefore, immune sera with high neutralizing activity must be carefully selected for plasma therapy of zoonotic coronavirus infection.","Kim, Yeon-Sook; Aigerim, Abdimadiyeva; Park, Uni; Kim, Yuri; Park, Hyoree; Rhee, Ji-Young; Choi, Jae-Phil; Park, Wan Beom; Park, Sang Won; Kim, Yeonjae; Lim, Dong-Gyun; Choi, Ji-Yeob; Jeon, Yoon Kyung; Yang, Jeong-Sun; Lee, Joo-Yeon; Shin, Hyoung-Shik; Cho, Nam-Hyuk",Clin Infect Dis,107,10

However, its sensitivity might be suboptimal. The current study aims to investigate predictive factors for false-negative nasopharyngeal RT-PCR in CoViD-19 patients. Additionally, the specificity and sensitivity of RT-PCR on the nasopharyngeal swab, serology and chest computerized-tomography (CCT) as a screening tool for the diagnosis of CoViD-19 were investigated. METHODS Medical records of patients admitted at the university hospital UZ Brussel during the CoViD-19 epidemic were reviewed. A group of CoViD-19 patients with false-negative RT-PCR was identified through scrupulous examination of medical records. Serological testing was performed through chemiluminescent microparticle assay. RESULTS Eighteen CoViD-19 patients with 'false negative' RT-PCR were identified and compared to 51 'true positives'. Logistic regression for prediction of 'false negative' RT-PCR found significantly higher serology results at hospitalization and more intensive care unit admission in the group with false-negative testing. In a cohort of 228 patients, the sensitivity of RT-PCR for the diagnosis of CoViD-19 was 85%. The sensitivity of serology was 86% and its specificity 92%. Chest computerized-tomography (CCT) showed a sensitivity of 93%, its specificity was 62%. By combining RT-PCR and serology results any 'false negative' could be excluded. CONCLUSIONS In this cohort, the sensitivity and specificity of RT-PCR and serology for the diagnosis of CoViD-19 were high and comparable. CCT had the highest sensitivity and confirmed its efficacy as a screening tool. CoViD-19 patients, who have a more severe presentation, might have negative RT-PCR and positive serology results.","Moretti, Marco; Van Laethem, Johan; De Geyter, Deborah; Cools, Wilfried; Ilsen, Bart; Allard, Sabine Danielle; Pierard, Denis",Infectious diseases,107,28

A full-scale experiment using Bacillus subtilis and computational fluid dynamics were utilized to model the bioaerosol characteristics in a two-bed hospital ward with a constant air change rate (12 ACH). The results indicated that the bioaerosol removal efficiency of unilateral downward ventilation was 50% higher than that of bilateral downward ventilation. Additionally, health care workers (HCWs) and nearby patients had lower breathing zone concentrations in the ward with unilateral downward ventilation. Furthermore, a partition played a positive role in protecting patients by reducing the amount of bioaerosol exposure. However, no obvious protective effect was observed with respect to the HCWs. Only 10% of the bioaerosol was deposited on the surfaces in the ward with unilateral downward ventilation, while up to 35% of the bioaerosol was deposited on the surfaces in the ward with bilateral downward ventilation during the 900 s. The main deposition locations of the bioaerosols were near the wall on the same side of the room as the patient's head in all cases. This study could provide scientific evidence for controlling cross-infection in hospital wards, as well as several guidelines for the disinfection of hospital wards.","Liu, Zhijian; Wang, Liangqi; Rong, Rui; Fu, Shifeng; Cao, Guoqing; Hao, Cuicai",Build Environ,107,20

A buffer with the ability to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 at the time of sample collection could simplify and expand testing for COVID-19 to non-conventional settings. METHODS: We evaluated a guanidium thiocyanate-based buffer, eNAT(™) (Copan) as a possible transport and inactivation medium for downstream RT-PCR testing to detect SARS-CoV-2. Inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020 in eNAT and in diluted saliva was studied at different incubation times. The stability of viral RNA in eNAT was also evaluated for up to 7 days at room temperature (28°C), refrigerated conditions (4°C) and at 35°C. RESULTS: SARS-COV-2 virus spiked directly in eNAT could be inactivated at >5.6 log(10) PFU/ml within a minute of incubation. When saliva was diluted 1:1 in eNAT, no cytopathic effect (CPE) on vero-E6 cell lines was observed, although SARS-CoV-2 RNA could be detected even after 30 min incubation and after two cell culture passages. A 1:2 (saliva:eNAT) dilution abrogated both CPE and detectable viral RNA after as little as 5 min incubation in eNAT. SARS-CoV-2 RNA from virus spiked at 5X the limit of detection remained positive up to 7 days of incubation in all tested conditions. CONCLUSION: eNAT and similar guanidinium thiocyanate-based media may be of value for transport, preservation, and processing of clinical samples for RT- PCR based SARS-CoV-2 detection.","Banik, Sukalyani; Saibire, Kaheerman; Suryavanshi, Shraddha; Johns, Glenn; Chakravorty, Soumitesh; Kwiatkowski, Robert; Alland, David; Banada, Padmapriya",medRxiv,107,8

Recently, there has been an increasing body of evidence focusing on the opioid-sparing effects of medical cannabis use (reduction of opioid use and reliance), and medical cannabis as a potential alternative treatment for chronic pain. The objective of this study is to assess the effect of medical cannabis authorization on opioid use (oral morphine equivalent; OME) between 2013 and 2018 in Alberta, Canada. METHODS: All adult patients defined as chronic opioid users who were authorized medical cannabis by their health care provider in Alberta, Canada from 2013 to 2018 were propensity score matched to non-authorized chronic opioid using controls. A total of 5373 medical cannabis patients were matched to controls, who were all chronic opioid users. The change in the weekly average OME of opioid drugs for medical cannabis patients relative to controls was measured. Interrupted time series (ITS) analyses was used to assess the trend change in OME during the 26 weeks (6 months) before and 52 weeks (1 year) after the authorization of medical cannabis among adult chronic opioid users. RESULTS: Average age was 52 years and 54% were female. Patients on low dose opioids (< 50 OME) had an increase in their weekly OME per week (absolute increase of 112.1 OME, 95% CI: 104.1 to 120.3); whereas higher dose users (OME > 100), showed a significant decrease over 6 months (− 435.5, 95% CI: − 596.8 to − 274.2) compared to controls. CONCLUSIONS: This short-term study found that medical cannabis authorization showed intermediate effects on opioid use, which was dependent on initial opioid use. Greater observations of changes in OME appear to be in those patients who were on a high dosage of opioids (OME > 100); however, continued surveillance of patients utilizing both opioids and medical cannabis is warranted by clinicians to understand the long-term potential benefits and any harms of ongoing use.

The pandemic may increase the rate of intercurrent events (ICEs) and missing values, spurring a great deal of discussion on amending protocols and statistical analysis plans to address these issues. In this article, we revisit recent research on estimands and handling of missing values, especially the ICH E9 (R1) Addendum on Estimands and Sensitivity Analysis in Clinical Trials. Based on an in-depth discussion of the strategies for handling ICEs using a causal inference framework, we suggest some improvements in applying the estimand and estimation framework in ICH E9 (R1). Specifically, we discuss a mix of strategies allowing us to handle ICEs differentially based on reasons for ICEs. We also suggest ICEs should be handled primarily by hypothetical strategies and provide examples of different hypothetical strategies for different types of ICEs as well as a road map for estimation and sensitivity analyses. We conclude that the proposed framework helps streamline translating clinical objectives into targets of statistical inference and automatically resolves many issues with defining estimands and choosing estimation procedures arising from events such as the pandemic.","Qu, Yongming; Lipkovich, Ilya",Ther Innov Regul Sci,107,29

It is not the first time, nor will it be last, that our increasingly globalized world has been significantly affected by the emergence of a new disease. In much of the Northern Hemisphere, the academic year begins in September, and for many countries, September 2020 marked the return to full schooling after some period of enforced closure due to COVID‐19. In this paper, we focus on the airborne spread of disease and investigate the likelihood of transmission in school environments. It is crucial to understand the risk airborne infection from COVID‐19 might pose to pupils, teachers, and their wider social groups. We use monitored CO(2) data from 45 classrooms in 11 different schools from within the UK to estimate the likelihood of infection occurring within classrooms regularly attended by the same staff and pupils. We determine estimates of the number of secondary infections arising via the airborne route over pre/asymptomatic periods on a rolling basis. Results show that, assuming relatively quiet desk‐based work, the number of secondary infections is likely to remain reassuringly below unity; however, it can vary widely between classrooms of the same school even when the same ventilation system is present. Crucially, the data highlight significant variation with the seasons with January being nearly twice as risky as July. We show that such seasonal variations in risk due to changes in ventilation rates are robust and our results hold for wide variations in disease parameterizations, suggesting our results may be applied to a number of different airborne diseases.","Vouriot, Carolanne V.

Trauma and orthopaedic services are no different. A fundamentally important and significant portion of trauma services is the treatment of fragility fractures of the proximal femur, otherwise known as hip fractures. The hip fracture “Blue book Standards”, the key performance indicators (KPIs) associated with appropriate hip fracture care are challenging during non-crisis times. We aim to review Blue Book compliance during the Covid-19 crisis and review outcomes of hip fractures, including Covid-19 infection rates. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed IHFD data to collection demographic data, IHFD standards of care, 30-day mortality rates and complications between 23rd March and 20th May 2020 and 2019. Covid-19 rates in 2020 were also recorded. RESULTS: A total of 36 hip fractures were recorded in 2020, compared with 45 in 2019, resulting in a 20% reduction in presentations. Thirty-day mortality in hip fractures during the Covid-19 crisis was 8.3% compared with 2.2% in 2020. Covid-19 infection was statistically associated with 30-day mortality in the 2020 cohort. Statistically significant improvements in time-dependent KPIs (time to ward and time to surgery) were noted in the 2020 cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Despite improvements in hip fracture care KPIs, the Covid-19 crisis was associated with increased 30-day mortality in hip fracture patients. A positive Covid-19 swab was associated with higher mortality. These observations are of paramount importance to ensure adequate service planning and provision in the face of a potential “second wave” of Covid-19 infections leading into the winter months of 2020.","Crozier-Shaw, Geoff; Hughes, Andrew J.; Conlon, Breda; Sheehan, Eoin; Merghani, Khalid",Ir J Med Sci,107,20

Considering that sialic acids play important roles in immunity, we determined the presence of sialic acid types in coelomocytes of Paracentrotus lividus. Homogenized coelomocytes were kept in 2 M aqueous acetic acid at 80 °C for 3 h to liberate sialic acids.

METHODS: Age-standardized incidence rates (ASRs) of cancers in 2012 were compared between urban Shijiazhuang city and rural Shexian County, and trends from 2000-2015 in Shexian County were analyzed. FINDINGS: Compared with urban Shijiazhuang city, the ASR of gastroesophageal cancers in rural Shexian County was 5.3 times higher in men (234.1 vs 44.2/100,000, P < .01) and 9.1 times higher in women (107.7 vs 11.8/100,000, P < .01). This rural-urban disparity in UGIC is associated with differences in socioeconomic development in annual gross domestic product (GDP) per capita of US$2700 vs US$6965, in urbanization rate of 48% vs 100%, and in adult Helicobacter pylori infection prevalence of 75% vs 50%. From 2000-2015, the GDP per capita in Shexian County increased from US$860 to US$3000, urbanization rate increased from 22.4% to 54.8%, and prevalence of H pylori infection among 3- to 10-year-old children decreased from 60% to 46.1% (P < .01). Meanwhile, the biennial ASR of esophagogastric cancer decreased 42% in men, from 313.5 to 182.1 per 100,000 (P < .01), and 57% in women, from 188.6 to 80.4 per 100,000 (P = .00).

We performed a comparative genomic analysis of 70 ACE2 placental mammal orthologues to identify variations and contribute to the understanding of evolutionary dynamics behind this successful adaptation to infect humans. Our results reveal that 4% of the ACE2 sites are under positive selection, all located in the catalytic domain, suggesting possibly taxon-specific adaptations related to the ACE2 function, such as cardiovascular physiology. Considering all variable sites, we selected 30 of them located at the critical ACE2 binding sites to the SARS-CoV-like viruses for analysis in more detail. Our results reveal a relatively high diversity of ACE2 between placental mammal species, while showing no polymorphism within human populations, at least considering the 30 inter-species variable sites.

The automation of the diagnosis of this virus is highly desired. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown outstanding classification performance on image datasets. To date, it appears that COVID computer-aided diagnosis systems based on CNNs and clinical information have not yet been analysed or explored. We propose a novel method, named the CNN-AE, to predict the survival chance of COVID-19 patients using a CNN trained with clinical information. Notably, the required resources to prepare CT images are expensive and limited compared to those required to collect clinical data, such as blood pressure, liver disease, etc. We evaluated our method using a publicly available clinical dataset that we collected. The dataset properties were carefully analysed to extract important features and compute the correlations of features. A data augmentation procedure based on autoencoders (AEs) was proposed to balance the dataset. The experimental results revealed that the average accuracy of the CNN-AE (96.05%) was higher than that of the CNN (92.49%). To demonstrate the generality of our augmentation method, we trained some existing mortality risk prediction methods on our dataset (with and without data augmentation) and compared their performances. We also evaluated our method using another dataset for further generality verification. To show that clinical data can be used for COVID-19 survival chance prediction, the CNN-AE was compared with multiple pre-trained deep models that were tuned based on CT images.","Khozeimeh, Fahime; Sharifrazi, Danial; Izadi, Navid Hoseini; Joloudari, Javad Hassannataj; Shoeibi, Afshin; Alizadehsani, Roohallah; Gorriz, Juan M.; Hussain, Sadiq; Sani, Zahra Alizadeh; Moosaei, Hossein; Khosravi, Abbas; Nahavandi, Saeid; Islam, Sheikh Mohammed Shariful",Sci Rep,107,20

The main goal of the analysis is to empirically separate voluntary reductions in mobility driven by the information about the location-specific pandemic trends from the effects of the government-imposed social distancing mandates. Google human mobility dataset is used to track the dynamics of mobility across a wide range of categories (e.g. workplace, retail and recreational activities, etc), while information on country-specific counts of COVID-19 cases and deaths is used as a proxy for the information about the spread of the pandemic available to the population. A detailed index of stringency of the government-imposed social distancing policies in around 100 countries is used as a measure of government response. We find that human mobility does respond in a significant way to the information about the spread of the pandemic. This channel can explain about 15 percentage points of the overall reduction in mobility across the affected countries. At the same time, our results imply that government-imposed policies account for the majority of the reduction in the mobility observed during this period.","Mendolia, Silvia; Stavrunova, Olena; Yerokhin, Oleg",J Econ Behav Organ,107,30

METHODS: Eighty‐nine intensive care unit (ICU) patients with confirmed COVID‐19 were prospectively enrolled and tracked. Point‐of‐care ultrasound (POCUS) examinations were performed with phased array, convex, and linear transducers using portable machines. The thorax was scanned in 12 lung areas: anterior, lateral, and posterior (superior/inferior) bilaterally. Lower limbs were scanned for deep venous thrombosis and chest computed tomographic angiography was performed to exclude suspected pulmonary embolism (PE). Follow‐up POCUS was performed weekly and before hospital discharge. RESULTS: Patients were predominantly male (84.2%), with a median age of 43 years. The median duration of mechanical ventilation was 17 (interquartile range, 10–22) days; the ICU length of stay was 22 (interquartile range, 20.2–25.2) days; and the 28‐day mortality rate was 28.1%. On ICU admission, POCUS detected bilateral irregular pleural lines (78.6%) with accompanying confluent and separate B‐lines (100%), variable consolidations (61.7%), and pleural and cardiac effusions (22.4% and 13.4%, respectively). These findings appeared to signify a late stage of COVID‐19 pneumonia. Deep venous thrombosis was identified in 16.8% of patients, whereas chest computed tomographic angiography confirmed PE in 24.7% of patients. Five to six weeks after ICU admission, follow‐up POCUS examinations detected significantly lower rates (P < .05) of lung abnormalities in survivors. CONCLUSIONS: Point‐of‐care ultrasound depicted B‐lines, pleural line irregularities, and variable consolidations. Lung ultrasound findings were significantly decreased by ICU discharge, suggesting persistent but slow resolution of at least some COVID‐19 lung lesions. Although POCUS identified deep venous thrombosis in less than 20% of patients at the bedside, nearly one‐fourth of all patients were found to have computed tomography–proven PE.","Alharthy, Abdulrahman; Faqihi, Fahad; Abuhamdah, Mohamed; Noor, Alfateh; Naseem, Nasir; Balhamar, Abdullah; Al Saud, Ahad Alhassan Al Saud Bin Abdulaziz; Brindley, Peter G.; Memish, Ziad A.; Karakitsos, Dimitrios; Blaivas, Michael",J Ultrasound Med,107,20

Hydroxychloroquine was found to decrease the viral replication in a concentration-dependent manner in vitro and to be more active when added prior to the viral challenge. A loading dose is used to rapidly attain a target drug concentration, which is usually considered as approximately the steady-state concentration. With a loading dose, the minimum effective concentration is reached much more rapidly than when using only the maintenance dose from the start. Thus, we propose a hydroxychloroquine sulphate dose regimen of 400 mg twice daily at Day 1 then 400 mg once daily from Day 2 to Day 10. We aim to evaluate this in the C-20-15 DisCoVeRy trial.","Lê, Minh Patrick; Peiffer-Smadja, Nathan; Guedj, Jeremie; Néant, Nadège; Mentré, France; Ader, Florence; Yazdanpanah, Yazdan; Peytavin, Gilles",J Antimicrob Chemother,107,8

Not all health care providers and patients are equally ready to take part in the telehealth revolution, which raises concerns for health equity during and after the COVID‐19 pandemic. Without proactive efforts to address both patient‐ and provider‐related digital barriers associated with socioeconomic status, the wide‐scale implementation of telehealth amid COVID‐19 may reinforce disparities in health access in already marginalized and underserved communities. To ensure greater telehealth equity, policy changes should address barriers faced overwhelmingly by marginalized patient populations and those who serve them. CONTEXT: The COVID‐19 pandemic has catalyzed fundamental shifts across the US health care delivery system, including a rapid transition to telehealth. Telehealth has many potential advantages, including maintaining critical access to care while keeping both patients and providers safe from unnecessary exposure to the coronavirus. However, not all health care providers and patients are equally ready to take part in this digital revolution, which raises concerns for health equity during and after the COVID‐19 pandemic. METHODS: The study analyzed data about small primary care practices’ telehealth use and barriers to telehealth use collected from rapid‐response surveys administered by the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene's Bureau of Equitable Health Systems and New York University from mid‐April through mid‐June 2020 as part of the city's efforts to understand how primary care practices were responding to the COVID‐19 pandemic following New York State's stay‐at‐home order on March 22. We focused on small primary care practices because they represent 40% of primary care providers and are disproportionately located in low‐income, minority or immigrant areas that were more severely impacted by COVID‐19. To examine whether telehealth use and barriers differed based on the socioeconomic characteristics of the communities served by these practices, we used the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) to stratify respondents as being in high‐SVI or low‐SVI areas. We then characterized respondents’ telehealth use and barriers to adoption by using means and proportions with 95% confidence intervals. In addition to a primary analysis using pooled data across the five waves of the survey, we performed sensitivity analyses using data from respondents who only took one survey, first wave only, and the last two waves only. FINDINGS: While all providers rapidly shifted to telehealth, there were differences based on community characteristics in both the primary mode of telehealth used and the types of barriers experienced by providers. Providers in high‐SVI areas were almost twice as likely as providers in low‐SVI areas to use telephones as their primary telehealth modality (41.7% vs 23.8%; P <.001). The opposite was true for video, which was used as the primary telehealth modality by 18.7% of providers in high‐SVI areas and 33.7% of providers in low‐SVI areas (P <0.001). Providers in high‐SVI areas also faced more patient‐related barriers and fewer provider‐related barriers than those in low‐SVI areas. CONCLUSIONS: Between April and June 2020, telehealth became a prominent mode of primary care delivery in New York City. However, the transition to telehealth did not unfold in the same manner across communities. To ensure greater telehealth equity, policy changes should address barriers faced overwhelmingly by marginalized patient populations and those who serve them.","CHANG, JI E.; LAI, ALDEN YUANHONG; GUPTA, AVNI; NGUYEN, ANN M.; BERRY, CAROLYN A.; SHELLEY, DONNA R.",Milbank Q,107,21

Their replication machinery consists of an RdRp bound to viral RNA which is wound around a nucleoprotein (NP) scaffold, forming a viral ribonucleoprotein complex. NSV NP is known to regulate transcription and replication of genomic RNA; however, its role in maintaining and protecting the viral genetic material is unknown. Here, we exploited host microRNA expression to target NP of influenza A virus and Sendai virus to ascertain how this would impact genomic levels and the host response to infection. We find that in addition to inducing a drastic decrease in genome replication, the antiviral host response in the absence of NP is dramatically enhanced. Additionally, our data show that insufficient levels of NP prevent the replication machinery of these NSVs to process full-length genomes, resulting in aberrant replication products which form pathogen-associated molecular patterns in the process. These dynamics facilitate immune recognition by cellular pattern recognition receptors leading to a strong host antiviral response. Moreover, we observe that the consequences of limiting NP levels are universal among NSVs, including Ebola virus, Lassa virus, and measles virus. Overall, these results provide new insights into viral genome replication of negative-sense RNA viruses and highlight novel avenues for developing effective antiviral strategies, adjuvants, and/or live-attenuated vaccines. IMPORTANCE Negative-sense RNA viruses comprise some of the most important known human pathogens, including influenza A virus, measles virus, and Ebola virus. These viruses possess RNA genomes that are unreadable to the host, as they require specific viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases in conjunction with other viral proteins, such as nucleoprotein, to be replicated and transcribed. As this process generates a significant amount of pathogen-associated molecular patterns, this phylum of viruses can result in a robust induction of the intrinsic host cellular response. To circumvent these defenses, these viruses form tightly regulated ribonucleoprotein replication complexes in order to protect their genomes from detection and to prevent excessive aberrant replication. Here, we demonstrate the balance that negative-sense RNA viruses must achieve both to replicate efficiently and to avoid induction of the host defenses.","Nilsson-Payant, Benjamin E.; Blanco-Melo, Daniel; Uhl, Skyler; Escudero-Pérez, Beatriz; Olschewski, Silke; Thibault, Patricia; Panis, Maryline; Rosenthal, Maria; Muñoz-Fontela, César; Lee, Benhur; tenOever, Benjamin R.",J Virol,107,33

An important strategy consists of successful transmission by an infected host before the appearance of symptoms, that is, while the host is still partially or fully asymptomatic. During this initial stage of infection, it is possible for another pathogen to superinfect an already infected host and replace the previously infecting pathogen. Here, we study the effect of superinfection during the first stage of an infection on the evolutionary dynamics of the degree to which the host is asymptomatic (host latency) in that same stage. We find that superinfection can lead to major differences in evolutionary behaviour. Most strikingly, the duration of immunity following infection can significantly influence pathogen evolutionary dynamics, whereas without superinfection the outcomes are independent of host immunity. For example, changes in host immunity can drive evolutionary transitions from a fully symptomatic to a fully asymptomatic first infection stage. Additionally, if superinfection relative to susceptible infection is strong enough, evolution can lead to a unique strategy of latency that corresponds to a local fitness minimum, and is therefore invasible by nearby mutants. Thus, this strategy is a branching point, and can lead to coexistence of pathogens with different latencies. Furthermore, in this new framework with superinfection, we also find that there can exist two interior singular strategies. Overall, new evolutionary outcomes can cascade from superinfection.","Saad-Roy, Chadi M.; Grenfell, Bryan T.; Levin, Simon A.; Pellis, Lorenzo; Stage, Helena B.; van den Driessche, P.; Wingreen, Ned S.",R Soc Open Sci,107,1

National and international closures affect over 91% of the education community of the world. E-learning is the only effective manner for educational institutions to coordinate the learning process during the global lockdown and quarantine period. Many educational institutions have instructed their students through remote learning technologies to face the effect of local closures and promote the continuity of the education process. This study examines the expected benefits of e-learning during the COVID-19 pandemic by providing a new model to investigate this issue using a survey collected from the students at Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University. Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) was employed on 179 useable responses. This study applied Push-Pull-Mooring theory and examined how push, pull, and mooring variables impact learners to switch to virtual and remote educational laboratories. The Protection Motivation theory was employed to explain how the potential health risk and environmental threat can influence the expected benefits from e-learning services. The findings revealed that the push factor (environmental threat) is significantly related to perceived benefits. The pull factors (e-learning motivation, perceived information sharing, and social distancing) significantly impact learners' benefits. The mooring factor, namely perceived security, significantly impacts learners’ benefits.","Abumalloh, Rabab Ali; Asadi, Shahla; Nilashi, Mehrbakhsh; Minaei-Bidgoli, Behrouz; Nayer, Fatima Khan; Samad, Sarminah; Mohd, Saidatulakmal; Ibrahim, Othman",Technol Soc,107,23

However, our clinical experience supports “awake” epidural anaesthesia with sedation (EA + Sed) rather than EA + GA as a technique of choice for this type of surgery. METHODS: We used a standardised postoperative questionnaire to formally assess the experiences and outcomes for 50 patients who underwent free-flaps for LLOM under EA + Sed. FINDINGS: The mean duration of surgery was 522 min (8.7 h), range 240–875 min. There were no ITU admissions or flap failures. Postoperatively, fifty patients completed a standardised questionnaire about their experiences before the operation, in the anaesthetic room and theatre. 80% were aware of the procedure at least “some of the time”. 72.5% patients and 75% respectively, did not have any concerns in the anaesthetic room and theatre. Concerns expressed by the remaining patients were manageable. 97.5% of those patients who recalled their operation reported their overall experience as “comfortable” or “very comfortable”. 92% of respondents had undergone previous lower limb surgery under GA ± EA. In this subgroup, 91.3% reported the recovery after EA + Sed as “quicker” than GA, and 89.4% reported their experience with EA + Sed as “better”. All fifty patients (100%) were “satisfied” or “very satisfied” with their experience and all but one (98%) would recommend this technique to others. CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that despite prolonged duration, the patients' reported experiences and outcomes were excellent when EA + Sed was used for orthoplastic operations involving free-flaps for LLOM. We recommend EA + Sed as the anaesthetic technique of choice for such patients.","Galizine, Svetlana; Wilson, Katy; Edington, Magdalena; Burumdayal, Amisha; McNally, Martin",Surgeon,107,1

The nursing quality of digestive endoscopy room will have a direct impact on the examination results and treatment effect, so improving the nursing quality of digestive endoscopy room has always been the focus of attention. In this paper, the smart electronic medical blockchain technology and hospital standardized nursing management mode are combined to develop the smart medical standardized nursing management mode. Firstly, 88 patients with digestive endoscopy in a hospital from October 2018 to October 2019 were selected as the experimental subjects: 44 cases in the control group and 44 cases in the experimental group. The control group implemented the traditional management mode of digestive endoscopy room, and the experimental group implemented the standardized nursing management mode of smart medicine. The blood pressure level before and after nursing and the probability of adverse reactions in the process of nursing were counted. After nursing, the patients were asked to fill in the nursing satisfaction questionnaire, evaluate the nursing quality of nursing staff, and make statistics and comparison on the occurrence of safety events in digestive endoscopy room. After nursing, the systolic pressure drop of the experimental group was 125.36 ± 7.27 mmhg, diastolic pressure drop was 73.24 ± 4.21 mmhg, and the incidence of adverse reactions was 11.36%. The satisfaction rate of the experimental group was 15%, 29.55%, and 22.73% higher than that of the control group. The average scores of nursing skills, operation level, and examination results of nursing staff in the experimental group were 94.49, 95.12, and 95.89, respectively; the qualified rate of disinfection of digestive endoscopy room in the experimental group was 100%, the degree of cooperation between doctors and nurses was 100%, the timely rate of emergency measures was 95.45%, and the incidence of accidents was 0%. This shows that, under the standardized nursing of smart medicine, the blood pressure of patients is more stable, the incidence of adverse reactions is lower, the nursing satisfaction is higher, and the nursing quality of nursing staff and the safety of digestive endoscopy room are also improved.","Niu, Yufen",J Healthc Eng,107,24

This trial was undertaken to study the efficacy and safety profile of topical nasal administration of CQN drops in reducing viral load and preventing clinical progression in early COVID-19 infection. METHODS: This randomized clinical trial was done with a sample size of 60. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) confirmed asymptomatic patients or those with mild COVID-19 illness [National Early Warning Score (NEWS) ≤4] were included. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 manner. Control arm (standard supportive treatment, n=30) was compared with intervention arm (n=30) of standard treatment plus CQN eye drops (0.03%) repurposed as nasal drops administered six times daily (0.5 ml/dose) for 10 days. Outcome measures were adverse events and adherence; clinical progression and outcomes were measured by NEWS; sequential RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values were also noted on days 0, 3, 7 and 10. RESULTS: Nasal CQN was associated with local irritation in seven and non-compliance in one of 30 patients. Eleven patients were excluded due to enrolment error (2 – recovered; 9 – false-positive referral), and 49 patients were analyzed as per modified intention-to-treat analysis. Clinical recovery was noted as similar with 100 per cent asymptomatic by day seven in both arms. Virological outcomes also indicated similarly improving Ct values in both arms, and similar proportion of patients transitioning to non-infectivity by day 10 (controls - 19/25; nasal CQN - 15/24). Nine false-positive patients with enrolment error and day 0 RT-PCR negative were initially uninfected but had continuing COVID-19 exposure and treatment as per randomization. Patients receiving nasal CQN (n=5) demonstrated stable Ct values from day 0 to 10, while patients with no nasal CQN (n=4) demonstrated significant dip in Ct value indicating to infection (Ct<35) and infectivity (Ct<33).

Respiratory disorders in COVID-19 caused by the virus commonly present as viral pneumonia-like opacities in chest X-ray images which are used as an adjunct to the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction test for confirmation and evaluating disease progression. The surge places high demand on medical services including radiology expertise. However, there is a dearth of sufficient training data for developing image-based automated decision support tools to alleviate radiological burden. We address this insufficiency by expanding training data distribution through use of weakly-labeled images pooled from publicly available CXR collections showing pneumonia-related opacities. We use the images in a stage-wise, strategic approach and train convolutional neural network-based algorithms to detect COVID-19 infections in CXRs. It is observed that weakly-labeled data augmentation improves performance with the baseline test data compared to non-augmented training by expanding the learned feature space to encompass variability in the unseen test distribution to enhance inter-class discrimination, reduce intra-class similarity and generalization error. Augmentation with COVID-19 CXRs from individual collections significantly improves performance compared to baseline non-augmented training and weakly-labeled augmentation toward detecting COVID-19 like viral pneumonia in the publicly available COVID-19 CXR collections. This underscores the fact that COVID-19 CXRs have a distinct pattern and hence distribution, unlike non-COVID-19 viral pneumonia and other infectious agents.","Rajaraman, Sivaramakrishnan; Antani, Sameer",medRxiv,107,6

Long-term (years) exposure to PM is known to affect human health by increasing susceptibility to viral infections as well as to the development of respiratory and cardiovascular symptoms. In the short-term (days to months), PM has been suggested to assist airborne viral transmission. However, confounding factors such as urban mobility prevent causal conclusions. In this study, we explore short-term relationships between PM concentrations and the evolution of COVID-19 cases in a number of cities in the United States of America. We focus on the role of PM in facilitating viral transmission in early stages of the pandemic. We analyzed PM concentrations in two particle size ranges, <2.5 m, and between 10 and 2.5 m (PM2.5 and PM10 respectively) as well as carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2). Granger causality analysis was employed to evaluate instantaneous and lagged effects of pollution in peaks of COVID-19 new daily cases in each location. The effect of pollution in shaping the disease spread was evaluated by correlating the logistic growth rate of accumulated cases with pollutants concentrations for a range of time lags and accumulation windows. PM2.5 shows the most significant results in Granger causality tests in comparison with the other pollutants. We found a strong and significant association between PM2.5 concentrations and the growth rate of accumulated cases between the 1st and 18th days after the report of the infection, peaking at the 8th day. By comparing results of PM2.5 with PM10, CO and NO2 we rule out confounding effects associated with mobility. We conclude that PM2.5 is not a first order effect in the cities considered; however, it plays a significant role in facilitating the COVID-19 transmission.","Yoshiaki Kamigauti, L.; Martins Palma Perez, G.; Souto-Oliveira, C.

METHODS: The electronic medical records of patients that discharged or died from COVID-19 in the Hospital Universitario San Cecilio (Granada, Spain) between March 16 and April 10, 2020 were analysed. From these records, information was obtained on sex, age, comorbidities at admission, clinical information, analytical parameters, imaging tests and empirical treatments used. The outcome variable was the in-hospital mortality. To estimate the associations between the different therapeutic alternatives and the risk of mortality, Hazard Ratios adjusted for age, sex, previous pathologies and severity at discharge were estimated using Cox Regression models. RESULTS: The most frequently used combination of drugs was low molecular weight heparins, hydroxychloroquine, and ritonavir/lopinavir. None of the analysed treatments showed independent association with mortality. The drugs that showed a greater inverse association with mortality were tocilizumab and corticoids. CONCLUSIONS: The observed association patterns are consistent with previous literature. It seems necessary to design randomized controlled clinical trials that evaluate the possible protector effect of tocilizumab and corticoids in the risk of mortality for some subgroups of COVID-19 hospitalized patients.","Rivera-Izquierdo, Mario; Valero-Ubierna, María del Carmen; R-delAmo, Juan Luis; Fernández-García, Miguel Ángel; Martínez-Diz, Silvia; Tahery-Mahmoud, Arezu; Rodríguez-Camacho, Marta; Gámiz-Molina, Ana Belén; Barba-Gyengo, Nicolás; Gámez-Baeza, Pablo; Cabrero-Rodríguez, Celia; Guirado-Ruiz, Pedro Antonio; Martín-Romero, Divina Tatiana; Láinez-Ramos-Bossini, Antonio Jesús; Sánchez-Pérez, María Rosa; Mancera-Romero, José; García-Martín, Miguel; Martín-delosReyes, Luis Miguel; Martínez-Ruiz, Virginia; Jiménez-Mejías, Eladio",Med Clin (Engl Ed),107,1

In this strategy, contact is reduced only to specific groups (like age groups) that are at increased risk of severe disease following SARS-CoV-2 infection. We aim to assess the feasibility of this scenario as an exit strategy for the current lockdown in terms of its ability to keep the number of cases under the health care system capacity. We developed a modified SEIR model, including confinement, asymptomatic transmission, quarantine and hospitalization. The population is subdivided into 9 age groups, resulting in a system of 72 coupled nonlinear differential equations. The rate of transmission is dynamic and derived from the observed delayed fatality rate; the parameters of the epidemics are derived with a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. We used Brazil as an example of middle income country, but the results are easily generalizable to other countries considering a similar strategy. We find that starting from 60% horizontal confinement, an exit strategy on May 1st of confinement of individuals older than 60 years old and full release of the younger population results in 400 000 hospitalizations, 50 000 ICU cases, and 120 000 deaths in the 50-60 years old age group alone. The health care system avoids collapse if the 50-60 years old are also confined, but our model assumes an idealized lockdown where the confined are perfectly insulated from contamination, so our numbers are a conservative lower bound. Our results discourage confinement by age as an exit strategy.","Lyra, Wladimir; do Nascimento, Jose Dias; Belkhiria, Jaber; de Almeida, Leandro; Chrispim, Pedro Paulo; de Andrade, Ion",,107,20

In the Cumbaya Valley of Quito, Ecuador, community health clinics sponsor social clubs for specific populations to address this important aspect of health. Men, who tend to be less socially integrated than women, are largely absent from these programs. OBJECTIVE: This paper investigates the quality and extent of men’s social integration in the Cumbaya Valley of Quito to understand why men are less likely to attend the community health center clubs and to develop ideas for increasing male participation, which may differ from current methods. METHODS: A composite survey was used to interview 100 men over the age of 40 to collect data on their social health and information regarding their interaction with community health center clubs and other local social groups. FINDINGS: Social integration scores were varied, with some men having high social scores and others having low scores. Men generally had greater access to affectionate and tangible support but lower access to emotional support and positive social interaction. Men spend far more social time with their families and much less with friends and neighbors. Regression analysis revealed that social scores have a relationship with age and education. Qualitative results suggest gendered expectations of men in the community have negatively impacted their willingness to engage in community health groups. Participants also provided suggestions, including specific sports, gardening, and meal distribution, to promote male participation. CONCLUSION: There is a strong need to increase services, strategies, and programs that address the lack of social integration experienced by men. This paper presents the particular role community clinics can play in increasing the social well-being of its male patients.","DiBello, John; Murphy, Luke; Palacios, Iván",Annals of global health,107,1

The multiple industries, cities, towns and rural people are completely depending on large tropical river Damodar (India) but in the last few decades the quality of the river water is being significantly deteriorated. The present study attempts to investigate the river water quality (RWQ) particularly for pre- lockdown, lockdown and unlock period. We considered 20 variables per sample of RWQ data and it was analyzed using novel Modified Water Quality Index (MWQI), Trophic State Index (TSI), Heavy Metal Index (HMI) and Potential Ecological Risk Index (RI). Principal component analysis (PCA) and Pearson’s correlation (r) analysis are applied to determine the influencing variables and relationship among the river pollutants. The results show that during lockdown 54.54% samples were brought significantly positive changes applying MWQI. During lockdown, HMI ranged from 33.96 to 117.33 with 27.27% good water quality which shows the low ecological risk of aquatic ecosystem due to low mixing of toxic metals in the river water. Lockdown effects brought river water to oligotrophic/meso-eutrophic condition from eutrophic/hyper-eutrophic stage. Rejuvenation of river health during lockdown offers ample scope to policymakers, administrators and environmentalists for restoration of river health from huge anthropogenic stress.","Chakraborty, Baisakhi; Bera, Biswajit; Adhikary, Partha Pratim; Bhattacharjee, Sumana; Roy, Sambhunath; Saha, Soumik; Ghosh, Anitabha; Sengupta, Debashish; Shit, Pravat Kumar",Sci Rep,107,23

This exemplifies the required expansion of our knowledge of the virus diversity present in wildlife, as well as the potential transmission of these viruses to domestic animals or humans. METHODS: In the present study we evaluated the viral diversity of fecal samples (n = 42) collected from 10 different species of wild small carnivores inhabiting the northern part of Spain using random PCR in combination with next-generation sequencing. Samples were collected from American mink (Neovison vison), European mink (Mustela lutreola), European polecat (Mustela putorius), European pine marten (Martes martes), stone marten (Martes foina), Eurasian otter (Lutra lutra) and Eurasian badger (Meles meles) of the family of Mustelidae; common genet (Genetta genetta) of the family of Viverridae; red fox (Vulpes vulpes) of the family of Canidae and European wild cat (Felis silvestris) of the family of Felidae. RESULTS: A number of sequences of possible novel viruses or virus variants were detected, including a theilovirus, phleboviruses, an amdovirus, a kobuvirus and picobirnaviruses. CONCLUSIONS: Using random PCR in combination with next generation sequencing, sequences of various novel viruses or virus variants were detected in fecal samples collected from Spanish carnivores.

Plasma from 22 subjects who recovered from mild Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and expressed anti-spike-trimer IgGs inhibited ACE2-spike binding to a greater degree than controls. The degree of inhibition correlated with anti-spike IgG levels, neutralizing titers in a pseudotyped lentiviral assay, and the presence of fever during illness.

We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP. METHODS: We collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions. In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number. RESULTS: Among the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male. The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases. The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days. In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days. With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9). CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019. Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere. Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in populations at risk.

We used a metagenomic approach to define and compare the eukaryotic viromes in pediatric diarrhea cohorts from two locations (Melbourne and Northern Territory, Australia). We detected viruses known to cause diarrhea, non-pathogenic enteric viruses, viruses not associated with an enteric reservoir, viruses of plants, and novel viruses. Viromes from Northern Territory children contained more viral families per sample than viromes from Melbourne, which could be attributed largely to an increased number of sequences from the families Adenoviridae and Picornaviridae (genus enterovirus). qRT-PCR/PCR confirmed the increased prevalence of adenoviruses and enteroviruses. Testing of additional diarrhea cohorts by qRT-PCR/PCR demonstrated statistically different prevalences in different geographic sites. These findings raise the question of whether the virome plays a role in enteric diseases and conditions that vary with geography.","Holtz, Lori R.; Cao, Song; Zhao, Guoyan; Bauer, Irma K.; Denno, Donna M.; Klein, Eileen J.; Antonio, Martin; Stine, O.

OBJECTIVES: We aimed to compare the impact of initial government policies on this vulnerable older population between the UK and Australia during the first wave of attack. METHODS: We searched websites of governments in the UK and Australia and media outlets. We examined the key policies including the national lockdown dates and the distribution of some important resources (personal protective equipment and testing) and the effects of these initial policies on the mortality rates in the aged care homes during the first wave of attack of COVID-19. RESULTS: We found that both countries had prioritized resources to hospitals over aged care homes during the first wave of attack. Both countries had lower priority for aged care residents in hospitals (e.g. discharging without testing for COVID-19 or discouraging admissions). However, deaths in aged care homes were 270 times higher in the UK than in Australia as on 7 May 2020 (despite UK having a population only 2.5 times larger than Australia). The lower fatality rate in Australia may have been due to the earlier lockdown strategy when the total daily cases were low in Australia (118) compared to the UK (over 1000), as well as the better community viral testing regime in Australia. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the public health policy in Australia aimed towards earlier intervention with earlier national lockdown and more viral testing to prevent new cases. This primary prevention could have resulted in more lives being saved. In contrast, the initial policy in the UK focussed mainly on protecting resources for hospitals, and there was a delay in national lockdown intervention and lower viral testing rate, resulting in more lives lost in the aged care sector.","Chan, Daniel Kam Yin; Mclaws, Mary-Louise; Forsyth, Duncan Ronald",Int J Qual Health Care,107,16

The presence of the disease and relapses cause stress in people with MS (pwMS). For this reason, stress coping strategies of the patients are important in reducing perceived stress. Our aim in this study is to evaluate which strategies pwMS use during the COVID-19 pandemic, the effect of the strategies on perceived stress, their relationship with relapses and their role on quality of life (QoL). METHODS: An online form including Perceived Stress Scale (PSS; 10 items), Coping with Experienced Problems Scale (Brief-COPE; 28 items) and SF-12 were sent to 340 pwMS under our follow-up. RESULTS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, we found that the patients used the strategies of turn to religion, planning and acceptance at a high rate. PSS score was high in 23 (11.2%) of the patients. The patients with low perceived stress used the acceptance strategy more (P=0.008). We found a negative correlation between physical component summary (PCS) of SF-12 and denial (r=-0.2, p<0.001) and distraction (r =-0.1, p=0.04). A negative correlation was found between mental component summary (MCS) of SF-12 and behavioral disconnection (r=-0.2, p=0.006). There was a positive correlation between MCS and humor (r=0.1, p=0.04), use of instrumental support (r=0.2, p=0.009), planning (r=0.1, p=0.04), and positive reframing (r=0.2, p=0.002). CONCLUSION: PwMS have been successful in coping with stress in the first half of the pandemic with the combination of emotional and problem-focused strategies. Acceptance strategy was highly adopted by patients with low PSS, and the tendency to use the active coping strategy together with the acceptance strategy was high in patients without relapses. Adoption to emotional strategies may have prevented the severe deterioration in QoL in this study group in the early period of Covid-19 pandemic.","Altunan, Bengu; Unal, Aysun; Bingöl, Ayhan; Dilek, Filiz; Girgin, Derya",Mult Scler Relat Disord,107,20

We report the use of Lycopodium clavatum sporopollenin (LCS), derived from their natural spores, and raw Phoenix dactylifera L. (date palm) pollens (DPP) for MTF microencapsulation. MTF was loaded into LCS and DPP via a vacuum and a novel method of hydration-induced swelling. The loading capacity (LC) and encapsulation efficiency (EE) percentages for MTF-loaded LCS and MTF-loaded DPP microcapsules were 14.9% ± 0.7, 29.8 ± 0.8, and 15.2% ± 0.7, 30.3 ± 1.0, respectively. The release of MTF from MTF-loaded LCS microcapsules was additionally controlled by re-encapsulating the loaded microcapsules into calcium alginate (ALG) microbeads via ionotropic gelation, where the release of MTF was found to be significantly slower and pH-dependent. The pharmacokinetic parameters, obtained from the in vivo study, revealed that the relative bioavailability of the MTF-loaded LCS-ALG beads was 1.215 times higher compared to pure MTF, following oral administration of a single dose equivalent to 25 mg/kg body weight MTF to streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic male Sprague-Dawley rats. Significant hypoglycemic effect was obtained for STZ-induced diabetic rats orally treated with MTF-loaded LCS-ALG beads compared to control diabetic rats. Over a period of 29 days, the STZ-induced diabetic rats treated with MTF-loaded LCS-ALG beads showed a decrease in the aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), triglycerides, cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels, as well as an increase in glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and a recovery in the oxidative stress biomarker, lipid peroxidation (LPx). In addition, histopathological studies of liver, pancreas, kidney, and testes suggested that MTF-loaded LCS-ALG beads improved the degenerative changes in organs of diabetic rats. The LCS-ALG platform for dual encapsulation of MTF achieved sustained MTF delivery and enhancement of bioavailability, as well as the improved biochemical and histopathological characteristics in in vivo studies, opening many other intriguing applications in sustained drug delivery.","Meligi, Noha M.; Dyab, Amro K.

Cannula diameters, flow rate ratios between the jet and the co-flow and cannula position were studied using Particle Image Velocimetry and Planar Laser Induced Fluorescence. The jet was turbulent for all but two cases, in which a transitional regime was observed. The mixing, governed by flow entrainment, shear layer induced vortices and a backflow along the vessel wall, was found to require 9–12 cannula diameters to reach a fully homogeneous mixture. This can be compared to the 22–30 cannula diameters needed to obtain a fully developed flow. Although not significantly affecting mixing characteristics, cannula position altered the development of the flow structures, and hence the shear stress characteristics.","Lemétayer, Julien; Broman, L.

Concurrently, four parameters of open-field Behavior I.E. Ambulations, Rearing, Fine Movements and Central Ambulatory behavior (a measure of anxiety reduction behavior), were assayed by infrared photobeam detection. 3. 3. Time course studies showed that the mechanism of action of the triazolobenzodiazepine (TBZD), adinazolam, (Deracyn®) is dramatically different from that of the classical benzodiazepine (BZD), diazepam (Valium®) i.e., adinazolam increased, whereas diazepam decreased, 5-HT release within CA1 region of hippocampus in the freely moving and behaving rat. 4. 4. Adinazolam initially increased NE release and then decreased NE release in CA1 region of hippocampus in the freely moving and behaving rat whereas diazepam only decreased the electrochemical signal for NE; the decrease in NE produced by adinazolam was greater than the decrease in NE release produced by diazepam. 5. 5. The Behavioral Activity Patterns, derived from same animal controls, simultaneously with detection of in vivo microvoltammetric signals for NE release and 5-HT release, showed that the BZD, diazepam, exhibited more potent sedative properties than did the TBZD adinazolam. 6. 6.

METHODS: A cross-section design was used, and a convenience sample of nursing students (n = 158 valid) was selected from a tertiary institute in Macao. In addition to demographic questions, the Chinese versions of the Adversity Quotient Scale, the Emotional Intelligence (EI) Scale, the Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire and the Parenting Styles Scale were used to assess the students’ characteristics. RESULTS: The average AQ score of the students was 116.72 ± 11.39. AQ scores were negatively correlated with coping-negative, and maternal style (excessive interference, excessive protection) (r = −0.332, P < 0.001; r = −0.167, P = 0.036). Coping-negative entered the regression equation (F = 19.154, P < 0.001). The female nursing students had higher scores in ownership dimension of AQ than their male counterparts (31.98 ± 3.26 vs. 29.21 ± 3.08, t = −4.442, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The average AQ scores of Macao undergraduate nursing students were moderate.

Consumers’ food consumption behavior has also changed accordingly with reduced grocery shopping frequency, replaced in-person grocery shopping with online shopping, and increased valuation on food. In this paper, we aim to investigate the change in Chinese consumers’ food consumption and their willingness to pay (WTP) for vegetables and meat, using a dataset with 1206 online samples collected between February and March 2020. Consumers’ WTP for vegetables and meat is estimated using a double-bounded dichotomous contingent valuation design, and factors affecting their WTPs are also investigated. Results show that consumers have a higher WTP for these food products during the pandemic, and their WTP is positively affected by their anticipated duration of the COVID-19, their online shopping shares, their direct exposure to infected patients, their gender, and their income. These results imply that the food industry shall try to develop online market channels as consumers are willing to share the costs, while lower-income consumers may not be able to meet their food needs with prices increased beyond their WTP and thus may call for the government’s support.","Yue, Wei; Liu, Na; Zheng, Qiujie; Wang, H.

The rising incidence of stroke among younger people, the UK economic forecast, and clinical drivers highlight the need for stroke survivors to receive support with RTW. However, evidence for this type of support is lacking. This randomised controlled trial (RCT) will investigate whether Early Stroke Specialist Vocational Rehabilitation (ESSVR) plus usual care (UC) (i.e. usual NHS rehabilitation) is more clinically and cost-effective for supporting post-stroke RTW, than UC alone. METHODS: Seven hundred sixty stroke survivors and their carers will be recruited from approximately 20 NHS stroke services. A 5:4 allocation ratio will be employed to randomise participants to receive ESSVR plus UC, or UC alone. The individually tailored ESSVR intervention will commence within 12 weeks of stroke onset and be delivered for up to 12 months as necessary by trained RETAKE occupational therapists in the community, participants’ homes or workplaces, and outpatient/inpatient therapy settings, via telephone, email, or SMS text message. Outcome data will be collected via self-report questionnaires administered by post or online at 3, 6, and 12 months follow-up. The primary outcome will be self-reported RTW and job retention at 12 months (minimum 2 h/week). Secondary outcomes will include mood, function, participation, health-related quality of life, confidence, intervention compliance, health and social care resource use, and mortality. An embedded economic evaluation will estimate cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses from National Health Service (NHS) and Personal Social Services (PSS) perspectives. An embedded process evaluation will employ a mixed methods approach to explore ESSVR implementation, contextual factors linked to outcome variation, and factors affecting NHS roll-out. DISCUSSION: This article describes the protocol for a multi-centre RCT evaluating the clinical- and cost-effectiveness of an early vocational rehabilitation intervention aimed at supporting adults to return to work following a stroke. Evidence favouring the ESSVR intervention would support its roll-out in NHS settings. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN, ISRCTN12464275.

METHODS: Retrospective observational study that included hospitalized adults with pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 from 15/03 to 15/05/2020. We excluded immunocompromised patients, nursing home residents and those admitted in the previous 14 days for another reasons. Analysis of ROC curves was performed, calculating the area under the curve for the different scales, as well as sensitivity, specificity and predictive values. RESULTS: 208 patients were enrolled, aged 63 ± 17 years, 57,7% were men. 38 patients were admitted to ICU (23,5%), of these patients 33 required IMV (86,8%), with an overall mortality of 12,5%. Area under the ROC curves for mortality of the scores were: PSI 0,82 (95% CI 0,73–0,91), CURB-65 0,82 (0,73–0,91), MuLBSTA 0,72 (0,62–0,81) and COVID-GRAM 0,86 (0,70–1). Area under the curve for needing IMV was: PSI 0,73 (95% CI 0,64–0,82), CURB-65 0,66 (0,55–0,77), MuLBSTA 0,78 (0,69–0,86) and COVID-GRAM 0,76 (0,67–0,85), respectively. Patients with bacterial co-infections of the respiratory tract were 20 (9,6%), the most frequent strains being Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae. CONCLUSIONS: In our study, the COVID-GRAM score was the most accurate to identify patients with higher mortality with pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2; however, none of these scores accurately predicts the need for IMV with ICU admission. 10% of patients admitted presented bacterial respiratory co-infection.","Esteban Ronda, Violeta; Ruiz Alcaraz, Sandra; Ruiz Torregrosa, Paloma; Giménez Suau, Mario; Nofuentes Pérez, Ester; León Ramírez, José Manuel; Andrés, Mariano; Moreno-Pérez, Óscar; Candela Blanes, Alfredo; Gil Carbonell, Joan; Merino de Lucas, Esperanza",Med Clin (Engl Ed),107,22

There has been a marked increase in the number of both pediatric surgical training programs and practicing pediatric general and thoracic surgeons. Despite this trend, the population of children in the US and the birth rate have recently remained relatively flat. Some pediatric surgeons have become “super specialists”, concentrating their practices in oncology or colorectal surgery. This has the potential to result in a dilution of experience for both pediatric surgical trainees and practicing pediatric surgeons, thus limiting their ability to acquire and maintain expertise, respectively. Coincident with this, there has been a relative paradigm shift in recognition that “quality of life” is based more on maintaining a creative balance in lifestyle and is not “all about work”. There has been a parallel growth in the number of practicing pediatric general and thoracic surgeons in urban settings, but we have not appreciated as much growth in rural and underserved areas, where access to pediatric surgical care remains limited and fewer pediatric general and thoracic surgeons practice. This is a complex issue, as some underserved areas are economically depressed and geographically sparse, but others are just underserved with adult providers taking care of children in settings that are often under resourced for pediatric surgical care. This problem may extend beyond the boundaries of pediatric general and thoracic surgery to other specialties. As the premier association representing all pediatric surgeons in the United States, the American Pediatric Surgical Association (APSA) has concluded that the quality of pediatric surgical care will likely decline should the status quo be allowed to continue. Therefore, APSA has initiated a Right Child/Right Surgeon initiative to consider these issues and propose some potential solutions.

642341,642341,642341,Comparison of FilmArray Respiratory Panel and laboratory-developed real-time reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction assays for respiratory virus detection()(),12.559075,10.583987,2012-09-12,"Background. Countries have adopted disparate policies in tackling the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic. For example, South Korea started a vigorous campaign to suppress the virus by testing patients with respiratory symptoms and tracing and isolating all their contacts, and many European countries are trying to slow down the spread of the virus with varying degrees of shutdowns. There is clearly a need for a model that can realistically simulate different policy actions and their impacts on the disease and health care capacity in a country or a region. Specifically, there is a need to identify destructive policies, i.e. policies that are, based on scientific knowledge, worse than an alternative and should not be implemented. Methods. We developed an agent-based model (REINA) using Python and accelerated it by the Cython optimising static compiler. It follows a population over time at individual level at different stages of the disease and estimates the number of patients in hospitals and in intensive care. It estimates death rates and counts based on the treatment available. Any number of interventions can be added on the timeline from a selection including e.g. physical isolation, testing and tracing, and controlling the amount of cases entering the area. The model has open source code and runs online. Results. The model uses the demographics of the Helsinki University Hospital region (1.6 million inhabitants). A mitigation strategy aims to slow down the spread of the epidemic to maintain the hospital capacity by implementing mobility restrictions. A suppression strategy initially consists of the same restrictions but also aggressive testing, tracing, and isolating all coronavirus positive patients and their contacts. The modelling starting point is 2020-02-18. The strategies follow the actual situation until 2020-04-06 and then diverge. The default mitigation scenario with variable 30−40% mobility reduction appears to delay the peak of the epidemic (as intended) but not suppress the disease. In the suppression strategy, active testing and tracing of patients with symptoms and their contacts is implemented in addition to 20−25% mobility reduction. This results in a reduction of the cumulative number of infected individuals from 820 000 to 80 000 and the number of deaths from 6000 to only 640, when compared with the mitigation strategy (during the first year of the epidemic). Discussion. The agent-based model (REINA) can be used to simulate epidemic outcomes for various types of policy actions on a timeline. Our results lend support to the strategy of combining comprehensive testing, contact tracing and targeted isolation measures with social isolation measures. While social isolation is important in the early stages to prevent explosive growth, relying on social isolation alone (the mitigation strategy) appears to be a destructive policy. The open-source nature of the model facilitates rapid further development. The flexibility of the modelling logic supports the future implementation of several already identified refinements in terms of more realistic population models and new types of more specific policy interventions. Improving estimates of epidemic parameters will make it possible to improve modelling accuracy further.","Tuomisto, Jouni T; Yrjölä, Juha; Kolehmainen, Mikko; Bonsdorff, Juhani; Pekkanen, Jami; Tikkanen, Tero",,107,32

In the crisis of respiratory infection of Covid-19, screening based on symptoms is one of the key measures. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the telephone-based screening and triage services in the promoted primary healthcare system with regard to the Covid-19 outbreak, in terms of reducing unnecessary referrals to the hospital. METHODS: This is a descriptive cross-sectional study conducted in two stages on 1,406,635 households during March/April 2020 in Ardabil province for screening and early detection of Covid-19 disease. In the first stage, conducted by trained healthcare providers through telephone, individuals suspected of Covid-19 were identified. In the second stage, the individuals were referred to the second level of service in comprehensive healthcare centers (16- or 24-h centers) for clinical evaluation by a physician. RESULTS: The results showed that before establishing a screening and triage system for patients in comprehensive healthcare centers, all patients were referred directly to the hospital, while after the implementation of the program, a significant reduction in hospital visits was observed and a large number of patients undertook the care and triage services in comprehensive healthcare centers. CONCLUSION: The use of a grading system in referring patients with suspected cases, triage of patients according to symptoms at the comprehensive health centers, and activation of home isolation were the most important factors in reducing the burden of unnecessary referrals of patients to the hospital.","NeJhaddadgar, Nazila; Ziapour, Arash; Zakkipour, Ghader; Abbas, Jaffar; Abolfathi, Mitra; Shabani, Masoud",Z Gesundh Wiss,107,26

While a limited number of studies have previously demonstrated the presence of viral material in SS, no comprehensive systematic review exists on the subject of viral transmission in SS. Methods A systematic review of the literature was conducted as per PRISMA guidelines. MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL databases were searched for publications reporting the primary outcome of the presence of viral particles in SS and secondary outcomes of indices suggesting transmission of viable virus particles in SS producing clinically important infection. All human, animal, and in vitro studies which used accepted analytic techniques for viral detection were included. A meta-analysis was not complete due to methodologic heterogeneity and inconsistent reporting of outcomes of interest. RESULTS: 23 publications addressed the presence of viral components in SS, and 19 (83%) found the presence of viral particles in SS. 21 publications additionally studied the ability of SS to induce clinically relevant infection in host cells, with 9 (43%) demonstrating potential for viral transmission. CONCLUSION: Evidence exists for viral transmission via SS. However, HPV remains the only virus with documented transmission to humans via SS. While meaningful translation into practical guidelines during the COVID pandemic remains challenging, no evidence exists to suggest increased risk in MIS.

During the early phase, little was known about public awareness relating to Coronavirus disease. This study was designed to determine knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) among the Iranian public towards COVID-19. Methods: A cross-sectional online survey was carried out in Iran from 2 March to 8 April 2020 using a self-administered questionnaire on 1,480 people. COVID-19-related KAP questions were adapted from other internationally validated questionnaires specific to infectious diseases. Results: All participants were aware of COVID-19. When asked unprompted, 80% of respondents could correctly cite fever, difficulty breathing and cough as signs/symptoms of COVID-19. Most of our sample population knew that by staying at home and staying isolated (95.3%, 95 % CI: 94.2-96.3) as well as constant hand washing and using disinfectants (92.5%, 95 % CI: 91.1-93.8) could prevent COVID-19. However, there was also widespread misconceptions such as the belief that COVID-19 can be transmitted by wild animals (58%, 95 % CI: 55.5-60.5) and by air (48.3%, 95 % CI: 45.7-50.8). Unprompted, self-reported actions taken to avoid COVID-19 infection included hand washing with soap and water (95.4%, 95 % CI: 94.3-96.4), avoiding crowded places (93%, 95 % CI: 91.7-94.3), cleaning hands with other disinfectants (80.9 %, 95 % CI: 78.9- 82.9), and covering mouths and noses when coughing and sneezing (76.1 %, 95 % CI: 73.9-78.2). The internet and social media (94.5%, 95 % CI: 93.3-95.6) were the main Coronavirus information sources. However, the most trusted information sources on Coronavirus were health and medical professionals (79.3%, 95 % CI: 77.2-81.3). The majority of participants (77.0%, 95 % CI: 74.8-79.1) wanted more information about Coronavirus to be available. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that people's knowledge and attitude towards COVID-19 at the time of its outbreak was of a high level. Therefore, health systems should use multiple ways, such as mass media, phone applications, electronic, print, and tele-education to increase KAP related to COVID-19.","Kakemam, E.; Ghoddoosi-Nejad, D.; Chegini, Z.; Momeni, K.; Salehinia, H.; Hassanipour, S.; Ameri, H.; Arab-Zozani, M.",,107,24

METHODS: We examined the repercussions of the first wave of the pandemic on the trauma surgery clinic of a Level I Trauma Center and compared the data with data from 58 other trauma clinics. The results could aid in orientating the distribution of structural, financial, and human resources (HR) during the second wave. The period between March 16 and April 30, 2020 was compared with the data over the same period during 2019. Information was collected from the HR department, central revenue management, and internal documentation. RESULTS: The proportion of trauma surgical patients in the emergency room decreased by 22%. The number of polytrauma cases increased by 53%. Hospital days of trauma surgery patients in the intensive and intermediate care wards increased by 90%. The number of operations decreased by 15%, although the operating time outside of normal working hours increased by 44%. Clinics with more than 600 beds recorded a decrease in cases and emergencies by 8 and 9%, respectively, while the Trauma Center showed an increase of 19 and 12%. The results reflect the importance of level I trauma centers in the lockdown phase.

The risk of severe COVID-19 is increased by certain underlying comorbidities, including asthma, cancer, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, and obesity. Notably, exposure to hormonally active chemicals called endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) can promote such cardio-metabolic diseases, endocrine-related cancers, and immune system dysregulation and thus, may also be linked to higher risk of severe COVID-19. Bisphenol A (BPA) is among the most common EDCs and exerts its effects via receptors which are widely distributed in human tissues, including nuclear oestrogen receptors (ERα and ERβ), membrane-bound oestrogen receptor (G protein-coupled receptor 30; GPR30), and human nuclear receptor oestrogen-related receptor gamma. As such, this paper focuses on the potential role of BPA in promoting comorbidities associated with severe COVID-19, as well as on potential BPA-induced effects on key SARS-CoV-2 infection mediators, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2). Interestingly, GPR30 appears to exhibit greater co-localisation with TMPRSS2 in key tissues like lung and prostate, suggesting that BPA exposure may impact on the local expression of these SARS-CoV-2 infection mediators. Overall, the potential role of BPA on the risk and severity of COVID-19 merits further investigation.","Zahra, Aeman; Sisu, Cristina; Silva, Elisabete; De Aguiar Greca, Sophie-Christine; Randeva, Harpal S.; Chatha, Kamaljit; Kyrou, Ioannis; Karteris, Emmanouil",J Clin Med,107,23

Low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin-D [25(OH)D] was identified as an independent risk factor for COVID-19 infection and hospitalization, and administration of 0.532 mg (21280 IU) of calcifediol or 25(OH)D, followed by 0.266 mg on days 3 and 7 and then weekly until discharge or intensive care unit admission significantly reduced the need for intensive care unit treatment. AIM: To elucidate the role of vitamin D European population status in the COVID-19 pandemic, data from the Worldometer were analyzed. METHODS: Linear regression explored the correlation between published representative-standardized population vitamin D concentrations and the number of total cases/million (M), recovered/M, deaths/M and serious-critically ill/M from COVID-19 for 26 European countries populated > 4 M (Worldometer). Life expectancy was analyzed with semi-parametric regression. Weighted analysis of variance/analysis of covariance evaluated serious-critical/M and deaths/M by the vitamin D population status: Deficient < 50, insufficient: 50-62.5, mildly insufficient > 62.5-75 and sufficient > 75 nmol/L, while controlling for life expectancy for deaths/M. Statistical analyses were performed in XLSTAT LIFE SCIENCE and R (SemiPar Library). RESULTS: Linear regression found no correlation between population vitamin D concentrations and the total cases-recovered/M, but negative correlations predicting a reduction of 47%-64%-80% in serious-critical illnesses/M and of 61%-82%-102.4% in deaths/M further enhanced when adapting for life expectancy by 133-177-221% if 25(OH)D concentrations reach 100-125-150 nmol/L, sustained on August 15, 2020, indicating a truthful association. Weighted analysis of variance was performed to evaluate serious-critical/M (r(2 )= 0.22) by the vitamin D population status and analysis of covariance the deaths/M (r(2 )= 0.629) controlling for life expectancy (r(2 )= 0.47). Serious-critical showed a decreasing trend (P < 0.001) from population status deficient (P < 0.001) to insufficient by 9.2% (P < 0.001), to mildly insufficient by 47.6% (P < 0.044) and to sufficient by 100% (reference, P < 0.001). For deaths/M the respective decreasing trend (P < 0.001) was 62.9% from deficient (P < 0.001) to insufficient (P < 0.001), 65.15% to mildly insufficient (P < 0.001) and 78.8% to sufficient (P = 0.041). CONCLUSION: Achieving serum 25(OH)D 100-150 nmol/L (40-60 ng/mL) (upper tolerable daily doses followed by maintenance proposed doses not requiring medical supervision, Endocrine Society) may protect from serious-critical illness/death from COVID-19 disease.","Papadimitriou, Dimitrios T; Vassaras, Alexandros K; Holick, Michael F",World J Virol,107,17

We aimed to investigate the rate and risk factors of recurrent positive detection of SARS-CoV-2 in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal swabs (n=3513) were collected to detect SARS-CoV-2 during the hospitalization. We analyzed the recurrent positive rate after consecutive negative results and its relationship to demographic characteristics. RESULTS: Among 599 enrolled COVID-19 patients, the median time for viral RNA shedding was 24 days (IQR, 19-33 days). The positive rate of RT-PCR was 35.9% (215/599), 17.0% (65/383) and 12.4% (23/185) after one, two and three consecutive negative RT-PCR test results respectively. Medians of CT-values of initial positive test, rebound positive after two consecutive negative results, and rebound positive after three consecutive negative results were 28.8, 32.8 and 36.1 respectively. Compare with male patients, females had a significant higher rate of recurrent positive RT-PCR after three consecutive negative results (18.2%, 18/99 vs. 5.8%, 5/86, p=0.013). Older age (≥55 yrs) had a significant higher rate of recurrent positive RT-PCR after one negative result (42.3%, 165/390, vs. 23.9%, 50/209, p<0.001). Nasopharyngeal swab tests produced a higher positive rate than oropharyngeal swab tests (37.3%, 152/408 vs. 35.8%, 1111/3105). CONCLUSIONS: Our study revealed the prevalence and dynamic characteristics of recurrent positive RT-PCR to SARS-CoV-2. We showed that around 17.0% (65/383) patients were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 after two consecutive negative results. Patients with rebound positive RT-PCR test had a low viral load. Older age and female were risk factors for recurrent positive results.","Gao, Chun; Zhu, Li; Jin, Cheng Cheng; Tong, Yi Xin; Xiao, Ai Tang; Zhang, Sheng",Clin Microbiol Infect,107,1

The underlying mechanism of this phenomenon is unknown. A neutralizing antibody against viruses is known to be important to eliminate the virus. In addition, this antibody is induced at high levels in patients with severe COVID-19, followed by a termination of virus replication. Severe COVID-19 patients exhibit high levels of cytokines/chemokines, even after the disappearance of the virus. This indicates that cytokines/chemokines play significant roles in disease severity. These findings also suggest that antiviral therapy (monoclonal antibody and/or convalescent plasma therapy) should be administered early to eliminate the virus, followed by steroid treatment after viral genome disappearance, especially in patients with severe symptoms.","Tjan, Lidya Handayani; Nagano, Tatsuya; Furukawa, Koichi; Nishimura, Mitsuhiro; Arii, Jun; Fujinaka, Sayo; Iwata, Sachiyo; Sano, Shigeru; Tohma, Yoshiki; Nishimura, Yoshihiro; Mori, Yasuko",JMA J,107,20

An enormous number of investigations point to the vital importance of various micronutrients in the interactions between the host immune system and viruses, including COVID-19. There are complex and multifaceted links between micronutrient status, the host immune response, and the virulence of pathogenic viruses. Micronutrients play a critical role in the coordinated recruitment of innate and adaptive immune responses to viral infections, particularly in the regulation of pro-and anti-inflammatory host responses. Furthermore, inadequate amounts of micronutrients not only weaken the immune system in combating viral infections, but also contribute to the emergence of more virulent strains via alterations of the genetic make-up of the viral genome. This study aimed to evaluate the evidence which suggests the contribution of micronutrients in the spread as well as the morbidity and mortality of COVID-19. Both the presence of micronutrient deficiencies among infected subjects and the effect of micronutrient supplementation on the immune responses and overall outcome of the disease could be of great interest to weigh the use of micronutrients in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 infection. These investigations could be of great value in dealing with future viral epidemics.","Gorji, Ali; Ghadiri, Maryam Khaleghi",Nutrition,107,1

Nowadays, age-related diseases come into prominence, and identifying age-related changes and developing proper therapeutic approaches are counted as some of the major issues regarding community health. Melatonin is the main hormone of the pineal gland. Melatonin is known to influence many biological processes in the body, including circadian rhythms, the immune system, and neuroendocrine and cardiovascular functions. Melatonin rhythms also reflect the biological process of aging. Aging is an extremely complex and multifactorial process. Melatonin levels decline considerably with aging and its decline is associated with several age-related diseases. Aging is closely associated with oxidative damage and mitochondrial dysfunction. Free radical reactions initiated by the mitochondria constitute the inherent aging process. Melatonin plays a pivotal role in preventing age-related oxidative stress. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) fatality rates increase with chronic diseases and age, where melatonin levels decrease. For this reason, melatonin supplementation in elderly could be beneficial in COVID-19 treatment. Therefore, studies on the usage of melatonin in COVID-19 treatment are needed.","ÖZTÜRK, Güler; AKBULUT, Kazime Gonca; GÜNEY, Şevin",Turk J Med Sci,107,20

Testing frequency, prevalence of viral CAP and treatment with oseltamivir were assessed among patients who underwent a viral swab. Univariate and multivariate analysis was used to evaluate risk factors. RESULTS: 553 (14.9%) patients with CAP underwent nasal swab. Viral CAP was diagnosed in 157 (28.4%) patients.

COVID-19 pandemic has spread worldwide and reached HSCT centers in many countries. The first proven case of COVID-19 in Brazil was diagnosed in São Paulo by the end of February 2020. The Brazilian Society of Marrow Transplantation (SBTMO) promptly published local recommendations for the diagnosis and management of COVID-19 in HSCT centers. We describe the main clinical findings and outcomes of SARS CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 in 22 HSCT recipients from two Brazilian HSCT centers, followed up for at least 14 days. Methods. The detection of SARS CoV-2 infection was performed by RT-PCR in all transplant candidates before admission, and in all HSCT recipients with respiratory symptoms. Other respiratory viruses were also investigated by direct fluorescent assay (DFA) or RT-PCR. COVID-19 was managed according to the SBTMO recommendations. Results. From March to June 2020, SARS CoV-2 infection was detected in 5 asymptomatic patients (29.4%) and COVID-19 was diagnosed in 17 HSCT recipients with respiratory symptoms (7 AUTO, 6 MRD, 5 MUD and 4 HAPLO) at a median of 94 days after HSCT (range -6 to +1,850). The asymptomatic cases at diagnosis remained so during follow-up. Two asymptomatic patients were receiving the conditioning regimen when SARS CoV-2 was diagnosed. The median age at diagnosis was 39,2 (1-72) years. Five patients were children (1-12 years) and 17 were adults (19-72 years). Eleven patients (50%) had comorbidities, the most frequent being diabetes and hypertension. Fever, cough and diarrhea were the symptoms more frequently observed and occurred in 13 (76.4%), 7 (41.2%), and 5 (29.4%) of the 17 symptomatic patients, respectively. Symptoms such as anosmia and dysgeusia, which have been frequently associated with COVID-19 were not observed in this series. Eleven of the symptomatic patients (64.7%) showed altered CT or X-ray at diagnosis. Glass ground opacities were the images more frequently seen (63.6%). The median lymphocyte count was 619.5 (0-2,604) /mL. C-reactive protein and d-dimer ranged from 0.65 to 339 ng/mL and from 0.39 to 4,530 mg/L, respectively. Four (18%) HSCT recipients died (1 AUTO, 2 HAPLO, 1 MRD). COVID-19 was the cause of death in two of them. In the remaining two HAPLO HSCT recipients, KPC co-infection followed by septic shock had a major role in patients’ death. Median age of patients who died was 39 (11-59) years, and two of them had comorbidities (hypertension and chronic lung disease). Conclusions. Symptoms of COVID-19 mimic other respiratory virus infections and specific diagnosis is mandatory. Interstitial pneumonia was frequent (around 65%). Clinical outcome of SARS Cov-2 infection or COVID-19 was moderate in the majority of the patients in the present series. However, the mortality rates observed in HSCT recipients (14.3% in AUTO; 20% in ALLO) were higher than in general population. Asymptomatic cases were seen in almost 30% of the patients, suggesting that frequent screening is necessary to control transmission in HSCT centers.

Despite these risks, there have been no consistent statements on surgical guidelines regarding the perioperative screening or management of COVID-19 patients, and we do not have objective global data that describe the current conditions surrounding this issue. This study aimed to clarify the current global surgical practice including COVID-19 screening, preventive measures and in-hospital infection under the COVID-19 pandemic, and to clarify the international gaps on infection control policies among countries worldwide. METHODS: During April 2-8, 2020, a cross-sectional online survey on surgical practice was distributed to surgeons worldwide through international surgical societies, social media and personal contacts. Main outcome and measures included preventive measures and screening policies of COVID-19 in surgical practice and centers’ experiences of in-hospital COVID-19 infection. Data were analyzed by country’s cumulative deaths number by April 8, 2020 (high risk, >5000; intermediate risk, 100-5000; low risk, <100). RESULTS: A total of 936 centers in 71 countries responded to the survey (high risk, 330 centers; intermediate risk, 242 centers; low risk, 364 centers). In the majority (71.9%) of the centers, local guidelines recommended preoperative testing based on symptoms or suspicious radiologic findings. Universal testing for every surgical patient was recommended in only 18.4% of the centers. In-hospital COVID-19 infection was reported from 31.5% of the centers, with higher rates in higher risk countries (high risk, 53.6%; intermediate risk, 26.4%; low risk, 14.8%; P < 0.001). Of the 295 centers that experienced in-hospital COVID-19 infection, 122 (41.4%) failed to trace it and 58 (19.7%) reported the infection originating from asymptomatic patients/staff members. Higher risk countries adopted more preventive measures including universal testing, routine testing of hospital staff and use of dedicated personal protective equipment in operation theatres, but there were remarkable discrepancies across the countries. CONCLUSIONS: This large international survey captured the global surgical practice under the COVID-19 pandemic and highlighted the insufficient preoperative screening of COVID-19 in the current surgical practice. More intensive screening programs will be necessary particularly in severely affected countries/institutions.

Among 10,429 patients (median age, 45 [IQR 32-57] years; 5597 [53.7%] women), 16 died (0.15%). The infection fatality rate was 0.06% among the 8315 patients treated with HCQ+AZ. No deaths occurred among the 8414 patients younger than 60 years. Older age and male sex were associated with a higher risk of death, ICU transfer, and hospitalization. Treatment with HCQ+AZ (0.17 [0.06-0.48]) was associated with a lower risk of death, independently of age, sex and epidemic period.

Given the complexity of the construct of boredom and its increasing prevalence among adolescents in recent years, the present study aimed to validate the factorial structure of the Italian version of the Multidimensional State Boredom Scale (MSBS) in adolescents using a cross-validation approach. The study involved 272 students (33.8% males, 66.2% females) aged 14–19 (M = 15.9, SD = 1.38) living in northern and central Italy. In addition to the MSBS, the Symptoms Checklist 90-R (SCL 90-R) and the Children’s Depression Inventory (CDI) were administered. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses validated a 23-item structure of the MSBS, comprising five correlated factors. The tool showed a good internal consistency for these factors and a good convergent and factor validity. The MSBS consequently seems a valid and reliable method for assessing boredom in adolescence. The cut-off for the total score that could pinpoint cases posing a potential clinical risk was 88. A weak correlation was found between the total level of boredom and the daily Internet usage, while no relationship emerged between boredom and age, gender, and grades. Since excessive levels of boredom may conceal a general unease that could develop into structured psychological disorders, the value of the MSBS lies in enabling us to identify in advance adolescents at potential clinical risk.","Spoto, Andrea; Iannattone, Sara; Valentini, Perla; Raffagnato, Alessia; Miscioscia, Marina; Gatta, Michela",Children (Basel),107,2

Our purpose in this paper is to consider what posthuman affirmative business ethics would look like, and to reflect on the shift in thinking and practice this would involve. The need for a revised understanding of human–animal relations in business ethics is amplified by crises such as climate change and pandemics that are related to ecologically destructive business practices such as factory farming. In this analysis, we use feminist speculative fiction as a resource for reimagination and posthuman ethical thinking. By focusing on three ethical movements experienced by a central character named Toby in Margaret Atwood’s MaddAddam trilogy, we show how she is continually becoming through affective, embodied encounters with human and nonhuman others. In the discussion, we consider the vulnerability that arises from openness to affect which engenders heightened response-ability to and with, rather than for, multiple others. This expanded concept of subjectivity enables a more relational understanding of equality that is urgently needed in order to respond affirmatively to posthuman futures.","Sayers, Janet; Martin, Lydia; Bell, Emma",J Bus Ethics,107,26

Case morbidity and mortality rates for any type of infection have always been much higher in CKD, haemodialysis (HD) and RT patients than in the general population. A large study comparing COVID-19 outcome in moderate to advanced CKD (Stages 3–5), HD and RT patients with a control group of patients is still lacking. METHODS: We conducted a multicentre, retrospective, observational study, involving hospitalized adult patients with COVID-19 from 47 centres in Turkey. Patients with CKD Stages 3–5, chronic HD and RT were compared with patients who had COVID-19 but no kidney disease. Demographics, comorbidities, medications, laboratory tests, COVID-19 treatments and outcome [in-hospital mortality and combined in-hospital outcome mortality or admission to the intensive care unit (ICU)] were compared. RESULTS: A total of 1210 patients were included [median age, 61 (quartile 1–quartile 3 48–71) years, female 551 (45.5%)] composed of four groups: control (n = 450), HD (n = 390), RT (n = 81) and CKD (n = 289). The ICU admission rate was 266/1210 (22.0%). A total of 172/1210 (14.2%) patients died. The ICU admission and in-hospital mortality rates in the CKD group [114/289 (39.4%); 95% confidence interval (CI) 33.9–45.2; and 82/289 (28.4%); 95% CI 23.9–34.5)] were significantly higher than the other groups: HD = 99/390 (25.4%; 95% CI 21.3–29.9; P < 0.001) and 63/390 (16.2%; 95% CI 13.0–20.4; P < 0.001); RT = 17/81 (21.0%; 95% CI 13.2–30.8; P = 0.002) and 9/81 (11.1%; 95% CI 5.7–19.5; P = 0.001); and control = 36/450 (8.0%; 95% CI 5.8–10.8; P < 0.001) and 18/450 (4%; 95% CI 2.5–6.2; P < 0.001). Adjusted mortality and adjusted combined outcomes in CKD group and HD groups were significantly higher than the control group [hazard ratio (HR) (95% CI) CKD: 2.88 (1.52–5.44); P = 0.001; 2.44 (1.35–4.40); P = 0.003; HD: 2.32 (1.21–4.46); P = 0.011; 2.25 (1.23–4.12); P = 0.008), respectively], but these were not significantly different in the RT from in the control group [HR (95% CI) 1.89 (0.76–4.72); P = 0.169; 1.87 (0.81–4.28); P = 0.138, respectively]. CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalized COVID-19 patients with CKDs, including Stages 3–5 CKD, HD and RT, have significantly higher mortality than patients without kidney disease. Stages 3–5 CKD patients have an in-hospital mortality rate as much as HD patients, which may be in part because of similar age and comorbidity burden. We were unable to assess if RT patients were or were not at increased risk for in-hospital mortality because of the relatively small sample size of the RT patients in this study.","Ozturk, Savas; Turgutalp, Kenan; Arici, Mustafa; Odabas, Ali Riza; Altiparmak, Mehmet Riza; Aydin, Zeki; Cebeci, Egemen; Basturk, Taner; Soypacaci, Zeki; Sahin, Garip; Elif Ozler, Tuba; Kara, Ekrem; Dheir, Hamad; Eren, Necmi; Suleymanlar, Gultekin; Islam, Mahmud; Ogutmen, Melike Betul; Sengul, Erkan; Ayar, Yavuz; Dolarslan, Murside Esra; Bakirdogen, Serkan; Safak, Seda; Gungor, Ozkan; Sahin, Idris; Mentese, Ilay Berke; Merhametsiz, Ozgur; Oguz, Ebru Gok; Genek, Dilek Gibyeli; Alpay, Nadir; Aktas, Nimet; Duranay, Murat; Alagoz, Selma; Colak, Hulya; Adibelli, Zelal; Pembegul, Irem; Hur, Ender; Azak, Alper; Taymez, Dilek Guven; Tatar, Erhan; Kazancioglu, Rumeyza; Oruc, Aysegul; Yuksel, Enver; Onan, Engin; Turkmen, Kultigin; Hasbal, Nuri Baris; Gurel, Ali; Yelken, Berna; Sahutoglu, Tuncay; Gok, Mahmut; Seyahi, Nurhan; Sevinc, Mustafa; Ozkurt, Sultan; Sipahi, Savas; Bek, Sibel Gokcay; Bora, Feyza; Demirelli, Bulent; Oto, Ozgur Akin; Altunoren, Orcun; Tuglular, Serhan Zubeyde; Demir, Mehmet Emin; Ayli, Mehmet Deniz; Huddam, Bulent; Tanrisev, Mehmet; Bozaci, Ilter; Gursu, Meltem; Bakar, Betul; Tokgoz, Bulent; Tonbul, Halil Zeki; Yildiz, Alaattin; Sezer, Siren; Ates, Kenan",Nephrol Dial Transplant,107,27

A cluster of these cases had appeared in Wuhan, a city in the Hubei Province of China. These infections were found to be caused by a new coronavirus which was given the name “2019 novel coronavirus” (2019-nCoV). It was later renamed “severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2,” or SARS-CoV-2 by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses on February 11, 2020. It was named SARS-CoV-2 due to its close genetic similarity to the coronavirus which caused the SARS outbreak in 2002 (SARS-CoV-1). The aim of this review is to provide information, primarily to the food industry, regarding a range of biocides effective in eliminating or reducing the presence of coronaviruses from fomites, skin, oral/nasal mucosa, air, and food contact surfaces. As several EPA approved sanitizers against SARS-CoV-2 are commonly used by food processors, these compounds are primarily discussed as much of the industry already has them on site and is familiar with their application and use. Specifically, we focused on the effects of alcohols, povidone iodine, quaternary ammonium compounds, hydrogen peroxide, sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), peroxyacetic acid (PAA), chlorine dioxide, ozone, ultraviolet light, metals, and plant-based antimicrobials. This review highlights the differences in the resistance or susceptibility of different strains of coronaviruses, or similar viruses, to these antimicrobial agents.","Dev Kumar, Govindaraj; Mishra, Abhinav; Dunn, Laurel; Townsend, Anna; Oguadinma, Ikechukwu Chukwuma; Bright, Kelly R.; Gerba, Charles P.",Front Microbiol,107,16

As elective cardiac surgical services resume back to normal, clinicians will encounter COVID-19 recovered patients for cardiac surgery. The hyper-immune pathophysiology of COVID-19 and exposure to inflammation of cardiac surgery, cardiopulmonary bypass, mechanical ventilation, blood transfusion, and perioperative infections could lead to exacerbated responses exemplified by systemic inflammatory response syndrome and cascade to multi-organ dysfunction syndromes. We present a case of a coronary artery disease undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery after the institutional protocol of two COVID-19 RT-PCR tests were reported negative. Intraoperatively, unexplained hypoxemia was observed, which warranted CPB support to complete the grafting. At multiple attempts of failed weaning, IABP and high inotropes helped to wean. The patient had a stormy postoperative course with low oxygenation, bleeding, low cardiac output syndrome, rhabdomyolysis of lower limb muscles, requiring multiple blood and blood product transfusion, and renal replacement therapy. Despite the corrective measures, severe hyperkalemia, and cardiac arrest ensued. IgG antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 virus were tested considering the unexplained hypoxemia. A ‘convalescent COVID-19’ patient with ‘first hit’ at primary infection, encountering a ‘second hit’ of surgery and perioperative insults might result in a hyper-immune response. This ‘second hit’ hypothesis should be considered when COVID-19 convalescent (COVID-19 disease symptomatic or asymptomatic) patients undergo cardiac surgery and present with unusual complications.","Damodaran, Srinath; Joshi, Shreedhar S.; Kumar, Sunil; Natarajan, Pooja; Patangi, Sanjay Orathi; Kumaran, Thiruthani",J Cardiothorac Vasc Anesth,107,28

METHODS: A retrospective multicentre cohort study was conducted during the first wave of COVID-19 in France in 18 tertiary referral maternity units. Consecutive women with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 during pregnancy or the delivery hospitalisation were included between March and July 2020 (17-week period). We report clinical, obstetrical and anaesthetic outcomes of pregnant women with COVID-19 and report the prevalence of severe forms and risk factors for respiratory support in this cohort. RESULTS: There were 126 included cases; RT-PCR testing occurred in 82 cases, of which 64 (78%) had a positive test. The caesarean section rate was 52%, and preterm delivery (< 37 weeks) rate was 40%. Neuraxial anaesthesia was performed in 108 (86%) cases with an increasing proportion compared to general anaesthesia over time (p < 0.0002). Twenty-eight cases received oxygen supplementation (nasal oxygen therapy or mechanical ventilation); the SOFAresp score was associated with gestational age at the time of COVID-19 presentation (p = 0.0036) and at delivery (p < 0.0001). Postpartum intensive care unit (ICU) admission occurred in 21 cases (17%) with 17 (13%) receiving invasive or non-invasive ventilation. Pre-delivery factors associated with postpartum ventilation were oxygen support, oxygen saturation and haemoglobin levels. CONCLUSION: In our cohort, COVID-19 was associated with significant maternal morbidity resulting in high ICU admission rates (17%) and invasive or non-invasive ventilation utilisation (10%).","Keita, Hawa; James, Arthur; Bouvet, Lionel; Herrmann, Emilie; Le Gouez, Agnès; Mazoit, Jean-Xavier; Mercier, Frédéric-Jean; Benhamou, Dan",Anaesth Crit Care Pain Med,107,26

In the background of the current COVID-19 pandemic, serological tests are being used to assess past infection and immunity against SARS-CoV-2. This knowledge is paramount to determine the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 through the post pandemic period. Several individuals belonging to households with an index COVID-19 patient, reported symptoms of COVID-19 but discrepant serology results. Methods. Here we investigated the humoral and cellular immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 in seven families, including nine index patients and eight contacts, who had evidence of serological discordances within the households. Ten unexposed healthy donors were enrolled as controls. Results. All index patients recovered from a mild COVID-19. They all developed anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and a significant T cell response detectable up to 69 days after symptom onset. Six of the eight contacts reported COVID-19 symptoms within 1 to 7 days after the index patients but all were SARS-CoV-2 seronegative. Six out of eight contacts developed a SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell response against structural and/or accessory proteins that lasts up to 80 days post symptom onset suggesting a past SARS-CoV-2 infection. Conclusion. Exposure to SARS-CoV-2 can induce virus-specific T cell responses without seroconversion. T cell responses may be more sensitive indicators of SARS-Co-V-2 exposure than antibodies. Our results indicate that epidemiological data relying only on the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies may lead to a substantial underestimation of prior exposure to the virus","Gallais, Floriane; Velay, Aurelie; Wendling, Marie-Josee; Nazon, Charlotte; Partisani, Marialuisa; Sibilia, Jean; Candon, Sophie; Fafi-Kremer, Samira",,107,33

Environmental stressors can significantly challenge parental well-being. AIMS: To investigate how COVID-19 and associated restrictions influence mood and parenting confidence of expectant parents and those in early parenthood, identifying barriers and facilitators. METHOD: We used a cross-sectional online survey to collect data from 590 expectant parents and parents of infants (564 women) during the most restrictive phase of lockdown in the UK. We included a mixture of forced-choice and open-ended questions pertaining to mood, perceived social support, media use, online interactions and parenting expectations. Quantitative data were analysed with multiple linear regression and proportional odds models; an inductive thematic analysis was used for qualitative data. Quantitative and qualitative data were qualitatively synthesised. RESULTS: Since COVID-19, expectant parents and parents of new-borns reported a decrease in mood and parenting confidence. Barriers included practical difficulties (finding essentials, reliable health information), social difficulties (loss of physical contact, decreased support) and uncertainty during pregnancy. Facilitators included support from others and, for first-time parents, loss of child care resulting in greater parenting confidence. Although online resources and communication were not preferable to face-to-face interactions, technology was a helpful tool for communicating, getting support, and finding essentials and information during lockdown. CONCLUSIONS: By mid-May 2020, mood and parenting confidence among expectant and parents of new-borns in the UK were significantly reduced. Consideration of barriers and facilitators in healthcare and psychological support provided is likely important for promoting parental mental health and healthy parent–child relationships.","Perez, Alejandra; Panagiotopoulou, Elena; Curtis, Peter; Roberts, Ruth",BJPsych Open,107,1

We sought to characterize the clinical course of COVID-19 among IBD patients and evaluate the association between demographics, clinical characteristics, and immunosuppressant treatments on COVID-19 outcomes. Methods Surveillance Epidemiology of Coronavirus Under Research Exclusion for Inflammatory Bowel Disease (SECURE-IBD) is a large, international registry created to monitor outcomes of IBD patients with confirmed COVID-19. We calculated age-standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) and utilized multivariable logistic regression to identify factors associated with severe COVID-19, defined as intensive care unit admission, ventilator use, and/or death. Results 525 cases from 33 countries were reported (Median age 43 years, 53% men). Thirty-seven patients (7%) had severe COVID-19, 161 (31%) were hospitalized, and 16 patients died (3% case fatality rate). SMRs for IBD patients were 1.8 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.9-2.6), 1.5 (95% CI 0.7-2.2), and 1.7 (95% CI 0.9-2.5) relative to data from China, Italy, and the US, respectively. Risk factors for severe COVID-19 among IBD patients included increasing age (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.04, 95% CI 1.01-1.02), ≥2 comorbidities (aOR 2.9, 95% CI 1.1-7.8), systemic corticosteroids (aOR 6.9, 95% CI 2.3-20.5), and sulfasalazine or 5-aminosalicylate use (aOR 3.1, 95% CI 1.3-7.7). TNF antagonist treatment was not associated with severe COVID-19 (aOR 0.9, 95% CI 0.4-2.2). Conclusions Increasing age, comorbidities, and corticosteroids are associated with severe COVID-19 among IBD patients, although a causal relationship cannot be definitively established. Notably, TNF antagonists do not appear to be associated with severe COVID-19.","Brenner, Erica J.; Ungaro, Ryan C.; Gearry, Richard B.; Kaplan, Gilaad G.; Kissous-Hunt, Michele; Lewis, James D.; Ng, Siew C.; Rahier, Jean-Francois; Reinisch, Walter; Ruemmele, Frank M.; Steinwurz, Flavio; Underwood, Fox E.; Zhang, Xian; Colombel, Jean-Frederic; Kappelman, Michael D.",Gastroenterology,107,21

However, there is still a lack of comparative studies on the mental health of front-line HWs in the initial phase of the lockdown and 1 month after the lifting of the lockdown. Methods: We recruited 1717 HWs during the initial phase of the lockdown and 2214 HWs 1 month after the lifting of the lockdown, and their baseline characteristics and psychiatric health in these two phases were compared. Furthermore, Pearson's Chi-square test and multivariate logistic regression analysis were used to determine the possible risk factors associated with depressive symptoms in the front-line HWs. Results: Compared with the initial phase of the lockdown, the proportion of HWs with anxiety symptoms and stress decreased, while the proportion of HWs with depressive symptoms increased a month after the lifting of the lockdown. Male sex, exercise habit, comorbidities, and having family members or relatives with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection were significantly related to the increased incidence of depressive symptoms during the initial phase of the lockdown. Comorbidities, negative effect of media coverage, working >4 days a week, lower annual household income, and deteriorating relationships with family members were associated with depressive symptoms a month after the lifting of the lockdown. Conclusion: The increased proportion of HWs with depressive symptoms 1 month after the lifting of the lockdown suggested that mental health of front-line HWs should be a top-priority issue, not only during, but also after the pandemic.","Qiu, Xiuli; Lan, Yan; Miao, Jinfeng; Wang, Hui; Wang, He; Wu, Jianhong; Li, Guo; Zhao, Xin; Cao, Ziqin; Mei, Junhua; Sun, Wenzhe; Zhu, Zhou; Zhu, Suiqiang; Wang, Wei",Front Psychiatry,107,8

Only few of those in need for treatment seek professional help. Therefore, easily accessible interventions are required. While several evidence-based internet- and mobile-based interventions (IMIs) have been proposed, little is known about medical students' attitudes towards using them. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to explore the views of medical students on IMIs as well as facilitators and barriers to use them and gain first insights into their preferences for tailored IMIs. METHODS: We conducted four focus groups with 26 medical students enrolled at a German medical school in March 2020. Focus groups were audio-recorded, transcribed and analyzed following established approaches for qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: Medical students valued IMIs for their low-threshold and flexible access, their potential to bridge waiting times and as a first step towards face-to-face-therapy. However, medical students preferred face-to-face interventions in case of severe mental health problems. The main disadvantages named by students included difficulties to find or decide on suitable IMIs based on clear quality criteria, fear of a misdiagnosis and lack of personalisation and human interaction. Some students also questioned the effectiveness of IMIs. Easy handling, flexible use, data safety and easily understandable terms of use were believed to facilitate the uptake of IMIs, whereas technical problems, frequent notifications, required internet access, need to register, lack of anonymity, high time expenditure and costs were reported to hinder their use. Most students did not prefer IMIs tailored to medical students but rather wanted to use IMIs suitable for students of all disciplines. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest overall positive views regarding IMIs for mental health promotion but concerns regarding their use for severe mental disorders and acute crises. Our findings indicate that IMIs may represent promising tools for stress prevention and early interventions for medical students. Students explicitly stated to prefer quality-approved IMIs recommended and provided by their university.","Dederichs, Melina; Weber, Jeannette; Pischke, Claudia R.; Angerer, Peter; Apolinário-Hagen, Jennifer",Internet Interv,107,29

METHODS: We recorded the recovery status of 67 inpatients with hypertension and COVID-19 induced pneumonia in the Raytheon Mountain Hospital in Wuhan during February 12, 2020 and March 30, 2020. Patients treated with ACEI or ARBs were categorized in group A (n = 22), while patients who were not administered either ACEI or ARBs were categorized into group B (n = 45). We did a comparative analysis of various parameters such as the pneumonia progression, length-of-stay in the hospital, and the level of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), serum creatinine (Cr), and creatine kinase (CK) between the day when these patients were admitted to the hospital and the day when the treatment ended. RESULTS: These 67 hypertension cases counted for 33.17% of the total COVID-19 patients. There was no significant difference in the usage of drug treatment of COVID-19 between groups A and B (p > 0.05). During the treatment, 1 case in group A and 3 cases in group B progressed from mild pneumonia into severe pneumonia. Eventually, all patients were cured and discharged after treatment, and no recurrence of COVID-2019 induced pneumonia occurred after the discharge. The length of stays was shorter in group A as compared with group B, but there was no significant difference (p > 0.05). There was also no significant difference in other general parameters between the patients of the groups A and B on the day of admission to the hospital (p > 0.05). The ALT, CK, and Cr levels did not significantly differ between groups A and B on the day of admission and the day of discharge (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: To treat the hypertension patients with COVID-19 caused pneumonia, anti-hypertensive drugs (ACEs and ARBs) may be used according to the relative guidelines. The treatment regimen with these drugs does not need to be altered for the COVID-19 patients.","Wang, Wenjun; Zhao, Xiaohui; Wei, Wei; Fan, Weiwang; Gao, Kai; He, Shengxiu; Zhuang, Xijing",BMC Infect Dis,107,24

However, continuity of care is lacking in many countries. Several studies have shown that case management can help to meet these requirements in health care and investigated positive effects. The project RubiN (Regional ununterbrochen betreut im Netz; Continuous care in a regional network) was developed to provide regional care- and case management for outpatient care of the elderly (age >70 years) in a primary care setting. The aim of this qualitative approach was to explore experiences and attitudes of geriatric patients towards the newly developed complex care- and case-management intervention RubiN. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Qualitative interviews with a purposive sample of geriatric patients enlisted in the RubiN intervention networks were conducted. The collected data was transcribed and evaluated using qualitative content analysis. A deductive-inductive approach was used in generating thematic categories. RESULTS: Forty-four telephone interviews were performed. Two key categories were identified to describe patients’ experiences regarding care delivered by a care- and case manager (CCM), namely “role of CCM” and “changes through RubiN”. Results demonstrated that care performed by CCMs is perceived positively by geriatric patients. A main finding of this study was that geriatric patients experienced a sense of security through the care provided by CCMs. CCMs were perceived as highly competent people, having all the necessary skills to provide continuity of care. CONCLUSION: This study illustrates the importance of trust between care provider and care recipient. It also shows that geriatric patients appreciate the continuous, professional care and structural and functional support provided by qualified CCMs.","Wilfling, Denise; Warkentin, Nicole; Laag, Sonja; Goetz, Katja",Patient Prefer Adherence,107,30

An abrupt halt in the majority of the urban activities reduced the generation of anthropogenic heat which often exacerbates the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect in the urban pockets of the country. We studied the lockdown impact on seven highly populated and polluted mega urban agglomerations across India, namely Delhi, Ahmedabad, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Mumbai, Bengaluru and Chennai, using near-anniversary Landsat 8 data. The results revealed that the lockdowns have improved the air quality and reduced the Land Surface Temperature (LST) and hence the UHI effect over these cities. Each of the cities experienced an improved Air Quality Index (AQI) ranging from 18 to 151 units except Chennai (with a marginal 8 units increase in AQI), a decrease in mean LST in the range of 0.27 °C to 7.06 °C except Kolkata which showed an increment by â¼4 °C, and a reduction in daily averaged air temperature ranging from 0.3 °C to 10.88 °C except Hyderabad which witnessed an increase of 0.09 °C during the lockdown (April 2020) compared to the previous years (April 2019 and 2018).

In addition to the variations in regional land use and land cover and proportion of essential industries that remained operational throughout the lockdown, the geographic location, topography, local meteorology and climate were some of the other factors also responsible for either aiding or overcompensating the large scale LST variabilities observed in these cities. These results hint at an unprecedented opportunity to evaluate the effectiveness of periodic planned lockdowns as a possible mitigating measure to reduce LST spikes and degraded air quality in urban areas in the future.","Nanda, Dhruv; Mishra, Deepk R; Swain, Debadatta",Environ Sci Process Impacts,107,20

It is relatively rare, with a prevalence of 10 cases per 100 000 individuals. The criterion standard in the management of achalasia is laparoscopic Heller’s myotomy with partial fundoplication. Esophageal perforation is one of the earliest major complications that could be managed by primary repair. However, it has been reported that esophageal perforations in achalasia cases can be managed with esophageal stenting after primary repair failure. CASE REPORT: We are reporting a case of achalasia after Heller’s myotomy in a 37-year-old man, which was complicated by iatrogenic esophageal perforation and was successfully managed by esophageal stenting after failed primary repair. CONCLUSIONS: Esophageal stenting is a safe and effective management in cases of esophageal perforation after Heller’s myotomy procedure.","AlHajjaj, Ghadeer M.; AlTaweel, Fatimah Yasser; AlQunais, Roaya Ahmed; Alshammasi, Zahra H.; Alshomimi, Saeed J.",Am J Case Rep,107,16

This respiratory virus has different symptoms from moderate to severe, and results in lung pneumonia following acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and patient’s death in severe cases. ARDS is a severe form of acute lung injury that is caused by high inflammatory response of the innate immunity cells. Hypoxia is the common feature in the inflammatory sites with having various impacts on this condition by induction of some factors such as hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α). HIF-1α regulates some important cellular processes including cell proliferation, metabolism and angiogenesis. Furthermore, this factor is activated during the immune responses and plays important roles in the inflammation site by inducing pro-inflammatory cytokines production through immune cells. So, in this study the possible effect of the HIF-1α on the COVID-19 pathogenesis with emphasizes on its role on innate immunity response has been discussed.","Jahani, Mozhgan; Dokaneheifard, Sadat; Mansouri, Kamran",J Inflamm (Lond),107,16

Although, SARS-CoV-2 primarily causes lung infection, a variety of symptoms have proven a systemic impact on the body. SARS-CoV-2 has spread in the community quickly infecting humans from all age, ethnicities and gender. However, fatal outcomes have been linked to specific host factors and co-morbidities such as age, hypertension, immuno-deficiencies, chronic lung diseases or metabolic disorders. A major shift in the microbiome of patients suffering of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have also been observed and is linked to a worst outcome of the disease. As many co-morbidities are already known to be associated with a dysbiosis of the microbiome such as hypertension, diabetes and metabolic disorders.

RESEARCH QUESTION: Retrospective cohort study to assess clinical outcomes of 945 patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis, presenting with COVID 19, compared to a propensity matched cohort of patients without sarcoidosis. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Analysis of a multi-center research network TriNETX was performed including patients more than 16 years of age diagnosed with COVID-19. Outcomes in COVID-19 positive patients with concurrent pulmonary sarcoidosis were compared with a propensity score matched cohort of patients without pulmonary sarcoidosis. RESULTS: A total of 278,271 patients with COVID-19 on the research network were identified, 954 patients (0.34%) carried a diagnosis of pulmonary sarcoidosis. Mean age of patients with sarcoidosis was 56.3 ± 13.2 years, with female predominance (n=619, 64.89%). 49.69% of the participants were African American (n=474). Co-morbidities including hypertension, chronic lower respiratory diseases, diabetes mellitus, ischemic heart disease, nicotine dependence, and chronic kidney disease were more common in patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis when compared to the non-pulmonary sarcoidosis cohort (all p values <0.01). In unmatched analysis, pulmonary sarcoidosis group had higher mortality, increased risk for hospitalization, intubation and need for renal replacement therapy. After propensity score matching, no difference in any of the outcome measures was observed. INTERPRETATION: Crude COVID-19 mortality and other clinical outcome measures are poor in pulmonary sarcoidosis cohort; however, propensity-matched analyses revealed no difference in outcomes, showing that higher mortality is driven by higher burden of comorbidities.","Hadi, Yousaf B.; Lakhani, Dhairya A.; Naqvi, Syeda F.Z.; Singh, Shailendra; Kupec, Justin T.",Respir Med,107,17

METHODS: New cases of Covid-19 disease and new tests were calculated from raw data freely available on the Italian governing website. The effectiveness of Italian government Decrees aiming to obtain lock-down was assessed by fractal investigation. Self-similarity parameters of presumed fractal shapes obtained 6 days after each Decree were estimated, when possible. Self-organized criticality was also assessed to check for chaos involvement in disturbing the fractal shapes. Shapes were then compared and were used to estimate the number of new tests for Sars-Cov-2 that Italy would be able to perform. RESULTS: The full lock-down changed the biocomplexity of the Covid-19 epidemic in Italy. If the biocomplexity of Covid-19 did not change after the lock-down, Italy should have been able to perform at least 25490 tests daily (±8940) on average, while real data show that a larger number of tests were done (p<0.001) (thereby obtaining the lowering of contagions). If the same biocomplexity was observed before full lock down, Italy would be able to perform 7088 tests daily (±5163) on average, while real data show that a lower number of tests were done (p=0.029) (thereby observing the worsening of contagions).

The purpose of the service is to assist recovery after hospital discharges or other sudden changes in a patient’s functional level. The service is often provided by a team of nurses, physiotherapists, and occupational therapists. The purpose of this paper is to compare users of this service to users who receive traditional home care services. Outcomes to be measured are risk of long-term care and mortality. METHODS: All users of health and care services in a Norwegian municipality were eligible for inclusion. Data was extracted from the local user administrative database. Users were divided in two groups: those who received reablement and those home care users who did not receive reablement service. Propensity score matching was used to match users based on age, sex, and level of functioning in activities of daily living (ADL). Survival analysis was deployed to test if the reablement users had different risk of becoming long-term care users, and whether the mortality rate differed for this group. RESULTS: 153 reablement users were included in the study. These were matched to 153 non-reablement home care users. The groups had similar distributions of age, sex, and level of functioning when starting their service trajectories. Regressions showed that reablement users had lower risk of using long-term care services in the study period (time at risk up to 4 years), and lower mortality. However, none of these estimates were statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: The study indicates that the reablement users in one municipality had lower use of long -term care and lower mortality when properly estimated, but numbers were too small for statistical significance to be found.

Gene amplification, a common adaptive mechanism in prokaryotes, archaea, and eukaryotes, has also contributed to viral evolution, especially of large DNA viruses. In experimental systems, gene amplification is one mechanism for rapidly overcoming selective pressures. Because the amplification generally incurs a fitness cost, emergence of adaptive point mutations within the amplified locus or elsewhere in the genome can enable collapse of the locus back to a single copy. Evidence of gene amplification followed by subfunctionalization or neofunctionalization of the copies is apparent by the presence of families of paralogous genes in many DNA viruses. These observations suggest that copy number variation has contributed broadly to virus evolution.","Bayer, Avraham; Brennan, Greg; Geballe, Adam P.",Current Opinion in Virology,107,1

The aim of this systematic review was to answer the question: Is high-dose AR drug holiday, at the time of tooth extraction or dentoalveolar surgery, necessary to prevent the development of MRONJ in patients with cancer? This protocol was registered in the PROSPERO database. Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) were searched for relevant studies up to and including April 2019. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), cohort and cross-sectional studies, surveys, and case reports with more than five patients were included. Records were imported into www.covidence.org. Electronic searches were supplemented by manual searches and reference linkage. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta Analysis (PRISMA) were followed. Although only one study fitted the population, intervention, comparison, outcome (PICO) framework, valuable information on AR drug holiday could be extracted from 14 of 371 reviewed articles. Among these, 3 were prospective and 11 were retrospective studies. These studies described or evaluated high-dose AR drug holidays. In 2 studies, patients were being treated with denosumab, but neither showed that a drug holiday was effective. The remaining 12 studies evaluated bisphosphonate treatment and 2 of these studies found no reason to use AR drug holiday before surgery. Three studies recommended drug holidays, whereas most of the studies recommended assessing each patient separately. The only paper that fitted the PICO approach was a non-randomized, prospective study with a control group. This study concluded that drug holiday was not necessary. Thus, there are no evidence for using drug holiday, but it is also clear that caused by a limited numbers of eligible patients, and a great variation in between these patient, high-level evidence for using AR drug holiday is almost impossible to obtain.","Ottesen, Camilla; Schiodt, Morten; Gotfredsen, Klaus",Heliyon,107,27

However, we are facing the COVID-19 pandemic without a clear understanding of the pathophysiology of the disease. As we are fighting against a viral infection, drugs previously developed or approved to treat other viral infections or that exhibit a broad-spectrum antiviral activity, anti-inflammatory drugs and drugs against cytokine storm are currently being tested. Unfortunately, the efficacy and safety of these medications remain uncertain, and some may increase the risk of cardiovascular complications in patients with COVID-19. Thus, at the present time, due to the lack of solid scientific data to support a therapeutic strategy, we truly are shooting in the dark with the treatment of COVID-19.

Public health authorities in many countries have introduced contact tracing apps to track and trace infected persons as part of measures to contain the spread of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus 2. However, there are major concerns about its efficacy and privacy which affects mass acceptance amongst a population. This systematic literature review encompasses the current challenges facing this technology and recommendations to address such challenges in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic in neo-liberal societies. METHODS: The systematic literature review was conducted by searching databases of Google Scholar, Web of Science, PubMed, IEEE Xplore Digital Library, PsycInfo and ScienceDirect using the search terms (“Contact Tracing” OR “Contact Tracing apps”) AND (“COVID-19” OR “Coronavirus”) to identify relevant literature. The searches were run against the title, keywords, or abstract, depending on the search platforms. The searches were conducted between January 1, 2020, through 31st January 2021. Further inputs were also taken from preprints, published government and technical reports. We explore and discuss from the selected literature, the key challenges and issues that influence unwillingness to use these contact tracing apps in neo-liberal societies which include the plausibility of abuse of user privacy rights and lack of trust in the government and public health authorities by their citizens. Other challenges identified and discussed include ethical issues, security vulnerabilities, user behaviour and participation, and technical constraints. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Finally, in the analysis of this systematic literature review, recommendations to address these challenges, future directions, and considerations in the use of digital contact tracing apps and related technologies to contain the spread of future pandemic outbreaks are presented.

RNA-seq analysis of gut colonic organoids prepared from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and normotensive Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats was used to test the hypothesis that impaired interactions between the gut microbiome and gut epithelium are involved and that these would be remediated with butyrate supplementation. Gene expressions in immune responses including antigen presentation and antiviral pathways were decreased in the gut epithelium of the SHR in organoids and confirmed in vivo; these deficits were corrected by butyrate supplementation. Deficits in gene expression driving epithelial proliferation and differentiation were also observed in SHR.

OBSERVATIONS: A 29-year-old man with no prior medical condition presented with a complaint of redness and foreign body sensation in his left eye, which started two days before his consultation. He had no history of decreased vision, pain, photophobia, discharge, ocular surgery, or trauma. He had no symptoms in his fellow eye nor did he have any systemic symptoms. External examination of his left eye revealed a sectoral nasal conjunctival and episcleral injection and a clear cornea. There was no scleral edema. A diagnosis of episcleritis was made based on clinical grounds and topical fluorometholone 0.1%. was started. Three days later, the patient presented with headache, shortness of breath, cough, and fever (39.2 °C). Real-time fluorescence polymerase chain reaction test of his nasopharyngeal swab returned a positive result for COVID-19. The patient was then admitted for observation and supportive therapy. After five days, fever, respiratory and ocular symptoms were markedly improved and the patient was discharged and advised to isolate at home for 14 days. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPORTANCE: This is the first report that describes episcleritis as a possible presenting sign of COVID-19. Understanding the association between ocular signs/symptoms and COVID-19 can aid in the diagnosis of the viral infection and can help in limiting its transmission.","Otaif, Wael; Al Somali, Abdulaziz Ismail; Al Habash, Ahmed",Am J Ophthalmol Case Rep,107,3

During replication, 1a provides RNA capping, NTPase and possibly RNA helicase functions. Here we identify in BMV 1a an amphipathic α-helix, helix A, and use NMR analysis to define its structure and propensity to insert in hydrophobic membrane-mimicking micelles. We show that helix A is essential for efficient 1a–ER membrane association and normal perinuclear ER localization, and that deletion or mutation of helix A abolishes RNA replication. Strikingly, mutations in helix A give rise to two dramatically opposite 1a function phenotypes, implying that helix A acts as a molecular switch regulating the intricate balance between separable 1a functions. One class of helix A deletions and amino acid substitutions markedly inhibits 1a–membrane association and abolishes ER membrane invagination, viral RNA template recruitment, and replication, but doubles the 1a-mediated increase in 2a(Pol) accumulation. The second class of helix A mutations not only maintains efficient 1a–membrane association but also amplifies the number of 1a-induced membrane invaginations 5- to 8-fold and enhances viral RNA template recruitment, while failing to stimulate 2a(Pol) accumulation. The results provide new insights into the pathways of RNA replication complex assembly and show that helix A is critical for assembly and function of the viral RNA replication complex, including its central role in targeting replication components and controlling modes of 1a action.","Liu, Ling; Westler, William M.; den Boon, Johan A.; Wang, Xiaofeng; Diaz, Arturo; Steinberg, H.

We analyzed the COVID-19 data from the nationwide health insurance claims of South Korea. Data on demographic characteristics, comorbidities, and mortality records of patients with COVID-19 were extracted from the database. The odds ratios of mortality according to comorbidities in these patients with and without adjustment for age and sex were calculated. The predictive value of the original Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) and the age-adjusted CCI (ACCI) for mortality in these patients were investigated using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Among 7590 patients, 227 (3.0%) had died. After age and sex adjustment, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure, dementia, chronic pulmonary disease, liver disease, renal disease, and cancer were significant risk factors for mortality. The ROC curve analysis showed that an ACCI threshold > 3.5 yielded the best cut-off point for predicting mortality (area under the ROC 0.92; 95% confidence interval 0.91–0.94). Our study revealed multiple risk factors for mortality in patients with COVID-19. The high predictive power of the ACCI for mortality in our results can support the importance of old age and comorbidities in the severity of COVID-19.","Cho, Soo Ick; Yoon, Susie; Lee, Ho-Jin",Sci Rep,107,30

Many research studies on chest diseases rely on the strengths of deep learning techniques. Although some of these studies used state-of-the-art techniques and were able to deliver promising results, these techniques are not very useful if they can detect only one type of disease without detecting the others. OBJECTIVE: The main objective of this study was to achieve a fast and more accurate diagnosis of COVID-19. This study proposes a diagnostic technique that classifies COVID-19 x-ray images from normal x-ray images and those specific to 14 other chest diseases. METHODS: In this paper, we propose a novel, multilevel pipeline, based on deep learning models, to detect COVID-19 along with other chest diseases based on x-ray images. This pipeline reduces the burden of a single network to classify a large number of classes. The deep learning models used in this study were pretrained on the ImageNet dataset, and transfer learning was used for fast training. The lungs and heart were segmented from the whole x-ray images and passed onto the first classifier that checks whether the x-ray is normal, COVID-19 affected, or characteristic of another chest disease. If it is neither a COVID-19 x-ray image nor a normal one, then the second classifier comes into action and classifies the image as one of the other 14 diseases. RESULTS: We show how our model uses state-of-the-art deep neural networks to achieve classification accuracy for COVID-19 along with 14 other chest diseases and normal cases based on x-ray images, which is competitive with currently used state-of-the-art models. Due to the lack of data in some classes such as COVID-19, we applied 10-fold cross-validation through the ResNet50 model. Our classification technique thus achieved an average training accuracy of 96.04% and test accuracy of 92.52% for the first level of classification (ie, 3 classes). For the second level of classification (ie, 14 classes), our technique achieved a maximum training accuracy of 88.52% and test accuracy of 66.634% by using ResNet50. We also found that when all the 16 classes were classified at once, the overall accuracy for COVID-19 detection decreased, which in the case of ResNet50 was 88.92% for training data and 71.905% for test data. CONCLUSIONS: Our proposed pipeline can detect COVID-19 with a higher accuracy along with detecting 14 other chest diseases based on x-ray images. This is achieved by dividing the classification task into multiple steps rather than classifying them collectively.","Albahli, Saleh; Yar, Ghulam Nabi Ahmad Hassan",J Med Internet Res,107,16

We aimed to study peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets in COVID-19 patients and to correlate these subsets with clinical and laboratory data, which may help in clarifying the pathogenesis to develop novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for COVID-19. METHODS: Twenty-six reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) confirmed COVID-19 patients were subjected to medical history-taking and a thorough clinical examination. Laboratory tests included complete blood count, D dimer, ferritin, and C-reactive protein (CRP). Chest CT was used to diagnose COVID-19 pneumonia. Lymphocyte subsets were compared with those in 20 healthy controls using flow cytometry. RESULTS: Leucopenia, relative neutrophilia, lymphopenia, eosinopenia together with marked elevation in neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio were observed in our COVID-19 patients. A marked reduction was observed in T cells, including both CD4 and CD8 cells, natural killer (NK), and natural killer T cells (NKT). Double-positive T (DPT) cells, double-negative T (DNT) cells, and B cells were elevated in the patients relative to the other lymphocyte subsets. CONCLUSION: Immune-inflammatory parameters are of utmost importance in understanding the pathogenesis and in the provisional diagnosis of COVID-19. Yet, adequate care must be taken during their interpretation because of the vast discrepancies observed between studies even in the same locality.

Hospitals throughout the world made life-altering resource allocation decisions and prioritised the care of COVID-19 patients. Without effective models to evaluate resource allocation strategies encompassing COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 care, hospitals face the risk of making sub-optimal local resource allocation decisions. A discrete-event-simulation model is proposed in this paper to describe COVID-19, elective surgery, and emergency surgery patient flows. COVID-19-specific patient flows and a surgical patient flow network were constructed based on data of 475 COVID-19 patients and 28,831 non-COVID-19 patients in Addenbrooke’s hospital in the UK. The model enabled the evaluation of three resource allocation strategies, for two COVID-19 wave scenarios: proactive cancellation of elective surgery, reactive cancellation of elective surgery, and ring-fencing operating theatre capacity. The results suggest that a ring-fencing strategy outperforms the other strategies, regardless of the COVID-19 scenario, in terms of total direct deaths and the number of surgeries performed. However, this does come at the cost of 50% more critical care rejections. In terms of aggregate hospital performance, a reactive cancellation strategy prioritising COVID-19 is no longer favourable if more than 7.3% of elective surgeries can be considered life-saving. Additionally, the model demonstrates the impact of timely hospital preparation and staff availability, on the ability to treat patients during a pandemic. The model can aid hospitals worldwide during pandemics and disasters, to evaluate their resource allocation strategies and identify the effect of redefining the prioritisation of patients.","Melman, G.J.; Parlikad, A.K.; Cameron, E.A.B.",Health Care Manag Sci,107,22

We aimed to confirm that GRP78 gene expression was increased in blood of SARS-CoV-2 (+) versus SARS-CoV-2 (−) pneumonia patients. In addition, we aimed to identify drugs that could be repurposed to inhibit GRP78, thus with potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. Gene expression studies were performed in 10 SARS-CoV-2 (−) and 24 SARS-CoV-2 (+) pneumonia patients. A structure-based virtual screen was performed with 10,761 small molecules retrieved from DrugBank, using the GRP78 nucleotide binding domain and substrate binding domain as molecular targets. Results indicated that GRP78 mRNA levels were approximately four times higher in the blood of SARS-CoV-2 (+) versus SARS-CoV-2 (−) pneumonia patients, further suggesting that GRP78 might be a good molecular target to treat Covid-19. In addition, a total of 409 compounds were identified with potential as GRP78 inhibitors. In conclusion, we found preliminary evidence that further proposes GRP78 as a possible molecular target to treat Covid-19 and that many clinically approved drugs bind GRP78 as an off-target effect. We suggest that further work should be urgently carried out to confirm if GRP78 is indeed a good molecular target and if some of those drugs have potential to be repurposed for SARS-CoV-2 antiviral activity.","Palmeira, Andreia; Sousa, Emília; Köseler, Aylin; Sabirli, Ramazan; Gören, Tarık; Türkçüer, İbrahim; Kurt, Özgür; Pinto, Madalena M.; Vasconcelos, M.

The S protein mediates the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into cells through binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors. We measured the viability, intracellular cytokine release, oxidative stress, proinflammatory markers, and THP-1-like macrophage polarization. We observed an increase in apoptosis, ROS generation, MCP-1, and intracellular calcium expression in the THP-1 macrophages. Stimulation with the S protein polarizes the THP-1 macrophages towards proinflammatory futures with an increase in the TNFα and MHC-II M1-like phenotype markers. Treating the cells with an ACE inhibitor, perindopril, at 100 µM reduced apoptosis, ROS, and MHC-II expression induced by S protein. We analyzed the sensitivity of the HUVEC cells after the exposure to a conditioned media (CM) of THP-1 macrophages stimulated with the S protein. The CM induced endothelial cell apoptosis and MCP-1 expression. Treatment with perindopril reduced these effects. However, the direct stimulation of the HUVEC cells with the S protein, slightly increased HIF1α and MCP-1 expression, which was significantly increased by the ACE inhibitor treatment. The S protein stimulation induced ROS generation and changed the mitogenic responses of the PBMCs through the upregulation of TNFα and interleukin (IL)-17 cytokine expression. These effects were reduced by the perindopril (100 µM) treatment. Proteomic analysis of the S protein stimulated THP-1 macrophages with or without perindopril (100 µM) exposed more than 400 differentially regulated proteins. Our results provide a mechanistic analysis suggesting that the blood and vascular components could be activated directly through S protein systemically present in the circulation and that the activation of the local renin angiotensin system may be partially involved in this process.

Deferral of these visits may have critical health impact, including delayed diagnosis for melanoma and other skin cancers. We examined the influence of the pandemic on skin biopsy rates in a large population-based cohort. METHODS: Using a universal health care claims dataset from Ontario, we examined skin biopsies from January 6, 2020 to September 27, 2020, and compared these to the same period for 2019. Those diagnosed with anogenital cancers, younger than 20 years, residing out-of-province and with lapses in coverage were excluded. The sensitivity and specificity of claims diagnoses compared to a validated algorithm to identify keratinocyte carcinoma (KC), or to the cancer registry for melanoma was evaluated. Factors associated with biopsy during the early pandemic were investigated with modified Poisson regression. RESULTS: A precipitous drop in total skin biopsies (15% of expected), biopsies for KC (18%) and melanoma (27%) was seen with the onset of COVID-19 cases (p<0.01). Claims diagnoses were of high specificity for KC (99%), and for melanoma (98%), though sensitivity was less (61%, 28% respectively). In adjusted analysis, the elderly (80+ years), females and residents of certain regions were less likely to be biopsied during the pandemic. Subsequently, there were substantial improvements in biopsy rates over 10 weeks. However, compared to 2019, a large backlog of expected cases still remained 28 weeks after lockdown (45,710 all biopsy, 9,104 KC, 595 melanoma). INTERPRETATION: A drastic reduction in skin biopsies is noted early in the COVID-19 pandemic; this disproportionately affected the elderly, females and certain geographic regions. Though biopsies subsequently increased, a large backlog of cases remained after almost half a year. This will have implications for downstream care of skin cancer. Efforts should be made to limit diagnostic delay.","Asai, Yuka; Nguyen, Paul; Hanna, Timothy P.",PLoS One,107,22

In this study, the production of the novel HIV entry inhibitor candidate, griffithsin (GRFT), was investigated using Nicotiana benthamiana as the expression platform based on a non-viral vector. To increase the yield of recombinant GRFT, the RNA silencing defense mechanism of N. benthamiana was abolished by using three gene silencing suppressors. A transient expression system was used by transferring the GRFT gene, which encodes 122 amino acids, under the control of the enhanced CaMV 35S promoter. The presence of correctly assembled GRFT in transgenic leaves was confirmed using immunoglobulin-specific sandwich ELISA. The data demonstrated that the use of three gene silencing suppressors allowed the highest accumulation of GRFT, with a yield of 400 μg g(−1) fresh weight, and this amount was reduced to 287 μg g(−1) after purification, representing a recovery of 71.75%. The analysis also showed that the ability of GRFT expressed in N. benthamiana to bind to glycoprotein 120 is close to that of the GRFT protein purified from E. coli. Whole-cell assays using purified GRFT showed that our purified GRFT was potently active against HIV.

Policies to restrict international passenger arrivals adopted by many countries are effective responses to control the spread of the virus. This paper studies the impact of two entry restriction policies implemented by some countries against international travelers during COVID-19, i.e., direct flight suspension and complete entry suspension, on the international connectivity (IC) of ATNs. Firstly, the concept of international air transport network (IATN) is defined, and a novel weighted IC index for ATNs is proposed considering flight frequency. Furthermore, to systematically analyze the difference between two policies, the hierarchical structure of the IATN is investigated, followed by studying the change of the IC index assuming different countries impose the two policies. Taking China as an example, this paper evaluates the influence of two policies based on real policy implementation of some countries against travelers from China. Besides, the critical countries affecting the IC are identified, and the network robustness is assessed. Implications for assessing and ranking the impact of different countries under different policies are provided and discussed. Lastly, two extensions are presented to discuss the impact of partial suspension and response actions such as air travel bubble.

Although most patients with COVID-19 develop asymptomatic or mild disease, some patients develop severe disease. The effectiveness of various therapeutic agents, including antiviral drugs, steroids, and anti-inflammatories for COVID-19, have been being confirmed. The effect of administering steroids in early disease is unclear. This study therefore aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and risk of exacerbation of steroids administered preceding antiviral drugs in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: This retrospective, single-center, observational study included consecutive patients with COVID-19 between March 2020 and March 2021. Patients were divided into a steroids-first group and antiviral-drugs-first group. Mortality, duration of hospitalization, incidence rate and duration of intensive care unit (ICU) admission, intubation, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) induction of the two groups were compared. RESULTS: A total of 258 patients were admitted during the study period. After excluding patients who received symptomatic treatment only, who were taking immunosuppressive drugs, or who were administered antiviral drugs only, 68 patients were included in the analysis, 16 in the steroids-first group and 52 in the antiviral-drugs-first group. The rate of intubation, ICU admission and ECMO induction were significantly higher in the steroids-first group than in the antiviral-drugs-first group (81.3% vs. 33.3, p<0.001, 75.0% vs. 29.4%, p = 0.001, and 31.3% vs. 7.8%, p = 0.017, respectively). Furthermore, patients who received steroids within ten days after starting antiviral drugs had significantly lower rates of ICU admission, intubation, and ECMO induction.

The socioeconomic characteristics of the study population were estimated using a zip code–level analysis of US Census data and compared to national US Metrics for 2016. Samples from 4,874 individuals were deposited to a single commercial DNA bank from 1997 to 2019. Samples originated from 31 countries across 6 continents, with the majority of samples originating from the United States (US; 97.37%; n = 4,746). A higher proportion of individuals identifying as females (55.58%; n = 2,709) utilized the service compared to males (41.18%; n = 2,007). The age distribution was bimodal, peaking around 5 years of age and again around 65 years of age. Whole blood was the preferred specimen for submission. Sample deposits peaked in 2015 with 559 annual deposits. Clinical genetic counselors were the most common referral source (41.73%; n = 2,034). Individuals utilizing DNA banking services are estimated to reside in wealthier, more educated and less racially diverse zip codes compared to national metrics.

Guided ICBT aims to increase a patient's knowledge and competence to better cope with their disorder. Despite the growing evidence supporting the effects of guided ICBT, there is remarkably little research on the different factors that are important for patients to achieve effects from using such digital treatment interventions. Thus, the aim of this study was to conduct a user evaluation of a therapist-guided ICBT program using the updated DeLone and McLean (D&M) model for measuring information systems (IS) success or effectiveness. This model includes the following six dimensions: system quality, information quality, service quality, intention to use and use, user satisfaction, and net benefits (impacts or effect). Ten users of a Norwegian therapist-guided ICBT program for treating anxiety disorders named ‘Assisted Self-Help’ (Assistert Selvhjelp) participated in phone-based individual interviews. Data were analysed using directed content analysis. Results showed that the participants were quite satisfied with the program's system quality and information quality. However, participants suggested improvements, including in-program instruction, improved visibility of system status, more flexibility regarding automated measurement surveys, and the inclusion of more videos with patient stories. Further, the results indicated a need for improvement in the service quality of guided ICBT introduction, instruction, follow-up, guidance, and support from therapists. The results showed that user friendliness and high educational content might not be sufficient for a therapist-guided ICBT program to be perceived as effective. It might also be necessary for therapists to provide follow-up, guidance, and support that are more in line with individual patient needs. Thus, the results suggest that guided ICBT requires active participation from all involved in the process, including the therapist.","Johnsen, Hege Mari; Haddeland, Kristine",Internet Interv,107,3

Yet structural data on the viral envelope glycoproteins E1 and E2 are scarce, in spite of their essential role in the viral life cycle. To obtain more information, we developed an efficient production system of recombinant E2 ectodomain (E2e), truncated immediately upstream its trans-membrane (TM) region, using Drosophila melanogaster cells. This system yields a majority of monomeric protein, which can be readily separated chromatographically from contaminating disulfide-linked aggregates. The isolated monomeric E2e reacts with a number of conformation-sensitive monoclonal antibodies, binds the soluble CD81 large external loop and efficiently inhibits infection of Huh7.5 cells by infectious HCV particles (HCVcc) in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that it adopts a native conformation. These properties of E2e led us to experimentally determine the connectivity of its 9 disulfide bonds, which are strictly conserved across HCV genotypes. Furthermore, circular dichroism combined with infrared spectroscopy analyses revealed the secondary structure contents of E2e, indicating in particular about 28% β-sheet, in agreement with the consensus secondary structure predictions. The disulfide connectivity pattern, together with data on the CD81 binding site and reported E2 deletion mutants, enabled the threading of the E2e polypeptide chain onto the structural template of class II fusion proteins of related flavi- and alphaviruses. The resulting model of the tertiary organization of E2 gives key information on the antigenicity determinants of the virus, maps the receptor binding site to the interface of domains I and III, and provides insight into the nature of a putative fusogenic conformational change.","Krey, Thomas; d'Alayer, Jacques; Kikuti, Carlos M.; Saulnier, Aure; Damier-Piolle, Laurence; Petitpas, Isabelle; Johansson, Daniel X.; Tawar, Rajiv G.; Baron, Bruno; Robert, Bruno; England, Patrick; Persson, Mats A.

Cytoskeletal proteins are often involved during viral infections, either for cell entry or the initiation of the immune response. The importance of actin and clathrin dynamics for cell entry and the initiation of the cellular immune response against RSV in human immune cells is not known yet. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of actin and clathrin on cell entry of RSV and the subsequent effect on T cell activation and interferon gamma release in human immune cells. METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells and purified monocytes were isolated from healthy adults and stimulated in vitro with RSV. Actin and clathrin dynamics were inhibited with respectively cytochalasin D and chlorpromazine. T cell receptor signaling was inhibited with cyclosporin A. Flow cytometry was used to determine the role of actin and clathrin on cell entry and T cell activation by RSV. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were used to investigate the contribution of actin and clathrin on the release of interferon gamma. RESULTS: Cell entry, virus gene transcription and interferon gamma release are actin-dependent. Post-endocytic processes like the increased expression of major histocompatibility complex II on monocytes , T cell activation and the release of interferon gamma are clathrin-dependent. Finally, T cell receptor signaling affects T cell activation, whereas soluble interleukin 18 is dispensable. CONCLUSION: Analysis of cell entry and interferon gamma release after infection with RSV reveals the importance of actin- and clathrin-dependent signaling in human immune cells. Insights into the cellular biology of the human immune response against respiratory syncytial virus will provide a better understanding of disease pathogenesis and may prove useful in the development of preventive strategies.","Jans, Jop; elMoussaoui, Hicham; de Groot, Ronald; de Jonge, Marien I.; Ferwerda, Gerben",Virol J,107,31

We evaluated the characteristics and nutritional quality of popular food outlets on a market-leading platform (UberEATS(®)) in a cross-sectional observational study conducted in two international cities: Sydney (Australia) and Auckland (New Zealand). A systematic search using publicly available population-level data was used to identify geographical areas with above-average concentrations (>30%) of young people (15–34-years). A standardized data extraction protocol was used to identify the ten most popular food outlets within each area. The nutritional quality of food outlets was assessed using the Food Environment Score (FES) (range: −10 ‘unhealthiest’ to 10 ‘healthiest’). Additionally, the most popular menu items from each food outlet were classified as discretionary or core foods/beverages according to the Australian Dietary Guidelines. The majority of popular food outlets were classified as ‘unhealthy’ (FES range −10 to −5; 73.5%, 789/1074) and were predominately takeaway franchise stores (59.6%, 470/789, e.g., McDonald’s(®)). 85.9% of all popular menu items were discretionary (n = 4958/5769). This study highlights the pervasion and accessibility of discretionary foods on OFD’s.

In order to conduct this study effectively, we are currently developing an application platform, called Knowledge Building Discourse Explorer (KBDeX). The goal of this project is not only to facilitate productive communication between researchers who are concerned with research on knowledge building or emergent collaborative learning, but also to encourage students to explore their own group dynamics by themselves. KBDeX is an analysis platform to visualize network structures of discourse based on the bipartite graph of words × discourse units. KBDeX can visualize them into three different network structures of: (1) students, (2) discourse units, and (3) selected words. The users can explore these three networks with its coefficients and analyze the discourse across phases or in a and stepwise way.

To achieve efficient and accurate detection of SARS-CoV-2 on site, we developed and verified a rapid and sensitive fluorescence lateral flow immunoassay based on the innovative enhanced strand exchange amplification (ESEA-LFIA) in this study. With good amplification efficiency for short-sequence targets, ESEA is an ideal choice for the point-of-care testing of SARS-CoV-2 with a high mutation rate. ESEA reaction can be completed in one step and verified by restriction enzyme digestion. The design consisting of three working primers greatly improved the amplification efficiency. Amplification of the target sequences of the RdRP and N genes can be accomplished under the same reaction conditions, and does not require expensive instruments. The sensitivity of the ESEA-LFIA assay targeting the RdRP and N genes was 90 copies per µL and 70 copies per µL, respectively. Specificity tests showed that the novel assay can specifically detect SARS-CoV-2, and had no cross-reactivity with 9 closely-related human pathogenic coronaviruses and other common respiratory pathogens with similar clinical manifestations.

The RBD is very immunogenic; it is a major SCV neutralization determinant and can elicit potent neutralizing antibodies capable of out-competing ACE2. However, the structural basis of RBD immunogenicity, RBD-mediated neutralization, and the role of RBD in entry steps following its binding to ACE2 have not been elucidated. By mimicking immune responses with the use of RBD as an antigen to screen a large human antibody library derived from healthy volunteers, we identified a novel potent cross-reactive SCV-neutralizing monoclonal antibody, m396, which competes with ACE2 for binding to RBD, and determined the crystal structure of the RBD-antibody complex at 2.3-Ä resolution. The antibody-bound RBD structure is completely defined, revealing two previously unresolved segments (residues 376–381 and 503–512) and a new disulfide bond (between residues 378 and 511). Interestingly, the overall structure of the m396-bound RBD is not significantly different from that of the ACE2-bound RBD. The antibody epitope is dominated by a 10-residue-long protruding β6–β7 loop with two putative ACE2-binding hotspot residues (Ile-489 and Tyr-491). These results provide a structural rationale for the function of a major determinant of SCV immunogenicity and neutralization, the development of SCV therapeutics based on the antibody paratope and epitope, and a retrovaccinology approach for the design of anti-SCV vaccines. The available structural information indicates that the SCV entry may not be mediated by ACE2-induced conformational changes in the RBD but may involve other conformational changes or/and yet to be identified coreceptors.","Prabakaran, Ponraj; Gan, Jianhua; Feng, Yang; Zhu, Zhongyu; Choudhry, Vidita; Xiao, Xiaodong; Ji, Xinhua; Dimitrov, Dimiter S.",J Biol Chem,107,21

EVIDENCE: Health and vaccine literacy encompass people’s knowledge, motivation, and competence to access, understand, appraise and apply health information in order to make judgements and take decisions in everyday life concerning health care, disease prevention and health promotion. FINDINGS: Appropriate vaccine communication, which depends greatly on personal and contextual determinants, as well as on societal and environmental circumstances, is essential to reassure people about vaccine efficacy, safety, and possible side effects. However, vaccine confidence is not solely a question of trust in the vaccine’s efficacy, safety. and individual protective benefit of vaccination. It also encompasses the mechanism(s) of vaccine activity, immunization schedules, organization and trust in the healthcare system that promotes and delivers the vaccines, and at what costs. When healthcare professionals as science brokers of vaccine knowledge attempt to increase vaccine knowledge and confidence, they must adjust their communication to the educational or health literacy level of their intended audience. Even if their messages are apparently clear and simple, they absolutely need to verify that they are properly understood. RELEVANCE: Specific vaccine communication training appears essential to increase vaccine communication skills among healthcare providers. Moreover, further randomized controlled studies are warranted to improve vaccine empowerment among different populations, from a variety of educational backgrounds.","Michel, Jean-Pierre; Goldberg, J.",J Nutr Health Aging,107,16

Healthcare systems across the world are grappling with the detrimental impact of this pandemic while learning about this novel disease and concurrently developing vaccines, strategies to mitigate its spread, and treat those infected. Cancer patients today face with a unique situation. They are susceptible to severe clinically adverse events and higher mortality from COVID‐19 infection as well as morbidity and mortality from their underlying malignancy. Conclusion: Our review suggests increased risk of mortality and serious clinical events from COVID‐19 infection in cancer patients. However, risk of adverse events does not seem to be increased by cancer therapies. True impact of COVID‐19 on cancer patients will unravel over the next few months. We have also reviewed clinical features of COVID‐19, recent recommendations from various medical, surgical, and radiation oncology societies for major solid tumor types like lung, breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer during the duration of this pandemic.","Madan, Ankit; Siglin, Joshua; Khan, Aleem",Cancer Med,107,33

Phylogenetically, the three viruses are most closely related to Menangle and Tioman virus. Genome analysis showed that their 3'-leader sequences are unique by possessing GA instead of AG at the 5th and 6th positions. Unlike Menangle and Tioman virus, key amino acids for neuraminidase activity characteristic of rubulavirus attachment proteins are present. The genome of ThkPV-1 represents the largest rubulavirus genome. Unique features between the three viruses include perfect complementary 5'-trailer and 3'-leader sequence and a unique cysteine pair in attachment protein of ThkPV-1, G at + 1 position in all predicted mRNA sequences of ThkPV-2, and amino acid substitutions in the conserved N-terminal motif of nucleocapsid of ThkPV-3. Analysis of phosphoprotein gene mRNA products confirmed mRNA editing. Antibodies to the viruses were detected in 48–60% of Leschenault's rousettes.","Lau, Susanna K.P.; Woo, Patrick C.Y.; Wong, Beatrice H.L.; Wong, Annette Y.P.; Tsoi, Hoi-Wah; Wang, Ming; Lee, Paul; Xu, Huifang; Poon, Rosana W.S.; Guo, Rongtong; Li, Kenneth S.M.; Chan, Kwok-Hung; Zheng, Bo-Jian; Yuen, Kwok-Yung",Virology,107,5

AIMS: The study investigated the relation between health anxiety, perceived risk and perceived control as predictors of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related anxiety and preventive behaviours (both adaptive and dysfunctional/excessive) during the early pandemic response in Romania. METHOD: Data were collected in April–May 2020, and the sample comprised 236 participants, 192 women, mean age 31.44 (s.d. = 10.30, age range 16–67). RESULTS: Our results showed that health anxiety and perceived control, but not perceived risk predicted adaptive preventive behaviours, whereas dysfunctional behaviours were predicted by health anxiety alone. COVID-19-related anxiety was predicted by health anxiety and perceived risk, with perceived control emerging as a non-significant predictor. Also, we found that the effect of health anxiety on COVID-19-related anxiety was mediated by perceived risk, and that perceived control acted as a moderator in the relation between health anxiety and dysfunctional (but not adaptive) preventive behaviours. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest health anxiety is a significant predictor of COVID-19-related anxiety and preventive behaviours. Also, adaptive, but not dysfunctional, preventive behaviours were additionally predicted by perceived control, pointing to the important role of control and self-efficacy in explaining adherence to recommendations.","Ștefan, Simona; Fodor, Liviu Andrei; Curt, Ioana; Ionescu, Andreea; Pantea, Nadina; Jiboc, Nicoleta; Tegzesiu, Ana Maria",BJPsych Open,107,16
