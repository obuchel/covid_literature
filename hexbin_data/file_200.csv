502,502,502,"Ketamine inhibits tumor necrosis factor secretion by RAW264.7 murine macrophages stimulated with antibiotic-exposed strains of community-associated, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus",13.394226,9.406643,2011-01-25,"BACKGROUND: Infections caused by community-associated strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) are associated with a marked and prolonged host inflammatory response. In a sepsis simulation model, we tested whether the anesthetic ketamine inhibits the macrophage TNF response to antibiotic-exposed CA-MRSA bacteria via its antagonism of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. RAW264.7 cells were stimulated for 18 hrs with 10(5 )to 10(7 )CFU/mL inocula of either of two prototypical CA-MRSA isolates, USA300 strain LAC and USA400 strain MW2, in the presence of either vancomycin or daptomycin. One hour before bacterial stimulation, ketamine was added with or without MK-801 (dizocilpine, a chemically unrelated non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist), APV (D-2-amino-5-phosphono-valerate, a competitive NMDA receptor antagonist), NMDA, or combinations of these agents. Supernatants were collected and assayed for TNF concentration by ELISA. RESULTS: RAW264.7 cells exposed to either LAC or MW2 in the presence of daptomycin secreted less TNF than in the presence of vancomycin. The addition of ketamine inhibited macrophage TNF secretion after stimulation with either of the CA-MRSA isolates (LAC, MW2) in the presence of either antibiotic. The NMDA inhibitors, MK-801 and APV, also suppressed macrophage TNF secretion after stimulation with either of the antibiotic-exposed CA-MRSA isolates, and the effect was not additive or synergistic with ketamine. The addition of NMDA substrate augmented TNF secretion in response to the CA-MRSA bacteria, and the addition of APV suppressed the effect of NMDA in a dose-dependent fashion. CONCLUSIONS: Ketamine inhibits TNF secretion by MRSA-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages and the mechanism likely involves NMDA receptor antagonism. These findings may have therapeutic significance in MRSA sepsis.","Spentzas, Thomas; Shapley, Rebekah KH; Aguirre, Carlos Acuna; Meals, Elizabeth; Lazar, Lauren; Rayburn, Mark S; Walker, Brett S; English, B Keith",BMC Immunol,200,17
584,584,584,Human Bocavirus in Patients with Respiratory Tract Infection,13.249799,9.451589,2011-06-28,"BACKGROUND: Human bocavirus (HBoV) is a newly identified viral pathogen, and its clinical epidemiology and significance in respiratory infections have not yet been completely elucidated. We investigated the prevalence of HBoV infection and the association between viral (HBoV) load and clinical features of the infection in patients of all age-groups. METHODS: Nasopharyngeal aspirates from patients with symptoms of respiratory infection were tested for presence of HBoV by using real-time polymerase chain reaction. HBoV-positive patients were categorized into low- and high-viral-load groups using 1.0×10(6) copies/mL as the threshold value of viral load. RESULTS: Detection rate of HBoV was 4.8% (N=93) in a total of 1,926 samples with peak incidence of infection being observed in patients aged 6-12 months. HBoV infection was more frequently observed in young children, especially, in children aged less than 5 yr, and the HBoV load decreased with increase in age. HBoV was codetected with other respiratory viruses in 17 (18.3%) of the 93 HBoV-positive patients and 15 patients (88.2%) belonged to the low-viral-load group. Patients infected with HBoV alone showed a higher viral load than those patients in whom HBoV was codetected with other respiratory viruses (median load, 3.78×10(5) copies/mL vs. 1.94×10(4) copies/mL, P=0.014). Higher pulse rate (P=0.007) and respiratory rate (P=0.021) were observed in patients with a high-viral-load. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that HBoV may be the causative agent of respiratory infection in the high-viral-load group.","Kim, Jang Su; Lim, Chae Seung; Kim, Young Kee; Lee, Kap No; Lee, Chang Kyu",Korean J Lab Med,200,11
742,742,742,Molecular Mimicry as a Mechanism of Autoimmune Disease,13.365583,9.53013,2011-11-19,"A variety of mechanisms have been suggested as the means by which infections can initiate and/or exacerbate autoimmune diseases. One mechanism is molecular mimicry, where a foreign antigen shares sequence or structural similarities with self-antigens. Molecular mimicry has typically been characterized on an antibody or T cell level. However, structural relatedness between pathogen and self does not account for T cell activation in a number of autoimmune diseases. A proposed mechanism that could have been misinterpreted for molecular mimicry is the expression of dual T cell receptors (TCR) on a single T cell. These T cells have dual reactivity to both foreign and self-antigens leaving the host vulnerable to foreign insults capable of triggering an autoimmune response. In this review, we briefly discuss what is known about molecular mimicry followed by a discussion of the current understanding of dual TCRs. Finally, we discuss three mechanisms, including molecular mimicry, dual TCRs, and chimeric TCRs, by which dual reactivity of the T cell may play a role in autoimmune diseases.","Cusick, Matthew F.; Libbey, Jane E.; Fujinami, Robert S.",Clin Rev Allergy Immunol,200,17

The aim of the present study was to identify the association between FCGR polymorphisms and cryptococcal meningitis. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this case control genetic association study, we genotyped four functional polymorphisms in low-affinity FcγRs, including FCGR2A 131H/R, FCGR3A 158F/V, FCGR3B NA1/NA2, and FCGR2B 232I/T, in 117 patients with cryptococcal meningitis and 190 healthy controls by multiplex SNaPshot technology. Among the 117 patients with cryptococcal meningitis, 59 had predisposing factors. In patients with cryptococcal meningitis, the FCGR2B 232I/I genotype was over-presented (OR = 1.652, 95% CI [1.02–2.67]; P = 0.039) and the FCGR2B 232I/T genotype was under-presented (OR = 0.542, 95% CI [0.33–0.90]; P = 0.016) in comparison with control group. In cryptococcal meningitis patients without predisposing factors, FCGR2B 232I/I genotype was also more frequently detected (OR = 1.958, 95% CI [1.05–3.66]; P = 0.033), and the FCGR2B 232I/T genotype was also less frequently detected (OR = 0.467, 95% CI [0.24–0.91]; P = 0.023) than in controls. No significant difference was found among FCGR2A 131H/R, FCGR3A 158F/V, and FCGR3B NA1/NA2 genotype frequencies between patients and controls.

1446,1446,1446,Parainfluenza Virus Lower Respiratory Tract Disease After Hematopoietic Cell Transplant: Viral Detection in the Lung Predicts Outcome,13.093601,9.335155,2014-03-05,"Background. Parainfluenza virus (PIV) commonly infects patients following hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), frequently causing lower respiratory tract disease (LRTD). The definition of LRTD significantly differs among studies evaluating the impact of PIV after HCT. Methods. We retrospectively evaluated 544 HCT recipients with laboratory-confirmed PIV and classified LRTD into 3 groups: possible (PIV detection in upper respiratory tract with new pulmonary infiltrates with/without LRTD symptoms), probable (PIV detection in lung with LRTD symptoms without new pulmonary infiltrates), and proven (PIV detection in lung with new pulmonary infiltrates with/without LRTD symptoms). Results. Probabilities of 90-day survival after LRTD were 87%, 58%, and 45% in possible, probable, and proven cases, respectively. Patients with probable and proven LRTD had significantly worse survival than those with upper respiratory tract infection (probable: hazard ratio [HR], 5.87 [P < .001]; proven: HR, 9.23 [P < .001]), whereas possible LRTD did not (HR, 1.49 [P = .27]). Among proven/probable cases, oxygen requirement at diagnosis, low monocyte counts, and high-dose steroid use (>2 mg/kg/day) were associated with high mortality in multivariable analysis. Conclusions. PIV LRTD with viral detection in lungs (proven/probable LRTD) was associated with worse outcomes than was PIV LRTD with viral detection in upper respiratory samples alone (possible LRTD). This new classification should impact clinical trial design and permit comparability of results among centers.","Seo, Sachiko; Xie, Hu; Campbell, Angela P.; Kuypers, Jane M.; Leisenring, Wendy M.; Englund, Janet A.; Boeckh, Michael",Clinical Infectious Diseases,200,28
1629,1629,1629,Bone Marrow Dendritic Cells from Mice with an Altered Microbiota Provide Interleukin 17A-Dependent Protection against Entamoeba histolytica Colitis,13.215936,9.79091,2014-11-04,"There is an emerging paradigm that the human microbiome is central to many aspects of health and may have a role in preventing enteric infection. Entamoeba histolytica is a major cause of amebic diarrhea in developing countries. It colonizes the colon lumen in close proximity to the gut microbiota. Interestingly, not all individuals are equally susceptible to E. histolytica infection. Therefore, as the microbiota is highly variable within individuals, we sought to determine if a component of the microbiota could regulate susceptibility to infection. In studies utilizing a murine model, we demonstrated that colonization of the gut with the commensal Clostridia-related bacteria known as segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB) is protective during E. histolytica infection. SFB colonization in this model was associated with elevated cecal levels of interleukin 17A (IL-17A), dendritic cells, and neutrophils. Bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) from SFB-colonized mice had higher levels of IL-23 production in response to stimulation with trophozoites. Adoptive transfer of BMDCs from an SFB(+) to an SFB(−) mouse was sufficient to provide protection against E. histolytica. IL-17A induction during BMDC transfer was necessary for this protection. This work demonstrates that intestinal colonization with a specific commensal bacterium can provide protection during amebiasis in a murine model. Most importantly, this work demonstrates that the microbiome can mediate protection against an enteric infection via extraintestinal effects on bone marrow-derived dendritic cells.","Burgess, Stacey L.; Buonomo, Erica; Carey, Maureen; Cowardin, Carrie; Naylor, Caitlin; Noor, Zannatun; Wills-Karp, Marsha; Petri, William A.",mBio,200,1
1739,1739,1739,Prevalence and Correlation of Infectious Agents in Hospitalized Children with Acute Respiratory Tract Infections in Central China,13.252434,9.788207,2015-03-09,"Acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) are associated with significant morbidity and mortality worldwide, especially in children under the age of 5 years. Almost 2 million children die from ARTIs each year, and most of them are from developing countries. The prevalence and correlation of pathogens in ARTIs are poorly understood, but are critical for improving case prevention, treatment, and management. In this study, we investigated the prevalence and correlation of infectious agents in children with ARTIs. A total of 39,756 children with one or more symptoms, including fever, cough, sore throat, tonsillitis, pharyngitis, herpangina, pneumonia, and bronchiolitis, were enrolled in the study. All patients were hospitalized in Wuhan Children’s Hospital between October 1, 2010 and September 30, 2012, and were evaluated for infectious agents. Pathogens, including Mycoplasma pneumoniae, influenza A virus, influenza B virus, adenoviruses, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, Legionella pneumophila, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Coxiella burnetii, were screened simultaneously in patient blood samples using anti-pathogen IgM tests. Regression analysis was used to reveal correlations among the pathogens. Our results showed that one or more pathogens were identified in 10,206 patients, and that Mycoplasma pneumoniae, adenoviruses, and influenza B virus were the leading infectious agents. Mixed-infections of pathogens were detected in 2,391 cases, with Mycoplasma pneumoniae as the most frequent pathogen. The most common agents in the co-infections were Mycoplasma pneumoniae and influenza B virus. Regression analysis revealed a linear correlation between the proportion of mixed infections and the incidence of multi-pathogen infections. The prevalence of infectious agents in children with ARTIs was determined. Equations were established to estimate multiple infections by single-pathogen detection. This revealed a linear correlation for pathogens in children with ARTIs. This study provides useful information for improving case prevention and management.","Liu, Jia; Ai, Hongwu; Xiong, Ying; Li, Fu; Wen, Zhou; Liu, Weiyong; Li, Tongya; Qin, Kai; Wu, Jianguo; Liu, Yingle",PLoS One,200,1

We analyzed underlying drivers of 116 IDTEs detected in Europe during 2008–2013 by epidemic intelligence at the European Centre of Disease Prevention and Control. Seventeen drivers were identified and categorized into 3 groups: globalization and environment, sociodemographic, and public health systems. A combination of >2 drivers was responsible for most IDTEs. The driver category globalization and environment contributed to 61% of individual IDTEs, and the top 5 individual drivers of all IDTEs were travel and tourism, food and water quality, natural environment, global trade, and climate. Hierarchical cluster analysis of all drivers identified travel and tourism as a distinctly separate driver. Monitoring and modeling such disease drivers can help anticipate future IDTEs and strengthen control measures. More important, intervening directly on these underlying drivers can diminish the likelihood of the occurrence of an IDTE and reduce the associated human and economic costs.","Semenza, Jan C.; Lindgren, Elisabet; Balkanyi, Laszlo; Espinosa, Laura; Almqvist, My S.; Penttinen, Pasi; Rocklöv, Joacim",Emerg Infect Dis,200,3

With the discovery of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a protective axis of RAS namely ACE2/Ang-(1–7)/Mas that counteracts the deleterious ACE/AngII/AT1R axis has been established. This axis is emerging as a novel target to attenuate ocular inflammation. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. We investigated the hypothesis that enhancing the activity of the protective axis of RAS by subretinal delivery of an AAV8 (Y733F)-ACE2 vector would protect against the ocular inflammation in experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) mice through regulating the local immune responses. Our studies demonstrated that increased ACE2 expression exerts protective effects on inflammation in EAU mouse by modulating ocular immune responses, including the differentiation of Th1/Th17 cells and the polarization of M1/M2 macrophages; whereas the systemic immune responses appeared not affected. These effects were mediated by activating the Ang-(1–7)/Mas and inhibiting the MAPK, NF-κB and STAT3 signaling pathways. This proof-of-concept study suggests that activation of ocular ACE2/Ang-(1–7)/Mas axis with AAV gene transfer modulates local immune responses and may be a promising, long-lasting therapeutic strategy for refractory and recurrent uveitis, as well as other inflammatory eye diseases.","Qiu, Yiguo; Tao, Lifei; Zheng, Shijie; Lin, Ru; Fu, Xinyu; Chen, Zihe; Lei, Chunyan; Wang, Jiaming; Li, Hongwei; Li, Qiuhong; Lei, Bo",Sci Rep,200,1

This cross-sectional study evaluated the air and objects in patient-occupied rooms in pediatric wards for the presence of common respiratory viruses and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Air samplers were placed at a short (60–80 cm) and long (320 cm) distance from the head of the beds of 58 pediatric patients, who were subsequently confirmed to be infected with enterovirus (n = 17), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (n = 13), influenza A virus (n = 13), adenovirus (n = 9), or M pneumoniae (n = 6). Swab samples were collected from the surfaces of 5 different types of objects in the patients’ rooms. All air and swab samples were analyzed via real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay for the presence of the above pathogens. All pathogens except enterovirus were detected in the air, on the objects, or in both locations in the patients’ rooms. The detection rates of influenza A virus, adenovirus, and M pneumoniae for the long distance air sampling were 15%, 67%, and 17%, respectively. Both adenovirus and M pneumoniae were detected at very high rates, with high concentrations, on all sampled objects. The respiratory pathogens RSV, influenza A virus, adenovirus, and M pneumoniae were detected in the air and/or on the objects in the pediatric ward rooms.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 1038 patients who received SCT between January 2007 and August 2011 at a single center in Korea. RESULTS: Seventy-one CRV-LRDs were identified in 67 (6.5%) patients. The human parainfluenza virus (HPIV) was the most common causative pathogen of CRV-LRDs at 100 days [cumulative incidence estimate, 23.5%; 95% confidence interval (CI), 3.3–43.7] and 1 year (cumulative incidence estimate, 69.2%; 95% CI, 45.9–92.5) following SCT. The 30-day overall mortality rates due to influenza-LRDs, respiratory syncytial virus-LRDs, HPIV-LRDs, and human rhinovirus-LRDs were 35.7, 25.8, 31.6, and 42.8%, respectively. Co-pathogens in respiratory specimens were detected in 23 (33.8%) patients. The overall mortality at day 30 after CRV-LRD diagnosis was 32.8% (22/67). High-dose steroid usage (p=0.025), a severe state of immunodeficiency (p=0.033), and lymphopenia (p=0.006) were significantly associated with death within 30 days following CRV-LRD diagnosis in a univariate analysis. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that high-dose steroid usage [odds ratio (OR), 4.05; 95% CI, 1.12–14.61; p=0.033] and lymphopenia (OR, 6.57; 95% CI, 1.80–24.03; p=0.004) were independent risk factors for mortality within 30 days of CRV-LRDs.

Mental health issues that coincide with emerging diseases and epidemics are rarely examined and sometimes, even eschewed due to cultural considerations. Psychiatric manifestations of various infectious diseases, especially with a focus on Ebola Virus disease (EVD) and Zika Virus, are discussed in this commentary to illustrate the continued need of care after the resolution of the actual illness. Various infectious diseases have associations with mental illness, such as an increased risk of obsessive-compulsive disorders and Tourette syndrome in children with Group B streptococcal infection.

3225,3225,3225,Experimental murine acute lung injury induces increase of pulmonary TIE2-expressing macrophages,13.451804,9.46393,2018-06-14,"BACKGROUND: Breakdown of the alveolo-capillary wall is pathognomonic for Acute Lung Injury (ALI). Angiopoietins, vascular-specific growth factors, are linked to endothelial barrier dysfunction, and elevated Angiopoietin-2 (ANG2) levels are associated with poor outcome of ALI patients. Specialized immune cells, referred to as ‘TIE2-expressing monocytes and macrophages’ (TEM), were shown to specifically respond to ANG2 binding. However, their involvement in acute inflammatory processes is so far completely undescribed. Thus, our aim was to assess the dynamics of TEMs in a murine model of ALI. RESULTS: Intratracheal instillation of LPS induced a robust pulmonary pro-inflammatory response with endothelial barrier dysfunction and significantly enhanced ANG2 expression. The percentage number of TEMs, assessed by FACS analysis, was more than trebled compared to controls, with TEM count in lungs reaching more than 40% of all macrophages. Such distinct dynamic was absent in all other analyzed compartments (alveolar space, spleen, blood). Incubation of the monocytic cell line THP-1 with LPS or TNF-α resulted in a dose-dependent, significant upregulation of TIE2, suggesting that not recruitment from extra-pulmonary compartments but TIE2 upregulation in resident macrophages accounts for increased lung TEM frequencies. CONCLUSIONS: For the first time, our data provide evidence that the activity of TEMs changes at sites of acute inflammation.

In hospitals, control efforts would benefit from accurate estimation of asymptomatic colonization and infection importation rates from the community. However, developing such estimates remains challenging due to limited observation of colonization and complicated transmission dynamics within hospitals and the community. Here, we develop an inference framework that can estimate these key quantities by combining statistical filtering techniques, an agent-based model, and real-world patient-to-patient contact networks, and use this framework to infer nosocomial transmission and infection importation over an outbreak spanning 6 years in 66 Swedish hospitals. In particular, we identify a small number of patients with disproportionately high risk of colonization.

Despite an intensive vaccination program, influenza infections remain a recurrent, yet unsolved public health problem. Secondary bacterial infections frequently complicate influenza infections during seasonal outbreaks and pandemics, resulting in increased morbidity and mortality. Staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), is frequently associated with these co-infections, including the 2009 influenza pandemic. Damage to alveolar epithelium is a major contributor to severe influenza-bacterial co-infections and can result in gas exchange abnormalities, fluid leakage, and respiratory insufficiency. These deleterious manifestations likely involve both pathogen- and host-mediated mechanisms. However, there is a paucity of information regarding the mechanisms (pathogen- and/or host-mediated) underlying influenza-bacterial co-infection pathogenesis. To address this, we characterized the contributions of viral-, bacterial-, and host-mediated factors to the altered structure and function of alveolar epithelial cells during co-infection with a focus on the 2009 pandemic influenza (pdm2009) and MRSA. Here, we characterized pdm2009 and MRSA replication kinetics, temporal host kinome responses, modulation of MRSA virulence factors, and disruption of alveolar barrier integrity in response to pdm2009-MRSA co-infection. Our results suggest that alveolar barrier disruption during co-infection is mediated primarily through host response dysregulation, resulting in loss of alveolar barrier integrity.","Nickol, Michaela E.; Ciric, Justine; Falcinelli, Shane D.; Chertow, Daniel S.; Kindrachuk, Jason",Viruses,200,22

Multiple studies have been performed to evaluate the complications associated with respiratory syncytial virus infections. Other studies have evaluated therapeutic agents and strategies in which these agents can be used. There have also been numerous reports of outbreaks in bone marrow transplant units and oncology wards, where infection control measures have been invaluable in controlling the spread of disease. However, despite these novel approaches, respiratory syncytial virus continues to be potentially fatal in immunocompromised populations. In this review, we discuss the incidence of respiratory syncytial viral infections, risk factors associated with progression from upper respiratory tract infection to lower respiratory tract infection, other complications and outcomes (including mortality), management strategies, and prevention strategies in patients with a hematologic malignancy and in hematopoietic cell transplant recipients.","Khawaja, Fareed; Chemaly, Roy F.",Haematologica,200,28

Common to these peptides is a stable cross-β dominated secondary structure which allows self-assembly, leading to insoluble oligomers and lastly to fibrils. These highly ordered protein aggregates have been, for a long time, mainly associated with human neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (Amyloid-β peptides). However, they also exert physiological functions such as in release of deposited hormones in human beings. In the light of the rediscovery of our microbial commensals as important companions in health and disease, the fact that microbes also possess amyloidogenic peptides is intriguing. Transmission of amyloids by iatrogenic means or by consumption of contaminated meat from diseased animals is a well-known fact. What if also our microbial commensals might drive human amyloidosis or suffer from our aggregated amyloids? Moreover, as the microbial amyloids are evolutionarily older, we might learn from these organisms how to cope with the sword of Damocles forged of endogenous, potentially toxic peptides. This review summarizes knowledge about the interplay between human amyloids involved in neurodegenerative diseases and microbial amyloids.","Endres, Kristina",Molecules,200,3

Replacement of the predicted catalytic amino acids, Cys-783 by Ser, or of His-869 by Glu, abolished cleavage of the 206K RP into a ∼150K NRP and a ∼78K C-terminal product in reticulocyte lysates, while other substitutions exerted no apparent influence on proteolysis. The proteinase-deficient mutant RPs could not be cleaved in trans by as much as an eight-fold molar excess of wild-type proteinase. Deletion experiments have excluded the possible influence on autoproteolysis of amino acid sequences 1–708 and 982–1204 flanking the proteinase domain. Thus, the proteinase of TYMV with a papain-like dyad of essential amino acids has been mapped just upstream from the putative NTPase domain. Statistically significant sequence similarities with the TYMV proteinase were found for the similarly located domains of the replicase polyproteins of carlaviruses, capilloviruses, apple stem pitting virus and apple chlorotic leaf spot virus as well as for those of other tymoviruses and for the domain located downstream from the putative NTPase domain of the large polyprotein of beet necrotic yellow vein furovirus. All these domains are not significantly similar to other known proteinases, although they conserve papain-like Cys- and His-containing motifs. Thus these domains constitute a compact group of related enzymes, the tymo-like proteinases, within the proposedpapainlike proteinase supergroup. The resulting alignment of 10 tymo-like proteinase sequences has revealed a third highly conserved residue — Gly (Gly821 in TYMV RP) followed by a hydrophobic residue. We speculate that all the tymo-like proteinase domains of the viral replicative proteins may share common biochemical and biological features.","Rozanov, M.

On the other hand, none of the two RCT (randomized controlled trial) studies resulted in reduced letality of the artificial lung therapy when compared to convention treatment. Both authors concluded, that ECMO is not recommended in ARDS. Meanwhile experience with ECMO in adults is extensive in various institutions worldwide, exceeding 1000 patients by the end of 2001. Growing experience and improved technical equipment reduce the rate of technical complications substantially. However, for different reasons ECMO incidence in adults is progressively decreasing in recent years. Inclusion and exclusion criteria vary among different ECMO centers. Potential reversibility of lung injury and persisting life-threatening gas exchange disorder under maximal conventional therapy are commonly seen as requirements for ECMO therapy. ECMO criteria are Murray lung injury score >3.5 (chest x-ray, PaO(2)/FiO(2)-index, static compliance C(stat), PEEP), Morel-classification >3 (chest x-ray, AaDO(2)/FiO(2)-index, C(stat), PEEP), AaDO2 >600mmHg, intrapulmonal shunt Q(S)/Q(T) >30%, and increase in extravascular lung water >15 ml/kg bodyweight. Commonly accepted absolute contraindications are (1) severely consuming disorders with poor prognosis, (2) CNS damage with poor prognosis, (3) advanced chronic lung disorders, and (4) progressive multiple organ failure. Relative contraindications are immunosuppresion, active bleeding, age over 60 years, and days on mechanical ventilation. In our experience, early contact to an ECMO reference center can optimise early identification of patients which benefit from ECMO, as well as treatment and transportation modalities, and improves outcome. Due to high technical and personal requirements and decreasing incidence in the adult sector, ECMO should be limited to a small number of reference centers with substantial experience in extracorporeal circulation.","Meinhardt, J.

This study was undertaken to look at the spectrum of clinical presentations, therapeutic interventions, and their outcomes and also to evaluate the association of various risk factors with mortality. This was a retrospective study in which the patients admitted with the diagnosis of primary pyomyositis from January 2000 to June 2007 were included. Their demographic details, clinical and laboratory data, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score at presentation, treatment instituted, complications encountered, and hospital outcome were recorded. Sixty-seven patients (42 males and 25 females) with a diagnosis of primary pyomyositis were included. Median age at the time of presentation was 37 years (interquartile range = 25–50 years). Common presenting symptoms were myalgias [50 (74.62%)] and fever [49 (73.13%)]. Twenty-six patients had underlying predisposing medical conditions.

On univariate analysis, there was a statistically significant association between higher SOFA score, lower Glasgow coma scale, higher pulse rate, lower blood pressure, raised blood urea, raised serum creatinine, higher serum glutamic pyruvate transaminase, raised total bilirubin at presentation, and development of sepsis during hospital stay with mortality. In our study, the patients were seen almost a decade later than those seen in other studies from the region.

These effects include enhanced proliferation of their progenitor cells, increased endocytosis and metabolism of mature cells, increased function as antigen-presenting cells, and increased inhibition or killing of intracellular fungi, bacteria, protozoa and viruses. The major effect of GM-CSF on monocytes and macrophages is to enhance phagocytic and metabolic functions, including increased synthesis of molecules toxic to microbes, and to release other pro inflammatory cytokines. This results in inhibition and/or killing ofCandida albicans, Aspergillus, Cryptococcus, Pneumocystis, Leishmania, Mycohacteria, as well as other intracellular pathogens. GM-CSF also enhances the intracellular effectiveness of antiviral and antibacterial drugs. Viral replication may be increased in activated cells, therefore, when GM-CSF is used, a combination with appropriate antiviral drugs is recommended. Several reports in patients of successful management of microbial diseases which depend on macrophage function are now reviewed. These reports support the clinical value of GM-CSF in the management of patients with cancer and chemotherapy related monocyte/macrophage dysfunction and presumed or documented microbial disease.","Jones, Thomas C.",Med Oncol,200,1

We examined circulating ACE2 activity in CKD patients at stages 3–5 (CKD3-5) and in dialysis (CKD5D) without any history of CV disease. METHODS: Circulating ACE2 activity was measured in human ethylenediamine-tetraacetic acid (EDTA)-plasma samples from the NEFRONA study (n = 2572): control group (CONT) (n = 568), CKD3-5 (n = 1458) and CKD5D (n = 546). Different clinical and analytical variables such as gender; age; history of diabetes mellitus (DM), dyslipidemia and hypertension; glycaemic, renal, lipid and anaemia profiles; vitamin D analogues treatment and antihypertensive treatments (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blockade) were analysed. Circulating ACE2 and ACE activities were measured using modified fluorimetric assay for EDTA-plasma samples, where zinc chloride was added to recover enzymatic activity. RESULTS: In CKD3-5 and CKD5D, significant decrease in circulating ACE2 activity was observed when compared with CONT, but no differences were found between CKD3-5 and CKD5 when performing paired case-control studies. By multivariate linear regression analysis, male gender and advanced age were identified as independent predictors of ACE2 activity in all groups. Diabetes was identified as independent predictor of ACE2 activity in CKD3-5. Significant increase in the activity of circulating ACE was found in CKD3-5 and CKD5D when compared with CONT and in CKD5D when compared with CKD3-5. By multiple regression analysis, female gender and younger age were identified as independent predictors of ACE activity in CONT and CKD3-5. Diabetes was also identified as an independent predictor of ACE activity in CKD3-5 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Circulating ACE2 and ACE activities can be measured in human EDTA-plasma samples with zinc added to recover enzymatic activity. In a CKD population without previous history of CV disease, ACE2 activity from human EDTA-plasma samples directly correlated with the classical CV risk factors namely older age, diabetes and male gender. Our data suggest that circulating ACE2 is altered in CKD patients at risk for CV event.","Anguiano, Lidia; Riera, Marta; Pascual, Julio; Valdivielso, José Manuel; Barrios, Clara; Betriu, Angels; Mojal, Sergi; Fernández, Elvira; Soler, María José; Castro, Eva; María, Virtudes; Molí, Teresa; Soria, Meritxell; Regidor, Aladrén; José, Mª; Jaume, Almirall; Esther, Ponz; Coloma, Arteaga; Rubio, Bajo; Rodríguez, Belart; Sara, Bielsa-García; Jordi, Bover Sanjuan; Josep, Bronsoms Artero; Romero, Cabezuelo; Juan, B; Salomé, Muray Cases; Jesús, Calviño Varela; Pilar, Caro Acevedo; Jordi, Carreras Bassa; Aleix, Cases Amenós; Elisabet, Massó Jiménez; Jesús, Castilla Pérez; Secundino, Cigarrán Guldris; Saray, López Prieto; Lourdes, Comas Mongay; Isabel, Comerma; Mª Teresa, Compte Jové; Marta, Cuberes Izquierdo; Fernando, de Álvaro; Covadonga, Hevia Ojanguren; Gabriel, de Arriba de la Fuente; Mª Dolores, del Pino y Pino; Rafael, Diaz-Tejeiro Izquierdo; Marta, Dotori; Verónica, Duarte; Sara, Estupiñan Torres; Mª José, Fernández Reyes; Mª Loreto, Fernández Rodríguez; Guillermina, Fernández; Antonio, Galán Serrano; Cesar, García Cantón; Herrera, García; Antonio, L; Mercedes, García Mena; Luis, Gil Sacaluga; Maria, Aguilar; Luis, Górriz José; Emma, Huarte Loza; Luis, Lerma José; Antonio, Liebana Cañada; Álvarez, Marín; Pedro, Jesús; Nàdia, Martín Alemany; Jesús, Martín García; Alberto, Martínez Castelao; María, Martínez Villaescusa; Isabel, Martínez; Iñigo, Moina Eguren; Silvia, Moreno Los Huertos; Ricardo, Mouzo Mirco; Antonia, Munar Vila; Ana Beatriz, Muñoz Díaz; González, Navarro; Juan, F; Javier, Nieto; Agustín, Carreño; Enrique, Novoa Fernández; Alberto, Ortiz; Beatriz, Fernandez; Vicente, Paraíso; Miguel, Pérez Fontán; Ana, Peris Domingo; Celestino, Piñera Haces; Mª Dolores, Prados Garrido; Mario, Prieto Velasco; Carmina, Puig Marí; Maite, Rivera Gorrín; Esther, Rubio; Pilar, Ruiz; Mercedes, Salgueira Lazo; Puerto, Martínez; Isabel, Ana; Tomero, Sánchez; Antonio, José; Emilio, Sánchez José; Ramon, Sans Lorman; Ramon, Saracho; Maria, Sarrias; Oreto, Prat; Fernando, Sousa; Daniel, Toran; Fernando, Tornero Molina; Carrasco, Usón; Javier, José; Ildefonso, Valera Cortes; Mª Merce, Vilaprinyo del Perugia; Ruiz, Virto; Rafael, C.",Nephrol Dial Transplant,200,3

We evaluated the RSV fusion inhibitor presatovir in a randomized, double-blind, Phase II trial in HCT recipients with RSV upper respiratory tract infections. METHODS: Patients were stratified by lymphopenia (<200/µL) and ribavirin use; were randomized, stratified by lymphopenia (<200/μL) and ribavirin use, to receive oral presatovir at 200 mg or a placebo on Days 1, 5, 9, 13, and 17, and were followed through Day 28. The coprimary efficacy endpoints were the time-weighted average change in the nasal RSV viral load between Days 1 and 9 and the proportion of patients developing lower respiratory tract complications (LRTCs) through Day 28. RESULTS: From 23 January 2015 to 16 June 2017, 189 patients were randomly assigned to treatment (96 to presatovir and 93 to the placebo). Presatovir treatment, compared with the placebo treatment, did not significantly affect (prespecified α = 0.01) a time-weighted average decline in the RSV viral load from Day 1 to 9 (treatment difference, −0.33 log(10) copies/mL; 95% confidence interval [CI] −.64 to −.02 log(10) copies/mL; P = .040) or the progression to LRTC (11.2% vs 19.5%, respectively; odds ratio, 0.50; 95% CI, .22–1.18; P = .11). In a post hoc analysis among patients with lymphopenia, presatovir decreased LRTC development by Day 28 (2/15 [13.3%] vs 9/14 [64.3%], respectively; P = .008), compared with the placebo. Adverse events were similar for patients receiving presatovir and the placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Presatovir had a favorable safety profile in adult HCT recipients with RSV but did not achieve the coprimary endpoints. Exploratory analyses suggest an antiviral effect among patients with lymphopenia.

To elucidate the determinants that enable the P450s to be located in the ER, we constructed cDNAs encoding chimeric proteins in which a secretory form of carboxyesterase, carboxyesterase Sec, was connected to the N-terminus of the full-length or truncated forms of a microsomal-type P450, P45O(M1), and the constructed plasmids were expressed in COS cells. Since carboxyesterase Sec is an iV-glycosylated secretory protein, endo H treatment could be used to determine whether these chimeric proteins were located in the ER or not. Carboxyesterase Sec with the N-terminal 20 amino acids, containing the transmembrane region, of P46O(M1), was located in the ER, as determined from the endo H sensitivity of the expressed protein and immunofluorescence staining of the cells. As the expressed protein exhibited carboxyesterase activity, it was not retained in the ER through the BiP-dependent quality control system recognizing unfolded proteins. Another chimeric protein construct in which carboxyesterase Sec was connected to the C-terminal region of rat UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UDP-GT), that contained a double-lysin ER retention motif, was also located in the ER, as determined from the endo H sensitivity and immunofluorescence staining. On the other hand, the sugar moiety of the carboxyesterase Sec connected to the transmembrane segment of UDP-GT, Sec/GTd, was partially resistant to the endo H treatment. From the results of immunofluorescent staining and cell fractiona-tion, it was concluded that the Sec/GTd product was located in the Golgi apparatus. These observations indicated that the N-terminal hydrophobic segment of P45O(M1) is sufficient for the ER membrane retention, whereas the transmembrane segment of UDP-GT is not. To determine whether microsomal P450s are recycled between the ER and Golgi compartments or not, a DNA construct encoding cathepsin D connected to the N-terminus of P45O(M1) was prepared and expressed in COS cells. The fusion protein was phosphorylated, but the phosphorylation was sensitive to alkaline phosphatase. As a control, authentic cathepsin D was subjected to phosphorylation of its oligosaccharide chain that was resistant to the alkaline phosphatase treatment. Since GlcNAc-P-transferase, which forms the alkaline phosphatase-resistant phosphodiester in the sugar chains of lysosome-targeting proteins, is located in the Golgi apparatus, it was concluded that the oligosaccharide chain of the cathepsin D portion of the fusion protein was not phosphorylated, and that the chimeric protein did not go to the Golgi apparatus. These results indicate that P45O(M1) is not recycled from the Golgi compartments to the ER in cells.","Murakami, Kazuya; Mihara, Katsuyosi; Omura, Tsuneo",J Biochem,200,11

Normal adult A/J mice are resistant, and BALB/c mice are susceptible. Higher titers of virus and interferon (IFN) in vivo were found in MHV3-infected BALB/c mice compared with A/J mice. In vitro activation of macrophages (MФ) by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) delayed MHV3 replication only in cells that originated from A/J mice, although cell populations from both A/J, and BALB/c mice were able to synthesize comparable amounts of IFN-α/β. Using specific antibodies, we have shown that the delayed MHV3 replication in LPS-activated A/J MФ was due, in part, to IFN-α/β. A/J MФ were found to be more sensitive to IFN-γ than to IFN-α/β, and BALB/c MФ did not develop an antiviral state to either IFN. Cultured spleen cells from A/J mice synthesized more IFN-γ than BALB/c spleen cells after specific or non-specific stimulation. The results indicate that IFN-activated MФ may play a crucial role in the resistance to MHV3 infection. Since IFN-γ is produced in large amounts by A/J spleen cells after specific stimulation with MHV3 and is efficient in activating the A/J MФ, a T cell-dependent mechanism- is likely to be involved.","Lucchiari, Maria A.; Pereira, Carlos A.",Immunobiology,200,13

Development of new and improved immunologic assay systems has paved the way for accurate and reliable rapid diagnostic tests that detect viral antigens in clinical specimens. We conducted a careful and elaborate study in which radioimmunoassay for antigen detection was compared with a battery of tissue culture systems for viral isolation and identification. Using a fine plastic catheter, a specimen of mucus was aspirated from the nasopharynx of patients with clinical signs and symptoms of acute viral upper respiratory tract infections. Each specimen was divided into two portions; one was used to inoculate a variety of tissue culture cell lines and the other was used for radioimmunoassay tests for influenza A and B, adenovirus, parainfluenza 1, 2, and 3, and respiratory syncytial virus. Radioimmunoassay results compared very favorably with the tissue culture data with only one exception—adenovirus. Essentially this degree of accuracy and reproducibility was obtained with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test, which has replaced radioimmunoassay. Tissue cultures are still used for backup, but with a rapid antigen detection system in place, coupled with a modern computer program to facilitate the laboratory data to the clinician, considerable strides have been made, and will continue to be made, in the diagnosis and therapy of viral respiratory tract infections.","Habermehl, K.-O.",Diagn Microbiol Infect Dis,200,1

Possible mechanisms include epithelial damage, interaction with adhesion molecules or with T‐helper cell subsets. Objective To determine whether colds increase lower airway inflammation, comparing atopic with non‐atopic normal subjects. Methods Thirty healthy volunteers (15 atopic) took part. Basehne tests included viral serology. microbiological culture and polymerase chain reaction for rhinovirus infection (HRV‐PCR), histamine bronchial provocation and bronchoscopy. Twenty subjects (eight atopic) underwent repeat tests when they developed a cold. Results Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV(1)) was significantly lower during colds (‐0.19L [95% confidence mterval ‐0.10, ‐0.29], P= 0,0004) and there was a significant increase in bronchial responsiveness (+0.62 doublings of the dose‐response slope [+0.24, +1.00], P=0.003). Eight subjects (two atopic) had a diagnosed viral infection: two HRV. three coronavirus (HCV), one HRV + HCV, one parainfluenza III(PI) and one respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (also Haemophilus influenzae). In biopsies, during colds, total eosinophils (EG1(+)) increased significantly (geometric mean 6.73‐fold [1.12,40.46], P=O.04). Activated eosinophils (EG2(+)) only increased significantly in the subgroup without diagnosed viral infection and particularly in atopic rhinitics. T‐suppressor (CD8(+)) cells also increased significantly (median +178.3 cells mm(2), P= 0.004). Epithelial expression of intercellular adhesion molecule‐1 (ICAM‐1) expression increased in four atopic rhinitics during colds. Bronchial washings showed a significant increase in neutrophils (GM 1.53‐fold [1.04,2.25], P= 0.02). Conclusion Lower airway inflammation was present in atopic and non‐atopic normal subjects with colds. Atopic subjects differed in that they were less likely to have positive virological tests and were more likely to show activated eosinophilia in the lower airway, despite a similar spectrum of symptoms.","TRIGG, C.

However, randomized evidence of its clinical effectiveness is lacking. We compared MMD within community ART refill groups (CARGs) vs. standard-of-care facility-based ART delivery in Zimbabwe. METHODS: A three-arm, cluster-randomized, pragmatic noninferiority trial was performed. Thirty health care facilities and associated CARGs were allocated to either ART collected three-monthly at facility (3MF, control); ART delivered three-monthly in CARGs (3MC); or ART delivered six-monthly in CARGs (6MC). Stable adults receiving ART ≥six months with baseline viral load (VL) <1000 copies/ml were eligible. Retention in ART care (primary outcome) and viral suppression (VS) 12 months after enrollment were compared, using regression models specified for clustering (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03238846). RESULTS: 4800 participants were recruited, 1919, 1335, and 1546 in arms 3MF, 3MC, and 6MC, respectively. For retention, the prespecified noninferiority limit (-3.25%, risk difference [RD]) was met for comparisons between all arms, 3MC (94.8%) vs. 3MF (93.0%), adjusted RD = 1.1% (95% CI: -0.5% to 2.8%); 6MC (95.5%) vs. 3MF: aRD = 1.2% (95% CI: -1.0% to 3.6%); and 6MC vs. 3MC: aRD = 0.1% (95% CI: -2.4% to 2.6%). VL completion at 12 months was 49%, 45%, and 8% in 3MF, 3MC, and 6MC, respectively. VS in 3MC (99.7%) was high and not different to 3MF (99.1%), relative risk = 1.0 (95% CI: 1.0-1.0). VS was marginally reduced in 6MC (92.9%) vs. 3MF, relative risk = 0.9 (95% CI: 0.9-1.0). CONCLUSION: Retention in CARGs receiving three- and six-monthly MMD was noninferior versus standard-of-care facility-based ART delivery. VS in 3MC was high. VS in six-monthly CARGs requires further evaluation.","Fatti, Geoffrey; Ngorima-Mabhena, Nicoletta; Mothibi, Eula; Muzenda, Trish; Choto, Regis; Kasu, Tonderai; Tafuma, Taurayi A.; Mahachi, Nyika; Takarinda, Kudakwashe C.; Apollo, Tsitsi; Mugurungi, Owen; Chasela, Charles; Hoffman, Risa M.; Grimwood, Ashraf",J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr,200,1

Recent findings on the genome organization, its relationship to other viruses, the replication of HCV ribonucleic acid, HCV translation, and HCV polyprotein expression and processing are discussed. Also reviewed are virus assembly and release, the variability of HCV and its classification into genotypes, the geographic distribution of HCV genotypes, and the biologic differences between HCV genotypes. The assays used in HCV genotyping are discussed in terms of reliability and consistency of results, and the molecular epidemiology of HCV infection is reviewed. These approaches to HCV epidemiology will prove valuable in documenting the spread of HCV in different risk groups, evaluating alternative (nonparenteral) routes of transmission, and in understanding more about the origins and evolution of HCV.","Simmonds, Peter",Clin Ther,200,1

The purpose of this study was to describe the indications, epidemiology, frequency, and associated factors for tracheostomy in critically ill paediatric patients using the data available in the Japanese Registry of Paediatric Acute Care (JaRPAC). METHODS: This multicentre epidemiologic study collected data concerning paediatric tracheostomy from the JaRPAC database. Patients were divided into two groups: those with or without tracheostomies when they were discharged from the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) or Paediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU). Consecutive patients aged ≤16 years who did not undergo tracheostomy when admitted to ICU or PICU between April 2014 and March 2017 were included. RESULTS: A total of 23 hospitals participated, involving 6199 paediatric patients registered in the JaRPAC database during the study period. Of the registered paediatric patients, 5769 (95%) patients were admitted to the ICUs or PICUs without tracheostomies. Among the patients, 181 patients (3.1%) had undergone tracheostomies. There were significant differences in chronic conditions (134, 74.0% versus 3096, 55.4%, p < 0.01), chromosomal anomalies (19, 10.5% versus 326, 5.8%, p < 0.01), urgent admission (151, 83.4% versus 3093, 55.4%, p < 0.01). More tracheostomies were performed on patients who were admitted for respiratory failure (61, 33.7% versus 926, 16.1%, p < 0.01) and for post-cardiac pulmonary arrest (CPA) resuscitation (40, 22.1% versus 71, 1.1%, p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report to use a large-scale registry of critically ill paediatric patients in Japan to describe the interrelated factors of tracheostomies. Chronic conditions (especially for neuromuscular disease), chromosomal anomaly, admission due to respiratory failure, or treatment for post-CPA resuscitation all had the possibility to be risk factors for tracheostomy.","Ishihara, Tadashi; Tanaka, Hiroshi",BMC Pediatr,200,3

However, few studies have focused on the factors that improve the influence of health messages on social media. OBJECTIVE: To explore the influence of goal-framing effects, information organizing, and the use of pictures or videos in health-promoting messages, we conducted a case study of Sina Weibo, a popular social media platform in China. METHODS: Literature review and expert discussion were used to determine the health themes of childhood obesity, smoking, and cancer. Web crawler technology was employed to capture data on health-promoting messages. We used the number of retweets, comments, and likes to evaluate the influence of a message. Statistical analysis was then conducted after manual coding. Specifically, binary logistic regression was used for the data analyses. RESULTS: We crawled 20,799 Sina Weibo messages and selected 389 health-promoting messages for this study. Results indicated that the use of gain-framed messages could improve the influence of messages regarding childhood obesity (P<.001), smoking (P=.03), and cancer (P<.001). Statistical expressions could improve the influence of messages about childhood obesity (P=.02), smoking (P=.002), and cancer (P<.001). However, the use of videos significantly improved the influence of health-promoting messages only for the smoking-related messages (P=.009). CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggested that gain-framed messages and statistical expressions can be successful strategies to improve the influence of messages. Moreover, appropriate pictures and videos should be added as much as possible when generating health-promoting messages.","Rao, Qingmao; Zhang, Zuyue; Lv, Yalan; Zhao, Yong; Bai, Li; Hou, Xiaorong",JMIR Med Inform,200,1

However, there remains limitations to engineer and regenerate tissues. Targeted therapies using cell-encapsulated hydrogels, such as mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), are capable of reducing inflammation and increasing the regenerative potential in several tissues. In addition, the use of MSC-derived nano-scale secretions (i.e., exosomes) has been promising. Exosomes originate from the multivesicular division of cells and have high therapeutic potential, yet neither self-replicate nor cause auto-immune reactions to the host. To maintain their biological activity and allow a controlled release, these paracrine factors can be encapsulated in biomaterials. Among the different types of biomaterials in which exosome infusion is exploited, hydrogels have proven to be the most user-friendly, economical, and accessible material. In this paper, we highlight the importance of MSCs and MSC-derived exosomes in tissue engineering and the different biomaterial strategies used in fabricating exosome-based biomaterials, to facilitate hard and soft tissue engineering.","Khayambashi, Parisa; Iyer, Janaki; Pillai, Sangeeth; Upadhyay, Akshaya; Zhang, Yuli; Tran, Simon D.",Int J Mol Sci,200,1

Yet few studies have examined stress and burnout among healthcare providers in sub-Saharan Africa, and even fewer among maternity providers who work under very stressful conditions. To address these gaps, we examined self-reported stress and burnout levels as well as stress-related physiologic measures of these providers, along with their potential predictors. METHODS: Participants included 101 maternity providers (62 nurses/midwives, 16 clinical officers/doctors, and 23 support staff) in western Kenya. Respondents completed Cohen’s Perceived Stress Scale, the Shirom-Melamed Burnout scale, and other sociodemographic, health, and work-related items. We also collected data on heart rate variability (HRV) and hair cortisol levels to assess stress-related physiologic responses to acute and chronic stress respectively. Multilevel linear regression models were computed to examine individual and work-related factors associated with stress, burnout, HRV, and cortisol level. RESULTS: 85% of providers reported moderate stress and 11.5% high stress. 65% experienced low burnout and 19.6% high burnout. Average HRV (measured as the root mean square of differences in intervals between successive heart beats: RMSSD) was 60.5 (SD = 33.0) and mean cortisol was mean cortisol was 44.2 pg/mg (SD = 60.88). Greater satisfaction with life accomplishments was associated with reduced stress (β = − 2.83; CI = -5.47; − 0.18), while motivation to work excessively (over commitment) was associated with both increased stress (β = 0.61 CI: 0.19, 1.03) and burnout (β = 2.05, CI = 0.91, 3.19). Female providers had higher burnout scores compared to male providers. Support staff had higher HRV than other providers and providers under 30 years of age had higher HRV than those 30 and above. Although no association between cortisol and any predictor was statistically significant, the direction of associations was consistent with those found for stress and burnout. CONCLUSIONS: Most providers experienced moderate to high levels of stress and burnout. Individuals who were more driven to work excessively were particularly at risk for higher stress and burnout. Higher HRV of support staff and providers under age 30 suggest their more adaptive autonomic nervous system response to stress. Given its impact on provider wellbeing and quality of care, interventions to help providers manage stress are critical.

When hosts also live in metapopulations, there may be critical differences in the dynamics that emerge from the synergy among evolutionary, ecological, and epidemiological factors. Here we used a Susceptible-Infected-Recovery model to explore how spatial and temporal ecological factors may drive the epidemiological and rapid-evolutionary dynamics of host metapopulations. For simplicity, we assumed two host genotypes: wild type, which has a positive intrinsic growth rate in the absence of disease, and robust type, which is less likely to catch the infection given exposure but has a lower intrinsic growth rate in the absence of infection. We found that the robust-type host would be strongly selected for in the presence of disease when transmission differences between the two types is large. The growth rate of the wild type had dual but opposite effects on host composition: a smaller increase in wild-type growth increased wild-type competition and lead to periodical disease outbreaks over the first generations after pathogen introduction, while larger growth increased disease by providing more susceptibles, which increased robust host density but decreased periodical outbreaks. Increased migration had a similar impact as the increased differential susceptibility, both of which led to an increase in robust hosts and a decrease in periodical outbreaks. Our study provided a comprehensive understanding of the combined effects among migration, disease epidemiology, and host demography on host evolution with an unchanging pathogen. The findings have important implications for wildlife conservation and zoonotic disease control.","Jiao, Jing; Fefferman, Nina",Sci Rep,200,1

Results from Saudi Arabia are presented here. METHODS: A survey was conducted from June to September 2018. In Saudi Arabia, eligible PwO were ≥18 years with a self reported body mass index of ≥30 kg/m(2). Eligible HCPs were in direct patient care. RESULTS: The survey was completed by 1,000 PwO and 200 HCPs in Saudi Arabia. Many PwO (68%) and HCPs (62%) agreed that obesity is a chronic disease. PwO felt responsible for their weight management (67%), but 71% of HCPs acknowledged their responsibility to contribute. Overall, 58% of PwO had discussed weight with their HCP in the past 5 years, 46% had received a diagnosis of obesity, and 44% had a follow up appointment scheduled. Although 50% of PwO said they were motivated to lose weight, only 39% of HCPs thought their patients were motivated to lose weight. Less than half of PwO (39%) and HCPs (49%) regarded genetic factors as a barrier to weight loss. Many PwO had seriously attempted weight loss (92%) and achieved ≥5% weight loss (61%), but few maintained their weight loss for >1 year (5%). CONCLUSION: Saudi Arabian results have revealed misperceptions among PwO and HCPs about obesity, highlighting opportunities for further education and training about obesity including the biologic basis and clinical management.","Alfadda, Assim A; Al Qarni, Ali; Alamri, Khalid; Ahamed, Shaik Shaffi; Abo’ouf, Shaza Mohammed; Shams, Mahmoud; Abdelfattah, Waleed; Al Shaikh, Abdulrahman",Saudi J Gastroenterol,200,17

In ASCOT (Anglo-Scandinavian Outcome Trial), we determined whether dementia or stroke were associated with different blood pressure (BP)–lowering regimens; atorvastatin or placebo; and mean BP, BP variability, and mean cholesterol levels. METHODS: Participants with hypertension and ≥3 cardiovascular disease risk factors were randomly allocated to amlodipine- or atenolol-based BP-lowering regimen targeting BP <140/90 mm Hg for 5.5 years. Participants with total cholesterol ≤6.5 mmol/L were also randomly allocated to atorvastatin 10 mg or placebo for 3.3 years.

An amlodipine-based compared with an atenolol-based regimen for 5.5 years reduced stroke (443 versus 522; adjusted HR, 0.82 [95% CI, 0.72–0.93]; P=0.003) but not dementia (450 versus 465; adjusted HR, 0.94 [95% CI, 0.82–1.07]; P=0.334) over follow-up. BP variability (SD mean BP) was associated with a higher risk of dementia (per 5 mm Hg HR, 1.14 [95% CI, 1.06–1.24]; P<0.001) and stroke (HR, 1.21 [95% CI, 1.12–1.32]; P<0.001) adjusted for mean BP. CONCLUSIONS: An amlodipine-based BP regimen reduced the long-term incidence of stroke compared with an atenolol-based regimen but had no measurable effect on dementia. Atorvastatin had no effect on either stroke or dementia. Higher BP variability was associated with a higher incidence of later dementia and stroke.","Whiteley, William N.; Gupta, Ajay K.; Godec, Thomas; Rostamian, Somayeh; Whitehouse, Andrew; Mackay, Judy; Sever, Peter S.",Stroke,200,8

OBJECTIVE: To examine guideline-recommended CKD care delivery by race and ethnicity in a large, diverse population. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this serial cross-sectional study, adult patients with CKD that did not require dialysis, defined as a persistent estimated glomerular filtration rate less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) or a urine albumin-creatinine ratio of 30 mg/g or higher for at least 90 days, were identified in 2-year cross-sections from January 1, 2012, to December 31, 2019. Data from the OptumLabs Data Warehouse, a national data set of administrative and electronic health record data for commercially insured and Medicare Advantage patients, were used. EXPOSURES: The independent variables were race and ethnicity, as reported in linked electronic health records. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: On the basis of guideline-recommended CKD care, the study examined care delivery process measures (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker prescription for albuminuria, statin prescription, albuminuria testing, nephrology care for CKD stage 4 or higher, and avoidance of chronic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug prescription) and care delivery outcome measures (blood pressure and diabetes control). RESULTS: A total of 452 238 patients met the inclusion criteria (mean [SD] age, 74.0 [10.2] years; 262 089 [58.0%] female; a total of 7573 [1.7%] Asian, 49 970 [11.0%] Black, 15 540 [3.4%] Hispanic, and 379 155 [83.8%] White). Performance on process measures was higher among Asian, Black, and Hispanic patients compared with White patients for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and angiotensin II receptor blocker use (79.8% for Asian patients, 76.7% for Black patients, and 79.9% for Hispanic patients compared with 72.3% for White patients in 2018-2019), statin use (72.6% for Asian patients, 69.1% for Black patients, and 74.1% for Hispanic patients compared with 61.5% for White patients), nephrology care (64.8% for Asian patients, 72.9% for Black patients, and 69.4% for Hispanic patients compared with 58.3% for White patients), and albuminuria testing (53.9% for Asian patients, 41.0% for Black patients, and 52.6% for Hispanic patients compared with 30.7% for White patients). Achievement of blood pressure control to less than 140/90 mm Hg was similar or lower among Asian (71.8%), Black (63.3%), and Hispanic (69.8%) patients compared with White patients (72.9%). Achievement of diabetes control with hemoglobin A(1c) less than 7.0% was 50.1% in Asian patients, 49.3% in Black patients, and 46.0% in Hispanic patients compared with 50.3% for White patients. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Higher performance on CKD care process measures among Asian, Black, and Hispanic patients suggests that differences in medication prescription and diagnostic testing are unlikely to fully explain known disparities in CKD progression and kidney failure. Improving care delivery processes alone may be inadequate for reducing these disparities.","Chu, Chi D.; Powe, Neil R.; McCulloch, Charles E.; Crews, Deidra C.; Han, Yun; Bragg-Gresham, Jennifer L.; Saran, Rajiv; Koyama, Alain; Burrows, Nilka R.; Tuot, Delphine S.",JAMA Netw Open,200,32

More recent research in landscape ecology has produced an expanded view of ecotones and elaboration of their characteristics and functions in ecosystems. Parallel research on emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) and the causes of increased rates of pathogen transmission, spread, and adaptation suggests a correspondence between ecotonal processes and the ecological and evolutionary processes responsible for zoonotic and vector-borne emerging infections. A review of the literature suggests that ecotones play a role in a number of the most important EIDs. Yet these are the only diseases for which specific landscape ecological information exists in the literature or disease reports. However, the similar disease ecologies of these with about half of the approximately 130 zoonotic EIDs suggests ecotones, particularly their anthropogenic origination or modification, may be generally associated with ecotones and the global trend of increasing EIDs.","Despommier, Dickson; Ellis, Brett R.; Wilcox, Bruce A.",Ecohealth,200,1

A set of clinical and laboratory criteria necessary for an ideal diagnostic marker of infection have previously been proposed by Ng and his colleagues [1]. According these criteria, an ideal biomarker should possess at a minimum the following characteristics: (a) biochemically, a biomarker should be stable and remain significantly deregulated in the body fluid compartment for at least 12–24 h even after commencement of appropriate treatment that may allow an adequate time window for specimen collection or storage without significant decomposition of the active compound until laboratory processing; (b) its concentration should be determined quantitatively and the method of measurement should be automatic, rapid, easy, and inexpensive; (c) the collection of a specimen should be minimally invasive and require a small volume (e.g., <0.5 mL blood). Numerous biomarkers have been found and tested in clinical practice.

This is because the venue of a mass gathering usually does not change year-to-year. As a result, special attention can be given to the public health risks that are introduced by travelers from around the world into these mass gatherings. Travelers can also be infected with diseases that are endemic in the host country and transport the locally acquired infectious diseases to their home environments. Therefore, mass gatherings can be thought of as global-to-local-to-global events because of the initial convergence of global populations and the subsequent divergence of populations throughout the world. This chapter discusses three active areas of geographic research that have emerged from our understanding of disease surveillance at mass gatherings: the role of transportation and population geographies in disease surveillance; the spatial and temporal dimensions of environmental geography in the spread of disease; and the advances in GIScience that provide real-world surveillance and monitoring of disease and injuries at mass gatherings.","Blatt, Amy J.","Health, Science, and Place",200,1

The EU has called this as “an unprecedented displacement crisis” and has aimed at devising a comprehensive approach to tackle it, which has been widely criticized. Concerns about public healthcare aspects of the crisis have permanently entered the media and policy discourse even though no systematic association between migration and the importation of infectious diseases has been recorded. In this context, the literature has not filled the existing gap between discourse and evidence, and almost no publications with reliable empirical data exist, both thematic (epidemiology) and geographical (Eastern Europe and Bulgaria). Among the existing publications, the focus has been on TB and HIV (Odone et al., Euro J Public Health 25(3):506–512, 2015). In light of this, the aim of this research is to contribute to the debate by providing an overview of the refugee situation in Bulgaria, as a primary entry-point for refugees entering the EU. In order to achieve this, the article analyses the case of the refugee camp in city of Harmanly, close to the Bulgarian-Turkish border, and assesses the public health risks related to this specific situation. Based on a study of 128 patients with different symptoms we aim to draw wider implications about the linkages between public health and migration. The in-depth review of this specific case shows that both the probability and impact of migration on public health increases when the hosting country is relatively poor, the domestic public healthcare system is not efficient, and there is lack of trust in the government and public services. The study contributes to understanding better these risks in order to identify potential mitigation strategies in the region and the EU as a whole.","Mihaylova-Garnizova, Raynichka; Garnizov, Vasil",Defence Against Bioterrorism,200,1

Sports medicine physicians face the challenge of promoting sufficient recovery and responding to the demands of the coaches and athletes. This chapter presents the evidence behind the risk factors for acute illness in athletes, the negative consequences of sports participation during illness and the recommendations for safe sports participation. Risk factors for infection and illness may be intrinsic (e.g. postexercise suppression of the immune system, recent acute illness, female gender) and extrinsic (e.g. training load, nutrition, resting periods). Fever during illness contributes to systemic symptoms such as headache and myalgia but also to dehydration, muscle breakdown and reduction in cardiometabolic function. The consequences of exercise during illnesses may be aggravation of illness, loss of muscle strength and endurance, cardiac complications, transmission of infection to others, neurological dysfunctions including coordination problems, rhabdomyolysis and in the worst case sudden death. Recommendations for safe return to sport include clearance of infection allowing full recovery and thereafter gradual progress of exercise volume combined with monitoring of remaining symptoms of illness. Different actions can be taken to prevent acquiring, aggravating and spreading of infections by the athlete (e.g. hygiene, physical contact, covering of the body, sharing of equipment, nutrition), the coaches (e.g. individualised plan of training, competition, nutrition, recovery and recovery measures) and the physicians (monitor and implement illness prevention, identify and arrange for high-risk athletes, educate athletes and staff).","Börjesson, Mats; Arvidsson, Daniel; Rensburg, Christa Janse Van; Schwellnus, Martin",Return to Play in Football,200,9

Four new life cycle behaviours are named: nursery hiding, mid-moult stage, positive precursor (intraspecific antagonism) and negative precursor (ambush strategy). Further strategies discussed are opossum attack, double parasitism (doubling of the normal reproductive set), duplex arrangement (separated male-female pairs), simple rebrooding, and describing how displaced parasites and superinfections may partly elucidate life cycles. Proportional stunting masks life history effects of parasitism; cuckoo copepods are true parasites and not just associates; burrowing barnacles (acrothoracicans) are not parasites. Further findings based on life cycle information: branchiurans and pentastomes are possibly not related; firefly seed shrimp are not parasites; copepod pre-adult life cycle stages are common in the western pacific but rare in Caribbean; harpacticoids on vertebrates are not parasites; cuckoo copepods are true parasites; explained the importance of pennellid intermediate hosts. Crustacean parasite life cycles are largely unknown (1% of species). Most crustacean life cycles represent minor modifications from the ancestral free-living mode. Crustacean parasites have less complex and less modified life cycles than other major parasite groups. This limits their exploitation of, and effectiveness, in parasitism. However, these life cycles will be an advantage in Global Change.

Our objective is to utilise metaphor to instigate critical reflection about the nature of social media use behaviour and the role of habitual social media use in our experiences of reality. The first metaphor, social media as a town square, draws attention to the centrality of social media platforms in their users’ lives, fear of missing out, augmented reality and digital dualism. Through the second metaphor, social media as a beauty pageant, we explore self-presentation or image crafting, social comparison and self-evaluation. The third metaphor, social media as a parliament, emphasises the role of social media platforms as spaces for online deliberation and we consider social media capital, homophily and polarisation as themes. Finally, we explore anonymity, deindividuation and deceptive self-presentation through our fourth metaphor, social media as a masquerade ball. We argue that social media scholars can use these and other metaphors to enhance communication of their research findings. Additionally, we believe that social media metaphors can be powerful pedagogical and communication tools, particularly when working with students for whom high levels of social media use is the norm.","le Roux, Daniel B.; Parry, Douglas A.","Responsible Design, Implementation and Use of Information and Communication Technology",200,1

Igs are divided into classes having different physico-chemical structures and biological activities. The major Ig classes in bovine and human milk are IgA, IgG and IgM. Bovine colostral Igs provide the newborn calf with passive immune protection against microbial infections until the calf’s own immune system matures. Colostral Ig preparations designed for farm animals have been commercially available for many years. Potential health benefits attributed to bovine colostrum have increased manufacture and marketing of colostral Ig-based dietary supplements also for human use. Furthermore, specific anti-microbial antibodies can be produced into colostrum by immunizing cows with vaccines made of pathogenic microorganisms. These antibodies can be concentrated and used to formulate so-called immune milk preparations. Such preparations have proven effective in prevention of animal and human infections caused, e.g. by rotavirus, Shigella flexneri, Escherichia coli, Clostridium difficile, Streptococcus mutans, Cryptosporidium parvum and Helicobacter pylori. Their therapeutic efficacy, however, seems limited.

Proteases represent the largest segment of the industrial enzyme market where they are used in detergents, in food processing, in leather and fabric upgrading, as catalysts in organic synthesis, and as therapeutics. Microbial protease overproducing strains have been developed by conventional screening, mutation/selection strategies and genetic engineering, and wholly new enzymes, with altered specificity or stability have been designed through techniques such as site-directed mutagenesis and directed evolution. Complete sequencing of the genomes of key Bacillus and Aspergillus workhorse extracellular enzyme producers and other species of interest has contributed to enhanced production yields of indigenous proteases as well as to production of heterologous proteases. With annual protease sales of about $1.5–1.8 billion, proteases account for 60% of the total enzyme market. Detergent proteases, with an annual market of about $1 billion account for the largest protease application segment. Subtilisin Carlsberg and related subtilisin serine proteases represent the first generation of detergent proteases with pH optima of 9–10. The second generation, having higher pH optima (10–11) and greater temperature stability, is produced from alkalophilic strains including Bacillus clausii and B. halodurans. The third generation consists of detergent proteases whose active sites and/or stability have been modified by protein engineering. The principal applications of proteases in food processing are in brewing, cereal mashing, and beer haze clarification, in the coagulation step in cheese making, in altering the viscoelastic properties of dough in baking and in production of protein hydrolysates. In organic synthesis, proteases have application in synthesis and/or hydrolysis of peptide, ester, and amide bonds involving carboxylic acids and are effective tools for resolution of pairs of enantiomers. Proteases have applications in nutrition as digestive aids and in therapy in thrombosis and cancer treatment. Hyperproteolytic endogenous activity may play significant roles in abnormal physiological functioning as well as in microbial and viral pathophysiological conditions and this has created substantial momentum for development of protease inhibitors as therapeutic agents against disease-causing proteases.","Ward, O.P.",Comprehensive Biotechnology,200,1

Aliquots of viral stocks frozen at a designated passage level can then be used for multiple and repeatable experiments with the same viral population. Furthermore, it is important that consistency should be maintained during the production of viral vaccines; new lots of final product are prepared with frozen viral seed stocks that consistently reproduce the desired immunogenic and attenuation characteristics. To better appreciate the requirements for freezing and freeze drying of human and animal viruses, some consideration is given to understanding the structural and functional organization of this diverse group of microorganisms. The classification of viruses is based on morphological and physiochemical properties.

Direct ELISA was shown to be useless for differentiating NOA from HDOA. Immunoprecipitation in solution is time consuming and, moreover, whereas NAC(1) was shown to be specific for NOA compared with HDOA, DAC(1), NAC(2) and DAC(2) were shown not to be fully specific for HDOA. In contrast, by using as capture antibodies either NAC(3) or DAC(4), a sandwich ELISA can be designed which is fully specific for NOA or HDOA, respectively. An approach to the identification of the temperature at which ovalbumin has been heated is described. This test will show whether ovalbumin has been heated to lower than 65°C or higher than 85°C.

These characteristics of ASMase suggest a possible role of this molecule in the phagocytotic uptake and phagosomal degradation processes of antigens or in antigen presentation. We show here that ASMase(–/–) mice fail to eliminate the noncytopathic lymphocytic choriomeningitis (LCM) virus as rapidly as littermate wildtype mice. Investigation of the immune response revealed a reduced expansion of CD8(+) T cells. The secretion of IFN‐γ in response to contact with target cells as well as the cytolytic activity of virus‐specific CD8(+) T cells was severely impaired. Additionally, both phases of the LCM virus‐specific DTH response, mediated by CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cells consecutively, were diminished in ASMase(–/–) mice. However, the secondary memory response of virus‐specific CTL was not altered, and the virus was effectively controlled for at least 3 months by ASMase(–/–) mice. In conclusion, the results of this study suggest an involvement of the ASMase in the activation, expansion or maturation of virus‐specific CD8(+) T cells during the acute infection of mice with the LCM virus.","Utermöhlen, O.; Karow, U.; Baschuk, N.; Herz, J.; Loegters, T.

Besides being a summary, it has another purpose. A showpiece, it beckons the reader into the paper. You do not want to compose an abstract so well devised the prospective reader after glancing at it will decide to skip the paper. But even worse, you want to avoid writing an abstract so discouraging as to turn the reader away from both the abstract and the paper itself. Don’t compose an unreadable abstract. This would seem to go without saying. An opening sentence such as ”Fragments of polyketide synthase (PKS) genes were amplified from complementary DNA (cDNA) of the fusarin C producing filamentous fungi Fusarium monoliforme and Fusarium venetatum by using degenerate oligonucleotides designed to select for fungal PKS C-methyltransferase (CmeT) domains“ is impossible: Too technical, too dense, too complicated a syntax, heavy with acronyms. Le’s start with translating and breaking down this sentence. How about, instead, ”Two species of filamentous fungi produce fusarin. Their complementary DNA serve to amplify fragments of polyketide synthase genes. We use for this purpose degenerate oligonucleotides, designed to select for the desired methyltransferase domains.“ Moreover, since the title of the paper starts with ”Fusarin C Biosynthesis“, don’t repeat it. The desired meaning of the above sentence is ”We have prepared oligonucleotide PCR primers selective for fungal polyketide synthase genes.“ Why not start the abstract thus? Think of an abstract as a shop window. It requires elegance and attractiveness. The latter ought to be a reflection of the quality of the work, of the novelty of its approach, of the importance of its results. The former is exclusively a matter of word-craft, of style. It is not enough to whip out an abstract in five minutes, either before writing the paper or after having done so. A good abstract might be hours in the making. To invest time assembling such a jewel is not out of whack. How can it be done? Write as if you were penning a postcard to a friend: use simple sentences, don’t get technical and utter a clean message in a maximum of 50 to 100 words. Incapable of such a feat? In that case, take a printout of your completed paper and underline a dozen sentences you feel epitomize the work. Paste them together and tie them together with transitions. Now, edit this paragraph. Be merciless. Try to reduce it by a third. You should now have the first draft of your abstract. It only remains to turn it from decent into artful English. Do not hesitate to resort to a dictonary of synonyms and to use other tools such as a style manual. Read your abstract aloud, a crucial test. It will make you jettison multisyllabic unpronouncable words. It will make you focus on the genuine achievements of the paper. It will make you grab your reader by the sleeve: ”come inside, Mister, I have something truly marvellous I’d like to show you“.

The numerical methodology is based on splitting the system of equations into two sub-systems that group equations of the same kind and on applying a hybrid finite element method to solve the elliptic problem and a high-order finite volume method to solve the hyperbolic equations.

The accumulating evidence suggests that supplementation of albumin may provide survival advantages only when the insult is severe as in patients with septic shock. METHODS/DESIGN: The randomized controlled multicentre study of albumin replacement therapy in septic shock (ARISS) investigates whether the replacement with albumin and the maintenance of its serum levels of at least 30 g/l for 28 days improve survival in patients with septic shock compared to resuscitation and volume maintenance without albumin. Adult patients (≥ 18 years) with septic shock are randomly assigned within a maximum of 24 h after the onset of septic shock after obtaining informed consents to treatment or control groups. Patients assigned to the treatment group receive a 60-g loading dose of human albumin 20% over 2–3 h. Serum albumin levels are maintained at least at 30 g/l in the ICU for a maximum of 28 days following randomization using 40–80 g human albumin 20% infusion. The control group is treated according to the usual practice with crystalloids as the first choice for the resuscitation and maintenance phase of septic shock. The primary endpoint is 90 days mortality and secondary endpoints include 28-day, 60-day, ICU, and in-hospital mortality, organ dysfunction/failure, total amount of fluid administration and total fluid balance in the ICU, and lengths of ICU and hospital stay. In total, 1412 patients need to be analysed, 706 per group. For the sample size estimation, a 15% reduction in 90-day mortality is assumed, i.e. an absolute reduction of 7.5% points to 42.5% (relative risk 1.18). Assuming a dropout rate of 15%, a total of 1662 patients need to be allocated. DISCUSSION: The results of the clinical trial may influence the treatment of patients with septic shock. The expected improvement in patient survival may result in a reduction in the resources currently used in the treatment of these patients and in the socioeconomic burden of this disease.

In this particular case, we find that security governance that opens spaces for greater involvement of actors beyond the state could happen, albeit in a more circumscribed manner and subject of certain conditions. We identify three conditions that catalyze the opening of governance spaces: when the capacity of the state is stretched to the limits, when the legitimacy of the government is under pressure, and when there is trust between the government and other actors.","Caballero-Anthony, Mely; Gong, Lina",Fudan J,200,16

Changes in the role of education that followed the passage of the Civic Rights Act of 1964 and the Elementary and Secondary School Act of 1965, including programs and policies to promote greater social change within schools, stretched the already limited capacity of schools. While educational systems and the structure of American education remained the same, output largely remains the same, with at best modest improvements to access and little improvements in outcomes.

We aimed to assess the utility of NLR as a predictor of lung cancer-specific survival (LCS) and identify an optimal, pretreatment cutoff point in patients with localized NSCLC treated with stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) within the Veterans Affairs’ (VA) national database. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the VA database, we identified patients with biopsy-proven, clinical stage I NSCLC treated with SBRT between 2006 and 2015. Cutoff points for NLR were calculated using Contal/O’Quigley’s and Cox Wald methods. Primary outcomes of OS, LCS, and non-lung cancer survival (NCS) were evaluated in Cox and Fine-Gray models. RESULTS: In 389 patients, optimal NLR cutoff was identified as 4.0. In multivariable models, NLR > 4.0 was associated with decreased OS (HR 1.44, p = 0.01) and NCS (HR 1.68, p = 0.01) but not with LCS (HR 1.32, p = 0.09). In a subset analysis of 229 patients with pulmonary function tests, NLR > 4.0 remained associated with worse OS (HR 1.51, p = 0.02) and NCS (HR 2.18, p = 0.01) while the association with LCS decreased further (HR 1.22, p = 0.39). CONCLUSION: NLR was associated with worse OS in patients with localized NSCLC treated with SBRT; however, NLR was only associated with NCS and not with LCS. Pretreatment NLR, with a cutoff of 4.0, offers potential as a marker of competing mortality risk which can aid in risk stratification in this typically frail and comorbid population. Further studies are needed to validate pretreatment NLR as a clinical tool in this setting.","Kotha, Nikhil V.; Cherry, Daniel R.; Bryant, Alex K.; Nalawade, Vinit; Stewart, Tyler F.; Rose, Brent S.",Clin Transl Radiat Oncol,200,10

In early stages of PCD, mitochondrial membranes are made permeable by the formation of permeability transition pores, whose protein composition is debated. Cytochrome c (cyt c) is then released from mitochondria, inducing the degradation of chromatin characteristic of PCD. Since flooding stress can produce PCD in several plant species, the first goal of this study was to know if flooding stress could be used to induce PCD in Beta vulgaris roots. To do this, 2-month-old beet plants were flood-stressed from 1 to 5 days, and the alterations indicating PCD in stressed beetroot cells were observed with a confocal fluorescence microscope. As expected, nuclei were deformed, and chromatin was condensed and fragmented in flooded beetroots. In addition, cyt c was released from mitochondria. After assessing that flood stress induced PCD in beetroots, the composition of mitochondrial protein complexes was observed in control and flood-stressed beetroots. Protein complexes from isolated mitochondria were separated by native gel electrophoresis, and their proteins were identified by mass spectrometry. The spectra count of three isoforms of voltage-dependent anion-selective channels (VDACs) increased after 1 day of flooding. In addition, the size of the complexes formed by VDAC was higher in flood-stressed beetroots for 1 day (∼200 kDa) compared with non-stressed ones (∼100 kDa). Other proteins, such as chaperonin CPN60-2, also formed complexes with different masses in control and flood-stressed beetroots. Finally, possible interactions of VDAC with other proteins were found performing a cluster analysis. These results indicate that mitochondrial protein complexes formed by VDAC could be involved in the process of PCD in flood-stressed beetroots.

Stroke rate, mortality, and clinical and radiographic outcomes were examined. RESULTS Of 95 patients treated surgically, 85 (25 grade I, 60 grade II) met inclusion criteria, and all achieved radiographic cure postoperatively. Ten patients (11.8%) were lost to follow-up; the mean follow-up of the remaining 85 was 3.3 years. Three patients (3.5%) with grade II bAVMs experienced a stroke; no patients died. Although 20 patients (23.5%) had temporary postoperative neurological deficit, only 3 (3.5%) had new clinical impairment (modified Rankin Scale score ≥2) at last follow-up. Eight of the 13 patients (61.5%) with preexisting clinical impairment had improved modified Rankin Scale scores of 0 or 1; and 17 of 30 patients (56.7%) with preoperative seizures were seizure-free without antiepileptic medication postoperatively. No significant differences existed in stroke rate or clinical outcome between grades I and II patients at follow-up (Fisher exact test, P = .55 and P > .99, respectively). CONCLUSION Surgical resection of low-grade unruptured bAVMs is safe, with a high rate of improvement in functional status and seizure reduction. Although transient postoperative neurological deficit was observed in some patients, permanent treatment-related neurological morbidity was rare.

Eight joint replacement patients, 5 internal medicine patients, and 6 healthy persons were recruited. Serum of internal medicine patients, healthy people, and patients before and 24 hours after joint replacement were taken as study samples. Subcutaneous adipose, intra-articular adipose and intramedullary yellow bone marrow of patients undergoing joint replacement were taken as study samples. The level of FABP4 in the above samples was detected by enzyme-linked immunoassay. Normal distribution was tested. Paired sample T test was used for self-control. Univariate analysis of variance was used for multigroup comparison.There was no significant difference in serum FABP4 level between healthy persons, medical patients, and preoperative patients. The FABP4 level in yellow bone marrow and subcutaneous adipose was significantly higher than that in serum of healthy people, medical patients, and preoperative patients. FABP4 level in the serum after joint replacement was significantly higher than that before joint replacement. FABP4 may be a specific indicator of FE diagnosis, but further studies are needed to confirm its clinical value.","Wang, Zhuo; Buqi, Na; Zhang, Pingji; Wang, Yanxun; Lv, Yanwei; An, Guisheng",Medicine,200,20

Here, we created essential-gene CRISPRi knockdown libraries in biofilm-forming Bacillus subtilis and measured competitive fitness during colony co-culture with wild type. Partial knockdown of some translation-related genes reduced growth rates and led to out-competition. Media composition led some knockdowns to compete differentially as biofilm versus non-biofilm colonies. Cells depleted for the alanine racemase AlrA died in monoculture but survived in a biofilm-colony co-culture via nutrient sharing. Rescue was enhanced in biofilm-colony co-culture with a matrix-deficient parent, due to a mutualism involving nutrient and matrix sharing. We identified several examples of mutualism involving matrix sharing that occurred in three-dimensional biofilm colonies but not when cultured in two dimensions. Thus, growth in a three-dimensional colony can promote genetic diversity through sharing of secreted factors and may drive evolution of mutualistic behavior.","Arjes, Heidi A; Willis, Lisa; Gui, Haiwen; Xiao, Yangbo; Peters, Jason; Gross, Carol; Huang, Kerwyn Casey",eLife,200,1

This study investigated the dynamic vagal modulation of cardiac output in response to shifts in environmental demands in children and adolescents with ADHD, with and without a comorbid anxiety disorder. High-frequency HRV (HF-HRV) measures were obtained from 46 children and adolescents ranging from 6 to 17 (M = 9.38; SD = 2.31) years old, during three successive experimental conditions: a baseline recording followed by a sustained attention task, and a post-task recovery period. Findings support the reliability of the d2 Test, a cancelation test of attention and concentration, to induce parasympathetic withdrawal and extend prior work on ""vagal flexibility"". Further, these findings suggest a pattern of group differences in ANS functioning in children with ADHD, with and without a comorbid anxiety disorder. Only the ADHD without comorbid anxiety group showed a normative autonomic response to the cognitive challenge (reduced HF-HRV). The participants did not display an adaptive process of restoration following the cognitive challenge; the HRV suppression was prolonged during post-task recovery period, suggesting that ANS responded as if the cognitive stressor was still present. The current paper covers and discusses theoretical implications for the abnormalities in neurophysiological functioning and the different physiological responses in the two ADHD subtypes.","Robe, Andreea; Păsărelu, Costina-Ruxandra; Dobrean, Anca",Psychophysiology,200,20

The aim of this study is to compare the outcomes of kidney transplant procedures using the pure retroperitoneoscopic donor nephrectomy (PRDN) and hand-assisted retroperitoneoscopic donor nephrectomy (HARDN) techniques. METHODS A retrospective study involving 1508 transplant procedures was conducted; 874 were PRDN procedures; and 634 were HARDN. We reviewed the outcomes of the PRDN and HARDN groups, which were performed at two different centers over an identical time period. RESULTS Donors in the PRDN group had a longer operation time (P < 0.0001), reduced estimated blood loss (P < 0.0001), less open conversion (P = 0.0002), lower postoperative serum C-reactive protein levels (P < 0.0001), and a shorter postoperative hospital stay (P < 0.0001) than the HARDN group. Recipients in the PRDN group had lower serum creatinine levels at postoperative day 1-6 and the decreased incidence of slow graft function (P = 0.0017) than the HARDN group. The HARDN procedure was an independent risk factor for the incidence of acute rejection (P = 0.0211) and graft loss (P = 0.0193). CONCLUSIONS Our study suggests that the PRDN procedure is less invasive for donors as it results in reduced blood loss, lower postoperative serum CRP levels, and a shorter postoperative stay than the HARDN procedure. Additionally, PRDN provides a better outcome for recipients as it lowers the incidence of acute rejection and improves graft survival compared to HARDN.","Noguchi, Hiroshi; Kakuta, Yoichi; Okumi, Masayoshi; Omoto, Kazuya; Okabe, Yasuhiro; Ishida, Hideki; Nakamura, Masafumi; Tanabe, Kazunari",Surgical endoscopy,200,19

Acute kidney injury (AKI) necessitating continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is a severe complication in trauma patients (TP). We wanted to assess daily duration of CRRT and its impact on uremic control in TP. Material and Methods. We retrospectively reviewed adult TP, with or without rhabdomyolysis, with AKI undergoing CRRT. Data on daily CRRT duration and causes for temporary stops were collected from the first five CRRT days. Uremic control was assessed by daily changes in serum urea (Δurea) and creatinine (Δcreatinine) concentrations. Results. Thirty-six TP were included with a total of 150 CRRT days, 17 (43%) with rhabdomyolysis. The median (interquartile range (IQR)) time per day with CRRT was 19 (15-21) hours. There was a significant correlation between daily CRRT duration and Δurea (r = 0.60, P≤0.001) and Δcreatinine (r = 0.43; P = 0.012). CRRT pauses were caused by filter clotting (54%), therapeutic interventions (25%), catheter related problems (10%), filter timeout (6%), and diagnostic procedures (6%). Rhabdomyolysis did not affect the CRRT data. Conclusions. TP undergoing CRRT had short daily CRRT duration causing reduced uremic control. Clinicians should modify their daily clinical practice to improve technical skills and achieve sufficient dialysis dose.","Beitland, Sigrid; Sunde, Kjetil; Moen, Harald; Os, Ingrid",Critical care research and practice,200,1

The genomic packaging signal (PS) for the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) was originally identified as an element that conferred packaging capability to defective interfering RNAs. The MHV PS is an RNA structure that maps to the region of the replicase gene encoding the nonstructural protein 15 subunit of the viral replicase-transcriptase complex. To begin to understand the role and mechanism of action of the MHV PS in its native genomic locus, we constructed viral mutants in which this cis-acting element was altered, deleted, or transposed. Our results demonstrated that the PS is pivotal in the selection of viral genomic RNA for incorporation into virions. Mutants in which PS RNA secondary structure was disrupted or entirely ablated packaged large quantities of subgenomic RNAs, in addition to genomic RNA. Moreover, the PS retained its function when displaced to an ectopic site in the genome. Surprisingly, the PS was not essential for MHV viability, nor did its elimination have a severe effect on viral growth. However, the PS was found to provide a distinct selective advantage to MHV. Viruses containing the PS readily outcompeted their otherwise isogenic counterparts lacking the PS.","Kuo, Lili; Masters, Paul S",Journal of virology,200,19

(2) What is the clinical effectiveness of tests that detect the presence of antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 virus to inform COVID-19 diagnosis? DESIGN AND SETTING Systematic review and meta-analysis of studies of diagnostic test accuracy. We systematically searched for all published evidence on the effectiveness of tests for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus, or antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, up to 4 May 2020, and assessed relevant studies for risks of bias using the QUADAS-2 framework. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Measures of diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity, specificity, positive/negative predictive value) were the main outcomes of interest. We also included studies that reported influence of testing on subsequent patient management, and that reported virus/antibody detection rates where these facilitated comparisons of testing in different settings, different populations or using different sampling methods. RESULTS 38 studies on SARS-CoV-2 virus testing and 25 studies on SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing were identified. We identified high or unclear risks of bias in the majority of studies, most commonly as a result of unclear methods of patient selection and test conduct, or because of the use of a reference standard that may not definitively diagnose COVID-19. The majority were in hospital settings, in patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection. Pooled analysis of 16 studies (3818 patients) estimated a sensitivity of 87.8% (95% CI 81.5% to 92.2%) for an initial reverse-transcriptase PCR test. For antibody tests, 10 studies reported diagnostic accuracy outcomes: sensitivity ranged from 18.4% to 96.1% and specificity 88.9% to 100%. However, the lack of a true reference standard for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis makes it challenging to assess the true diagnostic accuracy of these tests. Eighteen studies reporting different sampling methods suggest that for virus tests, the type of sample obtained/type of tissue sampled could influence test accuracy. Finally, we searched for, but did not identify, any evidence on how any test influences subsequent patient management. CONCLUSIONS Evidence is rapidly emerging on the effectiveness of tests for COVID-19 diagnosis and management, but important uncertainties about their effectiveness and most appropriate application remain. Estimates of diagnostic accuracy should be interpreted bearing in mind the absence of a definitive reference standard to diagnose or rule out COVID-19 infection. More evidence is needed about the effectiveness of testing outside of hospital settings and in mild or asymptomatic cases. Implementation of public health strategies centred on COVID-19 testing provides opportunities to explore these important areas of research.","Jarrom, David; Elston, Lauren; Washington, Jennifer; Prettyjohns, Matthew; Cann, Kimberley; Myles, Susan; Groves, Peter",BMJ evidence-based medicine,200,31

Maternal near miss can have several different health consequences and affect the women's quality of life, yet little is known about the size and magnitude of this association. The aim of this study was to assess the evidence of the association between women who have experienced maternal near miss and quality of life compared to women who had an uncomplicated pregnancy and delivery. MATERIAL AND METHODS Cochrane library, Embase, CINAHL, Web of science, Medline, Scopus and PubMed were searched for published studies. Studies were selected according to the PECO model (population, exposure, control, and outcome), and were included if they investigated quality of life as an outcome after maternal near miss among women of all ages with no limitation on country or time (up to June 2020). Maternal near miss was defined as a life-threatening condition arising from complications related to pregnancy and/or childbirth. The quality of the studies was assessed according to the Newcastle-Ottawa scale and a forest plot was constructed based on quality of life outcomes and study quality. PROSPERO registration number: CRD42020169232. RESULTS Fifteen studies were included in the review with a total of 31,558 women. Quality of life was reported in various ways, and 25 different confounders were controlled for. Compared to women who did not experience maternal near miss, women exposed to maternal near miss had an overall lower quality of life (n=2/2), had poorer mental (n=6/10) and social health (n=2/3) and maternal near miss had negative economic consequences (n=4/4). Maternal near miss was not associated with sexual dysfunction (n=1/5). Ten out of fifteen studies were assessed as being of poor quality. CONCLUSIONS Evidence shows that maternal near miss is negatively associated with various aspects of quality of life. This highlights the importance of addressing the adverse effects associated with maternal near miss and follow up maternal near miss after discharge. Quality of life is a multidimensional concept that is assessed in various ways, and the literature on the field is heterogenous. More high-quality studies are needed.","Von Rosen, Ida Erika Wieborg; Shiekh, Rayan Mohamud; Mchome, Bariki; Wu, Chunsen; Khan, Khalid S; Rasch, Vibeke; Linde, Ditte Søndergaard",Acta obstetricia et gynecologica Scandinavica,200,15

In our preliminary field trapping experiment, both female and male N. asiatica adults were captured by male-produced sex attractant. To provide a solid background for studying mechanism of olfaction, the sensilla of antenna and maxillary palp of N. asiatica adults were studied by means of scanning electron microscopy. Both sexes have 3 antennal segments, including scape, pedicel, and flagellum, while arista is arisen from the proximal dorsal ridge of the flagellum. Two types of sensilla were found on the scape and pedicel, sensilla microtrichia (AnMi) and sensilla chaetica (AnCh). There are five types of sensilla on the flagellum, sensilla basiconica (AnB), clavate sensilla (AnCl), sensilla trichoidea (AnTr), sensilla coeloconica (AnCo), and AnMi. Three types of sensilla were observed on maxillary palp, sensilla basiconica (MpB), sensilla microtrichia (MpMi), and sensilla chaetica (MpCh).

Glycemic variability (GV) has been suggested to play an even more important role in the risk of developing diabetic complications than sustained hyperglycemia. Physical activity (PA) has shown reducing effects on mean plasma glucose; however, the effect on GV in T2DM needs further description. The objective of this review is to evaluate the effect of PA on GV, assessed by continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in people with T2DM. Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted on MEDLINE and Embase to find randomized controlled trials (RCTs) covering the aspects T2DM, PA, and CGM. Following eligibility screening, variables of population characteristics, PA interventions, and GV outcomes were extracted and processed through qualitative synthesis. Risk of bias (ROB) was assessed using Cochrane ROB tool v2.0. Results: Of 1,825 identified articles, 40 full texts were screened. In the ten included RCTs matching the eligibility criteria, sample sizes ranged from nine to 63, mean age from 51 (SD 11) to 65 (SD 2) years and mean T2DM duration from four (SD 3) to ten (SD 6) years. Eight RCTs examined GV following single bouts of exercise, while two RCTs examined GV following training interventions. One RCT applied parallel group design, while nine RCTs applied crossover design. Numeric reductions in GV following acute exercise were seen, with four RCTs reaching statistical significance. Numeric reductions in GV were seen following training interventions, with one RCT reaching statistical significance. Numeric reductions of GV after PA appeared independently of intensity and T2DM progression but higher in participants with high baseline HbA1c and GV than with low. 80% of the trials were evaluated as uncertain/high ROB. Conclusion: The systematic literature search revealed limited and biased evidence showing that acute PA numerically reduced GV in patients with T2DM. PA reduced GV independently of PA intensity and T2DM progression. Prolonged RCTs with low ROB are needed to confirm reducing effects of PA on GV and to assess the influence of patient- and intervention characteristics on the effect of PA on GV.","Bennetsen, Sebastian L; Feineis, Camilla S; Legaard, Grit E; Lyngbæk, Mark P P; Karstoft, Kristian; Ried-Larsen, Mathias",Frontiers in endocrinology,200,1

This study aims to determine factors associated with and consequences of open conversion after LDP. METHODS Retrospective review of the first 40 consecutive LDP performed for pancreatic tumors from 2006 to 2015 was performed. Individual surgeon volume was stratified by ≤5 versus >5 cases and institution experience was stratified by two time periods 2006-2010 and 2011-2015. RESULTS Two high-volume surgeons performed 19 cases with an average case volume of ≥2/year whereas 10 low-volume surgeons performed 21 cases with an average case volume of <1/year. Median age of patients was 57.6 (range, 21-78) years. LDP was performed for malignancy in four (10%) patients. The median tumor size was 25 (range, 8-75) mm. Eight patients (20%) underwent subtotal pancreatectomies and seven (17.5%) had concomitant surgeries. Eleven (27.5%) LDP were spleen-saving procedures. Ten (25%) procedures were converted to open. Twenty-nine (72.5%) patients experienced 90-day/in-hospital morbidity of which eight (20%) were major (>grade II). There were 24 (60%) pancreatic fistulas of which 10 (25%) were grade B. Univariate analyses demonstrated that splenectomy (10 (34.5%) versus 0, P = 0.025), individual surgeon volume (<5 cases) (8 (38.1%) versus 2 (10.15%), P = 0.044) and institution experience (5 (55.6%) versus 5 (16.1%), P = 0.016) were factors associated with open conversion after LDP. Open conversion was associated with an increased rate of intra-operative blood transfusion (P = 0.053).

Performance of FLULUM was evaluated by comparing it to our real-time RT-PCR influenza virus assay on samples collected during two influenza seasons. Both assays targeted the matrix genes of influenza virus A (FluA M) and influenza virus B (FluB M) and the hemagglutinin genes of seasonal H3N2 (H3) and H1N1 (H1) and 2009 pandemic H1N1 (2009 H1). We evaluated FLULUM on both the Luminex LX200 and the Luminex MagPix instruments. Compared to real-time PCR, FLULUM tested on 259 specimens submitted in the 2010-2011 season showed sensitivities of 97.3% for FluA M, 90.5% for 2009 H1, 96.9% for H3, and 88.9% for FluB M. No specimens were positive for seasonal H1. FLULUM tested on 806 specimens submitted in the 2011-2012 season showed a sensitivity of 100% for FluA M, 89.9% for 2009 H1, 96.4% for H3, and 95.6% for FluB M. No cross-reactivity was observed for other respiratory viruses. Analytical sensitivity was assessed by testing dilutions of specimens with high viral loads. The limits of detection of FLULUM were comparable to those of the real-time PCR assay for FluA M, FluB M, and H3. The limits of detection for seasonal H1 and 2009 H1 were 10-fold higher for the FLULUM assay compared to real-time PCR. The FLULUM is an economic assay with high clinical sensitivity and specificity. It is particularly suited to high-volume detection of influenza viruses.","Munro, Sandra B; Kuypers, Jane; Jerome, Keith R",Journal of clinical microbiology,200,24

Feeding hens a supplemental linoleic acid (LA)-rich oil plus an oil rich in either SDA or ALA also attenuated egg yolk ALA and SDA contents (Experiment 1), or egg yolk and liver ALA contents (Experiment 2), respectively, as compared to feeding the SDA- or ALA-rich oils alone. Future work should focus on the lack of neutrality of OA and LA in relation to n-3 PUFA nutrition.","Elkin, Robert G; El-Zenary, Ahmed S A; Bomberger, Rebecca; Harvatine, Kevin J","Prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and essential fatty acids",200,31

METHOD From 2007 to 2009, a case-control study was conducted of 54 patients who underwent left colectomy with stapled anastomosis using the Chex stapler. The patients were matched to 64 patients in whom the anastomoses were performed using the CDH(®) stapler or the EEA(®) stapler. The following criteria were matched: sex, age, body mass index, American Society of Anesthesiology grade, diagnosis, formation of a temporary stoma and surgical approach. Primary end-points were postoperative mortality and morbidity. The surgeon was asked to fill out a questionnaire to assess the ergonomics of the device using an analogue visual scale. A cost analysis was performed to compare the cost of the different devices. RESULTS There were no postoperative deaths. Morbidity, including anastomotic leakage (9%vs 8%, P = 1.000), was similar in the two groups. The surgeon's overall appreciation was scored at 8.1/10 (3-9.5), including the best score for stapler removal (9.5). No major device failure was observed during the study. Mean surgical costs were significantly lower in the Chex group: € 903 ± 73 (885-1192) vs the control group € 971 ± 61 (956-1263) (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION This study suggests that colorectal anastomosis using the Chex circular stapler is safe and does not increase overall morbidity. In particular, this device did not have a higher rate of anastomotic leakage in our patients than more expensive models currently used in our hospital.","Maggiori, L; Bretagnol, F; Ferron, M; Chevalier, Y; Panis, Y",Colorectal disease : the official journal of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland,200,1

We explored how health centers across the U.S. are using tele-OUD in treatment as well as reasons for nonadoption. METHODS We used the 2018 SAMHSA Behavioral Health Treatment Services Locator database and literature review to create a sample of community mental health centers and federally qualified health centers with telemental health services. From this list of health centers, we ued maximum diversity sampling to identify and recruit health center leaders to participate in semistructured interviews. We used inductive and deductive approaches to develop site summaries. RESULTS Twenty-two health centers from 14 different states participated. Of these, 8 offered tele-OUD. Among centers with tele-OUD, medication management was the most common service provided via video. Typically, health centers offered telemedicine visits after an initial, in-person visit with a waivered (prescribing) provider. Some programs only offered counseling via telemedicine. Leading barriers to treatment that tele-OUD program representatives mentioned included regulations on the prescribing of controlled substances, including buprenorphine, and difficulties in sending lab results to distant (prescribing) providers. Nonadopters reported not offering tele-OUD due to regulations in controlled substance prescribing, complexities and regulatory barriers to offering group visits, and the belief that in-person OUD services were meeting patient need. CONCLUSIONS Tele-OUD is being deployed in a variety of ways. Describing current delivery models can inform strategies to promote and implement tele-OUD to combat the opioid epidemic.","Uscher-Pines, Lori; Raja, Pushpa; Mehrotra, Ateev; Huskamp, Haiden A",Journal of substance abuse treatment,200,12

The advantages of endoscopic power assisted adenoidectomy over cold steel adenoidectomy has been well established in the literature. As adenoidectomy is one of the most common paediatric surgical procedure there is always a concern to improve the outcomes and make postoperative experience more pleasant for the paediatric population. Cost difference between a coblator wand and microdebrider blade is always a confounding factor in decision making. The present study was conducted to compare both the techniques of adenoidectomy in terms of certain intraoperative and post operative parameters. The present study was a prospective randomized single blind study conducted in a university hospital on 140 subjects. The patients diagnosed with chronic adenoiditis grade 3-4 were randomly allocated in two groups after following the exclusion and inclusion criteria. the adenoidectomy in two groups; Microdebrider group and Coblation group were compared in terms of intraoperative time, post operative pain score; intraoperative bleeding, surgical field and some common complications. The data was analysed for significance by various statistical tests. The average adenoid size operated in both groups was Grade 3. The intraoperative time taken to complete the procedure in group A was 12.78 ± 3.8 min and in group B was 22 ± 3.3 min with p value < 0.05. There was statistically significant difference in grade of Intraoperative Bleeding in both groups with mean grade of intraoperative bleeding being 1.4 ± 1.04 in group B and 3.5 ± 0.9 in Group A. The surgical field was poor to average in 33 cases (n = 70) in group A as compared to only 1 case (n = 70) in group B; the difference being statistically significant. The average post-operative pain score was 2.69 ± 0.99 and 1.17 ± 1.1 after post-operatively 24 h and 72 h respectively in group B; 7.14 ± 0.99 and 4.08 ± 1.42 respectively in group A. The p value for the same was < 0.05. However there was no statistically significant difference between two groups in terms of any complications or completeness of removal. Though both the techniques are highly efficacious in adenoid removal and low complication rate in our study but still more studies with large sample size are encouraged to validate these results and establish the comparative efficacy of both the techniques in terms of the intraoperative parameters as well as post-operative recovery along with recurrence rates.","Singh, Jaskaran; Bhardwaj, Bhanu",Indian journal of otolaryngology and head and neck surgery : official publication of the Association of Otolaryngologists of India,200,7

The Dashboard reports live counts of the number and type of patients in each of the six adult metropolitan public EDs in Adelaide, South Australia.ResultsThere was a significant difference in the mean daily average occupied ED capacity before and during two distinct increases in COVID-19 cases in South Australia. An increase in COVID-19 cases coincided with a decrease in patients in EDs (Pearson's r=-0.93 and -0.67; P<0.001 for both). Presentations in Australasian Triage Scale (ATS) Categories 2-5 decreased during these periods, whereas ATS Category 1 stayed constant. Mental health patients continued to present to the ED, despite the overall drop in ED presentations.ConclusionsDuring the two periods of COVID-19 case growth in South Australia, there was a significant drop in the number of patients presenting to the major public EDs and a change in the casemix of patients over time.What is known about the topic?EDs in Australia often operate at or over capacity, with frequent reports of ambulance ramping, access block and long waiting times. There have been reports internationally of significant declines in ED presentations throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.What does this paper add?This paper uses a novel publicly available data source that is available in real time to contribute a new perspective from South Australia, which has experienced two distinct periods of strict restrictions and lockdown. The research showed that the number of mental health presentations remained consistently high, despite a significant overall decline in ED occupancy.What are the implications for practitioners?This study demonstrates that South Australians are accessing emergency medical treatment differently in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the context of an overall decline in presentation numbers, the number of mental health-related presentations has not changed significantly, suggesting that this trend should be closely monitored. The findings corroborate the national concern that unwell people have avoided accessing emergency medical care during the pandemic, leading to worse outcomes and increased need for healthcare resources at a later date. It will be important to monitor and quickly detect further changes in ED usage using real-time data as the pandemic evolves, as well as in any future significant health crises.","Boyle, Laura M; Mackay, Mark; Bean, Nigel; Roughan, Matthew",Australian health review : a publication of the Australian Hospital Association,200,31

The pathogenicity of SFTS virus (SFTSV) remains unclear. We intraperitoneally infected three groups of mice: wild-type (WT), mice treated with blocking anti-type I interferon (IFN)-α receptor antibody (IFNAR Ab), and IFNAR knockout (IFNAR-/-) mice, with four doses of SFTSV (KH1, 5 × 105 to 5 × 102 FAID50). The WT mice survived all SFTSV infective doses. The IFNAR Ab mice died within 7 days post-infection (dpi) with all doses of SFTSV except that the mice were infected with 5 × 102 FAID50 SFTSV. The IFNAR-/- mice died after infection with all doses of SFTSV within four dpi. No SFTSV infection caused hyperthermia in any mice, whereas all the dead mice showed hypothermia and weight loss. In the WT mice, SFTSV RNA was detected in the eyes, oral swabs, urine, and feces at 5 dpi. Similar patterns were observed in the IFNAR Ab and IFNAR-/- mice after 3 dpi, but not in feces. The IFNAR Ab mice showed viral shedding until 7 dpi. The SFTSV RNA loads were higher in organs of the IFNAR-/- mice compared to the other groups. Histopathologically, coagulation necrosis and mononuclear inflammatory cell infiltration in the liver and white pulp atrophy in the spleen were seen as the main lesions in the IFN signaling lacking mice. Immunohistochemically, SFTSV antigens were mainly detected in the marginal zone of the white pulp of the spleen in all groups of mice, but more viral antigens were observed in the spleen of the IFNAR-/- mice. Collectively, the IFN signaling-deficient mice were highly susceptible to SFTSV and more viral burden could be demonstrated in various excreta and organs of the mice when IFN signaling was inhibited.","Park, Seok-Chan; Park, Jun Young; Choi, Jin Young; Lee, Sung-Geun; Eo, Seong Kug; Oem, Jae-Ku; Tark, Dong-Seob; You, Myungjo; Yu, Do-Hyeon; Chae, Joon-Seok; Kim, Bumseok",Laboratory animal research,200,27

Its effectiveness has been proven for common clinical conditions in critical care such as cardiogenic pulmonary edema and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations. Since the first pioneering studies of noninvasive ventilation in critical care in the late 1980s, thousands of studies and articles have been published on this topic. Interestingly, some aspects remain controversial (e.g. its use in de-novo hypoxemic respiratory failure, role of sedation, self-induced lung injury). Moreover, the role of NIV has recently been questioned and reconsidered in light of the recent reports of new techniques such as high-flow oxygen nasal therapy. METHODS We conducted a survey among leading experts on NIV aiming to 1) identify a selection of 10 important articles on NIV in the critical care setting 2) summarize the reasons for the selection of each study 3) offer insights on the future for both clinical application and research on NIV. RESULTS The experts selected articles over a span of 26 years, more clustered in the last 15 years. The most voted article studied the role of NIV in acute exacerbation chronic pulmonary disease. Concerning the future of clinical applications for and research on NIV, most of the experts forecast the development of innovative new interfaces more adaptable to patients characteristics, the need for good well-designed large randomized controlled trials of NIV in acute ""de novo"" hypoxemic respiratory failure (including its comparison with high-flow oxygen nasal therapy) and the development of software-based NIV settings to enhance patient-ventilator synchrony. CONCLUSIONS The selection made by the experts suggests that some applications of NIV in critical care are supported by solid data (e.g. COPD exacerbation) while others are still waiting for confirmation. Moreover, the identified insights for the future would lead to improved clinical effectiveness, new comparisons and evaluation of its role in still ""lack of full evidence"" clinical settings.","Cortegiani, A; Russotto, V; Antonelli, M; Azoulay, E; Carlucci, A; Conti, G; Demoule, A; Ferrer, M; Hill, N S; Jaber, S; Navalesi, P; Pelosi, P; Scala, R; Gregoretti, C",BMC anesthesiology,200,1

To take advantage of this, many hypoxia-mimicking scaffolds have been prepared, yet the oxygen access state of implanted artificial small-diameter vascular grafts (SDVGs) has not been investigated. Therefore, the oxygen access state of electrospun PCL grafts implanted into rat abdominal arteries was assessed. The regions proximal to the lumen and abluminal surfaces of the graft walls were normoxic and only the interior of the graft walls was hypoxic. In light of this differential oxygen access state of the implanted grafts and the critical role of vascular regeneration on SDVG implantation success, we investigated whether modification of SDVGs with HIF-1α stabilizer dimethyloxalylglycine (DMOG) could achieve hypoxia-mimicking responses resulting in improving vascular regeneration throughout the entirety of the graft wall. Therefore, DMOG-loaded PCL grafts were fabricated by electrospinning, to support the sustained release of DMOG over two weeks. In vitro experiments indicated that DMOG-loaded PCL mats had significant biological advantages, including: promotion of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) proliferation, migration and production of pro-angiogenic factors; and the stimulation of M2 macrophage polarization, which in-turn promoted macrophage regulation of HUVECs migration and smooth muscle cells (SMCs) contractile phenotype. These beneficial effects were downstream of HIF-1α stabilization in HUVECs and macrophages in normoxic conditions. Our results indicated that DMOG-loaded PCL grafts improved endothelialization, contractile SMCs regeneration, vascularization and modulated the inflammatory reaction of grafts in abdominal artery replacement models, thus promoting vascular regeneration.","Rafique, Muhammad; Wei, Tingting; Sun, Qiqi; Midgley, Adam C; Huang, Ziqi; Wang, Ting; Shafiq, Muhammad; Zhi, Dengke; Si, Jianghua; Yan, Hongyu; Kong, Deling; Wang, Kai",Biomaterials,200,1

The disease COVID-19 is now spread worldwide and has tremendous socio-economic consequences. The origin of the virus can be reconstructed through epidemiological studies and, even more so, from genome comparisons. How the evolution of the virus and the transition to humans might have happened is the subject of much speculation. It is considered certain that the virus is of animal origin and very likely passed from bats to humans in a zoonotic event. An intermediate host was postulated, but many SARS-like bat viruses have the ability to infect human cells directly, which has been shown experimentally by scientists in the Wuhan Institute of Virology using collected specimens containing virus material from horseshoe bats. The propagation of SARS-like bat viruses in cell culture allowed experiments aimed at increasing the infectivity of the virus and adaptation to human cells. This article summarizes the unique properties of SARS-CoV-2 and focusses on a specific sequence encoding the spike protein. Possible scenarios of virus evolution are discussed, with particular emphasis on the hypothesis that the virus could have emerged unintentionally through routine culture or gain-of-function experiments in a laboratory, where it was optimally adapted to human cells and caused cryptic infections among workers who finally spread the virus causing the pandemic.","Kaina, Bernd",In vivo,200,20

The World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have recommended using the M gene as the diagnostic gene target for reverse-transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). However, M gene RT-PCR has reduced sensitivity for recent IAV due to novel gene mutations. Here, we sought to identify novel diagnostic targets for IAV RT-PCR assay using long-read third-generation sequencing. Direct nanopore sequencing from 18 nasopharyngeal specimens and one saliva specimen showed that the 5' and 3' ends of the PB2 gene and the entire NS gene were highly abundant. Primers selected for PB2 and NS genes were well-matched with seasonal or avian IAV gene sequences. Our novel PB2 and NS gene real-time RT-PCR assays showed similar or lower limit of detection than M gene RT-PCR, and achieved 100% sensitivity and specificity in the detection of A(H1N1) and A(H3N2), and A(H7N9) in nasopharyngeal and saliva specimens. For 10 patients with IAV M gene RT-PCR conversion in sequentially-collected specimens, NS and/or PB2 gene RT-PCR was positive in 2 (20%) initial specimens that were missed by M gene RT-PCR. In conclusion, we have shown that PB2 or NS gene RT-PCRs are suitable alternatives to the recommended M gene RT-PCR for diagnosis of IAV.

However, little is known about the role of Coronin 3 in glioma tumorigenesis. Here, we aimed to explore the biological function and regulatory mechanism of Coronin 3 in glioblastoma (GBM). Materials and Methods Coronin 3 level in human GBM clinical samples and cell lines was investigated. The shRNA knockdown strategy was used to assess the tumor characteristics of GBM cell lines. The role of β-catenin in Coronin 3-mediated oncogenic phenotypes was evaluated. Results Coronin 3 was found to be highly upregulated in glioma cell lines. Furthermore, knockdown of Coronin 3 significantly inhibited the growth of glioma cells both in vivo and in vitro and suppressed the expression of Wnt/β-catenin pathway genes, including β-catenin, Cyclin D1, and c-Myc. Moreover, we demonstrated that Coronin 3 regulates the expression of β-catenin in glioma. Our results revealed that Coronin 3-stimulated tumor growth was β-catenin-dependent.

To evaluate the potential infection risk of 2019-nCoV on ocular surface, we compared ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression among different eye tissues. Methods: Experimental article. Thirty mice were assigned to male, female, aging, diabetic and non-diabetic groups, with 6 mice in each group. Real-time PCR was performed to quantify ACE2 and TMPRSS2 gene expression in conjunctiva, cornea, lacrimal gland, iris, lens, retina, lung, heart, kidney, and liver from male mice. Immunohistochemistry staining was applied to visualize the distribution of the two proteins in different mice tissues, and in human corneal and conjunctival sections. Published transcriptome datasets were extracted to generate the expression comparasion of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 between human conjunctival and corneal tissues, and results were analyzed with Mann-Whitney U test. Female mice, aging mice, STZ-induced diabetic mice, diabetic group control mice were also subjected to ACE2 expression analysis. Results were analyzed using Student's t-test. Results: The expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genes were the highest in conjunctiva among all the six mice eye tissues explored. The expression of these two genes in conjunctiva were lower than that in kidney and lung. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 shared similar expression pattern with the staining concentrated in corneal epithelium, conjunctival epithelium and lacrimal gland serous cells. The expression levels of ACE2 showed sex-difference. Female mice had lower ACE2 in conjunctiva and cornea than male mice, with the expression levels taking only 43% (t=3.269, P=0.031) and 63% (t=4.080, P=0.015) of that in the male conjunctiva and cornea, respectively. Diabetic mice expressed more ACE2 in conjunctiva (1.21-fold, P>0.05) and lacrimal gland (1.10-fold, P>0.05) compared with the control group. No significant difference on ACE2 expression was found between the aging and young adult mice. The expression level of human conjunctiva ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were significantly higher than that in the cornea (P=0.007), with 5.74-fold and 12.84-fold higher in the conjunctiva than in the corneal epithelium cells, which resembled the situation in mice. Conclusion: The observation of high-level ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression in conjunctiva among the 6 eye tissues examined suggests that conjunctiva serves as an infection target tissue of 2019-nCoV.

The review will specifically discuss the latest clinical trial findings, technological advancements in ablation modalities and expert guidelines for patient eligibility. Novel therapeutic applications beyond blood pressure (BP) control will also be discussed. RECENT FINDINGS Follow-up data from the Symplicity Clinical Trials Program provides further evidence for the safety of the procedure and substantiates a sustained reduction in BP in most patients with resistant hypertension. Recently published expert consensus statements recommend that only patients with resistant hypertension should undergo the procedure at this stage. Several alternative treatment modalities for renal denervation have been developed to improve efficacy, procedure time and safety. Initial findings suggest comparable BP reductions amongst technical approaches. Several pilot studies, although predominantly uncontrolled, indicate additional benefits of renal sympathetic nerve ablation on regression of hypertensive end-organ damage, heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias and other disturbances commonly associated with resistant hypertension. SUMMARY Catheter-based renal nerve ablation is emerging as a well tolerated, effective and cost-effective treatment to control BP in patients with resistant hypertension. Further studies are required to determine the long-term impact of this novel therapeutic option.","Thorp, Alicia A; Larsen, Robyn N; Schlaich, Markus P",Current opinion in nephrology and hypertension,200,1

In addition, the emergence of highly potent synthetic opioids such as fentanyl and carfentanil increases the need to protect workers who may encounter unknown drug substances during job activities. To support the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health Opioids Research Gaps Working Group, we examined the state of the literature concerning methods to protect workers against accidental occupational exposure to illicit opioids, and have identified unmet research needs concerning personal protective equipment, decontamination methods, and engineering controls. Additional studies are needed to overcome gaps in technical knowledge about personal protective equipment, decontamination, and control methods, and gaps in understanding how these measures are utilized by workers. Increasing our knowledge of how to protect against exposure to illicit opioids has the potential to improve occupational health across communities.","Basham, Casey; Cerles, Audrey; Rush, Margaret; Alexander-Scott, Marissa; Greenawald, Lee; Chiu, Sophia; Broadwater, Kendra; Hirst, Deborah; Snawder, John; Roberts, Jennifer; Weber, Angela; Knuth, Martha; Casagrande, Rocco",New solutions : a journal of environmental and occupational health policy : NS,200,20

METHODS Patients with symptomatic malignant CAO undergoing various therapeutic bronchoscopy procedures were assessed for symptomatic and functional improvement using the Speiser Score, spirometry, 6-minute walk distance (6MWD), and St. George Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) up to 3 months after the procedures. RESULTS A total of 83 intervention procedures were performed in 65 patients, comprising 43 (66.2%) male individuals [overall mean age, 52.4; SD, 15.4 y]. The majority of these (92.3%) was done using rigid bronchoscope under general anesthesia. Airway stenting was the most common intervention performed (56.6%), followed by mechanical debulking (26.5%), cryodebulking (6%), electrosurgical removal (4.8%), balloon dilatation (3.6%), and laser ablation (2.4%).A total of 15 complications (18.1%) were noted. Of these, 8 (53.3%) were early complications and 7 (46.7%) were late complications. Early complications included airway bleeding, hypoxia, vocal cord injury, laryngeal injury, and pneumothorax. Late complications included significant granulation tissue formation in metallic stents and lung collapse because of mucus plug.The survival rates at 4, 8, and 12 weeks were 83%, 70.7%, and 66.1%, respectively. Significant improvement was observed in dyspnea, cough, Speiser Score, 6MWD, forced expiratory volume in 1 s, forced vital capacity, and SGRQ scores at 48 hours, 4 weeks, and at 12 weeks after the procedures and no procedure-related mortality occurred. CONCLUSION Various therapeutic bronchoscopic interventions, including combined modalities, provide rapid and sustained improvements in symptoms, respiratory status, exercise capacity, and quality of life in malignant CAO and have a good safety profile.","Mohan, Anant; Shrestha, Prajowl; Madan, Karan; Hadda, Vijay; Pandey, Ravindra M; Upadhyay, Ashish; Khilnani, Gopi C; Guleria, Randeep",Journal of bronchology & interventional pulmonology,200,17

In the study we analysed the comparison and agreement between the feasibility of using the saliva in comparison to NPS for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. METHODS A total number of 74 patients were enrolled for this study. We analysed and compared the NPS and saliva specimen collected within 48 h after the symptom onset. We carried out real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), gene sequencing for the detection and determination SARS-CoV-2 specific genes. Phylogenetic tree was constructed to establish the isolation of viral RNA from saliva. We used Bland-Altman model to identify the agreement between two specimens. RESULTS This study showed a lower cycle threshold (CT ) mean value for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 ORF1 gene (mean 27.07; 95% CI, 25.62 to 28.52) in saliva methods than that of NPS (mean 28.24; 95% CI, 26.62 to 29.85) specimen although the difference is statistically non-significant (p>0.05). Bland-Altman analysis produced relatively smaller bias and high agreement between these two clinical specimens. Phylogenetic analysis with the RdRp and S gene confirmed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the saliva samples.

This case highlighted the importance of close coordination between Chinese medicine and western medicine in the diagnosis and treatment, as well as the need for rapid dissemination of clinical information related to patient care with this emerging infection. We reported a COVID-19 case confirmed in China and described the identification, diagnosis, clinical course, and management of the case. The patient had initial mild symptoms at presentation; it progressed to severe pneumonia on the 10th day of onset. This cured case supplied a time series analysis of tongue characteristics found in severe COVID-19. Chinese medicine formulae were tweaked by tongue characteristics, which include tongue color, fur thickness, and fur color. Tongue images were obtained every two days, and the changes were firmly related to the progression of COVID-19. These tongue characteristics could be used as effective, non-intrusive indices for the distinct stages of COVID-19 stages. Our study was the first time tongue diagnosis was applied in time series analysis of the progression of COVID-19 disease. We found that tongue color, fur thickness, and fur color were closely related to the progression of COVID-19 by analyzing various tongue images obtained regularly. Based on this success, we will further apply tongue diagnosis to tongue characteristics of COVID-19 patients to help limit the risk of COVID-19.","Liang, Keji; Huang, Xiaodan; Chen, Hua; Qiu, Liling; Zhuang, Yanshan; Zou, Chuan; Bai, Yunpeng; Huang, Yisheng",Annals of palliative medicine,200,31

DESIGN Respondents aged 15-24 years (n=3536) were drawn from a repeated cross-sectional online panel survey (222 participants/week) during an e-cigarette/vaping-associated lung injury (EVALI) outbreak in the USA (September 2019-January 2020). Logistic regression models tested for associations between EVALI awareness and perceived lung injury risk and product harm, stratified by e-cigarette/vape use and controlling for awareness of other e-cigarette/vaping news stories, demographic characteristics and outbreak week. Other models measured the association between perceived risk of lung injury and intentions to use (non-users) or intentions to quit (current users) e-cigarettes/vape products. Changes in national retail e-cigarette sales data were examined during national EVALI outbreak reporting. RESULTS EVALI awareness was associated with: perceived risk of lung injury (current users OR 1.59, p=0.004; non-users OR 2.11, p<0.001); belief that e-cigarettes/vapes contain dangerous chemicals (current users OR 1.47, p=0.017; non-users OR 1.88, p<0.001) and belief that e-cigarettes/vapes are harmful (current users OR 1.66, p=0.002; non-users OR 1.67, p<0.001). Perceived risk of lung injury from e-cigarette/vape use was associated with intentions to own e-cigarette/vape products (ever-users OR 0.25, p<0.001; never-users OR 0.61, p=0.004) and intentions to quit among current users (OR 2.02, p=0.002). Declines in e-cigarette sales were observed following news of the EVALI outbreak. CONCLUSIONS News of vaping-attributable health conditions may prevent e-cigarette/vape use and encourage cessation among young people.

83733,83733,83733,Incidence of respiratory pathogens in persons hospitalized with pneumonia in two provinces in Thailand.,13.20708,9.547143,2010,"UNLABELLED Several members of the Arenaviridae can cause acute febrile diseases in humans, often resulting in lethality. The use of convalescent-phase human plasma is an effective treatment in humans infected with arenaviruses, particularly species found in South America. Despite this, little work has focused on developing potent and defined immunotherapeutics against arenaviruses. In the present study, we produced arenavirus neutralizing antibodies by DNA vaccination of rabbits with plasmids encoding the full-length glycoprotein precursors of Junín virus (JUNV), Machupo virus (MACV), and Guanarito virus (GTOV). Geometric mean neutralizing antibody titers, as measured by the 50% plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT(50)), exceeded 5,000 against homologous viruses. Antisera against each targeted virus exhibited limited cross-species binding and, to a lesser extent, cross-neutralization. Anti-JUNV glycoprotein rabbit antiserum protected Hartley guinea pigs from lethal intraperitoneal infection with JUNV strain Romero when the antiserum was administered 2 days after challenge and provided some protection (∼30%) when administered 4 days after challenge. Treatment starting on day 6 did not protect animals. We further formulated an IgG antibody cocktail by combining anti-JUNV, -MACV, and -GTOV antibodies produced in DNA-vaccinated rabbits. This cocktail protected 100% of guinea pigs against JUNV and GTOV lethal disease. We then expanded on this cocktail approach by simultaneously vaccinating rabbits with a combination of plasmids encoding glycoproteins from JUNV, MACV, GTOV, and Sabia virus (SABV). Sera collected from rabbits vaccinated with the combination vaccine neutralized all four targets. These findings support the concept of using a DNA vaccine approach to generate a potent pan-arenavirus immunotherapeutic. IMPORTANCE Arenaviruses are an important family of emerging viruses. In infected humans, convalescent-phase plasma containing neutralizing antibodies can mitigate the severity of disease caused by arenaviruses, particularly species found in South America. Because of variations in potency of the human-derived product, limited availability, and safety concerns, this treatment option has essentially been abandoned. Accordingly, despite this approach being an effective postinfection treatment option, research on novel approaches to produce potent polyclonal antibody-based therapies have been deficient. Here we show that DNA-based vaccine technology can be used to make potently neutralizing antibodies in rabbits that exclusively target the glycoproteins of several human-pathogenic arenaviruses found in South America, including JUNV, MACV, GTOV, and SABV. These antibodies protected guinea pigs from lethal disease when given post-virus challenge. We also generated a purified antibody cocktail with antibodies targeting three arenaviruses and demonstrated protective efficacy against all three targets. Our findings demonstrate that use of the DNA vaccine technology could be used to produce candidate antiarenavirus neutralizing antibody-based products.","Golden, Joseph W; Maes, Piet; Kwilas, Steven A; Ballantyne, John; Hooper, Jay W",Journal of virology,200,20

We systematically determined how adherence to maintenance therapy is assessed in clinical trials of ""add-on"" therapy for severe asthma. We model the improvement in trial power that could be achieved by accurately assessing adherence.A systematic search of six major databases identified randomised trials of add-on therapy for severe asthma. The relationship between measuring adherence and study outcomes was assessed. An estimate of potential improvements in statistical power and sample size was derived using digitally recorded adherence trial data.87 randomised controlled trials enrolling 22 173 participants were included. Adherence assessment was not reported in 67 trials (n=13 931, 63%). Studies that reported adherence used a range of self-report and subjective methods. None of the studies employed an objective assessment of adherence. Studies that reported adherence had a significantly reduced pooled variance in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) compared to those that did not assess adherence: s2=0.144 L2 versus s2=0.168 L2, p<0.0001. Power to detect clinically relevant changes in FEV1 was significantly higher in trials that reported adherence assessment (mean power achieved 59% versus 49%). Modelling suggests that up to 50% of variance in FEV1 outcomes is attributable to undetected variations in adherence. Controlling for such variations could potentially halve the required sample size.Few trials of add-on therapy monitor adherence to maintenance inhaled therapy, resulting in a greater variance in trial outcomes and inadequate power for determining efficacy.","Mokoka, Matshediso C; McDonnell, Melissa J; MacHale, Elaine; Cushen, Breda; Boland, Fiona; Cormican, Sarah; Doherty, Christina; Doyle, Frank; Costello, Richard W; Greene, Garrett",The European respiratory journal,200,16

The REFLECT rubric (Wald et al. 2012) was developed to address the challenge of assessing these written reflections. The objective of this replication work is to explore the reproducibility of the reliability characteristics presented by the REFLECT developers. METHODS Five raters evaluated narratives written by medical students and experienced clinicians using the REFLECT rubric. Reliability across rubric domains was determined via intraclass correlation coefficient and internal consistency was determined via Cronbach's alpha. RESULTS Intraclass coefficients demonstrated poor reliability for ratings across all tool criteria (0.350-0.452) including overall ratings of narratives (0.448). Moreover, the internal consistency between scale items was also poor across all criteria (0.529-0.621). DISCUSSION We did not replicate the reliability characteristics presented in the original REFLECT article. We consider these findings with respect to the contextual differences that existed between our study and the Wald and colleagues study, pointing particularly at the possible influence that repetitive testing and refinement of the tool may have had on their reviewers' shared understanding of its use.

METHODS We compared 23 patients undergoing needle-assisted LESS-A with 29 patients undergoing conventional LESS-A at Hiroshima University Hospital between November 2009 and February 2014. Needle-assisted LESS-A was performed using a MiniLap instrument (Stryker, San Jose, CA, USA). We used this instrument to protectively retract the liver at the right side of the tumor and the spleen at the left side by grasping with a Securea endoscopic surgical spacer (Hogy Medical Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Various parameters including insufflation time, estimated blood loss, pain scale, resumption of oral intake, transfusion rate, and complications were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS In all cases, LESS-A was completed successfully with no major intraoperative complications. Patients in both treatment groups had similar age, body mass index, sex, and laterality. Significantly, needle-assisted LESS-A was performed using the transumbilical approach rather than the subcostal approach. The insufflation time of the needle-assisted LESS-A was shorter than that of the conventional LESS-A (p = 0.0335). No patients required intraoperative or postoperative blood transfusions. Retrospective design and the small sample size are main limitations of this study.

State-of-the-art stabilization techniques are tension band wiring (TBW) using Kirschner wires or cannulated screws. These techniques are associated with high rates of secondary fracture displacement, implant migration, implant prominence, wound-healing disturbances, and the need for implant removal. Recently, a locked intraosseous patellar nail prototype was developed. The aim of the present study was to investigate the biomechanical performance of this nail compared with TBW using cannulated screws. METHODS Seven paired fresh-frozen human cadaveric knees were stripped of all soft tissues except the extensor apparatus. A transverse osteotomy was created to simulate an OTA/AO type 34-C1 transverse patellar fracture. The specimen pairs were randomly assigned to be fixed with TBW using cannulated screws or with the new intraosseous nail. Each specimen was cyclically tested for 5,000 cycles by pulling on the quadriceps tendon and simulating active knee extension and passive knee flexion within the range from 90° of flexion to full knee extension. Anterior and articular margin displacement of the fracture as well as interfragmentary rotation around the mediolateral axis were investigated with optical motion tracking after 100, 500, 1,000, 2,500, and 5,000 test cycles. RESULTS Within the respective 5 testing-cycle time points evaluated, the articular margin displaced on average 68%, 60%, 72%, 76%, and 81% less after intraosseous nailing compared with TBW. Whereas the difference remained nonsignificant after 100 and 500 cycles (p ≥ 0.116), a trend toward significance was observed after 1,000 cycles (p = 0.063), which became significant after 2,500 and 5,000 cycles (p ≤ 0.043). CONCLUSIONS From a biomechanical point of view, the locked intraosseous patellar nail may be an alternative to TBW using cannulated screws because of the higher interfragmentary stability provided at the articular fracture site. CLINICAL RELEVANCE A locked patellar nail for transverse patellar fractures achieved a stable osteosynthetic construct that may reduce hardware-associated complications because of its intraosseous positioning.","Nienhaus, Michael; Zderic, Ivan; Wahl, Dieter; Gueorguiev, Boyko; Rommens, Pol Maria",The Journal of bone and joint surgery.

This scoping review examines how social support has been conceptualized, operationalized, and studied among siblings of children with cancer. Gaps in the current literature are identified, and future research directions are proposed. METHODS A rigorous systematic scoping review framework guided our process. Medline, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Scopus were searched for literature regarding social support and siblings of children with cancer. After screening, 57 articles were identified (n = 26 quantitative, n = 21 qualitative, and n = 10 multi-method) and their content extracted for summarization. RESULTS The majority of studies (n = 43, 75.4%) were descriptive; 14 (24.6%) included interventions, and of those, four were experimental. Few studies used a clearly defined theoretical framework, or validated tools to measure social support. Studies explored perceived social support needs of siblings, the provision and availability of formal support through interventions and related outcomes, and informal family social supports. A variety of support types were found to be helpful to siblings in different ways. CONCLUSIONS Social support is a prevalent topic in the literature regarding siblings of children with cancer. It is unclear what types of support are most important due to how it has been conceptualized and measured. Despite some methodological limitations, greater levels of social support have been linked to better adaptation among siblings of children with cancer. Future work is warranted to identify the most beneficial types of support for siblings based on their age, developmental stage, and the cancer trajectory.","Wawrzynski, Sarah E; Schaefer, Megan R; Schvaneveldt, Nena; Alderfer, Melissa A",Psycho-oncology,200,25

Despite the frequency with which this scale is used in the scientific literature, there is still relatively little evidence regarding the predictive validity of this important instrument. This current research introduces a construct capable of improving the ability of the scale to predict pornography consumption (meta-cognitive certainty). METHOD Over two studies, participants completed the PPUS and the meta-cognitive certainty in their responses to the scale was measured (Study 1) or manipulated (Study 2). Self-reported porn consumption was the criterion measure in both studies, with an additional actual overt behavior relevant to consumption of porn included in Study 2. RESULTS As expected, the PPUS significantly predicted porn consumption, confirming the predictive validity of the scale. More importantly, meta-cognitive certainty was capable of moderating the extent to which scores on the PPUS could predict porn consumption, with greater consistency between the PPUS and reported behavior from those with high (vs. low) meta-cognitive certainty. CONCLUSIONS These data suggest that considering meta-cognitive certainty may be useful for predicting when the link between the PPUS and porn consumption is stronger.","Paredes, Borja; Martínez, Luz; Cuesta, Ubaldo; Briñol, Pablo; Petty, Richard; Moreno, Lorena",Psicothema,200,1

OBJECTIVES To describe the foramen epiploicum mesh closure (FEMC) technique through a ventral midline laparotomy in horses under general anaesthesia and its outcome. STUDY DESIGN Terminal surgical experiment and in vivo study. METHODS In a pilot study, a standard ventral midline laparotomy was performed under general anaesthesia in 10 experimental horses and a three-dimensional expandable diabolo-shaped mesh construct was manually introduced through the EF into the omental vestibule. The laparotomy incision was routinely closed after which the horses were subjected to euthanasia. Subsequently, the cadavers were extensively manipulated and finally mesh position was verified during necropsy. Thereafter, a ventral midline laparotomy, with simulation of abdominal manipulations during colic surgery was performed on six experimental horses. A three-dimensional expandable diabolo-shaped mesh with a radiological marker was introduced as in the pilot study. Clinical and laboratory parameters were recorded during the post-operative period. Four weeks after the intervention, abdominal radiography and laparoscopy were performed in all six horses. RESULTS Insertion of all 16 diabolo-shaped mesh constructs during laparotomy was uneventful. The 10 mesh constructs of the pilot study were positioned correctly at necropsy. No post-operative clinical or laboratory parameter alterations were noticed in the other six horses, apart from a transient leucocytosis and an increase in serum amyloid A. Abdominal radiography at 4 weeks revealed consistent positioning of the mesh marker. Laparoscopy confirmed that all six EFs were closed, without intestinal adhesions. MAIN LIMITATIONS Mesh insertion in clinical cases and during clean contaminated surgery was not investigated. CONCLUSION The FEMC technique via laparotomy provides a fast, simple and reliable procedure to obliterate the EF and may be useful during EFE surgery to prevent recurrence of the disease, avoiding a subsequent laparoscopic procedure.","van Bergen, T; Rötting, A; Wiemer, P; Schauvliege, S; Vanderperren, K; Ugahary, F; Martens, A",Equine veterinary journal,200,1

One of these is the failure of the proteostasis network (PN), which includes all components involved in the synthesis, folding, and degradation of proteins, thus leading to the aberrant accumulation of toxic protein aggregates in neurons. The single components that belong to the three main modules of the PN are highly interconnected and can be considered as part of a single giant network. Several pharmacological strategies have been proposed to ameliorate neurodegeneration by targeting PN components. Nevertheless, effective disease-modifying therapies are still lacking. In this review article, after a general description of the PN and its failure in proteinopathies, we will focus on the available pharmacological tools to target proteostasis. In this context, we will discuss the main advantages of systems-based pharmacology in contrast to the classical targeted approach, by focusing on network pharmacology as a strategy to innovate rational drug design.","Lualdi, Marta; Alberio, Tiziana; Fasano, Mauro",International journal of molecular sciences,200,1

Here we show the dynamics of seroprevalence in an 'urgent care' (UC) group, enriched for COVID-19 cases during the epidemic, and a 'routine care' group (RC), which more closely represents the general population. Seroprevalence increased at different rates in both groups, with seropositive samples as early as mid-February, and levelled out at slightly above 20% in both groups after the epidemic wave subsided by the end of May. From May to July seroprevalence stayed stable, suggesting lasting antibody levels in the population.

Objectives: To summarize our 13-year experience in the design of multipedicle pre-expanded perforator flaps for extensive head and neck defect reconstruction, with vascular supercharge and flap prefabrication, either solely or in combination. To discuss the strategy for judicious selection between these techniques in the design of multipedicle flaps at different donor sites. Design, Setting, and Participants: A retrospective study was performed in patients with severe head and neck deformities and treated with multipedicle pre-expanded perforator flaps between May 2005 and May 2018. Intraoperative indocyanine green angiography was utilized for visualization of flap perfusion and analysis of the hemodynamics of pre-existing perforator and prefabricated vessels. Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcomes measured were (1) features of deformities, (2) multipedicle flap designs, and (3) postoperative complications and long-term functional and aesthetic outcomes. Results: Seventy-five multipedicle pre-expanded perforator flaps were harvested, including 44 supercharged, 26 prefabricated, and 5 tripedicle, combining both techniques, with sizes ranging from 22 × 12 to 45 × 27 cm2. Hemodynamic analysis demonstrated slower arterial inflow (0.60 ± 0.29 U/s vs. 2.65 ± 1.29 U/s, p < 0.05) and venous outflow (0.10 U/s vs. 0.23 ± 0.11 U/s) in prefabricated vessels, compared to the pre-existing perforator, namely the internal mammary arterial perforator. Partial necroses were observed in three patients with only one requiring skin grafting. The aesthetic and functional outcomes were satisfying after reconstruction. Conclusions and Relevance: Multipedicle pre-expanded perforator flaps fabricated by vascular supercharge and flap prefabrication, either solely or in combination in various donor sites, are powerful reconstructive tools for extensive head and neck defects. For a more reliable design, vascular supercharging should be considered a priority strategy, and flap prefabrication an alternative when suitable supercharging vessels are unavailable.","Zan, Tao; Li, Haizhou; Huang, Xin; Gao, Yashan; Gu, Bin; Pu, Lee L Q; Xu, Xiangwen; Gu, Shuchen; Khoong, Yimin; Li, Qingfeng",Facial plastic surgery & aesthetic medicine,200,17

While clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of BLT in ameliorating depression for outpatients, studies examining BLT in the psychiatric inpatient setting are currently lacking. AIM The purpose of this study is to explore whether BLT as adjunctive treatment for depressive symptoms on an acute psychiatric floor is feasible and explore associated changes in depressive symptoms. METHODS An observational, cross-sectional study was conducted at State University of New York (SUNY) Upstate 4B acute inpatient psychiatric unit. BLT was administered to participating patients as adjunctive therapy to their psychopharmacological and psychotherapy treatments on a daily basis throughout their hospitalization. Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D), and Outcome Questionnaire-45.2 (OQ-45.2) were administered before commencing BLT and after their last BLT session. Changes to the aforementioned measures before and after BLT treatment, the dose response of measure changes based on number of sessions, and the hospital length of stay along with the secondary factors such as age, gender, other psychiatric comorbidities, social factors, and psychiatric medications were analyzed. RESULTS BLT is feasible on acute psychiatric inpatient floor with adherence of 94% and has very few side effects. The repeated measures of depression and functioning demonstrated significant decrease in depression and improvement in functioning. Although not statistically significant, clinical meaningful dose-response relationship was found between a number of BLT sessions and improvement in depressive symptoms with five BLT sessions being an optimal amount for depression amelioration. CONCLUSION BLT combined with the ongoing psychopharmacological treatment was well tolerated and easy to administer. It offers a simple, safe, and cost-effective approach to augmenting depressive treatment on an acute psychiatric floor.","Trinh, Alisa; Jain, Pratik; Sabahath, Shaikh; Wang, Dongliang; Megna, James L; Leontieva, Luba",Cureus,200,16

One of the most prominent stimuli that provoke knee pain is movement. Research suggests that compared to White Americans, AAs report significantly higher movement-evoked pain (MEP) in the knee. However, little is known about the biopsychosocial-behavioral mechanisms underlying MEP. OBJECTIVES To present a study protocol to (a) characterize the biopsychosocial-behavioral mechanisms that predict MEP in AAs with knee osteoarthritis, and (b) develop a targeted, mechanism-based, self-management intervention to reduce MEP and maximize movement. METHODS An observational, mixed-methods cohort study will enroll 90 AA/Black adults (ages 55-90) to understand intra-individual and interindividual effects on MEP. Participants will complete assessments of MEP, function and gait, biopsychosocial-behavioral questionnaires, quantitative sensory testing, and 7-day ecological momentary assessments of pain and related symptoms. For the qualitative phase, focus groups will be conducted to co-construct a mechanism-based, pain self-management intervention. RESULTS We will develop phenotypes of MEP based on biopsychosocial-behavioral predictors and correlate measures of MEP with function. Our central hypothesis is that higher levels of MEP will predict lower self-reported function and poorer performance on functional tasks and multiple biopsychosocial and behavioral factors will be associated with MEP and function. Predictors may serve as risk or protective factors for MEP and physical function. In targeting the biopsychosocial-behavioral mechanisms of MEP, we anticipate that older AAs may request that intervention components include culturally tailored self-management education, movement/physical activity training, treatment decision-making skills, coaching, spirituality, and social/kinship support. CONCLUSION Osteoarthritis is now the single most common cause of disability, mobility limitations, and persistent pain in older adults-especially AA older adults. To our knowledge, this will be the first study to systematically phenotype MEP in an older racial minority population with knee osteoarthritis and will be relevant for reducing knee pain and improving function.","Booker, Staja Q; Starkweather, Angela; Manini, Todd M; Staud, Roland; Fillingim, Roger B",Nursing research,200,1

We fit Cox proportional hazard models to examine the relationship between C-reactive protein (CRP) and fibrinogen with cancer mortality. RESULTS In the full Cox multivariate model, clinically raised CRP was associated with cancer mortality in NHANES 1988-1994 (> 0.99 mg/dL: 95%CI: 1.04-2.13). However, across two inflammatory biomarkers (CRP and Fibrinogen), two NHANES time periods (1998-1994 and 1999-2002) and three income levels (12 strata in total), Hazard ratio confidence intervals did not include the null only for one association: CRP and cancer mortality among low income participants from 1988 to 1994 (HR = 1.83, 95% CI: 1.10-3.04).

SARS-CoV-2 enters the cell by binding to the ACE II receptor and begins viral replication. The effects and clinical findings of SARS-CoV-2 on the liver, kidney, heart, gastrointestinal (GI) system and especially lungs have been widely discussed. However, the effects on the pancreas-another organ that also expresses ACE II-have not been studied. METHODS This work prospectively evaluated data from 316 patients who were admitted with a diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. The patients were categorized into three according to the severity of pneumonia (mild, severe, critical). Demographic data, rate of pancreatitis, biochemical parameters, and radiological images from each group were analyzed. The patients were divided into two groups and outcomes were compared: COVID-19 patients with acute pancreatitis (Group P) and without acute pancreatitis (Group C). RESULTS The median age was 54 (18-87), and the median age for patients with acute pancreatitis was 55 (26-84). As an expected finding, we found a positive correlation between advanced age and mortality (p = 0.0003). 12.6% of the patients had acute pancreatitis. While pancreatitis was not seen in patients on mild status, the rate of pancreatitis was 32.5% in critical patients. Hospitalization and mortality rates were higher in patients with COVID-19 accompanied by acute pancreatitis (p = 0.0038 and p < 0.0001, respectively). C-Reactive Protein (CRP) and ferritin were significantly higher in those who had pancreatitis (p < 0.0001). D-Dimer and procalcitonin levels had only a small difference (p = 0.1127 and p = 0.3403, respectively). CONCLUSION Acute pancreatitis alone is a clinical condition that can lead to mortality and may be one of the reasons for the exaggerated immune response developing in the progression of COVID-19. Our results point out that the presence of pancreatic damage triggered by SARS-CoV-2 can deteriorate the clinical condition of patients and the mortality rate may increase in these patients.","Akarsu, Cevher; Karabulut, Mehmet; Aydin, Husnu; Sahbaz, Nuri Alper; Dural, Ahmet Cem; Yegul, Duygu; Peker, Kivanc Derya; Ferahman, Sina; Bulut, Sezer; Dönmez, Turgut; Asar, Sinan; Yasar, Kadriye Kart; Adas, Gokhan Tolga",Journal of investigative surgery : the official journal of the Academy of Surgical Research,200,14

Here, we show Interferon Regulatory Factor 1 (IRF1), 3, and 7 levels are elevated in most bat tissues and that, basally, IRFs contribute to the expression of type I IFN ligands and high expression of interferon regulated genes (IRGs). CRISPR knockout (KO) of IRF 1/3/7 in cells reveals distinct subsets of genes affected by each IRF in an IFN-ligand signaling-dependent and largely independent manner. As the master regulators of innate immunity, the IRFs control the kinetics and maintenance of the IRG response and play essential roles in response to influenza A virus (IAV), herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), Melaka virus/Pteropine orthoreovirus 3 Melaka (PRV3M), and Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection. With its differential expression in bats compared to that in humans, this highlights a critical role for basal IRF expression in viral responses and potentially immune cell development in bats with relevance for IRF function in human biology.","Irving, Aaron T; Zhang, Qian; Kong, Pui-San; Luko, Katarina; Rozario, Pritisha; Wen, Ming; Zhu, Feng; Zhou, Peng; Ng, Justin H J; Sobota, Radoslaw M; Wang, Lin-Fa",Cell reports,200,1

Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of enteral antiplatelet agents are affected and variable due to erratic enteral absorption in end-stage heart failure and VAD circulation. Additionally, 20%-40% of the population are poor metabolizers of clopidogrel, a prodrug, making cangrelor an alternative when antiplatelet therapy is crucial. Cangrelor has been used effectively and safely for short durations in adults during percutaneous coronary interventions, but the use of cangrelor is still under investigation in pediatrics. This case series utilized cangrelor, a novel short-acting, reversible, intravenous P2Y12 platelet inhibitor in managing pediatric patients supported with a VAD. We performed a retrospective, single-center review of patients admitted to a tertiary medical center with end-stage heart failure requiring mechanical circulatory support and concomitant cangrelor administration between January 2019 and March 2020. Platelet function testing, cangrelor dose, bleeding complications, thromboembolic events, and frequency of circuit interventions during the use of cangrelor were recorded. Optimal platelet reactivity, defined as P2Y12 < 180 platelet reaction units (PRU), was measured with serial point-of-care testing (VerifyNow). Seven patients, median age of 4.9 years, met the above criteria. Three patients had a diagnosis of complex congenital heart disease. Four patients had dilated or restrictive cardiomyopathy. All patients were on continuous flow VADs. The median VAD duration was 84.5 days (IQR 61.5-103). The median duration on cangrelor was 43 days (IQR 8-70). The median cangrelor dose to reach the therapeutic threshold was 0.75 μg/kg/min with the mean P2Y12, while on cangrelor of 164.75 PRU. Bleeding complications included mild gastrointestinal bleeding and hematuria. There was one patient with pump thrombosis requiring intervention. There were no cerebrovascular events while on cangrelor. We report the first successful long-term use of cangrelor in pediatric patients. The reversibility and short half-life of cangrelor make it a feasible antiplatelet agent in selected patients. This data supports the use of cangrelor in children as a viable antiplatelet option; with minimal bleeding complications and no cerebrovascular events demonstrated in this cohort.","Fahnhorst, Sarah E; Beasley, Gary; Goldberg, Jason F; Martinez, Hugo R; Ryan, Kaitlin A; Towbin, Jeffrey A; Boston, Umar; Absi, Mohammed",Artificial organs,200,1

In contrast to previous studies using the ROI approach, which has several drawbacks, the present study aimed to measure the impact of ischemic lesion location on functional outcome using a more precise voxelwise approach. MATERIALS AND METHODS Datasets of patients with acute ischemic strokes from the Multicenter Randomized Clinical Trial of Endovascular Therapy for Acute Ischemic Stroke in the Netherlands (MR CLEAN) were used. Primary outcome was functional outcome as assessed by the modified Rankin Scale 3 months after stroke. Ischemic lesion volume was determined on CT scans 3-9 days after stroke. Voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping techniques, including covariates that are known to be associated with functional outcome, were used to determine the impact of ischemic lesion location for outcome. RESULTS Of the 500 patients in the MR CLEAN trial, 216 were included for analysis. The mean age was 63 years. Lesion-symptom mapping with inclusion of covariates revealed that especially left-hemispheric lesions in the deep periventricular white matter and adjacent internal capsule showed a great influence on functional outcome. CONCLUSIONS Our study confirms that infarct location has an important impact on functional outcome of patients with stroke and should be considered in prediction models. After we adjusted for covariates, the left-hemispheric corticosubcortical fiber tracts seemed to be of higher functional importance compared with cortical lesions.","Ernst, M; Boers, A M M; Forkert, N D; Berkhemer, O A; Roos, Y B; Dippel, D W J; van der Lugt, A; van Oostenbrugge, R J; van Zwam, W H; Vettorazzi, E; Fiehler, J; Marquering, H A; Majoie, C B L M; Gellissen, S",AJNR.

By integrating RNA-seq data and GWAS summary statistics, novel computational methods allow unbiased identification of trait-relevant tissues and cell types. METHODS The CKDGen consortium provided GWAS summary data for eGFR, urinary albumin-creatinine ratio (UACR), BUN, and serum urate. Genotype-Tissue Expression Project (GTEx) RNA-seq data were used to construct the top 10% specifically expressed genes for each of 53 tissues followed by linkage disequilibrium (LD) score-based enrichment testing for each trait. Similar procedures were performed for five kidney single-cell RNA-seq datasets from humans and mice and for a microdissected tubule RNA-seq dataset from rat. Gene set enrichment analyses were also conducted for genes implicated in Mendelian kidney diseases. RESULTS Across 53 tissues, genes in kidney function-associated GWAS loci were enriched in kidney (P=9.1E-8 for eGFR; P=1.2E-5 for urate) and liver (P=6.8·10-5 for eGFR). In the kidney, proximal tubule was enriched in humans (P=8.5E-5 for eGFR; P=7.8E-6 for urate) and mice (P=0.0003 for eGFR; P=0.0002 for urate) and confirmed as the primary cell type in microdissected tubules and organoids. Gene set enrichment analysis supported this and showed enrichment of genes implicated in monogenic glomerular diseases in podocytes. A systematic approach generated a comprehensive list of GWAS genes prioritized by cell type-specific expression. CONCLUSIONS Integration of GWAS statistics of kidney function traits and gene expression data identified relevant tissues and cell types, as a basis for further mechanistic studies to understand GWAS loci.","Li, Yong; Haug, Stefan; Schlosser, Pascal; Teumer, Alexander; Tin, Adrienne; Pattaro, Cristian; Köttgen, Anna; Wuttke, Matthias",Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN,200,31

OBJECTIVE To assess the baseline prevalence and predictors of CVD risks among severely obese adolescents undergoing weight-loss surgery. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A prospective cohort study was conducted from February 28, 2007, to December 30, 2011, at the following 5 adolescent weight-loss surgery centers in the United States: Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio; Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center in Cincinnati, Ohio; Texas Children's Hospital in Houston; University of Pittsburgh Medical Center in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; and Children's Hospital of Alabama in Birmingham. Consecutive patients aged 19 years or younger were offered enrollment in a long-term outcome study; the final analysis cohort consisted of 242 participants. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES This report examined the preoperative prevalence of CVD risk factors (ie, fasting hyperinsulinemia, elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels, impaired fasting glucose levels, dyslipidemia, elevated blood pressure, and diabetes mellitus) and associations between risk factors and body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared), age, sex, and race/ethnicity. Preoperative data were collected within 30 days preceding bariatric surgery. RESULTS The mean (SD) age was 17 (1.6) years and median body mass index was 50.5. Cardiovascular disease risk factor prevalence was fasting hyperinsulinemia (74%), elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels (75%), dyslipidemia (50%), elevated blood pressure (49%), impaired fasting glucose levels (26%), and diabetes mellitus (14%). The risk of impaired fasting glucose levels, elevated blood pressure, and elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels increased by 15%, 10%, and 6%, respectively, per 5-unit increase in body mass index (P < .01). Dyslipidemia (adjusted relative risk = 1.60 [95% CI, 1.26-2.03]; P < .01) and elevated blood pressure (adjusted relative risk = 1.48 [95% CI, 1.16-1.89]; P < .01) were more likely in adolescent boys compared with adolescent girls. White individuals were at greater risk of having elevated triglyceride levels (adjusted relative risk = 1.76 [95% CI, 1.14-2.72]; P = .01) but were less likely to have impaired fasting glucose levels (adjusted relative risk = 0.58 [95% CI, 0.38-0.89]; P = .01). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Numerous CVD risk factors are apparent in adolescents undergoing weight-loss surgery. Increasing body mass index and male sex increase the relative risk of specific CVD risk factors. These data suggest that even among severely obese adolescents, recognition and treatment of CVD risk factors is important to help limit further progression of disease.","Michalsky, Marc P; Inge, Thomas H; Simmons, Mark; Jenkins, Todd M; Buncher, Ralph; Helmrath, Michael; Brandt, Mary L; Harmon, Carroll M; Courcoulas, Anita; Chen, Michael; Horlick, Mary; Daniels, Stephen R; Urbina, Elaine M",JAMA pediatrics,200,13

Forty-five patients with CLM were randomized to laparoscopic (n = 23) or open (n = 22) resection. Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid-plasma samples were collected preoperatively and at defined time points during and after surgery and snap frozen at -80 C.

Peak levels were reached at the end of or shortly after surgery. Five markers, HMGB-1, cfDNA, IL-6, C-reactive protein, and macrophage inflammatory protein -1β, showed significantly higher levels in the open surgery group compared with the laparoscopic surgery group.Laparoscopic resection of CLM reduced the inflammatory response compared with open resection.

STUDY DESIGN We conducted a survey with IM attendings and trainees at a large academic medical center in Western Pennsylvania. We used descriptive statistics to characterize attitudes towards medication abortion provision, including the belief that it is within their scope of practice and interest in future provision, and to explore perceived barriers to provision. We used logistic regression models to assess factors associated with each of these attitudes. RESULTS Of 397 eligible attendings and trainees, 121 (30%) completed the survey. Among those surveyed, 44% believed medication abortion is within the scope of practice of IM PCPs with trainees and female-identifying providers being significantly more likely to believe medication abortion is within their scope of practice compared to attending physicians and male physicians (60% vs. 30%, p<0.01 and 53% vs 31%, p=0.01, respectively). Similarly, 43% endorsed interest in future provision, with trainees (67% vs. 23%, p < 0.001) and female providers (54% vs. 27%, p=0.002) being more likely to express interest. The most cited barriers to provision included limited training in residency (70%) and low familiarity with abortion medications (57%). CONCLUSIONS Many IM providers- particularly trainees- believe medication abortion is within their scope of practice and would like to provide this care. Interventions are needed to provide education and assistance complying with state and federal regulations to enable safe and efficient medication abortion provision by IM providers. IMPLICATIONS IM departments and residency programs should seek to ensure training is offered to clinicians interested in providing medication abortion as a part of their primary care practice.","Wolgemuth, Tierney; Judge-Golden, Colleen; Lane, Katherine; Stern, Jamie; Borrero, Sonya",Contraception,200,1

Metabolic diseases impact all systems of the body and despite current therapies that offer some protection through tight serum glucose control, ultimately such treatments cannot block the progression of disability and death realized with metabolic disorders. As a result, novel therapeutic avenues are critical for further development to address these concerns. An innovative strategy involves the vitamin nicotinamide and the pathways associated with the silent mating type information regulation 2 homolog 1 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) (SIRT1), the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), mTOR Complex 1 (mTORC1), mTOR Complex 2 (mTORC2), AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK), and clock genes. Nicotinamide maintains an intimate relationship with these pathways to oversee metabolic disease and improve glucose utilization, limit mitochondrial dysfunction, block oxidative stress, potentially function as antiviral therapy, and foster cellular survival through mechanisms involving autophagy. However, the pathways of nicotinamide, SIRT1, mTOR, AMPK, and clock genes are complex and involve feedback pathways as well as trophic factors such as erythropoietin that require a careful balance to ensure metabolic homeostasis. Future work is warranted to gain additional insight into these vital pathways that can oversee both normal metabolic physiology and metabolic disease.","Maiese, Kenneth",Current neurovascular research,200,16

The laboratory diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection has relied on nucleic acid testing; however, it has some limitations, such as low throughput and high rates of false negatives. Tests of higher sensitivity are needed to effectively identify infected patients. Methods This study has developed fully automated chemiluminescent immunoassays to determine IgM and IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in human serum. The assay performance has been evaluated at 10 hospitals. Clinical specificity was evaluated by measuring 972 hospitalized patients and 586 donors of a normal population. Clinical sensitivity was assessed on 513 confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR. Results The assays demonstrated satisfied assay precision with coefficient of variation of less than 4.45%. Inactivation of specimen did not affect assay measurement. SARS-CoV-2 IgM showed clinical specificity of 97.33 and 99.49% for hospitalized patients and the normal population respectively, and SARS-CoV-2 IgG showed clinical specificity of 97.43 and 99.15% respectively.

Excessive use of insecticides at higher doses poses a serious threat of food contamination and residual toxicity for grain consumers. Since the development of new pesticide incurs heavy costs, identifying an effective synergist can provide a ready and economical tool for controlling resistant pest populations. Therefore, the synergistic property of quercetin with paraoxon and tetraethyl pyrophosphate has been evaluated against the larvae and adults of Tribolium castaneum (Herbst). Comparative molecular docking analyses were carried out to further identify the possible mechanism of synergism. It was observed that quercetin has no insecticidal when applied at the rate of 1.5 and 3.0 mg/g; however, a considerable synergism was observed when applied in combination with paraoxon. The comparative molecular docking analyses of CYP450 monooxygenase (CYP15A1, CYP6BR1, CYP6BK2, CYP6BK3) family were performed with quercetin, paraoxon and tetraethyl pyrophosphate which revealed considerable molecular interactions, predicting the inhibition of CYP450 isoenzyme by all three ligands. The study concludes that quercetin may be an effective synergist for organophosphate pesticides depending upon the dose and type of the compound. In addition, in silico analyses of the structurally diversified organophosphates can effectively differentiate the organophosphates which are synergistic with quercetin.","Ghaffar, Ammarah; Sehgal, Sheikh Arslan; Fatima, Rida; Batool, Roya; Aimen, Ume; Awan, Sliha; Batool, Sajida; Ahmad, Faheem; Nurulain, Syed M",Toxicology research,200,19

It is unknown whether access to telemedicine care has been equitable during this time. This study aimed to identify patient-level factors associated with adoption of telemedicine for subspecialty diabetes care during the pandemic. METHODS We conducted an explanatory sequential mixed-methods study using data from a single academic medical center. We used multivariate logistic regression to explore associations between telemedicine use and demographic factors for patients receiving subspecialty diabetes care between March 19 and June 30, 2020. We then surveyed a sample of patients who received in-person care to understand why these patients did not use telemedicine. RESULTS Among 1292 patients who received subspecialty diabetes care during the study period, those over age 65 were less likely to use telemedicine (OR: 0.34, 95% CI: 0.22-0.52, P < .001), as were patients with a primary language other than English (OR: 0.53, 95% CI: 0.31-0.91, P = .02), and patients with public insurance (OR: 0.64, 95% CI: 0.49-0.84, P = .001).

CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest that, amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been disparities in telemedicine use by age, language, and insurance for patients with diabetes mellitus. We anticipate telemedicine will continue to be an important care modality for chronic conditions in the years ahead. Significant work must therefore be done to ensure that telemedicine services do not introduce or widen population health disparities.","Haynes, Sarah C; Kompala, Tejaswi; Neinstein, Aaron; Rosenthal, Jennifer; Crossen, Stephanie",Journal of diabetes science and technology,200,24

The main objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and the postoperative opioid-sparing effect of dexmedetomidine-based OFA in adult cardiac surgery patients. METHODS We conducted a single-centre and retrospective study including 80 patients above 18 years old who underwent on-pump cardiac surgery between November 2018 and February 2020. Patients were divided into two groups: OFA (lidocaine, ketamine, dexmedetomidine, MgSO4) or opioid-based anaesthesia (remifentanil and anti-hyperalgesic medications such as ketamine and/or MgSO4 and/or lidocaine at the discretion of the anesthesiologist). The primary endpoint was the total amount of opioid consumed in its equivalent of intravenous morphine during the first 48 postoperative hours. Secondary outcomes included perioperative hemodynamics, post-operative maximal pain at rest and during coughing and adverse outcomes. Data are expressed as median [interquartile range]. RESULTS Patients in the OFA-group had a higher EuroSCORE II, with more diabetes, more dyslipidemia and more non-elective surgery but fewer smoking history. In the OFA group, the median loading dose of dexmedetomidine was 0.6 [0.4-0.6] μg.kg- 1 while the median maintenance dose was 0.11 μg.kg- 1.h- 1 [0.05-0.20]. In 10 (25%) patients, dexmedetomidine was discontinued for a drop of mean arterial pressure below 55 mmHg. The median total amount of opioid consumed in its equivalent of intravenous morphine during the first 48 postoperative hours was lower in the OFA group (15.0 mg [8.5-23.5] versus 30.0 mg [17.3-44.3], p < 0.001). While no differences were seen with rest pain (2.0 [0.0-3.0] versus 0.5 [0.0-5.0], p = 0.60), the maximal pain score during coughing was lower in OFA group (3.5 [2.0-5.0] versus 5.5 [3.0-7.0], p = 0.04). In OFA group the incidence of atrial fibrillation (18% versus 40%, p = 0.03) and non-invasive ventilation use (25% versus 48%, p = 0.04) were lower. The incidence of bradycardia and the intraoperative use of norepinephrine were similar between both groups. CONCLUSION Dexmedetomidine-based OFA in cardiac surgery patients is feasible and could be associated with a lower postoperative morphine consumption and better postoperative outcomes. Further randomized studies are required to confirm these promising results and determine the optimal associations, dosages, and infusion protocols during cardiac surgery.","Aguerreche, Clément; Cadier, Gaspard; Beurton, Antoine; Imbault, Julien; Leuillet, Sébastien; Remy, Alain; Zaouter, Cédrick; Ouattara, Alexandre",BMC anesthesiology,200,9

This study aims at assessing the outcomes of converting LSG to laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) and laparoscopic re-sleeve gastrectomy (LRSG). METHODS A total of 1300 patients underwent LSG from 2009 to 2012, of which 12 patients underwent LRYGB and 24 patients underwent LRSG in Al-Amiri Hospital alone. Data included length of stay, percentage excessive weight loss (EWL%), and body mass index (BMI). RESULTS Twenty-four patients underwent conversion from LSG to LRSG, and 12 patients underwent conversion from LSG to LRYGB due to insufficient weight loss and weight regain. Eighty-five percent were females. The mean weight and BMI prior to LSG for the LRYGB and LRSG patients were 136.5 kg and 52, and 134 kg and 50, respectively. The EWL% after the initial LSG was 37.9 and 43 %, for LRYGB and LRSG, respectively. There were no complications recorded. Results of conversion of LSG to LRYGB involved a mean EWL% 61.3 % after 1 year (p value 0.009). Results of LRSG involved a mean EWL% of 57 % over interval of 1 year (p value 0.05). Comparison of the EWL% of LRYGB and LRSG for failed primary LSG was not significant (p value 0.097). CONCLUSION Following our algorithm, revising an LSG with an LRSG or LRYGB for poor weight loss is feasible with good outcomes. Larger and longer follow-up studies are needed to verify our results.","AlSabah, Salman; Alsharqawi, Nourah; Almulla, Ahmed; Akrof, Shehab; Alenezi, Khaled; Buhaimed, Waleed; Al-Subaie, Saud; Al Haddad, Mohanned",Obesity surgery,200,1

The clinical question addressed was: Are nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or other complementary treatments effective for migraine prevention? METHODS The authors analyzed published studies from June 1999 to May 2009 using a structured review process to classify the evidence relative to the efficacy of various medications for migraine prevention. RESULTS The author panel reviewed 284 abstracts, which ultimately yielded 49 Class I or Class II articles on migraine prevention; of these 49, 15 were classified as involving nontraditional therapies, NSAIDs, and other complementary therapies that are reviewed herein. RECOMMENDATIONS Petasites (butterbur) is effective for migraine prevention and should be offered to patients with migraine to reduce the frequency and severity of migraine attacks (Level A). Fenoprofen, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, naproxen, naproxen sodium, MIG-99 (feverfew), magnesium, riboflavin, and subcutaneous histamine are probably effective for migraine prevention (Level B). Treatments considered possibly effective are cyproheptadine, Co-Q10, estrogen, mefenamic acid, and flurbiprofen (Level C). Data are conflicting or inadequate to support or refute use of aspirin, indomethacin, omega-3, or hyperbaric oxygen for migraine prevention.

The aim of our study was to present and to analyze episodes of catheter tip malposition during percutaneous tunneled hemodialysis catheter insertion in the large, unselected group of patients. All patients who underwent the procedure of catheter insertion in our department during year 2012 were analyzed retrospectively. One hundred four tunneled hemodialysis catheters were inserted in 101 patients. In 58 patients, the catheter was inserted at the initiation of hemodialysis therapy as the first access and in 46 the catheter was placed because of the failure of the existing one. In 68 patients, the catheter was inserted into the right internal jugular vein and in 20 patients into the left internal jugular vein (LIJV). Subclavian veins were used in five cases and femoral veins in 11 cases. Malposition of the catheter tips occurred in six patients. In all cases, the LIJV was cannulated. In two cases, the catheter tip malposition was in the right innominate vein and in four cases in the azygos vein. Our data demonstrate that with the blind insertion of tunneled hemodialysis catheters, the risk of catheter tip malposition is significantly higher with the left side insertion. As catheter insertion through the LIJV holds very high (30%) risk of the tip malposition, it should always be performed under the fluoroscopic control.","Weber, Ewa; Liberek, Tomasz; Wołyniec, Wojciech; Rutkowski, Bolesław",Hemodialysis international.

This was a single-centre retrospective cohort review of a UK district general hospital serving a population of over 250,000 people. METHODS Participants were all patients undergoing a surgical procedure in the acute theatre list between 23 March to 11 May in both 2019 and 2020. Primary outcome was 90-day postoperative mortality. Secondary outcomes include time to surgical intervention and length of inpatient stay. RESULTS A total of 132 patients (2020) versus 141 (2019) patients were included. Although overall 90-day postoperative mortality was higher in 2020 (9.8%) compared with 2019 (5.7%), this difference was not statistically significant (p=0.196). In 2020, eight patients tested positive for COVID-19 either as an inpatient or within 2 weeks of discharge, of whom five patients died. Time to surgical intervention was significantly faster for NCEPOD (National Confidential Enquiry into Patient Outcome and Death) code 3 patients in 2020 than in 2019 (p=0.027). There were no significant differences in mean length of inpatient stay. CONCLUSIONS We found that patients were appropriately prioritised using NCEPOD classification, with no statistically significant differences in 90-day postoperative mortality and length of inpatient stay compared with the 2019 period. A study on a larger scale would further elucidate the profile and outcomes of patients requiring acute surgery to generate statistical significance.","Luo, W; Limb, R; Aslam, A; Kattimani, R; Karthikappallil, D; Paramasivan, A; Waseem, M",Annals of the Royal College of Surgeons of England,200,20

In recent years, obesity has become a major public health issue and has threatened the wellbeing of millions of patients. Although there are multiple reasons for people becoming obese, sustained positive energy balance - energy intake is greater than energy expenditure - is the key for accumulating excess bodyfat. Prevention of obesity by lifestyle changes, healthy eating and increased physical activity are more cost effective than pharmacotherapy, bariatric surgery or ultimately treating complications of Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Not all patients with obesity experience complications such as T2DM. The distribution of bodyfat is important in determining whether a person is obese and healthy or needs medical attention; however, the use of BMI alone will not differentiate this. Obesity patients with excess abdominal fat have the highest risk for T2DM, insulin resistance and thus, higher incidence of cardiovascular diseases. Obesity-associated complications can be reversed through healthy eating habits and increased duration and intensity of physical activity. Increasing work- and leisure-related physical activities increase the energy expenditure, having salutary effects on weightloss programs. Although treating symptoms of obesity and related disorders is important, it is not a solution for the obesity epidemic. Causes that lead to weight-gain need to be identified in individual patients, who should be educated about the causes of weight gain and ways to prevent it, and be provided with simple and practical interventions to lose weight.","Wimalawansa, Sunil J",Expert review of endocrinology & metabolism,200,9

The replicase proteins together with viral RNA and host factors form membrane invaginations termed spherules, which act as the replication complexes producing progeny RNAs. We have previously shown that the wild-type alphavirus replicase requires a functional RNA template and active polymerase to generate spherule structures. However, we now find that specific partially processed forms of the replicase proteins alone can give rise to membrane invaginations in the absence of RNA or replication. The minimal requirement for spherule formation was the expression of properly cleaved nsP4, together with either uncleaved P123 or with the combination of nsP1 and uncleaved P23. These inactive spherules were morphologically less regular than replication-induced spherules. In the presence of template, nsP1 plus uncleaved P23 plus nsP4 could efficiently assemble active replication spherules producing both negative-sense and positive-sense RNA strands. P23 alone did not have membrane affinity, but could be recruited to membrane sites in the presence of nsP1 and nsP4. These results define the set of viral components required for alphavirus replication complex assembly and suggest the possibility that it could be reconstituted from separately expressed nonstructural proteins.IMPORTANCE All positive-strand RNA viruses extensively modify host cell membranes to serve as efficient platforms for viral RNA replication. Alphaviruses and several other groups induce protective membrane invaginations (spherules) as their genome factories. Most positive-strand viruses produce their replicase as a polyprotein precursor, which is further processed through precise and regulated cleavages. We show here that specific cleavage intermediates of the alphavirus replicase can give rise to spherule structures in the absence of viral RNA. In the presence of template RNA, the same intermediates yield active replication complexes. Thus, partially cleaved replicase proteins play key roles that connect replication complex assembly, membrane deformation, and the different stages of RNA synthesis.","Hellström, Kirsi; Kallio, Katri; Utt, Age; Quirin, Tania; Jokitalo, Eija; Merits, Andres; Ahola, Tero",Journal of virology,200,1

Since diabetes is a significant risk factor associated with poor prognosis among COVID-19 patients, this article aims to discuss the pharmacotherapeutic considerations for the management of diabetes in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. AREAS COVERED This paper presents a critical and comprehensive review of existing literature to present various aspects of diabetes management in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and is divided into three sections (i) susceptibility and severity of COVID-19 among individuals with diabetes, (ii) glycaemic goals for hospitalized COVID-19 patients with diabetes, (iii) pharmacological treatment considerations for diabetes in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. EXPERT OPINION The inpatient goal of therapy in both COVID-19 patients with type 1 (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is to avoid disruption of stable metabolic state, tight glycaemic control, and prevent adverse glycaemic events. Patients with T1DM require insulin therapy at all times to prevent ketosis. The management strategy for T2DM includes temporary discontinuation of certain oral antidiabetic agents and consideration for insulin therapy, at least during hospitalization. Patients with T2DM who are relatively stable and able to eat regularly may continue with oral hypoglycaemic agents if glycaemic control is satisfactory. Hyperglycaemia should be anticipated in patients with systemic corticosteroid treatment and managed upon accordingly.","Hasan, Syed Shahzad; Kow, Chia Siang; Bain, Amie; Kavanagh, Sallianne; Merchant, Hamid A; Hadi, Muhammad Abdul",Expert opinion on pharmacotherapy,200,5

Here, we determined whether SGLT2 inhibition affects megalin endocytic function through suppressing its O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine modification (O-GlcNAcylation) and protects the diabetic kidney from protein overload. MATERIALS AND METHOD We treated 8-week-old male non-obese and hypoinsulinemic KK/Ta-Ins2Akita (KK/Ta-Akita) mice which develop progressive DN with an SGLT2 inhibitor ipragliflozin or insulin for 6 weeks, and investigated the endocytic function (proximal tubular protein reabsorption), renal expression and O-GlcNAcylation of megalin along with their effects on renal phenotypes including histology and biochemical markers. RESULTS The treatment with ipragliflozin, but not insulin, suppressed megalin O-GlcNAcylation and accelerated its internalization, resulting in reduction in proximal tubular reabsorption of the highly filtered plasma proteins such as albumin and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin. These alterations following the ipragliflozin treatment contributed to amelioration of proximal tubular protein overload, mitochondrial morphological abnormality, and renal oxidative stress and tubulointerstitial fibrosis. CONCLUSIONS The present study provides a novel crosstalk mechanism between SGLT2 inhibition and megalin underlying the potential renal benefits of SGLT2 inhibition in DN.","Otomo, Hitomi; Nara, Mitsuhiko; Kato, Shunsuke; Shimizu, Tatsunori; Suganuma, Yumi; Sato, Takehiro; Morii, Tsukasa; Yamada, Yuichiro; Fujita, Hiroki",Metabolism: clinical and experimental,200,24

It was available online for general self-reported asthmatic patients to answer for one month, starting on 11st May 2020. The survey only allowed one answer per registered user. Results. Fifty-five responses were obtained. Patients were satisfied with communication with providers (greater than 88%); nevertheless, one-half evaluated the virtual visit as inferior when compared to in-person visits. About one third attributed a classification of 6 or less (0-10 scale, 0 being the worst and 10 the best consultation possible), but still most of the patients would either recommend it or use this kind of medical visits in the future, even outside the actual pandemic context. Patients also referred some important limitations, as lack of physical examination and the fact that the medical visit was more impersonal. Only 27% had technical issues accessing virtual visits. Positive aspects were also named, such as virtual visits being practical and avoiding the need to move to the hospital. Discussion and conclusions. Our survey revealed that small changes could further increase patients' satisfaction, adherence, and confidence in telemedicine. Although presenting some limitations, virtual visits seem to be generally well accepted by asthmatic patients and it might be a good alternative for in-person visits, at least in such difficult times when social distancing is recommended.","Sabina Sousa, C; Trigueiro Barbosa, M; Aguiar, R; Benito-Garcia, F; Morais-Almeida, M",European annals of allergy and clinical immunology,200,31

In neurosurgery, for example, the simultaneous use of 2 instruments through the same endoscopic shaft remains a difficult feat. It is, however, very challenging to manufacture steerable instruments of the requisite small diameter. We present a new technique to produce such instruments by means of laser cutting. Only 3 coaxial tubes are used. The middle tube has a cutting pattern that allows the steering forces to be transmitted from the proximal to the distal end. In this way the steering part is concealed in the wall of the tube. Large diameter articulated instruments such as for laparoscopy might benefit from the excellent tip stability provided by the same economical technology. METHOD Coaxial nitinol tubes are laser-cut with a Rofin Stent Cutter in a specific pattern. The 3 tubes are assembled by sliding them over one another, forming a single composite tube. In a surgical simulator, the neurosurgical microinstruments and laparoscopic needle drivers were evaluated on surgical convenience. RESULTS Simultaneous use of 2 neurosurgical instruments (1.5 mm diameter) through the same endoscopic shaft proved to be very intuitive. The tip of the steerable laparoscopic instruments (10 mm diameter) could resist a lateral force of more than 20 N. The angle of motion for either instrument was at least 70° in any direction. CONCLUSIONS A new design for steerable endoscopic instruments is presented. It allows the construction in a range from microinstruments to 10-mm laparoscopic devices with excellent tip stability.","Dewaele, Frank; Kalmar, Alain F; De Ryck, Frederic; Lumen, Nicolaas; Williams, Leonie; Baert, Edward; Vereecke, Hugo; Kalala Okito, Jean Pierre; Mabilde, Cyriel; Blanckaert, Bart; Keereman, Vincent; Leybaert, Luc; Van Nieuwenhove, Yves; Caemaert, Jacques; Van Roost, Dirk",Surgical innovation,200,1

Health and social welfare systems play a significant role in coordinating practical resources and support in this context. However, little is known about social policy and interactions with public institutions that shape experiences of informal carers with social welfare needs at end-of-life. AIM To explore ways in which palliative care and welfare sector workers perceive and approach experiences and needs of the carers of people with life-limiting illnesses who receive government income support or housing assistance, in an area of recognised socioeconomic disadvantage. DESIGN An interpretive descriptive study employed in-depth, qualitative interviews to explore participants' reflections on working with carers of someone with a life-limiting illness. Data were analysed using the framework approach. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS Twenty-one workers employed within three public services in Western Sydney were recruited. RESULTS Workers articulated understandings of welfare policy and its consequences for carers at end-of-life, including precariousness in relation to financial and housing circumstances. Identified resources and barriers to the navigation of social welfare needs by carers were categorised as personal, interpersonal and structural. CONCLUSIONS Caring at end-of-life while navigating welfare needs was seen to be associated with precariousness by participants, particularly for carers positioned in vulnerable social locations. Findings highlighted experiences of burdensome system navigation, inconsistent processes and inequity. Further exploration of structural determinants of experience is needed, including aspects of palliative care and welfare practice and investment in inter-agency infrastructure for supporting carers at end-of-life.","Bindley, Kristin; Lewis, Joanne; Travaglia, Joanne; DiGiacomo, Michelle",Palliative medicine,200,12

METHODS Twenty strands (60 cm each) of size 1 polydioxanone absorbable suture (Ethicon, Somerville, NJ) were placed in the central venous system of domestic swine. Strands were harvested at weekly intervals during 10 weeks for tensile strength testing. Results were compared with control samples obtained from an in vitro engineered circulation system containing sodium phosphate buffer solution. Three IVC filters braided from polydioxanone suture were also catheter deployed in three swine to assess absorbable IVC filter feasibility. RESULTS Polydioxanone retained 82% tensile strength in vitro vs 79% in vivo at 35 days (P > .22), the desired prophylactic duration. For IVC filters made from polydioxanone, technical success of placement was achieved in all three filters deployed (100%). Autologous thrombus deployed inferior to the filter remained trapped in the filter until thrombus resorption, with no evidence of pulmonary emboli on follow-up computed tomography. There were no instances of caval penetration, filter-induced IVC thrombosis, filter migration, or tilt >15 degrees with imaging and clinical follow-up carried out to 32 weeks. CONCLUSIONS Strength retention of polydioxanone suture placed in the venous system of swine is similar to earlier in vitro studies out to 10 weeks (P > .06 for all weeks) and is more than sufficient (8.20 ± 0.37 kg mean load at break for size 1) to trap thrombus. Pilot animal study suggests that an absorbable polydioxanone IVC filter can be catheter deployed to capture and to hold iatrogenically administered autologous thrombus through resorption.","Eggers, Mitchell D; McArthur, Mark J; Figueira, Tomas A; Abdelsalam, Mohamed E; Dixon, Katherine P; Pageon, Laura R; Wallace, Michael J; Huang, Steven Y",Journal of vascular surgery.

MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective review from January 2002 to October 2011 was performed of 440 patients who underwent endovascular treatment of symptomatic femoropopliteal disease for claudication (n = 251) or critical limb ischemia (CLI) (n = 267). CKD stage was divided based on Kidney Dialysis Outcomes Quality Initiative classification. Outcomes and factors associated with amputation, MALE, and MALE + POD were determined. RESULTS Patients with diabetes (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.2; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3-3.6; P = .002) and runoff score of 0 or 1 (HR = 2.0; 95% CI, 1.2-3.4; P = .01) relative to runoff score of 3 were at increased risk of amputation.

The aims of this study were to select the attributes determining overall disease severity, to rank the importance of and to score these individual attributes for both CD and UC. METHODS Using a modified Delphi panel, 14 members of the International Organization for the Study of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IOIBD) selected the most important attributes related to IBD. Eighteen IOIBD members then completed a statistical exercise (conjoint analysis) to create a relative ranking of these attributes. Adjusted utilities were developed by creating proportions for each level within an attribute. RESULTS For CD, 15.8% of overall disease severity was attributed to the presence of mucosal lesions, 10.9% to history of a fistula, 9.7% to history of abscess and 7.4% to history of intestinal resection. For UC, 18.1% of overall disease severity was attributed to mucosal lesions, followed by 14.0% for impact on daily activities, 11.2% C reactive protein and 10.1% for prior experience with biologics. Overall disease severity indices were created on a 100-point scale by applying each attribute's average importance to the adjusted utilities. CONCLUSIONS Based on specialist opinion, overall CD severity was associated more with intestinal damage, in contrast to overall UC disease severity, which was more dependent on symptoms and impact on daily life. Once validated, disease severity indices may provide a useful tool for consistent assessment of overall disease severity in patients with IBD.","Siegel, Corey A; Whitman, Cynthia B; Spiegel, Brennan M R; Feagan, Brian; Sands, Bruce; Loftus, Edward V; Panaccione, Remo; D'Haens, Geert; Bernstein, Charles N; Gearry, Richard; Ng, Siew C; Mantzaris, Gerassimos J; Sartor, Balfour; Silverberg, Mark S; Riddell, Robert; Koutroubakis, Ioannis E; O'Morain, Colm; Lakatos, Peter L; McGovern, Dermot P B; Halfvarson, Jonas; Reinisch, Walter; Rogler, Gerhard; Kruis, Wolfgang; Tysk, Curt; Schreiber, Stefan; Danese, Silvio; Sandborn, William; Griffiths, Anne; Moum, Bjorn; Gasche, Christoph; Pallone, Francesco; Travis, Simon; Panes, Julian; Colombel, Jean-Frederic; Hanauer, Stephen; Peyrin-Biroulet, Laurent",Gut,200,33

Accurate, non-invasive diagnostic methods using CT imaging can help developing an optimal therapeutic regimen for both conditions. OBJECTIVES To compare the initial CT imaging features in COVID-19 with those in other types of viral pneumonia. METHODS Clinical and imaging data of 51 patients with COVID-19 and 69 with other types of viral pneumonia were retrospectively studied. All significant imaging features (Youden index >0.3) were included for constituting the combined criteria for COVID-19 diagnosis, composed of two or more imaging features with a parallel model. McNemar's chi-square test or Fisher's exact test was used to compare the validity indices (sensitivity and specificity) among various criteria. RESULTS Ground glass opacities (GGO) dominated density, peripheral distribution, unilateral lung, clear margin of lesion, rounded morphology, long axis parallel to the pleura, vascular thickening, and crazy-paving pattern were more common in COVID-19 (p <0.05). Consolidation-dominated density, both central and peripheral distribution, bilateral lung, indistinct margin of lesion, tree-in-bud pattern, mediastinal or hilar lymphadenectasis, pleural effusion, and pleural thickening were more common in other types of viral pneumonia (p < 0.05). GGO-dominated density or long axis parallel to the pleura (with the highest sensitivity), and GGO-dominated density or long axis parallel to the pleura or vascular thickening (with the highest specificity) are good combined criteria of COVID-19.

Pregnancy intentions and contraceptive use were analysed using descriptive statistics. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated to investigate difficulty accessing SRH products and services. Qualitative data were analysed using conventional content analysis. RESULTS Most participants were aged 18-24 years, and indicated they were trying to avoid pregnancy. The oral contraceptive pill was the most common single method used however nearly 20% reported they were not using contraception. Women who were employed had less trouble accessing contraception during lockdown. Participants reported delaying childbearing or deciding to remain childfree due to COVID-19. CONCLUSION COVID-19 lockdown impacted the SRH of Australian women.

In this study, we investigated the ion-induced enhancement effect while challenging a low-efficiency heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) filter with viable bacterial cells, bacterial and fungal spores, and viruses. The aerosol concentration was measured in real time. Samples were also collected with a bioaerosol sampler for viable microbial analysis. The removal efficiency of the filter was determined, respectively, with and without an ion emitter. The ionization was found to significantly enhance the filter efficiency in removing viable biological particles from the airflow. For example, when challenged with viable bacteria, the filter efficiency increased as much as four- to fivefold. For viable fungal spores, the ion-induced enhancement improved the efficiency by a factor of approximately 2. When testing with virus-carrying liquid droplets, the original removal efficiency provided by the filter was rather low: 9.09 +/- 4.84%. While the ion emission increased collection about fourfold, the efficiency did not reach 75-100% observed with bacteria and fungi. These findings, together with our previously published results for non-biological particles, demonstrate the feasibility of a new approach for reducing aerosol particles in HVAC systems used for indoor air quality control. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS Recirculated air in HVAC systems used for indoor air quality control in buildings often contains considerable number of viable bioaerosol particles because of limited efficiency of the filters installed in these systems. In the present study, we investigated - using aerosolized bacterial cells, bacterial and fungal spores, and virus-carrying particles - a novel idea of enhancing the performance of a low-efficiency HVAC filter utilizing continuous emission of unipolar ions in the filter vicinity. The findings described in this paper, together with our previously published results for non-biological particles, demonstrate the feasibility of the newly developed approach.","Huang, R; Agranovski, I; Pyankov, O; Grinshpun, S",Indoor air,200,1

Our goal was to conduct an integrated pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic analysis of the appropriateness of ceftriaxone compared with cefazolin for treating serious MSSA infections. Methods Ceftriaxone and cefazolin activity against five clinical MSSA isolates was characterized in an in vitro pharmacodynamic model. Monte Carlo simulations were then used to evaluate various dosing regimens of ceftriaxone and cefazolin based on relevant patient pharmacokinetic data, significant pharmacodynamic targets derived from the in vitro studies (55%ƒT>MIC for bacteriostasis, 75%ƒT>MIC for 1 log10 bacterial kill, 100%ƒT>MIC for ≥3 log10 bacterial kill) and MIC distributions for MSSA from national surveillance data. Results Ceftriaxone at 1 g once daily had poor activity against MSSA with net bacterial growth predicted in 76% of simulated subjects. The standard 2 g of ceftriaxone once daily had predicted bacterial growth or bacteriostasis in 54% of cases with bactericidal effects in only 17%. Cefazolin at 2 g once daily was notably similar to ceftriaxone in expected target attainments. Cefazolin at 2 g twice daily demonstrated maximal pharmacodynamic activity with bactericidal effects in 97% of simulated subjects. Conclusions Given the limited activity of ceftriaxone against S. aureus, particularly for serious infections when bacterial kill is desired, the convenience of once-daily dosing should be weighed against the risks of using an overly broad, suboptimal therapy. Cefazolin warrants further consideration, particularly as optimal pharmacodynamics against MSSA may be achieved with twice-daily dosing in most patients.","Zelenitsky, Sheryl A; Beahm, Nathan P; Iacovides, Harris; Ariano, Robert E; Zhanel, George",The Journal of antimicrobial chemotherapy,200,1

Here, we investigated how a decrease in the HA activation pH (an increase in acid stability) influences the properties of highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza virus in mammalian hosts. We generated isogenic A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1) (VN1203) viruses containing either wild-type HA protein (activation pH 6.0) or an HA2-K58I point mutation (K to I at position 58) (activation pH 5.5). The VN1203-HA2-K58I virus had replication kinetics similar to those of wild-type VN1203 in MDCK and normal human bronchial epithelial cells and yet had reduced growth in human alveolar A549 cells, which were found to have a higher endosomal pH than MDCK cells. Wild-type and HA2-K58I viruses promoted similar levels of morbidity and mortality in C57BL/6J mice and ferrets, and neither virus transmitted efficiently to naive contact cage-mate ferrets. The acid-stabilizing HA2-K58I mutation, which diminishes H5N1 replication and transmission in ducks, increased the virus load in the ferret nasal cavity early during infection while simultaneously reducing the virus load in the lungs. Overall, a single, acid-stabilizing mutation was found to enhance the growth of an H5N1 influenza virus in the mammalian upper respiratory tract, and yet it was insufficient to enable contact transmission in ferrets in the absence of additional mutations that confer α(2,6) receptor binding specificity and remove a critical N-linked glycosylation site. The information provided here on the contribution of HA acid stability to H5N1 influenza virus fitness and transmissibility in mammals in the background of a non-laboratory-adapted virus provides essential information for the surveillance and assessment of the pandemic potential of currently circulating H5N1 viruses.","Zaraket, Hassan; Bridges, Olga A; Duan, Susu; Baranovich, Tatiana; Yoon, Sun-Woo; Reed, Mark L; Salomon, Rachelle; Webby, Richard J; Webster, Robert G; Russell, Charles J",Journal of virology,200,1

The possibility for these persons to enter the job market is limited by stigma. This study explored whether the participation of people with MDs in a job-training course would positively influence employees' opinions about workmates with these disorders. The job-training course was run by company trainers in a megastore 3 times over a 2-year period for a total of 18 participants with MDs. In the training store, employees' views regarding persons with MDs were assessed at pre- and postintervention with the use of matched questionnaires. At postintervention, views among the training store's employees were also compared with those of employees from other stores (controls). Compared with paired preintervention assessment, at postintervention, the training store's employees were more optimistic about recovery; more skeptical about unpredictability, dangerousness, and social distance from persons with MDs; more skeptical about difficulties of these persons in that workplace; more willing to have workmates with MDs; and more confident in the acceptance of workers with MDs by colleagues. Compared with controls, at postintervention, the training store's employees had higher levels of acceptance and lower perception of dangerousness and unpredictability, were more confident in the capacities of persons with MDs to acquire organizational skills and in their acceptance by colleagues, and were surer that having coworkers with MDs would improve the company public image. Providing job-training courses to persons with MDs could be helpful to reduce stigma against such persons in ordinary work contexts.

OBJECTIVE To describe the initial experience and the technical innovations of a new-generation FDD (p64 Flow Modulation Device, Phenox, Bochum, Germany). METHODS Between December 2014 and February 2015, six intracranial aneurysms in five patients (four women, one man; mean age 63 years) were treated with the p64 Flow Modulation Device. RESULTS Immediate post-treatment angiography showed reduced flow into all aneurysms. No long-term angiographic data are available. The device may be easily deployed and totally retrieved with a unique mechanical detachment. No periprocedural technical complications occurred. No early or delayed aneurysm rupture, no ischemic or hemorrhagic complications, and no neurological morbidity or death were seen. CONCLUSIONS Treatment of cerebral aneurysms with the p64 Flow Modulation Device is a safe procedure with no technical complications. The mechanical detachment and the 100% retrievability are significant advantages of this new device. However, large prospective studies with long-term clinical and angiographic follow-up are necessary to assess the role of the p64 in the endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysms.","Briganti, Francesco; Leone, Giuseppe; Marseglia, Mariano; Cicala, Domenico; Caranci, Ferdinando; Maiuri, Francesco",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,200,1

Although fear appears to be a major contributing factor, there has been no systematic research to determine which specific facets of fear predict psychopathology during the coronavirus crisis. The present study is the first to examine which fear factors uniquely predict clinical levels of depressive symptoms and generalized anxiety. Data were collected from 256 adults in the United States recruited from Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk) during the coronavirus pandemic. The results from logistic regression analyses demonstrated that neuroticism, coronaphobia, and hypochondriasis were fear factors that predicted pandemic-related psychopathology in adults. These findings suggest that mental health professionals should screen individuals for this set of fear factors when choosing appropriate assessments and interventions for treating people who are suffering during the crisis.","Lee, Sherman A; Crunk, Elizabeth A",Omega,200,9

Here we compared digital and paper-based photographs representing different smile aesthetic features using visual analog scale (VAS) scoring. Materials and Methods One hundred students were randomly recruited from a university campus. Participants were asked to record their perception of smile aesthetics via paper and digital-based platforms. The minimum clinically important difference between platforms was set at 15 mm. The percentage of participants who rated smile attractiveness worse on digital images was recorded. The paired one-tailed Student's t test was used to determine differences between digital and paper platforms, and Bland-Altman analysis and intraclass correlations (ICCs) were used to test for agreement between paper and digital photographs. Results Ninety-nine subjects participated, 55 men (mean age = 22.05, standard deviation [SD] = 1.91) and 44 women (mean age 22.05, SD = 1.84). There were statistically significant differences between paper-based and digital photographs for all images except one (paired t test; P < 0.05). Digital ratings were lower than paper-based ratings for all images, and differences were clinically significant in four out of eight images. A high percentage of participants (50.5%-85.9%) rated smile attractiveness worse on digital images than on paper for all images. There was poor agreement between the two methods as assessed by ICCs and Bland-Altman analysis. Conclusion Equivalence between paper and digital images for smile aesthetics cannot be assumed, and paper-based photographs may lead to clinically relevant overestimations of perceived attractiveness. As academic dentistry increasingly relies on digital imaging and sharing in the post-COVID-19 world, further validation of digital platforms for smile aesthetics assessment is warranted, and care should be taken when interpreting the results of studies assessing smile perception based on different platforms.","Agou, Shoroog Hassan",Journal of International Society of Preventive & Community Dentistry,200,19

AIMS To assess the functionality, perceived safety, droplet protection and aerosol protection of several barrier techniques. METHODS Firstly, a simulation study with 12 different laryngoscopists was conducted to assess the time taken to perform an intubation (via direct laryngoscopy, via video laryngoscopy and via a bougie) with four different barrier techniques (personal protective equipment only, a plastic sheet, a tented plastic sheet and an intubation box). Secondly, a cough at the time of intubation was simulated using ultraviolet dye to assess the spread of droplets; and thirdly, smoke was used to assess the spread of aerosols. RESULTS Intubation time using the box was non-inferior to using no barrier. Based on subjective ratings by the laryngoscopists, the most functional technique was no barrier followed by the intubation box, then the tented sheet, then the plastic sheet. The technique that conferred the highest feeling of safety to the laryngoscopists was the intubation box, followed by the tented sheet, then no barrier and then the plastic sheet. All the barriers prevented the ultraviolet dye contaminating the head and torso of the laryngoscopist. Smoke remained within the intubation box if plastics sheets were used to cover the openings and suction was ineffective at clearing it. With no barrier in place, smoke was effectively cleared away from the patient in a theatre with laminar flow but tended to spread up toward the laryngoscopist in a room without laminar flow. CONCLUSIONS A well-designed intubation box is an effective barrier against droplets and is non-inferior to no barrier in relation to intubation time.However, a box interferes with laminar flow in theatres with formal ventilation systems and may result in accumulation of aerosols if it is completely enclosed.","Lee-Archer, Paul; Boyd, Daniel; Du, Trung; Elliott, Robert; Graydon, Cameron; Paterson, Neil; Morawska, Lidia",Paediatric anaesthesia,200,1

Herein, using a mouse model of coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) infection, we report that a single day of food restriction (FR) markedly increases susceptibility to attenuated enterovirus infection, replication, and disease. These ""pro-viral"" effects, which are rapidly-reversed by the restoration of food, are mediated by several genes whose expression is altered by FR, and which support CVB3 replication. Central to this is TFEB, a protein whose expression and activation status are rapidly increased by FR. TFEB, which regulates the transcription of >100 genes involved in macroautophagy/autophagy and lysosomal biogenesis, responds similarly to both FR and CVB3 infection and plays a pivotal role in determining host susceptibility to CVB3. We propose that, by upregulating TFEB, FR generates an intracellular environment that is more hospitable to the incoming virus, facilitating its replication. This interplay between nutritional status and enterovirus replication has implications for human health and, perhaps, for the evolution of these viruses.Abbreviations: Atg/ATG: autophagy-related; CAR: Coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor; Cas9: CRISPR associated protein 9; Cre: recombinase that causes recombination; CRISPR: clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats; Ctsb/CTSB: cathepsin B; CVB3: coxsackievirus B3; DsRedCVB3: a recombinant CVB3 that encodes the Discosoma red fluorescent protein; EL: elastase; FR: food restriction; GFP: green fluorescent protein; gRNA: guide RNA; HBSS: Hanks Buffered Salt Solution; LYNUS: lysosomal nutrient sensing machinery; MAP1LC3/LC3: microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3; MFI: mean fluorescence intensity; MOI: multiplicity of infection; MTOR: mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase; Nluc: nanoluciferase; NlucCVB3: a recombinant CVB3 encoding nanoluciferase; pfu: plaque-forming unit(s); p.i.: post infection; rCVB: recombinant coxsackievirus B3; RPS6KB/p70S6K: ribosomal protein S6 kinase; RT: room temperature; siRNA: small interfering RNA; TFEB: transcription factor EB; tg: transgenic; TUBB: β-tubulin; UNINF: uninfected; wrt: with respect to; WT: wild type.","Alirezaei, Mehrdad; Flynn, Claudia T; Garcia, Selma D; Kimura, Taishi; Whitton, J Lindsay",Autophagy,200,1

This systematic review sought to identify studies that describe COVID-19 related anxiety, and to understand the impact of anxiety assessment in defining strategies to be implemented in future studies. METHODOLOGY This systematic review included cross-sectional studies with no publication year limit. It was performed a systematic search through three databases, namely, PubMed, Science Direct and Web of Science using the descriptors ""COVID-19"" and ""anxiety"". PRISMA criteria reporting of systematic reviews and meta-analyses were applied. Eligible articles were selected in accordance with inclusion and exclusion criteria. The inclusion criteria were: research articles related with anxiety measurement during the COVID-19 outbreak; interventions to reduce anxiety; and published in English. RESULTS From 44 references, just four scientific articles were accepted for inclusion within this review. These studies were analyzed regarding their sample, methodology, instruments used, and its results. CONCLUSIONS This systematic review was based on published data at the onset of the pandemic, and it could serve as a basis for the development of implementations plans to improve anxiety disorders. The importance of this theme, the implications and potential directions for future investigations will be discussed.","Batista, Patricia; Duque, Vitor; Luzio-Vaz, Ana; Pereira, Anabela",Journal of infection in developing countries,200,31

Several recent trials of mechanical thrombectomy appear to indicate that this treatment may be superior to thrombolysis. We therefore conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and safety of new-generation mechanical thrombectomy devices with intravenous thrombolysis (if eligible) compared with intravenous thrombolysis (if eligible) in patients with acute ischemic stroke caused by a proximal intracranial occlusion. We systematically searched seven databases for randomized controlled trials published between January 2005 and March 2015 comparing stent retrievers or thromboaspiration devices with best medical therapy (with or without intravenous thrombolysis) in adults with acute ischemic stroke. We assessed risk of bias and overall quality of the included trials. We combined the data using a fixed or random effects meta-analysis, where appropriate. We identified 1579 studies; of these, we evaluated 122 full-text papers and included five randomized control trials (n=1287). Compared with patients treated medically, patients who received mechanical thrombectomy were more likely to be functionally independent as measured by a modified Rankin score of 0-2 (odds ratio, 2.39; 95% confidence interval, 1.88-3.04; I2=0%). This finding was robust to subgroup analysis. Mortality and symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage were not significantly different between the two groups.

The aim of this study was to compare the effect of SG, RYGB, and OAGB, on short- and long-term weight loss and comorbidities resolution. METHODS A prospective randomized clinical study of all morbidly obese patients undergoing SG, RYGB, and OAGB, as primary bariatric procedures, was performed. Patients were randomly assigned into 3 groups: those patients undergoing SG, those ones undergoing RYGB and those ones undergoing OAGB. BMI, excess BMI loss (EBMIL) and remission of type 2 diabetes (T2DM), hypertension (HT), and dyslipidemia (DL) were assessed. RESULTS 600 patients were included in the study, 200 in each group. Follow-up rate at 5 years postoperatively was 91% in SG group, 92% in RYGB, and 90% in OAGB. OAGB achieves significantly greater EBMIL than RYGB and SG at 1, 2, and 5 years (p < 0.001, respectively). At 5 years, OAGB achieves significantly greater remission of T2DM (p = 0.027), HT (p = 0.006), and DL (p < 0.001) than RYGB and SG. RYGB did not show significant superiority than SG in short- and long-term remission of T2DM and HT, but achieves greater remission of DL (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION OAGB achieves superior mid- and long-term weight loss than RYGB and SG. There are no significant differences in weight loss between SG and RYGB at 1, 2, and 5 years. OAGB achieves better short- and long-term resolution rates of DM, HT, and DL than SG and RYGB. RYGB and SG obtain similar T2DM and HT remissions, but RYGB reaches significantly greater rates of DL remission.

Serological assays detecting IgG against the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike (S) protein are useful to monitor the immune response after infection or vaccination. The objective of our study was to evaluate the clinical performance of the Siemens SARS-CoV-2 IgG (sCOVG) assay. METHODS Sensitivity and specificity of the Siemens sCOVG test were evaluated on 178 patients with SARS-CoV-2-infection and 160 pre-pandemic samples in comparison with its predecessor test COV2G. Furthermore, correlation with virus neutralization titers was investigated on 134 samples of convalescent COVID-19 patients. RESULTS Specificity of the sCOVG test was 99.4% and sensitivity was 90.5% (COV2G assay 78.7%; p<0.0001). S1-RBD antibody levels showed a good correlation with virus neutralization titers (r=0.843; p<0.0001) and an overall qualitative agreement of 98.5%. Finally, median S1-RBD IgG levels increase with age and were significantly higher in hospitalized COVID-19 patients (median levels general ward: 25.7 U/mL; intensive care: 59.5 U/mL) than in outpatients (3.8 U/mL; p<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS Performance characteristics of the sCOVG assay have been improved compared to the predecessor test COV2G.

Despite proposed technical and physiological advantages, the prone position technique has not been widely adopted. This article reviews the current status of prone thoracoscopic esophagectomy. METHODS A systematic literature search was performed to identify all published clinical studies related to prone esophagectomy. Medline, EMBASE and Google Scholar were searched using the keywords ""prone,"" ""thoracoscopic,"" and ""esophagectomy"" to identify articles published between January 1994 and September 2010. A critical review of these studies is given, and where appropriate the technique is compared to the more traditional minimally invasive technique utilising the left lateral decubitus position. RESULTS Twelve articles reporting the outcomes following prone thoracoscopic oesophagectomy were tabulated. These studies were all non-randomised single-centre prospective or retrospective studies of which four compared the technique to traditional minimally invasive surgery. Although prone esophagectomy is demonstrated as being both feasible and safe, there is no convincing evidence that it is superior to other forms of esophageal surgery. Most authors comment that the prone position is associated with superior surgical ergonomics and theoretically offers a number of physiological benefits. CONCLUSION The ideal approach within minimally invasive esophageal surgery continues to be a subject of debate since no single method has produced outstanding results. Further clinical studies are required to see whether ergonomic advantages of the prone position can be translated into improved patient outcomes.","Jarral, Omar A; Purkayastha, Sanjay; Athanasiou, Thanos; Darzi, Ara; Hanna, George B; Zacharakis, Emmanouil",Surgical endoscopy,200,1

Methods The clinical data of 16 patients with peri-implant refracture after intramedullary nail fixation for intertrochanteric fractures who met the inclusion criteria between April 2014 and November 2019 were retrospectively analyzed. There were 7 males and 9 females with an average age of 78.4 years (range, 65-93 years). The 14 cases of initial intertrochanteric fractures were classified according to the classification of AO/Orthopaedic Trauma Association (AO/OTA): 5 cases of type A1, 7 cases of type A2, and 2 cases of type A3; the other 2 cases were intertrochanteric combined with subtrochanteric fractures (Seinsheimer type Ⅴ). According to the classification of peri-implant refracture which was proposed by Chan et al., there were 10 cases of type 1 (6 cases of type 1A, 3 cases of type 1B, 1 case of type 1C) and 6 cases of type 2 (4 cases of type 2A and 2 cases of type 2B). The average interval between refracture and initial surgery was 14.6 months (range, 1-52 months). The incidence of peri-implant refracture in short nail group (the length of intramedullary nail used in initial surgery≤240 mm) was 1.92% (11/573), while the incidence of long nail group (the length of intramedullary nail used in initial surgery≥340 mm) was 1.66% (5/301), showing no significant difference between the two groups ( χ 2=0.073, P=0.786). The peri-implant refractures were revised with extended intramedullary nail (5 cases) or fixed with additional limited invasive stabilization system (11 cases). Results The average operation time was 115.8 minutes (range, 78-168 minutes) and the average intraoperative blood loss was 283.1 mL (range, 120-500 mL). One patient died of myocardial infarction at 3 months after operation, and the other 15 patients were followed up 9-46 months (mean, 16.8 months). The peri-implant refractures healed at 14-20 weeks (mean, 16.4 weeks) after operation. There was no complications such as incision infection, nonunion, internal fixator loosening and rupture, screw cutting-out, and the second refracture during the follow-up. At last follow-up, all injured limbs regained walking function, and the Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS) score was 56-92 (mean, 80.2). The results were classified as excellent in 2 cases, good in 10, fair in 2, and poor in 1, with the excellent and good rate of 80%. Conclusion Stress concentration at the tip of initial intramedullary nail and distal interlocking screw aera is the main cause of peri-implant refracture after intramedullary nail fixation for intertrochanteric fractures. Revision with extended intramedullary nail or fixation with limited invasive stabilization system according to the length of initial intramedullary nail and the type of refracture can get satisfactory effectiveness.","Teng, Lin; Xiao, Yongchuan; Zhong, Gang",Zhongguo xiu fu chong jian wai ke za zhi = Zhongguo xiufu chongjian waike zazhi = Chinese journal of reparative and reconstructive surgery,200,27

CONCLUSION Flow-diverter device implantation may be a viable alternative to parent artery occlusion in a symptomatic, giant, fusiform vertebral artery aneurysm in a child.","Zarzecka, Anna; Gory, Benjamin; Turjman, Francis",Pediatric neurology,200,1

Here, we reported a novel fibrous membrane with outstanding comfortability and antibacterial activity prepared by PP ultrafine fiber nonwovens and antibacterial functionalized h-BN nanoparticles (QAC/h-BN). The thermal conductivity of commercial PP nonwovens was only 0.13 W m-1 K-1, but that of the QAC/h-BN/PP nanocomposite fibrous membranes can reach 0.88 W m-1 K-1, an enhancement of 706.5% than commercial PP nonwovens. The surface temperature of commercial PP surgical masks was 31.8 °C when the wearing time was 60 min. In contrast, QAC/h-BN/PP surgical masks can reach 33.6 °C at the same tested time, exhibiting stronger heat dissipation than commercial PP surgical masks. Besides, the antibacterial rates of QAC/h-BN/PP nanocomposite fibrous membranes were 99.3% for E. coli and 96.1% for S. aureus, and their antibacterial mechanism was based on ""contact killing"" without the release of unfavorable biocides.

Governments in many countries have implemented pricing policies to ensure affordability of medicines to patients and healthcare systems. The World Health Organization published in 2015 the Guideline on Country Pharmaceutical Pricing Policies, which was based on a series of evidence reviews in the preceding years.As part of the ongoing update of this guideline, we present a protocol for 10 systematic literature reviews on pharmaceutical pricing policies to be covered by the updated guideline. Methods The systematic literature reviews will be undertaken according to the principles embodied in the Cochrane Handbook and Centre for Reviews and Dissemination. The interventions studied are pharmaceutical pricing policies implemented by public institutions or a group of purchasing organizations/individuals (e.g. health services). Studies reporting price, volume, availability and/or affordability as the primary outcomes will be eligible for inclusion. Studies in any country or jurisdiction, in any language and in any setting published in 2004 or later are eligible. Eligible study designs are randomized and non-randomized trials, and observational studies including cohort studies, panel data analyses, comparative time series design (including interrupted time-series and repeated measures studies), and controlled before-after studies. A list of 21 databases of peer-reviewed and grey literature will be searched, along with supplementary searches of relevant national and international organizational and governmental websites. Risk of bias will be assessed according to the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) guidelines. A summary table according to the EPOC Worksheets for preparing a Summary of Findings table (SoF) using GRADE will be provided. Discussion The results of the review will be used as part of the update of the WHO Guideline on Country Pharmaceutical Pricing Policies.

It is critical to discuss newborn care of infected mothers with COVID-19 based on the latest international guidelines and national guidelines of countries with the highest incidence of COVID-19 cases.Objective: We discuss how to care for a newborn of a suspected or infected mother with COVID-19 using existing evidence.Method: As of 16 April 2020, we reviewed articles and guidelines related to COVID-19 in the reproductive health field, mother, and newborn health. Our review yielded in 10 categories (i) the risk of diagnostic procedures in suspected mothers on fetus/infant health, (ii) the risk of intrauterine or postpartum transmission to the fetus/infant, (iii) appropriate method and delivery time in women with confirmed COVID-19, (iv) umbilical cord clamping and skin to skin contact, (v) clinical manifestations of infected infants, (vi) confirmation of infection in a suspected neonate/infant, (vii) instructions for infant's care and how to feed her/him, (viii) bathing the baby, (ix) the criteria of discharging baby from the hospital, (x) the impact of isolation on the maternal mental health.Results: Our findings showed that the possibility of intrauterine or perinatal transmission of COVID-19 is still questionable and ambiguous. However, what has been agreed upon in the existing texts and guidelines is that the close contact of mother and infant after birth can transmit the virus to the baby through droplets or micro-droplets.Conclusions: Based on our findings, it is recommended to separate the baby from the mother with confirmed (or suspected) COVID-19 infection for at least 2 weeks. Since the motivation and stable situation of mothers allow breastfeeding during the isolation, infected mothers should be taught about breast expression skills, common breast problems, the symptoms of their baby's infection, and the principles of personal hygiene to protect the infant against COVID-19 infection.","Shahbazi Sighaldeh, Shirin; Ebrahimi Kalan, Mohammad","The journal of maternal-fetal & neonatal medicine : the official journal of the European Association of Perinatal Medicine, the Federation of Asia and Oceania Perinatal Societies, the International Society of Perinatal Obstetricians",200,0

AIM The purpose of this study was to undertake a health-economic analysis to quantify the impact of developing stroke care in the country. METHODS An economic model was developed to assess the costs and clinical outcomes associated with an ischemic stroke care development program compared with current stroke care. Based on Saudi epidemiological data, cohorts of ischemic stroke patients enter the model each year for the first 10 years based on increasing incidence. Four treatment options were modeled including reperfusion and non-reperfusion treatments. The development scenario estimates the impact of gradually increasing uptake of more effective treatments over 10 years. Changes in the stroke care organization are considered along with resources required to increase capacity, allowing more patients to be admitted to stroke hospitals and access effective treatments. RESULTS The stroke care development program is associated with an increase in functionally independent patients and a decrease in disabling strokes compared with current stroke care. Additionally, the development program is associated with estimated cost savings of $602 million over 15 years ($255 million direct costs, $348 million indirect costs). CONCLUSIONS The model predicts that the stroke care development program is associated with improved patient outcomes and lower overall costs compared with the current stroke care program.","Al-Senani, Fahmi; Al-Johani, Mohammed; Salawati, Mohammad; ElSheikh, Souda; AlQahtani, Maha; Muthana, Jamal; AlZahrani, Saeed; Shore, Judith; Taylor, Matthew; Ravest, Valeska S; Eggington, Simon; Cuche, Matthieu; Davies, Heather; Lobotesis, Kyriakos; Saver, Jeffrey L",International journal of stroke : official journal of the International Stroke Society,200,17

We have identified the ibeA gene in the genome of AIEC strain NRG857c and report the contribution of IbeA to the interaction of AIEC with IECs and macrophages and colonization of the mouse intestine. An ibeA deletion mutant strain (NRG857cΔibeA) was constructed, and the in vitro effect on AIEC adhesion and invasion of nonpolarized and polarized Caco-2 cells, the adhesion and transcytosis of M-like cells, the intracellular survival in THP-1 macrophages, and the contribution to intestinal colonization of the CD-1 murine model of infection were evaluated. A significant reduction in invasion was observed with the ibeA mutant in Caco-2 and M-like cells, whereas adhesion was not affected. Complementation of the mutant reestablished Caco-2 invasive phenotype to wild-type levels. Reduction in invasion did not significantly affect transcytosis through M-like cells at early time points. The absence of ibeA significantly affected AIEC intramacrophage survival up to 24 h postinfection. No significant changes associated with IbeA were found in AIEC colonization across the murine gastrointestinal tract, but a slight reduction of gamma interferon was observed in the ceca of mice infected with the ibeA mutant. In addition, a decrease in the pathology scores was observed in the ilea and ceca of mice infected with the ibeA mutant.

However, its large variability hampers its usefulness in modelling transport processes as well as its accuracy in representing soil-radionuclide interactions. For the specific case of radiocaesium, the analyses of a Cs Kd soil dataset (769 entries) showed that values varied over a five order of magnitude range, and the resulting Cs Kd best estimate (calculated as a geometric mean = 2.5 × 103 L kg-1) lacked reliability and representativity. Grouping data and creation of partial datasets based on the experimental approach (short-term (< ~1 yr) vs. long-term experiments (> ~1 yr)) and soil factors affecting Cs interaction (i.e., the ratio of the radiocaesium interception potential (RIP) to the potassium content in soil solution (Kss); organic matter content (OM) and soil texture) succeeded in reducing variability a few orders of magnitude, with Cs Kd best estimates also differing by one-two orders of magnitude depending on the type of soil and experimental approach. The statistical comparison of the Cs Kd best estimates and related cumulative distribution functions of the partial datasets revealed a relevant effect of the sorption dynamics on Cs Kd values (with long-term values systematically higher than short-term ones), and that the RIP/Kss ratio was an excellent predictor of Cs Kd for short-term scenarios, whereas the RIP parameter could be predicted on the basis of texture information. The OM threshold to distinguish between OM threshold to distinguish between Mineral and Organic soils subclasses, regarding Cs interaction was determined to be 50% and 90% OM for short- and long-term scenarios, respectively. It was then recommended to select the Cs Kd input data depending on the soils and scenarios to be assessed (e.g., short- vs. long-term; OM %) to improve the reliability and decrease the uncertainty of the radioecological models.","Ramírez-Guinart, Oriol; Kaplan, Daniel; Rigol, Anna; Vidal, Miquel",Journal of environmental radioactivity,200,2

The meta-analysis was done using a random-effects model to assess the pooled estimate of HPV uptake. CRD42021218429. Findings During 2008-2020, an estimated 3.3 million females received at least one dose of HPV vaccine with 61.69% of the target population vaccinated. In countries with high uptake, the pooled estimate of uptake was higher in females than males (45.48% vs 8.45%) and showed significant decline in 2015-2020 compared to 2006-2014 (89.03% vs 41.48%).

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) represents approximately 90% of all cases of primary liver cancer. The main risk factors for developing HCC are well known and include hepatitis B and C virus infection, alcohol intake and ingestion of the fungal metabolite aflatoxin B1. Additional risk factors such as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis are also emerging. Advances in the understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of HCC have led to identification of critical driver mutations; however, the most prevalent of these are not yet druggable targets. The molecular classification of HCC is not established, and the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer staging classification is the main clinical algorithm for the stratification of patients according to prognosis and treatment allocation. Surveillance programmes enable the detection of early-stage tumours that are amenable to curative therapies - resection, liver transplantation or local ablation. At more developed stages, only chemoembolization (for intermediate HCC) and sorafenib (for advanced HCC) have shown survival benefits. There are major unmet needs in HCC management that might be addressed through the discovery of new therapies and their combinations for use in the adjuvant setting and for intermediate- and advanced-stage disease. Moreover, biomarkers for therapy stratification, patient-tailored strategies targeting driver mutations and/or activating signalling cascades, and validated measurements of quality of life are needed. Recent failures in the testing of systemic drugs for intermediate and advanced stages have indicated a need to refine trial designs and to define novel approaches.","Llovet, Josep M; Zucman-Rossi, Jessica; Pikarsky, Eli; Sangro, Bruno; Schwartz, Myron; Sherman, Morris; Gores, Gregory",Nature reviews.

However, the role of BKPyV integration on oncogenesis is still unclear. In this study, next-generation virome capture sequencing of primary and metastatic tumors were performed in three patients with BKPyV-associated urothelial carcinoma after renal transplantation. As a result, a total of 332 viral integration sites were identified in the six tumors. Integration of BKPyV in both primary and metastatic tumors followed the mechanism of microhomology-mediated end joining mostly, since microhomologies between human and BKPyV genomes were significantly enriched in flanking regions of 84% of the integration sites. Viral DNA breakpoints were nonrandom and tended to assemble in large T gene, small T gene and viral protein 2 gene. There were three, one and one consensus integration sites between the primary and metastatic tumors, which affected LINC01924, eIF3c, and NEIL2 genes in the three cases respectively. Thus, we concluded that integration of BKPyV was a continuous process occurring in both primary and metastatic tumors, generating heterogenous tumor cell populations. Through this ongoing process, certain cell populations might have gained growth advantage or metastatic potential, as a result of viral integration either affecting the cellular genes where the viral DNA integrated to or altering the expression or function of the viral genes.","Wang, Yuchen; Liu, Yanna; Deng, Wenfeng; Fu, Fangxiang; Yan, Susha; Yang, Hongwei; Liu, Rumin; Geng, Jian; Xu, Jian; Wu, Yihan; Ma, Junfeng; Zhou, Jiapeng; Liu, Na; Jin, Yu; Xia, Renfei; Elias, Nahel; Lee, Richard J; Feldman, Adam S; Blute, Michael L; Colvin, Robert B; Wu, Chin-Lee; Miao, Yun",Oncogene,200,1

To date, the HSV disease remains incurable and challenging to prevent. The disease is extremely widespread due to its high infection rate, resulting in millions of infection cases worldwide. AREAS COVERED This review first explains the diverse forms of HSV-related disease presentations and reports past vaccine history for the disease. Next, this review examines current and novel HSV vaccine approaches being studied and tested for efficacy and safety as well as vaccines in clinical trial phases I to III. Modern approaches to vaccine design using bioinformatics are described. Lastly, we discuss measures to enhance new vaccine development pipelines for HSV. EXPERT OPINION : Modernized approaches using in silico analysis and bioinformatics are emerging methods that exhibit potential for producing vaccines with enhanced targets and formulations. Although not yet fully established for HSV disease, we describe current studies using these approaches for HSV vaccine design to shed light on these methods. In addition, we provide up-to-date requirements of immunogenicity, adjuvant selection and routes of administration.","Wijesinghe, Vindya Nilakshi; Farouk, Isra Ahmad; Zabidi, Nur Zawanah; Puniyamurti, Ashwini; Choo, Wee Sim; Lal, Sunil Kumar",Expert review of vaccines,200,1

Though initially described as simple single-gene non-segmented viruses encoding RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), a subset of narnaviruses referred to as ""ambigrammatic"" harbor a unique genomic configuration consisting of overlapping open reading frames (ORFs) encoded on opposite strands. Phylogenetic analysis supports selection to maintain this unusual genome organization, but functional investigations are lacking. Here, we establish the mosquito-infecting Culex narnavirus 1 (CxNV1) as a model to investigate the functional role of overlapping ORFs in narnavirus replication. In CxNV1, a reverse ORF without homology to known proteins covers nearly the entire 3.2 kb segment encoding the RdRp. Additionally, two opposing and nearly completely overlapping novel ORFs are found on the second putative CxNV1 segment, the 0.8 kb ""Robin"" RNA. We developed a system to launch CxNV1 in a naïve mosquito cell line, then showed that functional RdRp is required for persistence of both segments, and an intact reverse ORF is required on the RdRp segment for persistence. Mass spectrometry of persistently CxNV1-infected cells provided evidence for translation of this reverse ORF. Finally, ribosome profiling yielded a striking pattern of footprints for all four CxNV1 RNA strands that was distinct from actively-translating ribosomes on host mRNA or co-infecting RNA viruses. Taken together, these data raise the possibility that the process of translation itself is important for persistence of ambigrammatic narnaviruses, potentially by protecting viral RNA with ribosomes, thus suggesting a heretofore undescribed viral tactic for replication and transmission.IMPORTANCEFundamental to our understanding of RNA viruses is a description of which strand(s) of RNA are transmitted as the viral genome, relative to which encode the viral proteins. Ambigrammatic narnaviruses break the mold. These viruses, found broadly in fungi, plants, and insects, have the unique feature of two overlapping genes encoded on opposite strands, comprising nearly the full length of the viral genome. Such extensive overlap is not seen in other RNA viruses, and comes at the cost of reduced evolutionary flexibility in the sequence. The present study is motivated by investigating the benefits which balance that cost. We show for the first time a functional requirement for the ambigrammatic genome configuration in Culex narnavirus 1, which suggests a model for how translation of both strands might benefit this virus. Our work highlights a new blueprint for viral persistence, distinct from strategies defined by canonical definitions of the coding strand.","Retallack, Hanna; Popova, Katerina D; Laurie, Matthew T; Sunshine, Sara; DeRisi, Joseph L",Journal of virology,200,30

Median response for all cohorts for the PG care provider and overall experience responses were ""very good,"" and no differences were identified between cohorts. Patient satisfaction with their TM experience was high with median satisfaction scores for arranging and connecting to a TM visit, talking with the provider over a video connection, and having the provider understand the clinical problem were ""very good."" Patients in the TM cohort reported no difference in preference for face-to-face or TM visits. CONCLUSIONS Patients are satisfied with TM as a substitute for face-to-face visits suggesting that TM can possibly be used to deliver comparable patient experience for hand surgery encounters.","Bartoletta, John J; Hinchcliff, Katharine M; Rhee, Peter C",Hand,200,20

METHODS Review of 40 consecutive patients who underwent semirigid pleuroscopy by a pulmonary fellow under the supervision of a pulmonologist. RESULTS Pleuroscopy was performed for diagnosis of pleural effusion (n=33), or treatment of pleural effusion (n=4) or pneumothorax (n=3). The mean age±SD of the patients was 58.23±12.98 years and 23 patients were male. Pleuroscopy was performed with a flex-rigid pleuroscope under local anesthesia and conscious sedation. An ultrasound was used to choose the entry site. The dose of midazolam and fentanyl used was 6.45±2.87 mg and 173.39±77.17 mcg, respectively. The duration of the procedure was 69.3±25.3 minutes. The amount of pleural fluid removed was 1.5±0.94 L. The overall diagnostic accuracy of pleuroscopy was 87.8%, and the sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive value for malignancy was 93.9%, 100%, 92.3% and 100%, respectively. There were a few complications: desaturation (n=2), hypotension (n=5), extensive subcutaneous emphysema (n=3), and persistent air leak (n=1). There was no case of significant bleeding or death from the procedure. Six of the 7 cardiopulmonary complications occurred during the first 4 procedures performed by the fellows. CONCLUSIONS The diagnostic accuracy of pleuroscopy remains high in the hands of pulmonary fellows. However, the procedure can be associated with a slightly higher rate of complications when performed by fellows in training, especially in the early part of their learning curve. Most of the few complications observed were not caused by the procedure per se and resulted from over-zealous use of medications for conscious sedation.","Shujaat, Adil; Bajwa, Abubakr A; Usman, Faisal; Jones, Lisa; Cury, James D",Journal of bronchology & interventional pulmonology,200,17

Therefore, it is likely that individuals with chronic diseases may worry during this pandemic to the detriment of their mental health. This study compares the mental health of Bangladeshi adults affected by chronic disease to a healthy, matched control group during the COVID-19 pandemic. SUBJECTS AND METHODS A matched case-control analysis was performed with data collected from 395 respondents with chronic diseases and 395 controls matched for age, gender, and residence. Inclusion criteria for cases were respondents who self-reported having asthma, cardiovascular disease symptoms and/or diabetes. Respondents were recruited using an online survey, which included the DASS-21 measure to assess symptoms of stress, anxiety, and depression. Chi-square test, t-test, Fisher's exact test and a conditional logistic regression were performed to examine associations among variables. RESULTS The prevalence of anxiety symptoms and depression symptoms and the level of stress were significantly higher among cases (59%; 71.6%; 73.7%, respectively) than among controls (25.6%; 31.1%; 43.3%, respectively). Chi-square and t-test showed significant associations and differences between having chronic diseases and mental health outcomes. A conditional logistic regression showed that respondents with asthma, diabetes, cardiovascular disease symptoms, or any combination of these diseases had higher odds of exhibiting symptoms of stress, anxiety, and depression than healthy individuals. CONCLUSION These results underscore a subpopulation vulnerable to mental health consequences during this pandemic and indicate the need for additional mental health resources to be available to those with chronic diseases.","Sayeed, Abu; Kundu, Satyajit; Al Banna, Md Hasan; Christopher, Enryka; Hasan, M Tasdik; Begum, Musammet Rasheda; Chowdhury, Sukanta; Khan, Md Shafiqul Islam",Psychiatria Danubina,200,1

Formation of such specialized virus-induced cellular microenvironments, which have been termed viroplasms, virus factories, or virus replication centers, complexes, or compartments, depends on molecular interactions between viral and cellular factors that participate in viral genome expression and replication and are in some cases associated with sites of virion assembly. These virus-induced compartments function not only to recruit and concentrate factors required for essential steps of the viral replication cycle but also to control the cellular mechanisms of antiviral defense.

RECENT FINDINGS COVID-19 has high morbidity and mortality for transplant candidates; interestingly, posttransplant comorbidities play a larger role than immunosuppression status. COVID-19 therapies and vaccinations are well tolerated in pre and postliver transplant patients with few exceptions, although further research is needed regarding effectiveness in this patient population. Provider practice patterns should evolve to minimize contagion during the current pandemic and prepare for an increase in liver disease due to after-shocks of missed diagnosis and progression of liver disease. SUMMARY COVID-19 has spurred new research and technologies to ensure the safety of liver transplant candidates, recipients, and donors, and most COVID-19 therapies are safe in this patient population. Further work needs to be done regarding the use of COVID-19 positive organs and the efficacy of vaccines in the transplant population.","Hutchison, Alan L; Pillai, Anjana",Current opinion in organ transplantation,200,11

However, macromolecules with a regular (P─C) n chain have never been unambiguously identified. Here, we demonstrate that addition polymerization, a general concept to polymerize olefins, can be extended to P═C double bonds. The polymerization of monomeric 2-phosphanaphthalenes is mediated by copper(I) halides and leads to polycarbophosphanes with an M n of 14 to 34 kDa. Each phosphorus is coordinated to Cu(I), which can be easily removed. Unlike long-term durable polyolefins, the metal-free polymers depolymerize rapidly back to monomers under sunlight or ultraviolet irradiation at λ = 365 nm. The monomers can be recycled for repolymerization, demonstrating a cradle-to-cradle life cycle for polycarbophosphanes.","Mei, Yanbo; Gamboa-Carballo, Juan José; Bao, Yinyin; Wu, Na; Le Corre, Grégoire; Grützmacher, Hansjörg",Science advances,200,1

In this work, we modified buffers and cosolvents to obtain a stable, nearly iso-osmolal formulation and evaluated its safety and efficacy against SHIV-RT and HSV-2. In vitro toxicity to lactobacilli and Candida albicans was determined. Macaques were given daily doses of ZA and CG (ZA/CG) or CG alone vaginally for 14 days and challenged with SHIV-RT 24 h later. Mice were challenged vaginally or rectally with HSV-2 immediately after a single gel treatment to measure efficacy or vaginally 12 h after daily gel treatment for 7 days to evaluate the gel's impact on susceptibility to HSV-2 infection. The modified ZA/CG neither affected the viability of lactobacilli or C. albicans nor enhanced vaginal HSV-2 infection after daily ZA/CG treatment. Vaginal SHIV-RT infection of macaques was reduced by 66% (P = 0.006) when macaques were challenged 24 h after the last dose of gel. We observed 60% to 80% uninfected mice after vaginal (P < 0.0001) and rectal (P = 0.008) high-dose HSV-2 challenge.

METHODS Two hundred thirty-five patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft and/or valvular surgery were enrolled at 8 US centers in this prospective observational study. NIRS (Invos™ 5100C; Covidien) was used to monitor rScO2 during surgery. The frequency and magnitude of rScO2 decrements >20% from preanesthesia baseline were documented, and the efficacy of a standard treatment algorithm for correcting rScO2 was determined. The data from the NIRS monitor were downloaded at the conclusion of surgery and sent to the coordinating center where the number of clinician-identified rScO2 desaturation events was compared with the number detected by the NIRS monitor. RESULTS The average rScO2 obtained at baseline (mean ± SD, 61% ± 11%; 99% confidence interval, 57%-65%) and during CPB (62% ± 14%; 57%-67%) was not different. However, rScO2 after separation from CPB (56% ± 11%; 53%-60%) was lower than measurements at baseline and during CPB (P < 0.001). During CPB, rScO2 desaturations occurred in 61% (99% confidence interval, 50%-75%) of patients. The area under the curve for product of magnitude and duration of the rScO2 was (mean ± SD, 145.2; 384.8% × min). Clinicians identified all patients with an rScO2 desaturation but identified only 340 (89.5%) of the 380 total desaturation events. Of the 340 clinician-identified rScO2 desaturation events, 115 resolved with usual clinical care before implementation of the treatment algorithm. For the remaining 225 events, the treatment algorithm resulted in resolution of the rScO2 desaturation in all but 18 patients. CONCLUSIONS This multicenter pilot study found that 50% to 75% of patients undergoing cardiac surgery experience one or more rScO2 desaturations during CPB. Nearly 10% of desaturation events were not identified by clinicians, suggesting that appropriate alarming systems should be adopted to alert clinicians of such events. The intervention algorithm was effective in reversing clinically identified rScO2 desaturations in the majority of events.","Subramanian, Balachundhar; Nyman, Charles; Fritock, Maria; Klinger, Rebecca Y; Sniecinski, Roman; Roman, Philip; Huffmyer, Julie; Parish, Michelle; Yenokyan, Gayane; Hogue, Charles W",Anesthesia and analgesia,200,1

Among the differential diagnoses of respiratory failure, tension pneumothorax is a life-threatening disease that requires immediate invasive intervention to drain the air from the thoracic cavity. However, other etiologies with manifestations similar to those of tension pneumothorax should also be considered after whole-stomach esophagectomy for esophageal cancer. We report a rare case of a patient with thoracic stomach syndrome mimicking tension pneumothorax after esophagectomy with whole-stomach reconstruction. CASE PRESENTATION A 49-year-old Asian woman was admitted to our intensive care unit after esophagectomy for esophageal cancer with whole-stomach reconstruction while under sedation and intubated. Despite initial stable vital signs, the patient rapidly developed tachypnea, low blood pressure, and low oxygen saturation. Chest radiography revealed a mediastinal shift and led to a presumptive diagnosis of tension pneumothorax. Hence, an aspiration catheter was inserted into the right pleural space. However, her clinical symptoms did not improve. Chest computed tomography was performed, which revealed a significantly distended reconstructed stomach that was compressing the nearby lung parenchyma. Her respiration improved immediately after nasogastric tube placement. After the procedure, we successfully extubated the patient. CONCLUSIONS Similar to tension pneumothorax, thoracic stomach syndrome requires immediate drainage of air from the thoracic cavity. However, unlike tension pneumothorax, this condition requires nasogastric tube insertion, which is the only way to safely remove the accumulated air and avoid possible complications that could occur due to percutaneous drainage. For patient safety, it might be clinically important to place nasogastric tubes after esophagectomy with whole-stomach reconstruction, even if radiographic guidance is required. In addition, clinicians should consider thoracic stomach syndrome as one of the differential diagnoses of respiratory failure after whole-stomach esophagectomy.","Hasegawa, Daisuke; Komura, Hidefumi; Katsuta, Ken; Kawaji, Takahiro; Nishida, Osamu",Journal of medical case reports,200,20

PATIENTS AND METHODS Complications, re-operations, renal function, and continence were ascertained from patient charts. Outcome variables were validated by a second and independent review of the patient files. RESULTS A complication of Clavien-Dindo grade ≥III, including unscheduled re-admissions, occurred in 45/193 patients (23%) at ≤90 days of surgery. At a median follow-up of 13 years, 105/193 patients (54%) had undergone at least one re-operation, with uretero-intestinal stricture being the most prevalent cause [28 patients (15%)]. Re-operations were more prevalent in patients operated during the first half of the study period than during the second half (2000-2007; 62% vs 47%; P = 0.03), and they were also more frequent in patients who underwent surgery for benign causes than in patients who underwent surgery for malignancy (60% vs 51%; P = 0.04). Continence was achieved in 172/188 patients (91%). In all, 16% of all patients required revisional surgery of the outlet to remain continent with an easily catheterisable pouch or to address stomal stenosis. The mean decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate was more pronounced in patients with benign indications for urinary diversion than in those with malignancies, even after adjusting for younger age at surgery and longer follow-up in the former group (22 vs 11 mL/min/1.73 m2 ; P < 0.006). A disinterested third-party assessment revealed 10 postoperative complications, 17 re-operations during follow-up, and seven occasions of hospitalisation due to pyelonephritis (included in data above) not recorded at the primary data review. CONCLUSIONS The Lundiana pouch is associated with a high risk of re-operation, although the functional results are good. Independent review by a third party increased the validity of the outcome data.","Liedberg, Fredrik; Gudjonsson, Sigurdur; Xu, Abai; Bendahl, Pär-Ola; Davidsson, Thomas; Månsson, Wiking",BJU international,200,1

Retrospective analysis of patients admitted to the GO service at a single academic institution in 2019 showed that compliance with recommendations for ACP documentation was suboptimal. We initiated a quality improvement initiative from January through September 2020 to improve our compliance. Patients admitted to the GO service were given ACP packets with a letter-based advance directive (AD) worksheet modeled after the Stanford Letter Project. In January and February 2020, patients who were interested in learning more about ACP were visited by medical students trained to lead ACP conversations. From March through September 2020, students were unavailable to facilitate in-person ACP conversations due to COVID-19 restrictions. Pre and post-intervention ACP documentation of patients admitted to the GO service were analyzed. Descriptive statistics were calculated, and associations between sociodemographic characteristics and ACP documentation were analyzed using logistic regression. Since implementation of the letter-based ACP intervention, 98 patients were admitted to the GO service. The majority of those admitted had cancer (n=60, 61%). Only 16 patients (16%) had an AD on admission, and 65 patients (66%) reported never having an ACP conversation. Of 82 patients without ADs, 71 (87%) received an ACP packet. Of those receiving packets, 8 (11%) requested more information about ACP and 6 (8%) participated in an ACP conversation with a student. At 9-month follow-up among patients receiving a packet, 9 patients added an AD to their EMR (13%), and 2 updated their AD (3%). After the intervention, AD completion in our population went from 16% to 26%. Among those receiving ACP packets, increasing age was associated with increased post-admission AD completion (OR 1.1, p=0.01). Completion of AD among patients continues to be low. Barriers to AD completion include patient and provider reluctance surrounding discussing these issues and difficulty with uploading these documents into the EMR. Letter-based ADs offer a unique method for introducing ACP earlier in cancer care and may lead to increased conversations about patient values and goals of care. More work is needed to improve occurrence and documentation of ACP conversations.

Most discussions around immunity- or infection-based documentation policies have focused on scientific plausibility, economic benefit, and challenges relating to ethics and equity. As COVID-19 vaccines are rolled out, attention has turned to confirmation of immunity and how documentation such as vaccine certificates or immunity passports can be implemented. However, the contextual inequities and local variabilities interacting with COVID-19 related documentation policies hinder a one-size-fits-all approach. In this Comment, we argue that social science perspectives can and should provide additional insight into these issues, through a diverse range of current and historical examples. This would enable policymakers and researchers to better understand and mitigate current and longer-term differential impacts of COVID-19 immunity-based documentation policies in different contexts. Furthermore, social science research methods can uniquely provide feedback to inform adjustments to policy implementation in real-time and help to document how these policy measures are felt differently across communities, populations, and countries, potentially for years to come. This Comment, updated as of 15 August 2021, combines precedents established in historical disease outbreaks and current experiences with COVID-19 immunity-based documentation policies to highlight valuable lessons and an acute need for further social science research which should inform effective and context-appropriate future public health policy and action.","Dada, Sara Battles Heather Pilbeam Caitlin Singh Bhagteshwar Solomon Tom Gobat Nina",Humanities & Social Sciences Communications,200,7

This is expressed, among other things, in the multitude of approaches to this concept. These approaches differ based on the emphasis placed on individual aspects: some focus more on technology, and others put more weight on social issues, while still others value sustainable development issues. Currently, an important topic of discussion about the development of the smart city—the importance of which has become even greater in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic—is the digital transformation of the city. The use of robotic process automation (RPA) tools can be a part of such a transformation, as such tools, using advanced software, enable the automation of those tasks carried out thus far by humans. Although such an approach has, to date, been widespread in the case of enterprises (in particular, those operating in the financial and BPO/SSC sectors, but less often in the utilities sector, the first applications of these solutions in the context of process automation for cities are also beginning to emerge in various parts of the world. This article is based on a case study approach. The implementation conditions (including the constraints) of such an approach, the benefits achieved, and the lessons learned (which can be important for other local government units) are outlined using the example of the Bydgoszcz city hall’s (Poland) electricity billing document management. The results of the case study presented here lead to the conclusion that the use of RPA tools enables, very quickly and at relatively low cost, measurable results to be achieved that are related to the processing of electricity billing documentation for the city of Bydgoszcz. This allows the assertion to be made that robotic process automation can be taken into consideration as one of the tools used to build smart cities.","Sobczak, Andrzej Ziora Leszek",Energies,200,16

Lithium is used as a mood stabilizer to treat patients with bipolar disorder. Here, the aim was to investigate the association between lithium use and the risk of respiratory infections in patients with bipolar disorder. To rule out the possibility that a potential association could be due to lithium's effect on psychiatric symptoms, we also studied the effect of the most common alternative to lithium to prevent mood episodes in bipolar disorder, valproate. Method: We followed 51,509 individuals diagnosed with bipolar disorder in the Swedish Patient register 2005-2013. We applied a with-individual design using stratified Cox regression to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) of respiratory infections during treated periods compared with untreated periods. Results: During follow-up, 5,760 respiratory infections were documented in the Swedish Patient Register. The incidence rate was 28% lower during lithium treatment (HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.61-0.86) and 35% higher during valproate treatment (HR 1.35, 95% CI 1.06-1.73) compared with periods off treatment. Conclusions: This study provides real-world evidence that lithium protects against respiratory infections and suggests that the repurposing potential of lithium for antiviral effects is worthy of investigation.","Landen, M.; Lichtenstein, P.; Larsson, H.; Song, J.",,200,5

Regulation of CSF dynamics is critical for maintaining CNS health, and increased pulsatile CSF dynamics may alter brain’s waste clearance due to increased mixing and diffusion. As such, understanding the mechanisms driving CSF movement, and interventions that influence its resultant removal of wastes from the brain is of high scientific and clinical impact. Since pulsatile CSF dynamics is sensitive and synchronous to respiratory movements, we are interested in identifying potential integrative therapies such as yogic breathing to regulate and enhance CSF dynamics, which has not been reported before. Here, we investigated the pre-intervention baseline data from our ongoing randomized controlled trial, and examined whether yogic breathing immediately impacts pulsatile CSF dynamics compared to spontaneous breathing. We utilized our previously established non-invasive real-time phase contrast magnetic resonance imaging (RT-PCMRI) approach using a 3T MRI instrument, and computed and rigorously tested differences in CSF velocities (instantaneous, respiratory, cardiac 1st and 2nd harmonics) at the level of foramen magnum during spontaneous versus four yogic breathing patterns. In examinations of 18 healthy participants (eight females, ten males; mean age 34.9 ± 14 (SD) years; age range: 18-61 years), we discovered immediate increase in cranially-directed velocities of instantaneous-CSF 16% - 28% and respiratory-CSF 60% - 118% during yogic versus spontaneous breathing, with most statistically significant changes during deep abdominal breathing (28%, p=0.0008, and 118%, p=0.0001, respectively). Further, cardiac pulsation was the primary source of pulsatile CSF during all breathing conditions except during deep abdominal breathing, when there was a comparable contribution of respiratory and cardiac 1st harmonic power [0.59 ± 0.78], demonstrating respiration can be the primary regulator of CSF depending on individual differences in breath depth and location. Further work is needed to investigate the impact of sustained training yogic breathing on increased pulsatile CSF dynamics and brain waste clearance for CNS health.","Yildiz, Selda; Grinstead, John; Hildebrand, Andrea; Oshinski, John; Rooney, William D.; Lim, Miranda M.; Oken, Barry",bioRxiv,200,24

Here we report that isolated FP of influenza virus are membrane active by themselves generating pores in giant unilamellar vesicles and thus potentially explain both influenza virus’ hemolytic activity and structure in cryo-electron tomography. Molecular dynamics simulations of asymmetric bilayers with different numbers of FP in one leaflet show substantial peptide clustering. At the center of this peptide condensate a profound change in the membrane structure results in thinning, higher water permeability, and curvature. In effect, a hybrid bilayer forms locally with one lipid monolayer and one peptide monolayer. Membrane elastic theory predicts that the energy landscape becomes favorable for spontaneous pore formation in this novel structure, consistent with the inhibition of pore formation by cholesterol observed experimentally.","Haldar, Sourav; Rice, Amy; Wang, Eric; Blank, Paul S.; Akimov, Sergey A.; Galimzyanov, Timur R.; Pastor, Richard W.; Zimmerberg, Joshua",bioRxiv,200,1

Initially, purified virion particles were characterized with Raman spectroscopy, synchrotron infrared (IR) and AFM‐IR. A data set comprising 171 transflection infrared spectra from 29 subjects testing positive for SARS‐CoV‐2 by RT‐qPCR and 28 testing negative, was modeled using Monte Carlo Double Cross Validation with 50 randomized test and model sets. The testing sensitivity was 93 % (27/29) with a specificity of 82 % (23/28) that included positive samples on the limit of detection for RT‐qPCR.

Telemedicine (TM) follow-up is a reasonable option. Despite the recent exponential increase in application worldwide, there is no study examining the clinical factors associated with the patients' choice of TM use in lupus nephritis. Objectives: In this study, we aimed to examine the clinical variables associated with a higher preference for TM follow-up in patients with lupus nephritis. Methods: Consecutive patients followed at the lupus nephritis clinic were contacted for their preferred mode of follow-up. The demographic, socioeconomic and clinical data of the first 140 patients opted for TM and 140 patients preferred to continue standard in-person follow-up were collected and compared. Results: The mean age of the 280 recruited patients was 45.6 ± 11.8 years. The mean disease duration was 15.0 ± 9.2 years. The majority of them had lupus nephritis class III, IV or V (88.2%) and were on prednisolone (90%). Three quarters of the patients (67.1%) were on immunosuppressants. The mean SLEDAI-2k was 4.06 ± 2.54, physician global assessment (PGA) 0.46 ± 0.62 and SLICC/ ACR damage index 1.11 ± 1.36. A significant proportion of the patients (72.1%) had one or more comorbidities. It was found that patients with higher PGA and family monthly income (≥ USD3,800) preferred TM, while fulltime employees preferred in-person follow-up (Table 1). These predictors remained significant after controlling for age in the multivariate analysis with odd ratios for PGA 1.05 (95% CI 1.01-1.09), family income ≥USD3,800 1.90 (95% CI 1.24-3.79) and fulltime employment 0.53 (95% CI 0.32-0.88). PGA was noted to be positively correlated with the perceptions that TM reduces (r=0.13, p=0.036) and routine visit increases (r=0.12, p=0.04) the risk of COVID-19 during the outbreak. Conclusion: When choosing the mode of care delivery between TM and clinic visit, the patient's disease activity as well as employment and economic status appeared to be important.","So, H.; Chow, E.; Li, T.

We collected COPUS and E-COPUS data from 40 STEM courses before, during the transition, and continuation of emergency remote teaching (ERT). Through weekly discussions among observers, we adjusted six of the original instructor COPUS code descriptions and six of the original student code descriptions to fit the online learning environment. We trained 23 observers to conduct E-COPUS utilizing both in-person and online lecture recordings. To validate E- COPUS, we consulted an expert panel of science educators and education researchers to provide feedback on our code descriptions and complete a matching activity with our E-COPUS code descriptions. We further examined E-COPUS by analyzing the teaching and learning practices of 6 instructors across in-person and online instruction and found that the online functions of breakout rooms, polling, and the chat were utilized to promote active learning activities in the online learning environment. As we prepare for teaching in the future, it is important to have formative assessment tools designed for all course formats to support assessment and improvement of teaching practices in college STEM classrooms.","Pusey, Téa S.; Valencia, Andrea Presas; Signorini, Adriana; Kranzfelder, Petra",bioRxiv,200,16

The research aims to know the implementation of WFH during the pandemic the use of communication technology the communication patterns during WFH have changed from face to face to computer mediated communication (CMC) and the important factors for the success of WFH. A qualitative method with a descriptive case study approach and a semi-structured interview technique are used. The theory is media richness theory. The results showed that WFH offered advantages and disadvantages for employees and organizations. WFH featured various types of technology/media from lean to rich. Communication technology plays an important role during WFH which causes changes in communication patterns. Different technologies/media vary in its ability to reproduce messages. During WFH CMC creates a different climate than face to face communication because CMC is not as rich as face to face communication. In implementing WFH even after the pandemic it is necessary to pay attention to the needs of organizations and employees and the main factors of successful WFH implementation so that WFH can be as effective as working in an office.,"Vidya, Putri Andhita; Irwansyah, Irwansyah",The Journal of Society and Media,200,24

The search is enabled by a contemporaneous timing ephemeris obtained using NICER data. The NICER ephemeris has also been extended through 2020 October and includes three new glitches. PSR J0537-6910 has the largest spin-down luminosity of any pulsar and is highly active with regards to glitches. Analyses of its long-term and inter-glitch braking indices provided intriguing evidence that its spin-down energy budget may include gravitational-wave emission from a time-varying mass quadrupole moment. Its 62 Hz rotation frequency also puts its possible gravitational-wave emission in the most sensitive band of LIGO/Virgo detectors. Motivated by these considerations, we search for gravitational-wave emission at both once and twice the rotation frequency. We find no signal, however, and report our upper limits. Assuming a rigidly rotating triaxial star, our constraints reach below the gravitational-wave spin-down limit for this star for the first time by more than a factor of two and limit gravitational waves from the $l=m=2$ mode to account for less than 14% of the spin-down energy budget. The fiducial equatorial ellipticity is limited to less than about 3e-5, which is the third best constraint for any young pulsar.","Collaboration, The LIGO Scientific; Collaboration, the Virgo; Abbott, the KAGRA Collaboration R.; Abbott, T.

Specifically we aim to connect discoveries from disparate laboratory experimentation in the area of trauma, blood loss and blood clotting using data science methods in a collaborative ensemble setting. Trauma related grave injuries cause exsanguination and death, constituting up to 50% of deaths especially in the armed forces. Restricting blood loss in such scenarios usually requires the presence of first responders, which is not feasible in certain cases. Moreover, a traumatic event may lead to a cytokine storm, reflected in the cytokine variables. Hemostatic nanoparticles have been developed to tackle these kinds of situations of trauma and blood loss. This paper highlights a collaborative effort of using data science methods in evaluating the outcomes from a lab study to further understand the efficacy of the nanoparticles. An intravenous administration of hemostatic nanoparticles was executed in pigs that had to undergo hemorrhagic shock and blood loss and other immune response variables, cytokine response variables are measured. Thus, through various hemostatic nanoparticles used in the intervention, multiple data outcomes are produced and it becomes critical to understand which nanoparticles are critical and what variables are key to study further variations in the lab. We propose a collaborative data mining framework which combines the results from multiple data mining methods to discover impactful features. We used frequent patterns observed in the data from these experiments. We further validate the connections between these frequent rules by comparing the results with decision trees and feature ranking. Both the frequent patterns and the decision trees help us identify the critical variables that stand out in the lab studies and need further validation and follow up in future studies. The outcomes from the data mining methods help produce a computational design map of the experimental results. Our preliminary results from such a computational design map provided insights in determining which features can help in designing the most effective hemostatic nanoparticles.","Kulkarni, Chhaya; Maisha, Nuzhat; Schaub, Leasha J; Glaser, Jacob; Lavik, Erin; Janeja, Vandana P.",bioRxiv,200,26

Sweden, however, took a different approach to many other nations and did not implement a nationwide lockdown, instead deciding on a more “holistic approach to public health”. The focus was on minimising transmission as much as possible, protecting those in risk groups, ensuring that the response strategies were sustainable long-term, mitigating other health concerns as a result of the response and that evidence-based methods were used as much as possible. At this stage, it is difficult to know how exactly the Swedish strategy has fared in comparison to other responses. In Sweden, there has been much debate about the strategy, particularly concerning the protection of the elderly due to unexpectedly high mortality rates in the older population as well as among residents in retirement homes.

It is associated with many complications including extreme systemic inflammatory response which eventually causes acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), hypercoagulability, cytokine storm, failure of vital organs, and a high incidence of death. Bacterial secondary infection is possibly involved, in such cases, the role of antibiotics is justified. However, some antibiotics may have a role beyond the management of secondary infection. The current review discussed the potential antiviral effects of certain Fluoroquinolones (FQs) against SARS CoV-2 viruses. Several mechanisms such as targeting Main proteases and acting as zinc ionophore are discussed. Also explained their unique features, good access to lung tissues for suppression of inflammatory response via modulation of matrix metallopeptidases (MMPs) are explored. Their role in secondary infections, pharmacokinetics, and safety issues was briefly explored. The promising favorable features of FQs along with their efficacy in the management of secondary infections, highlights the need to consider these important antibiotics for more research as well as clinical trials in the management of COVID-19.","Damanhouri, Z.

To date, at least to the best of our knowledge, only a limited number of studies have identified SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). Due to the lack of knowledge of the long-term effects of COVID-19, the present study presents the hematological alterations in a patient with SCD during hospitalization due to COVID-19 and for up to 180 days following SARS-CoV-2 clearance and hospital discharge. The present study describes the case of a patient with SCD who was diagnosed with moderate COVID-19 infection, without the need for invasive mechanical ventilation. Following SARS-CoV-2 clearance, long-term (6 months) follow-up identified an increase in the reticulocyte frequency, creatinine and D-dimer levels. On the whole, the present study manuscript presents the case of a patient with moderate COVID-19 infection with long-term laboratory alterations at even 6 months following SARS-CoV-2 clearance. Further investigations are required however, to focus on the long-term evaluations in patients who have recovered from COVID-19, in order to fully determine the extension of possible sequelae. © 2021 CELOM.

The outbreak of this disease has reached such a huge number that all the countries witnessed lockdown in some form or the other. Some people have witnessed destruction of mankind while some have even leisured this time to their fullest but as it has been always said ""Prevention is better than cure"". Prevention of covid 19 in all the nations was one of the major steps which was taken in the year 2020. In India it all started in the year of 2019 December when the first ever case of covid 19 was reported in the state of Kerala followed by Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Delhi. Following such a situation and then sudden increase in the no of cases all over the country a major decision was taken that was of Complete lockdown excluding the emergency and essential services. Before taking the step of lockdown, as a gesture of respect to the frontline workers, government of India announced Tali Bajao movement. In the period of lockdown Certain norms were even made mandatory that were wearing a mask, maintenance of hand sanitation and following social distancing of 1.5 meters in public places. All the educational institutes and teachings were even suspended during the time period of lockdown as it could have become a hub for the virus to spread. With time, the restrictions which were laid down in lockdown were started to be reduced in the phase wise manner and finally India noticed its very first Unlock period.

Between 1st March and 31st August 2020 we investigated individuals who called the Scottish Ambulance Service (SAS) with COVID-19 symptoms and those that were later tested COVID-19 positive. We analysed i) their demographic and clinical characteristics;ii) their disposal;and iii) their admission and mortality outcomes.MethodsSAS and NHS Scotland Health Board data are routinely linked in a national database. These data evidence a patients journey from ambulance call to hospital attendance and subsequent outcome. Evidence of COVID-19 testing was identified 10 days either side of the call.Results171,169 patients made 257,207 calls during the study period. Of these, 2.8% (n=7,305) were categorised as possible COVID-19 patients during telephone triage. From the flagged +ve patient calls 6% had a COVID-19 positive result, 29% had a negative COVID-19 result and the other 65% had no evidence of being tested. The majority (54%) were taken to the Emergency Department;73% received further hospital care. The proportion of patient calls admitted within 10 days of the call was 31% for those not conveyed against 82% for conveyed. Final prehospital physiology for COVID-19 positive patients demonstrated lower oxygen saturations, higher respiratory rates and temperatures. 4.9% and 11.7% of patients conveyed to hospital died within 3 and 30 days vs 5.2% and 19.6% of patients not conveyed respectively.ConclusionsThis study suggests telephone triage is not a reliable identifier of COVID-19 patients reinforcing existing requirements for Personal Protective Equipment. 30-day mortality rates differed between those patients initially conveyed vs not conveyed. Clinical characteristics of COVID-19 positive patients suggest they were clinically less well than other patients.","Fitzpatrick, David Moore Matthew Best Catherine Andreis Federico Duncan Edward Esposito Martin Corfield Alasdair Dcobbie Richard Lowe David",Emergency Medicine Journal : EMJ,200,24

The review presents literature data on the efficacy and safety of certain basic anti-inflammatory and genetically engineered drugs in patients with COVID-19. Hydroxychloroquine is not indicated for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection of any severity due to the lack of therapeutic benefits, the likelihood of a worse prognosis in more severe patients and the development of adverse reactions, especially when used concomitantly with azithromycin. The use of systemic glucocorticoids (GC) in patients with COVID-19 who require oxygen support leads to a decrease in mortality and an improvement in the prognosis of the disease. However, the optimal time of administration, dose and duration of HA administration remain the subject of further research. Despite the encouraging data, it is too early to draw final conclusions about the feasibility of using tocilizumab in COVID-19, since no randomized clinical trials have demonstrated a clear advantage of the drug in terms of reducing mortality. The use of anakinra does not reduce the need for noninvasive / invasive lung ventilation or the mortality of patients with COVID-19. Two drugs from the group of tumor necrosis factor inhibitors – infliximab and adalimumabare currently being considered as possible treatment options for COVID-19. The use of a combination of baricitinib and remdesivir for the treatment of COVID-19 patients requiring oxygen support has been approved.

This study adopted a counterbal-anced experimental design to investigate the effects of test format, computerised presentation type, difficulty of item group, and administration order of item groups of different difficulty levels on examinees’ answering performance. In this study, 381 primary school fifth graders in northern Taiwan completed an achievement test on the topic of Structure and Functions of Plants, which is part of the primary school Natural Science course. The achievement test included 16 multiple-choice items. After data collection and analysis, no significant differences in the answering performance of examinees were identified among the PPT, CBT with single-item presentation, and CBT with mul-tiple-item presentation. However, after further analysis, the results indicated that the difficulty of item group and the administration order of item groups of different difficulty levels had significant influences on answering performance. The findings suggest that compared with a PPT, examinees exhibit better answering performance when taking multiple-choice tests in a CBT with multiple-item presentation. © 2021 by the authors.

Previous research has revealed a profound and wide range of psychosocial impacts on people at the individual, community, and international levels. On an individual level, people are likely to experience fear of falling sick or dying themselves, feelings of helplessness, and stigma. Currently, there is little understanding of mental well-being assessment under scenarios of pandemics that oblige to social isolation and quarantine.ObjectivesThis study aims to: a) establish the prevalence of psychiatric symptoms;b) identify risk and protective factors contributing to psychological stress;and c) identify coping strategies to promote better adjustment during and after the pandemic crisis.MethodsWe will adopt a mixed-method approach, firstly with a cross-sectional survey design (in both Portugal and Swiss context) to assess the higher education student’s psychosocial response during and after the pandemic, by using an anonymous online questionnaire. In a 2nd phase, and in order to gain more insight into the psychological stress faced by the students as a result of pandemic, a qualitative approach was chosen, focusing on the experiences of the participants.ResultsThis study has received ethical approval from both international and local institutional review boards.

Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) classified health-care professionals and exposure risk to coronavirus (COVID-19), identifying dental professionals in the very high-risk group due to the specificity of dental procedures and instrumentations used. Guidelines from relevant authorities suggested providing only emergency and urgent dental treatment during the pandemic which has led majority of dental practice to stop, thus instilling anxiety in the dental professionals. A study to assess the attitude, practice and experience of dental professionals from Gujarat state during the COVID-19 pandemic was planned. Materials and Methods: An online questionnaire consisting of 32 questions using Google Form was distributed to 315 dental professionals. Data obtained were analysed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences 22.0. Descriptive statistical analysis was used to describe variables. Chi-square test was used to find a significant association between parameters, and P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: Overall, 194 dental professionals (104 general dentists and 90 specialists) filled the questionnaire. Nearly half of the participants (49.5%) said that personal protective equipment (PPE) is uncomfortable while performing dental procedures. The majority of them (86.6%) insisted on increasing the cost of dental treatments. Regarding new practices adapted during the pandemic, 53 dental professionals (27.3%) did not find teledentistry effective in resolving the patient's problem. Only 75 dental professionals (38.7%) followed all the screening criteria for patients. Fifty-nine participants (30.4%) got the COVID-19 test for patients requiring the aerosol-generating procedure. While 125 participants (64.4%) performed aerosol-generating procedures either in urgent/emergency cases or elective cases, only 115 (59.3%) used full PPE with an appropriate mask. One hundred and thirty-seven (70.6%) of them reported a decrease in income during the pandemic, while 74 (38.1%) suffered from anxiety and depression. Conclusion: Dental health-care providers are at the highest risk of contracting COVID-19. Thus, they should execute proposed precautionary measures more diligently. Regular training and screening of dental professionals should be undertaken by state regulatory bodies. Adapting and adhering to change in work protocols by dental professionals will ensure not only their safety but also their patients. The emergence of COVID-19 has been great learning for the field of dentistry, and the dental practice is going to change for the better.","Prajapati, A. S.; Kulkarni, P. R.; Shah, H. G.; Shah, D.

Recent studies have also shown that vaccines demonstrate reduced protection against symptomatic infection with SARS-CoV-2 variants. Here we integrate published data on in vitro neutralisation and clinical protection to understand and predict vaccine efficacy against existing SARS-CoV-2 variants. We find that neutralising activity against the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 is highly predictive of neutralisation of the VOC, with all vaccines showing a similar drop in neutralisation to the variants. Neutralisation levels remain strongly correlated with protection from infection with SARS-CoV-2 VOC (r=0.81, p=0.0005). We apply an existing model relating in vitro neutralisation to protection (parameterised on data from ancestral virus infection) and find this remains predictive of vaccine efficacy against VOC once drops in neutralisation to the VOC are taken into account. Modelling of predicted vaccine efficacy against variants over time suggests that protection against symptomatic infection may drop below 50% within the first year after vaccination for some current vaccines. Boosting of previously infected individuals with existing vaccines (which target ancestral virus) has been shown to significantly increase neutralising antibodies. Our modelling suggests that booster vaccination should enable high levels of immunity that prevent severe infection outcomes with the current SARS-CoV-2 VOC, at least in the medium term.","Cromer, D.; Steain, M.; Reynaldi, A.; Schlub, T.

Though previous studies genetic mapping studies using classical inbred strains have identified several and quantitative trait locus (QTL) and candidate genes underlying responses to O3 exposure, precise mechanisms of susceptibility remain incompletely described. We sought to expand our understanding of the genetic architecture of O3 responsiveness using the Collaborative Cross (CC) recombinant inbred mouse panel, which contains more genetic diversity than previous inbred strain panels. We evaluated hallmark O3-induced respiratory phenotypes in 56 CC strains after exposure to filtered air or 2 ppm O3, and performed focused genetic analysis of variation in lung injury as measured by the total bronchoalveolar lavage protein concentration. Because animals were exposed in sex- and batch-matched pairs, we defined a protein response phenotype as the difference in lavage protein between the O3- and FA-exposed animal within a pair. The protein response phenotype was heritable, and QTL mapping revealed two novel loci on Chromosomes 10 (peak: 26.2 Mb; 80% CI: 24.6-43.6 Mb) and 15 (peak: 47.1 Mb; 80% CI: 40.2-54.9 Mb), the latter surpassing the 95% significance threshold. At the Chr. 15 locus, C57BL/6J and CAST/EiJ founder haplotypes were associated with higher protein responses compared to all other CC founder strain haplotypes. Using additional statistical analysis and high-density SNP data, we delimited the Chr. 15 QTL to a ∼2 Mb region containing 21 genes (10 protein coding). Using a weight of evidence approach that incorporated candidate variant analysis, functional annotations, and publicly available lung gene expression data, we nominated three candidate genes (Oxr1, Rspo2, and Angpt1). In summary, we have shown that O3-induced lung injury is modulated by genetic variation and demonstrated the value of the CC for uncovering and dissecting gene-environment interactions.","Tovar, Adelaide; Smith, Gregory J.; Thomas, Joseph M.; McFadden, Kathryn M.; Kelada, Samir N.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has reported many mortalities from this disease all around the world. Therefore, recognizing new cases of COVID-19 is crucial during this pandemic. Many studies have shown that COVID-19 has a broad spectrum of signs and symptoms, including GI and cutaneous manifestations. Previous studies have reported liver enzyme changes as well as diarrhea as a common GI manifestation of COVID-19. However, there are few reports about COVID-19 synchronous cutaneous and liver involvement. Additionally, there are few reports about intrahepatic cholestasis in COVID-19 patients. In this article, a confirmed case of COVID-19 with vasculopathy-related cutaneous manifestation and liver cholestasis is reported. A 67-year-old Iranian woman was admitted to Taleghani Hospital with epigastric pain, vomiting, anosmia, rising liver enzyme levels, fever, itching, and skin rashes. Skin and liver biopsies were performed during the patient’s admission; the results suggested vasculopathy-related cutaneous lesion and liver cholestasis. Plasmapheresis was initiated and all manifestations disappeared after treatment. All atypical presentations, including cutaneous lesions and liver manifestations, should be considered as COVID-19 and evaluated.","Sadeghi, Amir; Dooghaie Moghadam, Arash; Eslami, Pegah; Pirsalehi, Ali; Salari, Sina; Roshandel, Elham",Gastroenterol Hepatol Bed Bench,200,9

Despite limited evidence, an increasing number of surgeons suggest laparoscopic repair as an alternative to the gold standard of open repair. This review critically analysed post-operative clinical outcome on open versus laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair in paediatric patients. Before initiating the study, recurrence was defined as the primary outcome, and secondary outcomes were early post-operative pain, operation time and surgical site infections. METHODS The PRISMA guidelines were followed. Using strict inclusion and exclusion criteria, the following databases were searched: MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, Web of Science and Embase (May 2019). Retrospective and uncontrolled studies were excluded. RESULTS Five studies were identified, four randomised controlled trials (n = 272) and one controlled prospective study (n = 85) which included a total of 357 patients. Generally, the studies included few patients, were highly heterogenic and were overall of moderate quality. With a follow-up time ranging from three months to 14 years, there was no difference in recurrence rate after unilateral open (0-2%) versus unilateral laparoscopic (0-4%) or bilateral open versus bilateral laparoscopic repair (n = 281; p > 0.05 in all studies). There were no other significant differences in any of the outcomes, including post-operative pain (p > 0.05).

In this study, the cysteine-rich spikes were subjected to chemical modification to determine whether such structural alterations impact the virus entry process. Ellman reagent, a membrane-impermeant oxidizing agent which reacts with exposed cysteine residues to effect covalent addition of large thionitrobenzoate moieties, was incubated at 37 degrees C with the JHM strain of MHV. Relative to untreated virus, 1 mM Ellman reagent reduced infectivity by 2 log(10) after 1 h. This level of inhibition was not observed at incubation temperatures below 21 degrees C, suggesting that virion surface proteins undergo thermal transitions that expose cysteine residues to modification by the reagent. Quantitative receptor binding and membrane fusion assays were developed and used to show that Ellman reagent specifically inhibited membrane fusion induced by the MHV JHM spike protein. However, this inhibition was strain specific, because the closely related MHV strain A59 was unaffected. To identify the basis for this strain specificity, spike cDNAs were prepared in which portions encoded either JHM or A59 residues. cDNAs were expressed with vaccinia virus vectors and tested for sensitivity to Ellman reagent in the fusion assays. The results revealed a correlation between the severity of inhibition mediated by Ellman reagent and the presence of a JHM-specific cysteine (Cys-1163). Thus, the presence of this cysteine increases the availability of spikes for a thiol modification that ultimately prevents fusion competence.","Gallagher, T M",Journal of virology,200,16

The assay successfully amplified all HRVs tested and could reproducibly detect 50 HRV RNA transcript copies, with a dynamic range of over 7 logs. In contrast, a quantified RNA transcript of human enterovirus 68 (HEV68) that showed the greatest sequence homology to the HRV primers and probe set was not detected below a concentration of 5 x 10(5) copies per reaction. Nucleic acid extracts of 111 coded respiratory specimens that were culture positive for HRV or HEV were tested with the HRV real-time RT-PCR assay and by two independent laboratories that used different in-house HRV/HEV RT-PCR assays. Eighty-seven HRV-culture-positive specimens were correctly identified by the real-time RT-PCR assay, and 4 of the 24 HEV-positive samples were positive for HRV. HRV-specific sequences subsequently were identified in these four specimens, suggesting HRV/HEV coinfection in these patients. The assay was successfully applied in an investigation of a coincidental outbreak of HRV respiratory illness among laboratory staff.","Lu, Xiaoyan; Holloway, Brian; Dare, Ryan K; Kuypers, Jane; Yagi, Shigeo; Williams, John V; Hall, Caroline B; Erdman, Dean D",Journal of clinical microbiology,200,1

Steroids were used in 70 percent of patients, tocilizumab in 59 percent, and hydroxychloroquine in 27 percent. All patients received antibiotics. Convalescent plasma became available for our 5th patient. A total of 29 (78 percent) received convalescent plasma, (86 percent of survivors and 56 percent non-survivors). Median ICU length of stay was 11 days for both survivors (1-49) and non-survivors (1-21). There were no differences in age, body mass index (BMI), or initial PaO2/FiO2 (P/F) among those two groups. Non-survivors (nine) included the two immune compromised patients in our cohort, two patients with pre-existing DNR/DNI status, and one death within two hours of admit. Compared with survivors, more of the non-survivors received vasopressors (78 percent vs 46 percent), dialysis (44 percent vs 7 percent) and hydroxychloroquine (44 percent vs 21 percent). The first 5 patients treated in the ICU did not survive. One month after the initial case was reported in South Dakota, our ICU experienced a six-week surge. At its highest, COVID-19-related census reached 63 percent of the ICU capacity (15/24). CONCLUSION Mortality of critically ill patients with COVID-19 is high. Multi-organ, advanced and prolonged critical care resources are needed. Interpretation of our data is limited by a higher mortality of the earlier members of the cohort, a change in therapeutic practice over time and institution of social distancing.","Jamous, Fady; Meyer, Natasha; Buus, Dana; Ateeli, Huthayfa; Taggart, Kari; Hanson, Travis; Alzoubaidi, Mohammed; Nazir, Jawad; Devasahayam, Joe",South Dakota medicine : the journal of the South Dakota State Medical Association,200,4

No widespread warnings were issued about preventing person-to-person (secondary) transmission. A disease transmission model, fitted to the current data, was used to investigate likely reductions in illnesses that could result from interventions to prevent secondary transmission. The model indicates that exposure to contaminated spinach occurred early in the outbreak and that secondary transmission was similar to that in previous E. coli outbreaks ( 12%). The model also suggests that even a modestly effective strategy to interrupt secondary transmission (prevention of only 2%-3% of secondary illnesses) could result in a reduction of 5%-11% of symptomatic cases. This analysis supports the use of widespread public health messages during outbreaks of E. coli O157:H7 with specific advice on how to interrupt secondary transmission.","Seto, Edmund Y W; Soller, Jeffrey A; Colford, John M",Emerging infectious diseases,200,16

Corona virus antibodies were proven in 52.6 per cent of the sera of buffaloes originating from 3 cooperative farms and a number of private farms. The antibodies in the sera of buffalo calves had an average geometric titer of 182, and those in the sera of buffalo cows--74. The parallel study of 40 of the sera revealed a correlation between the hemagglutination inhibiting and the neutralizing antibodies. Twenty-nine fecal samples from buffalo calves with diarrhea, aged 5 to 30 days, were also studied via hemagglutination-inhibition on the same public farms. Corona virus of high titers was demonstrated in 7 of the samples, the hemagglutination activity of which had been suppressed by a bovine corona virus antiserum. It was concluded that a hemagglutinating coronavirus was circulating among the buffaloes. It seemed to be analogous to the bovine coronavirus and to participate in the etiology of part of the enteritis cases in growing buffalo calves.","Muniiappa, L; Mitov, B K; Kharalambiev, Kh E",Veterinarno-meditsinski nauki,200,20

Sports coaches and match officials are important stakeholders in facilitating early recognition, immediate management and appropriate return-to-play following SRC. This systematic review analyses the current evidence on SRC knowledge amongst sports coaches and match officials. The review was conducted in accordance to PRISMA guideline. A qualitative analysis of knowledge on identification, management, prevention and consequences of SRC as well as return-to-play principles was performed. The Appraisal Tool for Cross-sectional Studies was employed to assess the quality and reliability of each study. Searches were conducted on PubMed, Medline Ovid, Web of Science, CINAHL, SPORTDiscus and Psycinfo. Studies included were primary studies in English published in peer-reviewed journals assessing the level of concussion knowledge or education level amongst coaches, officials or both, regardless of sports or competitive level. A total of 20880 studies were identified, from which 27 were included in this review. There were 26 cross-sectional studies and one randomized controlled trial; 20 assessed SRC knowledge amongst coaches, one considered only officials and six studies assessed both groups. Concussion knowledge amongst coaches and match officials was deemed moderate in most studies, although significant knowledge gaps were identified. There is considerable room for further education on SRC amongst coaches and officials, particularly with the less commonly recognized symptoms of SRC and misconceptions about SRC management and prevention. Beyond knowledge assessment, further investigation should explore the translation of concussion knowledge to on-field management of players with SRC.","Yeo, Ping Chong; Yeo, Edgar Q Y; Probert, Joanne; Sim, Shauna H S; Sirisena, Dinesh",Journal of sports science & medicine,200,1

In order to study packaging, we added the G(N)/G(C) glycoprotein precursor (p110) to a polymerase I-driven minigenome rescue system to generate VLPs that are released into the supernatant. These particles can infect new cells, and reporter gene expression can be detected. To determine the role of UUK virus glycoproteins in RNP packaging, we performed an alanine scan of the glycoprotein G(N) cytoplasmic tail (amino acids 1 to 81). First, we discovered three regions in the tail (amino acids 21 to 25, 46 to 50, and 71 to 81) which are important for minigenome transfer by VLPs. Further mutational analysis identified four amino acids that were important for RNP packaging. These amino acids are essential for the binding of nucleoproteins and RNPs to the glycoprotein without affecting the morphology of the particles. No segment-specific interactions between the RNA and the cytoplasmic tail could be observed. We propose that VLP systems are useful tools for analyzing protein-protein interactions important for packaging of viral genome segments, assembly, and budding of other members of the Bunyaviridae family.","Overby, Anna K; Pettersson, Ralf F; Neve, Etienne P A",Journal of virology,200,19

The results showed that 55, 39 and 6 % had no, partial and full-PTSD respectively. Partial least squares showed that PTSD was significantly correlated with COPD severity which in turn was significantly correlated with health-related quality of life and psychiatric co-morbidity. Mediational analysis showed that the emotional symptoms of COPD mediated between PTSD and the mental health functioning of health-related quality of life and between PTSD and depression. To conclude, PTSD from past trauma was related to the severity of COPD for older patients. In particular, it impacted on the elevated emotional arousal of COPD severity. In turn, COPD severity impacted on older patients' general psychological well-being and depression.","Chung, Man Cheung; Jones, Rupert C M; Harding, Sam A; Campbell, John",The Psychiatric quarterly,200,15

Key lessons have been learned and milestones achieved that have shaped and sharpened our response approach and structures. While SARS was a wake-up-call to strengthen infection prevention and control capacity in health care settings and led to the formation of the Public Health Agency of Canada, it also strengthened our Federal/Provincial/Territorial (FPT) senior-level governance and led to agreements for pan-Canadian mutual aid and infectious disease information sharing. As well, our collective public health laboratory capacity has been strengthened through ongoing response and sharing of advanced diagnostics and research. As we move forward, it will be important to explore the design of scalable or modular emergency response strategies and structures that are socio-culturally appropriate and employ evidence-based strategic risk communications that continue to be critical, especially given the volume and spread of misinformation. With the current global reality, we must recognize that public health threats that go unchecked anywhere in the world have the potential to very rapidly become a public health threat in Canada. We need to build, maintain and share our best public health practices globally, for we neglect these at our peril.","Tam, T",Canada communicable disease report = Releve des maladies transmissibles au Canada,200,9

Most patients with suspected SARS should initially be treated with potent antibiotics before proceeding to 'anti-SARS' therapy. There is a spectrum of severity and rate of progression in SARS, and the stages of viral replication, inflammatory pneumonitis and residual pulmonary fibrosis are clinically non-distinct. Although now considered lacking in efficacy, ribavirin was used extensively in Hong Kong for treatment of SARS. Retrospective data suggest that the use of Kaletra (ritonavir and lopinavir), an anti-protease, could reduce mortality and improve outcomes, although the adverse reactions are also worrisome. Anecdotal experience strongly supports the use of steroid, at least in a subset of SARS patients, particularly with 'critical SARS' who display continued clinical instability or deterioration and progressive radiographic or HRCT deterioration. A retrospective study carried out of 72 probable SARS patients has shown that cases who received pulse methylprendisolone did not differ in cumulative steroid dosage or adverse reactions, although the former patients had less oxygen requirement, better radiographic outcome, and less likelihood of requiring rescue pulse steroid therapy than their counterparts. Nevertheless, lower dosage of steroid as initial therapy in SARS had also been associated with good clinical outcomes. Poor responders to initial therapy might benefit from rescue steroid therapy or intravenous Pentaglobin. Other drug treatments had also been tried in desperate patients, including the use of convalescence serum and plasmapheresis. Secondary infections could be troublesome, particular for patients with prolonged hospitalization and mechanical ventilation.","Tsang, Kenneth; Zhong, Nan Shan",Respirology,200,33

The more important infectious diseases of carnivores include rabies, canine distemper, and diseases caused by parvoviruses, coronaviruses and herpesviruses. Few parasitic or bacterial pathogens are significant in captive populations, and appropriate husbandry, therapy, vaccines and quarantine minimize the risk of disease. Extrapolations from one species to another regarding disease susceptibility may be incorrect. The black-footed ferret (Mustela nigripes) serves as an example of a carnivore significantly affected by infectious diseases, some of which were expected while others could not have been predicted from generalized knowledge of diseases of mustelids.

Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new type of respiratory disease that is currently spreading all over the world and caused by this coronavirus. Its common symptoms are highly similar to those of other viruses, such as fever, cough and dyspnea. There is currently no vaccine or treatment for COVID-19. Everyone is susceptible to infection with this disease, and owing to the long-term use of immunosuppressants, the immunity of kidney transplant recipients is suppressed, and it is more likely to be infected with the disease. At present, its impact on kidney transplant recipients is unclear. This article reports the clinical features and therapeutic course of novel coronavirus infection in a patient after renal transplantation. A 37-year-old female patient who received a kidney transplant 6 months before was diagnosed with novel coronavirus pneumonia. The patient's symptoms (such as fever, chills, dry cough, muscle aches), laboratory tests (such as decreased white blood cell count, elevated liver enzymes and D-dimer, positive viral nucleic acid test), and chest CT (multiple left lower lung plaque ground glass shadow) were similar to those of non-transplanted novel coronavirus pneumonia patients. In terms of treatment, because the immunity of kidney transplant recipients has been suppressed for a long time, it is a very common strategy to suspend the use of immunosuppressive agents. Therefore, the patient immediately discontinued the immunosuppressive agent after admission, so that she could restore immunity against infection in a short time. At the same time, the use of glucocorticoids was also very important. Its immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory effects played a large role in the treatment process.In addition, prophylactic antibiotics was needed, and nephrotoxic drugs should be used with caution. Finally, following discounting the use of immunosuppressant and a low-dose glucocorticoid-based treatment regimen, COVID-19 in this renal transplant recipient was successfully cured. The cure of this case was of great significance, and this adjuvant nonspecific antiviral therapy could provide a template for the treatment of other such patients.","Li, Q Y; Cheng, Q; Zhao, Z L; Dai, N N; Zeng, L; Zhu, L; Guo, W; Li, C; Wang, J H; Li, S; Ge, Q G; Shen, N",Beijing da xue xue bao.

We sought to examine associations between long-term consumption of milk and fermented dairy products and risk of breast cancer by estrogen (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) status and assess whether these associations varied by body weight. METHODS: The population-based Swedish Mammography Cohort included 33,780 women (88.2% postmenopausal), with no history of cancer or diabetes at baseline (1997). Long-term consumption of dairy products was assessed using a self-administered food-frequency questionnaire in 1987 and 1997. Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: During 16.6 years of follow-up (559,286 person-years), 1870 total breast cancer cases were diagnosed (1162 ER+/PR+; 195 ER-/PR-). High long-term non-fermented milk consumption was associated with increased ER+/PR+ breast cancer incidence, HR = 1.30, 95%CI:1.02-1.65 for the average of 1987 and 1997 intake &#8805;2 vs. 0 servings/day and this increased risk was limited to women with BMI<25 kg/m2 HR = 1.55, 95%CI:1.08-2.21, while no significant associations with milk consumption were observed with ER-/PR- breast cancer. In contrast, consumption of fermented dairy products was inversely associated with ER-/PR- breast cancer (for consistently high intake &#8805;3 vs. <1 servings/day HR = 0.28, 95%CI:0.10-0.78), but not clear association was observed for ER+/PR+ (HR = 0.89, 95%CI:0.69-1.14). CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of mainly postmenopausal women, high long-term consumption of milk was associated with increased risk of ER+/PR+ breast cancer.

Clinical visits have only been facilitated for emergency purposes. Fewer patients have been admitted to the hospital for both ST-segment elevation myocardial infarctions (STEMI) and non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarctions (NSTEMI) and a profound decrease in heart failure services has been reported. A similar reduction in the patient presentation is seen for ischemic heart disease, decompensated heart failure, and endocarditis. Cardiovascular services, including catheterization, primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI), cardiac investigations such as electrocardiograms (ECGs), exercise tolerance test (ETT), dobutamine stress test, computed tomography (CT) angiography, transesophageal echocardiography (TOE) have been reported to have declined and performed on a priority basis. The long-term implications of this decline have been discussed with major concerns of severe cardiac complications and vulnerabilities in cardiac patients. The pandemic has also had psychological impacts on patients causing them to avoid seeking medical help. This review discusses the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the provision of various cardiology services and aims to provide strategies to restore cardiovascular services including structural changes in the hospital to make up for the reduced staff personnel, the use of personal protective equipment in healthcare workers, and provides alternatives for high-risk cardiac imaging, cardiac interventions, and procedures.

Also, the interaction of the human receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) with the viral surface glycoprotein (S) is studied in depth. Structural studies tried to identify the residues responsible for enhancement/weaken virus-ACE2 interactions or the cross-reactivity of the neutralizing antibodies. Although the understanding of the immune system and the hyper-inflammatory process in COVID-19 are crucial for managing the immediate and the long-term consequences of the disease, not many X-ray/NMR/cryo-EM crystals are available. In addition to 3CLpro, the crystal structures of other nonstructural proteins offer valuable information for elucidating some aspects of the SARS-CoV-2 infection.

This review also aims to help support new researchers in the field of drug design. EXPERT OPINION: The choice of in silico tools is critically important for drug discovery and the accuracy of ADMET prediction. The accuracy largely depends on the types of dataset, the algorithm used, the quality of the model, the available endpoints for prediction, and user requirement. The key is to use multiple in silico tools for predictions and comparing the results, followed by the identification of the most probable prediction.","Kar, Supratik; Leszczynski, Jerzy",Expert Opin Drug Discov,200,32

Global reports of HIV/SARS-CoV-2 coinfection are limited. To better understand the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on persons with HIV and improve their care, we present an outpatient and inpatient clinical experience of HIV/SARS-CoV-2 coinfection from Rhode Island, US. METHODS: We describe outpatient and inpatient preparedness for the COVID-19 pandemic, and present a case series of all known patients with HIV/SARS-CoV-2 coinfection at The Miriam Hospital and Rhode Island Hospital, and The Miriam Hospital Infectious Diseases and Immunology Center, in Providence, Rhode Island, US. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The Infectious Diseases and Immunology Center rapidly prepared for outpatient and inpatient care of persons with HIV and SARS-CoV-2. Between 30 March and 20 May 2020, 27 patients with HIV were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2. Twenty were male, six female and one transgender female; average age was 49 years; 13/27 were Hispanic and 6/27 were African American. All had HIV viral load <200 copies/mL and were on antiretroviral therapy with CD4 count range 87 to 1441 cells/µL. Twenty-six of the 27 had common COVID-19 symptoms for one to twenty-eight days and most had other co-morbidities and/or risk factors. Nine of the 27 were hospitalized for one to thirteen days; of those, three lived in a nursing home, six received remdesivir through a clinical trial or emergency use authorization and tolerated it well; eight recovered and one died. Overall, 17% of known Center people had HIV/SARS-CoV-2 coinfection, whereas the comparable state-wide prevalence was 9%. CONCLUSIONS: We highlight challenges of outpatient and inpatient HIV care in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic and present the largest detailed case series to date from the United States on HIV/SARS-CoV-2 coinfection, adding to limited global reports. The aggregated clinical findings suggest that the clinical presentation and outcomes of COVID-19 appear consistent with those without HIV. Whether SARS-CoV-2 infection is more frequent among persons with HIV remains to be determined. More data are needed as we develop our understanding of how HIV and antiretroviral therapy are affected by or have an impact on this pandemic.","Byrd, Katrina M; Beckwith, Curt G; Garland, Joseph M; Johnson, Jennie E; Aung, Su; Cu-Uvin, Susan; Farmakiotis, Dimitrios; Flanigan, Timothy; Gillani, Fizza S; Macias-Gil, Raul; Mileno, Maria; Ramratnam, Bharat; Rybak, Natasha R; Sanchez, Martha; Tashima, Karen; Mylonakis, Eleftherios; Kantor, Rami",J Int AIDS Soc,200,26

Exploratory Structural Equation Modeling generally supported internal structure for EPA-SF scales, in that the 18 EPA-SF traits generally loaded onto their four respective domain scales: Antagonism, Emotional Stability, Inhibition and Narcissism. Tucker's congruence coefficients (.95-.99) indicated excellent replicability of the original structure. The EPA-SF total and domain scale scores also showed moderate to large correlations with TriPM, E-LSRP and FFM domain scales in a manner mostly consistent with conceptual expectations. Finally, EPA-SF trait scales were also mostly associated with their corresponding FFM trait scale counterparts.

This study aims to assess post-traumatic growth (PTG) of Chinese nurses and GP during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study employed PTG in Chinese nurses and GP with Posttraumatic growth inventory questionnaire (PTGI) via a mobile app-based questionnaire, anxiety and ways to copy with stress in nurses were also employed. A total of 455 nurses and 424 GP were included in the statistical analysis. Results indicated that score of total PTGI and three dimensions, new possibilities, personal strength and spiritual change, were different between nurses and GP. Furthermore, score of total PTGI and all domains were significantly different between 178 front-line nurses (FLNs) and 277 non-front-line nurses (nFLNs). Importantly, sex, marriage status, professional titles, fertility, anxiety and ways to copy with stress were associated with PTG in nurses. Moreover, marriage status and ways to copy with stress were the predictors of PTG in nurses. Interestingly, this study found that WeChat network psychological counseling and phone app of application self-relaxation were good and effective coping strategies for nurses to relieve stress. Thus, the development of valid intervention programs for nurses to diminish job burnout and increase care quality was also important.","Li, Lin; Mao, Ming; Wang, Shuya; Yin, Rulan; Yan, Hai039; Ou,; Jin, Yue; Cheng, Yun",Psychol Health Med,200,1

The most frequently reported coagulation/fibrinolytic abnormality in COVID-19 is the increase in D-dimer, and its relationship with prognosis has been discussed. However, limits exist to the utility of evaluation by D-dimer alone. In addition, since the coagulation/fibrinolytic condition sometimes fluctuates within a short period of time, regular examinations in recognition of the significance of the examination are desirable. The pathophysiology of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) associated with COVID-19 is very different from that of septic DIC, and both thrombotic and hemorrhagic pathologies should be noted. COVID-19 thrombosis includes macro- and microthrombosis, with diagnosis of the latter depending on markers of coagulation and fibrinolysis. Treatment of COVID-19 is classified into antiviral treatment, cytokine storm treatment, and thrombosis treatment. Rather than providing uniform treatment, the treatment method most suitable for the severity and stage should be selected.

RESULTS: The sample included 998 respondents (49.8% MH, 20.6% primary care, 20.4% medical specialty, 9.1% surgical specialty; 61% response rate). Most providers rated VC as equivalent to or higher in quality and efficiency compared with in-person care with masks. Quality ratings were significantly higher for video versus phone (&#967;2=61.4, P<0.0001), but efficiency ratings did not differ significantly. Ratings varied across specialties (highest in MH, lowest in SS; all &#967;2s>24.1, Ps<0.001). Inability to conduct a physical examination and patient technical difficulties were significant challenges. MH providers were comfortable seeing a larger proportion of patients virtually compared with the other specialties (all &#967;2s>12.2, Ps<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Broad provider support for VC was stratified across specialties, with the highest ratings in MH and lowest ratings in SS. Findings will inform the improvement of VC processes and the planning of health care delivery during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.","Connolly, Samantha L; Gifford, Allen L; Miller, Christopher J; Bauer, Mark S; Lehmann, Lisa S; Charness, Michael E",Med Care,200,1

Here, we review recently published studies on the clinical diagnosis, risk stratification, and treatment of MIS-C, highlighting key gaps in research progress that are a microcosm for challenges in translational pediatric research. We then discuss potential solutions in the realm of translational bioinformatics. RECENT FINDINGS: Current case definitions are inconsistent and do not capture the underlying pathophysiology of MIS-C, which remains poorly understood. Although overall mortality is low, some patients rapidly decompensate, and a test to identify those at risk for severe outcomes remains an unmet need. Treatment consists of various combinations of immunoglobulins, corticosteroids, and biologics, based on extrapolated data and expert opinion, while the benefits remain unclear as we await the completion of clinical trials. SUMMARY: The small size and heterogeneity of the pediatric population contribute to unmet needs because of financial and logistical constraints of the current research infrastructure focused on eliminating most sources of heterogeneity, leading to ungeneralizable results. Data sharing and meta-analysis of gene expression shows promise to accelerate progress in the field of MIS-C as well as other childhood diseases beyond the current pandemic.","Murphy Jones, Lara; Khatri, Purvesh",Curr Opin Pediatr,200,12

Studies on online individual therapy indicate that therapists often have favorable attitudes toward this modality. To date, there is scant work on couples therapists' attitudes, despite the fact that the provision of online couples' therapy poses unique challenges (e.g., dealing with escalating conflict remotely). To provide a snapshot, in real time, as to how therapists experience the transition to online therapy, we surveyed 166 Israeli couples' therapists during April 2020, when lockdown orders prevented therapists from seeing couples face-to-face. A few weeks later, when the stay-at-home policy was lifted, a subsample (N = 60) of these therapists completed a follow-up assessment. The results suggest that couples therapists had limited experience using the online modality prior to COVID. The therapists reported experiencing online couples' therapy as somewhat successful and that their experience of providing therapy during the COVID-19 crisis had an overall positive impact on their attitudes toward online work. Establishing a strong therapeutic bond with both partners, dealing with escalating conflict, and treatment dropout were identified as the issues of most concern when conducting online couples therapy. The perceived difficulties with online therapy prospectively predicted lower usage of online couples' therapy, as well as less intention to continue online treatment once the crisis is over.","Machluf, Reut; Abba Daleski, Michal; Shahar, Ben; Kula, Ofra; Bar-Kalifa, Eran",Fam. process,200,26

Understanding populations at heightened risk of acquisition is essential to more effectively target outreach and prevention efforts. Objective: To compare sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of pregnant women with and without SARS-CoV2 infection and, among those with SARS-CoV2, to compare characteristics of those who reported COVID-19 symptoms and those who were asymptomatic at diagnosis. Study Design: This retrospective cohort study includes pregnant women who delivered or intended to deliver at Northwestern Memorial Hospital after initiation of a universal testing protocol on admission (April 8, 2020 - May 31, 2020). Women were dichotomized by whether they tested positive for SARS-CoV2. Among women who tested positive, women were further dichotomized by whether they endorsed symptoms of COVID-19. Bivariable analysis, and non-parametric tests of trend were used for analyses. Logistic regression was used to control for potential confounders as well as to examine effect modification between race and ethnicity and any other identified risk factors. Results: During the study period, 1,418 women met inclusion criteria, of whom 101 (7.1%) tested positive for SARS-CoV2. Of the 101 women who tested positive, 77 (76.2%) were symptomatic at the time of diagnosis. Compared to women who tested negative for SARS-CoV2, women who tested positive were younger and were more likely to have public insurance, to identify as Black/African-American or Latina, to be unmarried, to be obese, have pre-existing pulmonary disease, and have living children. An increasing number of living children was associated with an increasing risk of SARS-CoV2 infection and this finding persisted after controlling for potential confounders. There was no effect modification between race or ethnicity and having living children with regard to the risk of infection. There were no significant differences identified between women who were symptomatic and asymptomatic. Conclusion: Many risk factors for SARS-CoV2 infection in pregnancy are similar to the social and structural determinants of health that have been reported in the general population. The observed association between SARS-CoV2 infection and having children raises the possibility of children themselves as vectors of viral spread or behavior patterns of parents as mediators of acquisition.","Sakowicz, Allie; Ayala, Alexander E; Ukeje, Chideraa C; Witting, Celeste S; Grobman, William A; Miller, Emily S",Am J Obstet Gynecol MFM,200,16

However, current diagnostic testing (e.g., PCR) and genomic surveillance methods (e.g., whole genome sequencing) are performed separately, thus limiting the detection and tracing of SARS-CoV-2 and emerging variants. Here, we developed DeepSARS, a high-throughput platform for simultaneous diagnostic detection and genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 by the integration of molecular barcoding, targeted deep sequencing, and computational phylogenetics. DeepSARS enables highly sensitive viral detection, while also capturing genomic diversity and viral evolution. We show that DeepSARS can be rapidly adapted for identification of emerging variants, such as alpha, beta, gamma, and delta strains, and profile mutational changes at the population level. DeepSARS sets the foundation for quantitative diagnostics that capture viral evolution and diversity.

The only way that can be adopted at this stage is to control the number of cases to a minimum. Time series-forecasting models can enable the planners and administrators to foresee the picture and take timely action to control. Methodology: To forecast the daily number of COVID cases, prediction models were developed using Autoregressive-Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) modelling techniques in the various states of India where the cases are highly reported. The main objectives included the assessment of trend and growth rates of number of COVID-19 cases confirmed and identification of the best ARIMA model for their prediction. Results: Excellent parsimonious forecasting equation for each state in India could be generated using the method. These models will be helpful for planning purposes in controlling the cases. The best model for the prediction of number of COVID cases in all over India was observed as ARIMA (0,2,1). ARIMA (0,1,0) was identified as best model for Mizoram and Puducherry. Conclusion: To predict all India cases, ARIMA (0,2,7) was identified as the best model.","Unnikrishnan, T.",Current Medical Issues,200,16

The aim of this study was to investigate how many patients ended up with a ureteral stricture after URS at our hospital and how these were treated. We also wanted to identify potential risk factors for post endoscopic stricture formation. Materials and methods: A retrospective evaluation of 1001 URS for stone treatment at the day-case surgery unit between 2013 - 2018 was performed. Data on pretreatment status, the surgical procedure and follow-up were recorded. Exact χ2 and independent-samples t-tests were used comparing data among those who developed strictures and those who did not. Multiple logistic regression was performed analyzing risk factors for stricture formation. Results: In total, 1001 URS were performed in 725 patients, 289 women and 436 men. Of these, 995 cases were eligible for analysis. At follow-up with computed tomography after 3 months, 28 (3.0%) strictures were identified. Of these, 20 received endourological treatment with balloon dilatation of which 15 (75%) were successful. Definitive treatment in the 13 patients with failed or unattempted endourological treatment included nephrectomy, reconstructive surgery, permanent nephrostomy or observation with no further treatment. In multiple regression analysis, use of access sheath (UAS) (OR 4.6, p = 0.011), ureteral perforation (OR 11.8, p < 0.0001) and surgical time > 60 minutes (OR 5.7, p < 0.005) were found to be risk factors for stricture formation. Conclusion: Ureteral stricture is a rare complication of URS. Balloon dilatation should be the first line of treatment. Use of UAS, perforation and excessive operating time were found to be risk factors for post endoscopic ureteral stricture formation. Special attention to these risk factors should be given to reduce the incidence of ureteral strictures.","Ulvik, Øyvind; Harneshaug, Jill-Randi; Gjengstø, Peder",J. endourol,200,1

However, existing prediction tools have limited ability to accommodate scarce or fragmented training data currently available. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to learn predictors that can generalize or extrapolate beyond the heterogeneous data. Our method builds on and extends recently proposed invariant risk minimization, adaptively forcing the predictor to avoid nuisance variation. We achieve this by continually exercising and manipulating latent representations of molecules to highlight undesirable variation to the predictor. To test the method we use a combination of three data sources: SARS-CoV-2 antiviral screening data, molecular fragments that bind to SARS-CoV-2 main protease and large screening data for SARS-CoV-1. Our predictor outperforms state-of-the-art transfer learning methods by significant margin. We also report the top 20 predictions of our model on Broad drug repurposing hub.","Jin, Wengong; Barzilay, Regina; Jaakkola, Tommi",,200,33

Even though the academic world is intensively pursuing new therapies, there is still no ""game changer"" in the management of COVID 19. The Mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) is an ancient signaling system that has been proposed as a molecular tool used by coronaviruses and other RNA and DNA viruses in order to replicate and persist in the host cell. In recent years, Intermittent Fasting (IF), a practice consisting on a strict calorie restriction during a prolonged period of time during the day, has gained popularity due to its potential benefits in multiple health systems and in regulating inflammation. IF inhibits the mTOR pathway which is similar to the effects of Rapamycin in some animal models. mTOR inhibition and promotion of autophagy could potentially be the link between the possible direct benefits of IF in COVID-19 due to the interruption of the viral cycle (protein synthesis). Besides, IF has shown to be a strong anti-inflammatory in multiple prior studies, and may play a role in attenuating COVID -19 severity. This review hypothesizes the possible intersection between viral, immunological, and metabolic pathways related to mTOR and the potential mechanisms through which IF may improve clinical outcomes. Future prospective randomized controlled clinical trials to evaluate intermittent fasting (IF) regimens in order to prevent and treat moderate to severe forms of COVID-19 in humans are needed.","Gnoni, Martin; Beas, Renato; Vásquez-Garagatti, Raúl",Virusdisease,200,16

Yet, important questions such as how deadly it is or its degree of spread within different countries remain unanswered. In this work, we exploit the `universal' growth of the mortality rate with age observed in different countries since the beginning of their respective outbreaks, combined with the results of the antibody prevalence tests in the population of Spain, to unveil both unknowns. We validate these results with an analogous antibody rate survey in the canton of Geneva, Switzerland. We also argue that the official number of deaths over 70 years old is importantly underestimated in most of the countries, and we use the comparison between the official records with the number of deaths mentioning COVID-19 in the death certificates to quantify by how much. Using this information, we estimate the fatality infection ratio (IFR) for the different age segments and the fraction of the population infected in different countries assuming a uniform exposure to the virus in all age segments. We also give estimations for the non-uniform IFR using the sero-epidemiological results of Spain, showing a very similar growth of the fatality ratio with age. Only for Spain, we estimate the probability (if infected) of being identified as a case, being hospitalized or admitted in the intensive care units as function of age. In general, we observe a nearly exponential growth of the fatality ratio with age, which anticipates large differences in total IFR in countries with different demographic distributions, with numbers that range from 1.82\% in Italy, to 0.62\% in China or even 0.14\% in middle Africa.","Seoane, Beatriz",,200,23

Studies have shown that this virus causes worse outcomes and a higher mortality in men than in women. It has been recognized that sex can affect the immune response to a pathogenic agent, as well as the susceptibility for some respiratory diseases. These different responses in males and females may be related to the actions of sex hormones. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) acts as the receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes COVID-19. The expression of ACE2 is influenced by sex hormones; therefore, we discuss in this article that this could be one of the reasons why COVID-19 is more prevalent in men than in women.","Gargaglioni, Luciane H; Marques, Danuzia A",J Appl Physiol (1985),200,21

However, most data available focus on health-related events after severe infection and hospitalisation. We present a longitudinal, prospective analysis of health consequences in patients who initially presented with no or minor symptoms of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Hence, we focus on mild COVID-19 in non-hospitalised patients. Methods 958 Patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were observed from April 6th to December 2nd 2020 for long-term symptoms and SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. We identified anosmia, ageusia, fatigue or shortness of breath as most common, persisting symptoms at month 4 and 7 and summarised presence of such long-term health consequences as post-COVID syndrome (PCS). Predictors of long-term symptoms were assessed using an uni- and multivariable logistic regression model. Findings We observed 442 and 353 patients over four and seven months after symptom onset, respectively. Four months post SARS-CoV-2 infection, 8•6% (38/442) of patients presented with shortness of breath, 12•4% (55/442) with anosmia, 11•1% (49/442) with ageusia and 9•7% (43/442) with fatigue. At least one of these characteristic symptoms was present in 27•8% (123/442) and 34•8% (123/353) at month 4 and 7 post-infection, respectively. A lower baseline level of SARS-CoV-2 IgG, anosmia and diarrhoea during acute COVID-19 were associated with higher risk to develop long-term symptoms. Interpretation The on-going presence of either shortness of breath, anosmia, ageusia or fatigue as long-lasting symptoms even in non-hospitalised patients was observed at four and seven months post-infection and summarised as post-COVID syndrome (PCS). The continued assessment of patients with PCS will become a major task to define and mitigate the socioeconomic and medical long-term effects of COVID-19.

This study investigated the relationship between academic self-efficacy and burnout in first-year nursing students who participated in distance learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The study included 69 first-year nursing students at Jenderal Achmad Yani University in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. Data were collected in September 2020 through self-efficacy and burnout questionnaires that were distributed via email and social media for 2 weeks. The responses were analyzed using the gamma test. RESULTS: Most respondents were women (78.3%), with an average age of 19 years. Most nursing students had a moderate level of academic self-efficacy (72.5%), while only 13.0% of respondents had a low level of academic self-efficacy. However, 46.4% of students experienced severe burnout during distance learning. Cross-tabulation showed that students with moderate self-efficacy were more likely to experience severe burnout (24 respondents) (P<0.01 and r=-0.884). Exhaustion was the burnout dimension most closely associated with academic self-efficacy. CONCLUSION: Students perceived distance learning as burdensome and reported high levels of exhaustion, which may negatively impact their academic achievement. Interventions to improve academic self-efficacy may foster students' confidence, potentially leading to reduced burnout levels.

From one single case on March 5th, the number of cases increased rapidly, forcing the South-African Government to swiftly react and place the country under strict lockdown for six weeks. The strategy of the South African Government bore fruits with a contained spread of the virus. If the number of positive cases at the end of the lockdown reached 5647, the number of fatal casualties was limited to 103 deaths. The lockdown was overall well respected, even if serious problems of food supply soon occurred in informal settlements, leading to riots and confrontation with security forces. Indeed, populations were obedient, but not being able to practice sport or outdoors activities appeared heavy. The constant fear of the poorest not to have enough money to pay rent and buy food (even if the Government organised food parcels' distributions), and to find less and less work was echoed by the fear of losing jobs among those more privileged. Despite the risk of an economic crisis, the South African Government has continued on the reasonable path of containing the pandemic with ending the lockdown at a slow pace, in five phases.","Stiegler, Nancy; Bouchard, Jean-Pierre",Ann. med.-psychol,200,22

Coronavirus research is of significance to overcome the epidemic. Our study aims to investigate the global status and trends of coronavirus research. METHOD: Publications related to the studies of coronavirus research from January 1, 2003 to February 6, 2020 were retrieved from the Science Citation Index-Expanded (SCI-E) of the Web of Science database. A total of 9294 publications were included. The data source was studied and indexed by bibliometric methodology. For visualized study, bibliographic coupling analysis, co-authorship analysis, co-citation analysis, co-occurrence analysis and the analysis of publication trends in coronavirus research were conducted by VOS (visualization of similarities) viewer and GraphPadPrism 6 software. RESULTS: The number of publications about coronavirus research increased sharply in 2004 for SARS outbreak and increased again in 2012 for MERS outbreak. The USA made the highest contributions to the global research with the most total number of publications, total citation frequency, and the highest H-index, while Netherlands had the highest average citation per item. Journal of Virology had the largest publication numbers. The University of Hong Kong is the most contributive institution with the most publications. The main research orientation and funding agency were virology and United States Department of Health Human Services. Keywords of all related studies could be divided into 4 clusters: ""Pathological research,"" ""Epidemiology research,"" ""Clinical research,"" and ""Mechanism research."" CONCLUSIONS: The outbreak of the epidemic could promote coronavirus research, meanwhile, coronavirus research contributes to overcoming the epidemic. Attention should be drawn to the latest popular research, including ""Spike protein,"" ""Receptor binding domain,"" and ""Vaccine."" Therefore, more and more efforts will be put into mechanism research and vaccine research and development, which can be helpful to deal with the epidemic.","Mao, Xingjia; Guo, Lu; Fu, Panfeng; Xiang, Chuan",Medicine (Baltimore),200,1
257029,257029,257029,Vaccine-Induced Immune Thrombotic Thrombocytopenia (VITT): Targeting Pathomechanisms with Bruton Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors,13.204793,9.601901,2021,"This study presents two new concepts and definitions to the medical literature. One of those is “endogenous retinoic acid theory” and the other “retinoic acid depletion syndrome”. A new classification will be provided for the immune system: “retinoic acid-dependent component” and “retinoic acid non-dependent component”. If this theory is verified, all the diseases where the retinoic acid metabolism is defective and retinoic acid levels are low will be identified and new approaches will be developed fortreating such diseases. When the need for retinoic acids increases, such as acute infection, high fever, severe catabolic process, or chronic antigenic stimulation, cytochrome oxidase enzymes are inhibited by drugs or internal mechanisms. Metabolism and excretion of retinoic acids stored in the liver are prevented. In this way, retinoic acid levels in the blood are raised to therapeutic levels. This is called “Endogenous Retinoic Acid Theory”. Retinoic acids also manage their metabolism through feedback mechanisms. Despite compensatory mechanisms, causes such as high fever, serious catabolic process and excessively large viral genome (SARS-CoV-2), excessive use of RIG-I and Type I interferon synthesis pathway using retinoic acid causes emptying of retinoic acid stores. As a result, the RIG-I pathway becomes ineffective, Type I IFN synthesis stops, and the congenital immune system collapses. Then the immune mechanism passes to TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, TLR9, MDA5 and UPS pathways in the monocyte, macrophage, neutrophil and dendritic cells of the adaptive immune defense system that do not require retinoic acid. This leads to excessive TNFα and cytokine discharge from the pathway. With the depletion of retinoic acid stores as a result of this overuse, the immune defense mechanism switches from the congenital immune system to the adaptive immune system, where retinoic acids cannot be used. As a result of this depletion of retinoic acids, the shift of the immune system to the NFκB arm, which causes excessive cytokine release, is called “retinoic acid depletion syndrome”. COVID-19 and previously defined sepsis, SIRS and ARDS are each retinoic acid depletion syndrome. We claim that retinoic acid metabolism is defective in most inflammatory diseases, particularly COVID-19 (cytokine storm) sepsis, SIRS and ARDS. Finding a solution to this mechanism will bring a new perspective and treatment approach to such diseases.","Sarohan, Aziz Rodan",Med. Hypotheses,200,1

In 2017, it was reported that physical stimuli related to massage improved finger blood flow volumes, contributing to the regeneration of damaged nerves. We developed a method of hand therapy for breast cancer patients complaining of numbness related to anticancer drug administration, and examined its effects on numbness. Hand therapy was performed by a single therapist who received lectures at the Sophia Phytotherapy College, which is accredited by the Japan Handcare Association. The fingertips to wrist, ankle, metacarpal bones, palm, and elbow were massaged using the bilateral arms/fingers for 15minutes. We investigated the influences of daily living status(Support Team Assessment Sched- ule-Japan: STAS-J), age, body mass index(BMI), severity/site of numbness, type of numbness, type of drug, duration of breast cancer, duration of numbness, and presence or absence of lymph node dissection, and evaluated the severity of numbness using a 10-cm Visual Analog Scale(VAS). The study included 51 breast cancer patients complaining of numbness of the fingers, with a mean age of 59 years. In patients with relatively mild numbness(STAS-J 1), the VAS scores before and after hand therapy were 4.7±1.8 and 1.9±1.3, respectively, showing a marked decrease. In STAS-J 2 patients, the values were 4.9 ±1.4 and 2.1±1.3, respectively, also showing a marked decrease. Thus, this hand therapy reduced numbness in mild- and moderate-status patients. Statistical comparisons were performed between the STAS-J 1/2(mild/moderate numbness)and STAS-J 3/4(severe numbness)groups. Although the severity of numbness was not correlated with age, BMI, type of drug, lymph node dissection, or duration of breast cancer, the proportion of patients with a B1-year history of numbness was significantly larger in the STAS-J 1/2 group. The most frequent site of numbness was from the proximal interphalangeal joints to the fingertips. Concerning the severity of numbness, many patients complained of severe numbness, as represented by that after sitting straight. These results suggest that this hand therapy is effective for reducing numbness in patients receiving taxanes and complaining of mild to moderate numbness.","Sasaki, Akiko; Ikeda, Akiko; Tsunoda, Yuko; Sawada, Terumasa; Tsurutani, Junji; Tatsuo, Tokito; Kiuchi, Yuji; Nakamura, Seigo",Gan To Kagaku Ryoho,200,21

METHODS: In this narrative review, we drew upon the experiences of the authors as both life-long learners and educators. We then reviewed literature pertaining to novel teaching methodologies developed in medical education since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Several medical specialties have employed novel teaching methodologies including use of telemedicine, remote teaching, online curricula, virtual rotations, virtual conferences, simulations, and learning consortia to continue engaging trainees during the COVID-19 pandemic.

This study examined the prevalence of and temporal changes in CPD, its early and follow-up predictors and the extent to which it was predictive of mental health problems. METHODS: The study took a two-wave design approach and was conducted during and 3-4 months after the nationwide lockdown in France. Baseline participants were 1123 (79.5% women; M age = 33.82; range: 18-80). They completed validated measures assessing CPD, posttraumatic stress (PTS), depression, and anxiety symptoms. Descriptive, correlational, and path model analyses were used. FINDINGS: Both baseline and follow-up groups presented similar psychosocial profiles. Overall, 35.5% (95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 32.7-38.4) baseline participants and 17.2% (95% CI: 12.6-22.7) follow-up participants developed clinical cases of CPD. The baseline CPD levels predicted 14-20% of the variances of PTS (b = 0.55), depression (b = 0.16) and anxiety symptoms (b = 0.16). After accounting for the effect of the baseline CPD levels, the current CPD levels predicted the three investigated mental health outcomes in high proportions (43-47%). Further findings revealed important temporal changes in baseline predictors of CPD. However, the chronic CPD and PTS symptoms were prevalent among students and individuals developing worries about the COVID-19 crisis while depression and anxiety symptoms were prevalent among single people and those with pre-existing mental health problems. LIMITATIONS: Data from self-report measures of mental health were used. The dropout rate between the two time assessments was relatively high. CONCLUSIONS: These longitudinal findings call for clinical efforts in assessment of and intervention in trauma-related distress. These efforts should be put into the predictive role of CPD in subsequent development of PTS symptoms and comorbidities as long as the health, social and economic consequences of the pandemic linger.","Megalakaki, Olga; Kokou-Kpolou, Cyrille Kossigan; Vaudé, Justine; Park, Sunyoung; Iorfa, Steven Kator; Cénat, Jude Mary; Derivois, Daniel",J Psychiatr Res,200,33

This change was driven by enhanced nonpharmaceutical interventions, particularly case isolation. We also show that using real-time estimation of serial intervals allowing for variation over time provides more accurate estimates of reproduction numbers than using conventionally fixed serial interval distributions.

In this paper, we propose a framework to study fact checking efforts using Google Trends, a signal that captures search interest over topics on the world's largest search engine. Our framework consists of extracting claims from fact checking efforts, linking such claims with knowledge graph entities, and estimating the online attention they receive. We use this framework to study a dataset of 879 COVID-19-related fact checks done in 2020 by 81 international organizations. Our findings suggest that there is often a disconnect between online attention and fact checking efforts. For example, in around 40% of countries where 10 or more claims were fact checked, half or more than half of the top 10 most popular claims were not fact checked. Our analysis also shows that claims are first fact checked after receiving, on average, 35% of the total online attention they would eventually receive in 2020. Yet, there is a big variation among claims: some were fact checked before receiving a surge of misinformation-induced online attention, others are fact checked much later. Overall, our work suggests that the incorporation of online attention signals may help organizations better assess and prioritize their fact checking efforts. Also, in the context of international collaboration, where claims are fact checked multiple times across different countries, online attention could help organizations keep track of which claims are""migrating""between different countries.","Ribeiro, Manoel Horta; Zannettou, Savvas; Goga, Oana; Benevenuto, Fabr'icio; West, Robert",,200,20

Recent studies have found that the pathogen of COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), shares the same cell receptor angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2) as SARS-CoV. The pathological investigation of COVID-19 deaths showed that the lungs had characteristics of pulmonary fibrosis. However, how SARS-CoV-2 spreads from the lungs to other organs has not yet been determined. Here, we performed an unbiased evaluation of cell-type-specific expression of ACE2 in healthy and fibrotic lungs, as well as in normal and failed adult human hearts, using published single-cell RNA-seq data. We found that ACE2 expression in fibrotic lungs mainly locates in arterial vascular cells, which might provide a route for bloodstream spreading of SARS-CoV-2. Failed human hearts have a higher percentage of ACE2-expressing cardiomyocytes, and SARS-CoV-2 might attack cardiomyocytes through the bloodstream in patients with heart failure. Moreover, ACE2 was highly expressed in cells infected by respiratory syncytial virus or Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus and in mice treated by lipopolysaccharide. Our findings indicate that patients with pulmonary fibrosis, heart failure, and virus infection have a higher risk and are more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The SARS-CoV-2 might attack other organs by getting into the bloodstream. This study provides new insights into SARS-CoV-2 blood entry and heart injury and might propose a therapeutic strategy to prevent patients from developing severe complications.","Guo, Jieyu; Wei, Xiangxiang; Li, Qinhan; Li, Liliang; Yang, Zhaohua; Shi, Yu; Qin, Yue; Zhang, Xinyue; Wang, Xinhong; Zhi, Xiuling; Meng, Dan",J Cell Physiol,200,24

BACKGROUND: Burnout of healthcare professionals can be a major cost to the Australian economy and public healthcare sector. According to the social exchange theory, when healthcare professionals perceive that their organisation proactively allocates resources to caring for its employees, then they are more likely to reciprocate and become more engaged in their work roles. DESIGN: The study used a pre- and postsurvey of healthcare professionals who participated in the well-being initiative. METHODS: Between February-June 2019, 172 healthcare professionals were surveyed before and after a well-being initiative. The survey included questions on workplace engagement, workplace well-being and job satisfaction. Paired t tests were used to determine whether the difference between before and after averages was significant. The TREND statement was used to ensure the quality reporting of this study. RESULTS: The well-being initiative had a positive impact on the healthcare professionals involved in the initiative. Nursing staff benefitted the most from the well-being initiative, while the full-time staff members and highly experienced demonstrated an increase in engagement. CONCLUSION: Well-being initiatives can be a targeted strategy to help alleviate burnout amongst healthcare professionals and build a mutually beneficial relationship between management and employees. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: This study shows how implementing a staff well-being initiative increases workplace engagement, which benefits both the individual and the organisation.","Almeida, Shamika; Bowden, Alera; Bloomfield, Jason; Jose, Besty; Wilson, Valerie",J. clin. nurs,200,26

The main aim of this study was to compare the demographic and clinical parameters between two cohorts before the onset of lockdown and within the pandemic. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed between two groups A and B, who presented with acute appendicitis three months prior to and after initiation of lockdown on March 24 2020 respectively in one of the tertiary centers of Nepal. These two cohorts were compared in demographics, clinicopathological characteristics and surgical aspects of acute appendicitis. RESULTS: There were 42 patients in group A and 50 patients in group B. Mean age of the patients was 31.32±17.18 years with male preponderance in group B (N = 29). Mean duration of pain increased significantly in group B [57.8±25.9(B) vs 42.3±25.0(A) hours, P = 0.004] along with mean duration of surgery [51.06±9.4(B) vs 45.27±11.8(A) minutes, P = 0.015].

Predictors of poor clinical outcomes were analyzed. The primary outcomes were in-hospital mortality and the need for ICU admission. The secondary outcome was composite in-hospital mortality and/or ICU admission. RESULTS: One hundred nine patients (male/female: 63/46, mean age: 48.4 ± 12.4 years) were included in the study. Acute kidney injury (AKI) developed in 46 (42.2%) patients, and 4 (3.7%) of the patients required renal replacement therapy (RRT). A total of 22 (20.2%) patients were admitted in the ICU, and 19 (17.4%) patients required invasive mechanical ventilation. 14 (12.8%) of the patients died. Patients who were admitted in the ICU were significantly older (age over 60 years) (38.1% vs 14.9%, p = 0.016). 23 (21.1%) patients reached to composite outcome and these patients were significantly older (age over 60 years) (39.1% vs. 13.9%; p = 0.004), and had lower serum albumin (3.4 g/dl [2.9-3.8] vs. 3.8 g/dl [3.5-4.1], p = 0.002), higher serum ferritin (679 µg/L [184-2260] vs. 331 µg/L [128-839], p = 0.048), and lower lymphocyte counts (700/µl [460-950] vs. 860 /µl [545-1385], p = 0.018). Multivariable analysis identified presence of ischemic heart disease and initial serum creatinine levels as independent risk factors for mortality, whereas age over 60 years and initial serum creatinine levels were independently associated with ICU admission. On analysis for predicting secondary outcome, age above 60 and initial lymphocyte count were found to be independent variables in multivariable analysis. CONCLUSION: Over the age of 60, ischemic heart disease, lymphopenia, poor graft function were independent risk factors for severe COVID-19 in this patient group.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with laboratory-proven moderate to severe COVID-19. METHODS: Tears were collected within 48 hours of laboratory confirmation using 3 methods: conjunctival swab plus Schirmer's test strips (group 1), conjunctival swab (group 2), and Schirmer's test strips (group 3). Samples from both the eyes of each patient were transported in a single viral transport media for real-time RT-PCR. Detailed demographic profiles, systemic symptoms, comorbidities, and ocular manifestations were noted. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Viral load of a sample was determined using cycle threshold (Ct) value of E gene. A specimen was considered to show positive results if the amplification curve for the E gene crossed the threshold line within 35 cycles and if it showed positive results on an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase or open reading frame 1b gene assay. RESULTS: Of the 78 patients enrolled in the study, samples from 3 patients were found to be inadequate for analysis. Thirty-six patients (48%) had moderate disease, whereas 39 patients (52%) had severe disease, with no ocular involvement in any patient. In the 75 patients, RT-PCR analysis of tears showed positive results in 18 patients (24%), and 29 of 225 samples (12.9%) showed positive results. Positive results were found in 11 (14.7%), 11 (14.7%), and 7 (9.3%) patients in groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively (P = 0.3105). Mean Ct values in groups 1, 2, and 3 were 28.36 ± 6.15, 29.00 ± 5.58, and 27.86 ± 6.46 (P = 0.92), respectively. Five patients showed positive RT-PCR results by all 3 methods (mean Ct value, 25.24 ± 6.33), and 12 patients showed positive results by any of the 3 methods (mean Ct value, 32.16 ± 1.94), the difference in Ct values being statistically significant (P = 0.029). The median value of symptomatology in patients with positive RT-PCR results from tears was 5 days (range, 4-9 days). CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in tears of 24% of patients with laboratory-proven moderate to severe COVID-19. Conjunctival swab remains the gold standard of tear collection for RT-PCR assay. A significantly higher possibility of viral transmission exists through tears in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19.","Arora, Ritu; Goel, Ruchi; Kumar, Sumit; Chhabra, Mohit; Saxena, Sonal; Manchanda, Vikas; Pumma, Palak",Ophthalmology,200,1

In order to streamline care at King's College Hospital (KCH), Paediatric Dentistry and Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (OMFS) have developed a collaborative working approach allowing patients to be treated effectively and to streamline patient care in the absence of easy access to general anaesthetic facilities. METHOD: Presenting complaints, treatment need and the treatment received were recorded for all paediatric patients presenting with dental pain and infection in the ""lockdown"" period (23rd March- 14th June) during ""normal"" working hours and ""out of hours"" to either paediatric dentistry or OMFS. RESULTS: 420 calls were triaged which converted to 67 patients seen face-to-face for oro-facial pain and infection. 41% of children were treated successfully under Local anaesthetic alone, only 13% required a general anaesthetic (GA) in the ""lockdown"" period. The vast majority of patients had antibiotics prescribed prior to attendance (80%). CONCLUSION: We have demonstrated the demographic, presenting complaints and treatment need of patients who presented to KCH during the lockdown period with dental pain and infection. The majority were able to be treated without needing for GA facilities. This paper highlights how a collaborative approach between paediatric dentistry and OMFS can help streamline patient care and is a model which can be adopted by other units in the event of further ""lockdowns"".","Ilyas, Nabeel; Sood, Sanjeev; Radia, Ria; Suffern, Rachael; Fan, Kathleen",Surg.

In these units, healthcare workers encounter daily work stressors which impact on their health and well-being. Also, previous literature revealed a passion for caring among these workers, finding two types: harmonious passion, which may protect them against negative outcomes, and obsessive passion, which may boost negative consequences. We aim to study whether both types of passion could moderate the relationships between daily work stressors and STS. METHODS: In all, 265 assessments were collected at ICUs from different hospitals in Spain through a diary approach (53 health workers × 5 days at two time points per day). RESULTS: First, daily work stressors were positive predictors of symptomatology; secondly, dispositional harmonious passion was a negative predictor of both compassion fatigue and shattered assumptions, also presenting a buffering effect between daily work stressors and daily shattered assumptions. Finally, dispositional obsessive passion showed positive relationships with both shattered assumptions and symptomatology, also presenting a boosting effect between daily work stressors and daily symptomatology. CONCLUSIONS: This study allows us to deepen our understanding of STS in ICUs and to boost preventive proposals.

METHODS: The clinical records of patients with macular dystrophy and biallelic variants in CDHR1 were reviewed. Data analysed included best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), fundus images: autofluorescence (AF) and optical coherence tomography (OCT); full field electroretinography (ERG) and pattern ERG (PERG). RESULTS: Seven patients from six pedigrees were ascertained. One patient was homozygous for a known synonymous variant p.(Pro261=), four were compound heterozygous for the p.(Pro261=) variant and a novel allele of CDHR1: p.(Gly188Ser), p.(Met1?), or p.(Val458Asp); one patient was compound heterozygous for two previously unreported variants: c.297+1G>T in trans with p.(Pro735Thr). The range of BCVA at the last clinic review was (6/5-6/60). Autofluorescence showed macular flecks of increased AF in mild cases and patches of reduced AF in severe cases. The OCT showed attenuation of the ellipsoid zone (EZ) in mild cases and loss of the EZ and the outer nuclear layer in severe cases; one patient had subfoveal hyporeflective region between the EZ and the retinal pigment epithelium. The full field ERG was normal or borderline subnormal in all cases, and the PERG was subnormal in mild cases or undetectable in severe cases. CONCLUSIONS: This report corroborates previous observations that genotypes distinct from those causing pan-retinal dystrophy can cause a milder phenotype, predominantly affecting the macula, and expands the spectrum of these genotypes. The findings in this cohort suggest a potential macular susceptibility to mild perturbations of the photoreceptor cadherin.","Ba-Abbad, Rola; Robson, Anthony G; Mahroo, Omar A; Wright, Genevieve; Schiff, Elena; Duignan, Emma S; Michaelides, Michel; Arno, Gavin; Webster, Andrew R",,200,16

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate and analyze the public's attention to events related to COVID-19 in China at the beginning of the COVID-19 epidemic (December 31, 2019, to February 20, 2020) through the Sina Microblog hot search list. METHODS: We collected topics related to the COVID-19 epidemic on the Sina Microblog hot search list from December 31, 2019, to February 20, 2020, and described the trend of public attention on COVID-19 epidemic-related topics. ROST Content Mining System version 6.0 was used to analyze the collected text for word segmentation, word frequency, and sentiment analysis. We further described the hot topic keywords and sentiment trends of public attention. We used VOSviewer to implement a visual cluster analysis of hot keywords and build a social network of public opinion content. RESULTS: The study has four main findings. First, we analyzed the changing trend of the public's attention to the COVID-19 epidemic, which can be divided into three stages. Second, the hot topic keywords of public attention at each stage were slightly different. Third, the emotional tendency of the public toward the COVID-19 epidemic-related hot topics changed from negative to neutral, with negative emotions weakening and positive emotions increasing as a whole. Fourth, we divided the COVID-19 topics with the most public concern into five categories: the situation of the new cases of COVID-19 and its impact, frontline reporting of the epidemic and the measures of prevention and control, expert interpretation and discussion on the source of infection, medical services on the frontline of the epidemic, and focus on the worldwide epidemic and the search for suspected cases. CONCLUSIONS: Our study found that social media (eg, Sina Microblog) can be used to measure public attention toward public health emergencies. During the epidemic of the novel coronavirus, a large amount of information about the COVID-19 epidemic was disseminated on Sina Microblog and received widespread public attention. We have learned about the hotspots of public concern regarding the COVID-19 epidemic. These findings can help the government and health departments better communicate with the public on health and translate public health needs into practice to create targeted measures to prevent and control the spread of COVID-19.","Zhao, Yuxin; Cheng, Sixiang; Yu, Xiaoyan; Xu, Huilan",J Med Internet Res,200,16

Many reports have documented that health care professionals are experiencing significant psychological morbidity as a result of providing essential care and services during the global COVID-19 pandemic. In these reports, pharmacists are not well represented, and, therefore, it is essential to understand the impact of COVID-19 on pharmacists across multiple practice settings. This is particularly true as the experiences of pharmacists working through previous pandemics and disasters, and the associated psychological burden, are likely to offer insights and be useful in supporting the psychological well-being of pharmacists during the global COVID-19 pandemic.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques have proved their capability in time series forecasting non-linear problems. In the present study, the relationship between weather factor and COVID-19 cases was assessed, and also developed a forecasting model using long short-term memory (LSTM), a deep learning model. The study found that the specific humidity has a strong positive correlation, whereas there is a negative correlation with maximum temperature, and a positive correlation with minimum temperature was observed in various geographic locations of India. The weather data and COVID-19 confirmed case data (1 April to 30 June 2020) were used to optimize univariate and multivariate LSTM time series forecast models. The optimized models were utilized to forecast the daily COVID-19 cases for the period 1 July 2020 to 31 July 2020 with 1 to 14 days of lead time. The results showed that the univariate LSTM model was reasonably good for the short-term (1 day lead) forecast of COVID-19 cases (relative error <20%). Moreover, the multivariate LSTM model improved the medium-range forecast skill (1-7 days lead) after including the weather factors. The study observed that the specific humidity played a crucial role in improving the forecast skill majorly in the West and northwest region of India.

Older age and being a care home resident were associated with increased mortality. SARS-CoV-2 genomes were available for 700 residents from 292 care homes. By integrating genomic and temporal data, 409 viral clusters within the 292 homes were identified, indicating two different patterns - outbreaks among care home residents and independent introductions with limited onward transmission.

Les données sont plus rares concernant les formes ambulatoires, ainsi que leur évolution à long terme. Nous décrivons ici les symptômes et leur persistance dans une cohorte de patients ambulatoires COVID-19. Matériels et méthodes Notre hôpital universitaire a utilisé un logiciel de télémédecine (MH LINK) comme moyen de surveillance des patients ambulatoires atteints de la COVID-19. Nous avons suivi grâce à ce logiciel 129 patients avec un diagnostic de la COVID-19 confirmé par prélèvement PCR nasopharyngé entre le 29/022020 et le 18/05/2020. Des auto-questionnaires ont été remplis en ligne, après recueil des antécédents et des données sociodémographiques, pour surveiller la survenue de symptômes respiratoires (fréquence respiratoire, température, essoufflement au repos, essoufflement à l’effort, fatigue, goût, odorat, mal de gorge, douleur thoracique et brûlure thoracique). Résultats La population décrite était de 87 femmes (67 %) et 42 hommes (33 %), avec une médiane d’âge de 42,2 ans. Vingt-huit personnes (24 %) étaient en surpoids dont 19 (16 %) obèses (IMC&gt;30), 15 (11,6 %) étaient immunodéprimés, 20 (15,5 %) avaient des troubles respiratoires chroniques préexistants, 3 (2,3 %) des antécédents cardiovasculaires, 5 étaient diabétiques, 12 avaient une hypertension artérielle et 2 une dyslipidémie. Les 129 patients ont été suivis initialement sur MH Link pendant une médiane de 31 jours (écart interquartile : 24–33 jours) à partir du j0 de leur diagnostic. Neufs personnes (8 %) ont été hospitalisées. Après évaluation le 13/07/2020, les 129 personnes ont été contactées par téléphone afin d’évaluer leur évolution clinique. Cinquante-cinq (42,3 %) d’entre elles n’étaient plus symptomatiques et étaient considérées guéries. Une personne était décédée. Dix-sept (13,1 %) personnes n’avaient pas répondu. Cinquante-six (43,08 %) étaient encore symptomatiques à la réévaluation (asthénie intense, n=14 ;anosmie/agueusie, n=21, symptômes respiratoires, n=15, anxiété/dépression n=5, céphalées n=6, atteinte cutanée, n=3).

Direct/indirect activation of Adenosine Monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and non-AMPK pathways, amongst others, are deemed to explain the molecular mechanisms of action of metformin. Metformin is an established insulin receptor sensitising antihyperglycemic agent, is highly affordable, and has superior safety and efficacy profiles. Emerging experimental and clinical evidence suggests that metformin has pleiotropic non-glycemic effects. Metformin appears to have weight stabilising, renoprotective, neuroprotective, cardio-vascular protective, and antineoplastic effects and mitigates polycystic ovarian syndrome. Anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects of metformin seem to qualify it as an adjunct therapy in treating infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, viral hepatitis, and the current novel Covid-19 infections. So far, metformin is the only prescription medicine relevant to the emerging field of senotherapeutics. Non-glycemic effects of metformin favourable to its repurposing in therapeutic use are hereby discussed.","Mbara, Kingsley C; Mofo Mato, Pascale E; Driver, Christine; Nzuza, Sanelisiwe; Mkhombo, Ntokozo T; Gcwensa, Senamile Kp; Mcobothi, Esethu N; Owira, Peter Mo",Eur J Pharmacol,200,1

Here we present a comprehensive analysis of the biogeography and ecophysiology of a widely distributed NCD, Gamma4. Gamma4 was the most abundant Gammaproteobacterial NCD along transects across the subtropical North Pacific. Using quantitative PCR, Gamma4 was detectable throughout the surface waters of North Pacific (7°N-55°N, 138°E-80°W), whereas GammaA was detected at <2/3 of the stations. Gamma4 was abundant during autumn-winter and positively correlated with chlorophyll a, while GammaA thrived during spring-summer and was positively correlated with temperature. Environmental clones affiliated with Gamma4 were widely detected in pelagic waters, oxygen minimum zones and even dinoflagellate microbiomes. By analysing the metabolic potential of a genome of Gamma4 reconstructed from the Tara Oceans dataset, we suggest that Gamma4 is a versatile heterotrophic NCD equipped with multiple strategies in scavenging phosphate (and iron) and for respiratory protection of nitrogenase. The transcription of nitrogenase genes is putatively regulated by Fnr-NifL-NifA and GlnD-GlnK systems that respond to intracellular oxygen and glutamate concentration. These results provide important implications for the potential life strategies of pelagic NCDs.","Cheung, Shunyan; Zehr, Jonathan P; Xia, Xiaomin; Tsurumoto, Chihiro; Endo, Hisashi; Nakaoka, Shin-Ichiro; Mak, Wingkwan; Suzuki, Koji; Liu, Hongbin",Environ. microbiol,200,24

The main aim of this study was to examine the psychometric properties of the Romanian version of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S), based on classical test theory and item response theory, namely, graded response model. The FCV-19S was translated into Romanian following a forward-backward translation procedure. The reliability and validity of the instrument were assessed in a sample of 809 adults (34.6% males; M age = 32.61; SD ±11.25; age range from 18 to 68 years). Results showed that the Romanian FCV-19S had very good internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = .88; McDonald's omega = .89; composite reliability = .89). The confirmatory factor analysis for one-factor FCV-19S based on the maximum likelihood estimation method with Satorra-Bentler correction for non-normality proved that the model fitted well (CFI = .99, TLI = .97, RMSEA = .06, 90% CI [.05, .09], SRMR = .01). As for criterion-related validity, the fear of COVID-19 score correlated with depression (r = .25, p < .01), stress (r = .45, p < .01), resilience (r = - .22, p < .01) and happiness (r = -.33, p < .01). The heterotrait-monotrait criteria less than .85 certified the discriminant validity of the FCV-19S-RO. The GRM analysis highlighted robust psychometric properties of the scale and measurement invariance across gender. These findings emphasized validity for the use of Romanian version of FCV-19S and expanding the existing body of research on the fear of COVID-19. Overall, the current research contributes to the literature not only by validating the FCV-19S-RO but also by considering the positive psychology approach in the study of fear of COVID-19, emphasizing a negative relationship among resilience, happiness and fear in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Stanculescu, Elena",Int J Ment Health Addict,200,16

We investigated the clinical characteristics and risk factors for liver injury in COVID-19 patients in Wuhan by retrospectively analyzing the epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory data for 218 COVID-19 patients and identifying the risk factors for liver injury by multivariate analysis. AIM: To investigate the clinical characteristics and risk factors for liver injury in COVID-19 patients in Wuhan. METHODS: The 218 patients included 94 males (43.1%), aged 22 to 94 (50.1 ± 18.4) years. Elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were present in 42 (53.2%) and 36 (45.6%) cases, respectively, and 79 (36.2%) patients had abnormally elevated transaminase levels at admission. Patients with liver injury were older than those with normal liver function by a median of 12 years, with a significantly higher frequency of males (68.4% vs 28.8%, P < 0.001) and more coexisting illnesses (48.1% vs 27.3%, P = 0.002). Significantly more patients had fever and shortness of breath (87.3% vs 69.8% and 29.1% vs 14.4%, respectively) in the liver injury group. Only 12 (15.2%) patients had elevated total bilirubin. ALT and AST levels were mildly elevated [1-3 × upper limit of normal (ULN)] in 86.1% and 92.9% of cases, respectively. Only two (2.5%) patients had an ALT or AST level > 5 × ULN. Elevated Î³-glutamyl transpeptidase was present in 45 (57.0%) patients, and 86.7% of these had a Î³-glutamyl-transpeptidase level < 135 U/L (3 × ULN). Serum alkaline phosphatase levels were almost normal in all patients. Patients with severe liver injury had a significantly higher frequency of abnormal transaminases than non-severe patients, but only one case had very high levels of aminotransferases. RESULTS: Multivariate analysis revealed that male sex, high D-dimer level, and high neutrophil percentage were linked to a higher risk of liver injury. The early stage of COVID-19 may be associated with mildly elevated aminotransferase levels in patients in Wuhan. Male sex and high D-dimer level and neutrophil percentage may be important predictors of liver injury in patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Male sex and high D-dimer level and neutrophil percentage may be important predictors of liver injury in patients with COVID-19.","Zhang, Hu; Liao, Yu-Sheng; Gong, Jing; Liu, Jing; Zhang, Heng",World J Gastroenterol,200,15

However, data regarding the effects of meteorological factors on its transmission are limited and inconsistent. A mechanism-based parameterisation scheme was developed to investigate the association between the scaled transmission rate (STR) of COVID-19 and the meteorological parameters in 20 provinces/municipalities located on the plains in China. We obtained information on the scale of population migrated from Wuhan, the world epicentre of the COVID-19 outbreak, into the study provinces/municipalities using mobile-phone positioning system and big data techniques. The highest STRs were found in densely populated metropolitan areas and in cold provinces located in north-eastern China. Population density had a non-linear relationship with disease spread (linearity index, 0.9). Among various meteorological factors, only temperature was significantly associated with the STR after controlling for the effect of population density. A negative and exponential relationship was identified between the transmission rate and the temperature (correlation coefficient, -0.56; 99% confidence level). The STR increased substantially as the temperature in north-eastern China decreased below 0 °C (the STR ranged from 3.5 to 12.3 when the temperature was between -9.41 °C and -13.87 °C), whilst the STR showed less temperature dependence in the study areas with temperate weather conditions (the STR was 1.21 ± 0.57 when the temperature was above 0 °C). Therefore, a higher population density was linearly whereas a lower temperature (<0 °C) was exponentially associated with an increased transmission rate of COVID-19. These findings suggest that the mitigation of COVID-19 spread in densely populated and/or cold regions will be a great challenge.","Lin, Changqing; Lau, Alexis K H; Fung, Jimmy C H; Guo, Cui; Chan, Jimmy W M; Yeung, David W; Zhang, Yumiao; Bo, Yacong; Hossain, Md Shakhaoat; Zeng, Yiqian; Lao, Xiang Qian",Sci Total Environ,200,30

We identify 43 protostellar outflows, including 37 highly likely ones and 6 candidates. The outflows are found toward both known high-mass star forming cores and less massive, seemingly quiescent cores, while 791 out of the 834 cores identified based on the continuum do not have detected outflows. The outflow masses range from less than 1~$M_\odot$ to a few tens of $M_\odot$, with typical uncertainties of a factor of 70. We do not find evidence of disagreement between relative molecular abundances in these outflows and in nearby analogs such as the well-studied L1157 and NGC7538S outflows. The results suggest that i) protostellar accretion disks driving outflows ubiquitously exist in the CMZ environment, ii) the large fraction of candidate starless cores is expected if these clouds are at very early evolutionary phases, with a caveat on the potential incompleteness of the outflows, iii) high-mass and low-mass star formation is ongoing simultaneously in these clouds, and iv) current data do not show evidence of difference between the shock chemistry in the outflows that determines the molecular abundances in the CMZ environment and in nearby clouds.","Lu, Xing; Li, Shanghuo; Ginsburg, Adam; Longmore, Steven N.; Kruijssen, J.

Much of the dialogue around testing has concentrated on how countries can scale up capacity, but the uncertainty in testing has not received nearly as much attention beyond asking if a test is accurate enough to be used. Even for highly accurate tests, false positives and false negatives will accumulate as mass testing strategies are employed under pressure, and these misdiagnoses could have major implications on the ability of governments to suppress the virus. The present analysis uses a modified SIR model to understand the implication and magnitude of misdiagnosis in the context of ending lockdown measures. The results indicate that increased testing capacity alone will not provide a solution to lockdown measures. The progression of the epidemic and peak infections is shown to depend heavily on test characteristics, test targeting, and prevalence of the infection. Antibody based immunity passports are rejected as a solution to ending lockdown, as they can put the population at risk if poorly targeted. Similarly, mass screening for active viral infection may only be beneficial if it can be sufficiently well targeted, otherwise reliance on this approach for protection of the population can again put them at risk. A well targeted active viral test combined with a slow release rate is a viable strategy for continuous suppression of the virus.","Gray, Nicholas; Calleja, Dominic; Wimbush, Alexander; Miralles-Dolz, Enrique; Gray, Ander; De Angelis, Marco; Derrer-Merk, Elfriede; Oparaji, Bright Uchenna; Stepanov, Vladimir; Clearkin, Louis; Ferson, Scott",PLoS One,200,24

Currently, very little is known about the underlying mechanisms, clinical course, and prognostic implications of comorbid COVID-19 in patients with GBS. We reviewed COVID-19-associated GBS case reports published since the outbreak of the pandemic, with a database search up to August 2020, including a manual search of the reference lists for additional relevant cases. Fifty-one (51) case reports of COVID-19 patients (aged 23-84 years) diagnosed with GBS in 11 different countries were included in this review. The results revealed atypical manifestations of GBS, including para-infectious profiles and onset of GBS without antecedent COVID-19 symptoms. Although all tested patients had signs of neuroinflammation, none had SARS-CoV-2 in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and only four (4) patients had antiganglioside antibodies. The majority had a 1- to 10-day time interval between the onset of COVID-19 and GBS symptoms, and many had a poor outcome, with 20 out of the 51 (39.2%) requiring mechanical ventilation, and two deaths within 12 to 24 h. The atypical manifestations of COVID-19-associated GBS, especially the para-infectious profile and short time interval between the onset of the COVID-19 and GBS symptoms, increase the likelihood of symptom overlap, which can complicate the treatment and result in worsened disease progression and/or higher mortality rates. Inclusion of a neurological assessment during diagnosis of COVID-19 might facilitate timely identification and effective management of the GBS symptoms and improve treatment outcome.","Kajumba, Mayanja M; Kolls, Brad J; Koltai, Deborah C; Kaddumukasa, Mark; Kaddumukasa, Martin; Laskowitz, Daniel T",SN Compr Clin Med,200,16

It has been a test for economic resilience, and how this crisis will affect business activities will be determined by their competitiveness. Only firms that have succeeded in reorienting and quickly adapting to the emerging crisis have continued without interruption in their operations, thus demonstrating their flexibility and high level of resilience. Research shows that companies driving the gig economy celebrate the benefits: flexibility, additional income, freedom and other various opportunities for workers. They require entrepreneurial digital skills that improve their competitiveness and benefit not only themselves but the economy as well. Therefore, digital competencies are becoming a significant resource and precondition for employment, and it is essential to promote digital entrepreneurial skills, introducing them into education programs through different forms of education. This book stresses and explores the importance of synergy between industry and virtual universities. Considering the importance of these issues, this book draws together literature on globalization and small and medium enterprise development and internationalization from disparate sources into a cohesive body of work, which traces the evolution of entrepreneurship and our understanding of the topic. It investigates the impact of digitalization on creating job opportunities in the labor market. Covering social, economic and psychological approaches to the most current topics, this book will be a useful framework to new theories and practices that are emerging to challenge conventional wisdom.

Meanwhile, recent studies provide compelling evidence on how contact distancing, the use of face masks, and handwashing habits can reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. In this context, we investigated the effect that these personal protection habits can have in preventing new waves of contagion. Methods: We extended an agent-based COVID-19 epidemic model in a simulated community to incorporate the mechanisms of these aforementioned personal care habits and measure their incidence in person-to-person transmission. A full factorial experiment design was performed to illustrate the extent to which the interplay between these personal habits is effective in mitigating the spread of disease. A global sensitivity analysis was performed on the parameters that control these habits to further validate the results. Results: We found that observing physical distance is the dominant habit in reducing disease transmission, although adopting either or both of the other two habits is necessary to some extent to suppress a new outbreak entirely. When physical distance is not observed, adherence to the use of masks or handwashing has a significant decrease in infections and mortality, but the epidemic still unfolds. We also found that in all scenarios, the combined effect of adhering to the three habits is more powerful than adopting them separately. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that a broad adherence of the population to voluntary self-care habits would help contain unfold of new outbreaks. The purpose of our model is illustrative and contributes to ratify the importance of urging citizens to adopt the amalgam of personal care habits as a primary collective protection measure to prevent communities from returning to confinements, while immunisation is carried out in late stages of the pandemic.","Álvarez-Pomar, Lindsay; Rojas-Galeano, Sergio",ScientificWorldJournal,200,24

Social distancing measures complicate regular care and result in lifestyle changes, which may indirectly cause psychological stress and worsening of PD symptoms. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with increased psychological distress and decreased physical activity in PD, how these changes related to PD motor and non-motor symptom severity, and what frequency and burden of COVID-related stressors were. METHODS: We sent an online survey to the Personalized Parkinson Project (PPP) cohort (nâ=â498 PD patients) in the Netherlands. In the survey, we distinguished between COVID-related stressor load, psychological distress, PD symptom severity, and physical activity. We related inter-individual differences to personality factors and clinical factors collected before the pandemic occurred. RESULTS: 358 PD patients completed the survey between April 21 and May 25, 2020 (response rate 71.9%). Patients with higher COVID-related stressor load experienced more PD symptoms, and this effect was mediated by the degree of psychological distress. 46.6% of PD patients were less physically active since the COVID-19 pandemic, and reduced physical activity correlated with worse PD symptoms. Symptoms that worsened most were rigidity, fatigue, tremor, pain and concentration. Presence of neuropsychiatric symptoms (anxiety, depression) before the pandemic, as well as cognitive dysfunction and several personality traits predicted increased psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: Our findings show how an external stressor (the COVID-19 pandemic) leads to a worsening of PD symptoms by evoking psychological distress as well as lifestyle changes (reduced physical activity).","van der Heide, Anouk; Meinders, Marjan J; Bloem, Bastiaan R; Helmich, Rick C",J Parkinsons Dis,200,9

Neuroinvasive and/or systemic infections are thought to increase risk for psychopathology via inflammatory mechanisms, particularly when exposure occurs during critical neurodevelopmental windows. Several human coronaviruses (HCoVs) have been associated with psychotic disorders and increasing reports of the neuropsychiatric manifestations of COVID-19 suggest it has neuroinvasive properties similar to those of other HCoVs. These properties, in conjunction with its ability to generate a massive inflammatory response, suggest that COVID-19 may also contribute to future psychopathology. This review will summarize the psychopathogenic mechanisms of viral infections and discuss the neuroinvasive and inflammatory properties of COVID-19 that could contribute to the development of psychotic disorders, with a focus on in utero, neonatal, and childhood exposure.","Kulaga, Stephanie S; Miller, Christopher W T",Neurosci Biobehav Rev,200,14

This increases their risk of cardiovascular disease, premature mortality, diabetes-related complications and mental health problems. There is a paucity of research that has evaluated interventions aimed at reducing and breaking up sitting in people with T2DM. The primary aim of this study is to assess the feasibility of delivering and evaluating a tailored intervention to reduce and break up sitting in ambulatory adults with T2DM. METHODS: This is a mixed-methods randomised controlled feasibility trial. Participants (n=70) with T2DM aged 18-85 years who sit &#8805;7 h/day and are able to ambulate independently will be randomly allocated to receive the REgulate your SItting Time (RESIT) intervention or usual care (control group) for 24 weeks. RESIT is a person-focused intervention that delivers a standardised set of behaviour change techniques to the participants, but the mode through which they are delivered can vary depending on the tools selected by each participant. The intervention includes an online education programme, health coach support, and a range of self-selected tools (smartphone apps, computer-prompt software, and wearable devices) that deliver behaviour change techniques such as self-monitoring of sitting and providing prompts to break up sitting. Measures will be taken at baseline, 12 and 24 weeks. Eligibility, recruitment, retention and data completion rates will be used to assess trial feasibility. Sitting, standing and stepping will be measured using a thigh-worn activity monitor. Cardiometabolic health, physical function, psychological well-being, sleep and musculoskeletal symptoms will also be assessed. A process evaluation will be conducted including evaluation of intervention acceptability and fidelity. DISCUSSION: This study will identify the feasibility of delivering a tailored intervention to reduce and break up sitting in ambulatory adults with T2DM and evaluating it through a randomised controlled trial (RCT) design. The findings will inform a fully powered RCT to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention.

The purpose of this study was to describe changes in the weight-related behaviors of children with obesity after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Semistructured interviews (n = 51) were conducted from April to June 2020 with parents of children with obesity. Families were participants in a randomized trial testing a clinic-community pediatric obesity treatment model. During interviews, families described their experience during the COVID-19 pandemic, with a particular emphasis on children's diet, physical activity, sleep, and screen time behaviors. Rapid qualitative analysis methods were used to identify themes around changes in children's weight-related behaviors. Results: The mean child age was 9.7 (±2.8) years and the majority of children were Black (46%) or Hispanic (39%) and from low-income families (62%). Most parent participants were mothers (88%). There were differences in the perceived physical activity level of children, with some parents attributing increases in activity or maintenance of activity level to increased outdoor time, whereas others reported a decline due to lack of outdoor time, school, and structured activities. Key dietary changes included increased snacking and more meals prepared and consumed at home. There was a shift in sleep schedules with children going to bed and waking up later and an increase in leisure-based screen time. Parents played a role in promoting activity and managing children's screen time. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic has created unique lifestyle challenges and opportunities for lifestyle modification.

We sought to understand whether these methods could achieve a diverse sample of participants. With more researchers turning to approaches that maintain social distancing in the context of COVID-19, it has become more pressing to refine these remote research methods. METHODS: We used several online sites to recruit for and conduct cognitive testing of survey items. To recruit potential participants we advertised the study on the free online bulletin board, Craigslist, and the free online social network, Reddit. Interested participants completed an online Qualtrics screening form. To maximize diversity, we purposefully selected individuals to invite for participation. We used the video meeting platform, Zoom, to conduct the cognitive interviews. The interviewer opened a document with the items to be tested, shared the screen with the participant, and gave them control of the mouse and keyboard. After the participant self-administered the survey, the interviewer asked about interpretation and comprehension. After completion of the interviews we sent participants a follow-up survey about their impressions of the research methods and technologies used. We describe the processes, the advantages and disadvantages, and offer recommendations for researchers. RESULTS: We recruited and interviewed 30 young people from a range of regions, gender identities, sexual orientations, ages, education, and experiences with sexual activity. These methods allowed us to recruit a purposefully selected diverse sample in terms of race/ethnicity and region. It also may have offered potential participants a feeling of safety and anonymity leading to greater participation from gay, lesbian, and transgender people who would not have agreed to participate in-person. Conducting the interviews using video chat may also have facilitated the inclusion of individuals who would not volunteer for in-person meetings. Disadvantages of video interviewing included participant challenges to finding a private space for the interview and problems with electronic devices. CONCLUSIONS: Online technologies can be used to achieve a diverse sample of research participants, contributing to research findings that better respond to young people's unique identities and situations.","Upadhyay, Ushma D; Lipkovich, Heather",BMC Med Res Methodol,200,1

We use a novel dataset that we collected to monitor the three countries during the crisis. As outcome variables, we used expectations (e.g., economic outlook, labour market situation, recovery), fear (e.g., scenario of new outburst, economic depression, restriction to individual rights and freedom), and behavioural change across the following dimensions: savings, cultural consumption, social capital, and risky behaviour. We provide descriptive evidence that is representative of the population of interest, and we estimate the impact of exposure to shock occurred during the crisis on the same outcome variables, using matching techniques. Our main findings are the following: we detected systematically negative expectations regarding the future and the recovery, majoritarian fears of an economic depression, a new outbreak, and a permanent restriction on freedom, a reduction in saving and in social capital. Exposure to shocks decreased expected job prospects, increased withdrawal from accumulated savings, and reduced contacts with the network relevant to job advancement, whereas it had inconclusive effects over fears.

In the absence of specific drugs or safe and effective vaccines for these infections, their control relies mainly on vector control measures. The emergence of insecticide resistance in vectors, especially against pyrethroids, is a serious threat to the insecticide-based vector control programme. This study reports the presence of multiple knockdown resistance (kdr) mutations present in an Ae. aegypti population from Bengaluru (India), including a new mutation F1534L. METHODS: Aedes aegypti collected from Bengaluru were subjected to insecticide susceptibility tests with DDT, deltamethrin and permethrin. The DNA sequencing of partial domain II, III and IV of the voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) was performed to screen kdr mutations present in the population and PCR-based assays were developed for their detection. Genotyping of kdr mutations was done using PCR-based assays, allelic frequencies were determined, and tests of genetic association of kdr mutations with the insecticide resistance phenotype were performed. RESULTS: The Ae. aegypti population was resistant to DDT, deltamethrin and permethrin. The DNA sequencing of the VGSC revealed the presence of four kdr mutations, i.e. S989P and V1016G in domain II and two alternative kdr mutations F1534C and F1534L in domain III. Allele-specific PCR assays (ASPCR) were developed for the detection of kdr mutations S989P and V1016G and an existing PCR-RFLP based strategy was modified for the genotyping of all three known kdr mutations in domain III (F1534L, F1534C and T1520I). Genotyping of Ae. aegypti samples revealed a moderate frequency of S989P/V1016G (18.27%) and F1534L (17.48%), a relatively high frequency of F1534C (50.61%) and absence of T1520I in the population. Mutations S989P and V1016G were in complete linkage disequilibrium in this population while they were in linkage equilibrium with kdr mutations F1534C and F1534L. The alleles F1534C and F1534L are genetically associated with permethrin resistance. CONCLUSIONS: A new kdr mutation, F1534L, was found in an Ae. aegypti population from Bengaluru (India), co-occurring with the other three mutations S989P, V1016G and F1534C. The findings of a new mutation have implications for insecticide resistance management.","Kushwah, Raja Babu S; Kaur, Taranjeet; Dykes, Cherry L; Ravi Kumar, H; Kapoor, Neera; Singh, Om P",Parasit Vectors,200,16

This sequela seems to be the most frequent disabling outcome, leading to a delay in social reintegration and return to working life.We suggest that spa facilities including multidisciplinary interventions and trained staffs could be an appropriate setting for providing rehabilitative protocols to treat chronic fatigue in post COVID-19 subjects. Spa treatments may improve the physical symptoms of chronic fatigue and modulate the immune imbalance, reducing persisting inflammation. Moreover, in the spa setting, specific respiratory rehabilitation and neuropsychological interventions could be provided. The rehabilitative protocol could also properly address comorbidities.In conclusion, respecting the hygiene and preventive measures, the spa setting could represent the appropriate environment to take care of post-COVID chronic fatigue, offering adequate and multidisciplinary rehabilitation protocols.

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Academic university hospital. PATIENTS: Ninety-seven patients with delayed benign gynecologic procedures owing to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. INTERVENTION(S): Surgical prioritization was assessed using 2 novel scoring systems, the Gynecologic Medically-Necessary Time-Sensitive (Gyn-MeNTS) and modified Elective Surgery Acuity Scale (mESAS) systems for all 93 patients included. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The interrater reliability and validity of 2 novel surgical prioritization systems (Gyn-MeNTS and mESAS) were assessed. The Gyn-MeNTS scores were calculated by 3 raters and analyzed as continuous variables, with a lower score indicating more urgency/priority. The mESAS score was calculated by 2 raters and analyzed as a 3-level ordinal variable with a higher score indicating more urgency/priority. All 5 raters were blinded to reduce bias. The Gyn-MeNTS interrater reliability was tested using Spearman r and paired t tests were used to detect systematic differences between raters. Weighted &#954; indicated mESAS reliability. Concurrent validity with mESAS and surgeon self-prioritization (SSP) was examined with Spearman r and logistic regression. Spearman r's for all Gyn-MeNTS rater pairs were above 0.80 (0.84 for 1 vs 2; 0.82 for 1 vs 3; and 0.82 for 2 vs 3, all p <.001) indicating strong agreement. The weighted &#954; for the 2 mESAS raters was 0.57 (95% confidence interval, 0.40-0.73) indicating moderate agreement. When used together, both scores were significantly independently associated with SSP, with strong discrimination (area under the curve, 0.89). CONCLUSION: Interrater reliability is acceptable for both scoring systems, and concurrent validity of each is moderate for predicting SSP, but discrimination improves to a high level when they are used together.","Marfori, Cherie Q; Klebanoff, Jordan S; Wu, Catherine Z; Barnes, Whitney A; Carter-Brooks, Charelle M; Amdur, Richard L",J. minim. invasive gynecol,200,29

Concepts regarding a first case in Spain,13.042427,9.358125,2020,"The disclosed study undertook a 'human centred-approach' that ascertained and categorised environmental human thermophysiological risk factors by relating them to the human biometeorological system through the use of three widely utilised energy balance model (EBM) indices, the physiologically equivalent temperature (PET), the modified PET, and the universal thermal climate index (UTCI). The disclosed assessment was carried out over the past decade (i.e., 2010-2019) with a 3-h temporal resolution for the case of Ankara through two WMO meteorological stations to compare both local urban and peri-urban environmental conditions. The study recognised extreme annual variability of human physiological stress (PS) during the different seasons as a result of the biometeorological processing of the singular variables, which in the case of average PET for both stations, varied by up to 75 °C between the winter and summer for the same annual dataset (2012). In addition, all EBMs indicated higher heat stress within the city centre that were conducive of both urban extreme heatwaves and very hot days during the summer months, with extreme heat stress levels lasting for longer than a week with PET values reaching a maximum of 48 °C. Similar cold extremes were found for the winter months, with PET values reaching - 30 °C, and average PS levels varying lower in the case of the peri-urban station.

In this paper, fear and its possible forthcoming consequences on health will be investigated and discussed. Fear is an innate reactive emotion to the immediate threats produced by danger. It is hardwired within subcortical survival circuits and originally had to defend the organism from predators. Besides, fear is a cognitive emotional process mediated by the cortical structures, and implies a subjective evaluation both at implicit (subsymbolic, unconscious) and explicit (symbolic, conscious) levels. Within a defensive taxonomy framework, fear can be defined as a reflex triggering a prompt behavior aimed at surviving from predating attacks (freezing), whereas anxiety as a deliberate pattern aimed at planning behaviors for anticipating and avoiding future harm. Fear and anxiety overlap at a subjective level, but are generated by different neurobiological networks and serve different evolutionary goals. The current viral danger and the need for social distancing worsen the sense of loneliness. A wide body of experimental and epidemiological literature evidence that psychological stress, social isolation, and loneliness have a detrimental effect on multiple health-related outcomes including comorbidity, multimorbidity, and mortality. The negative effects can be even higher for people currently living a massive limitation of physical and interpersonal contacts. A strong effort to integrate psychological and medical care is needed to face post-pandemic health issues.","Porcelli, Piero",Clin. Neuropsychiatry,200,20

Recently, the role of frailty status in adverse clinical outcomes for COVID-19-infected patients has received increasing attention with controversial results. Hence, we will conduct a comprehensive dose-response meta-analysis to quantitatively evaluate the association between frailty status and adverse clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: The researchers will systematically search PubMed, EMBase, Cochrane Library, ISI Knowledge via Web of Science and MedRxiv or BioRxiv databases (from inception until December 2020) to identify all retrospective and prospective cohort studies. All-cause mortality during hospitalisation will be set as the primary outcome. Univariable or multivariable meta-regression and subgroup analyses will be conducted for the comparison between frail versus non-frail categories. Sensitivity analyses will be used to assess the robustness of our results by removing each included study one at a time to obtain and evaluate the remaining overall estimates of all-cause mortality. To conduct a dose-response meta-analysis for the potential linear or restricted cubic spline regression relationship between frailty status and all-cause mortality, studies with three or more categories will be included. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: In accordance with the Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Baotou Medical College, ethical approval is not an essential element for the systematic review protocol.

A secondary objective was to explore if GPs' individual characteristics and type of practice determined their adaptation. DESIGN: Observational study using an online questionnaire. Organisational changes were measured by a main question and detailed in two specific outcomes. To identify which GPs' characteristics impacted organisational changes, successive multivariate logistic modelling was performed. First, we identified the GPs' characteristics related to organisational changes with a univariate analysis. Then, we tested the adjusted associations between this variable and the following GPs' characteristics: age, gender and type of practice. SETTING: The questionnaire was administered online between 14 March and 21 March 2020. Practitioners were recruited by email using the contact lists of different French scientific GP societies. PARTICIPANTS: The target population was GPs currently practising in France (n=46 056). We obtained a total of 7481 responses. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome: Proportion of GPs who adapted their practice. Secondary outcome: GPs' characteristics related to organisational changes. RESULTS: Among the 7481 responses, 5425 were complete and were analysed. 3849 GPs (70.9%) changed their activity, 3605 GPs (66.5%) increased remote consultations and 2315 GPs (42.7%) created a specific pathway for probable patients with COVID-19. Among the 3849 GPs (70.9%) who changed their practice, 3306 (91.7%) gave more answers by phone, 996 (27.6%) by email and 1105 (30.7%) increased the use of video consultations. GPs working in multi-professional group practices were more likely to have changed their activity since the beginning of the epidemic wave than GPs working in mono-professional group or single medical practices (adjusted OR: 1.32, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.56, p=0.001). CONCLUSIONS: French GPs adapted their practices regarding access to care for patients in the context of the COVID-19 epidemic. This adaptation was higher in multi-professional group practices.","Saint-Lary, Olivier; Gautier, Sylvain; Le Breton, Julien; Gilberg, Serge; Frappé, Paul; Schuers, Matthieu; Bourgueil, Yann; Renard, Vincent",BMJ Open,200,24

Observed effects on the central nervous system include neurological symptoms (headache, nausea, dizziness), fatal microclot formation and in rare cases encephalitis. However, our understanding of how the virus causes these mild to severe neurological symptoms and how the cerebral vasculature is impacted remains unclear. Thus, the results presented in this report explored whether deleterious outcomes from the SARS-CoV-2 viral spike protein on primary human brain microvascular endothelial cells (hBMVECs) could be observed. The spike protein, which plays a key role in receptor recognition, is formed by the S1 subunit containing a receptor binding domain (RBD) and the S2 subunit. First, using postmortem brain tissue, we show that the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 or ACE2 (a known binding target for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein), is ubiquitously expressed throughout various vessel calibers in the frontal cortex. Moreover, ACE2 expression was upregulated in cases of hypertension and dementia. ACE2 was also detectable in primary hBMVECs maintained under cell culture conditions. Analysis of cell viability revealed that neither the S1, S2 or a truncated form of the S1 containing only the RBD had minimal effects on hBMVEC viability within a 48 h exposure window. Introduction of spike proteins to invitro models of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) showed significant changes to barrier properties. Key to our findings is the demonstration that S1 promotes loss of barrier integrity in an advanced 3D microfluidic model of the human BBB, a platform that more closely resembles the physiological conditions at this CNS interface. Evidence provided suggests that the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins trigger a pro-inflammatory response on brain endothelial cells that may contribute to an altered state of BBB function. Together, these results are the first to show the direct impact that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein could have on brain endothelial cells; thereby offering a plausible explanation for the neurological consequences seen in COVID-19 patients.","Buzhdygan, Tetyana P; DeOre, Brandon J; Baldwin-Leclair, Abigail; Bullock, Trent A; McGary, Hannah M; Khan, Jana A; Razmpour, Roshanak; Hale, Jonathan F; Galie, Peter A; Potula, Raghava; Andrews, Allison M; Ramirez, Servio H",Neurobiol Dis,200,24

Valuable insights gained from previous humanitarian crises indicate undesirable short and long-term adolescent maternal consequences in low resource settings. Young girls are at a higher risk of dropping out of school and being forced into early child marriages and high-risk jobs that predispose them to sexual exploitation and sexual and gender-based violence. Economic recessions, supply chain disruptions and reallocation of resources may limit access and utilisation of services and commodities. The COVID-19 pandemic thus indirectly exposes adolescent girls to multiplied risks of unintended pregnancies, sexually transmitted infections including HIV and Human Papilloma Virus. Sexual and gender-based violence, including female genital mutilation cases may increase as intervention programmes to avert these are disrupted, and the resultant psychosocial and socioeconomic consequences may be devastating. Thus, a pro-active approach is required to come up with frameworks to ensure the minimum initial service package for reproductive health.

People's turning to social media for trans-local news on COVID-19 has stirred great ire in the world. This led to the proliferation of dark images that associate the viral catastrophe with the end as we know it. To problematize the idea of the apocalypse (or the end) this paper speaks of three moments of survival in human existence: the beneath, the behind and the beyond. We argue that the apocalyptic nature of the pandemic and its global horrorism are part of a congeries of apocalyptic simulations that have always been part of the narrative with which we try to define our existence on earth. This paper masks itself against perfunctory examinations of the term apocalypse, and offers instead an understanding that runs along the lines of its Greek etymological sense as apokalyptein (revelation). It offers what Foucault calls an ontology of the present, that interrogates the history of COVID -19 with an emphasis neither on its origin nor on its telos. As beyondists, the COVID-19 catastrophe has revealed to us that 1) we have 'access to knowledge beyond knowledge' (see Gumpert 2012), and therefore that 2) our modern predicament is not very modern. The end, (not) to be sure, has been lived and relived in the boundary between reality and simulation.

OBJECTIVES: The present study aims to investigate the symptoms and causes of SSD of ICU nurses treating COVID-19 pneumonia. The research results are expected to provide evidence for the establishment of a better management strategy. METHODS: This study enrolled a total of 140 ICU nurses who were selected by Jiangsu Province Hospital to work in Wuhan (the epicenter of the COVID-19 epidemic in China) on February 3, 2020. A questionnaire, Somatic symptom disorders for ICU nurses in Wuhan No. 1 Hospital, was designed based on the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health. Exploratory factor analysis was performed to cluster the symptoms and logistic regression analysis to find the risk factors of the symptoms. RESULTS: Five major symptoms were chest discomfort and palpitation (31.4%), dyspnea (30.7%), nausea (21.4%), headache (19.3%), and dizziness (17.9%). In exploratory factor analysis, the symptoms were classified into three clusters: Cluster A of breathing and sleep disturbances (dizziness, sleepiness, and dyspnea); Cluster B of gastrointestinal complaints and pain (nausea and headache), and Cluster C of general symptoms (xerostomia, fatigue, as well as chest discomfort and palpitation). In Cluster A, urine/feces splash, sex, and sputum splash were independent predictive factors. In Cluster B, fall of protective glasses and urine/feces splash were independent predictive factors. In Cluster C, urine/feces splash and urine/feces clearance were independent predictive factors. CONCLUSION: The ICU nurses in Wuhan showed varying and overlapping SSDs. These SSDs could be classified into three symptom clusters. Based on the characteristics of their SSDs, specific interventions could be implemented to safeguard the health of ICU nurses.","Yifan, Tang; Ying, Liu; Chunhong, Gao; Jing, Song; Rong, Wang; Zhenyu, Li; Zejuan, Gu; Peihung, Liao",J Pain Symptom Manage,200,32

Currently, researches to develop vaccines and treatments is going on globally to cope with this disastrous disease. Main protease (3CLpro) from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is one of the good targets to find antiviral agents before vaccines are available. Some flavonoids are known to inhibit 3CLpro from SARS-CoV which causes SARS. Since their sequence identity is 96%, a similar approach was performed with a flavonoid library. Baicalin, herbacetin, and pectolinarin have been discovered to block the proteolytic activity of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro. An in silico docking study showed that the binding modes of herbacetin and pectolinarin are similar to those obtained from the catalytic domain of SARS-CoV 3CLpro. However, their binding affinities are different due to the usage of whole SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro in this study. Baicalin showed an effective inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro and its docking mode is different from those of herbacetin and pectolinarin.

Different diagnostic tools, such as Chest X-ray (CXR), lung ultrasound (LUS), and computerized tomography (CT), have been used to detect active pneumonic lesions associated with COVID-19 with their varying degrees of sensitivity and specificity. This study was undertaken to investigate the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with a pneumonic lung lesion detected by CT that is not detected by CXR. A total of 156 COVID-19 patients hospitalized at three nationally designated South Korean hospitals with no active lesion detected by CXR but on clinical suspicion of pneumonia underwent the CT examination and were enrolled. Medical records, which included demographic and clinical features, including comorbidity, symptoms, radiological, and laboratory findings on admission, were reviewed and analyzed. The risk factors of pneumonia detected by CT for patients without an active lesion detected by CXR were investigated. Of the 156 patients without an active lesion detected by CXR, 35 (22.44%) patients were found to have pneumonia by CT. The patients with pneumonia defined by CT were older than those without (64.1 years vs. 41.2 years). Comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, preexisting stroke, and dementia were more common among patients with pneumonia defined by CT than those without. Serum albumin level, C-reactive protein (CRP), stroke, and age &#8805; 70 years were significantly associated with pneumonia defined by CT after adjustment for age. In multivariable regression analysis, serum albumin level (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 0.123, 95% CI = (0.035-0.429)) and preexisting stroke (AOR = 11.447, 95% CI = (1.168-112.220)) significantly and independently predicted pneumonia detection by CT.

Another severe damage is hypoxemia in patients that do not receive adequate respiratory support. The neurological symptoms that the patient presents, will depend on factors that condition the expression of ACE2 in the brain such as age and sex, as well as the mechanism of neuronal invasion, the immune response and the general state of the patient.

High levels of loneliness, high levels of COVID-19-specific worry, and low distress tolerance were significantly associated with clinical levels of depression, anxiety, and PTSD symptoms. Resilience was associated with low levels of depression and anxiety symptoms but not PTSD. Most respondents had high levels of social support; social support from family, but not from partner or peers, was associated with low levels of depression and PTSD. Compared to Whites, Asian Americans were less likely to report high levels across mental health symptoms, and Hispanic/Latinos were less likely to report high levels of anxiety.

Businesses that rely heavily on face-to-face communication or close physical proximity when producing a product or providing a service are particularly vulnerable. There is, however, no systematic evidence about the role of human interactions across different lines of business and about which will be the most limited by social distancing. Here we provide theory-based measures of the reliance of U.S. businesses on human interaction, detailed by industry and geographic location. We find that 49 million workers work in occupations that rely heavily on face-to-face communication or require close physical proximity to other workers. Our model suggests that when businesses are forced to reduce worker contacts by half, they need a 12 percent wage subsidy to compensate for the disruption in communication. Retail, hotels and restaurants, arts and entertainment and schools are the most affected sectors. Our results can help target fiscal assistance to businesses that are most disrupted by social distancing.","Koren, Mikl'os; PetHo, Rita",,200,26

We aimed to investigate whether physical activity, and the timing and balance of physical activity and sleep/rest, were associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity and COVID-19 severity. Data from 91,248 UK Biobank participants with accelerometer data and complete covariate and linked COVID-19 data to July 19, 2020, were included. The risk of SARS-CoV-2 positivity and COVID-19 severity-in relation to overall physical activity, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), balance between activity and sleep/rest, and variability in timing of sleep/rest-was assessed with adjusted logistic regression. Of 207 individuals with a positive test result, 124 were classified as having a severe infection. Overall physical activity and MVPA were not associated with severe COVID-19, whereas a poor balance between activity and sleep/rest was (odds ratio [OR] per standard deviation: 0.71; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.62 to 0.81]). This finding was related to higher daytime activity being associated with lower risk (OR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.61 to 0.93) but higher movement during sleep/rest being associated with higher risk (OR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.42) of severe infection. Greater variability in timing of sleep/rest was also associated with increased risk (OR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.08 to 1.35). Results for testing positive were broadly consistent. In conclusion, these results highlight the importance of not just physical activity, but also quality sleep/rest and regular sleep/rest patterns, on risk of COVID-19. Our findings indicate the risk of COVID-19 was consistently approximately 1.2-fold greater per approximately 40-minute increase in variability in timing of proxy measures of sleep, indicative of irregular sleeping patterns.","Rowlands, Alex V; Kloecker, David E; Chudasama, Yogini; Davies, Melanie J; Dawkins, Nathan P; Edwardson, Charlotte L; Gillies, Clare; Khunti, Kamlesh; Razieh, Cameron; Islam, Nazrul; Zaccardi, Francesco; Yates, Tom",Mayo Clin Proc,200,1

While the analogous event in China appears to be under control at the moment, the outbreaks in western countries are still at an early stage of development. Italy, at present, is playing a major role in understanding the transmission dynamics of these new infections and evaluating the effectiveness of control measures in a western social context. METHODS: We combined a quarantined model with early-stage development data in Italy (during the period February 20th-March 30th) to predict longer-term progression (from March 30th, till June 25th, 2020 in a long-term view) with different control measures. Due to significant variations in the control strategies, which have been changing over time, and thanks to the introduction of detection technologies leading to faster confirmation of the SARS-CoV-2 infections, we made use of time-dependent contact and diagnosis rates to estimate when the effective daily reproduction ratio can fall below 1. Within the same framework, we analyze the possible secondary infection event after relaxing the isolation measures. OUTCOMES AND INTERPRETATION: We study two simplified scenarios compatible with the observation data and the effects of two stringent measures on the evolution of the epidemic. On one side, the contact rate must be kept as low as possible, but it is also clear that, in a modern developed country, it cannot fall under certain minimum levels and for a long time. The complementary parameter tuned is the transition rate of the symptomatic infected individuals to the quarantined class, a parameter Î´ I I connected with the time t I = 1/Î´I needed to perform diagnostic tests. Within the conditions of the outbreak in Italy, this time must fall under 12-8 h in order to make the reproduction number less than 1 to minimize the case numbers. Moreover, we show how the same parameter plays an even more important role in mitigating the effects of a possible secondary infection event.","Traini, Marco Claudio; Caponi, Carla; Ferrari, Riccardo; De Socio, Giuseppe Vittorio",Infect Dis (Lond),200,14

In this study, we aimed to review and depict the common MRI features of COVID-19 pneumonia in our laboratory confirmed case series, the first comprehensive reported cohort in the literature. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Upon IRB approval, eight laboratory confirmed COVID-19 patients who presented to our outpatient imaging clinic underwent chest CT and, once various features of COVID-19 pneumonia were identified, a dedicated multisequence chest MRI was performed on the same day with an institutional protocol. Demographic data and the morphology, laterality and location of the lesions were recorded for each case. RESULTS: Five males and three females with the mean age of 40.63 ± 12.64 years old were present in this case series. Five cases had typical CT features with ground glass opacities and consolidations, readily visible on different MRI sequences. Three cases had indeterminate or atypical features which were also easily seen on MRI. The comprehensive review of MRI features for each case and representative images have been illustrated. CONCLUSION: Becoming familiar with typical findings of COVID-19 pneumonia in MRI is crucial for every radiologist. Although MRI is not the modality of choice for evaluation of pulmonary opacities, it has similar capabilities in detection of COVID-19 pneumonia when compared to chest CT.","Torkian, Pooya; Rajebi, Hamid; Zamani, Taraneh; Ramezani, Naghi; Kiani, Pejman; Akhlaghpoor, Shahram",Clin Imaging,200,15

The aim of our work is to expose the activity of kidney transplantation in Cantabria during the state of alarm, as well as to assess the safety of the transplantation program. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective study of kidney transplants performed in our Center from the beginning of the state of alarm until the beginning of the lockdown easing in Cantabria. Descriptive analysis of the demographic data of recipients and their donors, intraoperative data and postoperative outcomes. Comparative analysis with the data of the same period in 2017-2019, by means of the &#967;2 for categorical variables, Student's T and Mann-Whitney U tests in case of quantitative variables of normal and non-normal distribution, respectively. RESULTS: Fifteen kidney transplants were performed in the period described. Delayed renal function (DRF) was seen in 7.5% of patients, and 26.6% showed data of acute rejection; no patient presented COVID-19 disease. Comparative analysis showed a remarkable increase in the number of transplants in comparison with previous periods (15 vs 5.6), at the expense of donors from outside Cantabria (93.3%). We found no statistically significant differences in terms of cold ischemia time (p=0.77), DRF (p=0.73), need for dialysis (p=0.54), or appearance of post-surgical complications (p=0.61). CONCLUSIONS: The evolution of the pandemic in our region, and the adoption of strict protective measures has allowed the early and safe resumption of the renal transplantation program, increasing the number of transplants performed compared to previous years and maintaining comparable early post-operative results.","Calleja Hermosa, P; Varea Malo, R; Campos Juanatey, F; Rodrigo Calabia, E; Aguilera Fernández, A; Fernández Guzmán, E; Domínguez Esteban, M; Ballestero Diego, R; Zubillaga Guerrero, S; Gutiérrez Baños, J L",Actas urol. esp,200,29

We exploit a panel component of our design (N = 4,910) to strongly link anti-intellectualism and within-respondent change in mask usage. Finally, we provide experimental evidence of anti-intellectualism's importance in information search behaviour with two conjoint studies (N ~ 2,500) that show that preferences for COVID-19 news and COVID-19 information from experts dissipate among respondents with higher levels of anti-intellectual sentiment.

By considering the most up to date information on GDP and carbon intensity of production, this paper represents one of the first attempts to estimate the CO2 emissions change that have taken place in Europe during the first six months of 2020. Results show that more than 195,600 thousand tons of CO2 have been avoided between January and June 2020, compared to the same period of the previous year, representing a -12.1% emissions change. The largest reductions have taken place in the Manufacturing, Wholesale, Retail Trade, Transport, Accommodation and Food Service sectors, accounting for more than 93.7% of total CO2 change. Spain, Italy and France have been the most affected areas with -106,600 thousand tons emissions drop. In line with the results provided by previous studies, this paper highlights that the geographical and the sectoral distribution of the CO2 emissions change has been largely influenced by the magnitude of the COVID-19 impacts. In addition, the carbon intensity of production, characterizing the most affected economic activities, has been the main element of differentiation compared to the previous 2008 crisis. By providing preliminary estimation of the CO2 emissions change that have taken place across geographical and sectoral activities, this paper contributes to the existing climate policy debate and can support future estimation of CO2 variations both in a context of confinement release as well as in a context of reintroduced COVID-19 restrictions.","Andreoni, Valeria",Sci Total Environ,200,1

Epidemiological data show that obesity and diabetes are among the main risk factors associated with high morbidity and mortality. The increased susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection documented in obesity-related metabolic derangements argues for initial defects in defence mechanisms, most likely due to an elevated systemic metabolic inflammation (""metaflammation""). The NLRP3 inflammasome is a master regulator of metaflammation and has a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of either obesity or diabetes. Here, we discuss the most recent findings suggesting contribution of NLRP3 inflammasome to the increase in complications in COVID-19 patients with diabesity. We also review current pharmacological strategies for COVID-19, focusing on treatments whose efficacy could be due, at least in part, to interference with the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome.

However, it is unclear when IRM should be preferred over the widely-employed empirical risk minimization (ERM) framework. In this work, we analyze both these frameworks from the perspective of sample complexity, thus taking a firm step towards answering this important question. We find that depending on the type of data generation mechanism, the two approaches might have very different finite sample and asymptotic behavior. For example, in the covariate shift setting we see that the two approaches not only arrive at the same asymptotic solution, but also have similar finite sample behavior with no clear winner. For other distribution shifts such as those involving confounders or anti-causal variables, however, the two approaches arrive at different asymptotic solutions where IRM is guaranteed to be close to the desired OOD solutions in the finite sample regime, while ERM is biased even asymptotically. We further investigate how different factors -- the number of environments, complexity of the model, and IRM penalty weight -- impact the sample complexity of IRM in relation to its distance from the OOD solutions","Ahuja, Kartik; Wang, Jun; Dhurandhar, Amit; Shanmugam, Karthikeyan; Varshney, Kush R.",,200,20

However, due to the complexity and relatively high-cost of many immunity assays and the needs for blood-drawing specialists, these assays were mostly limited to small-scale clinical studies. Our work demonstrated the potential of a non-invasive, inexpensive and data-driven solution for large-scale immunity surveillance and for predictive modeling of vaccine efficacy. Combining a proprietary saliva processing method and an ultra-sensitive digital detection technology, we were able to rapidly gather information regarding personalized immune response following infection or vaccination, monitor temporal evolution, and optimize predictive models for variant protection.","Momyer, Victoria SA.; Dixon, Samantha; Liu, Q.

In this work, the catalytic mechanism of Mpro was studied using the full model of the enzyme and a computational QM/MM methodology with a 69/72-atoms QM region treated at DLPNO-CCSD(T)/CBS//B3LYP/6-31G(d,p):AMBER level and including the catalytic important oxyanion-hole residues. The transition state of each step was fully characterized and described together with the related reactants and products. The rate-limiting step of the catalytic process is the hydrolysis of the thioester-enzyme adduct, and the calculated barrier closely agrees with the available kinetic data. The calculated Gibbs free energy profile, together with the full atomistic detail of the structures involved in catalysis, can now serve as valuable models for the rational drug design of transition state analogs as new inhibitors targeting the SARS-CoV-2 virus.","Fernandes, Henrique S; Sousa, Sérgio F; Cerqueira, Nuno M F S A",Mol. divers,200,1

As a diabetes care center specialized in technology, we developed a virtual training program for patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) who were upgrading to hybrid closed loop (HCL) system. The aim of this study is to describe the efficacy and safety outcomes of the virtual training program. METHOD: ology: A prospective observational cohort study was performed, including patients with diagnosis of T1D previously treated with multiple doses of insulin (MDI) or sensor augmented pump therapy (SAP) who were updating to HCL system, from March to July 2020. Virtual training and follow-up were done through the Zoom video conferencing application and Medtronic Carelink System version 3.1 software. CGM data were analyzed to compare the time in range (TIR), time below range (TBR) and glycemic variability, during the first two weeks corresponding to manual mode with the final two weeks of follow-up in automatic mode. RESULTS: 91 patients were included. Mean TIR achieved with manual mode was 77.3 ± 11.3, increasing to 81.6% ± 7.6 (p < 0.001) after two weeks of auto mode use. A significant reduction in TBR <70 mg/dL (2,7% ± 2,28 vs 1,83% ± 1,67, p < 0,001) and in glycemic variability (% coefficient of variation 32.4 vs 29.7, p < 0.001) was evident, independently of baseline therapy. CONCLUSION: HCL systems allows T1D patients to improve TIR, TBR and glycemic variability independently of previous treatment. Virtual training can be used during situations that limit the access of patients to follow-up centers.","Gómez, Ana M; Henao, Diana; Parra, Darío; Kerguelen, Alfonso; Pinilla, Marisol Vergara; Muñoz, Oscar Mauricio; Rondón, Martin",Diabetes Metab Syndr,200,1

This study aimed to quantitatively investigate the fit of most of the common FFRs used during the COVID-19 pandemic in Iran. Methods: A total of 37 volunteers were fit tested in 20 selected FFRs in a randomized order. The selected FFRs were underwent quantitative fit testing by PortaCount® model 8038. To determine the effects of face sizes on respirator fit, the participants' facial dimensions were measured using a digital caliper. Results: The rate of passing fit tests for the studied FFRs were surprisingly low with 11 out of 20 FFRs having less than 10% passing fit tests and the best performers having only 43% and 27% passing fit tests (brands 2 and 20, respectively). Cup-shaped respirators provided significantly greater fit than the vertical flat-fold ones (p < 0.001). A significantly different FFs were found among the respirator brands (F = 13.60, p < 0.001). Conclusion: Overall, unacceptably low fit factors were obtained from the studied FFRs. The main reasons for this are suspected to single size and style for each studied FFR. It confirms the importance and requirement of the proper respirator selection in that way fitted optimally into facial dimensions, appropriate usage, and properly performing the fit testing procedure. A unique fit test panel should be developed to guide respirator wearers in selecting the appropriate FFR for their specific face sizes.","Fakherpour, Anahita; Jahangiri, Mehdi; Seif, Mozhgan; Charkhand, Hossein; Abbaspour, Siamak; Floyd, Evan L",J Environ Health Sci Eng,200,24

Methods: A convergent mixed-methods study assessed SURPAS's trial implementation, concurrently collecting quantitative and qualitative data, separately analyzing it, and integrating the results. Patients and providers were surveyed and interviewed on their opinion of how SURPAS impacted the preoperative encounter. Relationships between patient risk and patient and provider assessment of SURPAS were examined. Results: A total of 197 patients were provided their SURPAS postoperative risk estimates in nine surgeon's clinics. Of the total patients, 98.8% reported they understood their surgical risks very or quite well after exposure to SURPAS; 92.7% reported SURPAS was very helpful or helpful. Providers shared that 83.4% of the time they reported SURPAS was very or somewhat helpful; 44.7% of the time the providers reported it changed their interaction with the patient and this change was beneficial 94.3% of the time.

The primary measure was change in PaO2 :FiO2 . RESULTS: Forty-four patients, 32 males/12 females, were treated with proning for a total of 138 sessions, with median (range) two (1-8) sessions. Median (IQR) time for the five sessions was 14 (12-17) hours. In the first session, median (IQR) PaO2 :FiO2 increased from 104 (86-122) to 161 (127-207) mm Hg (P < .001). 36/44 patients (82%) improved in PaO2 :FiO2 , with a significant increase in PaO2 :FiO2 in the first three sessions. Median (IQR) FiO2 decreased from 0.7 (0.6-0.8) to 0.5 (0.35-0.6) (<0.001). A significant decrease occurred in the first three sessions. PaO2 , tidal volumes, PEEP, mean arterial pressure (MAP), and norepinephrine infusion did not differ. Primarily, patients with PaO2 :FiO2 approximately < 120 mm Hg before treatment responded to proning. Age, sex, BMI, or SAPS 3 did not predict success in increasing PaO2 :FiO2 . CONCLUSION: Proning increased PaO2 :FiO2 , primarily in patients with PaO2 :FiO2 approximately < 120 mm Hg, with a consistency over three sessions. No characteristic was associated with non-responding, why proning may be considered in most patients. Further study is required to evaluate mortality.","Gleissman, Helena; Forsgren, Anders; Andersson, Elisabeth; Lindqvist, Elin; Lipka Falck, Adam; Cronhjort, Maria; Dahlberg, Martin; Günther, Mattias",Acta anaesthesiol. scand,200,13

To explore the complex dynamics of this novel infection, several mathematical epidemic models have been adopted and simulated using the statistical data of COVID-19 in various regions. In this paper, we present a new nonlinear fractional order model in the Caputo sense to analyze and simulate the dynamics of this viral disease with a case study of Algeria. Initially, after the model formulation, we utilize the well-known least square approach to estimate the model parameters from the reported COVID-19 cases in Algeria for a selected period of time. We perform the existence and uniqueness of the model solution which are proved via the Picard-Lindelöf method. We further compute the basic reproduction numbers and equilibrium points, then we explore the local and global stability of both the disease-free equilibrium point and the endemic equilibrium point. Finally, numerical results and graphical simulation are given to demonstrate the impact of various model parameters and fractional order on the disease dynamics and control.","Hadj Moussa, Yacine El; Boudaoui, Ahmed; Ullah, Saif; Bozkurt, Fatma; Abdeljawad, Thabet; Alqudah, Manar A",Results Phys,200,24

Two-thirds of those surveyed reported some type of distress related to the pandemic (i.e. difficulty coping or negative impact on emotional and mental health). While there were no changes in depressive and anxiety symptoms from prior to COVID-19 to 10 week later in the group as a whole, self-reported distress predicted increases in both anxiety and depression across the two timepoints. Furthermore, adults with higher levels of anxiety prior to the pandemic were more likely to report distress, and women were more likely to report a negative impact of the pandemic on their emotional and mental health. Findings highlight the importance of monitoring with adults with autism spectrum disorder to assess their need for mental health support, and providing ongoing support to those who already experience anxiety even before the pandemic.","Adams, Ryan E; Zheng, Shuting; Taylor, Julie Lounds; Bishop, Somer L",Autism,200,32

However, factors that may confer risks for child routines have seldom been examined, particularly in families where parents and grandparents co-care the children. This study aimed to investigate the associations of parents' and grandparents' depressive symptoms with preschoolers' daily routines in Chinese three-generation families and to determine whether household chaos mediated or moderated the associations. The participants were from 171 urban three-generation families where mothers, fathers, and grandmothers (97 paternal and 74 maternal) were primary caregivers. Mothers, fathers, and grandmothers reported their depressive symptoms at Wave 1; at Wave 2 (during the COVID-19 pandemic), caregivers reported household chaos and child routines. The results revealed that child routines were negatively predicted by parents' joint depressive symptoms rather than grandmothers' depressive symptoms. In the associations, household chaos acted as a mediator rather than a moderator. Specifically, household chaos marginally mediated the associations between parents' and grandmothers' depressive symptoms and child routines only in maternal three-generation families. These findings suggest that in three-generation families, caregivers with more depressive symptoms may elicit more chaotic family environments, which may in turn compromise their children's daily routines.","Jiang, Yongqiang; He, Ting; Lin, Xiuyun; Zhou, Qing; Wu, Qinglu",Curr Psychol,200,11

We describe among short-term and long-term residents at three NHs in Michigan the outbreak identification process, universal testing, point prevalence of COVID-19, and subsequent containment efforts, outcomes, and challenges. DESIGN: Outbreak investigation. SETTING: Three NHs in southeast Michigan. PARTICIPANTS: All residents (N = 215) at three NHs (total beds = 356) affiliated with a large academic healthcare system. METHODS: Upon detection of confirmed cases within the facility, each NH in collaboration and consultation with local hospital, public health officials, and parent corporation implemented immediate facility-wide testing and the following intervention measures: cohorting of COVID-19 positive residents; communication regarding testing and results with residents, healthcare professionals, and families; personal protective equipment reeducation and use throughout facilities; and dedicated staffing for infected patients cohorted in a dedicated COVID-19 wing. We collected patient data regarding demographics, symptoms, comorbidities, hospitalization, and 14-day outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 29 cases of COVID-19 were identified at three participating NHs. Nineteen cases of COVID-19 were identified through symptom-triggered testing from March 23 to April 23, 2020; 10 (4.7%) additional cases were identified through universal testing of 215 residents conducted from April 7 to 15, 2020. The hospitalization rate was 37.9%. The case fatality rate was 20.7% (6/29); these patients had multiple comorbidities. No residents who tested positive through the point-prevalence survey required hospitalization, and five were discharged home within 14 days. CONCLUSION: Proactive and coordinated steps between NH medical directors and administrators, referral hospitals including their laboratories, and local public health officials are necessary to rapidly respond to an outbreak and limit the transmission of COVID-19. This coordinated public health approach may save lives, minimize the burden to the healthcare system, and reduce healthcare costs.","Montoya, Ana; Jenq, Grace; Mills, John P; Beal, Jennifer; Diviney Chun, Erin; Newton, Duane; Gibson, Kristen; Mantey, Julia; Hurst, Kristen; Jones, Karen; Mody, Lona",J. am. geriatr. soc,200,4

BACKGROUND: Following the outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, a drop in blood donation has been observed. It is crucial to determine the actual number of potential SARS-CoV-2-positive donors to define the measures and ensure adequate blood supply. METHODS: The cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 positivity, calculated on the general population, was applied to the donor population by estimating the number of positive subjects. The calculation model was validated by the linear interpolation method. The number of blood units actually discarded based on post-donation information was also taken into account. RESULTS: Three months after the outbreak, 5322 donors were estimated to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 and were therefore potentially excluded from donation. A total of units of blood components were discarded following post donation information. The estimated number of donors deceased (180) and the number of clinically recovered individuals in the same period was also considered. CONCLUSION: This forecasting model can be used to obtain information on blood donors' involvement during future SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks, especially in case of changes concerning epidemiology, incidence by age bracket and geographical distribution and also for new outbreaks of emerging viruses.","Pati, Ilaria; Velati, Claudio; Mengoli, Carlo; Franchini, Massimo; Masiello, Francesca; Marano, Giuseppe; Veropalumbo, Eva; Vaglio, Stefania; Piccinini, Vanessa; Pupella, Simonetta; Liumbruno, Giancarlo M",Transfus Med,200,16

We found that small molecule 2-(1H-indole-3-carbonyl)-thiazole-4-carboxylic acid methyl ester (ITE), an endogenous aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) agonist, can block more than one mode of glioma cell migration, based on cultured cell behavior captured by videos. Data from wound-healing assays and mouse xenograft glioma models corroborated ITE's migration-inhibiting effects while knocking down AHR by siRNA abolished these effects. To identify genes that mediated ITE-AHR's effect, we first collected gene expression changes upon ITE treatment by RNA-seq, then compared them against literature reported migration-related genes in glioma and that were potentially regulated by AHR. MYH9, a component of nonmuscle myosin IIA (NMIIA), was confirmed to be reduced by ITE treatment. When MYH9 was overexpressed in the glioma cells, a good correlation was observed between the expression level and the cell migration ability, determined by wound-healing assay. Correspondingly, overexpression of MYH9 abrogated ITE's migration-inhibiting effects, indicating that ITE-AHR inhibited cell migration via inhibiting MYH9 expression. MYH9 is essential for cell migration in 3D confined space and not a discovered target of AHR; the fact that ITE affects MYH9 via AHR opens a new research and development avenue.","Zhao, Lijiao; Shu, Qiuting; Sun, Hui; Ma, Yunlong; Kang, Dandan; Zhao, Yating; Lu, Jing; Gong, Pei; Yang, Fan; Wan, Fang",Biomed Res Int,200,1

METHODS: Extracted data on patient characteristics, acute illness severity, organ support and outcomes from the Case Mix Programme, the national clinical audit for adult critical care, for a prospective cohort of patients with COVID-19 (February to August 2020) are compared with a recent retrospective cohort of patients with other viral pneumonias (non-COVID-19) (2017-2019) and with other international cohorts of critical care patients with COVID-19, the latter identified from published reports. RESULTS: 10,834 patients with COVID-19 (70.1% male, median age 60 years, 32.6% non-white ethnicity, 39.4% obese, 8.2% at least one serious comorbidity) were admitted across 289 critical care units. Of these, 36.9% had a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of &#8804; 13.3 kPa (&#8804; 100 mmHg) consistent with severe ARDS and 72% received invasive ventilation.

Meaningful international comparisons were limited due to lack of standardised reporting. CONCLUSION: Critical care patients with COVID-19 were disproportionately non-white, from more deprived areas and more likely to be male and obese. Conventional severity scoring appeared not to adequately reflect their acute severity, with the distribution across PaO2/FiO2 ratio categories indicating acutely severe respiratory disease. Critical care patients with COVID-19 experience high mortality and place a great burden on critical care services.","Richards-Belle, Alvin; Orzechowska, Izabella; Gould, Doug W; Thomas, Karen; Doidge, James C; Mouncey, Paul R; Christian, Michael D; Shankar-Hari, Manu; Harrison, David A; Rowan, Kathryn M",Intensive Care Med,200,20

Immune response and excessive inflammation in COVID-19 may also accelerate the progression of brain inflammatory neurodegeneration, and elderly individuals are more susceptible to severe outcomes after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D) are at an increased risk for AD as well as severe outcomes after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Genetic and socioeconomic factors influencing the rates of T2D, AD, and COVID-19 severity may create an exceptionally high-risk profile for certain demographics such as African Americans and Hispanic Americans. Type I interferon response plays an important role in both host response to viral infection, as well as AD pathology and may be a sensible therapeutic target in both AD and COVID-19.","Naughton, Sean X; Raval, Urdhva; Pasinetti, Giulio M",J Alzheimers Dis,200,16

The microenvironmental niche, which includes the extracellular matrix (ECM), substantially influences cell phenotype. ECM harvested from normal porcine esophageal mucosa (eECM) was formulated as a mucoadhesive hydrogel, and shown to largely retain basement membrane and matrix-cell adhesion proteins. Dogs with BE were treated orally with eECM hydrogel and omeprazole (n = 6) or omeprazole alone (n = 2) for 30 days. eECM treatment resolved esophagitis, reverted metaplasia to a normal, squamous epithelium in four of six animals, and downregulated the pro-inflammatory tumor necrosis factor-&#945;+ cell infiltrate compared to control animals. The metaplastic tissue in control animals (n = 2) did not regress. The results suggest that in vivo alteration of the microenvironment with a site-appropriate, mucoadhesive ECM hydrogel can mitigate the inflammatory and metaplastic response in a dog model of BE.","Naranjo, Juan Diego; Saldin, Lindsey T; Sobieski, Eric; Quijano, Lina M; Hill, Ryan C; Chan, Patrick G; Torres, Crisanto; Dziki, Jenna L; Cramer, Madeline C; Lee, Yoojin C; Das, Rohit; Bajwa, Anant K; Nossair, Rania; Klimak, Molly; Marchal, Lucile; Patel, Shil; Velankar, Sachin S; Hansen, Kirk C; McGrath, Kevin; Badylak, Stephen F",Sci.

It enters by binding with ACE2 receptor present on the outer surface of a cell by cleaving S1/S2 with proteolytic protein Furin. Further viral replication or transcription then takes place with the help of main protease 3CLpro and polymerase RdRp. This in silco study was carried out to block ACE2, Furin, 3CLpro and RdRP with various phytochemicals to prevent SARS- CoV-2 entry and replication or transcription. Twenty different phytochemicals were screened to understand the drug-likeliness obeying Lipinski's rule 5 and further, molecular docking was performed using these phytochemicals to block their respective target proteins. All the phytochemicals follow Lipinski's rule of five and molecular docking result shows best binding affinity of Podofilox - 7.54 kcal/mol with ACE2, Psoralidin - 8.04 kcal/mol with Furin, Ursolic acid - 8.88 kcal/mol with 3CLpro and Epiafzelechin - 8.26 kcal/mol with RdRp. Thus, blocking two human receptors ACE2 and Furin with Podofilox and Psoralidin respectively may prevent the viral entry into the cells. Also blocking viral proteins 3CLpro and RdRp with Ursolic acid and Epiafzelechin may prevent viral replication or transcription. Using this combination therapy of blocking the receptors responsible for viral entry and viral proteins responsible for replication or transcription may prevent SARS- CoV-2 infection.","Dey, Dipjyoti; Dey, Nirban; Ghosh, Shalini; Chandrasekaran, Natrajan; Mukherjee, Amitava; Thomas, John",Virusdisease,200,26

METHOD: We utilized search terms relating to facemasks, infection, and community settings on PubMed, the Cochrane Library Database, and Google Scholar. A meta-analysis was conducted utilizing a random-effects model. RESULTS: The review included 12 primary studies on the effectiveness of medical facemask use to prevent influenza, influenza-like illness, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Our meta-analysis demonstrates that facemask use significantly reduces the risk of transmitting these respiratory infections (pooled OR = 0.66, 95% confidence interval: 0.54-0.81). Of the 12 studies, ten clinical trials suggest that respiratory infection incidence is lower with high medical facemask compliance, early use, and use in combination with intensive hand hygiene. One cohort study conducted during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, demonstrated facemasks are effective in reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission when used before those infected develop symptoms. One case-control study reported that controls used medical facemasks more often than cases infected with SARS-CoV (p-value<0.05). No primary study on cloth facemask effectiveness to prevent respiratory infection transmission was found. CONCLUSION: Based on the available evidence, we recommend medical facemask use by healthy and sick individuals for preventing respiratory infection transmission in community settings. Medical facemask effectiveness is dependent on compliance and utilization in combination with preventive measures such as intensive hand hygiene. Currently, no direct evidence is available in humans supporting the recommendation of cloth facemask use to prevent respiratory infection transmission.","Chaabna, Karima; Doraiswamy, Sathyanarayanan; Mamtani, Ravinder; Cheema, Sohaila",Int. j. infect. dis,200,32

As shown, ACE2 has medium levels of expression in both small airway epithelium and masticatory mucosa, and high levels of expression in nasal epithelium. The expression of ACE2 is low in mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells and cannot be detected in alveolar macrophages. TMPRSS2 is highly expressed in small airway epithelium and nasal epithelium and has lower expression in masticatory mucosa. Our results provide the molecular basis that the nasal mucosa is the most susceptible locus in the respiratory tract for SARS-CoV-2 infection and consequently for subsequent droplet transmission and should be the focus for protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Liu, Yichuan; Qu, Hui-Qi; Qu, Jingchun; Tian, Lifeng; Hakonarson, Hakon",Viruses,200,16

An analysis of the clinical characteristics, drug therapies and principal outcome predictors in the COVID-19 hospitalized patients from 1 March to 31 May 2020 is presented through a population-based registry study. Hospital stay variables, ventilation mode data and clinical outcomes were observed. In Castile and Leon hospitals, 7307 COVID-19 patients were admitted, with 57.05% being male and a median of 76 years. The mortality rate was 24.43%, with a high incidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (14.03%) and acute kidney injury (AKI) (10.87%). The most used medicines were antibiotics (90.83%), antimalarials (42.63%), steroids (44.37%) and antivirals, such as lopinavir/ritonavir (42.63%). The use of tocilizumab (9.37%) and anti-SIRS (systemic inflammatory response syndrome) medicines (7.34%) were remarkable. Fundamentally, death occurred more likely over 65 years of age (OR: 9.05). In addition, the need for ventilation was associated with a higher probability of death (OR: 3.59), SARS (OR: 5.14) and AKI (OR: 2.31). The drug-use pattern had been modified throughout the COVID-19 first wave.

Identification of patients at increased risk of adverse outcome would be important, to allow closer observation and earlier medical intervention for those at risk, and to objectively guide prognosis for friends and family of affected individuals. We conducted a single-centre retrospective cohort study in all-comers with COVID-19 admitted to a large general hospital in the United Kingdom. Clinical characteristics and features on admission, including observations, haematological and biochemical characteristics, were used to develop a score to predict 30-day mortality, using multivariable logistic regression. We identified 316 patients, of whom 46% died within 30-days. We developed a mortality score incorporating age, sex, platelet count, international normalised ratio, and observations on admission including the Glasgow Coma Scale, respiratory rate and blood pressure. The score was highly predictive of 30-day mortality with an area under the receiver operating curve of 0.7933 (95% CI 0.745-0.841). The optimal cut-point was a score &#8805; 4, which had a sensitivity of 78.36% and a specificity of 67.59%. Patients with a score &#8805; 4 had an odds ratio of 7.6 for 30-day mortality compared to those with a score < 4 (95% CI 4.56-12.49, p < 0.001). This simple, easy-to-use risk score calculator for patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 is a strong predictor of 30-day mortality. Whilst requiring further external validation, it has the potential to guide prognosis for family and friends, and to identify patients at increased risk, who may require closer observation and more intensive early intervention.","Gue, Ying X; Tennyson, Maria; Gao, Jovia; Ren, Shuhui; Kanji, Rahim; Gorog, Diana A",Sci Rep,200,28

However, the evidence that diabetes increases the risk of infection, effect of diabetes on outcomes and characteristics of patients at risk is not clear. OBJECTIVES: To explore the prevalence of diabetes in COVID-19 pandemic, effect of diabetes on clinical outcomes and to characterise the patients with diabetes affected by COVID-19. METHODS: A literature review of articles published in English language and reported outcomes on prevalence and effect of diabetes on outcomes and patients' characteristics. RESULTS: The prevalence of diabetes in COVID-19 patients appears similar to that in the general population. The evidence of diabetes increasing the risk of severe infection and adverse outcomes is substantial. The progression of the disease into acute respiratory distress syndrome, the requirement for intensive care admission or mechanical ventilation and mortality all have been increased by the presence of diabetes. Patients with diabetes at risk of COVID-19 appear to be obese, of older age, have uncontrolled glycaemia and have coexisting comorbidities especially cardiovascular disease and hypertension. Tight glycaemic control on admission to hospital using insulin infusion has shown some beneficial effects; however, the role of hypoglycaemic medications in the management of these patients is not yet clear. CONCLUSION: High risk group should be identified and prioritised in future vaccination programmes. Future research is required to optimise management of patients with diabetes and develop new ways to manage them via technological developments such as telecare.","Abdelhafiz, Ahmed H; Emmerton, Demelza; Sinclair, Alan J",Int J Clin Pract,200,13

Based on the unique affinity between dermatan sulfate and autoantigens, we identified 348 proteins from human lung A549 cells, of which 198 are known targets of autoantibodies. Comparison with current COVID data identified 291 proteins that are altered at protein or transcript level in SARS-CoV-2 infection, with 191 being known autoantigens. These known and putative autoantigens are significantly associated with viral replication and trafficking processes, including gene expression, ribonucleoprotein biogenesis, mRNA metabolism, translation, vesicle and vesicle-mediated transport, and apoptosis. They are also associated with cytoskeleton, platelet degranulation, IL-12 signaling, and smooth muscle contraction. Host proteins that interact with and that are perturbed by viral proteins are a major source of autoantigens. Orf3 induces the largest number of protein alterations, Orf9 affects the mitochondrial ribosome, and they and E, M, N, and Nsp proteins affect protein localization to membrane, immune responses, and apoptosis. Phosphorylation and ubiquitination alterations by viral infection define major molecular changes in autoantigen origination. This study provides a large list of autoantigens as well as new targets for future investigation, e.g., UBA1, UCHL1, USP7, CDK11A, PRKDC, PLD3, PSAT1, RAB1A, SLC2A1, platelet activating factor acetylhydrolase, and mitochondrial ribosomal proteins. This study illustrates how viral infection can modify host cellular proteins extensively, yield diverse autoantigens, and trigger a myriad of autoimmune sequelae.

This article presents a possible scenario for how technology, in the near future, will completely up-end primary care practice. What does face-to-face interaction accomplish that cannot be done remotely? What do family physicians offer that cannot be accomplished by technology? More than just relationship, family medicine brings the therapeutic use of the self to engage with people, an ability to advocate for patients, and the ability to step back and reflect on the power of relationships. In addition, family physicians bring wisdom, making decisions in the liminal state between patient and physician, the resulting product of the human connection but also the ability to manage complexity using the best evidence. The ability to do both gives family medicine physician the skills to leverage but also control the coming big data.","Shaughnessy, Allen F; Slawson, David C; Duggan, Ashley P",J Am Board Fam Med,200,14

Methods: From January 21 to March 3, 2020, a total of 136 patients with COVID-19 were admitted to our hospital. According to inclusion and exclusion criteria, 52 patients who recovered from COVID-19 were included in this study, including 33 moderate cases and 19 severe cases. Three senior radiologists independently and retrospectively analyzed the chest CT imaging data of 52 patients at the last time of admission and the first follow-up after discharge, including primary manifestations, concomitant manifestations, and degree of residual lesion dissipation. Results: At the first follow-up after discharge, 16 patients with COVID-19 recovered to normal chest CT appearance, while 36 patients still had residual pulmonary lesions, mainly including 33 cases of ground-glass opacity, 5 cases of consolidation, and 19 cases of fibrous strip shadow. The proportion of residual pulmonary lesions in severe cases (17/19) was statistically higher than in moderate cases (19/33) (&#967; 2 = 5.759, P < 0.05). At the first follow-up, residual pulmonary lesions were dissipated to varying degrees in 47 cases, and lesions remained unchanged in 5 cases. There were no cases of increased numbers of lesions, enlargement of lesions, or appearance of new lesions. The dissipation of residual pulmonary lesions in moderate patients was statistically better than in severe patients (Z = -2.538, P < 0.05). Conclusion: Clinically cured patients with COVID-19 had faster dissipation of residual pulmonary lesions after discharge, while moderate patients had better dissipation than severe patients. However, at the first follow-up, most patients still had residual pulmonary lesions, which were primarily ground-glass opacity and fibrous strip shadow. The proportion of residual pulmonary lesions was higher in severe cases of COVID-19, which required further follow-up.","Zhong, Lingshan; Zhang, Shuo; Wang, Jigang; Zhao, Xinqian; Wang, Kai; Ding, Wenlong; Xing, Zhiheng; Shen, Jun",Can Respir J,200,32

Despite the consensus about the SARS-CoV-2 origin from bat CoV RaTG13, discrepancy to host tropism to other human Coronaviruses exist. SARS-CoV-2 also possesses some differences in its S protein receptor-binding domain, glycan-binding N-terminal domain and the surface of the sialic acid-binding domain. Despite similarities based on cryo-EM and biochemical studies, the SARS-CoV-2 shows higher stability and binding affinity to the ACE2 receptor. The SARS-CoV-2 does not appear to present a mutational ""hot spot"" as only the D614G mutation has been identified from clinical isolates. As laboratory manipulation is highly unlikely for the origin of SARS-CoV-2, the current possibilities comprise either natural selection in animal host before zoonotic transfer or natural selection in humans following zoonotic transfer. In the former case, despite SARS-CoV-2 and bat RaTG13 showing 96% identity some pangolin Coronaviruses exhibit very high similarity to particularly the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2. In the latter case, it can be hypothesized that the SARS-CoV-2 genome has adapted during human-to-human transmission and based on available data, the isolated SARS-CoV-2 genomes derive from a common origin.

The aim of the current study is to validate a Turkish version of the Pandemic Grief Scale (PGS), which is a brief English-language mental health screener to identify probable cases of dysfunctional grief associated with a COVID-19 death. Participants were assessed using the PGS, Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4) and Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS). We surveyed 758 Turkish native speakers who participated online. Confirmatory factor analysis showed that the factor structure of the PGS was satisfactory. The scale was internally consistent with a Cronbach's alpha of 0.77 and a composite reliability of 0.90. The PGS demonstrated construct validity with strong correlations with suicidal ideation and substance use coping. Positive correlations of the PGS with the PHQ-4 and the WSAS demonstrated adequate convergent validity. The PGS discriminates well between persons with and without dysfunctional grief using an optimized cut score of &#8805; 3 (89% sensitivity and 72% specificity). The PGS also demonstrates incremental validity by explaining most of the variance (43%) in functional impairment due to a COVID-19 loss beyond measures of depression and generalized anxiety. These findings closely replicate the original validation study on the PGS in English and suggest that the current Turkish version of the PGS is a valid and reliable measure to assess the severity of dysfunctional grief associated with a COVID-19 death.","Evren, Cuneyt; Evren, Bilge; Dalbudak, Ercan; Topcu, Merve; Kutlu, Nilay",Death Stud,200,24

STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Citation bias was investigated by assessing the degree of agreement between evidence provided by a remdesivir randomized controlled trial and its citing articles. The dissimilarity of outcomes derived from nonrandomized and randomized studies was tested by a meta-analysis of hydroxychloroquine effects on mortality. The differential influence of studies with beneficial over those with neutral results was evaluated by a bibliometric analysis. RESULTS: The articles citing the ACTT-1 remdesivir trial preferentially presented its positive outcomes in 55.83% and its negative outcomes in 6.43% of cases. The hydroxychloroquine indicated no significant effect by randomized studies, but a significant survival benefit by nonrandomized ones. Citation mapping revealed that the study reporting survival benefit from the hydroxychloroquine-azithromycin combination was the most influential, despite subsequent studies reporting potential harmful effects. CONCLUSION: The present study raises concerns about citation bias and a predilection of reporting beneficial over harmful effects in the Covid-19 treatment research, potentially in the context of white hat bias.

These technologies are well embedded in the areas of global finance, health care and defence, to name a few. This review focuses on the relevance of blockchain technology to health care. Blockchain technology will be the unifying platform for sharing patient data currently inaccessible due to the siloed architecture of legacy software systems, and as a result potentially be the basis for precision or individualized patient treatment. It will also strengthen digital security of sensitive patient data that is presently a lucrative target for cyber criminals. In the current COVID-19 environment, clinicians will rely more on telehealth to reduce person-to-person contact. This service can be delivered by the clinical team with confidence in the veracity of the patient data made accessible through the blockchain platform. Smart contracts written on the blockchain platform will reduce the possibility of international humanitarian aid to low- and middle-income countries being misspent. The pharmaceutical supply chain industry is adopting blockchain technology to ensure supply chain provenance. Similarly, the health insurance industry recognizes how the blockchain ecosystem can improve services to its members and expedite reimbursements to clinicians.","Tan, Lorwai; Tivey, David; Kopunic, Helena; Babidge, Wendy; Langley, Sally; Maddern, Guy",ANZ j.

We quantified changes in chemosensory abilities during the course of the respiratory illness using 0-100 visual analog scales (VAS) for participants reporting a positive (C19+; n=4148) or negative (C19-; n=546) COVID-19 laboratory test outcome. Logistic regression models identified univariate and multivariate predictors of COVID-19 status and post-COVID-19 olfactory recovery. Both C19+ and C19- groups exhibited smell loss, but it was significantly larger in C19+ participants (mean±SD, C19+: -82.5±27.2 points; C19-: -59.8±37.7). Smell loss during illness was the best predictor of COVID-19 in both univariate and multivariate models (ROC AUC=0.72). Additional variables provide negligible model improvement. VAS ratings of smell loss were more predictive than binary chemosensory yes/no-questions or other cardinal symptoms (e.g., fever). Olfactory recovery within 40 days of respiratory symptom onset was reported for ~50% of participants and was best predicted by time since respiratory symptom onset. We find that quantified smell loss is the best predictor of COVID-19 amongst those with symptoms of respiratory illness. To aid clinicians and contact tracers in identifying individuals with a high likelihood of having COVID-19, we propose a novel 0-10 scale to screen for recent olfactory loss, the ODoR-19. We find that numeric ratings &#8804;2 indicate high odds of symptomatic COVID-19 (4<OR<10). Once independently validated, this tool could be deployed when viral lab tests are impractical or unavailable.","Gerkin, Richard C; Ohla, Kathrin; Veldhuizen, Maria G; Joseph, Paule V; Kelly, Christine E; Bakke, Alyssa J; Steele, Kimberley E; Farruggia, Michael C; Pellegrino, Robert; Pepino, Marta Y; Bouysset, Cédric; Soler, Graciela M; Pereda-Loth, Veronica; Dibattista, Michele; Cooper, Keiland W; Croijmans, Ilja; Di Pizio, Antonella; Ozdener, M Hakan; Fjaeldstad, Alexander W; Lin, Cailu; Sandell, Mari A; Singh, Preet B; Brindha, V Evelyn; Olsson, Shannon B; Saraiva, Luis R; Ahuja, Gaurav; Alwashahi, Mohammed K; Bhutani, Surabhi; D039,; Errico, Anna; Fornazieri, Marco A; Golebiowski, Jérôme; Hwang, Liang-Dar; Öztürk, Lina; Roura, Eugeni; Spinelli, Sara; Whitcroft, Katherine L; Faraji, Farhoud; Fischmeister, Florian PhS; Heinbockel, Thomas; Hsieh, Julien W; Huart, Caroline; Konstantinidis, Iordanis; Menini, Anna; Morini, Gabriella; Olofsson, Jonas K; Philpott, Carl M; Pierron, Denis; Shields, Vonnie D C; Voznessenskaya, Vera V; Albayay, Javier",Chem. senses,200,16

In case of associated LV dysfunction, rapidly evolving heart failure may follow, and urgent surgery becomes life-saving. Case summary: Following an acute anterior MI treated by percutaneous coronary intervention, which resulted in apical hypokinesis, depressed LV function, and moderate mitral regurgitation, a 70-year-old male patient kept in contact with our cardiology department through phone calls. Over 6 weeks, the patient's conditions worsened. For fear of contracting COVID-19, he refused to attend to the Emergency Room. Conditions did not improve despite medical therapy adjustments, and he was admitted to hospital following a syncope. Computed tomography scan revealed pneumonia, and he was placed in a 'grey' ward while waiting for nose-swab results for COVID-19. A rapid escalation of treatment was necessary as conditions did not improve with low-dose inotropes, and he required invasive ventilation. An Impella 5.0 was implanted as support prior to surgery, was maintained during the procedure and as a means of weaning off extracorporeal circulation. Surgery was successful and Impella 5.0 was removed on postoperative Day 5. Discussion: To date, Impella use in cardiothoracic surgery has been described in case of ventricular septal rupture or as a bridge to permanent LV assist device. In our case, Impella 5.0 was implanted, used as a bridge to surgery, and as postoperative support in a patient with evolving cardiogenic shock due to LV aneurysm and depressed LV ejection fraction following acute MI, in the difficult setting of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Briani, M.; Torracca, L.; Crescenzi, G.; Barbone, A.",European Heart Journal - Case Reports,200,16

While numerous studies have reported increased amygdala activity following traumatic stress exposure and in PTSD, the findings regarding amygdala volume have been mixed. One reason for these mixed findings may be that the amygdala has been considered as a homogenous entity, while it in fact consists of several nuclei with unique cellular and connectivity profiles. Here, we investigated amygdala nuclei volumes of the basolateral and the centrocorticomedial complex in relation to PTSD symptom severity in 47 young survivors from the 2011 Norwegian terror attack 24-36 months post-trauma. PTSD symptoms were assessed 4-5, 14-15 and 24-36 months following the trauma. We found that increased PTSD symptom severity 24-36 months post-trauma was associated with volumetric reductions of all basolateral as well as the central and the medial nuclei. However, only the lateral nucleus was associated with longitudinal symptom development, and mediated the association between 4-5 months and 24-36 months post-trauma symptoms. The results suggest that the amygdala nuclei may be differentially associated with cross-sectional and longitudinal measures of PTSD symptom severity. As such, investigations of amygdala total volume may not provide an adequate index of the association between amygdala and stress-related mental illness.","Ousdal, Olga Therese; Milde, Anne Marita; Hafstad, Gertrud Sofie; Hodneland, Erlend; Dyb, Grete; Craven, Alexander R; Melinder, Annika; Endestad, Tor; Hugdahl, Kenneth",Transl Psychiatry,200,16

This study drew on two nationally representative samples to compare the prevalence rate of anxiety in the U.S. before and during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The Generalized Anxiety Disorder-2 (GAD-2) screening tool was used to detect the proportion of US adults screening positive for high levels of anxiety symptoms. Anxiety symptoms was assessed in 2019 using the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS; N = 30,915) and during the pandemic using biweekly surveys collected as part of the Understanding America Study (UAS; N=8,022 Obs.=121,768) between March and December 2020. RESULTS: The proportion of participants with high levels of anxiety symptoms increased significantly from 8.1% (95% CI[7.7, 8.5]) in 2019 to 21.4% (95% CI[19.9, 22.9]) at the beginning of April, 2020. The prevalence then declined to 11.4% (95% CI[10.3, 12.5]) in May and remained 3% above 2019 levels until December 2020. This pattern of increasing anxiety between 2019 and April 2020 followed by a rapid decrease in anxiety was identified across all demographic characteristics examined. LIMITATIONS: The NHIS and UAS samples differ in their sampling and mode of administration which may bias comparisons between samples. CONCLUSIONS: Anxiety symptoms increased markedly during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and reduced quickly as stay-at-home orders were lifted. These findings highlight the importance of providing mental health supports during future lockdowns and suggest that resilience in mental health may have been a key population-level response to the demands of the pandemic.","Daly, Michael; Robinson, Eric",J Affect Disord,200,20

METHODS: A case-control study in which 701 confirmed COVID-19 patients (of which 41 were intensive care unit [ICU]-admitted) and 250 control subjects were enrolled. The study was conducted retrospectively in October on patients admitted to 3 separate hospitals in Saudi Arabia namely: King Abdullah Bin Abdulaziz University Hospital (Riyadh), Ohud Hospital (Madinah), and Nojood Medical Center (Madinah) between May and September 2020. Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio was calculated based on absolute neutrophil and lymphocyte count. Institutional ethical approval was obtained prior to the study. RESULTS: Patients (median age 35 years), of which 54.8% were females, were younger than the control cohort (median age 48 years). Patients had significantly higher NLR compared to the control group. Intensive care unit admitted patients had significantly higher platelet, WBC and neutrophil counts. The ICU patients' NLR was almost twice as of the non-intensive patients. The NLR value of 5.5 was found to be of high specificity (96.4%) and positive predictive value (91.4%) in diagnosing COVID-19. Furthermore, it had a very good sensitivity (86.4%) in predicting severe forms of disease, such as, ICU admission. CONCLUSION: Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio is an important tool in determining the COVID-19 clinical status. This study further confirms the prognostic value of NLR in detecting severe infection, and those patients with high NLR should be closely monitored and managed.","Sayed, Anwar A; Allam, Assem A; Sayed, Ayman I; Alraey, Mohammed A; Joseph, Mercy V",Saudi Med J,200,1

This study estimated the total number of adult elective operations that would be cancelled worldwide during the 12 weeks of peak disruption due to COVID-19. METHODS: A global expert response study was conducted to elicit projections for the proportion of elective surgery that would be cancelled or postponed during the 12 weeks of peak disruption. A Bayesian ß-regression model was used to estimate 12-week cancellation rates for 190 countries. Elective surgical case-mix data, stratified by specialty and indication (surgery for cancer versus benign disease), were determined. This case mix was applied to country-level surgical volumes. The 12-week cancellation rates were then applied to these figures to calculate the total number of cancelled operations. RESULTS: The best estimate was that 28 404 603 operations would be cancelled or postponed during the peak 12 weeks of disruption due to COVID-19 (2 367 050 operations per week). Most would be operations for benign disease (90·2 per cent, 25 638 922 of 28 404 603). The overall 12-week cancellation rate would be 72·3 per cent. Globally, 81·7 per cent of operations for benign conditions (25 638 922 of 31 378 062), 37·7 per cent of cancer operations (2 324 070 of 6 162 311) and 25·4 per cent of elective caesarean sections (441 611 of 1 735 483) would be cancelled or postponed. If countries increased their normal surgical volume by 20 per cent after the pandemic, it would take a median of 45 weeks to clear the backlog of operations resulting from COVID-19 disruption. CONCLUSION: A very large number of operations will be cancelled or postponed owing to disruption caused by COVID-19. Governments should mitigate against this major burden on patients by developing recovery plans and implementing strategies to restore surgical activity safely.",,Br J Surg,200,16

Being a potent oxidant, ozone is lethal against most bacteria and viruses found in water, or on surfaces and aerosols. Ozone has also been successfully used to treat several viral diseases such as Ebola and HIV Hepatitis B and C. Using molecular modeling, this study evaluated the reactivity of ozone toward representative key molecules in the structure of SARS-CoV-2. The results show that ozone is able to attack the proteins and lipids of the virus’s spikes and envelope, particularly the amino acids tryptophan, methionine and cysteine, and the fatty acids, arachidonic acid, linoleic acid, and oleic acid. Ozone also attacks the N-glycopeptides of the spike protein subunits 1 and 2, though at lower reactivity. Disruption of the structure of SARS-CoV-2 could inactivate the virus, suggesting that ozone could be an effective oxidant against COVID-19 virus. If incorrectly applied, ozone is toxic and contact with the respiratory tract must be avoided.","Tizaoui, Chedly",Ozone Sci. Eng.,200,16

Nsp1 is a 180 amino acid long protein with a primarily flexible structure that allows nsp1 to interact with various cellular factors during host shutoff to inhibit translation and promote mRNA decay. Hypothesis/Goal of Study Mutations of the surface residues of nsp1 either attenuate or augment its host shutoff function prompting the hypothesis that these residues bind cellular proteins that facilitate nsp1 during the host shutoff. To identify cellular proteins that interact with nsp1 and assist its function, we isolated host proteins proximal to nsp1 in human epithelial kidney cells by using a fusion protein, nsp1-BioID2. These isolated proteins are identified using mass spectroscopy and verified by western blot. Also, we are using computer-based modeling to predict the binding sites of these nsp1-interacting proteins. Methods and Results By comparing protein complexes, we identified a large group of proteins including ribosomal proteins that are likely involved in host shutoff. In addition to the ribosomal proteins, factors implicated in the stress granule formation and RNA processing are identified and verified. We have tested these interactions in multiple mutants that are known to affect the host shutoff activity of nsp1. Surprisingly, none of the mutations in the structured region of nsp1 disrupts any of these mutations. Conclusions BioID-mediated tagging of the host proteins proximal to nsp1 allows us to identify multiple pathways modulated by nsp1.","Gerassimovich, Yevgeniy Nag Anita",The FASEB Journal,200,33

497228,497228,497228,Decoding Covid-19 with the SARS-CoV-2 Genome,12.945081,9.466881,2021,"BACKGROUND Autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) is a rare, steroid-responsive disease of the pancreas. Concurrent treatment with immunosuppressants, including corticosteroids, increases the risk of developing a severe form of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) due to infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The World Health Organization (WHO) advises against the use of corticosteroids in patients with SARS-CoV-2 due to their poor outcomes in patients with SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), unless these patients require steroid treatment for a coexisting disease. CASE REPORT A 53-year old patient was admitted with symptoms and diagnostic findings consistent with AIP. Thorough etiological workup revealed an elevated IgG4 level of 361 mg/dL and significant clinical response to corticosteroid treatment, leading to a diagnosis of AIP. After finishing steroid treatment at home, the patient was readmitted with another episode of AIP complicated by development of acute necrotic collection and COVID-19 while taking a second course of high dose prednisone. The patient was continued on high dose prednisone, started on azathioprine and intravenous meropenem, and underwent CT guided percutaneous drainage. He also received supportive care for COVID-19. After significant clinical improvement, the patient was discharged to quarantine at home, which he completed uneventfully. CONCLUSIONS Despite the use of corticosteroids due to AIP, this high risk patient recovered from COVID-19 without complications. These findings support the use of corticosteroids when necessary for treatment of coexisting conditions in COVID-19 patients.","Liaquat, Hammad; Shupp, Brittney; Kapoor, Sarina; Matin, Ayaz",Am J Case Rep,200,24

Chest CT scans performed at hospital presentation by consecutive COVID-19 patients (02/27/2020-03/13/2020) were retrospectively reviewed to obtain pectoralis muscle density and total, visceral, and intermuscular adipose tissue areas (TAT, VAT, IMAT) at the level of T7-T8 vertebrae. Primary outcomes were: hospitalization, mechanical ventilation (MV) and/or death, death alone. Secondary outcomes were: C-reactive protein (CRP), oxygen saturation (SO2), CT disease extension at hospital presentation. The mediation of body composition in the effect of age on death was explored. Of the 318 patients included in the study (median age 65.7 years, females 37.7%), 205 (64.5%) were hospitalized, 68 (21.4%) needed MV, and 58 (18.2%) died. Increased muscle density was a protective factor while increased TAT, VAT, and IMAT were risk factors for hospitalization and MV/death. All these parameters except TAT had borderline effects on death alone. All parameters were associated with SO2 and extension of lung parenchymal involvement at CT; VAT was associated with CRP. Approximately 3% of the effect of age on death was mediated by decreased muscle density. In conclusion, low muscle quality and ectopic fat accumulation were associated with COVID-19 outcomes, VAT was associated with baseline inflammation. Low muscle quality partly mediated the effect of age on mortality.","Besutti, Giulia; Pellegrini, Massimo; Ottone, Marta; Cantini, Michele; Milic, Jovana; Bonelli, Efrem; Dolci, Giovanni; Cassone, Giulia; Ligabue, Guido; Spaggiari, Lucia; Pattacini, Pierpaolo; Fasano, Tommaso; Canovi, Simone; Massari, Marco; Salvarani, Carlo; Guaraldi, Giovanni; Rossi, Paolo Giorgi",PLoS One,200,20

We develop a custom architecture to analyze the data from two interferometers. We compare the obtained performance to that obtained with other autoencoder architectures and with a convolutional classifier. The unsupervised nature of the proposed strategy comes with a cost in terms of accuracy, when compared to more traditional supervised techniques. On the other hand, there is a qualitative gain in generalizing the experimental sensitivity beyond the ensemble of pre-computed signal templates. The recurrent autoencoder outperforms other autoencoders based on different architectures. The class of recurrent autoencoders presented in this paper could complement the search strategy employed for gravitational wave detection and extend the reach of the ongoing detection campaigns.","Moreno, Eric A.; Vlimant, Jean-Roch; Spiropulu, Maria; Borzyszkowski, Bartlomiej; Pierini, Maurizio",,200,25

Currently, it emerges as a rapid avenue to alleviate the COVID-19 pandemic disease. (2) Methods: Herein, we tested the antiviral activity of anti-microbial and anti-inflammatory Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs, commonly prescribed to relieve respiratory symptoms, against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the viral causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic. (3) Results: Of these FDA-approved antimicrobial drugs, Azithromycin, Niclosamide, and Nitazoxanide showed a promising ability to hinder the replication of a SARS-CoV-2 isolate, with IC50 of 0.32, 0.16, and 1.29 µM, respectively. We provided evidence that several antihistamine and anti-inflammatory drugs could partially reduce SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro. Furthermore, this study showed that Azithromycin can selectively impair SARS-CoV-2 replication, but not the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV). A virtual screening study illustrated that Azithromycin, Niclosamide, and Nitazoxanide bind to the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 (Protein data bank (PDB) ID: 6lu7) in binding mode similar to the reported co-crystalized ligand. Also, Niclosamide displayed hydrogen bond (HB) interaction with the key peptide moiety GLN: 493A of the spike glycoprotein active site.

To identify how the initial filling of the gaseous vesicle is compromised, and to determine the implications of this condition on juvenile growth, we analysed the histology of the swim bladder of both normal swimming fish and belly-sliders during their initial growth phase (first month of life). In addition to slower growth rate compared with fish swimming normally, we found that belly-sliders have metaplasia characterized by epithelium peeling of the swim bladder and the presence of haemorrhage. Based on our findings, it can be concluded that metaplasia of the swim bladder is recurrent in annual fish bred in the laboratory, which explains the large number of unviable larvae.

In this study focusing on IgG antibodies, we compare reliability of three chemiluminescent (CLIA) and two enzyme linked immunosorbent (ELISA) assays. METHODS: Sera from a total of 271 subjects, including 64 reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) confirmed SARS-CoV-2 patients were tested for specific Ab using Maglumi (Snibe), Liaison (Diasorin), iFlash (Yhlo), Euroimmun (Medizinische Labordiagnostika AG) and Wantai (Wantai Biological Pharmacy) assays. Diagnostic sensitivity and specificity, positive and negative likelihood ratios were evaluated using manufacturers' and optimized thresholds. RESULTS: Optimized thresholds (Maglumi 2 kAU/L, Liaison 6.2 kAU/L and iFlash 15.0 kAU/L) allowed us to achieve a negative likelihood ratio and an accuracy of: 0.06 and 93.5% for Maglumi; 0.03 and 93.1% for Liaison; 0.03 and 91% for iFlash. Diagnostic sensitivities and specificities were above 93.8% and 85.9%, respectively for all CLIA assays. Overall agreement was 90.3% (Cohen's kappa = 0.805 and SE = 0.041) for CLIA, and 98.4% (Cohen's kappa = 0.962 and SE = 0.126) for ELISA. CONCLUSIONS: The results obtained indicate that, for CLIA assays, it might be possible to define thresholds that improve the negative likelihood ratio. Thus, a negative test result enables the identification of subjects at risk of being infected, who should then be closely monitored over time with a view to preventing further viral spread. Redefined thresholds, in addition, improved the overall inter-assay agreement, paving the way to a better harmonization of serologic tests.","Plebani, Mario; Padoan, Andrea; Negrini, Davide; Carpinteri, Benedetta; Sciacovelli, Laura",Clin Chim Acta,200,33

Nowadays, presenting intelligent biological data analysis tools at a low cost is important to analyze the biological structure of COVID-19. The global alignment algorithm is one of the important bioinformatics tools that measure the most accurate similarity between a pair of biological sequences. The huge time consumption of the standard global alignment algorithm is its main limitation especially for sequences with huge lengths. This work proposed a fast global alignment tool (G-Aligner) based on meta-heuristic algorithms that estimate similarity measurements near the exact ones at a reasonable time with low cost. The huge length of sequences leads G-Aligner based on standard Sine-Cosine optimization algorithm (SCA) to trap in local minima. Therefore, an improved version of SCA was presented in this work that is based on integration with PSO. Besides, mutation and opposition operators are applied to enhance the exploration capability and avoiding trapping in local minima. The performance of the improved SCA algorithm (SP-MO) was evaluated on a set of IEEE CEC functions. Besides, G-Aligner based on the SP-MO algorithm was tested to measure the similarity of real biological sequence. It was used also to measure the similarity of the COVID-19 virus with the other 13 viruses to validate its performance. The tests concluded that the SP-MO algorithm has superiority over the relevant studies in the literature and produce the highest average similarity measurements 75% of the exact one.","Issa, Mohamed",Appl Soft Comput,200,29

In our study, it was aimed to investigate the value of the radiological involvement on initial CT in demonstrating the ICU transfer and mortality rate of patients. Materials and methods: All PCR-positive patients were included in the study, whose CT, PCR, and laboratory values were obtained simultaneously at the time of first admission. Patients were divided into 4 groups in terms of the extent of radiological lesions. These groups were compared in terms of intensive care transfer needs and Covid-related mortality rates. Results: A total of 477 patients were included in the study. Ninety of them were group 0 (no lung involvement), 162 were group 1 (mild lesion), 89 were group 2 (moderate lesion), and 136 were group 3 (severe lung involvement). A significant relationship was found between the extensiveness of the radiological lesion on CT and admission to intensive care and mortality rate. As the initial radiological involvement amounts increased, the rate of ICU transfer and mortality increased. The mortality rates of the groups were 0%, 3%, 12.3%, and 12.5%, respectively, and the difference was significant (p < 0.001). Similarly, the ICU transfer rates of the groups were 2.2%, 5.6%, 13.5%, and 17.7%, respectively, and the difference was significant (p < 0.001). Conclusion: In conclusion, in our study, the strong relationship between the initial radiological extent assessment and the need for intensive care and mortality rates has been demonstrated, and we believe that our results will make a significant contribution to increase the success of the health system in predicting patients who may progress, helping clinicians and managing pandemics.","Aydemir, Yusuf; Gündüz, Yasemin; Köroglu, Mehmet; Karabay, Oguz; Dheir, Hamad; Sengül, Aysun; Yaylaci, Selçuk; Kocayigit, Havva; Erdem, Ali Fuat; Aydemir, Özlem; Güçlü, Ertugrul; Yürümez, Yusuf",Turk J Med Sci,200,33

In order to help slow the spread of the virus and save hospital resources, nonessential businesses were forced to close and elective surgeries have been postponed. METHODS: As we reach the peak of the pandemic and the COVID-19 vaccine gets distributed, healthcare systems must develop plans to safely resume elective surgeries. This article outlines a single center academic medical center's perioperative COVID-19 protocol to help keep surgeons, operating room teams, and patients safe. RESULTS: While testing protocols can help minimize the transmission of the virus, there is still the potential for COVID+ patients to undergo surgery undetected, due to potential false negative tests and the long incubation period before seroconversion and symptom development. CONCLUSIONS: An effective institutional strategy not only includes clear perioperative testing protocols, but also education regarding clinical manifestations and exposure control.","Bonano, John C; Huddleston, James I",J. arthroplasty,200,21

It is no longer just a convenience but a critical enabler of the transition to a resilient, low-carbon economy. The large pluralistic battery research and development community serving these needs has evolved into diverse specialties spanning materials discovery, battery chemistry, design innovation, scale-up, manufacturing and deployment. Despite the maturity and the impact of battery science and technology, the data and software practices among these disparate groups are far behind the state-of-the-art in other fields (e.g. drug discovery), which have enjoyed significant increases in the rate of innovation. Incremental performance gains and lost research productivity, which are the consequences, retard innovation and societal progress. Examples span every field of battery research , from the slow and iterative nature of materials discovery, to the repeated and time-consuming performance testing of cells and the mitigation of degradation and failures. The fundamental issue is that modern data science methods require large amounts of data and the battery community lacks the requisite scalable, standardized data hubs required for immediate use of these approaches. Lack of uniform data practices is a central barrier to the scale problem. In this perspective we identify the data- and software-sharing gaps and propose the unifying principles and tools needed to build a robust community of data hubs, which provide flexible sharing formats to address diverse needs. The Battery Data Genome is offered as a data-centric initiative that will enable the transformative acceleration of battery science and technology, and will ultimately serve as a catalyst to revolutionize our approach to innovation.","Ward, Logan; Babinec, Susan; Dufek, Eric J.; Howey, David A.; Viswanathan, Venkatasubramanian; Aykol, Muratahan; Beck, David A.C.; Blaiszik, Ben; Chen, Bor-Rong; Crabtree, George; Angelis, Valerio de; Dechent, Philipp; Dubarry, Matthieu; Eggleton, Erica E.; Finegan, Donal P.; Foster, Ian; Gopal, Chirranjeevi; Herring, Patrick; Hu, Victor W.; Paulson, Noah H.; Preger, Yulia; Sauer, Dirk Uwe; Smith, Kandler; Snyder, Seth; Sripad, Shashank; Tanim, Tanvir R.; Tao, Linnette",,200,30

A modified distributed link removal strategy is developed such that it can be applied to the SIR model with heterogeneous transition rates on weighted digraphs. The proposed approach is implemented to control the COVID-19 pandemic by using the reported infected and recovered data in each state of Germany.

METHODS: Psychological state was evaluated using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS), and Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS). All three questionnaires were first completed by medical personnel on 17-18 February 2020 and were repeated every 3 months thereafter until 17-18 August. The number and intentions of patients receiving radiotherapy (RT) in our department were also collected. RESULTS: Twenty medical personnel participated in the present study. The global PSQI score recorded in August was significantly lower than that recorded in February (P = 0.045). Among the seven components of the PSQI, sleep quality (P = 0.048) and daytime dysfunction (P = 0.006) in August were significantly improved compared with February, whereas SDS and SAS did not significantly differ among the three different time points. The proportion of patients who received palliative radiotherapy was significantly higher on 18 May than on 17 February (P = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Medical personnel in the Department of Radiotherapy experienced a significantly elevated incidence of sleeping problems during the early COVID-19 outbreak period.

A significant percentage of older American adults have these diseases, putting them at a higher risk of infection. Additionally, many adults with hypertension, diabetes, and CKD are placed on angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers. Studies have shown that these medications upregulate the ACE-2 receptor, the very receptor that the SARS-CoV-2 virus uses to enter host cells.

METHODS: We performed a systematic literature review using PubMed and Embase databases. We included all studies reporting abnormal neuroimaging findings among hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 and outcomes. Data elements including patient demographics, neuroimaging findings, acuity of neurological symptoms and/or imaging findings relative to COVID-19 onset (acute, subacute, chronic), and patient outcomes were recorded and summarized. RESULTS: After review of 775 unique articles, a total of 39 studies comprising 884 COVID-19 patients &#8805; 18 years of age with abnormal neuroimaging findings and reported outcomes were included in our analysis. Ischemic stroke was the most common neuroimaging finding reported (49.3%, 436/884) among patients with mortality outcomes data. Patients with intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) had the highest all-cause mortality (49.7%, 71/143), followed by patients with imaging features consistent with leukoencephalopathy (38.5%, 5/13), and ischemic stroke (30%, 131/436). There was no mortality reported among COVID-19 patients with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis without necrosis (0%, 0/8) and leptomeningeal enhancement alone (0%, 0/12). Stroke was a common acute or subacute neuroimaging finding, while leukoencephalopathy was a common chronic finding. CONCLUSION: Among hospitalized COVID-19 patients with abnormal neuroimaging findings, those with ICH had the highest all-cause mortality; however, high mortality rates were also seen among COVID-19 patients with ischemic stroke in the acute/subacute period and leukoencephalopathy in the chronic period. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: Specific abnormal neuroimaging findings may portend differential mortality outcomes, providing a potential prognostic marker for hospitalized COVID-19 patients.","Mogensen, Monique A; Wangaryattawanich, Pattana; Hartman, Jason; Filippi, Christopher G; Hippe, Daniel S; Cross, Nathan M",Br J Radiol,200,23

Guanylurea often accumulates and is poorly, if at all, biodegraded in wastewater treatment plants. This study describes Pseudomonas mendocina strain GU, isolated from a municipal wastewater treatment plant, using guanylurea as its sole nitrogen source. The genome was sequenced with 36-fold coverage and mined to identify guanylurea degradation genes. The gene encoding the enzyme initiating guanylurea metabolism was expressed, and the enzyme was purified and characterized. Guanylurea hydrolase, a newly described enzyme, was shown to transform guanylurea to one equivalent (each) of ammonia and guanidine. Guanidine also supports growth as a sole nitrogen source. Cell yields from growth on limiting concentrations of guanylurea revealed that metabolism releases all four nitrogen atoms. Genes encoding complete metabolic transformation were identified bioinformatically, defining the pathway as follows: guanylurea to guanidine to carboxyguanidine to allophanate to ammonia and carbon dioxide. The first enzyme, guanylurea hydrolase, is a member of the isochorismatase-like hydrolase protein family, which includes biuret hydrolase and triuret hydrolase. Although homologs, the three enzymes show distinct substrate specificities. Pairwise sequence comparisons and the use of sequence similarity networks allowed fine structure discrimination between the three homologous enzymes and provided insights into the evolutionary origins of guanylurea hydrolase.IMPORTANCE Metformin is a pharmaceutical most prescribed for type 2 diabetes and is now being examined for potential benefits to COVID-19 patients. People taking the drug pass it largely unchanged, and it subsequently enters wastewater treatment plants. Metformin has been known to be metabolized to guanylurea. The levels of guanylurea often exceed that of metformin, leading to the former being considered a ""dead-end"" metabolite. Metformin and guanylurea are water pollutants of emerging concern, as they persist to reach nontarget aquatic life and humans, the latter if it remains in treated water. The present study has identified a Pseudomonas mendocina strain that completely degrades guanylurea.

Como as espécies deste complexo apresentam grande similaridade morfológica, é possível que mais de uma espécie do complexo sanguineus esteja ocorrendo nas Américas. Um trabalho recente relatou parâmetros biológicos e genéticos significativamente diferentes entre uma população de R. sanguineus do Brasil e outra da Argentina, sugerindo que o status biosistemático de R. sanguineus na América do Sul deva ser revisto. Diante disto, e da inquestionável importância medico-veterinária de R. sanguineus na América do Sul, este projeto objetivou realizar uma análise genética de 32 populações de R. sanguineus, sendo 17 do Brasil (englobando 13 estados), 3 do Chile, 2 da Venezuela, 2 da Colômbia e 1 de cada um dos seguintes países: Argentina, Uruguai, Itália, Espanha, África do Sul, Costa Rica, Panamá, México. Uma amostra de Rhipicephalus turanicus da Espanha e uma da África do sul também foram analisadas. Para tal, carrapatos oriundos das diferentes populações foram analisados geneticamente através de seqüências dos genes mitocondriais 16S rDNA. O resultado deste trabalho permitiu inferir sobre a possibilidade da existência no mínimo de dois grupos distintos de carrapatos sob o táxon R. sanguineus na América Latina, um se aproximando dos carrapatos de origem africana e com distribuição na América tropical e subtropical e outro se aproximando das amostras européias e com distribuição temperada do sul da América do Sul","Moraes-Filho, Jonas",,200,32

METHODS: Retrospective cohort study between January 1, 2013 and December 31, 2018 at a single tertiary care academic pediatric otolaryngology practice of pediatric patients (&#8804;18 years) who underwent tympanostomy tube placement for any indication. Patients had to have insurance providers recorded both at clinic visit and at the time of surgery. Rates of cancelation and postponement of tympanostomy tube placement were assessed. Logistic regression was performed to determine factors associated with cancelation or postponement of surgery. RESULTS: Of the 5080 patients, 2961 patients had Medicaid and 2012 patients had private insurance at the time of surgery. A total of 197 (3.96%) patients switched insurance between clinic appointment and date of surgery. Time to surgery was nearly 2 weeks more for those who had a change in insurance vs. those who did not (33 vs. 20 days, P < .001). Those who switched insurance were nearly twice as likely to have to reschedule surgery than those who did not (OR 1.95, CI 1.42-2.67). Patients who had Medicaid as the primary payer also had increased odds of needing to reschedule and postpone surgery (OR 1.39, 95% CI 1.17-1.63). CONCLUSION: Difference in insurance carrier and loss/change of insurance appear to be associated with delays in tympanostomy tube placement. Standardization of re-enrollment schedules across insurance providers or a single payer model may be useful in addressing these delays in care.","Schwartz, Marissa; Shah, Rhea; Wetzel, Martha; Raol, Nikhila",Ann Otol Rhinol Laryngol,200,21

In an attempt to identify new and potential SARS-CoV2 inhibitors targeting specific enzyme of the pathogen, a few induced fit models of SARS-CoV2 main protease (Mpro) including N-aryl amide and aryl sulfonamide based fragments were subjected to a multi-step in silico strategy. Sub-structure query of co-crystallographic fragments provided numerous ZINC15 driven commercially available compounds that entered molecular docking stage to find binding interactions/modes inside Mpro active site. Docking results were reevaluated through time dependent stability of top-ranked ligand-protease complexes by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations within 50 ns. Relative contribution of interacted residues in binding to the most probable binding pose was estimated through amino acid decomposition analysis in B3LYP level of theory with Def2-TZVPP split basis set. In confirmation of docking results, MD simulations revealed less perceptible torsional distortions (more stable binding mode) in binding of ZINC_252512772 (&#916;Gb -9.18 kcal/mol) into Mpro active site. H-bond interactions and hydrophobic contacts were determinant forces in binding interactions of in silico hit. Quantum chemical calculations confirmed MD results and proved the pivotal role of a conserved residue (Glu166) in making permanent hydrogen bond (98% of MD simulations time) with ZINC_252512772.

The sudden increase in the number of patients and deaths from this novel type of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic poses a serious challenge to all arenas of health care delivery system. The care of high-time dependent-factor illnesses is essential for the survival of a patient and the need for avoiding impairment of health. The purpose of the review is to highlight that a change in first-aid attitudes can be assumed behind the delay in immediate interventions initiated by first responders during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. To maintain socially important first aid, the European Resuscitation Council amended its guidelines on first aid, basic life support and made further recommendations at the time of pandemic on first-aid education, too. For effective domestic adaptation, the present overview summarises the most important aspects of guidelines and their supplements and also covers their practical implementations. The main purpose of the change in guidelines is to bring the willingness of the first responders back to the level before the coronavirus pandemic, and to further enhance it with professional educational materials and modern methods.

Once the number of cases stabilized, there was recognition that a system was needed to triage and prioritize scheduling operations. METHODS: A universal scoring system to triage surgical elective cases was developed for the Advocate Aurora Health system (Surgical Wait Priority Score, SWAPS) and was modified for use in pediatrics (pSWAPS). Resource-related, patient-related, and case urgency factors were used to create the overall score. Interrater reliability of ten cases was determined by four surgeons' scores and calculating Fleiss’ Kappa coefficient. The system has been used for two months at two operating rooms with different resource restrictions with the goal of prioritizing elective cases. RESULTS: 18 factors were identified as significant contributors to the pWAPS creating a cumulative score ranging from 0 to 120. In the first month, 61 and 99 procedures were screened at the Oak Lawn (OL) and Park Ridge (PR) campuses respectively, and in the second month, 94 (OL) and 135 (PR) procedures were evaluated. The average pSWAPS scores were 37.9 at OL and 54.3 at PR. All cases that had scores within the immediate group were scheduled and completed. CONCLUSION: The pSWAPS system is a simple, flexible scoring system that takes into consideration resource constraints. pSWAPS has been used for two months. It has served as an effective tool for safe and methodical reintroduction of elective procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic and could be used again for another surge.

Convalescent plasma (CP) obtained from patients following recovery from COVID-19 infection and development of antibodies against the virus is an attractive option for either prophylactic or therapeutic treatment, since antibodies may have direct or indirect antiviral activities and immunotherapy has proven effective in principle and in many clinical reports. OBJECTIVE: We seek to characterize the latest advances and evidence in the use of CP for COVID-19 through a systematic review and quantitative analysis, identify knowledge gaps in this setting, and offer recommendations and directives for future research. METHODS: PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase were continuously searched for studies assessing the use of CP for COVID-19, including clinical studies, commentaries, reviews, guidelines or protocols, and in vitro testing of CP antibodies. The screening process and data extraction were performed according to PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. Quality appraisal of all clinical studies was conducted using a universal tool independent of study designs. A meta-analysis of case-control and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted using a random-effects model. RESULTS: Substantial literature has been published covering various aspects of CP therapy for COVID-19. Of the references included in this review, a total of 243 eligible studies including 64 clinical studies, 79 commentary articles, 46 reviews, 19 guidance and protocols, and 35 in vitro testing of CP antibodies matched the criteria. Positive results have been mostly observed so far when using CP for the treatment of COVID-19. There were remarkable heterogeneities in the CP therapy with respect to patient demographics, donor antibody titers, and time and dose of CP administration. The studies assessing the safety of CP treatment reported low incidence of adverse events. Most clinical studies, in particular case reports and case series, had poor quality. Only 1 RCT was of high quality. Randomized and nonrandomized data were found in 2 and 11 studies, respectively, and were included for meta-analysis, suggesting that CP could reduce mortality and increase viral clearance. Despite promising pilot studies, the benefits of CP treatment can only be clearly established through carefully designed RCTs. CONCLUSIONS: There is developing support for CP therapy, particularly for patients who are critically ill or mechanically ventilated and resistant to antivirals and supportive care. These studies provide important lessons that should inform the planning of well-designed RCTs to generate more robust knowledge for the efficacy of CP in patients with COVID-19. Future research is necessary to fill the knowledge gap regarding prevention and treatment for patients with COVID-19 with CP while other therapeutics are being developed.","Peng, Henry T; Rhind, Shawn G; Beckett, Andrew",JMIR Public Health Surveill,200,20

This gap also has resulted in variation of the educational curriculum in the academic setting and a lack of consistent preparation for emergency responses. The purpose of this study was to develop a list of competencies and measurable activities, or terminal objectives, for hospital-based health care personnel applicable for use during routine patient care activities as well as during natural and man-made disasters. METHODS: Competencies and terminal objectives related to infection prevention and control were developed using an evidence-based approach comprising the following steps: (a) review of the literature, (b) review of existing competencies and published curricula/training objectives, (c) synthesis of new competencies and terminal objectives, (d) expert panel review and competency refinement using the Delphi survey process, and (e) delineation of competencies by occupation. The 8 disciplines addressed were nurses (RNs and LPNs), nursing assistants, physicians, respiratory therapists, physical and occupational therapists, environmental services, laboratory professionals, and ancillary staff. RESULTS: An initial list of competency statements and terminal objectives were compiled and then vetted by a Delphi panel of experts in infection prevention and control until > 80% agreement was achieved on all competency statements and terminal objectives. CONCLUSION: The final matrix of competencies and terminal objectives developed through this process may be used as a content framework for educational curricula and training materials for hospital-based health care personnel. The process also may be of use in determining the core competencies and terminal objectives regarding infection prevention and control for health care personnel in other settings.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza virus are common causes of infantile lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI). It is widely believed that both viral replication and inappropriately enhanced immune responses contribute to disease severity. In infants, RSV LRTI is known to be more severe than influenza virus LRTI. Methods. We compared cytokines and chemokines in secretions of infants surviving various forms of respiratory illness caused by RSV or influenza viruses, to determine which mediators were associated with more-severe illness. We analyzed lung tissue from infants with fatal cases of RSV and influenza virus LRTI to determine the types of inflammatory cells present. Autopsy tissues were studied for the lymphotoxin granzyme and the apoptosis marker caspase 3. Results. Quantities of lymphocyte-derived cytokines were minimal in secretions from infants with RSV infection. Concentrations of most cytokines were greater in influenza virus, rather than RSV, infection. Lung tissues from infants with fatal RSV and influenza virus LRTI demonstrated an extensive presence of viral antigen and a near absence of CD8-positive lymphocytes and natural killer cells, with marked expression of markers of apoptosis. Conclusions. Severe infantile RSV and influenza virus LRTI is characterized by inadequate (rather than excessive) adaptive immune responses, robust viral replication, and apoptotic crisis.","Welliver, Timothy P.; Garofalo, Roberto P.; Hosakote, Yashoda; Hintz, Karen H.; Avendano, Luis; Sanchez, Katherine; Velozo, Luis; Jafri, Hasan; Chavez-Bueno, Susana; Ogra, Pearay L.; McKinney, LuAnn; Reed, Jennifer L.; Welliver, Robert C.",J Infect Dis,200,3

The gold standard for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, RT-PCR, has a high sensitivity but usually takes 6-8 hours. Lateral flow antigen assays take only 15-30 minutes and do not need any high tech equipment. In a prospective study of our hospital's HCWs, we evaluated the sensitivity of the Panbio COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test (Abbott) against the molecular test Aptima SARS-CoV-2 Assay (Hologic) which uses Transcription Mediated Amplification (TMA). TMA positive samples were further subjected to a quantitative real-time SARS-CoV-2 PCR to obtain Ct values as an indication of the viral load. Of 1101 HCWs included in the study between November 2020 and February 2021, 84 (7.6%) were TMA positive, of which 48 (57.1%) were antigen test positive. Most false negative antigen test results occurred if the duration of symptoms had been [≤]1 day or [≥]7 days. Sensitivities for symptom onset of [≤]1, 2 or 3 days were 47.1%, 63.0% and 66.7% respectively. The Panbio rapid test is fast and easy to perform, but is not a suitable SARS-CoV-2 test to confirm or exclude COVID-19 in HCWs with a very recent onset of symptoms.","Bruins, M.

However, the risk of heat stroke during intense work or exercise in hot and humid environments is a concern. This study aimed to examine whether wearing surgical masks increases the risk of heat stroke during mild exercise in such environments. Twelve participants conducted treadmill exercise for 30 min at 6 km/h, with 5% slope, 35°C ambient temperature, and 65% relative humidity, while wearing or not a surgical mask (mask and control trials, respectively). Rectal temperature (Trec), ear canal temperature (Tear), and mean skin temperature (mean Tskin) were assessed. Skin temperature and humidity of the perioral area of the face (Tface and RHface) were also estimated. Thermal sensation and discomfort, sensation of humidity, fatigue, and thirst were rated using the visual analogue scale. Trec, Tear, mean Tskin, and Tface increased during the exercise, without any difference between the two trials. RHface during the exercise was greater in the mask trial. The psychological ratings increased during the exercise, without any difference between the two trials. These results suggest that wearing surgical masks does not increase the risk of heat stroke during mild exercise in moist heat.","Kato, Issei; Masuda, Yuta; Nagashima, Kei",Industrial health,200,0

The purpose of this study is to analyze the utilization and patient satisfaction of synchronous ophthalmic video visits over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: In this retrospective, single-center cross-sectional study, 1,756 patients seen through synchronous video visits between March 1, 2020, and March 31, 2021, were identified using billing codes. E-mails containing a validated, 11-item, telehealth satisfaction scale were sent to patients who had at least one video visit within the study period. Questions were scored on a 1-4 scale, corresponding to poor, fair, good, and excellent. Main outcome measures included patient satisfaction scores, frequency of repeat video visits, and primary visit diagnoses. Results: The top 3 subspecialties by virtual visit volume were oculoplastic surgery (999 visits, 42.9%), neuro-ophthalmology (331 visits, 17.0%), and cornea (254 visits, 14.2%). The top 3 diagnoses seen were chalazion/hordeolum, dry eye, and meibomian gland dysfunction. The overall survey response rate was 14.3% (252 participants). The mean patient satisfaction score was 3.67 ± 0.63, with no significant difference in scores between specialties. A total of 380 (21%) patients had repeat virtual visits. Mean survey response scores were significantly higher for patients with repeat visits than those without (3.82 ± 0.42 vs. 3.62 ± 0.68, p = 0.03). Patients undergoing oculoplastic services were more likely to have repeat visits (odds ratio 2.58, 95% confidence interval 2.18-3.06, p < 0.001). Multivariate regression analysis found that provider thoroughness/skillfulness was the most predictive feature of the patient returning to a telehealth encounter (p = 0.01). Conclusions: Our study suggests that synchronous videoconferencing for ophthalmology is a highly satisfactory delivery method and will likely find continued success in select subspecialties as the pandemic fades.","Chen, Darren A; Tran, Ann Q; Dinkin, Marc J; Lelli, Gary J",Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association,200,3

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 1100 chest X-ray images were randomly selected from three different open sources, containing 300 X-ray images of confirmed COVID-19 patients, 400 images of other pneumonia patients, and 400 normal X-ray images. In this study, a classical machine learning approach was employed. The model was built using the support vector machine (SVM) classifier algorithm. The SVM was trained by 630 features obtained from the HOG descriptor, which was quantized into 30 orientation bins in the range between 0 and 360. The model was validated using a 10-fold cross-validation method. The performance of the model was evaluated using appropriate classification metrics, including sensitivity, specificity, area under the curve, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, kappa, and accuracy. RESULTS: The multi-level classification model was able to distinguish COVID-19 patients with a sensitivity of 97.92% and specificity of 98.91%, for the internal testing or cross-validation. For the independent external testing, the model showed sensitivity of 95% and specificity of 98.13%, for distinguishing COVID-19 from other pneumonia and no-findings. The binary classification model was able to distinguish COVID-19 patients with a sensitivity of 99.58% and specificity of 99.69%, for the internal testing. For the independent external testing, the model showed a sensitivity of 98.33% and specificity of 100%, for distinguishing COVID-19 from normal images. CONCLUSION: The model can achieve the rapid and accurate identification of COVID-19 patients from chest X-rays with more than 97% accuracy. This high accuracy and very rapid computer-aided diagnostic approach would be very helpful to control the pandemic.","Erdaw, Yabsera; Tachbele, Erdaw",Int J Gen Med,200,18

METHODS: Structured web-based questionnaire surveys in March 2021 of responsible national authorities, specialist societies and individual country representatives to the Section of Infectious Diseases of the European Union for Medical Specialties. Descriptive analysis of quantitative and qualitative responses. RESULTS: In responses received from 33/35 (94.3%) countries, ID is recognized as a specialty in 24 and as a subspecialty of general internal medicine (GIM) in eight, but it is not recognized in Spain. The number of ID specialists per country varies from <5 per million inhabitants to 78 per million inhabitants. Median length of training is 5 years (interquartile range 4.0-6.0 years) with variable amounts of preceding and/or concurrent GIM. Only 21.2% of countries (7/33) provide the minimum recommended training of 6 months in microbiology and 30% cover competencies such as palliative care, team working and leadership, audit, and quality control.

Better estimates of the yield of contact investigation can guide strategies to reduce the number of underreported and underdiagnosed TB cases, approximately three million cases per year globally. A systematic review (Prospero ID # CRD42019133380) and meta-analysis was conducted to update and enhance the estimates of the yield of TB contact investigation in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). Pubmed, Web of Science, Embase and the WHO Global Index Medicus were searched for peer-reviewed studies (published between January 2006–April 2019); studies reporting the number of active TB or latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) found through contact investigation were included. Pooled data were meta-analyzed using a random effects model and risk of bias was assessed. RESULTS: Of 1,644 unique citations obtained from database searches, 110 studies met eligibility criteria for descriptive data synthesis and 95 for meta-analysis. The pooled yields of contact investigation activities for different outcomes were: secondary cases of all active TB (defined as those bacteriologically confirmed or clinically diagnosed) 2.87% (2.61–3.14, I(2) 97.79%), bacteriologically confirmed active TB 2.04% (1.77–2.31, I(2) 98.06%), and LTBI 43.83% (38.11–49.55, I(2) 99.36%). Yields are interpreted as the percent of contacts screened who are diagnosed with active TB as a result of TB contact investigation activities. Pooled estimates were substantially heterogenous (I(2) ≥ 75%). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides methodologically rigorous and up-to-date estimates for the yield of TB contact investigation activities in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). While the data are heterogenous, these findings can inform strategic and programmatic planning for scale up of TB contact investigation activities.","Velleca, Mariana; Malekinejad, Mohsen; Miller, Cecily; Abascal Miguel, Lucia; Reeves, Hailey; Hopewell, Philip; Fair, Elizabeth",BMC Infect Dis,200,11

This novel virus spread rapidly to other countries. As of August 2020, there are close to 6 million diagnosed cases in the United States and 460,000 diagnosed cases in New York State. The purpose of this article is to examine the psychological impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on trainees in a New York City hospital. To achieve this goal, trainees of the Brooklyn Hospital Center were sent a questionnaire via e-mail. The questionnaire asked about the residents’ demographic characteristics, health information, and self-report questions regarding anxiety, depression, and PTSD (posttraumatic stress disorder). Methods Participants were trainees at the Brooklyn Hospital Center from the OMFS (oral and maxillofacial surgery), general dentistry, and other medical departments. A 3-part survey including demographic information, a PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire-9), and an impact of events score revised (IES-R) questionnaire was obtained. Descriptive analysis assessed participant demographic characteristics and mean scores on questionnaires. Additionally, independent samples t-test was used to determine statistical difference in mean scores on PHQ-9 and IES-R questionnaires between dental (OMFS and general dentistry) and medical specialties. Bivariate correlation was used to assess the relationship between scores on the PHQ-9 and IES-R questionnaires. Level of significance was accepted at .05. Results The mean score on the PHQ-9 questionnaire was significantly higher for dental compared to medical specialties (18.9 vs 7.24, P < .001). Likewise, for the IES-R questionnaire, the dental group scored significantly higher than the medical group (61.9 vs 30.36, P < .001). Furthermore, depression severity was much worse for the dental group: 7 (33.3% vs 8.9% medical, P < .001) were classified as severe and 12 (57.1% vs 8.9% medical, P = .013) were moderately severe. Conclusion Currently, trainees are facing enormous isolation, burnout, and fear of contracting and transmitting COVID-19.1 Trainees are also facing concerns about inadequate training (clinical and didactic). Previous literature has demonstrated that one's physical location and holding an intermediate title during a pandemic were associated with severe depression, distress, and anxiety.2-4 The participants of our study were trainees from the oral and maxillofacial surgery, general dentistry, and other medical specialty departments. The trainees from the dental department scored significantly higher on the IES-R and PHQ-9 questionnaires. Many participants had graduated from dental school less than a year ago. Additionally, this study was conducted in New York, which was the epicenter to the pandemic for a period of time. Being aware of the impact of the coronavirus on health care workers is an important step in providing intervention.

In order to stimulate their employees' willingness to innovate and their innovative behavior and reduce the turnover intention, companies are now seeking to establish employer–employee relationships in which their employee's willingness to stay is not simply driven by extrinsic motivations. Therefore, it is an important topic in human resources for companies to implement measures that encourage employees to willingly devote themselves to their jobs and consider organizational growth as a component of their career development. This study aimed to investigate the effect of person–organization fit and person–job fit on employees' innovative behavior and turnover intention via the mediators including job satisfaction and organizational commitment. Six hundred ninety-seven employees from China's eight major high-tech industries were examined in this study, and the empirical results were analyzed using partial least squares. Based on the results, it is suggested that the person–organization fit and person–job fit are both crucial factors affecting employees' job satisfaction and organizational commitment, which, in turn, increase employees' willingness to innovate in their jobs and reduce their turnover intentions. Furthermore, this study could serve as a reference for companies in selecting employees, promoting job satisfaction, and developing strategies for sustainable development.","Tang, Yuan; Shao, Yun-Fei; Chen, Yi-Jun; Ma, Yin",Front Psychol,200,30

The development of appropriate model cell behavior is intended to simulate two scenarios: the first is mechanical deformation during a crash and the second is an internal short circuit in lithium-ion cells during the actual effect scenarios. The punch test has been used as a benchmark to analyze the effects of different state of charge conditions on high-energy lithium-ion battery cells. This article explores the impact of three separate factors on the outcomes of mechanical punch indentation experiments. The first parameter analyzed was the degree of prediction brought about by experiments on high-energy cells with two different states of charge (greater and lesser), with four different sizes of indentation punch, from the cell’s reaction during the indentation effects on electrolyte. Second, the results of the loading position, middle versus side, are measured at quasi-static speeds. The third parameter was the effect on an electrolyte with a different state of charge. The repeatability of the experiments on punch loading was the last test function analyzed. The test results of a greater than 10% state of charge and less than 10% state of charge were compared to further refine and validate this modeling method. The different loading scenarios analyzed in this study also showed great predictability in the load-displacement reaction and the onset short circuit. A theoretical model of the cell was modified for use in comprehensive mechanical deformation. The overall conclusion found that the loading initiating the cell’s electrical short circuit is not instantaneously instigated and it is subsequently used to process the development of a precise and practical computational model that will reduce the chances of the internal short course during the crash.","Ye, Lihua; Ashfaq, Muhammad Muzamal; Shi, Aiping; Shah, Syyed Adnan Raheel; Shi, Yefan",Polymers (Basel),200,16

We aimed to characterize the toll of caring for coronavirus disease 2019 patients by registered nurses. DESIGN: An observational study of two registered nurses cohorts. SETTING: ICUs in a large academic center. SUBJECTS: Thirty-nine ICU registered nurses assigned to coronavirus disease 2019 versus noncoronavirus disease 2019 patients. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Skin temperature (t [°C]), galvanic skin stress response (GalvStress), blood pulse wave, energy expenditure (Energy [cal]), number of steps (hr(–1)), heart rate (min(–1)), and respiratory rate (min(–1)) were collected using biosensors during the shift. National Aeronautics and Space Administration Task Loading Index measured the subjective perception of an assignment load. Elevated skin temperatures during coronavirus disease 2019 shifts were recorded (Δt(COVID) vs t(non-COVID) = +1.3 [°C]; 95% CI, 0.1–2.5). Registered nurses staffing coronavirus disease patients self-reported elevated effort (ΔEffort(COVID) vs Effort(non-COVID) = +28.6; 95% CI, 13.3–43.9) concomitant with higher energy expenditure (ΔEnergy(COVID) vs Energy(non-COVID) = +21.5 [cal/s]; 95% CI, 4.2–38.7). Galvanic skin stress responses were more frequent among coronavirus disease registered nurse (ΔGalStress(COVID) vs GalvStress(non-COVID) = +10.7 [burst/hr]; 95% CI, 2.6–18.7) and correlated with self-reported increased mental burden (ΔTLXMental(COVID) vs ΔTLXMental(non-COVID) = +15.3; 95% CI, 1.0–29.6). CONCLUSIONS: There are indications that registered nurses providing care for coronavirus disease 2019 in the ICU reported increased thermal discomfort coinciding with elevated energy expenditure and a more pronounced self-perception of effort, stress, and mental demand.","Laudanski, Krzysztof; Moon, Ken; Singh, Amandeep; Chen, Ying; Restrepo, Mariana",Crit Care Explor,200,16

A group of closely related novel rhinoviruses have recently been discovered. Based on their unique phylogenetic position and distinct genomic features, they are classified as a separate species, HRV-C. After their discovery, HRV-C viruses have been detected in patients worldwide, with a reported prevalence of 1.4–30.9% among tested specimens. This suggests that the species contribute to a significant proportion of RTIs that were unrecognized in the past. HRV-C is also the predominant HRV species, often with a higher detection rate than that of the two previously known species, HRV-A and HRV-B. HRV-C infections appear to peak in fall or winter in most temperate or subtropical countries, but may predominate in the rainy season in the tropics. In children, HRV-C is often associated with upper RTIs, with asthma exacerbation and wheezing episodes being common complications. The virus has also been detected in children with bronchitis, bronchiolitis, pneumonia, otitis media, sinusitis and systemic infections complicated by pericarditis. As for adults, HRV-C has been associated with more severe disease such as pneumonia and exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. However, larger clinical studies with asymptomatic controls are required to better define the significance of HRV-C infection in the adult population. On the basis of VP4 sequence analysis, a potential distinct subgroup within HRV-C has also been identified, although more complete genome sequences are needed to better define the genetic diversity of HRV-C.","LauLau, S K P, SK; YipYip, C C Y, CC; WooWoo, P C Y, PC; Yuen, K-Y",Emerg Health Threats J,200,30

This fundamentally impacted the training of future health professionals and catalysed a significant response from across the health education sector. In 2020, the South African Association of Health Educationalists requested members to submit reflections on different aspects of their COVID-19 related educational responses. RESPONDING TO THE PANDEMIC: Seven vignettes focused specifically on clinical training in the context of primary care and family medicine. This short report highlights the key insights that emerged from these vignettes, considering what has been learnt in terms of health professions education and what we need to take forward. These insights include building on what was already in place, the student role, technology in the clinical learning context, taking workshops online, vulnerability and presence and the way going forward. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The contributions emphasised the value of existing relationships between the health services and training institutions, collaboration and transparent communication between stakeholders when navigating a crisis, responsiveness to the changed platform and dynamic environment and aligning teaching with healthcare needs. It is more important than ever to set explicit goals, have clarity of purpose when designing learning opportunities and to provide support to students. Some of these learning points may be appropriate for similar contexts in Africa. How we inculcate what we have learned into the post-pandemic period will bear testimony to the extent to which this crisis has enabled us to re-imagine health professions education.","Schmutz, Anna M.S.; Jenkins, Louis S.; Coetzee, Francois; Conradie, Hofmeyr; Irlam, James; Joubert, Elizabeth M.; Matthews, Dianne; van Schalkwyk, Susan C.",Afr J Prim Health Care Fam Med,200,23

Various TLRs are implicated in the early interplay of host cells with invading viruses, which regulates viral replication and/or host responses, ultimately impacting on viral pathogenesis. To survive the host innate defense mechanisms, many viruses have developed strategies to evade or counteract signaling through the TLR pathways, creating an advantageous environment for their propagation. Here we review the current knowledge of the roles TLRs play in antiviral innate immune responses, discuss examples of TLR-mediated viral recognition, and describe strategies used by viruses to antagonize the host antiviral innate immune responses.","Lester, Sandra N.; Li, Kui",Journal of Molecular Biology,200,0

LC16m8 is replication-competent and has been administered to over 100,000 infants and 3,000 adults with no serious adverse reactions. Despite this outstanding safety profile, the occurrence of spontaneously-generated large plaque-forming virulent LC16m8 revertants following passage in cell culture is a major drawback. We identified the gene responsible for the reversion and deleted the gene (B5R) from LC16m8 to derive LC16m8Δ. LC16m8∆ is non-pathogenic in immunodeficient severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice, genetically-stable and does not reverse to a large-plaque phenotype upon passage in cell culture, even under conditions in which most LC16m8 populations are replaced by revertants. Moreover, LC16m8∆ is >500-fold more effective than the non-replicating vaccinia virus (VV), Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA), at inducing murine immune responses against pathogenic VV. LC16m8∆, which expresses the SIV gag gene, also induced anti-Gag CD8(+) T-cells more efficiently than MVA and another non-replicating VV, Dairen I minute-pock variants (DIs). Moreover, LC16m8∆ expressing HIV-1 Env in combination with a Sendai virus vector induced the production of anti-Env antibodies and CD8(+) T-cells. Thus, the safety and efficacy of LC16m8∆ mean that it represents an outstanding platform for the development of human vaccine vectors.","Kidokoro, Minoru; Shida, Hisatoshi",Vaccines (Basel),200,1

The objective of this narrative review is to explore what is known about the activity of psychotropic medications against viruses in addition to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). PubMed was queried for ""drug repurposing, antiviral activity,"" and for ""antiviral activity"" with ""psychotropic drugs"" and individual agents, through November 2020. Of more than 100 psychotropic agents, 37 drugs, including 27 with a history of pediatric use were identified, which had been studied in the preclinical setting and found to have activity against viruses which are human pathogens. Effects were evaluated by type of virus and by category of psychotropic agent. Activity was identified both against viruses known to cause epidemics such as SARS-CoV-2 and Ebola and against those that are the cause of rare disorders such as Human Papillomatosis Virus-related respiratory papillomatosis. Individual drugs and classes of psychotropics often had activity against multiple viruses, with promiscuity explained by shared viral or cellular targets. Safety profiles of psychotropics may be more tolerable in this context than when they are used long-term in the setting of psychiatric illness. Nonetheless, translation of in vitro results to the clinical arena has been slow. Psychotropic medications as a class deserve further study, including in clinical trials for repurposing as antiviral drugs for children and adults.","Golden, Shea R; Rosenstein, Donald L; Belhorn, Tom; Blatt, Julie",Assay drug dev. technol.

Evidence shows that university life can pose various threats to the students' health. Especially first year students are vulnerable to mental health issues. To support well-being and prevent psychological distress from the first day of studying, onboarding programs are needed to promote the students' health and their self- and social competencies. The study demonstrates a tailored multi-component onboarding intervention program named “Healthy Study Start.” An evaluation of the effectiveness is presented focusing on outcomes regarding the students' sense of coherence (S-SoC), social support, sympathy, the work-related collective and the participative safety (a sub-scale of the team climate) among freshmen at the Carinthia University of Applied Sciences (CUAS, Austria). Methods: For the analyses, a quantitative controlled study design was used and results were measured three times. The intervention group (n = 72) was composed of freshmen selected from the bachelor study programs Occupational Therapy, Speech and Language Therapy, Biomedical Science and Radiologic Technology. Freshmen from the bachelor study program Healthcare and Nursing formed the control group (n = 81). As the requirements for analyses of variance were not fulfilled, the data had to be analyzed using e.g., Mann-Whitney U-tests. Results: Significant changes (all p < 0.016) between the two groups were found between T0/T1, and between T0/T2. Furthermore, changes within the intervention group (all p < 0.016) emerged in nearly all outcomes between T0/T1, while within the control group no changes were identified. However, the intervention group had statistically significantly higher values in the majority of outcomes at T1 and T2 compared to the control group. Conclusion: The onboarding program “Healthy Study Start” shows how an initiative at the beginning of their studies can support students in entering a new phase of their lives. The results indicate a positive effect on the students' self- and social competencies. However, students' health promotion is not only an investment for a health conscious university or an enhanced employability. Especially in health-related fields of study, students are future multipliers and play an essential role in implementing health promotion concepts for clients, patients and employees.","Limarutti, Andrea; Maier, Marco Johannes; Mir, Eva; Gebhard, Doris",Front Public Health,200,8

This cross-sectional study was conducted between October 2019 and March 2020. A total of 415 elderly participants aged 60 to 97 years (mean 81.12 ± 8.90 years) from 3 medical and nursing homes in Fuyang city, Anhui province, were selected using a convenience sampling method. Data were collected using a general information questionnaire, the Memorial University of Newfoundland Scale of Happiness, the self-acceptance scale, and the UCLA Loneliness scale. Correlations, regressions, and structural equation models were used for the analyses. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to confirm the factors influencing the SWB. Bootstrapping was performed to confirm the mediation effect. The loneliness of elderly subjects in nursing homes was significantly correlated with self-acceptance and SWB (r = −0.338, P < .01; r = −0.383, P < .01), and self-acceptance was significantly correlated with SWB (r = 0.401, P < .01). Multiple linear regression revealed that the relationship with children, loneliness, residence time in nursing homes, income, marital status, self-acceptance, original residence, and frequency of children's visits were the main factors affecting SWB. Bootstrapping showed that the mediating role of self-acceptance was statistically significant. The SWB of elderly individuals living in Chinese nursing homes was moderate. Low-income people, subjects from rural areas, and those newly admitted to nursing homes should be emphasized in interventions, and appropriate measures should be taken to harmonize the relationships between elderly residents and their children. Self-acceptance partially mediated the relationship between loneliness and SWB. Consequently, self-acceptance should be the focus of improving the SWB of elderly nursing home residents.","Li, Shanshan; Zhang, Xing; Luo, Caifeng; Chen, Moyan; Xie, Xin; Gong, Fuyu; Lv, Fei; Xu, Jianou; Han, Juan; Fu, Lin; Sun, Yanpeng",Medicine (Baltimore),200,3

Poor communication is the most commonly cited reason for conflict and is exacerbated when providers and families cannot find common ground and develop mutual trust. It is critically important that healthcare providers learn strategies to better partner with families in order to optimize patient medical and psychosocial outcomes. This requires providers to avoid falling prey to their own implicit (or unconscious) biases, including those towards families labeled as “difficult”. Building a healthy family-provider relationship is part of a healthcare provider’s duty to treat, has a measurable effect on patient outcomes, and sets up a foundation for the provider-family dyad to more easily navigate any conflicts that do develop. Once a relationship is built, providers and families can talk through their conflicts. They are more likely to have open and transparent communication and are more able to give each other the benefit of the doubt when navigating difficult situations and/or behaviors, rather than labeling each other as intrinsically “difficult” people.","Allen, Kiona Y.; Davis, Audra",Prog Pediatr Cardiol,200,20

However, almost one third of patients also develop neurological symptoms. The aim of the present study is to describe the case of a previously health adult that evolved cerebral ventricular empyema in the IV ventricle during COVID-19 infection treatment. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 49-year-old man with COVID-19 developed pneumonia caused by multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii. After treating adequate treatment, sedation was switched off without showing appropriate awakening. Brain CT was performed with evidence of communicating hydrocephalus. External ventricular shunt (EVD) was implant with intraoperative cerebrospinal fluid suggestive of meningitis with a positive culture for oxacillin-sensitive Staphylococcus hominis. Twenty days after EVD, meningitis treatment was finished and with 2 negative cultures, conversion to ventriculoperitoneal shunt was performed. In the following week, during the evaluation of the patient in intensive care, quadriplegia and absence of spontaneous respiratory movement were evidenced, just maintaining head movement. Brain MRI was performed with a diagnosis of ventriculitis associated with pus collections on the IV ventricle. The patient underwent microsurgical drainage removal of the shunt, with a positive intraventricular collection culture for Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase and multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, without improvement in the neurological condition. After 14 weeks of hospitalization, the patient died. CONCLUSION: It is well known that COVID-19 has potential to directly attack and cause severe damage to the central nervous system; however, ventricular empyema is an extremely rare life-threatening complication.","Meguins, Lucas Crociati; Rocha, Andre Salotto; Laurenti, Matheus Rodrigo; de Morais, Dionei Freitas",Surg Neurol Int,200,20

Disease outbreaks are becoming increasingly common and priority setting lessons from previous disease outbreaks could be better harnessed to inform decision making and planning for future disease outbreaks. The purpose of this paper is to discuss how priority setting and resource allocation could, ideally, be integrated into the WHO pandemic planning and preparedness framework and used to inform the COVID-19 pandemic recovery plans and plans for future outbreaks. Priority setting and resource allocation during disease outbreaks tend to evoke a process similar to the 'rule of rescue'. This results in inefficient and unfair resource allocation, negative effects on health and non-health programs and increased health inequities. Integrating priority setting and resource allocation activities throughout the four phases of the WHO emergency preparedness framework could ensure that priority setting during health emergencies is systematic, evidence informed and fair.","Kapiriri, Lydia; Essue, Beverly; Bwire, Godfrey; Nouvet, Elysee; Kiwanuka, Suzanne; Sengooba, Freddie; Reeleder, David",Glob Public Health,200,1

Although drill-free miniscrews (DFS) accompany these systems, they have not dominated practice despite their allure of improved screw-bone contact and holding power. The COVID-19 pandemic has brought these DFS to light as they avoid aerosol production. The present study has compared DFS to STS in patients being treated with miniplate fixation for maxillofacial trauma to understand their feasibility for maxillofacial fracture fixation. METHODOLOGY: This prospective case–control study sampled 16 patients each with zygomaticomaxillary buttress fracture and parasymphysis fracture of the mandible and grouped alternating patients as case (DFS) and control (STS). Intraoperatively duration of fixation, incidence of screw failures and fragment stability; postoperatively occlusion, neurosensory deficits, teeth vitality and infection and removal rates were evaluated at postoperative week 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 using Cramer's V test. A P value < 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: In the 32 patients evaluated, DFS reduced internal fixation time at zygomaticomaxillary buttress (P = 0.001) but not at parasymphysis (P = 0.206). No significant difference in screw failures or fragment stability was observed. Stable occlusion was maintained in all groups with vital teeth and intact neurosensory function, but the summative incidence of infection was significant at week 24 when STS was used at parasymphysis (P = 0.019). DISCUSSION: While DFS may facilitate ease of insertion with a single instrument pick-and-screw-in approach, avoiding thermal osteonecrosis and aerosol production, they fail to confer any other clinical advantage.","Hiriyanna, Namitha M.; Degala, Saikrishna; Shetty, Sujeeth Kumar",J Maxillofac Oral Surg,200,16

SARS-CoV-2 entry to host cells are initiated by binding with its receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) 2, and the ACE2 abundance is thought to reflect the susceptibility to infection. Here, we found that clomipramine, a tricyclic antidepressant, potently inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection and metabolic disorder in human iPS-derived cardiomyocytes. Among 13 approved drugs that we have previously identified as potential inhibitor of doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity, clomipramine showed the best potency to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein pseudovirus-stimulated ACE2 internalization. Indeed, SARS-CoV-2 infection to human iPS-derived cardiomyocytes (iPS-CMs) and TMPRSS2-expressing VeroE6 cells were dramatically suppressed even after treatment with clomipramine. Furthermore, the combined use of clomipramine and remdesivir was revealed to synergistically suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The tetranortriterpenoid 1-cinnamoyl-3,11-dihydroxymeliacarpin (CDM), obtained from MA purification, displays anti-herpetic activity and impedes nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) activation in HSV-1 infected conjunctival cells. To extend our understanding about CDM biological properties, we investigated its anti-HSV-1 activity as well as the effect on NF-κB activation and cytokine secretion induced by viral (HSV-1) and no-viral (LPS) stimuli, in corneal cells and macrophages. CDM exerted a potent anti-HSV-1 effect on corneal cells and inhibited NF-κB translocation to the nucleus, leading to a decrease in IL-6 production. Besides, CDM seemed to modulate IL-6 and TNF-α responses in macrophages, whether they were infected with HSV-1 or stimulated with LPS. However, CDM did not affect NF-κB activation in these cells, suggesting that an alternative NF-κB cell signaling pathway would be involved in the modulation of cytokine production. We conclude that, in addition to its antiviral effect, CDM would be acting as an immunomodulating compound which would be responsible for the improvement of murine HSK already reported.","Bueno, Carlos A.; Barquero, Andrea A.; Di Cónsoli, Hernán; Maier, Marta S.; Alché, Laura E.",Virus Res,200,16

They were initially characterised as inhibitors of lysosomal cysteine proteases, however, in recent years some alternative functions for cystatins have been proposed. Cystatins possessing inhibitory function are members of three families, family I (stefins), family II (cystatins) and family III (kininogens). Stefin A is often linked to neoplastic changes in epithelium while another family I cystatin, stefin B is supposed to have a specific role in neuredegenerative diseases. Cystatin C, a typical type II cystatin, is expressed in a variety of human tissues and cells. On the other hand, expression of other type II cystatins is more specific. Cystatin F is an endo/lysosome targeted protease inhibitor, selectively expressed in immune cells, suggesting its role in processes related to immune response. Our recent work points on its role in regulation of dendritic cell maturation and in natural killer cells functional inactivation that may enhance tumor survival. Cystatin E/M expression is mainly restricted to the epithelia of the skin which emphasizes its prominent role in cutaneous biology. Here, we review the current knowledge on type I (stefins A and B) and type II cystatins (cystatins C, F and E/M) in pathologies, with particular emphasis on their suppressive vs. promotional function in the tumorigenesis and metastasis. We proposed that an imbalance between cathepsins and cystatins may attenuate immune cell functions and facilitate tumor cell invasion.","Magister, Špela; Kos, Janko",J Cancer,200,16

As both the number of cases and the hospitalization needs for this pathology decreased, we thought it appropriate to progressively recover scheduled surgical activity. This work describes how, even with the current alarm state, we were able to practically normalize this activity in a few weeks. Methods Two weeks before the intervention, the patients included in the waiting lists were contacted by telephone. After checking their health status and expressing their desire to undergo surgery, they were provided with recommendations to decrease the risk of coronavirus infection. Likewise, an exclusive circuit was established to carry out, 48hours before the intervention, the detection of SARS-CoV-2 by means of exudates nasopharyngeal PCR. The results were evaluated by each surgical service and the anesthesiology service. In addition, asymptomatic Surgical Area professionals could undergo weekly screening for the early detection of coronavirus according to the recommendations of Occupational Health. Results In the midst of a pandemic, scheduled surgical activity was reduced by 85%. From the week of April 13, the operating rooms available were recovered, which allowed practically all surgical activity to be recovered the week of May 25. Conclusions The creation of circuits and procedures to streamline surgical activity, still in full force of the state of alarm, has allowed us, in a few weeks, to recover almost all of it.","Pou, Noemí; Peix, Teresa; Trias, Susagna; Trilla, Antoni; Varela, Pilar; Martínez, Gemma; Castells, Antoni",J Healthc Qual Res,200,30

Prone positioning (PP) is a postural therapy for ARDS, which permits for better ventilation/perfusion ratio (V/Q) matching, improvement of hypoxemia. Some articles revealed that performing PP during ECMO for refractory respiratory failure is feasible; however, the results obtained were controversial. Therefore, we performed a systematic review to further assess the effects of PP during ECMO for refractory respiratory failure. Six studies with 465 subjects were enrolled. Four articles examined changes of PaO2/FiO2 ratio after PP during VV-ECMO; PaO2/FiO2 ratio improved from 18.5 to 62 mmHg. Our analysis inferred that the PP-ECMO group did not have a significant advantage in survival at discharge (odds risk 1.42, 95% confidence interval 0.92–2.18; p = 0.11) compared with the ECMO group. We found that the PP-ECMO group had a significantly longer duration than the ECMO group (MD 5.37, 95% CI 4.19–6.54, I(2) = 67%, P < .00001).

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this work was to compare saliva and gingival fluid swabs to NP swabs as specimens for RT-qPCR-based SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis. METHODS: We compared gingival fluid swabs (n = 158) and saliva (n = 207) to the rayon-tipped NP swabs obtained from mild-symptomatic and asymptomatic subjects as specimens for RT-qPCR for SARS-CoV-2 detection. FINDINGS: When compared to NP swabs, gingival fluid swabs had a concordance rate of 15.4% among positive samples, zero among inconclusive, and 100% among negative ones. For saliva samples, the concordance rate was 67.6% among positive samples, 42.9% among inconclusive, and 96.8% among negative ones. However, the concordance rate between saliva and NP swabs was higher (96.9%) within samples with lower cycle threshold (Ct) values (Ct > 10 ≤ 25).

To identify the new emergent variants, the surveillance of the variants of concern (VOC) and variants of interest (VOI) is ongoing. This study aimed to determine how the transition of viral lineage occurred by stationary genome analysis in Yamanashi, Japan. METHODS: We performed the whole genome sequencing using SARS-CoV-2 positive samples collected from February 2020 to the end of June 2021. Viral lineage was defined by the Phylogenetic Assignment of Named Global Outbreak (PANGO) lineages. RESULTS: We successfully obtained 325 viral genome sequences and the number of analyzed samples accounted for 15.4% of the total 2109 COVID-19 patients identified in our district. We identified 13 types of viral lineages including R.1, P.1, B.1.1.7 (Alpha) and B.1.617.2 (Delta). These virus lineages had distinct periods of expansion and decline. After the emerging of the R.1 lineage harboring E484K variant (designated VOI in Japan), the prevalent B.1.1.214 lineage were no longer identified. The R.1 lineages were temporarily prevalent afterwards, but the influx of B.1.1.7 lineage (designated VOC) led to a decline in R.1. Currently, B.1.1.7 has become dominant after mid-April 2021. CONCLUSION: We clearly elucidated the transition and replacement of viral lineage by the community-based analysis. The virus completely replaced by more infectious lineages, therefore, it will be necessary to continue to monitor the VOC and VOI.","Hirotsu, Yosuke; Omata, Masao",Infect Genet Evol,200,5

We evaluated the efficacy of two disinfectants against a replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 surrogate on three common public surfaces. Vesicular stomatitis virus expressing green fluorescent protein (VSV-GFP) was our replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 surrogate. Disinfection occurred using Super Sani-Cloth Germicidal Disposable Wipes and Oxivir Tb spray per manufacturer instructions to test the efficacy at reducing the presence, viability, and later replication of VSV-GFP on stainless steel, laminate wood, and porcelain surfaces using standardized methods after recovery and toxicity testing. During the main trials, we placed 100 µL spots of VSV-GFP at viral titers of 10(8), 10(7), and 10(6) PFU/mL on each surface prior to disinfection. Trials were completed in triplicate and post-disinfection measurements on each surface were compared to the measurements of non-disinfected surfaces. Disinfectants were considered efficacious when ≥3-log(10) reduction in the number of infectious VSV-GFP virus units was observed on a given surface during all trials. Both disinfectants produced a ≥3.23-log(10) reduction in infectious VSV-GFP virus unit numbers, with all trials showing no viable, replication-competent VSV-GFP present on any tested surface. The two disinfectants eliminated the presence, viability, and later replication of VSV-GFP, our SARS-CoV-2 surrogate, on all surfaces. This information suggests that, if following manufacturer instructions, overcleaning surfaces with multiple disinfectant solutions may be unnecessary.","Pope, Zachary C.; Kottke, Timothy J.; Shah, Aditya; Vile, Richard G.; Rizza, Stacey A.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,200,5

RNA was extracted and tested by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for the presence of rotavirus, norovirus, astrovirus, torovirus, coronavirus and bovine viral diarrhea virus. Overall, 76 % (19/25) of samples tested positive for one or more viruses. Rota-, noro- and astroviruses were detected in 48 %, 24 % and 32 % of tested samples, respectively. About 37 % (7/19) of positive samples had two different viruses. One-month-old calves were the group most vulnerable to infections. Based on phylogenetic analysis, bovine rotaviruses were of genotypes G6 and G10, bovine noroviruses were in GIII.2, and bovine astroviruses were in the BAstV lineage 1. Astrovirus sequences showed a high level nucleotide sequence similarity with the Brazilian BAstV sequences available in GenBank. We believe this is the first report of bovine norovirus and bovine astrovirus circulating among calves in Egypt.

However, to our knowledge, no study has examined the association between NSAID use and the risk of COVID-19-related outcomes among hospitalised patients. METHODS: We conducted a population-based cohort study using South Korea nationwide healthcare database, which contains data of all subjects who received a test for COVID-19 (n=69,793) as of April 8, 2020. We identified a cohort of adults hospitalised with COVID-19, where cohort entry was the date of hospitalisation. NSAIDs users were those prescribed NSAIDs while hospitalised and non-users were those not prescribed NSAIDs. Our primary outcome was a composite of death, intensive care unit admission, mechanical ventilation use, and sepsis; secondary outcome was cardiovascular or renal complications. We conducted logistic regression analysis to estimate adjusted odds ratio (aOR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the risk of these outcomes associated with NSAIDs users versus non-users, using propensity score-inverse probability of treatment weighting to minimize potential confounding. In sensitivity analyses, we compared NSAIDs to paracetamol (acetaminophen) to minimize confounding by indication. FINDINGS: Of 1,824 adults hospitalised with COVID-19 (mean age 44.7 years; female 59%), 285 were NSAIDs users and 1,539 were non-users. Compared with non-users, NSAIDs users were associated with increased risks of the primary composite outcome (aOR 1.54, 95% CI 1.11-2.15) and cardiovascular or renal complications (aOR 2.64, 95% CI 1.67-4.16). The association with primary outcome remained consistent when comparing NSAIDs to paracetamol (aOR 1.31, 95% CI 0.89-1.95). INTERPRETATION: Use of NSAIDs, compared with non-use, is associated with worse outcomes among hospitalised COVID-19 patients. While awaiting the results of confirmatory studies, we suggest NSAIDs be used with caution as the harms associated with their use may outweigh their benefits in this population.","Jeong, H.

The immune response to vaccines against other infectious agents has been shown to be blunted in such patients. We aimed to analyse the humoral and cellular response to prime-boost vaccination with the BNT162b2 vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech) in cardiothoracic transplant recipients. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 50 transplant patients [1–3 years post heart (42), lung (7), or heart–lung (1) transplant, mean age 55 ± 10 years] and a control group of 50 healthy staff members were included. Blood samples were analysed 21 days after the prime and the boosting dose, respectively, to quantify anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S) immunoglobulin titres (tested by Abbott, Euroimmun and RocheElecsys Immunoassays, each) and the functional inhibitory capacity of neutralizing antibodies (Genscript). To test for a specific T-cell response, heparinized whole blood was stimulated with SARS-CoV-2 specific peptides, covering domains of the viral spike, nucleocapsid and membrane protein, and the interferon-γ release was measured (QuantiFERON Monitor ELISA, Qiagen). The vast majority of transplant patients (90%) showed neither a detectable humoral nor a T-cell response three weeks after the completed two-dose BNT162b2 vaccination; these results are in sharp contrast to the robust immunogenicity seen in the control group: 98% exhibited seroconversion after the prime dose already, with a further significant increase of IgG titres after the booster dose (average > tenfold increase), a more than 90% inhibition capability of neutralizing antibodies as well as evidence of a T-cell responsiveness. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of poor immune responses to a two-dose BNT162b2 vaccination in cardiothoracic transplant patients have a significant impact for organ transplant recipients specifically and possibly for immunocompromised patients in general. It urges for a review of future vaccine strategies in these patients.","Schramm, René; Costard-Jäckle, Angelika; Rivinius, Rasmus; Fischer, Bastian; Müller, Benjamin; Boeken, Udo; Haneya, Assad; Provaznik, Zdenek; Knabbe, Cornelius; Gummert, Jan",Clin Res Cardiol,200,8

The World Health Organization recommends the Charité-Berlin protocol for COVID-19 diagnosis, which requires triple PCR, limiting the process capability of laboratories and delaying the results. In order to reduce these limitations, a duplex PCR is validated for the detection of the E and ribonuclease P genes. Methods: We compared the limit of detection, sensitivity and specificity of the duplex PCR technique (E gene and Rnasa P) against the monoplex standard (E gene) in RNA samples from a SARS-CoV-2 isolate and 88 clinical specimens with previously known results. The repeatability and reproducibility of the threshold cycle values (Ct) were determined in two independent laboratories of the Faculty of Medicine of the Universidad de Antioquia, using different reagents and real time instruments. Results: There were no significant differences in the Ct results between both techniques (p = 0.84). Using the monoplex PCR of E gene as a reference, the interrater reliability analysis showed similarity between the two techniques, with a kappa coefficient of 0.89, the sensitivity and the specificity of duplex PCR were 90% and 87%, respectively. Conclusions: Duplex PCR does not affect the sensitivity and specificity reported by the Charité, Berlin protocol, being a useful tool for SARS-CoV-2 screening in clinical samples.","Rua, Katherine Palacio; Correa, Juan Felipe García; Aguilar, Wbeimar; Ayala, Carlos Afanador; Rugeles, María Teresa; Zuluaga, Andres F",Enferm Infecc Microbiol Clin,200,30

However, there are no current effective antivirals or licensed vaccines for infection prevention. Moreover, sequence information for human parainfluenza viruses (HPIVs) circulating in China is inadequate. Therefore, to shed light on viral genetic diversity and evolution, we collected samples from patients infected with HPIV1–4 in China from 2012 to 2018 to sequence the viruses. We obtained 24 consensus sequences, comprising 1 for HPIV1, 2 for HPIV2, 19 for HPIV3, and 2 for HPIV4A. Phylogenetic analyses classified the 1 HPIV1 into clade 2, and the 2 HPIV4 sequences into cluster 4A. Based on the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) gene, a new sub-cluster was identified in one of the HPIV2, namely G1c, and the 19 HPIV3 sequences were classified into the genetic lineages of C3f and C3a. The results indicated that HPIV1–4 were co-circulated in China. Further, the lineages of sub-cluster C3 of HPIV3 were co-circulated in China. A recombination analysis indicated that a putative recombination event may have occurred in the HN gene of HPIV3. In the obtained sequences of HPIV3, we found that two amino acid substitution sites (R73K in the F protein of PUMCH14028/2014 and A281V in the HN protein of PUMCH13961/2014) and a negative selection site (amino acid position 398 in the F protein) corresponded to the previously reported neutralization-related sites. Moreover, amino acid substitution site (K108E) corresponded to the negative selection site (amino acid position 108) in the 10 F proteins of HPIV3. However, no amino acid substitution site corresponded to the glycosylation site in the obtained HPIV3 sequences. These results might help in studying virus evolution, developing vaccines, and monitoring HPIV-related respiratory diseases.","Shao, Nan; Liu, Bo; Xiao, Yan; Wang, Xinming; Ren, Lili; Dong, Jie; Sun, Lilian; Zhu, Yafang; Zhang, Ting; Yang, Fan",Front Microbiol,200,16

This procedure is laborious and poses LN(2) related hazards. An alternative logistics for transportation of samples was investigated. Use of Flinders Technology Associates (FTA(®)) elute card was evaluated for transportation of extended bovine semen to screen BoHV-1 DNA by real-time PCR targeting gB gene and the method was compared with the OIE approved Chelex resin based method. A protocol for extraction of BoHV-1 DNA from FTA(®) card spotted with extended semen was optimized. The viral DNA was found to be stable on FTA(®) card for at least 28 days when the cards are stored at 4°–37 °C. The analytical sensitivity for the assay was determined using variable dilutions of BoHV-1 spiked semen and positive plasmid harbouring gB gene (97bp) spotted onto FTA(®) card and it was found to be 10(0.8) TCID(50)/ml or 100 copies respectively in real-time PCR. The test could detect as low as 10(0.008) TCID(50)/ml or 1 copy of positive plasmid when more number of replicates (n = 6) of the same sample were tested. This sensitivity was found to be comparable to Chelex method and both the methods demonstrated a very strong correlation (r = 0.9774; 95% CI: 0.9620–0.9860) in terms of Ct value (p < 0.0001). The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the FTA method in comparison to the Chelex method was 83.08% (95% CI: 71.73%–91.24%) and 93.23% (95% CI: 89.38%–96.01%) respectively when 316 samples were screened by both the methods. The degree of agreement between these two tests was good (Kappa value: 0.738; 95% CI: 0.646–0.829).

In particular, we focused on whether this property is attributable to direct inhibition of reovirus attachment and/or inhibition of viral replication with the aid of time-of-addition (pre-treatment, simultaneous treatment, and post-treatment) experiments. No significant antiviral activity of kuraridin was detected in the pre-treatment assay. In the simultaneous assay, the 50% effective inhibitory concentrations (EC(50)) of kuraridin were 15.3–176.9 μM against human type 1–3 reoviruses (HRV1–3) and Korean porcine reovirus (PRV). Kuraridin completely blocked binding of viral sigma 1 protein to sialic acids at concentrations lower than 82.5 μM in the hemagglutination inhibition assay. Moreover, kuraridin inhibited HRV1–3 and PRV viral replication with EC(50) values of 14.0–62.0 μM. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis disclosed strong suppression of reovirus RNA synthesis at the late stage (18 h) of virus replication by kuraridin. The viral yields of kuraridin-treated cells were significantly reduced at 24 h post-infection, compared with DMSO-treated cells.

This study investigated the predictions of the public and healthcare workers (HCWs) at an early stage of the United Kingdom (UK) pandemic to assess their understanding of this novel virus and provide a reflection of the information readily available to them at the time. Method: A cross-sectional survey between the 18th and 20th March 2020 of UK adults was conducted via an anonymous 17-question online questionnaire using a snowball sampling technique. Simple descriptive statistics, repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA), and unpaired Mann-Whitney t-tests investigated significance at the P<·05 levels. Results: A total of 823 UK residents responded, of which 12·0% (n=99) were HCWs (doctors and nurses). The primary information sources used by our participants were BBC News, group messaging such as WhatsApp, and NHS England. The majority (38·9%) estimated government-enacted social restrictions would last two to four weeks. Mean best guess of total UK COVID-19 mortality was 1000 to 10,000 deaths, and the majority of participants (77·9%) revealed that they expected their day-to-day lives to be affected for less than six months in total. HCWs consistently estimated greater duration, scale, and impact of COVID-19 than non-healthcare workers (Non-HCWs). Conclusion: Survey respondents greatly underestimated the duration and impact of COVID-19 on their personal and public lives. Non-HCWs made greater underestimates than HCWs. This provides a historical reference and highlights a lack of clear information regarding the pandemic at the time of the survey. There is an ongoing need for effective, realistic, and timely communication between government, front-line clinicians, and the general public to manage expectations of the course of the pandemic and, consequently, increase adherence to public health measures.","Cheese, Francine; Coulton, Harry",Cureus,200,30

However, inadequate testing capacity limits the applicability of this recommendation, especially in the low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). To develop a practical reopening strategy for LMICs, in this study, we first identify the optimal timing of safe reopening by exploring accessible epidemiological data of 24 countries during the initial COVID-19 surge. We find that a safe opening can occur two weeks after the crossover of daily infection and recovery rates while maintaining a negative trend in daily new cases. Epidemiologic SIRM model-based example simulation supports our findings.

However, quantitatively predicting in advance the effects of lockdowns based on their stringency and duration is a complex task, in turn making it difficult for governments to design effective strategies to stop the disease. Leveraging a novel mathematical “hybrid” approach, we propose a new epidemic model that is able to predict the future number of active cases and deaths when lockdowns with different stringency levels or durations are enforced. The key observation is that lockdown-induced modifications of social habits may not be captured by traditional mean-field compartmental models because these models assume uniformity of social interactions among the population, which fails during lockdown. Our model is able to capture the abrupt social habit changes caused by lockdowns. The results are validated on the data of Israel and Germany by predicting past lockdowns and providing predictions in alternative lockdown scenarios (different stringency and duration). The findings show that our model can effectively support the design of lockdown strategies by stringency and duration, and quantitatively forecast the course of the epidemic during lockdown.","Mellone, Alberto; Gong, Zilong; Scarciotti, Giordano",Sci Rep,200,16

This is a member of Coronaviridae family in the genus Betacoronavirus, which also includes SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the functional receptor for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 to enter the host cells. In particular, the interaction of viral spike proteins with ACE2 is a critical step in the viral replication cycle. The receptor binding domain of the viral spike proteins and ACE2 have several cysteine residues. In this study, the role of thiol-disulfide balance on the interactions between SARS-CoV/CoV-2 spike proteins and ACE2 was investigated using molecular dynamic simulations. The study revealed that the binding affinity was significantly impaired when all the disulfide bonds of both ACE2 and SARS-CoV/CoV-2 spike proteins were reduced to thiol groups. The impact on the binding affinity was less severe when the disulfide bridges of only one of the binding partners were reduced to thiols. This computational finding provides a molecular basis for the severity of COVID-19 infection due to the oxidative stress.","Hati, Sanchita; Bhattacharyya, Sudeep",bioRxiv,200,1

Both twins demonstrated comparable 7S and 198 humoral antibody response to KLH, as well as similar viral antibody titers. However, the twin with SLE was anergic to common antigens, streptokinase-streptodornase, Trichophyton and Candida; furthermore delayed hypersensitivity to KLH did not develop after immunization.

The researchers across the globe are struggling hard to search a drug to treat this infection. Understanding the time constraint, the best approach is to study clinically approved drugs for control of this deadly pandemic of COVID 19. The repurposing of such drugs can be supported with the study of molecular interactions to enhance the possibility of application. The present work is a molecular docking study of proteins responsible for viral propagation namely 3Clpro, Nsp10/16, Spike protein, SARS protein receptor binding domain, Nsp 9 viral single strand binding protein and viral helicase. The protein through virus enters the host cell-human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, is also used as a target for molecular docking. The docking was done with most discussed drugs for SARS-CoV-2 like Ritonavir, Lopinavir, Remdesivir, Chloroquine, Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), routine antiviral drugs like Oseltamivir and Ribavirin. In addition, small molecules with anti-inflammatory actions like Mycophenolic acid (MPA), Pemirolast, Isoniazid and Eriodictyol were also tested. The generated data confirms the potential of Ritonavir, Lopinavir and Remdesivir as a therapeutic candidate against SARS-CoV-2. It is observed that Eriodictyol binds to almost all selected target proteins with good binding energy, suggesting its importance in treatment of COVID 19. Molecular interactions of Ritonavir, Lopinavir and Remdesivir against SARS-CoV-2 proteins enhanced their potential as a candidate drug for treatment of COVID-19.

There are no approved vaccines or treatments for use in humans; however, therapeutic treatment of both NiV and HeV infection in ferrets and nonhuman primates with a cross-reactive, neutralizing human monoclonal antibody (mAb), m102.4, targeting the G glycoprotein has been demonstrated. In a previous study, we isolated, characterized, and humanized a cross-reactive, neutralizing anti-F mAb (h5B3.1). The mAb h5B3.1 blocks the required F conformational change needed to facilitate membrane fusion and virus infection, and the epitope recognized by h5B3.1 has been structurally defined; however, the efficacy of h5B3.1 in vivo is unknown. METHODS: The postinfection antiviral activity of h5B3.1 was evaluated in vivo by administration in ferrets after NiV and HeV virus challenge.

Vitamin D has direct antiviral effects primarily against enveloped viruses, and coronavirus is an enveloped virus. The 2019 coronavirus disease had a high mortality rate and impacted the whole population of the planet, with severe acute respiratory syndrome the principal cause of death. Vitamin D can adequately modulate and regulate the immune and oxidative response to infection with COVID-19. The goal of this systematic review was thus to summarize and decide if there were a link between vitamin D status and COVID-19 infection and prognosis. METHODS: The protocol of this study is documented in the Prospero database and can be accessed with the protocol number CRD42020201283. PubMed and Google Scholar were used for a literature search from August 2020 to September 2020. We restricted the year of publication of reviewed articles to 2019–2020, and the selected language was English. Studies that used secondary data, feedback, or analysis of reviews were removed. To assess the standard of studies included, the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) method was used. RESULTS: Of the nine studies reviewed, seven (77.8%) showed that COVID-19 infection, prognosis, and mortality were correlated with vitamin D status. CONCLUSION: Most of the articles reviewed showed that blood vitamin D status can determine the risk of being infected with COVID-19, seriousness of COVID-19, and mortality from COVID-19. Therefore, maintaining appropriate levels of Vitamin D through supplementation or natural methods, eg, sunlight on the skin, is recommended for the public to be able to cope with the pandemic.","Yisak, Hiwot; Ewunetei, Amien; Kefale, Belayneh; Mamuye, Melkalem; Teshome, Fentaw; Ambaw, Birhanie; Yideg Yitbarek, Getachew",Risk Manag Healthc Policy,200,27

Dideoxy dehydrogenation of 2′,3′-sites can enhance antiviral efficiencies. Acyclic nucleosides and L-type nucleosides mainly represented antiviral capabilities. 5-F Substituted uracil analogues exihibit anti-tumor effects, and the substrates substituted by –I, –CF(3), bromovinyl group usually show antiviral activities. The sugar coupled with 1-N of triazolid usually displays anti-tumor efficiencies, while the sugar coupled with 2-N of triazolid mainly represents antiviral activities.

However, this racial category collapses several distinct ethnic groups with varying spatial distributions. Certain populations, such as Dominicans and Cubans, are concentrated in specific areas, compared to more dispersed groups such as Mexicans. Historical peculiarities have brought these populations into contact with specific types of environmental exposures. This paper takes a first step towards unraveling these diverse exposure profiles by estimating how exposure to particulate matter varies across demographic groups and narrows down which types of industries and chemicals are contributing the most to air toxins. Exposure to particulate matter is estimated for 72,271 census tracts in the continental US to evaluate how these exposures correlate with the proportion of the population classified within the four largest groups that make up the Hispanic population in the US: Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, and Dominican. Using linear mixed models, with the state nested within US Environmental Protection Agency regulatory region, and controls for population density, we find that the Dominican population is significantly less exposed to PM(2.5) and PM(10) compared to non-Hispanic Whites. Moreover, those tracts with a higher proportion of Cuban residents are significantly less exposed to PM(2.5). However, those tracts with a higher proportion of foreign-born, Mexicans, and Puerto Ricans had significantly higher levels of exposure to all sizes of particulate matter. We discuss the need to consider the chemical components of these particles to better understand the risk of exposure to air pollution.","Ard, Kerry; Fisher-Garibay, Dax; Bonner, Daphney",Int J Environ Res Public Health,200,5

The main question that infection prevention and control department is having these days is “Why have hospital-associated infections (HAIs) reduced during COVID-19 pandemic?” What is the one unique strategy that has brought decline in increasing HAIs? Would it be appropriate to say that rigorous hand hygiene practices among health care workers (HCWs) have reduced HAIs in a tertiary care hospital of Pakistan? This commentary is written to understand the effect of rigorous hand hygiene among HCWs on number of HAIs during COVID-19 pandemic. Given the seriousness of this outbreak, it was observed that the hand hygiene has occupied a new place of importance in the minds of HCWs. We observed 4 times increase in the consumption of hand sanitizers after COVID-19 outbreak. The increased consumption of hand sanitizers was reflected in improved hand hygiene practices. A reduction was observed in the number of HAIs after the COVID-19 outbreak, and we assume that the dip in HAIs is associated with the improvement in hand hygiene practices in the recent months. In the wake of COVID-19 pandemic, these trends reassure us that hand hygiene compliance by HCWs alone can be effective in reducing HAIs in a hospital setting.","Roshan, Rozina; Feroz, Anam Shahil; Rafique, Zohra; Virani, Nazleen",J Prim Care Community Health,200,10

Vaccines are ideal solutions to prevent infection, but treatments are also needed for those who have contracted the virus to limit negative outcomes, when vaccines are not applicable. Viruses must cross host cell membranes during their lifecycle, creating a dependency on processes involving membrane dynamics. Thus, in this study we examined whether the synthetic machinery for glycosphingolipids, biologically active components of cell membranes, can serve as a therapeutic target to combat SARS-CoV-2.

A loop disordered in the D614 S trimer wedges between domains within a protomer in the G614 spike. This added interaction appears to prevent premature dissociation of the G614 trimer, effectively increasing the number of functional spikes and enhancing infectivity.

Burnout, depression, anxiety and family support were assessed with the Maslach Burnout Inventory-General Survey, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the Family Support Scale respectively. In congruence with the first and fourth (partially) Hypotheses, burnout and perceived family support are significantly associated with some aspects of cognitive functioning. Moreover, in line with the third Hypothesis, perceived family support is inversely related to burnout.

In this study, the full-length sequences of two KAA isoforms, KAA-1 and KAA-2, were elucidated by a combination of peptide mapping and cDNA cloning. They consisted of four internal tandem-repeated domains, which are conserved in high-mannose specific lectins from lower organisms, including a cyanobacterium Oscillatoria agardhii and a red alga Eucheuma serra. Using an Escherichia coli expression system, an active recombinant form of KAA-1 (His-tagged rKAA-1) was successfully generated in the yield of 115 mg per a litter of culture. In a detailed oligosaccharide binding analysis by a centrifugal ultrafiltration-HPLC method with 27 pyridylaminated oligosaccharides, His-tagged rKAA-1 and rKAA-1 specifically bound to high-mannose N-glycans with an exposed α1-3 mannose in the D2 arm as the native lectin did. Predicted from oligosaccharide-binding specificity, a surface plasmon resonance analysis revealed that the recombinants exhibit strong interaction with gp120, a heavily glycosylated envelope glycoprotein of HIV with high association constants (1.48–1.61 × 10(9) M(−1)). Native KAAs and the recombinants inhibited the HIV-1 entry at IC(50)s of low nanomolar levels (7.3–12.9 nM). Thus, the recombinant proteins would be useful as antiviral reagents targeting the viral surface glycoproteins with high-mannose N-glycans, and the cultivated alga K. alvarezii could also be a good source of not only carrageenans but also this functional lectin(s).","Hirayama, Makoto; Shibata, Hiromi; Imamura, Koji; Sakaguchi, Takemasa; Hori, Kanji",Mar Biotechnol (NY),200,32

Over the years, the transfusion medicine discipline has evolved, and major progress has been achieved, despite some troublesome periods (for example, the tainted blood scandal, and—at the time being—the offending plasma market and the selling of human parts). Transfusion medicine has at all times implemented the rapidly developing biomedical technologies to secure blood components. The safety of blood components has now reached an exceptional level in economically wealthy countries, especially compared to other health care disciplines. Strengthening of the safety has mandated that blood donors and recipients are unrelated, an issue which has eased preservation and fractionation practices; blood is no longer arm-to-arm transfused and neither is whole blood, the commonest component.

We developed an agent-based simulation model to project the infection spread. The model utilizes COVID19-specific parameters and data from Georgia on population interactions and demographics. The simulation study covered a seven and a half-month period, testing different social distancing scenarios, including baselines (no-intervention or school closure only) and combinations of shelter-in-place and voluntary quarantine with different timelines and compliance levels. The following outcomes are compared at the state and community levels: the number and percentage of cumulative and daily new symptomatic and asymptomatic infections, hospitalizations, and deaths; COVID19-related demand for hospital beds, ICU beds, and ventilators. The results suggest that shelter-in-place followed by voluntary quarantine reduced peak infections from approximately 180K under no intervention and 113K under school closure, respectively, to below 53K, and delayed the peak from April to July or later. Increasing shelter-in-place duration from four to five weeks yielded 2–9% and 3–11% decrease in cumulative infection and deaths, respectively. Regardless of the shelter-in-place duration, increasing voluntary quarantine compliance decreased daily new infections from almost 53K to 25K, and decreased cumulative infections by about 50%. The cumulative number of deaths ranged from 6,660 to 19,430 under different scenarios. Peak infection date varied across scenarios and counties; on average, increasing shelter-in-place duration delayed the peak day by 6 days.

This study used microbiota high-throughput sequencing to compare the fecal microbial profile of healthy horses to that of geriatric microbial transplant recipients experiencing diarrhea and tested whether FMT restores microbiota diversity. METHODS: To evaluate the effect of environment and donor characteristics on the intestinal microbiota, fecal samples were collected per rectum from 15 healthy young-adult (2–12 years) and 15 geriatric (≥20 years) horses. Additionally, FMT was performed for 3 consecutive days in 5 geriatric horses with diarrhea using feces from the same healthy donor. Fecal samples were collected from both donor and recipient prior to each FMT and from recipients 24 hours following the last FMT. The profile of the fecal bacterial microbiota was compared using 16S amplicon sequencing. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to diet and farm location, age did not significantly affect the healthy equine fecal microbiota, indicating that both healthy geriatric and young-adult horses may serve as FMT donors. The fecal microbiota of horses with diarrhea was significantly more variable in terms of β-diversity than that of healthy horses. An inverse correlation between diarrhea score and relative abundance of Verrucomicrobia was identified in surviving FMT recipients. At study completion, the fecal microbiota of horses which responded to FMT had a higher α-diversity than prior to treatment and was phylogenetically more similar to that of the donor.","McKinney, Caroline A.; Oliveira, Bruno C.

As there is no prior study available, we evaluated these mental health outcomes and associated factors among the general population and healthcare professionals (HCPs) in Bangladesh. This nationwide cross-sectional study comprised 3388 individuals including 834 HCPs. The measures included socio-demographics, healthcare, and patient-care related information, the Bangla Patient Health Questionnaire, and the Bangla Fear of COVID-19 Scale. Multiple linear regression analyses were performed to identify risk factors. Just over one-quarter of the participants were depressed, and was significantly associated with COVID-19 fear. Regression analyses showed that, both in general population and HCPs, depression and fear of COVID-19 were strongly predicted by being female; however, depression was inversely associated with being married. Particularly, among the HCPs, being restless while examining a patient with flu-like symptoms and while examining a patient returning from abroad was found to be significant predictor for both depression and fear of COVID-19. HCPs who were using single protective equipment for a week had greater depression and those who felt insecure due to the pandemic had a high level of COVID-19 fear. The findings identified major psychological impacts among the participants, suggesting the urgent need to promote mental wellbeing in both general population and medical professionals.","Sakib, Najmuj; Akter, Tahmina; Zohra, Fatematuz; Bhuiyan, A.

Traditional models of care have shown a gender bias, with women less often referred and recommended for surgery than men. This study sought to understand if patient gender affects access to care in the clinical encounter with the advanced practice provider. Our objectives were: (1) To determine if a gender difference exists in the clinical decision to offer a consultation with a surgeon; (2) To determine if a gender difference exists in patients’ decisions to accept a consultation with a surgeon among those patients to whom it is offered; and, (3) To describe patients’ reasons for not accepting a consultation with a surgeon. METHODS: This was a prospective study of 815 patients presenting to a tertiary care centre for assessment of hip and knee arthritis, with referral onward to an orthopaedic surgeon when indicated. We performed a multiple logistic regression analysis adjusting for severity to address the first objective and a simple logistic regression analysis to answer the second objective. Reasons for not accepting a surgical consultation were obtained by questionnaire. RESULTS: Eight hundred and fifteen patients (511 women, 304 men) fulfilled study eligibility criteria. There was no difference in the probability of being referred to a surgeon for men and women (difference adjusted for severity = − 0.02, 95% CI: − 0.07, 0.02). Neither was there a difference in the acceptance of a referral for men and women (difference = − 0.05, 95% CI: − 0.09, 0.00). Of the 14 reasons for declining a surgical consultation, 5 showed a difference with more women than men indicating a preference for non-surgical treatment along with fears/concerns about surgery. CONCLUSIONS: There is no strong evidence to suggest there is a difference in proportion of males and females proceeding to surgical consultation in the model of care that utilizes advanced practice orthopaedic providers in triage. This study adds to the evidence that supports the use of suitably trained alternate providers in roles that reduce wait times to care and add value in contexts where health human resources are limited. The care model is a viable strategy to assist in managing the growing backlog in orthopaedic care, recently exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Most patients with COVID-19 have a mild course of the disease. However, approximately 20% develop severe illness with a high mortality rate which is associated with age, comorbidities, and immunosuppression. Epidemiological studies are used to reveal the extent of viral spread in homes, communities, and hospitals. Thus, preventive and control measures can be established by the authorities. Objective In this study, patients with suspect COVID-19 symptoms who search for hospital care at the city of Sao José do Rio Preto (Sao Paulo, Brazil) were monitored, in order to identify the first case of this new disease in the region. In the first two months (March and April), more than 3000 individuals looked for the public and private health system with suspected respiratory symptoms, but only 164 (8.4%) were COVID-19 confirmed. Results From those, males (56.1%) and patients of the age distribution of 16-59 (91.2%), with diarrhea (22.2%), runny nose (25%), altered taste (15.9%), and anosmia (11.6%) presented statistical significance, although none comorbidities were related with COVID-19 occurrence. The odds ratio analysis supports this finding.

Based on next-generation sequencing, we previously demonstrated that Lnc45 was distinctively stimulated by H5N1 influenza virus in mice. In this study, we systematically investigated the specific role of Lnc45 during influenza A virus (IAV) infection. Through qRT-PCR, we first demonstrated that Lnc45 is highly up-regulated by different subtypes of IAV strains, including H5N1, H7N9, and H1N1 viruses. Using RNA-FISH and qRT-PCR, we then found that Lnc45 can translocate from nuclear to cytoplasm during H5N1 virus infection. In addition, forced Lnc45 expression dramatically impeded viral replication of H1N1, H5N1, and H7N9 virus, while abolish of Lnc45 expression by RNA interference favored replication of these viruses, highlighting the potential broad antiviral activity of Lnc45 to IAV. Correspondingly, overexpression of Lnc45 inhibited viral polymerase activity and suppressed IAV-induced cell apoptosis. Moreover, Lnc45 significantly restrained nuclear aggregation of viral NP and PA proteins during H5N1 virus infection. Further functional study revealed that the stem ring arms of Lnc45 mainly mediated the antiviral effect. Therefore, we here demonstrated that Lnc45 functions as a broad-spectrum antiviral factor to inhibit influenza virus replication probably through inhibiting polymerase activity and NP and PA nuclear accumulation via its stem ring arms. Our study not only advances our understanding of the complexity of the IAV pathogenesis but also lays the foundation for developing novel anti-IAV therapeutics targeting the host lncRNA.","Zhang, Lei; Zheng, Xinxin; Li, Jun; Wang, Guoqing; Hu, Zenglei; Chen, Yu; Wang, Xiaoquan; Gu, Min; Gao, Ruyi; Hu, Shunlin; Liu, Xiaowen; Jiao, Xinan; Peng, Daxin; Hu, Jiao; Liu, Xiufan",Virulence,200,16

The uncertain future of the pandemic is compounded by limited data on the ability of the responsible virus, SARS-CoV-2, to survive across various climates, preventing epidemiologists from accurately modeling its spread. However, a detailed thermodynamic analysis of experimental data on the inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 and related coronaviruses can enable a fundamental understanding of their thermal degradation that will help model the COVID-19 pandemic and mitigate future outbreaks. This work introduces a thermodynamic model that synthesizes existing data into an analytical framework built on first principles, including the rate law for a first-order reaction and the Arrhenius equation, to accurately predict the temperature-dependent inactivation of coronaviruses. The model provides much-needed thermal decontamination guidelines for personal protective equipment, including masks. For example, at 70 °C, a 3-log (99.9%) reduction in virus concentration can be achieved, on average, in 3 min (under the same conditions, a more conservative decontamination time of 39 min represents the upper limit of a 95% interval) and can be performed in most home ovens without reducing the efficacy of typical N95 masks as shown in recent experimental reports. This model will also allow for epidemiologists to incorporate the lifetime of SARS-CoV-2 as a continuous function of environmental temperature into models forecasting the spread of the pandemic across different climates and seasons.","Yap, Te Faye; Liu, Zhen; Shveda, Rachel A.; Preston, Daniel J.",Appl Phys Lett,200,27

The identified epitopes, each one of nine amino acids, have high sequence similarity to the equivalent epitopes of SARS-CoV virus, which are known to elicit an effective T cell response in vitro.

In particular, we mainly focus on the effect of time delay on the formation of spatial pattern. Through mathematical analysis, we gain the conditions for Hopf bifurcation and Turing bifurcation, and find exact Turing space in parameter space. Furthermore, numerical results show that time delay has a significant effect on pattern formation.

Within the body, assessment of the arterial partial pressure of CO(2) (PaCO(2)) has been the gold standard for many decades. Non-invasive assessments are usually predicated on the measurement of CO(2) concentrations in the air, usually using an infrared analyzer, and these data are clearly important regarding climate changes as well as regulations of air quality in buildings to ascertain adequate ventilation. Measurements of CO(2) production with oxygen consumption yield important indices such as the respiratory quotient and estimates of energy expenditure, which may be used for further investigation in the various fields of metabolism, obesity, sleep disorders, and lifestyle-related issues. Measures of PaCO(2) are nowadays performed using the Severinghaus electrode in arterial blood or in arterialized capillary blood, while the same electrode system has been modified to enable relatively accurate non-invasive monitoring of the transcutaneous partial pressure of CO(2) (PtcCO(2)). PtcCO(2) monitoring during sleep can be helpful for evaluating sleep apnea syndrome, particularly in children. End-tidal PCO(2) is inferior to PtcCO(2) as far as accuracy, but it provides breath-by-breath estimates of respiratory gas exchange, while PtcCO(2) reflects temporal trends in alveolar ventilation.

Little is known, however, about how the events during this time have affected the day-to-day experiences and concerns of American Jews. Using repeated cross-sectional data from surveys of Jewish young adults who applied to Birthright Israel, this paper analyzes recent trends in Jewish young adults’ experiences and perceptions of antisemitism. Despite the high-profile incidents during this period, there is no evidence of a major increase in experiences of antisemitic harassment among Jewish young adults—either on or off campus—between 2017 and 2019. At the same time, data show a substantial increase in concerns among young Jews about antisemitism in the United States and on college campuses, with concerns about antisemitism in the United States (but not on campus) being especially concentrated among liberal Jews. These results suggest that Jewish concerns about antisemitism are linked to broader views about the climate for marginalized populations in the United States. They also point to growing Jewish anxieties over violence, safety, and acceptance in the United States. In an era of widely disseminated antisemitic conspiracy theories, even young Jews who have no first-hand experience of antisemitic harassment have become concerned.

FIV-infected animals had significantly lower AGP concentrations, and significantly greater Hp concentrations than non-FIV-infected cats when infected with CMhm and Mhf, respectively. Both CMhm and Mhf infection were associated with significant increases in SAA concentrations, while AGP concentrations were only significantly increased by Mhf infection.

We wished to study the transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in this closed population. METHODS: A basic susceptible, exposed, infected, and removed (SEIR) compartmental model was developed using the daily stepwise approach in Microsoft Excel. An advanced model using standard differential equations in Python software version 3.6 was used to estimate R(0) based on model fit to actual data. RESULTS: Forty-eight SARS-CoV-2 infections were found among the 474 quarantined individuals. Out of these, 44 (92%) were asymptomatic. R(0) for the overall duration was found to be 2.29 (95% CI: 1.84–2.78). Male gender and age ≥ 60 years were associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection (RR = 4.33, 95% CI: 2.07–9.05 and 5.32, 95% CI: 3.13–9.04, respectively). Isolation of infected individuals and stricter quarantine of remaining individuals reduced the R(0) from 2.41 initially to 1.17 subsequently. CONCLUSION: R(0) value was found comparable to the earlier studies indicating similar transmission dynamics among quarantined individuals in India. Universal testing and prompt isolation of infected individuals reduced the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Smaller group sizes should be preferred to large groups during facility-based quarantine in evacuation situations. The role of asymptomatic individuals appears to be strong in SARS-CoV-2 transmission within closed populations.","Saurabh, Suman; Kumar, Ritesh; Kumar, Nitesh; Bhardwaj, Pankaj; Nag, Vijaya Lakshmi; Garg, Mahendra Kumar; Misra, Sanjeev",Disaster medicine and public health preparedness,200,16

Despite the strategically crucial role that openness decision plays for Internet platform enterprises, the results of existing research on the relationship between platform openness and platform performance are not conclusive. As to the nature of platform, its transaction attribute has been overemphasized while its innovation attribute is mostly neglected. Through decomposing platform openness into supply-side openness and demand-side openness, as well as introducing demand diversity and knowledge complexity as contextual variables, this study attempts to understand the impact of both types of attributes on performance by considering their configuration. Using fuzzy sets qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) method, we find that high demand diversity of platform users and high supply-side openness will lead to better platform performance. Moreover, the high knowledge complexity required for platform innovation together with high supply-side and demand-side openness will contribute to a high level of platform performance.","Wang, Jiexiang; Guo, Bin; Wang, Xiaoyan; Lou, Shuzhen",Electron Commer Res Appl,200,32

We assess whether the ensuing reduction in social contacts led to increased loneliness among older adults (60+). METHODS: Three analyses were conducted: (1) A comparison between pre-pandemic (SHARE: 2013-2017) and pandemic (May 2020) levels of loneliness (UCLA-3 scale), (2) an assessment of the cross-sectional correlation between being affected by COVID-19 restriction measures and loneliness (May 2020), and (3) a longitudinal analysis of weekly changes (March-June 2020) in loneliness (Corona panel). RESULTS: We found (1) increased loneliness in 2020 compared with previous years, (2) a moderate positive association between the number of restriction measures older adults were affected from and their loneliness, and (3) that loneliness was higher during ’lockdown’ compared to the subsequent re-opening phase, particularly among those who live alone. CONCLUSION: We provide evidence that COVID-19 restriction measures in Austria have indeed resulted in increased levels of loneliness among older adults. However, these effects seem to be short-lived, and thus no strong negative consequences for older adults’ mental health are expected. Nonetheless, the effects on loneliness, and subsequent mental health issues, might be both more long-lasting and severe if future restriction measures are enacted repeatedly and/or over longer time periods.","Stolz, Erwin; Mayerl, Hannes; Freidl, Wolfgang",Eur J Public Health,200,30

PRCV, a spike (S) gene deletion mutant of TGEV with an altered respiratory tissue tropism, causes mild or subclinical respiratory infections. Comparisons of TGEV and PRCV strains suggest that tropism and pathogenicity are influenced by the S gene and ORF3, respectively. Recently, outbreaks of TGE of reduced virulence were reported in the field. We investigated a similar suspect TGEV outbreak of reduced virulence in nursery pigs from a swine herd in the Midwest. A TGEV strain (BW021898B) was isolated in swine testicular cells from gut contents of a diarrheic pig and three PRCV strains (BW126, BW154, BW155) were isolated from nasal swabs from normal TGEV-seronegative sentinel pigs in contact with the diarrheic pigs. Sequence analysis of the TGEV isolate in the partial S gene and ORF3/3a and ORF3-1/3b revealed high homology with enteropathogenic TGEV strains. Gnotobiotic pig inoculation and histopathological results revealed that this TGEV isolate retained virulence even though in the field outbreak the diarrheal disease was of reduced severity. Sequence analysis of the S gene deletion region of the three PRCV isolates revealed identical deletions between nt 105–752, which differ from deletions previously reported among PRCV strains. The three PRCV isolates had variable sequence changes in ORF 3/3a and ORF 3-1/3b, affecting the ORF size and amino acid sequence. Thus, sequence analysis and pathogenicity studies indicate that this TGEV isolate resembles other enteropathogenic TGEV strains. Therefore, the reduced severity of TGE observed in this herd may be due to the ongoing PRCV infections, which induce antibodies cross-reactive with TGEV and result in decreased disease severity. The results outlined in this study highlight the need to monitor the molecular epidemiology of TGEV/PRCV strains with sensitive differential diagnostic assays, followed by sequence analysis of the critical regions to identify changes and pathogenicity studies to confirm the disease potential of the TGEV isolates.","Kim, L.; Hayes, J.; Lewis, P.; Parwani, A.

However, very few studies have tested these three factors together within an integrated causal model. Therefore, the present study aimed to examine the determinants that influence the perceived risk in cases of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), a deadly epidemic disease, in Korea. Based on the theoretical model, we analyzed the survey data collected from respondents (N = 814) in Korea. After controlling for variables such as sociodemographic characteristics, we examined how three competing factors, i.e., value, perception, and resource, influence the perceived risk of MERS.

Early data from COVID-19 patients as well as previous studies from severe acute respiratory syndrome, Middle East respiratory syndrome, and other respiratory disorders show that the extent of lung fibrosis is associated with a higher mortality, prolonged ventilator dependence, and poorer long-term health prognosis. Current treatments to halt or reverse lung fibrosis are limited; thus, the rapid development of effective antifibrotic therapies is a major global medical need that will continue far beyond the current COVID-19 pandemic. Reproducible fibrosis screening assays with high signal-to-noise ratios and disease-relevant readouts such as extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition (the hallmark of fibrosis) are integral to any antifibrotic therapeutic development. Therefore, we have established an automated high-throughput and high-content primary screening assay measuring transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ)-induced ECM deposition from primary human lung fibroblasts in a 384-well format. This assay combines longitudinal live cell imaging with multiparametric high-content analysis of ECM deposition. Using this assay, we have screened a library of 2743 small molecules representing approved drugs and late-stage clinical candidates. Confirmed hits were subsequently profiled through a suite of secondary lung fibroblast phenotypic screening assays quantifying cell differentiation, proliferation, migration, and apoptosis. In silico target prediction and pathway network analysis were applied to the confirmed hits.

This language uses models, particularly of bonding, that are not contained in the quantum mechanical description of chemical systems, but has been used to derive machine-readable formats for storing and manipulating chemical structures in digital computers. This language is fuzzy and varies from chemist to chemist but has been astonishingly successful and perhaps contributes with its fuzziness to the success of chemistry. It is this creative imagination of chemical structures that has been fundamental to the cognition of chemistry and has allowed thought experiments to take place. Within the everyday language, the model nature of these concepts is not always clear to practicing chemists, so that controversial discussions about the merits of alternative models often arise. However, the extensive use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in chemistry, with the aim of being able to make reliable predictions, will require that these models be extended to cover all relevant properties and characteristics of chemical systems. This, in turn, imposes conditions such as completeness, compactness, computational efficiency and non-redundancy on the extensions to the almost universal Lewis and VSEPR bonding models. Thus, AI and ML are likely to be important in rationalizing, extending and standardizing chemical bonding models. This will not affect the everyday language of chemistry but may help to understand the unique basis of chemical language.","Clark, Timothy; Hicks, Martin G",Beilstein J Org Chem,200,20

These are exceptionally hazardous for long-term use because of their possible unfavourable impacts. Subsequently, in the ebb-and-flow decade, analysts and researchers are engaged in developing new anti-inflammatory drugs, and many such agents are in the later phases of clinical trials. Molecules with heterocyclic nuclei are similar to various natural antecedents, thus acquiring immense consideration from scientific experts and researchers. The arguably most adaptable heterocyclic cores are benzimidazoles containing nitrogen in a bicyclic scaffold. Numerous benzimidazole drugs are broadly used in the treatment of numerous diseases, showing promising therapeutic potential. Benzimidazole derivatives exert anti-inflammatory effects mainly by interacting with transient receptor potential vanilloid-1, cannabinoid receptors, bradykinin receptors, specific cytokines, 5-lipoxygenase activating protein and cyclooxygenase. Literature on structure-activity relationship (SAR) and investigations of benzimidazoles highlight that the substituent's tendency and position on the benzimidazole ring significantly contribute to the anti-inflammatory activity. Reported SAR analyses indicate that substitution at the N1, C2, C5 and C6 positions of the benzimidazole scaffold greatly influence the anti-inflammatory activity. For example, benzimidazole substituted with anacardic acid on C2 inhibits COX-2, and 5-carboxamide or sulfamoyl or sulfonyl benzimidazole antagonises the cannabinoid receptor, whereas the C2 diarylamine and C3 carboxamide substitution of the benzimidazole scaffold result in antagonism of the bradykinin receptor. In this review, we examine the insights regarding the SARs of anti-inflammatory benzimidazole compounds, which will be helpful for researchers in designing and developing potential anti-inflammatory drugs to target inflammation-promoting enzymes.","Veerasamy, Ravichandran; Roy, Anitha; Karunakaran, Rohini; Rajak, Harish",Pharmaceuticals,200,10

The disease is associated with amyloid beta (Aβ) peptide aggregation forming initial clusters and then fibril structure and plaques. Other neurodegenerative diseases such as type 2 diabetes, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Parkinson’s disease follow a similar mechanism. Therefore, inhibition of Aβ aggregation is considered an effective way to prevent AD. Recent experiments have provided evidence that oligomers are more toxic agents than mature fibrils, prompting researchers to investigate various factors that may influence their properties. One of these factors is nanomechanical stability, which plays an important role in the self-assembly of Aβ and possibly other proteins. This stability is also likely to be related to cell toxicity. In this work, we compare the mechanical stability of Aβ-tetramers and fibrillar structures using a structure-based coarse-grained (CG) approach and all-atom molecular dynamics simulation. Our results support the evidence for an increase in mechanical stability during the Aβ fibrillization process, which is consistent with in vitro AFM characterization of Aβ(42) oligomers. Namely, using a CG model, we showed that the Young modulus of tetramers is lower than that of fibrils and, as follows from the experiment, is about 1 GPa. Hydrogen bonds are the dominant contribution to the detachment of one chain from the Aβ fibril fragment. They tend to be more organized along the pulling direction, whereas in the Aβ tetramers no preference is observed.","Poma, Adolfo B.; Thu, Tran Thi Minh; Tri, Lam Tang Minh; Nguyen, Hoang Linh; Li, Mai Suan",J Phys Chem B,200,20

The 254 nm emission of low-pressure vacuum lamps is known for its antimicrobial effect, but unfortunately, this radiation is also harmful to human cells. Some researchers published reports that short-wavelength ultraviolet light in the spectral region of 200–230 nm (far-UVC) should inactivate pathogens without harming human cells, which might be very helpful in many applications. Methods: A literature search on the impact of far-UVC radiation on pathogens, cells, skin and eyes was performed and median log-reduction doses for different pathogens and wavelengths were calculated. Observed damage to cells, skin and eyes was collected and presented in standardized form. Results: More than 100 papers on far-UVC disinfection, published within the last 100 years, were found. Far-UVC radiation, especially the 222 nm emission of KrCl excimer lamps, exhibits strong antimicrobial properties. The average necessary log-reduction doses are 1.3 times higher than with 254 nm irradiation. A dose of 100 mJ/cm(2) reduces all pathogens by several orders of magnitude without harming human cells, if optical filters block emissions above 230 nm. Conclusion: The approach is very promising, especially for temporary applications, but the data is still sparse. Investigations with high far-UVC doses over a longer period of time have not yet been carried out, and there is no positive study on the impact of this radiation on human eyes. Additionally, far-UVC sources are unavailable in larger quantities. Therefore, this is not a short-term solution for the current pandemic, but may be suitable for future technological approaches for decontamination in rooms in the presence of people or for antisepsis.","Hessling, Martin; Haag, Robin; Sieber, Nicole; Vatter, Petra",GMS Hyg Infect Control,200,3

The rapid spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2 to almost every country on the globe and the failure to contain the infections have contributed to fear and panic worldwide. The lack of available and efficient antiviral drugs or vaccines has further worsened the situation. For these reasons, it cannot be overstated that an accelerated effort for the development of novel drugs and vaccines is needed. In this context, novel approaches in both gene therapy and vaccine development are essential. Previous experience from SARS- and MERS-coronavirus vaccine and drug development projects have targeted glycoprotein epitopes, monoclonal antibodies, angiotensin receptor blockers and gene silencing technologies, which may be useful for COVID-19 too. Moreover, existing antivirals used for other types of viral infections have been considered as urgent action is necessary. This review aims at providing a background of coronavirus genetics and biology, examples of therapeutic and vaccine strategies taken and potential innovative novel approaches in progress.","Lundstrom, Kenneth",Biomedicines,200,20

The presence of this anastomotic communication may play a pathophysiological role in a patient with a right dominant coronary circulation and an underlying coronary artery disease (CAD) affecting the right coronary system. Understanding the existence and significance of Kugel’s artery and the anastomotic network cannot be overemphasized. The presence of an anomalous vascular connection bypassing an area of epicardial vessel occlusion may be a lifesaving pathophysiological finding that maintains myocardial perfusion and viability.

The increasing spillover of new diseases from wildlife is being driven by wide-scale anthropogenic changes allowing for more frequent and closer wildlife-human and wildlife-livestock contacts. An increasing number of epidemics in livestock are associated with rapid transition of livestock systems from extensive to intensive, and local to global movement of livestock and their products through value chain networks with weak biosecurity. Major livestock epidemics in the past two decades have had substantial economic impacts, and the COVID-19 pandemic highlights the devastating socio-economic consequences that spillovers can have when not identified and controlled early in the process of emergence. This highlights the importance of Veterinary Services to integrated, whole-of-society efforts to control infectious diseases in animals. Emphasis within Veterinary Services must be placed on prevention and preparedness. The authors suggest four areas for continued improvement in Veterinary Services to meet this challenge. These are a) continued development of staff capacity for risk assessment and value chain analysis, together with improved policies and communication, b) appropriate adaptation of approaches to prevention and control in resource-poor settings, c) improved multi-sectoral and transboundary cooperation, which enables the sharing of resources and expertise, and d) systematic approaches that enable Veterinary Services to influence decisionmaking for trade, markets, business, public health, and livelihood development at the national and regional levels.","Jost, C C; Machalaba, C; Karesh, W B; Mcdermott, J J; Beltran-Alcrudo, D; Bett, B; Tago, D; Wongsathapornchai, K; Plee, L; Dhingra, M S; Pfeiffer, D U",Rev Sci Tech,200,1

Methods: This retrospective study included 582 adult patients admitted to 9 dedicated COVID-19 hospitals as of July 30, 2020 (72% of all hospitalizations). Data were abstracted from medical charts. Factors associated with mortality were evaluated in multivariable Poisson regression analysis. Results: Among 582 adults included in this analysis 14.9% were 65+ years old, 49.1% were women, 59.3% had uni- or bi-lateral lung involvement on chest computed tomography, 27.1% had any co-morbidity, 13.2% patients had lymphopenia, 4.1% had neutophilosis, 4.8% had low platelet count, 37.6% had d-dimer levels of >0.5 mcg/l. Overall mortality was 2.1% (12/582). After excluding mild infections, mortality among patients with moderate-to-critical disease was 3.0% (12/399), while among patients with severe-to-critical disease mortality was 12.7% (8/63).

This rapid and unexpected event had enormous implications for infection preventionists (IP) internationally. Lessons learned from this event should guide future pandemic planning efforts. METHODS: Focus groups were conducted at the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology, Inc, (APIC) 2009 conference to evaluate IPs' experience with the novel H1N1 influenza pandemic and assess their perceived needs related to novel H1N1 topics and products required for future education and reference materials. RESULTS: Forty IPs (37 from the United States and 3 international) participated in the focus groups. Needed reference materials identified by attendees included infection prevention guidance for nonacute care settings; occupational health polices; and brief, multilanguage patient/family educational materials. Educational topics on which IPs need to be trained include isolation precautions/personal protective equipment recommendations for novel H1N1 patients, coordination between hospitals and community response agencies, and surge management. The rapidly changing and conflicting recommendations related to patient management made responding to this event challenging. IPs require synthesized infection prevention guidelines developed in a concise, real-time format.

Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) is the noninvasive reference standard for cardiac function, structure, and tissue composition. CMR is a potentially valuable diagnostic tool in patients with COVID-19 presenting with myocardial injury and evidence of cardiac dysfunction. Although COVID-19–related myocarditis is likely infrequent, COVID-19–related cardiovascular histopathology findings have been reported in up to 48% of patients, raising the concern for long-term myocardial injury. Studies to date report CMR abnormalities in 26% to 60% of hospitalized patients who have recovered from COVID-19, including functional impairment, myocardial tissue abnormalities, late gadolinium enhancement, or pericardial abnormalities. In athletes post–COVID-19, CMR has detected myocarditis-like abnormalities. In children, multisystem inflammatory syndrome may occur 2 to 6 weeks after infection; associated myocarditis and coronary artery aneurysms are evaluable by CMR. At this time, our understanding of COVID-19–related cardiovascular involvement is incomplete, and multiple studies are planned to evaluate patients with COVID-19 using CMR.

Given the importance of disaster nursing training programmes, understanding how well prepared hospital nurses are to provide disaster care is vital. OBJECTIVES: This paper analyses the perceived readiness of hospital nurses for a disaster response and the factors influencing their report for work outside the hospital environment. DESIGN: A cross-sectional research design was used. SETTINGS: This study was conducted at a military hospital in Taiwan. PARTICIPANTS: A sample of 311 registered nurses participated in this study. METHODS: Data were collected on readiness for disaster responses using a 40-item researcher-designed, self-administered questionnaire found to have satisfactory reliability and validity. The questionnaire has four domains: personal preparation (16 items), self-protection (11 items), emergency response (6 items), and clinical management (7 items). Data were analysed using descriptive statistics, independent t-tests and generalised linear models. RESULTS: The majority of hospital nurses demonstrated poor readiness for disaster responses. Scores on the four domains were most associated with nurses' disaster-related training, experience in disaster response and emergency/intensive care experience. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that disaster-related training should be included in undergraduate programmes and continuing education courses to help hospital nurses recognise and improve their own readiness for disaster responses outside the hospital environment. Future research is needed to improve hospital nurses' disaster-response readiness in Taiwan and other countries.","Tzeng, Wen-Chii; Feng, Hsin-Pei; Cheng, Wei-Tung; Lin, Chia-Huei; Chiang, Li-Chi; Pai, Lu; Lee, Chun-Lan",Nurse Educ Today,200,15

Thus far, sensitivity (≤ 85%) of lateral-flow assays has limited scale-up. Conceivably, microfluidic immunofluorescence Ag-RDTs could increase sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2 detection. METHODS: This multi-centre diagnostic accuracy study investigated performance of the microfluidic immunofluorescence LumiraDx™ assay, enrolling symptomatic and asymptomatic participants with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. Participants collected a supervised nasal mid-turbinate (NMT) self-swab for Ag-RDT testing, in addition to a professionally collected nasopharyngeal (NP) swab for routine testing with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Results were compared to calculate sensitivity and specificity. Sub-analyses investigated the results by viral load, symptom presence and duration. An analytical study assessed exclusivity and limit-of-detection (LOD). In addition, we evaluated ease-of-use. RESULTS: The study was conducted between November 2nd 2020 and 4th of December 2020. 761 participants were enrolled, with 486 participants reporting symptoms on testing day. 120 out of 146 RT-PCR positive cases were detected positive by LumiraDx™, resulting in a sensitivity of 82.2% (95% CI 75.2–87.5%). Specificity was 99.3% (CI 98.3–99.7%). Sensitivity was increased in individuals with viral load ≥ 7 log10 SARS-CoV2 RNA copies/ml (93.8%; CI 86.2–97.3%). Testing against common respiratory commensals and pathogens showed no cross-reactivity and LOD was estimated to be 2–56 PFU/mL.

We used the General Health Questionnaire and the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale to measure mental health outcomes. To address the first aim we calculated differences (Student's t test for paired samples) and correlations (Pearson's r coefficient). To address the second aim we used fixed effects model by means of a multilevel approach, a linear model that considers dependency in the data.Results: Self-perceived job performance deteriorated across time. From the first measurement to the four-month follow-up, more health care workers presented common mental disorders (40% vs 45.57%), depression, and/or anxiety (52.46% vs 62.62%). A meaningful worsening of mental health was observed in healthcare workers who expressed concern about being infected with COVID-19, whether asymptomatic (greater general discomfort and psychological distress) or symptomatic (greater general discomfort). Likewise, there were significant interactions between a history of mental disorder and concern about COVID-19 infection.Conclusions: Among healthcare workers, the uncertainty about the COVID-19 infection may have larger negative mental health impacts than actually being infected.","López Steinmetz, Lorena Cecilia; Herrera, Carla Romina; Fong, Shao Bing; Godoy, Juan Carlos",Psychiatry,200,1

We first illustrate how to automatically “classify”, according to the most well-known uncertainty frameworks, any given qualitative uncertainty assessment. Then, we show how to compute an enlargement of the assessment, to any other new inference target.","Capotorti, Andrea; Formisano, Andrea",Modern Information Processing,200,21

Herein, we report the case of a 43-years-old man with a strong clinical suspicion of COVID-19, who resulted in being negative to multiple severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RT-PCR tests performed on different oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal swabs, despite serology having confirmed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 IgM. The patient underwent a chest computed tomography (CT) that showed typical imaging findings of COVID-19 pneumonia. The presence of viral SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed only by performing a SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test on stool. Performing of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test on fecal samples can be a rapid and useful approach to confirm COVID-19 diagnosis in cases where there is an apparent discrepancy between COVID-19 clinical symptoms coupled with chest CT and SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests’ results on samples from the upper respiratory tract.","Brogna, Barbara; Brogna, Carlo; Petrillo, Mauro; Conte, Adriana Modestina; Benincasa, Giulio; Montano, Luigi; Piscopo, Marina",Medicina (Kaunas),200,3

We report a method of generating a “mobility-index” and a “stay-at-home/resting-index” based on aggregated anonymous Call Detail Records of almost all subscribers in Hungary, which tracks all phones, examining their strengths and weaknesses, comparing it with Community Mobility Reports from Google, limited to smartphone data. The impact of policy changes, such as school closures, could be identified with sufficient granularity to capture a rush to shops prior to imposition of restrictions. Anecdotal reports of large scale movement of Hungarians to holiday homes were confirmed. At the national level, our results correlated well with Google mobility data, but there were some differences at weekends and national holidays, which can be explained by methodological differences. Mobile phones offer a means to analyse population movement but there are several technical and privacy issues. Overcoming these, our method is a practical and inexpensive way forward, achieving high levels of accuracy and resolution, especially where uptake of smartphones is modest, although it is not an alternative to smartphone-based solutions used for contact tracing and quarantine monitoring.","Szocska, Miklos; Pollner, Peter; Schiszler, Istvan; Joo, Tamas; Palicz, Tamas; McKee, Martin; Asztalos, Aron; Bencze, Laszlo; Kapronczay, Mor; Petrecz, Peter; Toth, Benedek; Szabo, Adam; Weninger, Attila; Ader, Krisztian; Bacskai, Peter; Karaszi, Peter; Terplan, Gyozo; Tuboly, Gabor; Sohonyai, Adam; Szoke, Jozsef; Toth, Adam; Gaal, Peter",Sci Rep,200,18

Research related to this disease is pivotal for assessing pathogenic characteristics and formulating therapeutic strategies. The aim of this paper is to explore the activity and trends of COVID-19 research since its outbreak in December 2019. Methods: We explored the PubMed database and the World Health Organization (WHO) database for publications pertaining to COVID-19 since December 2019 up until March 18, 2020. Only relevant observational and interventional studies were included in our study. Data on COVID-19 incidence were extracted from the WHO situation reports. Research output was assessed with respect to gross domestic product (GDP) and population of each country. Results: Only 564 publications met our inclusion criteria. These articles came from 39 different countries, constituting 24% of all affected countries. China produced the greatest number of publications with 377 publications (67%). With respect to continental research activity, Asian countries had the highest research activity with 434 original publications (77%). In terms of publications per million persons (PPMPs), Singapore had the highest number of publications with 1.069 PPMPs. In terms of publications per billion-dollar GDP, Mauritius ranked first with 0.075. Conclusion: COVID-19 is a major disease that has impacted international public health on a global level.

Here, we present the first Italian longitudinal study on sleep and COVID-19 considering four different time points collected during lockdown (from 29 March 2020 to 3 May 2020) and a subsequent follow-up period (October 2020). We used an online survey to collect socio-demographic and COVID-19 related information. Subjects were also asked to complete a sleep diary at each time point of the study. Our longitudinal sample included 147 participants. Statistical comparison across time intervals showed remarkable changes in sleep patterns during and after the lockdown. In particular, during lockdown we observed longer sleep latency, less ease of falling asleep, a higher total bedtime, and a lower dream frequency. The week-by-week evaluation described relatively stable patterns in the observed measures during the lockdown period, except for dream frequency, affected by a rapid increase in the early phase of lockdown. Our findings are in line with the current literature. Furthermore, the prospective longitudinal investigation comprising several time points offered the possibility of (a) observing the temporal dynamics and the different entities of such changes over time, and (b) reducing the typical memory bias for these studies.","Alfonsi, Valentina; Gorgoni, Maurizio; Scarpelli, Serena; Zivi, Pierpaolo; Sdoia, Stefano; Mari, Emanuela; Quaglieri, Alessandro; Ferlazzo, Fabio; Giannini, Anna Maria; De Gennaro, Luigi",J Sleep Res,200,24

However, in resource constrained environments the clinical utility of such data-driven predictive tools may be limited by the cost or unavailability of certain laboratory tests. We leveraged EHR data to develop an ML-based tool for predicting adverse outcomes that optimizes clinical utility under a given cost structure. We further gained insights into the decision-making process of the ML models through an explainable AI tool. This cohort study was performed using deidentified EHR data from COVID-19 patients from ProMedica Health System in northwest Ohio and southeastern Michigan. We tested the performance of various ML approaches for predicting either increasing ventilatory support or mortality. We performed post hoc analysis to obtain optimal feature sets under various budget constraints. We demonstrate that it is possible to achieve a significant reduction in cost at the expense of a small reduction in predictive performance. For example, when predicting ventilation, it is possible to achieve a 43% reduction in cost with only a 3% reduction in performance. Similarly, when predicting mortality, it is possible to achieve a 50% reduction in cost with only a 1% reduction in performance.

It is not known whether sex hormones contribute to this predisposition. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association of concentrations of serum testosterone, estradiol, and insulinlike growth factor 1 (IGF-1, concentrations of which are regulated by sex hormone signaling) with COVID-19 severity. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This prospective cohort study was conducted using serum samples collected from consecutive patients who presented from March through May 2020 to the Barnes Jewish Hospital in St Louis, Missouri, with COVID-19 (diagnosed using nasopharyngeal swabs). EXPOSURES: Testosterone, estradiol, and IGF-1 concentrations were measured at the time of presentation (ie, day 0) and at days 3, 7, 14, and 28 after admission (if the patient remained hospitalized). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Baseline hormone concentrations were compared among patients who had severe COVID-19 vs those with milder COVID-19 illness. RNA sequencing was performed on circulating mononuclear cells to understand the mechanistic association of altered circulating hormone concentrations with cellular signaling pathways. RESULTS: Among 152 patients (90 [59.2%] men; 62 [40.8%] women; mean [SD] age, 63 [16] years), 143 patients (94.1%) were hospitalized. Among 66 men with severe COVID-19, median [interquartile range] testosterone concentrations were lower at day 0 (53 [18 to 114] ng/dL vs 151 [95 to 217] ng/dL; P = .01) and day 3 (19 [6 to 68] ng/dL vs 111 [49 to 274] ng/dL; P = .006) compared with 24 men with milder disease. Testosterone concentrations were inversely associated with concentrations of interleukin 6 (β = −0.43; 95% CI, −0.52 to −0.17; P < .001), C-reactive protein (β = −0.38; 95% CI, −0.78 to −0.16; P = .004), interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (β = −0.29; 95% CI, −0.64 to −0.06; P = .02), hepatocyte growth factor (β = −0.46; 95% CI, −0.69 to −0.25; P < .001), and interferon γ–inducible protein 10 (β = −0.32; 95% CI, −0.62 to −0.10; P = .007). Estradiol and IGF-1 concentrations were not associated with COVID-19 severity in men. Testosterone, estradiol, and IGF-1 concentrations were similar in women with and without severe COVID-19. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed upregulated hormone signaling pathways in CD14(+)CD16(−) (ie, classical) monocytes and CD14(−)CD16(+) (ie, nonclassical) monocytes in male patients with COVID-19 who needed intensive care unit treatment vs those who did not. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this single-center cohort study of patients with COVID-19, lower testosterone concentrations during hospitalization were associated with increased disease severity and inflammation in men. Hormone signaling pathways in monocytes did not parallel serum hormone concentrations, and further investigation is required to understand their pathophysiologic association with COVID-19.","Dhindsa, Sandeep; Zhang, Nan; McPhaul, Michael J.; Wu, Zengru; Ghoshal, Amit K.; Erlich, Emma C.; Mani, Kartik; Randolph, Gwendalyn J.; Edwards, John R.; Mudd, Philip A.; Diwan, Abhinav",JAMA Netw Open,200,26

The diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 is done by detecting viral RNA in the nasopharyngeal and throat swabs by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Many commercial assays are now available for performing the PCR assay. Aims: The aim was to evaluate the performance of the SD Biosensor nCoV real-time detection kit with the real-time PCR kit provided by the Indian Council of Medical Research-National Institute of Virology (ICMR-NIV), Pune (NIV Protocol). Subjects and Methods: A total of 253 pairs of nasopharyngeal-oropharyngeal swabs combined in a single viral transport medium were tested for viral RNA by both the protocols. The sensitivity and specificity of the SD Biosensor were calculated considering the ICMR-NIV kit as the gold standard. Matched pairs of recorded cycle threshold values (Ct values) were compared by Pearson’s correlation coefficient. Results: Concordant COVID-19 negative and positive PCR results were reported for 113 and 77 samples, respectively. The SD Biosensor kit additionally detected 62 cases, which were found negative by the NIV protocol. In all discordant positive results by the SD Biosensor kit, the average Ct values were higher than the concordant positive results. A total of forty samples tested positive for E gene by SD Biosensor and having Ct values <25 had 100% concordance with NIV protocol results and 39 samples tested positive for E gene by SD Biosensor having Ct value >32 were all found negative by the NIV protocol. Conclusions: The results highlight the need for careful evaluation of commercial kits before being deployed for screening of COVID-19 infections.","Siddiqui, Oves; Manchanda, Vikas; Yadav, Abhishek; Sagar, Tanu; Tuteja, Sanchita; Nagi, Nazia; Saxena, Sonal",Indian Journal of Medical Microbiology,200,1

Monitoring of the viral load will be a valuable method to reduce the optimal number of quarantine days, especially in presymptomatic and symptomatic carriers of their households. The traditional three-generation families living together are seen frequently in East Asia, including in Taiwan. Study Design We report on a family cluster with six individuals infected with coronavirus disease in Taiwan. Methods The current public policy in Taiwan is quarantine for at least 14 days, based on the incubation period, or until the patient has tested negative three days in a row using the SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Details on the onset date of clinical symptoms, throat swab conversion, and course of disease were collected from medical records retrospectively. Results In the household of this three-generation Taiwanese family, the infection rate was 60%. The ratio of males to females was 4:2, and the age range was 11–85 years. The prevalence of asymptomatic disease was 33.3% (2/6). The longest throat swab conversion time was 37 days, and the estimated course of disease from symptoms to first conversion of throat swab was 59 days. Conclusions Large families, including three-generation families in a single dwelling, should be monitored when the index case is found. Presymptomatic and symptomatic family members could be quarantined for an appropriate duration which, in our experience, is 2 months.","Yang, Mei-Chen; Hung, Po-Pin; Wu, Yao-Kuang; Peng, Ming-Yieh; Chao, You-Chen; Su, Wen-Lin",Public Health,200,18

One frequently proposed method is UV-C irradiation. However, UV-C doses necessary to achieve inactivation of high-titer SARS-CoV-2 are poorly defined. Methods Using a box and two handheld systems designed to decontaminate objects and surfaces we evaluated the efficacy of 254 nm UV-C treatment to inactivate surface dried SARS-CoV-2. Results Drying for two hours did not have a major impact on the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2, indicating that exhaled virus in droplets or aerosols stays infectious on surfaces at least for a certain amount of time. Short exposure of high titer surface dried virus (3-5*10^6 IU/ml) with UV-C light (16 mJ/cm2) resulted in a total inactivation of SARS-CoV-2. Dose-dependency experiments revealed that 3.5 mJ/cm2 were still effective to achieve a > 6-log reduction in viral titers whereas 1.75 mJ/cm2 lowered infectivity only by one order of magnitude. Conclusions Our results demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 is rapidly inactivated by relatively low doses of UV-C irradiation. Furthermore, the data reveal that the relationship between UV-C dose and log-viral titer reduction of surface residing SARS-CoV-2 is non-linear. In the context of UV-C-based technologies used to disinfect surfaces, our findings emphasize the necessity to assure sufficient and complete exposure of all relevant areas by integrated UV-C doses of at least 3.5 mJ/cm2 at 254 nm. Altogether, UV-C treatment is an effective non-chemical possibility to decontaminate surfaces from high-titer infectious SARS-CoV-2.","Ruetalo, Natalia; Businger, Ramona; Schindler, Michael",bioRxiv,200,1

We aimed to quantify the total number of infections imported into mainland China by arriving travellers. Methods We actively surveyed arriving travellers at all 272 international entry–exit ports in mainland China. Suspected cases were detected through fever screening, medical inspection, self-declaration, and reporting by on-board staff. Participants completed a standardised questionnaire with questions about demographics, their travel itinerary (including detailed information about all countries or regions visited), and clinical manifestations. Nasopharyngeal swabs, sputum samples, faecal samples, vomitus, blood, and serum were collected as appropriate for diagnoses. Diagnosis was made by specific laboratory tests according to the national technical guidelines. Infections were classified as respiratory, gastrointestinal, vector-borne, blood-transmitted and sex-transmitted, or mucocutaneous. We divided arriving travellers into two groups: travellers coming from countries other than China, and travellers coming from Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan. We integrated surveillance data for 2014–16, calculated incidences of travel-related infections, and compared the frequency of infections among subgroups. Findings Between Jan 1, 2014, and Dec 31, 2016, 22 797 cases were identified among 805 993 392 arriving travellers—an overall incidence of 28·3 per million. 45 pathogens were detected in participants: 18 respiratory (19 662 cases), ten gastrointestinal (189 cases), seven vector-borne (831 cases), seven blood-transmitted and sex-transmitted (1531 cases), and three mucocutaneous (584 cases). Both the overall number and incidence of infection were more than five times higher in 2016 than in 2014. Case numbers and incidences also varied substantially by province, autonomous region, and municipality. Overall, 17 643 (77%) infections were detected by fever screening, but 753 (49%) blood-transmitted and sex-transmitted infections were identified through medical inspection. 14 305 (73%) cases of respiratory infection and 96 (51%) of gastrointestinal infections were in tourists. Tuberculosis, hepatitis A virus, vector-borne, and blood-transmitted and sex-transmitted infections were common among Chinese labourers who worked abroad. Dengue and malaria were most commonly diagnosed in travellers arriving from Africa. 12 126 (93%) of the 12 985 cases arriving from Hong Kong, Macau, or Taiwan were respiratory infections. Hand, foot, and mouth disease accounted for 2·90% of infections in travellers from Hong Kong, Macau, or Taiwan and 0·31% of infections in international travellers. Interpretation This report is the first to characterise the profile of travel-related infections among arriving travellers in mainland China. Our findings should increase public awareness of the potential risk of imported infections, and help health-care providers to make evidence-based health recommendations to travellers.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the value of chest computed tomography severity score (CT-SS) in differentiating clinical forms of COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Inclusion of 102 patients with COVID-19 confirmed by positive real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction on throat swabs underwent chest CT (53 men and 49 women, 15-79 years old, 84 cases with mild and 18 cases with severe disease). The CT-SS was defined by summing up individual scores from 20 lung regions; scores of 0, 1, and 2 were respectively assigned for each region if parenchymal opacification involved 0%, less than 50%, or equal or more than 50% of each region (theoretical range of CT-SS from 0 to 40). The clinical and laboratory data were collected, and patients were clinically subdivided according to disease severity by the Chinese National Health Commission guidelines. RESULTS: The posterior segment of upper lobe (left, 68/102; right, 68/102), superior segment of lower lobe (left, 79/102; right, 79/102), lateral basal segment (left, 79/102; right, 70/102) and posterior basal segment of lower lobe (left, 81/102; right, 83/102) were the most frequently involved sites in COVID-19. Lung opacification mainly involved the lower lobes, in comparison with middle-upper lobes. No significant differences in distribution of the disease were seen between right and left lungs. The individual scores of in each lung, as well as the total CT-SS were higher in severe COVID-19 when compared with mild cases (P<0.05. The optimal CT-SS threshold for identifying severe COVID-19 was 19.5 (area under curve, 0.892), with 83.3% sensitivity and 94% specificity. CONCLUSION: CT-SS could be used to quickly and objectively evaluate the severity of pulmonary involvement in COVID-19 patients.","Yang, Ran; Li, Xiang; Liu, Huan; Zhen, Yanling; Zhang, Xianxiang; Xiong, Qiuxia; Luo, Yong; Gao, Cailiang; Zeng, Wenbing",Radiol Cardiothorac Imaging,200,14

This study examined the prospective association between EIP receipt and mental health outcomes. METHODS: A nationally representative sample of 3169 middle-income and low-income US adults completed a baseline assessment of their health and well-being in May–June 2020 and a 3-month follow-up assessment during the period of the COVID-19 pandemic when EIPs were distributed. RESULTS: Controlling for sociodemographic characteristics, EIP recipients had higher odds of reporting a positive COVID-19 test, endorsing a history of post-traumatic stress disorder and reporting any illicit drug use in the past month than participants who did not receive EIP. Participants who did not receive EIP were more likely to report a history of anxiety disorder or alcohol use disorder and recent suicidal ideation than EIP recipients. There was no association between EIP receipt and financial distress, although over one-third to over half of EIP recipients were not employed at baseline. Between baseline and 3-month follow-up, receipt of EIP was significantly associated with reduced medical conditions and alcohol use problems, but increased depression, suicidal ideation and COVID-19 era-related stress. CONCLUSION: The EIP provided a brief income stimulus to many adults in need but was not associated with improvements in financial distress or mental health among middle-income and low-income recipients. Long-term income security and employment may be more important to improving and sustaining positive mental health outcomes.","Tsai, Jack; Huang, Minda; Rajan, Suja S; Elbogen, Eric B",J Epidemiol Community Health,200,16

The prevalence of COVID-19 has increased rapidly worldwide. Since there is no effective COVID-19 vaccine available yet, it is increasingly important to understand the average incubation period of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to design appropriate preventive and control strategies. Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis was designed to estimate the pooled average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2. Methods: We conducted a systematic electronic web-based search of online databases including PubMed, Google Scholar, EMBASE, and the World Health Organization's HINARI portal. We included peer-reviewed research studies written in the English language on the incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 using pre-defined quality and inclusion criteria. STATA version 15 statistical software was used to analyze the data. Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal quality assessment tool for observational studies was utilized to evaluate the included studies. We extracted relevant data and presented in a tabular form. The I(2) test was used to assess heterogeneity across studies. Funnel plot asymmetry and Egger's tests were used to check for publication bias. The final effect size was determined by applying a random-effects model. Results: Our search identified 206 studies, amongst which 18 studies, representing 22,595 participants were included in the final analysis. The pooled average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 was 5.7 days (95% CI: 5.1, 6.4). Subgroup analyses by geographic location showed that the pooled average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 was 6.1 days (95% CI: 5.34, 6.94) in China and 4.54 (95% CI: 3.9, 5.2) in other countries (Singapore, South Korea, and globally). Conclusion: The pooled average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 was about six days. The longest incubation period was observed in China. The global health initiatives as well as local health planners should consider, this average incubation period while designing optimal prevention and control strategies for SARS-CoV-2.","Wassie, Gizachew Tadesse; Azene, Abebaw Gedef; Bantie, Getasew Mulat; Dessie, Getenet; Aragaw, Abiba Mihret",Curr Ther Res Clin Exp,200,16

The spread of multi-drug resistant organisms presents increasing challenges to treatment. Surviving BSI is dependent on rapid and accurate identification of causal organisms, and timely application of appropriate antibiotics. Current culture-based methods used to detect and identify agents of BSI are often too slow to impact early therapy and may fail to detect relevant organisms in many positive cases. Existing methods for direct molecular detection of microbial DNA in blood are limited in either sensitivity (likely the result of small sample volumes) or in breadth of coverage, often because the PCR primers and probes used target only a few specific pathogens. There is a clear unmet need for a sensitive molecular assay capable of identifying the diverse bacteria and yeast associated with BSI directly from uncultured whole blood samples. We have developed a method of extracting DNA from larger volumes of whole blood (5 ml per sample), amplifying multiple widely conserved bacterial and fungal genes using a mismatch- and background-tolerant PCR chemistry, and identifying hundreds of diverse organisms from the amplified fragments on the basis of species-specific genetic signatures using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (PCR/ESI-MS). We describe the analytical characteristics of the IRIDICA BAC BSI Assay and compare its pre-clinical performance to current standard-of-care methods in a collection of prospectively collected blood specimens from patients with symptoms of sepsis. The assay generated matching results in 80% of culture-positive cases (86% when common contaminants were excluded from the analysis), and twice the total number of positive detections. The described method is capable of providing organism identifications directly from uncultured blood in less than 8 hours.

METHODS: The study was conducted in the pandemic wards of Adiyaman University Training and Research Hospital during April and May 2020. All patients admitted to the COVID-19 pandemic wards during the study period were invited to participate in the study. The study included 40 adults who agreed to participate and underwent a mucociliary clearance test successfully. The primary outcome was mucociliary clearance time and the secondary variables of interest were age, sex, and sino-nasal outcome test-22 scores. The control group included 40 concomitant healthy patients who visited the outpatient ear, nose and throat clinic with non-nasal symptoms. RESULTS: The study included 40 COVID-19-positive patients and 40 healthy controls. The mean mucociliary clearance times of the study (15.53 ± 5.57 min) and control (9.50 ± 3.70 min) groups were significantly different (Z = 4.675, p < 0.001). However, the mucociliary clearance time was not significantly different between males and females (t = 0.590, p = 0.558). CONCLUSIONS: Nasal mucociliary clearance time was prolonged in COVID-19 patients compared to healthy controls. Thus, we conclude that smell and taste are crucial symptoms that should not be overlooked in patients suspected of COVID-19 disease.","Koparal, Mehtap; Kurt, Ercan; Altuntas, Emine Elif; Dogan, Fatih",Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol,200,1

A docking study involving binding between the dipeptidic lead compound 4 and 3CL(pro) suggested the modification of a structurally flexible P3 N-(3-methoxyphenyl)glycine with various rigid P3 moieties in 4. The modifications led to the identification of several potent derivatives, including 5c–k and 5n with the inhibitory activities (K(i) or IC(50)) in the submicromolar to nanomolar range. Compound 5h, in particular, displayed the most potent inhibitory activity, with a K(i) value of 0.006 μM. This potency was 65-fold higher than the potency of the lead compound 4 (K(i) = 0.39 μM). In addition, the K(i) value of 5h was in very good agreement with the binding affinity (16 nM) observed in isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). A SAR study around the P3 group in the lead 4 led to the identification of a rigid indole-2-carbonyl unit as one of the best P3 moieties (5c). Further optimization showed that a methoxy substitution at the 4-position on the indole unit was highly favorable for enhancing the inhibitory potency.","Thanigaimalai, Pillaiyar; Konno, Sho; Yamamoto, Takehito; Koiwai, Yuji; Taguchi, Akihiro; Takayama, Kentaro; Yakushiji, Fumika; Akaji, Kenichi; Chen, Shen-En; Naser-Tavakolian, Aurash; Schön, Arne; Freire, Ernesto; Hayashi, Yoshio",Eur J Med Chem,200,20

Moreover, competition in hospital markets is promoted to reduce health care spending. However, the effects of system membership and competition on treatment choices of hospitals have not been considered in studying hospital ownership types. We examine the treatment choices of hospitals considering ownership types (not-for-profit, for-profit, and government), system membership, patient insurance status (insured, and uninsured) and hospital competition in the United States. METHODS: We estimate the probability of according the procedure as the treatment employing logistic regression. We consider all procedures accorded at hospitals, controlling for procedure type and diagnosis as well as relevant patient and hospital characteristics. Competition faced by hospitals is measured using a distance-weighted approach separately for procedural groups. Patient records are obtained from State Inpatient Databases for 11 states and hospital characteristics come from American Hospital Association Annual Survey. RESULTS: Not-for-profit hospitals facing low for-profit competition that are nonmembers of hospital systems, act like government hospitals, whereas not-for-profits facing high for-profit competition and system member not-for-profits facing low for-profit competition are not statistically significantly different from their for-profit counterparts in terms of treatment choices. Uninsured patients are on average 7% less likely to be accorded the procedure as the treatment at system member not-for-profit hospitals facing high for-profit competition than insured patients. System member not-for-profit hospitals, which account for over half of the observations in the analysis, are on average 16% more likely to accord the procedure as the treatment when facing high for-profit competition than low-for-profit competition. CONCLUSIONS: We show that treatment choices of hospitals differ by system membership and the level of for-profit competition faced by the hospitals in addition to hospital ownership type and health insurance status of patients. Our results support that hospital system member not-for-profits and not-for-profits facing high for-profit competition are for-profits in disguise. Therefore, system membership is an important characteristic to consider in addition to market competitiveness when tax exemption of not-for-profits are revisited. Moreover, higher competition may lead to increasing health care costs due to more aggressive treatment choices, which should be taken into account while regulating hospital markets.

Despite this increase in testing, many pediatric hematology–oncology (PHO) providers are not confident interpreting or utilizing tumor or germline genomic results to care for their patients. METHODS: We developed and delivered a needs assessment survey to PHO program directors, attendings, and fellows in the United States to understand this deficiency, gather data on existing cancer genomics educational initiatives, and query preferences for creating a future curriculum. RESULTS: The survey includes 31 (41%) of 74 invited PHO program directors, 110 (11%) of 1032 invited attendings, and 79 fellows. The majority of attending physicians and fellows responding to the survey agree that understanding tumor (95% attending physicians; 95% fellows) and germline (86% attending physicians; 94% fellows) genomic information is essential for their practice. However, only 9 of 31 (29%) responding programs report that they have an existing cancer genomics curriculum. Most program directors indicated that the ideal genomics curriculum would occur during the first year of fellowship and incorporate direct patient care, online modules, and problem‐based learning. Attending physicians and fellows identified that addressing indications for ordering tumor and germline genomic testing, counseling about the risks and benefits of such testing, and interpreting and individualizing clinical management based on tumor and germline results should be included in a future curriculum.

Their prevalence in the UK, is likely to increase due to new legislation. Clear information regarding the appropriate use of masks is needed, to ensure compliance with policies to reduce transmission of COVID-19. We aimed to assess the impact of visual representations of guidance, or infographics, upon the knowledge of appropriate face mask usage in a representative UK cohort. METHODS: Adult patients were recruited to this randomised internet-based questionnaire study during the 12–14 May 2020 from across the UK. Respondents viewed one of five public health stimuli regarding the use of face masks, or no stimulus. The groups accessed aids by the European Centre for Disease Control (EUCDC), World Health Organisation (WHO), Singaporean Ministry of Health (SMOH), text from the UK government (UK Gov), or an infographic designed by the Behavioural Insights Team (BIT). The primary outcome was to evaluate the effect of each infographic upon participants’ recall of face mask technique, sentiments and willingness to wear a face covering. Secondary outcomes included the effect of symptomology and socio-demographic factors. RESULTS: 4099 respondents were randomised (1009 control, 628 EUCDC, 526 WHO, 639 SMOH, 661 UKGOV and 606 BIT). Stimuli from the WHO, SMOH and BIT demonstrated significantly higher average recall scores compared to the controls (7.40 v. 7.38 v. 7.34 v. 6.97, P < 0.001). BIT’s stimulus led to the highest confidence about mask-wearing (87%). Only 48.2% of the cohort felt stimuli reduced anxiety about COVID-19. However, willingness to use a mask was high, (range 84 to 88%). CONCLUSIONS: To ensure the appropriate use of masks, as mandated by UK law, guidance must provide sufficient information, yet remain understandable. Infographics can aid the recall of correct mask techniques by highlighting salient steps and reducing cognitive burden. They have also demonstrated greater trustworthiness than text-only guidance. The effect of infographics upon COVID-19-related anxiety was poor, and they should be further developed to address this sentiment. A willingness to wear face masks has, however, been demonstrated.

Participants with a high school education and lower had higher odds of responding ‘Don’t Know/Not Sure’ versus ‘Yes’ compared to those with college or higher education. Those unconcerned about COVID-19 in their community had higher odds of responding ‘No’ (OR = 2.51, CI 1.35–4.68) and ‘Don’t Know/Not Sure’ (OR = 2.51, CI 1.26–4.99) versus ‘Yes’, as compared to those who were concerned. Possibility of exposure at work was the most frequent reasons for perceiving themselves susceptible to COVID-19, engagement in recommended preventive measures was the most frequent reason among respondents who indicated ‘No’, and uncertainty/perception that everyone is at risk was the most frequent reason among the ones who indicated ‘Don’t Know/Not Sure’. Results indicate that tailored efforts to heighten perceived susceptibility to COVID-19 among specific demographics are needed.","Scarinci, Isabel C.; Pandya, Vishruti N.; Kim, Young-il; Bae, Sejong; Peral, Sylvia; Tipre, Meghan; Hardy, Claudia; Hansen, Barbara; Baskin, Monica L.",J Community Health,200,1

Daily reported numbers (March 29th to April 28th) are based on Our World in Data database (derived from the European Center for Disease Control and Prevention, ECDC). In all seven countries, numbers of new cases peaked on Thursday-Friday, five days after the weekend, corresponding with a reported ~5-day lag between contact with an infected person and the manifestation of clinical symptoms. Death tolls peaked on Wednesday-Thursday in all seven countries, ~12-14 days following a weekend, corresponding with the reported median of 14-day hospitalization before death. One may suspect that the weekend restricts the availability of testing or reporting of new cases, that are eventually reported during the following week. However, to completely account for both observations, this artifact should occur uniformly in all the above-mentioned countries and consistently along the entire month studied. Moreover, deaths are defined events and seems less likely to be recorded or reported inaccurately, at least for the vast majority of cases. Thus, we hypothesize that an increase in inter-generational social interactions occurs during the weekend, which facilitates transfer of COVID-19 from younger people to older vulnerable individuals. These and additional infected older people account for most recognized COVID-19 cases and deaths, which may occur at regular time intervals, specifically in this vulnerable population. Additional explanations may include weekly rhythms in immune functions, hospital care quality, or other various health-related behaviors. Our hypotheses should be re-tested and refined based on databases that accurately report events times when these will become available.","Ricon-Becker, I.; Tarrasch, R.; Blinder, P.; Ben-Eliyahu, S.",,200,6

The aim of this study was to investigate how individual-level housing and neighbourhood characteristics are associated with COVID-19 mortality in older adults. METHODS: For this population-based, observational study, we used data from the cause-of-death register held by the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare to identify recorded COVID-19 mortality and mortality from other causes among individuals (aged ≥70 years) in Stockholm county, Sweden, between March 12 and May 8, 2020. This information was linked to population-register data from December, 2019, including socioeconomic, demographic, and residential characteristics. We ran Cox proportional hazards regressions for the risk of dying from COVID-19 and from all other causes. The independent variables were area (m(2)) per individual in the household, the age structure of the household, type of housing, confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the borough, and neighbourhood population density. All models were adjusted for individual age, sex, country of birth, income, and education. FINDINGS: Of 279 961 individuals identified to be aged 70 years or older on March 12, 2020, and residing in Stockholm in December, 2019, 274 712 met the eligibility criteria and were included in the study population. Between March 12 and May 8, 2020, 3386 deaths occurred, of which 1301 were reported as COVID-19 deaths. In fully adjusted models, household and neighbourhood characteristics were independently associated with COVID-19 mortality among older adults. Compared with living in a household with individuals aged 66 years or older, living with someone of working age (<66 years) was associated with increased COVID-19 mortality (hazard ratio 1·6; 95% CI 1·3–2·0). Living in a care home was associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 mortality (4·1; 3·5–4·9) compared with living in independent housing. Living in neighbourhoods with the highest population density (≥5000 individuals per km(2)) was associated with higher COVID-19 mortality (1·7; 1·1–2·4) compared with living in the least densely populated neighbourhoods (0 to <150 individuals per km(2)). INTERPRETATION: Close exposure to working-age household members and neighbours is associated with increased COVID-19 mortality among older adults. Similarly, living in a care home is associated with increased mortality, potentially through exposure to visitors and care workers, but also due to poor underlying health among care-home residents. These factors should be considered when developing strategies to protect this group.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1-RAs) have significant cardiovascular and renal benefits for patients with T2DM and related comorbidities. Their anti-inflammatory properties could be beneficial in these patients. This work provides less-biased estimates regarding the risk for respiratory tract infections and acute respiratory distress syndrome by performing the first significant meta-analysis of cardiovascular outcome trials in the literature. Notably, GLP-1-RAs do not seem to increase the risk for respiratory tract infection, pneumonia, or acute respiratory distress syndrome in patients with T2DM and cardiovascular comorbidities.","Patoulias, D.; Boulmpou, A.; Imprialos, K.; Stavropoulos, K.; Papadopoulos, C.; Doumas, M.",Rev Clin Esp (Barc),200,13

Indirect impacts are caused by missed or delayed health care—not as a direct consequence of COVID-19 infections. This study gathered experiences of, and perspectives on, the indirect impacts of COVID-19 for health consumers, patients, their families and carers, and the broader community in New South Wales, Australia. A series of semi-structured virtual group discussions were conducted with 33 health consumers and community members between August 24 and August 31, 2020. Data were analyzed using an inductive thematic analysis approach. The analysis identified 3 main themes: poor health outcomes for individuals; problems with how health care is designed and delivered; and increasing health inequality. This case study provides insight into the indirect impacts of COVID-19. Health systems can draw on the insights learned as a source of experiential evidence to help identify, monitor and respond to the indirect impacts of COVID-19.","Dimopoulos-Bick, Tara; Walsh, Louisa; Sutherland, Kim",J Patient Exp,200,30
