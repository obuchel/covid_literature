Granulocytes and pro-inflammatory Ly6Chigh monocytes infiltrate the nerve first, and rapidly give way to Ly6Cnegative inflammation-resolving macrophages. In axotomized DRGs, few hematogenous leukocytes are detected and resident macrophages acquire a ramified morphology. Single-cell RNA-sequencing of injured sciatic nerve identifies five macrophage subpopulations, repair Schwann cells, and mesenchymal precursor cells. Macrophages at the nerve crush site are molecularly distinct from macrophages associated with Wallerian degeneration. In the injured nerve, macrophages 'eat' apoptotic leukocytes, a process called efferocytosis, and thereby promote an anti-inflammatory milieu. Myeloid cells in the injured nerve, but not axotomized DRGs, strongly express receptors for the cytokine GM-CSF. In GM-CSF deficient (Csf2-/-) mice, inflammation resolution is delayed and conditioning-lesion induced regeneration of DRG neuron central axons is abolished. Thus, carefully orchestrated inflammation resolution in the nerve is required for conditioning-lesion induced neurorepair.","Kalinski, Ashley L; Yoon, Choya; Huffman, Lucas D; Duncker, Patrick C; Kohen, Rafi; Passino, Ryan; Hafner, Hannah; Johnson, Craig; Kawaguchi, Riki; Carbajal, Kevin S; Jara, Juan Sebastian; Hollis, Edmund R; Geschwind, Daniel H; Segal, Benjamin M; Giger, Roman",eLife,838,1

We evaluated its efficacy for maintaining dose intensity during chemotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS We retrospectively examined the data of 65 women (26 pegfilgrastim users) who underwent primary surgical treatment for stages IB-IV endometrial cancer and had adjuvant chemotherapy containing platinum and taxane; the primary outcome was a relative dose intensity ≥85%. RESULTS In the pegfilgrastim vs. the control group, body mass index (26.6±5.9 vs. 23.4±4.4), rate of relative dose intensity ≥85% (88.5% vs. 15.4%), plus other adverse event incidences were significantly higher; rate of neutropenia, total hospital visits during chemotherapy (11.0±2.1 vs. 18±5.6 days), unscheduled hospital visits (1.1±1.8 vs. 5.8±5.1 days), and unscheduled granulocyte colony-stimulating factor injections (0.58±1.7 vs. 6.4±5.1 days) were significantly lower. CONCLUSION Pegfilgrastim can maintain a dose intensity of ≥85% during chemotherapy for the treatment of gynaecologic cancers and decrease hospital-visit frequency.","Chikazawa, Kenro; Imai, Ken; Ito, Takaki; Kimura, Azusa; Hiroyoshi, K O; Miho, Yokota; Kuwata, Tomoyuki; Konno, Ryo",In vivo,838,16

We aimed to determine the prevalence and predictors of cancer in patients in whom the diagnosis GP was considered, and to evaluate symptom improvement after treatment. STUDY Patients referred with possible GP (2001-2014) were retrospectively included. An experienced radiologist reassessed imaging. GP patients received questionnaires evaluating their symptoms. RESULTS From the 38 possible GP patients, 10 had cancer (26%) and 28 GP (74%). Compared with cancer patients, GP patients more frequently had cysts (2/10 vs. 18/28, P = 0.03), less often jaundice (6/10 vs 3/27, P < 0.01), an abrupt caliber change of the CBD (5/10 vs. 2/28, P < 0.01) or suspicious cytology (5/9 vs 2/20, P = 0.02). Of the 28 GP patients, 14 patients were treated conservatively of whom 12 reported symptom improvement after a median follow-up of 45 months (range 7-127 months). All 6 patients treated endoscopically and 7/8 patients treated surgically reported symptom improvement. Surgery, performed because of treatment failure (3/8) or inability to exclude malignancy (5/8), caused mortality in 1/8 patients. CONCLUSIONS Suspicion of pancreatic cancer should be high in patients presenting with possible GP. Conservative, endoscopic and surgical treatment can all lead to symptom improvement, suggesting a 'step-up approach' to GP once cancer is excluded.","Lekkerkerker, Selma J; Nio, Chung Y; Issa, Yama; Fockens, Paul; Verheij, Joanne; Busch, Olivier R; van Gulik, Thomas M; Rauws, Erik A; Boermeester, Marja A; van Hooft, Jeanin E; Besselink, Marc G",Journal of gastroenterology and hepatology,838,13

The volume distribution mastopexy technique provides breast lifting with projection enhancement and maintains breast suspension. METHOD Since 2010, 50 patients underwent volume distribution mastopexy procedures. The technique consists of a superior or superomedial pedicle, dissection of a Würinger-septum-based chest wall flap, suspension of the flap to the pectoralis major muscle using a prosthetic mesh, gland suture to the mesh, and fat grafting if required. A prospective study was conducted. Nipple position and length of the lower pole distance of the breast were noted. Patient satisfaction and results evaluation were reported using a Likert scale. RESULTS A Vicryl mesh was used in the first 23 patients and a mixed polyester/Vicryl mesh was used in the following 27 patients. Wound dehiscence occurred in one patient. At an average follow-up of 3 years, nipple position remained stable in position, but lower pole distance elongation was observed in five patients (20 percent) and in one patient (3 percent) who had Vicryl mesh and mixed mesh respectively (p < 0.05). Only four breasts (4.7 percent) demonstrated significant lower pole elongation over time (>15 percent), all in the Vicryl mesh group. Worth noting, both the patients and the independent evaluators provided high ratings of the result of 4.7 and 4.6, respectively, on a Likert scale. CONCLUSIONS The volume distribution mastopexy technique repositions the ptotic gland with a mesh to suspend the breast gland and to maintain the lifting effect. However, the synthetic mixed mesh proved to be significantly more effective in achieving this goal.

During pandemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) it is noticed that the central nervous system involvement represented a truly significant moment in the history of some COVID-19 patients; indeed, clinical and radiological features published in literature regarding COVID-19 disease are consistent with a neurological involvement. It is also known that histopathological data related to SARS-CoV2 infection have been published with considerable delay, which was even greater for neuropathological information. Moreover, many published data are incomplete, and often the lesions described are not directly related to the action of the virus. In this review we collected the available radiological and neuropathological information, in order to delineate a more complete picture of the relationship between SARS-Cov2 and brain, focusing our attention on the two most important neuroinvasion routes for the virus. We also highlighted what we consider methodological mistakes both in the autopsy procedures and brain study in COVID-19 deaths. We emphasize the need for a complete study of all the organs in case of autopsy. It is important that through this experience we no longer do the mistake of neglecting the brain.","Franca, Raduan Ahmed; Ugga, Lorenzo; Guadagno, Elia; Russo, Daniela; Del Basso De Caro, Marialaura","APMIS : acta pathologica, microbiologica, et immunologica Scandinavica",838,28

The objective of this study was to assess burnout in medical teachers in a large public medical university in Lahore, Pakistan and explore the factors behind it. Methods Using an explanatory sequential mixed methods design, we first sent out the abbreviated Maslach Burnout Inventory (aMBI) to all teaching faculty of basic and clinical science at King Edward Medical University (KEMU) Lahore. Descriptive analysis was performed on the 203 respondents who returned the survey. Of those who scored higher on the aMBI, 10 respondents (8 clinical science faculty and two basic science faculty) were selected for detailed semi-structured interviews exploring possible reasons for burnout. Thematic analysis of interview transcripts was performed using Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis. Triangulation and member checking was used for validation. Results About 38.9% of respondents scored high on the Emotional Exhaustion subscale and 31.5% scored high on the Depersonalization subscale. There were statistically significant differences on the mean Emotional Exhaustion scores (p <0.001) between Basic and Clinical Sciences Departments with respondents from the Clinical Departments having higher scores (7.84 ± 4.32). Four main themes and multiple sub-themes emerged around burnout after qualitative analysis of the data. These included 1. Work-related factors 2. Family and social factors including challenges related specifically to women 3. Feelings and emotions and 4. Personal Qualities. Conclusion A significant proportion of medical faculty experiences burnout related to their professional and personal responsibilities. The reasons are varied. Policy planners and University/College administrators must acknowledge the negative effects of burnout on medical teachers and take steps to ameliorate it in the interests of improving medical education and training.","Hashmi, Ali Madeeh",Pakistan journal of medical sciences,838,24

The coactivator proteins adopt two hotspot sites, namely α-helix and Ω-loop, to interact with TEAD. Here, we demonstrate that both the α-helix and Ω-loop peptides cannot maintain in structured state when splitting from the full-length coactivator proteins; they exhibit a large intrinsic disorder in free state that prevents the coactivator peptide recognition by TEAD. Rational design is used to optimize the interfacial residues of coactivator α-helix peptides, which can effectively improve the favorable direct readout effect upon the peptide binding to TEAD. Chemical modification is employed to constrain the free α-helix peptide into native ordered conformation. The method introduces an all-hydrocarbon bridge across i and i + 4 residues to stabilize the helical structure of a free coactivator peptide, which can considerably reduce the unfavorable indirect readout effect upon the peptide binding to TEAD. The all-hydrocarbon bridge is designed to point out of the TEAD-peptide complex interface, which would not disrupt the direct intermolecular interaction between the TEAD and peptide. Therefore, the stapling only improves peptide affinity, but does not alter peptide specificity, to TEAD. Affinity assay confirms that the binding potency of coactivator α-helix peptides is improved substantially by >5-fold upon the rational design and chemical modification. Structural analysis reveals that the optimized/stapled peptides can form diverse nonbonded interactions such as hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts with TEAD, thus conferring stability and specificity to the TEAD-peptide complex systems.","Gao, Shuxia; Wang, Yingchao; Ji, Lijuan",Journal of receptor and signal transduction research,838,16

Gastrectomy with curative intent is often initially impossible or difficult. OBJECTIVE We report our experience of curative distal gastrectomy after laparoscopic gastrojejunostomy and fluorouracil, leucovorin, oxaliplatin, and docetaxel (FLOT) chemotherapy to examine the feasibility and safety of this modified strategy for locally advanced gastric cancer with outlet obstruction, initially deemed unresectable. METHODS Between October 2017 and June 2019, 15 patients diagnosed with locally advanced gastric cancer with outlet obstruction sequentially underwent gastrojejunostomy, received four cycles of FLOT chemotherapy, and underwent laparoscopic distal gastrectomy with curative intent (R0 resection + D2 lymphadenectomy). Clinical data were retrospectively collected and analyzed. RESULTS R0 resection was possible in 12/15 patients, laparoscopically in 11, and one conversion to laparotomy was necessary. There was no perioperative mortality in the 12 patients. Pathologic evaluation of the resected specimens revealed that complete tumor grade regression 1a (TRG1a), TRG1b, TRG2, and TRG3 occurred in 3, 2, 4, and 3 patients, respectively. CONCLUSION This case series showed that curative surgical resection was feasible as a staged approach for patients with locally advanced gastric cancer with outlet obstruction, after initial staged gastrojejunostomy and chemotherapy.","Zhang, Lu-Yang; Ma, Jun-Jun; Zang, Lu; Hong, Hi-Ju; Lu, Ai-Guo; He, Zi-Rui; Jiang, Tian-Yu; Zhao, Xuan; Fingerhut, Abe; Zheng, Min-Hua",Journal of surgical oncology,838,16

The present study aimed to analyse the ability of size descriptors to estimate propofol induction dose in class II and III obese patients. METHODS A cross-sectional study on adult patients with body mass index (BMI) equal to or greater than 35 kg/m2 and on adult patients with BMI lower than 35 kg/m2 was carried out. General anaesthesia was induced with remifentanil, propofol and rocuronium. Propofol infusion was started at 2000 mg/h until loss of consciousness. Bioelectrical impedance analysis and Brice modified interview was completed during pre- and post-operative evaluation, respectively. Measurements of propofol plasma concentration were performed using gas chromatography/ion trap-mass spectrometry. RESULTS Forty patients were enrolled in the study. The median values of fat free mass (FFM) in BMI < 35 kg/m2 and BMI ≥ 35 kg/m2 groups were 70% and 55% of total body weight, respectively. Our results did not demonstrate a strong correlation level between the studied size descriptors and propofol induction dose in both groups. Nevertheless, when propofol doses were normalized by FFM, an apparent convergence of the empirical cumulative distribution functions was observed. CONCLUSION None of the size descriptors was seen to be an effective predictor of the propofol induction dose in class II and III obese patients when a fixed infusion rate was used. Due to the observed variability between patients, guiding propofol induction dose against a clinical endpoint of unconsciousness appears more appropriate in order to avoid side effects related both with under or overdosing of propofol.","Araújo, A M; Machado, H S; Falcão, A C; Soares-da-Silva, P",Acta anaesthesiologica Scandinavica,838,16

ARMC5-inactivating variants cause adrenal tumors and possibly other neoplasms. OBJECTIVE To investigate a large cohort spNETs or MEN1 patients for changes in the ARMC5 gene. PATIENTS AND METHODS 111 patients, 94 with spNET and 17 with MEN1 were screened for ARMC5 germline alterations. 36 tumors (18 spNETs and 18 MEN1-related) were collected from 20 patients. Blood and tumor DNA samples were genotyped using Sanger sequencing and microsatellite markers for chromosomes. ARMC5 and MEN1 expression were assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC). RESULTS In 76/111 (68.4%) patients, we identified 16 different ARMC5 germline variants; two predicted as damaging. No differences on the prevalence of ARMC5 variants depending on the MEN1 status adrenal lesions. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at chromosome 16p and ARMC5 germline variants were present together in 23/34 (67.6%) tumors; in 7/23 (30.4%) their presence led to biallelic inactivation of the ARMC5 gene. The latter was more prevalent in MEN1-related tumors than in spNETs (88.9% vs 38.9%; p=0.0045). LOH at the chromosome 16p (ARMC5) and 11q (MEN1) loci coexisted in 16/18 MEN1-related tumors, which also expressed lower ARMC5 (p=0.017) and MEN1 (p=0.011) proteins compared to peri-tumorous tissues. CONCLUSION Germline ARMC5 variants are common among spNET and MEN1 patients. ARMC5 haploinsufficiency or biallelic inactivation in spNETs and MEN1-related tumors suggests that ARMC5 may have a role in modifying the phenotype of patients with spNETs and/or MEN1 beyond its known role in macronodular adrenocortical hyperplasia.","Damjanovic, Svetozar S; Antic, Jadranka A; Elezovic-Kovacevic, Valentina I; Dundjerovic, Dusko M; Milicevic, Ivana T; Beleslin-Cokic, Bojana B; Ilic, Bojana B; Rodic, Gordana S; Berthon, Annabel; Maria, Andrea Gutierrez; Faucz, Fabio R; Stratakis, Constantine A",The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,838,1

Acellular dermal matrix has enabled single-stage ventral hernia repair in clean-contaminated wounds but can be associated with higher complications and cost compared with synthetic mesh. This study evaluated the cost-utility of synthetic mesh and acellular dermal matrix for clean-contaminated ventral hernia repairs. METHODS A systematic review of articles comparing outcomes for synthetic and acellular dermal matrix repairs identified 14 ventral hernia repair-specific health states. Quality-adjusted life years were determined through Web-based visual analog scale survey of 300 nationally representative individuals. Overall expected cost and quality-adjusted life-years for ventral hernia repair were assessed using a Monte Carlo simulation with sensitivity analyses. RESULTS Synthetic mesh reinforcement had an expected cost of $15,776 and quality-adjusted life-year value gained of 21.03. Biological mesh had an expected cost of $23,844 and quality-adjusted life-year value gained of 20.94. When referencing a common baseline (do nothing), acellular dermal matrix (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, 3378 ($/quality-adjusted life years)) and synthetic mesh (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, 2208 ($/quality-adjusted life years)) were judged cost-effective, although synthetic mesh was more strongly favored. Monte Carlo sensitivity analysis demonstrated that synthetic mesh was the preferred and most cost-effective strategy in 94 percent of simulations, supporting its overall greater cost-utility. Despite varying the willingness-to-pay threshold from $0 to $100,000 per quality-adjusted life-year, synthetic mesh remained the optimal strategy across all thresholds in sensitivity analysis. CONCLUSION This cost-utility analysis suggests that synthetic mesh repair of clean-contaminated hernia defects is more cost-effective than acellular dermal matrix.","Fischer, John P; Basta, Marten N; Krishnan, Naveen M; Wink, Jason D; Kovach, Stephen J",Plastic and reconstructive surgery,838,7

The virus interaction with cells located in the respiratory tract causes the release of inflammatory mediators, whose involvement could be exacerbated by co-existing obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular events. OBJECTIVES the objective of this research was to analyze the clinically metabolic status in patients who have suffered COVID-19 disease in order to predict the outcome. METHODS this research is a retrospective study based on a cohort of 165 consecutively admitted patients with criteria for COVID-19 pneumonia according to WHO guidelines at the Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro between March and April 2020. Recorded variables included demographic and epidemiological data plus diagnoses as well as morbid complications during hospitalization. The Biochemistry Unit Laboratory carried out laboratory analyses according to validated operational procedures. The statistical tests included univariate and multivariate models adjusted for baseline characteristics and clinically relevant features. RESULTS the most frequent comorbidity in our cohort was arterial hypertension (44.0 %), followed by dyslipidemia (32.1 %), obesity (30.9 %), and diabetes mellitus (20.0 %). The association between admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) with body mass index (BMI) in a multivariate model was statistically significant, evidencing that obese subjects (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2) have a 19 % higher risk of requiring ICU care. The univariate model revealed a statistically significant association between obesity and ICU admission and length of hospital stay (p < 0.05). The relationship between baseline blood glucose and in-hospital mortality was also statistically significant (p = 0.03), as well as with total cholesterol and ICU admission (p = 0.007). CONCLUSIONS obesity is related to a longer time of hospitalization and a higher rate of admissions to the ICU. Low total cholesterol levels and abnormal baseline blood glucose were risk factors for ICU requirement and in-hospital mortality. Patient categorization based on obesity could be valuable in the development of a precision medicine model within the COVID-19 pandemic.","Martínez Urbistondo, María; Mora Vargas, Alberto; Expósito Palomo, Esther; Aparicio De Miguel, María; Castejón Díaz, Raquel; Daimiel, Lidia; Ramos López, Omar; San Cristóbal, Rodrigo; Martínez, J Alfredo; Vargas Núñez, Juan Antonio",Nutricion hospitalaria,838,7

The study objective were to estimate the frequency of BTB, examine genetic diversity of the M. bovis population in cattle from five regions in Mali and to determine whether M. bovis is involved in active tuberculosis (TB) in humans. Samples from suspected lesions on cattle at the slaughterhouses were collected. Mycobacterial smear, culture confirmation, and spoligotyping were used for diagnosis and species identification. Mycobacterium DNA from TB patients was spoligotyped to identify M. bovis. RESULTS In total, 675 cattle have been examined for lesions in the five regions of Mali. Out of 675 cattle, 79 specimens presented lesions and then examined for the presence of M. bovis. Thus, 19 (24.1 %) were identified as M. bovis; eight (10.1 %) were non-tuberculous Mycobacterium (NTM). Nineteen spoligotype patterns were identified among 79 samples with five novel patterns.

METHODS Case series of the first 24 COVID-19 patients who underwent tracheostomy at our institution, a single-center tertiary care community hospital intensive care/ventilator weaning unit. The patients all had respiratory failure from COVID-19 and required endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. Outcomes reviewed include mortality, percent discharged, percent liberated from mechanical ventilation, percent decannulated, time from tracheostomy to ventilator liberation and discharge, and number of staff infected with COVID-19 during tracheostomy and management. RESULTS Of the 24 patients who underwent tracheostomy, 21 (88%) of 24 survived. Twenty (83%) were liberated from mechanical ventilation, and 19 (79%) were discharged. Fourteen (74%) of the discharged had been decannulated. The average (± SD) time from tracheostomy to ventilator liberation was 9 ± 4.3 days and from tracheostomy to discharge 21 ± 9 days. All discharged patients had been liberated from mechanical ventilation. No health care workers became infected with COVID-19 during the procedure or subsequent patient management. CONCLUSION Patients with respiratory failure from COVID-19 who underwent tracheostomy had a high likelihood of being liberated from mechanical ventilation and discharged. Tracheostomy and subsequent ventilator weaning management can be performed safely. Tracheostomy allowed for decompression of higher acuity medical units in a safe and effective manner.","Cardasis, John J; Rasamny, J K; Berzofsky, Craig E; Bello, Jennifer A; Multz, Alan S","Ear, nose, & throat journal",838,31

We examined the ability of resonance Raman spectroscopy to monitor tissue hemoglobin oxygenation (RRS-StO2) during hemorrhage and compared its performance with conventional invasive mixed venous (SmvO2) and central venous (ScvO2) hemoglobin oxygen saturation as well as with near-infrared spectroscopy tissue hemoglobin oxygenation (NIRS-StO2). METHODS Five male swine were anesthetized and instrumented followed by hemorrhage at a rate of 30 mL/min for 60 minutes. RRS-StO2 was continuously measured from the buccal mucosa, and NIRS-StO2 was continuously measured from the forelimb. Paired interval measures of SmvO2, ScvO2, and lactate were made. Pearson correlation was used to quantify the degree to which any two variables are related. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area under the curve values were used for pooled data for RRS-StO2, NIRS-StO2, SmvO2, and ScvO2 to compare performance in the ability of tissue oxygenation methods to predict the presence of an elevated arterial blood lactate level. RESULTS Sequential RRS-StO2 changes tracked changes in SmvO2 (r = 0.917; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.867-0.949) and ScvO2 (r = 0.901; 95% CI, 0.828-0.944) during hemorrhage, while NIRS-StO2 failed to do so for SmvO2 (r = 0.283; 95% CI, 0.04919-0.4984) and ScvO2 (r = 0.142; 95% CI, -0.151 to 0.412). ROC curve performance of oxygenation measured to indicate lactate less than or greater than 3 mM yielded the following ROC area under the curve values: SmvO2 (1.0), ScvO2 (0.994), RRS-StO2 (0.972), and NIRS-StO2 (0.611). CONCLUSION RRS-StO2 seems to have significantly better ability to track central oxygenation measures during hemorrhage as well as to predict shock based on elevated lactate levels when compared with NIRS-StO2.","Tiba, Mohamad H; Draucker, Gerard T; Barbee, Robert W; Terner, James; Filho, Ivo Torres; Romfh, Padraic; Vakhshoori, Daryoosh; Ward, Kevin R",The journal of trauma and acute care surgery,838,16

The purpose of this study was to better understand EMS professionals' decisions to receive or decline a COVID-19 vaccine.Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of nationally certified EMS professionals (18-85 years) in April 2021. Participants received an electronic survey asking whether they received a vaccine, why or why not, and their associated beliefs using three validated scales: perceived risk of COVID-19, medical mistrust, and confidence in the COVID-19 vaccine. Data were merged with National Registry dataset demographics. Analyses included descriptive analysis and multivariable logistic regression (OR, 95% CI). Multivariate imputation by chained equations was used for missingness.Results: A total of 2,584 respondents satisfied inclusion criteria (response rate =14%). Overall, 70% of EMS professionals were vaccinated. Common reasons for vaccination among vaccinated respondents were to protect oneself (76%) and others (73%). Common reasons for non-vaccination among non-vaccinated respondents included concerns about vaccine safety (53%) and beliefs that vaccination was not necessary (39%). Most who had not received the vaccine did not plan to get it in the future (84%). Hesitation was most frequently related to wanting to see how the vaccine was working for others (55%). Odds of COVID-19 vaccination were associated with demographics including age (referent <28 years; 39-50 years: 1.56, 1.17-2.08; >51 years: 2.22, 1.64-3.01), male sex (1.26, 1.01-1.58), residing in an urban/suburban area (referent rural; 1.36, 1.08-1.70), advanced education (referent GED/high school and below; bachelor's and above: 1.72, 1.19-2.47), and working at a hospital (referent fire-based agency; 1.53, 1.04-2.24). Additionally, vaccination odds were significantly higher with greater perceived risk of COVID-19 (2.05, 1.68-2.50), and higher vaccine confidence (2.84, 2.40-3.36). Odds of vaccination were significantly lower with higher medical mistrust (0.54, 0.46-0.63).Conclusion: Despite vaccine availability, not all EMS professionals had been vaccinated. The decision to receive a COVID-19 vaccine was associated with demographics, beliefs regarding COVID-19 and the vaccine, and medical mistrust. Efforts to increase COVID-19 vaccination rates should emphasize the safety and efficacy of vaccines.","Gregory, Megan E; Powell, Jonathan R; MacEwan, Sarah R; Kurth, Jordan D; Kenah, Eben; Panchal, Ashish R; McAlearney, Ann Scheck",Prehospital emergency care : official journal of the National Association of EMS Physicians and the National Association of State EMS Directors,838,17

However, a 'treat-to-target' management approach may help to address underlying inflammation, minimise disease activity at early stages of inflammatory bowel disease, limit progression, and improve long-term outcomes. METHODS A systematic literature review was conducted to identify data relevant to a treat-to-target approach in inflammatory bowel disease, published between January 1, 2007 and May 15, 2017. RESULTS Consistent with recommendations of the Selecting Therapeutic Targets in Inflammatory Bowel Disease [STRIDE] working group, studies have investigated factors influencing the achievement of both endoscopic and histological mucosal healing and patient-level outcomes in inflammatory bowel disease [IBD]. Histological healing and biomarker levels have also been shown to be modifiable outcomes. Although there is a lack of prospectively derived evidence validating mucosal healing as a treatment target, data are emerging to suggest that targeting mucosal healing or inflammation rather than symptoms may be cost-effective in some settings. The review highlighted several strategies that may support the implementation of a treat-to-target approach in IBD. The prospective randomised CALM study demonstrated how tight control [whereby treatment decisions are based on close monitoring of inflammatory biomarkers] leads to improvements in endoscopic and clinical outcomes. The review also considered the influence of coordinated care from a multidisciplinary team and patient engagement with improved adherence, as well as the role of therapeutic drug monitoring in inflammatory bowel disease management. CONCLUSIONS A treat-to-target strategy may impact on disease progression and improve outcomes in inflammatory bowel disease. Prospective studies including long-term data are required to ensure that the most appropriate targets and strategies are identified.","Colombel, Jean-Frédéric; D'haens, Geert; Lee, Wan-Ju; Petersson, Joel; Panaccione, Remo",Journal of Crohn's & colitis,838,24

The full-face snorkel masks were modified to be used as PPE. However, little is known about their use in medical practice. Methods: The available masks were assessed and compared in terms of safety, comfort, visual acuity, and communication with team members during the aerosol-generating surgical and endoscopic procedures. The masks were compared with a standard option (full-face shield and N95 mask). The score was assigned to each domain to compare the masks. The aim of the study was to assess the modified full-face snorkel masks as PPE during surgical and endoscopic aerosol-generating procedures. Results: Four modified snorkel masks were assessed and compared with the standard option. All masks provided a good seal, comfort, vision, and protection. Communication was the biggest problem and improved after modification. Suggestions for the mask's selection and on further improvements were made. Conclusion: The modified snorkel masks seem a good alternative to the standard PPE during aerosol-generating procedures. However, additional improvements are still needed. More studies are required to prove the benefits of the modified snorkel masks over the standard PPE.","Matsevych, Oleh Y; Koto, Modise Z; Balabyeki, Moses",Surgical innovation,838,19

METHODS We determined core and perfusion lesions in subjects from the WAKE-UP trial (Efficacy and Safety of MRI-Based Thrombolysis in Wake-Up Stroke) and AXIS 2 trial (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor in Patients With Acute Ischemic Stroke) with perfusion- and diffusion-weighted imaging at baseline. Only subjects with a mismatch volume >15 mL and ratio >1.2 were included. We created voxel-based relative fluid-attenuated inversion recovery signal intensity (rFLAIR SI) maps at baseline and follow-up. We studied rFLAIR SI in 2 regions of interest: baseline penumbra (baseline perfusion lesion-[core lesion+voxels with apparent diffusion coefficient <620 10-6 mm2/s]) and noninfarcted penumbra (baseline perfusion lesion-follow-up fluid-attenuated inversion recovery lesion) at 24 hours (WAKE-UP) or 30 days (AXIS 2). We analyzed the association between rFLAIR SI and severity of hypoperfusion, defined as time to maximum of the residue function. RESULTS In the baseline penumbra, rFLAIR SI was elevated (ratio, 1.04; P=1.7×10-13; n=126) and correlated with severity of hypoperfusion (Pearson r, 0.03; P<1.0×10-4; n=126). In WAKE-UP, imaging at 24 hours revealed a further increase of rFLAIR SI in the noninfarcted penumbra (ratio, 1.05 at 24 hours versus 1.03 at baseline; P=7.1×10-3; n=43). In AXIS 2, imaging at 30 days identified reversibility of the rFLAIR SI (ratio, 1.02 at 30 days versus 1.04 at baseline; P=1.5×10-3; n=26) since it was no longer different from 1 (ratio, 1.01 at 30 days; P=0.099; n=26). CONCLUSIONS Penumbral rFLAIR SI increases appear early after stroke onset, correlate with severity of hypoperfusion, further increase at 24 hours, and are reversible by 30 days.

We describe the development of an educational curriculum and quality improvement program to support continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) performed primarily by non-nephrology providers in Sri Lanka. METHODS We developed a program of education, outcome tracking, and expert consultation to support providers in Kandy, Sri Lanka. Education included videos and in-person didactics covering core topics in CAPD. Event-tracking sheets recorded root causes and management of infections and hospitalizations. Conferences reviewed clinical cases and overall clinic management. We evaluated the patient census, peritonitis rates, and root causes and management of infections over 1 year. RESULTS The curriculum was published through the International Society of Nephrology online academy. High provider turnover limited curriculum assessments. The CAPD patient census rose from 63 to 116 during the year. The peritonitis rate declined significantly, from 0.8 episodes per patient-year in the first 6 months to 0.4 in the latter 6 months, though the most common root causes of peritonitis, related to contamination events and hygiene, persisted. The appropriate ascertainment of culture data and prescription of antibiotics also increased. CONCLUSIONS Our project supported the expansion of a CAPD program in a resource-limited setting, while also improving peritonitis outcomes. Ongoing challenges include ensuring a durable educational system for rotating providers, tracking outcomes beyond peritonitis, and formalizing management protocols. Our program can serve as an example of how established dialysis programs can support the burgeoning work of providers in resource-limited setting.","Rope, Robert; Nanayakkara, Nishantha; Wazil, Abdul; Dickowita, Sewmini; Abeyeskera, Rajitha; Gunerathne, Lishanthe; Adoosoriya, Dinuka; Karunasena, Nishamani; Rathnayake, Chrarake; Anand, Shuchi; Saxena, Anjali",Peritoneal dialysis international : journal of the International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis,838,1

To determine the contamination of keyboard surface and the relative risk to transfer healthcare-associated pathogens to susceptible patients, as it frequently happens in Intensive Care Unit (ICU), a standard keyboard (SK), a cleanable keyless keyboard (KK) with smooth surface and a standard keyboard coated with a 3 M Tegaderm® film added with active essential oil (tea tree oil) (KTEO) were tested. S. aureus, including MRSA strains, were detected in ICU, with values ranging from 15% to 57%.

Similar Gram positive and Gram negative strains were found on all surfaces, but with low percentage, and only environmental bacteria were detected using the settling plates method. The Microbial Challenge Test performed on KTEO showed high rates of decrease for all the pathogens with statistical significance both at 24 and 48 h (p = 0.003* and p = 0.040*, respectively).

Previous work in both humans and non-human primates (NHPs) using resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) suggests that a subregion of PMC, the medial parieto-occipital cortex (mPOC), by virtue of its intrinsic functional connectivity (FC) with visual cortex, may only play a role in higher-order visual processing. Recent neuroanatomical tracer studies in NHPs, however, demonstrate that mPOC also has prominent cortico-cortical connections with several frontoparietal structures involved in movement planning and control, a finding consistent with increasing observations of reach- and grasp-related activity in the mPOC of both NHPs and humans. To reconcile these observations, here we used rs-fMRI data collected from both awake humans and anesthetized macaque monkeys to more closely examine and compare parcellations of mPOC across species and explore the FC patterns associated with these subdivisions. Seed-based and voxel-wise hierarchical cluster analyses revealed four broad spatially separated functional boundaries that correspond with graded differences in whole-brain FC patterns in each species. The patterns of FC observed are consistent with mPOC forming a critical hub of networks involved in action planning and control, spatial navigation, and working memory. In addition, our comparison between species indicates that while there are several similarities, there may be some species-specific differences in functional neural organization. These findings and the associated theoretical implications are discussed.","Hutchison, R Matthew; Culham, Jody C; Flanagan, J Randall; Everling, Stefan; Gallivan, Jason P",NeuroImage,838,1

Radionuclide molecular imaging of HER2 expression in disseminated PC would aid in the selection of patients who are likely responders to HER2 targeting therapy. In this study, we evaluated whether ABY-025 Affibody molecule, a small (∼ 7-kDa) HER2-binding scaffold protein, produces superior tumor-to-nontumor ratios compared with those obtained through the use of radiolabeled humanized anti-HER2 antibody, trastuzumab. The influence of (111)In vs. (125)I radiolabel was evaluated for both tracers. METHODS ABY-025 was labeled with (111)In using 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid chelator, site-specifically coupled to the C-terminus via the maleimido derivative. Trastuzumab was labeled with (111)In using a CHX-A″ diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA) chelator. An indirect radioiodination with [(125)I]-N-succinimidyl-para-iodobenzoate was used for both targeting proteins. Biodistribution of all labeled targeting proteins was evaluated in mice bearing DU-145 PC xenografts. RESULTS The use of residualizing (111)In-label facilitated better tumor uptake and better tumor-to-nontumor ratios for both targeting agents. [(111)In]-ABY-025 provided tumor uptake of 7.1±0.8% injected dose per gram of tissue (% ID/g) and tumor-to-blood ratio of 47±13 already at 6 h postinjection. The maximum tumor-to-nontumor ratios with [(111)In]-CHX-DTPA-trastuzumab were achieved at 72 h postinjection, whereas tumor uptake was 11±4% ID/g and tumor-to-blood ratio was 18±7. The biodistribution data were confirmed with gamma-camera imaging. CONCLUSIONS Radiolabeled ABY-025 Affibody molecule provides higher contrast in imaging of HER2-expressing PC xenografts than radiolabeled trastuzumab. Residualizing radiometal label for ABY-025 provides better contrast in imaging of HER2-expressing PC xenografts than nonresidualizing radiohalogen.","Malmberg, Jennie; Sandström, Mattias; Wester, Kenneth; Tolmachev, Vladimir; Orlova, Anna",Nuclear medicine and biology,838,29

However, its antigenic and immunogenic properties remain to be elucidated. In this study, we immunized mice with full-length S protein (FL-S) or its extracellular domain (EC-S) expressed by recombinant baculoviruses in insect cells. We found that the immunized mice developed high titers of anti-S antibodies with potent neutralizing activities against SARS pseudoviruses constructed with the S proteins of Tor2, GD03T13, and SZ3, the representative strains of 2002 to 2003 and 2003 to 2004 human SARS-CoV and palm civet SARS-CoV, respectively. These data suggest that the recombinant baculovirus-expressed S protein vaccines possess excellent immunogenicity, thereby inducing highly potent neutralizing responses against human and animal SARS-CoV variants. The antigenic structure of the S protein was characterized by a panel of 38 monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) isolated from the immunized mice. The epitopes of most anti-S MAbs (32 of 38) were localized within the S1 domain, and those of the remaining 6 MAbs were mapped to the S2 domain. Among the anti-S1 MAbs, 17 MAbs targeted the N-terminal region (amino acids [aa] 12 to 327), 9 MAbs recognized the receptor-binding domain (RBD; aa 318 to 510), and 6 MAbs reacted with the C-terminal region of S1 domain that contains the major immunodominant site (aa 528 to 635). Strikingly, all of the RBD-specific MAbs had potent neutralizing activity, 6 of which efficiently blocked the receptor binding, confirming that the RBD contains the main neutralizing epitopes and that blockage of the receptor association is the major mechanism of SARS-CoV neutralization. Five MAbs specific for the S1 N-terminal region exhibited moderate neutralizing activity, but none of the MAbs reacting with the S2 domain and the major immunodominant site in S1 showed neutralizing activity. All of the neutralizing MAbs recognize conformational epitopes. These data provide important information for understanding the antigenicity and immunogenicity of S protein and for designing SARS vaccines. This panel of anti-S MAbs can be used as tools for studying the structure and function of the SARS-CoV S protein.","He, Yuxian; Li, Jingjing; Heck, Susanne; Lustigman, Sara; Jiang, Shibo",Journal of virology,838,12

METHODS: Historical patterns were assessed by examining data on drug purchases from manufacturers using the IQVIA National Sales Perspectives database. Factors that may influence drug spending in hospitals and clinics in 2021 were reviewed-including new drug approvals, patent expirations, and potential new policies or legislation. Focused analyses were conducted for biosimilars, cancer drugs, generics, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic influence, and specialty drugs. For nonfederal hospitals, clinics, and overall (all sectors), estimates of growth of pharmaceutical expenditures in 2021 were based on a combination of quantitative analyses and expert opinion. RESULTS: In 2020, overall pharmaceutical expenditures in the United States grew 4.9% compared to 2019, for a total of $535.3 billion. Utilization (a 2.9% increase) and new drugs (a 1.8% increase) drove this increase, with price changes having minimal influence (a 0.3% increase). Adalimumab was the top drug in 2020, followed by apixaban and insulin glargine. Drug expenditures were $35.3 billion (a 4.6% decrease) and $98.4 billion (an 8.1% increase) in nonfederal hospitals and clinics, respectively. In clinics, growth was driven by new products and increased utilization, whereas in hospitals the decrease in expenditures was driven by reduced utilization. Several new drugs that will influence spending are expected to be approved in 2021. Specialty and cancer drugs will continue to drive expenditures along with the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: For 2021, we expect overall prescription drug spending to rise by 4% to 6%, whereas in clinics and hospitals we anticipate increases of 7% to 9% and 3% to 5%, respectively, compared to 2020. These national estimates of future pharmaceutical expenditure growth may not be representative of any particular health system because of the myriad of local factors that influence actual spending.","Tichy, Eric M; Hoffman, James M; Suda, Katie J; Rim, Matthew H; Tadrous, Mina; Cuellar, Sandra; Clark, John S; Wiest, Michelle D; Matusiak, Linda M; Schumock, Glen T",Am. j. health system pharm,838,12

On multivariate analysis, only rhinitis (odds ratio [OR]: 0.28; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.09-0.83; p = .02) thrombocytopenia (OR: 0.99; 95% CI: 0.99-0.99; p = .01) and elevated creatinine (OR: 7.6; 95% CI: 1.5-37.6; p = .01) remained significant. In this retrospective study of COVID-19 patients, we found anosmia and dysgeusia in more than 1/5th of the cases. Absence of rhinitis, low platelet counts and elevated creatinine were associated with anosmia or dysgeusia in these patients.","Dev, Nishanth; Sankar, Jhuma; Gupta, Nitesh; Meena, Ramesh Chand; Singh, Charanjit; Gupta, D K; Sen, M K",J Med Virol,838,30
