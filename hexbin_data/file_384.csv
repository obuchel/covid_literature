3013,3013,3013,Children’s Oxygen Administration Strategies Trial (COAST): A randomised controlled trial of high flow versus oxygen versus control in African children with severe pneumonia,19.470272,9.69513,2018-01-09,"Background: In Africa, the clinical syndrome of pneumonia remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in children in the post-neonatal period. This represents a significant burden on in-patient services. The targeted use of oxygen and simple, non-invasive methods of respiratory support may be a highly cost-effective means of improving outcome, but the optimal oxygen saturation threshold that results in benefit and the best strategy for delivery are yet to be tested in adequately powered randomised controlled trials. There is, however, an accumulating literature about the harms of oxygen therapy across a range of acute and emergency situations that have stimulated a number of trials investigating permissive hypoxia. Methods: 1. Liberal oxygenation (recommended care) compared with a strategy that permits hypoxia to SpO (2 )> or = 80% (permissive hypoxia); and 2. High flow using AIrVO (2) (TM) compared with low flow delivery (routine care). Discussion: The overarching objective is to address the key research gaps in the therapeutic use of oxygen in resource-limited setting in order to provide a better evidence base for future management guidelines. The trial has been designed to address the poor outcomes of children in sub-Saharan Africa, which are associated with high rates of in-hospital mortality, 9-10% (for those with oxygen saturations of 80-92%) and 26-30% case fatality for those with oxygen saturations <80%.

3162,3162,3162,Cancer patients with community-acquired pneumonia treated in intensive care have poorer outcomes associated with increased illness severity and septic shock at admission to intensive care: a retrospective cohort study,19.483109,10.832059,2015-12-01,"Patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and an underlying diagnosis of cancer have worse outcomes. However, the characteristics of cancer patients with CAP admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) are not well established. In a retrospective observational study, patients admitted to a London university hospital ICU between January 2006 and October 2011 with a primary diagnosis of CAP were included. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and outcome data were collected from the ICU and hospital pathology databases. The analysis included 96 patients with CAP, 19 of whom had an existing diagnosis of cancer. Patients with cancer had a longer median time interval between hospital and ICU admission (1 vs 2 days, p = 0.049). On admission to ICU, there were no differences in white cell count, C-reactive protein, clotting, renal function, liver function, heart rate, temperature, systolic blood pressure or oxygenation index between patients with or without cancer. However, patients with cancer had significantly lower haemoglobin levels (median 8.6 vs 10.0 g/dl, p = 0.010) and lowest diastolic blood pressure (median 40 vs 50 mmHg, p = 0.026), and higher sodium levels (median 142 vs 139 mmol/l), p = 0.020), APACHE II (median 25 vs 20, p = 0.009), SAPS II (median 51 vs 43, p = 0.039) and SOFA (median 12 vs 9, p = 0.018) scores. There were no statistically significant differences in the proportion of patients receiving mechanical ventilation or renal support, the duration of mechanical ventilation or ICU or hospital length of stay. Patients with cancer were more likely to receive vasopressors (89.5% vs 63.6%, p = 0.030) and had increased ICU (68.4% vs 31.2%, p = 0.004) and hospital (78.9% vs 33.8%, p = 0.001) mortality. The limitations of this study are its relatively small sample size and those associated with the retrospective study design. In conclusion, cancer patients with CAP had an increased risk of death that was associated with increased illness severity and prevalence of septic shock at the time of ICU admission, suggesting there may be a delay in recognition for the need for intensive care support in these patients.","José, Ricardo J.

Luciferase immunoprecipitation systems (LIPS), employing light-emitting proteins, were used to examine serum antibodies against several cancer-associated targets in blood donor controls and subjects with colon cancer (CC) and HNSCC. The assessment of antibodies against the wild type p53 tumor antigen showed that approximately 25% of the CC and 20% of the HNSCC patients were seropositive. In addition, humoral responses against two p53 mutants, p53-R175H and p53-R273H, generally tracked the antibody responses seen against wild type p53. Analysis of antibodies against highly specific biomarkers of HPV-16-associated malignancy, E2, E6, and E7 oncoproteins, revealed no seropositivity in blood donors and CC patients. However, 45% (9/20) of the HNSCC patients showed E6 seropositivity, which overlapped all the detectable E2 (40%; 8/20) and E7 seropositive subjects (35%; 7/20). Using neodymium magnets, ultrarapid LIPSTICKS testing of HPV-16 E6 antibodies in <60 s per HNSCC sample demonstrated almost the same diagnostic performance (40% sensitivity and 100% specificity) as LIPS testing in 2.5 h. While additional improvements and standardization are needed, these results highlight the possibility of using these approaches for the diagnosis of HPV-16-associated HNSCC.","Burbelo, Peter D.; Chaturvedi, Adrija; Notkins, Abner L.; Gunti, Sreenivasulu",Diagnostics (Basel),384,8

Influenza-related incidence data are limited in many countries in Africa despite established sentinel surveillance. This study aimed to address the information gap by estimating the burden and seasonality of medically attended influenza like illness in Ethiopia. METHOD: Influenza sentinel surveillance data collected from 3 influenza like illness (ILI) and 5 Severe Acute Respiratory Illness (SARI) sites from 2012 to 2017 was used for analysis. Descriptive statistics were applied for simple analysis. The proportion of medically attended influenza positive cases and incidence rate of ILI was determined using total admitted patients and catchment area population. Seasonality was estimated based on weekly trend of ILI and predicted threshold was done by applying the “Moving Epidemic Method (MEM)”. RESULT: A total of 5715 medically attended influenza suspected patients who fulfills ILI and SARI case definition (77% ILI and 23% SARI) was enrolled. Laboratory confirmed influenza virus (influenza positive case) among ILI and SARI suspected case was 25% (1130/4426) and 3% (36/1289). Of which, 65% were influenza type A. The predominantly circulating influenza subtype were seasonal influenza A(H3N2) (n = 455, 60%) and Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 (n = 293, 38.81%). The estimated mean annual influenza positive case proportion and ILI incidence rate was 160.04 and 52.48 per 100,000 population. The Incidence rate of ILI was higher in the age group of 15–44 years of age [‘Incidence rate (R) = 254.6 per 100,000 population’, 95% CI; 173.65, 335.55] and 5–14 years of age [R = 49.5, CI 95%; 31.47, 130.43]. The seasonality of influenza has two peak seasons; in a period from October–December and from April–June. CONCLUSION: Significant morbidity of influenza like illness was observed with two peak seasons of the year and seasonal influenza A (H3N2) remains the predominantly circulating influenza subtype. Further study need to be considered to identify potential risks and improving the surveillance system to continue early detection and monitoring of circulating influenza virus in the country has paramount importance.","Tadesse, Musse; Mengesha, Mesfin; Tayachew, Adamu; Belay, Desalegn; Hassen, Abdulhafiz; Woyessa, Abyot Bekele; Zemelak, Etsehiwot; Beyene, Berhan; Kassa, Wubayehu; Ayele, Workenesh; Teshome, Bethel; Mekonen, Mikias; Assefa, Zewdu; Moges, Beyene",BMC Infect Dis,384,31
4542,4542,4542,Mechanisms and pathways to impact in public health research: a preliminary analysis of research funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR),19.35695,1.7722743,2020-02-19,"This paper presents the performance of two eukaryotic genomic ribosomal regions, ITS1 and ITS2, in describing fungal diversity in aerosol samples using amplicon-based High-Throughput Sequencing (HTS). Composting sites, biomethanization facilities, and dairy farms, all affected by the presence of fungi, were visited to collect air samples. The amplicon-based HTS approach is a target enrichment method that relies on the amplification of a specific target using particular primers before sequencing. Thus, the results are highly dependent on the quality of amplification. For this reason, the authors of this paper used a shotgun metagenomic approach to compare its outcome with the amplicon-based method. Indeed, shotgun metagenomic does not rely on any amplification prior to sequencing, because all genes are sequenced without a specific target. In addition, culture methods were added to the analyses in biomethanization and dairy farms samples to validate their contribution to fungal diversity of aerosols. The results obtained are unequivocal towards ITS1 outperformance to ITS2 in terms of richness, and taxonomic coverage. The differential abundance analysis did demonstrate that some taxa were exclusively detected only by ITS2, and vice-versa for ITS1. However, the shotgun metagenomic approach showed a taxonomic profile more resembling to ITS1 than ITS2. Based on these results, neither of the barcodes evaluated is perfect in terms of distinguishing all species. Using both barcodes offers a broader view of the fungal aerosol population. However, with the actual knowledge, the authors strongly recommend using ITS1 as a universal fungal barcode for quick general analyses of diversity and when limited financial resources are available, primarily due its ability to capture taxonomic profiles similar to those obtained using the shotgun metagenomic. The culture comparison with amplicon-based sequencing showed the complementarity of both approaches in describing the most abundant taxa.","Mbareche, Hamza; Veillette, Marc; Bilodeau, Guillaume; Duchaine, Caroline",PeerJ,384,5

Normally, these cells do not traverse the blood-brain barrier at appreciable levels and, as such, IFN-γ is generally undetectable within the central nervous system (CNS). Nevertheless, in response to CNS infections, as well as during certain disorders in which the CNS is affected, T-cell traffic across the blood-brain barrier increases considerably, thereby exposing neuronal and glial cells to the potent effects of IFN-γ. A large portion of this article is devoted to the substantial circumstantial and experimental evidence that suggests that IFN-γ plays an important role in the pathogenesis of the demyelinating disorder multiple sclerosis (MS) and its animal model experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE). Moreover, the biochemical and physiological effects of IFN-γ are discussed in the context of the potential consequences of such activities on the developing and mature nervous systems.","Popko, Brian; Corbin, Joshua G.; Baerwald, Kristine D.; Dupree, Jeffrey; Garcia, Annie M.",Mol Neurobiol,384,12

In addition to activating the complement, MBL can induce cytokine production and contribute to a deleterious inflammatory response with severe A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection. Our aim was to determine if serum MBL levels correlate with the risk of mortality in intensive care units (ICU) patients with A(H1N1)pdm09 infection. METHODS: Prospective observational study was performed in ICU patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome due to influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus. Demographic characteristics and severity indices were recorded at ICU admission. MBL was assayed from blood drawn at influenza diagnosis within 24–48 h following the ICU admission. Outcomes were compared according to MBL levels. Results are expressed as median and interquartile range. RESULTS: Serum MBL levels were studied in 27 patients (age: 56 [IQR 29] years) with severe A(H1N1)pdm09 infection and in 70 healthy controls. Median admission SAPSII and SOFA scores were 49 [IQR 26] and 12 [IQR 5], respectively. Mortality rate after a 30-day was 37%. MBL was significantly higher in non-survivors (3741 [IQR 2336] ng/ml) vs survivors (215 [IQR 1307] ng/ml), p = 0.006, as well as control group (1814 [IQR 2250] ng/ml), p = 0.01. In contrast, MBL levels in survivors group were significantly lower than the controls group (215 [IQR 1307] ng/ml vs. 1814 [IQR 2250] ng/ml, p = 0.005). MBL cut-off > 1870 ng/ml had a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 88.2% for mortality [AUC = 0.82 (95% CI 0.63–0.94)]. Kaplan–Meier analysis demonstrated a strong association between MBL levels and mortality (log-rank 7.8, p = 0.005). MBL > 1870 ng/ml was independently associated with mortality (HR = 8.7, 95% CI 1.2–29.1, p = 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that baseline MBL > 1870 ng/ml is associated with higher mortality in ICU patients with severe A(H1N1)pdm09 infection.","Zogheib, Elie; Nyga, Remy; Cornu, Marjorie; Sendid, Boualem; Monconduit, Julien; Jounieaux, Vincent; Maizel, Julien; Segard, Christine; Chouaki, Taïeb; Dupont, Hervé",Lung,384,12

However, ASD may contribute to deteriorating health in the presence of significant comorbidity and, thus, may need earlier closure. There is a lack of clarity regarding the indications for and outcomes after ASD closure in infancy and early childhood. We investigated the benefits and safety of surgical ASD closure in symptomatic patients under 2 years of age. Retrospective chart review was conducted in patients who underwent surgical ASD closure within the first 2 years of life. Of 31 symptomatic ASD patients, 22 had persistent respiratory symptoms, 24 failure to thrive, and 9 pulmonary hypertension. Overall, 26 patients (84.0%) showed clinical improvement after ASD closure, including improved respiratory status (17/22; 77.3%), resumption of normal growth (15/24; 62.5%), and resolution of pulmonary hypertension (7/7; 100%, 2 patients unable to assess postoperatively). Two medically complicated patients died a few months after surgery unrelated to surgical complications. Four out of 8 ventilator-dependent patients were weaned from mechanical ventilation within 1 month after ASD closure. Closure of ASD did not improve those patients with highly advanced lung disease and/or medically complex conditions including underlying genetic abnormalities. Surgical complications were uncommon. Postoperative hospital stay was 4 to 298 days (median 8 days). The majority of our patients demonstrated significant clinical improvement after ASD closure. Early ASD closure is safe and beneficial for symptomatic infants and young children with associated underlying pulmonary abnormalities, especially bronchopulmonary dysplasia.","Tsuda, Takeshi; Davies, Ryan R.; Radtke, Wolfgang; Pizarro, Christian; Bhat, Abdul M.",Pediatr Cardiol,384,12

Activation of the innate immune response is important for controlling early virus replication and spread. It is unclear how early IAV replication events contribute to immune detection. Additionally, while many cell types in the lung can be infected, it is not known if all cell types contribute equally to establish the antiviral state in the host. Here, we use single-cycle influenza A viruses (scIAVs) to characterize the early immune response to IAV in vitro and in vivo. We found that the magnitude of virus replication contributes to antiviral gene expression within infected cells prior to the induction of a global response. We also developed a scIAV that is only capable of undergoing primary transcription, the earliest stage of virus replication. Using this tool, we uncovered replication stage-specific responses in vitro and in vivo. Using several innate immune receptor knockout cell lines, we identify RIG-I as the predominant antiviral detector of primary virus transcription and amplified replication in vitro. Through a Cre-inducible reporter mouse, we used scIAVs expressing Cre-recombinase to characterize cell type-specific responses in vivo. Individual cell types upregulate unique sets of antiviral genes in response to both primary virus transcription and amplified replication. We also identified antiviral genes that are only upregulated in response to direct infection. Altogether, these data offer insight into the early mechanisms of antiviral gene activation during influenza A infection.","Fay, Elizabeth J.; Aron, Stephanie L.; Macchietto, Marissa G.; Markman, Matthew W.; Esser-Nobis, Katharina; Gale, Michael; Shen, Steven; Langlois, Ryan A.",PLoS Pathog,384,21

CPE courses are now offered in nearly all college programs as either required or electives classes. Two decades later, the high school CPE innovation began, and Kindergarten-8 programs followed. In this commentary, I argue that historian Roberta Park was correct in her assessment that physical education has the potential to be the renaissance field of the 21st century. Scientific contributions of researchers in kinesiology will lead the way, but science-based CPE and companion fitness education (FE) programs that align with physical education content standards and FE benchmarks will play a significant role.

We aimed to investigate soluble programmed death receptor ligand 1 (sPD-L1) as systemic inflammation parameter in patients with brain tumour. METHODS: EDTA plasma was collected from 81 glioma (55 glioblastoma (GBM), 26 lower-grade glioma (LGG)), 17 meningioma and 44 brain metastasis (BM) patients and 24 controls. sPD-L1 concentrations were determined by ELISA. Correlations with the local tumour microenvironment were assessed by immunohistochemical analysis for PD-L1, CD3 and CD8. RESULTS: sPD-L1 was detected in 62 out of 166 (37.7%) patients (glioma: 41/81, 50.6%; meningioma: 5/17, 29.4%; BM: 7/44, 15.9%; controls: 9/24, 37.5%; p=0.002). sPD-L1 concentrations were lower in BM than in LGG (p=0.003) or GBM (p<0.001). Membranous PD-L1 expression on tumour cells was not associated with sPD-L1 concentrations (p=0.953). sPD-L1 concentration was inversely correlated with the density of CD8+ (r=−0.713, p=0.001) and CD3+ (r=−0.484, p=0.042) tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes in LGG. sPD-L1 is correlated with neutrophil counts (r=−0.318, p=0.045) and C reactive protein levels (r=−0.363, p=0.008) in GBM. sPD-L1+ patients had longer overall survival in GBM (p=0.006) and worse OS in LGG (p=0.028).

PURPOSES: By using AI to synthesize and interpret behavior change intervention evaluation report findings at a scale beyond human capability, the HBCP seeks to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of research activities. We explore challenges facing AI adoption in behavioral science through the lens of lessons learned during the Human Behaviour-Change Project (HBCP). METHODS: The project used an iterative cycle of development and testing of AI algorithms. Using a corpus of published research reports of randomized controlled trials of behavioral interventions, behavioral science experts annotated occurrences of interventions and outcomes. AI algorithms were trained to recognize natural language patterns associated with interventions and outcomes from the expert human annotations. Once trained, the AI algorithms were used to predict outcomes for interventions that were checked by behavioral scientists. RESULTS: Intervention reports contain many items of information needing to be extracted and these are expressed in hugely variable and idiosyncratic language used in research reports to convey information makes developing algorithms to extract all the information with near perfect accuracy impractical. However, statistical matching algorithms combined with advanced machine learning approaches created reasonably accurate outcome predictions from incomplete data. CONCLUSIONS: AI holds promise for achieving the goal of predicting outcomes of behavior change interventions, based on information that is automatically extracted from intervention evaluation reports. This information can be used to train knowledge systems using machine learning and reasoning algorithms.","Mac Aonghusa, Pol; Michie, Susan",Ann Behav Med,384,12

Blood RNA is an important biological resource for precision medicine and translational medicine. However, few studies have assessed the human transcriptome profiles and microbial communities composition and diversity of peripheral blood from different cell isolation methods, which could affect the reproducibility of researches. We collected peripheral blood from three healthy donors and processed it immediately. We used RNA sequencing to investigate the effect of three leukocyte isolation methods including buffy coat (BC) extraction, red blood cell (RBC) lysis and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) isolation with the comparison with whole blood (WB), through analyzing the sensitivity of gene detection, the whole transcriptome profiling and microbial composition and diversity. Our data showed that BC extraction with high globin mRNA mapping rate had similar transcriptome profiles with WB, while RBC lysis and PBMC isolation depleted RBCs effectively. With the efficient depletion of RBC and distinct compositions of leukocyte subsets, RNA-seq of RBC lysis and PBMC isolation uniquely detected genes from specific cell types, like granulocytes and NK cells. In addition, we observed that the microbial composition and diversity were more affected by individuals than isolation methods. Our results showed that blood cell isolations could largely influence the sensitivity of detection of human genes and transcriptome profile.

Better knowledge of this pathogen is required in order to enhance the patient’s treatment and care. In this article, we studied the bacteriological profile and virulence factors of S. aureus-related VAP on a 3-year period. We included a collection of S. aureus strains (n = 35) isolated from respiratory samples from patients diagnosed with VAP in the intensive care units. We studied the bacteriological aspects and we searched for the presence of virulence factors (SpA, FnbpA, Hla, and PVL genes) in the strains, and we also studied the clinical and biological aspects of the infections. The average age of our patients was of 36 years and they were predominantly males (sex ratio = 3.37). A severe head trauma or a history of coma was noted in 73.43% of the patients. The average duration of ventilation was 29 days. Among the studied strains, five were Methicillin-resistant S. aureus of which three expressed the mecA gene. Overall, the Hla gene was detected in 85.7% of the strains and it was more prevalent in Methicillin-susceptible than Methicillin-resistant strains (93.3% versus 40%; P = 0.014). FnbpA, Spa, and PVL genes were detected, respectively, in 80%, 45.7%, and 20% of the strains. Therefore, our studied strains were essentially associated with the production of Hla and FnbpA genes. It is, however, important to elucidate their expression in order to establish their role in the VAP pathogenesis.","Tilouche, Lamia; Ben Dhia, Refka; Boughattas, Sameh; Ketata, Soumaya; Bouallegue, Olfa; Chaouch, Cherifa; Boujaafar, Noureddine",Curr Microbiol,384,31

Increasing knowledge of the human response to HTNV infection can guide the development of new preventative vaccines and therapeutic strategies. Here, we show that HTNV can infect CD8(+) T cells in vivo in patients diagnosed with hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS). Electron microscopy-mediated tracking of the life cycle and ultrastructure of HTNV-infected CD8(+) T cells in vitro showed an association between notable increases in cytoplasmic multivesicular bodies and virus production. Notably, based on a clinical cohort of 280 patients, we found that circulating HTNV-infected CD8(+) T cell numbers in blood were proportional to disease severity. These results demonstrate that viral infected CD8(+) T cells may be used as an adjunct marker for monitoring HFRS disease progression and that modulating T cell functions may be explored for new treatment strategies.","Liu, Rongrong; Ma, Ruixue; Liu, Ziyu; Hu, Haifeng; Shu, Jiayi; Hu, Peizhen; Kang, Junjun; Zhang, Yusi; Han, Mingwei; Zhang, Xiaoxiao; Zheng, Yiting; Ying, Qikang; Hou, Shiyuan; Wang, Wenqiu; Wang, Fang; Cheng, Ning; Zhuang, Yan; Lian, Jianqi; Jin, Xia; Wu, Xingan",Commun Biol,384,21

The unique inward rectification characteristics of the hERG channel depend on the gating regulation, which involves crucial structural domains and key single amino acid residues in the full-length hERG channel. Identifying critical molecules involved in the regulation of gating kinetics for the hERG channel requires high-resolution structures and molecular dynamics simulation models. Based on the latest progress in hERG structure and molecular dynamics simulation research, summarizing the molecules involved in the changes in the channel state helps to elucidate the unique gating characteristics of the channel and the reason for its high affinity to cardiotoxic drugs. In this review, we aim to summarize the significant advances in understanding the voltage gating regulation of the hERG channel based on its structure obtained from cryo-electron microscopy and computer simulations, which reveal the critical roles of several specific structural domains and amino acid residues.","Zequn, Zheng; Jiangfang, Lian",Front Pharmacol,384,22

Forecasting its epidemic trends is greatly instrumental in informing vaccine and targeted interventions. This study sets out to investigate the usefulness of an advanced exponential smoothing state space framework by combining Box-Cox transformations, Fourier representations with time-varying coefficients and autoregressive moving average (ARMA) error correction (TBATS) method to assess the temporal trends of HFMD in China. METHODS: Data from January 2009 to December 2019 were drawn, and then they were split into two segments comprising the in-sample training data and out-of-sample testing data to develop and validate the TBATS model, and its fitting and forecasting abilities were compared with the most frequently used seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) method. RESULTS: Following the modelling procedures of the SARIMA and TBATS methods, the SARIMA (1,0,1)(0,1,1)(12) and TBATS (0.024, {1,1}, 0.855, {<12,4>}) specifications were recognized as being the optimal models, respectively, for the 12-step ahead forecasting, along with the SARIMA (1,0,1)(0,1,1)(12) and TBATS (0.062, {1,3}, 0.86, {<12,4>}) models as being the optimal models, respectively, for the 24-step ahead forecasting. Among them, the optimal TBATS models produced lower error rates in both 12-step and 24-step ahead forecasting aspects compared to the preferred SARIMA models. Descriptive analysis of the data showed a significantly high level and a marked dual seasonal pattern in the HFMD morbidity. CONCLUSION: The TBATS model has the capacity to outperform the most frequently used SARIMA model in forecasting the HFMD incidence in China, and it can be recommended as a flexible and useful tool in the decision-making process of HFMD prevention and control in China.","Yu, Chongchong; Xu, Chunjie; Li, Yuhong; Yao, Sanqiao; Bai, Yichun; Li, Jizhen; Wang, Lei; Wu, Weidong; Wang, Yongbin",Infect Drug Resist,384,12

The algorithm has been developed using the context aggregation network architecture; it requires a single input grayscale image to predict an output phase profile through deep learning-based pattern recognition. Surface plasmon resonance imaging has been employed as an example to demonstrate the capability of the deep learning-based method. The phase profiles of the surface plasmon resonance phenomena have been very well established and cover ranges of phase transitions from 0 to 2π rad. We demonstrate that deep learning can be developed and trained using simulated data. Experimental validation and a theoretical framework to characterize and quantify the performance of the deep learning-based phase retrieval method are reported. The proposed deep learning-based phase retrieval performance was verified through the shot noise model and Monte Carlo simulations. Refractive index sensing performance comparing the proposed deep learning algorithm and conventional surface plasmon resonance measurements are also discussed. Although the proposed phase retrieval-based algorithm cannot achieve a typical detection limit of 10(–7) to 10(–8) RIU for phase measurement in surface plasmon interferometer, the proposed artificial-intelligence-based approach can provide at least three times lower detection limit of 4.67 × 10(–6) RIU compared to conventional intensity measurement methods of 1.73 × 10(–5) RIU for the optical energy of 2500 pJ with no need for sophisticated optical interferometer instrumentation.","Thadson, Kitsada; Visitsattapongse, Sarinporn; Pechprasarn, Suejit",Sci Rep,384,1

One hundred forty-eight rodents were captured and studied for body and cranio-mandibular measurements. The study found R. norvregicus as the most prevalent rodent in Qatar. Most of the rodents were collected from Al Rayan municipality, were adults, and were from livestock farms. The rodents’ average body weights were 18.8 ± 2.2 gm, 264.3 ± 87.5 gm, and 130 ± 71.3 gm for M. musculus, R. norvegicus, and R. rattus, respectively. The average morphometric measurements of the external body and skull were normally distributed and can be used as a reference of R. norvegicus and R. rattus for Qatar. ABSTRACT: The current study was undertaken to estimate the morphometric pattern of three commensal rodents, i.e., Mus musculus, Rattus norvegicus, and Rattus rattus in Qatar. One hundred forty-eight rodents were captured from different facilities throughout Qatar. The captured rodents were used to identify the external body and cranio-mandibular morphometry. The study found that R. norvregicus was the most prevalent (n = 120, 81%, 95% CI: 73.83–87.05). Most of the rodents were collected from Al Rayan municipality (n = 92, 62%), were adults (n = 138, 93.2%, 95% CI: 87.92–96.71), and were from livestock farms (n = 79, 49%, 95% CI: 41.02–57.65). The rodents’ average body weights were 18.8 ± 2.2 gm, 264.3 ± 87.5 gm, and 130 ± 71.3 gm for M. musculus, R. norvegicus, and R. rattus, respectively. The research found that the studied rodents are smaller than those of other countries such as Turkey, Tunisia, and Iran. The study of morphometry is a useful tool for the traditional identification of small mammal species, including rodents. The average morphometric measurements of the external body and skull were normally distributed and can be used as a reference of R. norvegicus and R. rattus for Qatar. A further comprehensive study is required to investigate the rodent population index, eco-friendly control program, and public health importance in Qatar.","Islam, Md Mazharul; Farag, Elmoubashar; Mahmoudi, Ahmad; Hassan, Mohammad Mahmudul; Atta, Muzzamil; Mostafavi, Ehsan; Alnager, Ismail Alnour; Farrag, Hassan Ali; Eljack, Gaafar El Awad; Bansal, Devendra; Haroun, Mohamed; Abdeen, Randa; Al-Romaihi, Hamad; Al-Zeyara, Abdul Aziz; Almalki, Sowaid Ali; Mkhize-Kwitshana, Zilungile",Animals (Basel),384,22

Studies have shown that serum and plasma miRNAs have the potential to be promising biomarkers for cancer diagnosis. This meta-analysis aimed to assess the diagnostic and prognostic performance of exosomal miRNAs in thyroid cancer. Our study analysis included 12 articles. We found that specific exosomal miRNAs found in blood provide high diagnostic value with high sensitivity and specificity. Furthermore, certain panels of exosomal microRNAs showed remarkable diagnostic value. The best discriminative ability to differentiate between cancer and non-cancer individuals were for miR-146b-5p + miR-223-5p + miR-182-5p. The novel and non-invasive use of miRNAs to diagnose TC can significantly improve patient outcomes by preventing the burden of unnecessary surgery and providing prognosis information on thyroid cancer. ABSTRACT: Circulatory tumor-derived exosomal microRNAs (miRNAs) play key roles in cancer development/progression. We aimed to assess the diagnostic/prognostic value of circulating exosomal miRNA in thyroid cancer (TC). A search in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Science Direct up to 22 May 2021 was performed. The true/false positive (TP/FP) and true/false negative (TN/FN) rates were extracted from each eligible study to obtain the pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive/negative likelihood ratios (PLR/NLR), diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), and their 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs). The meta-analysis included 12 articles consisting of 1164 Asian patients and 540 controls. All miRNAs were quantified using qRT-PCR assays. The pooled sensitivity was 82% (95%CI = 77–86%), pooled specificity was 76% (95%CI = 71–80%), and pooled DOR was 13.6 (95%CI = 8.8–21.8). The best biomarkers with high sensitivity were miR-16-2-3p (94%), miR-223-5p (91%), miR-130a-3p (90%), and miR182-5p (94%). Similarly, they showed high specificity, in addition to miR-34c-5p. Six panels of two to four exosomal miRNAs showed higher diagnostic values with an area under the curve (AUC) ranging from 0.906 to 0.981. The best discriminative ability to differentiate between cancer and non-cancer individuals was observed for miR-146b-5p + miR-223-5p + miR-182-5p (AUC = 0.981, sensitivity = 93.8% (84.9–98.3), specificity = 92.9% (76.5–99.1)). In conclusion, the expression levels of exosomal miRNAs could predict TC.","Toraih, Eman A.; Elshazli, Rami M.; Trinh, Lily N.; Hussein, Mohammad H.; Attia, Abdallah A.; Ruiz, Emmanuelle M.

A study by Ogen (Sci Total Environ 726:138605, 2020a) explored the possible correlation between coronavirus fatality and high nitrogen dioxide exposure in four European countries—France, Germany, Italy and Spain. Meanwhile, another study showed the importance of nitrogen dioxide along with population density in determining the coronavirus pandemic rate in England. In this follow-up study, Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) was introduced in conjunction with other variables like nitrogen dioxide and population density for further analysis in fifty-four administrative regions of Germany, Italy and Spain. The AOD values were extracted from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard the Terra and Aqua satellites while the nitrogen dioxide data were extracted from TROPOMI (TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument) sensor onboard the Sentinel-5 Precursor satellite. Regression models, as well as multiple statistical tests were used to evaluate the predictive skill and significance of each variable to the fatality rate.

Some of the results pointed towards AOD potentially being a factor in estimating the coronavirus fatality rate. The models performed better using the data collected during the complete exposure period, which showed higher AOD values contributed to an increased significance of AOD in the models.

The worldwide impact of COVID-19 resulted in the rapid global digital publication of numerous English-language children’s picture books aimed at informing child readers about public health concerns and how children could contribute to improving health outcomes. This exploration of contemporary picture books is intertwined with examinations of two other public health crises that appeared in literature for children: the discussion of British children’s health in the Junior Red Cross Magazine in the 1920s and the American polio outbreak discussed in educational materials and fiction in the 1940s and 1950s. These comparisons not only enable us to situate the COVID-19 pandemic within a history of transnational responses to concerns about children’s health but also to expand our understanding of how children are positioned to take individual responsibility for community public health issues. This wide range of Anglophone texts published in the United Kingdom, the United States, and around the world demonstrates the extent to which adults attempt to guide children towards specific behaviours to promote individual health.

Mounting evidence indicate that neovascularization is a critical defensive reaction to hypoxia that modulates the process of long-term neurologic recovery after IS. Angiogenesis is a complex process in which the original endothelial cells in blood vessels are differentiated, proliferated, migrated, and finally remolded into new blood vessels. Many immune cells and cytokines, as well as growth factors, are directly or indirectly involved in the regulation of angiogenesis. Inflammatory cells can affect endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and activation by secreting a variety of cytokines via various inflammation-relative signaling pathways and thus participate in the process of angiogenesis. However, the mechanism of inflammation-mediated angiogenesis has not been fully elucidated. Hence, this review aimed to discuss the mechanism of inflammation-mediated angiogenesis in IS and to provide new ideas for clinical treatment of IS.","Zhu, Hua; Zhang, Yonggang; Zhong, Yi; Ye, Yingze; Hu, Xinyao; Gu, Lijuan; Xiong, Xiaoxing",Front Cell Neurosci,384,20

Owing to participation of multiple qualitative and quantitative attributes, the low-carbon tourism strategy (LCTS) selection process can be considered as multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem. As uncertainty is usually occurred in LCTSs evaluation, the theory of interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IVIFSs) has been established as more flexible and efficient tool to model the uncertain decision-making problems. The idea of the present study is to develop an extended method using additive ratio assessment (ARAS) framework and similarity measures in a way to find an effective solution to the decision-making problems using IVIFSs. The bases of the proposed method are the IVIFSs operators, some modifications in the traditional ARAS framework and a calculation procedure of the weights of the criteria. To calculate criterion weight, new similarity measures for IVIFSs are developed aiming at the achievement of more realistic weights. Also, a comparison is demonstrated to the currently used similarity measures in order to show the efficiency of the developed approach. To confirm that the developed IVIF-ARAS approach can be successfully employed to practical decision-making problems, a case study of LCTS selection problem is considered. The final results from the developed approach and the extant models are compared for the validation of the proposed approach in this study.","Mishra, Arunodaya Raj; Chandel, Ayushi; Saeidi, Parvaneh",Environ Dev Sustain,384,26

METHODS Twelve human donor corneas ineligible for transplantation were divided into 2 groups, A and B. Group A: 2 ""healthy"" corneas, which were used to validate the laser parameters; group B: 10 corneas with endothelial guttae, which were used to perform a 4-mm descemetorhexis. Slit-lamp photography, light microscopy, corneal endothelial microscopy, Scheimpflug imaging, optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging, and histological staining were performed to visualize the efficacy of slit-lamp Nd:YAG laser removal of Descemet membrane and to assess potential tissue damage to the overlying stroma and peripheral endothelium. RESULTS In all corneas, an Nd:YAG laser 4-mm central descemetorhexis could be consistently performed. The total energy required ranged from 1143 to 2784 mJ. Side effects such as stromal pitting and corneal swelling were observed. CONCLUSIONS Creating a central descemetorhexis with a slit-lamp Nd:YAG laser proved feasible in vitro. This new technical approach might open the door to a customized in vivo ""descemetorhexis-only"" treatment for Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy eyes, while avoiding the risks associated with intraocular surgery.","Dragnea, Diana C; Ní Dhubhghaill, Sorcha; Bourgonje, Vincent J A; Dapena, Isabel; Oellerich, Silke; Melles, Gerrit R J; Lavy, Itay",Cornea,384,1

SARS-CoV-2 utilizes metallocarboxyl peptidase angiotensin receptor (ACE) 2 to gain entry into human cells. Activation of several proteases facilitates the interaction of viral spike proteins (S1) and ACE2 receptor. This leads to cleavage of host ACE2 receptors. ACE2 activity counterbalances the angiotensin II effect, its loss may lead to elevated angiotensin II levels with modulation of platelet function, size and activity. COVID-19 disease encompasses a spectrum of systemic involvement far beyond respiratory failure alone. Several features of this disease, including the etiology of acute kidney injury (AKI) and the hypercoagulable state, remain poorly understood. Here, we show that there is a high incidence of AKI (81%) in the critically ill adults with COVID-19 in the setting of elevated D-dimer, elevated ferritin, C reactive protein (CRP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels. Strikingly, there were unique features of platelets in these patients, including larger, more granular platelets and a higher mean platelet volume (MPV). There was a significant correlation between measured D-dimer levels and MVP; but a negative correlation between MPV and glomerular filtration rates (GFR) in critically ill cohort. Our data suggest that activated platelets may play a role in renal failure and possibly hypercoagulability status in COVID19 patients.","Taha, Muhanad; Sano, Dahlia; Hanoudi, Samer; Esber, Zahia; Elahi, Morvarid; Gabali, Ali; Chopra, Teena; Draghici, Sorin; Samavati, Lobelia",Platelets,384,1

As tumor size and location can affect ablation results, procedural planning needs to identify these factors to limit treatment to a single session and increase ablation success. PURPOSE To identify factors that may affect the primary efficacy of complete renal tumor ablation with radiofrequency after a single session. MATERIAL AND METHODS Percutaneous RFA (using an impedance based system) was performed using computed tomography (CT) guidance. Fifty-two renal tumors (in 44 patients) were retrospectively studied (median follow-up, 7 months). Data collection included patient demographics, tumor data (modified Renal Nephrometry Score, histopathological diagnosis), RFA treatment data (electrode placement), and follow-up results (tumor relapse). Data were analyzed through generalized estimating equations. RESULTS Primary efficacy rate was 83%. Predictors for complete ablation were optimal electrode placement (P = 0.002, OR = 16.67) and increasing distance to the collecting system (P = 0.02, OR = 1.18). Tumor size was not a predictor for complete ablation (median size, 24 mm; P = 0.069, OR = 0.47), but all tumors ≤2 cm were completely ablated. All papillary tumors and oncocytomas were completely ablated in a single session; the most common incompletely ablated tumor type was clear cell carcinoma (6 of 9). CONCLUSION Optimal electrode placement and a long distance from the collecting system are associated with an increased primary efficacy of renal tumor RFA. These variables need to be considered to increase primary ablation success. Further studies are needed to evaluate the effect of RFA on histopathologically different renal tumors.","Acosta Ruiz, Vanessa; Lönnemark, Maria; Brekkan, Einar; Dahlman, Pär; Wernroth, Lisa; Magnusson, Anders",Acta radiologica,384,5

A nitrogen rich COP (CGP) has been synthesized via SNAr reaction of cyanuric chloride with guanidinium hydrochloride. The successful confinement of COP with Ni nanoparticles through post-synthetic transformations (Ni@CGP) provides excellent catalytic activity for the transformation of aryl halides into diaryl selenides using elemental selenium powder. The synthetic transformations are well confirmed using various modern analytical and spectroscopic techniques which reveal high chemical and thermal durability. The N-rich framework of CGP fortifies the confinement of Ni NPs. Ni@CGP provides an efficient approach for diaryl selenides synthesis using a very cheap selenating reagent under water benign solvent conditions (DMSO : H2O) at room temperature with high reusability.

We present the results of a large single-center series of patients treated with the PED, including long-term follow-up. MATERIALS AND METHODS Between November 2008 and September 2011, sidewall aneurysms with a wide neck (≥4 mm) or unfavorable dome-neck ratio (≤1.5); large/giant, fusiform, dissecting, blister-like, and recurrent sidewall aneurysms; aneurysms at difficult angles; and aneurysms in which a branch was originating directly from the sac were treated with the PED. Patients were premedicated with dual antiplatelet medications. Data, including demographics, aneurysm features, clinical presentation, complications, results, and follow-up information, for up to 2 years are presented. RESULTS Two hundred fifty-one aneurysms in 191 patients were treated. Of these, 96 (38.3%) were large or giant (≥10 mm). In 34/251 (13.5%), PEDs were used for retreatment. Adjunctive coiling was performed in 11 aneurysms (2.1%). The mean number of devices per aneurysm was 1.3. One aneurysm ruptured in the fourth month posttreatment (0.5%), and symptomatic in-construct stenosis was detected in 1 patient (0.5%) treated with percutaneous transarterial angioplasty. Any event rate was 27/191 (14.1%), with a permanent morbidity of 1% and mortality of 0.5%. Control angiography was available in 182 (95.3%) patients with 239 (95.2%) aneurysms. In 121 aneurysms (48.2%), 1- to 2-year control angiography was available. The aneurysm occlusion rate was 91.2% in 6 months, increasing to 94.6%.

Of the gammacoronaviruses that mainly infect birds, little is known about the activation of the host immune response. We show that the prototypical Gammacoronavirus, infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), induces a delayed activation of the IFN response in primary renal cells, tracheal epithelial cells, and a chicken cell line. In fact, Ifnβ expression is delayed with respect to the peak of viral replication and the accompanying accumulation of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). In addition, we demonstrate that MDA5 is the primary sensor for Gammacoronavirus infections in chicken cells. Furthermore, we provide evidence that accessory proteins 3a and 3b of IBV modulate the response at the transcriptional and translational levels. Finally, we show that, despite the lack of activation of the IFN response during the early phase of IBV infection, the signaling of nonself dsRNA through both MDA5 and TLR3 remains intact in IBV-infected cells. Taken together, this study provides the first comprehensive analysis of host-virus interactions of a Gammacoronavirus with avian innate immune responses. IMPORTANCE Our results demonstrate that IBV has evolved multiple strategies to avoid the activation of the type I interferon response. Taken together, the present study closes a gap in the understanding of host-IBV interaction and paves the way for further characterization of the mechanisms underlying immune evasion strategies as well as the pathogenesis of gammacoronaviruses.","Kint, Joeri; Fernandez-Gutierrez, Marcela; Maier, Helena J; Britton, Paul; Langereis, Martijn A; Koumans, Joseph; Wiegertjes, Geert F; Forlenza, Maria",Journal of virology,384,17

METHODS This systematic review (PROSPERO: CRD42020210643) is according to PRISMA guidelines. PubMed, Cochrane, SciELO, Lilacs, Web of Science, and DOAJ databases were used. Clinical trials and research articles studying receptors related to COVID-19 were included in this review. R programming language was used to elaborate charts and receptors network and SPSS(26v) software was used to perform statistical analyses. RESULTS The majority of studies regarding the involvement of receptors in COVID-19 included plasma receptors and G protein-coupled receptor families (p<0.05). These receptors are highly expressed in the brain (24%) and 80% of them can interact with each other in a protein network, exerting some regulatory effects in various tissues. The main influential receptor on the network of receptors involved in COVID-19 was the EGFR and the majority of receptors were associated with pathological processes in the disease (p<0.05), including the amplification of inflammatory responses in COVID-19, which may be related to neurological disorders in some cases. Humans from the United States, Spain, and Brazil were the most used model in studies adressing receptors involved in COVID-19 (p<0.05).

The secondary mental health impacts of the pandemic are thought to be significant. Obsessive-compulsive disorder is a condition defined by recurrent obsessions and compulsions. It has been hypothesised that the focus on hygiene and contamination during the pandemic could exacerbate obsessive-compulsive symptoms in young people. METHOD A systematic literature review was conducted. Papers were sought looking at the effect of the pandemic on obsessive-compulsive disorder in young people. RESULTS Six published cross-sectional and longitudinal studies were identified, of which four studies investigated clinic samples with a diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive disorder and two looked at community adolescent populations. Five out of the six studies found that obsessive-compulsive symptoms were exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION The COVID-19 pandemic appears to be associated with a worsening of obsessive-compulsive symptoms in young people. Being in treatment seems to have a protective effect. Maintaining mental health services during a pandemic is vital.

Consequently, it is critical that we ensure the process of pleading guilty is as free of coercion as possible. Yet, research has indicated that incarcerating defendants to await trial could have an undue influence on their decision to plead guilty. The current research employed a novel computer simulation to examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on plea decision making among the innocent and the guilty when faced with potential pretrial detention. While presenting COVID-related information to participants increased both true and false guilty pleas, further analyses indicated that concerns about COVID-19 weighed more heavily on the innocent than the guilty. These findings illustrate the negative impact a pandemic could have in combination with a system of pleas that often allows prosecutors to provide defendants with just one guaranteed respite from jail-a guilty plea.

Results from a single Italian centre.",19.36504,9.751365,2020-07-01,"BACKGROUND Most surgeons favor the pledgeted suture technique for heart valve replacements because they believe it decreases the risk of paravalvular leak (PVL). We hypothesized that the use of nonpledgeted rather than pledgeted sutures during mitral valve replacement (MVR) may decrease the incidence of prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE) and risk of a major PVL. METHODS We analyzed 263 patients, divided into 175 patients who underwent MVR with nonpledgeted sutures from January 2003 to December 2013 and 88 patients who underwent MVR with pledgeted sutures from January 1995 to December 2001. We compared the occurrence of PVL and PVE between these groups. RESULTS In patients who underwent MVR with or without tricuspid valve surgery and/or a Maze operation, PVL occurred in 1.1% of the pledgeted group and 2.9% of the nonpledgeted group. The incidence of PVE was 2.9% in the nonpledgeted group and 1.1% in the pledgeted group. No differences were statistically significant. CONCLUSION We suggest that a nonpledgeted suture technique can be an alternative to the traditional use of pledgeted sutures in most patients who undergo MVR, with no significant difference in the incidence of PVL.","Kim, Gun Jik; Lee, Jong Tae; Lee, Young Ok; Cho, Joon Young; Oh, Tak-Hyuk",The Korean journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,384,12

Respiratory therapist (RT) burnout rates and drivers have not been specifically examined. The purpose of this project was to determine resilience and burnout resources available within respiratory care departments and to provide an estimate of pre- and post-COVID-19 RT burnout rates. METHODS A survey was developed to evaluate resilience and burnout resources in respiratory care departments. The survey was posted online to the AARConnect management, education, adult acute care, neonatal/pediatrics, COVID-19, and help line communities. Data analysis was descriptive. Key drivers of burnout among RTs were identified from qualitative answers. RESULTS There were 221 responses, and 72% reported experiencing burnout. Ten percent of the departments that responded measured burnout; 36% utilized resilience tools, and 83% offered free employee assistance for those struggling with burnout. In January 2020, 30% of departments reported an estimated burnout rate > 40%, which increased to 44% of departments (P = .007) in the COVID-19 pandemic period. The most common drivers reported were poor leadership (32%), high work load (31%), and staffing (29%); 93% of respondents agreed that burnout is a major problem in health care, 33% agreed that burnout is primarily driven by external factors, 92% agreed that RTs have a similar risk of burnout as other health care professionals, 73% agreed that they were comfortable discussing challenging situations with colleagues, 32% agreed that their leadership provided adequate support for those suffering from burnout, and 79% agreed that they would be open to utilizing resilience tools from the AARC or other professional organizations. CONCLUSIONS Most respondents experienced burnout and few respiratory care departments measured burnout. Resilience resources were not commonly used but employee assistance and wellness programs were common. Key drivers of burnout identified were poor leadership, staffing, and high workloads.","Miller, Andrew G; Roberts, Karsten J; Hinkson, Carl R; Davis, Gabrielle; Strickland, Shawna L; Rehder, Kyle J",Respiratory care,384,24

This followed the evidence of community transmission of coronavirus disease in the twenty Local Government Areas in Lagos State. This study assessed the value of respiratory and other symptoms in predicting positive SARS-CoV-2 using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). It is hoped that if symptoms are predictive, they can be used in screening before testing. Methods Communities were included based on the alerts from community members through the rumour alert system set up by the state. All members of the households of the communities from where the alert came were eligible. Household members who declined to participate were excluded from the study. A standardised interviewer-administered electronic investigation form was used to collect sociodemographic information, clinical details and history for each possible case. Data was analysed to see the extent of agreement or correlation between reported symptoms and the results of PCR testing for SARS-COV-2. Results A total of 12,739 persons were interviewed. The most common symptoms were fever, general weakness, cough and difficulty in breathing. Different symptoms recorded different levels of sensitivity as follows: fever, 28.9%; cough, 21.7%; general body weakness, 10.9%; and sore throat, 10.9%. Sensitivity and specificity for fever, the most common symptom, were 28.3% and 50.2%, respectively, while similar parameters for general body weakness, the next most common symptom, were 10.9% and 73.2%, respectively. Conclusion From these findings, the predictive ability of symptoms for COVID-19 diagnosis was extremely weak. It is unlikely that symptoms alone will suffice to predict COVID-19 in a patient. An additional measure, such as confirmatory test by RT-PCR testing, is necessary to confirm the disease.","Onasanya, Oluwatosin; Adebayo, Bisola; Okunromade, Ladun; Abayomi, Akin; Idris, Jide; Adesina, Abdulsalam; Aina, Olugbemiga; Zamba, Emmanuella; Erinosho, Olufemi; Bowale, Bimbola; Opawoye, Folarin; Ramadan, Patrick; Yenyi, Sam; Omilabu, Sunday; Balogun, Shakir; Osibogun, Akin",The Nigerian postgraduate medical journal,384,12

The ultra-fast application of measures was probably the reason of this outstanding success. This outbreak is expected to trigger feelings of fear, worry, and stress, as responses to an extreme threat for the community and the individual. In addition, changes in social behavior, as well as in working conditions, daily habits and routine, are expected to impose further stress, especially with the expectation of an upcoming economic crisis and possible unemployment. In Greece, where the lockdown was extremely successful in terms of containing the outbreak, worries concerning the possible adverse effects on mental health were also predominant. A collaboration concerning mental health during the COVID-19 outbreak was established, between the Aristotle University School of Medicine, the Panhellenic Medical Association and the World Psychiatric Association. Two large multinational studies were launched, one concerning the general population and one university students. Students' mental health is an area of special interest, both because of the vulnerability of this age group as well as because any disruption during the time of the studies has profound long-term consequences in the lives of the individuals, and this might trigger feelings of fear, worry, and stress. According the results from the Greek arm of the students' study, during the lockdown, two-thirds of university students reported at least 'much' increase in anxiety, one third in depressive feelings and in 2.59% concerning suicidal thoughts. There was also a worsening of quality of life and deterioration of lifestyle issues. Major depression was present in 12.43% with an additional 13.46% experiencing severe distress. Beliefs in conspiracy theories enjoyed wide acceptance ranging from 20-68%, with students of law, literature, pedagogics, political sciences and related studies manifesting higher acceptance rates. Female sex and depression/dysphoria both independently but also in interaction were related to higher rates of such beliefs. The results of the Greek arm of the general population study suggested that during the lockdown, clinical depression was present in 9.31%, with an additional 8.5% experiencing severe distress. Increased anxious and depressive emotions (including subclinical cases) were present in more than 40% of the population. In persons with a previous history of depression, 23.31% experienced depression vs. 8.96% of cases without previous history, who were experiencing their first depressive episode. Family dynamics suggested that fewer conflicts and better quality of relationships were surprisingly related to higher anxiety and depressive emotions, higher rates of depression and distress, and greater rates of suicidal thoughts. Eventually, spiritual and religious affiliation could protect the individual from the emerging suicidal thoughts. As correlation does not imply causation, the results suggest that conspiracy theories could be either the cause of depression or on the contrary a coping mechanism against depression. After taking into consideration that also in the family environment the expression of anger seemed to be a protective factor, the most likely explanation could be that the beliefs in conspiracy theories are a coping and 'protective' mechanism against the emergence of depression. These studies were among the first published, they went deeper in the data collection and even led to the creation of a model with distinct stages for the development of mental disorders during the lockdown. The analysis of the international data will probably provide further insight into the prevalence of mental disorders and the universal but also culturally specific models and factors pertaining to their development. At the time this editorial was in press, more than 40 countries representing more than two thirds of earth's population were participating with more than 45,000 responses already gathered.","Fountoulakis, Konstantinos N; Exadactylos, Athanasios; Anastasiadis, Kyriakos; Papaioannou, Nikolaos; Javed, Afzal",Psychiatrike = Psychiatriki,384,29

The pneumococcal vaccination rate among the elderly in China was only 3.7% in 2019, it grew rapidly during the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to investigate the psychological and demographic-economic factors related to the uptake behavior of pneumococcal vaccination among the Chinese elderly by using an integrated model based on the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT), and knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP). The theoretical model was tested via structural equation modeling (SEM) with data collected from 516 Chinese older adults aged 60 years and older. Our results suggested that knowledge, performance expectancy, effort expectancy, attitude, and trust had a significant correlation with behavioral intention; behavioral intention and trust had a positive correlation with the uptake behavior, gender, and and education level and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exerted significant moderating effects. To increase the coverage of pneumococcal vaccination among the elderly, it is necessary to provide effective health education by authoritative experts, thereby enhancing their knowledge and positive attitude towardthe vaccination.","Zhou, Min; Zhan, Jiaying; Kong, Nan; Campy, Kathryn S; Chen, Yan","Psychology, health & medicine",384,19

No objective data is available for youth with spina bifida who use a manual wheelchair, so the seriousness of the problem is unknown. The purpose of this observational study was to quantify physical activity in wheelchair-using youth with spina bifida and evaluate the intensity of activities. METHODS Fifty-three children and adolescents (5-19 years) with spina bifida who use a manual wheelchair for daily life, long distances or sports were included. To assess time spent in several types of activities VitaMove data of 34 participants were used and were presented as time spent sedentary and time spent physically active. This was compared to reference data of typically developing youth. To assess time spent in several intensities Actiheart data of 36 participants were used. The intensities were categorized according to the American College of Sports Medicine, ranging from very light intensity to near to maximal intensity. Data of 25 participants were used to combine type of activity and intensity. RESULTS Children and adolescents with spina bifida who use a manual wheelchair were more sedentary (94.3% versus 78.0% per 24 h, p < 0.000) and less physically active (5.0% versus 12.2% per 24 h, p < 0.000) compared to typically developing peers. Physical activity during weekend days was worse compared to school days; 19% met the Guidelines of Physical Activity during school days and 8% during weekend days. The intensities per activity varied extensively between participants. CONCLUSIONS Children and adolescents with spina bifida who use a manual wheelchair are less physically active and more sedentary than typically developing youth. The physical activity levels on school days seem to be more favorable than the physical activity levels on a weekend day. The low levels of physical activity need our attention in pediatric rehabilitation practice. The different intensities during activities indicate the importance of individually tailored assessments and interventions.","Bloemen, Manon A T; van den Berg-Emons, Rita J G; Tuijt, Matthijs; Nooijen, Carla F J; Takken, Tim; Backx, Frank J G; Vos, Marleen; de Groot, Janke F",Journal of neuroengineering and rehabilitation,384,4

For example, in the influenza envelope protein hemagglutinin (HA), the low pH in the endosome triggers a transition from the metastable prefusion conformation to the stable fusion conformation. To identify probes that interfere with HA function, here we screened a library of H7 HA peptides for inhibition of H7 HA-mediated entry. We discovered a peptide, PEP87 (WSYNAELLVAMENQHTI), that inhibited H7 and H5 HA-mediated entry. PEP87 corresponds to a highly conserved helical region of the HA2 subunit of HA that self-interacts in the neutral pH conformation. Mutagenesis experiments indicated that PEP87 binds to its native region in the HA trimer. We also found that PEP87 is unstructured in isolation but tends to form a helix as evidenced by CD and NMR studies. Fluorescence, chemical cross-linking, and saturation transfer difference NMR data suggested that PEP87 binds to the neutral pH conformation of HA and disrupts the HA structure without affecting its oligomerization state. Together, this work provides support for a model in which PEP87 disrupts HA function by displacing native interactions of the neutral pH conformation. Moreover, our observations indicate that the HA prefusion structure (and perhaps the metastable states of other viral entry proteins) is more dynamic with transient motions being larger than generally appreciated. These findings also suggest that the ensemble of prefusion structures presents many potential sites for targeting in therapeutic interventions.","Kingsley, Carolyn N; Antanasijevic, Aleksandar; Palka-Hamblin, Helena; Durst, Matthew; Ramirez, Benjamin; Lavie, Arnon; Caffrey, Michael",The Journal of biological chemistry,384,1

Historically, programs were based on cervical cytology (i.e., ""Pap smear""), which had to be repeated often because of its limited sensitivity and reproducibility. In more recent years, the discovery of human papillomavirus (HPV) as the necessary cause of virtually all cervical cancers has led to the introduction of HPV testing into clinical practice, first as a triage test for minor cytologic abnormalities, then in conjunction with cervical cytology (cotesting), and most recently, as a standalone screening test. Multiple randomized trials have shown that HPV-based screening has higher sensitivity compared with cytology, providing great reassurance against cervical precancer and cancer for women testing HPV-negative for many years. Analyses have also been conducted in support of the recent U.S. Preventive Services Task Force guidelines that show that primary HPV screening achieves the greatest balance of benefits and harms compared with other strategies. An added benefit of primary HPV testing is the ability to conduct it from self-collected samples, which is critical for extending coverage among hard-to-reach individuals and could provide a safe and effective alternative to in-person screening visits during the COVID-19 pandemic.See related article by Liang et al., p. 474.","Wentzensen, Nicolas; Clarke, Megan A","Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",384,16

Previous studies have documented cytokine and injury biomarker responses to surgical procedures that included general anaesthesia, but it is not clear to what degree anaesthetics contribute to these responses. METHODS We performed a prospective cohort study of 59 healthy volunteers aged 40-80 yr who did not undergo surgery. Plasma markers of neurological injury and inflammation were measured immediately before and 5 h after induction of general anaesthesia with 1 minimum alveolar concentration of sevoflurane. Biomarkers included interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), C-reactive protein (CRP), and neural injury (tau, neurofilament light [NF-L], and glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP]). RESULTS Baseline biomarkers were in the normal range, although NF-L and GFAP were elevated as a function of age. At 5 h after induction of anaesthesia, plasma tau, NF-L, and GFAP were significantly decreased relative to baseline. Plasma IL-6 was significantly increased after anaesthesia, but by a biologically insignificant degree (<1 pg ml-1); plasma TNF-α and CRP were unchanged. CONCLUSIONS Sevoflurane general anaesthesia without surgery, even in older adults, did not provoke an inflammatory state or neuronal injury at a concentration that is detectable by an acute elevation of measured plasma biomarkers in the early hours after exposure.

Typically, patients present with postprandial abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and weight loss. Diagnostically, various radiologic studies are used to document impingement of the celiac artery including ultrasound, computed tomography, aortograms, and magnetic resonance imaging. Historically, open approaches to the aorta and the celiac artery are performed to release the MAL and relieve compression of the celiac artery and the plexus. Laparoscopic approaches are now utilized to divide the MAL. This study describes a patient who underwent a successful laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and lost 100 lbs over a 2-year postoperative period. Subsequently, the patient developed postprandial abdominal pain associated with nausea. She underwent a computed tomogram that diagnosed celiac compression and then a dynamic ultrasound that showed elevated velocities with deep expiration. Ultimately, a laparoscopic MAL release with division of the celiac plexus was performed. At 10 months postoperatively, the patient remains asymptomatic. To our knowledge, this report documents a rare case of CAC after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.

RESULTS The mean age was 65 ± 10 years, 87% of patients were men, and 35% had previous coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG). Technical and procedural success was 92% and 90%, respectively. The median patient AK dose was 3.40 (interquartile range, 2.00-5.40) Gy and 34% of the patients received > 4.8 Gy (high radiation exposure). In univariable analysis male sex (P = 0.016), high body mass index (P < 0.001), history of hyperlipidemia (P = 0.023), previous CABG (P < 0.001), moderate or severe calcification (P < 0.001), tortuosity (P < 0.001), proximal cap ambiguity (P = 0.001), distal cap at a bifurcation (P = 0.006), longer CTO occlusion length (P < 0.001), blunt/no blunt stump (P < 0.001), and centre (P < 0.001) were associated with higher patient AK dose.

Studies examining the perspectives of patients with prediabetes and healthcare providers were included. Outcomes of interest included knowledge of nutrition care for prediabetes, attitudes around providing or receiving nutrition care and actual nutrition care practices for prediabetes. Overall, 12851 studies were screened and 26 were included in the final review. Inductive analysis produced five themes: (i) nutrition care is preferable to pharmacological intervention; (ii) patients report taking action for behaviour change; (iii) healthcare providers experience barriers to nutrition care; (iv) healthcare providers tend not to refer patients for nutrition care; and (v) there are contradictory findings around provision and receipt of nutrition care. This review has revealed the contradictions between patients' and healthcare providers' knowledge, attitudes and practices around nutrition care for prediabetes. Further research is needed to shed light on how to resolve these disconnects in care and to improve nutrition care practices for people with prediabetes.","Somerville, Mari; Ball, Lauren; Sierra-Silvestre, Eva; Williams, Lauren T",Australian journal of primary health,384,31

METHODS An online well-structured and validated faculty self-perceived competency questionnaire was used to collect responses from medical faculty. The questionnaire consisted of four purposely build sections on competence in student engagement, instructional strategy, technical communication and time management. The responses were recorded using a Likert ordinal scale (1-9). The Questionnaire was uploaded at www.surveys.google.com and the link was distributed through social media outlets and e-mails. Descriptive statistics and Independent paired t-test were used for analysis and comparison of quantitative and qualitative variables. A p-value of ≤0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS A total of 738 responses were assessed. Nearly 54% (397) participants had less than 5 years of teaching experience, 24.7% (182) had 6-10 years and 11.7% (86) had 11-15 years teaching expertise. 75.6% (558) respondents have delivered online lectures during the pandemic. Asynchronous methods were used by 61% (450) and synchronous by 39% (288) of participants. Moreover, 22.4% (165) participants revealed that their online lectures were evaluated by a structured feedback from experts, while 38.3% participants chose that their lectures were not evaluated. A significant difference (p < 0.01) was found between FSPC scores and online teaching evaluation by experts. The mean score of FSPC scale was 5.62±1.15. The mean score for student's engagement, instructional strategies, technical communication and time management were of 5.18±1.60, 5.67±1.61, 5.49±1.71 and 6.12±1.67 respectively. CONCLUSIONS Medical faculty members were found somewhat competent in E-teaching for student engagement, instructional strategy, technical communication and time management skills.

METHOD Final participants were 71 adults who were recruited from Amazon's Mechanical Turk. Participants responded to daily questions regarding ruminations they engaged in and PTG they experienced that day for a total of 29 days. RESULTS As expected, there was no significant association between intrusive rumination and PTG, but a significant positive association was found between deliberate rumination and PTG. In addition, a person of color and those who reported as religious experienced higher levels of PTG. Furthermore, there was a significant between-person variability on the effect of deliberate rumination on PTG. CONCLUSIONS The current study supports previous findings between rumination and PTG. It also raises the importance of acknowledging that the levels of one's PTG following deliberate rumination may differ greatly from the typical individual, indicating the need to be mindful of individual experience.

METHODS Observational study with confirmed COVID-19 patients. The primary endpoint was development of moderate-severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Time to moderate-severe ARDS, the need for mechanical or non-invasive ventilation (MV/NIV), death, and a composite of death or MV/NIV were secondary endpoints. RESULTS Of 138 patients included, 27 (19.6%) were immunosuppressed (IS) and 95 (68.8%) were male, with a median (IQR) age of 68 (54-78) years. A significantly lower proportion of IS patients (25.9%) compared to non-IS patients (52.3%) developed moderate-severe ARDS, in both unadjusted (0.32 (95%CI, 0.13-0.83, p=0.017) and adjusted (aOR 0.25 [95%CI, 0.08-0.80], p=0.019) analyses. After stratifying by pathologies, only IS patients with autoimmune diseases remained significant (aOR 0.25 [95%CI, 0.07-0.98], p=0.046). Non-significant trends towards a longer time to moderate or severe ARDS, a lower need for MV/NIV, and a lower risk of death or MV/NIV were detected among IS. CONCLUSIONS In our cohort of COVID-19 patients, non-severe immunosuppression was associated with a lower risk of moderate-severe ARDS, especially among AD. This suggests a potential protective effect from a hypothesized hyper-inflammatory response. This article is protected by copyright.

We sought to characterise patients discharged following a COVID-19 hospitalisation within a large integrated health system in the United States. METHODS We performed a retrospective study of 2180 COVID-19 patients discharged between 1 April 2020 and 31 July 2020. The primary endpoint was all-cause observation stay or inpatient readmission within 30 days from discharge. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to estimate the association between key socio-demographic and clinical characteristics with risk of 30-day readmission. RESULTS The 30-day readmission rate was 7.6% (n = 166); 30-day mortality rate was 1% (n = 19). Most readmissions were respiratory-related (58%) and occurred at a median time of 5 days post discharge. Adjusted models showed that prior hospitalisations (Odds Ratio = 2.36, [95% Confidence Interval: 1.59-3.50]), chronic pulmonary disease (1.57 [1.09-2.28]), and discharge to home health (1.46 [1.01-2.11]) were significantly associated with 30-day readmission. Longer duration from diagnosis to index admission was borderline associated with lower odds of readmission (0.95 [0.91-1.00]). CONCLUSION Readmission and mortality rates for COVID-19 following discharge are low. Most readmissions occur early and are due to respiratory causes and may reflect the prolonged acute disease course.","Huang, Cheng-Wei; Desai, Prashant P; Wei, Kenneth K; Liu, In-Lu Amy; Lee, Janet S; Nguyen, Huong Q",Infectious diseases,384,29

The aim of the present study was to assess the complete blood cell parameters prior to disease treatment in patients with advanced NSCLC. A total of 268 patients with advanced NSCLC were enrolled in this study. Clinical and laboratory data of the patients were acquired through medical records. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to determine the optimal cut-off values of the neutrophil/white blood cell ratio (NWR), NLR, platelet/white blood cell ratio (PWR), PLR, monocyte/white blood cell ratio (MWR), monocyte/lymphocyte ratio (MLR) and LWR. Kaplan-Meier univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were used to evaluate the effect of complete blood parameters on progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). The optimal cut-off values were identified as 0.67 for NWR, 2.85 for NLR, 37.23 for PWR, 166.56 for PLR, 0.074 for MWR, 0.31 for MLR and 0.24 for LWR. Univariate analysis revealed that sex (P=0.038), histological type (P<0.0001), NWR (P=0.026), NLR (P=0.044) and MLR (P=0.012) were all associated with PFS, whereas histological type (P=0.003), NWR (P=0.003), NLR (P=0.015), MLR (P=0.006) and LWR (P=0.043) were significantly associated with OS in patients with advanced NSCLC.

BACKGROUND Published studies on chest CT in COVID-19 infection do not go beyond describing the characteristics of the current period. Nevertheless, comparative analysis of chest CT findings on hospital admission among patients in different clinical outcomes is scarce. OBJECTIVE 198 consecutive symptomatic patients with COVID-19 infection confirmed by positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and who had undergone chest CT were enrolled in this retrospective study. METHOD According to their clinical outcomes, we divided them (n:98) into 3 groups. Group 1 (n: 62) involved patients discharged from the service, group 2 (n: 60) included patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit, and group 3 (n: 76) comprised patients who died despite any treatment. RESULTS Clinical characteristics involving age, dyspnea, hypertension, and chest CT findings of mediastinal lymphadenopathy, pleural effusion, and pericardial effusion, were determined as poor prognosis and mortality predictors, and halo sign in chest CT finding was a good prognosis predictor in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION It was seen that some CT findings were significantly correlated to the patients' endpoints, such as discharge, hospitalization in the intensive care unit, and as a worst consequence, death. These findings support the role of CT imaging for potentially predicting the clinical outcomes of these patients with COVID-19.","Gunduz, Yasemin; Karacan, Alper; Karabay, Oguz; Erdem, Ali Fuat; Kindir, Osman; Ozturk, Mehmet Halil",Current medical imaging,384,20

This study summarises periprocedural outcomes and 6-month follow-up results following its introduction in a tertiary interventional neuroradiology centre. MATERIALS AND METHODS This prospective, single-arm study assessed 32 aneurysms treated over a 21-month time period from the time of procedure to 6 months post-procedure. Data collected included patient demographics, aneurysm features and intraprocedural and 6-month post-procedural complications. RESULTS The mean age of the cohort was 58.8 ± Standard Deviation 8.5 years. Twenty-eight aneurysms were treated electively and four acutely. The elective cases received dual antiplatelet therapy post-procedure. The acute cases received single antiplatelet therapy post-procedure. Of the target aneurysms, 16/32 (50%) were small (<10 mm), 13/32 (41%) were large (10-25 mm) and 3/32 (9%) were giant (≥25 mm). There was no mortality in the series. There were two periprocedural complications (2/32, 6.2%): a stroke and a dissection. There were no post-procedural complications. At 6 months post-procedure, satisfactory occlusion (defined as Raymond-Roy 1 or 2) was achieved in 90.6% and 93.8% by way of magnetic resonance angiography and digital subtraction angiography assessment, respectively. There was no implant migration, no significant intraluminal hyperplasia or in-stent stenosis and no cases of aneurysm recurrence.

Little is known about the effects of increased mask-wearing on social interactions, social anxiety, or overall mental health. OBJECTIVES Explore the potential effects of mask-wearing on social anxiety. DESIGN We review existing literatures to highlight three preselected sets of factors that may be important in shaping the effects of mask-wearing on social anxiety. These are: (a) people's perceptions of the social norms associated with wearing masks; (b) people's experiences of the degree to which masks prevent accurate interpretation of social and emotional cues; and (c) people's use of masks as a type of safety behavior that enables self-concealment. METHODS APA PsycNet and PubMed were searched principally between September and November 2020 for articles describing the relationship between social anxiety, intolerance of uncertainty, ambiguous feedback, and safety behavior use and for research on the relationship between mask-wearing and social norms and social interactions. Information identified as relevant from articles of interest was extracted and included in our review. RESULTS & CONCLUSIONS The effects of mask-wearing on social anxiety are likely to be substantial and clinically relevant.","Saint, Sidney A; Moscovitch, David A","Anxiety, stress, and coping",384,11

Participants with suspected or diagnosed Covid-19 will be included. The interventions being considered are drugs being repurposed, and comparators will include standard of care treatment or placebo. METHODS We searched Ovid-MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane library, clinical trial registration site in the UK(NIHR), Europe (clinicaltrialsregister.eu), US (ClinicalTrials.gov) and internationally (isrctn.com), and reviewed the reference lists of articles for eligible articles published up to April 22, 2020. All studies in English that evaluated the efficacy of the listed drugs were included. Cochrane RoB 2.0 and ROBINS-I tool were used to assess study quality. This systematic review adheres to the PRISMA guidelines. The protocol is available at PROSPERO (CRD42020180915). RESULTS From 708 identified studies or clinical trials, 16 studies and 16 case reports met our eligibility criteria. Of these, 6 were randomized controlled trials (763 patients), 7 cohort studies (321 patients) and 3 case series (191 patients). Chloroquine (CQ) had a 100% discharge rate compared to 50% with lopinavir-ritonavir at day 14, however a trial has recommended against a high dosage due to cardiotoxic events. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has shown no significant improvement in negative seroconversion rate which is also seen in our meta-analysis (p=0.68). Adverse events with HCQ have a significant difference compared to the control group (p=0.001). Lopinavir-ritonavir has shown no improvement in time to clinical improvement which is seen in our meta-analyses (p=0.1). Remdesivir has shown no significant improvement in time to clinical improvement but this trial had insufficient power. DISCUSSION Due to the paucity in evidence, it is difficult to establish the efficacy of these drugs in the treatment of Covid-19 as currently there is no significant clinical effectiveness of the repurposed drugs. Further large clinical trials are required to achieve more reliable findings. A risk-benefit analysis is required on an individual basis to weigh out the potential improvement in clinical outcome and viral load reduction compared to the risks of the adverse events.","Kotecha, Pinky; Light, Alexander; Checcucci, Enrico; Amparore, Daniele; Fiori, Cristian; Porpiglia, Francesco; Dasgupta, Prokar; Elhage, Oussama",Panminerva medica,384,7

To advance understanding of disease transmission mechanisms and to find novel exposure minimisation strategies, we studied cough-driven material transport modes and the efficacy of control strategies. DESIGN Computer simulations and real-world experiments were used for integrating an intensive care setting, multiphysics and physiology. Patient-focused airflow management and air purification strategies were examined computationally and validated by submicron particle exhalation imaging in volunteers. SETTING Hospital setting during a respiratory virus pandemic with transmission by respiratory droplets and aerosols. PARTICIPANTS Healthy volunteers. OUTCOME MEASURES Distribution of, and exposure to, potentially infectious respiratory secretions. RESULTS Respiratory materials ejected by cough exhibited four transport modes: long-distance ballistic, short-distance ballistic, 'jet rider' and aerosol modes. Interaction with air conditioning driven flow contaminated a hospital room rapidly. Different than large droplets or aerosols, jet rider droplets travelled with the turbulent air jet initially, but fell out at a distance, were not well eliminated by air conditioning and exposed bystanders at larger distance and longer time; their size predisposes them to preferential capture in the nasal mucosa, the primordial COVID-19 infection site. 'Cough shields' captured large droplets but induced lateral dispersion of aerosols and jet riders. An air purification device alone had limited efficacy. A 'Shield and Sink' approach combining cough shields with 'virus sinks' minimised exposure to all secretions in modelling and real-life experiments. CONCLUSIONS Jet riders have characteristics of highly efficient respiratory infection vectors and may play a role in COVID-19 transmission. Exposure to all droplet types can be minimised through an easily implemented Shield and Sink strategy.","Hunziker, Patrick",BMJ open,384,28

METHOD We searched 18 electronic databases to identify English articles (published January 2000-December 2019) reporting on well-defined DAIs targeting older adults (≥65 years) in RLTCF. Data were extracted by two independent reviewers. Descriptive statistics were produced for quantitative studies, with key themes identified among qualitative studies. Where possible, estimates were pooled from randomised controlled trials using random effects meta-analyses. RESULTS Forty-three relevant studies (39 quantitative; 4 qualitative) were identified. The majority of quantitative studies were assessed as low-quality according to the MMAT criteria (n = 26, 67%). Almost half of the quantitative studies (n = 18, 46%) found no significant changes over time or between groups across outcomes measured. The most salient intervention effects included improved social functioning (n = 10), reduced depressive symptoms (n = 6) and loneliness (n = 5). A random-effects meta-analysis revealed a medium effect in favour of DAT on reducing depressive or loneliness symptoms (pooled SMD: 0.66, 95%CI 0.21-1.11; I2 = 50.5; five trials), relative to treatment as usual. However, compared to treatment as usual, no overall effect of DAI on activities of daily living was detected (p = .737). Key themes from qualitative studies included (a) animals as effective transitional objects, (b) the therapeutic value of pets and (c) the significance of the care environment and stakeholders in facilitating DAI. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE The findings of this review indicate that while DAI has value for older people in RLTCF, challenges remain in accurately measuring its impact to provide a stronger evidence-base. Standardisation of DAI service design, delivery and evaluation is required for future research and practice in providing holistic care for older adults.","Jain, Briony; Syed, Shabeer; Hafford-Letchfield, Trish; O'Farrell-Pearce, Sioban",International journal of older people nursing,384,5

Inadequate diagnosis and management of common life-threatening conditions is an important determinant of maternal mortality. We analysed the clinicopathological discrepancies in a series of maternal deaths from Mozambique and assessed changes over 10 years in the diagnostic process. We aimed to provide data on clinical diagnostic accuracy to be used for improving quality of care and reducing maternal mortality. METHODS We did a retrospective analysis of clinicopathological discrepancies in 91 maternal deaths occurring from Nov 1, 2013, to March 31, 2015 (17 month-long period), at a tertiary-level hospital in Mozambique, using complete diagnostic autopsies as the gold standard to ascertain cause of death. We estimated the performance of the clinical diagnosis and classified clinicopathological discrepancies as major and minor errors. We compared the findings of this analysis with those of a similar study done in the same setting 10 years earlier. FINDINGS We identified a clinicopathological discrepancy in 35 (38%) of 91 women. All diagnostic errors observed were classified as major discrepancies. The sensitivity of the clinical diagnosis for puerperal infections was 17% and the positive predictive value was 50%. The sensitivity for non-obstetric infections was 48%. The sensitivity for eclampsia was 100% but the positive predictive value was 33%. Over the 10-year period, the performance of clinical diagnosis did not improve, and worsened for some diagnoses, such as puerperal infection. INTERPRETATION Decreasing maternal mortality requires improvement of the pre-mortem diagnostic process and avoidance of clinical errors by refining clinical skills and increasing the availability and quality of diagnostic tests. Comparison of post-mortem information with clinical diagnosis will help monitor the reduction of clinical errors and thus improve the quality of care.

The study aimed to compare the incidence of favipiravir-associated adverse events among patients with varying renal function status. METHODS Records of 921 patients who were hospitalized for COVID-19 and had received at least five days of favipiravir treatment were retrospectively evaluated and 228 patients were included in the study. Patients' age, sex, comorbidities, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and hematological and biochemical values were recorded. The incidence of adverse events was compared to the age, sex, comorbidities, and eGFR of the patients. RESULTS The mean age of the patients was 59.3 ± 15.6 years, and 38.2% of the patients were female. One-hundred and thirty-one (57.5%) patients had experienced adverse events. These adverse effects consisted of ALT elevation (35.5%), AST elevation (21.5%), anemia (16.2%), hyperuricemia (10.5%), hepatocellular injury (9.2%), neutropenia (3.5%), and thrombocytopenia (2.6%). The incidence of adverse events was not significantly different when patients had eGFR >60 mL/min/1.73 m2 or eGFR 30-60 mL/min/1.73 m2 (p >0.05), but significantly increased when the eGFR dropped to less than 30 (p <0.05). The differences seen with hyperuricemia and anemia were significant (p <0.05). CONCLUSION Even though favipiravir appeared to be well tolerated in the individuals with renal failure in this study, its use in this population remains a challenge that requires more research and analysis.","Gök, Selim; Bahçecioğlu, Ömer Faruk; Durmuş, Mefküre; Gün, Zeynep Ülkü; Ersoy, Yasemin; Aytemur, Zeynep Ayfer; Ulutaş, Özkan",International journal of clinical practice,384,9

ANIMALS Fourteen 12-month-old female New Zealand White rabbits. PROCEDURES Rabbits were assigned to 2 treatment groups (7 rabbits/group). One group received buprenorphine (0.06 mg/kg, IV, q 8 h for 2 days), and the other received lidocaine (continuous rate infusion [CRI] at 100 μg/kg/min for 2 days). Variables, including food and water consumption, fecal output, glucose and cortisol concentrations, and behaviors while in exercise pens, were recorded. RESULTS Rabbits receiving a lidocaine CRI had significantly higher gastrointestinal motility, food intake, and fecal output and significantly lower glucose concentrations, compared with results for rabbits receiving buprenorphine. Rabbits receiving lidocaine also had a higher number of normal behaviors (eg, sprawling, traveling, and frolicking) after surgery, compared with behaviors such as crouching and sitting that were seen more commonly in rabbits receiving buprenorphine. Both groups had significant weight loss after surgery. Pain scores did not differ significantly between treatment groups. Significant decreases in heart rate and respiratory rate were observed on the day of surgery, compared with values before and after surgery. Rabbits in the lidocaine group had significantly overall lower heart rates than did rabbits in the buprenorphine group. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE A CRI of lidocaine to rabbits provided better postoperative outcomes with respect to fecal output, food intake, and glucose concentrations. Thus, lidocaine appeared to be a suitable alternative to buprenorphine for alleviating postoperative pain with minimal risk of anorexia and gastrointestinal ileus.","Schnellbacher, Rodney W; Divers, Stephen J; Comolli, Jessica R; Beaufrère, Hugues; Maglaras, Christina H; Andrade, Natalia; Barbur, Laura A; Rosselli, Desiree D; Stejskal, Marko; Barletta, Michele; Mayer, Jörg; Rodriguez, Paula; Quandt, Jane E",American journal of veterinary research,384,0

However, it is estimated that approximately one-third of the US and international population are hesitant to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. For most Western countries with the economic means to purchase sufficient vaccine for their citizens, the medical community now has the opportunity to lead the vaccination communication campaign. Because frontline clinicians were the first to be vaccinated in the United States (US), they are uniquely positioned to be the most trusted source of vaccine information. Primary care clinicians, more than other groups of clinicians, scientists, government officials, media, etc. have the greatest chance for instilling confidence about the vaccine to their patients, including the most vulnerable and the most distrusting. They are considered credible and trustworthy allies for their patients in the US, however, clinicians receive little to no formal training in communication related to controversial topics, such as vaccine hesitancy.

DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH During custody in France, a medical consultation is provided for any patient who requests it. In the Paris area, this consultation is carried out by a practitioner in forensic medicine, based in a general hospital. Usually, most medical consultations for patients in custody take place directly in police stations. With the COVID-19 outbreak, the authors chose to suspend this activity, asking law enforcement to bring patients directly to their hospitals. Patients presenting with severe infections or indicative symptoms of the severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 infection and a comorbidity are tested for COVID-19. Such patients remain hospitalized until results of the test are received. If the result is positive, they are hospitalized for the length of their custody. If sent to prison, they are transferred to a medical facility in detention. FINDINGS From the onset of the outbreak, the authors observed increased pressure from law enforcement to obtain medical information. According to the French Code of Medical Ethics, no medical information should be disclosed regarding the authors' patients' medical situations. The authors are also concerned about sending a potentially infected patient back to a police station, to prison or to his/her home. ORIGINALITY/VALUE This paper provides a snapshot of issues relating to the management of patients in custody during the COVID-19 outbreak in France.

Targeting at China, this research aims to reveal, visualize and compare the geographical distribution patterns of different subtypes of urban and rural health workforce and identify the priority regions for health workforce planning and allocation policies designing. METHODS The health workforce density (workforce-to-population ratio) is adopted to represent the accessibility to health workforce in each geographical unit. Besides a descriptive geography of health workforce as a whole, the local indicators of spatial association (LISA) are used to explore the spatial clusters of different subtypes of health workforce, which are visualized by geographical tools. RESULTS Results reveal that regional disparities and spatial clusters exist in China's health workforce distribution, with different types of workforce exhibiting relatively different spatial distribution characteristics. Besides, huge urban-rural disparities are found in the distribution of health workforce in China. Unexpectedly but intriguingly, most of the high-high and high-low cluster area of urban health workforce are concentrated in the western China (Xinjiang, Xizang etc.), indicating the relative abundant stock of urban health workforce in these units, while the low-low and low-high cluster area of different types of urban health workforce are mainly distributed in middle China. Regarding the rural health workforce, there is an obvious and similar low-low and low-high clustering pattern in western provinces (Sichuan, Yunnan) for the licensed doctors, pharmacists, technologists, which play a critical role in health services delivery. CONCLUSIONS Different types of health workforce displayed distinct spatial distribution patterns, while the misdistribution of rural health workforce imposed more challenges to the Chinese health sector due to its poorer stock and more disadvantaged positions of backward regions (i.e., low-low and low-high cluster area). Subtype-specific and region-oriented health workforce planning and allocation policies are suggested to be made, aiming at the urban and rural health workforce respectively, by prioritizing the identified low-low and low-high cluster areas.","Zhu, Bin; Fu, Yang; Liu, Jinlin; He, Rongxin; Zhang, Ning; Mao, Ying",BMC health services research,384,16

They have been shown to improve patient outcomes as well as optimise health services-vital as 'universal test-and-treat' targets increase numbers of HIV patients on antiretroviral treatment (ART). This qualitative study explored patient, healthcare worker and key informant experiences and perceptions of extending ART refills to 6 months in adherence clubs in Khayelitsha, South Africa. DESIGN AND SETTING In-depth interviews were conducted in isiXhosa with purposively selected patients and in English with healthcare workers and key informants. All transcripts were audio-recorded, transcribed and translated to English, manually coded and thematically analysed. The participants had been involved in a randomised controlled trial evaluating multi-month ART dispensing in adherence clubs, comparing 6-month and 2-month refills. PARTICIPANTS Twenty-three patients, seven healthcare workers and six key informants. RESULTS Patients found that 6-month refills increased convenience and reduced unintended disclosure. Contrary to key informant concerns about patients' responsibility to manage larger quantities of ART, patients receiving 6-month refills were highly motivated and did not face challenges transporting, storing or adhering to treatment. All participant groups suggested that strict eligibility criteria were necessary for patients to realise the benefits of extended dispensing intervals. Six-month refills were felt to increase health system efficiency, but there were concerns about whether the existing drug supply system could adapt to 6-month refills on a larger scale. CONCLUSIONS Patients, healthcare workers and key informants found 6-month refills within adherence clubs acceptable and beneficial, but concerns were raised about the reliability of the supply chain to manage extended multi-month dispensing. Stepwise, slow expansion could avoid overstressing supply and allow time for the health system to adapt, permitting 6-month ART refills to enhance current DSD options to be more efficient and patient-centred within current health system constraints.","Keene, Claire Marriott; Zokufa, Nompumelelo; Venables, Emilie C; Wilkinson, Lynne; Hoffman, Risa; Cassidy, Tali; Snyman, Leigh; Grimsrud, Anna; Voget, Jacqueline; von der Heyden, Erin; Zide-Ndzungu, Siphokazi; Bhardwaj, Vinayak; Isaakidis, Petros",BMJ open,384,16

A World Health Organization (WHO) initiative, The End Tuberculosis Strategy, set ambitious targets for 2020-2035, including 20% reduction in TB incidence and 35% reduction in the absolute number of TB deaths by 2020 and 90% reduction in TB incidence and 95% reduction in TB deaths by 2035, compared with 2015 (3). This report evaluated global progress toward these targets based on data reported by WHO (1). Annual TB data routinely reported to WHO by 194 member states were used to estimate TB incidence and mortality overall and among persons with HIV infection, TB-preventive treatment (TPT) initiation, and drug-resistant TB for 2018 (1). In 2018, an estimated 10 million persons had incident TB, and 1.5 million TB-related deaths occurred, representing 2% and 5% declines from 2017, respectively. The number of persons with both incident and prevalent TB remained highest in the WHO South-East Asia and African regions. Decreases in the European region were on track to meet 2020 targets. Globally, among persons living with HIV, 862,000 incident TB cases occurred, and 1.8 million persons initiated TPT. Rifampicin-resistant or multidrug-resistant TB occurred among 3.4% of persons with new TB and 18% among persons who were previously treated for TB (overall, among 4.8% of persons with TB). The modest decreases in the number of persons with TB and the number of TB-related deaths were consistent with recent trends, and new and substantial progress was observed in increased TPT initiation among persons living with HIV. However, to meet the global targets for 2035, more intensive efforts are needed by public health partners to decrease TB incidence and deaths and increase the number of persons receiving TB curative and preventive treatment. Innovative approaches to case finding, scale-up of TB preventive treatment, use of newer TB treatment regimens, and prevention and control of HIV will contribute to decreasing TB.","MacNeil, Adam; Glaziou, Philippe; Sismanidis, Charalambos; Date, Anand; Maloney, Susan; Floyd, Katherine",MMWR.

Human infection can cause coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has been rapidly spreading around the globe1,2. SARS-CoV-2 shows some similarities to other coronaviruses. However, treatment options and a cellular understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection are lacking. Here we identify the host cell pathways modulated by SARS-CoV-2 infection and show that inhibition of these pathways prevent viral replication in human cells. We established a human cell culture model for infection with SARS-CoV-2 clinical isolate. Employing this system, we determined the SARS-CoV-2 infection profile by translatome3 and proteome proteomics at different times after infection. These analyses revealed that SARS-CoV-2 reshapes central cellular pathways, such as translation, splicing, carbon metabolism and nucleic acid metabolism. Small molecule inhibitors targeting these pathways prevented viral replication in cells. Our results reveal the cellular infection profile of SARS-CoV-2 and led to the identification of drugs inhibiting viral replication. We anticipate our results to guide efforts to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying host cell modulation upon SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Heparin (delivered systemically) is currently used to treat anticoagulant anomalies in COVID-19 patients. In addition, in the UK, Brazil and Australia, nebulised unfractionated heparin (UFH) is being trialled in COVID-19 patients as a potential treatment. A systematic comparison of the potential antiviral effect of various heparin preparations on live wild-type SARS-CoV-2, in vitro, is needed. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH Seven different heparin preparations including UFH and low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) of porcine or bovine origin were screened for antiviral activity against live SARS-CoV-2 (Australia/VIC01/2020) using a plaque inhibition assay with Vero E6 cells. Interaction of heparin with spike protein RBD was studied using differential scanning fluorimetry, and the inhibition of RBD binding to human ACE2 protein using ELISA assays was examined. KEY RESULTS All the UFH preparations had potent antiviral effects, with IC50 values ranging between 25-41 μg ml-1 whereas LMWHs were less inhibitory by ~150-fold (IC50 range 3.4 - 7.8 mg ml-1 ). Mechanistically we observed that heparin binds and destabilizes the RBD protein, and furthermore we show heparin directly inhibits the binding of RBD to the human ACE2 protein receptor. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS This comparison of clinically relevant heparins shows UFH has significantly stronger SARS-CoV-2 antiviral activity compared to LMWHs. UFH acts to directly inhibit binding of spike protein to the human ACE2 protein receptor. Overall the data strongly support further clinical investigation of UFH as a potential treatment for patients with COVID-19.","Tree, Julia A; Turnbull, Jeremy E; Buttigieg, Karen R; Elmore, Michael J; Coombes, Naomi; Hogwood, John; Mycroft-West, Courtney J; Lima, Marcelo A; Skidmore, Mark A; Karlsson, Richard; Chen, Yen-Hsi; Zhang, Yang; Spalluto, Cosma Mirella; Staples, Karl J; Yates, Edwin A; Gray, Elaine; Singh, Dave; Wilkinson, Tom; Page, Clive P; Carroll, Miles W",British journal of pharmacology,384,15

We present herein a large-volume single-center experience with laparoscopic liver resection. DESIGN Retrospective study. SETTING Rikshospitalet University Hospital. PATIENTS One hundred thirty-nine patients who underwent 177 laparoscopic liver resections in 149 procedures from August 18, 1998, through October 14, 2008. One hundred thirteen patients had malignant lesions, of whom 96 had colorectal metastases. INTERVENTION Laparoscopic liver resection for malignant and benign lesions. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Perioperative and oncologic outcomes and survival. RESULTS Five procedures (3.4%) were converted to laparotomy and 1 (0.7%) to laparoscopic radiofrequency ablation. The remaining 143 procedures were completed laparoscopically, during which 177 liver resections were undertaken, including 131 nonanatomic and 46 anatomic resections. The median operative time and blood loss were 164 (50-488) minutes and 350 (<50-4000) mL, respectively. There were 10 intraoperative (6.7%) and 18 postoperative (12.6%) complications. One patient (0.7%) died. The median postoperative stay and opioid requirement were 3 (1-42) and 1 (0-11) days, respectively. Tumor-free resection margins determined by histopathologic evaluation were achieved in 140 of 149 malignant specimens (94.0%). The 5-year actuarial survival for patients undergoing procedures for colorectal metastases was 46%. CONCLUSIONS In experienced hands, laparoscopic liver resection is a favorable alternative to open resection. Perioperative morbidity and mortality and long-term survival after laparoscopic resection of colorectal metastases appear to be comparable to those after open resections.","Kazaryan, Airazat M; Pavlik Marangos, Irina; Rosseland, Arne R; Røsok, Bård I; Mala, Tom; Villanger, Olaug; Mathisen, Oystein; Giercksky, Karl-Erik; Edwin, Bjørn",Archives of surgery,384,1

One approach involves the switch from operating under general to local anaesthetic. We assess whether diluational local anaesthetic is as effective as the current standard approach. METHODS Postoperative pain was recorded in prospective, consecutive patients undergoing wide local excision under dilutional local anaesthetic (concentration < 1mg/ml). Pain scores were documented at 0, 30 and 60 minutes and compared to a control group consisting of combined general with local anaesthetic. RESULTS Pain significantly increased in the control group during the postoperative recovery. This was not seen in the dilutional local anaesthetic group that was non-inferior to the standard approach at 0, 30 and 60 minutes. CONCLUSION Dilutional local anaesthetic provides a safe and effective alternative approach to operating on breast cancer patients whilst avoiding risky general anaesthetic in a COVID-19 pandemic environment.","Batt, Jeremy; Cook, Nicola; Nadeem, Muhammad; Sahu, Ajay",Journal of perioperative practice,384,16

This study determined the pattern of respiratory pathogens in cats with and without clinical signs of URI in four different models for managing unowned cats, namely, (1) short-term animal shelters (STS), (2) long-term sanctuaries (LTS), (3) home-based foster care programs (FCP), and (4) trap-neuter-return programs for community cats (TNR). Conjunctival and oropharyngeal swabs from 543 cats, approximately half of which showed clinical signs of URI, were tested for feline herpes virus-1 (FHV), feline calicivirus (FCV), Chlamydia felis, Bordetella bronchiseptica, Mycoplasma felis, and canine influenza virus by real-time PCR. FHV (59%, 41%) and B. bronchiseptica (33%, 24%) were more prevalent in both clinically affected and nonclinical cats, respectively, in STS than other management models. FCV (67%, 51%) and M. felis (84%, 86%) were more prevalent in LTS than any other management model. Clinically affected cats in FCP were more likely to carry FHV (23%, 6%), C. felis (24%, 10%), or M. felis (58%, 38%) than were nonclinical cats. Clinically affected cats in TNR were more likely to carry FCV (55%, 36%) or C. felis (23%, 4%) than were nonclinical cats. The prevalence of individual pathogens varied between different management models, but the majority of the cats in each model carried one or more respiratory pathogens regardless of clinical signs. Both confined and free-roaming cats are at risk of developing infectious respiratory disease and their health should be protected by strategic vaccination, appropriate antibiotic therapy, effective biosecurity, feline stress mitigation, and alternatives to high-density confinement.","McManus, C M; Levy, J K; Andersen, L A; McGorray, S P; Leutenegger, C M; Gray, L K; Hilligas, J; Tucker, S J",Veterinary journal,384,11

However, the effect of canakinumab on the total number of cardiovascular events, including recurrent events collected after a first event, is unknown. OBJECTIVES This study sought to determine whether randomly allocated canakinumab would reduce the total burden of serious cardiovascular events. METHODS We randomized 10,061 patients to placebo or canakinumab 50 mg, 150 mg, or 300 mg once every 3 months and compared the rates of the composite of all serious cardiovascular events (MI, stroke, coronary revascularization, and cardiovascular death) in active versus placebo groups. We used negative binomial regression to account for correlations among repeated events in the same person and to estimate rate ratios and 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS During a median of 3.7 years of follow-up, 3,417 total serious cardiovascular events occurred in 2,003 individuals among the 10,061 unique patients randomized. Canakinumab reduced the rates of total serious cardiovascular events, with rates per 100 person-years in the placebo, 50 mg, 150 mg, and 300 mg canakinumab groups of 10.4, 8.4, 8.3, and 8.2, respectively. The corresponding rate ratios (95% confidence intervals) compared with placebo were 0.80 (0.69 to 0.93) for 50 mg, 0.79 (0.68 to 0.92) for 150 mg, and 0.78 (0.67 to 0.91) for 300 mg.

The 2016 Kids' Inpatient Database was queried to identify patients aged 3 years or younger who underwent craniectomy for craniosynostosis. Multivariable regression modeled treatment type based on patient-level (gender, race, income, comorbidities, payer) and facility-level (bed size, region, teaching status) variables, and was used to assess outcomes. The weighted sample included 474 patients, of whom 81.9% (N = 388) of patients underwent open repair and 18.1% (N = 86) underwent endoscopic repair. A total of 81.1% of patients were under 1 year of age and 12.0% were syndromic. Patients were more likely to be treated open if they were older (odds ratio [OR] 3.07, P = 0.005) or syndromic (OR 8.56, P = 0.029). Patients who underwent open repair were more likely to receive transfusions (OR 2.86, P = 0.021), and have longer lengths of stay (OR 1.02, P < 0.001) and more costly hospitalizations (OR 5228.78, P = 0.018). Complications did not significantly vary between procedure type. The authors conclude that United States national data confirm benefits of endoscopic surgery, including a lower risk of transfusion, shorter hospital stay, and lower hospital costs, without a significant change in the rate of inpatient complications. Racial, socioeconomic, and geographic factors were not significantly associated with treatment type or perioperative surgical outcomes.

A total of 818 cases were recruited. Overall vaccine coverage was 39.6% (26.9% in those younger than 65y and 51.9% in those older than 64y; p<0.001). Age<65 y (OR: 2.38; CI 95%: 1.68-3.36), alcoholic etiology (OR: 2.40; CI 95%: 1.49-3.85), birth abroad (OR: 2.7; CI 95%: 1.10-6.61), and residence in South/Sardinia island (OR 1.66; CI 95%: 1.14-2.42) all resulted independent predictors of the likelihood of lack of vaccination. Lack of information regarding the vaccine as reason of no vaccination was reported by 71.4% of foreigners and by 34.7% of natives (p< 0.001). In conclusion much work still should be done for improve coverage among groups at higher risk of lack of vaccination identified in this survey.

Traditional knowledge translation (KT) strategies have tended to target academics by disseminating findings in academic journals and at scientific conferences. Alternative strategies, such as theatre-based KT, appear to be effective at targeting broader audiences. The purpose of this scoping review is to collate and understand the current state of science on the use of theatre as a KT strategy. This will allow us to identify gaps in literature, determine the need for a systematic review and develop additional research questions to advance the field. METHODS AND ANALYSIS This review will follow established scoping review methods outlined by Arksey and O'Malley in conjunction with enhanced recommendations made by Levac et al. The search strategy, guided by an experienced librarian, will be conducted in PubMed, CINHAL and OVID. Study selection will consist of three stages: (1) initial title and abstract scan by one author to remove irrelevant articles and create a shortlist for double screening, (2) title and abstract scan by two authors, and (3) full-text review by two authors. Included studies will report specifically on the use of theatre as means of KT of health-related information to any target population. Two reviewers will independently extract and chart the data using a standardised data extraction form. Descriptive statistics will be used to produce numerical summaries related to study characteristics, KT strategy characteristics and evaluation characteristics. For those studies that included an evaluation of the theatre production as a KT strategy, we will synthesise the data according to outcome. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Ethical approval was not required for this study. Results will be published in relevant journals, presented at conferences and distributed via social media.","Hall, Amanda; Furlong, Bradley; Pike, Andrea; Logan, Gabrielle; Lawrence, Rebecca; Ryan, Alexandra; Etchegary, Holly; Hennessey, Todd; Toomey, Elaine",BMJ open,384,16

In this study, Chinese children with RTIs were screened for HRV-C and their epidemiological and clinical characteristics were analyzed. From December 2006 to November 2007, 406 nasopharyngeal aspirates from children younger than 14 years of age with RTIs were screened for HRV and other common respiratory viruses by PCR or reverse transcription-PCR. Two-hundred twenty-four (55.2%) of the specimens were infected with at least one virus, including 53 patients with HRV (13%). HRV-A, HRV-B, and HRV-C were detected in 22, 12, and 19 specimens, respectively. HRV-C was detected mainly from December 2006 to April 2007 and from October to November 2007, with peaks in December and April (10/19). Acute upper respiratory infection and bronchopneumonia were observed in 53 and 37% of the cases, respectively. The most common symptoms were cough (82%), runny nose (53%), and fever (37%). Wheezing and bronchiolitis were less common in patients infected with HRV-C than in those infected with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Partial sequencing of the genes coding for VP4 and VP2 revealed that the HRV-C strains were 56 to 62% identical at the amino acid level to HRV-B and HRV-A reference strains and 80 to 99% identical to HRV-C reference strains. In conclusion, HRV-C is an important cause of RTIs in children, and highly diversified strains of HRV-C are prevalent in China. HRV-C may produce different epidemiological features, and patients infected with HRV-C may exhibit different clinical features from patients infected with RSV or HRV-A/B.","Jin, Yu; Yuan, Xin-Hui; Xie, Zhi-Ping; Gao, Han-Chun; Song, Jing-Rong; Zhang, Rong-Fang; Xu, Zi-Qian; Zheng, Li-Shu; Hou, Yun-De; Duan, Zhao-Jun",Journal of clinical microbiology,384,20

NIRS readings were compared between the accessed versus non-accessed LE at baseline before start of case, time of vascular access, arterial sheath exchange when applicable, sheath withdrawal, and Safeguard application, deflation, and removal. 133 patients underwent 152 catheterizations with mean age 2.4 ± 2.3 years and mean weight 12.4 ± 13.2 kg. NIRS oximetry readings were significantly decreased in the LE with arterial access compared to non-accessed LE from time of sheath insertion until removal of the pressure assist device post procedure. A greater difference was noted in smaller patients. NIRS oximetry readings did not correlate with subjective assessment of lower extremity perfusion after arterial sheaths were removed. One patient had pulse loss 4 h post procedure with a decrease in oximetry readings noted at this point on review. Weight-based heparin protocol was initiated, and a gradual improvement in oximetry readings was noted over the next 5 h. Vascular ultrasound 12 h later showed no evidence of arterial thrombus. NIRS may be helpful in identifying patients who are risk for developing arterial thrombus post cardiac catheterization and for monitoring response to therapy; however, further study in these patients is warranted.","Herbert, Carrie E; Leshko, Jenny; Morelli, Dawn; Amankwah, Ernest; Hanson, Jade; Stapleton, Gary E",Pediatric cardiology,384,16

In contrast, Fischer 344 (F344) rats recover without complications. Previous studies determined that NF-κB activation and subunit composition were markedly different between these 2 rat strains. This study examined whether viral infection also resulted in altered pulmonary expression of IκBα and IκBβ, 2 inhibitory regulators of NF-κB. Western blot analyses of total pulmonary protein extracted from BN and F344 rats at 7, 10, and 14 days after inoculation (n = 5 per group) did not reveal virus-induced differences in IκBβ expression. In contrast, a lower molecular weight form of IκBα appeared in the BN rats at 14 days postinfection, and it was still present at 21 days after infection (n = 5 per group). The change in IκBα expression observed in the susceptible BN but not the resistant F344 animals occurs when the epithelium is proliferating during the repair phase, and it correlates with the development of the persistent virus-induced airway inflammation and pulmonary functional abnormalities. These results further implicate differential regulation of NF-κB in the pathogenesis of virus-induced asthma.","Uhl, E W; Clarke, T J; Lester, C; Hogan, R J",Veterinary pathology,384,1

Because of risks related to nuclear material proliferation, the use of HEU targets is being phased out and alternative strategies for production of both (99)Mo and (99m)Tc are being evaluated intensely. There are evidently no plans for replacement of the limited number of reactors that have primarily provided most of the (99)Mo.

The aim of this study is to elucidate the role of edema in subacute lesion progression and its influence on unfavorable functional outcome by quantifying net water uptake. Methods: We included all 187 patients from the MR CLEAN trial who had high quality follow-up non-contrast CT at 24 h and 1 week. Using a CT densitometry-based method to calculate the net water uptake, we differentiated total ischemic lesion volume (TILV) into edema volume (EV) and edema-corrected infarct volume (ecIV). We calculated these volumes at 24 h and 1 week after stroke and determined their progression in the subacute period. We assessed the effect of 24-h lesion characteristics on EV and ecIV progression. We evaluated the influence of edema and edema-corrected infarct progression on favorable functional outcome after 90 days (modified Rankin Scale: 0-2) after correcting for potential confounders. Lastly, we compared these volumes between subgroups of patients with and without successful recanalization using the Mann-Whitney U-test. Results: Median TILV increased from 37 (IQR: 18-81) ml to 68 (IQR: 30-130) ml between 24 h and 1 week after stroke, while the net water uptake increased from 22 (IQR: 16-26)% to 27 (IQR: 22-32)%. The TILV progression of 20 (8.8-40) ml was mostly caused by ecIV with a median increase of 12 (2.4-21) ml vs. 6.5 (2.7-15) ml of EV progression. Larger TILV, EV, and ecIV volumes at 24 h were all associated with more edema and lesion progression. Edema progression was associated with unfavorable functional outcome [aOR: 0.53 (0.28-0.94) per 10 ml; p-value: 0.05], while edema-corrected infarct progression showed a similar, non-significant association [aOR: 0.80 (0.62-0.99); p-value: 0.06]. Lastly, edema progression was larger in patients without successful recanalization, whereas ecIV progression was comparable between the subgroups. Conclusion: EV increases in evolving ischemic lesions in the period between 1 day and 1 week after acute ischemic stroke. This progression is larger in patients without successful recanalization and is associated with unfavorable functional outcome. However, the extent of edema cannot explain the total expansion of ischemic lesions since edema-corrected infarct progression is larger than the edema progression.","Konduri, Praneeta; van Kranendonk, Katinka; Boers, Anna; Treurniet, Kilian; Berkhemer, Olvert; Yoo, Albert J; van Zwam, Wim; van Oostenbrugge, Robert; van der Lugt, Aad; Dippel, Diederik; Roos, Yvo; Bot, Joost; Majoie, Charles; Marquering, Henk",Frontiers in neurology,384,1

OBJECTIVE To assess the long-term clinical and angiographic outcomes of stent-assisted embolization for wide-necked anterior communicating artery aneurysms. METHODS Between March 2008 and March 2014, 32 patients with unruptured wide-necked AComm aneurysms were treated using stent-assisted embolization. The Glasgow Outcome Scale was reviewed at the time of discharge and at latest follow-up. Ischemic and hemorrhagic events were also recorded and analyzed. Aneurysm occlusion was evaluated post-intervention and on subsequent follow-up evaluations. RESULTS Successful stent deployment was achieved in all cases, but in 1 patient the coils could not be contained inside the aneurysm, and the procedure was aborted without complications. The distal segment of the stent was positioned in the ipsilateral A2 in 16 patients, in the contralateral A2 in 15 patients, and in the contralateral A1 in 1 patient. There were no periprocedural thromboembolic or hemorrhagic complications. The rate of major complications was 6%. One patient developed intracranial hemorrhage related to antiplatelet therapy and another had ischemic events due to in-stent stenosis. Angiographic follow-up was available for 26 aneurysms and during a mean follow-up of 22 months, 81% of the lesions were completely occluded and 8% had a small residual neck. The retreatment rate for residual aneurysms was 3%. CONCLUSION Our long-term results suggest that stent-assisted embolization for anterior communicating artery aneurysms may be considered an excellent treatment option with an adequate combination of safety profile and effectiveness.","Brasiliense, Leonardo B C; Yoon, Jang W; Orina, Josiah N; Miller, David A; Tawk, Rabih G; Hanel, Ricardo A",Neurosurgery,384,1

Sterile magnetic drapes used to hold surgical instruments are often placed on the patient's thorax, and they are likely to interfere with the function of these devices. METHODS Thirty patients were recruited to compare a new prototype surgical magnetic drape (LT10G™ by Menodys) made with bottom-isolated ferrite magnets to the Covidien magnetic drape we used in a previous study. Twenty additional patients were recruited to compare the prototype drape with four commercially available surgical magnetic drapes. RESULTS Magnetic interference was found in 33 of the 50 total patients (70 %) when the Covidien drape was placed over the pacemaker. Of the 20 additional patients, 5 patients (25 %) displayed magnetic interference with a second type of surgical magnetic drape. A third magnetic drape caused interference in one patient (5 %), whereas a larger drape of the same model did not interfere in any patient. No patients demonstrated magnetic interference with the prototype drape. CONCLUSION Bottom isolation of magnets in the prototype magnetic drape (LT10G™) used during surgery prevents magnetic interference in all patients when placed over the pacemaker. Three of the four commercially available magnetic drapes tested demonstrated magnetic interference. Flipping the prototype drape is not recommended as it may expose non-isolated magnets to the cardiovascular implantable electronic device.","Zaphiratos, Valerie; Chiasson, Hubert; Drolet, Pierre; Benzaquen, Bruno; Lapointe, Jacques; Fortier, Louis-Philippe",Biomedical engineering online,384,28

We report an evaluation over 22 reference collections (most are related to public health topics) screened using RobotAnalyst with a total of 43 610 abstract-level decisions. The number of references that needed to be screened to identify 95% of the abstract-level inclusions for the evidence review was reduced on 19 of the 22 collections. Significant gains over random sampling were achieved for all reviews conducted with active prioritisation, as compared with only two of five when prioritisation was not used. RobotAnalyst's descriptive clustering and topic modelling functionalities were also evaluated by public health analysts. Descriptive clustering provided more coherent organisation than topic modelling, and the content of the clusters was apparent to the users across a varying number of clusters. This is the first large-scale study using technology-assisted screening to perform new reviews, and the positive results provide empirical evidence that RobotAnalyst can accelerate the identification of relevant studies. The results also highlight the issue of user complacency and the need for a stopping criterion to realise the work savings.","Przybyła, Piotr; Brockmeier, Austin J; Kontonatsios, Georgios; Le Pogam, Marie-Annick; McNaught, John; von Elm, Erik; Nolan, Kay; Ananiadou, Sophia",Research synthesis methods,384,1

The outcomes currently measured and reported in randomised controlled trials of early childhood obesity prevention interventions to reduce this burden of obesity are heterogeneous, and measured in a variety of ways. This variability limits the comparability of findings between studies, and contributes to research waste. This protocol presents the methodology for the development of two core outcome sets (COS) for obesity prevention interventions in children aged from 1 to 5 years from a singular development process: (1) a COS for interventions targeting physical activity and sedentary behaviour and (2) a COS for interventions targeting child feeding and dietary intake. Core outcomes related to physical activity and sedentary behaviour in children aged ≤1 year will also be identified to complement an existing COS for early feeding interventions, and provide a broader set of core outcomes in this age range. This will result in a suite of COS useful for measuring and reporting outcomes in early childhood obesity prevention studies, including multicomponent interventions. METHODS AND ANALYSIS Development of the COS will follow international best practice guidelines. A scoping review of trial registries will identify commonly reported outcomes and associated measurement instruments. Key stakeholders involved in obesity prevention, including policy-makers/funders, parents, researchers, health practitioners and community and organisational stakeholders will participate in an e-Delphi study and consensus meeting regarding inclusion of outcomes in the COS.

Nevertheless, data about optimal prewarming-time from published clinical trials report contradictory results. We conducted this pilot study to evaluate routine clinical practice regarding prewarming and its effect on the prevalence of perioperative hypothermia in patients undergoing transurethral resection (TUR) under spinal anesthesia. This was a prospective, observational, pilot study to examine clinical practice in a tertiary hospital regarding prewarming in 140 consecutive patients. When prewarming (pw) was performed, forced-air warming was provided in the pre-anesthesia room for 15 (pw15), 30 (pw30), or 45 (pw45) min. Tympanic temperature was recorded upon entering the pre-anesthesia room, at the time of initiating surgery, and every 15 min intra-operatively. We also recorded duration of the surgical procedure and length of stay in the Post-Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU). Pw15 was performed in 34 patients, pw30 in 29 patients, and pw45 in 21 patients. Fifty-six patients did not receive pw and 96% of them developed hypothermia at the end of the surgical procedure, compared to 73% of patients in pw15 (p = 0.002), 75% in pw30 (p = 0.006) and 90% in pw45 (p = 0.3). Length of stay in the PACU was markedly shorter in pw15 (131 ± 69 min) and pw30 (123 ± 60 min) than in the non-pw group (197 ± 105 min) (p = 0.015 and p = 0.011, respectively). This difference was not significant in pw45 (129 ± 56 min) compared to non-pw patients. In conclusion, prewarming for 15 or 30 min before TUR under spinal anesthesia prevents development of hypothermia at the end of the surgical procedure.","Becerra, Ángel; Valencia, Lucía; Ferrando, Carlos; Villar, Jesús; Rodríguez-Pérez, Aurelio",Scientific reports,384,1

However, the importance of including a robust debriefing as a component of these simulations is often neglected. PROBLEM Failing to include debriefing with screen-based simulation could negatively impact student learning outcomes. APPROACH Debriefing, including recollection, discussion to reveal understanding, feedback and reflection, is a process of helping learners make sense of learned content and knowledge as it is applied to the patient care experience. Debriefing for Meaningful Learning (DML) is an evidence-based method derived from theory, which can be easily incorporated into screen-based simulation to augment the clinical learning experience. CONCLUSION By guiding learners to consistently engage in DML, clinical decisions and actions taken during virtual simulations can be uncovered, discussed, challenged, corrected, and explored. Including a synchronous, structured debriefing like DML ensures that screen-based simulation results in meaningful learning in addition to performance feedback to foster safe and quality patient care.","Dreifuerst, Kristina T; Bradley, Cynthia S; Johnson, Brandon K",Nurse educator,384,1

This is supported in part by cross-sectional evidence for increased levels of proinflammatory eicosanoids, cytokines and acute-phase proteins during mood episodes, and prospective longitudinal evidence for the emergence of mood symptoms in response to chronic immune-inflammatory activation. In addition, mood-stabilizer and atypical antipsychotic medications downregulate initial components of the immune-inflammatory signaling pathway, and adjunctive treatment with anti-inflammatory agents augment the therapeutic efficacy of antidepressant, mood stabilizer and atypical antipsychotic medications. Potential pathogenic mechanisms linked with elevated immune-inflammatory signaling include perturbations in central serotonin neurotransmission and progressive white matter pathology. Both heritable genetic factors and environmental factors including dietary fatty-acid composition may act in concert to sustain elevated immune-inflammatory signaling.

This infectious virus spreads like wildfire, already affected millions worldwide, and the numbers are still increasing. This situation warrants a comprehensive strategy backed by futuristic estimations to counter COVID-19 adversities. Like any other country globally, India is also encountering an uphill task to fight against this unfortunate pandemic, with six million-plus COVID-19 cumulative infected cases by the first week of October 2020. This publication elucidates the use of four state-of-art models, namely the Abbasov - Mamedova (AM) Fuzzy, proposed Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Auto-ARIMA, and Auto-MLP, to forecast the number of cumulative infected COVID-19 cases in India. These models exhibited high forecast accuracy for 30 days ahead scenario with MAPE ranges from 0.44 to 1.83% in the test condition, whereas a MAPE range of 1.09 to 2.39% in real-time. We estimated the COVID-19 cases fortnightly and observed that the proposed MLP exhibited the flattening of the COVID-19 curve, whereas other models exhibited a rising trend. Though our proposed MLP outperformed other models, we employed all four methods and estimated a range between 8.53 to 13.77 million COVID-19 positives by 4th January 2021 in India. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Chakraborty, A.; Mitra, S.; Das, D.; De, D.; Pal, A.

Nearly one-third of known protein structures contain metal ions that are used for a variety of needs, such as catalysis, DNA/RNA binding, protein structure stability, etc. Identifying metal-binding proteins is thus crucial for understanding the mechanisms of cellular activity. However, experimental annotation of protein metal-binding potential is severely lacking, while computational techniques are often imprecise and of limited applicability. We developed a novel machine learning-based method, mebipred, for identifying metal-binding proteins from sequence-derived features. This method is nearly 90% accurate in recognizing proteins that bind metal ions and ion containing ligands. Moreover, the identity of ten ubiquitously present metal ions and ion-containing ligands can be annotated. mebipred is reference-free, i.e. no sequence alignments are involved, and outperforms other prediction methods, both in speed and accuracy. mebipred can also identify protein metal-binding capabilities from short sequence stretches and, thus, may be useful for the annotation of metagenomic samples metal requirements inferred from translated sequencing reads. We performed an analysis of microbiome data and found that ocean, hot spring sediments and soil microbiomes use a more diverse set of metals than human host-related ones. For human-hosted microbiomes, physiological conditions explain the observed metal preferences. Similarly, subtle changes in ocean sample ion concentration affect the abundance of relevant metal-binding proteins.

Most of these robots are designed with human-aware motion planning capabilities but are not designed to communicate with pedestrians. Pedestrians that encounter these robots without prior understanding of the robots' behaviour can experience discomfort, confusion, and delayed social acceptance. In this work we designed and evaluated nonverbal robot motion legibility cues, which communicate a mobile robot's motion intention to pedestrians. We compared a motion legibility cue using Projected Arrows to one using Flashing Lights. We designed the cues to communicate path information, goal information, or both, and explored different Robot Movement Scenarios. We conducted an online user study with 229 participants using videos of the motion legibility cues. Our results show that the absence of cues was not socially acceptable, and that Projected Arrows were the more socially acceptable cue in most experimental conditions. We conclude that the presence and choice of motion legibility cues can positively influence robots' acceptance and successful deployment in public spaces.","Hetherington, Nicholas J.; Croft, Elizabeth A.; Columbia, H.

As the expression of CD38+HLA-DR+ is poorly understood, we used mouse models of influenza A/H7N9, A/H3N2 and A/H1N1 infection to investigate the mechanisms underpinning CD38+MHC-II+ phenotype on CD8+ T-cells. Our analysis of influenza-specific immunodominant DbNP366+CD8+ T-cell responses showed that CD38+MHC-II+ co-expression was detected on both virus-specific and bystander CD8+ T-cells, with increased numbers of both CD38+MHC-II+CD8+ T-cell populations observed in the respiratory tract during severe infection. To understand the mechanisms underlying CD38 and MHC-II expression, we also used adoptively-transferred transgenic OT-I CD8+ T-cells recognising the ovalbumin-derived KbSIINFEKL epitope and A/H1N1-SIINKEKL infection. Strikingly, we found that OT-I cells adoptively-transferred into MHC-II−/− mice did not display MHC-II after influenza virus infection, suggesting that MHC-II was acquired via trogocytosis in wild-type mice. Additionally, detection of CD19 on CD38+MHC II+ OT-I cells further supports that MHC-II was acquired by trogocytosis, at least partially, sourced from B-cells. Our results also revealed that co-expression of CD38+MHC II+ on CD8+ T-cells was needed for the optimal recall ability following secondary viral challenge. Overall, our study provides evidence that both virus-specific and bystander CD38+MHC-II+ CD8+ T-cells are recruited to the site of infection during severe disease, and that MHC-II expression occurs via trogocytosis from antigen-presenting cells. Our findings also highlight the importance of the CD38+MHC II+ phenotype for CD8+ T-cell memory establishment and recall. Summary Co-expression of CD38 and MHC-II on CD8+ T cells is recognized as a classical hallmark of activation during viral infections. High and prolonged CD38+HLA-DR+ expression, however, can be associated with severe disease outcomes and the mechanisms are unclear. Using our established influenza wild-type and transgenic mouse models, we determined how disease severity affected the activation of influenza-specific CD38+MHC-II+CD8+ T cell responses in vivo and the antigenic determinants that drive their activation and expansion. Overall, our study provides evidence that both virus-specific and bystander CD38+MHC-II+ CD8+ T-cells are recruited to the site of infection during severe disease, and that MHC-II expression occurs, at least in part, via trogocytosis from antigen-presenting cells.

To investigate the requirements for frameshifting at the gag-pro overlap, we have inserted a stretch of 58 nucleotides containing the proposed frameshift signal into a plasmid that allows monitoring of translation in all three reading frames. In vitro translation of mRNAs derived from this plasmid indicated that the 58 nucleotides from the SRV-1 gag-pro overlap were sufficient to induce an efficient -1 shift in a heterologous context. Mutational analysis demonstrated that the slip site is formed at the heptanucleotide G GGA AAC. The frameshift efficiency of the wild type sequence in rabbit reticulocyte lysate was 23%. A second component of the frameshift signal is formed by a pseudoknot seven bases downstream of the slip site. The presence of this pseudoknot was confirmed by mutational analysis, employing complementary and compensatory base changes, and by probing the structure of short RNA transcripts containing the frameshift signal. Adding increasing amounts of an SRV-1 pseudoknot containing RNA transcript to a translation reaction programmed with an SRV-1 frameshift reporter mRNA had no effect on the frameshift efficiency, arguing against the role of a specific pseudoknot-recognising factor in the frameshifting process.","ten Dam, E; Brierley, I; Inglis, S; Pleij, C",,384,1

These twin assaults threaten to eliminate the incentives necessary for biotechnological innovation--particularly for discoveries made upstream in the innovation pipeline--thus imperiling the development of new drug therapies. But a fascinating solution has emerged: invoking tribal immunity to shield pharmaceutical patents from IPR before the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (""PTAB""). This serves two critically important objectives: promoting tribal self-sufficiency, and encouraging investment in life-saving and life-improving new drugs. Contractual partnerships between Native American tribes and pharmaceutical companies not only provide the tribes with a steady stream of royalty revenue, but also insulate biopharmaceutical patents from challenge in IPR proceedings through the invocation of long-established principles of tribal sovereign immunity.

Virions of strains that do not express HE, such as MHV-A59, can infect mouse fibroblasts in vitro, showing that the HE glycoprotein is not required for infection of these cells. The present work was done to study whether interaction of the HE glycoprotein with carbohydrate moieties could lead to virus entry and infection in the absence of interaction of the S glycoprotein with its receptor glycoprotein, MHVR. The DVIM strain of MHV expresses large amounts of HE glycoprotein, as shown by hemadsorption, acetylesterase activity, and immunoreactivity with antibodies directed against the HE glycoprotein of bovine coronavirus. A monoclonal anti-MHVR antibody, MAb-CC1, blocks binding of virus S glycoprotein to MHVR and blocks infection of MHV strains that do not express HE. MAb-CC1 also prevented MHV-DVIM infection of mouse DBT cells and primary mouse glial cell cultures. Although MDCK-I cells express O-acetylated sialic acid residues on their plasma membranes, these canine cells were resistant to infection with MHV-A59 and MHV-DVIM. Transfection of MDCK-I cells with MHVR cDNA made them susceptible to infection with MHV-A59 and MHV-DVIM. Thus, the HE glycoprotein of an MHV strain did not lead to infection of cultured murine neural cells or of nonmurine cells that express the carbohydrate ligand of the HE glycoprotein. Therefore, interaction of the spike glycoprotein of MHV with its carcinoembryonic antigen-related receptor glycoprotein is required for infectivity of MHV strains whether or not they express the HE glycoprotein.","Gagneten, S; Gout, O; Dubois-Dalcq, M; Rottier, P; Rossen, J; Holmes, K V",Journal of virology,384,9

METHODS A retrospective population-based study using hospital discharge records with a KS diagnosis for children younger than 15 years selected from the Danish National Hospital Register for 1981-2004. Incidence rates were calculated using the number of KS patients and corresponding census data. RESULTS During 1981-2004, 360 children younger than 15 years were hospitalized with KS in Denmark, with 73% younger than 5 years. In this age group, the average annual incidence of KS gradually increased from 1981 to 1999 and thereafter stabilized at 4.5 to 5.0 per 100,000 person-years. The incidence was greater for boys than for girls (RR = 1.6, 95% CI = 1.2-2.0) and was highest among infants younger than 1 year (4.5), declining with increasing age (P = 0.03). However, the age-specific decline in incidence was only observed for boys, whereas the incidence for girls remained unchanged by age. The median length of hospital stay was 12 days, and the incidence peaked in the winter months. CONCLUSIONS Major epidemiologic characteristics identified among Danish childhood KS are consistent with those described in previous studies, such as highest incidence among young children and winter-seasonality. The KS incidence rate among children younger than 5 years in Denmark increased steadily during the early study period (coinciding with global recognition of KS) and seems to have stabilized from 1998-1999 onwards. Although the incidence among Danish children was lower than that reported for several other European countries, differences in methodology challenge definite comparisons.","Fischer, Thea K; Holman, Robert C; Yorita, Krista L; Belay, Ermias D; Melbye, Mads; Koch, Anders",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,384,10

Molecular clock analysis shows that P.1 emergence occurred around mid-November 2020 and was preceded by a period of faster molecular evolution. Using a two-category dynamical model that integrates genomic and mortality data, we estimate that P.1 may be 1.7- to 2.4-fold more transmissible and that previous (non-P.1) infection provides 54 to 79% of the protection against infection with P.1 that it provides against non-P.1 lineages. Enhanced global genomic surveillance of variants of concern, which may exhibit increased transmissibility and/or immune evasion, is critical to accelerate pandemic responsiveness.","Faria, Nuno R; Mellan, Thomas A; Whittaker, Charles; Claro, Ingra M; Candido, Darlan da S; Mishra, Swapnil; Crispim, Myuki A E; Sales, Flavia C S; Hawryluk, Iwona; McCrone, John T; Hulswit, Ruben J G; Franco, Lucas A M; Ramundo, Mariana S; de Jesus, Jaqueline G; Andrade, Pamela S; Coletti, Thais M; Ferreira, Giulia M; Silva, Camila A M; Manuli, Erika R; Pereira, Rafael H M; Peixoto, Pedro S; Kraemer, Moritz U G; Gaburo, Nelson; Camilo, Cecilia da C; Hoeltgebaum, Henrique; Souza, William M; Rocha, Esmenia C; de Souza, Leandro M; de Pinho, Mariana C; Araujo, Leonardo J T; Malta, Frederico S V; de Lima, Aline B; Silva, Joice do P; Zauli, Danielle A G; Ferreira, Alessandro C de S; Schnekenberg, Ricardo P; Laydon, Daniel J; Walker, Patrick G T; Schlüter, Hannah M; Dos Santos, Ana L P; Vidal, Maria S; Del Caro, Valentina S; Filho, Rosinaldo M F; Dos Santos, Helem M; Aguiar, Renato S; Proença-Modena, José L; Nelson, Bruce; Hay, James A; Monod, Mélodie; Miscouridou, Xenia",Science,384,1

Critical COVID-19 is thought to be associated with a hyper-inflammatory process that can develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome, a critical disease normally mediated by dysfunctional neutrophils. This study tested the hypothesis whether the neutrophil compartment displays characteristics of hyperinflammation in COVID-19 patients. Therefore, a prospective study was performed on all patients with suspected COVID-19 presenting at the emergency room of a large academic hospital. Blood drawn within 2 d after hospital presentation was analyzed by point-of-care automated flow cytometry and compared with blood samples collected at later time points. COVID-19 patients did not exhibit neutrophilia or eosinopenia. Unexpectedly neutrophil activation markers (CD11b, CD16, CD10, and CD62L) did not differ between COVID-19-positive patients and COVID-19-negative patients diagnosed with other bacterial/viral infections, or between COVID-19 severity groups. In all patients, a decrease was found in the neutrophil maturation markers indicating an inflammation-induced left shift of the neutrophil compartment. In COVID-19 this was associated with disease severity.","Spijkerman, Roy; Bongers, Suzanne H; Bindels, Bas J J; Tinnevelt, Gerjen H; Giustarini, Giulio; Jorritsma, Nikita K N; Buitenwerf, Wiebe; van Spengler, Daan E J; Delemarre, Eveline M; Nierkens, Stefan; van Goor, Harriët M R; Jansen, Jeroen J; Vrisekoop, Nienke; Hietbrink, Falco; Leenen, Luke P H; Kaasjager, Karin A H; Koenderman, Leo",J Leukoc Biol,384,26

The phenomenon of Simpson's paradox teaches us that we should be careful when we combine two variables together.

Given the overburdening of the healthcare system and limited access to medical services due to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic outbreak, this study aimed to evaluate the preparedness of Polish pharmacy employees for patient education on the new threat. The study was conducted using the mystery shopper method. Two interviewers phoned 90 randomly chosen community pharmacies throughout Poland and presented some inquiries on the SARS-CoV-2. Pharmacists devoted more time to patients than pharmacy technicians (2:22 vs. 1:54), and the information they provided was significantly more comprehensive (p = 0.006). The majority of respondents provided an evidence-based recommendation on prevention, symptoms, and management of SARS-CoV-2; however, the scope of advice significantly varied. Community pharmacy staff often expressed their concern about the lack of time to address patients' questions adequately. No statistically significant differences were found in recommendations provided by chain and non-chain pharmacy staff. Obtained results seem to confirm the possibility of involving pharmacists in public health activities during a pandemic.

METHOD: Dystonia identification in CP, particularly when comorbid with spasticity, can be difficult. The dystonia diagnostic criterion standard remains subjective visual identification by expert consensus. For this qualitative study, we conducted an inductive thematic analysis of consensus-building discussions between three pediatric movement disorder physicians as they identified the presence or absence of dystonia in gait videos of 40 participants with spastic CP and periventricular leukomalacia. RESULTS: Unanimous consensus about the presence or absence of dystonia was achieved for 34 out of 40 videos. Two main themes were present during consensus-building discussions as videos were evaluated for dystonia: (1) unilateral leg or foot adduction that was variable over time, and (2) difficulty in identifying dystonia. Codes contributing to the first theme were more likely to be cited by a discussant when they felt dystonia was present (as opposed to absent) in a video (&#967;2 test, p=0.004). DISCUSSION: These results describe the gait features cited by experts during consensus-building discussion as they identify dystonia in ambulatory people with CP.

While didactic courses moved online, laboratory courses were not amenable to this shift. In particular, assessment of clinical skills courses through common methods including objective structured clinical examinations (OSCEs) became inadvisable. This article describes decisions made for first-, second-, and third-year veterinary students (n = 368) with respect to clinical skills at one US college. This includes the remote completion of a surgical skills curriculum using instructional videos and models and the delaying of laboratory sessions deemed impossible to deliver remotely. First- and third-year students were subsequently assessed using modified remote OSCEs. Second-year students were assessed using the standard surgical skills examination, video-recorded. All first- and third-year students successfully passed their OSCE upon either first attempt or remediation. Two second-year students failed their remediation examination and were offered additional faculty tutoring and another remediation attempt at the start of the fall semester. The remediation rate on the surgical skills examination was not different from that of previous years. One incident of suspected academic dishonesty occurred in the first-year OSCE. Students learned surgical skills successfully at home by practicing on models and receiving feedback of their skills on video recordings. While disappointing, one case of academic dishonesty among the 368 total students tested was not surprising. Remote assessment using modified OSCEs and surgical skills exams appears feasible and fair when in-person testing is not possible.","Hunt, Julie A; Anderson, Stacy L",J Vet Med Educ,384,22

At the early stages of the pandemic, Ecuador was one of the most affected countries in Latin America. The objective of this study was to assess the levels of depression, anxiety and stress in the Ecuadorian general population during the social isolation period due to COVID-19. METHODS: A web-based survey consisting of 31 short-answer and multiple-choice questions was administered to the general population from April 22-May 3, 2020. Mental health status was assessed through the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 Items (DASS-21) questionnaire. Ordinal logistic analyses were used to identify potential risk factors associated with the severity of mental health issues. RESULTS: A total of 626 individuals were included. Most of them were females (60.5%), and their mean age was 29.6 ± 11.7 years. Approximately 17.7% of the respondents had moderate to very severe levels of depression, 30.7% had similar levels of anxiety, and 14.2% experienced stress. Female sex, younger age, student status, and having a relative diagnosed with COVID-19 were associated with significantly higher levels of depression, anxiety and stress. Ordinal regression models showed that being a student was a risk factor for having more severe levels of depression (OR = 3.67; 95% CI = 2.56-5.26, p: 0.0001), anxiety (OR= 1.86; 95% CI= 1.35-2.55, p: 0.0001), and stress (OR = 2.17; 95% CI= 1.47-3.19, p: 0.0001). Having a relative with COVID-19 was also found to be a risk factor only for depression (OR= 1.70; 95% CI= 1.03-2.80, p: 0.036) and anxiety (OR = 2.17; 95% CI= 1.35-3.47, p: 0.001). Additionally, male sex, older age, and having more children were found to be protective factors for the three conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that social isolation due to the COVID-19 outbreak has impacted the mental health of the general population in Ecuador. We identified potential risk and protective factors that could serve as a foundation from which to develop psychological strategies to safeguard the mental health of our population during the current pandemic.","Mautong, Hans; Gallardo-Rumbea, Jorge Andrés; Alvarado-Villa, Geovanny Efraín; Fernández-Cadena, Juan Carlos; Andrade-Molina, Derly; Orellana-Román, Carlos Enrique; Cherrez-Ojeda, Iván",BMC Psychiatry,384,21

This study aimed to explore the perspective and experiences of compounding pharmacists on production and utilization of ABHR solution for coronavirus disease in 2019 (COVID-19) prevention in public hospitals of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. METHODS: A descriptive qualitative study using in-depth interview of 13 key-informants serving as compounding pharmacists in public hospitals of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, was conducted. The study participants were identified and selected by purposive sampling. All transcribed interviews were subjected to thematic analysis and transcripts were analyzed manually. FINDINGS: The compounding pharmacists in this study had a mean age of 30.6 (±3.1) years and nine of the thirteen participants were men. Ten participants believed that the compounding practice in their respective sites followed the principles of good compounding practice. More than half of the participants did not believe that ABHR products were used rationally in health facilities. They argued that users did not have enough awareness when and how to use sanitizers. Most of the interviewees reported that compounding personnel had no formal training on ABHR solution production. Study participants suggested incentive mechanisms and reimbursements for experts involved in the compounding of ABHR solutions. CONCLUSION: Three of the compounding pharmacists indicated that ABHR production in their setting lack compliance to good compounding practice due to inadequate compounding room, quality control tests, manpower and equipment. Despite this, most study participants preferred the in-house ABHR products than the commercially available ones. Thus, training, regular monitoring and follow-up of the hospital compounding services can further build staff confidence.","Baye, Assefa Mulu; Ababu, Andualem; Bayisa, Regasa; Abdella, Mahdi; Diriba, Edessa; Wale, Minyechel; Selam, Muluken Nigatu",PLoS One,384,26

No studies have investigated the effect of thyroid nodules on the prognosis of patients with COVID-19. In this study, we investigated the effect of thyroid hormonal disorders and thyroid nodules on the prognosis of patients with COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective study was conducted at the Sirnak State Hospital (Pandemic hospital in Turkey) between 15 March and 15 August 2020. We evaluated thyroid hormonal disorder and thyroid nodules in 125 patients who were admitted to the non-intensive care unit (non-ICU) due to mild COVID-19 pneumonia (group 1) and 125 critically ill patients who were admitted to the ICU (group 2). RESULTS: Thyroid-stimulating hormone levels (TSH) were not significantly different between groups 1 and 2; however, group 2 patients had significantly lower levels of free thyroxine (FT4) and free triiodothyronine (FT3) as compared to group 1 (P = .005, P < .0001, respectively). FT3 level showed a negative correlation with length of hospital stay and C-reactive protein level (rho: -0.216, p: 0.001; rho: -0.383, P < .0001). Overt thyroid disorder was observed in 13 patients [2 patients in group 1 (both with overt thyrotoxicosis) and 11 patients in group 2 (3 overt hypothyroidism, 8 overt thyrotoxicosis) (P = .01)]. Thyroid nodules sized &#8805;1 cm were found in 9 patients (7%) in group 1 and 32 patients (26%) in group 2 (P < .0001). CONCLUSION: Overt thyroid hormonal disorders were more common in critically ill COVID-19 patients. FT3 level at hospital admission is a potential prognostic marker of COVID-19 patients.

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 1 (SARS-CoV-1) may cause severe orchitis leading to germ cell destruction in males. Reports indicate decreased sperm concentration and motility for 72-90 days following Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. Gonadotropin-dependent expression of ACE2 was found in human ovaries, but it is unclear whether SARS-Coronavirus 2 (CoV-2) adversely affects female gametogenesis. Evidence suggests that COVID-19 infection has a lower maternal case fatality rate than SARS or Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), but anecdotal reports suggest that infected, asymptomatic women may develop respiratory symptoms postpartum. Coronavirus Disease 2019 infections in pregnancy are associated with preterm delivery. Postpartum neonatal transmission from mother to child has been reported. CONCLUSION(S): Coronavirus Disease 2019 infection may affect adversely some pregnant women and their offspring. Additional studies are needed to assess effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on male and female fertility.","Segars, James; Katler, Quinton; McQueen, Dana B; Kotlyar, Alexander; Glenn, Tanya; Knight, Zac; Feinberg, Eve C; Taylor, Hugh S; Toner, James P; Kawwass, Jennifer F",Fertil Steril,384,0

Robust correlates of severe COVID-19 include old age, male sex, poverty and co-morbidities such as obesity, diabetes or cardiovascular disease. A precise knowledge is still lacking of the molecular and biological mechanisms that may explain the association of severe disease with male sex. Here, we show that testosterone trajectories are highly accurate individual predictors (AUC of ROC = 0.928, p < 0.0001) of survival in male COVID-19 patients. Longitudinal determinations of blood levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) and androstenedione suggest an early modest inhibition of the central LH-androgen biosynthesis axis in a majority of patients, followed by either full recovery in survivors or a peripheral failure in lethal cases. Moreover, failure to reinstate physiological testosterone levels was associated with evidence of impaired T helper differentiation and decrease of non-classical monocytes. The strong association of recovery or failure to reinstate testosterone levels with survival or death from COVID-19 in male patients is suggestive of a significant role of testosterone status in the immune responses to COVID-19.","Toscano-Guerra, Emily; Martinez-Gallo, Monica; Arrese-Munoz, Iria; Gine, Anna; Diaz-Troyano, Noelia; Gabriel-Medina, Pablo; Riveiro-Barciela, Mar; Labrador-Horrillo, Moises; Martinez-Valle, Fernando; Hernandez-Gonzalez, Manuel; Rodriguez-Frias, Francisco; Borrell, Ricardo Pujol; Ferrer, Roser; Thomson, Timothy M; Paciucci, Rosanna",,384,24

Countries around the world have implemented various types of blockades to stop this infection. These health measures have led to a significant reduction in air pollution. However, the impact of these measures on aquatic environments has been little analyzed. In this context, the water quality of rivers in the Mantaro River basin was evaluated using multivariate statistical methods and heavy metal contamination indices during the health crisis of the COVID-19 pandemic. Surface water samples were collected in triplicate from 15 sampling sectors at the end of the rainy season, between March and April. Concentrations of Cu, Fe, Pb, Zn and As were determined by the method of atomic absorption flame spectrophotometry. The average concentrations of heavy metals and arsenic in the rivers evaluated did not exceed the environmental quality standards for drinking water of the Peruvian, WHO and US EPA regulations, except for Pb, Fe and As in the Mantaro River and As in the Chia River. PCA presented a total variation percentage of 83.8%. The results showed a clear positive relationship between the five heavy metals and metalloids. The hierarchical cluster analysis according to Spearman's correlation generated a dendrogram where the five chemical elements were grouped in two statistically significant groups, one group conglomerating to Cu, Pb, Zn and Fe and the other group to As. PERMANOVA partition shows that the spatial effects of the sectors are strong and significant. The HPI revealed that 13.33% of the sampling sectors exceeded the critical contamination value (150). The Cd revealed low degree of contamination (&lt;1) in 86.67% of the sampling sectors.

In this study, we develop primary human lung epithelial infection models to understand initial responses of proximal and distal lung epithelium to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Differentiated air-liquid interface (ALI) cultures of proximal airway epithelium and alveosphere cultures of distal lung AT2 cells are readily infected by SARS-CoV-2, leading to an epithelial cell-autonomous proinflammatory response with increased expression of interferon signaling genes.

Canada reported its first case of COVID-19 on 25th January 2020. By March 2020 the virus had spread within Canadian communities reaching the most frail and vulnerable elderly population in long-term care facilities. The majority of cases were reported in the provinces of Quebec, Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia and the highest mortality was seen among individuals aged 65 years or older. Canada has the highest prevalence and incidence rates of several chronic inflammatory diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease and Parkinson's disease. Many elderly Canadians also live with comorbid medical illnesses, such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and chronic lung disease and are more likely to suffer from severe COVID-19 with a poor prognosis. It is becoming increasingly evident that underlying inflammatory disease contributes to SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. Here, we review the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the host inflammatory responses that lead to resolution or progression to severe COVID-19 disease.

229599,229599,229599,Limiting the areas inspected by lung ultrasound leads to an underestimation of COVID-19 patients' condition,19.627096,9.82895,2021,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of the RAAS-COVID-19 randomized control trial is to evaluate whether an upfront strategy of temporary discontinuation of renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibition versus continuation of RAAS inhibition among patients admitted with established COVID-19 infection has an impact on short term clinical and biomarker outcomes. We hypothesize that continuation of RAAS inhibition will be superior to temporary discontinuation with regards to the primary endpoint of a global rank sum score. The global rank sum score has been successfully used in previous cardiovascular clinical trials. TRIAL DESIGN: This is an open label parallel two arm (1,1 ratio) randomized control superiority trial of approximately 40 COVID-19 patients who are on chronic RAAS inhibitor therapy. PARTICIPANTS: Adults who are admitted to hospital within the McGill University Health Centre systems (MUHC) including Royal Victoria Hospital (RVH), Montreal General Hospital (MGH) and Jewish General Hospital (JGH) and who are within 96 hours of COVID-19 diagnosis (confirmed via PCR on any biological sample) will be considered for the trial. Of note, the initial protocol to screen and enrol within 48 hours of COVID-19 diagnosis was extended through an amendment, to 96 hours to increase feasibility. Participants have to be 18 years or older and would have to be on RAAS inhibitors for at least a month to be considered eligible for the study. Additionally, RAAS inhibitors should not have been held for more than 48 hours before randomization. A list of inclusion and exclusion criteria can be found in the full protocol document. In order to prevent heart failure exacerbation, patients with reduced ejection fraction were excluded from the trial. Once a patient is admitted on the ward with a diagnosis of COVID-19, we will confirm with the treating physician if the participant is suitable for the RAAS-COVID trial and meets all the inclusion and exclusion criteria. If the patient is eligible and informed consent has been obtained we will collect data on sex, age, ethnicity, past medical history and list of medications (e.g. other anti-hypertensives or anticoagulants), for further analysis. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: All the study participants will be randomized to a strategy of temporarily holding the RAAS inhibitor [intervention] versus continuing the RAAS inhibitor [continued standard of care]. Among participants who are randomized to the intervention arm, alternative guide-line directed anti-hypertensive medication will be provided to the treating physician team (detail in study protocol). In the intervention arm RAAS inhibitor will be withheld for a total of 7 days with the possibility of the withdrawn medication being initiated at any point after day 7 or on the day of discharge. The recommendation for re-initiating the withdrawn medication will be made to the treating physician. The re-initiation of these therapies are according to standard convention and follow-up as per Canadian guidelines. Additionally, the date of restarting the withdrawn medication or whether the medication was re-prescribed on discharge or not, will be collected. This will be used to conduct a sensitivity analysis. Furthermore, biomarkers such as troponin, c-reactive protein (CRP) and lymphocyte count will be assessed during the same time period. Samples will be collected on randomization, day 4 and day 7. MAIN OUTCOMES: PRIMARY ENDPOINT: In this study the primary end point is a global rank score calculated for all participants, regardless of treatment assignment ( score from 0 to 7). Please refer to table 4 in the full protocol. In the context of the current trial, it is estimated that death is the most meaningful endpoint, and therefore has the highest score ( score of 7). This is followed by admission to ICU, the need for mechanical ventilation etc. The lowest scores ( score of 1) are assigned to biomarker changes (e.g. change in troponin, change in CRP). This strategy has been used successfully in cardiovascular disease trials and therefore is applicable to the current trial. The primary endpoint for the present trial is assessed from baseline to day 7 (or discharge). Participants are ranked across the clinical and biomarker domains. Lower values indicate better health (or stability). Participants who died during the 7th day of the study will be ranked based on all events occurring before their death and also including the fatal event in the score. Next, participants who did not die but were transferred to ICU for invasive ventilation will be ranked based on all the events occurring before the ICU entry and also including the ICU admission in the score. Those participants who did not die were not transferred to ICU for invasive ventilation, will be ranked based on the subsequent outcomes. The mean rank score will then be compared between groups. In this scheme, a lower mean rank score indicates greater overall stability for participants. Secondary endpoints : The key secondary endpoints are the individual components of the primary components and include the following: death, transfer to ICU primarily for invasive ventilation, transfer to ICU for other indication, non-fatal MACE ( any of following, MI, stroke, acute HF, new onset Afib), length of stay > 4 days, development of acute kidney injury ( > 40% decline in eGFR or doubling of serum creatinine), urgent intravenous treatment for high blood pressure, 30% increase in baseline high sensitivity troponin, 30% increase in baseline BNP, increase in CRP to > 30% in 48 hours and lymphocyte count drop> 30%. We will also look at the World Health Organization (WHO) ordinal scale for clinical improvement (in COVID-19) in our data. In this scale death will be assigned the highest score of 8. Patients with no limitation of activity will be assigned a score of 1 which indicates overall more stability (3). Additionally, we will evaluate the potential effects of discontinuing RAAS inhibition on alternative schedules (longer/shorter than 7 days, intermittent discontinuation) using a mechanistic mathematical model of COVID-19 immunopathology calibrated to data collected from our patient cohort. In particular, we will assess the impact of alternative schedules on primary and secondary endpoints including increases to baseline CRP and lymphocyte counts. RANDOMIZATION: Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio. Randomization will be performed within an electronic database system at the time of enrolment using a random number generator, an approach that has been successfully used in other clinical trials. Neither participant, study team, or treating team will be blinded to the intervention arm. BLINDING: This is an open label study with no blinding. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): The approximate number of participants required for this trial is 40 patients (randomized 1:1 to continuation versus discontinuation of RAAS inhibitors). This number was calculated based on previous rates of outcomes for COVID-19 in the literature (e.g. death, ICU transfer) and statistical power calculations.

Discovery and quantitation of various OA-specific biomarkers is still largely focused on the bodily fluids which does not appear to be reliable and sensitive enough. However, with the advancement of spatial proteomic techniques, several novel peptides and proteins, as well as N-glycans, can be identified and localised in a reliable and sensitive manner. To summarise the important findings from OA biomarker studies, papers published between 2000 and 2020 were searched via Google Scholar and PubMed.

Although COVID-19 is diagnosed with a nasopharyngeal swab, detection of pulmonary involvement is crucial for safe patient discharge. Computed tomography (CT) is currently the gold standard. To treat paucisymptomatic patients, we have implemented a ""fast track"" pathway in our emergency department, using LUS as a valid alternative. Minimal data is available in the literature about interobserver reliability and the level of expertise needed to perform a reliable examination. Our aim was to assess these. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a single-center prospective study. We enrolled 96 patients. 12 lung areas were explored in each patient with a semiquantitative assessment of pulmonary aeration loss in order to obtain the LUS score. Scans were performed by two different operators, an expert and a novice, who were blinded to their colleague's results. RESULTS: 96 patients were enrolled. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) showed excellent agreement between the expert and the novice operator (ICC 0.975; 0.962-0.983); demographic features (age, sex, and chronic pulmonary disease) did not influence the reproducibility of the method. The ICC was 0.973 (0.950-0.986) in males, 0.976 (0.959-0.986) in females; 0.965 (0.940-0.980) in younger patients (&#8804;â46 yrs), and 0.973 (0.952-0.985) in older (>â46 yrs) patients. The ICC was 0.967 (0.882-0.991) in patients with pulmonary disease and 0.975 (0.962-0.984) in the other patients. The learning curve showed an increase in interobserver agreement. CONCLUSION: Our results confirm the feasibility and reproducibility of the method among operators with different levels of expertise, with a rapid learning curve.","De Molo, Chiara; Consolini, Silvia; Salvatore, Veronica; Grignaschi, Alice; Lanotte, Antonella; Masi, Livia; Giostra, Fabrizio; Serra, Carla",Ultraschall med,384,30

243156,243156,243156,Correction to: Lung ultrasound predicts clinical course and outcomes in COVID-19 patients,19.337185,9.768949,2020,"BACKGROUND: There is increasing evidence that the individual physician is the main factor influencing variability in end-of-life decision-making in intensive care units. End-of-life decisions are complex and should be adapted to each patient. Physician-related variability is problematic as it may result in unequal assessments that affect patient outcomes. The primary aim of this study was to investigate factors contributing to physician-related variability in end-of-life decision-making. METHOD: This is a qualitative substudy of a previously conducted study. In-depth thematic analysis of semistructured interviews with 19 critical care specialists from five different Swedish intensive care units was performed. Interviews took place between 1 February 2017 and 31 May 2017. RESULTS: Factors influencing physician-related variability consisted of different assessment of patient preferences, as well as intensivists' personality and values. Personality was expressed mainly through pace and determination in the decision-making process. Personal prejudices appeared in decisions, but few respondents had personally witnessed this. Avoidance of criticism and conflicts as well as individual strategies for emotional coping were other factors that influenced physician-related variability. Many respondents feared criticism for making their assessments, and the challenging nature of end-of-life decision-making lead to avoidance as well as emotional stress. CONCLUSION: Variability in end-of-life decision-making is an important topic that needs further investigation. It is imperative that such variability be acknowledged and addressed in a more formal and transparent manner. The ethical issues faced by intensivists have recently been compounded by the devastating impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, demonstrating in profound terms the importance of the topic.","Nordenskjöld Syrous, Alma; Malmgren, Johan; Odenstedt Hergès, Helena; Olausson, Sepideh; Kock-Redfors, Maria; Ågård, Anders; Block, Linda",Acta anaesthesiol. scand,384,22

The analysis by RT-qPCR usually requires a previous extraction step to obtain the purified viral RNA. Unfortunately, RNA extraction constitutes a bottleneck for early detection in many countries since it is expensive, time-consuming and depends on the availability of commercial kits. Here, we describe an extraction-free protocol for SARS-CoV-2 detection by RT-qPCR from nasopharyngeal swab clinical samples in saline solution. The method includes a treatment with proteinase K followed by heat inactivation (PK+HID method). We demonstrate that PK+HID improves the RT-qPCR performance in comparison to the heat-inactivation procedure. Moreover, we show that this extraction-free protocol can be combined with a variety of multiplexing RT-qPCR kits. The method combined with a multiplexing detection kit targeting N and ORF1ab viral genes showed a sensitivity of 0.99 and a specificity of 0.99 from the analysis of 106 positive and 106 negative clinical samples. In conclusion, PK+HID is a robust, fast and inexpensive procedure for extraction-free RT-qPCR determinations of SARS-CoV-2.

Women with chronic hypertension are easily-recognized and in touch with a wide variety of healthcare providers before, during, and after pregnancy, mandating that chronic hypertension in pregnancy be within the scope of many practitioners. We reviewed recent data on management to inform current care and future research. STUDY DESIGN: Narrative review of published literature. RESULTS: Compared with normotensive women, women with chronic hypertension are at increased risk of maternal and perinatal complications. Women wish to be involved in their care and are capable of measuring blood pressure (BP) at home. Accurate devices for home BP monitoring are now available. The diagnostic criteria for superimposed preeclampsia remain problematic, as most guidelines continue to include deteriorating BP control in the definition. It has not been established how angiogenic markers may aid in confirmation of the diagnosis of superimposed preeclampsia when suspected, over and above information provided by routinely-available clinical data and laboratory results. While chronic hypertension is a strong risk factor for preeclampsia and aspirin decreases preeclampsia risk, the effectiveness specifically among women with chronic hypertension has been questioned. It is unclear whether calcium has an independent effect in preeclampsia prevention in such women. Treating hypertension with antihypertensive therapy halves the risk of progression to severe hypertension, thrombocytopenia, and elevated liver enzymes, but a reduction in preeclampsia or serious maternal complications has not been demonstrated; however, the latter lack of evidence is possibly due to few events. Also, treating chronic hypertension neither reduces nor increases fetal/newborn death or morbidity, regardless of the gestational age at which the antihypertensive treatment is started. Antihypertensive agents are not teratogenic, but there may be an increase in malformations associated with chronic hypertension itself. At present, BP treatment targets used in clinic are the same as those used at home; although BP values tend to be inconsistently lower at home among hypertensive women. While starting all women on the same antihypertensive medication is usually effective in reducing BP, it remains unclear whether there is an optimal agent for such an approach, or how best to use combinations of antihypertensive medications. An alternative approach is to individualize care, using maternal characteristics and BP features beyond BP level (e.g., variability) that are of prognostic value. Outcomes may be improved by timed birth between 38+0-39+6 weeks based on observational literature; confirmatory trial evidence is pending. Postnatal care is facilitated by the acceptability of most antihypertensives (included angiotensin converting enzymes inhibitors) for use in breastfeeding. CONCLUSIONS: The evidence base to guide the care of pregnant women with chronic hypertension is growing and aligning international guidance. Addressing outstanding research questions would inform personalized care of chronic hypertension in pregnancy.","Magee, Laura A; Khalil, Asma; Kametas, Nikos; VON Dadelszen, Peter",Am. j. obstet. gynecol,384,24

The objective of this article is to estimate the influence of the hospital care system on lethality in metropolitan France during the inception of the COVID-19 epidemic, by analyzing the spatial variability of the hospital case-fatality rate (CFR) between French districts. In theory, the hospital age-standardized CFR should not display significant differences between districts, since hospital lethality depends on the virulence of the pathogen (the SARS-CoV-2 virus), the vulnerability of the population (mainly age-related), the healthcare system quality, and cases and deaths definition and the recording accuracy. We analyzed hospital data on COVID-19 hospitalizations, severity (admission to intensive care units for reanimation or endotracheal intubation) and mortality, from March 19 to May 8 corresponding to the first French lockdown. All rates were age-standardized to eliminate differences in districts age structure. The results show that the higher case-fatality rates observed by districts are mostly related to the level of morbidity. Time analysis shows that the case-fatality rate has decreased over time, globally and in almost all districts, showing an improvement in the management of severe patients during the epidemic. In conclusion, it appears that during the first critical phase of COVID-19 ramping epidemic in metropolitan France, the higher case-fatality rates were generally related to the higher level of hospitalization, then potentially related to the overload of healthcare system. Also, low hospitalization with high case-fatality rates were mostly found in districts with low population density, and could due to some limitation of the local healthcare access. However, the magnitude of this increase of case-fatality rate represents less than 10 per cent of the average case-fatality rate, and this variation is small compared to much greater variation across countries reported in the literature.","Souris, Marc; Gonzalez, Jean-Paul",PLoS One,384,16

Different research perspectives on health are needed in order to manage and monitor this crisis. Performance intelligence is an approach that emphasises the need for different research perspectives in supporting health systems' decision-makers to determine policies based on well-informed choices. In this paper, we present the viewpoint of the Innovative Training Network for Healthcare Performance Intelligence Professionals (HealthPros) on how performance intelligence can be used during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. DISCUSSION: A lack of standardised information, paired with limited discussion and alignment between countries contribute to uncertainty in decision-making in all countries. Consequently, a plethora of different non-data-driven and uncoordinated approaches to address the outbreak are noted worldwide. Comparative health system research is needed to help countries shape their response models in social care, public health, primary care, hospital care and long-term care through the different phases of the pandemic. There is a need in each phase to compare context-specific bundles of measures where the impact on health outcomes can be modelled using targeted data and advanced statistical methods. Performance intelligence can be pursued to compare data, construct indicators and identify optimal strategies. Embracing a system perspective will allow countries to take coordinated strategic decisions while mitigating the risk of system collapse.A framework for the development and implementation of performance intelligence has been outlined by the HealthPros Network and is of pertinence. Health systems need better and more timely data to govern through a pandemic-induced transition period where tensions between care needs, demand and capacity are exceptionally high worldwide. Health systems are challenged to ensure essential levels of healthcare towards all patients, including those who need routine assistance. CONCLUSION: Performance intelligence plays an essential role as part of a broader public health strategy in guiding the decisions of health system actors on the implementation of contextualised measures to tackle COVID-19 or any future epidemic as well as their effect on the health system at large. This should be based on commonly agreed-upon standardised data and fit-for-purpose indicators, making optimal use of existing health information infrastructures. The HealthPros Network can make a meaningful contribution.","Kringos, D; Carinci, F; Barbazza, E; Bos, V; Gilmore, K; Groene, O; Gulácsi, L; Ivankovic, D; Jansen, T; Johnsen, S P; de Lusignan, S; Mainz, J; Nuti, S; Klazinga, N",Health Res Policy Syst,384,1

Respiratory illness is the major cause of morbidity and mortality in these patients with the disease spectrum ranging from asymptomatic subclinical infection, to severe pneumonia progressing to acute respiratory distress syndrome. There is growing evidence describing pathophysiological resemblance of SARS-CoV-2 infection with other coronavirus infections such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2 receptors play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of the virus. Disruption of this receptor leads to cardiomyopathy, cardiac dysfunction, and heart failure. Patients with cardiovascular disease are more likely to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 and they are more likely to develop severe symptoms. Hypertension, arrhythmia, cardiomyopathy and coronary heart disease are amongst major cardiovascular disease comorbidities seen in severe cases of COVID-19. There is growing literature exploring cardiac involvement in SARS-CoV-2. Myocardial injury is one of the important pathogenic features of COVID-19. As a surrogate for myocardial injury, multiple studies have shown increased cardiac biomarkers mainly cardiac troponins I and T in the infected patients especially those with severe disease. Myocarditis is depicted as another cause of morbidity amongst COVID-19 patients. The exact mechanisms of how SARS-CoV-2 can cause myocardial injury are not clearly understood. The proposed mechanisms of myocardial injury are direct damage to the cardiomyocytes, systemic inflammation, myocardial interstitial fibrosis, interferon mediated immune response, exaggerated cytokine response by Type 1 and 2 helper T cells, in addition to coronary plaque destabilization, and hypoxia.","Babapoor-Farrokhran, Savalan; Gill, Deanna; Walker, Jackson; Rasekhi, Roozbeh Tarighati; Bozorgnia, Behnam; Amanullah, Aman",Life Sci,384,28

However, limited genomic sampling in many high-incidence countries has impeded detailed studies of SARS-CoV-2 genomic epidemiology. Consequently, critical questions remain about the generation and global distribution of virus genetic diversity. To address this gap, we investigated SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics in Gujarat, India, during its first epidemic wave and shed light on virus spread in one of the pandemics hardest-hit regions. By integrating regional case data and 434 whole virus genome sequences sampled across 20 districts from March to July 2020, we reconstructed the epidemic dynamics and spatial spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Gujarat, India. Our findings revealed that global and regional connectivity, along with population density, were significant drivers of the Gujarat SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. The three most populous districts in Gujarat accounted [~]84% of total cases during the first wave. Moreover, we detected over 100 virus lineage introductions, which were primarily associated with international travel. Within Gujarat, virus dissemination occurred predominantly from densely populated regions to geographically proximate locations with low-population density. Our findings suggest SARS-CoV-2 transmission follows a gravity model in India, with urban centres contributing disproportionately to onward virus spread.","Raghwani, Jayna; Plessis, Louis du; McCrone, John T; Hill, Sarah C; Parag, Kris V; Theze, Julien; Kumar, Dinesh; Puvar, Apurva; Pandit, Ramesh; Pybus, Oliver; Fournie, Guillaume; Joshi, Madhvi; Joshi, Chaitanya",,384,1

The data are presented for common virus variants and the most frequent HLA class I and class II alleles. Binding affinities of HLA molecules and viral peptides were assessed with accurate in silico methods. The obtained results highlight the importance of taking HLA alleles diversity into account: mutation-mediated alterations in HLA-peptide interactions were highly dependent on HLA alleles. For example, we found that the essential number of peptides tightly bound to HLA-B*07:02 in the reference Wuhan variant ceased to be tight binders for the Indian (Delta) and the UK (Alpha) variants. In summary, we believe that T-CoV will help researchers and clinicians to predict the susceptibility of individuals with different HLA genotypes to infection with variants of SARS-CoV-2 and/or forecast its severity.","Nersisyan, Stepan; Zhiyanov, Anton; Shkurnikov, Maxim; Tonevitsky, Alexander",,384,24

SNA allows us to identify the top toxic users in the network, which led to the creation of experiments simulating the impact of removal of these users on toxicity in the network. Through this work, we demonstrate not only how to identify toxic content related to COVID-19 on YouTube and the actors who propagated this toxicity, but also how social media companies and policy makers can use this work.

Therefore, the investigation of endogenous pathways leading to resolution of inflammation is of interest to uncover strategies for mitigating inflammation in people with SARS-CoV-2 infection. This becomes particularly urgent in individuals with preexisting pathologies characterized by chronic respiratory inflammation and prone to bacterial infection, such as cystic fibrosis (CF). Here, we analyzed the immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 virion spike 1 glycoprotein (S1) of macrophages (M&#934;) from volunteers with and without CF and tested the efficacy of resolvins (Rv) D1 and D2 in regulating the inflammatory and antimicrobial functions of M&#934; exposed to S1. S1 significantly increased chemokine release, including interleukin (IL)-8, in CF and non-CF M&#934;, while it enhanced IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-&#945; in non-CF M&#934;, but not in CF cells. S1 also triggered the biosynthesis of RvD1 and modulated microRNAs miR-16, miR-29a, and miR-103, known to control the inflammatory responses. RvD1 and RvD2 treatment abated S1-induced inflammatory responses in CF and non-CF M&#934;, significantly reducing the release of select chemokines and cytokines including IL-8 and TNF-&#945;. RvD1 and RvD2 both restored the expression of miR-16 and miR-29a, while selectively increasing miR-223 and miR-125a, which are involved in NF-&#954;B activation and M&#934; inflammatory polarization. During Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection, S1 stimulated the M&#934; phagocytic activity that was further enhanced by RvD1 and RvD2. These results provide a map of molecular responses to SARS-CoV-2 in M&#934;, key determinants of COVID-19-related inflammation, unveiling some peculiarity in the response of cells from individuals with CF.

Smoking has been shown to enhance the expression of the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) key entry genes utilized by SARS-CoV-2 to infect cells and induce a 'cytokine storm', which further increases the severity of COVID-19 clinical course.

Thus, further research is necessary to unravel the association between smoking and COVID-19 and to pursue the development of potential novel therapies that are able to constrain the morbidity and mortality provoked by this infectious disease. Herein we present a brief overview of the current knowledge on the correlation between smoking and the expression of SARS-CoV-2 key entry genes, clinical manifestations, and disease progression.","Gupta, Ishita; Sohail, Muhammad Umar; Elzawawi, Khaled E; Amarah, Ahmed H; Vranic, Semir; Al-Asmakh, Maha; Moustafa, Ala-Eddin Al",,384,24

SARS-CoV-2 produces a small hydrophobic envelope (E) protein which shares high homology with SARS-CoV E protein. By patch-clamp recording, the E protein is demonstrated to be a cation-selective ion channel. Furthermore, the SARS-CoV-2 E protein can be blocked by a SARS-CoV E protein inhibitor hexamethylene amiloride. Using structural model and virtual screening, another E protein inhibitor AZD5153 is discovered. AZD5153 is a bromodomain protein 4 inhibitor against hematologic malignancies in clinical trial. The E protein amino acids Phe23 and Val29 are key determinants for AZD5153 sensitivity. This study provides two promising lead compounds and a functional assay of SARS-CoV-2 E protein for the future drug candidate discovery.","Xia, Xin; Zhang, Yuwei; Li, Songling; Lin, Hengwei; Yan, Zhiqiang",,384,16

Creating treatments and vaccines to battle COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, is of paramount importance in order to stop its spread and save lives. The viral main protease, 3CL Mpro, is indispensable for the replication of SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore an important target for the design of specific protease inhibitors. Detailed knowledge of the structure and function of 3CL Mpro is crucial to guide structure-aided and computational drug-design efforts. Here, the oxidation and reactivity of the cysteine residues of the protease are reported using room-temperature X-ray crystallography, revealing that the catalytic Cys145 can be trapped in the peroxysulfenic acid oxidation state at physiological pH, while the other surface cysteines remain reduced. Only Cys145 and Cys156 react with the alkylating agent N-ethylmaleimide. It is suggested that the zwitterionic Cys145-His45 catalytic dyad is the reactive species that initiates catalysis, rather than Cys145-to-His41 proton transfer via the general acid-base mechanism upon substrate binding. The structures also provide insight into the design of improved 3CL Mpro inhibitors.","Kneller, Daniel W; Phillips, Gwyndalyn; O039,; Neill, Hugh M; Tan, Kemin; Joachimiak, Andrzej; Coates, Leighton; Kovalevsky, Andrey",,384,16

Inference with the aim to identify increased mortality at provincial level was a very important task when the Istat data were released in April, but the naïve aggregation of the selected municipalities was not sensible to due to the selection criteria of the municipalities used by Istat. DESIGN: use of a permutation-based approach to identify the Italian provinces with excess mortality during the first month of the COVID-19 epidemics using the data made available from Istat and taking into account the biased inclusion criteria. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: the number of deaths from any cause from 1 January was available for each year of the 2015-2020 period. Data were stratified by municipality, sex and 21 age categories. The third data release (R3) included 1,686 of the 7,904 Italian municipalities with increased mortality in 2020, covering about 40% of the Italian population. Results were compared with those obtainable with the fifth data release (R5), made available in June, when the selection of the municipalities was no longer based on increased mortality and which included more than 90% of the Italian population. R5 was considered the gold standard. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: excess of deaths from any cause in the Italian provinces between 1 March and 4 April; relative risk (RR); permutation p-values; permutation-based adjusted relative risk; population coverage. RESULTS: the results of this study, which are based on two different test statistics, identify 17 and 33 provinces (out of 103) with increased overall mortality, respectively, controlling the family-wise error rate at 0.05 level. Most of the identified provinces are neighbouring provinces in the northern regions of Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna, Piedmont, Liguria, Marche and Tuscany, where most of the COVID-19 cases and deaths were identified. The comparison with data from R5 shows that all the identified provinces had an increase in overall mortality, mostly (31/34) above 25%. On average, the adjusted RR slightly underestimates the RR from R5, underestimating the large RR and overestimating the small RR. CONCLUSIONS: this was, to the best of the authors' knowledge, the first attempt to aggregate the Istat data at province level and obtain a reliable and generalizable statistical inference. This permutation-based approach provides a feasible approach to take into account the selection bias that was present in the data and could be used for analysing other types of data that present some type of selection bias.","Lusa, Lara",Epidemiol Prev,384,25

By collecting data about the effects of all coupons, it shows how city-level and district-level consumer coupons stimulate consumption in the local consumption environment. A large total amount of coupons attracted consumers and the well-designed coupon packages satisfied consumers' needs. Therefore, the potential of consumption in Foshan has been released and it helped stores increase their turnovers to get through the economic recession.

Although COVID-19 is an acutely treated disease, it can also be fatal with a risk of fatality of 4.03% in China and the highest of 13.04% in Algeria and 12.67% Italy (as of 8th April 2020). The onset of serious illness may result in death as a consequence of substantial alveolar damage and progressive respiratory failure. Although laboratory testing, e.g., using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), is the golden standard for clinical diagnosis, the tests may produce false negatives. Moreover, under the pandemic situation, shortage of RT-PCR testing resources may also delay the following clinical decision and treatment. Under such circumstances, chest CT imaging has become a valuable tool for both diagnosis and prognosis of COVID-19 patients. In this study, we propose a weakly supervised deep learning strategy for detecting and classifying COVID-19 infection from CT images. The proposed method can minimise the requirements of manual labelling of CT images but still be able to obtain accurate infection detection and distinguish COVID-19 from non-COVID-19 cases. Based on the promising results obtained qualitatively and quantitatively, we can envisage a wide deployment of our developed technique in large-scale clinical studies.","Hu, Shaoping; Gao, Yuan; Niu, Zhangming; Jiang, Yinghui; Li, Lao; Xiao, Xianglu; Wang, Minhao; Fang, Evandro Fei; Menpes-Smith, Wade; Xia, Jun; Ye, Hui; Yang, Guang",,384,1

Biobanks will play a role in providing tools to examine data from those receiving treatment along with reviewing the current and long treatment outcomes associated with this novel coronavirus disease. A diverse, global network made up of laboratory scientists, clinical researchers, epidemiologists, data science teams, physicians, and so on must have a standardized, collaborative, virtual biobanking solution to share clinical expertise and evidence-based solutions. This virtual biobank must be centrally managed to ensure standardized quality assurance and quality control efforts. Virtual biobanks will eliminate the need to transport samples between two locations for a specific study, minimizing the risk of contamination. It is necessary for virtual biobanks to upload imaging data from those patients diagnosed with COVID-19.

Cichlid fishes are well known for spectacular evolutionary radiations, as they have repeatedly evolved into large and phenotypically diverse arrays of species. Cichlid genomes carry signatures of past events and, at the same time, are the substrate for ongoing evolution. We survey genome-wide data and the available literature covering 438 cichlid populations (412 species) across multiple radiations to synthesize information about patterns and sharing of genetic variation. Nucleotide diversity within species is low in cichlids, with 92% of surveyed populations having less diversity than the median value found in other vertebrates. Divergence within radiations is also low, and a large proportion of variation is shared among species due to incomplete lineage sorting and widespread hybridization. Population genetics therefore provides a suitable conceptual framework for evolutionary genomic studies of cichlid radiations. We focus in detail on the roles of hybridization in shaping the patterns of genetic variation and in promoting cichlid diversification.

Transplant activities at our center continue, and notably, no patient has been infected with SARS-CoV-2. Indeed, social distancing, masking, and education for patients and donors are major pillars of prevention. We recommend potential transplant recipients and donors to be tested for SARS-CoV-2 with qRT-PCR, serum antibody detection, and a lung CT scan pretransplant. If possible, stem cells from HLA-matched unrelated donors by local processing laboratories should be cryopreserved and shipped before initiating pretransplant conditioning. An alternative HLA-haplotype-matched related donor should be identified and evaluated as a backup. The interval immediately after discharge is the time of greatest risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection because of travel and exposure to infected persons. We recommend self-isolation and minimal contact with family members. Nonessential clinic visits should be deferred or substituted with telemedicine consultations if possible. These recommendations are based on our experience at a major transplant center in China. Although some recommendations are evidence based, other recommendations are not and warrant validation in controlled trials.","Xiao, Haowen; Luo, Yi; Shi, Jimin; Jin, Aiyun; Mohty, Mohamad; Nagler, Arnon; Gale, Robert Peter; Huang, He",Acta Haematol,384,2

OBJECTIVE: A quasi-experimental, mixed methods approach was used to examine the rates of visit completion as well as the opinions and experiences of participants enrolled in an ongoing clinical trial of smoking cessation who were required to change from in-person clinic visits to remote visits using video or telephone conferencing due to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: For quantitative comparisons, we used a quasi-experimental design, comparing a cohort of participants followed during the pandemic (n=23, COVID-19 cohort) to a comparable cohort of participants followed over a similar time period in the calendar years 2018 and 2019 (n=51, pre-COVID-19 cohort) to examine the rates of completion of scheduled visits and biospecimen collection. For the qualitative component, interviews were conducted with participants who experienced the transition from in-person to remote visits. RESULTS: Participants in the COVID-19 cohort completed an average of 83.6% of remote clinic visits (95% CI 73.1%-91.2%), which was not significantly different than the in-person completion rate of 89.8% in the pre-COVID-19 cohort. Participants in the COVID-19 cohort returned an average of 93.2% (95% CI 83.5%-98.1%) of saliva specimens for remote clinic visits completed, which was not significantly different than the in-person saliva specimen completion rate of 100% in the pre-COVID-19 cohort. Two broad themes emerged from the qualitative data: (1) the benefits of remote visits and (2) the challenges of remote counseling compared to in-person counseling. Despite limited experience with telehealth prior to this transition, most participants expressed a willingness to engage in remote visits in the future. CONCLUSIONS: Even in the context of a rapid transition from in-person to remote visits necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic, rates of visit completion and return of biospecimens remained high. Participants were generally accepting of the transition. Further research is needed to identify the optimal mix of in-person and remote visits beyond the pandemic context and to better understand how these changes may impact study outcomes.

A systematic review and meta-analysis,19.351171,9.750216,2021,"Electronic documents often contain personal or confidential information, which can be used as valuable evidence in criminal investigations. In the digital investigation, special techniques are required for grouping and screening electronic documents, because it is challenging to analyze relationships between numerous documents in storage devices manually. To this end, although techniques such as keyword search, similarity search, topic modeling, metadata analysis, and document clustering are continually being studied, there are still limitations for revealing the relevance of documents. Specifically, metadata used in previous research are not always values present in the documents, and clustering methods with specific keywords may be incomplete because text-based contents (including metadata) can be easily modified or deleted by users. In this work, we propose a novel method to efficiently group Microsoft Office Word 2007+ (MS Word) files by using revision identifier (RSID). Through a thorough understanding of the RSID, examiners can predict organizations to which a specific user belongs, and further, it is likely to discover unexpected interpersonal relationships. An experiment with a public dataset (GovDocs) provides that it is possible to categorize documents more effectively by combining our proposal with previously studied methods. Furthermore, we introduce a new document tracking method to understand the editing history and movement of a file, and then demonstrate its usefulness through an experiment with documents from a real case.","Joun, Jihun; Chung, Hyunji; Park, Jungheum; Lee, Sangjin",,384,29

DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: The present commentary draws on current policies, practices and literature regarding the health, needs and management of older incarcerated adults in Australia to discuss risk, care and early release for this population during the COVID-19 pandemic. FINDINGS: Incarcerated persons experience poorer health and accelerated age-related decline compared to those in the general community. The present situation offers the opportunity to fill knowledge and practice gaps, including policies for staff training, identification of dementia and cognitive decline, assessment of mobility issues, addressing barriers to health-seeking, possibilities of medical or compassionate release, risk assessment and release protocols and post-release needs. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: While Australian prisons have acknowledged the vulnerability of older persons, more focused adaptation of COVID-19-related policies to consider adults as young as 45 years are needed. Appropriate ethical identification and management of cases in this population is needed, as is discussion on issues of decarceration and medical release. Re-conceptualisation of incarcerated adults as ""citizens in need of care"", rather than as ""offenders to be secured"", will be beneficial.

We sought to determine the effectiveness of a pulsed-xenon ultraviolet (PX-UV) disinfection system in reducing the load of SARS-CoV-2 on hard surfaces and N95 respirators. METHODS: Chamber slides and N95 respirator material were directly inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 and were exposed to different durations of PX-UV. RESULTS: For hard surfaces, disinfection for 1, 2, and 5 minutes resulted in 3.53 log10, >4.54 log10, and >4.12 log10 reductions in viral load, respectively. For N95 respirators, disinfection for 5 minutes resulted in >4.79 log10 reduction in viral load. PX-UV significantly reduced SARS-CoV-2 on hard surfaces and N95 respirators. CONCLUSION: With the potential to rapidly disinfectant environmental surfaces and N95 respirators, PX-UV devices are a promising technology to reduce environmental and personal protective equipment bioburden and to enhance both healthcare worker and patient safety by reducing the risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2.","Simmons, Sarah E; Carrion, Ricardo; Alfson, Kendra J; Staples, Hilary M; Jinadatha, Chetan; Jarvis, William R; Sampathkumar, Priya; Chemaly, Roy F; Khawaja, Fareed; Povroznik, Mark; Jackson, Stephanie; Kaye, Keith S; Rodriguez, Robert M; Stibich, Mark A",Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,384,29

Since SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be detected in stool samples, quantifying SARS-CoV-2 genome by RT-qPCR in WWTPs1 has been proposed as an alternative tool to monitor virus circulation among human populations. However, measuring SARS-CoV-2 viral load in WWTPs can be affected by many experimental and environmental factors. To circumvent these limits, we propose here a novel indicator WWI2 that partly reduces and corrects the noise associated with the SARS-CoV-2 genome quantification in wastewater. This method has been successfully applied in the context of Obepine, a French national network that has been quantifying SARS-CoV-2 genome in a representative sample of French WWTPs since March 5th 2020. On August 26th, 2021, 168 WWTPs were monitored twice a week in the metropolitan and overseas territories of France. We detail the process of elaboration of this indicator, show that it is strongly correlated to the incidence rate and that the optimal time lag between these two signals is only a few days, making our indicator an efficient complement or even a credible alternative to the incidence rate. This alternative approach may be especially important to evaluate SARS-CoV-2 dynamics in human populations when the testing rate is low.

Researchers around the globe need to design and develop successful therapeutics as well as vaccines against the novel COVID-19 disease. In the present study, we conducted comprehensive computer-assisted analysis on the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 in order to design a safe and potent multiepitope vaccine. In silico epitope prioritization shortlisted six HLA I epitopes and six B-cell-derived HLA II epitopes. These high-ranked epitopes were all connected to each other via flexible GPGPG linkers, and at the N-terminus side, the sequence of Cholera Toxin ß subunit was attached via an EAAAK linker. Structural modeling of the vaccine was performed, and molecular docking analysis strongly suggested a positive association of a multiepitope vaccine with Toll-like Receptor 3. The structural investigations of the vaccine-TLR3 complex revealed the formation of fifteen interchain hydrogen bonds, thus validating its integrity and stability. Moreover, it was found that this interaction was thermodynamically feasible. In conclusion, our data supports the proposition that a multiepitope vaccine will provide protective immunity against COVID-19. However, further in vivo and in vitro experiments are needed to validate the immunogenicity and safety of the candidate vaccine.","Dar, Hamza Arshad; Waheed, Yasir; Najmi, Muzammil Hasan; Ismail, Saba; Hetta, Helal F; Ali, Amjad; Muhammad, Khalid",J Immunol Res,384,24

DESIGN: This mixed-methods study applied direct observation and interviews, epidemiologic investigation, source and contact data analysis and whole-genome sequencing. RESULTS: We detected 46 SARS-CoV-2 cases and 4 outbreaks with a proportional representation of labour migrant and native workers in 6 unrelated facilities. Complete viral genome sequences revealed at least 3 clusters of native workers and labour migrants, 2 within and 1 between facilities. On-site inspections found adequate implementation of preventative measures to which both native workers and labour migrants showed suboptimal adherence. Being a labour migrant was associated with living in shared housing, but not with more contacts or different sources. CONCLUSIONS: The fruit and vegetable packaging industry gave the impression of sufficient preparedness and control. Suboptimal adherence to the facilities' preventative guidelines could have facilitated work floor transmission. Community and household transmission are likely to have contributed to outbreaks. We encourage further research into risk factors for transmission in labour migrants and application of these insights into targeted public health policy.","Boogaard, Laura H; Sikkema, Reina S; van Beek, Janko H G M; Brockhoff, Henricus J; Dalebout, Eva; de Heus, Barry; Niemansburg, Sophie L; Nieuwenhuijse, David F; Stougje, Danny; Verspui, Ellen; Oude Munnink, Bas B; Koopmans, Marion P G; Fanoy, Ewout B",Int J Infect Dis,384,16

In children with a suprasellar tumor and hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction, the circadian rhythm may be disturbed causing sleep problems. However, also other factors may influence sleep. Awareness of these different etiologies and careful history taking with appropriate additional diagnostics will aid in restoring sleep quality. METHODS: We present the workup of 4 cases with a suprasellar tumor and disturbances of sleep initiation, sleep maintenance, and daytime sleepiness. In parallel, we developed a flowchart, to aid clinicians in the diagnostics of sleep problems in children after treatment for a (supra) sellar brain tumor. RESULTS: All four patients, known with hypopituitarism, presented with sleep complaints and increased daytime sleepiness. In all four, the cause of sleep problems showed to be different. In the first case, sleep evaluation revealed a severe obstructive sleep apnea, whereupon nocturnal ventilation was started. The second case revealed poor sleep hygiene in combination with an obsessive compulsive disorder. Sleep hygiene was addressed and psychiatric consultation was offered. Dexamphetamine treatment was started to reduce her obsessive compulsive complaints. The third case showed a delayed sleep phase syndrome, which improved by educational support. The fourth case revealed a secondary organic hypersomnia for which modafinil treatment was started. CONCLUSION: Sleep disturbances in children with hypopituitarism due to a (supra) sellar tumor can have different entities which require specific therapy. Awareness of these different entities is important to enable appropriate counseling. Referral to an expertise sleep center may be advised, if standard educational support is insufficient.","van Schaik, J; Pillen, S; van Litsenburg, R R L; Vandenbussche, N L E; de Bont, J M; Schouten-van Meeteren, A Y N; van Santen, H M",Pituitary,384,21

The high prevalence of old age, obesity, diabetes, hypertension, heart failure, and ischaemic heart disease in patients who develop a severe to critical COVID-19 syndrome suggests shared pathophysiological mechanisms. Pre-existing endothelial dysfunction and an impaired innate immune response promote the development by the viral infection of an acute endothelialitis in the pulmonary microcirculation complicated by abnormal vasoconstrictor responses, luminal plugging by inflammatory cells, and intravascular thrombosis. This endothelialitis extends into the systemic circulation what may lead to acute myocardial injury, myocarditis, and thromboembolic complications both in the arterial and venous circulation.","Vrints, Christiaan J M; Krychtiuk, Konstantin A; Van Craenenbroeck, Emeline M; Segers, Vincent F; Price, Susanna; Heidbuchel, Hein",Acta Cardiol,384,20

However, in many cases the properties of interest are subtle variations in higher-order changes, such as acceleration. This is true in the cardiac pulse, where the second derivative can be used as an indicator of blood pressure and arterial disease. Recent developments in camera-based vital sign measurement have shown that cardiac measurements can be recovered with impressive accuracy from videos; however, the majority of research has focused on extracting summary statistics such as heart rate. Less emphasis has been put on the accuracy of waveform morphology that is necessary for many clinically impactful scenarios. In this work, we provide evidence that higher-order dynamics are better estimated by neural models when explicitly optimized for in the loss function. Furthermore, adding second-derivative inputs also improves performance when estimating second-order dynamics. By incorporating the second derivative of both the input frames and the target vital sign signals into the training procedure, our model is better able to estimate left ventricle ejection time (LVET) intervals.","Hill, Brian L.; Liu, Xin; McDuff, Daniel",,384,11

METHODS: We conducted a comparative model-based analysis using three independent NCI Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network cervical models to quantify the impact of eight alternative COVID-19-related screening disruption scenarios compared to a scenario of no disruptions. Scenarios varied by the duration of the disruption (6 or 24 months), steps in the screening process being disrupted (primary screening, surveillance, colposcopy, excisional treatment), and primary screening modality (cytology alone or cytology plus human papillomavirus ""cotesting""). RESULTS: The models consistently showed that COVID-19-related disruptions yield small net increases in cervical cancer cases by 2027, which are greater for women previously screened with cytology compared with cotesting. When disruptions affected all four steps in the screening process under cytology-based screening, there were an additional 5-7 and 38-45 cases per one million screened for 6- and 24-month disruptions, respectively. In contrast, under cotesting, there were additional 4-5 and 35-45 cases per one million screened for 6- and 24-month disruptions, respectively. The majority (58-79%) of the projected increases in cases under cotesting were due to disruptions to surveillance, colposcopies, or excisional treatment, rather than to primary screening. CONCLUSIONS: Women in need of surveillance, colposcopies, or excisional treatment, or whose last primary screen did not involve human papillomavirus testing, may comprise priority groups for reintroductions.","Burger, Emily A; Jansen, Erik El; Killen, James; Kok, Inge McM de; Smith, Megan A; Sy, Stephen; Dunnewind, Niels; G Campos, Nicole; Haas, Jennifer S; Kobrin, Sarah; Kamineni, Aruna; Canfell, Karen; Kim, Jane J",J Med Screen,384,1

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Forty patients with locally advanced ESCC who were treated with NAC followed by radical resection were prospectively enrolled from September 2015 to May 2018. MRI and IVIM were performed within 1 week before and 2-3 weeks after NAC, prior to surgery. Parameters including apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), true diffusion coefficient (D), pseudodiffusion coefficient (D*), and pseudodiffusion fraction (f) before and after NAC were measured. Pathologic response was evaluated according to the AJCC tumor regression grade (TRG) system. The changes in IVIM values before and after therapy in different TRG groups were assessed. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves analysis was used to determine the best cutoff value for predicting the pathologic response to NAC. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients were identified as TRG 2 (responders), and eighteen as TRG 3 (non-responders) in pathologic evaluation. The ADC, D, and f values increased significantly after NAC. The post-NAC D and &#916;D values of responders were significantly higher than those of non-responders. The area under the curve (AUC) was 0.722 for post-NAC D and 0.859 for &#916;D in predicting pathologic response. The cutoff values of post-NAC D and &#916;D were 1.685 × 10-3 mm2/s and 0.350 × 10-3 mm2/s, respectively. CONCLUSION: IVIM-DWI may be used as an effective functional imaging technique to predict pathologic response to NAC in locally advanced ESCC. KEY POINTS: â¢ The optimal cutoff values of post-NAC D and &#916;D for predicting pathologic response to NAC in locally advanced ESCC were 1.685 × 10-3 mm2/s and 0.350 × 10-3 mm2/s, respectively. â¢ Pathologic response to NAC in locally advanced ESCC was favorable in patients with post-NAC D and &#916;D values that were higher than the optimal cutoff values. â¢ IVIM-DWI can potentially be used to preoperatively predict pathologic response to NAC in esophageal carcinoma. Accurate quantification of the D value derived from IVIM-DWI may eventually translate into an effective and non-invasive marker to predict therapeutic efficacy.","Song, Tao; Yao, Qi; Qu, Jinrong; Zhang, Hongkai; Zhao, Yan; Qin, Jianjun; Feng, Wen; Zhang, Shouning; Han, Xianhua; Wang, Shaoyu; Yan, Xu; Li, Hailiang",Eur. radiol,384,24

In this national survey study (n = 2040), we assessed how the UK population; particularly these overlapping groups, reported their preparedness for digital health strategies. We report, with respect to using digital information to make health decisions, that those over 60 are less comfortable (net comfort: 57%) than those between 18 and 39 (net comfort: 78%) and lower social grades are less comfortable (net comfort: 63%) than higher social grades (net comfort: 75%). With respect to a preference for digital over non-digital sources in seeking COVID-19 health information, those over 60 (net preference: 21%) are less inclined than those between 18 and 39 (net preference: 60%) and those of low educational attainment (net preference: 30%) are less inclined than those of high educational attainment (net preference: 52%). Lastly, with respect to distinguishing reliable digital COVID-19 information, lower social grades (net confidence: 55%) are less confident than higher social grades (net confidence: 68%) and those of low educational attainment (net confidence: 51%) are less confident than those of high educational attainment (net confidence: 71%). All reported differences are statistically significant (p < 0.01) following multivariate regression modelling. This study suggests that digital public health approaches to COVID-19 have the potential to marginalise groups who are concurrently at risk of digital exclusion and poor health outcomes from SARS-CoV-2.","Sounderajah, Viknesh; Clarke, Jonathan; Yalamanchili, Seema; Acharya, Amish; Markar, Sheraz R; Ashrafian, Hutan; Darzi, Ara",Sci Rep,384,16

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a multicentric retrospective analysis of ED admissions in three high volume urology departments (one directly involved in COVID-19 patients management and two not involved) in Rome - Italy between March and April 2020 and in the same period of 2019. Statistical analysis was conducted on the number of admissions for urolithiasis, rate of complications, hospitalization and the type of treatment received. RESULTS: 304 patients were included in the analysis. A significant reduction in the global number of patients admitted to ED for urolithiasis between 2019 and 2020 (48.8%) was noted. Moreover, regarding the choice of treatment of hospitalized patients, a statistically significant increase of stone removal procedures versus urinary drainage was reported in 2020 (p = 0.015). CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic in Rome there has been a significant reduction of emergency admissions for urolithiasis. Patients admitted to ED had more complications, more frequently need hospitalization and regarding clinical management early stone removal was preferred over urinary drainage only. All the urologists should be aware that in the next months they could face an increased number of admissions for urolithiasis and manage more complicated cases.","Antonucci, M; Recupero, S M; Marzio, V; De Dominicis, M; Pinto, F; Foschi, N; Di Gianfrancesco, L; Bassi, P; Ragonese, M",Actas Urol Esp,384,33

This paper extends our previous work by examining the predictive utility of the SSBA to identify self-attributed addiction problems. Method: Participants (N = 6,000) were recruited in Canada using quota sampling methods. Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROCs) analyses were conducted, and thresholds established for each target behavior's subscale to predict self-attributed problems with these substances and behaviors. For each substance and behavior, regression models compared overall classification accuracy and model fit when lay epidemiologic indicators assessed using the SSBA were compared with validated screening measures to predict selfattributed problems. Results: ROC analyses indicted moderate to high diagnostic accuracy (Area under the curves (AUCs) 0.73-0.94) across SSBA subscales. Thresholds for identifying self-attributed problems were 3 for six of the subscales (alcohol, tobacco, cannabis, cocaine, shopping, and gaming), and 2 for the remaining four behaviors (gambling, eating, sexual activity, and working). Compared to other instruments assessing addiction problems, models using the SSBA provided equivalent or better model fit, and overall had higher classification accuracy in the prediction of self-attributed problems. Discussion and conclusions: The SSBA is a viable screening tool for problematic engagement across ten potentially addictive behaviors. Where longer screening tools are not appropriate, the SSBA may be used to identify individuals who would benefit from further assessment.","Schluter, Magdalen G; Hodgins, David C; Konkolÿ Thege, Barna; Wild, T Cameron",J Behav Addict,384,14

One of the viral proteases called main protease or Mpro, plays a crucial role in the replication of SARS-CoV-2. As the structure of Mpro of SARS-CoV-2 is similar to the Mpro of SARS-CoV-1 (responsible for SARS outbreak between 2002 and 2004), we hypothesize that the inhibitors of SARS-CoV-1 Mpro can also inhibit the Mpro of SARS-CoV-2. To test this hypothesis, a total of 79 isatin derivatives, which inhibited Mpro activity under in vitro conditions, were selected from the literature, and then screened through AutoDock Vina. The chemical features of the top 5 isatin derivatives with low binding energies (-8.5 to -8.2 kcal/mol) were used to screen similar types of compounds from several small-molecule libraries containing 15856508 compounds. A total of 1,609 compounds with similarity score &#8805; 6 were screened and then subjected to docking as well as ADME analysis. Among the compounds screened, 4 ligands form Zinc drug-like library (ZINC000008848565, ZINC000009513563, ZINC000036759789 and ZINC000046053855) showed good ADMET properties, low binding energy (-8.4 to -8.6 kcal/mol), low interaction energy (-72.62 to -50.01 kcal/mol) and high structural stability with Mpro. Hence, the selected ligands might serve as the lead candidates for further wet laboratory validation, optimization and development.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Neutralizing antibodies are a potential treatment for COVID-19. Objective: To determine the effect of bamlanivimab monotherapy and combination therapy with bamlanivimab and etesevimab on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral load in mild to moderate COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: The BLAZE-1 study is a randomized phase 2/3 trial at 49 US centers including ambulatory patients (N = 613) who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection and had 1 or more mild to moderate symptoms. Patients who received bamlanivimab monotherapy or placebo were enrolled first (June 17-August 21, 2020) followed by patients who received bamlanivimab and etesevimab or placebo (August 22-September 3). These are the final analyses and represent findings through October 6, 2020. Interventions: Patients were randomized to receive a single infusion of bamlanivimab (700 mg [n = 101], 2800 mg [n = 107], or 7000 mg [n = 101]), the combination treatment (2800 mg of bamlanivimab and 2800 mg of etesevimab [n = 112]), or placebo (n = 156). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary end point was change in SARS-CoV-2 log viral load at day 11 (±4 days). Nine prespecified secondary outcome measures were evaluated with comparisons between each treatment group and placebo, and included 3 other measures of viral load, 5 on symptoms, and 1 measure of clinical outcome (the proportion of patients with a COVID-19-related hospitalization, an emergency department [ED] visit, or death at day 29). Results: Among the 577 patients who were randomized and received an infusion (mean age, 44.7 [SD, 15.7] years; 315 [54.6%] women), 533 (92.4%) completed the efficacy evaluation period (day 29). The change in log viral load from baseline at day 11 was -3.72 for 700 mg, -4.08 for 2800 mg, -3.49 for 7000 mg, -4.37 for combination treatment, and -3.80 for placebo. Compared with placebo, the differences in the change in log viral load at day 11 were 0.09 (95% CI, -0.35 to 0.52; P = .69) for 700 mg, -0.27 (95% CI, -0.71 to 0.16; P = .21) for 2800 mg, 0.31 (95% CI, -0.13 to 0.76; P = .16) for 7000 mg, and -0.57 (95% CI, -1.00 to -0.14; P = .01) for combination treatment. Among the secondary outcome measures, differences between each treatment group vs the placebo group were statistically significant for 10 of 84 end points. The proportion of patients with COVID-19-related hospitalizations or ED visits was 5.8% (9 events) for placebo, 1.0% (1 event) for 700 mg, 1.9% (2 events) for 2800 mg, 2.0% (2 events) for 7000 mg, and 0.9% (1 event) for combination treatment. Immediate hypersensitivity reactions were reported in 9 patients (6 bamlanivimab, 2 combination treatment, and 1 placebo). No deaths occurred during the study treatment. Conclusions and Relevance: Among nonhospitalized patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 illness, treatment with bamlanivimab and etesevimab, compared with placebo, was associated with a statistically significant reduction in SARS-CoV-2 viral load at day 11; no significant difference in viral load reduction was observed for bamlanivimab monotherapy. Further ongoing clinical trials will focus on assessing the clinical benefit of antispike neutralizing antibodies in patients with COVID-19 as a primary end point.

Recent studies show that when 3D molecular geometries, such as bond lengths and angles, are available, molecular property prediction tasks can be made more accurate. However, computing of 3D molecular geometries requires quantum calculations that are computationally prohibitive. For example, accurate calculation of 3D geometries of a small molecule requires hours of computing time using density functional theory (DFT). Here, we propose to predict the ground-state 3D geometries from molecular graphs using machine learning methods. To make this feasible, we develop a benchmark, known as Molecule3D, that includes a dataset with precise ground-state geometries of approximately 4 million molecules derived from DFT. We also provide a set of software tools for data processing, splitting, training, and evaluation, etc. Specifically, we propose to assess the error and validity of predicted geometries using four metrics. We implement two baseline methods that either predict the pairwise distance between atoms or atom coordinates in 3D space. Experimental results show that, compared with generating 3D geometries with RDKit, our method can achieve comparable prediction accuracy but with much smaller computational costs.

Our model at the core is a non-local generalization of the widely used Kermack-McKendrick(KM) model where the susceptible(S) population evolves into two other categories, namely infectives(I) and removed(R). This is the well-known SIR model in which we further divide both S and I into high and low risk categories. We first formulate a set of non-local dynamical equations for the time evolution of distinct population distributions under this categorization in an attempt to describe the general scenario of infectious disease progression. We then solve the non-linear coupled differential equations-(i) numerically by the method of propagation, and (ii) a more flexible and versatile cellular automata (CA) simulation which provides a coarse-grained description of the generalized non-local model. In order to account for multiple factors such as role of spreaders before containment, we introduce a time dependent rate which appears to be essential to explain the sudden spikes before the plateau observed in many cases (for example like China). We demonstrate how this generalized approach allows us to handle the effects of (i) time-dependence of the rate-constants of spread, (ii) different population density, (iii) the age ratio, (iv) quarantine, (v) lockdown, and (vi) social distancing. Our study allows us to make certain predictions regarding the nature of spread with respect to several external parameters, treated as control variables. Analysis of the model clearly shows that due to the strong heterogeneity in the epidemic process originating from the distribution of initial infectives, the theory must be local in character but at the same time connect to a global perspective.","Mukherjee, Saumyak; Mondal, Sayantan; Bagchi, Biman",,384,24

The frequent testing of non-symptomatic infectiousness will (i) significantly improve the predictability of the pandemic, (ii) allow informed and optimized decisions on how to modify restrictive measures, with shorter delay times than the present ones, and (iii) enable the real-time assessment of the efficiency of new means to reduce transmission rates. These advantages are quantified by considering a feedback and control model of mitigation where the feed-back is derived from the evolution of the daily measured prevalence. While the basic model we propose aggregates data for the entire population of a country such as Switzerland, we point out generalizations which account for hot spots which are analogous to (Anderson) localized regions in the theory of diffusion in random media.","Müller, Markus; Derlet, Peter M; Mudry, Christopher; Aeppli, Gabriel",Phys. biol,384,1

The molecular mechanisms driving checkpoint blockade resistance, whether pre-existing or evolved, remain unclear. To address this critical knowledge gap, we treated B16 melanoma with the combination of CTLA-4, PD-1, and PD-L1 blockade and a Flt3 ligand vaccine (&#8805;75% curative), isolated tumors resistant to therapy, and serially passaged them in vivo with the same treatment regimen until they developed complete resistance. Using gene expression analysis and immunogenomics, we determined the adaptations associated with this resistance phenotype. Checkpoint resistance coincided with acquisition of a ""hypermetabolic"" phenotype characterized by coordinated upregulation of the glycolytic, oxidoreductase, and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation pathways. These resistant tumors flourished under hypoxic conditions whereas metabolically starved T cells lost glycolytic potential, effector function, and the ability to expand in response to immunotherapy. Further, we found that checkpoint resistant versus sensitive tumors could be separated by non-invasive MRI imaging based solely on their metabolic state. In a cohort of melanoma patients resistant to both CTLA-4 and PD-1 blockade, we observed upregulation of pathways indicative of a similar hypermetabolic state. Together these data indicated that melanoma can evade T cell checkpoint blockade immunotherapy by adapting a hypermetabolic phenotype.","Jaiswal, Ashvin R; Liu, Arthur J; Pudakalakatti, Shivanand; Dutta, Prasanta; Jayaprakash, Priyamvada; Bartkowiak, Todd; Ager, Casey R; Wang, Zhi-Qiang; Reuben, Alexandre; Cooper, Zachary A; Ivan, Cristina; Ju, Zhenlin; Nwajei, Felix; Wang, Jing; Davies, Michael A; Davis, R Eric; Wargo, Jennifer A; Bhattacharya, Pratip K; Hong, David S; Curran, Michael A",Cancer immunology res.

These measures include mandating use of face masks, physical distancing in classrooms, increasing ventilation with outdoor air, identification of close contacts,* and following CDC isolation and quarantine guidance (2). A 2-week pilot investigation was conducted to investigate occurrences of SARS-CoV-2 secondary transmission in K-12 schools in the city of Springfield, Missouri, and in St. Louis County, Missouri, during December 7-18, 2020. Schools in both locations implemented COVID-19 mitigation strategies; however, Springfield implemented a modified quarantine policy permitting student close contacts aged &#8804;18 years who had school-associated contact with a person with COVID-19 and met masking requirements during their exposure to continue in-person learning.§ Participating students, teachers, and staff members with COVID-19 (37) from 22 schools and their school-based close contacts (contacts) (156) were interviewed, and contacts were offered SARS-CoV-2 testing. Among 102 school-based contacts who received testing, two (2%) had positive test results indicating probable school-based SARS-CoV-2 secondary transmission. Both contacts were in Springfield and did not meet criteria to participate in the modified quarantine. In Springfield, 42 student contacts were permitted to continue in-person learning under the modified quarantine; among the 30 who were interviewed, 21 were tested, and none received a positive test result. Despite high community transmission, SARS-CoV-2 transmission in schools implementing COVID-19 mitigation strategies was lower than that in the community.

Nevertheless, this strategy has other undesirable effects such as physical inactivity and psychological distress, which are associated with cognitive impairment. We aimed to examine whether physical activity during social distancing restrictions could reduce the risk of subjective memory decline in adults. Participants (n=2321) completed the baseline assessment of PAMPA cohort (Prospective Study About Mental and Physical Health), a ambispective cohort study conducted in southern Brazil. An online-based, self-administered questionnaire assessed physical activity and self-rated memory in two different periods: before and during social distancing. Data collection was executed from June 22nd to July 23rd 2020. Adjusted Poisson regression models were performed and values reported in prevalence ratio (PR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Participants presented with a mean age of 38.2 (95%CI: 37.5, 38.9) years. Most were women (76.6%), had at least a university degree (66.7%), and were overweight or obese (53.3%).

Several drug candidates have been suggested as potential therapeutic options for COVID-19, including remdesivir, currently the only authorized drug for use under an Emergency Use Authorization. However, there is only limited information regarding the safety profiles of the proposed drugs, in particular drug-induced cardiotoxicity. Here, we evaluated the antiviral activity and cardiotoxicity of remdesivir using cardiomyocytes-derived from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSC-CMs) as an alternative source of human primary cardiomyocytes (CMs). In this study, remdesivir exhibited up to 60-fold higher antiviral activity in hPSC-CMs compared to Vero E6 cells; however, it also induced moderate cardiotoxicity in these cells. To gain further insight into the drug-induced arrhythmogenic risk, we assessed QT interval prolongation and automaticity of remdesivir-treated hPSC-CMs using a multielectrode array (MEA). As a result, the data indicated a potential risk of QT prolongation when remdesivir is used at concentrations higher than the estimated peak plasma concentration. Therefore, we conclude that close monitoring of the electrocardiographic/QT interval should be advised in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients under remdesivir medication, in particular individuals with pre-existing heart conditions.","Choi, Seong Woo; Shin, Jin Soo; Park, Soon-Jung; Jung, Eunhye; Park, Yun-Gwi; Lee, Jiho; Kim, Sung Joon; Park, Hun-Jun; Lee, Jung-Hoon; Park, Sung-Min; Moon, Sung-Hwan; Ban, Kiwon; Go, Yun Young",Antiviral Res,384,16

However, the nature of this structural inequality in relation to COVID-19 is poorly understood. Here, we hypothesized that two structural features, racial residential segregation and income inequality, of metropolitan areas in the United States have contributed to health-compromising conditions, which, in turn, have increased COVID-19 fatalities; moreover, that these two features, when combined, may be particularly lethal. To test this hypothesis, we examined the growth rate of confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths in an early 30-day period of the outbreak in the counties located in each of the 100 largest metropolitan areas in the United States. The growth curves for cases and deaths were steeper in counties located in metropolitan areas where Blacks and Hispanics are residentially segregated from Whites. Moreover, the effect of racial residential segregation was augmented by income inequality within each county. These data strongly suggest that racial and economic disparities have caused a greater death toll during the current pandemic. We draw policy implications for making virus-resilient cities free from such consequences.","Yu, Qinggang; Salvador, Cristina E; Melani, Irene; Berg, Martha K; Neblett, Enrique W; Kitayama, Shinobu",Ann.

Our objective was to investigate, at a small area level, whether long-term exposure to air pollutants increased the risk of COVID-19 incidence and death in Catalonia, Spain, controlling for socioeconomic and demographic factors. METHODS: We used a mixed longitudinal ecological design with the study population consisting of small areas in Catalonia for the period February 25 to May 16, 2020. We estimated Generalized Linear Mixed models in which we controlled for a wide range of observed and unobserved confounders as well as spatial and temporal dependence. RESULTS: We have found that long-term exposure to nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and, to a lesser extent, to coarse particles (PM10) have been independent predictors of the spatial spread of COVID-19. For every 1 µm/m3 above the mean the risk of a positive test case increased by 2.7% (95% credibility interval, ICr: 0.8%, 4.7%) for NO2 and 3.0% (95% ICr: -1.4%,7.44%) for PM10. Regions with levels of NO2 exposure in the third and fourth quartile had 28.8% and 35.7% greater risk of a death, respectively, than regions located in the first two quartiles. CONCLUSION: Although it is possible that there are biological mechanisms that explain, at least partially, the association between long-term exposure to air pollutants and COVID-19, we hypothesize that the spatial spread of COVID-19 in Catalonia is attributed to the different ease with which some people, the hosts of the virus, have infected others. That facility depends on the heterogeneous distribution at a small area level of variables such as population density, poor housing and the mobility of its residents, for which exposure to pollutants has been a surrogate.","Saez, Marc; Tobias, Aurelio; Barceló, Maria A",Environ Res,384,33

Thus creating an urgent need to develop effective counteragents against novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Many antiviral drugs have been repurposed for treatment but implicated minimal recovery, which further advanced the need for clearer insights and innovation to derive effective therapeutics. Strategically, Noscapine, an approved antitussive drug with positive effects on lung linings may show favorable outcomes synergistically with antiviral drugs in trials. Hence, we have theoretically examined the combinatorial drug therapy by culminating the existing experimental results with in silico analyses. We employed the antitussive noscapine in conjugation with antiviral drugs (Chloroquine, Umifenovir, Hydroxychloroquine, Favlplravir and Galidesivir). We found that Noscapine-Hydroxychloroquine (Nos-Hcq) conjugate has strong binding affinity for the main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2, which performs key biological function in virus infection and progression. Nos-Hcq was analyzed through molecular dynamics simulation. The MD simulation for 100 ns affirmed the stable binding of conjugation unprecedentedly through RMSD and radius of gyration plots along with critical reaction coordinate binding free energy profile. Also, dynamical residue cross-correlation map with principal component analysis depicted the stable binding of Nos-Hcq conjugate to Mpro domains with optimal secondary structure statistics of complex dynamics. Also, we reveal the drugs with stable binding to major domains of Mpro can significantly improve the work profile of reaction coordinates, drug accession and inhibitory regulation of Mpro. The designed combinatorial therapy paves way for further prioritized in vitro and in vivo investigations for drug with robust binding against Mpro of SARS-CoV-2.","Kumar, Neeraj; Awasthi, Amardeep; Kumari, Anchala; Sood, Damini; Jain, Pallavi; Singh, Taru; Sharma, Neera; Grover, Abhinav; Chandra, Ramesh",J Biomol Struct Dyn,384,24

The current study aims to compare factors predicting maternal mental health during the COVID-19 lockdown in China, Italy, and the Netherlands. METHODS: The sample consisted of 900 Dutch, 641 Italian, and 922 Chinese mothers (age M = 36.74, s.d. = 5.58) who completed an online questionnaire during the lockdown. Ten-fold cross-validation models were applied to explore the predictive performance of related factors for maternal mental health, and also to test similarities and differences between the countries. RESULTS: COVID-19-related stress and family conflict are risk factors and resilience is a protective factor in association with maternal mental health in each country. Despite these shared factors, unique best models were identified for each of the three countries. In Italy, maternal age and poor physical health were related to more mental health symptoms, while in the Netherlands maternal high education and unemployment were associated with mental health symptoms. In China, having more than one child, being married, and grandparental support for mothers were important protective factors lowering the risk for mental health symptoms. Moreover, high SES (mother's high education, high family income) and poor physical health were found to relate to high levels of mental health symptoms among Chinese mothers. CONCLUSIONS: These findings are important for the identification of at-risk mothers and the development of mental health promotion programs during COVID-19 and future pandemics.","Guo, Jing; De Carli, Pietro; Lodder, Paul; Bakermans-Kranenburg, Marian J; Riem, Madelon M E",Psychol Med,384,1

This study focused on active surveillance of several avian viral pathogens with a special reference to AIV in selected backyard duck populations in Bangladesh. A total of 500 pooled oropharyngeal and cloacal samples from individual ducks of four districts were tested by real time PCRs for the presence of AIV, avian avulavirus-1, anatid herpesvirus-1, avian parvovirus, avian bornavirus and avian coronavirus. The investigation identified 27 (5.4%) ducks positive for AIV and 12 (2.4%) positive for avian coronavirus. In 13 samples, RNA specific for AIV H4N6 was detected. Phylogenetic analysis of the AIV haemagglutinin H4 and neuraminidase N6 genes suggested a clustering of Bangladeshi AIV H4N6 in Eurasian lineage group 2. Other AIV positive samples had very low virus loads (Cq > 36) and were not subtyped. Coronaviral sequences of a fragment of the polymerase gene were related to Eurasian-Australian duck gamma-coronaviruses. Our current active surveillance in free-range domestic backyard ducks in Bangladesh failed to detect highly pathogenic (HP) AIV in contrast to our previous passive monitoring study. Nevertheless, active monitoring of domestic duck populations may be important to highlight presence and transmission dynamics of economically less important AIV that still may serve as reassortment partners for the generation of new HP and zoonotic AIV.

Unravelling the mechanisms of Furin action, binding dynamics, and the genetic variants opens the growing arena of bona fide antibodies and development of potential therapeutics targeting the blockage of Furin cleavage.","Vankadari, Naveen",J Phys Chem Lett,384,16

Methods: We analyzed questionnaire data from the end of May 2020 from 180 hospitals (total of 102,578 beds) with acute medical centers. Results: A total of 4,938 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were confirmed. Of 1,100 severe COVID-19 inpatients, 112 remained hospitalized and 138 died. There were 4,852 patients presumed to be severe COVID-19 patients who were confirmed later to be not infected. Twenty-seven hospitals (15% of 180 hospitals) converted their ICU to a unit for COVID-19 patients only, and 107 (59%) had to manage both severe COVID-19 patients and others in the same ICU. Restriction of ICU admission was occurred in one of the former 27 hospitals and 21 of later 107 hospitals. Shortage of N95 masks was the most serious concern regarding personal protective equipment (PPE). As for issues which raised ICU bed occupancy, difficulty performing or progressing rehabilitation for severe patients (42%), and the improved patients (28%), long lasting severely ill patients (36%) and unclear isolation criteria (34%) were mentioned. Many acute medicine physicians assisted regional governmental agencies functioning as advisors and volunteer coordinator. Conclusion: The mortality rate of COVID-19 in this study was 4.5% of all hospitalized patients and 14% (approximately one in 7) severe patients. The hospitals with dedicated COVID-19 ICUs accepted more patients with severe COVID-19 and had lower ICU admission restrictions, which may be helpful as a strategy in the next pandemic.","Oda, Jun; Takashi, Muguruma; Matsuyama, Shigenari; Tanabe, Seizan; Nishimura, Tetsuro; Sugawara, Yoko; Ogura, Shinji",Acute medicine &amp; surgery,384,16

Syndrome-specific, diagnostic panels have potential to provide information about aetiology quickly. Available panels have been of limited use in lower respiratory tract infections due to slow turn-around-time, lack of quantification of important pathogens and lack of detection of resistance genes.Materials/methods: We evaluated the newly developed Biofire® Filmarray® Pneumonia Panel plus (Biomérieux). Eighty-eight consecutive lower respiratory tract samples were analyzed by both standard microbiological methods, as requested by the referring clinician, and by the panel. The agreement with standard methods, empirical treatment coverage and possible impact on isolation practices were assessed by comparing the results from standard diagnostic methods with the panel results in relation to clinical data and information of antimicrobial therapy.Results: Both qualitative and semi-quantitative results from the panel generally displayed good agreement with standard methods and by combining methods, a possible aetiology was detected in 73% of patients. Due to the panel approach, the panel detected viruses more frequently. In 25% of the 60 patients assessed for empirical treatment coverage, a pathogen not covered by current therapy was detected and in 30% of in-house patients the panel results were found to potentially influence clinical decisions related to isolation care.Conclusions: The new diagnostic panel shows promise in improving aetiological diagnostics of lower respiratory tract infections. Correctly applied it has potential to offer support in clinical decision-making within hours of sampling.","Edin, Alicia; Eilers, Hinnerk; Allard, Annika",Infect Dis (Lond),384,16

In this situation, conversion of in-person routine follow-up visits into phone consultations might be necessary. Here we explored the feasibility of using the validated Crohn's Disease (CD) or Ulcerative Colitis (UC) Patient-Reported Outcomes Signs and Symptoms (CD- and UC-PRO/SS) to collect data about abdominal symptoms (abdominal/S) and bowel signs and symptoms (bowel/SS) remotely. METHODS: CD- and UC-PRO/SS were collected during phone consultations and compared among patients with active and inactive disease. The effectiveness of therapeutic intervention in patients with active disease was assessed by PRO/SS variation. RESULTS: Twenty-one CD and 56 UC patients were evaluated by phone. Six (28.6%) CD and 15 (26.8%) UC patients were considered to have active disease. In CD the bowel/SS but not the abdominal/S module was significantly higher in active patients (mean bowel/SS 2.50 [SE ± 0.44] active vs 0.76 [SE ± 0.18] remission, p = 0.008, AUC 0.87; mean abdominal/S 1.11 [SE ± 0.38] active vs 0.24 [SE ± 0.13] remission, p = 0.066). UC-PRO/SS measures were significantly higher in active patients as compared to patients in remission (median bowel/SS 1.63 [SE ± 0.24] active vs 0.33 [SE ± 0.04] remission; p < 0.0001, AUC 0.91; mean abdominal/S 1.03 [SE ± 0.24] vs 0.37 [SE ± 0.12]; p = 0.009, AUC 0.71). Therapy was escalated in 12 patients (3 CD and 9 UC) due to disease relapse. Therapy escalation resulted in the reduction of PRO/SS as evaluated at the subsequent phone consultation. CONCLUSIONS: PRO/SS might represent a feasible tool to evaluate disease activity and therapy outcome in IBD patients during periods of limited access to outpatient clinics.","Pinto, Sergio; Loddo, Erica; Paba, Salvatore; Favale, Agnese; Chicco, Fabio; Onali, Sara; Usai, Paolo; Fantini, Massimo Claudio",J Patient Rep Outcomes,384,27

Pooled testing with qualitative assays that give binary results has been well-studied. However, characteristics of pooling with quantitative assays were mostly demonstrated using simulations or empirical studies. We investigate properties of three pooling strategies with quantitative assays: traditional two-stage mini-pooling (MP) (Dorfman, 1943), mini-pooling with deconvolution algorithm (MPA) (May et al., 2010), and marker-assisted MPA (mMPA) (Liu et al., 2017). MPA and mMPA test individuals in a sequence after a positive pool and implement a deconvolution algorithm to determine when testing can cease to ascertain all individual statuses. mMPA uses information from other available markers to determine an optimal order for individual testings. We derive and compare the general statistical properties of the three pooling methods. We show that with a proper pool size, MP, MPA, and mMPA can be more cost-efficient than individual testing, and mMPA is superior to MPA and MP. For diagnostic accuracy, mMPA and MPA have higher specificity and positive predictive value but lower sensitivity and negative predictive value than MP and individual testing. Included in this paper are applications to various simulations and an application for HIV treatment monitoring.","Liu, Tao; Hogan, Joseph W; Su, Wanning; Xu, Yizhen; Daniels, Michael J; Rami, Kantor",,384,10

Employing creative strategies to identify systematic biases in statistical outputs, these studies have shown that political manipulation of economic statistics does occur. But they have paid less attention to the question how official statistics are being manipulated. To shed light on the processes behind data manipulation, this article examines three recent high-profile cases in depth: Greece’s public deficit figures, controversies about Argentina’s inflation statistics, and the Brazilian “fiscal pedaling” scandal. We make two main contributions: first, macroeconomic indicators are much more ambiguous than it is commonly realized. Therefore, the line between accurate and manipulated data is more blurry than typical narratives about manipulation acknowledge. Second, in recognition of this ambiguity we introduce a typology distinguishing four types of manipulation: outright manipulation (type 1), politically motivated guesstimating (type 2), the opportunistic use of methodology space (type 3), and indicators-management through indirect means (type 4). The findings from our cases highlight that the politics of statistics do not revolve around “right” and “wrong” numbers.

These environmental disturbances during early life potentially alter the incidence of inflammatory disorders as well as priming of immune responses. Infection with the helminth Schistosoma mansoni is widely studied for its ability to alter immune responsiveness and is associated with variations in coinfection, allergy, and vaccine efficacy in endemic populations. OBJECTIVE: Exposure to maternal schistosomiasis during early life, even without transmission of infection, can result in priming effects on offspring immune responses to bystander antigenic challenges as related to allergic responsiveness and vaccination, with this article seeking to further clarify the effects and underlying immunologic imprinting. METHODS: Here, we have combined a model of chronic maternal schistosomiasis infection with a thorough analysis of subsequent offspring immune responses to allergy and vaccination models, including viral challenge and steady-state changes to immune cell compartments. RESULTS: We have demonstrated that maternal schistosomiasis alters CD4+ responses during allergic sensitization and challenge in a skewed IL-4/B-cell-dominant response to antigenic challenge associated with limited inflammatory response. Beyond that, we have uncovered previously unidentified alterations to CD8+ T-cell responses during immunization that are dependent on vaccine formulation and have functional impact on the efficacy of vaccination against viral infection in a murine hepatitis B virus model. CONCLUSION: In addition to steady-state modifications to CD4+ T-cell polarization and B-cell priming, we have traced these modified CD8+ responses to an altered dendritic cell phenotype sustained into adulthood, providing evidence for complex priming effects imparted by infection via fetomaternal cross talk.","Lacorcia, Matthew; Bhattacharjee, Sonakshi; Laubhahn, Kristina; Alhamdan, Fahd; Ram, Marija; Muschaweckh, Andreas; Potaczek, Daniel P; Kosinska, Anna; Garn, Holger; Protzer, Ulrike; Renz, Harald; Prazeres da Costa, Clarissa",J. allergy clin. immunol,384,21

Our study revealed that the features for viral RNA synthesis and responses to antivirus drugs of the replicon are similar to those of wild-type viruses. Further analysis indicated that ORF6 provided potent in trans stimulation of the viral replication. Some viral variations, such as 5'UTR-C241T and ORF8-(T28144C) L84S mutation, also exhibit their different impact upon viral replication. Besides, the screening of clinically used drugs identified that several tyrosine kinase inhibitors and DNA-Top II inhibitors potently inhibit the replicon, as well as authentic SARS-CoV-2 viruses. Collectively, this replicon system provides a biosafety-worry-free platform for studying SARS-CoV-2 virology, monitoring the functional impact of viral mutations, and developing viral inhibitors.IMPORTANCE COVID-19 has caused a severe global pandemic. Until now, there has been no simple and reliable system available in a lower-biosafety-grade laboratory for SARS-CoV-2 virologic research and inhibitor screening. We reported a replicon system which consists of four ordinary plasmids expressing the required segments of SARS-CoV-2.

Although nucleic acid detection methods such as reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) are the gold standard, during the current pandemic, the deployment of RT-PCR tests has been extremely slow, and key reagents such as PCR primers and RNA extraction kits are at critical shortages. Rapid point-of-care viral antigen detection methods have been previously employed for the diagnosis of respiratory viruses such as influenza and respiratory syncytial viruses. Therefore, the direct detection of SARS-CoV-2 viral antigens in patient samples could also be used for diagnosis of active infection, and alternative methodologies for specific and sensitive viral protein detection should be explored. Targeted mass spectrometry techniques have enabled the identification and quantitation of a defined subset of proteins/peptides at single amino acid resolution with attomole level sensitivity and high reproducibility. Herein, we report a targeted mass spectrometry assay for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and nucleoprotein in a relevant biological matrix. Recombinant full-length spike protein and nucleoprotein were digested and proteotypic peptides were selected for parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) quantitation using a high-resolution Orbitrap instrument. A spectral library, which contained seven proteotypic peptides (four from spike protein and three from nucleoprotein) and the top three to four transitions, was generated and evaluated. From the original spectral library, we selected two best performing peptides for the final PRM assay. The assay was evaluated using mock test samples containing inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virions, added to in vitro derived mucus. The PRM assay provided a limit of detection of â¼200 attomoles and a limit of quantitation of â¼ 390 attomoles. Extrapolating from the test samples, the projected titer of virus particles necessary for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleoprotein detection was approximately 2 × 105 viral particles/mL, making it an attractive alternative to RT-PCR assays. Potentially, mass spectrometry-based methods for viral antigen detection may deliver higher throughput and could serve as a complementary diagnostic tool to RT-PCR. Furthermore, this assay could be used to evaluate the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in archived or recently collected biological fluids, in vitro-derived research materials, and wastewater samples.","Cazares, Lisa H; Chaerkady, Raghothama; Samuel Weng, Shao Huan; Boo, Chelsea C; Cimbro, Raffaello; Hsu, Hsiang-En; Rajan, Sarav; Dall039,; Acqua, William; Clarke, Lori; Ren, Kuishu; McTamney, Patrick; Kallewaard-LeLay, Nicole; Ghaedi, Mahboobe; Ikeda, Yasuhiro; Hess, Sonja",Anal Chem,384,20

Polyclonal neutralizing antibodies offers many advantages such as providing immediate immunity, consequently blunting an early pro-inflammatory pathogenic endogenous antibody response and lack of drug-drug interactions. By providing immediate immunity and inhibiting entry into cells, neutralizing antibody treatment is of interest for patient with COVID-19-induced moderate pneumonia. Convalescent plasma to treat infected patients is therefore a relevant therapeutic option currently under assessment (CORIMUNO-PLASM NCT04324047). However, the difficulties of collecting plasma on the long term are not adapted to a broad use across all populations. New polyclonal humanized anti-SARS-CoV2 antibodies (XAV-19) developed by Xenothera and administered intravenous. XAV-19 is a heterologous swine glyco-humanized polyclonal antibody (GH-pAb) raised against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, blocking infection of ACE-2-positive human cells with SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies have been performed in preclinical models including primates. A first human study with another fully representative GH-pAb from Xenothera is ongoing in recipients of a kidney graft. These studies indicated that 5 consecutive administrations of GH-pAbs can be safely performed in humans. The objectives of this 2-step phase 2 randomized double-blinded, placebo-controlled study are to define the safety and the optimal XAV-19 dose to administrate to patients with SARS-CoV-2 induced moderate pneumonia, and to assess the clinical benefits of a selected dose of XAV-19 in this population. DISCUSSION: This study will determine the clinical benefits of XAV-19 when administered to patients with SARS-CoV-2-induced moderate pneumonia. As a prerequisite, a first step of the study will define the safety and the dose of XAV-19 to be used. Such treatment might become a new therapeutic option to provide an effective treatment for COVID-19 patients (possibly in combination with anti-viral and immunotherapies). Further studies could later evaluate such passive immunotherapy as a potential post-exposure prophylaxis.

Although this global variation is largely affected by socio-medical situations in each country, there is also high individual-level variation attributable to elderliness and certain underlying medical conditions, including high blood pressure, diabetes, and obesity. As both elderliness and the aforementioned chronic conditions are often associated with an altered gut microbiota, resulting in disrupted gut barrier integrity, and gut symptoms have consistently been associated with more severe illness in COVID-19 patients, it is possible that dysfunction of the gut as a whole influences COVID-19 severity. This article summarizes the accumulating evidence that supports the hypothesis that an altered gut microbiota and its associated leaky gut may contribute to the onset of gastrointestinal symptoms and occasionally to additional multiorgan complications that may lead to severe illness by allowing leakage of the causative coronavirus into the circulatory system.","Kim, Heenam Stanley",mBio (Online),384,15

The aim of this study was to outline the main issues that led tobacco smoking being discussed as a potential risk factor associated with COVID-19. METHODS: articles from MEDLINE and pre-prints published from January to April 2020 were identified. RESULTS: data from China showed that men had more severe outcomes of COVID-19 than women. Since smoking prevalence is very high among Chinese men in comparison to women, it was hypothesized that smoking could be a risk factor for poor prognosis. This was also supported by the higher prevalence of comorbidities, many of which are tobacco-related diseases, in patients with severe COVID-19, who were also more likely to have a smoking history. A meta-analysis confirmed these results reporting an OR=2.25 (95% CI: 1.49-3.39) for developing severe Covid-19 among patients with a smoking history. Some authors, noticing that reported smoking prevalence among hospitalized patients was substantially below smoking prevalence in the corresponding populations, speculated a protective role of nicotine. However, it is likely that low prevalence among hospitalized patients are partially due to many smokers misclassified as nonsmokers. Tobacco smoking seems to cause a dose-dependent upregulation of the angiotensin-converting- enzyme-2 (ACE2), the virus cellular entry receptor, which could explain the higher risk of severe COVID-19 in smokers. CONCLUSIONS: There is need for further independent studies to clarify the role of smoking on COVID-19 incidence, progression and mortality.","Cattaruzza, Maria Sofia; Zagà, Vincenzo; Gallus, Silvano; D039,; Argenio, Paolo; Gorini, Giuseppe",Acta Biomed,384,16

The 2002-2003 SARS epidemic caused by SARS-CoV and 2012 MERS epidemic (64 countries affected) caused by MERS-CoV showed their acute and fatal side. These two CoV infections killed thousands of patients infected worldwide. However, WHO has still reported the MERS case in December 2019 in middle-eastern country (Saudi Arabia), indicating the MERS epidemic has not ended completely yet.

Its outbreak pattern depends on a multitude of drivers, including human mobility. Here we evaluate the impact of COVID-19 related mobility restriction (lockdown) on the risk of dengue in Sri Lanka. METHODOLOGY: Two-stage hierarchical models were fitted using an interrupted time-series design based on the notified dengue cases, January 2015 to July 2020. In the first stage model, the district level impact was estimated using quasi-Poisson regression models while accounting for temporal trends. Estimates were pooled at zonal and national levels in the second stage model using meta-analysis. The influence of the extended period of school closure on dengue in children in the western province was compared to adults. FINDINGS: Statistically significant and homogeneous reduction of dengue risk was observed at all levels during the lockdown. Overall an 88% reduction in risk (RR 0.12; 95% CI from 0.08 to 0.17) was observed at the national level. The highest impact was observed among children aged less than 19 years showing a 92% reduction (RR 0.8; 95% CI from 0.03 to 0.25). We observed higher impact in the dry zone having 91% reduction (RR 0.09; 95% CI from 0.05 to 0.15) compared to wet zone showing 83% reduction (RR 0.17; 95% CI from 0.09 to 0.30). There was no indication that the overall health-seeking behaviour for dengue had a substantial influence on these estimates. SIGNIFICANCE: This study offers a broad understanding of the change in risk of dengue during the COVID-19 pandemic and associated mobility restrictions in Sri Lanka. The analysis using the mobility restrictions as a natural experiment suggests mobility patterns to be a very important driver of dengue transmission.","Liyanage, Prasad; Rocklöv, Joacim; Tissera, Hasitha Aravinda",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,384,16

We seek the potential causes for the poor air quality in NCP combining satellite data, ground measurements and model analyses. Efforts to constrain COVID-19 result in a drop-off of primary gaseous pollutants, e.g., -42.4% for surface nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and -38.9% for tropospheric NO2 column, but fine particulate matter (PM25) still remains high and ozone (O3) even increases sharply (+84.1%). Stagnant weather during COVID-19 outbreak, e.g., persistent low wind speed, frequent temperature inversion and wind convergence, are the major drivers for the poor air quality in NCP. The surface PM2.5 levels vary between -12.9â¼+15.1% in NCP driven by the varying climate conditions between the years 2000 and 2020. Besides, the persistent PM2.5 pollution might be maintained by the still intensive industrial and residential emissions (primary PM2.5), and increased atmospheric oxidants (+26.1% for ozone and +29.4% for hydroxyl radical) in response to the NO2 decline (secondary PM2.5). Further understanding the nonlinear response between atmospheric secondary aerosols and NOx emissions is meaningful to cope with the emerging air pollution problems in China.","Li, Mengmeng; Wang, Tijian; Xie, Min; Li, Shu; Zhuang, Bingliang; Fu, Qingyan; Zhao, Ming; Wu, Hao; Liu, Jane; Saikawa, Eri; Liao, Kuo",Atmos Environ (1994),384,1

As stressors such as COVID-19 and climate change further complicate living conditions, conflicting system priorities underscore the need for resilience in all building systems. In the engineering and architectural fields, sustainability rating frameworks are used to note, reward, and motivate the use of sustainable practices. As such, it is crucial to ensure that these frameworks genuinely encourage resilience in building systems. This paper conducts a review of the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design–Building Design and Construction (LEED BD+C v4.1) framework for New Construction through a credit-level analysis, to determine the extent to which the framework encourages the resilience of building systems beyond the scope of structure. Researchers identified, tabulated, and deconstructed relevant credits according to four key resilience factors: diversity, efficiency, adaptability, and cohesion. Findings indicated that, while efficiency is well supported, diversity, adaptability, and cohesion can be enhanced. The existing rating system provides a strong base upon which improvements can be made, but falls short of adequately encouraging the wide adoption of resilience needed for long-term sustainability. In short, while the LEED credits do reward resilient designs, they do not yet actively inspire them.","De Castro, Danielle",Sustainability,384,16

We aimed at identifying the variables associated with psychological distress during the lockdown between April and May 2020 in the Italian academic population. We conducted a multicenter cross-sectional online survey (IO CONTO 2020) within five Italian universities. Among about 240,000 individuals invited to participate through institutional communications, 18 120 filled the questionnaire. Psychological distress was measured by the self-administered Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). The covariates collected included demographic and lifestyle characteristics, trust in government, doctors and scientists. Associations of covariates with influenza-like symptoms or positive COVID-19 test and with psychological distress were assessed by multiple regression models at the local level; a meta-analysis of the results was then performed. Severe levels of anxiety or depression were reported by 20% of the sample and were associated with being a student or having a lower income, irrespective of their health condition and worries about contracting the virus. The probability of being severely anxious or depressed also depended on physical activity: compared to those never exercising, the highest OR being for those who stopped during lockdown (1.53; 95% CI, 1.28 to 1.84) and the lowest for those who continued (0.78; 95% CI, 0.64 to 0.95). Up to 21% of severe cases of anxiety or depression might have been avoided if during lockdown participants had continued to exercise as before. Socioeconomic insecurity contributes to increase mental problems related to the COVID-19 pandemic and to the measures to contain it. Maintaining or introducing an adequate level of physical activity is likely to mitigate such detrimental effects. Promoting safe practice of physical activity should remain a public health priority to reduce health risks during the pandemic.","Fornili, Marco; Petri, Davide; Berrocal, Carmen; Fiorentino, Giuseppe; Ricceri, Fulvio; Macciotta, Alessandra; Bruno, Andreina; Farinella, Domenica; Baccini, Michela; Severi, Gianluca; Baglietto, Laura",PLoS One,384,27

In patients with COVID-19, the mechanisms lead to thrombocytopenia seems to be multifactorial. Thrombotic consumption of platelets in microvasculature, cytokine release, sepsis, and drug induced, direct infection of megakaryocytes and autoimmune destruction of platelets are the leading etiologies in COVID-19 and thrombocytopenia. In this overview, the research was conducted by screening the relevant articles evaluating the COVID-19 associated thrombocytopenia in children. An electronic search was performed in online databases of Scopus, EMBASE, Cochrane, Web of Science and Medline (via PubMed) with English language from December 2019 up to September 2020. Thrombocytopenia at admission in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is common, but delayed phase thrombocytopenia (occurring 2 weeks after beginning of symptoms) is uncertain. The delayed phase thrombocytopenia in COVID-19 is more prevalent in infected case with low lymphocyte count at admission and has a significant correlation with higher mortality rate. In majority of cases with COVID-19 and thrombocytopenia, the platelet count is mildly decreased. Severe thrombocytopenia or a prompt decline in number of platelets often indicates immune mediated thrombocytopenia or in late terminal stages of this infection. Thrombocytopenia is a significant finding in patients with severe type of COVID -19. Immune mediated platelet destruction might account for the delayed-phase thrombocytopenia in a group of patients, and can manifest as severe thrombocytopenia.

The author explains why pastoral visitation should be considered essential care-especially at a time of crisis-and encourages hospital administrators across the country to clarify policies to welcome community clergy as essential personnel, but to do so with prudent procedures that mitigate risk to the community and to the visiting clergy. Given the fact that most hospitals in this country were founded by religious organizations and still carry the imprint of that founding in their names, it would be tragic for these very same hospitals to cut patients off from their religious communities precisely at the time they need them most.","Hall, Daniel E",J Relig Health,384,5

Diagnosis is usually via real-time PCR, and it is unclear whether the semi-quantitative capability of this method, determining viral load through cycle threshold (Ct) values, can be leveraged. OBJECTIVES: We aim to review available knowledge on correlations between SARS-COV-2 Ct values and patient- or healthcare-related outcomes to determine whether Ct values provide useful clinical information. SOURCES: A PubMed search was conducted on 1 June 2020 based on a search strategy of (Ct value OR viral load) AND SARS-CoV-2. Data were extracted from studies reporting on the presence or absence of an association between Ct values, or viral loads determined via Ct value, and clinical outcomes. CONTENT: Data from 18 studies were relevant for inclusion. One study reported on the correlation between Ct values and mortality and one study reported on the correlation between Ct values and progression to severe disease; both reported a significant association (p < 0.001 and p = 0.008, respectively). Fourteen studies reported on the correlation between Ct value or viral loads determined via Ct value and disease severity, and an association was observed in eight (57%) studies. Studies reporting on the correlation of viral load with biochemical and haematological markers showed an association with at least one marker, including increased lactate dehydrogenase (n = 4), decreased lymphocytes (n = 3) and increased high-sensitivity troponin I (n = 2). Two studies reporting on the correlation with infectivity showed that lower Ct values were associated with higher viral culture positivity. IMPLICATIONS: Data suggest that lower Ct values may be associated with worse outcomes and that Ct values may be useful in predicting the clinical course and prognosis of patients with COVID-19; however, further studies are warranted to confirm clinical value.","Rao, Sonia N; Manissero, Davide; Steele, Victoria R; Pareja, Josep",Infect Dis Ther,384,32

METHODS: The fourth wave of a national longitudinal study on ageing in people with ID in Ireland was interrupted during the COVID-19 outbreak. Social inclusion data for pre-existing participants interviewed before COVID-19 (n = 444) were compared with data for pre-existing participants interviewed during/after lockdown (n = 62). RESULTS: More people interviewed after lockdown reported frequent family contact. Significantly greater numbers in the post-lockdown group reported access to and use of technology than the pre-lockdown group. Technology use was higher among those living in grouped residences supported by services compared with individuals living independently or with family. CONCLUSIONS: During the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in Ireland, many older adults with ID stayed connected with family and reported rates of contact higher than were reported by others before COVID-19. This connection may have been supported by a significant increase in technology use during the pandemic. However, uneven use of technology may disadvantage some including individuals living with family or independently. Given that COVID-19 restrictions are likely to continue to restrict social opportunities, increased digital support may assist more people with ID to use technology to maintain their social connections.","McCausland, Darren; Luus, Retha; McCallion, Philip; Murphy, Esther; McCarron, Mary",J. intellect. dis. res,384,16

Current approaches to COVID-19 therapeutics focus on antiviral agents, convalescent plasma, monoclonal antibodies, immunomodulators and more traditional therapies such as steroids [1-6]. Reversing disturbances in coagulation has also been identified as a priority area for candidate therapies, such as through the Accelerating COVID-19 Therapeutic Interventions and Vaccines 4 adaptive clinical trial (ACTIV-4) which is currently evaluating aspirin, heparins and apixaban [7]. Since there is a clear relationship between mechanisms of coagulation and the immune response, it is possible that reversing disturbances in coagulation may diminish the dysregulated immune response observed in COVID-19. The basis for this hypothesis is described below and is followed by discussion of a proposed candidate therapy - activated protein C. By treating COVID-19 patients using a novel approach, which does not focus on immune-based or antiviral treatments, but instead which addresses both the anti-thrombotic and inflammatory consequences of infection, the hope is that new therapeutic targets can be considered and new candidate therapies, such as activated protein C, may be evaluated.","Pestka, Steven B",Med Hypotheses,384,16

It has been suggested that dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) can be another possible receptor for this virus. The present study aimed to establish if the DPP4 levels and DPP4 polymorphisms are associated with COVID-19 disease and its severity. METHODS: The study included 107 COVID-19 patients and 263 matched-healthy controls. Fifty patients required invasive mechanical ventilation. The DPP4 was quantified in serum using the Bioplex system. Based on the previous results and the functional prediction analysis, we select for the study 5 DPP4 polymorphisms (rs12617336, rs12617656, rs1558957, rs3788979, and rs17574) and these were determined using the 5´exonuclease TaqMan assays. RESULTS: Low levels of DPP4 were observed in COVID-19 patients (46.5 [33.1-57.7] ng/mL) when compared to healthy controls (125.3 [100.3-157.3] ng/mL) (P < 0.0001). Also, patients that required mechanical ventilation showed lower DPP4 levels (42.8 [29.8-56.9] ng/mL) than those that did not need this procedure (49.2 [39.9-65.6] ng/mL) (P = 0.012). DPP4 levels correlated negatively with age, fibrinogen, and platelet levels, and positively with albumin, alanine aminotransferase, and percentage of neutrophils. The DPP4 rs3788979 polymorphism was associated with a high risk of COVID-19 disease and, the TT genotype carriers had the lowest DPP4 levels. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, in the present study, an association of low levels of DPP4 with COVID-19 disease and severity was found. The association of the DPP4 rs3788979 polymorphism with COVID-19 is also reported.","Posadas-Sánchez, Rosalinda; Sánchez-Muñoz, Fausto; Guzmán-Martín, Carlos Alfonso; Hernández-Díaz Couder, Adrian; Rojas-Velasco, Gustavo; Fragoso, José Manuel; Vargas-Alarcón, Gilberto",Life Sci,384,10

By the end of March 2020 more than 160 countries and regions around the world were affected.The causative agent of COVID-19, is closely related to SARS-CoV–like bat Corona viruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC2.The whole genome sequencing and systematic analysis showed that this novel Corona virus is a distinct clad from β-Corona virus associated with human Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), which was officially named “SARS-CoV-2” by WHO. In January the transmission of the virus breached international borders and first case outside China was seen in Philipines and Thailand and then in USA. After that WHO declared it a global public-health emergency in January 30, 2020 and later declared it a pandemic in March 2020. All nations then adopted stringent measures to contain the spread of the disease. In India the first cases of COVID 19 positive were reported in the state of Kerala in January 2020 amongst Indiansstudying in China with a history of travel from China. The number of cases then increased and as on April 11, 2020 there were 6761 positive COVID-19 cases. The major concern to both human and animal health is viral infection of the respiratory tract whichis the most commonly occurring health problem and is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality. Commonly seen in children, elderly and immunocompromised patients. It is now importantand mandatory to take the stringent preventive and precautionary measure which is the need of the hour like strictly following social distancing, screening of disease, using the protective masks at the public places, Regular hand wash, use of personal protective equipment (PPE) by the practitioner’s, paramedics, health care workers, sanitary people etc. to prevent the spread of this dangerous Novel viral infectious disease COVID-19. To curb the disease, following altered social norms along with good sanitization and opting for active treatment using chloroquine or other drugs and prophylaxis using Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ).Though its use is yet to provide satisfactory results and to continue on research with the help of researchers to develop vaccines to restrain and combat the dread disease. © 2020","Mohite, P.; Mohite, D.; Anjankar, A.",Journal of Indian Academy of Forensic Medicine,384,27

Methods: Authors used descriptive model for this cross-sectional study based on facts in analyzed scientific literature deposited in on-line databases about healthy aging concept of the prevention and treatment of the people who will come or already came to the ""third trimester of the life"". Results and Discussion: Some 80-year-olds have levels of physical and mental capacity that compare favorably with 30-year-olds. Others of the same age may require extensive care and support for basic activities like dressing and eating. Policy should be framed to improve the functional ability of all older people, whether they are robust, care dependent or in between. Inequity reflects a large proportion (approximately 75%) of the diversity in capacity and circumstance observed in older age is the result of the cumulative impact of advantage and disadvantage across people's lives.

Drawing upon postcolonialism as a critical lens, this article makes perceptible the intractable issues of health politics. Postcolonial challenges shown by COVID-19 include immigration, changing politico-juridical definitions of identity, the legacy left by the Soviet era which poses an obstacle to modernising China's healthcare system, and the boom of birth tourism welcomed by the marketised turn of health and tourism policy in Hong Kong in the post-SARS era.

However, most commercial providers rely on privacy-compromising measures such as deriving location information from cellphones to estimate traffic. The lack of an open-source traffic estimation method using open data platforms is a bottleneck for building sophisticated navigation services on top of OpenStreetMap (OSM). We propose a deep learning-based Complex Event Processing (CEP) method that relies on publicly available video camera streams for traffic estimation. The proposed framework performs near-real-time object detection and objects property extraction across camera clusters in parallel to derive multiple measures related to traffic with the results visualized on OpenStreetMap. The estimation of object properties (e.g. vehicle speed, count, direction) provides multidimensional data that can be leveraged to create metrics and visualization for congestion beyond commonly used density-based measures. Our approach couples both flow and count measures during interpolation by considering each vehicle as a sample point and their speed as weight. We demonstrate multidimensional traffic metrics (e.g. flow rate, congestion estimation) over OSM by processing 22 traffic cameras from London streets.

METHODS: Medical records of pregnant and reproductive-aged non-pregnant women hospitalized with COVID-19 from January 15 to March 15, 2020 were retrospectively reviewed. The severity of disease, virus clearance time, and length of hospital stay were measured as the primary objective, while the vertical transmission potential of COVID-19 was also assessed. RESULTS: Eighty-two patients (28 pregnant women, 54 reproductive-aged non-pregnant women) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled in this study. Univariate regression indicated no association between pregnancy and severity of disease (OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.08-5.15; p=0.76), virus clearance time (HR 1.16, 95% CI 0.65-2.01; p=0.62), and length of hospital stay (HR 1.10, 95% CI 0.66-1.84; p=0.71).

We aimed to describe the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 outside of Wuhan city; and to develop a multivariate model to predict the risk of prolonged length of stay in hospital (ProLOS). Methods: The study was conducted in a tertiary care hospital in Zhejiang province from January to February 20, 2020. Medical records of all confirmed cases of COVID-19 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were categorized into the ProLOS and non-ProLOS groups by hospital length of stay greater and less than 14 days, respectively. Conventional descriptive statistics were applied. Multivariate regression model was built to predict the risk of ProLOS, with variables selected using stepwise approach. Results: A total of 75 patients with confirmed COVID-19 were included for quantitative analysis, including 25 (33%) patients in the ProLOS group. ProLOS patients were more likely to have history of traveling to Wuhan (68% vs. 28%; P=0.002). Patients in the ProLOS group showed lower neutrophil counts [median (IQR): 2.50 (1.77-3.23) ×10 9/L vs. 2.90 (2.21-4.19) ×10 9/L; P=0.048], higher partial thrombin time (PT) (13.42±0.63 vs. 13.10±0.48 s; P=0.029), lower D-Dimer [0.26 (0.22-0.46) vs. 0.44 (0.32-0.84) mg/L; P=0.012]. There was no patient died and no severe case in our cohort. The overall LOS was 11 days (IQR, 5-15 days). The median cost for a hospital stay was 7,388.19 RMB (IQR, 5,085.39-11,145.44). The prediction model included five variables of procalcitonin, heart rate, epidemiological history, lymphocyte count and cough. The discrimination of the model was 84.8% (95% CI: 75.3% to 94.4%).

To date, treatment of severe COVID-19 is far from clear. Therefore, it is urgent to develop an effective option for the treatment of patients with COVID-19. Most patients with severe COVID-19 exhibit markedly increased serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interferon (IFN)-&#945;, IFN-Î³, and interleukin (IL)-1ß. Immunotherapeutic strategies have an important role in the suppression of cytokine storm and respiratory failure in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: A systematic search in the literature was performed in PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, as well as Google Scholar preprint database using all available MeSH terms for Coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, anti-rheumatoid agents, COVID-19, cytokine storm, immunotherapeutic drugs, IFN, interleukin, JAK/STAT inhibitors, MCP, MIP, TNF. RESULTS: Here, we first review common complications of COVID-19 patients, particularly neurological symptoms. We next explain host immune responses against COVID-19 particles. Finally, we summarize the existing experimental and clinical immunotherapeutic strategies, particularly anti-rheumatoid agents and also plasma (with a high level of gamma globulin) therapy for severe COVID-19 patients. We discuss both their therapeutic effects and side effects that should be taken into consideration for their clinical application. CONCLUSION: It is suggested that immunosuppressants, such as anti-rheumatoid drugs, could be considered as a potential approach for the treatment of cytokine storm in severe cases of COVID-19. One possible limitation of immunosuppressant therapy is their inhibitory effects on host anti-viral immune response. So, the appropriate timing of administration should be carefully considered.","Bahari, Zahra; Jangravi, Zohreh; Ghoshooni, Hassan; Afarinesh, Mohammad Reza; Meftahi, Gholam Hossein",Inflamm Res,384,22

Essential bed space was made available, and it allowed mobilisation of health workers and enforced social distancing. A shift in patient-centred ethics to public health ethics was required to provide a utilitarian approach to the crisis. However, at some point, clinicians need to start becoming patient centred again, and this needs to happen within the utilitarian framework. Children only account for 1 - 5% of confirmed COVID-19 cases, and they present with a much milder disease spectrum than adults. Consequently, paediatric units may be at the forefront of implementing reintroduction of patient-centred elective clinical and surgical procedures. The following recommendations provide a framework to do this in a way that minimises risk to patients and clinicians. They are the first paediatric guidelines in the literature to propose a strategy to reintroduce elective surgical procedures.","McGuire, J K; Fagan, J J; Peer, S",S Afr Med J,384,20

In particular we discuss the worst affected large countries like India, Brazil and USA for estimating effect of vaccination rate in expediting the end of the COVID-19 epidemic. We analytically simulated the dynamic evolution of active cases of these countries in the last nine months using the modified SIR model and then included the effect of vaccination to forecast the proliferation dynamics.

We carried out a cohort study on the risk of hospitalization for COVID-19, oncological history, and outcomes on COVID-19 infected cancer patients admitted to the Hospital of Reggio Emilia. Between 1 February and 3 April 2020, a total of 1226 COVID-19 infected patients were hospitalized. The number of cancer patients hospitalized with COVID-19 infection was 138 (11.3%). The median age was slightly higher in patients with cancers than in those without (76.5 vs. 73.0). The risk of intensive care unit (ICU) admission (10.1% vs. 6.7%; RR 1.23, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.63-2.41) and risk of death (34.1% vs. 26.0%; RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.61-1.71) were similar in cancer and non-cancer patients.

Our hypothesis that ultraviolet (UV) radiation levels might be a factor and a more appropriate parameter has emerged as an alternative to assess seasonality and exploit it for public health policies. Using geographical, socioeconomic and epidemiological criteria, we selected twelve North-equatorial-South countries with similar characteristics. We then obtained UV levels, mobility and Covid-19 daily incidence rates for nearly the entire 2020. Using machine learning, we demonstrated that UV radiation strongly associated with incidence rates, more so than mobility did, indicating that UV is a key seasonality indicator for Covid-19, irrespective of the initial conditions of the epidemic.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the factors on hospital admission that are predictive of severe disease or death from COVID-19. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort analysis. SETTING: Five hospitals in the Maryland and Washington, DC, area. PATIENTS: 832 consecutive COVID-19 admissions from 4 March to 24 April 2020, with follow-up through 27 June 2020. MEASUREMENTS: Patient trajectories and outcomes, categorized by using the World Health Organization COVID-19 disease severity scale. Primary outcomes were death and a composite of severe disease or death. RESULTS: Median patient age was 64 years (range, 1 to 108 years); 47% were women, 40% were Black, 16% were Latinx, and 21% were nursing home residents. Among all patients, 131 (16%) died and 694 (83%) were discharged (523 [63%] had mild to moderate disease and 171 [20%] had severe disease). Of deaths, 66 (50%) were nursing home residents. Of 787 patients admitted with mild to moderate disease, 302 (38%) progressed to severe disease or death: 181 (60%) by day 2 and 238 (79%) by day 4. Patients had markedly different probabilities of disease progression on the basis of age, nursing home residence, comorbid conditions, obesity, respiratory symptoms, respiratory rate, fever, absolute lymphocyte count, hypoalbuminemia, troponin level, and C-reactive protein level and the interactions among these factors. Using only factors present on admission, a model to predict in-hospital disease progression had an area under the curve of 0.85, 0.79, and 0.79, at day 2, 4, and 7, respectively.

Many patients at Fangcang Hospitals had complications or mental stress. As the doctors, nurses and paramedics presented in the emergency, there was a growing demand for clinical pharmacists to provide pharmaceutical care for the affected patients with chronic diseases via telemedicine. OBJECTIVE: This study was a retrospective study to evaluate the usefulness of clinical prevention and control measures of clinical pharmacists at Jianghan Fangcang Hospital. Besides, this study proposed innovative strategies for developing pharmacy services to ensure the medication compliance, accuracy and cure rates under the epidemic. METHODS: A total of 374 patients filled in the questionnaires and 349 patients were enrolled in this study. Patients who refused to receive pharmaceutical care were not included in this study. The pharmaceutical care included medication education via broadcast station, medication reconciliation, optimisation of drug use, monitor of adverse drug events and psychological comfort via WeChat one-to-one service. The data were collected from patients' interviews and the questionnaires of inpatients and discharged patients. RESULTS: In Jianghan Fangcang Hospital, many patients had complications with hypertension (12.9%), hyperlipidaemia (9.2%), thyroid disease (8.9%), diabetes (7.2%), heart disease (3.4%), nephropathy (1.7%), cancer (1.1%) and other diseases (12.6%). After 35 days' pharmacy service, about 200 different questions had been solved by our clinical pharmacists, including drug usage (65.38%), medication reconciliation (55.13%), drug precautions (23.1%), adverse drug reactions (35.9%) and psychological counselling (32.05%). Most patients were satisfied with clinical pharmacist service (66.7% great, 18.0% good). CONCLUSION: The results of the retrospective study indicated that clinical pharmacist can effectively reduce and prevent drug-related, life-related and COVID-19-related problems for COVID-19 patients, which is important for the disease recovery. This study also demonstrated that clinical pharmacist played a key role for patients' healthcare during the pandemic.","Wang, Dongyuan; Liu, Yihui; Zeng, Fang; Shi, Chen; Cheng, Fang; Han, Yong; Zhang, Yu",Int J Clin Pract,384,8

Work patterns have changed, risk stratification has been proposed, and the mental health of clinicians has been adversely affected. The COVID-19 prevalence among GPs is unknown. This study focuses on assessing the impact of COVID-19 on GPs in Leicestershire, the first UK city to lock down locally. AIM: This survey assessed the prevalence of COVID-19 in GPs and explored GP work patterns in comparison with national guidance. It used a validated perceived stress tool to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on GP stress perception. DESIGN & SETTING: The cross-sectional retrospective survey was sent to all the GPs in Leicestershire. METHOD: A total of 111 GPs in Leicestershire took part voluntarily in an anonymised questionnaire-based study. A 29-item survey using SmartSurvey software was designed with multiple choice and Likert response scale questions. RESULTS: COVID-19 prevalence in GPs in Leicestershire was 8.1%; 70.3% of GPs were of Black, Asian, and minority ethnic (BAME) origin; 91.9% of GPs had undergone risk stratification; and 79.3% of GPs felt supported by their practice, but only 59.5% felt supported with mental health. GPs described feeling more stressed during the COVID-19 pandemic than they had been previously. CONCLUSION: This is the first study evaluating COVID-19 prevalence among GPs in Leicestershire. Despite government interventions, GPs felt less supported with their mental health compared with pre-COVID-19 times. Thus, the NHS in England should focus on GP stress and wellbeing as they work towards the restoration and recovery of primary care while battling the second wave.","Trivedi, Namrata; Trivedi, Vivek; Moorthy, Arumugam; Trivedi, Hina",,384,2

The K-FACE database contains more than 1 million high-quality images of 1,000 subjects selected by considering the ratio of gender and age groups. It includes a variety of attributes, including 27 poses, 35 lighting conditions, three expressions, and occlusions by the combination of five types of accessories. As the K-FACE database is systematically constructed through a hemispherical capturing system with elaborate lighting control and multiple cameras, it is possible to accurately analyze the effects of factors that cause performance degradation, such as poses, lighting changes, and accessories. We consider not only the balance of external environmental factors, such as pose and lighting, but also the balance of personal characteristics such as gender and age group. The gender ratio is the same, while the age groups of subjects are uniformly distributed from the 20s to 50s for both genders. The K-FACE database can be extensively utilized in various vision tasks, such as face recognition, face frontalization, illumination normalization, face age estimation, and three-dimensional face model generation. We expect systematic diversity and uniformity of the K-FACE database to promote these research fields.","Choi, Yeji; Park, Hyunjung; Nam, Gi Pyo; Kim, Haksub; Choi, Heeseung; Cho, Junghyun; Kim, Ig-Jae",,384,1

Evidence supporting its quality and safety is required. AIMS: Assess the efficacy and safety of telephone clinics in delivering care to established oncology patients and assess patient and health professionals' preference (telephone vs face-to-face clinics). METHODS: Retrospective chart audit in the month preceding and month following introduction of telephone clinics at the Gold Coast University hospital and a patient and health professional questionnaire. RESULTS: In total, 1212 clinical encounters occurred in the month post the introduction of telephone clinics (vs 1208 encounters prior). There were no statistically significant differences in 24-h (18 vs 22, p = 0.531) or 7-day admissions (50 vs 46, p = 0.665) comparing encounters in the month prior to the introduction of telephone clinics vs the month post, but there was a statistically significant difference in 30-day mortality post systemic therapy in favour of the post-telephone clinic period (7 vs 0 patients, p = 0.008). Of the 222 patients who undertook the questionnaire, 42.3% preferred telephone clinics (95% CI 35.97-48.97), 25.2% preferred face-to-face clinics (95% CI 19.92-31.39) and 32.4% did not prefer one method over another. Of the 24 health professionals who undertook the questionnaire, 70.8% felt patients preferred phone clinics. CONCLUSIONS: Generally, patients and clinicians viewed telephone clinics favourably. Nevertheless, a large portion of patients still prefer face-to-face clinics. Services should be tailored to individual preferences. Although there were no 'red flags' in terms of mortality or admission rates, further longitudinal research is required. This article is protected by copyright.

OBJECTIVES: To compare long-term disease-specific survival (DSS) and outcomes between sMTC and hMTC groups. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis. SETTING: German tertiary referral center. PATIENTS: 673 patients with MTC that underwent surgery from January 1974 to July 2019. INTERVENTION: None (observational study). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Differences between sMTC and hMTC in long-term, stage-dependent survival and outcomes. RESULTS: Surgery was performed at median ages of 49 years for sMTC (n=477, 44% male) and 29 years for hMTC (n=196, 43% male; p<0.0001). The mean follow-up times were 9.2±8.0 (sMTC) and 14.6±10.3 years (hMTC). Age and tumor stage at diagnosis were significantly different between the two groups (p<0.0001). The sMTC and hMTC groups had different overall DSS (log rank, p=0.0183), but similar stage-dependent DSS (log rank, p=0.1242 to 0.8981). In a multivariate analysis, sMTC and hMTC did not differ in DSS (HR=1.56, 95%CI=0.94-2.57), but in both groups, a worse DSS was significantly associated with age at diagnosis (HR=1.04, 95%CI=1.02-1.05), male sex (HR=0.49, 95%CI=0.32-0.76), and stages III and IV at diagnosis (HR=20.00, 95%CI=2.74-145.91 and HR=97.47, 95%CI=13.07-726.67, respectively). The groups had significantly different (p<0.0001) outcomes (i.e., cured, minimal residual disease, structural detectable disease, and death), but similar stage-dependent outcomes (p=0.9449 to 0.0511), except for stage III (p=0.0489). CONCLUSION: Patients with sMTC and hMTC had different ages of onset, but similar stagedependent DSS and outcomes after the MTC diagnosis. This finding suggested that tumor behavior was similar in sMTC and hMTC. PRÉCIS: This observational study of 673 patients with sporadic (n=477) and hereditary MTC (n=196) revealed similar disease-specific survival rates and outcomes, which suggested similar tumor behavior.","Raue, Friedhelm; Bruckner, Thomas; Frank-Raue, Karin",J. clin. endocrinol. metab,384,33

Hypertension (65%) and diabetes mellitus (55%) were the most common comorbidities in our patients. In our multivariate regression analysis, male sex, nausea and loss of appetite at presentation were associated with improvement in oxygenation after CP. Total survival time, history of obstructive airway disease, home use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers were associated with decreased survival, whereas Hispanic ethnicity showed a trend towards lower survival after CP therapy.Conclusions: Our study highlights several important characteristics of inner-city safety net hospital patient population who might benefit from CP therapy.","Chilimuri, Sridhar Maleeha Zahid Mantri Nikhitha Sun Haozhe Saleh Mohamed Shoaib Ashraf Sudharsan Gongati Adrish Muhammad",Journal of Community Hospital Internal Medicine Perspectives,384,32

In all three countries, the leaders' responses to the outbreak can be characterised by the following features: simplifying the pandemic by downplaying its impacts or touting easy solutions or treatments, spectacularizing their responses to crisis, forging divisions between the 'people' and dangerous 'others', and making medical knowledge claims to support the above. Taken together, the case studies illuminate the role of individual political actors in defining public health crises, suggesting that medical populism is not an exceptional, but a familiar response to them.

The main object of the current research was to estimate the antiviral activity of cannabinoids (CBDs) against the human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. In the presented research work, we performed in silico and in vitro experiments to aid the sighting of lead CBDs for treating the viral infections of SARS-CoV-2. Virtual screening was carried out for interactions between 32 CBDs and the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro enzyme. Afterward, in vitro antiviral activity was carried out of five CBDs molecules against SARS-CoV-2. Interestingly, among them, two CBDs molecules namely &#916; (Yu et al., 2020 [9])-tetrahydrocannabinol (IC50â¯=â¯10.25â¯µM) and cannabidiol (IC50â¯=â¯7.91â¯µM) were observed to be more potent antiviral molecules against SARS-CoV-2 compared to the reference drugs lopinavir, chloroquine, and remdesivir (IC50 ranges of 8.16-13.15â¯µM). These molecules were found to have stable conformations with the active binding pocket of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro by molecular dynamic simulation and density functional theory. Our findings suggest cannabidiol and &#916; (Yu et al., 2020 [9])-tetrahydrocannabinol are possible drugs against human coronavirus that might be used in combination or with other drug molecules to treat COVID-19 patients.","Raj, Vinit; Park, Jae Gyu; Cho, Kiu-Hyung; Choi, Pilju; Kim, Taejung; Ham, Jungyeob; Lee, Jintae",Int. j. biol. macromol,384,1

Since 2014, many tests and treatment programs have been developed to achieve the above goals worldwide. In 2019, it was reported that many developed countries can reach the target with the right strategies, as well as regions that are still far from the targets. It has been reported that the fourth 90 should be one of the targets related to HIV infection in recent years. This view, beyond virological suppression, was towards developing programs that would enable people living with HIV to live not only longer but also healthy. The socio-cultural and economic obstacles to reach the targets may vary according to geographical regions, but it is clear that COVID-19 disease, which has taken the whole world under influence since 2019, is a major obstacle to the 90-90-90 targets worldwide. Difficulties in the diagnosis and access to ART and treatment nonadherence which may be encountered more frequently due to many factors may threaten both the health of people living with HIV and public health. The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted many programs developed in the fight against the HIV epidemic. Considering COVID-19 disease and future epidemics that may create a chaotic environment, analyzing the difficulties experienced in the pandemic retrospectively, and determining new strategies that will bring appropriate solutions to the problems will play an important role in the proper management of future issues.","Karaosmanoglu, Hayat Kumbasar",Current HIV research (Online),384,30

DESIGN: This was a qualitative study deploying face-to-face, semistructured interviews. Thematic analysis was carried out to analyse the data. SETTING: Paediatric respiratory clinics in three tertiary hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: 16 caregivers providing unpaid asthma-related care and assistance to children under 14 years who had been diagnosed with asthma for more than 1 year and were not only treated with short-acting ß2-agonists. RESULTS: Six main themes were identified: (1) improved asthma control; (2) decreased willingness to seek medical care driven by fear; (3) increased adherence due to enhanced awareness of asthma control; (4) coping strategies for changes caused by COVID-19; (5) a new opportunity and (6) managing new challenges in asthma control. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 outbreak and the measures in response to it have had significant impacts on asthma control among children. Children with asthma are advised to continue good asthma management, take their prescribed asthma medications as normal, wash their hands regularly and wear face masks. Regularly supported self-management and remote consultations should be provided during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, supporting people financially, providing continued medical support and alleviating any fear and anxiety should be considered.

DESIGN: Observational study. SETTING: We tested the hypothesis that community-living older people who are screened positive for sarcopenia using the SARC-F tool but without a history of heart failure (HF) have a higher prevalence of cardiac abnormalities compared with those who are SARC-F negative. PARTICIPANTS: Participants were recruited from a territory-wide primary care needs assessment for older people based in community centres, and from non-acute hospitals in the same region as the study centre. MEASUREMENTS: Participants with a total score of >=4 and who did not have any history of HF were invited to attend for further cardiac assessment. Grip strength, walking speed, and the 6-minute walk test and echocardiography were carried out. Patients with frailty and at least Grade II diastolic dysfunction were considered to have heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) if they also had concomitant elevated N-terminal prohormone of B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) of at least 300 pg/ml. RESULTS: Diastolic dysfunction (DD) was significantly associated with SARC-F score >=4 and higher circulating NT-proBNP levels. ROC curves evaluating the predictive values of SARC-F, HGS and gait speed for DD showed that a combination of SARC-F and HGS or gait speed provided significant incremental value in predicting DD. CONCLUSIONS: Community living older people with sarcopenia detected using a simple questionnaire have a higher prevalence of DD accompanied by elevated NT proBNP. Addition of hand grip strength or walking speed improve the magnitude of the association. SARC-F may be used as a tool to detect early cardiac dysfunction in the community.","Yang, X; Woo, J; Ting Lui, L; Li, Q; Fai Cheng, K; Fan, Y; Yau, F; Lee, A P W; Lee, J S W; Fung, E",J Nutr Health Aging,384,16

Elevated transforming growth factor ß (TGFß) signalling is implicated in cSCC development and progression in RDEB patients. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of exogenous and endogenous TGFß signalling in RDEB cSCC with a view to assess the potential of targeting TGFß signalling for RDEB cSCC therapy. METHODS: A panel of 11 patient derived RDEB cSCC primary tumour keratinocyte cell lines (SCCRDEBs) were tested for their signalling and proliferation responses to exogenous TGFß. Their responses to TGFBR1 kinase inhibitors (SB-431542 and AZ12601011(AZA01)) was tested using in vitro proliferation, clonogenicity, migration, 3D invasion assays and in vivo tumour xenograft assays. RESULTS: All SCCRDEBs respond to exogenous TGFß by activation of canonical SMAD signalling and proliferative arrest. Blocking endogenous signalling by treatment with SB-431542 and AZ12601011 significantly inhibited proliferation (n=7/11), clonogenicity (n=6/11), migration (n=8/11) and invasion (6/11) of SCCRDEBs. However, these TGFBR1 kinase inhibitors also promoted proliferation and clonogenicity in 2/11 SCCRDEBs. Pre-treatment of in vitro TGFBR1 addicted SCCRDEB70 cells with SB-431542 enhanced overall survival and reduced tumour volume in subcutaneous xenografts but had no effect on non-addicted SCCRDEB2 cells in these assays. CONCLUSION: Targeting TGFBR1 kinase activity may have therapeutic benefit in the majority of RDEB cSCCs, however, the potential tumour suppressive role of TGFß signalling in a subset of RDEB cSCCs necessitates biomarker identification to enable patient stratification before clinical intervention.","Dayal, J H S; Mason, S M; Salas-Alanis, J C; McGrath, J A; Taylor, R G; Mellerio, J E; Blyth, K; South, A P; Inman, G J",Br. j. dermatol,384,26

Egypt has assigned certain hospitals specifically for the quarantine of COVID-19 patients, where operational medical teams work continuously for 14 days, after which they are released for self-isolation at home for a similar period. Aims: The study aimed to evaluate and compare perceived adverse psychological symptoms (stress, anxiety, depression), and insomnia by health-care professionals working in quarantine and non-quarantine hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic in Egypt, and to explore associated factors with adverse psychological symptoms and insomnia. Methods: An online cross-sectional survey was performed in April 2020, using a snowball sampling method. Sociodemographic information perceived general health, healthy lifestyle, insomnia (using Insomnia Severity Index), adverse psychological symptoms (using the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21), worries and concerns about COVID-19, future perspective about COVID-19, and coping strategies were collected. Results: Five hundred and forty health-care professionals participated; 10.2% (n=55) worked in quarantine hospitals.

Methods: A nationwide, web-based, self-administered, cross-sectional survey was conducted from 5 to 20 October 2020. The health belief model (HBM) approach was used as a theoretical framework to assess the predictors of acceptance of and WTP for the COVID-19 vaccine. Results: Of 2 480 respondents, 2 451 completed the online survey, yielding a response rate of 98.8%. Participants who participated in the survey had diverse demographics in terms of their location, educational level, occupation type, and family income. Among 2 451 respondents, the majority (89.3%) intended to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Respondents with high perceived benefits of COVID-19 vaccination, such as reduction in worry (OR 5.87;95% CI 4.39-7.96) and sickness (OR 4.31;95% CI 3.31-5.62), showed higher intention to receive the vaccine. However, respondents with a high perception of the side effects and barriers to vaccination (OR 0.36;95% CI 0.25-0.54) and vaccine shortage (OR 0.58;95% CI 0.41-0.81) showed lower intention to receive the vaccine. The majority (2 162, 88.21%) of respondents were willing to pay an amount of INR: 500-1 000 or USD: 6.81-13.62 for a dose of COVID-19 vaccine, with a median (Q1, Q3) of INR: 500 (500, 1 000) or USD: 6.81 (6.81, 13.62). The higher marginal WTP for the COVID-19 vaccine was influenced by advanced age, marital status, female sex, intermediate educational background, high family income, fair or poor perceived health status, and no affordable barriers. Conclusions: The majority of respondents intended to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Healthcare interventions focusing on HBM constructs and demographic predictors associated with low intention to receive the vaccine can be effective in enhancing the coverage of the COVID-19 vaccine.

METHODS: Chest CT images of patients with reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-positive COVID-19 were categorized according to the CORADS and RSNA classifications by radiologists with different levels of experience and who were initially unaware of the RT-PCR results. The inter- and intra-observer concordances for each of the classifications were calculated, as were the concordances between classifications. RESULTS: A total of 100 patients were included in this study. The RSNA classification showed an almost perfect inter-observer agreement between reviewers with similar experience levels, with a kappa coefficient of 0.892 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.788-0.995). CORADS showed substantial agreement among reviewers with similar experience levels, with a kappa coefficient of 0.642 (95% CI, 0.491-0.793). There was inter-observer variation when comparing less experienced reviewers with more experienced reviewers, with the highest kappa coefficient of 0.396 (95% CI, 0.255-0.588). There was a significant correlation between both classifications, with a Kendall coefficient of 0.899 (p&lt;0.001) and substantial intra-observer agreement for both classifications. CONCLUSION: The RSNA and CORADS classifications showed excellent inter-observer agreement for reviewers with the same level of experience, although the agreement between less experience reviewers and the reviewer with the most experience was only reasonable.

The objective of this study was to assess the level of knowledge and Awareness among Physiotherapy students to combat COVID-19. Methods: A total of 203 participants from MMIPR, MM(DU), Mullana completed a questionnaire based survey on the Knowledge and Awareness among Physiotherapy students to Combat COVID-19. The questionnaire was self-administrated and distributed through WhatsApp. Convenient sampling method was used for data collection and the distributions of responses were presented as frequencies and percentages. Results: A total of 203 physiotherapy students participated in this survey (143 females& 60 males), forming a response rate of 53.4% (203 participated out of 380). The overall awareness for all the participants was adequate with 73.1% reporting correct answers. The findings of this study revealed that 93% of subjects (score more than 60%) have good knowledge and awareness to combat COVID-19. However, only 49% knew the correct name of the virus causing COVID-19 infection, only 41% of participants were aware about the diagnostic measures, and only 25.6% were aware of the treatment strategies. 91% of the respondents uses 'Aarogya Setu' app, while 85% says agrees that it helps to know more about the social distancing. Conclusion: We conclude that physiotherapy students of MMIPR, MM(DU), Mullana (Ambala) were well aware about the knowledge on COVID-19 infection and its preventive measures.","Jangra, Mandeep Kumar; Saxena, Akanksha; Anurag, Praharsh",Clin Epidemiol Glob Health,384,16

Materials & methods: PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library were searched for relevant studies. The primary end points of the study were immunotoxicity and cancer response. Results: At the early use of ICIs, compared with those with active AID, grade 3-4 AID flare occurred more frequently in patients with inactive AID after treatment with ICIs; and the incidence of grade 3-4 immunotoxic effects was significantly lower in patients undergoing immunosuppressive therapy than those without corresponding treatment. In addition, patients with worsening AID generally obtained a better objective response than those without a flare. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that the toxic effects induced by immunotherapy are generally manageable in patients with cancer and pre-existing AID, some of whom even achieve satisfactory antitumor effects in clinical practice.","Wu, Chunlan; Zhong, Li; Wu, Qing; Lin, Shaowei; Xie, Xianhe",Immunotherapy,384,16

It has already affected more than 300,000 people, with the number of deaths nearing 13000 across the world. As it has been posing a huge threat to global public health, it is of utmost importance to identify the rate at which the disease is spreading. In this study, we propose a time series model to analyze the trend pattern of the incidence of COVID-19 outbreak. We also incorporate information on total or partial lockdown, wherever available, into the model. The model is concise in structure, and using appropriate diagnostic measures, we showed that a time-dependent quadratic trend successfully captures the incidence pattern of the disease. We also estimate the basic reproduction number across different countries, and find that it is consistent except for the United States of America. The above statistical analysis is able to shed light on understanding the trends of the outbreak, and gives insight on what epidemiological stage a region is in. This has the potential to help in prompting policies to address COVID-19 pandemic in different countries.","Deb, Soudeep; Majumdar, Manidipa",,384,3

After the first report from China, the outbreak spread rapidly worldwide. To, date no clear indications on how to treat patients with cancer with COVID-19 infection are available. METHODS: We report data on 21 patients with cancer referred to a single medical oncology unit of a general hospital from mid-March to April 23, 2020. RESULTS: Nine patients were on active cancer therapy during the infection and all stopped medical treatments. Overall 8 patients developed pneumonia and 6 patients died of COVID-19.

The daily reports of confirmed cases and deaths in Canada prior to 15 December 2020 were obtained from publicly available sources and used to examine regional variations in case fatality rate (CFR). Based on a factor of underestimation and the duration of time from symptom onset to death, the time-delay adjusted CFR for COVID-19 was estimated in the four most affected provinces (Quebec, Ontario, Alberta, and British Columbia) and nationwide. The model-based adjusted CFR was higher than the crude CFR throughout the pandemic, primarily owing to the incorporation in our estimation of the delay between case reports and deaths. The adjusted CFR in Canada was estimated to be 3.36% nationwide. At the provincial level, the adjusted CFR was the highest in Quebec (5.13%)-where the proportion of deaths among older individuals was also the highest among the four provinces-followed by Ontario (3.17%), British Columbia (1.97%), and Alberta (1.13%). Provincial-level variations in CFR were considerable, suggesting that public health interventions focused on densely populated areas and elderly individuals can ameliorate the mortality burden of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Shim, Eunha",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),384,5

Early intervention in aortovascular disease is often critical and cannot be deferred despite these reductions. There is urgent need to evaluate the provision and outcomes of thoracic aortovascular intervention during the peak of the pandemic. METHODS: Prospective data was collected for patients receiving open and endovascular thoracic aortovascular intervention over two-time points; January-May 2020 and January-May 2019 at three tertiary cardiovascular centres. Baseline demographics, cardiovascular risk and COVID-19 screening results were noted. Primary outcomes were median length of intensive care unit and hospital stay, intra-operative mortality, 30-day mortality, post-operative stroke, and spinal cord injury. RESULTS: Patients operated in 2020 (41) had significantly higher median EuroSCORE II than 2019 (53) (7.44 vs. 5.86, Pâ¯=â¯0.032) and rates of previous cardiac (19.5% vs. 3.8%, Pâ¯=â¯0.019), aortic (14.6% vs. 1.9%, Pâ¯=â¯0.041), and endovascular (22.0% vs. 3.8%, Pâ¯=â¯0.009) intervention. There was an increase in proportion of urgent cases in 2020 (31.7% vs. 18.9%). There were no intra-operative deaths in 2020 and 1 in 2019 (Pâ¯=â¯1.00). There were no significant differences (P &#8805; 0.05) in 30-day mortality (4.9% vs. 13.2%), median intensive care unit length of stay (72 vs. 70 hr), median hospital length of stay (8 vs. 9 days), post-operative stroke (3 vs. 6), or spinal cord injury (2 vs. 1) between 2020 and 2019 respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the increased mortality risk of patients and urgency of cases during COVID-19, complicated by the introduction of cohorting and screening regimens, thoracic aortovascular intervention remained safe with comparable in outcomes to pre-COVID-19.","McPherson, Iain; Chilvers, Nicholas; Freystaetter, Kathrin; Sivaharan, Ashwin; Kanani, Mazyar; Williams, Robin; McCaslin, James; Nandhra, Sandip; Booth, Karen",Ann. vasc. surg,384,20

OBJECTIVE: To characterise the distribution and clinical features of diseases associated with pediatric PH, including natural history, evaluation, therapeutic interventions and outcomes, as defined by the WSPH Classification. METHODS: 1475 patients were enrolled into a multisite registry across the Pediatric Pulmonary Hypertension Network (PPHNet), comprised of 8 interdisciplinary PH programs. RESULTS: WSPH Groups 1 (PAH) and 3 (lung disease) were the most common primary classifications (45% and 49% of subjects, respectively). The most common Group 3 conditions were BPD and CDH. Group 1 disease was predominantly associated with congenital heart disease (60%) and idiopathic (23% of Group 1 cases). In comparison with Group 1, Group 3 subjects had better disease resolution (HR=3.1, p<0.001), tended to be younger at diagnosis (0.3 (0.0,0.6) versus 1.6 (0.1,6.9) years (median (IQR); p<0.001), and were more often male (57% versus. 45%, p<0.001). Down syndrome (DS), the most common genetic syndrome in the registry, constituted 11% of the entire PH cohort.

Older individuals are deemed to be at higher risk for poor outcomes with COVID-19. Although previous studies have shown a high proportion of older providers nationwide across medical specialties, we are not aware of any previous study that has analyzed the age distribution among the orthopaedic workforce. Therefore, the purposes of the present study were (1) to determine the geographic distribution of U.S. orthopaedic surgeons by age, (2) to compare the distribution with other surgical specialties, and (3) to compare this distribution with the spread of COVID-19. METHODS: Demographic statistics from the most recent State Physician Workforce Data Reports published by the Association of American Medical Colleges were extracted to identify the 2018 statewide proportion of practicing orthopaedic surgeons &#8805;60 years of age as well as age-related demographic data for all surgical specialties. Geospatial data on the distribution of COVID-19 cases were obtained from the Environmental Systems Research Institute. State boundary files were taken from the U.S. Census Bureau. Orthopaedic workforce age data were utilized to group states into quintiles. RESULTS: States with the highest quintile of orthopaedic surgeons &#8805;60 years of age included states most severely affected by COVID-19: New York, New Jersey, California, and Florida. For all states, the median number of providers &#8805;60 years of age was 105.5 (interquartile range [IQR], 45.5 to 182.5). The median proportion of orthopaedic surgeons &#8805;60 years of age was higher than that of all other surgical subspecialties, apart from thoracic surgery. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, the present report provides the first age-focused view of the orthopaedic workforce during the COVID-19 pandemic. States in the highest quintile of orthopaedic surgeons &#8805;60 years old are also among the most overwhelmed by COVID-19. As important orthopaedic acute care continues in addition to COVID-19 frontline service, special considerations may be needed for at-risk staff. Appropriate health system measures and workforce-management strategies should protect the subset of those who are most potentially vulnerable. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic Level IV.

Methods: Patients with the Influenza-Like Illness symptoms who attended the emergency department of The Six Medical Center of The PLA General Hospital from February 10 to April 1, 2020 were enrolled. Clinical and imaging data of the enrolled patients were collected and analyzed. The association between clinical characteristics and abnormal chest CT was also analyzed. Results: A total of 148 cases were enrolled in this study. Abnormalities on chest CT were detected in 61/148 (41.2%) patients. The most common abnormal CT features were as follows: patchy consolidation 22/61(36.1%), ground-glass opacities 21/61(34.4%), multifocal consolidations 17/61(27.9%). The advanced age and underlying diseases were significantly associated with abnormal chest CT. Conclusions: Abnormal chest CT is a common condition in Influenza-Like Illness cases. The presence of advanced age and concurrent underlying diseases is significantly associated with abnormal chest CT findings in patients with ILI symptoms. The chest CT characteristic of ILI is different from the manifestation of COVID-19 infection, which is helpful for differential diagnosis.","Shuai, Weizheng; Chen, Xuxin; Shan, Yi; Li, Wenping; Ma, Wei; Lu, Qiaohui; Li, Dawei",Front Public Health,384,12

We aimed to determine the effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection on outcome of hospitalized patients with cirrhosis and to compare the performance of different prognostic models for predicting mortality. PATIENTS: We performed a prospective cohort study including 2211 hospitalized patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection from April 15, 2020 through October 1, 2020 in 38 Hospitals from 11 Latin American countries. We registered clinical and laboratory parameters of patients with and without cirrhosis. All patients were followed until discharge or death. We evaluated the prognostic performance of different scoring systems to predict mortality in patients with cirrhosis using ROC curves. RESULTS: Overall, 4.6% (CI 3.7-5.6) subjects had cirrhosis (n = 96). Baseline Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) class was assessed: CTP-A (23%), CTP-B (45%) and CTP-C (32%); median MELD-Na score was 19 (IQR 14-25). Mortality was 47% in patients with cirrhosis and 16% in patients without cirrhosis (P < .0001). Cirrhosis was independently associated with death [OR 3.1 (CI 1.9-4.8); P < .0001], adjusted by age, gender, and body mass index >30. The areas under the ROC curves for performance evaluation in predicting 28-days mortality for Chronic Liver Failure Consortium (CLIF-C), North American Consortium for the Study of End-Stage Liver Disease (NACSELD), CTP score and MELD-Na were 0.85, 0.75, 0.69, 0.67; respectively (P < .0001). CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with elevated mortality in patients with cirrhosis. CLIF-C had better performance in predicting mortality than NACSELD, CTP and MELD-Na in patients with cirrhosis and SARS-CoV-2 infection.

METHODS: Consecutive patients with documented SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as clinical and radiological characteristics of CVST, were reported from three teaching hospitals in the South West, North West, and the center of Iran between June and July 2020. We also searched the abstract archives until the end of August 2020 and gathered 28 reported cases. The diagnostic criteria for SARS-CoV-2 infection were determined according to SARS-CoV-2 detection in oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal samples in clinically suspected patients. Demographics, prominent COVID-19 symptoms, confirmatory tests for SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosis, the interval between the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection and CVST, clinical and radiological features of CVST, therapeutic strategies, CVST outcomes, rate of hemorrhagic transformation, and mortality rate were investigated. RESULTS: Six patients (31-62 years-old) with confirmed CVST and SARS-CoV-2 infection were admitted to our centers. Four patients had no respiratory symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Five patients developed the clinical manifestations of CVST and SARS-CoV-2 infection simultaneously. Three patients had known predisposing factors for CVST. Despite receiving CVST and SARS-CoV-2 infection treatments, four patients died. SARS-COV-2 associated CVST patients were older (49.26 vs. 37.77 years-old), had lower female/male ratio (1.42 vs. 2.19), and higher mortality rate (35.29% vs. 6.07%) than CVST not associated with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: The role of SARS-CoV-2 as a ""cause"" versus an ""additive contributor"" remains to be elucidated. Practitioners should be aware of the possibility of CVST in SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Ostovan, Vahid Reza; Foroughi, Razieh; Rostami, Mahtab; Almasi-Dooghaee, Mostafa; Esmaili, Manouchehr; Bidaki, Ali Akbar; Behzadi, Zahra; Farzadfard, Farzane; Marbooti, Hoda; Rahimi-Jaberi, Abbas; Poursadeghfard, Maryam; Fadakar, Nima; Bayat, Mahnaz; Owjfard, Maryam; Salehi, Mohammad Saied; Zafarmand, Seyedeh Shaghayegh; Mardi, Farzad; Safari, Anahid; Shahjouei, Shima; Mowla, Ashkan; Azarpazhooh, Mahmoud Reza; Zand, Ramin; Hooshmandi, Etrat; Borhani-Haghighi, Afshin",J. neurol,384,26

One of the main determining factors of the poor prognosis in these patients is the development of coagulopathy. Moreover, it is well known that assisted reproductive technology procedures confer a risk of thromboembolic complications. This commentary analyses specific aspects coexisting between the thrombotic risk described during virus infection and that reported in the context of assisted reproduction treatments. Based on known pathophysiological aspects of virus infection and of ovarian stimulation, there are common elements that deserve to be taken into account. In the present context, any risk of hyperstimulation should be avoided. Gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonist triggering should be mandatory in high-responder patients and/or those with COVID-19 infection. In both cases, the cycle should be segmented. A proposal is made for the use of prophylactic low molecular weight heparin not only in those cases in which oocyte retrieval has been performed, but also in those in which cancellation has been decided. In addition, endometrial preparation for frozen-thawed embryo transfers should use the transdermal route in order to minimize the higher thrombotic risk associated with the oral route.","Fabregues, Francesc; Peñarrubia, Joana",Reprod Biomed Online,384,16

In traditional epidemiological models such as SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, Removed), the exposed group E does not infect the susceptible group S. A distinguishing feature of COVID-19 is that, unlike with previous viral diseases, there is a distinct “asymptomatic” group A, which does not show any symptoms, but can nevertheless infect others, at the same rate as infected symptomatic patients. This situation is captured in a model known as SAIR (Susceptible, Asymptomatic, Infected, Removed), introduced in Robinson and Stillianakis (2013). The dynamical behavior of the SAIR model is quite different from that of the SEIR model. In this paper, we use Lyapunov theory to establish the global asymptotic stabililty of the SAIR model, both without and with vital dynamics. Then we develop compartmental SAIR models to cater to the migration of population across geographic regions, and once again establish global asymptotic stability. Next, we go beyond long-term asymptotic analysis and present methods for estimating the parameters in the SAIR model. We apply these estimation methods to data from several countries including India, and demonstrate that the predicted trajectories of the disease closely match actual data. We show that “herd immunity” (defined as the time when the number of infected persons is maximum) can be achieved when the total of infected, symptomatic and asymptomatic persons is as low as 25% of the population. Previous estimates are typically 50% or higher. We also conclude that “lockdown” as a way of greatly reducing inter-personal contact has been very effective in checking the progress of the disease.","Ansumali, Santosh; Kaushal, Shaurya; Kumar, Aloke; Prakash, Meher K.; Vidyasagar, M.",Annu Rev Control,384,20

We present our experience in breast cancer surgery performed at the private hospital considered as a COVID-19 free hub to cope with limited resources and the acute hospital. Methods: An observational study of patients undergoing breast cancer surgery during the pandemic between March 17th, the first case of COVID-19 in hospital, and June 30th. Data collected: Demographics, co-morbidities, type of operation, pre and post op COVID status, post-operative complications. Patients were followed up 2 weeks post-operatively via telephone conversation or clinic appointment. Screening protocols included CXR &/or swabs. Results: 117 patients (pts) of which 41pts (35%) were operated on at the acute hospital and 76pts (65%) at the private hospital. One male patient and the median age was 59 years (36 - 89). 35pts (30%) were ASA 1, 78pts (67%) ASA 2, 4pts (3%) ASA 3. None of the patients had COVID-19 related symptoms or re-admissions in the 2 weeks post-surgery. One post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy patient had SARS-CoV-2 positive swab test pre-operatively, another patient had typical radiological changes of COVID on staging CT but consecutive negative swabs. Both patients were postponed for 4 weeks then achieved 2 negative swab results and resolution of CT changes. Trainees were involved in the majority of operations on both sites minimising the impact on training.

STUDY QUESTION Should there be a prioritization of access to the vaccine based on ethical and objective criteria or should the access be done at random? STUDY DESIGN To determine the ethics and reality of rationing the accessibility to anti-COVID vaccine according to the official strategies. DATA SOURCES The study is based on the consultation of (1) scientific articles from international databases (Google Scholar, PubMed, ProQuest, and Clarivate), (2) public health documents, and (3) official information of various governments. RESULTS The analyzed documents revealed that a few similarities can be observed in European countries when it comes to the first categories of people who have received the vaccine: people living in care facilities and medical staff; it can also be seen that the vaccination plan was adopted by each country for the needs and characteristics of its population, the prioritization being done in 2-14 stages; some of them divided, in their turn, into subsequent substages. Most of the states subject to the analysis assigned the medical staff in the first stage, followed by those in the sectors ensuring the maintenance of essential services, afterward by the elderly or people with comorbidities, only later to expand to other social categories. CONCLUSIONS Prioritization of vaccine administration is not only necessary, unavoidable, but also problematic both ethically and logistically, which should involve leaders in the field of public health, but also medical staff, regardless of their specialization. Prioritization of vaccination can not only have an impact on individual health (physical and emotional) but also on society from public health, economic, and sociocultural point of view.","Rogozea, Liliana M; Sechel, Gabriela; Bularca, Maria C; Coman, Claudiu; Cocuz, Maria E",American journal of therapeutics,384,17

Strengthening national preparedness requires National Public Health Institutes (NPHIs), or their equivalent, to overcome practical challenges affecting timely access to, and use of, data that is critical to preparedness. Our situational analysis in collaboration with NPHIs in three countries—Ethiopia, Nigeria and Pakistan—characterises these challenges. Our findings indicate that NPHIs’ role necessitates collection and analysis of data from multiple sources that do not routinely share data with public health authorities. Since initiating requests for access to new data sources can be a lengthy process, it is essential that NPHIs are routinely monitoring a broad set of priority indicators that are selected to reflect the country-specific context. NPHIs must also have the authority to be able to request rapid sharing of data from public and private sector organisations during health emergencies and to access additional human and financial resources during disease outbreaks. Finally, timely, transparent and informative communication of synthesised data from NPHIs will facilitate sustained data sharing with NPHIs from external organisations. These actions identified by our analysis will support the availability of robust information systems that allow relevant data to be collected, shared and analysed by NPHIs sufficiently rapidly to inform a timely local response to infectious disease outbreaks in the future.","Khan, Mishal S; Dar, Osman; Erondu, Ngozi A; Rahman-Shepherd, Afifah; Hollmann, Lara; Ihekweazu, Chikwe; Ukandu, Okechukwu; Agogo, Emmanuel; Ikram, Aamer; Rathore, Tayyab Razi; Okereke, Ebere; Squires, Neil",BMJ Glob Health,384,20

All costs related to the trials are to be covered by GMC. Additionally, GMC has to develop and implement marketing and promotional programmes.[2] In May 2003, Hemispherx Biopharma and the Center for Cell and Gene Therapy entered into a research project agreement that will see Ampligen® implemented in a protocol used in patients with relapsed EBV-positive Hodgkin’s Lymphoma.[3] In March 2002, Esteve and Hemispherx Biopharma entered into a collaborative agreement under which Esteve will be the sole distributor of Ampligen® in Spain, Portugal and Andorra for the treatment of chronic fatigue syndrome. Under this agreement, in addition to other terms, Esteve will also collaborate in the drug product development by conducting clinical studies in Spain in patients coinfected with HIV/HCV. In July 2001 Hemispherx Biopharma announced that it had formed a strategic alliance with Empire Health Resources for clinical trials of Ampligen® in the treatment of HIV and hepatitis C virus infections. Empire Health Resources, a healthcare management firm, will be responsible for accrual and retention of patients for HIV trials, and protocols for trials in patients with hepatitis C or both HIV and hepatitis C infections. Hemispherx has entered into a collaboration with RED Laboratories, and RED Laboratories NV expects that this will facilitate the continued development of Ampligen®. Hemispherx has also entered into an agreement with Schering Plough to use a Schering facility as its principal manufacturing platform in the US. This agreement may be expanded to include other territories. Hemispherx and AOP Orphan Pharmaceuticals have signed a marketing agreement for Ampligen® for the treatment of chronic fatigue syndrome for Austria, the Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary. In an arrangement between Hemispherx and Bioclones, Bioclones has certain marketing rights for Ampligen® in the Southern Hemisphere, UK and Ireland. In the US, Ampligen® has been granted orphan drug status for the treatment of AIDS, renal cell carcinoma (phase II, completed), chronic fatigue syndrome (phase III) and invasive/metastatic malignant melanoma (phase II). In August 2004, Hemispherx announced that it intends to use the proceeds from the private placement of company stock to complete the clinical work for its immunotherapeutics/ antivirals Ampligen® and Oragens™. Previously, Hemispherx submitted an application to the EMEA for the approval of Ampligen® for the treatment of chronic fatigue syndrome; the first stage of the regulatory review has been cleared. In 2000, Hemispherx Europe (Hemispherx) obtained orphan drug status for Ampligen® for the treatment of chronic fatigue syndrome in the EU, providing Hemispherx with 10 years of marketing exclusivity following the launch of the drug, as well as potential financial research benefits for the agent. In February 2000, Crystaal Corporation (now Biovail Pharmaceuticals Canada) acquired exclusive marketing rights to Ampligen® in Canada, where it submitted an NDA for the agent for the treatment of chronic fatigue syndrome. In the meantime, Ampligen® has been available since May 1996 under the Canadian Emergency Drug Release Programme for the treatment of chronic fatigue syndrome and immune dysfunction syndrome by Rivex Pharma (Helix BioPharma). Bioclones has initiated clinical studies with Ampligen® for the treatment of chronic fatigue syndrome in Australia. The active substance for Ampligen® is manufactured by F.H. Faulding Ltd. Clinical treatment programmes for chronic fatigue syndrome in other Pacific Rim countries are planned. Ampligen® is available for severe chronic fatigue syndrome on a named patient, cost-recovery basis in South Africa. Hemispherx has developed a ‘ready-to-use’ liquid formulation of the drug and has begun treating patients with chronic fatigue syndrome in ongoing clinical trials. Hemispherx has also developed an oral version of the drug (Oragen®), which is undergoing preclinical evaluation. In February 2001, Hemispherx Biopharma announced that it was initiating phase II/III trials of Ampligen® in the treatment of late-stage, multidrug-resistant strains of HIV in the European Union. Patients treated in these studies will have exhausted all other treatment options. In July 2001, Hemispherx stated that Ampligen® was being evaluated in a phase IIb trial in patients with HIV in the US. The trial, comprising two studies, REARMI and REARMII (Research/Evaluation of Ampligen® for Retroviral Mutations I and II), will evaluate the ability of Ampligen® to prevent the emergence of mutated, drug-resistant strains of the virus. ‘Several hundred’ patients currently on antiretroviral therapy and at risk of viral relapse will be enrolled at centres in Connecticut, New York, Florida and California. A second phase IIb study evaluating the effect of Ampligen® on structured treatment interruptions (STI) is also underway. Final results from this study were reported in December 2002. NIH sponsored studies of potential therapies for SARS have identified Ampligen® as having unusually high and consistent antiviral activity against human coronavirus, the pathogen implicated as the causative agent of the disease. Ampligen® demonstrated very high potency at very low concentrations (0.4 μg/mL) and had a favourable safety profile.[4] In October 2003, Hemispherx announced that, based on these promsing new results, the company will stockpile injectible and/or oral formats of Ampligen® and Alferon N®.[5] Independent researchers have demonstrated the antiviral activity of Ampligen® against flaviviruses (West Nile virus, Equine Encephalitis virus, Dengue fever virus and Japanese Encephalitis virus) as well as virus classes associated with bioterrorism. In an animal study, Ampligen® was shown to prevent destruction of nerve cells, reduce virus concentrations in the brain and blood stream and increase survival rates.[6] Researchers at the Rega Institute in Belgium have published results from an animal study demonstrating that Ampligen® was superior at protecting mice against coxsackie B3 virus-induced myocarditis compared with pegylated interferon.[7] In May 2004 Hemispherx announced that it had filed an expanded US patent application covering the use of Ampligen® for the potential treatment and prevention of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and dreaded emerging viruses.",,Drugs R D,384,16

Recent mounting evidence suggests that KLKs also represent important regulators of viral infections. It is well-established that certain enveloped viruses, including influenza and coronaviruses, require proteolytic processing of their hemagglutinin or spike proteins, respectively, to infect host cells. Similarly, the capsid protein of the non-enveloped papillomavirus L1 should be proteolytically cleaved for viral uncoating. Consequently, extracellular or membrane-bound proteases of the host cells are instrumental for viral infections and represent potential targets for drug development. Here, we summarize how extracellular proteolysis mediated by the kallikreins is implicated in the process of influenza (and potentially coronavirus and papillomavirus) entry into host cells. Besides direct proteolytic activation of viruses, KLK5 and 12 promote viral entry indirectly through proteolytic cascade events, like the activation of thrombolytic enzymes that also can process hemagglutinin, while additional functions of KLKs in infection cannot be excluded. In the light of recent evidence, KLKs represent potential host targets for the development of new antivirals. Humanized animal models to validate their key functions in viral infections will be valuable.","Pampalakis, Georgios; Zingkou, Eleni; Panagiotidis, Christos; Sotiropoulou, Georgia",Cell Mol Life Sci,384,1

METHODS: Children <18 years were eligible for inclusion if they had a respiratory infection and a positive PCR-based assay for respiratory viruses as well as a positive blood culture from 2010 to 2018 at a single referral centre in the United States regardless of their underlying medical condition or antibiotic treatment history. Monthly incidence rates of respiratory viruses and bacteraemia were analysed with a seasonal-trend decomposition procedure based on loess (STL) and cross-correlation functions using time series regression modelling. RESULTS: We identified 7,415 unique positive respiratory virus tests, including 2,278 RSV (31%), 1,825 influenza viruses (24%), 1,036 parainfluenza viruses (14%), 1,017 hMPV (14%), 677 seasonal coronaviruses (9%), and 582 adenoviruses (8%), and a total of 11,827 episodes of bacteraemia. Significant co-seasonality was found between all-cause bacteraemia and RSV (OR=1.76, 95% CI 1.50-2.06, P<0.001), influenza viruses (OR=1.38, 95% CI 1.13-1.68, P=0.002), and seasonal coronaviruses (OR=1.18, 95% CI 1.09-1.28, P<0.001), respectively. Analysis of linked viral-bacterial infections in individual children indicated that the rate ratio (RR) of bacteraemia associated with hMPV (RR=2.73, 95% CI 1.12-6.85, P=0.019) and influenza (RR=2.61, 95% CI 1.21-6.11, P=0.013) were more than double that of RSV. Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae were the most commonly identified pathogens causing bacteraemia. CONCLUSIONS: There is a significant association between hMPV and influenza viruses, and bacteraemia of all causes in hospitalised children at a single paediatric centre in the United States. Large multicentre studies are needed to confirm these findings and to elucidate the mechanisms by which hMPV potentiates the virulence and invasive capacity of diverse bacteria.","Choe, Young June; Park, Sangshin; Michelow, Ian C.",Clin Microbiol Infect,384,20

No study has detailed the perceptions of these consultants. OBJECTIVES: To understand the experiences of remote volunteer palliative care consultants during the initial COVID-19 surge. METHODS: This qualitative study utilized a thematic analysis approach. During January and February 2021, we conducted one-on-one semi-structured interviews with 15 board-certified palliative care physicians who participated in the program. Codes and emerging themes were identified through iterative discussion and comparison. RESULTS: Five overarching themes (with sub-themes in parentheses) were identified: 1) motivations for participating in the program, 2) logistical evaluation of the program (integration, telehealth model, dyad structure and debriefing sessions), 3) barriers to delivery (language and cultural differences, culture of high-intensity care, legal and administrative differences), 4) emotional burden (moral distress, burnout), and 5) ideas for improvements. Notably, participants observed institutional and cultural differences that posed challenges to delivery of care. Many expressed feelings of distress related to the uncertainty and scarcity caused by the pandemic, although volunteering may have been protective against burnout. CONCLUSION: This study provides an in-depth look at the experiences of remote volunteer palliative care consultants during the initial COVID-19 surge from the unique perspectives of the consultants themselves. Participants expressed overall positive and meaningful experiences and felt that the model was appropriate given the circumstances. Additionally, participants provided recommendations that could guide future implementations of similar programs.","Tong, Wendy; Kapur, Supriya; Fleet, Alexa; Russo, Samantha; Khedagi, Apurva; Blinderman, Craig D.; Nakagawa, Shunichi",J Pain Symptom Manage,384,12

Addressing the unmet medical need for therapies has been hampered by a lack of suitable cell culture models to investigate the HBV life cycle in a single experimental setup. We sought to develop a platform suitable to investigate all aspects of the entire HBV life cycle. METHODS: HepG2-NTCPsec+ cells were inoculated with HBV. Supernatants of infected cells were transferred to naïve cells. Inhibition of infection was determined in primary and secondary infected cells by high-content imaging of viral and cellular factors. Novel antivirals were triaged in cells infected with cell culture- or patient-derived HBV and in stably virus replicating cells. HBV internalisation and target-based receptor binding assays were conducted. RESULTS: We developed an HBV platform, screened 2,102 drugs and bioactives, and identified 3 early and 38 late novel HBV life cycle inhibitors using infectious HBV genotype D. Two early inhibitors, pranlukast (EC(50) 4.3 μM; 50% cytotoxic concentration [CC(50)] >50 μM) and cytochalasin D (EC(50) 0.07 μM; CC(50) >50 μM), and 2 late inhibitors, fludarabine (EC(50) 0.1 μM; CC(50) 13.4 μM) and dexmedetomidine (EC(50) 6.2 μM; CC(50) >50 μM), were further investigated. Pranlukast inhibited HBV preS1 binding, whereas cytochalasin D prevented the internalisation of HBV. Fludarabine inhibited the secretion of HBV progeny DNA, whereas dexmedetomidine interfered with the infectivity of HBV progeny. Patient-derived HBV genotype C was efficiently inhibited by fludarabine (EC(50) 0.08 μM) and dexmedetomidine (EC(50) 8.7 μM). CONCLUSIONS: The newly developed high-content assay is suitable to screen large-scale drug libraries, enables monitoring of the entire HBV life cycle, and discriminates between inhibition of early and late viral life cycle events. LAY SUMMARY: HBV infection is an incurable, chronic disease with few available treatments. Addressing this unmet medical need has been hampered by a lack of suitable cell culture models to study the entire viral life cycle in a single experimental setup. We developed an image-based approach suitable to screen large numbers of drugs, using a cell line that can be infected by HBV and produces large amounts of virus particles. By transferring viral supernatants from these infected cells to uninfected target cells, we could monitor the entire viral life cycle. We used this system to screen drug libraries and identified novel anti-HBV inhibitors that potently inhibit HBV in various phases of its life cycle. This assay will be an important new tool to study the HBV life cycle and accelerate the development of novel therapeutic strategies.","Yang, Jaewon; König, Alexander; Park, Soonju; Jo, Eunji; Sung, Pil Soo; Yoon, Seung Kew; Zusinaite, Eva; Kainov, Denis; Shum, David; Windisch, Marc Peter",JHEP Rep,384,16

Methods: Fifty-four non-demented PD patients who were supposed to attend the outpatient March clinic were recruited for a prospective study. All patients had a known UPDRS-III and a modified Hoehn and Yahr (H&Y) score and were provided with a smartphone application capable of providing indicators of gait, tapping, tremor, memory and executive functions. Different questionnaires exploring non-motor symptoms and quality of life were administered through phone-calls. Patients were asked to run the app at least twice per week (i.e., full compliance). Subjects were phone-checked weekly throughout a 3-week period for compliance and final satisfaction questionnaires. Results: Forty-five patients (83.3%) ran the app at least once; Twenty-nine (53.7%) subjects were half-compliant, while 16 (29.6%) were fully compliant. Adherence was hindered by technical issues or digital illiteracy (38.7%), demotivation (24%) and health-related issues (7.4%). Ten patients (18.5%) underwent PD therapy changes. The main factors related to lack of compliance included loss of interest, sadness, anxiety, the absence of a caregiver, the presence of falls and higher H&Y. Gait, tapping, tremor and cognitive application outcomes were correlated to disease duration, UPDRS-III and H&Y. Discussion: The majority of patients were compliant and satisfied by the provided monitoring program. Some of the application outcomes were statistically correlated to clinical parameters, but further validation is required.

In this interdisciplinary Viewpoint, we describe literature from a variety of domains that highlight how social deprivation in adolescence might have far-reaching consequences. Human studies have shown the importance of peer acceptance and peer influence in adolescence. Animal research has shown that social deprivation and isolation have unique effects on brain and behaviour in adolescence compared with other stages of life. However, the decrease in adolescent face-to-face contact might be less detrimental due to widespread access to digital forms of social interaction through technologies such as social media.

Most medical students had distance learning as their main content delivery mode, but in clerkship (fifth and sixth years), in-person activities were maintained under new protocols. These different modes may have affected student mental health. This study examines mental burden and empathy in medical students during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic according to the year of attendance. METHODS: All students attending first to the sixth year in the same medical school were invited to participate. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), the Self-Reporting Questionnaire (SRQ-20), the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI), and the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS) were provided. RESULTS: HADS scores for Anxiety and Depression (n=347) were 9.8±4.3 and 7.1±3.6, respectively; the SRQ-20 (n=373) score was 8.1±4.5; all scores were negatively correlated with the year of attendance. IRI (n=373) scores were: 2.6±0.5 (Empathic Concern), 2.7±0.7 (Perspective Taking), 2.5±0.9 (Fantasy), and 1.7±0.7 (Personal Distress). Fantasy was negatively correlated with the year of attendance. MAAS scores were positively correlated with the year of attendance. Worse mental health scores were found for first-year students across all scales. CONCLUSIONS: We found high levels of mental burden in medical students in the early period of the COVID-19 pandemic, especially in first-year students, who may have fewer resources to deal with stress. Moreover, as they entered college a short time before the pandemic, they were unable to experience academic life fully or create important new social support networks to deal with adversities.","Perissotto, Thais; da Silva, Thamires Clair Rodrigues Pereira; Miskulin, Fabricio Petermann Choueiri; Pereira, Mariana Berwerth; Neves, Beatriz Astolfi; Almeida, Beatriz Cantieri; Casagrande, Amanda Victoria; Ribeiz, Salma Rose Imanari; Nunes, Paula Villela",Clinics (Sao Paulo),384,8

Therefore, the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection during gestational ages might be detrimental and the potential vertical transmission should be thoroughly studied. Herein, we investigated whether SARS-CoV-2 vertical transmission is possible and, in case, whether this results in a fetal involvement. Additionally, we analyzed the role of the antibody and the inflammatory responses in placenta and plasma from SARS-CoV-2-positive pregnant women and fetuses. 31 SARS-CoV-2 pregnant women were enrolled. Real-time PCR was performed to detect the virus on maternal and newborns nasopharyngeal swabs, vaginal swabs, maternal and umbilical cord plasma, placenta and umbilical cord biopsies, amniotic fluids and milk. Maternal and umbilical cord plasma, and milk were tested for specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. RNA expression quantification of genes involved in the inflammatory response was performed on four selected placentas. On maternal and umbilical cord plasma of the same subjects, secreted cytokines/chemokines were quantified. SARS-CoV-2 is found in at-term placentae and in the umbilical cord blood, in the vaginal mucosa of pregnant women and in milk. Furthermore, we report the presence of specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies in the umbilical cord blood of pregnant women, as well as in milk specimens. Finally, a specific inflammatory response is triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnant women at both systemic and placental level, and in umbilical cord blood plasma. Our data strongly support the hypothesis that in-utero vertical transmission is possible in SARS-CoV-2 positive pregnant women.

Increase in SARS-CoV-2 genetic loading in the wastewater between 8 and 27 May 2020 samples concurred with corresponding increase in the number of active COVID-19 patients in the city. The number of gene copies was comparable to that reported in untreated wastewaters of Australia, China and Turkey and lower than that of the USA, France and Spain. However, temporal changes in SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations need to be substantiated further from the perspectives of daily and short-term changes of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater through long-term monitoring. The study results SARS-CoV-2 will assist concerned authorities and policymakers to formulate and/or upgrade COVID-19 surveillance to have a more explicit picture of the pandemic curve. While infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 through the excreted viral genetic material in the aquatic environment is still being debated, the presence and detection of genes in wastewater systems makes a strong case for the environmental surveillance of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Kumar, Manish; Patel, Arbind Kumar; Shah, Anil V.; Raval, Janvi; Rajpara, Neha; Joshi, Madhvi; Joshi, Chaitanya G.",Sci Total Environ,384,16

However, the vertical transmission of COVID-19 is uncertain. OBJECTIVES: This is a systematic review of published studies concerning pregnant women with confirmed COVID-19 and their neonates. SEARCH STRATEGY: We carried out a systematic search in multiple databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, Google Scholar, Scopus, and WHO COVID-19 database using the following keywords: (Coronavirus) OR (novel coronavirus) OR (COVID-19) OR (COVID19) OR (COVID 19) OR (SARS-CoV2) OR (2019-nCoV)) and ((pregnancy) OR (pregnant) OR (vertical transmission) OR (neonate) OR (newborn) OR (placenta) OR (fetus) OR (Fetal)). The search took place in April 2020. SELECTION CRITERIA: Original articles published in English were eligible if they included pregnant patients infected with COVID-19 and their newborns. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSES: The outcomes of interest consisted of clinical manifestations of COVID-19 in pregnant patients with COVID-19 and also the effect of COVID-19 on neonatal and pregnancy outcomes. MAIN RESULTS: 37 articles involving 364 pregnant women with COVID-19 and 302 neonates were included. The vast majority of pregnant patients were in their third trimester of pregnancy, and only 45 cases were in the first or second trimester (12.4%). Most mothers described mild to moderate manifestations of COVID-19. Of 364 pregnant women, 25 were asymptomatic at the time of admission. The most common symptoms were fever (62.4%) and cough (45.3%). Two maternal deaths occurred. Some pregnant patients (12.1%) had a negative SARS‐CoV‐2 test but displayed clinical manifestations and abnormalities in computed tomography (CT) scan related to COVID‐19. Twenty‐two (6.0%) pregnant patients developed severe pneumonia. Two maternal deaths occurred from severe pneumonia and multiple organ dysfunction. Studies included a total of 302 neonates from mothers with COVID‐19. Of the studies that provided data on the timing of birth, there were 65 (23.6%) preterm neonates. One baby was born dead from a mother who also died from COVID-19. Of the babies born alive from mothers with COVID‐19, five newborns faced critical conditions, and two later died. A total of 219 neonates underwent nasopharyngeal specimen collection for SARS‐CoV‐2, of which 11 tested positive (5%). Seventeen studies examined samples of the placenta, breast milk, umbilical cord, and amniotic fluid, and all tested negative except one amniotic fluid sample. CONCLUSIONS: A systematic review of published studies confirm that the course of COVID-19 in pregnant women resembles that of other populations. However, there is not sufficient evidence to establish an idea that COVID-19 would not complicate pregnancy.","Mirbeyk, Mona; Saghazadeh, Amene; Rezaei, Nima",Arch Gynecol Obstet,384,13

These studies were primarily single center observational studies conducted within the first few weeks or months of the pandemic. We sought to examine trends in COVID-19 morbidity, hospitalization, and mortality over time for minority and rural populations, especially during the U.S. fall surge. METHODS: Data were extracted from a statewide cohort of all adult residents in Indiana tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection between March 1 and December 31, 2020, linked to electronic health records. Primary measures were per capita rates of infection, hospitalization, and death. Age adjusted rates were calculated for multiple time periods corresponding to public health mitigation efforts. Comparisons across time within groups were compared using ANOVA. RESULTS: Morbidity and mortality increased over time with notable differences among sub-populations. Initially, hospitalization rates among racial minorities were 3–4 times higher than whites, and mortality rates among urban residents were twice those of rural residents. By fall 2020, hospitalization and mortality rates in rural areas surpassed those of urban areas, and gaps between black/brown and white populations narrowed. Changes across time among demographic groups was significant for morbidity and hospitalization. Cumulative morbidity and mortality were highest among minority groups and in rural communities. CONCLUSIONS: The synchronicity of disparities in COVID-19 by race and geography suggests that health officials should explicitly measure disparities and adjust mitigation as well as vaccination strategies to protect those sub-populations with greater disease burden.","Dixon, Brian E.; Grannis, Shaun J.; Lembcke, Lauren R.; Valvi, Nimish; Roberts, Anna R.; Embi, Peter J.",PLoS One,384,1

Differences in the composition of the intestinal microbiota have been demonstrated when constipated patients and healthy controls have been compared. Growing evidence indicates that alterations of intestinal microbiota may contribute to constipation and constipation-related symptoms. The intestinal microbiota is a collection of microorganisms that live within the gastrointestinal tract, and perform many important health-promoting functions. The intestinal microbiota aids in the breakdown of food products into absorbable nutrients, stimulates the host immune system, prevents growth of pathogenic bacteria and produces a great variety of biologically important compounds. In this review, we will summarize the current evidence supporting roles of the intestinal microbiota in the pathogenesis and management of chronic constipation. The discussion will shed light on the novel mechanisms of intestinal microbiota and gut function interactions, which is invaluable in ultimately developing new therapeutic tools for the treatment of chronic constipation.","Zhao, Ying; Yu, Yan-Bo",Springerplus,384,20

However, its pharmacokinetic profile remains largely undefined. Here, Sprague Dawley rats were administered a single dose of GRFT at 10 or 20 mg/kg by intravenous, oral, and subcutaneous routes, respectively, and serum GRFT levels were measured at select time points. In addition, the potential for systemic accumulation after oral dosing was assessed in rats after 10 daily treatments with GRFT (20 or 40 mg/kg). We found that parenterally-administered GRFT in rats displayed a complex elimination profile, which varied according to administration routes. However, GRFT was not orally bioavailable, even after chronic treatment. Nonetheless, active GRFT capable of neutralizing HIV-Env pseudoviruses was detected in rat fecal extracts after chronic oral dosing. These findings support further evaluation of GRFT for pre-exposure prophylaxis against emerging epidemics for which specific therapeutics are not available, including systemic and enteric infections caused by susceptible enveloped viruses. In addition, GRFT should be considered for antiviral therapy and the prevention of rectal transmission of HIV-1 and other susceptible viruses.","Barton, Christopher; Kouokam, J.

COVID‐19 can fuse their envelopes with the host cell membranes and deliver their genetic material. COVID‐19 attacks the respiratory system and stimulates the host inflammatory responses, enhances the recruitment of immune cells, and promotes angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 activities. Patients with confirmed COVID‐19 may have experienced fever, dry cough, headache, dyspnea, acute kidney injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and acute heart injury. Several strategies such as oxygen therapy, ventilation, antibiotic or antiviral therapy, and renal replacement therapy are commonly used to decrease COVID‐19‐associated mortality. However, these approaches may not be good treatment options. Therefore, the search for an alternative‐novel therapy is urgently important to prevent the disease progression. Recently, microRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as a promising strategy for COVID‐19. The design of oligonucleotide against the genetic material of COVID‐19 might suppress virus RNA translation. Several previous studies have shown that host miRNAs play an antiviral role and improve the treatment of patients with COVID‐19. miRNAs by binding to the 3′‐untranslated region (UTR) or 5′‐UTR of viral RNA play an important role in COVID‐19‐host interplay and viral replication. miRNAs interact with multiple pathways and reduce inflammatory biomarkers, thrombi formation, and tissue damage to accelerate the patient outcome. The information in this review provides a summary of the current clinical application of miRNAs for the treatments of patients with COVID‐19.","Ying, Hao; Ebrahimi, Mohsen; Keivan, Mona; Khoshnam, Seyed Esmaeil; Salahi, Sarvenaz; Farzaneh, Maryam",Cell Biol Int,384,16

However, current knowledge on the prognosis of respiratory virus-related pneumonia (RV-p) is limited. Thus, here we aimed to establish a clinical predictive model for mortality of patients with RV-p. METHODS: A total of 1431 laboratory-confirmed patients with RV-p, including 1169 and 262 patients from respective derivation and validation cohorts from five teaching hospitals in China were assessed between January 2010 and December 2019. A prediction rule was established on the basis of risk factors for 30-day mortality of patients with RV-p from the derivation cohort using a multivariate logistic regression model. RESULTS: The 30-day mortality of patients with RV-p was 16.8% (241/1431). The RV-p score was composed of nine predictors (including respective points of mortality risk): (a) age ⩾65 years (1 point); (b) chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (1 point); (c) mental confusion (1 point); (d) blood urea nitrogen (1 point); (e) cardiovascular disease (2 points); (f) smoking history (2 points); (g) arterial pressure of oxygen/fraction of inspiration oxygen (P(a)O(2)/FiO(2)) < 250 mmHg (2 points); (h) lymphocyte counts <0.8 × 10(9)/L (2 points); (i) arterial PH < 7.35 (3 points). A total of six points was used as the cut-off value for mortality risk stratification. Our model showed a sensitivity of 0.831 and a specificity of 0.783. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was more prominent for RV-p scoring [0.867, 95% confidence interval (CI)0.846–0.886] when compared with both pneumonia severity index risk (0.595, 95% CI 0.566–0.624, p < 0.001) and CURB-65 scoring (0.739, 95% CI 0.713–0.765, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: RV-p scoring was able to provide a good predictive accuracy for 30-day mortality, which accounted for a more effective stratification of patients with RV-p into relevant risk categories and, consequently, help physicians to make more rational clinical decisions.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The evaluations in this retrospective cross-sectional study are based on the IMS RPM (Regional Pharmaceutical Market) weekly database, which shows weekly purchases by public pharmacies from full-service wholesalers at the time the pharmacy purchase is made in Germany. The outcome of this investigation was the development of cardiovascular drug sales by packing unit over all 52 weeks of 2020. RESULTS: We found an increase of 68% in week 12 compared to the average sales for weeks 2 - 11, 2020 (vs. -2% in week 12, 2019), while the increase in week 51 was 61%, compared to the average sales for weeks 13 - 50, 2020 (vs. 35% in week 51, 2019). The largest increases in week 12 were for calcium channel blockers (64%), and the largest increases in week 51 were for lipid-lowering drugs (67%). CONCLUSION: The results of this retrospective cross-sectional study suggest that the COVID-19 lockdown in Germany was associated with a significant surge in pharmacy purchases of cardiovascular drugs, indicating panic buying. Although there were no drug shortages during the first lockdown, this panic buying recurred shortly before the second lockdown, albeit to a lesser extent.","Luedde, Mark; Loosen, Sven; Konrad, Marcel; Tanislav, Christian; Roderburg, Christoph; Kostev, Karel",Int J Clin Pharmacol Ther,384,5

All patients with respiratory disease for whom bronchoalveolar lavage was performed were screened by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for the presence of all 4 HCoVs. Results. HCoV was identified in 29 (5.4%) of 540 bronchoalveolar lavage fluid specimens from 279 subjects (mean age, 51 years; 63% male). HCoV OC43 was identified most frequently (12 isolates), followed by 229E (7 isolates), NL63 (6 isolates), and HKU1 (4 isolates). In all, 372 (69%) of 540 bronchoalveolar lavage fluid specimens were negative for bacteria, and 2 persons were coinfected with other respiratory viruses. Transplantation was the most common underlying condition. Of the 29 patients who had HCoV identified in their bronchoalveolar lavage fluid specimens, 9 (31%) were hospitalized in the intensive care unit, 22 (76%) presented to the hospital with acute respiratory symptoms, 16 (55%) presented with cough and/or sputum, 13 (45%) presented with dyspnea, 16 (55%) had experienced prior respiratory infection, and 18 (62%) had a new infiltrate that was visible on chest radiograph. The most frequent final diagnosis was a lower respiratory tract infection. Conclusions. The recently discovered HCoVs NL63 and HKU1 contribute significantly to the overall spectrum of coronavirus infection. Our study also suggests that coronaviruses contribute to respiratory symptoms in most cases.","Garbino, Jorge; Crespo, Sophie; Aubert, J.-D.; Rochat, Thierry; Ninet, Beatrice; Deffernez, Christelle; Wunderli, Werner; Pache, Jean-Claude; Soccal, Paola M.; Kaiser, Laurent",Clin Infect Dis,384,1

METHODS: Our case series consisted of 13 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. RESULTS: At the time of clinical recovery, FEV1 (2.07 ± 0.72 L) and FVC (2.25 ± 0.86 L) were lower compared to lower limit of normality (LLN) values (2.56 ± 0.53 L, p = 0.004, and 3.31 ± 0.65 L, p < 0.001, respectively), while FEV1/FVC (0.94 ± 0.07) was higher compared to upper limit of normality (ULN) values (0.89 ± 0.01, p = 0.029). After 6 weeks pulmonary function improved but FVC was still lower than ULN (2.87 ± 0.81, p = 0.014).

We evaluated two automated molecular test systems for the detection of SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA in pooled specimens. METHODS: Pooled nasopharyngeal and saliva specimens were tested by Qiagen QIAstat‐Dx Respiratory SARS‐CoV‐2 Panel (QIAstat) or Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS‐CoV‐2 (Xpert), and the results were compared to that of standard RT‐qPCR tests without pooling. RESULTS: In nasopharyngeal specimens, the sensitivity/specificity of the pool testing approach, with 5 and 10 specimens per pool, were 77%/100% (n = 105) and 74.1%/100% (n = 260) by QIAstat, and 97.1%/100% (n = 250) and 100%/99.5% (n = 200) by Xpert, respectively. Pool testing of saliva (10 specimens per pool; n = 150) by Xpert resulted in 87.5% sensitivity and 99.3% specificity compared to individual tests. Pool size of 5 or 10 specimens did not significantly affect the difference of RT‐qPCR cycle threshold (C(T)) from standard testing. RT‐qPCR C(T) values obtained with pool testing by both QIAstat and Xpert were positively correlated with that of individual testing (Pearson's correlation coefficient r = 0.85 to 0.99, p < 0.05). However, the C(T) values from Xpert were significantly stronger (p < 0.01, paired t test) than that of QIAstat in a subset of SARS‐CoV‐2 positive specimens, with mean differences of −4.3 ± 2.43 and −4.6 ± 2 for individual and pooled tests, respectively. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that Xpert SARS‐CoV‐2 can be utilized for pooled sample testing for COVID‐19 screening in low‐prevalence settings providing significant cost savings and improving throughput without affecting test quality.","Al‐Hail, Hamad; Mirza, Faheem; Al Hashemi, Alaa; Ahmad, Muneera Naseer; Iqbal, Muhammad; Tang, Patrick; Hasan, Mohammad Rubayet",J Clin Lab Anal,384,8

Despite many promising ongoing progress, there are currently no FDA approved drug to treat infected patients. Recently, the crowdsourcing of drug discovery for inhibiting the main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2 have yielded a plenty of drug fragments resolved inside the active site of Mpro via the crystallography method. Following the principle of fragment-based drug design (FBDD), we are motivated to design a potent drug candidate (named B19) by merging three fragments JFM, U0P and HWH. Through extensive all-atom molecular dynamics simulation and molecular docking, we found that B19 among all designed ones is most stable inside the Mpro's active site and the binding free energy of B19 is comparable to or even a little better than that of a native protein ligand processed by Mpro. Our promising results suggest that B19 and its derivatives can potentially be efficacious drug candidates for COVID-19. This article is protected by copyright.

Methods: Between 10 to 30 April, 2020, 240 healthcare workers in Bolivia completed a cross-sectional online survey, which assessed their job satisfaction, life satisfaction, and turnover intention in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Results: The results revealed that their number of office days predicted job satisfaction, life satisfaction, and turnover intention, but the relationships varied by their age. For example, office days of healthcare workers negatively predicted job satisfaction for the young (e.g. at 25 years old: b=-0.21; 95% CI: -0.36 to -0.60) but positively predicted job satisfaction for the old (e.g. at 65 years old: b=0.25; 95% CI: 0.06 to 0.44).

Apart from the worry of contracting or spreading COVID-19, Malaysian university students were also locked down in campuses, suffering significant psychological distress. Hence, an online mindfulness intervention was proposed to alleviate psychological distress and improve psychological flexibility and mindfulness. METHODS The study was a quasi-experimental study, with university students as participants. Intervention group participants were instructed to fill up online questionnaires which included basic demographics, as well as instruments assessing depression, anxiety, stress, mindfulness, psychological flexibility and fear of COVID-19 before and after the one-hour intervention. The control group completed pre- and postquestionnaires then subsequently crossed over to the intervention group. Repeated measures ANOVA was performed to assess time*group effects. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION 118 participants were involved in this study. There was significant difference in terms of anxiety (F(1, 116) = 34.361, p<.001, partial eta-squared = .229) and psychological flexibility between these two groups ( F(1, 116) = 11.010, p = .001, partial eta-squared = .087), while depression, stress, mindfulness and fear of COVID-19 showed no difference. Results of this study corroborates the efficacy of online single session mindfulness therapy as a viable short-term psychological intervention amidst financial and time constraint. As university students are in the age group of highest incidences of depressive and anxiety disorders, it is crucial to utilize resources to address as many students as possible to ensure maximal benefit.","Pang, Nicholas Tze Ping; Tio, Vincent Chung Sheng; Bhupendar Singh, Amardeep Singh; Tseu, Mathias Wen Leh; Shoesmith, Wendy Diana; Abd Rahim, Muhammad Aklil; Mohd Kassim, Mohd Amiruddin",Trends in psychiatry and psychotherapy,384,20

STUDY DESIGN: Oro-nasopharyngeal swab and saliva samples were collected from all patients simultaneously in the early stage of COVID-19. Viral loads were determined by extracting viral RNAs from saliva samples of patients whose ONP swabs were positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR. The demographic information, comorbidities, cycle threshold values, and one-month clinical courses were recorded and compared. RESULTS: The patients' clinical course was evaluated for one month; 56 % of patients had mild disease, 26.4 % had moderate disease, 9.6 % had severe disease, and 8% had a critical/mortal disease. The average cycle threshold values of SARS-CoV-2 in saliva and ONP samples were measured as 22.28 and 24.19, respectively. Cycle threshold value of saliva was found to be significant in predicting disease severity (Eta coefficient 0.979). A statistically significant relationship was found between the disease's severity and the mean of ONP samples’ Ct-values (p < 0.05). Gender, age, body mass index, and co-morbidities were compared with the severity of the disease; no statistically significant difference was found. CONCLUSION: Viral load detected in saliva in the early period of COVID-19 infection may have a prognostic value in showing the disease's course in patients over 45-year-old.

However, the rate of uptake of the HPV vaccine is estimated at 51% in 2018, which leaves young people vulnerable to morbidity and mortality from preventable, HPV-related cancers. Reasons for this are multifactorial and include factors at the level of the provider, primary care practice, patient and family, and community. The development of interventions that are responsive to these multifactorial barriers in real-world settings is a priority. Boot Camp Translation (BCT) is a community-engaged approach to message development for translating evidence-based practices into clinics and communities. This project aims to (1) Engage practices and communities in the development of interventions to promote HPV vaccine uptake and (2) Evaluate the impact of the BCT-designed intervention on practice-level HPV vaccine initiation rates. We hypothesise that the BCT-designed intervention will increase the rate of HPV vaccine initiation in the practices. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study will implement HPV-focused BCT in three counties in Colorado with a below average county-level vaccination rate. Each BCT group will design a multipronged intervention targeted at patients, parents, providers and the general community to then be disseminated in the participating practices and communities over the subsequent 6-month period. The long-term goal is to develop a replicable approach and low-cost method of increasing HPV vaccine uptake that is easily adaptable to different settings and sociodemographic contexts. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study is approved by the Colorado Multiple Institutional Review Board. Results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed manuscripts and conference presentations, as well as within Colorado practice-based research networks.

Some of these TLR4 polymorphisms are racially specific. We hypothesised that feline TLR4 polymorphisms might underlie an observed increased risk to infectious and inflammatory diseases in some cat breeds. The aim of this study was to identify breed-specific variations in the coding region of feline TLR4 and to model the effect of mutations on protein structure and function in silico. The entire coding region of TLR4 was sequenced in 8 groups (7 pure-bred, 1 crossbred) of domestic cats (Felis catus) comprising 158 individuals. Twenty-two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified in TLR4, with 16 located in the coding region (11 non-synonymous) and four in the 3′UTR. Comparison of breed specific allelic frequencies indicated that Burmese and British shorthairs most commonly differed from other breeds. In silico analyses to predict the impact of the 11 non-synonymous variants indicated a deleterious effect on protein structure for one SNP (c.869 G > A), which was not associated with a specific breed. Overall, findings from this study do not support a role of TLR4 dysfunction in breed-predispositions to infectious diseases in domestic cats in Australia.","Whitney, J.; Haase, B.; Beatty, J.; Barrs, V.R.",Vet Immunol Immunopathol,384,21

METHODS: We combined individual level data from 13,888 COVID-19 patients (N=7,185 hospitalized) from 17 cohorts in nine countries to assess the association of the major common COVID-19 genetic risk factor (chromosome 3 locus tagged by rs10490770) with mortality, COVID-19-related complications and laboratory values. We next performed meta-analyses using FinnGen and the Columbia University COVID-19 Biobank. RESULTS: We found that rs10490770 risk allele carriers experienced an increased risk of all-cause mortality (HR 1.4, 95%CI 1.2-1.7). Risk allele carriers had increased odds of several COVID-19 complications: severe respiratory failure (OR 2.1, 95%CI 1.6-2.6), venous thromboembolism (OR 1.7, 95%CI 1.2-2.4), and hepatic injury (OR 1.5, 95%CI 1.2-2.0). Risk allele carriers ≤60 years had higher odds of death or severe respiratory failure (OR 2.7, 95%CI 1.8-3.9) compared to those >60 years (OR 1.5, 95%CI 1.2-1.8, interaction-p=0.038). Amongst individuals ≤60 years who died or experienced severe respiratory failure, 32.3% were risk variant carriers, compared to 13.9% of those not experiencing these outcomes. The genetic risk improved the prediction of death or severe respiratory failure similarly to, or better than, most established clinical risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: The major common COVID-19 genetic risk factor is associated with increased risks of morbidity and mortality, which are more pronounced amongst individuals ≤60 years. The effect was similar in magnitude and more common than most established clinical risk factors, suggesting potential implications for future clinical risk management.","Nakanishi, Tomoko; Pigazzini, Sara; Degenhardt, Frauke; Cordioli, Mattia; Butler-Laporte, Guillaume; Maya-Miles, Douglas; Bujanda, Luis; Bouysran, Youssef; Niemi, Mari Ek; Palom, Adriana; Ellinghaus, David; Khan, Atlas; Martínez-Bueno, Manuel; Rolker, Selina; Amitrano, Sara; Roade Tato, Luisa; Fava, Francesca; Spinner, Christoph D; Prati, Daniele; Bernardo, David; Garcia, Federico; Darcis, Gilles; Fernandez-Cadenas, Israel; Holter, Jan Cato; Banales, Jesus M; Frithiof, Robert; Kiryluk, Krzysztof; Duga, Stefano; Asselta, Rosanna; Pereira, Alexandre C; Romero-Gómez, Manuel; Nafría-Jiménez, Beatriz; Hov, Johannes R; Migeotte, Isabelle; Renieri, Alessandra; Planas, Anna M; Ludwig, Kerstin U; Buti, Maria; Rahmouni, Souad; Alarcón-Riquelme, Marta E; Schulte, Eva C; Franke, Andre; Karlsen, Tom H; Valenti, Luca; Zeberg, Hugo; Richards, J Brent; Ganna, Andrea",J. clin. invest,384,14

METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: A prospective cohort study was conducted in 87 COVID-19 confirmed cases who recovered and discharged from a medical school hospital in Thailand. At the follow-up visit on day 60 after onset of symptoms, patients underwent an evaluation by spirometry (FVC, FEV1, FEV1/FVC, FEF25-75, and PEF), a six-minute-walk test (6MWT), and a chest radiograph. RESULTS: There were 35 men and 52 women, with a mean age of 39.6±11.8 years and the mean body mass index (BMI) was 23.8±4.3 kg/m(2). Of all, 45 cases had mild symptoms; 35 had non-severe pneumonia, and 7 had severe pneumonia. Abnormality in spirometry was observed in 15 cases (17.2%), with 8% of restrictive defect and 9.2% of obstructive defect. Among the patients with an abnormal spirometry, the majority of the cases were in the severe pneumonia group (71.4%), compared with 15.6% in the non-severe pneumonia group, and 10.2% in the mild symptom group (p = 0.001). The mean six-minute-walk distance (6MWD) in the mild symptom and non-severe pneumonia groups was 538±56.8 and 527.5±53.5 meters, respectively. Although the severe pneumonia group tended to have a shorter mean 6-min walking distance, but this was not statistically significant (p = 0.118).

CONCLUSIONS: Abnormal spirometry was noted in 17.2% of COVID-19 survivors with both restrictive and obstructive defects. Severe COVID-19 pneumonia patients had higher prevalence rates of abnormal spirometry and residual fibrosis on the chest radiographs when compared to patients in the mild symptom and non-severe pneumonia groups.","Eksombatchai, Dararat; Wongsinin, Thananya; Phongnarudech, Thanyakamol; Thammavaranucupt, Kanin; Amornputtisathaporn, Naparat; Sungkanuparph, Somnuek",PLoS One,384,9

It has had a major impact on orthopaedic training. The independent sector has been proposed as a facility for future training. Our aim was to provide an overview of the current higher surgical trainees' experience in the independent sector. METHOD: Training orthopaedic registrars within the East of England deanery were asked to complete an electronic questionnaire of their training experience in the independent sector between 5th November to 2nd December 2020. RESULTS: 57 of 64 registrars (89%) from across all thirteen regional training hospitals responded. 44% attended the independent sector, but 7 only assisted (28%). No third year trainees went, but there was an even spread of other training years attending a mean of four sessions. Sixty-six indicative procedures were performed, all with supervisors scrubbed. Second year trainees performed the most cases with 4 on average. Completion of work based assessments was low. 20% trainees reported a negative experience. 80% enjoyed themselves. 52% felt they achieved their goals. 29% trainees felt that independent sector operating would compensate for the shortfall in training brought about by COVID-19. The main obstacles to independent sector training were lack of access and opportunity (51%) and poor induction and paperwork issues (22%) CONCLUSION: This is the first deanery-wide assessment of access to and training within the independent sector due to COVID-19. Independent sector operating for orthopaedic trainees is feasible on scale and should be embedded to supplement training in the future. In their current state independent sector facilities are not easily and universally accessible to fulfil training needs.","Lenihan, Jonathan; Ngu, Albert Wee Tun",Surg. (Edinb.),384,29

From the beginning of infection, patients will progress through different symptom stages, such as fever, dyspnea or even death. Identifying disease progression and predicting patient outcome at an early stage helps target treatment and resource allocation. However, there is no clear COVID-19 stage definition, and few studies have addressed characterizing COVID-19 progression, making the need for this study evident. METHODS: We proposed a temporal deep learning method, based on a time-aware long short-term memory (T-LSTM) neural network and used an online open dataset, including blood samples of 485 patients from Wuhan, China, to train the model. Our method can grasp the dynamic relations in irregularly sampled time series, which is ignored by existing works. Specifically, our method predicted the outcome of COVID-19 patients by considering both the biomarkers and the irregular time intervals. Then, we used the patient representations, extracted from T-LSTM units, to subtype the patient stages and describe the disease progression of COVID-19. RESULTS: Using our method, the accuracy of the outcome of prediction results was more than 90% at 12 days and 98, 95 and 93% at 3, 6, and 9 days, respectively. Most importantly, we found 4 stages of COVID-19 progression with different patient statuses and mortality risks. We ranked 40 biomarkers related to disease and gave the reference values of them for each stage. Top 5 is Lymph, LDH, hs-CRP, Indirect Bilirubin, Creatinine. Besides, we have found 3 complications - myocardial injury, liver function injury and renal function injury. Predicting which of the 4 stages the patient is currently in can help doctors better assess and cure the patient. CONCLUSIONS: To combat the COVID-19 epidemic, this paper aims to help clinicians better assess and treat infected patients, provide relevant researchers with potential disease progression patterns, and enable more effective use of medical resources. Our method predicted patient outcomes with high accuracy and identified a four-stage disease progression. We hope that the obtained results and patterns will aid in fighting the disease.","Sun, Chenxi; Hong, Shenda; Song, Moxian; Li, Hongyan; Wang, Zhenjie",BMC Med Inform Decis Mak,384,27

Bariatric surgery is an effective treatment for severe and complex obesity resulting in significant and sustained weight loss. In Sweden, most bariatric surgery patients are referred by primary care physicians. We aimed to explore barriers for physicians to refer patients with severe and complex obesity for bariatric surgery. METHODS: A questionnaire survey was in 2019 emailed to 1100 primary care physicians in the Skåne and Kronoberg regions in south Sweden. The survey focused on referral patterns, knowledge and attitudes towards bariatric surgery and concerns about postoperative complications. We created different statistical indices for referral patterns, knowledge, attitudes and concerns about bariatric surgery. To analyze the correlation between these indices, we did Spearman’s correlations and regression analyses. RESULTS: Of 1100 email respondents, we received 157 (14%) completed surveys. Among 157 physician respondents, 73% answered that they had good knowledge about the referral criteria for bariatric surgery, whereas 55 and 60% answered correctly to two items on criteria for bariatric surgery. A majority of respondents (84%) stated that their patients initiated referral to bariatric surgery. Half of the respondents had concerns about postoperative medical and surgical complications, but another half had a positive attitude to bariatric surgery as a treatment for obesity comorbidities. Almost half of the respondents (44%) answered that they needed to learn more about bariatric surgery. We found significant positive correlations between high knowledge and referral patterns (r = 0.292, p < 0.001) and positive attitudes (r = 0.235, p < 0.001) respectively. We found significant reverse correlations between concerns and referral patterns (r = − 0.355, p < 0.001) and between positive attitudes and concerns (r = − 0.294, p < 0.001). In logistic regression high levels of concerns explained low willingness to refer for bariatric surgery (Odds Ratio 0.2, 95% confidence interval 0.1–0.7). CONCLUSION: According to this Swedish survey among primary care physicians, high levels of concerns about bariatric surgery among physicians seemed to be a barrier to refer patients with severe and complex obesity for bariatric surgery. Since high knowledge about obesity and bariatric surgery correlated negatively to concerns and positively to favorable attitudes to bariatric surgery, more knowledge about obesity and bariatric surgery is warranted.

METHODS: Published and preprint randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effects of IVM on adult patients with COVID-19 were searched until 22 March 2021 in 5 engines. Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality rate, length of hospital stay (LOS), and adverse events (AEs). Secondary outcomes included viral clearance and severe AEs (SAEs). The risk of bias (RoB) was evaluated using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool. Inverse variance random effect meta-analyses were performed, with quality of evidence (QoE) evaluated using GRADE methods. RESULTS: Ten RCTs (n = 1173) were included. The controls were the standard of care in 5 RCTs and placebo in 5. COVID-19 disease severity was mild in 8 RCTs, moderate in 1, and mild and moderate in 1. IVM did not reduce all-cause mortality rates compared with controls (relative risk [RR], 0.37 [95% confidence interval, .12–1.13]; very low QoE) or LOS compared with controls (mean difference, 0.72 days [95% confidence interval, −.86 to 2.29 days]; very low QoE). AEs, SAEs, and viral clearance were similar between IVM and control groups (low QoE for all outcomes). Subgroups by severity of COVID-19 or RoB were mostly consistent with main analyses; all-cause mortality rates in 3 RCTs at high RoB were reduced with IVM. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with the standard of care or placebo, IVM did not reduce all-cause mortality, LOS, or viral clearance in RCTs in patients with mostly mild COVID-19. IVM did not have an effect on AEs or SAEs and is not a viable option to treat patients with COVID-19.","Roman, Yuani M; Burela, Paula Alejandra; Pasupuleti, Vinay; Piscoya, Alejandro; Vidal, Jose E; Hernandez, Adrian V",Clin Infect Dis,384,24

A serologic study was conducted to determine the asymptomatic MERS infection rate in healthcare workers and non-healthcare workers by exposure status. METHODS: Study participants were selected from contacts of MERS patients based on a priority system in 4 regions strongly affected by the 2015 MERS outbreak. A sero-epidemiological survey was performed in 1,610 contacts (average duration from exposure to test, 4.8 months), and the collected sera were tested using an enzyme-linked immunespecific assay (ELISA), immunofluorescence assay (IFA), and plaque reduction neutralization antibody test (PRNT). Among the 1,610 contacts, there were 7 ELISA-positive cases, of which 1 exhibited positive IFA and PRNT results. RESULTS: The asymptomatic infection rate was 0.060% (95% confidence interval, 0.002 to 0.346). The asymptomatic MERS case was a patient who had been hospitalized with patient zero on the same floor of the hospital at the same time. The case was quarantined at home for 2 weeks after discharge, and had underlying diseases, including hypertension, angina, and degenerative arthritis. CONCLUSIONS: The asymptomatic infection was acquired via healthcare-associated transmission.

Like severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), which emerged in 2002 and caused a similar disease, SARS-CoV-2 is a betacoronavirus. Both viruses use human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) as a receptor to enter cells. However, the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein has a novel insertion that generates a putative furin cleavage signal and this has been postulated to expand the host range. Two low-passage (P) strains of SARS-CoV-2 (Wash1 : P4 and Munich : P1) were cultured twice in Vero E6 cells and characterized virologically. Sanger and MinION sequencing demonstrated significant deletions in the furin cleavage signal of Wash1 : P6 and minor variants in the Munich : P3 strain. Cleavage of the S glycoprotein in SARS-CoV-2-infected Vero E6 cell lysates was inefficient even when an intact furin cleavage signal was present. Indirect immunofluorescence demonstrated that the S glycoprotein reached the cell surface. Since the S protein is a major antigenic target for the development of neutralizing antibodies, we investigated the development of neutralizing antibody titres in serial serum samples obtained from COVID-19 human patients. These were comparable regardless of the presence of an intact or deleted furin cleavage signal. These studies illustrate the need to characterize virus stocks meticulously prior to performing either in vitro or in vivo pathogenesis studies.","Klimstra, William B.; Tilston-Lunel, Natasha L.; Nambulli, Sham; Boslett, James; McMillen, Cynthia M.; Gilliland, Theron; Dunn, Matthew D.; Sun, Chengun; Wheeler, Sarah E.; Wells, Alan; Hartman, Amy L.; McElroy, Anita K.; Reed, Douglas S.; Rennick, Linda J.; Duprex, W.

The latest guidelines emphasize stratifying the patients in terms of CAT risks periodically. Multiple risk assessment models (RAMs) were developed to classify patients and guide thromboprophylaxis to high-risk patients. This study aimed to discuss and highlight different RAMs across various malignancy types with their related advantages and disadvantages. A scoping review was conducted using predefined search terms in three scientific databases, including Google Scholar, Science Direct, and PubMed. The search for studies was restricted to original research articles that reported risk assessment models published in the last thirteen years (between 2008 and 2021) to cover the most recently published evidence following the development of the principal risk assessment score in 2008. Data charting of the relevant trials, scores, advantages, and disadvantages were done iteratively considering the malignancy type. Of the initially identified 1115 studies, 39 studies with over 67,680 patients were included in the review. In solid organ malignancy, nine risk assessment scores were generated. The first and most known Khorana risk score still offers the best available risk assessment model when used for high-risk populations with a threshold of 2 and above. However, KRS has a limitation of failure to stratify low-risk patients. The COMPASS-CAT score showed the best performance in the lung carcinoma patients who have a higher prevalence of thrombosis than other malignancy subtypes. In testicular germ cell tumours, Bezan et al RAM is a validated good discriminatory RAM for this malignancy subtype. CAT in haematological malignancy seems to be under-investigated and has multiple disease-related, and treatment-related confounding factors. AL-Ani et al score performed efficiently in acute leukemia. In multiple myeloma, both SAVED and IMPEDED VTE scores showed good performance.

Most countermeasures proposed in the literature usually focus on additive noise-like manipulations such as JPEG compression, low-pass filtering and Gaussian additive noise, but few are resistant to challenging geometric deformations such as rotation and scaling. The main reason is that in the existing cover-lossless robust watermarking algorithms, those exploited robust features are related to the pixel position. In this article, we present a new cover-lossless robust image watermarking method by efficiently embedding a watermark into low-order Zernike moments and reversibly hiding the distortion due to the robust watermark as the compensation information for restoration of the cover image. The amplitude of the exploited low-order Zernike moments are: 1) mathematically invariant to scaling the size of an image and rotation with any angle;and 2) robust to interpolation errors during geometric transformations, and those common image processing operations. To reduce the compensation information, the robust watermarking process is elaborately and luminously designed by using the quantized error, the watermarked error and the rounded error to represent the difference between the original and the robust watermarked image. As a result, a cover-lossless robust watermarking system against geometric deformations is achieved with good performance. Experimental results show that the proposed robust watermarking method can effectively reduce the compensation information, and the new cover-lossless robust watermarking system provides strong robustness to those content-preserving manipulations including scaling, rotation, JPEG compression and other noise-like manipulations. In case of no attacks, the cover image can be recovered without any loss.","Hu, R.; Xiang, S.",IEEE Trans Image Process,384,15

However, it is important to emphasize that not all commercial video games are equal, and their effects strongly depend on specific characteristics of the games. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this systematic review was to describe the literature on the use of commercial off-the-shelf video games for diminishing stress and anxiety, examining the research outcomes along with critical variables related to computer game characteristics (ie, genre, platform, time of play). METHODS: A systematic search of the literature was performed following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis) guidelines. The search databases were PsycINFO, Web of Science, Medline, IEEExplore, and the Cochrane Library. The search string was: [(“video game*”) OR (“computer game*”)] AND [(“stress”) OR (“anxiety”) OR (“relaxation”)] AND [(“study”) OR (“trial”) OR (“training”)]. RESULTS: A total of 28 studies met the inclusion criteria for the publication period 2006-2021.

The majority of the retrieved studies recruited young adults, and fewer studies have involved children, middle-aged adults, and older adults. In addition to exergames and casual video games, other genres of commercial off-the-shelf games helped to reduce stress and anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: Efficacy in reducing stress and anxiety has been demonstrated not only for exergames and casual video games but also for other genres such as action games, action-adventure games, and augmented reality games. Various gaming platforms, including consoles, PCs, smartphones, mobile consoles, and virtual reality systems, have been used with positive results. Finally, even single and short sessions of play had benefits in reducing stress and anxiety.

Materials and methods This is a retrospective analysis of COVID-19 patients undergoing CTPA over a period of 27 days. The presence, extent, and severity of PTD were documented. Two observers scored the pattern and extent of lung parenchymal disease including potential fibrotic features, as well as lymph node enlargement and pleural effusions. Consensus was achieved via a third observer. Interobserver agreement was assessed using kappa statistics. Student’s t-test, chi-squared, and Mann–Whitney U-tests were used to compare imaging features between PTD and non-PTD sub-groups. Results During the study period, 100 patients with confirmed COVID-19 underwent CTPA imaging. Ninety-three studies were analysed, excluding indeterminate CTPA examinations. Overall incidence of PTD was 41/93 (44%) with 28/93 patients showing small vessel PTD (30%). D-dimer was elevated in 90/93 (96.8%) cases. A high Wells’ score did not differentiate between PTD and non-PTD groups (p=0.801). The interobserver agreement was fair (kappa=0.659) for parenchymal patterns and excellent (kappa=0.816) for severity. Thirty-four of the 93 cases (36.6%) had lymph node enlargement; 29/34 (85.3%) showed no additional source of infection. Sixteen of the 93 (17.2%) cases had potential fibrotic features. Conclusion There is a high incidence of PTD in COVID-19 patients undergoing CTPA and lack of a risk stratification tool. The present data indicate a higher suspicion of PTD is needed in severe COVID-19 patients. The concomitant presence of possible fibrotic features on CT indicates the need for follow-up.","Fang, C.; Garzillo, G.; Batohi, B.; Teo, J.T.H.; Berovic, M.; Sidhu, P.

It examines the patterns of crisis communication and the use of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) during the first month of the crisis. Primary data collected from 24 face-to-face interviews and 12 online surveys are analyzed. The research identifies elements contributing to organizational failures, which by their very nature gain public and media attention, and also explicates the less mentioned successful decisions made by response agencies in the DFW region. It is important to investigate both failures and successes to help inform organizational learning for better preparedness to future health crises. Findings suggest that, although there was a breakdown in communication between small city governments/ municipalities and higher levels of government at the State and Federal levels, prior training and collaborative relationships helped in improvised decision-making. Takeaways for practitioners include reiterating the importance of establishing SOPs, merits of flexibility, and improvisational decisions for shared learning.","Andrew, Simon A.; Arlikatti, Sudha; Chatterjee, Vaswati; Ismayilov, Orkhan",Int J Disaster Risk Reduct,384,21

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We collected daily information on implementation of 10 NPI designed to inform the public of health risks and promote distancing and mask use at the national level for eight countries across the Americas. We then analyse the adoption of the 10 policies across Brazil’s 27 states over time, individually and using a composite index. We draw on this index to assess the timeliness and rigour of NPI implementation across the country, from the date of the first case, 26 February 2020. We also compile Google data on population mobility by state to describe changes in mobility throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Brazil’s national NPI response was the least stringent among countries analysed. In the absence of a unified federal response to the pandemic, Brazilian state policy implementation was neither homogenous nor synchronised. The median NPI was no stay-at-home order, a recommendation to wear masks in public space but not a requirement, a full school closure and partial restrictions on businesses, public transportation, intrastate travel, interstate travel and international travel. These restrictions were implemented 45 days after the first case in each state, on average. Rondônia implemented the earliest and most rigorous policies, with school closures, business closures, information campaigns and restrictions on movement 24 days after the first case; Mato Grosso do Sul had the fewest, least stringent restrictions on movement, business operations and no mask recommendation. CONCLUSIONS: The study identifies wide variation in national-level NPI responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our focus on Brazil identifies subsequent variability in how and when states implemented NPI to contain COVID-19. States’ NPIs and their scores on the composite policy index both align with the governors’ political affiliations: opposition governors implemented earlier, more stringent sanitary measures than those supporting the Bolsonaro administration. A strong, unified national response to a pandemic is essential for keeping the population safe and disease-free, both at the outset of an outbreak and as communities begin to reopen. This national response should be aligned with state and municipal implementation of NPI, which we show is not the case in Brazil.","Touchton, Michael; Knaul, Felicia Marie; Arreola-Ornelas, Héctor; Porteny, Thalia; Sánchez, Mariano; Méndez, Oscar; Faganello, Marco; Edelson, Vaugh; Gygi, Benjamin; Hummel, Calla; Otero, Silvia; Insua, Jorge; Undurraga, Eduardo; Rosado, Julio Antonio",BMJ Glob Health,384,20

We adapt the naïve Bayes classifier from the machine learning community for use on atom-to-atom pairwise contacts. The result is an unsupervised learning algorithm that samples a ‘distribution’ over potential classification schemes. We apply the classifier to a series of test structures and one real protein, showing that it identifies the conformational transition with >95% accuracy in most cases. A nontrivial feature of our adaptation is a new connection to information entropy that allows us to vary the level of structural detail without spoiling the categorization. This is confirmed by comparing results as the number of atoms and time-samples are varied over 1.5 orders of magnitude. Further, the method’s derivation from Bayesian analysis on the set of inter-atomic contacts makes it easy to understand and extend to more complex cases.","Rogers, David M.",Entropy (Basel),384,24

Antibody kinetics during the acute phase are well-studied, whereas long-term kinetics are yet to be determined and available studies are controversial. Here, results of longitudinal analysis of serological responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection after convalescent and its association with post-COVID syndrome (PCS) are reported. Material and Methods 237 serum samples were prospectively collected from 61 SARS-CoV-2 qRT-PCR-confirmed participants. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 anti-N and anti-RBD/S1 Ig level were serially determined until 8 months after study inclusion. COVID-19 associated symptoms were assessed by a standardized questionnaire at study entry and after 6 months. Results Antibodies were detectable for 56/61 participants. Within the follow-up period, no substantial decline in the anti-SARS-CoV-2 pan-Ig levels were observed. In general, antibody levels were positively correlated with disease severity, BMI, fever, and nonsmoker status. 46.8% of the participants suffered from PCS, with olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions reported most frequently. Conclusion Study result point to stable anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers and thus may indicate a long-lasting immunity. These results are in line with recently published data, and add further insights concerning asymptomatic to mild affected patients, the association with clinical features and the frequency of PCS.","Gerhards, Catharina; Thiaucourt, Margot; Kittel, Maximilian; Becker, Celine; Ast, Volker; Hetjens, Michael; Neumaier, Michael; Haselmann, Verena",Int J Infect Dis,384,3

But little is known about postpartum depression and health care needs among Chinese postpartum women. Aim To investigate the status and risk factors of postpartum depression and health care needs among Chinese postpartum women during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 209 Chinese postpartum women were recruited from May to July 2020 by convenience sampling and assessed online with self-designed Maternal General Information Questionnaire, Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale (EPDS) and Chinese Version of the Perceived Stress Scale (CPSS). Descriptive statistics, chi-square test, independent samples t-test, one-way ANOVA, Pearson correlation and multiple linear regression were used for data analysis. RESULTS: With the EPDS cut-off value of 10, the incidence of postpartum depressive symptoms was 56.9%. Age, history of abortion and perceived stress were the influencing factors of postpartum depression (adjusted R(2) = 0.432, F = 23.611, p < .001). The top three health care needs were infant rearing guidance (78.0%), maternal and infant protection guidance (60.3%) and dietary guidance (45.0%). The proportion of psychological rehabilitation guidance needs in the depressed group was significantly higher than that in the non-depressed group (34.5% vs. 20.0%, p < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Maternal postpartum depression in China was at a high level during the COVID-19 pandemic. Women aged 25–34, with a history of abortion and high stress levels were at higher risk for postpartum depression. Timely psychological counselling, intervention and COVID-19-related health education are in great need for postpartum women.","An, Ran; Chen, Xiaoli; Wu, Yuanyuan; Liu, Juan; Deng, Che; Liu, Yanqun; Guo, Hongxia",Arch Psychiatr Nurs,384,32

To determine the importance of UPD and 3′-UTR, and the effects of introduced RNA elements in TMV 3′-UTR, a series of TMV mutants with internal poly(A) tract upstream of UPD was constructed for structural analysis by selective 2′-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension (SHAPE). TMV(24A+UPD) and TMV(42A+UPD) formed a similar structure as that of TMV 3′-UTR, but TMV(62A+UPD) structures altered by the introduced poly(A) tract. In addition, TMV(24A+UPD) had a higher viral RNAs accumulation than TMV in N. benthamiana protoplasts, and induced lethal symptoms in the infected plants. TMV(62A+UPD) showed a drastically reduced accumulation, its coat protein was undetectable in protoplasts, and the inoculated plants remained symptomless. This study analyzed the structures of 3′-UTR of TMV and found that the longer poly(A) tract introduced upstream of UPD reduced viral RNAs accumulation and induced milder symptoms in N. benthamiana. In conclusion, different lengths of the internal poly(A) tract introduced into the TMV 3′UTR lead to structural variations that affect virus accumulation and symptom expression.","Guo, Song; Kierzek, Elzbieta; Chen, Gang; Zhou, Yi-Jun; Wong, Sek-Man",Sci Rep,384,17

The review was undertaken to evaluate the case definition, the spectrum of clinical presentations and current management practices in children with COVID-19 presenting with or without MIS-C. Methods The individual patient data from 119 studies accounting for 333 children were analyzed. We devised a scoring system as per WHO criteria to classify the patients as MIS-C or without MIS-C. A score of 3 was given for the presence of fever (>24h) and a score of 1 for lab-confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, a score of 1 was given for a) rash or conjunctivitis or muco-cutaneous inflammation signs, b) hypotension or shock, c) diarrhea, vomiting or abdominal pain, d) features of myocardial dysfunction as determined by abnormal eco-cardiography or elevated Troponin or N-terminal pro b-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), e) evidence of coagulopathy as evidenced by elevated levels of prothrombin time PT, partial thromboplastin time PTT or D-dimer, f) laboratory evidence of inflammation as determined by elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or C-reactive protein (CRP) or procalcitonin. A negative score of (-3) was given when there was a diagnosis of sepsis, staphylococcal or streptococcal shock syndrome. Based on these criteria, a minimum score of 6 was essential to classify the child as MIS-C. Results Based on this score, 18% (52/289) of cases were identified to be MIS-C. A greater proportion of children with MIS-C had cardiac involvement (MIS-C 80% vs Non-MIS-C 20%) and gastrointestinal involvement (MIS-C 71% vs Non-MIS-C 12%). Lymphopenia was commonly reported in MIS-C (MIS-C 54.2% vs Non-MIS-C 29.7%). In addition to routine inflammatory markers, significamtly greater proportion of children with MIS-C had elevated Ferritin, LDH, Fibrinogen and IL-6. Children with MIS-C were less likely to have respiratory symptoms like cough (MIS-C 25% vs Non-MIS-C 75%) and rhinorrhea (MIS-C 4% vs Non-MIS-C 22.8%). A greater proportion of children with MIS-C required intensive care and aggressive treatment; and mortality rates were also higher in MIS-C group (MIS-C 10% vs Non-MIS-C 1%). Conclusion The children with COVID-19 having cardiac and/or gastrointestinal involvement are more likely to develop MIS-C. The children with MIS-C have higher mortality rates. The scoring system developed herein will aid clinicians in patient diagnosis and timely management.","Surve, D. S. V.; Joseph, M. S.; Gajbhiye, D. R. K.; Mahale, S. D.; Modi, D. D. N.",,384,30

South Korea introduced living and treatment support centers (LTSCs) to control regional outbreaks and care for patients with asymptomatic or mild COVID-19. Seoul National University Hospital (SNUH) introduced information and communications technology (ICT)–based solutions to manage clinically healthy patients with COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate satisfaction and usability by patients and health professionals in the optimal use of a mobile app and wearable device that SNUH introduced to the LTSC for clinically healthy patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Online surveys and focus group interviews were conducted to collect quantitative and qualitative data. RESULTS: Regarding usability testing of the wearable device, perceived usefulness had the highest mean score of 4.45 (SD 0.57) points out of 5. Regarding usability of the mobile app, perceived usefulness had the highest mean score of 4.62 (SD 0.48) points out of 5. Regarding satisfaction items for the mobile app among medical professionals, the “self-reporting” item had the highest mean score of 4.42 (SD 0.58) points out of 5. In focus group interviews of health care professionals, hospital information system interfacing was the most important functional requirement for ICT-based COVID-19 telemedicine. CONCLUSIONS: Improvement of patient safety and reduction of the burden on medical staff were the expected positive outcomes. Stability and reliability of the device, patient education, accountability, and reimbursement issues should be considered as part of the development of remote patient monitoring. In responding to a novel contagious disease, telemedicine and a wearable device were shown to be useful during a global crisis.","Bae, Ye Seul; Kim, Kyung Hwan; Choi, Sae Won; Ko, Taehoon; Lim, Jun Seo; Piao, Meihua",JMIR Form Res,384,16

Using reflexive thematic analysis within a critical realist framework, we coded and analyzed the data iteratively to refine and unify emerging themes. RESULTS: The unanticipated concept of healthcare-induced trauma emerged and was revealed in three overall themes: (1) healthcare leading to fear of serious illness or death, (2) healthcare leading to fear of people, including healthcare providers, correctional staff, and other incarcerated people, and (3) the correctional institutional, social, and physical environment leads to fear of place. CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare in correctional settings has the potential to induce trauma, even when the medical conditions addressed are not life-threatening.

Triglyceride to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (TG/HDL-C) ratio is an indicator of insulin resistance. This study aimed to explore the association of the TG/HDL-C ratio with cardiovascular risk and prognosis in COVID-19. METHODS: Ninety-eight laboratory-confirmed patients with COVID-19 admitted in a tertiary teaching hospital in Wuhan, China, were enrolled in this retrospective study. Regression models were used to investigate the association between TG/HDL-C ratio with myocardial injury, heart failure, severity, and mortality in COVID-19. RESULTS: Among the 98 patients, the mean age was 63.9±1.4 years, and male sex (58, 59%) was predominant. Forty-six patients (47%) were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), 32 (33%) and 46 (47%) patients suffered from myocardial injury and heart failure, respectively, and 36 (37%) patients died. The TG/HDL-C ratio was increased in patients with myocardial injury, heart failure, severe illness, and fatal outcome (P<0.05 for each). Baseline TG/HDL-C ratio significantly correlated with log transformed levels of plasma high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (r=0.251, P=0.018), N-terminal brain natriuretic propeptide (r=0.274, P=0.008), glycated hemoglobin (r=0.239, P=0.038), and interleukin-6 (r=0.218, P=0.042). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that an increased TG/HDL-C ratio was independently associated with the risk of myocardial injury [odds ratio (OR)=2.73; P=0.013], heart failure (OR=2.64; P=0.019), disease severity (OR=3.01; P=0.032), and fatal outcome (OR=2.97; P=0.014). CONCLUSION: Increased TG/HDL-C ratio was independently associated with myocardial injury, heart failure, disease severity, and mortality in patients with COVID-19, and it may be a useful marker for early identification of patients with high risk and poor outcome.","Zhang, Benping; Dong, Chen; Li, Shengzhong; Song, Xiaoqing; Wei, Wang; Liu, Li",Diabetes Metab Syndr Obes,384,24

However, although analysis of deep next-generation sequencing data allows us to identity potential pathogens, the entire analytical procedure requires competency in the bioinformatics domain, which includes implementing proper software packages and preparing prerequisite databases. Simple and user-friendly bioinformatics pipelines are urgently required to obtain complete viral genome sequences from metagenomic data. Results: This manuscript presents a pipeline, drVM (detect and reconstruct known viral genomes from metagenomes), for rapid viral read identification, genus-level read partition, read normalization, de novo assembly, sequence annotation, and coverage profiling. The first two procedures and sequence annotation rely on known viral genomes as a reference database. drVM was validated via the analysis of over 300 sequencing runs generated by Illumina and Ion Torrent platforms to provide complete viral genome assemblies for a variety of virus types including DNA viruses, RNA viruses, and retroviruses. drVM is available for free download at: https://sourceforge.net/projects/sb2nhri/files/drVM/ and is also assembled as a Docker container, an Amazon machine image, and a virtual machine to facilitate seamless deployment. Conclusions: drVM was compared with other viral detection tools to demonstrate its merits in terms of viral genome completeness and reduced computation time. This substantiates the platform's potential to produce prompt and accurate viral genome sequences from clinical samples.","Lin, Hsin-Hung; Liao, Yu-Chieh",Gigascience,384,9

Mobility statistics are a relatively new data source created by compiling smartphone location data; they can be effectively used for understanding pandemics if integrated with epidemiological findings and other economic data sets. Based on data for the first wave of infections in Japan, we found that reductions targeting the hospitality industry were slightly more effective than restrictions on general business activities. Specifically, we found that to hold back the pandemic (that is, to reduce the effective reproduction number to one or less for all days), a 20%–35% reduction in weekly mobility is required, depending on the region. A lesser goal, 80% of days with one or less observed transmission, can be achieved with a 6%–30% reduction in weekly mobility. These are the results if other potential causes of spread are ignored; for a fuller picture, more careful observations, expanded data sets, and advanced statistical modeling are needed.","Kajitani, Yoshio; Hatayama, Michinori",PLoS One,384,21

While neutralization has long been appreciated for its role in antibody-mediated protection, a growing body of work indicates that the antibody Fc domain also significantly contributes to antiviral protection. Recruitment of innate immune cells such as natural killer cells, neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells and the complement system by antibodies can lead to direct restriction of viral infection as well as promoting long-term antiviral immunity. Monoclonal antibody therapeutics against viruses are increasingly incorporating Fc-enhancing features to take advantage of the Fc domain, uncovering a surprising breadth of mechanisms through which antibodies can control viral infection. Here, we review the recent advances in our understanding of antibody-mediated innate immune effector functions in protection from viral infection and review the current approaches and challenges to effectively leverage innate immune cells via antibodies.","Gunn, Bronwyn M; Bai, Shuangyi",Hum Vaccin Immunother,384,17

The psychometric properties aspects of COVID-19 patients without comorbidities in the short term after discharge have not been reported. In this study, the Short Form 36 (SF-36) was used to evaluate the psychometric properties and to find relevant risk factors. METHODS: The study was conducted in seven hospitals from January 2020 to April 2020. The SF-36 questionnaire was administered one month after discharge. Univariate analysis and multivariate regression model were used to analyze the risk factors of psychometric properties impairment. RESULTS: In univariate analysis of independent risk factors, according to the comparison of whether the duration of positive nucleic acid was greater than 20 days, the positive nucleic acid duration was independently related to the decreased role-emotional value [100, IQR (66–100) vs 100, IQR (0, 100); p = 0.0156]. In addition, multivariable linear regression model showed that male sex and positive nucleic acid duration were related to decreased role-emotional value (p = 0.03< 0.05; p = 0.01< 0.05, respectively). Mental health was associated with age (p= 0.0435). Subsequently, we divided into three subgroups: less than seven days, 7 to 14 days and more than 14 days according to the positive nucleic acid duration. The results revealed that there were significant differences in the vitality value and mental health value of patients aged 46 to 69 in the subgroup where the positive nucleic acid duration longer than 14 days (p= 0.0472; p= 0.0311< 0.05, respectively). Similarly, there are also significant differences in role-emotional value in different genders (p= 0.0316).

It is a powerful antiviral strategy that has been widely employed to protect hosts from viral infection. Hepatitis E (HE) is an acute fulminant hepatitis in adults that has particularly high mortality in pregnant women. At this point in time, there is no vaccine or antiviral treatment that is effective against the infectious agent, HEV. The nonstructural polyprotein region possesses an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) that is responsible for the replication of the viral RNA genome. RdRp is therefore regarded as one of the most attractive candidates for RNA interference (RNAi). In the present study, the high efficiency and specificity of siRNA were evaluated by Real-Time quantitative PCR and Western blot assays. Protective effects against HEV infection were achieved in A549 cells and in piglets. In piglets treated with a shRNA-RdRp-1 expression plasmid prior to HEV inoculation, HEV antigens were significantly reduced in the liver, spleen, and kidneys, and the activities of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and total bilirubin (TBIL) were clearly decreased. These results suggested that RNAi is a potentially effective antiviral strategy against HEV replication and infection.","Huang, Fen; Hua, Xiuguo; Yang, Shixing; Yuan, Congli; Zhang, Wen",Antiviral Res,384,26

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Monocentric, Italian, third-level university hospital. PARTICIPANTS: All the employees of the hospital on a voluntary base, for a total of 4055 participants among 4572 HCWs (88.7%). PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Number of anti-SARS-CoV-2 positive serology according to working area. Association of anti-SARS-CoV-2 positive serology to selected variables (age, gender, country of origin, body mass index, smoking, symptoms and contact with confirmed cases). RESULTS: From 27 April 2020 to 12 June 2020, 4055 HCWs were tested and 309 (7.6%) had a serological positive test. No relevant difference was found between men and women (8.3% vs 7.3%, p=0.3), whereas a higher prevalence was observed among foreign-born workers (27/186, 14.5%, p<0.001), employees younger than 30 (64/668, 9.6%, p=0.02) or older than 60 years (38/383, 9.9%, p=0.02) and among healthcare assistants (40/320, 12.5%, p=0.06). Working as frontline HCWs was not associated with an increased frequency of positive serology (p=0.42). A positive association was found with presence and number of symptoms (p<0.001). The symptoms most frequently associated with a positive serology were taste and smell alterations (OR 4.62, 95% CI: 2.99 to 7.15) and fever (OR 4.37, 95% CI: 3.11 to 6.13). No symptoms were reported in 84/309 (27.2%) HCWs with positive IgG levels. Declared exposure to a suspected/confirmed case was more frequently associated (p<0.001) with positive serology when the contact was a family member (19/94, 20.2%) than a patient or colleague (78/888, 8.8%).

In allergy care, electronic clinical diaries have been recently used to prospectively collect patient data and improve diagnostic precision. OBJECTIVE: This review summarizes the clinical and scientific experience we gathered over 10 years of using a digital platform for patients suffering from seasonal allergic rhinitis. METHODS: The mobile application and back-office of AllergyMonitor (TPS software production, Rome, Italy) enable patients to record their daily allergy symptoms as well as drug and immunotherapy intake plus possible side effects in a customizable way. The results can be accessed by the patient and attending physician as concise reports via a smartphone or computer. This technology has been used in several clinical studies and routine practice since 2009. RESULTS: Our studies showed that A) the etiological diagnosis of SAR may be supported by matching prospectively registered symptoms with pollen counts; B) it is possible to perform a short-term prediction of SAR-symptoms at individual level; C) the adherence to daily symptom monitoring can remain high (> 80%) throughout several weeks when prescribed and thoroughly explained by the treating doctor; D) the use of mobile technology can improve adherence to symptomatic drugs as well as allergen-specific immunotherapy and E) the choice of the correct symptom-severity-score is critical at patient level, but not at group level.

Currently, no specific vaccine or treatment has been approved for this disease. To develop a therapeutic agent for SFTS, we isolated antibodies from a phage-displayed antibody library that was constructed from a patient who recovered from SFTS virus (SFTSV) infection. One antibody, designated as Ab10, was reactive to the Gn envelope glycoprotein of SFTSV and protected host cells and A129 mice from infection in both in vitro and in vivo experiments. Notably, Ab10 protected 80% of mice, even when injected 5 days after inoculation with a lethal dose of SFTSV. Using cross-linker assisted mass spectrometry and alanine scanning, we located the non-linear epitope of Ab10 on the Gn glycoprotein domain II and an unstructured stem region, suggesting that Ab10 may inhibit a conformational alteration that is critical for cell membrane fusion between the virus and host cell. Ab10 reacted to recombinant Gn glycoprotein in Gangwon/Korea/2012, HB28, and SD4 strains. Additionally, based on its epitope, we predict that Ab10 binds the Gn glycoprotein in 247 of 272 reported SFTSV isolates previously reported. Together, these data suggest that Ab10 has potential to be developed into a therapeutic agent that could protect against more than 90% of reported SFTSV isolates. Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is an emerging infectious disease localized to China, Japan, and Korea. This tick-borne virus has infected more than 5,000 humans with a 6.4% to 20.9% fatality rate. Currently, there are no prophylactic or therapeutic measures against this virus. Historically, antibodies from patients who recovered from viral infection have been used to treat new patients. Until now, one recombinant monoclonal antibody was approved for the prophylaxis of respiratory syntial virus infection. We selected 10 antibodies from a patient who recovered from SFTS and found that one antibody potently inhibited SFTS viral infection in both test tube and animal studies. We determined the binding site of this antibody to SFTS virus, which allowed us to predict that this antibody could bind 247 out of 272 SFTS virus isolates reported up to now. We anticipate that this antibody could be developed into a therapeutic measure against SFTS.","Kim, Ki Hyun; Kim, Jinhee; Ko, Meehyun; Chun, June Young; Kim, Hyori; Kim, Seungtaek; Min, Ji-Young; Park, Wan Beom; Oh, Myoung-don; Chung, Junho",bioRxiv,384,1

The change in habits and the potential exposure to a dangerous virus can be categorized as a catastrophic event, which are usually traumatic and therefore have psychological consequences for the people involved. OBJECTIVE: Assuming the COVID-19 pandemic as a possible traumatic event, this study aims to explore the contingent behavioural and psychological impact of COVID-19 spread and related lockdown on the Italian general population, through measuring anxiety and post-traumatic stress symptoms . METHODS: An ad hoc-survey was set up for the this exploratory research, including the standardized Italian versions of the Impact of Event Scale Revised (IES-R) and the Generalized Anxiety Scale (GAD-7), and ad hoc items concerning behavioural reactions due to the pandemic spread and related mass quarantine. Participants were recruited across convenient web-based and mobile app channels using a snowball sampling technique. Data was collected from March 25th to May 1st, 2020. PARTICIPANTS: One-thousand one hundred and ninety-five individuals (851 women and 342 men) completed 60% or more of the survey and were considered for analyses. Mean age was 40 years (s.d. = 14.948). Participants resided in 78 Italian provinces (out of 107 territorial divisions), with 25.7% residing in the Milan province and 9.2% from the Monza and Brianza provinces, closest to the epicentre of the Italian outbreak. RESULTS: During the worst months of the first wave of the Pandemic, the Italian population suffered high level of distress (GAD-7 m = 6.89, s.d. = 5.08; IER-R mean score = 27.86, s.d. 17.46), respectively indicating mild presence of anxiety symptoms, and high levels of PTSD symptoms. Gender seems to be a discriminating variable with women scoring significantly higher than man, both for anxiety symptoms (H (1) = 82.91, p < .001) and all dimensions of PTSD symptoms (intrusion H (1) = 71.23, p < .001, avoidance H (1) = 61.28, p < .001), and hyperarousal (H (1) = 67.348, p < .001).

CONCLUSIONS: Gender and generation appeared to be the most consistent risk factor for higher levels of generalized anxiety and PTSD symptoms in the current pandemic. Other variables – such as information seeking behaviours, parental and marriage status, chronic conditions – yielded less consistent evidence.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Two virus strains from each of six animal virus families, including both enveloped and nonenveloped viruses, were lyophilized in (i) culture medium, (ii) with the addition of gelatine–sucrose and (iii) skim milk–sodium glutamate. All the virus suspensions were frozen (i) at −80°C or (ii) in liquid nitrogen before lyophilization. Virus titre assay after lyophilization and after 8 months storage at 4°C revealed that the efficacy of stabilizers depended on virus structure. Generally, the best protective quality for enveloped viruses was achieved with gelatine–sucrose, which best maintained their infectivity and envelope morphology. Even additive‐free culture medium proved adequate for nonenveloped viruses. Differences in stabilizer efficacy were also found between virus families and were expressed immediately after lyophilization; the activity of stabilizers in the course of storage was very similar. Freezing in liquid nitrogen proved beneficial for picornaviruses. CONCLUSIONS: The choice of an appropriate stabilizer with respect to virus type is crucial for effective lyophilization.

Together, these organisms are responsible for a substantial burden of disease, with endemic and enzootic zoonoses causing about a billion cases of illness in people and millions of deaths every year. Emerging zoonoses are a growing threat to global health and have caused hundreds of billions of US dollars of economic damage in the past 20 years. We aimed to review how zoonotic diseases result from natural pathogen ecology, and how other circumstances, such as animal production, extraction of natural resources, and antimicrobial application change the dynamics of disease exposure to human beings.

This broad view is essential for the successful development of policies and practices that reduce probability of future zoonotic emergence, targeted surveillance and strategic prevention, and engagement of partners outside the medical community to help improve health outcomes and reduce disease threats.","Karesh, William B; Dobson, Andy; Lloyd-Smith, James O; Lubroth, Juan; Dixon, Matthew A; Bennett, Malcolm; Aldrich, Stephen; Harrington, Todd; Formenty, Pierre; Loh, Elizabeth H; Machalaba, Catherine C; Thomas, Mathew Jason; Heymann, David L",Lancet,384,30

Mexico has a high number of infected individuals and deaths by COVID-19, as well as an important burden of metabolic diseases. However, reports about features of Mexican individuals with COVID-19 are scarce. The aim of this study was to evaluate demographic features, clinical characteristics, and the pharmacological treatment of individuals who died by COVID-19 in the south of Mexico. Methods: We performed an observational study including 185 deceased individuals with confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. Data were retrieved from medical records. Categorical data was expressed as proportions (%) and numerical data were expressed as mean, standard deviation. Comorbidities and overlapping symptoms where plotted as Venn diagrams. Drug clusters were plotted as dendrograms. Results: The mean age was 59.53 years. There was a male predominance (60.1%). The mean hospital stay was 4.75 days. The most frequent symptoms were dyspnea (88.77%), fever (71.42%) and dry cough (64.28%). Present comorbidities were diabetes (60.63%), hypertension (59.57%) and obesity (43.61%). The main drugs used were azithromycin (60.6%), hydroxychloroquine (53.0%) and oseltamivir (27.3%). Conclusions: Mexican individuals who died of COVID-19 had shorter hospital stays, higher frequency of shortness of breath, and higher prevalence of diabetes compared with individuals from other countries. Also, there was a high frequency of off-label use of drugs for their treatment.","Ruiz-Quinonez, J. A.; Guzman-Priego, C.; Nolasco-Rosales, G. A.; Tovilla-Zarate, C. A.; Flores-Barrientos, O.

In this work, we applied selected deep learning models including multilayer perceptron, random forest, and different versions of long short-term memory (LSTM), using three data sources to train the models, including COVID-19 occurrences, basic information like coded country names, and detailed information like population, and area of different countries. The main goal is to forecast the outbreak in nine countries (Iran, Germany, Italy, Japan, Korea, Switzerland, Spain, China, and the USA). The performances of the models are measured using four metrics, including mean average percentage error (MAPE), root mean square error (RMSE), normalized RMSE (NRMSE), and R(2). The best performance was found for a modified version of LSTM, called M-LSTM (winner model), to forecast the future trajectory of the pandemic in the mentioned countries. For this purpose, we collected the data from January 22 till July 30, 2020, for training, and from 1 August 2020 to 31 August 2020, for the testing phase. Through experimental results, the winner model achieved reasonably accurate predictions (MAPE, RMSE, NRMSE, and R(2) are 0.509, 458.12, 0.001624, and 0.99997, respectively). Furthermore, we stopped the training of the model on some dates related to main country actions to investigate the effect of country actions on predictions by the model.","Kafieh, Rahele; Arian, Roya; Saeedizadeh, Narges; Amini, Zahra; Serej, Nasim Dadashi; Minaee, Shervin; Yadav, Sunil Kumar; Vaezi, Atefeh; Rezaei, Nima; Haghjooy Javanmard, Shaghayegh",Comput Math Methods Med,384,29

However, a failure to identify early cases imported to a country, bottlenecks in RT-PCR testing, and the existence of infections which are asymptomatic, sub-clinical, or with an alternative presentation than the standard cough and fever have resulted in an under-counting of the true prevalence of SARS-CoV-2. Here, we show how publicly available CDC influenza-like illness (ILI) outpatient surveillance data can be repurposed to estimate the detection rate of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections. We find a surge of non-influenza ILI above the seasonal average and show that this surge is correlated with COVID case counts across states. By quantifying the number of excess ILI patients in March relative to previous years and comparing excess ILI to confirmed COVID case counts, we estimate the syndromic case detection rate of SARS-CoV-2 in the US to be less than 13%. If only 1/3 of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 sought care, the ILI surge would correspond to more than 8.7 million new SARS-CoV-2 infections across the US during the three week period from March 8 to March 28. Combining excess ILI counts with the date of onset of community transmission in the US, we also show that the early epidemic in the US was unlikely to be doubling slower than every 4 days. Together these results suggest a conceptual model for the COVID epidemic in the US in which rapid spread across the US are combined with a large population of infected patients with presumably mild-to-moderate clinical symptoms. We emphasize the importance of testing these findings with seroprevalence data, and discuss the broader potential to use syndromic time series for early detection and understanding of emerging infectious diseases.","Silverman, Justin D; Hupert, Nathaniel; Washburne, Alex D",,384,24

METHODS: We prospectively enrolled hospitalized children aged <16 years with LRTI from 2006 to 2015. Children were clinically examined, and nasopharyngeal aspirates were analyzed using semi-quantitative, real-time polymerase chain reaction tests for HMPV, RSV and 17 other pathogens. HMPV-positive samples were genotyped. RESULTS: A total of 171 children had HMPV infection. HMPV-infected children with single virus (n = 106) and co-detections (n = 65) had similar clinical manifestations. No clinical differences were found between HMPV genotypes A (n = 67) and B (n = 80). The HMPV-infected children were older (median 17.2 months) than RSV-infected children (median 7.3 months, n = 859). Among single virus-infected children, no differences in age-adjusted LRTI diagnoses were found between HMPV and RSV. Age was an important factor for disease severity among single virus-infected children, where children <6 months old with HMPV had a milder disease than those with RSV, while in children 12–23 months old, the pattern was the opposite. In multivariable logistic regression analysis for each virus type, age ≥12 months (HMPV), and age <6 months (RSV), prematurity, ≥1 chronic disease and high viral loads of RSV, but not high HMPV viral loads, were risk factors for severe disease. CONCLUSIONS: Among hospitalized children with LRTI, HMPV manifests independently of viral co-detections and HMPV genotypes. Disease severity in HMPV- and RSV-infected children varies in relation to age. A history of prematurity and chronic disease increases the risk of severe LRTI among HMPV- and RSV-infected children.","Moe, Nina; Krokstad, Sidsel; Stenseng, Inger Heimdal; Christensen, Andreas; Skanke, Lars Høsøien; Risnes, Kari Ravndal; Nordbø, Svein Arne; Døllner, Henrik",PLoS One,384,13

Methods: Systematic scoping review using the Arksey and O’Malley methodology. Results: A total of 19 out of 396 articles were included. All studies were conducted using online self-report surveys. The average age of respondents ranged from 19 to 47 years old, comprised of more females. Almost one-half and one-fifth of the respondents gained and lost weight during the COVID-19 pandemic, respectively. Among articles that examined weight, diet and physical activity changes concurrently, weight gain was reported alongside a 36.3% to 59.6% increase in total food consumption and a 67.4% to 61.4% decrease in physical activities. Weight gain predictors included female sex, middle-age, increased appetite, snacking after dinner, less physical exercise, sedentary behaviors of ≥6 h/day, low water consumption and less sleep at night. Included articles did not illustrate significant associations between alcohol consumption, screen time, education, place of living and employment status, although sedentary behaviors, including screen time, did increase significantly. Conclusions: Examining behavioral differences alone is insufficient in predicting weight status. Future research could examine differences in personality and coping mechanisms to design more personalized and effective weight management interventions.","Chew, Han Shi Jocelyn; Lopez, Violeta",Int J Environ Res Public Health,384,16

In this study, we evaluated imaging and laboratory findings in a group of patients with a multidisciplinary diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: A total of 163 patients with a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to a specialised respiratory centre in Tehran, Iran were enrolled in this study. The distribution and characteristics of presenting radiological and laboratory findings were evaluated and the relationship to the outcome was investigated. RESULTS: RT­PCR was positive in 92 patients. The diagnosis of COVID-19 in RT-PCR negative patients was made on clinical and radiological features (n=71) and 24 (14.7%) patients died of disease. The common computed tomography (CT) scan findings included ground-glass (94%) and consolidating opacification (12%), mainly in the lower lobes (90%). Peripheral and central lung changes were observed in 90% and 52% of patients, respectively. Lymphopenia, positive CRP, and raised LDH were present in 32%, 65%, and 96% of cases, respectively. A raised LDH of >500U/L was the best predictor of death in these patients (R(2)=0.6623; OR=24.4). Other markers of outcome included male gender, age (>50 years), lymphopenia, and severe CXR changes. CONCLUSION: Diagnosis of COVID-19 can be challenging, and a multidisciplinary approach is often needed. Whilst RT-PCR is still the standard diagnostic test, a negative test should be interpreted with caution. Blood tests and imaging can be useful in the diagnosis, monitoring, and risk assessment in patients with COVID-19.","Mirsadraee, Saeed; Pourabrollah Toutkaboni, Mihan; Bakhshayeshkaram, Mehrdad; Rezaei, Mitrasadat; Askari, Elham; Haseli, Sara; Sadraee, Nazanin",Iran J Pathol,384,1

Airborne transmission often has an environmental source, as for legionellosis. It can also have an infectious human source. For a given infectious agent, the mode of transmission can be multiple. This is the case for influenza that can be spread by airborne transmission but also directly through respiratory secretion and indirectly through the contaminated environment. If airborne transmission may occur from person to person, it is most often a transmission from or through the environment.","Desenclos, J.-C.",Med Mal Infect,384,27
