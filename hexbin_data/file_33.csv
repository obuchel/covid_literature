183,Composition and Function of Haemolymphatic Tissues in the European Common Shrew,2008-10-15,"BACKGROUND: Studies of wild animals responding to their native parasites are essential if we are to understand how the immune system functions in the natural environment. While immune defence may bring increased survival, this may come at a resource cost to other physiological traits, including reproduction. Here, we tested the hypothesis that wild common shrews (Sorex araneus), which produce large numbers of offspring during the one breeding season of their short life span, forgo investment in immunity and immune system maintenance, as increased longevity is unlikely to bring further opportunities for mating. In particular, we predicted that adult shrews, with shorter expected lifespans, would not respond as effectively as young animals to infection. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We examined haemolymphatic tissues from wild-caught common shrews using light and transmission electron microscopy, applied in conjunction with immunohistology. We compared composition and function of these tissues in shrews of different ages, and the extent and type of inflammatory reactions observed in response to natural parasitic infections. All ages seemed able to mount systemic, specific immune responses, but adult shrews showed some signs of lymphatic tissue exhaustion: lymphatic follicles in adults (n = 21) were both smaller than those in sub-adults (n = 18; Wald = 11.1, p<0.05) and exhibited greater levels of depletion (Wald = 13.3, p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Contrary to our expectations, shrews respond effectively to their natural parasites, and show little indication of immunosenescence as adults. The pancreas of Aselli, a unique lymphoid organ, may aid in providing efficient immune responses through the storage of large numbers of plasma cells. This may allow older animals to react effectively to previously encountered parasites, but infection by novel agents, and eventual depletion of plasma cell reserves, could both still be factors in the near-synchronous mortality of adult shrews observed shortly after breeding.","Bray, Daniel P.; Bennett, Malcolm; Stockley, Paula; Hurst, Jane L.; Kipar, Anja",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2561066/,33
521,"Targeting vaccination against novel infections: risk, age and spatial structure for pandemic influenza in Great Britain",2011-05-06,"The emergence of a novel strain of H1N1 influenza virus in Mexico in 2009, and its subsequent worldwide spread, has focused attention to the question of optimal deployment of mass vaccination campaigns. Here, we use three relatively simple models to address three issues of primary concern in the targeting of any vaccine. The advantages of such simple models are that the underlying assumptions and effects of individual parameters are relatively clear, and the impact of uncertainty in the parametrization can be readily assessed in the early stages of an outbreak. In particular, we examine whether targeting risk-groups, age-groups or spatial regions could be optimal in terms of reducing the predicted number of cases or severe effects; and how these targeted strategies vary as the epidemic progresses. We examine the conditions under which it is optimal to initially target vaccination towards those individuals within the population who are most at risk of severe effects of infection. Using age-structured mixing matrices, we show that targeting vaccination towards the more epidemiologically important age groups (5–14 year olds and then 15–24 year olds) leads to the greatest reduction in the epidemic growth and hence reduces the total number of cases. Finally, we consider how spatially targeting the vaccine towards regions of country worst affected could provide an advantage. We discuss how all three of these priorities change as both the speed at which vaccination can be deployed and the start of the vaccination programme is varied.","Keeling, Matt J.; White, Peter J.",J R Soc Interface,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3061093/,33
641,Reconstructing disease outbreaks from genetic data: a graph approach,2010-06-16,"Epidemiology and public health planning will increasingly rely on the analysis of genetic sequence data. In particular, genetic data coupled with dates and locations of sampled isolates can be used to reconstruct the spatiotemporal dynamics of pathogens during outbreaks. Thus far, phylogenetic methods have been used to tackle this issue. Although these approaches have proved useful for informing on the spread of pathogens, they do not aim at directly reconstructing the underlying transmission tree. Instead, phylogenetic models infer most recent common ancestors between pairs of isolates, which can be inadequate for densely sampled recent outbreaks, where the sample includes ancestral and descendent isolates. In this paper, we introduce a novel method based on a graph approach to reconstruct transmission trees directly from genetic data. Using simulated data, we show that our approach can efficiently reconstruct genealogies of isolates in situations where classical phylogenetic approaches fail to do so. We then illustrate our method by analyzing data from the early stages of the swine-origin A/H1N1 influenza pandemic. Using 433 isolates sequenced at both the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes, we reconstruct the likely history of the worldwide spread of this new influenza strain. The presented methodology opens new perspectives for the analysis of genetic data in the context of disease outbreaks.","Jombart, T; Eggo, R M; Dodd, P J; Balloux, F",Heredity,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3183872/,33

1921,"Concentration, Size Distribution, and Infectivity of Airborne Particles Carrying Swine Viruses",2015-08-19,"When pathogens become airborne, they travel associated with particles of different size and composition. Particle size determines the distance across which pathogens can be transported, as well as the site of deposition and the survivability of the pathogen. Despite the importance of this information, the size distribution of particles bearing viruses emitted by infectious animals remains unknown. In this study we characterized the concentration and size distribution of inhalable particles that transport influenza A virus (IAV), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) generated by acutely infected pigs and assessed virus viability for each particle size range. Aerosols from experimentally infected pigs were sampled for 24 days using an Andersen cascade impactor able to separate particles by size (ranging from 0.4 to 10 micrometer (μm) in diameter). Air samples collected for the first 9, 20 and the last 3 days of the study were analyzed for IAV, PRRSV and PEDV, respectively, using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and quantified as geometric mean copies/m(3) within each size range. IAV was detected in all particle size ranges in quantities ranging from 5.5x10(2) (in particles ranging from 1.1 to 2.1μm) to 4.3x10(5) RNA copies/m(3) in the largest particles (9.0–10.0μm). PRRSV was detected in all size ranges except particles between 0.7 and 2.1μm in quantities ranging from 6x10(2) (0.4–0.7μm) to 5.1x10(4) RNA copies/m(3) (9.0–10.0μm). PEDV, an enteric virus, was detected in all particle sizes and in higher quantities than IAV and PRRSV (p < 0.0001) ranging from 1.3x10(6) (0.4–0.7μm) to 3.5x10(8) RNA copies/m(3) (9.0–10.0μm). Infectious status was demonstrated for the 3 viruses, and in the case of IAV and PRRSV, viruses were isolated from particles larger than 2.1μm. In summary, our results indicated that airborne PEDV, IAV and PRRSV can be found in a wide range of particle sizes. However, virus viability is particle size dependent.","Alonso, Carmen; Raynor, Peter C.; Davies, Peter R.; Torremorell, Montserrat",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4545937/,33
2053,Quantity and Size Distribution of Cough-Generated Aerosol Particles Produced by Influenza Patients During and After Illness,2012-05-31,"The question of whether influenza is transmitted to a significant degree by aerosols remains controversial, in part, because little is known about the quantity and size of potentially infectious airborne particles produced by people with influenza. In this study, the size and amount of aerosol particles produced by nine subjects during coughing were measured while they had influenza and after they had recovered, using a laser aerosol particle spectrometer with a size range of 0.35 to 10 μm. Individuals with influenza produce a significantly greater volume of aerosol when ill compared with afterward (p = 0.0143). When the patients had influenza, their average cough aerosol volume was 38.3 picoliters (pL) of particles per cough (SD 43.7); after patients recovered, the average volume was 26.4 pL per cough (SD 45.6). The number of particles produced per cough was also higher when subjects had influenza (average 75,400 particles/cough, SD 97,300) compared with afterward (average 52,200, SD 98,600), although the difference did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.1042). The average number of particles expelled per cough varied widely from patient to patient, ranging from 900 to 302,200 particles/cough while subjects had influenza and 1100 to 308,600 particles/cough after recovery. When the subjects had influenza, an average of 63% of each subject's cough aerosol particle volume in the detection range was in the respirable size fraction (SD 22%), indicating that these particles could reach the alveolar region of the lungs if inhaled by another person. This enhancement in aerosol generation during illness may play an important role in influenza transmission and suggests that a better understanding of this phenomenon is needed to predict the production and dissemination of influenza-laden aerosols by people infected with this virus.

2439,Day-to-Day Population Movement and the Management of Dengue Epidemics,2016-10-04,"Dengue is a growing public health problem in tropical and subtropical cities. It is transmitted by mosquitoes, and the main strategy for epidemic prevention and control is insecticide fumigation. Effective management is, however, proving elusive. People’s day-to-day movement about the city is believed to be an important factor in the epidemiological dynamics. We use a simple model to examine the fundamental roles of broad demographic and spatial structures in epidemic initiation, growth and control. We show that the key factors are local dilution, characterised by the vector–host ratio, and spatial connectivity, characterised by the extent of habitually variable movement patterns. Epidemic risk in the population is driven by the demographic groups that frequent the areas with the highest vector–host ratio, even if they only spend some of their time there. Synchronisation of epidemic trajectories in different demographic groups is governed by the vector–host ratios to which they are exposed and the strength of connectivity. Strategies for epidemic prevention and management may be made more effective if they take into account the fluctuating landscape of transmission intensity associated with spatial heterogeneity in the vector–host ratio and people’s day-to-day movement patterns.

2622,Disease dynamics in a stochastic network game: a little empathy goes a long way in averting outbreaks,2017-03-14,"Individuals change their behavior during an epidemic in response to whether they and/or those they interact with are healthy or sick. Healthy individuals may utilize protective measures to avoid contracting a disease. Sick individuals may utilize preemptive measures to avoid spreading a disease. Yet, in practice both protective and preemptive changes in behavior come with costs. This paper proposes a stochastic network disease game model that captures the self-interests of individuals during the spread of a susceptible-infected-susceptible disease. In this model, individuals strategically modify their behavior based on current disease conditions. These reactions influence disease spread. We show that there is a critical level of concern, i.e., empathy, by the sick individuals above which disease is eradicated rapidly. Furthermore, we find that risk averse behavior by the healthy individuals cannot eradicate the disease without the preemptive measures of the sick individuals. Empathy is more effective than risk-aversion because when infectious individuals change behavior, they reduce all of their potential infections, whereas when healthy individuals change behavior, they reduce only a small portion of potential infections. This imbalance in the role played by the response of the infected versus the susceptible individuals on disease eradication affords critical policy insights.","Eksin, Ceyhun; Shamma, Jeff S.; Weitz, Joshua S.",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5349521/,33

3407,The Current Status of the Pharmaceutical Potential of Juniperus L. Metabolites,2018-07-31,"Background: Plants and their derived natural compounds possess various biological and therapeutic properties, which turns them into an increasing topic of interest and research. Juniperus genus is diverse in species, with several traditional medicines reported, and rich in natural compounds with potential for development of new drugs. Methods: The research for this review were based in the Scopus and Web of Science databases using terms combining Juniperus, secondary metabolites names, and biological activities. This is not an exhaustive review of Juniperus compounds with biological activities, but rather a critical selection taking into account the following criteria: (i) studies involving the most recent methodologies for quantitative evaluation of biological activities; and (ii) the compounds with the highest number of studies published in the last four years. Results: From Juniperus species, several diterpenes, flavonoids, and one lignan were emphasized taking into account their level of activity against several targets. Antitumor activity is by far the most studied, being followed by antibacterial and antiviral activities. Deoxypodophyllotoxin and one dehydroabietic acid derivative appears to be the most promising lead compounds. Conclusions: This review demonstrates the Juniperus species value as a source of secondary metabolites with relevant pharmaceutical potential.","Tavares, Wilson R.; Seca, Ana M.

3606,Estimating the incidence and diagnosed proportion of HIV infections in Japan: a statistical modeling study,2019-01-15,"BACKGROUND: Epidemiological surveillance of HIV infection in Japan involves two technical problems for directly applying a classical backcalculation method, i.e., (i) all AIDS cases are not counted over time and (ii) people diagnosed with HIV have received antiretroviral therapy, extending the incubation period. The present study aimed to address these issues and estimate the HIV incidence and the proportion of diagnosed HIV infections, using a simple statistical model. METHODS: From among Japanese nationals, yearly incidence data of HIV diagnoses and patients with AIDS who had not previously been diagnosed as HIV positive, from 1985 to 2017, were analyzed. Using the McKendrick partial differential equation, general convolution-like equations were derived, allowing estimation of the HIV incidence and the time-dependent rate of diagnosis. A likelihood-based approach was used to obtain parameter estimates. RESULTS: Assuming that the median incubation period was 10.0 years, the cumulative number of HIV infections was estimated to be 29,613 (95% confidence interval (CI): 29,059, 30,167) by the end of 2017, and the proportion of diagnosed HIV infections was estimated at 80.3% (95% CI [78.7%–82.0%]). Allowing the median incubation period to range from 7.5 to 12.3 years, the estimate of the proportion diagnosed can vary from 77% to 84%. DISCUSSION: The proportion of diagnosed HIV infections appears to have not yet reached 90% among Japanese nationals. Compared with the peak incidence from 2005–2008, new HIV infections have clearly been in a declining trend; however, there are still more than 1,000 new HIV infections per year in Japan. To increase the diagnosed proportion of HIV infections, it is critical to identify people who have difficulty accessing consultation, testing, and care, and to explore heterogeneous patterns of infection.","Nishiura, Hiroshi",PeerJ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6338104/,33
3681,Rodents Versus Pig Model for Assessing the Performance of Serotype Chimeric Ad5/3 Oncolytic Adenoviruses,2019-02-08,"Oncolytic adenoviruses (Ad) are promising tools for cancer therapeutics. Most Ad-based therapies utilize species C serotypes, with Adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) most commonly employed. Prior clinical trials demonstrated low efficiency of oncolytic Ad5 vectors, mainly due to the absence of Ad5 primary receptor (Coxsackie and Adenovirus Receptor, CAR) on cancer cells. Engineering serotype chimeric vectors (Ad5/3) to utilize Adenovirus type 3 (Ad3) receptors has greatly improved their oncolytic potential. Clinical translation of these infectivity-enhanced vectors has been challenging due to a lack of replication permissive animal models. In this study, we explored pigs as a model to study the performance of fiber-modified Ad5/3 chimeric vectors. As a control, the Ad5 fiber-unmodified virus was used. We analyzed binding, gene transfer, replication, and cytolytic ability of Ad5 and Ad5/3 in various non-human cell lines (murine, hamster, canine, porcine). Among all tested cell lines only porcine cells supported active binding and replication of Ad5/3. Syrian hamster cells supported Ad5 replication but showed no evidence of productive viral replication after infection with Ad5/3 vectors. Transduction and replication ability of Ad5/3 in porcine cells outperformed Ad5, a phenomenon often observed in human cancer cell lines. Replication of Ad5 and Ad5/3 was subsequently evaluated in vivo in immunocompetent pigs. Quantitative PCR analyses 7 days post infection revealed Ad5 and Ad5/3 DNA and replication-dependent luciferase activity in the swine lungs and spleen indicating active replication in these tissues. These studies demonstrated the flaws in using Syrian hamsters for testing serotype chimeric Ad5/3 vectors. This is the first report to validate the pig as a valuable model for preclinical testing of oncolytic adenoviruses utilizing Adenovirus type 3 receptors. We hope that these data will help to foster the clinical translation of oncolytic adenoviruses including those with Ad3 retargeted tropism.","Koodie, Lisa; Robertson, Matthew G.; Chandrashekar, Malavika; Ruth, George; Dunning, Michele; Bianco, Richard W.; Davydova, Julia",Cancers (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6406826/,33
3779,DNA-aided identification of Culex mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) reveals unexpected diversity in underground cavities in Austria,2019-03-27,"Subterranean cavities serve as resting places and hibernation shelters for mosquitoes. In Europe, members of the genus Culex are often the most abundant insects on cave walls. Culex pipiens L., the common house mosquito, exists in two physically very similar, yet genetically and ecologically distinct biotypes (or forms, ‘f.’), namely Cx. pipiens f. pipiens and Cx. pipiens f. molestus. Autogeny and stenogamy of the latter form have been interpreted as adaptations to underground habitats. The epigean occurrence of the two biotypes and their hybrids was recently examined in Eastern Austria, but the hypogean distribution of the Cx. pipiens complex and morphologically similar non-members such as Cx. torrentium is unknown. Considering the key role of Culex mosquitoes in the epidemiology of certain zoonotic pathogens, the general paucity of data on species composition and relative abundance in subterranean shelters appears unfortunate. For a first pertinent investigation in Austria, we collected mosquitoes in four eastern federal states. Based on analyses of the ACE2 gene and the CQ11 microsatellite locus, 150 female and three male mosquitoes of the genus Culex, two females of the genus Culiseta and a single female of the genus Anopheles were determined to species level or below. In our catches, Cx. pipiens f. pipiens exceeded the apparent abundance of the purportedly cave-adapted Cx. pipiens f. molestus many times over. Records of Cx. hortensis and Cx. territans, two species rarely collected in Austria, lead us to infer that underground habitats host a higher diversity of culicine mosquitoes than previously thought.","Zittra, Carina; Moog, Otto; Christian, Erhard; Fuehrer, Hans-Peter",Parasitol Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6478630/,33
4222,Zika and Flavivirus Shell Disorder: Virulence and Fetal Morbidity,2019-11-06,"Zika virus (ZIKV) was first discovered in 1947 in Africa. Since then, sporadic ZIKV infections of humans have been reported in Africa and Asia. For a long time, this virus was mostly unnoticed due to its mild symptoms and low fatality rates. However, during the 2015–2016 epidemic in Central and South America, when millions of people were infected, it was discovered that ZIKV causes microcephaly in the babies of mothers infected during pregnancy. An examination of the M and C proteins of the ZIKV shell using the disorder predictor PONDR VLXT revealed that the M protein contains relatively high disorder levels comparable only to those of the yellow fever virus (YFV). On the other hand, the disorder levels in the C protein are relatively low, which can account for the low case fatality rate (CFR) of this virus in contrast to the more virulent YFV, which is characterized by high disorder in its C protein. A larger variation was found in the percentage of intrinsic disorder (PID) in the C protein of various ZIKV strains. Strains of African lineage are characterized by higher PIDs. Using both in vivo and in vitro experiments, laboratories have also previously shown that strains of African origin have a greater potential to inflict higher fetal morbidity than do strains of Asian lineage, with dengue-2 virus (DENV-2) having the least potential. Strong correlations were found between the potential to inflict fetal morbidity and shell disorder in ZIKV (r(2) = 0.9) and DENV-2 (DENV-2 + ZIKV, r(2) = 0.8). A strong correlation between CFR and PID was also observed when ZIKV was included in an analysis of sets of shell proteins from a variety of flaviviruses (r(2) = 0.8). These observations have potential implications for antiviral vaccine development and for the design of cancer therapeutics in terms of developing therapeutic viruses that penetrate hard-to-reach organs.","Goh, Gerard Kian-Meng; Dunker, A.

5285,Oral application of cytokines,1996,"Influenza viruses cause annual epidemics and occasional pandemics that have claimed the lives of millions. The emergence of new strains will continue to pose challenges to public health and the scientific communities. The recent flu pandemic caused by a swine-origin influenza virus A/H1N1 (S-OIV) presents an opportunity to examine virulence factors, the spread of the infection and to prepare for major influenza outbreaks in the future. The virus contains a novel constellation of gene segments, the nearest known precursors being viruses found in swine and it probably arose through reassortment of two viruses of swine origin. Specific markers for virulence can be evaluated in the viral genome, PB1-F2 is a molecular marker of pathogenicity but is not present in the new S-OIV. While attention was focused on a threat of an avian influenza H5N1 pandemic emerging from Asia, a novel influenza virus of swine origin emerged in North America, and is now spreading worldwide. However, S-OIV demonstrates that even serotypes already encountered in past human pandemics may constitute new pandemic threats. There are concerns that this virus may mutate or reassort with existing influenza viruses giving rise to more transmissible or more pathogenic viruses. The 1918 Spanish flu pandemic virus was relatively mild in its first wave and acquired more virulence when it returned in the winter. Thus preparedness on a global scale against a potential more virulent strain is highly recommended. Most isolates of the new S-OIVs are susceptible to neuraminidase inhibitors, and currently a vaccine against the pandemic strain is being manufactured and will be available this fall. This review summarizes the current information on the new pandemic swine-origin influenza virus A/H1N1.","Schnitzler, Sebastian U.; Schnitzler, Paul",Virus Genes,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7088521/,33

In the area of autoimmunity, we are attempting to downregulate the immune response by specific immune intervention directed against autoreactive T cells.

This suitably hybridized nexus creates a place to consider the ecologies of a pathogen which could be considered as life out of control. I consider what this means for efforts to eradicate this disease through combining understandings from the published scientific literature with qualitative interview-based fieldwork with farmers, veterinarians and others involved in the statutory bTB eradication programme in a high incidence region of the UK.

The program emphasized surveillance from the beginning, largely to track the success of the program and further our understanding of the epidemiology of the disease. Early observations in West Africa, bolstered by later data from Indonesia and the Asian subcontinent, showed that smallpox did not spread rapidly, and outbreaks could be quickly controlled by isolation of patients and vaccination of their contacts. Contacts were usually easy to find because transmission of smallpox usually required prolonged face-to-face contact. The emphasis therefore shifted to active searches to find cases, coupled with contact tracing, rigorous isolation of patients, and vaccination and surveillance of contacts to contain outbreaks. This shift away from mass vaccination resulted in an acceleration of the program’s success.","Lane, J.

9106,Within-and between-strain variability in longevity of inbred and outbred rats under the same environmental conditions,2000-02-17,"Feline panleukopenia virus (FPV) and canine parvovirus (CPV) are autonomous parvoviruses which infect cats or dogs, respectively. Both viruses cause an acute disease, with virus replicating for less than seven days before being cleared by the developing immune responses. The viruses have a broad tropism for mitotically active cells. In neonatal animals the viruses replicate in a large number of tissues, and FPV infection of the germinal epithelium of the cerebellum leads to cerebellar hypoplasia, while CPV may infect the hearts of neonatal pups, causing myocarditis. In older animals the virus replicates systemically, primarily in the primary and secondary lymphoid tissues, and also in the rapidly replicating cells of the small intestinal epithelial crypts. A transient panleukopenia or relative lymphopenia is often observed after FPV or CPV infection, respectively. Whether the reduction in cell numbers in vivo is due to virus replicating in and killing cells, or due to other indirect effects, is not known. However, FPV kills both erythroid and myeloid colony progenitors in in vitro bone marow cultures, and it has been suggested that virus replication in the myeloid cells in vivo could lead to the reduced neutrophil levels seen after FPV infection of cats.","Parrish, Colin R.",Baillieres Clin Haematol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134857/,33

To evaluate possible effects of ABHR applications on glove integrity, thirteen brands of nitrile and latex medical exam gloves from five manufacturers and two different ABHRs were included in this study. A pair of gloves were worn by a test operator and the outside surfaces of the gloves were separately treated with an ABHR for 1–6 applications. Tensile strength and ultimate elongation of the gloves without any ABHR treatments (control gloves) and gloves after 1–6 ABHR applications were measured based on the ASTM D412 standard method. In general, tensile strength decreased with each ABHR application. ABHRs had more effect on the tensile strength of the tested nitrile than latex gloves, while ethanol-based ABHR (EBHR) resulted in lesser changes in tensile strength compared to isopropanol-based ABHR (IBHR). The results show that multiple EBHR applications on the latex gloves and some of the nitrile gloves tested should be safe for Ebola PPE doffing based on the CDC guidance. Appropriate hospital staff practice using ABHR treatment and doffing gloves is recommended to become more familiar with changes in glove properties.","Gao, Pengfei; Horvatin, Matthew; Niezgoda, George; Weible, Robyn; Shaffer, Ronald",J Occup Environ Hyg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7157957/,33

9945,Preliminary Development and Engineering Evaluation of a Novel Cricothyrotomy Device,2010-09-01,"Noninvasive ventilator support using bi-level positive airway pressure/continuous positive airway pressure (BiPAP/CPAP) is commonly utilized for chronic medical conditions like sleep apnea and neuromuscular disorders like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) that lead to weakness of respiratory muscles. Generic masks come in standard sizes and are often perceived by patients as being uncomfortable, ill-fitting, and leaky. A significant number of patients are unable to tolerate the masks and eventually stop using their devices. The goal of this project is to develop custom-fit masks to increase comfort, decrease air leakage, and thereby improve patient compliance. A single-patient case study of a patient with variant ALS was performed to evaluate the custom-fit masks. His high nose bridge and overbite of lower jaw caused poor fit with generic masks, and he was noncompliant with his machine. Using desktop Stereolithography three-dimensional (3D) printing and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, a generic mask was extended with a rigid interface such that it was complementary to the patient's unique facial contours. Patient or clinicians interactively select a desired mask shape using a newly developed computer program. Subsequently, a compliant silicone layer was applied to the rigid interface. Ten different custom-fit mask designs were made using computer-aided design software. Patient evaluated the comfort, extent of leakage, and satisfaction of each mask via a questionnaire. All custom-fit masks were rated higher than the standard mask except for two. Our results suggest that modifying generic masks with a 3D-printed custom-fit interface is a promising strategy to improve compliance with BiPAP/CPAP machines.","Wu, Ying Ying; Acharya, Deepshikha; Xu, Camilla; Cheng, Boyle; Rana, Sandeep; Shimada, Kenji",J Med Device,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7164498/,33
9950,Airway Transmural Pressures in an Airway Tree During Bronchoconstriction in Asthma,2019-02-13,"An inverse model consisting of two elastic compartments connected in series and served by two airway conduits has recently been fit to measurements of respiratory impedance in obese subjects. Increases in the resistance of the distal conduit of the model with increasing body mass index have been linked to peripheral airway compression by mass loading of the chest wall. Nevertheless, how the two compartments and conduits of this simple model map onto the vastly more complicated structure of an actual lung remain unclear. To investigate this issue, we developed a multiscale branching airway tree model of the respiratory system that predicts realistic input impedance spectra between 5 and 20 Hz with only four free parameters. We use this model to study how the finite elastances of the conducting airway tree and the proximal upper airways affect impedance between 5 and 20 Hz. We show that progressive constriction of the peripheral airways causes impedance to appear to arise from two compartments connected in series, with the proximal compartment being a reflection of the elastance of upper airway structures proximal to the tracheal entrance and the lower compartment reflecting the pulmonary airways and tissues. We thus conclude that while this simple inverse model allows evaluation of overall respiratory system impedance between 5 and 20 Hz in the presence of upper airway shunting, it does not allow the separate contributions of central versus peripheral pulmonary airways to be resolved.","Bates, Jason H.

9958,Reorganization of the Vimentin Network in Smooth Muscle,2019-01-18,"Background A well established drug for the treatment of asthma and allergy, sodium cromoglycale, was found in open trials to be useful as a symptomalic treatment for upper respiratory tract infections. Objective To compare the efficacy of inhaled and intranasal sodium cromoglyeate and matching placebos on the symptoms of upper respiratory tract infections. Methods Adult subjects with symptoms of runny nose, throat pain, or cough for less than 24 h were recruited. They were treated for 7 days using a randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, group comparative design. The medication given was: sodium cromoglyeate dry powder 20mg per inhalation in spincaps; sodium cromoglycate aqueous nasal spray delivering 5.2mg per dose; or matching placebo as dry powder and nasal spray. One spincap and one spray per nostril were taken every 2h during waking hours on days 1 and 2 and then four times daily on days 3–7. Severity of nine symptoms (general malaise, body aches and pains, chills and shivering, snzeening, nasal running, nasal blocking, sore throat, cough and voice disturbance) was recorded twice daily by subjects on diary cards, using a scale of 0 (absent) to 3 (severe). Results The sludy was conducted between February and April 1993. One hundred and eighteen patients aged 21–63 years (mean 41 years) were included. Symptoms resolved faster (P < 0.001) and the severity in the last three days of treatment was significantly less in patients treated with sodium cromoglycate than with placebo (P < 0.05‐day 5; P < 0.01‐day 6; P < 0.001‐day 7). Side‐effects were local and mild and did not differ between the treatment groups. Conclusion Sodium cromoglyeate administered both by inhalation and intranasally is an effective treatment for the symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection. Its combined safety and efficacy would make it an acceptable form of treatment for these conditions.","ÅBERG, N.; ÅBERG, B.; ALESTIG, K.",Clin Exp Allergy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7164824/,33

Grids coated with staphylococcal protein A were floated on samples mounted on agar containing 2% antiserum and incubated at 37 C, for 60 min. After washing and staining, the grids were observed in an electron microscope. The effects of protein A on virus detection were evaluated using poliovirus and bovine rotavirus infected cell culture fluids. The results showed that the technique using protein A (PA‐SIA) had at least 10‐fold higher sensitivity for virus detection than the original SIA. The optimal concentration of protein A was 1 to 10 μg/ml for coating the grids to trap virus particles. The PA‐SIA method was also compared with immunosorbent electron microscopy (ISEM). The former showed higher or at least the same sensitivity and some advantages in detecting antigen‐antibody reaction than the latter method. These results indicate that our PA‐SIA method may be superior to other IEM techniques presented previously for the detection and identification of viruses.","Furui, Sataro",Microbiol Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7168436/,33
10273,Print‐only Abstracts,2008-10-09,"Globalization may be viewed as the growing interdependence of countries worldwide through the increasing volume and variety of cross‐border transactions in goods and services, and also through the more rapid and widespread diffusion of technology. Globalization is not just an economic phenomenon, although it is frequently described as such, but includes commerce, disease and travel, and immigration, and as such it affects blood safety and supply in various ways. The relatively short travel times offered by modern aviation can result in the rapid spread of blood‐borne pathogens before measures to counteract transmission can be put in place; this would have happened with SARS if the basic life cycle of the SARS virus did not include an asymptomatic viraemia. This risk can be amplified by ecological factors which effect the spread of these pathogens once they are transferred to a naïve ecosystem, as happened with West Nile virus (WNV) in North America. The rationalization and contraction of the plasma products industry may be viewed as one aspect of globalization imposed by the remorseless inevitability of the market; the effect of this development on the safety and supply of products has yet to be seen, but the oversight and assurance of a shrinking number of players will present particular challenges. Similarly, the monopolization of technology, through patent enforcement which puts access beyond the reach of developing countries, can have an effect on blood safety. The challenges presented to blood safety by globalization are heightening the tensions between the traditional focus on the product safety – zero‐risk paradigm and the need to view the delivery of safe blood as an integrated process. As an illustration of this tension, donor deferral measures imposed by globalization‐induced risks such as vCJD and WNV have resulted in the loss of the safest and most committed portion of the blood donor population in many Western countries, leading to an increased risk to safety and supply. It is only through an appreciation of the basic needs of transfusion medicine, including the enunciation of appropriate principles to manage, rather than eliminate, risks, that the challenges imposed by globalization may be overcome.","Farrugia, A.",ISBT Sci Ser,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7169292/,33
10922,Role of hubs in the synergistic spread of behavior,2019-02-25,We show that the recently introduced logarithmic metrics used to predict disease arrival times on complex networks are approximations of more general network-based measures derived from random walks theory. Using the daily air-traffic transportation data we perform numerical experiments to compare the infection arrival time with this alternative metric that is obtained by accounting for multiple walks instead of only the most probable path. The comparison with direct simulations reveals a higher correlation compared to the shortest-path approach used previously. In addition our method allows to connect fundamental observables in epidemic spreading with the cumulant-generating function of the hitting time for a Markov chain. Our results provides a general and computationally efficient approach using only algebraic methods.,"Iannelli, Flavio; Koher, Andreas; Brockmann, Dirk; Hövel, Philipp; Sokolov, Igor M.",Phys Rev E,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7217543/,33
11247,"An appraisal of oriental theileriosis and the Theileria orientalis complex, with an emphasis on diagnosis and genetic characterisation",2019-12-06,"The epidemiology of coagulase-negative staphylococcal (CNS) bacteremia among adult ICU patients remains unclear. Decontamination studies among ICU patients provide a unique opportunity to study the impacts of different diagnostic criteria, exposure to various decontamination interventions, and various other factors, on its incidence over three decades. Decontamination studies among ICU patients reporting CNS bacteremia incidence data were obtained mostly from recent systematic reviews. The CNS bacteremia incidence within component (control and intervention) groups of decontamination studies was benchmarked versus studies without intervention (observational groups). The impacts of antibiotic versus chlorhexidine decontamination interventions, control group concurrency, publication year, and diagnostic criteria were examined in meta-regression models. Among non-intervention (observational) studies which did versus did not specify stringent (≥ 2 positive blood cultures) diagnostic criteria, the mean CNS bacteremia incidence per 100 patients (and 95% CI; n) is 1.3 (0.9–2.0; n = 23) versus 3.6 (1.8–6.9; n = 8), respectively, giving an overall benchmark of 1.8 (1.2–2.4; n = 31). Versus the benchmark incidence, the mean incidence is high among concurrent control (5.7; 3.6–9.1%) and intervention (5.2; 3.6–6.9%), but not non-concurrent control (1.0; 0.4–3.9%) groups of 21 antibiotic studies, nor among eleven component groups of chlorhexidine studies. This high incidence remained apparent (p < 0.01) in meta-regression models adjusting for group wide factors such as diagnostic criteria and publication year. The incidence of CNS bacteremia within both intervention and concurrent (but not non-concurrent) control groups of antibiotic-based decontamination studies are unusually high even accounting for variable diagnostic criteria and other factors.

11256,Authors’ Response to Drs. Ece Salihoglu and Ziya Salihoglu’s Letter to the Editor,2019-08-13,"BACKGROUND: Oropharyngeal colostrum (OC) is a novel feeding strategy to prevent complications of prematurity. A meta-analysis was conducted to investigate whether very low birth weight infants (VLBWs) can benefit from OC. METHODS: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were searched from Embase, PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from the date of inception until May 2019. RCTs were eligible if they used OC therapy on VLBW infants. The primary outcomes included ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), late-onset sepsis, and death. The secondary outcomes included the time of full enteral feeding and the length of stay. RESULTS: Eight RCTs involving 682 patients (OC group: 332; non-OC group: 350) were included in the meta-analysis. The results suggested that OC was associated with a significantly reduced incidence of VAP [odds ratio (OR) = 0.39, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.17–0.88, P = 0.02] and full enteral feeding days (mean difference = −2.66, 95% CI: −4.51 to −0.80, P = 0.005), a potential significance of NEC (OR = 0.51, 95% CI: 0.26–0.99, P = 0.05), a trend toward downregulating mortality (OR = 0.60, 95% CI: 0.34–1.08, P = 0.09) and proven sepsis (OR = 0.64, 95% CI: 0.40–1.01, P = 0.06). CONCLUSIONS: OC could significantly reduce the occurrence of VAP, and consequently, its routine use should be considered for VLBWs to prevent infectious diseases. IMPACT: OC significantly reduces the occurrence of VAP and NEC in VLBW infants. OC may reduce the incidence of VAP and NEC by increasing IgA levels. Early OC therapy for mechanical ventilation of low-weight infants may prevent the occurrence of VAP.","Ma, Aijia; Yang, Jing; Li, Yang; Zhang, Xuepeng; Kang, Yan",Pediatr Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7223528/,33

11762,Our new feature: Narrative Medicine,2020-05-25,"BACKGROUND: Measles is a highly infectious viral disease. In August 2017, Lyantonde District, Uganda reported a measles outbreak to Uganda Ministry of Health. We investigated the outbreak to assess the scope, factors facilitating transmission, and recommend control measures. METHODS: We defined a probable case as sudden onset of fever and generalized rash in a resident of Lyantonde, Lwengo, or Rakai Districts from 1 June-30 September 2017, plus ≥1 of the following: coryza, conjunctivitis, or cough. A confirmed case was a probable case with serum positivity of measles-specific IgM. We conducted a neighborhood- and age-matched case-control study to identified exposure factors, and used conditional logistic regression to analyze the data. We estimated vaccine effectiveness and vaccination coverage. RESULTS: We identified 81 cases (75 probable, 6 confirmed); 4 patients (4.9%) died. In the case-control study, 47% of case-patients and 2.3% of controls were hospitalized at Lyantonde Hospital pediatric department for non-measles conditions 7–21 days before case-patient’s onset (OR(adj) = 34, 95%CI: 5.1–225). Estimated vaccine effectiveness was 95% (95%CI: 75–99%) and vaccination coverage was 76% (95%CI: 68–82%). During the outbreak, an “isolation” ward was established inside the general pediatric ward where there was mixing of both measles and non-measles patients. CONCLUSIONS: This outbreak was amplified by nosocomial transmission and facilitated by low vaccination coverage. We recommended moving the isolation ward outside of the building, supplemental vaccination, and vaccinating pediatric patients during measles outbreaks.","Biribawa, Claire; Atuhairwe, Joselyn Annet; Bulage, Lilian; Okethwangu, Denis Othuba; Kwesiga, Benon; Ario, Alex Riolexus; Zhu, Bao-Ping",BMC Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7274507/,33
12193,Comparative study of imaging at 3.0 T versus 1.5 T of the knee,2009-04-07,"The performance of a full-scale (500 m(3)) sulfidogenic synthesis gas fed gas-lift reactor treating metal- and sulfate-rich wastewater was investigated over a period of 128 weeks. After startup, the reactor had a high methanogenic activity of 46 Nm(3)·h(−1). Lowering the carbon dioxide feed rate during the first 6 weeks gradually lowered the methane production rate. Between weeks 8 and 93, less than 1% of the hydrogen supplied was used for methanogenesis. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis of polymerase chain reaction-amplified 16S rRNA gene fragments showed that the archaeal community decreased in diversity but did not disappear completely. After the carbon dioxide feed rate increased in week 88, the methane production rate also increased, confirming that methane production was carbon dioxide limited. Even though lowering the carbon dioxide feed appeared to affect part of the sulfate-reducing community, it did not prevent achieving the desired rates of sulfate reduction. The average sulfate conversion rate was 181 kg∙h(−1) for the first 92 weeks. After 92 weeks, the sulfate input rate was increased and from week 94 to 128, the average weekly sulfate conversion rate was 295 kg·h(−1) (SD ± 87). Even higher sulfate conversion rates of up to 400 kg·h(−1) could be sustained for weeks 120–128. The long-term performance and stability together with the ability to control methanogenesis demonstrates that synthesis gas fed reactor can be used successfully at full scale to treat metal and sulfate-rich wastewater.","van Houten, Bernd H.

Puromycin has been used in molecular biology research for decades as a translation inhibitor. The development of puromycin antibodies and derivatized puromycin analogs has enabled the quantification of active translation in bulk and single-cell assays. More recently, in vivo puromycylation assays have become popular tools for localizing translating ribosomes in cells. These assays often use elongation inhibitors to purportedly inhibit the release of puromycin-labeled nascent peptides from ribosomes. Using in vitro and in vivo experiments in various eukaryotic systems, we demonstrate that, even in the presence of elongation inhibitors, puromycylated peptides are released and diffuse away from ribosomes. Puromycylation assays reveal subcellular sites, such as nuclei, where puromycylated peptides accumulate post-release and which do not necessarily coincide with sites of active translation. Our findings urge caution when interpreting puromycylation assays in vivo.","Enam, Syed Usman; Zinshteyn, Boris; Goldman, Daniel H; Cassani, Madeline; Livingston, Nathan M; Seydoux, Geraldine; Green, Rachel",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7490009/,33

13332,51st Annual Meeting of the Society of Gynecologic Oncology(),2020-10-18,"INTRODUCTION: Undisplaced femoral neck fractures (FNFs) are usually treated by internal fixation (IF) but two randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have demonstrated advantages of treatment with arthroplasty. The complication rate was lowered but there were no clinically improved patient-reported outcome measures (PROM), which could be due to underpowering or choice of selected PROM as the studies do appear to report a better functional outcome. We will conduct an RCT comparing IF with arthroplasties in patients aged over 65 years with an undisplaced FNF. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: All hospitals in Denmark treating patients with hip fracture can provide patients for this study; therefore, the study can be considered a national RCT. Patients over 65 years old with an undisplaced FNF will be screened for eligibility and patients will only be excluded if they are unable to understand the study information (due to dementia or language), if they have a posterior tilt >20°, a pathological fracture or they cannot walk. Participants will be electronically randomised (in alternating blocks of 4 or 6) into either IF or arthroplasty. Postoperative care will follow the department standards. Primary and secondary outcomes and measuring points have been established in collaboration with patients with hip fracture by focus group interviews. The primary outcome measure is the New Mobility Score assessed after 1 year. Secondary outcomes are the Oxford Hip Score, EuroQol 5 domain (EQ-5D-5L), degree of posterior tilt, pain Verbal Rating Scale, reoperation and mortality. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study is approved by the Danish Data Protection Agency (19/7429) and the scientific ethics committee (S-20180036).

13429,Current Insight of Collagen Biomatrix for Gingival Recession: An Evidence-Based Systematic Review,2020-09-13,"Recently, the research community has become increasingly concerned with the receptor αvβ5, a member of the well-known integrin family. Different ongoing studies have evidenced that αvβ5 integrin regulates not only physiological processes but also a wide array of pathological events, suggesting the receptor as a valuable biomarker to specifically target for therapeutic/diagnostic purposes. Remarkably, in some tumors the involvement of the receptor in cell proliferation, tumor dissemination and angiogenesis is well-documented. In this scenario, the availability of a selective αvβ5 antagonist without ‘off-target’ protein effects may improve survival rate in patients with highly aggressive tumors, such as hepatocellular carcinoma. We recently reported a cyclic peptide, RGDechi15D, obtained by structure-activity studies. To our knowledge it represents the first peptide-based molecule reported in the literature able to specifically bind αvβ5 integrin and not cross react with αvβ3. Here we demonstrated the ability of the peptide to diminish both adhesion and invasion of HepG2 cells, an in vitro model system for hepatocellular carcinoma, to reduce the cell proliferation through an apoptotic process, and to interfere with the PI3K pathway. The peptide, also decreases the formation of new vessels in endothelial cells. Taken together these results indicate that the peptide can be considered a promising molecule with properties suited to be assessed in the future for its validation as a selective therapeutic/diagnostic weapon in hepatocarcinoma.","Capasso, Domenica; Del Gatto, Annarita; Comegna, Daniela; Russo, Luigi; Fattorusso, Roberto; Saviano, Michele; Di Gaetano, Sonia; Zaccaro, Laura",Molecules,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7570809/,33
13508,The Influence of Essential Oils on Gut Microbial Profiles in Pigs,2020-09-24,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Wildlife conservation and management has become a very complex public policy issue in China as concerns about animal welfare and empathy for animals have emerged, especially in the younger generation. Science-based conservation policy and strategy that focus on sustainable management are perceived as less irrelevant today and can often be in conflict with emerging attitudes and values. Sustainable wildlife management adheres to the conservation concept of effective combination of species conservation and sustainable utilization, with an aim to establish a long-acting species conservation model that promotes all-round development of ecology, society, and economy, and has traditionally formed the basis of conservation management. This study designed a semi-structured questionnaire, which aimed to assess attitudes of Chinese college students towards sustainable wildlife management and wildlife conservation, and investigate the role of demographic and other characteristics on attitude. From October 2018 to April 2019, nine universities (including “Double First-Class” universities, first-tier universities, second-tier universities), and four three-year colleges in China were selected as survey sites, where face-to-face interviews were conducted among students. The results show that students broadly support the sustainable wildlife management but not in issues relating to “Animal Welfare and Rights” and “Trophy Hunting”. Students with lowest support for the theory and practice of sustainable wildlife management are vegetarians, freshmen, and those who have taken environmental protection electives in their educational program. ABSTRACT: Wildlife conservation and management has become a very complex public policy issue in China as concerns over on animal welfare and empathy for animals have grown. Science-based conservation strategies that are oriented toward sustainable wildlife management (SWM) are under threat as these new attitudes and values emerge and take hold. This study accesses the attitudes of college students towards SWM and wildlife conservation, and investigates demographic characteristics influencing their attitudes in China, a country that is traditionally associated with consumptive use of wildlife and SWM, but where new ideas about wildlife conservation are emerging. From October 2018 to April 2019, nine universities (including “Double First-Class” universities, first-tier universities, second-tier universities), and four three-year colleges in China were selected as survey locations, and face-to-face interviews were conducted with 1991 students. A total of 1977 questionnaires were recovered, of which 1739 were valid, with a completion rate of 88%. A Likert seven-point scale method was used to score students’ attitudes, and a classification and regression tree (CART) was used to analyze whether their attitudes were affected by their demographic characteristics. The results show that although students are broadly supportive of the theory of SWM, some are deeply antagonistic about on SWM on issues that arouse strong emotions such as “Animal Welfare and Rights” and “Trophy Hunting”. Demographic characteristics of students affect their degree of support for the SWM with support for SWM lower among vegetarians, freshmen, and students who have taken environmental protection electives. This research suggests that the theory of SWM requires to be refreshed and adapted to appeal to the younger generation of Chinese students, with SWM principles integrated into the environmental education programs of universities and three-year colleges. More attention should also be attached to media publicity by the government about wildlife conservation so as to enhance awareness of the need for SWM.","Miao, Zhen; Wang, Qiang; Chen, Dongxiao; Song, Zhifan; Zhang, Wei; Zhou, Xuehong; MacMillan, Douglas C.",Animals (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7599632/,33

METHODS: Complete ophthalmologic examination and echocardiography were performed in 36 patients with KD during the acute phase before starting the treatment. Clinical manifestations and laboratory data including white blood cell (WBC) count, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, platelet count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), and levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were obtained from all the patients. All the clinical and laboratory findings were compared between the group with ocular involvement and the one without ocular involvement. RESULTS: The incidence of bilateral non-exudative conjunctivitis was 63.9%. It was significantly higher in patients with skin rashes (P < 0.05). The incidence of uveitis was 36.1%, which consisted primarily of grade 1+ or 2+ acute anterior uveitis. Neutrophil count and CRP levels were significantly higher in the uveitis group than in the group without uveitis (P < 0.05). Coronary artery dilatation showed significant correlation with uveitis (P < 0.05). Uveitis did not show a significant correlation with other clinical manifestations, ESR, ALT level, AST level, and platelet count (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: In children with Kawasaki disease, uveitis is associated with coronary artery dilatation, higher neutrophil count, and higher CRP level.","Shiari, Reza; Jari, Mohsen; Karimi, Saeed; Salehpour, Omid; Rahmani, Khosro; Hassas Yeganeh, Mehrnoosh; Javadi Parvaneh, Vadood; Hajian, Shabnam; Ghasemi, Leyla; Safi, Sare",Eye (Lond),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7608242/,33

A comprehensive literature review was undertaken and guidelines were developed by clinicians with expertise from clinical genetics, gynaecology, endocrinology, dermatology, radiology, gastroenterology and general surgery, together with affected individuals and their representatives. Recommendations were put forward for surveillance for breast, thyroid and renal cancers. Limited recommendations were developed for other sites including endometrial, colon and skin. The proposed cancer surveillance recommendations for PHTS require a coordinated multidisciplinary approach and significant patient commitment. The evidence base for cancer surveillance in this guideline are limited, emphasising the need for prospective evaluation of the effectiveness of surveillance in the PHTS population.","Tischkowitz, Marc; Colas, Chrystelle; Pouwels, Sjaak; Hoogerbrugge, Nicoline",Eur J Hum Genet,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7608293/,33

An outstanding question is to what extent this heterogeneity is similar between cancers affecting different organs. Here, we profile 233,591 single cells from patients with lung, colorectal, ovary and breast cancer (n = 36) and construct a pan-cancer blueprint of stromal cell heterogeneity using different single-cell RNA and protein-based technologies. We identify 68 stromal cell populations, of which 46 are shared between cancer types and 22 are unique. We also characterise each population phenotypically by highlighting its marker genes, transcription factors, metabolic activities and tissue-specific expression differences. Resident cell types are characterised by substantial tissue specificity, while tumor-infiltrating cell types are largely shared across cancer types. Finally, by applying the blueprint to melanoma tumors treated with checkpoint immunotherapy and identifying a naïve CD4(+) T-cell phenotype predictive of response to checkpoint immunotherapy, we illustrate how it can serve as a guide to interpret scRNA-seq data. In conclusion, by providing a comprehensive blueprint through an interactive web server, we generate the first panoramic view on the shared complexity of stromal cells in different cancers.","Qian, Junbin; Olbrecht, Siel; Boeckx, Bram; Vos, Hanne; Laoui, Damya; Etlioglu, Emre; Wauters, Els; Pomella, Valentina; Verbandt, Sara; Busschaert, Pieter; Bassez, Ayse; Franken, Amelie; Bempt, Marlies Vanden; Xiong, Jieyi; Weynand, Birgit; van Herck, Yannick; Antoranz, Asier; Bosisio, Francesca Maria; Thienpont, Bernard; Floris, Giuseppe; Vergote, Ignace; Smeets, Ann; Tejpar, Sabine; Lambrechts, Diether",Cell Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7608385/,33

Zonula occludens (ZO) proteins are scaffolding molecules essential for the formation of TJ complexes, and abnormalities in ZO proteins have been implicated in various TJ-associated human diseases such as tumor invasion and metastasis, and barrier dysfunction. Recent studies reveal that liquid–liquid phase separation of ZO proteins drives the polymerization of TJ proteins into a continuous belt, which then recruits various proteins to form the TJ complex to regulate selective paracellular permeability and signal transduction. Herein, we describe recent advances on how ZO phase separation contributes to TJ formation and discuss the potential of phase separation as a target for the treatment of TJ-associated diseases.","Sun, Shuang; Zhou, Jun",Acta Pharmacol Sin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7608859/,33

In 2008 the European Molecular Genetics Quality Network (EMQN) for the first time offered a European-wide external quality assessment scheme for CAH (due to 21-OH deficiency). The interest was great and over the last years at about 60 laboratories from Europe, USA and Australia regularly participated in that scheme. These best practice guidelines were drafted on the basis of the extensive knowledge and experience got from those annually organized CAH-schemes. In order to obtain the widest possible consultation with practicing laboratories the draft was therefore circulated twice by EMQN to all laboratories participating in the EQA-scheme for CAH genotyping and was updated by that input. The present guidelines address quality requirements for diagnostic molecular genetic laboratories, as well as criteria for CYP21A2 genotyping (including carrier-testing and prenatal diagnosis). A key aspect of that article is the use of appropriate methodologies (e.g., sequencing methods, MLPA (multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification), mutation specific assays) and respective limitations and analytical accuracy. Moreover, these guidelines focus on classification of variants, and the interpretation and standardization of the reporting of CYP21A2 genotyping results. In addition, the article provides a comprehensive list of common as well as so far unreported CYP21A2-variants.","Baumgartner-Parzer, Sabina; Witsch-Baumgartner, Martina; Hoeppner, Wolfgang",Eur J Hum Genet,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7609334/,33

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The medical records of 1581 adult patients who underwent emergency gastrointestinal surgery between January 2013 and December 2018 were reviewed retrospectively. A total of 239 patients with sepsis or septic shock who were admitted to an emergency department, underwent emergency surgery for cIAI, and needed postoperative intensive care unit care were included and divided into two groups according to their initial blood and peritoneal culture results. RESULTS: Among the 239 patients, 200 were culture-negative and 39 were culture-positive. The culture-positive group had higher in-hospital (35.9% vs 14.5%; P = .001) and 30-day mortality (30.8% vs 12.0%; P = .003) than the culture-negative group. Colon involvement (OR 4.211; 95% CI 1.909–9.287; P < .001) and higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (OR 1.169; 95% CI 1.065–1.282; P = .001) were shown to be the predictors of culture-positive sepsis for cIAI. Regarding antibiotic sensitivity, 31.6% of the gram-positive bacteria were methicillin-resistant and 42.1% of the gram-negative bacteria were extended spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with cIAI had higher mortality rates in culture-positive sepsis than in culture-negative sepsis. High SOFA score and colon involvement were the risk factors associated with culture-positivity. The most common single species grown in the blood or peritoneal cultures was Escherichia coli, and the most common group was Gram-positive cocci.

Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are an alternative type of biomolecules, naturally present in a wide variety of organisms, with the capacity to overcome the current microorganism resistance threat. Here, we reviewed our recent efforts to develop a new library of non-rationally produced AMPs that relies on bacterial genome inherent diversity and compared it with rationally designed libraries. Our approach is based on a four-stage workflow process that incorporates the interplay of recent developments in four major emerging technologies: artificial intelligence, molecular dynamics, surface-display in microorganisms, and microfluidics. Implementing this framework is challenging because to obtain reliable results, the in silico algorithms to search for candidate AMPs need to overcome issues of the state-of-the-art approaches that limit the possibilities for multi-space data distribution analyses in extremely large databases. We expect to tackle this challenge by using a recently developed classification algorithm based on deep learning models that rely on convolutional layers and gated recurrent units. This will be complemented by carefully tailored molecular dynamics simulations to elucidate specific interactions with lipid bilayers. Candidate AMPs will be recombinantly-expressed on the surface of microorganisms for further screening via different droplet-based microfluidic-based strategies to identify AMPs with the desired lytic abilities. We believe that the proposed approach opens opportunities for searching and screening bioactive peptides for other applications.","Puentes, Paola Ruiz; Henao, María C.; Torres, Carlos E.; Gómez, Saúl C.; Gómez, Laura A.; Burgos, Juan C.; Arbeláez, Pablo; Osma, Johann F.; Muñoz-Camargo, Carolina; Reyes, Luis H.; Cruz, Juan C.",Antibiotics (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7759991/,33

However, certain biological features tend to be overlooked in evaluating a gene’s popularity. Here we present a meta-analysis of the reasons why different genes have been studied and to what extent, with a focus on the gene-specific biological features. From unbiased datasets we can define biological properties of genes that reasonably may affect their perceived importance. We make use of both linear and nonlinear computational approaches for estimating gene popularity to then compare their relative importance. We find that roughly 25% of the studies are the result of a historical positive feedback, which we may think of as social reinforcement. Of the remaining features, gene family membership is the most indicative followed by disease relevance and finally regulatory pathway association. Disease relevance has been an important driver until the 1990s, after which the focus shifted to exploring every single gene. We also present a resource that allows one to study the impact of reinforcement, which may guide our research toward genes that have not yet received proportional attention.","Mihai, Ionut Sebastian; Das, Debojyoti; Maršalkaite, Gabija; Henriksson, Johan",Genes (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7926953/,33

In line with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals 2030, these policies require that any new material or product should be not only functional and cost-effective but also safe and sustainable to ensure compliance with regulation and acceptance by consumers. Nanotechnology is one of the technologies that could enable such a green growth. This paper focuses on advanced nanomaterials that actively respond to external stimuli, also known as ‘smart nanomaterials’, and which are already on the market or in the research and development phase for non-medical applications such as in agriculture, food, food packaging and cosmetics. A review shows that smart nanomaterials and enabled products may present new challenges for safety and sustainability assessment due to their complexity and dynamic behaviour. Moreover, existing regulatory frameworks, in particular in the European Union, are probably not fully prepared to address them. What is missing today is a systematic and comprehensive approach that allows for considering sustainability aspects hand in hand with safety considerations very early on at the material design stage. We call on innovators, scientists and authorities to further develop and promote the ‘Safe- and Sustainable-by-Design’ concept in nanotechnology and propose some initiatives to go into this direction.","Gottardo, Stefania; Mech, Agnieszka; Drbohlavová, Jana; Małyska, Aleksandra; Bøwadt, Søren; Riego Sintes, Juan; Rauscher, Hubert",NanoImpact,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7941606/,33

METHODS: Retrospective study of 67 stridor cases in pediatric age group (from birth to 18 y), admitted to the Department of Pediatrics and ENT (Ear, Nose and Throat) from May 2018 to April 2020 were included in the study. Data were obtained from medical records regarding age, gender, clinical presentation, and management. RESULTS: Out of 67 cases of pediatric stridor, 28.3% were infants, 50.7% were between 1 to 5 y, while 20.9% were between 5 to 18 y. Foreign body trachea (FB) was the most common (38.8%) cause of stridor. The commonest cause of stridor among infants was laryngomalacia (47.4%) while FB trachea (55.9%) was the commonest cause among 1 to 5 y age group. In age group between 5 to 18 y, peritonsillar abscess and bacterial tracheitis (21.4% each) were found to be the most common. Primary management with securing of airways were done in all cases. Curative treatment was provided according to the underlying pathology. Eight patients (11.9%) required tracheostomy to bypass airway obstruction. There was no mortality in the present study population. CONCLUSION: Pediatric stridor management is a teamwork between ENT surgeons, pediatricians, and anaesthetists.

Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-Associated Vasculitis (AAV) is an autoimmune disease characterised by necrotising inflammation of small blood vessels. The underlying biology of AAV is not well understood, however several studies have noted abnormalities in type I IFN responses. We hypothesised that type I IFN responses are systemically dysregulated in AAV, consistent with features of a type I interferonopathy. To investigate this, we measured the expression of seven interferon regulated genes (IRGs) (ISG15, SIGLEC1, STAT1, RSAD2, IFI27, IFI44L and IFIT1) in peripheral blood samples, as well as three type I IFN regulated proteins (CXCL10, MCP-1 and CCL19) in serum samples from AAV patients, healthy controls and disease controls. We found no difference in type I IFN regulated gene or protein expression between AAV patients and healthy controls. Furthermore, IRG and IFN regulated protein expression did not correlate with clinical measurements of disease activity in AAV patients. Thus, we conclude that systemic type I IFN responses are not key drivers of AAV pathogenesis and AAV should not be considered a type I interferonopathy.","Batten, Isabella; Robinson, Mark W.; White, Arthur; Walsh, Cathal; Fazekas, Barbara; Wyse, Jason; Buettner, Antonia; D’Arcy, Suzanne; Greenan, Emily; Murphy, Conor C.; Wigston, Zoe; Gabhann-Dromgoole, Joan Ní; Vital, Edward M.; Little, Mark A.; Bourke, Nollaig M.",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8050071/,33

17937,Angiogenesis: a year in review,2021-05-29,"BACKGROUND: A conformational epitope (CE) is composed of neighboring amino acid residues located on an antigenic protein surface structure. CEs bind their complementary paratopes in B-cell receptors and/or antibodies. An effective and efficient prediction tool for CE analysis is critical for the development of immunology-related applications, such as vaccine design and disease diagnosis. RESULTS: We propose a novel method consisting of two sequential modules: matching and prediction. The matching module includes two main approaches. The first approach is a complete sequence search (CSS) that applies BLAST to align the sequence with all known antigen sequences. Fragments with high epitope sequence identities are identified and the predicted residues are annotated on the query structure. The second approach is a spiral vector search (SVS) that adopts a novel surface spiral feature vector for large-scale surface patch detection when queried against a comprehensive epitope database. The prediction module also contains two proposed subsystems. The first system is based on knowledge-based energy and geometrical neighboring residue contents, and the second system adopts combinatorial features, including amino acid contents and physicochemical characteristics, to formulate corresponding geometric spiral vectors and compare them with all spiral vectors from known CEs. An integrated testing dataset was generated for method evaluation, and our two searching methods effectively identified all epitope regions. The prediction results show that our proposed method outperforms previously published systems in terms of sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed method significantly improves the performance of traditional epitope prediction. Matching followed by prediction is an efficient and effective approach compared to predicting directly on specific surfaces containing antigenic characteristics.","Lo, Ying-Tsang; Shih, Tao-Chuan; Pai, Tun-Wen; Ho, Li-Ping; Wu, Jen-Leih; Chou, Hsin-Yiu",BMC Genomics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8165135/,33

Evidence from the field demonstrates that vector control can have a large impact on program outcomes and even halt transmission entirely, but implementation is expensive. Models of LF have the potential to inform where and when resources should be focused, but often simplify vector dynamics and focus on capturing human prevalence trends, making them comparatively ill-designed for direct analysis of vector control measures.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate current checklists and evidence on home hazard to develop a usable self-administered checklist that could be used by adults to assess home hazards. DESIGN: Review and observational, prospective study. Setting. Community dwelling. Participants. Nine adults (4 men, 5 women) were asked to review the checklist and provide feedback on whether items were relevant, comprehensive, and easy to understand. Intervention. A search for literature examining the causes of falls that focused on home hazards or behaviours was conducted, and causes were extracted. Using the combined list of home hazards, a draft checklist was created. The participants were asked to pilot the checklist through their home. Primary and Secondary Outcome. An initial iteration of the checklist was modified to reduce redundancy (by grouping certain items together), improve usability (by adding a “not applicable category”), and improve readability (by removing double-barrelled questions or rewriting certain items). RESULTS: This process resulted in 74 items in 10 areas. On average, it took 10 minutes for the participants to complete the home walk-through while filling out the checklist. CONCLUSION: The fall hazard-home checklist is a new checklist designed to identify home fall hazards with the intended use of being either administered by self-report through memory or supported by a walk-about, and that could potentially be completed by a patient who has incurred a fall, fracture, a family member, or caregiver. Given the expense of home hazard assessments that involve a home visit, the validity of this method of detection warrants further investigation.","Ziebart, Christina; Dewan, Neha; Tuazon, Joshua; MacDermid, Joy",Rehabil Res Pract,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8187056/,33

Patients were compared to a consecutive cohort of patients who underwent AF ablation in the 3 months prior to the study. Primary efficacy was assessed by using a visual analog scale, summarizing the overall pain experienced during the ablation. RESULTS: The AF cryoablation procedure with VR was performed for 48 patients (mean age 63.0, SD 10.9 years; n=16, 33.3% females). No patient refused to use the device, although 14.6% (n=7) terminated the VR session prematurely. Preparation of the VR headset took on average 78 (SD 13) seconds. Compared to the control group, the mean perceived pain, assessed with the visual analog scale, was lower in the VR group (3.5 [SD 1.5] vs 4.3 [SD 1.6]; P=.004), and comfort was higher in the VR group (7.5 [SD 1.6] vs 6.8 [SD 1.7]; P=.03). On the other hand, morphine consumption was not different between the groups. Lastly, complications, as well as procedure and fluoroscopy duration, were not different between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: We found that VR was associated with a reduction in the perception of pain in patients undergoing AF ablation under conscious sedation. Our findings demonstrate that VR can be easily incorporated into the standard ablation workflow.","Roxburgh, Thomas; Li, Anthony; Guenancia, Charles; Pernollet, Patrice; Bouleti, Claire; Alos, Benjamin; Gras, Matthieu; Kerforne, Thomas; Frasca, Denis; Le Gal, François; Christiaens, Luc; Degand, Bruno; Garcia, Rodrigue",J Med Internet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8193475/,33

Using field, remote sensing (i.e. UAV and LiDAR), and numerical methods, we gathered primary data to generate well-constrained observed information on dune bedform characteristics, impact dynamic pressures and velocities of base surges. This is to advance our knowledge on this type of hazard to understand and evaluate its consequences and risks. The dilute and wet surges traveled at 50-60 ms(−1) near the crater rim and decelerated before making impact on coastal communities with dynamic pressures of at least 1.7 kPa. The base surges killed more than a thousand livestock in the southeast of Taal Volcano Island, and then traveled another ~ 600 m offshore. This work is a rare document of a complete, fresh, and practically undisturbed base surge deposit, important in the study of dune deposits formed by volcanic and other processes on Earth and other planets.","Lagmay, A.

19911,Current standards and ethical landscape of engineered tissues—3D bioprinting perspective,2021-07-29,"BACKGROUND: Aspiration pneumonia is a serious and fatal complication of dysphagia, secondary to the ingestion of bacteria-laden secretions. However, no studies have documented the oral hygiene features present in patients who present with dysphagia. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to describe the oral hygiene problems of adults admitted to a sub-acute rehabilitation hospital and who presented with dysphagia. METHODS: A descriptive, cross-sectional survey was conducted, during which 40 participants – 57.5% (n = 23) male and 42.5% (n = 17) female – underwent a clinical swallow evaluation using the Mann Assessment of Swallowing Ability (MASA) augmented with cervical auscultation (CA) and pulse oximetry (PO), an oral hygiene assessment using an adapted version of the Oral Health Assessment Tool (OHAT), followed by microbiology laboratory analysis of buccal swab samples to detect bacteria not considered part of the normal oral flora. RESULTS: Results indicated that poor oral hygiene status was a common feature amongst all participants who presented with dysphagia. The most prevalent oral hygiene issues were related to abnormalities concerning saliva (60%), oral cleanliness (82.5%), the tongue (80%) and the use of dentures (71.4%). A high prevalence, 62.5% (n = 25), of opportunistic bacteria was found. The most commonly occurring bacteria groups were: (1) Candida albicans (47.5%) and (2) respiratory pathogens (37.5%) such as Klebsiella pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus. CONCLUSION: Persons with dysphagia have poor oral hygiene which creates favourable environments for bacteria to flourish and increases the prevalence of pathogenic oral bacteria associated with the development of aspiration pneumonia. The management of oral health issues for persons with dysphagia should receive greater attention during hospitalisation.","Weimers, Merryl J.; Pillay, Mershen",S Afr J Commun Disord,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8335773/,33
20174,Gravity-induced loss of aeration and atelectasis development in the preterm lung: a serial sonographic assessment,2021-08-20,"BACKGROUND: To meet the growing importance of real-word data analysis, clinical data and biosamples must be timely made available. Feasibility platforms are often the first contact point for determining the availability of such data for specific research questions. Therefore, a user-friendly interface should be provided to enable access to this information easily. The German Medical Informatics Initiative also aims to establish such a platform for its infrastructure. Although some of these platforms are actively used, their tools still have limitations. Consequently, the Medical Informatics Initiative consortium MIRACUM (Medical Informatics in Research and Care in University Medicine) committed itself to analyzing the pros and cons of existing solutions and to designing an optimized graphical feasibility user interface. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to identify the system that is most user-friendly and thus forms the best basis for developing a harmonized tool. To achieve this goal, we carried out a comparative usability evaluation of existing tools used by researchers acting as end users. METHODS: The evaluation included three preselected search tools and was conducted as a qualitative exploratory study with a randomized design over a period of 6 weeks. The tools in question were the MIRACUM i2b2 (Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside) feasibility platform, OHDSI’s (Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics) ATLAS, and the Sample Locator of the German Biobank Alliance. The evaluation was conducted in the form of a web-based usability test (usability walkthrough combined with a web-based questionnaire) with participants aged between 26 and 63 years who work as medical doctors. RESULTS: In total, 17 study participants evaluated the three tools. The overall evaluation of usability, which was based on the System Usability Scale, showed that the Sample Locator, with a mean System Usability Scale score of 77.03 (SD 20.62), was significantly superior to the other two tools (Wilcoxon test; Sample Locator vs i2b2: P=.047; Sample Locator vs ATLAS: P=.001). i2b2, with a score of 59.83 (SD 25.36), performed significantly better than ATLAS, which had a score of 27.81 (SD 21.79; Wilcoxon test; i2b2 vs ATLAS: P=.005). The analysis of the material generated by the usability walkthrough method confirmed these findings. ATLAS caused the most usability problems (n=66), followed by i2b2 (n=48) and the Sample Locator (n=22). Moreover, the Sample Locator achieved the highest ratings with respect to additional questions regarding satisfaction with the tools. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides data to develop a suitable basis for the selection of a harmonized tool for feasibility studies via concrete evaluation and a comparison of the usability of three different types of query builders. The feedback obtained from the participants during the usability test made it possible to identify user problems and positive design aspects of the individual tools and compare them qualitatively.","Schüttler, Christina; Prokosch, Hans-Ulrich; Sedlmayr, Martin; Sedlmayr, Brita",JMIR Med Inform,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8339981/,33
20188,Strengthening Antimicrobial Resistance Diagnostic Capacity in Rural Rwanda: A Feasibility Assessment,2021-08-06,"BACKGROUND: Combining an immune checkpoint inhibitor with a tumor vaccine may modulate the immune system to leverage complementary mechanisms of action that lead to sustained T-cell activation and a potent prolonged immunotherapeutic response in metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). METHODS: Subjects with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic mCRPC were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either atezolizumab followed by sipuleucel-T (Arm 1) or sipuleucel-T followed by atezolizumab (Arm 2). The primary endpoint was safety, while secondary endpoints included preliminary clinical activity such as objective tumor response and systemic immune responses that could identify key molecular and immunological changes associated with sequential administration of atezolizumab and sipuleucel-T. RESULTS: A total of 37 subjects were enrolled. The median age was 75.0 years, median prostate specific antigen (PSA) was 21.9 ng/mL, and subjects had a median number of three prior treatments. Most subjects (83.8%) had at least one treatment-related adverse event. There were no grade 4 or 5 toxicities attributed to either study drug. Immune-related adverse events and infusion reactions occurred in 13.5% of subjects, and all of which were grade 1 or 2. Of 23 subjects with Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors measurable disease, only one subject in Arm 2 had a partial response (PR) and four subjects overall had stable disease (SD) at 6 months reflecting an objective response rate of 4.3% and a disease control rate of 21.7%. T-cell receptor diversity was higher in subjects with a response, including SD. Immune response to three novel putative antigens (SIK3, KDM1A/LSD1, and PIK3R6) appeared to increase with treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, regardless of the order in which they were administered, the combination of atezolizumab with sipuleucel-T appears to be safe and well tolerated with a comparable safety profile to each agent administered as monotherapy. Correlative immune studies may suggest the combination to be beneficial; however, further studies are needed.

20627,Endoscopy in patients on antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy: British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) and European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) guideline update,2021-08-06,"BACKGROUND: The autonomic nervous system (ANS) maintains physiological homeostasis in various organ systems via parasympathetic and sympathetic branches. ANS function is altered in common diffuse and focal conditions and heralds the beginning of environmental and disease stresses. Reliable, sensitive, and quantitative biomarkers, first defined in healthy participants, could discriminate among clinically useful changes in ANS function. This framework combines controlled autonomic testing with feature extraction during physiological responses. METHODS: Twenty-one individuals were assessed in two morning and two afternoon sessions over two weeks. Each session included five standard clinical tests probing autonomic function: squat test, cold pressor test, diving reflex test, deep breathing, and Valsalva maneuver. Noninvasive sensors captured continuous electrocardiography, blood pressure, breathing, electrodermal activity, and pupil diameter. Heart rate, heart rate variability, mean arterial pressure, electrodermal activity, and pupil diameter responses to the perturbations were extracted, and averages across participants were computed. A template matching algorithm calculated scaling and stretching features that optimally fit the average to an individual response. These features were grouped based on test and modality to derive sympathetic and parasympathetic indices for this healthy population. RESULTS: A significant positive correlation (p = 0.000377) was found between sympathetic amplitude response and body mass index. Additionally, longer duration and larger amplitude sympathetic and longer duration parasympathetic responses occurred in afternoon testing sessions; larger amplitude parasympathetic responses occurred in morning sessions. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate the robustness and sensitivity of an algorithmic approach to extract multimodal responses from standard tests. This novel method of quantifying ANS function can be used for early diagnosis, measurement of disease progression, or treatment evaluation.

20693,Quantifying malaria acquired during travel and its role in malaria elimination on Bioko Island,2021-08-30,"Cryopreservation, the most common method of preserving stem cells, requires post-processing because it produces trauma to the cells. Post-thawing trauma typically induces cell death, elevates reactive oxygen species (ROS) concentration, and lowers mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). Although this trauma has been solved using antioxidants, we attempted to use photobiomodulation (PBM) instead of chemical treatment. We used a 950-nm near-infrared LED to create a PBM device and chose a pulsed-wave mode of 30 Hz and a 30% duty cycle. Near-infrared radiation (NIR) at 950 nm was effective in reducing cell death caused by hydrogen peroxide induced-oxidative stress. Cryodamage also leads to apoptosis of cells, which can be avoided by irradiation at 950 nm NIR. Irradiation as post-processing for cryopreservation had an antioxidant effect that reduced both cellular and mitochondrial ROS. It also increased mitochondrial mass and activated mitochondrial activity, resulting in increased MMP, ATP generation, and increased cytochrome c oxidase activity. In addition, NIR increased alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, a biomarker of differentiation. As a result, we identified that 950 nm NIR PBM solves cryodamage in human stem cells from the apical papilla, indicating its potential as an alternative to antioxidants for treatment of post-thawing trauma, and further estimated its mechanism.","Choi, Woori; Baik, Ku Youn; Jeong, Seung; Park, Sangbae; Kim, Jae Eun; Kim, Hong Bae; Chung, Jong Hoon",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8405638/,33
20856,Molluscicides against the snail-intermediate host of Schistosoma: a review,2021-09-06,"Introduction: Asphyxia is an emergent condition in neonates that may influence the function of the nervous system. Research has shown that intestinal microbiota is very important for neurodevelopment. Studies regarding the association between gut microbiota and neurodevelopment outcome in asphyxiated newborns remain scarce. Objective: To study the microbial characteristics of asphyxiated neonates within 1 week of life and to investigate their relationship with neural development at 6 months. Methods: The feces produced on days 1, 3, and 5, and the clinical data of full-term neonates with asphyxia and without asphyxia, delivered from March 2019 to October 2020 at Peking University First Hospital, were collected. We used 16S ribosomal deoxyribonucleic acid amplicon sequencing to detect the intestinal microbiota of asphyxiated neonates and neonates in the control group. We followed up asphyxiated neonates for 6 months and used the Ages and Stages Questionnaires-3 (ASQ-3) to evaluate their development. Results: A total of 45 neonates were enrolled in the study group and 32 were enrolled in the control group. On day 1, the diversity and richness of the microflora of the study group were more than those of the control group. Non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis showed significant differences in the microbiota of the two groups on days 1, 3, and 5. At the phylum level, the main microflora of the two groups were not different. At the genus level, the study group had increased relative abundance of Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1, Lachnoclostridium, Fusicatenibacter, etc. on day 1. On day 3, the relative abundance of Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1, Fusicatenibacter, etc. was still greater than that of the control group, and the relative abundance of Staphylococcus was less than that of the control group. On day 5, the relative abundance of Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1 and Lachnoclostridium was still higher than that of the control group, and the relative abundance of Dubosiella in the study group was significantly increased. At the species level, on day 3, the relative abundance of Staphylococcus caprae in the study group was less than that in the control group. Linear discriminant analysis effect size showed that the microbiota of the study group mainly consisted of Lachnospiraceae and Clostridia on day 1 and Clostridia on day 3. In the control group, Staphylococcus was the dominant bacterium on day 3. Neonates in the study group were followed up for 6 months, and the communication score of ASQ-3 was negatively correlated with the relative abundance of Lachnospiraceae and Clostridia on day 1. Conclusion: The diversity and richness of the microbiota of asphyxiated neonates on the first day of life were significantly increased and mainly consisted of pathogenic flora. Lachnospiraceae and Clostridia found in neonates with asphyxia on day 1 of life may be related to neural development at 6 months.","Zhang, Xiaojiao; Liu, Lili; Bai, Wei; Han, Ying; Hou, Xinlin",Front Pediatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8419515/,33

The present study aimed to determine the knowledge, attitude, and practice toward antibiotic use among the Syrian population. Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted at the outpatient clinics of two major hospitals in Damascus, Syria. Applying a random convenience sampling, data were collected in a 1-week period by interviewing participants using a structured questionnaire, which targeted demographics, practice, knowledge, and attitude. Data were used to assess the relationship between the knowledge level and attitudes and demographics. Results Most respondents had a moderate level of knowledge (187, 74.8%) and a moderate attitude score (148, 59.2%). In addition, most respondents (149, 59.6%) stated that they take antibiotics based on pharmacist advice only and do not complete the full antibiotic course (200, 80%). A significant association was found between the knowledge level and financial status ( p -value = 0.003), education level ( p -value = 0.001), and having relatives working in the health care sector ( p -value = 0.021). In addition, a significant association was found between the attitude and having health insurance. Conclusion This study provides baseline evidence about the knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding antibiotics among the Syrian population, that will help in designing targeted interventions to solve the inappropriate use of antibiotics.","Altorkmani, Abdallah; Alzabibi, Mhd Amin; Shibani, Mosa; Ismail, Hlma; Sawaf, Bisher; Daher, Nizar; Al-Moujahed, Ahmad",Avicenna J Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8500066/,33
22343,ACRT‐AFMR‐SCTS annual meeting abstracts,2011-04-01,"BACKGROUND: Institution-specific guidelines (ISGs) within the framework of antimicrobial stewardship programs offer locally tailored decision support taking into account local pathogen and resistance epidemiology as well as national and international guidelines. OBJECTIVES: To assess the impact of ISGs for antimicrobial therapy on antibiotic consumption and subsequent changes in resistance rates and Clostridioides difficile infections (CDIs). METHODS: The study was conducted at the Leipzig University Hospital, a 1,451-bed tertiary-care medical center, and covered the years 2012 to 2020. Since 2014, ISGs were provided to optimize empirical therapies, appropriate diagnostics, and antimicrobial prophylaxis. We used interrupted time series analysis (ITSA) and simple linear regression to analyze changes in antimicrobial consumption, resistance and CDIs. RESULTS: Over the study period, 1,672,200 defined daily doses (DDD) of antibiotics were dispensed, and 85,645 bacterial isolates as well as 2,576 positive C. difficile cultures were collected. Total antimicrobial consumption decreased by 14% from 2012 to 2020, without clear impact of the deployment of ISGs. However, implementation of ISGs was associated with significant decreases in the use of substances that were rarely recommended (e.g., fluoroquinolones). Over the whole study period, we observed declining resistance rates to most antibiotic classes of up to 25% in Enterobacterales, staphylococci, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Switching from ceftriaxone to cefotaxime was associated with reduced resistance to third-generation cephalosporins. The number of CDI cases fell by 65%, from 501 in 2012 to 174 in 2020. CONCLUSIONS: Well-implemented ISGs can have a significant, immediate, and lasting impact on the prescription behavior. ISGs might thereby contribute to reduce resistance rates and CDI incidences in the hospital setting.","Schönherr, Sebastian G.; Ranft, Donald; Lippmann, Norman; Lübbert, Christoph",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8516227/,33

22769,New Products,2006,"PCR quantification is regarded as one of the most promising techniques for real-time identification of bio-aerosols. We have, therefore, validated a QPCR assay for quantification of a viral aerosol sample using the double-stranded DNA-binding dye SYBR green I, an economical alternative for quantification of target microorganisms. To achieve this objective we used mycobacteriophage D29 as model organism. Phage D29 aerosol was produced in an aerosol cabinet and then collected by use of an AGI liquid sampler. A standard curve was created by use of purified genomic DNA from the phage in liquid culture of known concentration measured by titration. To prevent false-positive results caused by formation of primer–dimers, an additional data-acquisition step was added to the three-step QPCR procedure; the new technique was called four-step QPCR. The standard curve was then used to quantify the total amount of phage D29 in liquid culture and aerosol samples. For liquid culture samples there was no significant difference (P > 0.05) between results from quantification of the virus using double-agar culture and QPCR. For aerosol samples, however, the result determined by the QPCR method was significantly (P < 0.05) higher than that from the double-agar culture method. The four-step SYBR green I QPCR method is a quick quantitative method for mycobacteriophage D29 aerosol. We believe that QPCR using SYBR green I dye will be an economical method for detection of airborne bio-aerosols.","Wen, Zhanbo; Yu, Long; Yang, Wenhui; Wang, Jie; Zhao, Jianjun; Li, Na; Lu, Jianchun; Li, Jinsong",Aerobiologia (Bologna),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7087933/,33

Here we review how these trait-mediated indirect effects of parasites can alter the outcomes of invader-native interactions, illustrating with examples from the literature and with particular regard to the invader-native crustacean systems studied in our laboratories. Parasites may potentially inhibit or exacerbate invasions via their effects on host behaviour, in addition to their direct virulence effects on hosts. In several crustacean systems, we have found that parasites influence both host predation rates on intra- and inter-guild prey and host vulnerability to being preyed upon. These trait effects can theoretically alter invasion impact and patterns of coexistence, as they indirectly affect interactions between predators and prey with the potential for further ramifications to other species in the food web. The fitness consequences of parasite-induced trait-mediated effects are rarely considered in traditional parasitological contexts, but demand attention in the context of ecological communities. We can regard these trait effects as a form of cryptic virulence that only becomes apparent when hosts are examined in the context of the other species with which they interact.","Hatcher, Melanie J.; Dick, Jaimie T.

In addition to serving as the physical barrier to these toxic agents, intact epithelia also are major sources of various macromolecules including antimicrobial agents, antioxidants and antiproteases [3, 4] as well as proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines that initiate and amplify host defensive responses to these toxic agents [5]. Airway epithelial cells can be categorized as either ciliated or secretory [6]. Secretory cells, such as goblet cells and Clara cells, are responsible for the production and secretion of mucus along the apical epithelial surface and, in conjunction with ciliated cells, for the regulation of airway surface liquid viscosity. In addition, submucosal mucus glands connect to the airway lumen through a ciliated duct that propels mucins outward. These glands are present in the larger airways between bands of smooth muscle and cartilage. See Fig. 1.","Kim, Victor; Kato, Kosuke; Kim, K.

25178,Human Subjects Research in Bioemergencies,2018-07-07,"In our globalised, fast-changing world (deforestation, fast-growing animal protein demand, etc.), animal diseases that have an impact on public health, livelihoods, food security as well as the international trade of products of animal origin are constantly emerging or re-emerging. The complexity of disease emergencies calls for the identification of often collaborative effective strategies, based on both science and proven practical experience, to reduce future threats. The H(5)N(1) avian influenza crisis has shown how crucial it is to address persistent global threats at the interface between humans, animals and ecosystems which requires (i) to strengthen animal and human health institutions and (ii) build strong partnerships among players who may have different perspectives on some issues and different levels of resources. To address the gaps in the animal health sector, OIE seeks to build member countries’ capacities in policy design and good governance in animal health systems and Veterinary Services. At policy level, the OIE helps its members to enhance their credibility, both at the national and international level, by providing them with efficient tools, such as the strategic planning tools of the Performance of Veterinary Services (PVS) Pathway, with the objective to attract more commitment and more resources from their decision makers and partners. At good governance level, it provides science-based guidance that supports members in detecting, preventing and managing serious animal disease outbreaks through improved surveillance systems, strengthened laboratory networks and improved legislation. OIE promotes strong partnerships, notably with FAO and WHO, especially with regard to two topics that are getting currently a great attention and that require a strong multi-sectoral collaboration at all levels because of their social, economical and ecological determinants: rabies in humans that still kills more than 50,000 persons every year, mainly in Asia and mostly youngsters, and that is believed to be totally preventable through effective dog vaccination, and antimicrobial resistance that can hinder the effective treatment and recovery of illnesses in both humans and animals. At regional level and in full collaboration with ASEAN and other partners, the OIE Sub-Regional Representation (OIESRR) for Southeast Asia plays a significant role in regional coordination of animal health and emerging infectious disease management in a region that is often considered as a ‘hotspot’ for emergence. Along the strategic objectives of the OIE Fifth Strategic Plan, the implementation of its activities to achieve the OIE Strategic Objectives is supported by various programmes and projects funded by donors. Its long-standing flagship regional programme, the Southeast Asia and China Foot-and-Mouth Disease (SEACFMD) Campaign which aims at controlling FMD by 2020 through vaccination promotes socio-economical and participatory approaches as well as assessment of the role of wildlife.","Bouchot, Alexandre; Bordier, Marion",Socio-Ecological Dimensions of Infectious Diseases in Southeast Asia,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121704/,33
25240,Bio-kernel Self-organizing Map for HIV Drug Resistance Classification,2005,"Social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook implement filters to detect fake news as they foresee their transition from social media platform to primary sources of news. The robustness of such filters lies in the variety and the quality of the data used to train them. There is, therefore, a need for a tool that automatically generates fake but realistic news. In this paper, we propose a deep learning model that automatically generates news headlines. The model is trained with a corpus of existing headlines from different topics. Once trained, the model generates a fake but realistic headline given a seed and a topic. For example, given the seed “Kim Jong Un” and the topic “Business”, the model generates the headline “kim jong un says climate change is already making money”. In order to better capture and leverage the syntactic structure of the headlines for the task of synthetic headline generation, we extend the architecture - Contextual Long Short Term Memory, proposed by Ghosh et al. - to also learn a part-of-speech model. We empirically and comparatively evaluate the performance of the proposed model on a real corpora of headlines. We compare our proposed approach and its variants using Long Short Term Memory and Gated Recurrent Units as the building blocks. We evaluate and compare the topical coherence of the generated headlines using a state-of-the-art classifier. We, also, evaluate the quality of the generated headline using a machine translation quality metric and its novelty using a metric we propose for this purpose. We show that the proposed model is practical and competitively efficient and effective.","Dandekar, Ashish; Zen, Remmy A.

25328,3 Medische microbiologie,2007,"Traditional therapeutic approaches for the treatment and control of hypertension are effective in normalizing blood pressure (BP) in less than a third of patients with hypertension. These pharmacological approaches may have reached a plateau in their effectiveness and newer strategies need to be investigated to not only increase the number of patients achieving BP control, but to find ways to cure the disease instead of just manage it. Since completion of the Human Genome Project and the continuous advancement of gene delivery systems, it is now possible to investigate genetic means for the treatment and possible cure for hypertension. In this review, we discuss potential genetic targeting for treatment of hypertension. There are two generalized gene transfer approaches that have been used successfully for hypertension. One is an induction approach where genes that lower blood pressure are overexpressed. A second method is a reduction approach where products of genes that are known to increase blood pressure are decreased. There are a variety of methods that have been utilized to meet these objectives, such as “knockout” and “ knock-in” animal models, and the use of sense and antisense (AS) technology. This review will focus on the sense and antisense applications, and how this technique is becoming more refined and precise through the targeting of specific tissues, the regulation and induction of components of the system, and use of other newer technologies, such as short interfering RNA (siRNA). Our lab has generally focused on the reduction approach, specifically in the genetic manipulation of components of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). This system not only modulates BP, but has also been implicated in cardiac hypertrophy and morphology and in insulin resistance, which is highly correlated with hypertension. We will also discuss how new genes can be identified and subsequently serve as targets for the treatment of human hypertension.","Katovich, Michael J.; Grobe, Justin L.; Raizada, Mohan K.",Cardiovascular Genomics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121894/,33

While both a positive and a negative role of different heat shock proteins (HSP) in the control of virus replication has been hypothesized, HSP function during the virus replication cycle is still not well understood. This chapter describes different aspects of the interactions between viruses and heat shock proteins during infection of mammalian cells: the first part focuses on the modulation of the heat shock response by human viral pathogens; the second describes the interactions of HSP and other chaperones with viral components, and their function during different steps of the virus replication cycle; the last part summarizes our knowledge on the effect of hyperthermia and HSR modulators on virus replication.","Santoro, M.

Despite this, it is unclear whether fever itself is truly the enemy or whether, in fact, the febrile response represents an important means to help the body fight infection. Furthermore, it is unclear whether the administration of antipyretic medications or physical cooling measures to patients with fever and infection is beneficial or harmful [2, 3]. Here, we review the biology of fever, the significance of the febrile response in animals and humans, and the current evidence-base regarding the utility of treating fever in intensive care patients with infectious diseases.","Young, P.; Saxena, M.",Annual Update in Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine 2014,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122612/,33
26033,"Fate of the Mongooses and the Genet (Carnivora) in Mediterranean Europe: None Native, All Invasive?",2015-09-21,"“Poisons” were originally considered as the causative agents of illnesses that we know as viral diseases today. At that time, there were no standard methods to detect pathogenic (disease-causing) organisms such as bacteria and protozoa in the supposed “poisonous materials”. Only animal experiments performed by Louis Pasteur at the end of the nineteenth century, in which no dilution of the poisonous properties was achieved even after several passages, suggested that the disease-causing agent was able to multiply in the organism. Therefore, there was talk of a reproducible “virus” (Latin for “poison” or “slime”) in living organisms, and later also in cells. In St. Petersburg in 1892, Dimitri I. Ivanovski demonstrated that tobacco mosaic disease is caused by an “ultrafilterable” agent, whose size is significantly smaller than that of bacteria: tobacco mosaic virus (bacteria filters have a pore size of approximately 0.2 μm, however, most viruses are smaller than 0.1 μm). Soon afterwards, Martinus Willem Beijerinck came to the same conclusion: he developed, for the first time, the notion of a self-replicating, “liquid” agent (contagium vivum fluidum). The discovery of foot-and-mouth disease virus by Friedrich Loeffler and Paul Frosch in Greifswald in 1898 was the first evidence of an animal pathogenic virus.","Modrow, Susanne; Falke, Dietrich; Truyen, Uwe; Schätzl, Hermann",Molecular Virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122844/,33

Another type of model is an SIS model in which infectives return to the susceptible class on recovery because the disease confers no immunity against reinfection. Such models are appropriate for most diseases transmitted by bacterial or helminth agents, and most sexually transmitted diseases (including gonorrhea, but not such diseases as AIDS, from which there is no recovery). One important way in which SIS models differ from SIR models is that in the former there is a continuing flow of new susceptibles, namely recovered infectives. Later in this chapter we will study models that include demographic effects, namely births and deaths, another way in which a continuing flow of new susceptibles may arise.","Brauer, Fred; Castillo-Chavez, Carlos",Mathematical Models in Population Biology and Epidemiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123266/,33
26410,Split Blood Products,2014-04-09,"As predicted by the parasite-stress theory of values, variation in parasite stress correlated with collectivism–individualism across nations, USA states, and indigenous societies. In regions with high adversity of infectious diseases, human cultures are characterized by high collectivism, whereas in regions of low parasite stress cultures are highly individualistic. The prediction from the parasite-stress theory of values that infectious disease transmissible among humans (nonzoonotics) will be more important in predicting collectivism–individualism than those that humans can contract only from nonhuman animals (zoonotics) was supported. Evidence in human movement patterns for nations, states of the USA, and indigenous societies supports the hypothesis that the absence of dispersal (high philopatry) is a defense against contact with novel parasites in out-groups and their habitats. We show that human cultures with high degrees of collectivism have high degrees of cooperative breeding, and propose that the parasite-stress theory of sociality offers a general theory of family structure across humans as well as nonhuman animal taxa. We propose that a major context for the evolution of human reciprocity was in gaining benefits from out-group interactions during periods of relatively low disease threat. The parasite-stress theory of values offers a novel perspective to explain the evolution of reciprocity and human unique cognitive abilities. The parasite-stress theory suggests useful new research directions for the study of the demographic transition, patriotism, xenophobia, ethnocentrism, and moral foundations theory. We include discussion of ecological correlations and the ecological fallacy.

26706,Innovationen im Dialogmarketing,2013-04-12,"The discovery of asunaprevir (1) began with the concept of engaging the small and well-defined S(1)’ pocket of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS3/4A protease that was explored in the context of tripeptide carboxylic acid-based inhibitors. A cyclopropyl-acyl sulfonamide moiety was found to be the optimal element at the P(1)-P(1)’ interface enhancing the potency of carboxylic acid-based prototypes by 10- to >100-fold, dependent upon the specific background. Optimization for oral bioavailability identified a 1-substituted isoquinoline-based P(2)* element that conferred a significant exposure advantage in rats compared to the matched 4-substituted quinoline isomer. BMS-605339 (30) was the first cyclopropyl-acyl sulfonamide derivative advanced into clinical trials that demonstrated dose-related reductions in plasma viral RNA in HCV-infected patients. However, 30 was associated with cardiac events observed in a normal healthy volunteer (NHV) and an HCV-infected patient that led to the suspension of the development program. Using a Langendorff rabbit heart model, a limited structure-cardiac liability relationship was quickly established that led to the discovery of 1. This compound, which differs from 30 only by changes in the substitution pattern of the P(2)* isoquinoline heterocycle and the addition of a single chlorine atom to the molecular formula, gave a dose-dependent reduction in plasma viral RNA following oral administration to HCV-infected patients without the burden of the cardiac events that had been observed with 30. A small clinical trial of the combination of 1 with the HCV NS5A inhibitor daclatasvir (2) established for the first time that a chronic genotype 1 (GT-1) HCV infection could be cured by therapy with two direct-acting antiviral agents in the absence of exogenous immune-stimulating agents. Development of the combination of 1 and 2 was initially focused on Japan where the patient population is predominantly infected with GT-1b virus, culminating in marketing approval which was granted on July 4, 2014. In order to broaden therapy to include GT-1a infections, a fixed dose triple combination of 1, 2, and the allosteric NS5B inhibitor beclabuvir (3) was developed, approved by the Japanese health authorities for the treatment of HCV GT-1 infection on December 20, 2016 and marketed as Ximency(®).","Meanwell, Nicholas A.; Rajamani, Ramkumar; Scola, Paul M.; Sun, Li-Qiang",HCV: The Journey from Discovery to a Cure,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123690/,33

Such investment has also focused on fighting major diseases, enabled by the novel invention of cost-effective and valid drug development for treatment and side effect reduction, along with improved vector control. In addition, the demand for diagnostics that is essential in determining prognosis, identifying disease stages, monitoring treatment, and assessing the spreading as health services has expanded. Molecular-based diagnostics is critical for prevention, identification, and treatment of disease. Current laboratory analyses support correct diagnosis in over 70 % of all diseases and can be used to aid the continuous monitoring of drug therapy. However, classic diagnostic technologies are not completely well suited to meeting the expanded testing requirement because they rely on complicated sample purification and sophisticated instruments which are labor-intensive, timely, and expensive and require well-trained operators. One of the main challenges for industry is to develop fast, relatively accurate, easy-to-use, and inexpensive devices. In addition to the improved efficiency in laboratory diagnostics, there has been a trend toward a more decentralized diagnostics which occurs directly at patients’ bedside, in outpatient clinics, or at the sites of accidents, so-called point-of-care (POC) systems. The concept of POC testing is mainly for the patient, so short turnaround time, minimum sample preparation, reagent storage and transferring, user-friendly analytical instruments, and digital or visible quantitative or semiquantitative single readout are required. POC test is a great option of potential in vitro diagnostics (IVD) for resource-limited settings. It is clear that on-site or minimum sample preparation and on-chip storage limit the delays that caused by transport and preparation of clinical samples. Shorter turnaround time leads to rapid clinical decision-making and may save fatal consequences. No previous knowledge in sample analysis should be required, so elders can perform the tests at home with minimum training to improve health outcome. Lateral-flow immunoassay (LFIA) devices, for example, which were originally proposed in the 1980s, remain popular largely because of their design simplicity. The purpose of this article is to introduce readers with basic information regarding the LFIA approach that we think the most representative product of IVD test for solving global health issues.","Cheng, Chao-Min; Kuan, Chen-Meng; Chen, Chien-Fu",In-Vitro Diagnostic Devices,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7124134/,33

To initiate infection, viruses bind to sites, or receptors, on the cell surface and transfer their genome across the limiting membrane of the cell. The mechanisms underlying these events, and viral tropism for particular host cells, are becoming increasingly well understood. Several cell surface proteins have now been identified as viral receptors, and analyses of intact virus particles and sub-viral components are revealing the structures of the binding determinants on the viruses themselves. For many viruses, the events leading to penetration and delivery involve constitutive endocytic properties of the host cell, and the low pH environment in endocytic compartments is a crucial trigger in the penetration process. The knowledge of viral tropism, binding and entry suggests strategies which may be applied to the design of targeted therapeutic agents with appropriate specificities and effective delivery mechanisms.","Sommerfelt, Maja A.; Marsh, Mark",Adv Drug Deliv Rev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7130215/,33

28879,ECR – Final Programme: Postgraduate Educational programme,2004,"Word embeddings, made widely popular in 2013 with the release of word2vec, have become a mainstay of NLP engineering pipelines. Recently, with the release of BERT, word embeddings have moved from the term-based embedding space to the contextual embedding space—each term is no longer represented by a single low-dimensional vector but instead each term and its context determine the vector weights. BERT’s setup and architecture have been shown to be general enough to be applicable to many natural language tasks. Importantly for Information Retrieval (IR), in contrast to prior deep learning solutions to IR problems which required significant tuning of neural net architectures and training regimes, “vanilla BERT” has been shown to outperform existing retrieval algorithms by a wide margin, including on tasks and corpora that have long resisted retrieval effectiveness gains over traditional IR baselines (such as Robust04). In this paper, we employ the recently proposed axiomatic dataset analysis technique—that is, we create diagnostic datasets that each fulfil a retrieval heuristic (both term matching and semantic-based)—to explore what BERT is able to learn. In contrast to our expectations, we find BERT, when applied to a recently released large-scale web corpus with ad-hoc topics, to not adhere to any of the explored axioms. At the same time, BERT outperforms the traditional query likelihood retrieval model by 40%. This means that the axiomatic approach to IR (and its extension of diagnostic datasets created for retrieval heuristics) may in its current form not be applicable to large-scale corpora. Additional—different—axioms are needed.","Câmara, Arthur; Hauff, Claudia",Advances in Information Retrieval,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7148226/,33

We reviewed the most recent literature and guidelines in this field and organized the current recommendations for healthcare professionals caring for critically ill organ transplant recipients. RECENT FINDINGS: The incidence of multidrug-resistant organisms is increasing. Multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria comprise about 14% of organisms. Vancomycin-resistant enterococci bloodstream infections are also on the rise, as 20.5% of nosocomial enterococci are now vancomycin-resistant, changing empiric antibiotic selection. Fluconazole-resistant Candida species comprise up to 46% of cases of candidemia in hospitalized patients. Consequently, new guidelines recommend primary use of echinocandins in patients with candidemia who have moderate-to-severe disease. Finally, the incidence of emergence of ganciclovir-resistant cytomegalovirus infection in patients is 5–12%, requiring early recognition and change to alternative regimens in the case of poor response to therapy. SUMMARY: Bloodstream infections are a major cause of mortality and morbidity in solid organ transplantation. Mortality as high as 24% and 50% have been reported with sepsis and septic shock respectively. As such, bloodstream infections should be diagnosed rapidly and intravenous antibiotics should be started immediately. Appropriate resuscitation should be initiated and the number and/or dose of immunosuppressive drugs should be reduced. Proper source control must also be achieved with radiologic drainage or surgical intervention as appropriate. Initial antibiotic treatment of these patients should cover both Gram-positive organisms, especially in the presence of intravascular catheters, and Gram-negative bacteria. Echinocandins like caspofungin should also be considered especially in critically ill patients, particularly if a patient has been on total parenteral nutrition or broad-spectrum antibiotics.","Kaviani, Aaron; Ince, Dilek; Axelrod, David A.",Curr Transplant Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7222087/,33
32990,"Modernity, Catastrophe, and Realism in the Postcolonial Indian Novel",2020-05-28,"The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemic represents a major challenge for the world economy. While a detailed longer-term diffusion path of the new virus cannot be anticipated for individual countries, one may anticipate international supply shocks and declining GDP growth in many OECD countries and China in 2020; and one should expect falling asset prices in Asia, the United States and the European Union plus the United Kingdom – except for the price of risk-free government bonds. In the course of 2020/21 the US, the EU and the UK, as well as other countries, will face both an increasing number of infected patients as well as a higher case fatality ratio. Health care expenditures in the US could increase more than in the Eurozone and the EU in the medium term, a development that undermines the international competitiveness of the United States. The analysis suggests that per capita income is a positive function of the effective trade openness and of the new Global Health Security Index indicator from the NTI/Johns Hopkins University. A rising health care-GDP ratio in the US is equivalent to a rising US export tariff. As regards the coronavirus challenge, the ratio of acute care beds to the elderly in OECD countries shows considerable variation. Due to international tourism contraction alone, output growth in the Eurozone, the US and China can be expected to fall by about 1.6% in 2020. The COVID-19 challenge for the US Trump Administration is a serious one, since the lack of experts in the Administration will become more apparent in such a systemic stress situation – and this might well affect the November 2020 US presidential election which, in turn, would itself have considerable impacts on the UK and the EU27 as well as EU-UK trade negotiations. Integrating the health care sector into macroeconomics, which should include growth analysis, is an important task. The role of health quality - and health insurance coverage - for endogenous time horizons and economic welfare, respectively, is emphasized.","Welfens, Paul J.

35261,Allografts: Graft Sterilization and Tissue Banking Safety Issues Graft Sterilization and Tissue Banking Safety Issues,2020-06-22,"Water is an essential component of food structures and biological materials. The importance of water as a parameter affecting virion stability and inactivation has been recognized across disciplinary areas. The large number of virus species, differences in spreading, likelihood of foodborne infections, unknown infective doses, and difficulties of infective virus quantification are often limiting experimental approaches to establish accurate data required for detailed understanding of virions’ stability and inactivation kinetics in various foods. Furthermore, non-foodborne viruses, as shown by the SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19) pandemic, may spread within the food chain. Traditional food engineering benefits from kinetic data on effects of relative humidity (RH) and temperature on virion inactivation. The stability of enteric viruses, human norovirus (HuNoV), and hepatitis A (HAV) virions in food materials and their resistance against inactivation in traditional food processing and preservation is well recognized. It appears that temperature-dependence of virus inactivation is less affected by virus strains than differences in temperature and RH sensitivity of individual virus species. Pathogenic viruses are stable at low temperatures typical of food storage conditions. A significant change in activation energy above typical protein denaturation temperatures suggests a rapid inactivation of virions. Furthermore, virus inactivation mechanisms seem to vary according to temperature. Although little is known on the effects of water on virions’ resistance during food processing and storage, dehydration, low RH conditions, and freezing stabilize virions. Enveloped virions tend to have a high stability at low RH, but low temperature and high RH may also stabilize such virions on metal and other surfaces for several days. Food engineering has contributed to significant developments in stabilization of nutrients, flavors, and sensitive components in food materials which provides a knowledge base for development of technologies to inactivate virions in foods and environment. Novel food processing, particularly high pressure processing (HPP) and cold plasma technologies, seem to provide efficient means for virion inactivation and food quality retention prior to packaging or food preservation by traditional technologies.","Roos, Yrjö H.",Food Eng Rev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7305474/,33

36762,Review of fabrication methods of large-area transparent graphene electrodes for industry,2020-07-15,"Flocking model has been widely used in robotic swarm control. However, the traditional model still has some problems such as manually adjusted parameters, poor stability and low adaptability when dealing with autonomous navigation tasks in large-scale groups and complex environments. Therefore, it is an important and meaningful research problem to automatically generate Optimized Flocking model (O-flocking) with better performance and portability. To solve this problem, we design Comprehensive Flocking (C-flocking) model which can meet the requirements of formation keeping, collision avoidance of convex and non-convex obstacles and directional movement. At the same time, Genetic Optimization Framework for Flocking Model (GF) is proposed. The important parameters of C-flocking model are extracted as seeds to initialize the population, and the offspring are generated through operations such as crossover and mutation. The offspring model is input into the experimental scene of autonomous navigation for robotic swarms, and the comprehensive fitness function value is obtained. The model with smallest value is selected as the new seed to continue evolution repeatedly, which finally generates the O-flocking model. The extended simulation experiments are carried out in more complex scenes, and the O-flocking and C-flocking are compared. Simulation results show that the O-flocking model can be migrated and applied to large-scale and complex scenes, and its performance is better than that of C-flocking model in most aspects.","Ma, Li; Bao, Weidong; Zhu, Xiaomin; Wu, Meng; Wang, Yuan; Ling, Yunxiang; Zhou, Wen",Advances in Swarm Intelligence,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7354812/,33

37929,Parasitemia and its daily variation in canine leishmaniasis,2020-08-15,"Legal compliance is an important part of certifying the correct behaviour of a business process. To be compliant, organizations might hard-wire regulations into processes, limiting the discretion that workers have when choosing what activities should be executed in a case. Worse, hard-wired compliant processes are difficult to change when laws change, and this occurs very often. This paper proposes a model-driven approach to process compliance and combines a) reference models from laws, and b) business process models. Both reference and process models are expressed in a declarative process language, The Dynamic Condition Response (DCR) graphs. They are subject to testing and verification, allowing law practitioners to check consistency against the intent of the law. Compliance checking is a combination of alignments between events in laws and events in a process model. In this way, a reference model can be used to check different process variants. Moreover, changes in the reference model due to law changes do not necessarily invalidate existing processes, allowing their reuse and adaptation. We exemplify the framework via the alignment of laws and business rules and a real contract change management process, Finally, we show how compliance checking for declarative processes is decidable, and provide a polynomial time approximation that contrasts NP complexity algorithms used in compliance checking for imperative business processes. All-together, this paper presents technical and methodological steps that are being used by legal practitioners in municipal governments in their efforts towards digitalization of work practices in the public sector.","López, Hugo A.; Debois, Søren; Slaats, Tijs; Hildebrandt, Thomas T.",Fundamental Approaches to Software Engineering,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7418114/,33

The occurrence of frank vasculitis is uncommon. CASE PRESENTATION: A 36-year old male patient with limited cutaneous SSc developed multiple necrotic ulcers on both legs and feet and gangrene of several toes, followed by an acute onset of axonal sensorimotor neuropathy affecting both radial and peroneal nerves, severe testicular pain with gangrenous patches over the scrotum. The hepatitis B virus (HBV) core antibody was positive while HB surface antigen and surface antibody, HAV and HCV antibodies were negative. The polymerase chain reaction for HBV and HCV showed no detectable viraemia. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, cryoblobulins, anticardiolipin antibodies, lupus anticoagulant, antimitochondrial and anti- liver-kidney microsomal antibodies were negative. Pelvi-abdominal ultrasound and portal vein Doppler study showed a coarse and heterogeneous echo-texture of the liver, splenomegaly, moderate ascites and an enlarged, patent portal vein. Fibroscan revealed grade III liver fibrosis. He had an attack of haematemesis with elevation of the liver enzymes and low serum albumin and prothrombin concentrations. He was diagnosed as a case of polyarteritis nodosa. He was successfully treated by methylprednisolone intravenous pulses, followed by oral prednisone 40 mg/day. Plasmapheresis and six monthly doses of 1000 mg intravenous cyclophosphamide. Prednisone was gradually tapered to 5 mg/day with addition of azathioprine 100 mg/day. CONCLUSION: The association between systemic sclerosis and polyarteritis nodosa is very rare. The co-existence of SSc and vasculitis necessitates modification of the treatment plan.","Mahmoud, Geilan A.; Elsaid, Nora Y.; Zayed, Hania S.",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7481842/,33

Consequently, nearly all community accepted guidelines and principles (e.g. FAIR and TRUST) for publishing such data in the digital ecosystem, stress the importance of semantic data enhancement. Having rich semantic annotation of DM datasets would support the data mining process at various choice points, such as data understanding, automatic identification of the analysis task, and reasoning over the obtained results. In this paper, we report on the developments of an ontology-based annotation schema for semantic description of DM datasets. The annotation schema combines three different aspects of semantic annotation, i.e., annotation of provenance, data mining specific, and domain-specific information. We demonstrate the utility of these annotations in two use cases: semantic annotation of remote sensing data and data about neurodegenerative diseases.","Kostovska, Ana; Džeroski, Sašo; Panov, Panče",Discovery Science,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7556383/,33

Various interrelations link these private and public projects. Contrary to the original intentions, Bitcoin has not developed into a widespread means of payments, not the least due to its considerable price volatility. Its most significant contribution could be the „proof of concept“ for an innovative, private means of payment outside the conventional monetary system. In contrast, Libra is designed as a rather conventional means of payment with close relations with the existing banking sector, which raises numerous policy questions concerning monetary and financial stability.

It encompasses both undernutrition or protein-energy malnutrition (PEM) and overnutrition, including obesity. This study aimed to evaluate whether PEM impacts bacterial pneumonia (BP) and, if so, to quantify the degree of impact on inpatient outcomes. Methods This was a retrospective cohort study involving adult hospitalizations for BP using the nationwide inpatient database. Outcomes included comparing inpatient mortality, total hospital charges, length of hospital stay, as well as complications from bacterial pneumonia. Results The in-hospital mortality for adults with BP was 2.62%. Patients with PEM had a higher adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of inpatient mortality (adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 2.31, 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.14 - 2.48, p<0.001) as compared to non-PEM patients. PEM was also associated with higher odds of sepsis (aOR: 2.24, 95% CI: 2.04 - 2.46, p<0.001), septic shock (aOR: 3.29, 95% CI: 2.82 - 3.85, p<0.001), requiring mechanical ventilation (aOR: 2.51, 95% CI: 2.31 - 2.71, p<0.001), requiring vasopressors (aOR: 2.90, 95% CI: 2.20 - 3.83, p<0.001), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (aOR: 1.63, 95% CI: 1.33 - 2.00, p<0.001), acute kidney failure (AKI) (aOR: 1.24, 95% CI: 1.18 - 1.29, p<0.001), deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (aOR: 1.80, 95% CI: 1.62 - 2.00, p<0.001), and pulmonary embolism (PE) (aOR: 1.25, 95% CI: 1.08 - 1.45, p=0.003).

However, excessive NETs presence in wound tissue can cause local hyperinflammation and -coagulation resulting in delayed wound healing. To improve wound healing, we aimed to examine the role of NETs and DNase1 on primary and secondary wound healing. METHODS: The study included 93 C57BL/6 mice, with 3 different genotypes: wildtype, Pad4-, and DNase1-Knockout (KO). Pad4-KO mice show limited NETs formation, while DNase1-KO mice cannot disintegrate them. All 3 genotypes were included in (1) a laparotomy group and (2) a thermal injury group. Animals in both groups either received DNase1 or a vehicle i.p. post wound induction and wound assessment and euthanasia were conducted. Laparotomy and burn scars were assessed using the stony brook scar evaluation scale and modified Yeong scale respectively. Tissue was analyzed histologically using H&E staining. Ly6g, Collagen I and III, SMA, and Fibrinogen were visualized and neutrophils activation (NE, MPO) and NETs (H3cit) formation assessed. RESULTS: All animals survived with no complications. DNase1 treatment led to a significantly improved scar appearance in both groups, which was also seen in Pad4-KO mice. In the laparotomy group DNase1 improved collagen deposition and fibrin concentration was significantly reduced by DNase1 treatment. Markers of neutrophil activation were significantly reduced in the treatment and Pad4-KO group. In the thermal injury group wound closure time was significantly reduced after DNase1 treatment and in the Pad4-KO group. Even though inflammation remained high in the thermal injury model over time, neutrophil activation and NETs formation were significantly reduced by DNase1 treatment compared to controls. DISCUSSION: Primary and secondary intention wound healing is improved by targeting NETs through DNase1 treatment or genetic KO, as assessed by wound closure time and scar appearances. Additionally, wound stability was not affected by DNASE treatment. The results suggest that overall wound healing is accelerated and DNase1 appears to be a promising option to reduce scar formation; which should be evaluated in humans.","Heuer, Annika; Stiel, Carolin; Elrod, Julia; Königs, Ingo; Vincent, Deirdre; Schlegel, Patrick; Trochimiuk, Magdalena; Appl, Birgit; Reinshagen, Konrad; Raluy, Laia Pagerols; Boettcher, Michael",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7947714/,33

The purpose of this chapter is to sketch out the dynamic between the EU and its member states in European Governance post-Brexit and after the global public health crisis, that accompanies the explosive spread of new-type pneumonia, to clarify the actual status of the EU. In response to COVID-19, the President of the European Commission, Dr. Von der Leyen is advancing reforms based on the Green Deal policy and the “Digital Europe” strategy will strongly promote. It is to be hoped that the EU’s capacity for integration and the relationship of mutual trust between the organization and its citizens. It will be fundamentally enhanced by the new framework of social solidarity. The current economic and public health crisis can only be effectively addressed by coordinated democratic and scientific solutions at global level in cooperation with citizens.

As viruses of COVID-19 like diseases are transferable from human to human, so it becomes very challenging to stop spreading these pandemics. These challenges are not only limited to the treatment of infected patients but also maintaining systematic social distancing to stop spreading the disease. However, maintaining social distancing is not entirely possible everywhere, like in hospitals, emergency sectors, etc. Some critical issues such as: carefully handling the Intensive Care Unite (ICU), patient care, hygienic practice, and systematic social distancing have become very necessary to slow down the spread of the new virus as appropriate vaccines or drugs are not yet available. In this time of crisis, Artificial Intelligence (AI) could assists in many more ways in addition to assisting diagnosis, drug or vaccine discovery. Therefore, this AI, especially algorithms of machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision along with edge computing and IoT technologies could be smart solutions for such challenges.

Moreover, unconstrained by competition and profit maximization, as soon as the most basic material needs are met socialism moves to enhance worker, and general social and environmental, welfare; remaining surpluses being reinvested in economic growth. Thus, notwithstanding the introduction of profit taking to motivate production in some non-essential economic areas, the direct reinvestment of surplus in the other areas further contributes to the dynamic growth of the Chinese economy; development in the USSR falling victim to an arms race.","Glynn, Simon",The Economic Logic of Late Capitalism and the Inevitable Triumph of Socialism,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7991127/,33

Citizens of countries around the world were directed to shelter-in-place as increasing numbers of people became infected and have died including frontline healthcare workers. At the time of the writing of this chapter nearly 180,000 Americans and more than 800,000 people worldwide have died. During this time employees who were fortunate to be able to work remotely were directed to do so from home, including many simulation professionals working for academic institutions. Most face-to-face educational activities stopped and SP Educators (SPEs) across the United States and the world needed to pivot and mobilize as quickly as possible to bring simulation activities with SPs online to keep learners progressing while safely implementing operations for all stakeholders, including SPs. Safety is a guiding principle in Domain 1 of the ASPE Standards of Best Practices and is paramount in discussing SP work during this pandemic. Given that SP activities are primarily face-to face encounters, prioritizing their on-the-job safety was of the utmost importance and the ethical choice. This chapter details how SPEs trained and implemented fully online SP activities for health sciences learners as part of the COVID-19 response. However, while COVID-19 was a stimulus, it has highlighted new potential and opportunities for SP based curriculums using online platforms as part of a collaborative educational design process. It is likely that online SP training and events will continue as innovation born from this crisis. Therefore, we offer and advance the definition of human simulation online as simulation designed to teach or assess learning objectives via any human simulation/SP learning activity that may be effectively planned and implemented synchronously (live) in online platforms.","Clark, Lou; Woll, Anne; Miller, Joseph M.",Comprehensive Healthcare Simulation: Implementing Best Practices in Standardized Patient Methodology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7991545/,33

ACM ’96) is a technique for provably obfuscating programs’ access patterns, such that the access patterns leak no information about the programs’ secret inputs. To compile a general program to an oblivious counterpart, it is well-known that [Formula: see text] amortized blowup is necessary, where N is the size of the logical memory. This was shown in Goldreich and Ostrovksy’s original ORAM work for statistical security and in a somewhat restricted model (the so called balls-and-bins model), and recently by Larsen and Nielsen (CRYPTO ’18) for computational security. A long standing open question is whether there exists an optimal ORAM construction that matches the aforementioned logarithmic lower bounds (without making large memory word assumptions, and assuming a constant number of CPU registers). In this paper, we resolve this problem and present the first secure ORAM with [Formula: see text] amortized blowup, assuming one-way functions. Our result is inspired by and non-trivially improves on the recent beautiful work of Patel et al. (FOCS ’18) who gave a construction with [Formula: see text] amortized blowup, assuming one-way functions. One of our building blocks of independent interest is a linear-time deterministic oblivious algorithm for tight compaction: Given an array of n elements where some elements are marked, we permute the elements in the array so that all marked elements end up in the front of the array. Our O(n) algorithm improves the previously best known deterministic or randomized algorithms whose running time is [Formula: see text] or [Formula: see text] , respectively.","Asharov, Gilad; Komargodski, Ilan; Lin, Wei-Kai; Nayak, Kartik; Peserico, Enoch; Shi, Elaine",Advances in Cryptology - EUROCRYPT 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7991674/,33

This attack uses [Formula: see text] calls to the cipher to search a key space of size N. Previous work in the specific case of AES derived the full gate cost by analyzing quantum circuits for the cipher, but focused on minimizing the number of qubits. In contrast, we study the cost of quantum key search attacks under a depth restriction and introduce techniques that reduce the oracle depth, even if it requires more qubits. As cases in point, we design quantum circuits for the block ciphers AES and LowMC. Our circuits give a lower overall attack cost in both the gate count and depth-times-width cost models. In NIST’s post-quantum cryptography standardization process, security categories are defined based on the concrete cost of quantum key search against AES. We present new, lower cost estimates for each category, so our work has immediate implications for the security assessment of post-quantum cryptography. As part of this work, we release Q# implementations of the full Grover oracle for AES-128, -192, -256 and for the three LowMC instantiations used in Picnic, including unit tests and code to reproduce our quantum resource estimates.

51015,Vaccine certificates: does the end justify the means?,2021-03-30,"BACKGROUND: Patients referral for colonoscopy in the province of Quebec are organized through a standardized triage sheet that includes all indications categorized in 5 hierarchal scheduling priorities. In the context of a restricted access to colonoscopy, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, postponed elective endoscopies lead to potential diagnostic and therapeutic delays in patients with colorectal neoplasia. There is currently an important need to evaluate available tools to improve patients prioritization. AIMS: This study aims to determine CRC and advanced adenomas (AA) rates associated with indications of priority 3 (P3 fig.1). The secondary objective is to regroup and compare indications with higher and lower rate of CRC and AA. METHODS: This retrospective study included all adult patients who underwent a single diagnostic colonoscopy from March 2013 to March 2016 following a single FIT test in a tertiary teaching hospital. A literature review informed the adopted definition of higher-risk of CRC and AA according to P3 colonoscopy indications. These include: Positive FIT test (IN5), hematochezia in ≥ 40 years old patients (IN4), unexplained iron deficiency anemia (IN6) and symptoms suspicious of occult colorectal cancer (IN18). Lower risk P3 indications were defined as: suspicion of IBD (IN3), recent change in bowel habits (IN7), polyp viewed on imaging (IN17), inadequate bowel preparation (IN19), and diverticulitis follow-up (IN20). Higher and lower risk indications findings were analyzed. RESULTS: In our cohort of 2226 patients, indications for colonoscopy referral according to the standardized form were available for 1806 patients (10 P1, 69 P2, 1056 P3, 56 P4 and 615 P5). In our studied group of P3 indications, the mean age was 62.6±11.3 years, 54.1% were female and 173 (16.4%) patients had a significant finding of CRC or AA (table 1). Patients referred for higher risk indications had a significantly increased rate of CRC and AA (19.3% vs 5.1% p≤ 0.01) compared to patients referred for lower risk indications. CONCLUSIONS: A standardized colonoscopy referral tool may be adapted to improve prioritization of patients at risk of advanced neoplasia. These findings are especially relevant in the context of limited access to colonoscopy like during a pandemic.

51861,Finding What Is Inaccessible: Antimicrobial Resistance Language Use among the One Health Domains,2021-04-03,"PURPOSE: Confronting the pandemic of COVID-19 is nowadays one of the most prominent challenges of the human species. A key factor in slowing down the virus propagation is the rapid diagnosis and isolation of infected patients. The standard method for COVID-19 identification, the Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction method, is time-consuming and in short supply due to the pandemic. Thus, researchers have been looking for alternative screening methods, and deep learning applied to chest X-rays of patients has been showing promising results. Despite their success, the computational cost of these methods remains high, which imposes difficulties to their accessibility and availability. Thus, the main goal of this work is to propose an accurate yet efficient method in terms of memory and processing time for the problem of COVID-19 screening in chest X-rays. METHODS: To achieve the defined objective, we propose a new family of models based on the EfficientNet family of deep artificial neural networks which are known for their high accuracy and low footprints. We also exploit the underlying taxonomy of the problem with a hierarchical classifier. A dataset of 13,569 X-ray images divided into healthy, non-COVID-19 pneumonia, and COVID-19 patients is used to train the proposed approaches and other 5 competing architectures. We also propose a cross-dataset evaluation with a second dataset to evaluate the method generalization power. RESULTS: The results show that the proposed approach was able to produce a high-quality model, with an overall accuracy of 93.9%, COVID-19 sensitivity of 96.8%, and positive prediction of 100% while having from 5 to 30 times fewer parameters than the other tested architectures. Larger and more heterogeneous databases are still needed for validation before claiming that deep learning can assist physicians in the task of detecting COVID-19 in X-ray images, since the cross-dataset evaluation shows that even state-of-the-art models suffer from a lack of generalization power. CONCLUSIONS: We believe the reported figures represent state-of-the-art results, both in terms of efficiency and effectiveness, for the COVIDx database, a database of 13,800 X-ray images, 183 of which are from patients affected by COVID-19. The current proposal is a promising candidate for embedding in medical equipment or even physicians’ mobile phones.","Luz, Eduardo; Silva, Pedro; Silva, Rodrigo; Silva, Ludmila; Guimarães, João; Miozzo, Gustavo; Moreira, Gladston; Menotti, David",Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8055440/,33

Little is known about the location and accessibility of nuclear medicine facilities, thus making the assessment of their location and allocation an integral part in strengthening nuclear medicine services in these countries. This paper employed the Maximal Covering Location Problem to identify the optimum numbers of University Teaching and Research Hospitals (UTRHs) that can be upgraded to provide Nuclear Medicine (NM) services to the largest number of Local Government Areas (LGAs) within a 200 km threshold drive time in Nigeria. It also identified developmental priority for the optimum UTRHs. Our analysis shows that about 26% of the LGAs are within 200 km distance from the two existing NM facilities and if NM services are restricted to only the UTRHs, 84% coverage of the LGAs can be achieved within a 200 km drive time of 11 UTRHs in Nigeria. Compared with others, Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital, Kano, Kano State should be prioritized because it consistently has between 90 and 110 LGAs within its 200 km distance.

Therefore, we sought to determine whether patients with inflammatory bowel disease treated with infliximab have attenuated serological responses following SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: CLARITY IBD is a multicentre, prospective observational cohort study. Antibody responses in participants treated with infliximab were compared to a reference cohort treated with vedolizumab, a gut-selective anti-integrin α4β7 monoclonal antibody that is not associated with impaired vaccine responses or increased susceptibility to systemic infections. 6935 patients were recruited from 92 UK hospitals between (22)nd September and (23)rd December 2020. Nucleocapsid anti-SARS-CoV2 antibodies were measured using the Roche Elecsys assay. Clinical data and serum were collected every 8 weeks. Durability was defined as nonreduction in antibody level by at least 50% from baseline. RESULTS: At baseline, rates of symptomatic and proven SARS-CoV-2 infection were similar between groups. Seroprevalence was lower in infliximab- than vedolizumab-treated patients (3.4% [161/(4685)], vs 6.0% [134/(2250)], p<0.0001). Multivariable logistic regression analyses confirmed that infliximab (vs vedolizumab; odds ratio [OR] 0.66 [95% CI 0.51–0.(87)], p=0.0027) and immunomodulator use (OR 0.70 [95% CI 0.53–0.(92)], p=0.012) were independently associated with lower seropositivity (Fig 1). In patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection seroconversion was observed in fewer infliximab- than vedolizumab-treated patients (48% [39/(81)], vs 83% [30/(36)], p=0.00044) and the magnitude of anti-SARS-CoV2 reactivity was lower (median 0.8 cut off index (COI) [0.2–5.(6)] vs 37.0 [15.2–76.(1)], p<0.0001). An initial increase in anti-SARS-Cov2 antibody reactivity was observed four weeks after a positive PCR test, in vedolizumab-(47.2 COI [IQR 24.1 - 113.(0)] vs 14.5 COI [IQR 0.4 – 30.(7)], p=0.0079), but not infliximab-treated patients (0.7 COI [IQR 0.2 - 7.(5)] vs 1.1 COI [IQR 0.4 - 4.(5)], p=0.70) (Fig 2). Antibody responses after an initial positive reading were also less durable in infliximab-treated patients (hazard ratio 5.15 [95%CI 2.95–9.(00)]; Fig 3), but durability was not influenced by immunomodulator use. [Image: see text] [Image: see text] [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: Seroprevalence, seroconversion in PCR-confirmed cases, and the magnitude and durability of anti-SARS-CoV2 antibodies were reduced in infliximab- compared with vedolizumab-treated patients.

H9N2 cocirculation with other highly pathogenic aIAVs has the potential to contribute to the rise of new strains with pandemic potential. Therefore, rapid detection of H9 aIAVs infection is crucial to control virus spread. A qualitative reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification (RT-RPA) assay for the detection of aIAV subtype H9N2 was developed. All results were compared to the gold standard (real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)). The RT-RPA assay was designed to detect the hemagglutinin (HA) gene of H9N2 by testing three pairs of primers and a probe. A serial concentration between 10(6) and 10(0) EID(50) (50% embryo infective dose)/mL was applied to calculate the analytical sensitivity. The H9 RT-RPA assay was highly sensitive as the lowest concentration point of a standard range at one EID(50)/mL was detected after 5 to 8 min. The H9N2 RT-RPA assay was highly specific as nucleic acid extracted from H9 negative samples and from other avian pathogens were not cross detected. The diagnostic sensitivity when testing clinical samples was 100% for RT-RPA and RT-PCR. In conclusion, H9N2 RT-RPA is a rapid sensitive and specific assay that easily operable in a portable device for field diagnosis of aIAV H9N2.","Yehia, Nahed; Eldemery, Fatma; Arafa, Abdel-Satar; Abd El Wahed, Ahmed; El Sanousi, Ahmed; Weidmann, Manfred; Shalaby, Mohamed",Vet Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8310249/,33

Like the other major neurodegenerative diseases AD is, at its core, a proteinopathy. Aggregated extracellular amyloid protein plaques and intracellular tau protein tangles are the recognized protein pathologies of AD. Autophagy is the cellular housekeeping process that manages protein quality control and recycling, cellular metabolism, and pathogen elimination. Impaired autophagy and cerebral insulin resistance are invariant features of AD. With a backdrop of age-related low-grade inflammation (inflammaging) and heightened immune risk (immunosenescence), infection with MAP subverts glucose metabolism and further exhausts an already exhausted autophagic capacity. Increasingly, a variety of agents have been found to favorably impact AD; they are agents that promote autophagy and reduce insulin resistance. The potpourri of these therapeutic agents: mTOR inhibitors, SIRT1 activators and vaccines are seemingly random until one recognizes that all these agents also suppress intracellular mycobacterial infection. The zoonotic mycobacterial MAP causes a common fatal enteritis in ruminant animals. Humans are exposed to MAP from contaminated food products and from the environment. The enteritis in animals is called paratuberculosis or Johne’s disease; in humans, it is the putative cause of Crohn’s disease. Beyond Crohn’s, MAP is associated with an increasing number of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases: sarcoidosis, Blau syndrome, autoimmune diabetes, autoimmune thyroiditis, multiple sclerosis, and rheumatoid arthritis. Moreover, MAP has been associated with Parkinson’s disease. India is one county that has extensively studied the human bio-load of MAP; 30% of more than 28,000 tested individuals were found to harbor, or to have harbored, MAP. This article asserts an unfolding realization that MAP infection of humans 1) is widespread in its presence, 2) is wide-ranging in its zoonosis and 3) provides a plausible link connecting MAP to AD.","Dow, Coad Thomas",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8375433/,33

57597,Pulmonary Toxicity After Total Body Irradiation – Critical Review of the Literature and Recommendations for Toxicity Reporting,2021-08-26,"Flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FOB) is an invasive procedure with diagnostic and/or therapeutic purposes commonly used in critically ill patients. FOB may be complicated by desaturation, onset or worsening of the respiratory failure, and hemodynamic instability due to cardio-respiratory alterations occurring during the procedure. Increasing evidences suggest the use of high-flow through nasal cannula (HFNC) over conventional oxygen therapy (COT) in critically ill patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF). Indeed, HFNC has a rationale and possible physiologic advantages, even during FOB. However, to date, evidences in favor of HFNC over COT or continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or non-invasive ventilation (NIV) during FOB are still weak. Nonetheless, in critically ill patients with hypoxemic ARF, the choice of the oxygenation strategy during a FOB is challenging. Based on a review of the literature, HFNC may be preferred over COT in patients with mild to moderate hypoxemic ARF, without cardiac failure or hemodynamic instability. On the opposite, in critically ill patients with more severe hypoxemic ARF or in the presence of cardiac failure or hemodynamic instability, CPAP or NIV, applied with specifically designed interfaces, may be preferred over HFNC.","Longhini, Federico; Bruni, Andrea; Saraco, Giuseppe; Garofalo, Eugenio; Conti, Giorgio",J Anesth Analg Crit Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8418281/,33
57785,Reply,2021-09-15,"In the plan and development of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), understanding drivers behaviour is considered highly valuable. Reckless driving, incompetent preventive measures, and the reliance on slow and incompetent assistance systems are attributed to the increasing rates of traffic accidents. This survey aims to review and scrutinize the literature related to sensor-based driver behaviour domain and to answer questions that are not covered so far by existing reviews. It covers the factors that are required in improving the understanding of various appropriate characteristics of this domain and outlines the common incentives, open confrontations, and imminent commendations from former researchers. Systematic scanning of the literature, from January 2014 to December 2020, mainly from four main databases, namely, IEEEXplore, ScienceDirect, Scopus and Web of Science to locate highly credible peer-reviewed articles.

The number of phyla established for non-Dikarya fungi has increased from 2 to 17. However, to date, both the classification and phylogeny of the basal fungi are still unresolved. In this article, we review the recent taxonomy of the basal fungi and re-evaluate the relationships among early-diverging lineages of fungal phyla. We also provide information on the ecology and distribution in Mucoromycota and highlight the impact of chytrids on amphibian populations. Species concepts in Chytridiomycota, Aphelidiomycota, Rozellomycota, Neocallimastigomycota are discussed in this paper. To preserve the current application of the genus Nephridiophaga (Chytridiomycota: Nephridiophagales), a new type species, Nephridiophaga blattellae, is proposed.","Voigt, Kerstin; James, Timothy Y.; Kirk, Paul M.; Santiago, André L.

59413,A hierarchy of corticospinal plasticity in human hand and forearm muscles.,2019,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis has no proven specific pharmacologic treatment and reported mortality ranges from 30%–45%. The primary aim of this phase IB study was to determine the safety profile of Allocetra™-OTS (early apoptotic cell) infusion in subjects presenting to the emergency room with sepsis. The secondary aims were to measure organ dysfunction, intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital stays, and mortality. Exploratory endpoints included measuring immune modulator agents to elucidate the mechanism of action. METHODS: Ten patients presenting to the emergency room at the Hadassah Medical Center with sepsis were enrolled in this phase Ib clinical study. Enrolled patients were males and females aged 51–83 years, who had a Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score ≥2 above baseline and were septic due to presumed infection. Allocetra™-OTS was administered as a single dose (day +1) or in two doses of 140×10(6) cells/kg on (day +1 and +3), following initiation of standard-of-care (SOC) treatment for septic patients. Safety was evaluated by serious adverse events (SAEs) and adverse events (AEs). Organ dysfunction, ICU and hospital stays, and mortality, were compared to historical controls. Immune modulator agents were measured using Luminex(®) multiplex analysis. RESULTS: All 10 patients had mild-to-moderate sepsis with SOFA scores ranging from 2–6 upon entering the study. No SAEs and no related AEs were reported. All 10 study subjects survived, while matched historical controls had a mortality rate of 27%. The study subjects exhibited rapid resolution of organ dysfunction and had significantly shorter ICU stays compared to matched historical controls (p<0.0001). All patients had both elevated pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and additional immune modulators that gradually decreased following treatment. CONCLUSION: Administration of apoptotic cells to patients with mild-to-moderate sepsis was safe and had a significant immuno-modulating effect, leading to early resolution of the cytokine storm.

59898,Reactive arthritis after COVID-19 vaccination.,2021-05-25,"INTRODUCTION Both intrauterine and intrapartum mother-to-child transmission of SARS-CoV-2 have been reported. However, there is still disagreement as to the likelihood and frequency of such vertical transmission. OBJECTIVE Summarize and analyze the published evidence on forms of SARS-CoV-2 vertical transmission (either intrauterine or intrapartum). EVIDENCE ACQUISITION We carried out a review of literature published in English and Spanish from January 1, 2020 through October 30, 2020. Search engines included PubMed/MEDLINE, SciELO, LILACS, Cochrane, Google Scholar, ResearchGate and medRxiv. There were no restrictions concerning type of study. The review included 48 original research articles, 11 review articles, a meta-analysis, 2 pre-published articles, 15 systematic reviews, and 10 editorials or comments. DEVELOPMENT Medical thinking on congenital or intrapartum maternal-fetal/neonatal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has evolved from preliminary evidence that was divided as to whether these forms of vertical transmission were even possible to current evidence support ing both forms of transmission and hypothesizing as to the mechanisms that guide them. The presence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in maternal, placental, fetal or neonatal tissues has been demonstrated by RT-PCR, specific immunoglobulin detection tests, immunostaining and in-situ hybridization. It is estimated that infections acquired either congenitally or intrapartum occur in 1.8%-8.0% of newborns born to women who test positive for COVID-19 at the end of their pregnancies. This review found 53 neonates who were diagnosed with COVID-19 in the first 48 hours of life by either RT-PCR or specific IgM tests. According to criteria outlined in this review, the timing of infection corresponded to congenital or intrapartum transmission in 39.6% (21/53) of COVID-19-positive newborns, to postpartum transmission in 15.1% (8/53) and remains unspecified in 45.3% (24/53). CONCLUSIONS Congenital and intrapartum SARS-CoV-2 infection in the fetus/newborn is possible, but rare. International collaborative studies using common epidemiological surveillance instruments would allow for a more precise specification of the frequency of congenital and intrapartum SARS-CoV-2 infection at the population level.","Robaina-Castellanos, Gerardo Rogelio; Riesgo-Rodríguez, Solangel de la Caridad",MEDICC review,https://doi.org/10.37757/mr2021.v23.n1.13; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33780426/,33

A novel stent-shaped biodegradable and biocompatible scaffold device braided with absorbable polydioxanone (PDO) multifilaments was recently marketed for tissue suturing and augmentation. OBJECTIVE To explore tissue regeneration profiles following implantation of the stent-shaped hollow scaffold in rats and mini-pigs. MATERIALS AND METHODS The scaffold device was implanted under the panniculus carnosus of rat dorsal skin and in the subcutaneous layer of mini-pig dorsal skin. Tissue samples were harvested and histologically evaluated after 3 days and 1, 2, 4, and 12 weeks for rats and after 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks for mini-pigs. RESULTS Type III collagen was slowly replaced by Type I collagen in the scaffold. Cells from the surrounding tissue infiltrated the hollow space of the scaffold, which induced de novo tissue regeneration in this space. CONCLUSION The novel stent-shaped scaffold used here may be useful for stimulated tissue remodeling of aged skin, collagen synthesis, and partial restoration of dermal matrix components. The cosmetic purpose of this novel soft tissue augmentation device should be clinically investigated in long-term studies.","Kim, Hyuk; Bae, Il-Hong; Ko, Hyun-Ju; Choi, Jin-Kyu; Park, Young-Ho; Park, Won-Seok",Dermatologic surgery : official publication for American Society for Dermatologic Surgery [et al.],https://doi.org/10.1097/dss.0000000000000585; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26671204/,33
60082,Assessing sinus aerosol deposition: benefits of SPECT-CT imaging.,2014,"Avian metapneumovirus (aMPV) is a pathogen with worldwide distribution, which can cause high economic losses in infected poultry. aMPV mainly causes infection of the upper respiratory tract in both chickens and turkeys, although turkeys seem to be more susceptible. Little is known about virus-host interactions at epithelial surfaces after aMPV infection. Tracheal organ cultures (TOC) are a suitable model to investigate virus-host interaction in the respiratory epithelium. Therefore, we investigated virus replication rates and lesion development in chicken and turkey TOC after infection with a virulent aMPV subtype A strain. Aspects of the innate immune response, such as interferon-α and inducible nitric oxide synthase mRNA expression, as well as virus-induced apoptosis were determined. The aMPV-replication rate was higher in turkey (TTOC) compared to chicken TOC (CTOC) (P < 0.05), providing circumstantial evidence that indeed turkeys may be more susceptible. The interferon-α response was down-regulated from 2 to 144 hours post infection in both species compared to virus-free controls (P < 0.05); this was more significant for CTOC than TTOC. Inducible nitric oxide synthase expression was significantly up-regulated in aMPV-A-infected TTOC and CTOC compared to virus-free controls (P < 0.05). However, the results suggest that NO may play a different role in aMPV pathogenesis between turkeys and chickens as indicated by differences in apoptosis rate and lesion development between species. Overall, our study reveals differences in innate immune response regulation and therefore may explain differences in aMPV - A replication rates between infected TTOC and CTOC, which subsequently lead to more severe clinical signs and a higher rate of secondary infections in turkeys.","Hartmann, Sandra; Sid, Hicham; Rautenschlein, Silke",Avian pathology : journal of the W.V.P.A,https://doi.org/10.1080/03079457.2015.1086974; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26365279/,33

We aimed to collect high-quality broad and detailed data from different university medical centers in several European Society of Anesthesiologist countries. METHODS This prospective observational survey was performed in eight medical centers in Spain, Israel and Portugal from 1st April to 31st July 2020. Institutional review board approval was received at each participating center. Inclusion criteria: all women with a positive test for COVID-19. Retrieved data included maternal, delivery, anesthetic, postpartum details, and neonatal outcomes. Descriptive data are presented, and outcomes were compared for women with versus without respiratory signs and symptoms. RESULTS Women with respiratory symptoms (20/12.1%) had significantly higher mean (standard deviation) temperature (37.2 °C (0.8) versus 36.8 °C (0.6)), were older (34.1 (6.7) years versus 30.5 (6.6)) and had higher body mass index kg m-2 - (29.5 (7.5) versus 28.2 (5.1)). Women with respiratory symptoms delivered at a significantly earlier gestational age (50% < 37 weeks) with a 65% cesarean delivery rate (versus 22.1% in the group without respiratory symptoms) and 5-fold increased rate of emergency cesarean delivery, 30% performed under general anesthesia. A higher rate of intrauterine fetal death (3%) was observed than expected from the literature (0.2-0.3%) in developed countries. There was no evidence of viral vertical transmission. CONCLUSION Well-functioning neuraxial analgesia should be available to manage laboring women with respiratory symptoms, as there is a higher frequency of emergency cesarean delivery. We report a higher rate of undiagnosed parturient and intrauterine fetal death.","Ioscovich, Alexander; Guasch, Emilia; Brogly, Nicolas; Shatalin, Daniel; Manrique-Muñoz, Susana; Sánchez Royo, Maria Elena; Zimro, Sabastine; Ginosar, Yehuda; Lages, Neusa; Weinstein, Jacob; Berkenstadt, Haim; Greenberger, Chaim; Lazutkin, Alexey; Izakson, Alexander; Ioscovich, Daniel; Orbach-Zinger, Sharon; Weiniger, Carolyn F","The journal of maternal-fetal & neonatal medicine : the official journal of the European Association of Perinatal Medicine, the Federation of Asia and Oceania Perinatal Societies, the International Society of Perinatal Obstetricians",https://doi.org/10.1080/14767058.2021.1937105; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34107853/,33
60226,Systemic Absorption of Benzalkonium Chloride after Maximal Use of a Consumer Antiseptic Wash Product.,2021-06-23,"The influence of low intensity electromagnetic fields on circadian clocks of cells and tissues has gained increasing scientific interest, either as a therapeutic tool or as a potential environmental hazard. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) refers to the property of certain atomic nuclei to absorb the energy of radio waves under a corresponding magnetic field. NMR forms the basis for Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy and, in a low-intensity form, for NMR therapy (tNMR). Since the circadian clock is bi-directionally intertwined with hypoxic signaling in vertebrates and mammals, we hypothesized that low intensity electromagnetic fields, such as tNMR, might not only affect circadian clocks but also Hypoxia-Inducible Factor-1α (HIF-1α). As master regulator of the hypoxic signaling pathway, HIF-1α is known to dampen the circadian amplitude under reduced oxygen availability, while the hypoxic response of cells and organisms, itself, is tightly clock controlled. In a first experiment, we investigated if tNMR is able to act as Zeitgeber for the core clock mechanism of unsynchronized zebrafish and mouse fibroblast cells, using direct light irradiation and treatment with the glucocorticoid Dexamethasone as references. tNMR significantly affected the cell autonomous clocks of unsynchronized mouse fibroblast cells NIH3-T3, but did not act as a Zeitgeber. Similar to light irradiation and in contrast to treatment with Dexamethasone, tNMR did not synchronize expression profiles of murine clock genes. However, irradiation with tNMR as well as light significantly altered mRNA and protein expression levels of Cryptochrome1, Cryptochrome2 and Clock1 for more than 24 h. Changes in mRNA and protein after different treatment durations, namely 6 and 12 h, appeared to be nonlinear. A nonlinear dose-response relationship is known as hallmark of electromagnetic field induced effects on biological systems. The most prominent alterations were detected in murine HIF-1α protein, again in a nonlinear dose-response. In contrast to murine cells, zebrafish fibroblasts did not respond to tNMR at all. Light, a potent Zeitgeber for the peripheral clocks of fish, led to the expected synchronized clock gene oscillations of high amplitude, as did Dexamethasone. Hence, we conclude, mammalian peripheral clocks are more susceptible to tNMR than the direct light entrainable fish fibroblasts. Although light and tNMR did not act as Zeitgebers for the circadian clocks of unsynchronized murine cells, the significant observed effects might indicate downstream cell-physiological ramifications, which are worth future investigation. However, beside the effects tNMR exerts on the core clock mechanism of mammalian cells, the technology might be the first non-pharmacological approach to modify HIF-1α protein in cells and tissues. HIF-1α and the associated circadian clock play key roles in diseases with underlying ischemic background, such as infarct, stroke, and cancer and, also infectious diseases, such as Covid-19. Hence, low intensity magnetic fields such as tNMR might be of significant medical interest.","Thöni, Viktoria; Oliva, Regina; Mauracher, David; Egg, Margit",Chronobiology international,https://doi.org/10.1080/07420528.2021.1910288; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33847185/,33

This observational, pilot study assessed feed-related SrSO2 patterns at enteral feeding introduction and full enteral feeding (FEF) achievement in twenty AREDF infants with gestational age ≤34 weeks. Enrolled infants were divided into 2 groups according to the development versus lack of GI complications. Infants developing GI complications showed significantly lower SrSO2 and increased splanchnic oxygen extraction in response to enteral feeds at both enteral feeding introduction and FEF.

Les données indirectes sur des maladies associées devront donc guider les conclusions quant aux bénéfices et aux préjudices associés à cette pratique. Dans le but d’appuyer la rédaction d’une ligne directrice sur la prise en charge de la COVID-19, nous avons réalisé des revues systématiques sur les effets des corticostéroïdes dans le traitement de la COVID-19 et de maladies respiratoires aiguës sévères associées. MÉTHODES: Dans des bases de données biomédicales chinoises et internationales et des sources de prépublications, nous avons cherché les essais randomisés et contrôlés (ERC) et les études d’observation comparant des patients atteints de la COVID-19, du syndrome respiratoire aigu sévère (SRAS) ou du syndrome respiratoire du Moyen-Orient (SRMO) ayant reçu des corticostéroïdes à des patients semblables n’ayant pas reçu ce type de médicaments. Pour le syndrome de détresse respiratoire aiguë (SDRA), l’influenza et la pneumonie extrahospitalière (PEH), nous avons mis à jour les revues systématiques rigoureuses les plus récentes. Nous avons réalisé des méta-analyses à effets aléatoires pour cerner les risques relatifs, puis nous avons utilisé le risque de référence des patients atteints de la COVID-19 pour calculer les effets absolus. RÉSULTATS: Pour le SDRA, selon 1 petite étude de cohorte sur des patients atteints de la COVID-19 et 7 ERC sur des patients atteints d’une autre maladie (risque relatif : 0,72, intervalle de confiance [IC] de 95 % 0,55–0,93, différence entre les moyennes [DM] 17,3 % plus faible, données de faible qualité), les corticostéroïdes pourraient réduire le risque de mortalité. Chez les patients atteints d’une forme grave de COVID-19 sans SDRA, 2 études d’observation ont généré des données directes de très faible qualité montrant une augmentation du risque de mortalité avec l’administration de corticostéroïdes (rapport de risques 2,30, IC de 95 % 1,00–5,29, DM 11,9 % plus élevé).

62896,Viral Diseases and Natural Products: Prospects in COVID-19 Treatment (Part-I).,2020,"Elevated nonstructural carbohydrate (NSC) values in pasture forages can cause adverse health effects in some horses (Equus caballus L.). The objectives of this study were to determine the impact of different forage species on blood glucose and insulin concentrations of horses throughout the grazing season. Research was conducted in July (summer) and September (fall) in St. Paul, MN. Alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), mixed perennial cool-season grasses (CSG), and teff (Eragrostis tef [Zucc.] Trotter) pastures were grazed by six horses (24 ± 2 years) that were randomly assigned to one of three forage types in a replicated Latin-square design. Jugular catheters were inserted 1 hour before the start of grazing and horses had access to pasture each day from 08:00 to 16:00 hours. Jugular venous blood samples were collected from each horse before being turned out (0 hours) and then at 2-hour intervals following turnout. Plasma and serum samples were collected and analyzed for glucose and insulin, respectively. Corresponding forage samples were taken by hand harvest. Seasons were analyzed separately and data were analyzed using the MIXED procedure in SAS with P ≤ .05. Teff generally had lower (P ≤ .05) equine digestible energy, crude protein, and NSC compared to the other forages. Differences in peak insulin were observed between horses grazing CSG and teff during the fall grazing (P ≤ .05). These results suggest grazing teff could lower the glucose and insulin response of some horses.","DeBoer, Michelle L; Hathaway, Marcia R; Kuhle, Kerry J; Weber, Patty Sue D; Reiter, Amanda S; Sheaffer, Craig C; Wells, M Scott; Martinson, Krishona L",Journal of equine veterinary science,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jevs.2018.04.008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31256885/,33
63693,European research networks to facilitate drug research in children.,2020-09-06,"Synbiotics are food supplements that combine probiotics and prebiotics to synergistically elicit a health effect in humans. Lactobacillus plantarum exhibits a remarkable genetic and phenotypic diversity, in particular in strain-specific carbohydrate utilization capacities and several strains are marketed as probiotics. We have screened 77 L. plantarum strains for their capacity to utilize specific prebiotic fibers, revealing variable and strain-specific growth efficiencies on isomalto- and galacto-oligosaccharides. We identified a single strain within the screening panel that was able to effectively utilize inulin and FOS, which did not support efficient growth of the rest of the strains. In our panel tested, we did not find strains that could utilize arabinoxylo-oligosaccharides or sulfated fucoidan. The strain-specific growth phenotype on isomalto-oligosaccharides was further analyzed using high performance anion exchange chromatography and revealed distinct substrate utilization phenotypes within the strain panel. The strain-specific phenotypes could be linked to the strain's genotypes identifying gene clusters encoding for carbohydrate membrane transport systems that are predicted to be involved in the utilization of isomaltose and other (unidentified) oligosaccharides in the isomalto-oligosaccharide substrate.IMPORTANCE Synbiotics combine the concepts of prebiotics and probiotics to synergistically enhance the health benefits associated with these ingredients. Lactobacillus plantarum is encountered as a natural inhabitant of gastrointestinal tract and specific strains are marketed as a probiotic based on their strain-specific health-promoting activities. Strain-specific stimulation of growth through prebiotic substrates could enhance the persistence and/or activity of L. plantarum in situ Our study establishes a high-throughput screening model for prebiotic substrate utilization by individual strains of bacteria, which can be readily employed for synbiotic match-making approaches that aim to enhance the intestinal delivery of probiotics through strain-specific, selective growth stimulation.","Fuhren, Jori; Rösch, Christiane; Ten Napel, Maud; Schols, Henk A; Kleerebezem, Michiel",Applied and environmental microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1128/aem.01081-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32680865/,33

However, assessment services are not always readily available to families, as they require significant time and resources. Currently, in-person screening and diagnostic assessments for ASD are limited due to the COVID-19 pandemic and will continue to be a concern for situations that limit in-person contact. Thus, it is important to expand the modalities in which child assessments are provided, including the use of technology. AIMS This systematic review aims to identify technologies that screen or assess for ASD in 0-12 year-old children, summarizing the current state of the field and suggesting future directions. METHODS An electronic database search was conducted to gather relevant articles to synthesize for this review. OUTCOMES AND RESULTS 16 studies reported use of novel technology to assess children suspected of ASD.

65580,Sensitization to isobornyl acrylate in a tertiary Belgian hospital.,2021-02-01,"INTRODUCTION Rapid transmission of norovirus often occurs due to its low infectious dosage, high genetic diversity and its short incubation time. The viruses cause acute gastroenteritis and may lead to death. Presently, no effective vaccine or selective drugs accepted by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are available for the treatment of norovirus. Advances in the development of norovirus replicon cell lines, GII.4-Sydney HuNoV strain human B cells, and murine and gnotobiotic pig norovirus models have facilitated the discovery of effective small molecule inhibitors in vitro and in vivo. AREAS COVERED This review gives a brief discussion of the biology and replication of norovirus before highlighting the discovery of anti-norovirus molecules. The article coverage includes: an overview of the current state of norovirus drug discovery, the targeting of the norovirus life cycle, the inhibition of structural and nonstructural proteins of norovirus such as proteases and polymerase, and the blockage of virus entry into host cells. Finally, anti-norovirus drugs in the clinical development stage are described. EXPERT OPINION The current approach for the counteraction of norovirus focuses on the inhibition of viral RNA polymerase, norovirus 3C-like protease and the structural proteins VP1 as well as the blockade of norovirus entry. Broad-spectrum anti-norovirus molecules, based on the inhibition of 3C-like protease, have been developed. Other host factors and ways to overcome the development of resistance through mutation are also being examined. A dual approach in targeting viral and host factors may lead to an effective counteraction of norovirus infection. Current successes in developing norovirus replicon harboring cells and norovirus infected human cells, as well as murine norovirus models and other animal models such as piglets have facilitated the discovery of effective drugs and helped our understanding of its mechanism of action.","Weerasekara, Sahani; Prior, Allan M; Hua, Duy H",Expert opinion on drug discovery,https://doi.org/10.1080/17460441.2016.1178231; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27108716/,33

Because exploiting new ideas is often harder than more conventional science, novel work can be especially dependent on interactions with colleagues, the training environment, and ready access to potential collaborators. Location may thus influence the tendency to pursue work that is close to the edge of the scientific frontier in the sense that it builds on recent ideas. We calculate for each nation its position relative to the edge of the scientific frontier by measuring its propensity to build on relatively new ideas in biomedical research. Text analysis of 20+ million publications shows that the United States and South Korea have the highest tendencies for novel science. China has become a leader in favoring newer ideas when working with basic science ideas and research tools, but is still slow to adopt new clinical ideas. Many locations remain far behind the leaders in terms of their tendency to work with novel ideas, indicating that the world is far from flat in this regard.","Packalen, Mikko",Scientometrics,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11192-018-2991-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662588/,33

Materials and Methods Other viral pathogens were identified. COVID-19 immunoglobulin M and immunoglobulin G were detected. Results Of the 56 samples collected from women, 2 (3.5%) were positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), whereas 8 (10%) of the 80 samples from men were positive for SARS-CoV-2. The number of respiratory syncytial virus-A-positive cases was 6 (10.7%) in women and 14 (17.5%) in men. Two (3.5%) of the women were positive for parainfluenza-3, and 6 of the men were positive for influenza-B. The number of human metapneumovirus (HMPV)-positive women and men was 6 (10.7%) and 6 (7.5%), respectively. Rhinovirus caused 14.2% and 10% of the cases in men and women, respectively. With a ratio of 10.7% in women and 7.5% in men; SARS-CoV-2, with a ratio of 10% in men and 3.5% in women; influenza-B, with a ratio of 7.5% in men; and parainfluenza-3 and 4, with a ratio of 3.5% in women. SARS-CoV-2 had a mean incidence rate of 7% in men and women. The antibody screening results reveal that antibody formation did not occur in 3 women among the 10 patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19, and antibody formation occurred in 2 of 7 men. Antibody formation occurred in 5 women (16.6%) and 7 men (20.5%) among the 58 patients who were positive for other respiratory tract pathogens. However, 23 (29.5%) of the blood samples collected from 78 individuals who were negative for the COVID-19 agent and other respiratory tract viral pathogens were positive for the COVID-19 antibody. Conclusion Because the climate is colder than normal in areas settled at higher altitudes, more than one pathogens act together. In addition, respiratory infections are seen in all seasons. This causes the diseases to be fewer and milder than in other regions.","Çelebi, Özgür; Çelebi, Demet",The Eurasian journal of medicine,https://doi.org/10.5152/eurasianjmed.2021.20459; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34177295/,33

We aimed to evaluate the impact of comprehensive smoke-free legislation implemented in Hong Kong in 2007 on hospital admissions for childhood lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI). METHODS We obtained data on 75 870 hospital admissions for LRTI among children ≤18 years of age between January 2004 and December 2012 from all Hospital Authority hospitals. Using a negative binomial regression model, we assessed the impact of smoke-free legislation on admission counts. RESULTS After legislation implementation, there was an immediate effect with a change in the admission count of -33.5% (95% CI -36.4% to -30.5%), and a change in time trend to -13.9% per year (95% CI -16.0% to -11.7%). Overall, the legislation was associated with a net 47.4% reduction in admission counts in the first year. We estimated that the legislation was associated with a reduction of 13 635 admissions in the first 6 years after implementation. The immediate reduction and change in time trend was more apparent among school-age than preschool children. CONCLUSIONS Implementation of comprehensive smoke-free legislation was associated with a significant reduction in hospital admissions for childhood LRTI.","Lee, So Lun; Wong, Wilfred Hing Sang; Lau, Yu Lung",Tobacco control,https://doi.org/10.1136/tobaccocontrol-2015-052541; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26769122/,33

The cost to providers is high and the value of care is uncertain. OBJECTIVES To describe the pattern, trajectory and drivers of secondary care use and cost by people in Scotland in their last year of life. METHODS Retrospective whole-population secondary care administrative data linkage study of Scottish decedents of 60 years and over between 2012 and 2017 (N=274 048). RESULTS Secondary care use was high in the last year of life with a sharp rise in inpatient admissions in the last 3 months. The mean cost was £10 000. Cause of death was associated with differing patterns of healthcare use: dying of cancer was preceded by the greatest number of hospital admissions and dementia the least. Greater age was associated with lower admission rates and cost. There was higher resource use in the urban areas. No difference was observed by deprivation. CONCLUSIONS Hospitalisation near the end of life was least frequent for older people and those living rurally, although length of stay for both groups, when they were admitted, was longer. Research is required to understand if variation in hospitalisation is due to variation in the quantity or quality of end-of-life care available, varying community support, patient preferences or an inevitable consequence of disease-specific needs.","Diernberger, Katharina; Luta, Xhyljeta; Bowden, Joanna; Fallon, Marie; Droney, Joanne; Lemmon, Elizabeth; Gray, Ewan; Marti, Joachim; Hall, Peter",BMJ supportive & palliative care,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjspcare-2020-002708; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33579797/,33

DESIGN We assess associations between state characteristics and adoption timing. We also assess associations between enactment and aggregate state-level measures of residents' mobility (Google COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports). SETTING The United States. PARTICIPANTS Adoption population: 50 US states and District of Columbia. Mobility population: state residents using devices with GPS tracking accessible by Google. INTERVENTION AND EXPOSURES State characteristics: COVID-19 diagnoses per capita, 2016 Trump vote share, Republican governor, Medicaid expansion status, hospital beds per capita, public health funding per capita, state and local tax revenue per capita, median household income, population, percent residents 65 years or older, and percent urban residents. Mobility exposure: indicator of order enactment by March 29, 2020 (date of mobility data collection). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Order adoption timing: days since adoption of first order. Mobility: changes in mobility to 6 locations from February 6 to March 29, 2020. RESULTS In bivariate models, order adoption was associated with COVID-19 diagnoses (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.01; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.00 to 1.01), Republican governor (HR = 0.24; 95% CI, 0.13 to 0.44), Medicaid expansion (HR = 2.50; 95% CI, 1.40 to 4.48), and hospital capacity (HR = 0.43; 95% CI, 0.26 to 0.70), consistent with findings in the multivariate models.

69562,Development and assessment of a telesonography system for musculoskeletal imaging.,2021-07-27,"INTRODUCTION In an era of COVID-19, Black Lives Matter, and unsustainable healthcare spending, efforts to address the root causes of health are urgently needed. Research linking medical spending to variation in neighborhood resources is critical to building the case for increased funding for social conditions. However, few studies link neighborhood factors to medical spending. This study assesses the relationship between neighborhood social and environmental resources and medical spending across the spending distribution. METHODS Individual-level health outcomes were drawn from a sample of Medicaid enrollees living in Baltimore, Maryland during 2016. A multidimensional index of neighborhood social and environmental resources was created and stratified by tertile (high, medium, and low). Differences were examined in individual-level medical spending associated with living in high-, medium-, or low-resource neighborhoods in unadjusted and adjusted 2-part models and quantile regression models. Analyses were conducted in 2019. RESULTS Enrollees who live in neighborhoods with low social and environmental resources incur significantly higher spending at the mean and across the distribution of medical spending even after controlling for age, race, sex, and morbidity than those who live in neighborhoods with high social and environmental resources. On average, this spending difference between individuals in low- and those in high-resource neighborhoods is estimated to be $523.60 per person per year. CONCLUSIONS Living in neighborhoods with low (versus those with high) resources is associated with higher individual-level medical spending across the distribution of medical spending. Findings suggest potential benefits from efforts to address the social and environmental context of neighborhoods in addition to the traditional orientation to addressing individual behavior and risk.","Sherry, Melissa K; Bishai, David M; Padula, William V; Weiner, Jonathan P; Szanton, Sarah L; Wolff, Jennifer L",American journal of preventive medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amepre.2021.02.019; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34039496/,33

70650,Social media strategies to affect vaccine acceptance: a systematic literature review.,2021-06-30,"OBJECTIVES The study aimed to investigate the direct and indirect - mediated through insomnia - effect of coronavirus anxiety on exhaustion, from the perspective of Hobfoll's theory of conservation of resources (COR). According to the COR theory, critical events (e.g., the coronavirus epidemic) make people fearful of losing their valuable resources. A prolonged state of anxiety may lead to sleeping troubles, which over time results in an increase in exhaustion. MATERIAL AND METHODS Data were collected from 440 Polish healthcare providers, including nurses and midwives, doctors, paramedics, medical assistance workers, and wardens. Three measures were used: the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale, the Copenhagen Psychosocial Questionnaire (the sleeping trouble subscale) and the Oldenburg Burnout Inventory (the exhaustion subscale). Hypotheses were tested using structural equation modeling. RESULTS The obtained results fully support the hypotheses. Both the direct and indirect relationships between coronavirus anxiety and exhaustion were observed. Specifically, high coronavirus anxiety increased insomnia, which in turn contributed to the development of exhaustion. CONCLUSIONS The results are consistent with the COR theory. Prolonged coronavirus anxiety and sleeping problems depleted healthcare providers' resources and made them feel exhausted. Exhaustion among these workers can have serious consequences not only for themselves but also for the health of their patients. Therefore, research into effective ways to deal with coronavirus anxiety is needed.","Baka, Łukasz",International journal of occupational medicine and environmental health,https://doi.org/10.13075/ijomeh.1896.01745; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33882051/,33
71485,Correction.,2021-02-11,"Gastrin and its derivatives are becoming important targets for immunotherapy of pancreatic, gastric and colorectal tumors. This study was conducted to design antibodies able to block gastrin binding to the gastrin/cholecystokinin-2 (CCK-2) receptor in order to delay tumor growth. The authors have used different gastrin molecules, combined with the diphtheria toxoid, to generate and select human single chain variable fragments (scFvs) as well as mouse monoclonal antibodies and scFvs against different regions of gastrin. There was a remarkable conservation in the antibody repertoire against gastrin, independently of the approach and the species. The germlines most frequently used in gastrin antibody formation were identified. Three different epitopes were identified in the gastrin molecule. The resulting mouse monoclonal antibodies and scFvs were analyzed for gastrin neutralization using Colo 320 WT cells, which overexpress the CCK-2 receptor. The gastrin neutralizing activity assay showed that N-terminal specific mouse monoclonal antibodies were more efficient to inhibit proliferation of Colo 320 WT cells than the anti-C terminal antibodies. Moreover, the human antigastrin scFvs obtained in this study inhibited significantly the proliferation of Colo 320 tumoral cells. These findings should contribute to a more rational design of antibody-based antigastrin therapies in cancer, including passive administration of human antibodies with blocking activity.","Barderas, Rodrigo; Shochat, Susana; Timmerman, Peter; Hollestelle, Martine J; Martínez-Torrecuadrada, Jorge L; Höppener, Jo W M; Altschuh, Danièle; Meloen, Rob; Casal, José Ignacio",International journal of cancer,https://doi.org/10.1002/ijc.23395; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18224686/,33

Chondroitinase ABC (ChABC) has shown promise in central nervous system (CNS) regeneration, yet its therapeutic utility is severely limited by instability. We computationally reengineered ChABC by introducing 37, 55, and 92 amino acid changes using consensus design and forcefield-based optimization. All mutants were more stable than wild-type ChABC with increased aggregation temperatures between 4° and 8°C. Only ChABC with 37 mutations (ChABC-37) was more active and had a 6.5 times greater half-life than wild-type ChABC, increasing to 106 hours (4.4 days) from only 16.8 hours. ChABC-37, expressed as a fusion protein with Src homology 3 (ChABC-37-SH3), was active for 7 days when released from a hydrogel modified with SH3-binding peptides. This study demonstrates the broad opportunity to improve biocatalysts through computational engineering and sets the stage for future testing of this substantially improved protein in the treatment of debilitating CNS injuries.","Hettiaratchi, Marian H; O'Meara, Matthew J; O'Meara, Teresa R; Pickering, Andrew J; Letko-Khait, Nitzan; Shoichet, Molly S",Science advances,https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.abc6378; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32875119/,33
71610,Improvement of physical training by performance enhancing substances.,2020-06-03,"OBJECTIVE Older patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are less likely to receive guideline-recommended treatment at diagnosis, independent of comorbidity. However, national data on treatment of postoperative recurrence are limited. We evaluated the associations between age, comorbidity, and other patient factors and treatment of postoperative NSCLC recurrence in a national cohort. MATERIALS AND METHODS We randomly selected 9001 patients with surgically resected stage I-III NSCLC in 2006-2007 from the National Cancer Data Base. Patients were followed for 5 years or until first NSCLC recurrence, new primary cancer, or death, whichever came first. Perioperative comorbidities, first recurrence, treatment of recurrence, and survival were abstracted from medical records and merged with existing registry data. Factors associated with active treatment (chemotherapy, radiation, and/or surgery) versus supportive care only were analyzed using multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS Median age at initial diagnosis was 67; 69.7% had >1 comorbidity. At 5-year follow-up, 12.3% developed locoregional and 21.5% developed distant recurrence. Among patients with locoregional recurrence, 79.5% received active treatment. Older patients (OR 0.49 for age >75 compared with <55; 95% CI 0.27-0.88) and those with substance abuse (OR 0.43; 95% CI 0.23-0.81) were less likely to receive active treatment. Women (OR 0.62; 95% CI 0.43-0.89) and patients with symptomatic recurrence (OR 0.69; 95% CI 0.47-0.99) were also less likely to receive active treatment. Among those with distant recurrence, 77.3% received active treatment. Older patients (OR 0.42 for age >75 compared with <55; 95% CI 0.26-0.68) and those with any documented comorbidities (OR 0.59; 95% CI 0.38-0.89) were less likely to receive active treatment. CONCLUSION Older patients independent of comorbidity, patients with substance abuse, and women were less likely to receive active treatment for postoperative NSCLC recurrence. Studies to further characterize these disparities in treatment of NSCLC recurrence are needed to identify barriers to treatment.","Wong, Melisa L; McMurry, Timothy L; Stukenborg, George J; Francescatti, Amanda B; Amato-Martz, Carla; Schumacher, Jessica R; Chang, George J; Greenberg, Caprice C; Winchester, David P; McKellar, Daniel P; Walter, Louise C; Kozower, Benjamin D",Lung cancer,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lungcan.2016.11.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27987578/,33

METHODS We merged county-level measures of social distancing through April 18, 2020 to detailed administrative data on substance use treatment facilities. We then calculated the number and share of treatment facilities that offered telehealth services by whether residents of the county social distanced or not. Finally, we estimated a logistic regression that predicted the offering of telehealth services using both county- and facility-level characteristics. RESULTS Approximately 27% of substance use facilities in the U.S. reported telehealth availability at the outset of the pandemic. Treatment facilities in counties with a greater social distancing were less likely to possess telemedicine capability. Similarly, nonopioid treatment programs that offered buprenorphine or vivitrol in counties with a greater burden of COVID-19 were less likely to offer telemedicine when compared to similar facilities in counties with a lower burden of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS Relatively few substance use treatment facilities offered telehealth services at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was used to quantify circPITX1, miR-584-5p, and karyopherin b1 (KPNB1) expression in GBM tissues and cells. The proliferation capability of cells was analyzed by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) and colony-forming assays. The matrigel angiogenesis assay was used to assess tube formation in GBM cells. Flow cytometry assays were conducted to evaluate the cell cycle distribution of GBM cells. The migration and invasion assays were assessed by transwell assay. The Western blot assay was employed to quantify the protein expression level in GBM tissues and cells. The targets of circPITX1 and miR-584-5p were confirmed by dual-luciferase reporter and RNA pull-down assays. A xenograft experiment in nude mice was used to assess the functional role of circPITX1 in vivo. CircPITX1 was obviously overexpressed in GBM tissues and cells when compared with negative groups. The functional experiment implied that knockdown of circPITX1 suppressed proliferation, angiogenesis, migration, invasion, and tumor growth in vivo along with induced cell cycle arrest of GBM cells. Furthermore, miR-584-5p was a target gene of circPITX1, and knockdown of miR-584-5p could abolish circPITX1 silencing-induced effects on GBM cells. KPNB1 was a target gene of miR-584-5p, and functional experiments revealed that overexpression of miR-584-5p repressed proliferation, angiogenesis, migration, invasion, and cell cycle process in GBM cells by targeting KPNB1. Mechanistically, circPITX1/miR-584-5p/KPNB1 axis regulated GBM process via mediating proliferation, angiogenesis, migration, invasion, and cell cycle process of GBM cells.","Cao, Yiqiang; Wang, Fei; Chen, Yu; Wang, Yonggang; Song, Hai; Long, Jiang",Journal of molecular neuroscience : MN,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12031-021-01820-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33763840/,33

With the development of worldwide genome sequencing project, more and more completely sequenced genomes become available. However, traditional sequence alignment tools are impossible to deal with large-scale genome sequence. So, the development of new algorithms to infer phylogenetic relationship without alignment from whole genome information represents a new direction of phylogenetic study in the post-genome era. In the present study, a novel algorithm based on BBC (base-base correlation) is proposed to analyze the phylogenetic relationships of HEV (Hepatitis E virus). When 48 HEV genome sequences are analyzed, the phylogenetic tree that is constructed based on BBC algorithm is well consistent with that of previous study. When compared with methods of sequence alignment, the merit of BBC algorithm appears to be more rapid in calculating evolutionary distances of whole genome sequence and not requires any human intervention, such as gene identification, parameter selection. BBC algorithm can serve as an alternative to rapidly construct phylogenetic trees and infer evolutionary relationships.","Liu, Zhihua; Meng, Jihong; Sun, Xiao",Biochemical and biophysical research communications,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2008.01.070; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18230342/,33

SCARFs include cellular factors both facilitating and restricting viral entry. Among adult organs, enterocytes and goblet cells of small intestine and colon, kidney proximal tubule cells, and gallbladder basal cells appear permissive to SARS-CoV-2, consistent with clinical data. Our analysis also suggests alternate entry paths for SARS-CoV-2 infection of the lung, CNS, and heart. We predict spermatogonial cells and prostate endocrine cells, but not ovarian cells, are highly permissive to SARS-CoV-2, suggesting male-specific vulnerabilities. Early embryonic and placental development show a moderate risk of infection. The nasal epithelium is characterized by high expression of both promoting and restricting factors and a potential age-dependent shift in SCARF expression. Lastly, SCARF expression appears broadly conserved across primate organs examined. Our study establishes an important resource for investigations of coronavirus pathology.

As the pandemic peaked in the United States, we characterized resident activities and concerns. METHODS A cross-sectional study of US otolaryngology residents between April 20, 2020 and May 2, 2020. RESULTS A total of 219 residents at 65/118 (55%) institutions responded. Thirty (14%) residents had been redeployed. Residents reported greatest concerns regarding education (P < .00001). Assuming adequate protective equipment, 55% desired active participation in high-risk procedures on COVID-19-positive patients. Redeployed residents had greater concern for burnout and reduced in-hospital well-being (P < .05). Resident satisfaction correlated with comfort communicating concerns to their department (odds ratio [OR] = 4.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.4-17.3, P = .01) and inversely correlated with low perceived meaning in work (OR = 3.1, CI 1.1-9.1, P = .03).

74790,Author response.,2020-08-31,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic response brought forth major changes in innovation policy. This paper takes stock of the key features of the COVID-19 innovation system. Before the pandemic, innovation in biomedical research and development consisted largely of ""push"" funding from the public sector in support of basic research and ""pull"" incentives from patents to motivate private companies to invest in clinical trials and develop drugs and vaccines. In contrast, during the pandemic, public funding shifted its focus to late-stage product development and manufacturing. Procurement agreements with governments replaced traditional pull incentives from patents for the major private companies. Non-patent barriers to competition may also have incentivized innovation. The challenges to ensuring diffusion have gained in prominence during the pandemic, though it is unclear what role patents will play in pricing and access. Some aspects of this approach to biomedical innovation may be unique to crises, but others could provide lessons for policy beyond the pandemic.

In this paper, we report on meta-analysed outcomes for community health worker (CHW) home visits and mother/peer group delivery platforms. Compared to care as usual, CHW home visits increased early initiation of breastfeeding (EIBF) (OR: 1.50; 95% CI: 1.12, 1.99; n = 10 RCTs) and exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) (OR: 4.42; 95% CI: 2.28, 8.56; n = 9 RCTs) and mother/peer groups were effective for improving children's minimum dietary diversity (OR: 2.34; 95% CI: 1.17, 4.70; n = 4) and minimum meal frequency (OR: 2.31; 95% CI: 1.61, 3.31; n = 3).

The aim of this study was to assess the clinical and angiographic features of ruptured BAs treated endovascularly using predominantly flow-diversion strategy. METHODS The initial clinical and radiological findings, endovascular treatment results, clinical outcomes, and follow-up angiographic findings of seven BAs (one man and six women; mean age, 44.5 years; range, 33-50 years) were retrospectively evaluated. RESULTS All seven BAs were located in the supraclinoid internal carotid artery. Two patients were managed initially by other endovascular treatment options, after that flow-diverting strategy became intention to treat in these two and the remaining five patients. Flow-diverting treatment with pipeline stent (Covidien/Ev3) could be accomplished in all but one patient who was treated by parent artery occlusion due to an access problem. Dual antiaggregant loading was performed 6-8 h before treatment in all patients. No re-bleeding or thrombotic complication occurred periprocedurally. Long-term control angiography was available in all patients revealing occluded aneurysm. The clinical outcome (mRS) was good in five and moderate in two patients. CONCLUSIONS Endovascular reconstructive treatment of a ruptured BA using a flow-diverting device is a promising strategy that can be performed with acceptable clinical and good radiological results.","Çinar, Celal; Oran, İsmail; Bozkaya, Halil; Ozgiray, Erkin",Neuroradiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00234-013-1136-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23322455/,33

This review summarizes recently published studies that describe the clinical epidemiology and racial/ethnic disparities associated with SARS-CoV-2 in children. RECENT FINDINGS Children with SARS-CoV-2 infections manifest with a wide spectrum of disease. Most are either asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic with fever, gastrointestinal, and/or upper respiratory disease. Some children can progress to develop severe lower respiratory disease or a hyper-inflammatory, Kawasaki-like syndrome leading to cardiovascular shock. Although SARS-CoV-2-related deaths in children are rare, more children died within the first nine months of the pandemic than have died during any influenza season over the last decade.Black and Hispanic children represent less than 41% of the US population but account for three out of every four SARS-CoV-2-related hospitalizations and deaths in the USA. The drivers of these disparities in children are complex and likely a combination of societal, biological, and behavioral influences. SUMMARY This pandemic brought to light longstanding health disparities in historically marginalized populations, and minority children have suffered tremendously. It provides an opportunity to understand how a virus hijacked deep-rooted inequities, address these inequities, and work to prevent this outcome in future pandemics/epidemics.","Zirinsky, Elissa; Paintsil, Elijah; Oliveira, Carlos R",Current opinion in pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.1097/mop.0000000000001018; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33871422/,33
78411,Response.,2020-11-01,"BACKGROUND Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) can cause systemic hypoperfusion, which remains undetected by routine monitoring of physiological parameters. Noninvasive tissue perfusion monitoring offers a clinical benefit by detecting low systemic perfusion. In this study, we tried to evaluate whether regional tissue perfusion saturation reflects systemic hypoperfusion during CPB. METHODS This retrospective study included 29 patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status II-III, who required cardiac surgery with CPB. We evaluated the correlations of serum lactate and delivery oxygen with organ perfusion values of peripheral tissue oxygen saturation and cerebral oxygen saturation. Data were recorded at different stages of CPB: T1 (pre-CPB), T2 (cooling), T3 (hypothermia), T4 (rewarming), and T5 (post-CPB). RESULTS Lactate levels were elevated after CPB and up to weaning (P < 0.05). The levels of peripheral and tissue oxygen saturation decreased after the start of CPB (P < 0.05). Lactate levels were negatively correlated with peripheral tissue oxygen saturation levels at T4 (R = -0.384) and T5 (R = -0.370) and positively correlated with cerebral oxygen saturation at T3 (R = 0.445). Additionally, delivery oxygen was positively correlated with peripheral tissue oxygen saturation at T4 (R = 0.466). CONCLUSIONS In this study, we demonstrated that peripheral tissue oxygen saturation can be a reliable tool for monitoring systemic hypoperfusion during CPB period. We also believe that peripheral tissue oxygen saturation is a valuable marker for detecting early stages of hypoperfusion during cardiac surgery.","Lee, Yoon-Sook; Kim, Woon Young; Yoo, Ji Won; Jung, Hyun Don; Min, Too Jae",Korean journal of anesthesiology,https://doi.org/10.4097/kja.d.17.00002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29690753/,33

These variables were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards (PHs) analyses. Hazard ratios (HRs) and performance of the final model were determined. Results Neutrophil count >6.3×109/L, D-dimer level ≥1.00 mg/L, and temperature ≥37.3 °C at admission showed significant positive association with the outcome of respiratory distress in the final model. Complement C3 (C3) of 0.9-1.8 g/L, platelet count >350×109/L, and platelet count of 125-350×109/L showed a significant negative association with outcomes of respiratory distress in the final model. The final model had a C statistic of 0.891 (0.867-0.915), an Akaike's information criterion (AIC) of 567.65, and a bootstrap confidence interval (CI) of 0.866 (0.842-0.89). This five-factor model could help in early allocation of medical resources. Conclusions The predictive model based on the five factors obtained at admission can be applied for calculating the risk of respiratory distress and classifying patients at an early stage. Accordingly, high-risk patients can receive timely and effective treatment, and health resources can be allocated effectively.","Zhang, Xin; Wang, Wei; Wan, Cheng; Cheng, Gong; Yin, Yuechuchu; Cao, Kaidi; Zhang, Xiaoliang; Wang, Zhongmin; Miao, Shumei; Yu, Yun; Hu, Jie; Huang, Ruochen; Ge, Yun; Chen, Ying; Liu, Yun",Annals of translational medicine,https://doi.org/10.21037/atm-20-4977; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33437784/,33

79898,Computational neuroscience with global accessibility.,2021-04-01,"UNLABELLED Airway epithelium is the primary target of many respiratory viruses. However, virus induction and antagonism of host responses by human airway epithelium remains poorly understood. To address this, we developed a model of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection based on well-differentiated pediatric primary bronchial epithelial cell cultures (WD-PBECs) that mimics hallmarks of RSV disease in infants. RSV is the most important respiratory viral pathogen in young infants worldwide. We found that RSV induces a potent antiviral state in WD-PBECs that was mediated in part by secreted factors, including interferon lambda 1 (IFN-λ1)/interleukin-29 (IL-29). In contrast, type I IFNs were not detected following RSV infection of WD-PBECs. IFN responses in RSV-infected WD-PBECs reflected those in lower airway samples from RSV-hospitalized infants. In view of the prominence of IL-29, we determined whether recombinant IL-29 treatment of WD-PBECs before or after infection abrogated RSV replication. Interestingly, IL-29 demonstrated prophylactic, but not therapeutic, potential against RSV. The absence of therapeutic potential reflected effective RSV antagonism of IFN-mediated antiviral responses in infected cells. Our data are consistent with RSV nonstructural proteins 1 and/or 2 perturbing the Jak-STAT signaling pathway, with concomitant reduced expression of antiviral effector molecules, such as MxA/B. Antagonism of Jak-STAT signaling was restricted to RSV-infected cells in WD-PBEC cultures. Importantly, our study provides the rationale to further explore IL-29 as a novel RSV prophylactic. IMPORTANCE Most respiratory viruses target airway epithelium for infection and replication, which is central to causing disease. However, for most human viruses we have a poor understanding of their interactions with human airway epithelium. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most important viral pathogen of young infants. To help understand RSV interactions with pediatric airway epithelium, we previously developed three-dimensional primary cell cultures from infant bronchial epithelium that reproduce several hallmarks of RSV infection in infants, indicating that they represent authentic surrogates of RSV infection in infants. We found that RSV induced a potent antiviral state in these cultures and that a type III interferon, interleukin IL-29 (IL-29), was involved. Indeed, our data suggest that IL-29 has potential to prevent RSV disease. However, we also demonstrated that RSV efficiently circumvents this antiviral immune response and identified mechanisms by which this may occur. Our study provides new insights into RSV interaction with pediatric airway epithelium.","Villenave, Rémi; Broadbent, Lindsay; Douglas, Isobel; Lyons, Jeremy D; Coyle, Peter V; Teng, Michael N; Tripp, Ralph A; Heaney, Liam G; Shields, Michael D; Power, Ultan F",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02119-15; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26423940/,33
80129,Research advances in esophageal diseases: bench to bedside.,2013,"BACKGROUND Rectal tumors can be excised through a number of minimally invasive transanal techniques including transanal excision, transanal endoscopic microsurgery, and transanal minimally invasive surgery (TAMIS). Specialty training is often required to master the nuances of these approaches. This study aimed to create a reproducible transanal excision training model that is suited for laparoendoscopic techniques. METHODS Frozen porcine rectum and anus with intact perianal skin were commercially obtained. Thawed specimens were then cut to approximately 20 cm in length. The proximal end of the rectum was then everted and suction applied to the mucosa to create pseudopolyps of various sizes (sessile and pedunculated). Larger pedunculated lesions were made by tying the base of the pseudopolyps with 5-0 monofilament sutures to gather more tissue. Methylene blue dye was injected submucosally into the lesions to simulate tattoos. The proximal rectum was then closed with sutures. The model was suspended in a trainer box by clamping the distal end in a ringed clamp and the proximal end to the box. Transanal excisions using TAMIS were then performed. The procedures were done by trained community colorectal surgeons attending courses on transanal minimally invasive surgery. RESULTS Both partial- and full-thickness excisions of sessile and pedunculated rectal lesions were successfully performed during simulated TAMIS by trained community surgeons learning this laparoendoscopic technique. CONCLUSION Transanal laparoendoscopic procedures to excise rectal tumors can be successfully and reproducibly performed in an ex vivo porcine anorectal model.","Campbell, Michael Larone; Vadas, Kimberly J; Rasheid, Sowsan H; Marcet, Jorge E; Sanchez, Jaime E",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,https://doi.org/10.4293/108680813x13693422518911; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24680145/,33

Risk of developing cervical artery dissection has been associated with physical activity in various forms and has been presumed to be related to minor trauma and mechanical stretching of the cervical arteries. This systematic review will aim to synthesise data on the risk of recurrent cervical artery dissection after an initial dissection. This information may be applied to further understand the natural history of this disease, and potentially to help direct evidence-based discussions on safe return to activity after dissection. METHODS AND ANALYSIS A broad search of multiple electronic databases (Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Web of Science) will be conducted to identify studies published as of 13 November 2019, examining all-comers with cervical artery dissection observed over time. Studies will be screened by two independent reviewers in a two-level process to determine eligibility for inclusion. Data will be pooled from eligible articles and the main outcome of recurrent cervical artery dissection at 5 years will be determined using quantitative analysis. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Ethics approval is not necessary as no primary data are being collected. The information will be disseminated in the form of a systematic review article which will be submitted to a peer-reviewed medical journal.

Maintaining such a catheter in a healthy rabbit can be challenging, as the animal may scratch at the ear, removing the catheter or forming a large hematoma that might impede blood sampling. The authors developed a technique for protecting the indwelling catheter by cutting a section of moleskin to the same shape as the ear and gluing it to the surface of the ear and the catheter. They applied this technique to collect multiple blood samples during 12-h periods from nine rabbits in a pharmacokinetics study. Catheters remained patent in five rabbits for 12 h, in two rabbits for 8 h, in one rabbit for 6 h and in one rabbit for 4 h. This technique allowed for collection of repeated blood samples and prevented the rabbits from interfering with the catheter while allowing them to move freely during the sampling period.","Sampieri, Francesca; Orchard, Rekha N; Antonopoulos, Aphroditi J; Hamilton, Donald L",Lab animal,https://doi.org/10.1038/laban0212-44; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22261889/,33
80497,Treatment of gastrocutaneous fistula after percutaneous gastrostomy placement.,2016,"The bark, leaves, and flowers of Paulownia trees have been used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat infectious and inflammatory diseases. We investigated the antiviral effects of Paulownia tomentosa flowers, an herbal medicine used in some provinces of P. R. China for the treatment of skin rashes and blisters. Dried flowers of P. tomentosa were extracted with methanol and tested for antiviral activity against enterovirus 71 (EV71) and coxsackievirus A16 (CAV16), the predominant etiologic agents of hand, foot, and mouth disease in P. R. China. The extract inhibited EV71 infection, although no effect was detected against CAV16 infection. Bioactivity-guided fractionation was performed to identify apigenin as an active component of the flowers. The EC50 value for apigenin to block EV71 infection was 11.0 µM, with a selectivity index of approximately 9.3. Although it is a common dietary flavonoid, only apigenin, and not similar compounds like naringenin and quercetin, were active against EV71 infection. As an RNA virus, the genome of EV71 has an internal ribosome entry site that interacts with heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) and regulates viral translation. Cross-linking followed by immunoprecipitation and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis showed that EV71 RNA was associated with hnRNPs A1 and A2. Apigenin treatment disrupted this association, indicating that apigenin suppressed EV71 replication through a novel mechanism by targeting the trans-acting factors. This study therefore validates the effects of Paulownia against EV71 infection. It also yielded mechanistic insights on apigenin as an active compound for the antiviral activity of P. tomentosa against EV71 infection.","Ji, Ping; Chen, Changmai; Hu, Yanan; Zhan, Zixuan; Pan, Wei; Li, Rongrong; Li, Erguang; Ge, Hui-Ming; Yang, Guang",Biological & pharmaceutical bulletin,https://doi.org/10.1248/bpb.b14-00357; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25744451/,33
80694,A novel apoA-I mimetic peptide suppresses atherosclerosis by promoting physiological HDL function in apoE-/- mice.,2020-07-29,"BACKGROUND Several cases of invasive fungal diseases in patients with COVID-19 have been reported, mostly due to Aspergillus spp., with anecdotic reports of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) as co-infections in immunocompromised patients. We describe the first case of PJP in an immunocompetent patient who recovered from COVID-19 pneumonia. CASE DESCRIPTION Our patient was hospitalized for 18 d for respiratory failure due to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pneumonia and successfully treated with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) respiratory support, enoxaparin, ceftaroline and intravenous 6 mg of dexamethasone for 10 d, then with oral prednisone tapering. Despite his improved radiological and clinical conditions at discharge, he was admitted again after 18 d for worsening of respiratory conditions. Upon the second admission, a high-resolution CT-scan of the chest showed the development of new ground-glass opacities and P. jirovecii was detected on bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. A therapy with trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole 20 mg/kg and methylprednisolone 40 mg i.v. bis in die (BID) was started, with improvement of clinical, biochemical and radiological conditions. CONCLUSIONS COVID-19 patients may have multiple risk factors for development of PJP, in particular lymphopaenia and use of steroids. PJP must be ruled out with direct microbiological methods in patients presenting with radiologic and clinical features of possible or probable PJP, even in immunocompetent hosts.","Viceconte, Giulio; Buonomo, Antonio Riccardo; Lanzardo, Amedeo; Pinchera, Biagio; Zappulo, Emanuela; Scotto, Riccardo; Schiano Moriello, Nicola; Vargas, Maria; Iacovazzo, Carmine; Servillo, Giuseppe; Gentile, Ivan",Infectious diseases,https://doi.org/10.1080/23744235.2021.1890331; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33645461/,33

82561,Effects of Running Exercise Combined With Blood Flow Restriction on Strength and Sprint Performance.,2019,"AIM To test the hypothesis that the use of rhBMP2 in established defects requires additional growth factors such as rhVEGF to accomplish effective bone repair. MATERIALS AND METHODS Horizontal/vertical defects of 2 cm length and 1 cm height were created bilaterally in the alveolar crest of the maxillae of 18 minipigs together with the extraction of all premolar teeth and one molar tooth on both sides. After three months of healing, defects were augmented with 0.5 g particulate PDLLA/CaCO3 composite loaded with 400 µg rhBMP2 / 50 µg rhVEGF165 on one side and 800 µg rhBMP2 on the other in 12 test animals, whereas defects in 6 control animals were sham operated and left unfilled on one side and augmented with blank carriers on the other. After 4 and 13 weeks, the animals were evaluated each for area of new bone formation (mm²) and bone density (area %). RESULTS Augmentations with carriers loaded with 800g µrhBMP2 failed to induce significantly more bone than in the augmentations with unloaded carrier after 4 and 13 weeks (p=0.1000 , p= 0.381). Augmentations with carriers loaded with 400 µg rhBMP2 and 50 µg erhVEGF165 resulted in significantly increased bone formation after 13 weeks (p=0.024) compared to blank carriers. Soft tissue in augmentations with combined rhBMP2 / rhVEGF165 loading exhibited numerous microvessels compared to soft tissue in augmentations with rhBMP2. CONCLUSIONS It is concluded that effective bone regeneration in augmentations of established alveolar ridge defects may require the application of rhVEGF additionally to rhBMP2.","Kauffmann, Philipp; Raschke, David; Tröltzsch, Markus; Santander, Petra; Brockmeyer, Phillip; Schliephake, Henning",Clinical oral implants research,https://doi.org/10.1111/clr.13820; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34352150/,33

Treatment with somatostatin analogs labeled with (111)In, (90)Y or (177)Lu can result in symptomatic improvement, although tumor remission is seldom achieved with (111)In-labeled analogs. In this Review, the findings of several studies on the use of PRRT for endocrine tumors are evaluated. Large variation in the antitumor effects of (90)Y-octreotide was reported between studies: an objective response (> or =50% tumor regression) was achieved in 9-33% of patients. After treatment with (177)Lu-octreotate, an objective response was achieved in 29% of patients and a minor response (25-50% tumor regression) was achieved in 16% of patients; stable disease was present in 35% of patients. Treatment with (177)Lu-octreotate resulted in a survival benefit of several years and markedly improved quality of life. Serious, delayed adverse effects were rare after PRRT. Although randomized, clinical trials have not yet been performed, data on the use of PRRT compare favorably with those from other treatment approaches, such as chemotherapy. If these results can be replicated in large, controlled trials, PRRT might become the preferred option in patients with metastatic or inoperable gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.","van Essen, Martijn; Krenning, Eric P; Kam, Boen L R; de Jong, Marion; Valkema, Roelf; Kwekkeboom, Dik J",Nature reviews.

83008,Mass-forming adenomyomatosis in extrahepatic bile duct.,2020-09-08,"INTRODUCTION Respiratory viral infection can cause severe disease and hospitalization, especially among children, the elderly, and patients with comorbidities. In Brazil, official surveillance system of severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) investigates influenza A (IAV) and B (IBV) viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus (HAdV), parainfluenza viruses (hPIV). In Rio Grande do Sul (RS), Brazil, many fatalities associated with SARI between 2013-2017 were patients without underlying diseases and for whom the causative agent had not been identified using official protocols. METHOD This cross-sectional study analyzed the presence of coronaviruses (HCoV), bocavirus (HBoV), metapneumovirus (hMPV), rhinovirus in patients who died of SARI despite not having comorbidities, and that were negative for IAV, IBV, RSV, HAdV, hPIV. Nasopharyngeal aspirates/swabs from patients were used for nucleic acid extraction. The presence of HCoV OC43, HKU1, NL63, and 229E; HBoV; hMPV; and rhinovirus was assessed by RT-qPCR. Clinical data was also analyzed. RESULTS Between 2013 and 2017, 16,225 cases of SARI were reported in RS; 9.8% of the patients died; 20% of all fatal cases were patients without comorbidities and for whom no pathogen was detected using standard protocols. Analysis of 271 of these cases identified HCoV in nine cases; HBoV, hMPV, and rhinovirus were detected in three, three, and ten cases, respectively. Of note, patients infected with HCoV were adults. CONCLUSIONS Results reinforce the importance of including coronaviruses in diagnostic panels used by official surveillance systems because, besides their pandemic potential, endemic HCoVs are associated to severe disease in healthy adults.

Laparoscopic Spiegel lobectomy has not yet been standardized or widely reported. In the current study, we introduce technical improvements, including the liver hanging maneuver, to laparoscopic Spiegel lobectomy. Additionally, we demonstrate the safety and feasibility of this procedure. MATERIALS AND SURGICAL TECHNIQUE We performed consecutive laparoscopic Spiegel lobectomy on six patients: five with hepatocellular carcinoma and one with colorectal liver metastasis. As preparation before liver parenchymal resection, necessary and sufficient mobilization of the Spiegel lobe was performed. A few Glissonian pedicles of the Spiegel lobe were exposed from the hilar plate and divided to reduce the inflow to the Spiegel lobe. After that, vessel tape was used in the hanging maneuver. The tape was pulled forward to give the cutting plane moderate tension during liver parenchymal resection. Lifting this tape provided better exposure for determining the correct cutting plane during liver parenchymal transection. The median operation time was 207 min (range, 147-240 min) and the median intraoperative blood loss was 35 mL (range, 15-85 mL). There were no severe postoperative complications. DISCUSSION We safely performed laparoscopic Spiegel lobectomy. To maintain a sufficient surgical view, especially during liver parenchymal resection, the hanging maneuver may be a useful technique. This single-center investigation into standardized laparoscopic Spiegel lobectomy featuring improvements in technique showed potential for favorable results.","Hayami, Shinya; Ueno, Masaki; Kawai, Manabu; Miyamoto, Atsushi; Suzaki, Norihiko; Hirono, Seiko; Okada, Ken-Ichi; Yamaue, Hiroki",Asian journal of endoscopic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1111/ases.12609; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30549230/,33

Months after the beginning of the global Cover-19 pandemic, predictions by anthropologists of xenophobic ideologies and actions have come to pass. In the United States people understand the global pandemic not as biology, but as the manifestation of political affiliation, difference, connection, and disconnection. COVID-19 is, according to public perception, dangerous because it maliciously mutates to attack. It is ""a guy we don't know."" Relationships between the mysteriousness of the virus and heightened visibility of longstanding inequality in the United States form new contexts for existing social tensions. These dynamics provide a backdrop against which the ongoing commitment to uprisings connected to the Black Lives Matter movement unfold. Here I draw on analysis of 50 semi-structured interviews we conducted from March to August of 2020 demonstrating how understandings of the biology of a virus are woven into perceptions of politics, inequality, and the fractures of a divided nation.

After initial correction of fluid and electrolyte abnormalities, the patient was treated with high-dose octreotide. Shortly thereafter, due to the intractable nature of her diarrhea, she underwent cytoreductive hepatic surgery. The pancreatosplenectomy specimen showed a poorly differentiated ECA of the distal pancreas, immunoreactive for synaptophysin, CD56, and S100 protein, with morphologically similar hepatic and lymph node metastases. Postoperatively, her diarrhea improved, along with decline in serum VIP and calcitonin levels.

Moreover, hernias are responsible for respiratory function alterations. This study aims to investigate the postoperative alterations in respiratory function after open ventral hernia repair in patients with incisional hernia. METHODS Patients operated on at the Policlinico ""Paolo Giaccone"" at Palermo University Hospital between January 2015 and December 2016 were identified in a prospective database. Fifty-one patients were enrolled in the study. The respiratory outcome measures used were forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), FEV1/FVC ratio, peak expiratory flow (PEF) and PEF percentage (%PEF). The timepoints at which the parameters listed were assessed were t0, 1 week before the surgical operation; t1, 12 months later; and t2, 3 years later. RESULTS The difference between mean preoperative and postoperative PEF was significant [t0 4.32 (4.03-7.92), t1 6.7 (4.27-8.24) with p = 0.012 and t2 6.5 (4.25-8.21) with p = 0.026]. The %PEF increased from 75% preoperatively to 87% at t1 (p = 0.009) and to 85% at t2 (p = 0.03). No differences were found in the comparison of pre- and postoperative FVC, FEV1 or FEV1/FVC ratio.

However, the technical aspects and outcomes of the delta-shaped anastomosis in totally robotic distal gastrectomy have never been reported. METHODS A single-institutional, non-randomized, retrospective study was performed between 2009 and 2013. During the study period, 47 patients underwent robotic distal gastrectomy followed by robotic delta-shaped Billroth I reconstruction, and 165 patients underwent conventional laparoscopic distal gastrectomy followed by laparoscopic delta-shaped Billroth I reconstruction. After 64 were excluded because of insufficient intraoperative video, 43 patients in the robotic group and 105 patients in the laparoscopic group were enrolled in the study. Short-term outcomes were determined from medical records and full-length operative videos. RESULTS There were no significant differences between the robotic and laparoscopic groups in terms of morbidity (4.7% vs 3.8%), anastomosis-related complications (0% vs 1.0%), non-anastomosis-related complications (2.3% vs 0%), or systemic complications (2.3% vs 0%). Time for reconstruction did not vary between the robotic group (16.6 min [8.8-42.9 min]) and the laparoscopic group (15.8 min [7.2-41.0 min]). There was no mortality in this series. In the conventional group, the morbidity rate was 3.8%. The anastomosis-related complication rate was 1.0% in the conventional group. CONCLUSIONS Given the excellent short-term outcomes related to anastomosis, delta-shaped anastomosis after robotic distal gastrectomy was at least as feasible and safe as delta-shaped anastomosis after laparoscopic distal gastrectomy.","Kikuchi, Kenji; Suda, Koichi; Nakauchi, Masaya; Shibasaki, Susumu; Nakamura, Kenichi; Kajiwara, Shuhei; Goto, Ai; Inaba, Kazuki; Ishida, Yoshinori; Uyama, Ichiro",Asian journal of endoscopic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1111/ases.12288; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27113772/,33

Evidence from clinical and neuroimaging studies and animal research suggests that these cardiac disturbances share the same underlying mechanisms. Although the exact cascade of events has yet to be elucidated, stroke-induced functional and structural alterations in the central autonomic network, with subsequent dysregulation of normal neural cardiac control, are the assumed pathophysiology. This dysregulation can promote myocardial necrosis, microvascular dysfunction, coronary demand ischaemia, and arrhythmogenesis. These stroke-associated cardiac alterations can be summarised as a distinct so-called stroke-heart syndrome. Independent cohort studies have shown a strong association between this syndrome and unfavourable short-term prognosis; however, long-term consequences, including secondary cardiac events and death, are less well described and specific therapeutic targets are scarce. An integrated view of stroke-heart syndrome will offer opportunities to expedite research and inform clinical decision making.","Scheitz, Jan F; Nolte, Christian H; Doehner, Wolfram; Hachinski, Vladimir; Endres, Matthias",The Lancet.

Shaking up exclusion criteria for vaccine trials.,2021-01-01,"OBJECTIVE to assess the socioeconomic and demographic profiles of patients hospitalized with a diagnosis of diabetic foot in a tertiary hospital in Belem-PA, Brazil, as well as to evaluate risk factors for lower limb amputations in such patients, classifying them according to the Wagner and PEDIS classifications. METHODS we conducted a descriptive, cross-sectional, unicentric, and analytical study carried out through a structured questionnaire. RESULTS the study consisted of 57 patients, aged between 48 and 84 years old, 66.7% being male. The average income ranged between one and three (61.4%) minimum wages and below one minimum wage (31.6%). Type II Diabetes Mellitus was predominant (86.0%). Concerning comorbidities, arterial hypertension displayed the highest proportion (62.3%), followed by dyslipidemia (52.8%). Smokers comprised 35.1% of the sample. Infectious diabetic foot (50.9%) and mixed diabetic foot (49.1%) were the most common. Of the 20 patients with previous amputation, 90% had undergone minor amputation, and 10%, major ones. Callosity (92.6%) was the most prevalent deformity. Fifty-four (94.7%) patients underwent surgery, those being debridement (24.1%), minor amputation (37.0%) and major amputation (38.9%). During hospitalization, 78.9% of individuals did not require ICU stay. Hospitalization time varied between three and 59 days, and 78.9% of hospitalized patients did not progress to death, but 43.1% of patients submitted to major amputations died. CONCLUSION patients with diabetic foot followed-up have a low socioeconomic profile; most of them underwent surgical procedures, whether major or minor, due to the higher prevalence of infectious diabetic foot and/or non-adherence to non-operative treatment.","Reis, JosÉ Maciel Caldas Dos; Wanzeller, Robson Roberto Melo; Meireles, Wilame Melo; Andrade, Mariseth Carvalho DE; Gomes, Victor Hugo Guerreiro AmÉrico; Arrais, JosÉ Aroldo Alves; Ishak, Geraldo",Revista do Colegio Brasileiro de Cirurgioes,https://doi.org/10.1590/0100-6991e-20202606; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33263651/,33

The aim of this study is to extend flow displacement analysis to 3D in patients with aortic and aortic valve pathologies. METHODS 43 individuals were studied with 4DFlow MRI in 6 groups: healthy, tricuspid aortic valve (TAV) with aortic stenosis (AS) but no dilatation, TAV with dilatation but no AS, and TAV with both AS and dilatation, BAV without AS or dilatation, BAV without AS but with dilation. The protocol was approved by our institutional review board, and informed consent was obtained. Flow displacement was calculated for multiple planes along the ascending aorta, and 2D and 3D analyses were compared. RESULTS Good correlation was found between 2D flow displacement and both maximum and average 3D values (r>0.8). Healthy controls had significantly lower flow displacement values with all approaches (p<0.05). The highest flow displacement was seen with stenotic TAV and aortic dilation (0.24±0.02 with maximum flow displacement). The 2D approach underestimated the maximum flow displacement by more than 20% in 13 out of 36 patients (36%). CONCLUSIONS The extended 3D flow displacement analysis offers a more comprehensive quantitative evaluation of abnormal systolic flow in the ascending aorta than 2D analysis. Differences between patient subgroups are better demonstrated, and maximum flow displacement is more reliably assessed.","Sigovan, Monica; Dyverfeldt, Petter; Wrenn, Jarrett; Tseng, Elaine E; Saloner, David; Hope, Michael D",Magnetic resonance imaging,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mri.2015.02.020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25721998/,33
87683,"Recommendations for Prevention and Control of Influenza in Children, 2020-2021.",2020-09-08,"BACKGROUND Research on team effectiveness in healthcare has focussed on whether effective teams yield positive outcomes for patients and on the effectiveness of team interventions to improve performance. Limited understanding exists of what works for whom within an effective team, or how and why the context in which the team operates enables team members both as individuals and as a collective to enact behaviours that promote positive outcomes. METHODS This realist synthesis of the literature explores the relationship between team interventions, underlying teamwork mechanisms generated by those interventions, and the resultant impact on patient outcomes in an acute hospital context. A systematic search of five healthcare and healthcare management academic databases: PubMed, PsychINFO, CINAHL, ABInform, Emerald Management and three grey literature databases: ERIC, OpenDOAR and Open Grey was undertaken. Five experts in the field were also contacted to source relevant literature. Using PRISMA guidelines, relevant studies published between January 2006 and January 2017 were systematically searched by a team of three people. Drawing on realist methodology, data were synthesised using context, mechanism and outcome configurations as the unit of analysis to identify enablers and barriers to effective team interventions. RESULTS Out of 3347 papers retrieved, 18 were included in the final synthesis. From these, five contextual enablers were identified: an inter-disciplinary focus and flattened hierarchy; effective communication; leadership support and alignment of team goals with organisational goals; credibility of intervention; and appropriate team composition with physician involvement. Ten recurring mechanisms were identified, the most frequently occurring of which was shared responsibility. CONCLUSIONS The advantage of using realist synthesis to extrapolate data from the literature is that it considers the context and mechanisms that will impact effectiveness of healthcare team interventions. This methodological approach provides a different perspective to other types of syntheses and offers insight as to why certain contextual elements may yield more success than others. Findings therefore tend to have more practical implications. Specificity of detail in terms of how external drivers impact on healthcare team interventions was limited in the articles extracted for analysis. This broader perspective is therefore an important consideration for future research.","Cunningham, U; Ward, M E; De Brún, A; McAuliffe, E",BMC health services research,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-018-3331-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29996820/,33

88672,"The Swiss Society of Microbiology: Small Bugs, Big Questions and Cool Answers.",2016,"BACKGROUND An increasing number of patients come to the operating room in use of opioid analgesics. They have different levels of tolerance to opioid effects which challenge the anesthesiologists in search of safe and effective opioid dosing perioperatively. The tested hypothesis is that simple measures introduced will allow us to measure tolerance qualitatively. Opioid effects on pain (analgesia) and dyspnea sensations (relieving effect) are tested. Patients were allocated to three groups according to pre-operative analgesics: (1) control, without any opioid analgesics, (2) weak opioid, and (3) strong opioid. Pressure pain threshold (PPT) and no-respiratory sensation period (NRSP) were measured at two points: before and 3 min after intravenous fentanyl administration. RESULTS A total of 58 (43 controls, 9 weak opioids, and 6 strong opioids) patients were enrolled. PPT and NRSP, after iv 2 μg/kg ideal body weight (IBW) fentanyl, were significantly elevated in the control patients (PPT: 6.2 ± 2.1 N to 9.2 ± 3.9 N, p < 0.0001, NRSP: 17.8 ± 10.8 s to 22.8 ± 18.7 s, p < 0.005, paired t test). However, preoperative opioid use, though with tendency, did not show a significant decrease of the opioid effect. Due to an insufficient number of participants, no conclusion could be drawn. Further analysis of the data from control patients showed a significant difference between the two sexes in sensitivity to PPT and NRSP, as well as fentanyl effect on PPT. CONCLUSIONS Current data showed a simple method of measuring the opioid effect on two dimensions: pain and respiration. Though not able to show a qualitative measurement of tolerance formation in opioid-users, data from control patients showed females to be more sensitive to pain and dyspnea but is less sensitive to the opioid effect. Further studies are necessary to show whether these gender differences serve as clinical relevance. TRIAL REGISTRATION UMIN, UMIN 000011580.

88893,Embodied working memory during ongoing input streams.,2021,"Background Prevention of infection with airborne pathogens and exposure to airborne particulates and aerosols (environmental pollutants and allergens) can be facilitated through use of disposable face masks. The effectiveness of such masks for excluding pathogens and pollutants is dependent on the intrinsic ability of the masks to resist penetration by airborne contaminants. This study evaluated the relative contributions of a mask, valve, and Micro Ventilator on aerosol filtration efficiency of a new N95 respiratory face mask. Methods The test mask was challenged, using standardized methods, with influenza A and rhinovirus type 14, bacteriophage ΦΧ174, Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), and model pollutants. The statistical significance of results obtained for different challenge microbial agents and for different mask configurations (masks with operational or nonoperational ventilation fans and masks with sealed Smart Valves) was assessed. Results The results demonstrate >99.7% efficiency of each test mask configuration for exclusion of influenza A virus, rhinovirus 14, and S. aureus and >99.3% efficiency for paraffin oil and sodium chloride (surrogates for PM2.5). Statistically significant differences in effectiveness of the different mask configurations were not identified. The efficiencies of the masks for excluding smaller-size (i.e., rhinovirus and bacteriophage ΦΧ174) vs. larger-size microbial agents (influenza virus, S. aureus) were not significantly different. Conclusions The masks, with or without features intended for enhancing comfort, provide protection against both small- and large-size pathogens. Importantly, the mask appears to be highly efficient for filtration of pathogens, including influenza and rhinoviruses, as well as the fine particulates (PM2.5) present in aerosols that represent a greater challenge for many types of dental and surgical masks. This renders this individual-use N95 respiratory mask an improvement over the former types of masks for protection against a variety of environmental contaminants including PM2.5 and pathogens such as influenza and rhinoviruses.","Zhou, S Steve; Lukula, Salimatu; Chiossone, Cory; Nims, Raymond W; Suchmann, Donna B; Ijaz, M Khalid",Journal of thoracic disease,https://doi.org/10.21037/jtd.2018.03.103; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29707364/,33

89373,Maintenance: From COVID-19 to Wound Care.,2021-01-01,"OBJECTIVE Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is an important public health issue in China. Although efficacy has been demonstrated by randomized controlled trials, the evidence for effectiveness of the monovalent Enterovirus 71 (EV71) vaccine against HFMD remains unknown. This study aimed to assess the vaccine effectiveness for HFMD in Guangzhou, China. METHODS Routinely collected vaccination and HFMD surveillance data were captured from the China Information System for Disease Control and Prevention. We estimated the EV71 vaccine effectiveness using spatial ecologic and time-series analysis approaches. RESULTS A total of 174,002 HFMD cases under 5 years of age were reported to the Guangzhou, China surveillance system from January 2016 to December 2018. A total of 408,664 children completed a two-dose EV71 vaccination series. In an ecologic analysis, a two-dose EV71 vaccination rate above the median conferred lower HFMD risk relative to a vaccination rate below the median (ratio ratio = 0.955, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.949, 0.962; P < .001). In the time-series approach, 0.9% fewer HFMD cases were associated with a 1% increase in the two-dose EV71 vaccination rate, but without statistical significance (P = .094). However, we detected statistically significant protective associations for HFMD among children 3 years of age (0.9% fewer HFMD cases with a 1% increased vaccination rate; P = .046), and for EV71 (1.4%; P = .012) and ""other viruses"" (1.3%; P = .002), although not for Coxsackievirus A16 (CVA16). CONCLUSION Our findings, based on real-world data, provide evidence of EV71 vaccine effectiveness for preventing EV71 and ""other"" viruses associated with HFMD. An expanded program of EV71 vaccination is urgently needed.","Du, Zhicheng; Huang, Yong; Bloom, Michael S; Zhang, Zhoubin; Yang, Zhicong; Lu, Jianyun; Xu, Jianxiong; Hao, Yuantao",Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,https://doi.org/10.1080/21645515.2020.1763076; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32530733/,33

METHODS In metastatic renal cancer patients treated with anti-angiogenic tyrosine kinase inhibitors, arterial phase contrast-enhanced computed tomography was used to simultaneously measure changes in: (a) tumour size, and (b) tumour enhancement (a surrogate marker of tumour vessel density) within individual lesions. RESULTS No correlation between baseline tumour enhancement and lesion shrinkage was observed, but a reduction in tumour enhancement on treatment was strongly correlated with reduction in lesion size (r=0.654, P<0.0001). However, close examination of individual metastases revealed different types of response: (1) good vascular response with significant tumour shrinkage, (2) good vascular response with stabilisation of disease, (3) poor vascular response with stabilisation of disease and (4) poor vascular response with progression. Moreover, contrasting responses between different lesions within the same patient were observed. We also assessed rebound vascularisation in tumours that acquired resistance to treatment. The amplitude of rebound vascularisation was greater in lesions that had a better initial response to therapy (P=0.008). INTERPRETATION Changes in a surrogate marker of tumour vessel density correlate with response and resistance to anti-angiogenic therapy.

91192,Early unplanned readmission of neurosurgical patients after treatment of intracranial lesions: a comparison between surgical and non-surgical intervention group.,2020-08-15,"BACKGROUND Knotless barbed sutures are monofilament sutures with barbs cut into them. These sutures self-anchor, maintaining tissue approximation without the need for surgical knots. OBJECTIVE The hypothesis of this study was that knotless barbed suture could be used on the myometrium to close the hysterotomy at cesarean delivery. The objective was to compare uterine closure time, need for additional sutures, and blood loss between this and a conventional suture. STUDY DESIGN This was a prospective, unblinded, randomized controlled trial conducted at the Ziv Medical Center, Zefat, Israel. The primary outcome was the length of time needed to close the uterine incision, which was measured from the start of the first suture on the uterus until obtaining uterine hemostasis. To minimize provider bias, women were randomized by sealed envelopes that were opened in the operating room just prior to uterine closure with either a bidirectional knotless barbed suture or conventional suture. Secondary outcomes included the number of additional hemostatic sutures needed and blood loss during incision closure. RESULTS Patients were enrolled from August 2016 until March 2017. One hundred two women were randomized. Fifty-one had uterine closure with knotless barbed suture and 51 with conventional suture. The groups were similar for demographics as well as number of previous cesarean deliveries. Uterine closure time using the knotless barbed suture was significantly shorter than the conventional suture by a mean of 1 minute 43 seconds (P < .001, 95% confidence interval, 67.69-138.47 seconds). Knotless barbed sutures were associated with a lower need for hemostatic sutures (median 0 vs 1, P < .001), and blood loss measured during incision closure was significantly lower (mean 221 mL vs 268 mL, P < .005). CONCLUSION The use of a knotless barbed suture is a reasonable alternative to conventional sutures because it reduced the closure time of the uterine incision. There was also less need for additional hemostatic sutures and slightly reduced estimated blood loss.","Peleg, David; Ahmad, Ronan Said; Warsof, Steven L; Marcus-Braun, Naama; Sciaky-Tamir, Yael; Ben Shachar, Inbar",American journal of obstetrics and gynecology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajog.2018.01.043; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29496259/,33
91347,Research Trends and Hotspot Analysis of Conjunctival Bacteria Based on CiteSpace Software.,2020,"BACKGROUND Although hospital 30-day readmissions policies currently focus on medical conditions, readmission penalties will be expanding to encompass surgical procedures, logically beginning with common and standardized procedures, such as gastric bypass. Therefore, understanding predictors of readmission is essential in lowering readmission rate for these procedures. STUDY DESIGN This is a retrospective case-control study of patients undergoing laparoscopic gastric bypass at Tufts Medical Center from 2007 to 2012. Variables analyzed included demographics, comorbidities, intraoperative events, postoperative complications, discharge disposition, and readmission diagnoses. Univariate analysis was used to identify factors associated with readmission, which were then subjected to multivariable logistic regression analysis. RESULTS We reviewed 358 patients undergoing laparoscopic gastric bypass, 119 readmits, and 239 controls. By univariate analysis, public insurance, body mass index >60 kg/m(2), duration of procedure, high American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class, and discharge with visiting nurse services (VNA) were significantly associated with 30-day readmissions. In the regression model, duration of procedure, high ASA class, and discharge with visiting nurse services (VNA) remained significantly associated with readmission when controlling for other factors (odds ratio [OR] 1.523, 95% CI 1.314 to 1.766; OR 2.447, 95% CI 1.305 to 4.487; and OR 0.053 with 95% CI 0.011 to 0.266, respectively). The majority of readmissions occurred within the first week after discharge. Gastrointestinal-related issues were the most common diagnoses on readmission, and included anastomotic leaks, postoperative ileus, and bowel obstruction. The next 2 most common reasons for readmission were wound infection and fluid depletion. CONCLUSIONS Using readmission risk, we can stratify patients into tiered clinical pathways. Because most readmissions occur within the first postdischarge week and are most commonly associated with dehydration, pain, or wound issues, focusing our postoperative protocols and patient education should further lower the incidence of readmission.","Tayne, Samantha; Merrill, Christian A; Shah, Sajani N; Kim, Julie; Mackey, William C",Journal of the American College of Surgeons,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2014.03.054; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25151343/,33

To some, this sense of agency derives from a post hoc reconstruction of a likely causal relationship between an event and our preceding movements; others propose that the sense of agency originates from prospective comparisons of motor programs and their effects. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we found that the sense of agency is associated with a brain network including the pre-supplementary motor area (SMA) and dorsal parietal cortex. Transcranial magnetic stimulation affected the sense of agency only when delivered over the pre-SMA and specifically when time-locked to action planning, rather than when the physical consequences of the actions appeared. These findings make a prospective theory of the sense of agency more likely.","Zapparoli, L; Seghezzi, S; Zirone, E; Guidali, G; Tettamanti, M; Banfi, G; Bolognini, N; Paulesu, E",Science advances,https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aay8301; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32937445/,33

93007,Spike of interstitial PO2 produced by a twitch in rhythmically contracted muscle.,2021-01-01,"BACKGROUND Greater trochanteric pain syndrome encompasses a range of causes of lateral hip pain including greater trochanteric bursitis, tendinopathy and tears of the gluteus minimus and medius, and lateral snapping hip (LSH). Surgical options for LSH range from open surgery to endoscopic surgery, including a diamond-shaped cut or a simple transversal release to gluteus maximus tendon release. Resection of an area of proximal iliotibial band (ITB) and step-cut or z-plasty lengthening have not proven superior to transverse release of the ITB. Therefore, making a complete and effective transverse cut guided by ultrasound may represent a potential advance over endoscopic surgery. PURPOSE In this case series study, we describe how to perform proximal release of the ITB guided by ultrasound. METHODS The surgical technique-either z-plasty or transverse section of the ITB-was first validated on 10 cadaver specimens and then used in clinical practice. Fourteen patients (5 males and 9 females) were operated from 2014 to 2018. Mean age was 43 years (29-62). RESULTS The snap resolved in all patients, as verified actively during the surgical procedure as the patient has only local anesthesia. The VAS score for sports activity improved from 7 (5-9) before surgery to 0 (0-2) after 1 year. The HSS score improved from 58 points (47-72) to 96 at 1-2 years. There were no complications other than minor hematomas nor recurrences. CONCLUSION Ultrasound-guided release of the LSH is a novel surgical option with encouraging results in patients for whom conservative protocols have failed. It can be performed under local anesthesia in an outpatient setting with minimal aggressiveness. It is relatively easy, quick, and painless; no stitches are required. Weight bearing is immediate, and patients usually need crutches for only 2-3 days. Although complete recovery may take 3 months, the rehabilitation protocol is fast and painless.","Villanueva, Manuel; Iborra, Álvaro; Sanz-Ruiz, Pablo; Noriega, Concepción",Journal of orthopaedic surgery and research,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13018-021-02461-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34011357/,33

How students cope with these disruptions is important in determining the ongoing impacts of the pandemic on mental health and well-being. We evaluated the associations between COVID-19 stress, coping responses, and symptoms of depression. Participants: A sample of 131 students (106 female; 25 male) was recruited throughout May 2020. Methods: Participants completed online self-report measures of study constructs. Results: As predicted, students experiencing more stress related to COVID-19 endorsed more symptoms of depression. Student stress was also associated with less use of engagement coping responses. Primary engagement and secondary engagement coping responses mediated the relationship between COVID-19 stress and symptoms of depression. Conclusions: Students lacking in adaptive, engagement coping responses may be particularly at risk for psychopathology when faced with high levels of stress related to COVID-19.","Mushquash, Aislin R; Grassia, Elizabeth",Journal of American college health : J of ACH,https://doi.org/10.1080/07448481.2020.1865379; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33513079/,33

This paper aims to review the available literature and guidelines pertaining to vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) and the proposed guidelines, while offering a potential approach that unifies the available evidence. While the risk of VITT remains extremely low and the benefits outweigh the risks, experimental studies are needed to clarify the pathophysiology behind VITT and possibly decrease the risk of thrombosis and other adverse events occurring.

94580,Beyond expectations: 40 years of EPI.,2014,"BACKGROUND CMR-guidance has the potential to improve tissue visualization during cardiovascular catheterization procedures and to reduce ionizing radiation exposure, but a lack of commercially available CMR guidewires limits widespread adoption. Standard metallic guidewires are considered to be unsafe in CMR due to risks of RF-induced heating. Here, we propose the use of RF-efficient gradient echo (GRE) spiral imaging for reduced guidewire heating (low flip angle, long readout), in combination with positive contrast for guidewire visualization. METHODS A GRE spiral sequence with 8 interleaves was used for imaging. Positive contrast was achieved using through-slice dephasing such that the guidewire appeared bright and the background signal suppressed. Positive contrast images were interleaved with anatomical images, and real-time image processing was used to produce a color overlay of the guidewire on the anatomy. Temperature was measured with a fiber-optic probe attached to the guidewire in an acrylic gel phantom and in vivo. RESULTS Left heart catheterization was performed on swine using the real-time color overlay for procedural guidance with a frame rate of 6.25 frames/second. Using our standard Cartesian real-time imaging (flip angle 60°), temperature increases up to 50 °C (phantom) and 4 °C (in vivo) were observed. In comparison, spiral GRE images (8 interleaves, flip angle 10°) generated negligible heating measuring 0.37 °C (phantom) and 0.06 °C (in vivo). CONCLUSIONS The ability to use commercial metallic guidewires safely during CMR-guided catheterization could potentially expedite clinical translation of these methods.","Campbell-Washburn, Adrienne E; Rogers, Toby; Basar, Burcu; Sonmez, Merdim; Kocaturk, Ozgur; Lederman, Robert J; Hansen, Michael S; Faranesh, Anthony Z",Journal of cardiovascular magnetic resonance : official journal of the Society for Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12968-015-0219-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26695490/,33

MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively analyzed our experience with LDN performed from January, 2003 to November, 2016, focusing on describing modifications of the surgical technique and devices made during those years. Demographics, operative factors, and postoperative complications of donors were reviewed. RESULTS From the beginning of our experience with LDKTx we have performed 185 cases. From 2003 to 2016, 144 LDN were performed. Modifying our technique in response to the learning curve, complications encountered, and technological advancements, we experienced low complication rates. CONCLUSIONS Continual refinement with LDN techniques based on intraoperative observations and technological advances is necessary to keep complication rates low and reduce donor morbidity and time for recovery.","Cintorino, Davide; Pagano, Duilio; Bonsignore, Pasquale; di Francesco, Fabrizio; Li Petri, Sergio; Ricotta, Calogero; Gruttadauria, Salvatore",Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

The recent eruptions of Ebola outbreaks in Africa and other communicable diseases like Zika and SARS elsewhere led scientific and medical commissions to call for global action. The calls for action motivated the World Health Organization (WHO) to respond by defining a new construct within the health sector: Common Good for Health (CGH). While the starting point for developing the CGH construct was the re-emergence of communicable diseases, it extends to additional outcomes resulting from failures to act and finance within and outside the health sector.

METHODS A total of 11 databases were examined using the COre, Standard, Ideal (COSI) protocol. Bibliographic searches (no chronological or linguistic restriction) were conducted using, among other methods, the Patient, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome (PICO) template. We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines for flow diagram and checklist. Final reading of the complete texts was conducted in English, French, and Spanish. Classification of papers was completed within five levels of evidence (LE). RESULTS There were a total of 621 hits (526 COre; 95 Standard, Ideal) for screening identification, and 107 records were screened. Overall 67 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility, and 21 articles were included for the study question. A total of 46 full-text articles were excluded with reasons. No studies could be included in quantitative synthesis (meta-analyses), and there were many confounding variables including surgeons' experience, prosthesis models used, and surgical technique. CONCLUSION Patients with hip fracture and with a viral infection in the upper respiratory tract or without major clinical symptoms should be operated on as soon as possible (LE: I-III). There is no evidence that patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) should be treated differently. In relation to pneumonia, its prevention is a major issue. Antibiotics should be administered if surgery is delayed by > 72 hours or if bacterial infection is present in the lower respiratory tract (LE: III-V). In patients with hip fracture and urinary tract infection (UTI), delaying surgery may provoke further complications (LE: I).

Xiaokeyinshui extract combination (XEC) originated from this ancient formula, consisting extracts of four herbal drugs, namely, Coptidis Rhizoma, Liriopes Radix, bitter melon, and Cassiae Semen. OBJECTIVE Therapeutic effects of Xiaokeyinshui extract combination (XEC) were assessed on diabetic rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS Herb extracts were prepared and mixed, yielding XEC. XEC were intragastrically given at doses of 260, 380 and 500 mg/kg/d to diabetic rats for 60 days. Anti-diabetic effects of XEC were studied, with measurement of body weight, and assessment of both glycemic control and lipid management. Measurement of oxidative stress and inflammatory cytokines were conducted in accordance to protocols of commercial kits. Parameters related to renal functions were also measured. Western blot (WB) analysis was performed to explore the anti-diabetic and renal protective mechanisms of XEC. RESULTS Compared to diabetic control, XEC exhibited significant effects in both glucose-lowering and lipid management (p < 0.01). Both oxidative stress and inflammatory cytokines were reduced after treatment of XEC for two months. In addition, XEC exhibited renal protective effects. WB analysis of liver tissue demonstrated that XEC achieved anti-diabetic effects through up-regulation of InsRα/IRS-1/PI3K/Akt/GLUT4 signaling pathway and phosphorylation of AMPK. In addition, renal protective effects were also achieved with down-regulation of RAGE and VEGF expressions in kidney. CONCLUSIONS XEC exerts promising anti-diabetic and renal protective effects on diabetic rats in multi-target mechanisms. XEC could be a satisfying alternative treating T2DM and preventing diabetic nephropathy.","Zhou, Jiewen; Pan, Jun; Xiang, Zhinan; Wang, Qiuyan; Tong, Qilin; Fang, Jinbo; Wan, Luosheng; Chen, Jiachun",Journal of ethnopharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2020.113098; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32726678/,33

However, the mechanism of base flipping in RNA remains poorly understood, in part due to the lack of atomistic details on complex rearrangements in neighboring bases. In this work, we applied transition path sampling (TPS) methods to study base flipping in a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) molecule that is known to interact with RNA-editing enzymes through this mechanism. We obtained an ensemble of 1000 transition trajectories to describe the base-flipping process. We used the likelihood maximization method to determine the refined reaction coordinate (RC) consisting of two collective variables (CVs), a distance and a dihedral angle between nucleotides that form stacking interactions with the flipping base. The free energy profile projected along the refined RC revealed three minima, two corresponding to the initial and final states and one for a metastable state. We suggest that the metastable state likely represents a wobbled conformation of nucleobases observed in NMR studies that is often characterized as the flipped state. The analyses of reactive trajectories further revealed that the base flipping is coupled to a global conformational change in a stem-loop of dsRNA.","Levintov, Lev; Paul, Sanjib; Vashisth, Harish",Journal of chemical theory and computation,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.0c01199; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33594886/,33

Significant shunts may increase the risk of developing pulmonary hypertension (PH). We aimed to describe current PH definitions, evaluate PH prevalence and the effect of PH on outcomes in patients undergoing percutaneous ASD closure. METHODS EMBASE, MEDLINE and Cochrane databases were systematically searched. Studies reporting PH prevalence or mean systolic pulmonary arterial pressure (sPAP) before and after percutaneous ASD closure in adults were included. We conducted meta-analyses to obtain summary estimates for PH prevalence and mean sPAP. RESULTS 15 articles with a total of 1073 patients met the eligibility criteria. Studies applied variable PH definitions. PH prevalence and mean sPAP levels decreased in all studies after closure. The pooled PH prevalence decreased from 44% (95% CI 29-60%) to 18% (95% CI 8-27%). The overall standardised mean difference in sPAP was 1.12 (95% CI 0.81-1.44) and 1.62 (95% CI 1.00-2.23) in cohort and case-series studies respectively indicating a large decrease. The pooled standard mean difference among the younger and older patients were different, 1.25 (95% CI 0.78-1.71) and 0.91 (95% CI 0.56-1.27), respectively. A high degree of between-study heterogeneity was noted. CONCLUSIONS Both PH prevalence and mean sPAP decrease after ASD closure.

Smartphone applications have been developed to provide real-time information to users regarding potential exposure, statistics, updated news, etc. Depending on the country, resources and government policies have created a wide range of products and applications. This narrative review paper focuses on providing a general overview of diagnostic kits and smartphone applications in three major countries, the U.S., South Korea, and China. Smartphone applications were used for tracing person-to-person contact and preventing the spread of COVID-19. These tools allowed public health officials to quickly identify people who may have had exposure to COVID-19 and allows them to act accordingly. In addition to discussing the mechanisms behind diagnostic kits, topics in legislation and policy for contact tracing will also be discussed.

Adequate activity of shank muscles is an important key for appropriate postural control. The aim of this study was to determine differences in muscle activation patterns of lower leg muscles between people with and without haemophilia during upright standing. SEMG of tibialis anterior (TA), fibularis longus (FL), lateral (LG) and medial (MG) heads of gastrocnemius, and soleus (SO) muscles of both sides were recorded in 25 haemophilic patients (H) and 25 non-haemophilic control subjects (C) while standing on even ground. The Gilbert-Score was used to assign sides to major (H-MA) and minor (H-MI) affected ankle joints in H. To normalize the SEMG amplitudes, amplitude ratios (percentage of cumulated activity) were calculated. Compared to controls, TA ratios showed higher and MG reduced levels in both H groups (P < 0.01). In the H-MA subgroup of H, FL also joined the TA behaviour whereas SO had similar activation direction as MG. Although possible descending influences from the knee joints cannot be excluded, this can be interpreted as a compensational mechanism due to the severity of the orthopaedic status of the ankle, which with increasing heaviness is accompanied by reduced plantar flexion capability. However, ankle joint integrity appears to be reduced in H, with TA and MG seeming to play key roles for neuromuscular control of upright posture.","Kurz, E; Anders, C; Herbsleb, M; Puta, C; Czepa, D; Hilberg, T",Haemophilia : the official journal of the World Federation of Hemophilia,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2516.2012.02852.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22642532/,33

High-intensity focused ultrasound, cryotherapy, photodynamic therapy, and brachytherapy have been assessed in up to Stage 2b studies. Laser interstitial thermotherapy and irreversible electroporation have been evaluated in up to Stage 2a studies. Radiofrequency has been evaluated in one Stage 1 study. Median follow-up varied between 4 mo and 61 mo, and the median rate of serious adverse events ranged between 0% and 10.6%. Pad-free leak-free continence and potency were obtained in 83.3-100% and 81.5-100%, respectively. In series with intention to treat, the median rate of significant and insignificant disease at control biopsy varied between 0% and 13.4% and 5.1% and 45.9%, respectively. The main limitations were the length of follow-up, the absence of a comparator arm, and study heterogeneity. CONCLUSIONS Focal therapy has been evaluated using seven sources of energy in single-arm retrospective and prospective development studies up to Stage 2b. Focal therapy seems to have a minor impact on quality of life and genito-urinary function. Oncological effectiveness is yet to be defined against standard of care. PATIENT SUMMARY Seven sources of energy have been employed to selectively ablate discrete areas of prostate cancer. There is high evidence that focal therapy is safe and has low detrimental impact on continence and potency. The oncological outcome has yet to be evaluated against standard of care.","Valerio, Massimo; Cerantola, Yannick; Eggener, Scott E; Lepor, Herbert; Polascik, Thomas J; Villers, Arnauld; Emberton, Mark",European urology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eururo.2016.08.044; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27595377/,33

This scoping review examines the extent and range of research undertaken to evaluate behavioral interventions to support women of childbearing age to prevent and treat overweight and obesity. METHODS Eight electronic databases were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCT) or systematic reviews of RCTs until 31st January 2018. Eligible studies included women of childbearing age (aged 15-44 years), evaluated interventions promoting behavior change related to diet or physical activity to achieve weight gain prevention, weight loss or maintenance and reported weight-related outcomes. RESULTS Ninety studies met the inclusion criteria (87 RCTs, 3 systematic reviews). Included studies were published from 1998 to 2018. The studies primarily focused on preventing excessive gestational weight gain (n = 46 RCTs, n = 2 systematic reviews), preventing postpartum weight retention (n = 18 RCTs) or a combination of the two (n = 14 RCTs, n = 1 systematic review). The RCTs predominantly evaluated interventions that aimed to change both diet and physical activity behaviors (n = 84) and were delivered in-person (n = 85). CONCLUSIONS This scoping review identified an increasing volume of research over time undertaken to support women of childbearing age to prevent and treat overweight and obesity. It highlights, however, that little research is being undertaken to support the young adult female population unrelated to pregnancy or preconception.","Hutchesson, Melinda J; de Jonge Mulock Houwer, Mette; Brown, Hannah M; Lim, Siew; Moran, Lisa J; Vincze, Lisa; Rollo, Megan E; Hollis, Jenna L",BMC women's health,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12905-020-0882-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31973716/,33
98263,Is breast surgery time critical when neo-adjuvant therapy is not appropriate?,2021-04-03,"The emergence of viral diseases such as Ebola virus disease, Zika virus disease, and the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has posed considerable challenges to health care systems around the world. Public health strategy to address emerging infectious diseases has depended in part on human behavior change and yet the perceptions and knowledge motivating that behavior have been at times inconsistent with the latest consensus of peer-reviewed science. Part of that disjuncture likely involves the existence and persistence of past ideas about other diseases. To forecast and prepare for future epidemic and pandemic response, we need to better understand how people approach emerging infectious diseases as objects of public opinion during the periods when such diseases first become salient at a population level. In this essay, we explore two examples of how existing mental models of past infectious diseases appear to have conditioned and constrained public response to novel viral diseases. We review previously reported experiences related to Zika virus in Central America and discuss public opinion data collected in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the case of Zika virus disease, we assess how thinking about earlier mosquito-borne disease seems to have affected public consideration of the virus in Guatemala. In the case of COVID-19, we assess how previous vaccination behavior for a different disease is associated with intention to obtain vaccination for COVID-19 in the future.","Southwell, Brian G; Kelly, Bridget J; Bann, Carla M; Squiers, Linda B; Ray, Sarah E; McCormack, Lauren A",Health communication,https://doi.org/10.1080/10410236.2020.1837462; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33081500/,33

Using ELISA, we quantified an average of 1100, 6200, and 2500 receptors per follicle cell (FC) at stages 8/9, 10, and ≥11 of oogenesis, respectively. Interestingly, the spatial localization of the EGFR to the apical side of the FCs at early stages depended on the TGF-alpha-like ligand Gurken. At later stages, EGFR localized to basolateral positions of the FCs. Finally, we followed the endosomal localization of EGFR in the FCs. The EGFR co-localized with the late endosome, but no significant co-localization of the receptor was found with the early endosome. The EGFR-sfGFP fly is an exciting new resource to study cellular localization and regulation of EGFR in tissues.","Revaitis, Nicole T; Niepielko, Matthew G; Marmion, Robert A; Klein, Eric A; Piccoli, Benedetto; Yakoby, Nir",Development,https://doi.org/10.1242/dev.183210; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32680934/,33
99016,Incorrect Unit of Measure.,2019,"Wide-spread misinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic has presented challenges for communicating public health recommendations. Should campaigns to promote protective behaviors focus on debunking misinformation or targeting behavior-specific beliefs? To address this question, we examine whether belief in COVID-19 misinformation is directly associated with two behaviors (face mask wearing and social distancing), and whether behavior-specific beliefs can account for this association and better predict behavior, consistent with behavior-change theory. We conducted a nationally representative two-wave survey of U.S. adults from 5/26/20-6/12/20 (n = 1074) and 7/15/20-7/21//20 (n = 889; follow-up response 83%). Scales were developed and validated for COVID-19 related misinformation beliefs, social distancing and face mask wearing, and beliefs about the consequences of both behaviors. Cross-lagged panel linear regression models assessed relationships among the variables. While belief in misinformation was negatively associated with both face mask wearing (B = -.27, SE =.06) and social-distancing behaviors (B = -.46, SE =.08) measured at the same time, misinformation did not predict concurrent or lagged behavior when the behavior-specific beliefs were incorporated in the models. Beliefs about behavioral outcomes accounted for face mask wearing and social distancing, both cross-sectionally (B =.43, SE =.05; B =.63, SE =.09) and lagged over time (B =.20, SE = 04; B =.30, SE =.08). In conclusion, belief in COVID-19-related misinformation is less relevant to protective behaviors, but beliefs about the consequences of these behaviors are important predictors. With regard to misinformation, we recommend health campaigns aimed at promoting protective behaviors emphasize the benefits of these behaviors, rather than debunking unrelated false claims.","Hornik, Robert; Kikut, Ava; Jesch, Emma; Woko, Chioma; Siegel, Leeann; Kim, Kwanho",Health communication,https://doi.org/10.1080/10410236.2020.1847437; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33225745/,33

The meaning of SVS regarding the results of mechanical thrombectomy with stent retrievers was investigated. METHODS Susceptibility vessel sign presence and length were studied in 153 acute ischaemic stroke patients (82 men; mean ± SD age 59 ± 17 years, baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score 17.2 ± 6.5) from three stroke centres, treated with either mechanical thrombectomy alone (n = 84) or bridging therapy (n = 69). Variables were compared between recanalizers, defined as thrombolysis in cerebral infarction (TICI) scores ≥2b, and non-recanalizers (TICI<2b). RESULTS The SVS was present in 113 (73.8%) patients. There was no association between the presence of SVS and recanalization, obtained in 86 (56.2%) patients, in the whole population [odds ratio (OR) 1.24, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53-2.92, P = 0.84) and in treatment subgroups (bridging: OR = 0.91, 95% CI 0.29-2.87, P = 1.0; thrombectomy alone: OR = 1.85, 95% CI 0.48-7.16, P = 0.54). However, in SVS+ patients, recanalization decreased with SVS length (OR 0.94 for each additional mm, 95% CI 0.89-0.99; P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS The success of recanalization in acute stroke patients treated with stent retrievers was related to thrombus length but not to the presence of SVS.","Soize, S; Batista, A L; Rodriguez Regent, C; Trystram, D; Tisserand, M; Turc, G; Serre, I; Ben Hassen, W; Zuber, M; Calvet, D; Mas, J-L; Meder, J-F; Raymond, J; Pierot, L; Oppenheim, C; Naggara, O",European journal of neurology,https://doi.org/10.1111/ene.12693; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25786977/,33

There are promising signs of improved diagnostic yields for pneumococcal pneumonia when using molecular techniques to detect pneumococcal gene sequences in blood or by combining serum biomarkers with rapid pneumococcal urinary antigen testing. Pathogens have traditionally been difficult to detect in pneumonia and treatment is usually successful with empiric antibiotics.

Somatic cells have previously been reprogrammed by transcription factors (TFs) into sensory ganglion (SG) neurons but not SG organoids. We identify a combination of triple TFs Ascl1, Brn3b/3a, and Isl1 (ABI) as an efficient means to reprogram mouse and human fibroblasts into self-organized and networked induced SG (iSG) organoids. The iSG neurons exhibit molecular features, subtype diversity, electrophysiological and calcium response properties, and innervation patterns characteristic of peripheral sensory neurons. Moreover, we have defined retinal ganglion cell (RGC)-specific identifiers to demonstrate the ability for ABI to reprogram induced RGCs (iRGCs) from fibroblasts. Unlike iSG neurons, iRGCs maintain a scattering distribution pattern characteristic of endogenous RGCs. iSG organoids may serve as a model to decipher the pathogenesis of sensorineural diseases and screen effective drugs and a source for cell replacement therapy.","Xiao, Dongchang; Deng, Qinqin; Guo, Yanan; Huang, Xiuting; Zou, Min; Zhong, Jiawei; Rao, Pinhong; Xu, Zihui; Liu, Yifan; Hu, Youjin; Shen, Yin; Jin, Kangxin; Xiang, Mengqing",Science advances,https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aaz5858; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32523990/,33

In this retrospective case series, we aim to analyze our early experience with robotic resection in 11 consecutive patients with chronic colonic diverticulitis complicated by fistula to bladder, vagina, or skin and to compare the results of the robotic approach to 20 patients undergoing laparoscopic resection for the same indication. Our main outcome measures include operative time, blood loss, conversion rate, transfusion rate, hospital length of stay, complications, readmission, and fistula healing rate. In our study, we found robotic resection for colonic diverticulitis with fistula was technically feasible and yielded 100% fistula healing rate. The operative time, complication and readmission rates were similar to laparoscopy. A higher conversion rate, diverting stoma need, and longer hospital length of stay were noted in the robotic group; however, these findings could have been attributed to a higher number of cases involving rectal excision in the robotic group.

It remains unclear how the epithelial spatial organization is maintained and how the transition zone niche is remodelled during metaplasia. Here we used single-cell RNA sequencing to characterize epithelial subpopulations and the underlying stromal compartment of endo- and ectocervix, encompassing the transition zone. Mouse lineage tracing, organoid culture and single-molecule RNA in situ hybridizations revealed that the two epithelia derive from separate cervix-resident lineage-specific stem cell populations regulated by opposing Wnt signals from the stroma. Using a mouse model of cervical metaplasia, we further show that the endocervical stroma undergoes remodelling and increases expression of the Wnt inhibitor Dickkopf-2 (DKK2), promoting the outgrowth of ectocervical stem cells. Our data indicate that homeostasis at the transition zone results from divergent stromal signals, driving the differential proliferation of resident epithelial lineages.","Chumduri, Cindrilla; Gurumurthy, Rajendra Kumar; Berger, Hilmar; Dietrich, Oliver; Kumar, Naveen; Koster, Stefanie; Brinkmann, Volker; Hoffmann, Kirstin; Drabkina, Marina; Arampatzi, Panagiota; Son, Dajung; Klemm, Uwe; Mollenkopf, Hans-Joachim; Herbst, Hermann; Mangler, Mandy; Vogel, Jörg; Saliba, Antoine-Emmanuel; Meyer, Thomas F",Nature cell biology,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41556-020-00619-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33462395/,33

101231,American Society for Enhanced Recovery and Perioperative Quality Initiative Joint Consensus Statement on Postoperative Gastrointestinal Dysfunction Within an Enhanced Recovery Pathway for Elective Colorectal Surgery.,2018,"Accidental exposure by inhalation to alpha-emitting particles from mixed oxide (MOX: uranium and plutonium oxide) fuels is a potential long-term health risk to workers in nuclear fuel fabrication plants. For MOX fuels, the risk of lung cancer development may be different from that assigned to individual components (plutonium, uranium) given different physico-chemical characteristics. The objective of this study was to investigate late effects in rat lungs following inhalation of MOX aerosols of similar particle size containing 2.5 or 7.1% plutonium. Conscious rats were exposed to MOX aerosols and kept for their entire lifespan. Different initial lung burdens (ILBs) were obtained using different amounts of MOX. Lung total alpha activity was determined by external counting and at autopsy for total lung dose calculation. Fixed lung tissue was used for anatomopathological, autoradiographical, and immunohistochemical analyses. Inhalation of MOX at ILBs ranging from 1-20 kBq resulted in lung pathologies (90% of rats) including fibrosis (70%) and malignant lung tumors (45%). High ILBs (4-20 kBq) resulted in reduced survival time (N = 102; p < 0.05) frequently associated with lung fibrosis. Malignant tumor incidence increased linearly with dose (up to 60 Gy) with a risk of 1-1.6% Gy for MOX, similar to results for industrial plutonium oxide alone (1.9% Gy). Staining with antibodies against Surfactant Protein-C, Thyroid Transcription Factor-1, or Oct-4 showed differential labeling of tumor types. In conclusion, late effects following MOX inhalation result in similar risk for development of lung tumors as compared with industrial plutonium oxide.","Griffiths, N M; Van der Meeren, A; Fritsch, P; Abram, M-C; Bernaudin, J-F; Poncy, J L",Health physics,https://doi.org/10.1097/hp.0b013e3181c75750; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20699696/,33

The true frequency of this condition remains uncertain, due, in part, to differences in the diagnostic criteria and in the affected populations, as well as relative lack of patient and physician awareness and understanding of this condition. Postbariatric hypoglycemia can be severe and disabling for some patients, with neuroglycopenia (altered cognition, seizures, and loss of consciousness) leading to falls, motor vehicle accidents, and job and income loss. Moreover, repeated episodes of hypoglycemia can result in hypoglycemia unawareness, further impairing safety and requiring the assistance of others to treat hypoglycemia. Objective In this review, we summarize and integrate data from studies of patients affected by hypoglycemia after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery, obtained from PubMed searches (1990 to 2017) and reference searches of relevant retrieved articles. Whereas hypoglycemia can also be observed after sleeve gastrectomy and fundoplication, this review is focused on post-RYGB, given the greater body of published clinical studies at present. Outcome Measures Data addressing specific aspects of diagnosis, pathophysiology, and treatment were reviewed by the authors; when not available, the authors have provided opinions based on clinical experience with this challenging condition. Conclusions Hypoglycemia, occurring after gastric bypass surgery, is challenging for patients and physicians alike.

We postulated that recesses on the posterior wall of the nasopharynx might be associated with tube impingement. Using multiplanar imaging and clinical statistics, we evaluated whether anatomical variations in the recesses are related to successful intubation via the right nostril. METHODS Using multiplanar computed tomography (CT) images of 97 patients, we investigated the locations of recesses relative to the mid-sagittal plane, nasal floor plane and posterior end of the nasal septum, and their shapes. Incidents of impingement of the tube during nasotracheal intubation and the shapes of the fossa of Rosenmüller on CT images were retrospectively evaluated in 170 patients. RESULTS Eustachian tube orifices were located approximately 10 mm laterally from the sagittal plane, and approximately 10 mm above the nasal floor plane. The fossa of Rosenmüller was vertically elongated and located 7 mm laterally from the mid-sagittal plane. Pharyngeal bursae were found in 15 % of the subjects. Patients with failed insertion via the right nostril due to impingement frequently had a wide opening of the fossa of Rosenmüller. CONCLUSIONS Successful intubation via the right nostril is related to the anatomy of structures on the posterior nasopharyngeal wall, particularly recesses located close to the path of nasotracheal tube insertion. Nasopharyngeal anatomical variations should be considered when one notices any resistance to advancement of the tube into the nasopharynx during nasotracheal intubation.","Takasugi, Yoshihiro; Futagawa, Koichi; Konishi, Tatsuo; Morimoto, Daisuke; Okuda, Takahiko",Journal of anesthesia,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00540-016-2253-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27678497/,33

METHODS A total of 21 different coloured samples made of pink gingiva Heraceram porcelain were used. Dentists (n = 54), dental assistants (n = 56), dental students (n = 126) and participants unrelated to dentistry (n = 116) were asked to identify pairs of samples that appeared identical. In addition, they were asked to indicate the pairs of samples whose colour they considered to be acceptable for use in a dental rehabilitation. A least squares regression was adjusted using an S-shaped curve of the equation y = exp (B0 + B1/x). The adjusted model was used to predict a colour difference value for an acceptability percentage of 50%. RESULTS The threshold value for the perception of colour changes in human gingiva varies from ΔEab* 2.3 ± 0.38 units and CIEDE2000 (ΔE00) 1.5 ± 0.28units (dental students) to ΔEab* 2.7 ± 0.43 units and ΔE00 1.8 ± 0.30 units (participants unrelated to dentistry). The threshold of gingival acceptability varies from ΔEab* 2.9 ± 0.43 units and ΔE00 2.0 ± 0.31 units (dental assistants) to ΔEab* 3.6 ± 0.54 units and ΔE00 2.5 ± 0.41 units (dental students). CONCLUSION From the total number of samples, the average threshold of perception for the gingival chromatic space is 3.1 units for ΔEab* and 2.1 units for ΔE00. Moreover, the mean gingival acceptance threshold is 4.1 units for ΔEab* and 2.9 units for ΔE00. These thresholds are similar for all professional categories studied. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE The determination of the perception and acceptability thresholds in the gingival chromatic space are of special relevance for designing the physical shade tabs used in gingival colour guides. The results from this work will aid in selecting optimal gingival colour for patients.","Gómez-Polo, Cristina; Martín Casado, Ana María; Gómez-Polo, Miguel; Montero, Javier",Journal of dentistry,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jdent.2020.103502; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33069771/,33

DESIGN Randomized controlled trial - a secondary analysis. SETTING University hospital setting. PARTICIPANTS One-hundred older adults with mild to moderate PD (Hoehn & Yahr 2 and 3). INTERVENTION Training group (n = 51): 10 weeks (3 times/week) of intensive balance and gait training, incorporating dual tasks. Control group (n = 49): care as usual. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Spatiotemporal gait variables collected during normal and fast walking on a pressure-sensitive mat. A linear mixed model was used to evaluate training effects post intervention and at the 6 and 12 month follow-up. RESULTS Immediate training effects in the pace domain of gait were increased step velocity (normal speed: 8.2 cm/s, P = 0.04; fast: 10.8 cm/s, P < 0.01), increased step length (normal speed: 3 cm, P = 0.05; fast: 2.3 cm, P = 0.05) and reduced swing time variability (fast speed: -2.5 ms, P = 0.02). In the rhythm domain reduced step time (fast speed: -19.3 ms, P = 0.02), stance time (normal: -24.3 ms, P = 0.01; fast: -29.6 ms, P = 0.02) and swing time (fast speed: -8.7 ms, P = 0.04) was seen. Relative to the variability domain, the training decreased step time variability (fast: -2.8 ms, P = 0.02) and stance time variability (fast: -3.9 ms, P = 0.02). No training effects were retained at 6 months. CONCLUSIONS Highly challenging balance and gait training improved pace, rhythm and variability aspects of PD gait in the short-term, but effects are not retained long-term.

The purpose of this study was to assess the impact on neuroimaging utilisation at an academic medical centre in the United States caused by this shutdown. METHODS Exam volumes from 1 February 2020 to 11 August 2020 were calculated based on patient location, including outpatient, inpatient and emergency, as well as modality type, including computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. 13 March 2020 was designated as the beginning of the shutdown period for the radiology department and 1 May 2020 was designated as the reopening date. The scan volumes during the pre-shutdown, shutdown and post-shutdown periods were compared using t-tests. RESULTS Overall, neuroimaging scan volumes declined significantly by 41% during the shutdown period and returned to 98% of the pre-shutdown period levels after the shutdown, with an estimated 3231 missed scans. Outpatient scan volumes were more greatly affected than inpatient scan volumes, while emergency scan volumes declined the least during the shutdown. In addition, the magnetic resonance imaging scan volumes declined to a greater degree than the computed tomography scan volumes during the shutdown. CONCLUSION The shutdown from the COVID-19 pandemic had a substantial but transient impact on neuroimaging utilisation overall, with variable magnitude depending on patient location and modality type.","Ginat, Daniel Thomas; Kenniff, James",The neuroradiology journal,https://doi.org/10.1177/1971400920988664; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33472535/,33

METHODS A nationwide register-based study covering all people living in Denmark on December 31st, 2010 was performed. Within this population all umbilical and epigastric hernia repairs from January 1st, 2006 to December 31st, 2010 were identified using data from the Danish National Hospital Register, and 5-year prevalence estimates were calculated. RESULTS The study population covered 5,639,885 persons (49 % males). A total of 10,107 patients (68 % males) were operated for an umbilical hernia and 2412 patients (55 % males) were operated for an epigastric hernia. The age-specific 5-year prevalence differed for both hernia types. The highest 5-year prevalence of umbilical hernia repairs was seen in males aged 60-70 years with a 5-year prevalence of 0.53 % (95 % CI 0.51-0.56 %) and the highest age-specific 5-year prevalence of epigastric hernia repair was seen in 40-50 year females with a 5-year prevalence of 0.086 % (95 % CI 0.077-0.095 %). CONCLUSION The gender and age-specific 5-year prevalence of umbilical and epigastric hernia repair differed in a nationwide population.","Burcharth, J; Pedersen, M S; Pommergaard, H-C; Bisgaard, T; Pedersen, C B; Rosenberg, J",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10029-015-1376-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25840852/,33

105992,Treatment options for symptomatic carotid stenosis: timing and approach.,2015,"PURPOSE To use baseline computed tomographic (CT) angiography to analyze imaging and clinical end points in an Interventional Management of Stroke III cohort to identify patients who would benefit from endovascular stroke therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS The primary clinical end point was 90-day dichotomized modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score. Secondary end points were 90-day mRS score distribution and 24-hour recanalization. Prespecified subgroup was baseline proximal occlusions (internal carotid, M1, or basilar arteries). Exploratory analyses were subsets with any occlusion and specific sites of occlusion (two-sided α = .01). RESULTS Of 656 subjects, 306 (47%) underwent baseline CT angiography or magnetic resonance angiography. Of 306, 282 (92%) had arterial occlusions. At baseline CT angiography, proximal occlusions (n = 220) demonstrated no difference in primary outcome (41.3% [62 of 150] endovascular vs 38% [27 of 70] intravenous [IV] tissue-plasminogen activator [tPA]; relative risk, 1.07 [99% confidence interval: 0.67, 1.70]; P = .70); however, 24-hour recanalization rate was higher for endovascular treatment (n = 167; 84.3% [97 of 115] endovascular vs 56% [29 of 52] IV tPA; P < .001). Exploratory subgroup analysis for any occlusion at baseline CT angiography did not demonstrate significant differences between endovascular and IV tPA arms for primary outcome (44.7% [85 of 190] vs 38% [35 of 92], P = .29), although ordinal shift analysis of full mRS distribution demonstrated a trend toward more favorable outcome (P = .011). Carotid T- or L-type occlusion (terminal internal carotid artery [ICA] with M1 middle cerebral artery and/or A1 anterior cerebral artery involvement) or tandem (extracranial or intracranial) ICA and M1 occlusion subgroup also showed a trend favoring endovascular treatment over IV tPA alone for primary outcome (26% [12 of 46] vs 4% [one of 23], P = .047). CONCLUSION Significant differences were identified between treatment arms for 24-hour recanalization in proximal occlusions; carotid T- or L-type and tandem ICA and M1 occlusions showed greater recanalization and a trend toward better outcome with endovascular treatment. Vascular imaging should be mandated in future endovascular trials to identify such occlusions.

Among them, 78 were the first cases of a household, with 174 household contacts. Of the 174 contacts, 21 contracted infection, indicating a secondary attack rate of 12.1% (95% confidence interval (CI) 7.6-17.9%). No significant differences were observed in the demographics and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) test results between first cases who became the source of infection to the household members or not. The secondary attack rates per various characteristics of the household members were significantly different: aged > 69 years (40.9% [95% CI 20.7-63.6%]) and those with underlying diseases (36.0% [95% CI 18.0-57.5%]). When the period from the onset to the isolation of the first household case was within 3 days, the secondary attack rate was low (4.5% [95% CI 0.1-22.8%]). Among the 21 secondary cases, 11 (52.4%) developed within 5 days from symptom onset in the first case within the same household. This indicates that secondary infection within the household occurred immediately after symptom onset in the first case. Thus, isolation of a suspected patient is a solution to reduce secondary household infections.","Kuba, Yumani; Shingaki, Ayako; Nidaira, Minoru; Kakita, Tetsuya; Maeshiro, Noriyuki; Oyama, Minori; Kudeken, Tsuyoshi; Miyagi, Ayano; Yamauchi, Miyuki; Kyan, Hisako",Japanese journal of infectious diseases,https://doi.org/10.7883/yoken.jjid.2020.943; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33952770/,33

The desirable microfluidic structure was photo-patterned in a poly(vinyl acetate) (PVAc) film deposited on glass substrate to produce a low-relief master. Then, this template was used to generate a high-relief pattern in stiffened PDMS (S-PDMS) by increasing of curing agent /monomer ratio (1:5) followed by thermal aging in a laboratory oven (200°C for 24 h). The S-PDMS masters were used to replicate microfluidic devices in PMMA based on soft embossing at 220-230°C and thermal sealing at 140°C. Both embossing and sealing stages were performed by using binder clips. The proposed protocol has ensured the replication of microfluidic devices in PMMA with great fidelity (> 94%). Examples of ME devices, droplet generator devices and spot test array were successfully demonstrated. For testing ME devices, a mixture containing inorganic cations was selected as model and the achieved analytical performance did not reveal significant difference from commercial PMMA devices. Water droplets were successfully generated in an oil phase at rate of ca. 60 droplets/min (fixing the continuous phase flow rate at 100 μL/h) with size of ca. 322 ± 6 μm. Glucose colorimetric assay was performed on spot test devices and good detectability level was achieved. The obtained results for two artificial serum samples revealed good agreement with the certified concentrations. Based on the fabrication simplicity and great analytical performance, the proposed soft-embossing protocol may emerge as promising approach for manufacturing PMMA devices.

107010,Brain Connectivity and Cognitive Impairment.,2020-09-01,"Chloroplast proteostasis is governed by a network of peptidases. As a part of this network, we show that Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) chloroplast glutamyl peptidase (CGEP) is a homo-oligomeric stromal serine-type (S9D) peptidase with both exo- and endo-peptidase activity. Arabidopsis CPEG null mutant alleles (cgep) had no visible phenotype but showed strong genetic interactions with stromal CLP protease system mutants, resulting in reduced growth. Loss of CGEP upregulated the chloroplast protein chaperone machinery and 70S ribosomal proteins, but other parts of the proteostasis network were unaffected. Both comparative proteomics and mRNA-based co-expression analyses strongly suggested that the function of CGEP is at least partly involved in starch metabolism regulation. Recombinant CGEP degraded peptides and proteins smaller than ~25 kDa. CGEP specifically cleaved substrates on the C-terminal side of Glu irrespective of neighboring residues, as shown using peptide libraries incubated with recombinant CGEP and mass spectrometry. CGEP was shown to undergo auto-catalytic C-terminal cleavage at E946, removing 15 residues, both in vitro and in vivo. A conserved motif (A[S/T]GGG[N/G]PE946) immediately upstream of E946 was identified in dicotyledons, but not monocotyledons. Structural modeling suggested that C-terminal processing increases the upper substrate size limit by improving catalytic cavity access. In vivo complementation with catalytically inactive CGEP-S781R or a CGEP variant with an unprocessed C-terminus in a cgep clpr2-1 background was used to demonstrate the physiological importance of both CGEP peptidase activity and its autocatalytic processing. CGEP homologs of photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic bacteria lack the C-terminal prosequence, suggesting it is a recent functional adaptation in plants.","Bhuiyan, Nazmul H; Rowland, Elden; Friso, Giulia; Ponnala, Lalit; Michel, Elena Js; van Wijk, Klaas Jan",Plant physiology,https://doi.org/10.1104/pp.20.00752; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32663165/,33
107108,Modified uterine allotransplantation and immunosuppression procedure in the sheep model.,2013,"Nucleocapsid protein (NP), an essential RNA-binding viral protein in human coronavirus (CoV)-infected cells, is required for the replication and transcription of viral RNA. Recent studies suggested that human CoV NP is a valid target for antiviral drug development. Based on this aspect, structure-based virtual screening targeting nucleocapsid protein (NP) was performed to identify good chemical starting points for medicinal chemistry. The present study utilized structure-based virtual screening against human CoV-OC43 using the Zinc database, which is performed through docking with varying precisions and computational intensities to identify eight potential compounds. The chosen potential leads were further validated experimentally using biophysical means. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis indicated that one among the potential leads, 6-chloro-7-(2-morpholin-4-yl-ethylamino) quinoxaline-5,8-dione (small-compound H3), exhibited a significant decrease of RNA-binding capacity of NP by more than 20%. The loss of binding activity was manifested as a 20% decrease in the minimum on-rate accompanied with a 70% increase in the maximum off-rate. Fluorescence titration and X-ray crystallography studies indicated that H3 antagonizes the binding between HCoV-OC43 NP and RNA by interacting with the N-terminal domain of the NP. Our findings provide insight into the development of new therapeutics that disrupt the interaction between RNA and viral NP in the HCoV. The discovery of the new compound would be an impetus to design novel NP inhibitors against human CoV.","Chang, Chung-ke; Jeyachandran, Sivakamavalli; Hu, Nien-Jen; Liu, Chia-Ling; Lin, Shing-Yen; Wang, Yong-Sheng; Chang, Yu-Ming; Hou, Ming-Hon",Molecular bioSystems,https://doi.org/10.1039/c5mb00582e; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26542199/,33

The aim of this study was to determine the functional impact of elective laparoscopic sigmoidectomy performed with high ligation of the inferior mesenteric artery for diverticulitis in consecutive male patients. METHODS Twenty-five consecutive patients of median age 53 years were enrolled in a prospective single-centre pilot study at a tertiary teaching hospital. Main outcome measures were functional results. Patients were asked to complete standardized, validated questionnaires to evaluate preoperative and 6 months postoperative bowel symptomatology (Jorge-Wexner Incontinence Score and KESS score), urinary function (IPSS), and sexual function (IIEF). Secondary outcomes were surgical data, morbidity, and quality of life (SF-36). RESULTS There were no significant differences between preoperative and 6 months postoperative total scores for bowel symptomatology, urinary function, and sexual function. There were no perioperative deaths. The morbidity rate was 12% including three minor and no major events. Quality of life demonstrated statistically better general health (p < 0.01) and better medical status over the prior 4 weeks at 6 months after surgery, compared to baseline. This single-centre prospective study has a limited number of patients, relatively short follow-up time, and includes only male patients. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic sigmoidectomy with high tie of the inferior mesenteric artery for diverticular disease does not induce functional disorders at 6 months after surgery.

Exposed necrotic jawbone sites surgically managed by intraoral soft tissue closure were evaluated. Either barbed sutures (Stratafix™ or V-Loc™) together with Prolene® or Vicryl® sutures were used. We estimated the effect of barbed sutures (BS) with Prolene® compared to smooth sutures (Vicryl®) on the hazard rate of intraoral soft tissue dehiscence using a multivariate Cox regression model within a target trial framework, adjusting for relevant confounders. In total, 306 operations were performed in 188 sites. In the primary analysis 182 sites without prior surgery were included. Of these, 113 sites developed a dehiscence during follow-up. 84 sites were operated using BS and Prolene®. A total of 222 sites were operated with Vicryl® (control group). In the BS group, the median time to event (i.e., dehiscence) was 148 days (interquartile range (IQR), 42-449 days) compared to 15 days (IQR, 12-52 days) in the control group. The hazard rate of developing intraoral dehiscence was 0.03 times (95%-confidence interval (CI): 0.01; 0.14, p < 0.001) lower for BS patients compared to the control group. Within the limits of a retrospective study, BS showed a high success rate and are therefore recommended for soft tissue closure of exposed jawbone sites in MRONJ patients. Additional studies are warranted to further evaluate this novel application of BS.","Laimer, Johannes; Hechenberger, Martin; Lercher, Johanna Maria; Born, Eva; Schomaker, Michael; Puntscher, Sibylle; Siebert, Uwe; Bruckmoser, Emanuel",Journal of clinical medicine,https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10081677; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33919696/,33

Finally, the paper emphasizes Viktor Frankl's cure and Wong's integrative meaning therapy. It concludes that integrative meaning therapy represents the future of psychotherapy, because it is situated in the area of interactions of at least three traditions: Clinical psychology, existential psychology, and positive psychology.

We hypothesized that endothelial damage may lead to substantially increased concentrations of von Willebrand factor with subsequent relative deficiency of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13 (ADAMTS13). DESIGN Prospective controlled cross-over trial. SETTING Blood samples of patients with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 and healthy controls were obtained in three German hospitals and analyzed in a German hemostaseologic laboratory. PATIENTS Seventy-five patients with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 of mild to critical severity and 30 healthy controls. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS von Willebrand factor antigen, ADAMTS13, and von Willebrand factor multimer formation were analyzed. von Willebrand factor antigen was 4.1 times higher in COVID-19 patients compared with healthy controls (p < 0.0001), whereas ADAMTS13 activities were not significantly different (p = 0.18). The ADAMTS13/von Willebrand factor antigen ratio was significantly lower in COVID-19 than in the control group (24.4 ± 20.5 vs 82.0 ± 30.7; p < 0.0001). Fourteen patients (18.7%) undercut a critical ratio of 10 as described in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Gel analysis of multimers resembled a thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura pattern with loss of the largest multimers in 75% and a smeary triplet pattern in 39% of the patients. The ADAMTS13/von Willebrand factor antigen ratio decreased continuously from mild to critical disease (analysis of variance p = 0.026). Furthermore, it differed significantly between surviving patients and those who died from COVID-19 (p = 0.001) yielding an area under the curve of 0.232 in receiver operating characteristic curve curve analysis. CONCLUSION COVID-19 is associated with a substantial increase in von Willebrand factor levels, which can exceed the ADAMTS13 processing capacity resulting in the formation of large von Willebrand factor multimers indistinguishable from thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. The ADAMTS13/von Willebrand factor antigen ratio is an independent predictor of severity of disease and mortality. These findings provide a rationale to consider plasma exchange as a therapeutic option in COVID-19 and to include von Willebrand factor and ADAMTS13 in the diagnostic workup.","Doevelaar, Adrian A N; Bachmann, Martin; Hölzer, Bodo; Seibert, Felix S; Rohn, Benjamin J; Bauer, Frederic; Witzke, Oliver; Dittmer, Ulf; Bachmann, Michael; Yilmaz, Serap; Dittmer, Rita; Schneppenheim, Sonja; Babel, Nina; Budde, Ulrich; Westhoff, Timm H",Critical care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/ccm.0000000000004918; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33591004/,33

We aimed to share our experience at a single center with an emphasis on collective decision making. MATERIALS AND METHODS A suspected case was defined as the presence of symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 and/or positive contact history. SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive patients were defined as confirmed COVID-19. Between March 12, 2020, and May 15, 2020, all children presenting with fever, cough, or respiratory difficulty were investigated for COVID-19. A total of 719 children were examined at outpatient clinics, and 495 were tested with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for suspicion of COVID-19. A team was organized for monitoring and treating patients either as outpatients or hospitalization. Patients were evaluated in terms of age, gender, travel history, epidemiological history, clinical symptoms and signs, laboratory and radiological findings, treatment, and outcome. RESULTS Sixty patients were hospitalized for suspicion of COVID-19. Forty-three patients were diagnosed as probable or confirmed COVID-19. 21 of 43 patients (48.8%) were PCR confirmed. The remaining 22 were diagnosed by epidemiologic history, clinical assessment, and computerized thorax tomography (CT) findings. The median age was 126 and 78.5 months in PCR positives and PCR negatives, respectively and the youngest patient was a 28 days old baby. Nineteen of the patients had an upper respiratory infection (44.1%). Although five patients had no clinical signs, chest X-ray, or CT revealed pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS As previously reported, the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 in children are mostly mild. Even very young kids can become infected following exposure to sick family members. International and local guidelines are valuable for decision making since it is a new disease. A combination of chest disease, infectious diseases, and emergency care physicians approach will aid the appropriate management of cases.","Duramaz, Burcu Bursal; Turel, Ozden; Korkmaz, Cigdem; Karadogan, Muhammed Talha; Yozgat, Can Yilmaz; Iscan, Akin; Sümbül, Bilge; Erenberk, Ufuk",Klinische Padiatrie,https://doi.org/10.1055/a-1263-1222; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33124020/,33
109043,Voluntary and electrically-induced muscle fatigue differently affect postural control mechanisms in unipedal stance.,2019,"COVID-19 infection can cause psychological distress and profoundly impact patients' lives, but it can also lead to positive changes and post-traumatic growth (PTG), or positive psychological change in response to challenging life circumstances. Current research on the influence of COVID-19 infection has mainly focused on its negative effects. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate whether patients with COVID-19 in China experienced PTG and, if so, what changed for them during the process of PTG. We used a qualitative descriptive approach to conduct this study. Using the purposive sampling recruitment method, patients with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis were recruited from a COVID-19 designated hospital in Shanghai, China, from April to July 2020. Data were collected using semi-structured, in-depth interviews conducted via cell phone or in person while social distancing to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Forty confirmed COVID-19 patients (19-68 years old) were recruited. Several prominent themes and subthemes were extracted from the interview responses regarding participants' experiences of PTG. The following are among the positive changesthat occurred for these participants after their diagnosis of COVID-19: (1) Reevaluation of their life priorities, which included a greater appreciation of being alive and re-evaluating their values and goals, (2) Improved relationships within their social circles, which included establishing or maintaining closer relationships with family and friends and a greater willingness to help others, and (3) Perceived changes regarding themselves, which included personal growth and increased awareness of the importance of their health. The study identified potential positive impacts of COVID-19 on patients, which could be helpful in the implementation of interventions to facilitate PTG among COVID-19 survivors.","Sun, Wenxiu; Chen, Wei-Ti; Zhang, Qing; Ma, Siyue; Huang, Feifei; Zhang, Lin; Lu, Hongzhou",Clinical nursing research,https://doi.org/10.1177/10547738211016951; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34018405/,33
109130,Modulation of specific inhibitory networks in fatigued locomotor muscles of healthy males.,2018,"Purpose Our aim was to critically review recent literature on the use of telehealth for dysphagia during the COVID-19 pandemic and enhance this information in order to provide evidence- and practice-based clinical guidance during and after the pandemic. Method We conducted a rapid systematized review to identify telehealth adaptations during COVID-19, according to peer-reviewed articles published from January to August 2020. Of the 40 articles identified, 11 met the inclusion criteria. Full-text reviews were completed by three raters, followed by qualitative synthesis of the results and description of practical recommendations for the use of telehealth for dysphagia. Results Seven articles were guidelines articles, three were editorials, and one was a narrative review. One article focused on telehealth and dysphagia during COVID-19. The remaining 10 mentioned telehealth in varying degrees while focusing on dysphagia management during the pandemic. No articles discussed pediatrics in depth. The most common procedure for which telehealth was recommended was the clinical swallowing assessment (8/11), followed by therapy (7/11). Six articles characterized telehealth as a second-tier service delivery option. Only one article included brief guidance on telehealth-specific factors, such as legal safeguards, safety, privacy, infrastructure, and facilitators. Conclusions Literature published during the pandemic on telehealth for dysphagia is extremely limited and guarded in endorsing telehealth as an equivalent service delivery model. We have presented prepandemic and emerging current evidence for the safety and reliability of dysphagia telemanagement, in combination with practical guidelines to facilitate the safe adoption of telehealth during and after the pandemic.","Malandraki, Georgia A; Arkenberg, Rachel Hahn; Mitchell, Samantha S; Malandraki, Jaime Bauer",American journal of speech-language pathology,https://doi.org/10.1044/2020_ajslp-20-00252; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33555933/,33
109346,Augmented repair of radial meniscus tear with biomimetic electrospun scaffold: an in vitro mechanical analysis.,2016,"Stewart-Bluefarb syndrome is a rare angioproliferative disorder characterised by acroangiodermatitis associated with an underlying arteriovenous shunt. This condition should be differentiated from acroangiodermatitis of Mali classically described in association with chronic venous insufficiency. Patients with Stewart-Bluefarb syndrome typically present with lower leg pigmented macules, papules and plaques that can coalesce to form larger confluent patches of pigmentation. Recognition of Stewart-Bluefarb syndrome may be difficult or delayed as the cutaneous manifestations may resemble a variety of other dermatological conditions. Most commonly, acroangiodermatitis may be confused with Kaposi's sarcoma and the condition is often referred to as 'Pseudo-Kaposi's sarcoma'. Acroangiodermatitis may also resemble or coexist with pigmentation of chronic venous insufficiency. As seen in this report, acroangiodermatitis may also be clinically confused with the 'cavernous' form of a capillary malformation. Here, we describe five patients with Stewart-Bluefarb syndrome. In one female and two male patients the diagnosis was delayed as the acroangiodermatitis closely resembled other conditions. All underlying arterio-venous communications were initially diagnosed on duplex ultrasound and confirmed with magnetic resonance angiography. Four patients were found to have a congenital arterio-venous malformation while one was diagnosed with a post-thrombotic arterio-venous fistula. Management included observation and intervention using a variety of techniques including percutaneous or trans-catheter embolisation, endovenous laser, radiofrequency ablation and foam ultrasound guided sclerotherapy. This case series highlights the challenges involved in the diagnosis and management of Stewart-Bluefarb syndrome. Given the local and systemic sequelae of high flow shunts, correct diagnosis and early detection of the underlying arterio-venous abnormality is crucial in the long-term management of these patients and in preventing the associated complications.","Parsi, K; O'Connor, A A; Bester, L",Phlebology,https://doi.org/10.1177/0268355514548090; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25121559/,33

111279,Neonatal and Children's Immune System and COVID-19: Biased Immune Tolerance versus Resistance Strategy.,2020-08-21,"Although bacteria are the main pathogens involved in community-acquired pneumonia, a significant number of community-acquired pneumonia are caused by viruses, either directly or as part of a co-infection. The clinical picture of these different pneumonias can be very similar, but viral infection is more common in the pediatric and geriatric populations, leukocytes are not generally elevated, fever is variable, and upper respiratory tract symptoms often occur; procalcitonin levels are not generally affected. For years, the diagnosis of viral pneumonia was based on cell culture and antigen detection, but since the introduction of polymerase chain reaction techniques in the clinical setting, identification of these pathogens has increased and new microorganisms such as human bocavirus have been discovered. In general, influenza virus type A and syncytial respiratory virus are still the main pathogens involved in this entity. However, in recent years, outbreaks of deadly coronavirus and zoonotic influenza virus have demonstrated the need for constant alert in the face of new emerging pathogens. Neuraminidase inhibitors for viral pneumonia have been shown to reduce transmission in cases of exposure and to improve the clinical progress of patients in intensive care; their use in common infections is not recommended. Ribavirin has been used in children with syncytial respiratory virus, and in immunosuppressed subjects. Apart from these drugs, no antiviral has been shown to be effective. Prevention with anti-influenza virus vaccination and with monoclonal antibodies, in the case of syncytial respiratory virus, may reduce the incidence of pneumonia.","Galván, José María; Rajas, Olga; Aspa, Javier",Archivos de bronconeumologia,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arbres.2015.02.015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25957460/,33

Upper-room UVGI is more effective for air disinfection than mechanical ventilation at much lower installation and operating costs. Conventional upper-room UVGI fixtures employ multiple tightly spaced horizontal louvers to confine UV to the upper-room. These louvered fixtures protect occupants in the lower-room from UV-induced eye and skin irritation, but at a major cost to fixture efficiency. Using a lamp and ballast from a conventional upper-room UVGI fixture in the eggcrate UV system, the germicidal efficacy was markedly improved even though the UV radiation emitted by the lamp was unchanged. This fundamental change in the application of upper-room UVGI air disinfection should permit wider, more effective application of UVGI globally to reduce the spread of airborne infection.","Linnes, J C; Rudnick, S N; Hunt, G M; McDevitt, J J; Nardell, E A",Indoor air,https://doi.org/10.1111/ina.12063; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23889191/,33
112306,Facts and ideas from anywhere.,2020-07-01,"INTRODUCTION The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the pREset stent retriever in a real-world clinical setting. METHODS Patients treated with pREset were selected from a prospectively maintained single-center database. A TICI score ≥2b after ≤3 passes was regarded as successful recanalization. All device-related complications and their clinical significance were reported. Parenchymal hematomas (PH) were classified according to ECASS, adding focal and diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) as categories. A 90-day mRS of 0-2 was defined as favorable outcome. In addition, we separately analyzed patients treated with >3 pREset passes and patients receiving other rescue maneuvers. RESULTS We included 271 patients. Successful recanalization was achieved in 76.4 %. Device-related complications occurred in 9.2 % of which 2.2 % were clinically significant. PH I, PH II, focal SAH, and diffuse SAH was observed in 5.2, 4.8, 12.2, and 2.2 %, respectively. A total of 39.5 % of patients had favorable clinical outcome. Considering treatments with >3 pREset passes or other rescue procedures, an additional 8.5 and 9.3 % of target vessels were recanalized. The chance of favorable clinical outcome decreased significantly with any kind of rescue therapy. In addition, the rate of PH I was significantly higher in patients treated with >3 pREset passes, whereas all other types of hemorrhage showed no difference. CONCLUSION In terms of safety and effectiveness, pREset performed comparably to other stent retriever devices. To avoid futile recanalization and potential additional harm, escalation of therapy beyond three thrombectomy passes should only be performed after careful individual consideration of each case.","Kurre, Wiebke; Aguilar-Pérez, Marta; Schmid, Elisabeth; Sperber, Wolfgang; Bäzner, Hansjörg; Henkes, Hans",Neuroradiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00234-014-1346-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24619135/,33

Chickens primed or primed and boosted with a Massachusetts (Mass)-type attenuated vaccine were subsequently challenged with either IBV Arkansas (Ark) or GA13-type virulent strains. In addition, Ark-vaccinated chickens were challenged with IBV GA13. Spike protein 1 (S1) amino acid identities between IBV vaccine and challenge strains varied from 76.0% to 77.3%. Contrary to expectations, assessments of clinical signs, viral load, and histopathology indicated a significant level of cross-protection among these antigenically distant IBV strains. Moreover, prime and booster vaccination with Mass protected against GA13 and improved protection against Ark when compared with Mass single vaccination. These results emphasize the need to include both single vaccination control groups and control groups primed and boosted with a single serotype when testing the efficacy of IBV protectotypes and/or novel IBV vaccine combinations against heterologous serotypes under controlled experimental conditions. Such controls are of distinct importance in experiments supporting the introduction of attenuated IBV vaccine strains exotic to regions, since these exotic strains may provide new genetic material for recombination and emergence of novel IBV strains.","Toro, H; van Santen, V L; Ghetas, A M; Joiner, K S",Avian diseases,https://doi.org/10.1637/11231-070615-reg.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26629628/,33

Changes in serotonergic tone have been reported to shift oscillations between the combined delta-theta (2.5-8 Hz) and the alpha (8-12 Hz) frequency ranges. Such frequency shifts may constitute a useful biomarker for the effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) medications in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). We utilized quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) to measure shifts in prefrontal rhythmic oscillations early in treatment with either the SSRI escitalopram or placebo, and examined the relationship between these changes and remission of depressive symptoms. Prefrontal delta-theta and alpha power were calculated for 194 subjects with moderate MDD prior to and one week after start of treatment. Changes at one week in delta-theta and alpha power, as well as the delta-theta/alpha ratio, were examined in three cohorts: initial (N = 70) and replication (N = 76) cohorts treated with escitalopram, and a cohort treated with placebo (N = 48). Mean delta-theta power significantly increased and alpha power decreased after one week of escitalopram treatment, but did not significantly change with placebo treatment. The delta-theta/alpha ratio change was a specific predictor of the likelihood of remission after seven weeks of medication treatment: a large increase in this ratio was associated with non-remission in escitalopram-treated subjects, but not placebo-treated subjects. Escitalopram and placebo treatment have differential effects on delta-theta and alpha frequency oscillations. Early increase in delta-theta/alpha may constitute a replicable biomarker for non-remission during SSRI treatment of MDD.","Leuchter, Andrew F; Hunter, Aimee M; Jain, Felipe A; Tartter, Molly; Crump, Caroline; Cook, Ian A",Journal of psychiatric research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2016.10.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27770740/,33

On average this represented 125 cases diagnosed each day over the reporting period, a decrease from 322 cases per day over the previous reporting period. 94% (1,640) of all cases were reported in Victoria, with a smaller number of cases reported from New South Wales (86), Queensland (19), Western Australia (5) and South Australia (1). In Victoria, the majority of cases (1,528; 93%) were locally acquired, with a further 112 (7%) under investigation at the time of analysis, but likely also to be locally acquired. Of the remaining 111 cases reported, 22 (20%) were overseas acquired; 82 (74%) were locally acquired, predominantly in NSW, and 7 (6%) were reported as under investigation. The continued decrease in new cases observed this fortnight in Victoria is likely associated with the enhanced public health measures that are currently in place in Victoria. Locally acquired cases which were predominantly associated with several interconnected clusters continued to be reported in NSW.

The primary objective of this study was to characterize signs and symptoms of RVI among inpatients in a major tertiary care hospital. METHODS Between 2013 and 2015, adult inpatients with RVI undergoing RVP-PCR were prospectively enrolled in our study. Clinical data were collected by interviews and electronic medical record reviews. Data analysis was performed using χ(2) testing, analysis of variance for continuous variables, and logistic regression modeling. RESULTS Of 421 patients analyzed, 175 (41.7%) had a positive RVP-PCR. Patients were evenly matched at baseline except for renal disease. Multivariate logistic regression modeling demonstrated the following positive correlations: positive RVP-PCR with renal disease (odds ratio [OR] 2.08), cough (OR 2.28), and wheezing (OR 1.8); influenza with cough (OR 5.04), and renal disease (OR 2.17); metapneumovirus with age older than 65 (OR 3.24); respiratory syncytial viruses with wheezing (OR 3.42) and immunosuppression (OR 3.11); and parainfluenza with smoking (OR 3.16). Negative correlations included influenza with anosmia (OR 0.41); rhinovirus/enterovirus with feeling confined to bed (OR 0.3); metapneumovirus with smoking (OR 0.29); and parainfluenza with male sex (OR 0.22). CONCLUSIONS In this descriptive study, we noted specific viral associations with clinical signs and symptoms among 421 inpatients with RVIs. With increasing RVP-PCR use, studies similar to ours may be able to better define the clinical presentation of RVIs and lead to evidence-based, clinical presentation-guided diagnostic and management algorithms.","Malhotra, Prashant; Luka, Arthur; McWilliams, Carla S; Poeth, Kaitlin G; Schwartz, Rebecca; Elfekey, Mohammed; Balwan, Sandy",Southern medical journal,https://doi.org/10.14423/smj.0000000000000503; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27490659/,33

Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) is considered a mainstream procedure for treating both wound types. Soft tissue deformation stimuli are the crux of NPWT, enhancing cell proliferation and migration from peri-wound tissues which contributes to healing. We developed a dynamic stretching device (DSD) contained in a miniature incubator for applying controlled deformations to fibroblast wound assays. Prior to the stretching experiments, fibroblasts were seeded in 6-well culture plates with elastic substrata and let to reach confluency. Squashing damage was then induced at the culture centers, and the DSD was activated to deliver stretching regimes that represented common clinical NPWT protocols at two peak strain levels, 0.5% and 3%. Analyses of the normalized maximal migration rate (MMR) data for the collective cell movement revealed that for the 3% strain level, the normalized MMR of cultures subjected to a 0.1 Hz stretch frequency regime was ~ 1.4 times and statistically significantly greater (p < 0.05) than that of the cultures subjected to no-stretch (control) or to static stretch (2nd control). Correspondingly, analysis of the time to gap closure data indicated that the closure time of the wound assays subjected to the 0.1 Hz regime was ~ 30% shorter than that of the cultures subjected to the control regimes (p < 0.05). Other simulated NPWT protocols did not emerge as superior to the controls. The present method and system are a powerful platform for further revealing the mechanobiology of NPWT and for improving this technology.","Katzengold, Rona; Orlov, Alexey; Gefen, Amit",Biomechanics and modeling in mechanobiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10237-020-01377-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32803464/,33

To improve the efficiency of structure-based VS approaches, the selection and optimization of various parameters can be guided by benchmarking. With the DEKOIS 2.0 library, we aim to further extend and complement the collection of publicly available decoy sets. Based on BindingDB bioactivity data, we provide 81 new and structurally diverse benchmark sets for a wide variety of different target classes. To ensure a meaningful selection of ligands, we address several issues that can be found in bioactivity data. We have improved our previously introduced DEKOIS methodology with enhanced physicochemical matching, now including the consideration of molecular charges, as well as a more sophisticated elimination of latent actives in the decoy set (LADS). We evaluate the docking performance of Glide, GOLD, and AutoDock Vina with our data sets and highlight existing challenges for VS tools.

Paraspeckles are involved in many physiological processes including cellular stress responses, cell differentiation, corpus luteum formation and cancer progression. Recently, ultra-resolution microscopy coupled with multicolor-labeling of paraspeckle components (the NEAT1 RNA and paraspeckle proteins) revealed the exquisite details of paraspeckle structure and function. NEAT1 transcripts are radially arranged to form a core-shell spheroidal structure, while paraspeckle proteins (PSPs) localize within different layers. Functional dissection of NEAT1 shows that the subdomains of NEAT1_2 are important for RNA stability, isoform switching and paraspeckle assembly via a liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) mechanism. We review recent progress on structure and organization of paraspeckles as well as how paraspeckles spatiotemporally control gene regulation through sequestration of diverse proteins and RNAs in cells.","Wang, Yang; Chen, Ling-Ling",Essays in biochemistry,https://doi.org/10.1042/ebc20200010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32830222/,33

One Health calls upon the human, animal and environmental health sectors to cross professional, disciplinary and institutional boundaries, and to work in a more integrated fashion. At the global level, this paper argues that this vision is hindered by dysfunctions characterising current forms of global health governance (GHG), namely institutional proliferation, fragmentation, competition for scarce resources, lack of an overarching authority, and donor-driven vertical programmes. This has contributed, in part, to shortcomings in how One Health has been articulated to date. An agreed operational definition of One Health among key global institutions, efforts to build One Health institutions from the ground up, comparative case studies of what works or does not work institutionally, and high-level global support for research, training and career opportunities would all help to enable One Health to help remedy, and not be subsumed by, existing dysfunctions in GHG.","Lee, Kelley; Brumme, Zabrina L",Health policy and planning,https://doi.org/10.1093/heapol/czs127; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23221123/,33

We hypothesized that patients receiving LAI could be discharged faster than SPIN and TIVA patients. DESIGN Randomized, prospective trial. SETTING University hospital day-surgery center. PATIENTS 156 adult male patients (ASA 1-3) undergoing day-case open inguinal herniorrhaphy. INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomized to either LAI (lidocaine+ropivacaine), SPIN (bupivacaine+fentanyl) or TIVA (propofol+remifentanil). Perioperative Ringer infusion was 1.5mL/h. Urinary bladder was scanned before and after surgery. Interviews were performed on postoperative days 1, 7 and 90. MEASUREMENTS Duration of surgery, duration of the patients' stay in the operating room and time until their readiness for discharge home. Patient satisfaction and adverse effects were registered. MAIN RESULTS Surgery lasted longer in LAI group (median 40min) than in SPIN group (35min) (P=.003) and TIVA group (33min) (P<.001). Although surgery was shortest in TIVA group, TIVA patients stayed longer in the operating room than LAI patients (P=.001). Time until readiness for discharge was shorter in LAI group (93min) than in TIVA (147min) and SPIN (190min) groups (P<.001). Supplementary lidocaine infiltration was given to 32 LAI patients, and IV fentanyl to 29 LAI and 4 SPIN patients. Ephedrine was required in 34 TIVA, 5 LAI and 5 SPIN patients. One SPIN and three LAI patients had to be given TIVA and another SPIN patient LAI to complete the operations. Urinary retention was absent. Discomfort in the scar (26%) three months postoperatively was not anesthesia-related. CONCLUSIONS Logistically, LAI was superior because of the fastest recovery postoperatively. The anesthetic techniques were adequate for surgery in all but a few LAI and SPIN patients. Lack of urinary retention was probably related to the small IV infusion volumes.","Pere, Pertti; Harju, Jukka; Kairaluoma, Pekka; Remes, Veikko; Turunen, Päivi; Rosenberg, Per H",Journal of clinical anesthesia,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclinane.2016.03.062; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27687366/,33

118049,Testing the hypothesis of tissue selectivity: the intersection-union test and a Bayesian approach.,2009,"Introduction: Acquired nasolacrimal duct obstruction (NLDO) is a major cause of epiphora. Balloon dacryoplasty (BD) is a minimally invasive procedure effectively used for congenital NLDO which has also been used in adults, instead of dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR), the current gold standard technique. The main objectives were to assess the results of BD with and without silicone tube insertion (STI) in NLDO in adults. Materiel and Method: A systematic review of literature was conducted on PubMed, SCOPUS and Cochrane databases. The articles were scanned to identify all studies that evaluated the outcomes of primary BD for NLDO in adults. The mean success rates were calculated and compared using the multiple comparisons Sidak's T-test Results: Sixty-seven articles were identified but only 13 publications matched the inclusion criteria. For partial NLDO, BD had a mean, success rate of 73.29% (64.86% with STI) with a mean follow-up of 16 months. For complete NLDO, BD had a success rate of 36.67% (52.50% with STI) with a mean follow-up of 15.5 months. Altogether the success rate of BD was significantly higher for partial NLDO compared to complete stenosis (p = 0,002). Conclusion: BD is significantly more successful for partial NLDO, without significant additional benefit from subsequent STI. The main complication would be the high recurrence rate. BD is not effective for complete NLDO with very low success rates. However, BD could be proposed for partial NLDO, as it is a safe procedure, with minimal invasiveness in comparison to DCR. Further prospective and controlled studies are required to confirm these encouraging results.","Poignet, Barthélémy; Sultanik, Philippe; Beaujeux, Pauline; Koch, Edouard; Benkhatar, Hakim",Orbit,https://doi.org/10.1080/01676830.2020.1818264; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32912011/,33
118212,The ABCs of skin care for wound care clinicians: dermatitis and eczema.,2009,"This study examined whether song lyrics and their semantic meaning interfere with speech intelligibility. In three experiments, a total of 108 native Dutch participants listened to Dutch target sentences in the presence of three versions of the pop songs Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.) (Experiment 1) or Hot N Cold (Experiment 2a and 2b) by singer Katy Perry at different signal-to-noise ratios. The versions consisted of the original English songs, the karaoke versions of the songs without lyrics, and anomalous versions of the songs in the fictional language Simlish, which was created for the video game The Sims. The songs were played in chronological (Experiments 1 and 2a) or in random order (Experiment 2b). Participants' task was to type the target sentence they had heard. In all experiments, speech intelligibility was better in nonlyrical (karaoke) than lyrical music (English and Simlish). In addition, listeners performed better in lyrics without semantic meaning (Simlish) than with semantic meaning (English). Finally, speech intelligibility was better when the song in the background was played in chronological rather than in random order. These findings aid in understanding the mechanisms involved during speech-in-music intelligibility.

Methods In the Sham group, the right sciatic nerve was exposed without clamping. The SNI model was established using the sciatic nerve clamp method on the right leg and then randomly divided into the SNI group and the Tuina group. Seven days after modeling, the Tuina group was treated daily with a ""massage and tuina manipulation simulator"" (Patent No. ZL 2007 0187403.1), which was used daily to stimulate Yinmen (BL37), Yanglingquan (GB34), and Chengshan (BL57) with point-pressing method, plucking method, and kneading method. The stimulating force was 4N, and the stimulating frequency was 60 times per minute; each method and each point were used for 1 minute, totaling 9 minutes (1 min/acupoint/method × 3 methods × 3 acupoints). Treatment was administered for 21 days, followed by a 1-day rest after the 10th treatment, for a total of 20 times of intervention. The sciatic function index (SFI) was used to evaluate the fine movements of the hind limbs of rats in each group. The ultrastructural changes at the point of nerve injury were observed by transmission electron microscopy, and the gene changes at the point of nerve injury were detected using RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) technology. Results Compared with the baseline, the SFI of the SNI group and the Tuina group decreased significantly at the 0th intervention (7 days after molding); compared with the SNI group, the SFI of the Tuina group increased at the 10th intervention (P < 0.05) and increased significantly at the 15th and 20th intervention (P < 0.01). Compared with the Sham group, the myelin sheath integrity of the sciatic nerve in the SNI group was destroyed and the myelin sheath collapsed seriously, even forming myelin sheath ball, accompanied with severe axonal atrophy and mitochondrial degeneration. The tuina intervention could significantly improve the ultrastructure of the nerve injury point, and the nerve fiber myelin sheath in the Tuina group remained intact, without obvious axonal swelling or atrophy. Atrophic thread granules could be seen in the axon, but there were no vacuolated mitochondria. RNA-seq results showed that there were differences at 221 genes at the point of nerve injury between the Tuina group and the SNI group and the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) are enriched in the biological processes related to the regulation of myocyte. Regulations include the regulation of striated muscle cell differentiation, myoblast differentiation, and myotube differentiation. Conclusion Tuina can improve the fine motor recovery and protect the myelin integrity in rats with peripheral nerve injury, and this is achieved by changing the gene sequence at the injured point.","Lv, Taotao; Mo, Yanjun; Yu, Tianyuan; Zhang, Yumo; Shao, Shuai; Luo, Yuting; Shen, Yi; Lu, Mengqian; Wong, Steven Gregory",Evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine : eCAM,https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/5859298; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32724326/,33
118316,A simplified measurement of pulse wave velocity is not inferior to standard measurement in young adults and children.,2016,"Ischemic heart disease (IHD) is a complex disorder and a leading cause of death and morbidity in both men and women. Sex however affects several aspects of IHD, including pathophysiology, incidence, clinical presentation, diagnosis as well as treatment and outcome. Several diseases or risk factors frequently associated with IHD can modify cellular signalling cascades, thus affecting ischemia/reperfusion injury as well as responses to cardioprotective interventions. Importantly, the prevalence and impact of risk factors and several comorbidities differ between males and females, and their effects on IHD development and prognosis might differ according to sex. The cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying these differences are still poorly understood, and their identification might have important translational implications in the prediction or prevention of risk of IHD in men and women. Despite this, most experimental studies on IHD are still undertaken in animal models in the absence of risk factors and comorbidities, and assessment of potential sex-specific differences are largely missing. This ESC WG Position Paper will discuss: a) the importance of sex as a biological variable in cardiovascular research, b) major biological mechanisms underlying sex-related differences relevant to IHD risk factors and comorbidities, c) prospects and pitfalls of preclinical models to investigate these associations, and finally d) will provide recommendations to guide future research.

We systematically examined the pain outcomes of patients with PDN receiving any type of invasive neuromodulation for treatment of neuropathic pain. MATERIALS AND METHODS MEDLINE and Embase were searched through 10 January 2020, without language restriction. All study types were included. Two reviewers independently screened publications and extracted data. Quantitative meta-analysis was performed with pain scores converted to a standard 100-point scale. Randomized controlled trial (RCT) scores were pooled using the inverse variance method and expressed as mean differences. RESULTS RCTs of tonic spinal cord stimulation (t-SCS) showed greater pain improvement than best medical therapy at six months (intention-to-treat: 38/100, 95% CI: 29-47). By per-protocol analysis, case series of t-SCS and dorsal root ganglion stimulation (DRGS) showed improvement by 56 (95% CI: 39-73) and 55 (22-87), respectively, at 12 months. For t-SCS, the rate of failing a therapeutic stimulation trial was 16%, the risk of infection was 4%, and the rate of lead problems requiring surgery to resolve was 4% per year of follow-up. High-frequency SCS and burst SCS both showed efficacy, with few patients studied. CONCLUSION Efficacious, lasting and safe surgical pain management options are available to diabetic patients suffering from PDN. Tonic-SCS is the established standard of treatment; however, other SCS paradigms and DRGS are emerging as promising treatments offering comparable pain benefits, but with few cases published to date. Randomized controlled trials are ongoing to assess their relative merits.","Raghu, Ashley L B; Parker, Tariq; Aziz, Tipu Z; Green, Alexander L; Hadjipavlou, George; Rea, Rustam; FitzGerald, James J",Neuromodulation : journal of the International Neuromodulation Society,https://doi.org/10.1111/ner.13216; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32588933/,33

This study investigated the impact and prognostic value of infection on long-term mortality in octogenarian patients with STEMI. METHODS A total of 1564 patients admitted with STEMI between May 2015 and September 2019 were retrospectively analyzed, and 110 octogenarians were identified and included. Predictors of mortality were determined by multivariate Cox regression analysis. Survival curves were generated using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS The mean age of the patients was 85 ± 4 years, and 58 (52%) were male. Median follow-up was 41 months. Patients with infection had higher rates of in-hospital (16.4% vs. 8.2%, p = 0.001) and long-term (33.6% vs. 20%, p = 0.001) mortality. Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that infection (HR 3.16; 95% CI 1.52-6.59; p = 0.002) and C-reactive protein levels (HR 0.99; 95% CI 0.98-1.00; p = 0.042) were independent predictors of mortality in patients with infection. Kaplan-Meier analysis also showed that patients with infection had a significantly higher mortality rate (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION Infection is an independent predictor of long-term mortality in octogenarian patients with STEMI.","Gürdal, Ahmet; Keskin, Kudret; Sümerkan, Mutlu Çağan; Çetinkal, Gökhan; Kilci, Hakan; Çetin, Şükrü; Kılıçkesmez, Kadriye Orta",European geriatric medicine,https://doi.org/10.1007/s41999-020-00368-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32691387/,33
118906,Use of endoscopic transorbital and endonasal approaches for 360° circumferential access to orbital tumors.,2020-09-25,"UNLABELLED We discovered a novel somatic gene fusion, CD74-NRG1, by transcriptome sequencing of 25 lung adenocarcinomas of never smokers. By screening 102 lung adenocarcinomas negative for known oncogenic alterations, we found four additional fusion-positive tumors, all of which were of the invasive mucinous subtype. Mechanistically, CD74-NRG1 leads to extracellular expression of the EGF-like domain of NRG1 III-β3, thereby providing the ligand for ERBB2-ERBB3 receptor complexes. Accordingly, ERBB2 and ERBB3 expression was high in the index case, and expression of phospho-ERBB3 was specifically found in tumors bearing the fusion (P < 0.0001). Ectopic expression of CD74-NRG1 in lung cancer cell lines expressing ERBB2 and ERBB3 activated ERBB3 and the PI3K-AKT pathway, and led to increased colony formation in soft agar. Thus, CD74-NRG1 gene fusions are activating genomic alterations in invasive mucinous adenocarcinomas and may offer a therapeutic opportunity for a lung tumor subtype with, so far, no effective treatment. SIGNIFICANCE CD74–NRG1 fusions may represent a therapeutic opportunity for invasive mucinous lung adenocarcinomas, a tumor with no effective treatment that frequently presents with multifocal unresectable disease.","Fernandez-Cuesta, Lynnette; Plenker, Dennis; Osada, Hirotaka; Sun, Ruping; Menon, Roopika; Leenders, Frauke; Ortiz-Cuaran, Sandra; Peifer, Martin; Bos, Marc; Daßler, Juliane; Malchers, Florian; Schöttle, Jakob; Vogel, Wenzel; Dahmen, Ilona; Koker, Mirjam; Ullrich, Roland T; Wright, Gavin M; Russell, Prudence A; Wainer, Zoe; Solomon, Benjamin; Brambilla, Elisabeth; Nagy-Mignotte, Hélène; Moro-Sibilot, Denis; Brambilla, Christian G; Lantuejoul, Sylvie; Altmüller, Janine; Becker, Christian; Nürnberg, Peter; Heuckmann, Johannes M; Stoelben, Erich; Petersen, Iver; Clement, Joachim H; Sänger, Jörg; Muscarella, Lucia A; la Torre, Annamaria; Fazio, Vito M; Lahortiga, Idoya; Perera, Timothy; Ogata, Souichi; Parade, Marc; Brehmer, Dirk; Vingron, Martin; Heukamp, Lukas C; Buettner, Reinhard; Zander, Thomas; Wolf, Jürgen; Perner, Sven; Ansén, Sascha; Haas, Stefan A; Yatabe, Yasushi; Thomas, Roman K",Cancer discovery,https://doi.org/10.1158/2159-8290.cd-13-0633; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24469108/,33
119076,Disentangling indirect effects through multiple mediators without assuming any causal structure among the mediators.,2021-07-29,"INTRODUCTION Tonsillar microenvironment is thought to contribute to innate immune dysregulation responsible for the periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and cervical adenitis (PFAPA) because of beneficial effects of tonsillectomy on treatment of the syndrome. Accordingly previous studies reported altered lymphocyte frequency, cytokine level and microbial composition in PFAPA tonsils. The aim of our study is to monitor expression levels of pro-inflammatory cell surface Toll-like receptors (TLRs) which have important role in induction of inflammation and maintaining tissue haemostasis. MATERIALS AND METHODS Seven patients with PFAPA syndrome, and eight patients with group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal (GAβHS) recurrent tonsillitis were included in our study. Tonsillar expression levels of TLR-1, -2, -4, -5, and -6 were monitored by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Expression levels were scored using semi-quantitative analysis method and were statistically analyzed by Two-Way Repeated Measures Analysis of Variance test. RESULTS IHC analysis demonstrated expression of all TLRs in tonsillar surface epithelium (SE) and lymphoid interior (LI) except for TLR-6 which was not present in the former. There has not been any statistically significant difference in TLR expression levels between PFAPA and GAβHS tonsils, except for TLR-1 and TLR-2 which were higher on LI and lower on SE of PFAPA tonsils, respectively, than that of the GAβHS samples. CONCLUSIONS Altered TLR expression levels may be involved in PFAPA pathogenesis. Future studies with higher patient number, uninflamed tonsils and cellular markers are required to further enlighten the role of TLRs in the development of syndrome.","Gazi, Umut; Ozkayalar, Hanife; Mujahed, Monjed I M; Tosun, Ozgur; Dalkan, Ceyhun; Sanlidag, Burcin; Asım Safak, Mustafa; Mocan, Gamze; Onder Bahceciler, Nerin",International journal of pediatric otorhinolaryngology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijporl.2021.110674; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33725589/,33

Currently there is no vaccine, effective therapeutic or prophylactic. Like other betacoronaviruses, attachment and entry of SARS-CoV-2 is mediated by the spike glycoprotein (SGP). In addition to its well-documented interaction with its receptor, human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), SGP has been found to bind to glycosaminoglycans like heparan sulfate, which is found on the surface of virtually all mammalian cells. Here, we pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 SGP on a third generation lentiviral (pLV) vector and tested the impact of various sulfated polysaccharides on transduction efficiency in mammalian cells. The pLV vector pseudotyped SGP efficiently and produced high titers on HEK293T cells. Various sulfated polysaccharides potently neutralized pLV-S pseudotyped virus with clear structure-based differences in anti-viral activity and affinity to SGP. Concentration-response curves showed that pLV-S particles were efficiently neutralized by a range of concentrations of unfractionated heparin (UFH), enoxaparin, 6-O-desulfated UFH and 6-O-desulfated enoxaparin with an IC50 of 5.99 μg/L, 1.08 mg/L, 1.77 μg/L, and 5.86 mg/L respectively. In summary, several sulfated polysaccharides show potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity and can be developed for prophylactic as well as therapeutic purposes.Importance The recent emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, China in late 2019 and its subsequent spread to the rest of the world has created a pandemic situation unprecedented in modern history. While ACE2 has been identified as the viral receptor, cellular polysaccharides have also been implicated in virus entry. The SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (SGP) binds to glycosaminoglycans like heparan sulfate, which is found on the surface of virtually all mammalian cells. Here, we report structure-based differences in anti-viral activity and affinity to SGP for several sulfated polysaccharides, including both well-characterized FDA-approved drugs and novel marine sulfated polysaccharides, which can be developed for prophylactic as well as therapeutic purposes.","Tandon, Ritesh; Sharp, Joshua S; Zhang, Fuming; Pomin, Vitor H; Ashpole, Nicole M; Mitra, Dipanwita; McCandless, Martin G; Jin, Weihua; Liu, Hao; Sharma, Poonam; Linhardt, Robert J",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01987-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33173010/,33

Technical note.",2010,"Widespread testing for the respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) will represent an important part of any strategy designed to safely reopen societies from lockdown. Healthcare settings have the potential to become reservoirs of infectivity, and therefore many hospital trusts are beginning to carry out routine screening of staff and patients. This could promote the effective cohorting of patients and reduce the rate of nosocomial infection. However, for various reasons, some individuals may refuse this testing. Here we highlight this as an emergent ethicolegal issue which we expect to become increasingly relevant as testing becomes ubiquitous. We explore this position from an ethical and legal perspective, determining whether refusal of testing is acceptable under UK law. Individual patients refusing testing could undermine a hospital's testing strategy; therefore clinicians and policy makers must prospectively determine the best course of action if this were to occur.","McDermott, John H; Newman, William G",Clinical medicine,https://doi.org/10.7861/clinmed.2020-0388; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32620593/,33
120714,Error in Funding/Support.,2014,"BACKGROUND Irrational use of antibiotics is prevalent worldwide. But our understanding on consumer behaviors in the use of antibiotics is very limited. This study aims to identify consumer behavior patterns in the use of antibiotics for upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs). METHODS The study will employ a mixed methods approach based on the ""Capacity & Opportunity & Motivation - Behavior"" (COM-B) framework. The COM-B attributes of consumers in relation to the use of antibiotics will be extracted from a systematic literature review. Semi-structured in-depth interviews will be conducted on 20-25 community residents with URTI symptoms over the past three months to illustrate the meaning and implications of the thematic categories of COM-B attributes for the purpose of measurement development. The measurement instruments will be modified and validated through Delphi consultations with 15 experts and a survey of 300 adult residents in Wuhan. A cross-sectional survey using the finalised measurement instruments will be conducted on 2700 adult residents randomly selected from 18 residential communities across 9 municipalities in 3 provinces in China. Multi-level latent class analyses will be performed to categeorise the respondents based on the indicators measuring the behavioral features (need recognition, information searching, alternative assessment, purchase, use, and post-use evaluation) of consumers in purchasing, consuming and disposing antibiotics for URTIs. Multi-nominal regression analyses will be performed to determine the predictors of different behavior patterns. DISCUSSION This study aims to classify consumers into distinguished categories of behavior patterns toward the use of antibiotics for URTIs. Such a classification system categories the consumers with similar behavior features into the same group so that better targeted interventions can be developed. The COM-B model adopted in this study can also help us better understand the underlying mechanisms of different behavior patterns of consumers.","Duan, Zhonghong; Liu, Chaojie; Han, Meng; Wang, Dan; Zhang, Xinping; Liu, Chenxi",Research in social & administrative pharmacy : RSAP,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sapharm.2020.07.033; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32830072/,33

120838,Ophthalmology Letterbox.,2021-03-09,"INTRODUCTION The Bronx is a borough of New York City that has been profoundly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Limited reports exist discussing the anaesthetic management of obstetric patients infected with COVID-19. We review a cohort of obstetric patients in the Bronx with COVID-19 and report their delivery data, anaesthetic management, and maternal-fetal outcomes. MATERIAL AND METHODS We reviewed 92 pregnant patients with laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) who delivered between 1 February 2020 and 1 May 2020. Medical records were reviewed for patient characteristics, anaesthetic management, and clinical outcomes. Patients were stratified by mode of delivery and COVID-19 disease severity. RESULTS Of the 92 deliveries, 49 (53%) were vaginal, 14 (15%) were scheduled caesareans, and 29 (32%) were unscheduled caesareans. 64 patients (70%) were asymptomatic for COVID-19 (mild disease: 18 patients [19%], moderate disease: 7 patients [8%], severe disease: 2 patients [2%], critical disease: 1 patient [1%]). 83 patients (90%) received neuraxial analgesia and/or anaesthesia, with combined spinal-epidural (CSE) and dural puncture epidural (DPE) as the most common techniques. 5 patients (5%) required general anaesthesia (GA) for caesarean delivery, 3 (3%) of whom were intubated for severe or critical COVID-19 disease. CONCLUSIONS Given the risks associated with SARS-CoV-2 aerosol transmission, GA was avoided in all but the most critically ill patients. CSE and DPE were optimal for minimizing catheter failure rates and risk of conversion to GA. SARS-CoV-2 infection in obstetric patients may be associated with an increased risk for adverse outcomes including preeclampsia, preterm delivery, unscheduled caesarean delivery, and mechanical ventilation.","Chen, Steven; Bernstein, Peter; Nair, Singh; Romanelli, Erik; Khoury, Rasha; Labins, Jacqueline; Fiorica, Giuseppe; Reddy, Shamantha",Anaesthesiology intensive therapy,https://doi.org/10.5114/ait.2021.105120; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34006045/,33
121264,Fine needle diathermy occlusion of corneal vessels.,2014,"BACKGROUND Metformin, a widely used hypoglycemic drug, reduces stroke incidence and alleviates chronic inflammation in clinical trials. However, the effect of metformin in ischemic stroke is unclear. Here, we investigated the effect of metformin on ischemic stroke in mice and further explored the possible underlying mechanisms. METHODS Ninety-eight adult male CD-1 mice underwent 90-minute transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO). Metformin (200 mg/kg) was administrated for up to 14 days. Neurobehavioral outcomes, brain infarct volume, inflammatory factors, blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability and AMPK signaling pathways were evaluated following tMCAO. Oxygen glucose deprivation was performed on bEND.3 cells to explore the mechanisms of metformin in inhibiting inflammatory signaling pathways. RESULTS Infarct volume was reduced in metformin-treated mice compared to the control group following tMCAO (P < 0.05). Neurobehavioral outcomes were greatly improved in metformin-treated mice (P < 0.05). MPO+ cells, Gr1+ cells, MPO activity and BBB permeability were decreased after metformin administration (P < 0.05). In addition, metformin activated AMPK phosphorylation, inhibited NF-κB activation, down-regulated cytokine (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α) and ICAM-1 expression following tMCAO (P < 0.05). Furthermore, metformin activated AMPK signaling pathway and alleviated oxygen-glucose deprivation-induced ICAM-1 expression in bEND.3 cells (P < 0.05). Compound C, a selective AMPK inhibitor, eliminated this promotional effect. CONCLUSIONS Metformin down-regulated ICAM-1 in an AMPK-dependent manner, which could effectively prevent ischemia-induced brain injury by alleviating neutrophil infiltration, suggesting that metformin is a promising therapeutic agent in stroke therapy.","Liu, Yanqun; Tang, Guanghui; Li, Yaning; Wang, Yang; Chen, Xiaoyan; Gu, Xiang; Zhang, Zhijun; Wang, Yongting; Yang, Guo-Yuan",Journal of neuroinflammation,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12974-014-0177-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25315906/,33
121336,Reply to Chaturvedi.,2020-11-01,"BACKGROUND Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with hypertension and the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Renal sympathetic innervation contributes to either condition. METHODS We investigated the effect of renal sympathetic denervation (RDN) on blood pressure (BP), renal perfusion, and neurohumoral responses during and after repetitive obstructive apneas in a pig model for OSA. BP, femoral artery, and renal artery flow were measured in 29 spontaneously breathing urethane-chloralose-anesthetized pigs. The effect of RDN (n = 14) and irbesartan (n = 3) was investigated. Repetitive tracheal occlusions for 2 minutes with applied negative tracheal pressure at -80 mbar were performed over 4 hours. RESULTS Spontaneous breathing attempts during tracheal occlusion caused an intra-apneic breathing synchronous oscillating pattern of renal flow. Renal flow oscillations were > 2-fold higher compared with femoral flow that almost showed changes proportional to the BP alterations (2.9%/mm Hg vs. 1.3%/mm Hg; P < 0.0001). A marked postapneic BP rise from 102 ± 3 to 172 ± 8 mm Hg (P < 0.00001) was associated with renal hypoperfusion (from 190 ± 24 to 70 ± 20 ml/min; P < 0.00001) occurring after application of obstructive respiratory events. RDN, but not irbesartan, inhibited postapneic BP rises and renal hypoperfusion and attenuated increased plasma renin activity and aldosterone concentration induced by repetitive tracheal occlusions. Additionally, increased urinary protein/creatinine ratio was significantly reduced by RDN, whereas intra-apneic hemodynamic changes or blood gases were not modified by RDN. CONCLUSIONS Repetitive obstructive respiratory events result in postapneic BP rises and renal hypoperfusion, as well as neurohumoral responses and increased protein/creatinine ratio. These changes are mainly sympathetically driven because they could be attenuated by RDN.","Linz, Dominik; Mahfoud, Felix; Linz, Benedikt; Hohl, Mathias; Schirmer, Stephan H; Wirth, Klaus J; Böhm, Michael",American journal of hypertension,https://doi.org/10.1093/ajh/hpu036; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24622919/,33

The histopathology study confirmed eosinophilic appendicitis and that a parasitic infection was suspected. The stool sample was positive for Strongyloides stercoralis The diagnosis of a S stercoralis is a rare finding in Spain. S. stercoralis simulates clinical findings of inflammatory bowel disease or eosinophilic gastroenteritis, which may lead to the wrong therapeutic choice. Since in inflammatory diseases corticosteroid treatments are considered the initial choice in many cases, in the case of S. stercoralis infection, the administration of this therapy can be fatal. In Spain, the number of diagnoses is much lower than in the past decade, although it is highly probable that the infection has been underdiagnosed due to low clinical awareness among Spanish population.","Páramo-Zunzunegui, Javier; Rubio-López, Laura; Benito-Barbero, Silvia; Muñoz-Fernández, Ángeles",BMJ case reports,https://doi.org/10.1136/bcr-2020-239685; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34078621/,33

However, the dominant environmental drivers or factors influencing N2 fixation and the functional significance of the diazotroph community structure in paddy soil across a climatic gradient are not yet well understood. Thus, we characterized the diazotroph community and identified the ecological predictors of N2 fixation potential in four different climate zones (mid-temperate, warm-temperate, subtropical, and tropical paddy soils) in eastern China. Comprehensive nifH gene sequencing, functional activity detection, and correlation analysis with environmental factors were estimated. The potential nitrogenase activity (PNA) was highest in warm-temperate regions, where it was 6.2-, 2.9-, and 2.2-fold greater than in the tropical, subtropical, and mid-temperate regions, respectively; nifH gene abundance was significantly higher in warm-temperate and subtropical zones than in the tropical or mid-temperate zones. Diazotroph diversity was significantly higher in the tropical climate zone and significantly lower in the mid-temperate zone. Non-metric multidimensional scaling and canonical correlation analysis indicated that paddy soil diazotroph populations differed significantly among the four climate zones, mainly owing to differences in climate and soil pH. Structural equation models and automatic linear models revealed that climate and nutrients indirectly affected PNA by affecting soil pH and diazotroph community, respectively, while diazotroph community, C/P, and nifH gene abundance directly affected PNA. And C/P ratio, pH, and the diazotroph community structure were the main predictors of PNA in paddy soils. Collectively, the differences in diazotroph community structure have ecological significance, with important implications for the prediction of soil N2-fixing functions under climate change scenarios.","Wu, Chuanfa; Wei, Xiaomeng; Hu, Ziye; Liu, Yi; Hu, Yajun; Qin, Hongling; Chen, Xiangbi; Wu, Jinshui; Ge, Tida; Zhran, Mostafa; Su, Yirong",Microbial ecology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00248-020-01591-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32901387/,33

Alongside mechanical tooth cleaning, the adjunctive use of mouthrinses has been widely advocated. Although research on the efficacy of various mouthrinse formulations is very active, there are a lack of conclusive data regarding their adverse effects. Methods We undertook a systematic review in accordance wih PRISMA guidelines of electronic databases of clinical trials of any duration with daily home use of mouthwashes, presenting clinical and subjective side effects (PROSPERO registration: CRD42016054037). Results After evaluating 614 titles and abstracts, 154 studies were selected for full-text analysis; 85 final papers were included. Based on the active ingredient in the test product, nine categories were created: cetyl pyridinium chloride, essential oils, chlorhexidine, triclosan, natural products, diclofenac, fluorides, delmopinol, and miscellaneous active substances. Most of the studies were of short duration (less than 6 months) with a defective 'methods' description; the reporting of adverse events often being overlooked. Both local morphological (oral mucosa and dental-crown staining, mucosal lesions) and functional (taste modifications, abnormal oral sensation) alterations were reported. Tooth staining was the most commonly listed adverse event, but it was quantitatively assessed only in a very small number of papers; most studies relied on patient reports. Staining was time associated; the longer the study, the higher its reported incidence and severity. Conclusions The reduced report of side effects may partly be due to a lack of an objective measure and lack of general guidelines that demand studies report their adverse events. The most frequently reported adverse effect was teeth staining. As in most studies, the effect was associated with trial duration; clinical trials should be of sufficient duration. New investigations meeting the suggested criteria of a minimal duration of 6 months should be planned.","Tartaglia, Gianluca M; Tadakamadla, Santosh Kumar; Connelly, Stephen Thaddeus; Sforza, Chiarella; Martín, Conchita",Therapeutic advances in drug safety,https://doi.org/10.1177/2042098619854881; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31579502/,33
122071,Comment on: Right hepatic venous system variation in living donors: a three-dimensional CT analysis.,2020-09-13,"Generating appropriate motor commands is an essential brain function. To achieve proper motor control in diverse situations, predicting future states of the environment and body and modifying the prediction are indispensable. The internal model is a promising hypothesis about brain function for generating and modifying the prediction. Although several findings support the involvement of the cerebellum in the internal model, recent results support the influence of other related brain regions on the internal model. A representative example is the motor adaptation ability in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. Although this ability provides some hints about how dopamine deficits and other PD symptoms affect the internal model, previous findings are inconsistent; some reported a deficit in the motor adaptation ability in PD patients, but others reported that the motor adaptation ability of PD patients is comparable to that of healthy controls. A possible factor causing this inconsistency is the difference in task settings, resulting in different cognitive strategies in each study. Here, we demonstrate a larger, but not better, motor adaptation ability in PD patients than in healthy controls while reducing the involvement of cognitive strategies and concentrating on implicit motor adaptation abilities. This study utilizes a smart-device-based experiment that enables motor adaptation experiments anytime and anywhere with less cognitive strategy involvement. The PD patients showed a significant response to insensible environmental changes, but the response was not necessarily suitable for adapting to the changes. Our findings support compensatory cerebellar functions in PD patients from the perspective of motor adaptation.","Takiyama, Ken; Sakurada, Takeshi; Shinya, Masahiro; Sato, Takaaki; Ogihara, Hirofumi; Komatsu, Taiki",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-63717-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32346067/,33

Therefore, cooperation between geriatricians and nephrologists has become mandatory for co-managing kidney disease in these patients. Based on renewed interest in home hemodialysis (HHD), elderly patients may benefit from not being transported from their home for therapy. METHODS Here, we report our experience with HHD involving three elderly patients who were followed-up over a 15-months period in a nursing home. FINDINGS Our experience demonstrates that hospitalization abruptly dropped from 40 days to zero days, the need for erythropoietin stimulating agents (ESAs) diminished, transportation-related costs for home treatments decreased, and quality of life (QoL) improved. This was confirmed by a questionnaire administered to our patients at the start and again after 6 months of HHD which evaluated the Physical Health Component Score (PCS) and the Mental Health Component Score (MCS). DISCUSSION Home hemodialysis may represent an important way to improve social, mental, and physical recovery, while also eliminating the cost of transportation and the discomfort of abandoning their ""homes"" and daily habits. Home hemodialysis is an effective alternative to in-center HD or peritoneal dialysis (PD) that should be offered to elderly patients when a home caregiver is not available, nonetheless, nursing assistance is required. Moreover, HHD allows patients to stay at home, thereby avoiding several weekly trips to the dialysis center, and may be useful in reducing infections, especially in times of the COVID-19 pandemic, as demonstrated by our experience.","Scarpioni, Roberto; Ricardi, Marco; Manini, Alessandra; Chiappini, Paola; Ballocchi, Laura; Albertazzi, Vittorio; DeAmicis, Sara; Melfa, Luigi; Rocca, Chiara; Valsania, Teresa; Blanco, Valentina; Fenocchio, Chiara",Hemodialysis international.

We report colonoscopy follow-up rates after a positive FIT overall and by population characteristics in the BeneFIT demonstration pilot, a Medicaid health insurance plan-delivered mailed FIT outreach program. METHODS In 2016, 2 health insurance plans in Oregon and in Washington state mailed FIT kits to Medicaid patients who, based on claims data, were overdue for CRC screening. We report follow-up colonoscopy completion rates after positive FIT, and differences in completion rates by age, sex, race, ethnicity, preferred language, and number of primary care visits in the prior year. This research was human subjects approved with a waiver of consent for data collection. RESULTS The FIT positivity rates in Health Plan Oregon and Health Plan Washington were 7.9% (39/488) and 14.6% (125/857), respectively. Colonoscopy completion rates within 12 months of the positive test were 35.9% (14/41) in Health Plan Oregon and 32.8% (41/125) in Health Plan Washington. Colonoscopy completion rates were higher among individuals who preferred a language other than English (Non-English speakers 70.0%, English speakers 31.3%, P = .04). CONCLUSION In a health plan-delivered mailed FIT outreach program, follow-up colonoscopy rates after a positive test were low.

MATERIALS AND METHODS From January 2012 to December 2013, 16 patients underwent a new method of orthotopic ileal neobladder after laparoscopic radical cystectomy for bladder cancer. To construct the neobladder, an ileal segment 60cm long was isolated approximately 25cm proximally to the ileocecum. The proximal 20cm of the ileal segment was divided into two parts for bilateral isoperistaltic afferent limbs. The proximal 10cm of the ileal segment was moved to the distal end of the ileal segment for the right isoperistaltic afferent limb, and the remaining proximal 10cm ileal segment was reserved for the left isoperistaltic afferent limb. The remaining length of the 40cm ileal segment was detubularized along its antimesenteric border to form a reservoir. The neobladder was sutured to achieve a spherical configuration. RESULTS All procedures were carried out successfully. The mean operative time was 330 min, mean blood loss was 328mL, and mean hospital stay was 12.5 days. The mean neobladder capacity 6 and 12 months after surgery was 300mL and 401mL, respectively. With a mean follow-up of 22.8 months, all patients achieved daytime continence and 15 achieved nighttime continence. The mean peak urinary flow rate was 11.9mL/s and 12.8mL/s at 6 and 12 months postoperatively, respectively. CONCLUSIONS This novel procedure is feasible, safe, simple to perform, and provides encouraging functional outcomes.

This study assesses the effects of before and after the lockdown on functionality rates and quality of life (QoL) in patients with ALS. METHODS A longitudinal observational study was conducted. Participants were assessed three times - early January (T0), before mandatory lockdown (T1), and during lockdown (T2) - using the ALS Functional Rating Scale-revised (ALSFRS-R), Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), and the ALS-Specific Quality of Life-Short Form (ALSSQOL-SF). The paired-sample t-test and Wilcoxon signed-rank test were used. RESULTS Thirty-two patients were included with a mean age of 56.9 (SD 14.2) years and mean symptoms onset of 27.1 (SD 14.3) months. ALSFRS-R mean scores decayed significantly over time when comparing T0-T1 (0.26 ± 0.38) and T1-T2 (1.36 ± 1.43) slopes (p < 0.001). Significant differences were observed between T1 and T2 for ALSSQOL-SF scores (115.31 ± 17.06 vs. 104.31 ± 20.65), especially in four specific domains, and FSS scores (34.06 ± 16.84 vs. 40.09 ± 17.63). Negative correlations between negative emotions and physical symptoms assessed by ALSSQOL-SF and FSS were found. SIGNIFICANCE OF THE RESULTS Rehabilitation treatment routines in palliative care, such as physiotherapy and speech therapy, appear to mitigate the ALSFRS-R slope. Prolonged interruption of rehabilitation during the lockdown may have accelerated the functional decline in ALS patients' motor skills with as measured after 2 months by the ALSFRS-R in the limb and bulbar subscores, but not respiratory subscore. Other short-term effects, increased fatigue and negative impact on QoL, were also verified.","Gonçalves, Filipe; Magalhães, Bruno",Palliative & supportive care,https://doi.org/10.1017/s1478951521000584; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33942709/,33

Methods This retrospective cohort study reviewed 353 consecutive partial and total knee arthroplasties performed by a single surgeon; 6 were excluded for not using either dressing type. Thus, 347 cases were separated into 2 cohorts: mesh (n = 176) and standard dressing (n = 171). Demographics and risk factors were similar, except for age. Surgical and closure techniques were consistent in all patients. Delayed wound healing was assessed by the surgeon at the 2-week office visit for drainage, suture abscess, or wound edge separation. Secondary outcome measures include infection, office-based closure, and return to the operating room for reclosure. Results There were 2 instances of delayed wound healing in the mesh group and 16 in the standard dressing group (1.14% vs 9.36%, P ≤ .0001). There were significantly fewer reoperations in the mesh group than in the standard group (0 vs 2.33%, P = .04). There were no infections or office-based closures. Conclusion Mesh dressings were associated with fewer episodes of delayed wound healing and reoperations than the standard dressing. A possible mechanism may be that this brand of mesh distributes wound tension more evenly. In addition, because it remains in place longer during the immediate postoperative period, it may work via prolonged wound edge support.","Anderson, Forrest L; Herndon, Carl L; Lakra, Akshay; Geller, Jeffrey A; Cooper, H John; Shah, Roshan P",Arthroplasty today,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.artd.2020.05.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32566715/,33
124068,Arthroscopic transfer of the pectoralis major for irreparable tear of the subscapularis: a preliminary report.,2014,"White clover (Trifolium repens L.) is a widely cultivated cool-season perennial forage legume in temperate grassland systems. Many studies have analyzed the gene expression in this grass species using quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR). The selection of stable reference genes for qRT-PCR is crucial. However, there was no detailed study on reference genes in different tissues of white clover under various abiotic stress conditions. Herein, 14 candidate reference genes (ACT7, ACT101, TUA1109, TUB, CYP, 60SrRNA, UBQ, E3, GAPDH1, GAPDH2, PP2A, BAM3, SAMDC, and ABC) were selected and analyzed by four programs (GeNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and RefFinder). Samples were taken from two tissues (leaves and roots) under five different abiotic stresses (drought, salt, heat, cold, and heavy metal stress). Our results showed that 60SrRNA and ACT101 were the two top-ranked genes for all samples. Under various experimental conditions, the most stable gene was different; however, SAMDC, UBQ, 60SrRNA, and ACT101 were always top ranked. The most suitable reference genes should be selected according to different plant tissues and growth conditions. Validation of these reference genes by expression analysis of Cyt-Cu/Zn SOD and CAT confirmed their reliability. Our study will benefit the subsequent research of gene function in this species.","Pu, Qi; Li, Zhou; Nie, Gang; Zhou, Jiqiong; Liu, Lin; Peng, Yan",Plants,https://doi.org/10.3390/plants9080996; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32764378/,33
124324,Ictal apnea linked to contralateral spread of temporal lobe seizures: Intracranial EEG recordings in refractory temporal lobe epilepsy.,2009,"Since early December 2019, patients with unknown pneumonia have been found in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. The pathogen in these cases was quickly identified as a new type of coronavirus. The World Health Organization named it 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), and the disease caused by the pathogen was called 2019 Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19), which was characterized by higher pathogenicity, transmission of human to human. So it has rapidly spread to more than 190 countries all over the world. With the sudden outbreak of COVID-19, preventing the spread of COVID-19 is the primary problem. Despite fewer children than adults have been affected by the COVID-19, Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU), as a ward for critically ill patients, is also confronted with high risk of 2019-nCoV infection. It is necessary for PICU managers to thoroughly carry out scientific and effective department management and carefully execute of infection control measures to prevent the transmission. According to recommendations for the COVID-19 prevention and control, the relevant guidelines and the authors' work experience, this paper proposes and optimizes the strategic plan for the management of COVID-19 outbreak in PICU, and emphasizes that department managers should conduct comprehensive risk assessments, manage the pediatric patients and healthcare workers meticulously, strengthen the implementation of infection control measures, and use risk management and process control to effectively manage the department as well as to protect the safety of both the patients and the staff.","Zeng, Ping; Luo, Xiaoli; Zeng, Wen; Qiu, Dan; Zhang, Ling; Zhou, Qin; Wang, Tao; Xiong, Zihong",Translational pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.21037/tp-20-422; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33457308/,33

CCAT1 was detected by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) in NSCLC cells (A549, H1299, SK-MES1, H460, and H647) and human bronchial epithelial cells (16HBE). H460 and A549 cells were then selected for the determination of CCAT1 expression after exposure to radiation (0, 2, 4, 6 Gy) at different time points (0, 6, 12, 24 h). Colony forming assay was performed to evaluate the effects of CCAT1 siRNA or pcDNA3.1-CCAT1 vector on the radiosensitivity of H460 and A549 cells. Then, flow cytometry, western blotting and qRT-PCR were also conducted. CCAT1 was increased in NSCLC cells when compared with 16HBE cells, which was declined in a time- and dosage-dependent manner after exposure to radiation. The H460 and A549 cell colonies were decreased and the γ-H2AX expression was elevated with the increase of radiation dosage, which was more obvious in those transfected with CCAT1 siRNA. CCAT1 downregulation arrested NSCLC cells at G2/M phase. Moreover, the enhanced apoptosis of radiotherapy-treated NSCLC cells with reductions of p-p38/p38, p-ERK/ERK, and p-JNK/JNK was promoted by siCCAT1, but it was reversed by pcDNA3.1-CCAT1 vector. Inhibiting CCAT1 regulated cell cycle, DNA damage and apoptosis of NSCLC cells, and affected MAPK pathway, eventually improving the radiosensitivity of NSCLC.","Wang, Zhao",The Kaohsiung journal of medical sciences,https://doi.org/10.1002/kjm2.12387; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33955133/,33
124818,Transgastric organ resection solely with the prototype R-scope and the self-approximating transluminal access technique.,2010,"BACKGROUND The relationship between the prehospital airway device used and later development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is unknown. We sought to determine if the prehospital airway device choice is associated with an increased risk of VAP in risk-adjusted critically injured patients. METHODS We performed a retrospective analysis of all trauma patients requiring definitive airway placement before intensive care unit admission at a Level I trauma center from 2008 to 2012. Prehospital airway management strategies were classified as extraglottic device placement, endotracheal intubation, bag-valve mask ventilation (BVM), or lack of a prehospital airway with subsequent intubation at the trauma center. Patients were excluded if they were hospital transfers, were dead on arrival, died in the emergency department, or did not require at least 48 hours of mechanical ventilation. The primary end point was the development of VAP as determined by institutional guidelines for diagnosis. Logistic regression was used to determine risk factors for VAP. RESULTS A total of 317 patients met inclusion criteria. The median age was 37 years (interquartile range, 25-51 years), 75% were male, 78% sustained a blunt injury, and the median Injury Severity Score (ISS) was 29 (interquartile range, 21-34). Ninety-seven patients (30.6%) developed VAP. Prehospital airway strategies were as follows: 17 (5.4%) had extraglottic device placement, 28 (8.8%) had BVM, 84 (26.5%) had endotracheal intubation, and 188 (59.3%) had no prehospital airway placement and were intubated after arrival. The type of prehospital airway was not statistically significant in terms of VAP development (range, 26.1-42.9%; p = 0.15). The only statistically significant predictor of VAP was length of mechanical ventilation (univariate: odds ratio, 1.14; 95% confidence interval, 1.10-1.18; p ≤ 0.01; multivariate: odds ratio, 1.15; 95% confidence interval, 1.10-1.20; p ≤ 0.01). CONCLUSION Our data suggest that the prehospital airway device used was not associated with the development of VAP.

124821,BCG vaccination potential for COVID-19: an analytical approach.,2021-03-26,"BACKGROUND The anatomical and physiological changes after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass for morbid obesity can lead to severe hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia with neuroglycopenia in a small percentage of patients. The exact physiologic mechanism is not completely understood. Surgical reversal to the original anatomy and distal or total pancreatectomy are current therapeutic options to reverse the hypoglycemic effect, with substantial associated morbidity. Our group reports a pilot clinical series of a novel surgical technique using one-anastomosis jejunal interposition with gastric remnant resection (Branco-Zorron Switch). METHODS Patients with severe symptomatic hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia refractory to conservative therapy were treated using the technique. The procedure started with resection of the remnant stomach close to pylorus. The alimentary limb was sectioned at 20 cm from the gastrojejunal anastomosis, and the rest of the alimentary limb was resected until the Y-Roux anastomosis. A hand-sutured anastomosis was then performed with the proximal alimentary limb and the remnant antrum. RESULTS Four patients were successfully submitted to the procedure with reversal of the symptomatology and normalization of insulin levels, postprandial glucose levels, and oral glucose tolerance test, with a mean follow-up of 24.3 months. Mean operative time was 188 min, and patients recovered without postoperative complications. CONCLUSION Patients suffering from severe hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia after gastric bypass may be efficiently treated by this innovative procedure, avoiding extreme surgical therapy such as pancreatectomy or restoring the gastric anatomy, while still maintaining sustained weight loss. Studies with larger series and longer follow-up are still needed to define the role of this therapy in managing this entity.","Zorron, Ricardo; Branco, Alcides; Sampaio, Jose; Bothe, Claudia; Junghans, Tido; Rasim, Gyurdzhan; Pratschke, Johann; Guel-Klein, Safak",Obesity surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-016-2410-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27738969/,33

METHODS A scoping review of the literature published in English since 1980 was conducted using MEDLINE, Ovid EMBASE, PsychINFO, CINAHL, Austhealth, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; Cochrane library) and Web of Science MEDLINE and MEBASE to identify relevant studies. RESULTS We included 77 eligible studies with both randomised controlled trial and cohort design methodology. A variety of trauma was included such as traumatic brain injuries (n = 52; 67.5%), spinal cord injury (n = 14; 18.2%) and multi-trauma (n = 9; 11.7%) to both adult (n = 38) and paediatric (n = 32) participants. Telehealth is used in pre-hospital and acute-care settings (n = 11; 14.3%) to facilitate assessment, and in rehabilitation and follow-up (n = 61; 79.2%) to deliver therapy. Effects on health were reported the most (n = 46), with no negative outcomes. The feasibility of telehealth as a delivery mode was established, but coordination and technical issues are barriers to use. Overall, both patients and clinicians were satisfied using this mode of delivery. CONCLUSION This review demonstrates how telehealth is utilised across a spectrum of patients with traumatic injuries and to facilitate delivery of therapy, specialist consultations and assessments, with many studies reporting improvements to health. There is a paucity of high-quality rigorous research, which makes replication of findings and uptake of the intervention problematic. Future telehealth and trauma research should focus on the quality and reproducibility of telehealth interventions and the economic feasibility of using this platform to deliver trauma care.","Wake, Elizabeth; Atkins, Heidi; Willock, Ashley; Hawkes, Angela; Dawber, Jessica; Weir, Kelly A",Journal of telemedicine and telecare,https://doi.org/10.1177/1357633x20940868; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32715866/,33

This analysis aimed to identify predictors of bleeding events among A Comparison of Prasugrel at the Time of PCI or as Pretreatment at the Time of Diagnosis in Patients with NSTEACS (ACCOAST) study population. METHODS AND RESULTS The ACCOAST study randomised 4033 patients with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) to (A) a 30 mg prasugrel loading dose (LD) followed by coronary angiography with an additional 30 mg prasugrel at the time of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or (B) a placebo LD followed by a 60 mg prasugrel at the time of PCI. Patients received standard of care, including use of aspirin. Independent predictors of Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) major bleeding not related to coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) within 7 days were assessed using stepwise Cox proportional model for time to first occurrence of the event. Non-CABG-related TIMI major or minor bleeding was similarly analysed. Non-CABG-related TIMI major bleeding occurred in 36 (0.9%) patients, and TIMI major or minor bleeding occurred in 81 (2.0%) patients. Independent predictors for TIMI major bleeding alone were pretreatment with prasugrel LD (HR 3.02; 95% CI 1.42 to 6.43), femoral access (HR 2.45; 95% CI 1.11 to 5.38), female sex (HR 2.57; 95% CI 1.32 to 5.00), placement of >1 stent (HR 2.50; 95% CI 1.26 to 4.95) and age (HR 1.05; 95% CI 1.02 to 1.09). Pretreatment with prasugrel LD (HR 3.05; 95% CI 1.84 to 5.07), femoral access (HR 3.06; 95% CI 1.74 to 5.38), female sex (HR 2.62; 95% CI 1.67 to 4.12), performed PCI (HR 2.21; 95% CI 1.23 to 3.99), therapy with glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors (HR 1.88; 95% CI 1.06 to 3.33) and age (increased bleed per year of age HR 1.04; 95% CI 1.02 to 1.06) were independent predictors of TIMI major or minor bleeding through 7 days.

The composition of skin microbiome communities and the causality of dysbiosis in eczema have not been well established. The objective of this review is to describe the skin microbiome profile in AD and address whether there is a causal relationship between dysbiosis and AD. The protocol is registered in PROSPERO (CRD42016035813). We searched PubMed, Embase, Scopus and ClinicalTrials.gov for primary research studies applying culture-independent analysis on the microbiome on AD skin of humans and animal models. Two authors independently screened the full text of studies for eligibility and assessed risk of bias. Because of heterogeneity no quantitative synthesis was done. Of 5735 texts, 32 met the inclusion criteria (17 published: 11 human and six animal studies). The studies varied in quality and applied different methodology. The skin in AD had low bacterial diversity (lowest at dermatitis-involved sites) and three studies showed depletion of Malassezia spp. and high non-Malassezia fungal diversity. The relative abundance of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis were elevated and other genera were reduced, including Propionibacterium. A mouse study indicated that dysbiosis is a driving factor in eczema pathogenesis. The data are not sufficiently robust for good characterization; however, dysbiosis in AD not only implicates Staphylococcus spp., but also microbes such as Propionibacterium and Malassezia. A causal role of dysbiosis in eczema in mice should encourage future studies to investigate if this also applies to humans. Other important aspects are temporal dynamics and the influence of methodology on microbiome data.","Bjerre, R D; Bandier, J; Skov, L; Engstrand, L; Johansen, J D",The British journal of dermatology,https://doi.org/10.1111/bjd.15390; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28207943/,33

A Glimpse Into the Future in the Midst of a Pandemic"".",2020-06-10,"Biosensors enable observation and understanding of latent physiological occurrences otherwise unknown or invasively detected. Wearable biosensors monitoring physiological constructs across a wide variety of mental and physical health conditions have become an important trend in innovative research methodologies. Within substance use research, explorations of biosensor technology commonly focus on identifying physiological indicators of intoxication to increase understanding of addiction etiology and to inform treatment recommendations. In this review, we examine the state of research in this area as it pertains to treatment of alcohol use disorders specifically highlighting the gaps in our current knowledge with recommendations for future research. Annually, alcohol use disorders affect approximately 15 million individuals. A primary focus of existing wearable technology-based research among people with alcohol use disorders is identifying alcohol intoxication. A large benefit of wearable biosensors for this purpose is they provide continuous readings in a passive manner compared with the gold standard measure of blood alcohol content (BAC) traditionally measured intermittently by breathalyzer or blood draw. There are two primary means of measuring intoxication with biosensors: gait and sweat. Gait changes have been measured via smart sensors placed on the wrist, in the shoe, and mobile device sensors in smart phones. Sweat measured by transdermal biosensors detects the presence of alcohol in the blood stream correlating to BAC. Transdermal biosensors have been designed in tattoos/skin patches, shirts, and most commonly, devices worn on the ankle or wrist. Transdermal devices were initially developed to help monitor court-ordered sobriety among offenders with alcohol use disorder. These devices now prove most useful in continuously tracking consumption throughout clinical trials for behavioral treatment modalities. More recent research has started exploring the uses for physical activity trackers and physiological arousal sensors to guide behavioral interventions for relapse prevention. While research has begun to demonstrate wearable devices' utility in reducing alcohol consumption among individuals aiming to cutdown on their drinking, monitoring sustained abstinence in studies exploring contingency management for alcohol use disorders, and facilitating engagement in activity-based treatment interventions, their full potential to further aid in understanding of, and treatment for, alcohol use disorders has yet to be explored.","Davis-Martin, Rachel E; Alessi, Sheila M; Boudreaux, Edwin D",Frontiers in psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.642813; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33828497/,33

By understanding how these factors intersect to influence desired and actual scope of practice decisions, we hope to inform strategies to address training and health care workforce needs. METHODS During 5 focus group discussions, comprised of a total of 32 family physicians who either resided in or attended a residency program in western North Carolina, we explored family physicians' attitudes and perspectives on their desired and actual scope of practice. We used thematic analysis to identify patterns in the qualitative data. RESULTS We created a conceptual framework to understand the complex factors which influence family physicians' scope of practice. Personal factors were found to impact desired scope, while workplace, environmental, and population factors influenced actual scope of practice. Stressors in each of these 4 categories often caused family physicians to narrow their scope of practice. Our study highlights specific supports that, if in place, enable physicians to maintain their desired broad scope of practice. CONCLUSIONS Our study indicates that the national trend toward family physicians narrowing their scope of practice can be addressed by providing specific supports during training, residency, and mid-career. Understanding personal, workplace, environmental, and population factors that influence scope of practice can inform specific interventions that create desirable jobs for family physicians and improve their ability to meet changing population needs.","Russell, Amy; Fromewick, Jill; Macdonald, Brittney; Kimmel, Stephen; Franke, Kara; Leach, Kimberly; Foley, Kathy",Annals of family medicine,https://doi.org/10.1370/afm.2669; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34180841/,33

The purpose of this study was (1) to set a passing score through a psychometrically sound process and (2) to determine what pretest factors predicted passing the FUSE examination. METHODS Beta-testing of multiple-choice questions on 62 topics of importance to the safe use of surgical energy-based devices was performed. Eligible test takers were physicians with a minimum of 1 year of surgical training who were recruited by FUSE task force members. A pretest survey collected baseline information. RESULTS A total of 227 individuals completed the FUSE beta-test, and 208 completed the pretest survey. The passing/cut score for the first test form of the FUSE multiple-choice examination was determined using the modified Angoff methodology and for the second test form was determined using a linear equating methodology. The overall passing rate across the two examination forms was 81.5%. Self-reported time studying the FUSE Web-based curriculum for a minimum of >2 h was associated with a passing examination score (p < 0.001). Performance was not different based on increased years of surgical practice (p = 0.363), self-reported expertise on one or more types of energy-based devices (p = 0.683), participation in the FUSE postgraduate course (p = 0.426), or having reviewed the FUSE manual (p = 0.428). Logistic regression found that studying the FUSE didactics for >2 h predicted a passing score (OR 3.61; 95% CI 1.44-9.05; p = 0.006) independent of the other baseline characteristics recorded. CONCLUSION(S) The development of the FUSE examination, including the passing score, followed a psychometrically sound process.

METHODS This study provides preliminary analysis of the Confidence in Atrial FibriLlation Management (CALM) scale, which was rationally developed to measure patient confidence related to self-management of AF. The scale was provided to a sample of AF patients N = 120, (59% male) electronically through a patient education platform. Principal component analysis (PCA) and Cronbach's α were employed to provide preliminary assessment of the validity and reliability of the measure. RESULTS PCA identified a four-factor solution. Internal consistency of the CALM was considered excellent with Cronbach's α = .910. Additional PCA confirmed the value of a single factor solution to produce a total confidence score for improved utility and ease of clinical interpretation.

127945,Tissue Type-Specific Bioenergetic Abnormalities in Adults with Major Depression.,2017,"BACKGROUND Since the emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 (Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) in Wuhan, China, it has been extensively studied by many scientists. Susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection is shown by people of all ages, especially those with different comorbidities. Our goal was to describe the clinical characteristics, treatment, course, and outcome of COVID-19 in patients with pre-existing neurological disorders. METHOD We retrospectively studied 70 patients with COVID-19 and previous neurological diseases who were treated in the Central Clinical Hospital of the Ministry of the Interior and Administration from 16 March to 15 June 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, image data, laboratory results, treatment methods and results, clinical signs and symptoms of patients hospitalised due to CNS diseases with COVID-19 were collected. RESULTS The average age of hospitalised patients was 72, and the majority (63%) were women (44/70). The most common neurological disease was dementia, which was present in almost a third of patients (30.76%), followed by ischaemic stroke (24.61%). Chest imaging showed the presence of interstitial changes in 47% (33) of patients. Laboratory tests revealed increased total blood cells, increased levels of C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, D-dimers, liver indicator markers and IL-6 in the most severely affected patients. The treatment of patients was focused on monitoring their clinical condition, and supporting respiratory inefficiency with passive oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation. According to the guidelines of the Hospital Therapeutic Committee, pharmacological treatment (Arechin®, Kaletra®) was introduced in cases without contraindications. In patients with moderate COVID-19, antimalarial or antiviral agents were applied (78%). 30% of our observed patients died during the hospitalisation. CONCLUSIONS We studied a select group of patients (elderly, with comorbidities, and moderate or severe COVID-19 course). Pre-existing neurological disorders were additionally associated with a poorer prognosis and a high fatality rate (30%). Dementia and CNS vascular disorder were the most frequent pre-existing neurological conditions. The neurological symptoms of COVID-19 were various. We observed impaired consciousness, dizziness, headache, nausea, myalgia, psychomotor agitation and slowness, delirium, and psychoses. Further analysis is needed to elucidate the incidence of COVID-19 neurological complications.","Zielińska-Turek, Justyna; Jasińska, Anna; Kołakowska, Jolanta; Szadurska, Joanna; Kosior, Dariusz A; Dorobek, Małgorzata",Neurologia i neurochirurgia polska,https://doi.org/10.5603/pjnns.a2021.0011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33528832/,33
128107,Use and wear of anti-embolism stockings: a clinical audit of surgical patients.,2011,"OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and safety of a polyglycolic acid (PGA) yarn implant for nonthermal ablation of saphenous vein reflux. METHODS In two consecutive cohort studies (TAHOE I and TAHOE II), the feasibility of abolition of great saphenous vein (GSV) reflux by implantation of a PGA yarn was tested under ultrasound guidance in 51 and 30 patients, respectively. The use of tumescent local anesthesia was not required. Graduated compression stockings and thrombosis prophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin were used for 2 weeks after intervention in the first study only. RESULTS Of 81 enrolled patients, 77 (95%) were available at 6-month follow-up. Complete occlusion of the treated GSV was confirmed by duplex ultrasound in all patients except one patient at day 1. In TAHOE II, closure was preserved in a higher percentage of patients at 6 weeks, with 96.4% vs 82.0% in TAHOE I. The 6-month Kaplan-Meier estimated occlusion rates for TAHOE I and TAHOE II were 68% (95% confidence interval [CI], 54%-79%) and 69% (95% CI, 49%-82%), respectively, with an estimated combined occlusion rate of 69% (95% CI, 57%-76%). Kaplan-Meier analysis yielded a combined reflux-free rate of 85% (95% CI, 75%-91%) at 3 months of follow-up and a rate of 81% (95% CI, 71%-88%) at 6 months of follow-up. Venous Clinical Severity Score (VCSS) improved from a combined mean of 4.6 ± 3.1 at baseline to 2.1 ± 2.2 and 1.6 ± 1.9 at 3 and 6 months, respectively (P < .0001 for 3- and 6-month results). In TAHOE II, four patients with venous ulcers healed at an average of 1.3 months after treatment. CONCLUSIONS First-in-human use of an endovenous PGA yarn implant for occlusion of refluxing GSVs proved to be feasible, with no serious adverse events. However, recanalization was observed during a period of 6 months in 31% of patients.","Proebstle, Thomas M; Kleis-Fischer, Bettina; Möhler, Thomas; Goeckeritz, Oliver; Franklin, Ian J; Almeida, Jose I",Journal of vascular surgery.

128213,Endoscopic management of Barrett's esophagus: European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) Position Statement.,2017,"Biodiversity is of critical value to human societies, but recent evidence that biodiversity may mitigate infectious-disease risk has sparked controversy among researchers. The majority of work on this topic has focused on direct assessments of the relationship between biodiversity and endemic-pathogen prevalence, without disentangling intervening mechanisms; thus study outcomes often differ, fuelling more debate. Here, we suggest two critical changes to the approach researchers take to understanding relationships between infectious disease, both endemic and emerging, and biodiversity that may help clarify sources of controversy. First, the distinct concepts of hazards versus risks need to be separated to determine how biodiversity and its drivers may act differently on each. This distinction is particularly important since it illustrates that disease emergence drivers in humans could be quite different to the general relationship between biodiversity and transmission of endemic pathogens. Second, the interactive relationship among biodiversity, anthropogenic change and zoonotic disease risk, including both direct and indirect effects, needs to be recognized and accounted for. By carefully disentangling these interactions between humans' activities and pathogen circulation in wildlife, we suggest that conservation efforts could mitigate disease risks and hazards in novel ways that complement more typical disease control efforts.This article is part of the themed issue 'Conservation, biodiversity and infectious disease: scientific evidence and policy implications'.","Hosseini, Parviez R; Mills, James N; Prieur-Richard, Anne-Hélène; Ezenwa, Vanessa O; Bailly, Xavier; Rizzoli, Annapaola; Suzán, Gerardo; Vittecoq, Marion; García-Peña, Gabriel E; Daszak, Peter; Guégan, Jean-François; Roche, Benjamin","Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society of London.

128706,Erratum.,2021-03-16,"BACKGROUND Suicide presents an ongoing public health challenge internationally. Nearly 800 000 people around the world lose their life to suicide every year, and many more attempt suicide. METHODS A decomposition analysis was performed using global suicide mortality and population data from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019. RESULTS Despite a significant decrease in age-specific suicide rate between 1990 and 2019 (-4.01; from 13.8% to 9.8% per 100 000), the overall numbers of suicide deaths increased by 19 897 (from 738 799 to 758 696) in the same time period. The reductions in age-specific suicide rates (-6.09; 152%) contributed to the overall reductions in suicide rates; however, this was offset by overtime changes in population age structure (2.08; -52%). The increase in suicide numbers was partly attributable to population growth (300 942; 1512.5%) and population age structure (189 512; 952.4%), which was attenuated by the significant reduction in overall suicide rates (-470 556; 2364.9%). The combined effect of these factors varied across the World Bank income level regions. For example, in the upper-middle-income level region, the effect of the reduction in age-specific suicide rates (-289 731; -1456.1%) exceeded the effect of population age structure (124 577; 626.1%) and population growth (83 855; 421.4%), resulting in its substantial decline in total suicide deaths (-81 298; -408.6%). However, in lower-middle income region, there was a notable increase in suicide death (72 550; 364.6%), which was related to the net gain of the reduction in age-specific suicide rates (-115 577; -580.9%) and negated by the increase in the number of suicide deaths due to population growth (152 093; 764.4%) and population age structure (36 034; 181.1%). CONCLUSION More support and resources should be deployed for suicide prevention to the low-income and middle-income regions in order to achieve the reduction goal. Moreover, suicide prevention among older adults is increasingly critical given the world's rapidly ageing populations in all income level regions.","Yip, Paul Siu Fai; Zheng, Yan; Wong, Clifford",Injury prevention : journal of the International Society for Child and Adolescent Injury Prevention,https://doi.org/10.1136/injuryprev-2021-044263; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34400542/,33

However, the factors contributing to its disparate racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic effects are part of an expansive and continuous history of oppressive social policy and marginalising geopolitics. This history is characterised by institutionally generated spatial inequalities forged through processes of residential segregation and neglectful urban planning. In the USA, aspects of COVID-19's manifestation closely mirror elements of the build-up and response to the Flint crisis, Michigan's racially and class-contoured water crisis that began in 2014, and to other prominent environmental injustice cases, such as the 1995 Chicago (IL, USA) heatwave that severely affected the city's south and west sides, predominantly inhabited by Black people. Each case shares common macrosocial and spatial characteristics and is instructive in showing how civic trust suffers in the aftermath of public health disasters, becoming especially degenerative among historically and spatially marginalised populations. Offering a commentary on the sociogeographical dynamics that gave rise to these crises and this institutional distrust, we discuss how COVID-19 has both inherited and augmented patterns of spatial inequality. We conclude by outlining particular steps that can be taken to prevent and reduce spatial inequalities generated by COVID-19, and by discussing the preliminary steps to restore trust between historically disenfranchised communities and the public officials and institutions tasked with responding to COVID-19.","Ezell, Jerel M; Griswold, Delilah; Chase, Elizabeth C; Carver, Evan",The Lancet.

This report provides a systematic review of the evidence on the carbon footprint of telemedicine. The identified papers unanimously report that telemedicine does reduce the carbon footprint of healthcare, primarily by reduction in transport-associated emissions. The carbon footprint savings range between 0.70-372 kg CO2e per consultation. However, these values are highly context specific. The carbon emissions produced from the use of the telemedicine systems themselves were found to be very low in comparison to emissions saved from travel reductions. This could have wide implications in reducing the carbon footprint of healthcare services globally. In order for telemedicine services to be successfully implemented, further research is necessary to determine context-specific considerations and potential rebound effects.","Purohit, Amy; Smith, James; Hibble, Arthur",Future healthcare journal,https://doi.org/10.7861/fhj.2020-0080; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33791483/,33

Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been identified as pivotal regulators in the tumorigenesis of glioma. However, the role of lncRNA urothelial carcinoma-associated 1 (UCA1) in glioma genesis is still unknown. The purpose of this study was to investigate the underlying function of UCA1 on glioma genesis. The results demonstrated that UCA1 was upregulated in glioma tissue and indicated a poor prognosis. UCA1 knockdown induced by si-UCA1 significantly suppressed the proliferative, migrative, and invasive activities of glioma cell lines (U87 and U251). Bioinformatics analysis and luciferase reporter assay verified the complementary binding within UCA1 and miR-122 at the 3-UTR. Functional experiments revealed that UCA1 acted as an miR-122 sponge to modulate glioma cell proliferation, migration, and invasion via downregulation of miR-122. Overall, the present study demonstrated that lncRNA UCA1 acts as an endogenous sponge of miR-122 to promote glioma cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, which provides a novel insight and therapeutic target in the tumorigenesis of glioma.",,Oncology research,https://doi.org/10.3727/096504021x16137463165433; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33731249/,33

The pediatric neurosurgery practice differs from that of adults in that it treats children in various stages of physical and psychological development and contemplates diseases that do not exist in other areas. The aim of this study was to identify the level of knowledge and readiness of the healthcare providers, as well as to evaluate new preventive practices that have been introduced, psychological concerns, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on pediatric neurosurgical units in Brazil. METHODS Pediatric neurosurgeons were given an online questionnaire developed by the Brazilian Society of Pediatric Neurosurgery to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their clinical practice. RESULTS Of a cohort of 110 active members of the Brazilian Society of Pediatric Neurosurgery, 76 completed the survey (69%). Ninety-six percent were aware of the correct use of and indication for the types of personal protective equipment in clinical and surgical practices, but only 73.7% of them had unrestricted access to this equipment. Ninety-eight percent of participants agreed or strongly agreed that the pandemic had affected their pediatric neurosurgical practice. The COVID-19 pandemic interfered with outpatient care in 88% of the centers, it affected neurosurgical activity in 90.7%, and it led to the cancellation of elective neurosurgical procedures in 57.3%. Concerning the impact of COVID-19 on surgical activity, 9.2% of the centers had less than 25% of the clinical practice affected, 46.1% had 26%-50% of their activity reduced, 35.5% had a 51%-75% reduction, and 9.2% had more than 75% of their surgical work cancelled or postponed. Sixty-three percent affirmed that patients had been tested for COVID-19 before surgery. Regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of those interviewed, 3.9% reported fear and anxiety with panic episodes, 7.9% had worsening of previous anxiety symptoms, 60.5% reported occasional fear, 10.5% had sadness and some depressive symptoms, and 2.6% reported depressive symptoms. CONCLUSIONS The COVID-19 pandemic has posed unprecedented challenges to healthcare services worldwide, including neurosurgical units. Medical workers, pediatric neurosurgeons included, should be aware of safety measures and follow the recommendations of local healthcare organizations, preventing and controlling the disease.

Immobilization of enzymes on organic support nanomaterials was reported to significantly improve thermal, pH and storage stability, acting also as a protection against metal ions inhibitory effects. In particular, the effects of enzyme immobilization on reusability, physical, kinetic and thermodynamic parameters were considered. Due to their biocompatibility with low health risks, organic support nanomaterials represent a good choice for the immobilization of enzymes. Organic nanomaterials, and especially organic-inorganic hybrids, can significantly improve the kinetic and thermodynamic parameters of immobilized enzymes compared to macroscopic supports. Moreover, organic nanomaterials are more environment friendly for medical applications, such as prodrug carriers and biosensors.

Risk factors include the use of corticosteroids, smoking, alcohol, rheumatologic disorders, hematologic disorders, and metabolic disorders. To the authors' knowledge, this study presents the first case of bilateral atraumatic AVN to the navicular and medial cuneiform in a patient with systemic lupus erythamatosus (SLE). CASE DESCRIPTION A 40-year-old man presented with a past medical history of SLE in which he developed AVN of the tarsal navicular and medial cuneiform. This occurred first on the subject's right foot and then while recovering from surgical intervention, on his left foot. Talonaviculocuneiform arthrodesis was performed with the use of distal tibial autograft on both extremities. The subject's American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society midfoot score improved from 34 to 80 at 21 months on the right and 37 to 90 at 15 months to the left. DISCUSSION Patients with SLE carry a significant risk of developing AVN. Comorbidities such as vasculitis, corticosteroid use, cytotoxic medication, and peripheral neuropathy are known risk factors in the development of AVN. Unusual features such as multifocal AVN and unusual anatomic locations can occur with SLE. AVN of the foot is generally treated with surgical intervention. Treatments such as core decompression, open reduction and internal fixation, and arthrodesis have been recommended based on the symptoms and presentation. CONCLUSION The authors present a very rare presentation of bilateral osteonecrosis of the tarsal navicular and first cuneiform in a patient with SLE. The patient was treated with bilateral talonaviculocuneiform arthrodesis. The patient demonstrated considerable improvement to both extremities.

This study aims to establish a preclinical research model for EMPD. We transplanted EMPD tissue into immunodeficient NOD/Scid mice. Histopathological and genetic analyses using a comprehensive cancer panel were performed. For in vivo preclinical treatments, trastuzumab, lapatinib, docetaxel, or eribulin were administered to patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models. Tissue transplanted from the EMPD patient was enlarged in NOD/Scid mice and was transplanted into further generations. Both the transplantation of PDX into nu/nu mice and the reanimation of the cryopreserved xenografted tumors in NOD/Scid mice were successful. We also established an EMPD-PDX-derived primary cell culture. Histopathologically, the xenografted tumors were positive for CK7, which was consistent with the patient's tumors. Genetically, the pathogenic mutation ERBB2 S310F was detected in the patient's tumors (primary intraepidermal lesion, metastatic lymph node) and was observed in the xenografted tumors even after continued passages. The xenografted tumors responded well to trastuzumab and lapatinib therapy. Also, cytotoxic agents (docetaxel and eribulin) were effective against the xenografted tumors. This PDX model (EMPD-PDX-H1) could be a powerful tool for the research and development of EMPD treatments.","Maeda, Takuya; Kitamura, Shinya; Nishihara, Hiroshi; Yanagi, Teruki",Oncogene,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41388-020-01404-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32724160/,33

The present paper shows our short-term and long-term results with flexible endoscopic cricopharyngeal myotomy/septotomy. PATIENTS AND METHODS A retrospective analysis of our experience in patients with Zenker's diverticulum treated using a flexible endoscope, assisted by a flexible diverticuloscope, between 2002 and 2015. Myotomy/septotomy was performed with a needle-knife papillotome under deep sedation or general anesthesia. RESULTS Among the 64 patients treated, two died within 10 days of surgery from causes not directly related to the procedure, and one presented with pharyngo-esophageal perforation, which recovered with conservative management at 47 days after admission. Four additional patients were lost to short-term follow-up. Among the 57 remaining patients, 52 had complete relief of dysphagia after 6 weeks. Eleven of these had recurrent symptoms on the mid and the long term. Eight were retreated with the same flexible endoscopic technique, one with a hybrid endoscopic approach, one with classical open surgery and one refused retreatment. After a mean follow-up of 2 years and a half, 33 of 37 patients reported absent or minimal dysphagia, controllable with punctual dietary restrictions. CONCLUSIONS Flexible endoscopic treatment for Zenker's diverticulum is effective and safe. It represents an option on an equal footing to rigid endoscopy and classical open surgery and may also be used when the latter two are technically impracticable or contraindicated.","de la Morena Madrigal, Emilio Jesús; Pérez Arellano, Elena; Rodríguez García, Isabel",Revista espanola de enfermedades digestivas : organo oficial de la Sociedad Espanola de Patologia Digestiva,https://doi.org/10.17235/reed.2016.4030/2015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27322751/,33

Treatments utilized in clinical practice include fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC). Our aim was to compare case fatality with different reversal strategies. METHODS We pooled individual ICH patient data from 16 stroke registries in 9 countries (n = 10 282), of whom 1,797 (17%) were on VKA. After excluding 250 patients with international normalized ratio < 1.3 and/or missing data required for analysis, we compared all-cause 30-day case fatality using Cox regression. RESULTS We included 1,547 patients treated with FFP (n = 377, 24%), PCC (n = 585, 38%), both (n = 131, 9%), or neither (n = 454, 29%). The crude case fatality and adjusted hazard ratio (HR) were highest with no reversal (61.7%, HR = 2.540, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.784-3.616, p < 0.001), followed by FFP alone (45.6%, HR = 1.344, 95% CI = 0.934-1.934, p = 0.112), then PCC alone (37.3%, HR = 1.445, 95% CI = 1.014-2.058, p = 0.041), compared to reversal with both FFP and PCC (27.8%, reference). Outcomes with PCC versus FFP were similar (HR = 1.075, 95% CI = 0.874-1.323, p = 0.492); 4-factor PCC (n = 441) was associated with higher case fatality compared to 3-factor PCC (n = 144, HR = 1.441, 95% CI = 1.041-1.995, p = 0.027). INTERPRETATION The combination of FFP and PCC might be associated with the lowest case fatality in reversal of VKA-ICH, and FFP may be equivalent to PCC. Randomized controlled trials with functional outcomes are needed to establish the most effective treatment.","Parry-Jones, Adrian R; Di Napoli, Mario; Goldstein, Joshua N; Schreuder, Floris H B M; Tetri, Sami; Tatlisumak, Turgut; Yan, Bernard; van Nieuwenhuizen, Koen M; Dequatre-Ponchelle, Nelly; Lee-Archer, Matthew; Horstmann, Solveig; Wilson, Duncan; Pomero, Fulvio; Masotti, Luca; Lerpiniere, Christine; Godoy, Daniel Agustin; Cohen, Abigail S; Houben, Rik; Al-Shahi Salman, Rustam; Pennati, Paolo; Fenoglio, Luigi; Werring, David; Veltkamp, Roland; Wood, Edith; Dewey, Helen M; Cordonnier, Charlotte; Klijn, Catharina J M; Meligeni, Fabrizio; Davis, Stephen M; Huhtakangas, Juha; Staals, Julie; Rosand, Jonathan; Meretoja, Atte",Annals of neurology,https://doi.org/10.1002/ana.24416; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25857223/,33

To verify this, we compared the surgical outcomes of RM vs LM for the number of myomas removed. METHODS The medical records of 144 women underwent LM and 121 women underwent RM by a single surgeon were reviewed. RESULTS The operative time did not statistically differ between the groups, even when the number of removed myomas was more than 12 (200.6 ± 48.2 vs 196.0 ± 48.4 min, P = .791). Note that in our logistic regression analysis, the operation type of operation was excluded from the independent risk factors prolonging operative time. CONCLUSION RM showed a similar operative time relative to LM regardless of the number of myomas removed (numerous or not). This article is protected by copyright.

This study aims to examine the associations between precautionary health behaviors (eating vitamins, washing hands continuously, eating healthy food, putting on masks, wearing gloves, and maintaining a safe distance) and illness attitudes (worry about illness, concern about pain, hypochondriacal beliefs, thanatophobia, and treatment experience). An online questionnaire was distributed to 1,413 Kuwaiti participants using the convenience-sampling method via the WhatsApp application. The online survey collected data based on the Illness Attitude toward COVID-19 Scale (IATCS) and on demographics. The findings of the study show that there are significant associations between the illness attitudes of participants and the precautionary health behaviors they adopted during the COVID-19 pandemic in Kuwait. Illness attitudes toward COVID-19 significantly affect the health behaviors of individuals.

The COVID-19 pandemic quickly affected care access and shifted healthcare delivery, and neuropsychology has adapted successfully to provide tele-neuropsychological (teleNP) DBS evaluations during this time, thus permanently changing the landscape of neuropsychological practice. Method: In this paper, we discuss the lessons learned from the pandemic and we offer care management guidelines for teleNP and in-person evaluations of pre-DBS populations, with exploration of the feasibility of the different approaches for uninterrupted care access. Results: We summarize the strengths and weaknesses of these care models and we provide future directions for the state of clinical neuropsychological practice for DBS programs, with implications for broader patient populations. Conclusions: A better understanding of these dynamics will inform and educate the DBS team and community regarding the complexities of performing DBS neuropsychological evaluations during COVID-19 and beyond.","Palmese, C A; Wyman-Chick, K A; Racine, C; Pollak, L E; Lin, G; Farace, E; Tran, B; Floden, D; Bobholz, J; Turner, T H; York, M K",The Clinical neuropsychologist,https://doi.org/10.1080/13854046.2021.1929496; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34030595/,33

MATERIALS AND METHODS Outcomes from consecutive patients who underwent percutaneous tenotomy with the TX-1 device were compared with outcomes from consecutive patients who underwent surgical tenotomy. Patients were contacted to retrospectively assess their outcomes at 4 time points: before treatment, 2 weeks after treatment, 3 to 6 months after treatment, and 12 months after treatment. Outcomes were assessed using the quick disabilities of the arm, shoulder, and hand score (QuickDASH) and the Oxford elbow score (OES). Student's t tests were used to compare postprocedural versus preprocedural scores and percutaneous versus surgical tenotomy scores. RESULTS Response rates were 23 of 43 and 10 of 47 for surveyed percutaneous and surgical tenotomy patients, respectively. There were significant improvements from preprocedural scores in all primary outcome measures at 3-to-6-month and 12-month time points for both procedures. No significant changes from preprocedural scores were seen for either procedure at 2 weeks after treatment or between percutaneous and surgical tenotomy in preprocedural or postprocedural scores for any outcome measure. At 2 weeks, improved percutaneous tenotomy scores approached significance compared with percutaneous preprocedural QuickDASH (p = 0.060) and surgical 2-week OES function domain (p = 0.074) scores. CONCLUSION Ultrasonic percutaneous tenotomy with the TX-1 device and surgical tenotomy have similar outcomes for chronic common extensor tendinosis, with significant symptomatic improvement occurring after 3 to 6 months.

This spectrum of disease is thought to be due, in part, to differential binding to host cells, and additional knowledge of enterovirus cell entry is essential for therapeutic development. In this issue of the JCI, Yeung et al. provide evidence of a novel EV-A71 entry factor, a host-produced tryptophan tRNA synthetase (hWARS), that facilitates entry of multiple subtypes of enteroviruses. hWARS is a cytoplasmic enzyme that is essential for translation but also upregulated and secreted during inflammatory processes. The results of this study support the notion of secreted hWARS as an unconventional virus entry factor that raises interesting questions about mechanisms by which inflammation and a tRNA synthetase facilitate viral pathogenesis.","Perlman, Stanley; Gallagher, Tom",The Journal of clinical investigation,https://doi.org/10.1172/jci124582; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30320601/,33

134318,Hypertension: current trends & future perspectives.,2021-03-18,"INTRODUCTION Liver transplantation is established as a lifesaving procedure for patients with acute and chronic liver failure, as well as certain selected malignancies. Due to a continuing organ shortage and ever-growing patient waiting lists, donation after cardiac death (DCD) is becoming more frequently utilized in order to close the gap between “supply and demand”. METHODS A retrospective analysis of DCD and subsequent liver transplantations was performed. RESULTS From May 2016 to September 2019, a total of 9 DCD liver transplantations were performed in our institution. All cases except one were primary liver transplantations. The recipients comprised 5 (56%) males and 4 (44%) females. The mean DCD donor age was 41±12 (22-57) years, with ventilation duration of 7±1 days and warm ischemia time 19±3 minutes. The average recipient age was 51±22 (4-73) years, with an average cold ischemia 3h:59m±27m and manipulation time of 23±5 minutes. Periprocedural mortality was 1 (11%). Hepatitis C recurrence was documented in 1 (11%) patient. The mean follow-up time was 19±13 (7-37) months. Until now, we have not observed any signs of ischemic cholangiopathy. CONCLUSION DCD liver transplantation allows us to enlarge the pool of potential liver grafts, thus decreasing the time spent on the liver recipient waiting list. This paper documents the first series of DCD liver transplantations in the Czech Republic.","Froněk, J; Novotný, R; Kucera, M; Mendl, J; Kocík, M; Trunecka, P; Taimr, P; Kieslichová, E; Pokorná, E; Janousek, L",Rozhledy v chirurgii : mesicnik Ceskoslovenske chirurgicke spolecnosti,https://doi.org/10.33699/pis.2020.99.9.391-396; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33242967/,33
134392,Error in Author Name.,2020-08-26,"Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) revolutionized the field of immuno-oncology and opened new avenues towards the development of novel assets to achieve durable immune control of cancer. Yet, the presence of tumor immune evasion mechanisms represents a challenge for the development of efficient treatment options. Therefore, combination therapies are taking the center of the stage in immuno-oncology. Such combination therapies should boost anti-tumor immune responses and/or target tumor immune escape mechanisms, especially those created by major players in the tumor microenvironment (TME) such as tumor-associated macrophages (TAM). Natural killer (NK) cells were recently positioned at the forefront of many immunotherapy strategies, and several new approaches are being designed to fully exploit NK cell antitumor potential. One of the most relevant NK cell-activating receptors is NKG2D, a receptor that recognizes 8 different NKG2D ligands (NKG2DL), including MICA and MICB. MICA and MICB are poorly expressed on normal cells but become upregulated on the surface of damaged, transformed or infected cells as a result of post-transcriptional or post-translational mechanisms and intracellular pathways. Their engagement of NKG2D triggers NK cell effector functions. Also, MICA/B are polymorphic and such polymorphism affects functional responses through regulation of their cell-surface expression, intracellular trafficking, shedding of soluble immunosuppressive isoforms, or the affinity of NKG2D interaction. Although immunotherapeutic approaches that target the NKG2D-NKG2DL axis are under investigation, several tumor immune escape mechanisms account for reduced cell surface expression of NKG2DL and contribute to tumor immune escape. Also, NKG2DL polymorphism determines functional NKG2D-dependent responses, thus representing an additional challenge for leveraging NKG2DL in immuno-oncology. In this review, we discuss strategies to boost MICA/B expression and/or inhibit their shedding and propose that combination strategies that target MICA/B with antibodies and strategies aimed at promoting their upregulation on tumor cells or at reprograming TAM into pro-inflammatory macrophages and remodeling of the TME, emerge as frontrunners in immuno-oncology because they may unleash the antitumor effector functions of NK cells and cytotoxic CD8 T cells (CTL). Pursuing several of these pipelines might lead to innovative modalities of immunotherapy for the treatment of a wide range of cancer patients.","Fuertes, Mercedes Beatriz; Domaica, Carolina Inés; Zwirner, Norberto Walter",Frontiers in immunology,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.713158; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34394116/,33
134499,Reply.,2020-10-01,"Air pollution is composed of particulate matter (PM) and gaseous pollutants, such as nitrogen dioxide and ozone. PM is classified according to size into coarse particles (PM10), fine particles (PM2.5) and ultrafine particles. We aim to provide an original review of the scientific evidence from epidemiological and experimental studies examining the cardiovascular effects of outdoor air pollution. Pooled epidemiological studies reported that a 10μg/m3 increase in long-term exposure to PM2.5 was associated with an 11% increase in cardiovascular mortality. Increased cardiovascular mortality was also related to long-term and short-term exposure to nitrogen dioxide. Exposure to air pollution and road traffic was associated with an increased risk of arteriosclerosis, as shown by premature aortic and coronary calcification. Short-term increases in air pollution were associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction, stroke and acute heart failure. The risk was increased even when pollutant concentrations were below European standards. Reinforcing the evidence from epidemiological studies, numerous experimental studies demonstrated that air pollution promotes a systemic vascular oxidative stress reaction. Radical oxygen species induce endothelial dysfunction, monocyte activation and some proatherogenic changes in lipoproteins, which initiate plaque formation. Furthermore, air pollution favours thrombus formation, because of an increase in coagulation factors and platelet activation. Experimental studies also indicate that some pollutants have more harmful cardiovascular effects, such as combustion-derived PM2.5 and ultrafine particles. Air pollution is a major contributor to cardiovascular diseases. Promotion of safer air quality appears to be a new challenge in cardiovascular disease prevention.","Bourdrel, Thomas; Bind, Marie-Abèle; Béjot, Yannick; Morel, Olivier; Argacha, Jean-François",Archives of cardiovascular diseases,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.acvd.2017.05.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28735838/,33

However, the success of such measures largely depends on a positive public perception of the government's ability to act decisively and the transparency of its communication. We explored public perceptions of pandemic management efforts by the Bangladeshi health sector decision-makers in this study. Methods: As this qualitative research was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, data was gathered through seven online mixed-gender focus group discussions involving 50 purposively selected clinicians and non-clinicians. Results: The study participants concurred that, from the outset, decision-makers failed to engage the right kind of experts, which resulted in poor pandemic management that included imposing lockdown in periphery areas without arranging patient transport to the center, declaring certain hospitals as COVID-19 dedicated without preparing the facilities or the staff, and engaging private hospitals in care without allowing them to test the patients for COVID-19 infection. Several participants also commented on ineffective actions on behalf of the GoB, such as imposing home quarantine instead of institutional, corruption, miscommunication, and inadequate private sector regulation. The perception of the people regarding service providers is that they lacked responsiveness in providing treatment, with some doctors misleading the public by sharing misinformation. Service providers, on the other hand, observed that decision-makers failed to provide them with proper training, personal protective equipment, and workplace security, which has resulted in a high number of deaths among medical staff. Conclusions: The Bangladeshi health sector decision-makers should learn from their mistakes to prevent further unnecessary loss of life and long-term economic downturn. They should adopt a science-based response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the short term while striving to develop a more resilient health system in the long run.","Joarder, Taufique; Khaled, Muhammad N B; Joarder, Mohammad A I",F1000Research,https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.28333.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34557291/,33

Thanks to the advancements in proteomics in recent decades, more understanding of the disease etiology, carcinogenesis, and progression has been gained, potentially deciphering the molecular characteristics of the malignancy. Areas covered: In this review, we provide an overview of the proteomic aberrations that are likely involved or drive NPC development and progression, focusing on the contributions of major EBV-encoded factors, intercommunication with environment, protein features of high metastasis and therapy resistance, and protein-protein interactions that allow NPC cells to evade immune recognition and elimination. Finally, multistep carcinogenesis and subtypes of NPC from a proteomic perspective are inquired. Expert commentary: Proteomic studies have covered various aspects involved in NPC pathogenesis, yet much remains to be uncovered. Coherent study designs, optimal conditions for obtaining high-quality data, and compelling interpretation are critical in ensuring the emergence of good science out of NPC proteomics.

METHODS We evaluated total hydroxychloroquine concentrations in serum and plasma from published literature values, frozen serum samples from a pediatric lupus trial, and simulated concentrations using a published pharmacokinetic model during pregnancy. For each source, we compared observed or predicted hydroxychloroquine concentrations to target concentrations with reported antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS The average total serum/plasma hydroxychloroquine concentrations were below the lowest SARS-CoV-2 target of 0.48 mg/L in all studies. Assuming the highest antiviral target exposure (total plasma concentration of 4.1 mg/L), all studies had approximately one-tenth the necessary concentration for in-vitro viral inhibition. Pharmacokinetic model simulations confirmed that pregnant adults receiving common dosing for rheumatic diseases did not achieve target exposures; however, the models predict that a dosage of 600 mg once a day during pregnancy would obtain the lowest median target exposure for most patients after the first dose. CONCLUSION We found that the average patient receiving treatment with hydroxychloroquine for rheumatic diseases, including children and non-pregnant/pregnant adults, are unlikely to achieve total serum or plasma concentrations shown to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in-vitro. Nevertheless, patients receiving hydroxychloroquine long-term may have tissue concentrations far exceeding that of serum/plasma. Because the therapeutic window for hydroxychloroquine in the setting of SARS-CoV-2 is unknown, well-designed clinical trials that include patients with rheumatic disease are urgently needed to characterize the efficacy, safety, and target exposures for hydroxychloroquine.","Balevic, Stephen J; Hornik, Christoph P; Green, Thomas P; Clowse, Megan E B; Gonzalez, Daniel; Maharaj, Anil R; Schanberg, Laura E; Eudy, Amanda M; Swamy, Geeta K; Hughes, Brenna L; Cohen-Wolkowiez, Michael",The Journal of rheumatology,https://doi.org/10.3899/jrheum.200493; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32393664/,33

136192,The involvement of protein denaturing activity in the effect of surfactants on skin barrier function.,2020-07-27,"BACKGROUND The COVID-19 pandemic has a great impact on the eating habits, dietary intake, and purchasing behaviours of students. At this critical moment, there is an urgent need to identify the eating habits of school students, in particular, who live in low-income countries, during the lockdown period. Therefore, the present study aims to identify the influence of COVID-19 on the eating habits, quality and quantity of food intake among school students in the Gaza Strip, Palestine. METHODS A cross-sectional study was carried out among 2398 primary and secondary school students aged 6-18 year old through an online questionnaire which included questions on socio-demographic, eating habits as well as quality and quantity of food intake. Students over the age of 11 years completed the questionnaire on their own, whereas for students under the age of 12 years, the students' guardians were instructed to answer the questionnaire on their behalf. A Wilcoxon Signed-Rank and McNemar tests were applied to perform a comparison between general dietary habits before and during COVID-19. Also, a Wilcoxon Signed Rank test was used to compare the median scores of food quality and quantity before and during the COVID-19 pandemic based on student's sociodemographic. RESULTS During the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a significant increase in eating home-cooked foods (91.6%), avoiding ordering food from outside per week (93.3%) and buying groceries online (7.7%) (p<0.001). There was a marked increase in the students reporting fear about food hygiene outside the home from 20.8% before COVID-19 to 72.9% during the COVID-19 period (p<0.001). The results showed that the median score for food quality during the COVID-19 pandemic (11.0/6.0) was significantly higher than the before COVID-19 period (10.0, IQR=8.0) (p<0.001). the results revealed that the median score for food quantity before the COVID-19 pandemic (15.0, IQR=5.0) was significantly higher than the during COVID-19 pandemic (14.0, IQR=7.0) (p<0.001). The results showed significant differences between the before and during COVID-19 period for food quality and quantity across socio-demographic variables (gender, age group, parent's highest level of education, monthly household income, and household size). During the COVID-19 pandemic, students from a high-income and a small size family had the highest score in terms of food quality and quantity among other counterparts when compared to other counterparts. CONCLUSION Eating habits have significantly altered among school students during the COVID-19 pandemic. In spite of some good healthy habits enhanced among students, the quantity and the quality of the food was compromised. Therefore, the responsible officials at the Ministry of Education must focus on enhancing school students' awareness towards increased intake of healthy food and adopting good eating habits during the spread of pandemics and health diseases to avoid its negative effects on students.","Radwan, Afnan; Radwan, Eqbal; Radwan, Walaa",Appetite,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2021.105222; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33798621/,33

136331,In-Vivo assessment of lung ultrasound features mimicking viral pneumonia using a large animal model.,2020-07-20,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES Mesh fixation in laparoscopic umbilical hernia repair is poorly studied. We compared postoperative outcomes of laparoscopic umbilical hernia repair in suture versus tack mesh fixation. METHODS Patients who underwent laparoscopic umbilical hernia repair were separated by method of mesh fixation: sutures versus primarily tacks. Medical history and follow-up data were collected through medical records. The primary outcome of this study was the recurrence rates of hernias. Postoperative major and minor complications, such as surgical site infection, small-bowel obstruction, and seroma formation, were regarded as secondary outcomes. Additionally, a telephone interview was conducted to assess postoperative pain, recovery time, and overall patient satisfaction. RESULTS Eighty-six patients were identified: 33 in the suture group and 53 in the tacks group. The number of emergent cases was increased in the tacks group (6 vs 0; P = .022). Mean follow-up time was 2.7 years for both groups. Documented postoperative follow-up was obtained in 29 (90%) suture group and 31 (58%) tacks group patients. Hernia recurrence occurred in 3 and 2 patients in the sutures and tacks groups, respectively (P was not significant). No differences were found in secondary outcomes, including subjective outcomes from telephone interviews, between groups. CONCLUSIONS There are no differences in postoperative complication rates in suture versus tack mesh fixation in laparoscopic umbilical hernia repair.","Kitamura, Riley K; Choi, Jacqueline; Lynn, Elizabeth; Divino, Celia M",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,https://doi.org/10.4293/108680813x13693422520044; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24398197/,33

Furthermore, abnormally processed RNAs can cause a variety of diseases, including obesity, diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, and cancer. Especially in cancer development, aberrant RNAs caused by deregulated RNA modifiers or regulators are related to progression. Accumulating evidence has reported that aberrant RNAs promote carcinogenesis in many cancers, including liver cancer, leukemia, melanoma, lung cancer, breast cancer, and other cancers, in which abnormal RNA processing occurs in normal cells. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the precise roles and mechanisms of disease-related RNA processing in various cancers for the development of therapeutic interventions. In this review, the underlying mechanisms of variations in the RNA life cycle and the biological impacts of RNA variations on carcinogenesis will be discussed, and therapeutic strategies for the treatment of tumor malignancies will be provided. We also discuss emerging roles of RNA regulators in hepatocellular carcinogenesis.","Yang, Hee Doo; Nam, Suk Woo",Experimental & molecular medicine,https://doi.org/10.1038/s12276-020-0429-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32346127/,33

139122,Optimize Your Patient Portal and Streamline Your Workflows.,2020-06-05,"Biological rhythms have always been considered to be disrupted in depression, with the predominant theory being that of hyperarousal. However, recent data suggest that it might be more appropriate to suggest that depressed patients are incapable of achieving and maintaining the particular level of internal homeostasis which permits them to function smoothly, to lower the level of arousal during sleep sufficiently so that quality of sleep is good, and to increase this level enough during the day so the person can function properly. Therefore, the transition from one state to another is somewhat problematic, delayed, incomplete and desynchronised. Thus, agents with a 'rhythm stabilising' effect could be beneficial in the treatment of mood disorders. Such an agent should have a beneficial effect on restoring and stabilising the rhythm of a physiological function while not pushing it towards a specific pole, or inducing the opposite pole; it should also allow response to internal and environmental stimuli and zeitgebers, and restore synchronisation of the various body rhythms while not inducing or worsening desynchronisation. Agomelatine could represent the first of a new class of 'rhythm stabilising antidepressants', but further research is necessary to support this theory.","Fountoulakis, Konstantinos N",Annals of general psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1186/1744-859x-9-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20157624/,33
139341,ISSUE HIGHLIGHTS.,2019-12-01,"INTRODUCTION Per-oral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) is an emerging treatment for achalasia. Pneumatic dilation, botulinum toxin injection, and previous myotomy increase the difficulty of subsequent Heller myotomy, but their impact on POEM remains unknown. The purpose of this study was to compare patients who had undergone prior treatment for their achalasia to those undergoing POEM as an initial therapy. METHODS AND PROCEDURES All patients undergoing POEM were entered into a prospective database from August 2012 to October 2014. Data collected included demographics, dysphagia and symptom survey scores, operative time, clips required for mucosotomy closure, perioperative complications and length of hospital stay. RESULTS Forty-five patients underwent POEM during the study period. Fifteen (30%) had undergone previous treatment (seven Botox injection, five pneumatic dilation and three Heller myotomy). Primary POEM patients were younger than those who had had prior treatment (mean age 46 ± 17 vs. 64 ± 12 years, p < 0.001), but gender, body mass index and ASA class were not significantly different. There were no conversions to Heller myotomy or perioperative complications in either group. Operative time for primary POEM was 103 ± 27 versus 102 ± 29 min following prior treatment (p = 0.84). Mucosotomy closure required a median 7 (4-16) and 8 (5-16) clips, respectively (p = 0.08). Length of stay was 1 day in each group. Median dysphagia scores decreased from 4 (0-5) to 1 (0-4) following primary POEM and 4 (0-5) to 0 (0-4) in the prior treatment group (p = 0.45) during a median follow-up of 10 months (5-17 months). All patients in each group expressed satisfaction with their procedure and would undergo the procedure again given the benefit of hindsight. CONCLUSION Per-oral endoscopic myotomy is a safe and effective treatment for achalasia which improves dysphagia and disease-specific quality of life. Previous endoscopic or laparoscopic treatment of achalasia does not affect the performance or early outcome of POEM.","Jones, Edward L; Meara, Michael P; Pittman, Matthew R; Hazey, Jeffrey W; Perry, Kyle A",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-015-4339-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26123336/,33
140299,We all breathe the same air …. and we are all mortal.,2020-05-18,"PURPOSE Long-term studies on the outcomes of bariatric surgery are still limited in the Middle East. The aim of this study is to compare the outcomes of laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) up to 5 years of follow-up. MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective analysis of patients who underwent LRYGB and LSG was performed. The primary outcome was weight loss. Postoperative complications, operative time, and hospital length of stay were secondary outcomes. RESULTS Four hundred patients underwent primary LSG and 175 patients underwent LRYGB between 2008 and 2013. Follow-up rates at 5 years were around 60%. Percent total weight loss was similar after 3, 4, and 5 years in both groups, averaging around 28%. Mean percentage of excess weight loss (%EWL) at 5 years was 72.0 ± 31.0% in the LSG group vs. 63.0 ± 21.0% in the LRYGB group (p = 0.03). Patients undergoing LRYGB had a significantly longer operative time as well as a longer hospital stay. No significant difference was found in the rates of short- and long-term complications between the two groups. However, patients undergoing LRYGB were more likely to develop small intestinal obstruction and iron-deficiency anemia. CONCLUSIONS Both LSG and LRYGB result in satisfactory weight loss within 5 years. Patients' comorbidities and potential risks must be included in the choice of the appropriate bariatric procedure. LSG appears to give durable weight loss with less risk of major long-term complications.","Dakour Aridi, Hanaa; Khazen, Georges; Safadi, Bassem Y",Obesity surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-017-2849-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28776151/,33

Recent trials demonstrated the effectiveness of endovascular treatment of acute ischemic stroke due to intracranial occlusions; however, most studies excluded patients with TOs. METHODS Retrospective review of prospectively collected thrombectomy databases from 3 stroke centers between 2011 and 2015. Consecutive patients with tandem extracranial steno-occlusive carotid disease and intracranial occlusions who underwent emergent thrombectomy were selected. Angiographic and clinical outcomes were analyzed; baseline and procedural variables were included in univariate and multivariate analyses to define the independent predictors of good outcomes (90-day modified Rankin Scale ≤2). RESULTS A total of 100 patients met the study inclusion criteria. The mean age was 64.4 ± 12.5, baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) 17.6 ± 5.0, time from last known well to puncture 7.3 ± 5.8 h, and Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) 7.5 ± 1.6. Forty percent received intravenous tissue plasminogen activator. Intracranial occlusion sites included: internal carotid artery thrombus, 31%; middle cerebral artery (MCA)-M1, 53%; MCA-M2, 10%; and anterior cerebral artery, 6%. Good outcome was achieved in 42% and successful reperfusion modified thrombolysis in cerebral infarction (mTICI ≥2B) in 88% of the cases, including complete (mTICI 3) reperfusion in 40%. Severe parenchymal hematoma (PH)-2 occurred in 6% of the patients and 90-day mortality was 20%. In the multivariate analysis, younger age (OR 0.93; 95% CI 0.88-0.98; p = 0.004), lower baseline NIHSS (OR 0.84; 95% CI 0.74-0.94; p = 0.003), higher ASPECTS (OR 1.50; 95% CI 1.02-2.19; p = 0.038), and mTICI 3 reperfusion (OR 3.56; 95% CI 1.18-10.76; p = 0.024) were independent predictors of good outcome at 90 days.

Access to subspecialty care for HD is restricted by disability from the disease, lack of trained providers, and barriers to care for disadvantaged and rural populations. Program Description: Since 1999, the University of Virginia HD clinic has used telemedicine to provide clinical services, consultation, and staff training. Initially, encounters were scheduled with the neurologist on a case-by-case basis at outlying rural clinics and community hospitals. Since 2015, telemedicine visits have been conducted by the entire interdisciplinary HD team and access has been extended to homes and long-term care facilities. This infrastructure was used to conduct a virtual clinic 2 days after initiation of coronavirus disease (COVID) mitigation. The clinic has continued to provide subspecialty and interdisciplinary care through telemedicine while clinic access has been restricted. A total of 69 individuals have been seen in 127 telemedicine visits, 56 of which were conducted by the interdisciplinary team. Conclusions: Telemedicine can provide high-quality subspecialty neurological and interdisciplinary care for HD that offers continuity across a wide range of care settings, and can overcome both anticipated and unanticipated barriers to access.","Harrison, Madaline B; Morrissey, Dana",Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association,https://doi.org/10.1089/tmj.2020.0316; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33021901/,33

Moreover, the lack of clinical evidence has led to important dissimilarities in the recommendations coming from different scientific societies. Finally, etiopathogenic mechanisms leading to hyponatremia in the critical care patient are complex and often combined, and an intensive analysis is clearly needed.

The fourth CoV genus, Deltacoronavirus, evolutionarily related to the Gammacoronavirus, has just been defined recently. In the current study, we demonstrate that porcine aminopeptidase N (pAPN) acts as a cross-genus CoV functional receptor for both enteropathogenic porcine deltacoronovirus (PDCoV) and alphacoronovirus (AlphaCoV) (transmissible gastroenteritis virus [TGEV]) based upon three lines of evidence. First, the soluble S1 protein of PDCoV bound to the surface of target porcine cell lines known to express pAPN as efficiently as TGEV-S1, which could be blocked by soluble pAPN pretreatment. Second, both PDCoV-S1 and TGEV-S1 physically recognized and interacted with pAPN by coimmunoprecipitation in pAPN cDNA-transfected cells and by dot blot hybridization assay. Finally, exogenous expression of pAPN in refractory cells conferred susceptibility to PDCoV-S1 binding and to PDCoV entry and productive infection. PDCoV-S1 appeared to have a lower pAPN-binding affinity and likely consequent lower infection efficiency in pAPN-expressing refractory cells than TGEV-S1, suggesting that there may be differences between these two viruses in the virus-binding regions in pAPN. This study paves the way for dissecting the molecular mechanisms of PDCoV-host interactions and pathogenesis as well as facilitates future vaccine development and intervention strategies against PDCoV infection.IMPORTANCE The emergence of new human and animal coronaviruses is believed to have occurred through interspecies transmission that is mainly mediated by a species-specific receptor of the host. Among the four genera of the Coronavirinae, a couple of functional receptors for the representative members in the genera Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus have been identified, whereas receptors for Gammacoronavirus and Deltacoronavirus, which are believed to originate from birds, are still unknown. Porcine coronaviruses, including the newly discovered porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) associated with diarrhea in newborn piglets, have posed a serious threat to the pork industry in Asia and North America. Here, we report that PDCoV employs the alphacoronavirus TGEV functional receptor porcine aminopeptidase N (pAPN) for cellular entry, demonstrating the usage of pAPN as a cross-genus CoV functional receptor. The identification of the PDCoV receptor provides another example of the expanded host range of CoV and paves the way for further investigation of PDCoV-host interaction and pathogenesis.","Wang, Bin; Liu, Yan; Ji, Chun-Miao; Yang, Yong-Le; Liang, Qi-Zhang; Zhao, Pengwei; Xu, Ling-Dong; Lei, Xi-Mei; Luo, Wen-Ting; Qin, Pan; Zhou, Jiyong; Huang, Yao-Wei",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00318-18; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29618640/,33
141755,"Microbial otitis media: recent advancements in treatment, current challenges and opportunities.",2018,"Immune protection of the body cavities depends on the swift activation of innate and adaptive immune responses in nonclassical secondary lymphoid organs known as fat-associated lymphoid clusters (FALCs). Compared with classical secondary lymphoid organs such as lymph nodes and Peyer's patches, FALCs develop along distinct differentiation trajectories and display a reduced structural complexity. Although it is well established that fibroblastic reticular cells (FRCs) are an integral component of the immune-stimulating infrastructure of classical secondary lymphoid organs, the role of FRCs in FALC-dependent peritoneal immunity remains unclear. Using FRC-specific gene targeting, we found that FRCs play an essential role in FALC-driven immune responses. Specifically, we report that initiation of peritoneal immunity was governed through FRC activation in a myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MYD88)-dependent manner. FRC-specific ablation of MYD88 blocked recruitment of inflammatory monocytes into FALCs and subsequent CD4+ T cell-dependent B-cell activation and IgG class switching. Moreover, containment of Salmonella infection was compromised in mice lacking MYD88 expression in FRCs, indicating that FRCs in FALCs function as an initial checkpoint in the orchestration of protective immune responses in the peritoneal cavity.","Perez-Shibayama, Christian; Gil-Cruz, Cristina; Cheng, Hung-Wei; Onder, Lucas; Printz, Andrea; Mörbe, Urs; Novkovic, Mario; Li, Conglei; Lopez-Macias, Constantino; Buechler, Matthew B; Turley, Shannon J; Mack, Matthias; Soneson, Charlotte; Robinson, Mark D; Scandella, Elke; Gommerman, Jennifer; Ludewig, Burkhard",Science immunology,https://doi.org/10.1126/sciimmunol.aar4539; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30097537/,33

OBJECTIVES We aimed to determine whether dress style (professional white coat or formal, semiformal or casual attire) affects confidence in the physician by patients (children, teenagers, adults) with dermatology complaints consulting in the hospital or private practice. METHODS Design. Descriptive prospective cross sectional study carried out from July 1, 2008 to July 1, 2009. Setting. Outpatients in the department of dermatology of a French tertiary care hospital, and two dermatological private consulting rooms. Participants and design. Consulting patients were ≥ 7 years and classified as children 7-11 years old, accompanying parents, teenagers (12-17 years), and adults ≥ 18 years consulting alone. Subjects viewed two iconographic boards containing 4 photographs in a random order of a male physician on 1 board and a female physician on the other board in 4 different dress styles: professional (white coat and stethoscope), formal (shirt and tie for men), semiformal, and casual (T-shirt, jeans). Subjects then completed a questionnaire asking them to rate, on a scale of 0-10, their confidence in the physicians portrayed and answered whether they considered physician dress important. Main outcomes and measures. The main outcome was subjects' ranking of photos of physicians by dress style, according to the confidence they felt. For children 7-11 years old, we considered the frequency of the chosen dress style. The secondary outcome was whether physician dress was important to patients. RESULTS We included 329 patients. Children at the hospital most frequently chose the photo of the physician, both male (62%) and female (64%), with the white coat. Teenagers' choices were professional dress, then semiformal, formal, and casual attire. Accompanying adults and adults consulting alone had the same ranking.

141864,"Reimagining What We Measure in Atherosclerosis-a ""Phenotype Stack"".",2020-04-24,"Influenza A virus (IAV) emerges as a highly contagious pathogen, causing acute respiratory illnesses in human beings and animals and frequently giving rise to epidemic outbreaks. Evasion of IAV from host immunity facilitates viral replication and spread, which can be initiated through various mechanisms, including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activation. However, how EGFR mediates the suppression of antiviral systems remains unclear. Here, we examined host innate immune responses and their relevant signaling to EGFR upon IAV infection. IAV was found to induce the phosphorylation of EGFR and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) at an early stage of infection. Inhibition of EGFR or ERK suppressed the viral replication but increased the expression of type I and type III interferons (IFNs) and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), supporting that IAV escapes from antiviral innate immunity by activating the EGFR/ERK signaling. Meanwhile, IAV infection also induced the activation of Src homology region 2-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase 2 (SHP2). Pharmacological inhibition or siRNA-based silencing of SHP2 enhanced the IFN-dependent antiviral activity and reduced virion production. Furthermore, knockdown of SHP2 attenuated the EGFR-mediated ERK phosphorylation triggered by viral infection or EGF stimulation. Conversely, ectopic expression of constitutively active SHP2 remarkably promoted ERK activation and viral replication, concomitant with diminished immune function. Altogether, the results indicate that SHP2 is crucial for IAV-induced activation of the EGFR/ERK pathway to suppress host antiviral responses.IMPORTANCEViral immune evasion is the most important strategy whereby viruses evolve for their survival. This work shows that influenza A virus (IAV) suppressed the antiviral innate immunity through downregulation of IFNs and ISGs by activating the EGFR/ERK signaling. Meanwhile, IAV also induced the activation of protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP2, which was found to be responsible for modulating the EGFR-mediated ERK activity and subsequent antiviral effectiveness both in vitro and in vivo The results suggest that SHP2 is a key signal transducer between EGFR and ERK and plays a crucial role in suppressing host innate immunity during IAV infection. The finding enhances our understanding of influenza immune evasion and provides a new therapeutic approach to viral infection.","Wang, Qingsen; Pan, Wenliang; Wang, Song; Pan, Chen; Ning, Hongya; Huang, Shile; Chiu, Shih-Hsin; Chen, Ji-Long",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02001-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33361428/,33

Bioconjugate affinity for the gastrin releasing peptide receptor (GRPR) as determined against [(125)I-Tyr(4)]BBN was high (IC50 values in the lower nanomolar range). Radioligands poorly internalized in PC-3 cells at 37 °C. Radiopeptides remained >60% intact 5 min after entering the bloodstream of healthy mice. After injection in SCID mice bearing human PC-3 xenografts all analogues showed high tumor uptake and rapid background clearance via the kidneys into urine. Interestingly, pancreatic uptake, albeit GRPR-specific, declined rapidly with time.

The success of a national population-based genome program, like the Qatar Genome Program (QGP), depends on the willingness of citizens to donate samples and take up genomic testing services. This study explores public attitudes of the Qatari population toward genetic testing and toward participating in the QGP. A representative sample of 837 adult Qataris was surveyed in May 2016. Approximately 71% of respondents surveyed reported that they were willing to participate in the activities of the QGP. Willingness to participate was significantly associated with basic literacy in genetics, a family history of genetic diseases, and previous experience with genetic testing through premarital screening. Respondents cited the desire to know more about their health status as the principle motivation for participating, while lack of time and information were reported as the most important barriers. With QGP plans to ramp up the scale of its national operation toward more integration into clinical care settings, it is critical to understand public attitudes and their determinants. The results demonstrate public support but also identify the need for more education and individual counseling that not only provide information on the process, challenges, and benefits of genomic testing, but that also address concerns about information security.","Abdul Rahim, Hanan F; Ismail, Said I; Hassan, Amel; Fadl, Tasnim; Khaled, Salma M; Shockley, Bethany; Nasrallah, Catherine; Qutteina, Yara; Elmaghraby, Engi; Yasin, Heba; Darwish, Dima; Fakhro, Khalid A; Badji, Radja; Al-Muftah, Wadha; Afifi, Nahla; Althani, Asmaa",Journal of human genetics,https://doi.org/10.1038/s10038-020-0806-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32724056/,33

Major points include that neuropathology studies have not answered the central issue of whether the virus enters central nervous system neurons, astrocytes or microglia, and the brain vascular cell types that express virus have not yet been identified. Currently, there is no clear evidence for human neuronal or astrocyte expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the major receptor for viral entry, but ACE2 expression may be activated by inflammation, and a comparison of healthy and infected brains is important. In contrast to the 1918 influenza pandemic and avian flu, reports of encephalopathy in COVID-19 have been slow to emerge, and there are so far no documented reports of parkinsonism apart from a single case report. We recommend consensus guidelines for the clinical treatment of Parkinson's patients with COVID-19. While a role for the virus in causing or exacerbating Parkinson's disease appears unlikely at this time, aggravation of specific motor and non-motor symptoms has been reported, and it will be important to monitor subjects after recovery, particularly for those with persisting hyposmia.","Sulzer, David; Antonini, Angelo; Leta, Valentina; Nordvig, Anna; Smeyne, Richard J; Goldman, James E; Al-Dalahmah, Osama; Zecca, Luigi; Sette, Alessandro; Bubacco, Luigi; Meucci, Olimpia; Moro, Elena; Harms, Ashley S; Xu, Yaqian; Fahn, Stanley; Ray Chaudhuri, K",NPJ Parkinson's disease,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41531-020-00123-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33574316/,33

MATERIALS AND METHODS Six patients (five males, one female, age range 58-80, mean 69 years), with small (mean diameter 16.8 mm) HCC poorly visible at US underwent percutaneous microwave ablation under US/CBCT fusion guidance. During general anesthesia with apnea control, a contrast- enhanced CBCT was acquired with an active tracker. Subsequently, real time US images were fused with CBCT images, and treatment performed under fusion imaging guidance. Feasibility of fusion imaging and percutaneous ablation were assessed, correct targeting (distance from center of tumor and center of ablation area <5 mm) and one-month primary technical efficacy were evaluated. Major and minor complications as well as overall procedural time were recorded. RESULTS US/CBCT fusion was feasible in all cases, allowing for completion of the treatment as previously planned (technical success 100%). Correct targeting was achieved in 4/6 cases (66%), while in two cases, center of tumor and center of ablated area were respectively 7 and 8 mm distant. At 1 month CT scan, all tumors were completely ablated (primary technical efficacy 100%). No major or minor complications occurred. Mean overall procedure time was 127 min. CONCLUSIONS US/CBCT fusion is a feasible technique for liver ablation, and might represent a useful tool to increase the correct targeting of poorly US-visible HCC nodules in the angio suite.","Monfardini, Lorenzo; Orsi, Franco; Caserta, Rosalba; Sallemi, Claudio; Della Vigna, Paolo; Bonomo, Guido; Varano, Gianluca; Solbiati, Luigi; Mauri, Giovanni","International journal of hyperthermia : the official journal of European Society for Hyperthermic Oncology, North American Hyperthermia Group",https://doi.org/10.1080/02656736.2018.1509237; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30204007/,33
143143,Myriad Genetics: In the eye of the policy storm.,2010,"BACKGROUND Brain injury progression after severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) is associated with worsening cerebral inflammation but it is unknown how a concomitant bone fracture (BF) affects this progression. Enoxaparin (ENX) decreases penumbral leukocyte mobilization after TBI and improves neurologic recovery. We hypothesized that a concomitant BF worsens learning/memory recovery weeks after TBI and that ENX improves this recovery. METHODS CD1 male mice underwent controlled cortical impact or sham craniotomy with or without tibial fracture, receiving either daily ENX (0.8 mg/kg) or saline for 14 days after injury. Randomization defined four groups (Sham, TBI only, TBI + Fx, TBI + Fx + ENX, n = 5/each). Body weight loss and neurologic recovery (Garcia Neurologic Test, max score = 18) were assessed each day. Mouse learning (swimming time [s] and total distance [m] to reach the submerged platform Days 14 to 17 after TBI) and memory (swimming time [s] in platform quadrant after platform removed [probe]) was assessed by the Morris water maze. Ly-6G (cerebral neutrophil sequestration) and glial fibrillary acidic protein were evaluated by immunohistochemistry in brain tissue post mortem. Analysis of variance with Tukey's post hoc test determined significance (p < 0.05). RESULTS A concurrent BF worsened Garcia Neurologic Test scores post-TBI Days 2 to 4 (p < 0.01) as compared with TBI only, and ENX reversed this worsening on Day 4 (p < 0.01). Learning was significantly slower (greater swimming time and distance) in TBI + Fx versus TBI only on Day 17 (p < 0.01). This was despite similar swimming velocities in both groups, indicating intact extremity motor function. Memory was similar in isolated TBI and Sham which was significantly better than in TBI + Fx animals (p < 0.05). Glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive cells in penumbral cortex were most prevalent in TBI + Fx animals, significantly greater than in Sham (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION A long BF accompanying TBI worsens early neurologic recovery and subsequent learning/memory. Enoxaparin may partially counter this and improve neurologic recovery.","Suto, Yujin; Nagata, Katsuhiro; Ahmed, Syed M; Jacovides, Christina; Browne, Kevin D; Cognetti, John; Weber, Maura T; Johnson, Victoria E; Leone, Ryan; Kaplan, Lewis J; Smith, Douglas H; Pascual, Jose L",The journal of trauma and acute care surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/ta.0000000000001957; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29787539/,33

There is equipoise regarding the optimal dose of anticoagulant intervention in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and consequently, immediate answers from high-quality randomized trials are needed. METHODS The World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform was searched on June 17, 2020 for randomized controlled trials comparing increased dose to standard dose anticoagulant interventions in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Two authors independently screened the full records for eligibility and extracted data in duplicate. RESULTS A total of 20 trials were included in the review. All trials are open-label, 5 trials use an adaptive design, 1 trial uses a factorial design, 2 trials combine multi-arm parallel group and factorial designs in flexible platform trials, and at least 15 trials have multiple study sites. With individual target sample sizes ranging from 30 to 3,000 participants, the pooled sample size of all included trials is 12,568 participants. Two trials include only ICU patients, and 10 trials base patient eligibility on elevated D-dimer levels. Therapeutic intensity anticoagulation is evaluated in 14 trials. All-cause mortality is part of the primary outcome in 14 trials. DISCUSSION Several trials evaluate different dose regimens of anticoagulant interventions in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Since these trials compete for sites and study participants, a collaborative effort is needed to complete trials faster, conduct pooled analyses and bring effective interventions to patients more quickly.","Tritschler, Tobias; Mathieu, Marie-Eve; Skeith, Leslie; Rodger, Marc; Middeldorp, Saskia; Brighton, Timothy; Sandset, Per Morten; Kahn, Susan R; Angus, Derek C; Blondon, Marc; Bonten, Marc J; Cattaneo, Marco; Cushman, Mary; Derde, Lennie P G; DeSancho, Maria T; Diehl, Jean-Luc; Goligher, Ewan; Jilma, Bernd; Jüni, Peter; Lawler, Patrick R; Marietta, Marco; Marshall, John C; McArthur, Colin; Miranda, Carlos Henrique; Mirault, Tristan; Morici, Nuccia; Perepu, Usha; Schörgenhofer, Christian; Sholzberg, Michelle; Spyropoulos, Alex C; Webb, Steve A; Zarychanski, Ryan; Zuily, Stéphane; Le Gal, Grégoire",Journal of thrombosis and haemostasis : JTH,https://doi.org/10.1111/jth.15094; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32888372/,33

144763,Certifying Guinea worm eradication: current challenges.,2020-12-05,"BACKGROUND Hemoptysis is a frequent and sometimes fatal complication of non-tuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) lung disease. The risk factors for hemoptysis are not well understood. In the current study, potential risk factors for hemoptysis were investigated in patients with Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) lung disease, which is the most common NTM in Japan. METHODS Medical records from the Kinki-Chuo Chest Medical Center were reviewed. Consecutive patients with MAC lung disease diagnosed in 2014 and followed up for more than 1 year in the hospital were included in the study. Hemoptysis was confirmed between 2014 and 2016. The characteristics of patients with hemoptysis and non-hemoptysis at the time of the initial diagnosis of MAC lung disease were obtained from the medical records, and the two groups were compared. The radiological findings assessed included nodules, infiltration shadows, cavities, and bronchiectasis. Each was classified and scored individually in six lung fields, and these data were used to generate radiological scores. RESULTS The study included 82 patients with MAC lung disease, 18 with hemoptysis and 64 without. Higher total radiological severity score at the time of the initial diagnosis of MAC was associated with an increased risk of hemoptysis. Among the radiological scores, infiltration and cavities were marginally associated with the risk of hemoptysis. CONCLUSIONS The radiological severity score at the time of initial diagnosis of MAC lung disease was associated with hemoptysis.","Minomo, Shojiro; Kobayashi, Takehiko; Katayama, Kanako; Ryuge, Misaki; Kagawa, Tomoko; Tsuyuguchi, Kazunari; Matsui, Hideo; Suzuki, Katsuhiro",Respiratory investigation,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.resinv.2020.09.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33069662/,33

MATERIALS AND METHODS The databases of three institutions were retrospectively reviewed. Patients who underwent endovascular treatment of PICA aneurysms using a reconstructive technique where the LVIS Jr stent was totally or partially deployed into the PICA were included in the analysis. Clinical presentation, aneurysm and PICA sizes, procedural complications, and clinical and angiographic follow-up information was recorded and analyzed. RESULTS Seven patients who underwent endovascular treatment of PICA aneurysms with an LVIS Jr stent were identified. Four aneurysms were treated in the acute phase of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). There were no symptomatic complications. One patient had spasm distal to the stent as a result of mechanical straightening of the vessel. One patient was treated in the acute phase of SAH and required a gycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor after the stent was implanted. This patient needed to be re-treated to complete embolization. All patients had good clinical outcomes (Glasgow Outcome Scale 5). No in-stent stenosis or occlusion was seen on short-term angiographic follow-up and the aneurysms were occluded. CONCLUSIONS This small series suggests that the use of a reconstructive technique with the LVIS Jr stent for the treatment of PICA aneurysms is feasible, safe and effective in the short term.","Samaniego, Edgar A; Abdo, German; Hanel, Ricardo A; Lima, Andrey; Ortega-Gutierrez, Santiago; Dabus, Guilherme",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2015-012070; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26534868/,33

Here, we present a high-throughput epitope identification system that combines capture of T cell-secreted cytokines by barcoded antigen-presenting cells (APCs), cell sorting, and next-generation sequencing to identify class I- and class II-restricted epitopes starting from highly complex peptide-encoding oligonucleotide pools. We engineered APCs to express anti-cytokine antibodies, a library of DNA-encoded peptides, and multiple HLA class I or II molecules. We demonstrate that these engineered APCs link T cell activation-dependent cytokines with the DNA that encodes the presented peptide. We validated this technology by showing that we could select known targets of viral epitope-, neoepitope-, and autoimmune epitope-specific TCRs, starting from mixtures of peptide-encoding oligonucleotides. Then, starting from 10 TCRβ sequences that are found commonly in humans but lack known targets, we identified seven CD8+ or CD4+ TCR-targeted epitopes encoded by the human cytomegalovirus (CMV) genome. These included known epitopes, as well as a class I and a class II CMV epitope that have not been previously described. Thus, our cytokine capture-based assay makes use of a signal secreted by both CD8+ and CD4+ T cells and allows pooled screening of thousands of encoded peptides to enable epitope discovery for orphan TCRs. Our technology may enable identification of HLA-epitope-TCR complexes relevant to disease control, etiology, or treatment.","Lee, Mark N; Meyerson, Matthew",Science immunology,https://doi.org/10.1126/sciimmunol.abf4001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33483338/,33

146078,Modulation of soleus corticospinal excitability during Achilles tendon vibration.,2015,"Background Indiscriminate disposal of hospital wastes including mercury/amalgam wastes pose a serious threat to life and environment. There is a growing concern about biomedical waste (BMW) management among health care workers, however there are limited reports on BMW management by dental personnel in developing countries. Objectives This study investigated the level of knowledge of BMW, observance of proper mercury hygiene and BMW management practice among public dental personnel in Lagos State, Nigeria. Methods A cross-sectional study regarding BMW management across public hospitals in Lagos State, Nigeria was conducted following institutional ethics committee approval. A self-administered questionnaire was utilized to obtain data from different facilities selected by purposive and simple random sampling techniques as applicable. The questionnaires were distributed among 437 respondents by convenience sampling. The resulting data were statistically tested using Chi-square and G-test with p-value < 0.05 indicating significant level. Results Amongst 437 respondents, majority were females (62.5%) and the highest proportion fell within the age range of 25-34 years (44.4%). Only 17.2% of the respondents had good knowledge of BMW management/legislation and 4.1% had good BMW practice. Less than half (49.4%) of respondents disposed mercury-contaminated materials inside the trash and majority (92.2%) did not observe proper mercury hygiene. Significantly better mercury hygiene practices were observed in secondary facilities (p=0.040). Conclusion A minor proportion of public dental personnel had good knowledge and practice of proper mercury hygiene and BMW management. This shows there is an urgent need for training of health personnel on proper BMW handling and disposal in developing countries like Nigeria.","Makanjuola, John Oluwatosin; Ekowmenhenhen, Uyi Idah; Enone, Lillian Lami; Umesi, Donna Chioma; Ogundana, Oladunni Mojirayo; Arotiba, Godwin Toyin",African health sciences,https://doi.org/10.4314/ahs.v21i1.56; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34394328/,33

OBJECTIVE The impact of a Braun enteroenterostomy on delayed gastric emptying, used in reconstruction following classic pancreaticoduodenectomy, was assessed. PATIENTS Forty-four consecutive patients undergoing non-pylorus preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy from 2009 to 2011 by a single surgeon were included in this study. INTERVENTIONS The first 20 patients had a standard antecolic gastroenterostomy and the subsequent 24 had the addition of a Braun enteroenterostomy. RESULTS Patient characteristics, the extent of surgery, surgical findings and tumor characteristics were similar between the two groups. The delayed gastric emptying rate in the Braun enteroenterostomy (1/24, 4.2%) was significantly lower (P=0.008) than the standard reconstruction group (7/20, 35.0%). In the standard group, 6 of 7 cases (85.7%) of delayed gastric emptying were class C in nature. After exclusion of 8 total pancreatectomy patients, the pancreatic fistula rate in the Braun enteroenterostomy group (4/19, 21.1%) was similar (0.706) to the standard reconstruction group (5/17, 29.4%) as was the median length of hospital stay (10 days vs. 15 days; P=0.291). Braun enteroenterostomy technique was the only significant independent factor associated with reduced delayed gastric emptying with an odds ratio of 0.08 (95% confidence interval: 0.01-0.73; P=0.025). CONCLUSION The use of Braun enteroenterostomy following non-pylorus preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy appears to result in a significant reduction in delayed gastric emptying.","Nikfarjam, Mehrdad; Houli, Nezor; Tufail, Farrukh; Weinberg, Laurence; Muralidharan, Vijayaragavan; Christophi, Christopher",JOP : Journal of the pancreas,https://doi.org/10.6092/1590-8577/800; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22964955/,33

Here, we present large-scale single-cell transcriptomic analysis of viral antigen-reactive CD4+ T cells from 32 COVID-19 patients. In patients with severe disease compared to mild disease, we found increased proportions of cytotoxic follicular helper (TFH) cells and cytotoxic T helper cells (CD4-CTLs) responding to SARS-CoV-2, and reduced proportion of SARS-CoV-2 reactive regulatory T cells. Importantly, the CD4-CTLs were highly enriched for the expression of transcripts encoding chemokines that are involved in the recruitment of myeloid cells and dendritic cells to the sites of viral infection. Polyfunctional T helper (TH)1 cells and TH17 cell subsets were underrepresented in the repertoire of SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD4+ T cells compared to influenza-reactive CD4+ T cells. Together, our analyses provide so far unprecedented insights into the gene expression patterns of SARS-CoV-2 reactive CD4+ T cells in distinct disease severities.

We perform intraoperative ""hybrid"" stent placement to deliver larger, stronger stents. Hybrid stent placement is well described for pulmonary arterial stenosis (PAS). The PAS data demonstrate that smaller stents are associated with rapid in-stent restenosis. Data from PVS in adults demonstrate superior outcomes with larger stents. Hybrid stent placement requires a strong collaborative effort between congenital heart surgeons and interventional cardiologists.","Shell, Kathryn J; Ebeid, Makram R; Salazar, Jorge D; Dodge-Khatami, Ali; Batlivala, Sarosh P",World journal for pediatric & congenital heart surgery,https://doi.org/10.1177/2150135114559405; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25870348/,33

METHODS Surface EMG of five bilaterally recorded ankle muscles was conducted in 24 patients with haemophilia (PwH, age: 42 [11] years, mean [SD], 22 A, 2 B, 21 severe, 3 moderate) with median (quartiles) WFH orthopaedic joint score of 30 (20/39) points and 24 non-haemophilic controls (Con, age: 42 [12]). Force plate (IBS) signals were captured simultaneously during bipedal stance with eyes open. Load proportion of the left and right sides as well as heel and forefoot were calculated via four independent pressure transducers. Overall, weight distribution (WD) indices are reported with higher results representing a poorer WD. RESULTS Analyses of WD showed large differences between groups (PwH: 10.2 [5.4], Con: 5.2 [2.9], P < 0.001, d = 1.15). After clustering PwH, large effects (P = 0.02, ηp 2 > 0.16) were found for amplitude ratios of the lateral gastrocnemius (LG) muscle. In PwH, the degree of joint alteration of the right lower limb was associated with load proportion of the left side (ρ > 0.64, P = 0.001). CONCLUSION Patients with greater dysbalance showed higher forefoot loads and appeared to compensate their altered joint situations with considerably higher amplitude ratios of LG. Further studies should investigate whether therapeutic interventions could alter postural alignment and muscle activation and how these can influence patients' joint function and symptoms.","Kurz, Eduard; Herbsleb, Marco; Gabriel, Holger H W; Hilberg, Thomas",Haemophilia : the official journal of the World Federation of Hemophilia,https://doi.org/10.1111/hae.13650; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30520541/,33

The aim of this study was to explore the long-term impacts of anisometropic amblyopia. METHODS A phenomenological qualitative investigation was carried out on a sample of adults with anisometropic amblyopia. Subjects participated in in-depth telephone interviews and described how their eye condition affected different aspects of their life. The interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed iteratively to form emergent themes. RESULTS Sixteen participants took part in the study (median age: 21.5 years; range: 18-36 years; 11 male and 5 female). Six themes emerged: (1) symptoms experienced by participants, (2) concerns and apprehensions, (3) emotional impacts, (4) activity limitations, (5) hassle and inconveniences and (6) economic and career implications. Symptoms reported by participants ranged from glare to difficulty concentrating. They were extremely concerned about the safety of their better eye and lived with several doubts and anxieties. Negative emotions such as grief and disappointment due to eye care negligence in childhood was apparent. Guilt and regretful feelings were present in those who did not comply with past treatment. Participants expressed several limitations in driving, reading, mobility (e.g., using stairs) and tasks requiring high resolution. Reported inconveniences associated with coping with their eye condition included having to travel across the country in search of a cure for their amblyopia. Economic impacts ranged from costs associated with accessing eye care and management to career choices being compromised. CONCLUSION Lived experiences of people with anisometropic amblyopia indicate that the QoL impacts are multifaceted and substantial, even in the absence of strabismus. The results have the potential to influence patient-practitioner relationship by opening newer horizons to communication and care while managing adult amblyopes.","Kumaran, Sheela Evangeline; Rakshit, Archayeeta; Hussaindeen, Jameel Rizwana; Khadka, Jyoti; Pesudovs, Konrad",Ophthalmic & physiological optics : the journal of the British College of Ophthalmic Opticians,https://doi.org/10.1111/opo.12864; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34382230/,33

Molecular components of these pathogens are recognized by pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) expressed by various cells in the airway, which leads to initiation of inflammatory processes. Expression levels of PRRs in airway inflammatory cells are expected to affect susceptibility to COPD exacerbation. AIMS This prospective observational study was conducted to detect any association between exacerbation and PRR expression. METHODS Thirty-one male COPD patients were recruited. At baseline, clinical history, lung function measurements, peripheral blood samples and induced sputum were obtained. Using sputum samples, we performed gene expression analysis of TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, NOD1, NOD2, RIG-I and MDA-5 by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction in addition to quantitative bacterial culture. COPD exacerbations were assessed based on Anthonisen's criteria using symptom diaries for the following 1-year period. RESULTS During 1-year follow-up period, 13 patients experienced at least one exacerbation, but 18 patients did not. Those with exacerbations tended to be more severe COPD and showed larger neutrophil fraction in their induced sputum. Among PRRs, only TLR3 gene expression was increased in COPD patients with exacerbation compared with those without exacerbations. Multivariate logistic regression analysis including neutrophil fraction and TLR3 gene expression as predictor variables demonstrated that only an increase of neutrophil fraction, but not TLR3 gene expression, was a significant predictor for COPD exacerbation. CONCLUSION TLR3 expression in inflammatory cells might affect the susceptibility to COPD exacerbation.","Kinose, Daisuke; Ogawa, Emiko; Kudo, Megumi; Marumo, Satoshi; Kiyokawa, Hirofumi; Hoshino, Yuma; Hirai, Toyohiro; Chin, Kazuo; Muro, Shigeo; Mishima, Michiaki",The clinical respiratory journal,https://doi.org/10.1111/crj.12171; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24902764/,33

Manual oversewing for reinforcement of the duodenal stump is not applicable when free longitudinal margin is short and has technical difficulties in laparoscopic surgery. This trial evaluated the safety and feasibility of using a linear stapler with bioabsorbable polyglycolic acid (PGA) sheet for duodenal stump closure and reinforcement in gastric cancer surgery. METHODS This multi-institutional, prospective phase II trial included gastric cancer patients who were scheduled to undergo distal or total gastrectomy with R-Y reconstruction. In all cases, duodenum was transected using a linear stapler with PGA sheet. The primary endpoint was the incidence of postoperative DSF. Sample size was set at 100 patients considering an expected value of 3% and threshold value of 8% with one-sided testing at a 10% significance level. RESULTS Between June 2014 and June 2015, a total of 100 patients were registered in this trial. Postoperative DSF was observed in two cases (2.0%, 90% CI 0.4-6.2%) which was developed on postoperative days 13 and 20. Intraoperative bleeding at the duodenal stump staple line was observed in one case but was easily controlled without additional suturing. Postoperative bleeding was not observed in any of the cases. CONCLUSION This study suggested that the use of PGA sheet as a reinforcement material for closure of the duodenal stump during gastrectomy for gastric cancer is both safe and feasible.

Aims Potentially, the gathering of large numbers of people and animals within a specified geographical area during the annual festival has important implications for public safety, health security and legacy. Thus, the Ministry of Health through the Global Center for Mass Gathering Medicine, Saudi Arabia, conducted a health risk assessment for the 2017 Camel Festival. This paper summarizes the risk assessment process and highlights the findings and recommendations of the risk assessment. Methods Using an all-hazard approach, the Jeddah tool (derived from the World Health Organization Eastern Mediterranean Regional Office's health emergency risk assessment tool) was adapted to conduct the risk assessment. The tool stipulates that risk is directly proportional to the product of hazard magnitude and vulnerability and inversely related to capacity. Results External causes of morbidity and mortality, such as fires and road traffic accidents, were categorized as high risk hazards. In contrast, brucellosis, foodborne diseases and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome were ranked moderate risk hazards. Rift Valley fever was ranked low risk hazard. Conclusions The camel festival risk assessment highlights the need for an all-hazard approach to mass gatherings risk assessment. There is a need for multi-sectorial collaboration to strengthen the existing capacity, including disease surveillance.","Bieh, Kingsley; ElGanainy, Ahmed; Yezli, Saber; Malik, Mamunur; Jokhdar, Hani Aziz; Asiri, Abdullah; Alotaibi, Badriah",Eastern Mediterranean health journal = La revue de sante de la Mediterranee orientale = al-Majallah al-sihhiyah li-sharq al-mutawassit,https://doi.org/10.26719/emhj.18.071; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31625590/,33

OBJECTIVES To document respiratory viruses in children with fever presenting at a general practice out-of-hours service (OHS), evaluate presenting symptoms in febrile children with a virus infection, and examine the association between antibiotic prescription and the presence of a viral infection. METHODS Nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained to detect respiratory viruses in non-hospitalized children aged ≥ three months to six years presenting with fever at an OHS. Symptoms were assessed using physical examinations and questionnaires. Logistic regression analysis was used to reveal associations between symptoms or diagnoses, and the presence of at least one virus RESULTS In total 257 nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained in 306 eligible children; 53% of these children were infected by at least one virus. The most frequently detected viruses were adenovirus (10.9%), RSV type A (10.5%) and PIV type 1 (8.6%). Cough (OR 2.6; 95% CI: 1.4-4.6) and temperature ≥ 38.0°C (OR 2.1; 95% CI: 1.3-3.5) were independent predictors of the presence of a virus, but the discriminative ability was low (AUC 0.64; 95% CI: 0.58-0.71). Antibiotic prescription rate was 37.3%. In 57.4% of children with an antibiotic prescription, a virus was found. CONCLUSION In over 50% of all febrile children presenting at an OHS, a virus was found.

An EMMA method was developed to investigate the stereoselectivity of the CYP3A4-mediated N-demethylation of ketamine. Ketamine was incubated in a 50 μm id bare fused-silica capillary together with human CYP3A4 Supersomes using a 100 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) at 37°C. A plug containing racemic ketamine and the NADPH regenerating system including all required cofactors for the enzymatic reaction was injected, followed by a plug of the metabolizing enzyme CYP3A4 (500 nM). These two plugs were bracketed by plugs of incubation buffer to ensure proper conditions for the enzymatic reaction. The rest of the capillary was filled with a pH 2.5 running buffer comprising 50 mM Tris, phosphoric acid, and 2% w/v of highly sulfated γ-cyclodextrin. Mixing of reaction plugs was enhanced via application of -10 kV for 10 s. After an incubation of 8 min at 37°C without power application (zero-potential amplification), the capillary was cooled to 25°C within 3 min followed by application of -10 kV for the separation and detection of the formed enantiomers of norketamine.

The objective of this study was to compare the sensitivity of combined nose and throat swabs (CNTS) with that of nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA). This was a prospective study of adults and children with suspected influenza. Real-time reverse transcriptase PCR testing was used for the virological diagnosis. Of the 2,473 patients included, 264 with paired CNTS and NPA were randomly selected. Novel influenza A/H1N1 virus was identified in at least one sample for 115 (43.6%) patients, the majority of them young adults. In 109 patients (94.8%) the virus was identified in the CNTS, and in 98 (85.2%) it was identified in the NPA (P = 0.02). In 93 patients (80.1%), the virus was identified in both specimens. Spearman's rho correlation coefficient between the two methods was 0.82 (P < 0.001). There were no significant differences in accuracy between the specimens when patients were stratified according to demographic or clinical characteristics except in the case of women, in whom the sensitivity of CNTS was higher (P = 0.01). The combination of CNTS and NPA had a significantly higher sensitivity in identifying the virus than did each method alone (P = 0.02 for the comparison of the combination of both sampling methods with CNTS, and P < 0.001 for the comparison with NPA). We conclude that in patients with the novel influenza A/H1N1 virus, the diagnostic yield of CNTS is higher than that of NPA. The combination of both sampling methods increases the likelihood of diagnosing the virus.","de la Tabla, Victoria Ortiz; Masiá, Mar; Antequera, Pedro; Martin, Coral; Gazquez, Gregoria; Buñuel, Fernando; Gutiérrez, Félix",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jcm.01105-10; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20702662/,33

METHODS We retrospectively analyzed the data of patients with COVID-19 older than 65 years who were treated in our hospital from January 28, 2020 to March 5, 2020, and explored the relationship between nutritional risk and clinical outcomes. RESULTS A total of 141 patients with COVID-19 (46 common COVID-19, 73 severe COVID-19, and 22 extremely severe COVID-19) were enrolled in the study. NRS 2002 identified 85.8% of patients as having risk, with being identified 41.1% by MUST, 77.3% by MNA-sf, and 71.6% by NRI. The agreement strength was moderate between NRS 2002 and MNA-sf, NRI, fair between MUST and MNA-sf, NRI, fair between MNA-sf and NRI, poor between NRS 2002 and MUST (P < 0.01).

The purpose of the present study was to quantify its impact on surgical volume, hospitalizations, clinic appointments, and accident and emergency attendances to guide staffing and resource deployment for the sustenance of emergency services. METHODS Data were retrieved from all 43 Hong Kong public hospitals and 122 outpatient clinics from a population of 7.5 million residents. The ""COVID-19 cohort"" of patients who received treatment from January 25 to March 27, 2020, was compared with the ""control cohort"" of patients who received treatment during the same time of year over the past 4 years. Primary outcomes consisted of changes in patient diagnoses, number of operations performed, and hospitalizations during the COVID-19 pandemic. Secondary outcomes included differences in patient age and comorbidity, the nature of operations performed, types of anesthesia for orthopaedic procedures, difference in anesthetic times, wait times, and personal protective equipment (PPE) reserves. RESULTS A total of 928,278 patient-episodes (32,613 operations, 97,648 hospital admissions, 302,717 accident and emergency attendances, and 495,300 outpatient clinic attendances) were analyzed. Orthopaedic operations were reduced by 44.2%, from a mean (and standard deviation) of 795 ± 115.1 to 443.6 ± 25.8 per week (p < 0.001), with the ratio of emergency to elective operations increasing from 1.27:1 to 3.78:1. Operations for the treatment of upper and lower-limb fractures decreased by 23% (from 98.5 ± 14 to 75.9 ± 15.2 per week; p < 0.001) and 20% (from 210.6 ± 29.5 to 168.4 ± 16.9 per week; p < 0.001), respectively, whereas elective joint replacement and ligamentous reconstruction procedures decreased by 74% to 84% (p < 0.001). Operations for orthopaedic infections such as necrotizing fasciitis and septic arthritis remained similar (p > 0.05). The number of hospitalizations decreased by 41.2% (from 2,365 ± 243 to 1,391 ± 53 per week; p < 0.001), whereas clinical outpatient visits decreased by 29.4% (from 11,693 ± 2,240 to 8,261 ± 1,104 per week; p < 0.001). Patients did not endure longer wait times for emergency operations and accident and emergency consultations (p > 0.05). PPE consumption did not exceed procurement, with net increases in PPE reserves. CONCLUSIONS Demand for orthopaedic care remains, despite weekly reductions of 351 orthopaedic operations, 974 hospital admissions, and 3,432 clinic attendances.

The primary outcome was functional hospital stay, defined as the time between end of surgery and when predefined discharge criteria (pain adequately controlled, fever and postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) absent, full liquid diet tolerated, mobilized and feeling fit for discharge) were met. Secondary outcomes were total length of hospital stay, 30-day complication and mortality rates, duration of surgery, time spent on the recovery ward and health-related quality of life. Results A total 220 patients were randomized to ERAS (110 patients) or conventional (110) care. Patients in the ERAS group had shorter functional hospital stay (17·4 versus 20·5 h; P < 0·001), quicker pain control, tolerated liquid diet earlier, had earlier control of PONV, mobilized sooner and were comfortable with discharge sooner than those receiving conventional care. Total length of hospital stay, duration of surgery, time spent on the recovery ward, health-related quality of life, complication and readmission rates did not differ between the study groups. There were no deaths. Conclusion Patients under ERAS care recovered faster after LRYGB surgery than those receiving conventional care, with no increase in readmission and postoperative morbidity rates.

151983,Reply.,2020-11-01,"INTRODUCTION Safe pulmonary vessel sealing device plays a crucial role in anatomic lung resection. In 2014, we reported high rates of massive bleeding complications during transumbilical lobectomy in a canine model due to difficulty in managing the pulmonary vessel with an endostapler. In this animal survival series, we aimed to evaluate the outcome of pulmonary vessel sealing with an electrocautery device to simplify the transumbilical thoracic surgery. METHODS Under general anesthesia, a 3-cm longitudinal incision was made over the umbilicus. Under video guidance, a bronchoscope was inserted through the incision for exploration. The diaphragmatic wound was created with an electrocautery knife and used as the entrance into the thoracic cavity. Using the transumbilical technique, anatomic lobectomy was performed with electrosurgical devices and endoscopic vascular staplers in 15 canines. RESULTS Transumbilical endoscopic anatomic lobectomy was successfully completed in 12 of the 15 animals. Intraoperative bleeding developed in three animals during pulmonary hilum dissection, where one animal was killed due to hemodynamic instability and the other two animals required thoracotomy to complete the operation. There were five delayed bleeding and surgical mortality cases caused by inadequate vessel sealing by electrosurgical devices. Postmortem examination confirmed correct transumbilical lobectomy in the twelve animals that survived the operations. CONCLUSION Transumbilical anatomic lobectomy is technically feasible in a canine model; however, the electrosurgical devices were not effective in sealing the pulmonary vessel in the current canine model.","Liu, Hung-Ping; Chu, Yen; Wu, Yi-Cheng; Hsieh, Ming-Ju; Liu, Chieng-Ying; Chen, Tzu-Ping; Chao, Yin-Kai; Wu, Ching-Yang; Yeh, Chi-Ju; Ko, Po-Jen; Liu, Yun-Hen",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-015-4412-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26275535/,33

152533,Equivalent air elimination capability does not mean equivalent fluid warming capability.,2012,"BACKGROUND Many genetic diseases are known to have distinctive facial phenotypes, which are highly informative to provide an opportunity for automated detection. However, the diagnostic performance of artificial intelligence to identify genetic diseases with facial phenotypes requires further investigation. The objectives of this systematic review and meta-analysis are to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of artificial intelligence to identify the genetic diseases with face phenotypes and then find the best algorithm. METHODS The systematic review will be conducted in accordance with the ""Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocols"" guidelines. The following electronic databases will be searched: PubMed, Web of Science, IEEE, Ovid, Cochrane Library, EMBASE and China National Knowledge Infrastructure. Two reviewers will screen and select the titles and abstracts of the studies retrieved independently during the database searches and perform full-text reviews and extract available data. The main outcome measures include diagnostic accuracy, as defined by accuracy, recall, specificity, and precision. The descriptive forest plot and summary receiver operating characteristic curves will be used to represent the performance of diagnostic tests. Subgroup analysis will be performed for different algorithms aided diagnosis tests. The quality of study characteristics and methodology will be assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 tool. Data will be synthesized by RevMan 5.3 and Meta-disc 1.4 software. RESULTS The findings of this systematic review and meta-analysis will be disseminated in a relevant peer-reviewed journal and academic presentations. CONCLUSION To our knowledge, there have not been any systematic review or meta-analysis relating to diagnosis performance of artificial intelligence in identifying the genetic diseases with face phenotypes. The findings would provide evidence to formulate a comprehensive understanding of applications using artificial intelligence in identifying the genetic diseases with face phenotypes and add considerable value in the future of precision medicine.

152573,Abstracts from the 2021 Annual Scientific Meeting of the British and Irish Hypertension Society (BIHS).,2021-09-01,"BACKGROUND Deep neuromuscular blockade (NMB) may reduce muscle injury and related inflammation. The inflammation is one of the pathophysiological processes of peri-operative complications. OBJECTIVE To compare the degree of inflammation and related postoperative complications including postoperative delirium (POD) and peri-operative bleeding according to the degree of NMB during general anaesthesia for total hip replacement. DESIGN A prospective, single-blind, randomised controlled trial. SETTING Tertiary, university hospital, single centre. PATIENTS Eighty-two patients undergoing total hip replacement surgery were included in the final analysis. INTERVENTIONS Moderate (Mod) and deep (Deep) NMB groups. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The changes in inflammatory cytokines were measured. The incidence of POD was evaluated by using confusion assessment method (CAM). The differences of postoperative bleeding and peri-operative oxygenation in both groups were also measured. RESULTS The NMB reversal duration was significantly longer in the Mod NMB group than in the Deep NMB group. Changes in interleukin-6 were significantly smaller in the Deep NMB group than in the Mod NMB group (P < 0.001). The incidence of POD was not significantly different between groups (34 versus 17% in Mod and Deep NMB groups, respectively; P = 0.129). The amount of postoperative bleeding until postoperative day 2 was significantly greater in the Mod NMB group than in the Deep NMB group (P = 0.027). CONCLUSION Our findings suggest that inflammation related to peri-operative complications could be associated with the depth of NMB during total hip replacement. However, the incidence of POD might not be associated to the depth of NMB. TRIAL REGISTRATION National Library of Medicine (NLM) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) of United States.

153264,Allergic contact dermatitis caused by tocopheryl nicotinate.,2021-01-05,"BACKGROUND Inguinal hernias account for 75% of abdominal wall hernias, with a lifetime risk of 27% in men and 3% in women. Major complications are recurrence, chronic pain, and surgical site infection, but their frequency is low. Few studies have reported a calcified mesh causing neuropathy by chronic compression of the femoral nerve after mesh & plug inguinal hernia repair. This is the first report of laparoscopic plug removal for femoral colic due to femoral nerve irritation cause by a calcified plug after mesh & plug inguinal hernia repair. CASE PRESENTATION In July 2013, a 53-year-old man presented to our hospital with a chief complaint of colic pain in the left lower limb while walking. The patient had undergone left inguinal hernia repair about 10 years earlier and reported no chronic pain after the operation. Physical examination revealed a colic pain exacerbated by left thigh movement, especially during flexion, but the patient was pain-free at rest and had no sensory loss. Axial computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging showed that the inward-projecting plug was extremely close to the femoral nerve. Because of the radicular symptoms and the absence of orthopedic and urological disease, we strongly suspected that the neuralgia was associated with the previous hernia operation and advised exploratory laparotomy, which revealed the plug bulging inward into the abdominal cavity. Moreover, the tip of the plug was firmly calcified and compressing the femoral nerve, which lay just beneath the plug, especially during hip flexion. We explanted the plug and his pain resolved after the operation. The patient remains pain free after 20 months of follow up. CONCLUSION In this study, laparoscopic hernioplasty proved useful for plug removal because laparoscopic instruments can easily grasp perilesional tissue, and laparoscopic approach has the benefit of isolating the plug for removal while preserving the onlay patch, and helpful for restoring peritoneal defects. Laparoscopic plug removal effectively resolved colic pain in the left thigh due to compression of the femoral nerve by a calcified plug.","Ohkura, Yu; Haruta, Shusuke; Shinohara, Hisashi; Lee, Seigi; Fukui, Yudai; Kobayashi, Nao; Momose, Kota; Ueno, Masaki; Udagawa, Harushi",BMC surgery,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12893-015-0046-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25980410/,33
153334,Collateral flow at circle of Willis in healthy condition.,2021-02-17,"INTRODUCTION We aimed to review the prevalence, the risk factors and the outcomes of venous thrombosis (VT) in patients hospitalized for COronaVirus Disease 19 (COVID-19). METHODS Electronic bibliographic databases were searched using the words ""COVID venous thrombosis"". The review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement standards. RESULTS The search of the Literature retrieved 877 results. After assessment of full texts, 69 papers were included in the qualitative analysis and 23 of them in the quantitative evaluation. The analyzed studies included a total of 106838 patients hospitalized for COVID-19 from 01/2020 to 12/2020. The pooled reported prevalence rate of VT was in median 16.7% (IQR 5.8%-30%), being higher in ICU patients (60.8%-85.4%). VT events were reported in about 75% of cases in the popliteal and calf veins. Signs and symptoms were present in 6.1% of cases. At quantitative evaluation, older age, D-dimer and obesity increased the odds to experience a VT (OR 3.54, 95%CI 0.65-6.43, P=0.01; OR=956.86, 95%CI 225.67-1668.05, P=0.01; OR 1.42, 95%CI 1.01-1.99, P=0.03 respectively). Female sex seemed to be protective against the odds of VT (OR 0.77, 95%CI 0.63-0.93, P=0.007). CONCLUSIONS Among patients hospitalized for COVID-19, VT is a relatively common finding, with higher prevalence rates in ICU patients. VT occurs mostly in the distal regions of the lower limb and is asymptomatic in most cases. Older age, obesity and higher D-dimer values on admission increased the odds of VT, while female sex was protective against the odds of VT.","Mazzaccaro, Daniela; Giannetta, Matteo; Fancoli, Fabiana; Milani, Valentina; Modafferi, Alfredo; Malacrida, Giovanni; Righini, Paolo; Marrocco-Trischitta, Massimiliano M; Nano, Giovanni",The Journal of cardiovascular surgery,https://doi.org/10.23736/s0021-9509.21.12022-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34520137/,33
153354,"Assessment of chromosomal aberrations among agricultural workers exposed to pesticides in Punjab, India.",2020-10-13,"COVID-19 is overwhelming hospitals with patients requiring respiratory support, including ventilators and ECMO. Bottlenecks in device availability may contribute to mortality, and limited device availability even in ECMO centers has led to rationing recommendations. Therefore, we explored options for ad-hoc construction of veno-venous ECMO using readily available components, essentially, large cannulas, membrane oxygenators, and blood pumps. As thousands certified cardiac Impella pumps are distributed worldwide, we assembled lean ECMO by embedding Impella pumps coaxially in tubes, combined with standard gas exchangers.Ad-hoc integration of Impella blood pumps with gas exchange modules, large-bore venous cannulas, regular ECMO tubing, Y-pieces and connectors led to lean ECMO systems with stable performance over several days. Oxygenation of 2.5-5 L of blood/minute is realistic. Benefit/risk analysis appears favorable if a patient needs respiratory support but required support systems in a center are exhausted.Ad-hoc assembly of veno-venous ECMOs is feasible using Impella blood pumps, results in stable blood flow across gas exchange modules, and thus may offer another opportunity to oxygenate, ""recover the lungs"" and hopefully save lives in selected patients with severe COVID-19 disease even when conventional life support equipment is exhausted. The lean design also yields inspirations for future ECMO systems.","Hunziker, Patrick; Zenklusen, Urs",ASAIO journal,https://doi.org/10.1097/mat.0000000000001278; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32804773/,33

We aimed to describe the clinical characteristics, correlates and outcomes of critically ill patients with severe COVID-19 complicated by acute kidney injury (AKI). METHODS We performed a multicenter retrospective cohort study of 671 critically ill adults with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from 19 hospitals in China between January 1 to February 29, 2020. Data were captured on demographics, comorbidities, symptoms, acute physiology, laboratory parameters, interventions, and outcomes. The primary exposure was ICU admission for confirmed COVID-19 related critically illness. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. Secondary outcomes included factors associated with AKI, organ dysfunction, treatment intensity, and health services use. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Of 671 severe COVID-19 patients (median [IQR] 65 [56-73] years; male sex 65% (n = 434); hypertension 43% (n = 287) and APACHE II score 10 [7-14]), 39% developed AKI. Patients with AKI were older, had greater markers of inflammation and coagulation activation, and had greater acuity and organ dysfunction as presentation. Despite similar treatment with antivirals, patients with AKI had lower viral conversion negative rates than those without AKI. The 28-day mortality was much higher in AKI patients than patients without AKI (72% vs. 42%), and there was an increase in 28-day mortality according to the severity of AKI. Non-survivors were less likely to receive antiviral therapy [132 (70%) vs. 65 (88%)] compared with survivors and have lower viral negative conversion rate [17 (9%) vs. 47 (64%)]. CONCLUSIONS Acute kidney injury was quite common in severe COVID-19 pneumonia, which associated with higher mortality.","Xu, Jingyuan; Xie, Jianfeng; Du, Bin; Tong, Zhaohui; Qiu, Haibo; Bagshaw, Sean M",Journal of intensive care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1177/0885066620970858; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33267722/,33

Here, we used an array of omics techniques including glycomics to examine the effect of dietary fiber consumption on the gut microbiota, colonic mucin O-glycosylation and host physiology of high-fat diet-fed C57BL/6J mice. The high-fat diet group had significantly impaired glucose tolerance and altered liver proteome, gut microbiota composition, and short-chain fatty acid production compared to normal chow diet group. While dietary fiber inclusion did not reverse all high fat-induced modifications, it resulted in specific changes, including an increase in the relative abundance of bacterial families with known fiber digesters and a higher propionate concentration. Conversely, colonic mucin O-glycosylation remained similar between the normal chow and high-fat diet groups, while dietary fiber intervention resulted in major alterations in O-glycosylation. Correlation network analysis revealed previously undescribed associations between specific bacteria and mucin glycan structures. For example, the relative abundance of the bacterium Parabacteroides distasonis positively correlated with glycan structures containing one terminal fucose and correlated negatively with glycans containing two terminal fucose residues or with both an N-acetylneuraminic acid and a sulfate residue. This is the first comprehensive report of the impact of dietary fiber on the colonic mucin O-glycosylation and associations of these mucosal glycans with specific gut bacteria.","Gamage, Hasinika K A H; Chong, Raymond W W; Bucio-Noble, Daniel; Kautto, Liisa; Hardikar, Anandwardhan A; Ball, Malcolm S; Molloy, Mark P; Packer, Nicolle H; Paulsen, Ian T",Gut microbes,https://doi.org/10.1080/19490976.2020.1802209; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32991816/,33

As the interaction of the underlying pathologies caused by vvECMO in COVID-19 is barely understood, we designed this study to better differentiate coagulation disorders in COVID-19 patients before, during and after vvECMO-support. METHODS Observational case series, six consecutive patients with Coronavirus acute respiratory distress syndrome supported with vvECMO treated in the anaesthesiologic ICU in a third level University ECMO-centre. We measured routine coagulation parameters and assessed coagulation factors. We also conducted advanced von Willebrand factor (VWF) multimer analysis, platelet aggregometry and immunological screening. RESULTS We identified various phases of coagulation disorders: Initially, intensely activated coagulation with highly increased VWF and factor VIII activity in acute COVID-19, then severe acquired von Willebrand syndrome and platelet dysfunction during vvECMO leading to spontaneous bleeding and finally, hypercoagulopathy after vvECMO explantation. Five of six patients developed immunological abnormalities enhancing coagulation. CONCLUSIONS Coronavirus-induced coagulopathy and bleeding disorders during vvECMO cannot be discriminated via 'routine' coagulation tests. Precise and specific analyses followed by the appropriate treatment of coagulation disorders may help us develop tailored therapeutic concepts to better manage the phases described above.","Kalbhenn, Johannes; Glonnegger, Hannah; Wilke, Maya; Bansbach, Joachim; Zieger, Barbara",Perfusion,https://doi.org/10.1177/02676591211001791; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33719738/,33

Apple's ""Mobility Trends"" (AMT) data details levels of community mobility; it is a novel resource of potential use to epidemiologists. OBJECTIVE The aim of the study is to use AMT data to examine the relationship between mobility and COVID-19 case occurrence for Germany. Is a change in mobility apparent following COVID-19 and the implementation of social restrictions? Is there a relationship between mobility and COVID-19 occurrence in Germany? METHODS AMT data illustrates mobility levels throughout the epidemic, allowing the relationship between mobility and disease to be examined. Generalized additive models (GAMs) were established for Germany, with mobility categories, and date, as explanatory variables, and case numbers as response. RESULTS Clear reductions in mobility occurred following the implementation of movement restrictions. There was a negative correlation between mobility and confirmed case numbers. GAM using all three categories of mobility data accounted for case occurrence as well and was favorable (AIC or Akaike Information Criterion: 2504) to models using categories separately (AIC with ""driving,"" 2511. ""transit,"" 2513. ""walking,"" 2508). CONCLUSION These results suggest an association between mobility and case occurrence.

Despite a critical appraisal of the current literature points toward an insufficient evidence base about the existence of a peculiar association between covid-19 and myocarditis, the concern for unrecognized myocarditis and its potential consequences has led several sports medicine organizations to recommend a variety of cardiac tests to enable return to play in athletes with previous covid-19. We argue that some of these recommendations may lead to unnecessary tests or treatments, especially for asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 positive people and for those with previous mild disease, and that sports participation may even be discouraged. As a response to current uncertainty, we advocate both for randomized studies that analyse the outcomes of different diagnostic strategies and for a prolonged follow-up of these people.","Alderighi, Camilla; Rasoini, Raffaele",Recenti progressi in medicina,https://doi.org/10.1701/3565.35457; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33687357/,33

MATERIAL AND METHODS We used data from three nationally representative cross-sectional studies and compared the prevalence of current mood and anxiety disorders, and alcohol-use disorders at baseline (November 2017, n = 3306), immediately after the first peak (May 2020, n = 3021), and during the second peak (November 2020, n = 3000) of COVID-19 in Czechia. We used the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I.) as a screening instrument, and calculated weighted prevalence (%) with 95% weighted confidence intervals (95% CIs). Additionally, we examined the prevalence of these disorders across different non-clinical population sub-groups during the second wave of the pandemic. RESULTS The proportion of individuals experiencing at least one mental disorder was highest during the second wave of the pandemic (32.94%, 95% CI = 31.14%; 34.77%), when compared to both the baseline in November 2017 (20.02%, 95% CI = 18.64%; 21.39%), and the first wave in May 2020 (29.63%, 95% CI = 27.9%; 31.37%). Younger adults, students, those having lost a job or on forced leave, and those with only elementary education displayed disproportionally high prevalence of mental disorders. CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest that population mental health has not returned to pre-COVID-19 levels. It seems that mental health of some population subgroups, such as young adults or those worse off economically, might have been affected disproportionately by the COVID-19 situation, and future studies identifying high-risk groups are warranted.","Winkler, Petr; Mohrova, Zuzana; Mlada, Karolina; Kuklova, Marie; Kagstrom, Anna; Mohr, Pavel; Formanek, Tomas",Journal of psychiatric research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2021.05.032; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34062293/,33

METHODS All consecutive patients admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) of our institute for COVID-19 from 1 April 2020 to 20 May 2020 were included. Patient characteristics including complete medical history and comorbid diseases, admission and 7th day blood test results and clinical characteristics were compared between survivors and non-survivors. RESULTS There were no significant difference between survivors and non-survivors regarding age, gender, and pre-existing coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes, heart failure, coronary artery bypass grafting surgery, percutaneous coronary intervention and coronary stenting. Admission D-dimer and NT-proBNP levels of non-survivors were significantly higher than survivors. CRP, procalcitonin, creatine kinase (CK) and troponin I levels on 7th day of admission were significantly higher in non-survivors compared to survivors. In addition, both admission and 7th day lymphocyte count were lower in non-survivors compared to that of the survivors. CRP declined from admission to 7th day of hospitalisation in survivors, whereas a median 6.75 mg/L increase was observed in non survivors. The peak and minimum CRP, procalcitonin and levels were significantly higher in non-survivors than survivors. The peak NT-proBNP level of non-survivors was also significantly higher than that of the survivors. Intubation, lower GFR values and higher NT-proBNP values were predictive for death. CONCLUSION The prothrombotic coagulopathy mediated by the endothelial interaction with SARS-CoV-2 may also have role in unfavourable prognosis in COVID-19.

155800,Error in Figure.,2018,"Hypertension is one of the most common comorbidities in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This study aimed to clarify the impact of hypertension on COVID-19 and investigate whether the prior use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors affects the prognosis of COVID-19. A total of 996 patients with COVID-19 were enrolled, including 282 patients with hypertension and 714 patients without hypertension. Propensity score-matched analysis (1:1 matching) was used to adjust the imbalanced baseline variables between the 2 groups. Patients with hypertension were further divided into the RAAS inhibitor group (n=41) and non-RAAS inhibitor group (n=241) according to their medication history. The results showed that COVID-19 patients with hypertension had more severe secondary infections, cardiac and renal dysfunction, and depletion of CD8+ cells on admission. Patients with hypertension were more likely to have comorbidities and complications and were more likely to be classified as critically ill than those without hypertension. Cox regression analysis revealed that hypertension (hazard ratio, 95% CI, unmatched cohort [1.80, 1.20-2.70]; matched cohort [2.24, 1.36-3.70]) was independently associated with all-cause mortality in patients with COVID-19. In addition, hypertensive patients with a history of RAAS inhibitor treatment had lower levels of C-reactive protein and higher levels of CD4+ cells. The mortality of patients in the RAAS inhibitor group (9.8% versus 26.1%) was significantly lower than that of patients in the non-RAAS inhibitor group. In conclusion, hypertension may be an independent risk factor for all-cause mortality in patients with COVID-19. Patients who previously used RAAS inhibitors may have a better prognosis.","Pan, Wei; Zhang, Jishou; Wang, Menglong; Ye, Jing; Xu, Yao; Shen, Bo; He, Hua; Wang, Zhen; Ye, Di; Zhao, Mengmeng; Luo, Zhen; Liu, Mingxiao; Zhang, Pingan; Gu, Jian; Liu, Menglin; Li, Dan; Liu, Jianfang; Wan, Jun",Hypertension,https://doi.org/10.1161/hypertensionaha.120.15289; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32654555/,33
156130,The Effect of Early Life Stress on Memory is Mediated by Anterior Hippocampal Network.,2020-10-23,"BACKGROUND Pulmonary resection is occasionally performed in postpneumonectomy patients with contralateral lung lesions, such as metachronous or metastatic lung cancer. Careful intraoperative respiratory management is essential in such patients. This study evaluated the respiratory management of postpneumonectomy patients who underwent contralateral pulmonary resection with selective bronchial blockade of the lobe or segment to be resected. METHODS We retrospectively analyzed the surgical findings and safety of surgery in six patients who underwent contralateral pulmonary resection with selective bronchial blockade after pneumonectomy for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). RESULTS The percutaneous oxygen saturation did not decrease in any of the patients during bronchial blockade under high oxygen concentration. The median blockade time was 57.5 minutes. The operative field was tolerable secured under conditions of partial lung collapse, and partial pulmonary resection was performed as planned. Postoperatively, one patient developed acute respiratory distress syndrome due to acute exacerbation of interstitial pneumonia; however, no patients died within one month postoperatively. Two patients underwent pulmonary resection in order to obtain adequate tissue specimens to evaluate the biomarkers of multiple lung metastases. On histopathology, one patient tested positive for anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) and was subsequently administered an ALK inhibitor, which prolonged survival. CONCLUSIONS In all patients, intraoperative respiratory condition under partial lung collapse remained stable, and all partial pulmonary resections were safely performed. However, surgical indications should be carefully reviewed preoperatively in patients with interstitial pneumonia. KEY POINTS SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS OF THE STUDY: Contralateral partial pulmonary resection was performed using selective bronchial blockade in postpneumonectomy patients. Percutaneous oxygen saturation did not decrease during the bronchial blockade under high oxygen concentration, and the operative field was tolerable secured under conditions of partial lung collapse. WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS Oxygen concentration can be set to the minimum level, sufficient to maintain oxygenation, during contralateral partial pulmonary resection with selective bronchial blockade.","Kawamoto, Nobutaka; Furukawa, Masashi; Okita, Riki; Okada, Masanori; Hayashi, Masataro; Inokawa, Hidetoshi; Okabe, Kazunori; Kawata, Keisuke",Thoracic cancer,https://doi.org/10.1111/1759-7714.13696; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33052015/,33

This crisis is also negatively impacting the care of patients with non-COVID-19 conditions, including those with cerebellar ataxia (CA). Older patients with CA and those with immune-mediated ataxias on immunosuppressive medication are potentially at high risk of developing serious complications of the infection, although it is also possible that immunosuppressive agents may provide a defense against cytokine storm. This has implications for even greater attention to preventing contracting the disease through physical distancing and/or isolation. The CA patient population is also at higher risk because of the neurological complexities of their underlying disorder and the comorbid medical illnesses that often accompany the genetic ataxias. As the disruption of social patterns and healthcare delivery in response to the crisis continues, interruption of rehabilitation, speech and language therapy, and face-to-face consultations threatens to have a negative impact on the course and well-being of CA patients. Mental and physical health is also potentially at greater risk because the prevailing uncertainty and anxiety may be superimposed upon cerebellum-specific neuropsychological challenges. We identify and review some of the short- and long-term consequences of this global pandemic for the community of ataxia patients and their families and for the clinical and academic neurologists/ataxiologists caring for these patients. This includes the recognition that telemedicine has emerged as a principle means of caregiver-patient contact and that neurological manifestations of COVID-19 including those specific to cerebellar neurobiology are increasingly recognized and will require close surveillance and monitoring. This COVID-19 Cerebellum Task Force consensus provides some guidance on how we may approach this uncertain time and consider preparing for the new realities we face in CA patient care once this acute crisis has passed.","Manto, Mario; Dupre, Nicolas; Hadjivassiliou, Marios; Louis, Elan D; Mitoma, Hiroshi; Molinari, Marco; Shaikh, Aasef G; Soong, Bing-Wen; Strupp, Michael; Van Overwalle, Frank; Schmahmann, Jeremy D",Cerebellum,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12311-020-01139-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32405955/,33
156680,Another Medical Malpractice Crisis?: Try Something Different.,2020-09-17,"INTRODUCTION Evidence-based alcohol policies have the potential to reduce a wide range of related harms. Yet, barriers to adoption and implementation within governments often exist. Engaging relevant stakeholders may be an effective way to identify and address potential challenges thereby increasing reach and uptake of policy evaluation research and strengthening jurisdictional responses to alcohol harms. METHODS As part of the 2019 Canadian Alcohol Policy Evaluation project, we conducted interviews with government stakeholders across alcohol-related sectors prior to a second round of researcher-led policy assessments in Canada's 13 provinces and territories. Stakeholders were asked for feedback on the design and impact of an earlier policy assessment in 2013 and for recommendations to improve the design and dissemination strategy for the next iteration. Content analysis was used to identify ways of improving stakeholder engagement. RESULTS We interviewed 25 stakeholders across 12 of Canada's 13 jurisdictions, including representatives from government health ministries and from alcohol regulation, distribution and finance departments. In providing feedback on our stakeholder engagement strategy, participants highlighted the importance of maintaining ongoing contact; presenting results in accessible online formats; providing advance notice of results; and offering jurisdiction-specific webinars. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS This study offers important insight into the engagement preferences of government stakeholders involved in the health, regulation, distribution and financial aspects of alcohol control policy. Findings suggest that seeking input from stakeholders as part of conducting evaluation research is warranted; increasing the relevance, reach and uptake of results. Specific stakeholder engagement strategies are outlined.","Vallance, Kate; Stockwell, Tim; Wettlaufer, Ashley; Giesbrecht, Norman; Chow, Clifton; Card, Kiffer G; Farrell-Low, Amanda",Drug and alcohol review,https://doi.org/10.1111/dar.13313; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34046948/,33

The primary end-point was recurrence. METHODS Retrospective review of patients who underwent laparoscopic ventral hernia repair for small- and medium-sized hernias between July 2000 and September 2011. These patients were divided: (1) repair with mesh alone (non-closure group) and (2) those with hernia defect closure and mesh reinforcement (closure group). The closure group was further divided by technique: percutaneous versus intracorporeal closure of the defect. RESULTS 128 patients were studied: 93 patients (72.66 %) in the non-closure group and 35 patients (27.34 %) in the closure group. Follow-up was available in 105 patients (82.03 %) at a mean of 797.2 days (range 7-3,286 days). In the non-closure group there were 14 patients (15.05 %) with postoperative complications and 8 patients (22.86 %) in the closure group, four of which were seromas. Fourteen patients (19.18 %) developed recurrent hernias in the non-closure group with an average time to presentation of 23.17 months (range 5.3-75.3). Two patients (6.25 %) developed recurrent hernias in the percutaneous group with an average time to presentation of 12.95 months (range 9.57-16.33). There have been no recurrences in patients whose defect was closed intracorporeally. CONCLUSION Although our study demonstrated a difference in recurrence rates of 19.18 % in the non-closure group versus 6.25 % in the closure group, the difference did not reach statistical significance. A larger series with longer follow-up may demonstrate clinical significance.","Zeichen, M S; Lujan, H J; Mata, W N; Maciel, V H; Lee, D; Jorge, I; Plasencia, G; Gomez, E; Hernandez, A M",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10029-013-1115-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23784711/,33

We constructed an ordinal logistic regression model to predict outcome and treatment benefit, defined as the difference between the predicted probability of good functional outcome (mRS score 0-2) with and without intra-arterial treatment.Results 11 baseline clinical and radiological characteristics were included in the model. The externally validated C statistic was 0.69 (95% confidence interval 0.64 to 0.73) for the ordinal model and 0.73 (0.67 to 0.79) for the prediction of good functional outcome, indicating moderate discriminative ability. The mean predicted treatment benefit varied between patients in the combined derivation and validation cohort from -2.3% to 24.3%. There was benefit of intra-arterial treatment predicted for some individual patients from groups in which no treatment effect was found in previous subgroup analyses, such as those with no or poor collaterals.Conclusion The proposed clinical decision tool combines multiple baseline clinical and radiological characteristics and shows large variations in treatment benefit between patients.

In this study, we assessed the feasibility of a newly developed, piezo actuator-driven pulsed water jet (ADPJ) for liver resection in a surviving swine model. METHODS Ten domestic pigs underwent liver resection. Parenchymal transection and vessel skeletonization were performed using the ADPJ (group A, n = 5) or an ultrasonic aspirator (group U, n = 5). The water jet was applied at a frequency of 400 Hz and a driving voltage of 80 V. Physiological saline was supplied at a flow rate of 7 ml/min. After 7 days, the animals were killed and their short-term complications were examined and compared between the two groups. RESULTS No significant complications, such as massive bleeding, occurred in either group during the surgical procedures. The transection time per transection area was significantly shorter in group A than in group U (1.5 ± 0.3 vs. 2.3 ± 0.5 min/cm(2), respectively, P = 0.03). Blood loss per transection area was not significantly different between groups A and U (9.3 ± 4.2 vs. 11.7 ± 2.3 ml/cm(2), P = 0.6). All pigs in group A survived for 7 days. No postoperative bleeding or bile leakage was observed in any animal at necropsy. CONCLUSION The present results suggested that the ADPJ reduces transection time without increasing blood loss. ADPJ is a safe and feasible device for liver parenchymal transection.","Nakanishi, Chikashi; Nakano, Toru; Nakagawa, Atsuhiro; Sato, Chiaki; Yamada, Masato; Kawagishi, Naoki; Tominaga, Teiji; Ohuchi, Noriaki",Biomedical engineering online,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12938-016-0126-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26809992/,33

158821,"The mechanical ventilator: past, present, and future.",2011,"Prophylactic administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics in surgery can change the oral microbiome and induce colonization of oral cavity with Gram-negative bacteria including multidrug (MDR) or extensively- drug resistant (XDR) organisms which can lead to lower respiratory tract infections. The aim of the study was to analyze the Gram-negative isolates obtained from oral cavity of the mechanically ventilated patients in ICUs, after prophylactic application of antibiotics and their resistance mechanisms and to compare them with the isolates obtained from tracheal aspirates from the same patients. The antibiotic susceptibility was determined by broth dilution method. PCR was applied to detect genes encoding β-lactamases. Marked diversity of Gram-negative bacteria and resistance mechanisms was found. High resistance rates and high rate of blaCTX-M and carbapenemase encoding genes (blaVIM-1 , blaOXA-48 ) were found among Klebsiella pneumoniae. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was found to harbour blaVIM and in one strain blaPER-1 gene, whereas Acinetobacter baumannii produced OXA-23-like and OXA-24/40-like oxacillinases and was XDR in all except one case. All XDR isolates belong to international clonal lineage II (IC II). The main finding of the study is that the prophlylactic application of antibiotics in surgery intensive care units (ICUs) is associated with the colonization of oral cavity and lower respiratory tract with Gram-negative bacteria. The identity of Gram-negative bacteria in oral cavity reflected those found in endotracheal aspirates leading to conclusion that oral swab as non-invasive specimen can predict the colonization of lower respiratory tract with resistant Gram-negative organisms and the risk for development of ventilator-associated pneumonia.","Bratić, Vesna; Mihaljević, Slobodan; Verzak, Željko; Pleško, Eva; Lukić, Anita; Ćaćić, Marko; Bedenić, Branka",Letters in applied microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1111/lam.13493; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33896011/,33
159005,Vaginal Fractional Carbon Dioxide Laser Treatment and Changes in Vaginal Biomechanical Parameters.,2021-04-09,"Virus infections are a major cause of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations. Recently, Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) has been demonstrated to react to double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and to be involved in the immune responses after viral infections. In the present study, we examined whether oxidative stress, which is involved in the pathogenesis of COPD, enhances the responses of TLR3 in airway epithelial cells. The effect of hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) on the release of IL-8 from BEAS-2B cells and primary human bronchial epithelial cells after stimulation with polyinosine-polycytidylic acid [poly(I:C)], a synthetic analog of viral dsRNA and a ligand for TLR3, and the signal transduction were examined. One hundred to 150 muM H(2)O(2) significantly potentiated the release of IL-8 from the epithelial cells after stimulation with 10 microg/ml poly(I:C). The H(2)O(2)-augmented IL-8 release was inhibited by treatment with N-acetylcysteine. One hundred micromoles of H(2)O(2) enhanced the translocation of nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB p65, but not that of interferon regulatory factor-3 (IRF-3), into the nucleus and the NF-kappaB DNA binding activity after poly(I:C) stimulation, which effect was inhibited not by the silencing of IRF-3 but by MG132, a proteasome inhibitor, or dexamethasone. One hundred micromoles of H(2)O(2) potentiated the TLR3 expression on the airway epithelial cells treated with poly(I:C). These data suggest that oxidative stress augments the response of TLR3 in airway epithelial cells via NF-kappaB and that this effect might be partly mediated by the enhancement of TLR3 expression. Modulation of this pathway may be a therapeutic target for viral-induced exacerbations of COPD.","Koarai, Akira; Sugiura, Hisatoshi; Yanagisawa, Satoru; Ichikawa, Tomohiro; Minakata, Yoshiaki; Matsunaga, Kazuto; Hirano, Tsunahiko; Akamatsu, Keiichiro; Ichinose, Masakazu",American journal of respiratory cell and molecular biology,https://doi.org/10.1165/rcmb.2008-0345oc; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19597128/,33

METHODS This is a retrospective cohort study among children with positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR from March to July 2020 at Children's Hospital Colorado. Risk factors for severe disease were analyzed as defined by hospital admission, respiratory support, or critical care. Univariable and multivariable analyses were conducted. RESULTS Among 454 patients identified with SARS-CoV-2, 191 (42.1%) were females, median age 11 years. Fifty-five percent of all patients identified as Hispanic compared with 29% among all hospital visits in 2019 (P < 0.0001). In multivariable analyses, age 0-3 months or >20 years [adjusted odds ratio (aOR), 7.85; P < 0.0001 and aOR, 5.1; P = 0.03, respectively], preterm birth history (aOR, 3.7; P = 0.03), comorbidities [including immunocompromise (aOR, 3.5; P = 0.004), gastrointestinal condition (aOR, 2.7; P = 0.009), diabetes (aOR, 6.6; P = 0.04), asthma (aOR, 2.2; P = 0.04)], and specific symptoms at presentation were predictors for admission. Age 0-3 months or >20 years, asthma, gastrointestinal condition, and similar symptoms at presentation were also predictors for respiratory support. Elevated C-reactive protein was associated with the need for critical care with median of 17.7 mg/dL (IQR, 5.3-22.9) versus 1.95 mg/dL (IQR, 0.7-5.5) among patients requiring critical versus no critical care (OR, 1.2; P = 0.02).

The feasibility of removing these tumors through a minimal-access endonasal route has been demonstrated, but the importance, safety, and timing of OC exploration and decompression are not well described. OBJECTIVE To create a simple decision-tree algorithm for OC exploration and decompression in the endonasal endoscopic surgery for planum sphenoidale and tuberculum sella meningiomas. METHODS We identified a consecutive series of 8 planum sphenoidale and tuberculum sella meningiomas resected endonasally. ""Late"" OC exploration and decompression was performed in 4 of 8 patients. The extent of resection, visual outcome, and complications were recorded. RESULTS Five patients had OC invasion on magnetic resonance imaging. Endoscopic inspection did not reveal additional OC invasion. The OC was opened bilaterally in 2 patients and unilaterally in 2 patients. Gross total resection was achieved in 6 of 7 patients in whom it was the goal. Vision improved in 3 patients (3 of 3 OCs opened) and was stable in 4 (1 of 4 OCs opened). In 1 patient, the bitemporal hemianopsia improved, but there was unilateral deterioration (no OC invasion) because the tumor was extremely adherent to 1 optic nerve. After an average follow-up of 20.9 months, all patients had an Glasgow Outcome Scale score of 5, and there were no cerebrospinal fluid leaks. CONCLUSION Exploration and decompression of the OC are feasible, safe, and important to optimize visual outcome and to minimize recurrence in planum sphenoidale and tuberculum sella meningiomas resected endonasally. It may not be important to open the canal early during surgery because tumor debulking can be performed without manipulating the optic nerves. Early decompression, however, is technically feasible.","Attia, Moshe; Kandasamy, Jothy; Jakimovski, Dejan; Bedrosian, Jeffrey; Alimi, Marjan; Lee, Dennis L Y; Anand, Vijay K; Schwartz, Theodore H",Neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.1227/neu.0b013e318258e23d; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22517253/,33

Here, we studied the frequency of pathogenic germline variants (PGVs) in an extended panel of genes in women affected with LBC. METHODS 302 women with LBC and 1567 without breast cancer were tested for BRCA1/2 PGVs. A subset of 134 LBC affected women who tested negative for BRCA1/2 PGVs underwent extended screening, including: ATM, CDH1, CHEK2, NBN, PALB2, PTEN, RAD50, RAD51D, and TP53. RESULTS 35 PGVs were identified in the group with LBC, of which 22 were in BRCA1/2. Ten actionable PGVs were identified in additional genes (ATM(4), CDH1(1), CHEK2(1), PALB2(2) and TP53(2)). Overall, PGVs in three genes conferred a significant increased risk for LBC. Odds ratios (ORs) were: BRCA1: OR = 13.17 (95%CI 2.83-66.38; P = 0.0017), BRCA2: OR = 10.33 (95%CI 4.58-23.95; P < 0.0001); and ATM: OR = 8.01 (95%CI 2.52-29.92; P = 0.0053). We did not detect an increased risk of LBC for PALB2, CDH1 or CHEK2. CONCLUSION The overall PGV detection rate was 11.59%, with similar rates of BRCA1/2 (7.28%) PGVs as for other actionable PGVs (7.46%), indicating a benefit for extended panel genetic testing in LBC.

We present work that the mammalian SKI complex is a broad-spectrum, host-directed, antiviral drug target. Yeast suppressor screening was utilized to find a functional genetic interaction between proteins from influenza A virus (IAV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) with eukaryotic proteins that may be potential host factors involved in replication. This screening identified the SKI complex as a potential host factor for both viruses. In mammalian systems siRNA-mediated knockdown of SKI genes inhibited replication of IAV and MERS-CoV. In silico modeling and database screening identified a binding pocket on the SKI complex and compounds predicted to bind. Experimental assays of those compounds identified three chemical structures that were antiviral against IAV and MERS-CoV along with the filoviruses Ebola and Marburg and two further coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. The mechanism of antiviral activity is through inhibition of viral RNA production. This work defines the mammalian SKI complex as a broad-spectrum antiviral drug target and identifies lead compounds for further development.","Weston, Stuart; Baracco, Lauren; Keller, Chloe; Matthews, Krystal; McGrath, Marisa E; Logue, James; Liang, Janie; Dyall, Julie; Holbrook, Michael R; Hensley, Lisa E; Jahrling, Peter B; Yu, Wenbo; MacKerell, Alexander D; Frieman, Matthew B",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2012939117; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33184176/,33

RSB may not be successful beyond infancy because of the increased thickness of the rectal mucosa. EMR could improve the diagnostic yield for HD when compared with traditional RSB because larger and deeper samples are acquired for analysis. METHODS In this prospective, single-center study, patients referred for RSB were offered enrollment for concurrent EMR. Specimens were analyzed pathologically for size, submucosal ganglionic tissue, and acetylcholinesterase or calretinin staining. Biopsy results were compared with transit studies, anorectal manometry, and constipation severity through validated questionnaires. RESULTS Seventeen patients (2 male, 15 female; mean age, 35.8 years; range, 22-61 years) were enrolled in the study from 2008 to 2014. All patients underwent anorectal manometry (88% with anorectal dysfunction, 68% with outlet obstruction) and transit studies (41% with delayed transit). There were no reports of adverse events from the RSB and EMR procedures. The RSB sample volumes were significantly lower than the EMR sample volumes (0.023 cm3 vs 0.26 cm3, P = .001). There was diagnostic tissue for submucosal visualization by RSB in 53% (9/17) of cases compared with 100% (17/17) with EMR (P = .003). No cases of HD were diagnosed by RSB; one patient had rare ganglions observed by EMR. CONCLUSIONS EMR provides greater tissue volume and can improve the characterization of ganglion cells in rectal tissue compared with RSB in patients with moderate to severe constipation with suspected HD.","Barshop, Kenneth; Willingham, Field F; Brugge, William R; Zukerberg, Lawrence R; Kuo, Braden",Gastrointestinal endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gie.2017.08.037; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28893560/,33

However, there is limited evidence for the effectiveness of ChAdOx1 by dose in elderly populations in countries with high prevalence of the Gamma variant of severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Methods We conducted a test-negative case-control study to estimate the effectiveness of ChAdOx1 vaccine in adults aged 60 years or older during a Gamma-variant-associated epidemic in Sao Paulo state, Brazil, between 17 January and 2 July 2021. Cases and matched test-negative controls were individuals, identified from surveillance databases, who experienced an acute respiratory illness and underwent SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing. We used conditional logistic regression to estimate the effectiveness by dose against RT-PCR-confirmed Covid-19, Covid-19 hospitalization, and Covid-19-related death. Results 61,164 individuals were selected into matched case-control pairs. Starting [≥]28 days after the first dose, adjusted effectiveness of a single dose of ChAdOx1 was 33.4% (95% CI, 26.4 to 39.7) against Covid-19, 55.1% (95% CI, 46.6 to 62.2) against hospitalization, and 61.8% (95% CI, 48.9 to 71.4) against death. Starting [≥]14 days after the second dose, the adjusted effectiveness of the two-dose schedule was 77.9% (95% CI, 69.2 to 84.2) against Covid-19, 87.6% (95% CI, 78.2 to 92.9) against hospitalization, and 93.6% (95% CI, 81.9 to 97.7) against death. Conclusions Completion of the ChAdOx1 vaccine schedule afforded significantly increased protection over a single dose against mild and severe Covid-19 outcomes in elderly individuals during widespread Gamma variant transmission.","Hitchings, M.; Ranzani, O.

Most patients now prefer to obtain their doctor's care and check their health status through their mobile phone call, Skype, Facebook Messenger, or other online resources. There is, however, a major concern about the privacy of patients when using online resources. Patients usually choose to keep their information confidential, which should be only accessible to authorized individuals.The most current remote patient monitoring system is organization-centric and patient's privacy and security rely on healthcare providers' mercy. Blockchain technologies have attracted the attention of researchers for designing eHealth applications to provide patients with secure and privacy-preserving health services. Blockchain researchers have recently proposed some models for remote patient monitoring systems. However, most of those researchers have applied public blockchains where health data is available to all participants with the property of data tamper-proof. In this paper, we propose a novel remote patient monitoring model using a decentralized private blockchain to protect patient's privacy and increase the system's efficiency. The private blockchain will be implemented on Hyperledger Fabric where a Patient centric Agents (PCA) manage patient's data and coordinate authorization to form a secure channel to transmit data to the private blockchain. A hybrid consensus by combining Proof of Integrity (PoI) and Proof of Validity (PoV) is used to protect data privacy and integrity when retrieving data from a blockchain-based cloud database. Finally, the Merkle Tree algorithm was used for data processing and authentication when collecting data and uploading it to a cloud database.","Wadud, M. A. H.; Bhuiyan, Tmauh Uddin M. A.; Rahman, M.

In response, the contactless channel (i.e. shopping online, self-collecting and returning parcels via delivery lockers) is ideally positioned to fulfil consumers’ shopping / logistics needs while avoiding all unnecessary social interactions. Thus, this study examines the factors that motivate consumers’ migration to the contactless channel by viewing consumers’ channel choice as both health-related and shopping behaviours. Anchored on the synthesised insights of protection motivation theory and automation acceptance theory, the conceptual framework and a series of hypotheses are proposed. The survey instrument is used for data collection, and the data are analysed using structural equation modelling. Our findings reveal that perceived channel characteristics such as compatibility and trust directly contribute to the relative value of the contactless channel;these characteristics are also correlated where trust perception reinforces compatibility perception. The channel characteristics are further influenced by consumers’ perceived susceptibility of COVID-19;that is, susceptibility perception enhances channel compatibility but decreases consumers’ trust in the contactless channel. However, the impacts of susceptibility become insignificant with a low level of severity perception, confirming the stage-based conceptualisation of severity. Furthermore, the severity perception of COVID-19 is found to amplify the positive impacts of susceptibility perception but attenuate its negative impact. Our study promotes a deeper integration between the health and service literature and encourages more interdisciplinary studies in this nexus. Considering the practical context of social distancing, our findings suggest a struggle between compatibility and trust that shapes consumers’ behaviours.","Wang, Xueqin Diew Wong Yiik Qi Guanqiu Fai Yuen Kum",Electronic Commerce Research and Applications,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.elerap.2021.101075,33

ScopeThis proposal explores the possible and predicted changes to standard operating procedures to the facility management and associated landscape and focuses on series of deployments, during and post peak SARS-CoV-2 activity, and will outline possible models for the current medical facility model that we operate with. This article primarily focuses on non-emergency facility management. Assumptions and understanding of the fieldWith a reduction in the numbers nationally, patients are highly motivated and likely to seek non-emergency and planned medical procedural treatment as early as possible as social distancing measures are eased and restrictions on non-urgent procedures are lifted. Conclusions and next stepsAn initial pan-national shutdown and suspension of services was necessary in an effort to ensure that essential medical services and resources were not strained. The authors feel that a strategic resumption of regular non-emergency treatments around the United States and continued provision of services at care facilities is possible with innovative testing strategies like pooled screening of large populations at a manageable price point. Moreover, pooling as a strategy when used widely, would be extremely effective at predicting outbreaks of the virus and as an effect help in mitigating the spread of the virus in its ""second-wave"".

Methods Demographic, epidemiologic, radiologic and laboratory data were collected by medical record reviews of adult hospitalized patients diagnosed as COVID-19. Cycle threshold (Ct) value data of real-time PCR (RT-PCR) were collected. The time duration was from 21 January to 2 March, 2020. Pulmonary inflammation index (PII) values were used for chest CT findings. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent severity risk factors. RESULTS In total, 84 hospitalized adult patients diagnosed as COVID-19 were included, including 20 severe and 64 nonsevere cases. The viral load of the severe group was significantly higher than that of the non-severe group, regardless of the Ct values for N or ORF1ab gene of virus (all p<0.05).Typical CT abnormalities was more likely existing in the severe group than in the nonsevere group in patchy shadows or ground glass opacities, consolidation, and interlobular septal thickening (all p<0.05). In addition, the PII values in the severe group was significantly higher than that in the nonsevere group (52.5 [42.5-62.5] vs 20 [5.0-31.6]; p<0.001). Amongst 84 patients, 13 patients (15.48%) were noted with abnormal electrocardiograms (ECGs) and serum myocardial enzyme levels; whereas 4 (4.8%) were clinically diagnosed as SARS-CoV-2 myocarditis. Multivariable logistic regress analysis distinguished three key independent risk factors for the severity of COVID-19, including age [OR 2.350; 95% CI (1.206 to 4.580); p=0.012], Ct value [OR 0.158; 95% CI (0.025 to 0.987); p=0.048] and PII [OR 1.912; 95% CI (1.187 to 3.079); p=0.008]. Interpretation Three key-independent risk factors of COVID-19 were identified, including age, PII, and Ct value. The Ct value is closely correlated with the severity of COVID-19, and may act as a predictor of clinical severity of COVID-19 in the early stage. SARS-CoV-2 myocarditis should be highlighted despite a relatively low incidence rate (4.8%). The oxygen pressure and blood oxygen saturation should not be neglected as closely linked with the altitude of epidemic regions.","Ma, Kun-Long; Liu, Zhi-Heng; Cao, Chun-feng; Liu, Ming-Ke; Liao, Juan; Zou, Jing-Bo; Kong, Ling-Xi; Wan, Ke-Qiang; Zhang, Jun; Wang, Qun-Bo; Tian, Wen-Guang; Qin, Guang-Mei; Zhang, Lei; Luan, Fun-Jun; Li, Shi-Ling; Hu, Liang-Bo; Li, Qian-Lu; Wang, Hai-Qiang",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.19.20034124,33

We conduct a case study to analyze data from 390 apartments in New York City to examine the impacts of two key drivers of residential electricity usage: COVID-19 case-loads and the outdoor temperature. We develop a series of regression models to predict two characteristics of residential electricity usage on weekdays: The average occupied apartment’s consumption (kWh) over a 9am-5pm window and the hourly peak demand (Watt) over a 12pm-5pm window. Via a Monte Carlo simulation, we forecast the two usage characteristics under a possible scenario in which stay-at-home orders in NYC, or a similar metropolitan region, coincide with warm summer weather. Under the scenario, the 9am-5pm residential electricity usage on weekdays is predicted to be 15% – 24% higher than under prior, pre-pandemic conditions, which could lead to substantially higher utility costs for residents. Additionally, we predict that the residential hourly peak demand between 12pm and 5pm on weekdays could be 35% – 53% higher than that under pre-pandemic conditions. We conclude that the projected increase in peak demand which might arise if stay-at-home guidelines coincided with hot weather conditions could pose grid management challenges, especially for residential feeders. We also note that, if there is a longer lasting shift towards work and study-from-home, utilities would have to rethink load profile considerations. The applications of our predictive models in managing future smart-grid technology are also highlighted.","Li, Lechen Meinrenken Christoph J.; Modi, Vijay Culligan Patricia J.",Energy and Buildings,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2021.111330,33

Methods: This was a cross-sectional study performed during June-September 2020. A 26-item questionnaire-based survey was disseminated to all 340 junior doctors working in the East Midlands, UK. Relevant data, including participants background, knowledge of corneal donation and the new opt-out system introduced in England, were analysed. Results: A total of 143 responses were received (response rate=42.1%). Nineteen (13.3%) junior doctors had previously discussed about corneal donation. The majority (100, 69.9%) of them perceived the importance of obtaining consent for corneal donation as junior doctors, but only 24 (16.8%) felt comfortable in discussing corneal donation. The knowledge of corneal donation was low, with a mean correct response rate of 33.3+/-20.8%. Only 28 (19.6%) doctors were aware of the 24-hour death-to-enucleation time limit. The majority (116, 81.1%) of doctors would consider certifying a death on the ward quicker if they knew it could potentially compromise the quality of corneas. Most (103, 72%) doctors were aware of the new opt-out system but only 56 (39.2%) doctors correctly stated that donation can only proceed with family consent. Conclusion: Junior doctors working at the frontline services serve as valuable members in contributing to the process of obtaining consent for organ/tissue donation. Our study highlights the lack of knowledge of corneal donation and the opt-out system amongst junior doctors in the UK. Targeted postgraduate training during the induction process may potentially enhance the donation rate.","Gopal, B.; Titi-Lartey, O.

However, little is known about the e-learning approaches that international students apply, or about how they experience the process of e-learning. This article is a critical reflection on the misalignment between an international student’s (Author 1) e-learning behaviours and the expectation of online education. It outlines the autoethnographic method and employs self-study to explore why Author 1 behaves in a certain way with particular reference made to the Biggs’ 3P model. In so doing, the study attempts to shed light on the values and interests of international students that have been silenced in the discourse of e-learning design in Australian universities. With the aim of obtaining a profound insight into the effectiveness of e-learning, the present study challenges the notion that the virtual university is a means of achieving educational equality;it suggests the potential of online education in undermining the social inclusion agenda of internationalised universities. The findings show that while the participant could engage with the curriculum to some extent, there are signs of disconnection, isolation and emotional instability associated with the establishment and development of the e-learning environment. Illustrations of these emerging issues could help educators better understand the downside of e-learning and e-practice by identifying various influential elements, including individuals’ socioeconomic status, cultural heritage and environmental learning settings. The study points out that international students’ education outcomes could be compromised, and expectations could be unfulfilled via e-learning. Thus, there is a further need to prepare learners for e-learning environments. © ACPIL.","Lin, Y.; Nguyen, H.",Electronic Journal of e-Learning,https://doi.org/10.34190/ejel.19.4.2349,33

In connection with the ordinance of the Minister of Health of 13 March 2020 (Journal of Laws of 2020, item 433), announcing the state of epidemic threat in the territory of the Republic of Poland, common units of the prosecutor's office faced a new challenge regarding a quick and effective response to crimes arising in connection with the use of the state of emergency for unlawful purposes. Certainly, for people who act against the law, this is a typical opportunity, a situation that can be used to generate spectacular profits. On the other hand, for law-enforcing organizations, the state of epidemic threat is, if not a crisis, certainly an emergency situation. Apart from the specific dichotomy that emerged as part of the analysis carried out for this article (the relationship between opportunity and crisis), the actions taken in the public entity during the crisis caused by COVID-19 are worth presented. What is the purpose of this study? The study analyses the actions taken by the Polish Public Prosecutor's office in reaction to the crisis, which aim to minimize the spread of not only the virus, but also the criminal activity in Poland. The study consists of 4 parts. The first part is theoretical and describes the issues from management and quality sciences related to both crises and emergency situations. The second part describes the strategic and operational actions taken by organizations in a crisis environment.

168573,The target landscape of N4-hydroxycytidine based on its chemical neighborhood,2020-03-31,"Introduction: To better assess the epidemiological situation of acute respiratory illness in Germany over time, we used emergency department data for syndromic surveillance before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We included routine attendance data from emergency departments who continuously transferred data between week 10-2017 and 10-2021, with ICD-10 codes available for >75% of the attendances. Case definitions for acute respiratory illness (ARI), severe ARI (SARI), influenza-like illness (ILI), respiratory syncytial virus disease (RSV) and Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were based on a combination of ICD-10 codes, and/or chief complaints, sometimes combined with information on hospitalisation and age. Results: We included 1,372,958 attendances from eight emergency departments. The number of attendances dropped in March 2020, increased during summer, and declined again during the resurge of COVID-19 cases in autumn and winter of 2020/2021. A pattern of seasonality of acute respiratory infections could be observed. By using different case definitions (i.e. for ARI, SARI, ILI, RSV) both the annual influenza seasons in the years 2017-2020 and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020-2021 were apparent. The absence of a flu season during the fall and winter of 2020/2021 was visible, in parallel to the resurge of COVID-19 cases. The proportion of SARI among ARI cases peaked in April-May 2020 and November 2020-January 2021. Conclusion: Syndromic surveillance using routine emergency department data has the potential to monitor the trends, timing, duration, magnitude and severity of illness caused by respiratory viruses, including both influenza and SARS-CoV-2.","Boender, T.

169173,Active microrheology using pulsed optical tweezers to probe viscoelasticity of Lamin A towards diagnosis of laminopathies,2021-02-06,"Introduction: Detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) in patient-derived bioaerosol is a potential tool to measure source case infectiousness. However, current bioaerosol sampling approaches have reported low detection yields in sputum-positive TB cases. To increase the utility of bioaerosol sampling, we present advances in bioaerosol collection and Mtb identification that improve detection yields. Methods: A previously described Respiratory Aerosol Sampling Chamber (RASC) protocol, or 'RASC-1', was modified to incorporate liquid collection of bioaerosol using a high-flow wet-walled cyclone (RASC-2). Individuals with GeneXpert-positive pulmonary TB were sampled pre-treatment over 60-minutes. Putative Mtb bacilli were detected in collected fluid by fluorescence microscopy utilising DMN-Trehalose. Exhaled air and bioaerosol volumes were estimated using continuous CO2 monitoring and airborne particle counting, respectively. Mtb capture was calculated per exhaled air volume sampled and bioaerosol volume for RASC-1 (n=35) and for RASC-2 (n=21). Empty chamber samples were collected between patients as controls. Results: The optimised RASC-2 protocol sampled a median of 258.4L (IQR: 226.9-273.6) of exhaled air per patient compared with 27.5L (IQR: 23.6-30.3) for RASC-1 (p<0.0001). Bioaerosol volume collection was estimated at 2.3nL (IQR: 1.1-3.6) for RASC-2 compared with 0.08nL (IQR: 0.05-0.10) for RASC-1 (p<0.0001). The detection yield of viable Mtb improved from 43% (median 2 CFU, range: 1-14) to 95% (median 20.5 DMN-Trehalose positive bacilli, range: 2-155). These improvements represent a lowering of the limit of detection in the RASC-2 platform to 0.9 Mtb bacilli per 100L of exhaled air from 3.3 Mtb bacilli per 100L (RASC-1). Conclusion: This study demonstrates that technical improvements in particle collection together with sensitive detection enable rapid quantitation of viable Mtb in bioaerosols of sputum positive TB cases. Increased sampling sensitivity may allow future TB transmission studies to be extended to sputum-negative and subclinical individuals, and suggests the potential utility of bioaerosol measurement for rapid intervention in other airborne infectious diseases.","Patterson, B.

170741,Reusability and composability in process description maps: RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK signalling,2020-12-08,"Purpose: The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered a time of crisis and uncertainty for the air transportation industry. The gloomy prospects for the industry have stretched business resilience to a critical point. The crisis has caused damage and shock that the aviation industry has never endured before. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of both internally and externally generated airline response strategies by examining business practices for crisis management. Design/methodology/approach: This study screened research papers and economic reports from authoritative organizations including the International Air Transport Association, International Civil Aviation Organization, World Health Organization and United Nations World Tourism Organization from December 2019 (the month in which the COVID-19 outbreak occurred) to March 2021 (the most recent month at present). The authors also integrated publicly recognized news articles to cover a wide range of business practices in the airline industry. The authors conducted thematic analysis by filtering news articles and economic reports that mentioned the keywords “COVID-19,” “pandemic,” “CoV-2,” “coronavirus” and “corona.” The authors coded the airlines’ response actions along the two-axis matrix (time and magnitude) and generated insights in a timely manner. Findings: Major airlines have modified decision-making in relation to the exponential spread of the virus, which is in direct proportion to the deterioration level in the airline industry. When the impact was low in the early stage, major airlines maintained their status quo. Before long, the magnitude of the destruction became high, which made airlines implement capacity adjustments and request government relief measures. As industrial deterioration deepens, airlines keep calling for state aid packages and have changed their focus to the cargo transportation of high-demand commodities and pharmaceutical supplies. Lastly, industrial adversity and uncertainty have made them defer aggressive takeover opportunities. Originality/value: Several researchers have investigated the impacts of the COVID-19 on the airline industry. However, there remains a dearth of scholarship on the hampered business activities and crisis management of the airline industry. In the absence of sufficient response strategies against the COVID-19 panic, this paper is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the major airlines’ response strategies to the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, this paper yields an opportunity for on-site management to review how major global airlines have responded to the crisis and find managerial insights to restore their business sustainability. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Suk, M.; Kim, W.",Tourism Review,https://doi.org/10.1108/tr-07-2020-0348,33

It is crucial for the scientific community to use data reported by independent territories worldwide. This study evaluates the reliability of the pandemic data disclosed by 182 countries worldwide. We collected and assessed conformity of COVID-19 daily infections, deaths, tests, and vaccinations with Benford’s law since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. It is commonly accepted that the frequency of leading digits of the pandemic data shall conform to Benford’s law. Our analysis of Benfordness elicits that most countries partially distributed reliable data over the past eighteen months. Notably, the UK, Australia, Spain, Israel, and Germany, followed by 22 different nations, provided the most reliable COVID-19 data within the same period. In contrast, twenty-six nations, including Tajikistan, Belarus, Bangladesh, and Myanmar, published less reliable data on the coronavirus spread. In this context, over 31% of countries worldwide seem to have improved reliability. Our measurement of Benfordness moderately correlates with Johns Hopkin’s Global Health Security Index, suggesting that the quality of data may depend on national healthcare policies and systems. We conclude that economically or politically distressed societies have declined in conformity to the law over time. Our results are particularly relevant for policymakers worldwide.","Farhadi, Noah Lahooti Hooshang",COVID,https://doi.org/10.3390/covid1010013,33

Previous research has indicated UV-C radiation to be effective for inactivation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), the virus that caused an outbreak of SARS in 2003. Given the structural similarities of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), it is anticipated that UV radiation should be effective for inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 too. Recently published data support this assertion, but only for a narrow set of exposure and matrix conditions. Models based on genomic and other characteristics of viruses have been developed to provide predictions of viral inactivation responses to UV exposure at lambda = 254 nm. The predictions of these models are consistent with reported measurements of viral inactivation, including for SARS-CoV-2. As such, current information indicates that UV-C irradiation should be effective for control of SARS-CoV-2, as well as for control of other coronaviruses;however, additional research is needed to quantify the effects of several important process variables, including the wavelength of radiation, the effects of relative humidity on airborne and surface-associated viruses, and the effects of the medium of exposure.","Ernest, R.

In COVID-19 disease, very small differences in the oxygen saturation reading result in signifcant differences in the way that the patient is managed, so it is important to be aware of the factors that can affect these readings. It is also important to appreciate that a low reading in a patient with suspected or confrmed COVID-19 disease may be the result of another disease process.","Silverston, Paul",Practice Nursing,https://doi.org/10.12968/pnur.2021.32.8.312,33

The complexities of COVID-19 since the end of 2019 and throughout 2020 left a mouth full and the second wave has not least to be said. The purpose of this article is to challenge the response of the church in a time when her voice is mostly needed. During the lockdown Level 5, churches were amongst the many trends that had to close their doors to the believers and the community. This was a great shock because churches throughout history have been known as safe havens and anchorages. Churches helped with answers to unanswered questions, and in some instances, confessional statements and creeds were born. In the case of COVID-19, a lot of conspiracy theories went viral about COVID-19 and the vaccines that were still in their research stage. Lots of speculations rose as to the cause of this pandemic. The implementation of 5G was viewed as the cause of the coronavirus at the beginning of 2020, and much had to be done to correct this fallacy. Another controversial fallacy was the link of the vaccination with the beast’s mark, as was recently also insinuated in Chief Justice’s prayer. Questions have already been asked, what is the voice of the church in this regard? Congregation deals with this in different ways. Hence the relevance to the question, how timely can exegesis be to contemporary ecclesiology? What would be relevant hermeneutics that could assist in embodying faith in a corona-defined world? Contribution: This article strives to develop an interpretation of 666 that could be relevant to the questions asked and suggest a way forward in embodying faith in a corona-defined world and beyond.","Letšosa, Rantoa",Hervormde Teologiese Studies,https://doi.org/10.4102/hts.v77i4.6480,33
173829,"Progress of the Delta variant and erosion of vaccine effectiveness, a warning from Utah",2021-08-10,"Introduction: The 2020 Royal College of Anaesthetists’ report Guidelines for the Provision of Anaesthesia Services for an Obstetric Population states that “working on delivery units can be incredibly rewarding for obstetric anaesthetists… but it can also be highly challenging”.1 Anecdotally, it is recognised that many juniors feel unprepared when first rotating into obstetric anaesthesia. Local trainees highlighted that, whilst induction to their obstetric rotation was useful, they felt unprepared for the practical aspects of the job;the different anaesthetic techniques and also the change in working environment with an unfamiliar multidisciplinary team dynamic. Furthermore, the unfamiliar obstetric terms meant that many felt they had little confidence and struggled to ’catch up’ to where they felt they needed to be to work comfortably. We decided to arrange a one-day teaching programme for trainees who were about to rotate into obstetrics to address these shortcomings and demystify some aspects of labour ward. Methods: A survey was sent to core trainees across South Wales to identify interest in the course and main areas of concern. These areas were: anaesthetic techniques, labour ward ‘tips and tricks’, communication and team-working, basic obstetric physiology and jargon-busting, basics of cardiotocography, management of obstetric emergencies, and topics relevant to the Primary FRCA. Colleagues from anaesthetics, obstetrics and midwifery kindly agreed to provide this teaching via lectures, interactive small-group skills stations and faculty-led demonstrations. Delegate numbers were restricted to 12 due to COVID-19 social distancing regulations and a small fee was charged to cover personal protective equipment costs, lunch and refreshments. Results: In the pre-course questionnaire, 91% of respondents felt they would benefit from a course, 63% felt between ‘ambivalent’ and ‘very uncomfortable’ with their understanding for how labour ward works, 54% were ‘uncomfortable’ with their technical skills relating to obstetric anaesthesia, 77% were not comfortable with managing obstetric emergencies and 64% were not comfortable with obstetric terminology and jargon. Post-course feedback was as follows: 86% of candidates reported feeling ‘somewhat’ or ‘very comfortable’ with how labour ward worked. 86% felt confident in their obstetric technical skills, 72% felt confident managing obstetric emergencies and 100% of respondents were comfortable with obstetric terminology. Discussion: We are not aware of any teaching programme in our region for trainees rotating into obstetrics for the first time. Our aim was to address the anxieties identified by junior trainees by providing additional teaching to enhance induction into working on labour ward. The BOAST course was attended by trainees from several hospitals across South Wales. Feedback was extremely positive and as a result we plan to run the course twice a year to facilitate up-to-date teaching for those rotating into obstetric departments.","Ebejer, A.; Newton, T.; Jenkins, N.",International Journal of Obstetric Anesthesia,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijoa.2021.103087,33

In the UK, as of August 2021, they have not been approved, except in a few limited circumstances. To date, little qualitative research exists to explain the reasons and nuances behind public attitudes on this issue. Methods Qualitative group and one-to-one online interviews were conducted with a diverse sample of 24 adults to explore their views on the issue of COVID-19 vaccination in children. Results COVID-19 vaccination in children was framed as a complex problem (a 'minefield'). Six themes emerged to explain participants views: (1) Uncertainty over whether children can catch, transmit or be severely harmed by COVID-19; (2) Lower risk tolerance for unknown longer-term effects of the vaccine in children; (3) Association of the vaccine program with government's handling of the pandemic; (4) Local social norms as a driver of hesitancy; (5) Vaccinating children as a way to protect vulnerable adults; (6) Children's vaccination as parental choice. Conclusions Public attitudes to COVID-19 vaccination in children are likely to be met with more hesitancy compared to adult vaccinations. Public health communications will need to combat this hesitancy if vaccine uptake for children is to be pursued as a public health policy.","Williams, S.

174087,Proteome organization of COVID-19: Illustrating targets for vaccine development,2020,"In operating rooms (OR), the transport of Colony-Forming Units (CFU) can generate surgical site infections in patients and, as a consequence, CFU must be properly evacuated from the surgical site. Moreover, fine particles (FP) and ultrafine particles (UFP) can be generated during surgeries by cutting and cauterizing surgical tools, with consequent effects on the health of patients and medical staff. Therefore, indoor air quality, comfort and safety conditions in OR must take into account CFU, FP and UFP concentrations. Due to the importance of the topic, the authors have carried out a review of experimental, numerical and experimental-numerical combined works available in the literature, that analyse generation, diffusion and deposition of CFU, FP and UFP in ORs. Numerical studies have been majorly focused on the simulation of CFU using computational fluid dynamics, in order to model the motion inside ORs and the evaluation of factors that influence it. Experimental studies mainly deal with the analysis of particles and CFU motion and deposition. Based on the present analysis, it appears that more research effort is needed to analyse FP and UFP in ORs. Technical standards and national laws have been reviewed in order to analyse the constraints commonly used in the design and operation of ORs and ventilation systems, and to find the technical aspects that are not yet properly considered.","D039,; Alicandro, Andrea Carlo Massarotti Nicola Mauro Alessandro",Journal of Aerosol Science,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaerosci.2021.105823,33

The purpose of this study is to investigate the readiness on the part of teachers to switch/adopt online teaching as a part of their pedagogy. Also, this study analyses relationship between perceived stress (PS) and readiness to change (RTC)/adopt.Design/methodology/approachAll the constructs were adapted from established scales, exploratory factor analysis confirmed item loadings on the appropriate constructs. Convenience sampling was used for data collection;owing to COVID-19 this appeared to be the only viable method. Partial least square structural equation modelling was used for analysis of data.FindingsResults from this study indicate that 32.2% variance in RTC is accounted for by exogenous constructs perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use and autonomy (AUT). Although f2 effect size pointed towards non-significance of AUT in predicting RTC (path coefficients were found to be significant for all the exogenous constructs). Also, RTC accounted for 32.6% variance in PS. To assess the predictive relevance of the model, blindfolding procedure was used to obtain Q2 values (Q2PS = 0.231;Q2RTC = 0.243). Positive Q2 values provide support for the model’s predictive relevance.Research limitations/implicationsData were collected from teachers employed in urban public schools. A complete picture can be obtained by involving teachers from rural public and state-run schools.Practical implicationsTeachers’ readiness to adopt online teaching as a part of their pedagogy may act as a starting point for the policymakers to design properly structured training programs for teachers that minimise stress levels.Social implicationsIf not handled properly, the society may end with either loss of learning to one generation or a major chunk of stressed-out teaching populations or both.Originality/valueTo the best of the author’s knowledge, this study is probably the first one focusing on sudden shift to online teaching and PS.","Mehta, Prashant",Corporate Governance,https://doi.org/10.1108/cg-09-2020-0385,33

Several studies examining whether human genetic variation can affect gut microbiota suggest a complex combination of environmental and host factors. Here, we leverage a single large-scale population-based cohort of 5,959 genotyped individuals with matched gut microbial shotgun metagenomes, dietary information and health records up to 16 years post-sampling, to characterize human genetic variations associated with microbial abundances, and predict possible causal links with various diseases using Mendelian randomization (MR). Genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified 583 independent SNP-taxon associations at genome-wide significance (p<5.0x10-8), which included notable strong associations with LCT (p=5.02x10-35), ABO (p=1.1x10-12), and MED13L (p=1.84x10-12). A combination of genetics and dietary habits was shown to strongly shape the abundances of certain key bacterial members of the gut microbiota, and explain their genetic association. Genetic effects from the LCT locus on Bifidobacterium and three other associated taxa significantly differed according to dairy intake. Variation in mucin-degrading Faecalicatena lactaris abundances were associated with ABO, highlighting a preferential utilization of secreted A/B/AB-antigens as energy source in the gut, irrespectively of fibre intake. Enterococcus faecalis levels showed a robust association with a variant in MED13L, with putative links to colorectal cancer. Finally, we identified putative causal relationships between gut microbes and complex diseases using MR, with a predicted effect of Morganella on major depressive disorder that was consistent with observational incident disease analysis. Overall, we present striking examples of the intricate relationship between humans and their gut microbial communities, and highlight important health implications.","Qin, Y.; Havulinna, A.

We evaluated the association between asthma and COVID-19 at an individual level. METHODS: Using data from prospective clinical registries, we conducted a nested case-control study comparing three groups: children with COVID-19 and underlying asthma (""A+C"" cases); children with COVID-19 without underlying disease (""C+"" controls); and children with asthma without COVID-19 (""A+"" controls). RESULTS: The cohort included 142 A+C cases, 1110 C+ controls, and 140 A+ controls. A+C cases were more likely than C+ controls to present with dyspnea and wheezing, to receive pharmacologic treatment including systemic steroids (all p<0.01), and to be hospitalized (4.9% vs 1.7%, p=0.01). In the adjusted analysis, A+C cases were nearly 4 times more likely to be hospitalized than C+ controls (adjusted OR=3.95 [95%CI=1.4-10.9]); however, length of stay and respiratory support level did not differ between groups. Among A+C cases, 8.5% presented with an asthma exacerbation and another 6.3% developed acute exacerbation symptoms shortly after testing positive for SARS-CoV-2. Compared to historic A+ controls, A+C cases had less severe asthma, were less likely to be on controller medications, and had better asthma symptom control (all p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: In our cohort, asthma was a risk factor for hospitalization in children with COVID-19, but not for worse COVID-19 outcomes.

176707,#Goasco20: success of a new twitter hashtag to promote gynaecological oncology specific information during asco 2020 virtual annual meeting,2020,"Text analytics directly on compression (TADOC) has proven to be a promising technology for big data analytics. GPUs are extremely popular accelerators for data analytics systems. Unfortunately, no work so far shows how to utilize GPUs to accelerate TADOC. We describe G-TADOC, the first framework that provides GPU-based text analytics directly on compression, effectively enabling efficient text analytics on GPUs without decompressing the input data. G-TADOC solves three major challenges. First, TADOC involves a large amount of dependencies, which makes it difficult to exploit massive parallelism on a GPU. We develop a novel fine-grained thread-level workload scheduling strategy for GPU threads, which partitions heavily-dependent loads adaptively in a fine-grained manner. Second, in developing G-TADOC, thousands of GPU threads writing to the same result buffer leads to inconsistency while directly using locks and atomic operations lead to large synchronization overheads. We develop a memory pool with thread-safe data structures on GPUs to handle such difficulties. Third, maintaining the sequence information among words is essential for lossless compression. We design a sequence-support strategy, which maintains high GPU parallelism while ensuring sequence information. Our experimental evaluations show that G-TADOC provides 31.1x average speedup compared to state-of-the-art TADOC.","Zhang, Feng; Pan, Zaifeng; Zhou, Yanliang; Zhai, Jidong; Shen, Xipeng; Mutlu, Onur; Du, Xiaoyong",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.06889v1.pdf,33
176822,Simulated hands-on laboratory instruction for fluid power systems,2021,"Purpose: Guided by resource-based theory, this investigation examines the extent to which knowledge sharing as part of interfirm collaboration serves as a performance-enhancing strategy;that is, in the context of assisting ethnic minority-owned urban restaurants to survive during a major market disruption. Specifically, the study features owner-managers' perceptions concerning the evolving environmental circumstances associated with the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Design/methodology/approach: Data collection took place among owner-managers of urban restaurants in a Canadian city during the COVID-19 pandemic in late 2020. This featured semi-structured interviews with restaurants' owner-managers originating from various ethnic origins together with secondary data where possible. Data analysis followed an adapted Gioia approach. Findings: Examples of interfirm collaboration include restaurants' owner-managers leveraging social capital and sharing knowledge about the effects of legislation and health guidelines on operating procedures, together with good and bad practices where firms have pivoted their business models via take-outs, patio dining and in-room dining. Irrespective of the strength of network ties (within and across ethnic communities), owner-managers were motivated to share information to facilitate their survival. Nevertheless, this study raises questions over the extent that certain decision-makers exhibit strategic flexibility responding to environmental conditions together with their respective ability to engage/retain customers plus service-oriented employees. In addition, a question is whether some owner-managers will continue to collaborate with their competitors after COVID-19 ends, and if so, with whom and the magnitude of activities. In particular, “trust” via psychological contracts and “complementary strategies” among partners across coethnic and different ethnic origins are key considerations. Originality/value: A body of knowledge exists addressing the notions of both interfirm collaboration and market disruptions in the broader cross-disciplinary literature. However, the interfirm collaborative practices of small firms with ethnic minority ownership that are otherwise rivals remain under-researched. More specifically, interfirm collaboration as a survival strategy for owner-managers during the market disruption arising from a crisis situation features as an original contribution. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Crick, J.

177482,Understanding draws in elo rating algorithm,2020,"Global educational systems had not anticipated that one day, overnight, they would have to move their traditional teaching to online learning. This move was disruptive and highlighted the need for future educational systems designed to bridge the gap between face-to-face (f2f) and online learning with minimal disruption. We present statistical evidence that learners in flippedf2f classes did not experience disruption when moved fully online. On the contrary, we found that our two measures of disruption, student satisfaction with learning and student engagement, improved when the flipped classes were moved fully online. This we attribute to the focus on student learning using computer-based materials that is part of flipped learning. While there are classes unsuitable for flipping, the pandemic has demonstrated that all classes can be taught online. This suggests that a greater emphasis on using computers for learning in traditional f2f classes will make them less vulnerable to future natural or man-made disasters that may force an unexpected transition to online learning. © 2021, North American Business Press.

This syndrome became known as severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The sudden appearance and rapid global spread of SARS-CoV-2 led world health organization (who) to declare it as a pandemic disease on March 11 2020. We will report the first case COVID-19 in South Kalimantan. case: a 44-year-old man was presented with fever 7 days before admission. The patient also complained about cough with white phlegm and shortness of breath accompanied by nausea with heartburn and decreased of appetite. He confessed that he just returned from local transmission areas of COVID-19. From physical examination it was found sao2 92% room air with bronchial sounds and ronchi in the lung. Chest x-ray showed peripheral infiltrates and diagnostic swab with rt-PCR in the oropharynx and nasopharynx showed that the patient was infected with SARS-CoV-2. HbsAg marker on this patient was also reactive. The patient then received supportive therapy as well as antiviral therapy. After 10 days of treatment the patient was already free from the symptom, but swab evaluation remained positive. On the 31st day of treatment the patient was finally declared cured with a negative swab result. Conclusion: the number of COVID-19 cases has increased from time to time. Holistic treatment and rapid detection greatly affect the prognosis of this disease. Prevention through health protocols is also very important to reduce its spread.","Muhammad, Nor; Haryati, Haryati",Jurnal Respirasi,https://doi.org/10.20473/jr.v6-i.3.2020.67-74,33

Gastrointestinal (GI) manifestations are common in patients with COVID-19 due to the high viral load lodged in the small intestine's mucosa. As a result, it causes an increase in the permeability of the intestinal barrier that favours the passage and translocation of bacteria, from the lumen of the intestine, towards the internal environment, with the appearance of sepsis, with evidence that SARS-CoV-2 has been found in faeces. This article highlights epidemiology, clinical symptoms, and mechanisms related to manifestations of disease in the GI tract and its pathogenesis in patients with COVID-19. It highlights bacterial translocation and COVID-19, mechanisms that control bacterial translocation, intestinal infection and feco-oral transmission, defense mechanisms against microbial invasion, role of microbiota/microbiome and implications of their dysbiosis and alterations during SARS-CoV-2 infection, and lastly protective health benefits by improving dietary habits with nutritional foods approaches amid the ongoing pandemic. Increasing evidence indicates that bacterial translocation appears due to the high viral load of COVID-19 in the mucosa of the GI tract, and the intestinal microbiota contributes to the COVID-19 course owing to their bidirectional relationship with the immune system and lungs. Dysbiosis in gut microbiota leads to increased gut permeability thus predisposing to secondary infection and multiple organ dysfunction. Disruption of intestinal barrier integrity due to dysbiosis may cause translocation of SARS-CoV-2 from lungs into the intestinal lumen via the circulatory and lymphatic system, initiating severe clinical presentation of the infection. A thorough understanding of the key role of gut microbiota, gastrointestinal symptoms, and pathology along with immunomodulatory approaches would help in alleviating morbidity and mortality during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. © 2021, Editorial board of Journal of Experimental Biology and Agricultural Sciences.","Valero-Cedeño, N.; Álava, D.; Rodríguez, R.; Chacín, M.; Cabrera-Hernández, M.; Véliz-Castro, T.; Carrero, Y.; Bermúdez, V.; Rodriguez-Morales, A.

We set out to explore whether Chinese people believe in pandemic-related conspiracy theories, and if so, how do their secure (in-group identification) and defensive (collective narcissism) in-group positivity predict their conspiracy beliefs. We hypothesized that national identification would negatively predict the tendency to attribute responsibility to an in-group, thus predicting less risk-rejection conspiracy theory beliefs (e.g., COVID-19 is a hoax). In contrast, national collective narcissism would positively predict the tendency to attribute responsibility for the pandemic to an out-group, which in turn would validate conspiracy theories that acknowledge the risk of the pandemic (e.g., COVID-19 is a bioweapon). To test these predictions, we collected data in China (n = 1,200) in April 2020. Supporting our predictions, national identification was negatively associated with risk-rejection conspiracy beliefs via in-group attribution, whereas national collective narcissism was positively associated with risk-acceptance conspiracy beliefs via out-group attribution. © The Author(s) 2021.","Wang, X.; Zuo, S.

In the last decade, the pace at which sustainable and resilient mobility strategies were developed grew significantly due to the spread of technologies (such as ITS systems) and digital platforms related to Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS). These strategies might improve the overall efficiency of the transport system and reduce dependence on private cars in urban area. Moreover, the development of the demand responsive transport (DRT) is one of the solutions for planning end-to-end travel according to the transport needs. Actually DRT, such as the other shared modes, appears more convenient and capable to turn private car superfluous, reducing traffic congestion and noise and atmospheric pollution levels. After a review of the state of the art in literature, this paper shows the results of a descriptive and a preliminary analysis of DRT services in Italy. In particular, in the studied areas, the authors detected the type of service given and its national displacement, the category of users, the kind of stops, the fleet of vehicles and the presence of shared mobility services. Finally, the authors assessed the possibility to include these services within the Maas platforms suggesting some possible strategies for optimizing the implementation of intelligent mobility systems at Italian national level. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Campisi, T.; Garau, C.; Acampa, G.; Maltinti, F.; Canale, A.; Coni, M.","21st International Conference on Computational Science and Its Applications, ICCSA 2021",https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-86979-3_24,33

Restrictive and obstructive lung disorders are a large contributor to decreased lung function, as well as the acute impact of infection. Measures of pulmonary function are heritable, and thus, we sought to utilise genomics to propose novel drug repurposing candidates which could improve respiratory outcomes. Lung function measures were found to be genetically correlated with metabolic and hormone traits which could be pharmacologically modulated, with a causal effect of increased fasting glucose on diminished lung function supported by latent causal variable models and Mendelian randomisation. We developed polygenic scores for lung function specifically within pathways with known drug targets to prioritise individuals who may benefit from particular drug repurposing opportunities, accompanied by transcriptome-wide association studies to identify drug-gene interactions with potential lung function increasing modes of action. These drug repurposing candidates were further considered relative to the host-viral interactome of three viruses with associated respiratory pathology (SARS-CoV2, influenza, and human adenovirus). We uncovered an enrichment amongst glycaemic pathways of human proteins which putatively interact with virally expressed SARS-CoV2 proteins, suggesting that antihyperglycaemic agents may have a positive effect both on lung function and SARS-CoV2 progression.","Reay, W.

Children are divided into two groups: I -children with previously established mental disorders;II - children who have not previously been observed for developmental disorder by a psychiatrist.ResultsParents of children applied for counselling with complaints of psychological, neurotic and psychosomatic symptoms that were present in children during the period of lockdown. It was found that the active use of electronic gadgets, an abundance of alarming information from the media, can cause disturbances in the family system and become an additional risk factor in the developmental disorders and an increase in the existing psychopathological symptoms in children. However, in young children with normative development and in some children with autism spectrum disorder, the phenomenon of social isolation did not reveal any pronounced changes in the mental state towards deterioration;on the contrary, in a number of cases there is a weakening of previously manifested deviations, apparently associated with increased communication with the loved ones and increased parental attention.ConclusionsClinical and psychological services should offer preventive support to the entire family.DisclosureNo significant relationships.","Ivanov, M.; Kotlyarov, V.; Kozlovskaya, G.; Kremneva, L.; Kalinina, M.; Krylatova, T.",European Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1192/j.eurpsy.2021.1772,33

The screening of these molecules included a molecular docking approach within the Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor. In addition, drug-likeness, ADMET analysis and pharmacophore mapping have been performed. The result of the docking process was based on the energy binding values as well as the number and type of interactions established with the receptor active site residues, which were compared with those of co-crystallized ligand and chloroquine. Febrifugine showed the most interesting energetic and interactive activities that were closer to the reference molecule and better than those of chloroquine. Whereas artemisinin has produced results that are the closest to those of chloroquine. Similarly, drug-likeness and ADMET analysis have shown that febrifugine and artemisinin check most of the filters and pharmacokinetic properties required for the choice of an effective therapeutic molecule. A pharmacophore model was designed on the basis of a training set consisting of the most relevant molecules;it has one metal ligator cum hydrophobic region cum hydrogen bond acceptor, one hydrogen bond acceptor cum metal ligator and one hydrophobic aromatic ring.

The High Dose quadrivalent influenza vaccine (QIV HD) is a flu vaccine containing 4 times the antigens of a Standard Dose vaccine, resulting in demonstrated superior protection in the population aged 65 years and over. Methods: The analysis has been conducted from the perspective of the NHS. The CEA focuses on the comparison between QIV HD and the QIV SD vaccine. The BIM aims to estimate the potential economic impact for the National Health Service (NHS) resulting from the use of QIV HD in clinical practice in subjects aged 65 or over, when considering its introduction in combination with currently used vaccines, QIV SD and adjuvanted TIV. Results: In a scenario which considers hospitalizations possibly related to influenza, so including cardio-respiratory events, a dominant cost-effectiveness profile emerges in the comparison with QIV SD. In terms of budget impact, overall savings obtained by comparing the two scenarios regarding hospitalizations are equal to 92,766,429 (sic) over the three years' time horizon considered in the analysis. Conclusions: Nowadays, also considering the state of emergency due to the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, it is crucial to implement innovative health technologies that improve the efficiency and sustainability of the health system. Also, it is essential to protect the elderly population, helping to avoid overload and healthcare systems disruption due to the many COVID-19 hospitalizations.","Rumi, F.; Basile, M.; Cicchetti, A.",Global & Regional Health Technology Assessment,https://doi.org/10.33393/grhta.2021.2247,33

This paper examines the age and sex distribution of the morbidity and mortality rate in children with COVID-19 and compares it to the adult population within 15 Sub-Saharan African countries. Methods: A merge line listing dataset using a reverse engineering model shared by countries within the Regional Office for Africa was analyzed. Patients diagnosed within 1 March 2020 and 1 September 2020 with confirmed positive RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 were analyzed. Children data were stratified into three age groups: 0-4 years, 5-11 years, and 12-17 years, while adults were combined. The cumulative incidence of cases including its medians and 95% confidence intervals were calculated. Results: 9% of the total confirmed cases and 2.4% of the reported deaths were pediatric cases. The 12-17 age group in all 15 countries showed the highest cumulative incidence proportion in children. COVID-19 cases in males and females under the age of 18 were evenly distributed. Among adults, a higher case incidence per 100,000 people was observed compared to children. Conclusion: The cases and deaths within the children population was smaller than the adult population. These differences can reflect biases in COVID-19 testing protocols and reporting implemented by countries, highlighting the need for more extensive investigation and focus on the effects of COVID-19 in children.","Rodriguez Velasquez, S.; Jacques, L.; Dalal, J.; Sestito, P.; Habibi, Z.; Venkatasubramanian, A.; Nguimbis, B.; Botero Mesa, S.; Chimbetete, C.; Keiser, O.; Impouma, B.; Mboussou, F.; William, G.

This transcript, named virus-inducible ncRNA (VINC), is identical to a 3.18 kb transcript expressed in mouse neonate skin (GenBank accession no. AK028745) that, together with a number of unannotated cDNAs and expressed sequence tags, is grouped in the mouse unigene cluster Mm281895. VINC is expressed constitutively in early mouse embryo and several adult non-neuronal mouse tissues, as well as a murine renal adenocarcinoma (RAG) cell line. Northern blotting of nuclear and cytoplasmic RNAs revealed that VINC is localized primarily in the nucleus of RAG cells and is thus a novel member of the nuclear ncRNA family.","Saha, Sougata; Murthy, Sreenivasa; Rangarajan, Pundi N",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16760401/,33
187732,In brief: Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine suspended.,2021-05-03,"We have developed a rapid and sensitive microimmunodot blot assay, the antigen spot test (AST), for the detection of bovine coronavirus (BCV) antigen from neonatal calf fecal samples. The AST procedure can be completed in 3.5 h, whereas the previously reported immunodot blot assays require 10 to 12 h. Ninety-six samples can be tested per membrane, and 10 membranes (960 samples) may be processed by a single technologist in 1 working day. The effects of detergents, oxidizing chemicals, chaotropic agents, and enzyme substrates in improving the sensitivity and signal-to-noise ratio of the AST were studied. Finally, the sensitivity and specificity of AST for the detection of BCV antigen were compared to those of a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA) and a hemagglutination assay (HA). Of 347 field samples tested by all three methods, 94.2% were positive by AST, 91.4% were positive by ELISA, and 86.7% were positive by HA. The sensitivity of the AST was determined to be 100% compared to the results of the ELISA reference method. The specificity of the AST was 67%, which reflects a lower limit of detection of 10(4) viral particles per ml in a 10% fecal suspension.","Gaber, F; Kapil, S",Clinical and diagnostic laboratory immunology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10391859/,33

In contrast to small intestine, tongue epithelium is less sensitive to postmortem changes. Sections of tongue and small intestine from 11 dogs and 11 cats with a clinical history and gross and microscopic lesions compatible with canine and feline parvoviral infection were examined for parvoviral infection using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), immunohistochemistry (IHC), and direct fluorescent antibody testing (FA). Parvoviral DNA was detected by PCR in both small intestine and tongue of all but 1 dog. Nineteen of 22 animals (86%) with suspect or positive FA staining in the small intestine also had positive FA and IHC staining in the tongue. Three of 3 dogs (100%) whose carcasses had been frozen and thawed prior to necropsy had more consistently positive staining in tongue than in small intestine by FA and IHC. These data confirm tongue as an excellent complementary sample for parvoviral testing in dogs and cats, especially in cases in which postmortem autolysis has occurred.","McKnight, Christy A; Maes, Roger K; Wise, Annabel G; Kiupel, Matti","Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17609353/,33

In Singapore alone, there have been 238 SARS cases and 33 deaths, including 5 health care workers. With modern global inter-connectivity, SARS rapidly spread to become a worldwide phenomenon. This article describes the Singapore ""war on SARS"" from an emergency physician's perspective, focusing on the ""prevent, detect and isolate"" strategy. Notable innovations include the use of home quarantine orders, mass temperature screening using thermal imaging, modular systems of hospital staffing, ""virtual"" hospital visits, and innovations in emergency department design. Most emergency departments, hospitals and health care systems appear to be psychologically and logistically unprepared for a massive infectious disease outbreak. In light of recent natural and terrorism-related threats, emergency care providers around the world must adopt a new paradigm.

188367,The State Laboratory of Hygiene's role in terrorism preparedness and response.,2003,"In an open surgery, identification of precise margins for curative tissue resection is performed by manual palpation. This is not the case for minimally invasive and robotic procedures, where tactile feedback is either distorted or not available. In this paper, we introduce the concept of intraoperative wireless tissue palpation. The wireless palpation probe (WPP) is a cylindrical device (15 mm in diameter, 60 mm in length) that can be deployed through a trocar incision and directly controlled by the surgeon to create a volumetric stiffness distribution map of the region of interest. This map can then be used to guide the tissue resection to minimize healthy tissue loss. The wireless operation prevents the need for a dedicated port and reduces the chance of instrument clashing in the operating field. The WPP is able to measure in real time the indentation pressure with a sensitivity of 34 Pa, the indentation depth with an accuracy of 0.68 mm, and the probe position with a maximum error of 11.3 mm in a tridimensional workspace. The WPP was assessed on the benchtop in detecting the local stiffness of two different silicone tissue simulators (elastic modulus ranging from 45 to 220 kPa), showing a maximum relative error below 5%. Then, in vivo trials were aimed to identify an agar-gel lump injected into a porcine liver and to assess the device usability within the frame of a laparoscopic procedure. The stiffness map created intraoperatively by the WPP was compared with a map generated ex vivo by a standard uniaxial material tester, showing less than 8% local stiffness error at the site of the lump.","Beccani, Marco; Di Natali, Christian; Sliker, Levin J; Schoen, Jonathan A; Rentschler, Mark E; Valdastri, Pietro",IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23974523/,33
188380,A Bayesian dynamic model for influenza surveillance.,2006,"The genomes of umbraviruses differ from those of most other viruses in that they do not encode a coat protein, and thus no virus particles are formed in infected plants. Protection of umbraviral RNA outside the host plant, during vector transmission, utilizes the coat protein of an assistor luteovirus, but this review focuses on the mechanisms that compensate for the lack of a coat protein in processes within the host plant. As well as an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, umbravirus genomes encode two other proteins from almost completely overlapping open reading frames. One of these is a cell-to-cell movement protein that can mediate the transport of homologous and heterologous viral RNAs through plasmodesmata without the participation of a coat protein. The other, the ORF3 protein, binds to viral RNA to form filamentous ribonucleoprotein particles that have elements of helical structure. It serves to stabilize the RNA and facilitates its transport through the vascular system of the plant. It may also be involved in protection of the viral RNA from the plant's defensive RNA-silencing response, although it is not a suppressor of silencing. The ORF3 protein also enters the cell nucleus, specifically targeting the nucleolus. Although the function of this localization is unknown, the ORF3 protein may provide a valuable tool for investigating plant nucleolar function.","Taliansky, Michael E; Robinson, David J",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12867625/,33

189860,Reply to letter to the editor.,2014,"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) replicates in the cytoplasm of infected cells, but its nucleocapsid (N) protein localizes specifically to the nucleus and nucleolus. The mechanism of nuclear translocation and whether N associates with particular nucleolar components are unknown. In the present study, we show by confocal microscopy that the PRRSV N protein colocalizes with the small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA)-associated protein fibrillarin. Direct and specific interaction of N with fibrillarin was demonstrated in vivo by the mammalian two-hybrid assay in cells cotransfected with the N and fibrillarin genes and in vitro by the glutathione S-transferase pull-down assay using the expressed fibrillarin protein. Using a series of deletion mutants, the interactive domain of N with fibrillarin was mapped to a region of amino acids 30 to 37. For fibrillarin, the first 80 amino acids, which contain the glycine-arginine-rich region (the GAR domain), was determined to be the domain interactive with N. The N protein was able to bind to the full-length genomic RNA of PRRSV, and the RNA binding domain was identified as the region overlapping with the nuclear localization signal situated at positions 41 to 47. These results suggest that the N protein nuclear transport may be controlled by the binding of RNA to N. The PRRSV N protein was also able to bind to both 28S and 18S ribosomal RNAs. The protein-protein interaction between N and fibrillarin was RNA dependent but independent of N protein phosphorylation. Taken together, our studies demonstrate a specific interaction of the PRRSV nucleocapsid protein with the host cell protein fibrillarin in the nucleolus, and they imply a potential linkage of viral strategies for the modulation of host cell functions, possibly through rRNA precursor processing and ribosome biogenesis.","Yoo, Dongwan; Wootton, Sarah K; Li, Gang; Song, Cheng; Rowland, Raymond R",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14581554/,33

While most people have a mild course of the disease, a significant minority of patients will develop some degree of respiratory insufficiency requiring hospitalization. In case of failure of conventional oxygen therapy, the method of choice in patients with respiratory insufficiency is ventilation with high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC). In order to reduce the dispersion of infectious aerosol during HFNC treatment, nasal cannula is often covered with a surgical mask in many hospitals. According to recent observations, the application of a surgical mask in these patients could also have a positive effect on oxygenation parameters without clinically relevant side effects. In the present set of case reports, we demonstrate this effective, simple and affordable way how to improve oxygenation in patients with COVID-19 and hypoxemic respiratory failure treated with HFNC.","Smaha, Juraj; Kužma, Martin; Brázdilová, Kristína; Jackuliak, Peter; Payer, Juraj",Vnitrni lekarstvi,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34074102/,33

In a country of relatively high TB and low HIV burden, we retrospectively studied 107 patients (69.2% male; mean age (SD): 45 (17) years) who received empirical anti-TB treatment for intrapulmonary opacities or pleural effusions suspected of active TB in our hospitals between 1998 and 2002. The diagnosis of definite or probable 'smear-negative' pulmonary TB was made based on treatment outcome at two months with rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide and ethambutol (or streptomycin). At this end-point, 81 patients (84.4%) had both clinical and radiological improvement (definite cases), 12 (12.5%) had clinical improvement alone and 3 (3.1%) had radiological improvement alone (probable cases). Confirmation of acid-fast bacilli was subsequently obtained in 12 patients (all definite cases) from culture of initial pulmonary specimens. Eleven patients (10.5%) were diagnosed as 'non-TB' based on absence of both clinical and radiological improvement or discovery of another cause for the pulmonary condition at or before this two-month study end-point. In the 'non-TB' group, 2 had carcinoma, 2 had HIV-related pulmonary diseases, 1 had bronchiectasis, while in 6 causes were indeterminate. Six (6.3%) and 3 (27.3%) patients reported adverse effects from anti-TB drugs from the 'TB' and 'non-TB' groups respectively.

We report our experience of COVID-19 with stroke at a single center over a period of eight months spanning 1 March to 31 October 2020. METHODS We recruited all patients admitted to Internal Medicine with an acute stroke, who also tested positive for COVID-19 on RTPCR. We included all stroke cases in our analysis for prediction of in-hospital mortality, and separately analyzed arterial infarcts for vascular territory of ischemic strokes. RESULTS There were 62 stroke cases among 3923 COVID-19 admissions (incidence 1.6%). Data was available for 58 patients {mean age 52.6 years; age range 17-91; F/M=20/38; 24% (14/58) aged ≤40; 51% (30/58) hypertensive; 36% (21/58) diabetic; 41% (24/58) with O2 saturation <95% at admission; 32/58 (55.17 %) in-hospital mortality}. Among 58 strokes, there were 44 arterial infarcts, seven bleeds, three arterial infarcts with associated cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, two combined infarct and bleed, and two of indeterminate type. Among the total 49 infarcts, Carotid territory was the commonest affected (36/49; 73.5%), followed by vertebrobasilar (7/49; 14.3%) and both (6/49; 12.2%). Concordant arterial block was seen in 61% (19 of 31 infarcts with angiography done). 'Early stroke' (within 48 hours of respiratory symptoms) was seen in 82.7% (48/58) patients. Patients with poor saturation at admission were older (58 vs 49 years) and had more comorbidities and higher mortality (79% vs 38%). Mortality was similar in young strokes and older patients, although the latter required more intense respiratory support. Logistic regression analysis showed that low Glasgow coma score (GCS) and requirement for increasing intensity of respiratory support predicted in-hospital mortality. CONCLUSIONS We had a 1.6% incidence of COVID-19 related stroke of which the majority were carotid territory infarcts. In-hospital mortality was 55.17%, predicted by low GCS at admission.","Sundar, Uma; Karnik, Niteen D; Mukhopadhyay, Amita; Darole, Pramod; Kolte, Shaonak; Bansal, Ashank; Gokhale, Yojana A; Asole, Dnaneshwar; Joshi, Anagha; Pednekar, Sangeeta; Chavan, Swati; Trivedi, Trupti; Padwal, Namita; Kalekar, Lalana; Londhe, Charulata",The Journal of the Association of Physicians of India,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34472782/,33

The fluffed PP fibres were used to make a polypropylene mask and to edge standard surgical and N-95 respirators to prevent leakage. A PP napkin was created by melting and blowing PP. The PP edging seal dramatically reduced bacterial leakage of standard masks and was more effective than adhesive paper tape edging in reducing respiratory resistance. Bacterial or viral filtration efficiency was almost 100% for the PP mask and the PP napkin. The specially designed PP mask with a synthetic adhesive at the edge of the mask may be more effective than the standard surgical mask and the N-95 respirator.

More recently SG was proposed as an stand alone procedure in the treatment of morbidly obese patients. The aim of this study is to analyze perioperative outcome of morbid obese patients after SG. METHODS 301 patients, 201 women and 100 men, undergoing SG were retrospectively analyzed. SG was performed by 17 surgeons all member of the Club Coelio. The mean BMI was 44.7kg/m2 (27.4-70.3 kg/m2). 34 patients (11.3%) of our series had SG as revisional surgery. These revisional procedures consisted of 32 conversions from gastric banding, 1 conversion from vertical gastroplasty (VBG) and 1 from transoral endoscopic gastroplasty. Among the 32 patients that had revisional SG after a gastric banding, 13 bands were removed at least 3 months before the revisional SG and 19 bands were removed during the SG procedure. Endpoints were perioperative morbidity and mortality and potential risk factors for complications, mainly per or postoperative bleeding or leakage. RESULTS Overall mortality was 0% and morbidity was 10.3%. Perioperative bleeding occurred in 10 patients (3.3%), leakage in 12 patients (4%) patients and stenosis in 3 patients (1%). The risk of leakage was significantly higher after revisional bariatric surgery and in case of gastric perforation during surgery (p = 0.0001). Previous gastric banding is also associated with a higher risk of postoperative bleeding (p = 0.0006). CONCLUSIONS SG can be safely performed but patients and surgeons must be aware of a higher risk of postoperative complications when SG is proposed as a revisional surgery.","Germanova, D; Loi, P; van Vyve, E; Johanet, H; Landenne, J; Closset, J",Acta chirurgica Belgica,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24224433/,33

The Workforce of Direct Patient Care Genetic Counselors in Wisconsin.,2020-09-01,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is a newly emergent virus responsible for a worldwide epidemic in 2003. The coronavirus spike proteins belong to class I fusion proteins, and are characterized by the existence of two heptad repeat (HR) regions, HR1 and HR2. The HR1 region in coronaviruses is predicted to be considerably longer than that in other type I virus fusion proteins. Therefore the exact binding sequence to HR2 from the HR1 is not clear. In this study, we defined the region of HR1 that binds to HR2 by a series of biochemical and biophysical measures. Subsequently the defined HR1 (902-952) and HR2 (1145-1184) chains, which are different from previously defined binding regions, were linked together by a flexible linker to form a single-chain construct, 2-Helix. This protein was expressed in Escherichia coli and forms a typical six-helix coiled coil bundle. Highly conserved HR regions between mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and SARS-CoV spike proteins suggest a similar three-dimensional structure for the two fusion cores. Here, we constructed a homology model for SARS coronavirus fusion core based on our biochemical analysis and determined the MHV fusion core structure. We also propose an important target site for fusion inhibitor design and several strategies, which have been successfully used in fusion inhibitor design for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), for the treatment of SARS infection.","Xu, Yanhui; Zhu, Jieqing; Liu, Yiwei; Lou, Zhiyong; Yuan, Fang; Liu, Yueyong; Cole, David K; Ni, Ling; Su, Nan; Qin, Lan; Li, Xu; Bai, Zhihong; Bell, John I; Pang, Hai; Tien, Po; Gao, George F; Rao, Zihe",Biochemistry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15518555/,33

Hemorrhage occurred more often in those who took mifepristone and misoprostol (51.44%) than in those who took mifepristone alone (22.41%). Conclusions Significant morbidity and mortality have occurred following the use of mifepristone as an abortifacient. A pre-abortion ultrasound should be required to rule out ectopic pregnancy and confirm gestational age. The FDA AER system is inadequate and significantly underestimates the adverse events from mifepristone. A mandatory registry of ongoing pregnancies is essential considering the number of ongoing pregnancies especially considering the known teratogenicity of misoprostol. The decision to prevent the FDA from enforcing REMS during the COVID-19 pandemic needs to be reversed and REMS must be strengthened.","Aultman, Kathi; Cirucci, Christina A; Harrison, Donna J; Beran, Benjamin D; Lockwood, Michael D; Seiler, Sigmund",Issues in law & medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33939340/,33
192946,A historical overview of Balkan Endemic Nephropathy (BEN) in relation to published hypotheses.,2014,"In the past 30 years, great strides have been made in immunizing infants and children routinely in developing countries under the Expanded Programme on Immunization. Despite this, the introduction of Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccines has progressed rather slowly compared to previously-introduced vaccines for infant immunizations. This slower uptake has been attributed partly to the need for data on the burden of invasive Hib disease. To understand this need, conceptual underpinnings and prerequisites were explored for Hib disease-burden studies. Methodological approaches were also reviewed for conducting Hib disease-burden studies that may be considered in developing countries. Potential studies span a range of designs that provide varying levels of clinical, laboratory and epidemiologic evidence of the burden of invasive Hib disease. Carefully-conducted studies can lay the foundation for complementary studies of long-term disability due to invasive Hib disease, national economic analysis, and field evaluations of vaccine. Studies done in collaboration with national agencies and clinical investigators will maximize study value and provide critical data for national decision-makers who make choices regarding the introduction of Hib vaccines.","Kilgore, Paul E; Nyambat, Batmunkh","Journal of health, population, and nutrition",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15609777/,33
193322,Treatment Planning for Image-Guided Neuro-Vascular Interventions Using Patient-Specific 3D Printed Phantoms.,2015,"UNLABELLED To protect occupants from infectious diseases or possible chemical/biological agents released by a terrorist in an enclosed space, such as an airliner cabin, it is critical to identify gaseous contaminant source locations and strengths. This paper identified the source locations and strengths by solving inverse contaminant transport with the quasi-reversibility (QR) and pseudo-reversibility (PR) methods. The QR method replaces the second-order diffusion term in the contaminant transport equation with a fourth-order stabilization term. By using the airflow pattern calculated by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and the time when the peak contaminant concentration was measured by a sensor in downstream, the QR method solves the backward probability density function (PDF) of contaminant source location. The PR method reverses the airflow calculated by CFD and solves the PDF in the same manner as the QR method. The position with the highest PDF is the location of the contaminant source. The source strength can be further determined by scaling the nominal contaminant concentration computed by CFD with the concentration measured by the sensor. By using a two-dimensional and a three-dimensional aircraft cabin as examples of enclosed spaces, the two methods can identify contaminant source locations and strengths in the cabins if the sensors are placed in the downstream location of the sources. The QR method performed slightly better than the PR method but with a longer computing time. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS The paper presents a method that can be used to find a gaseous contaminant source location and determine its strength in enclosed spaces with the data of contaminant concentration measured by one sensor. The method can be a very useful tool to find where, what, and how the contamination has happened. The method is also useful for optimally placing sensors in enclosed spaces. The results can be applied to develop appropriate measures to protect occupants in enclosed environments from infectious diseases or chemical/biological warfare agents released by a terrorist.","Zhang, T; Chen, Q",Indoor air,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18045268/,33

193693,ISSUE HIGHLIGHTS.,2020-11-01,"OBJECTIVES To investigate the enteropathogens in children with diarrhea attending Salmaniya Medical Complex, Bahrain. METHODS Fecal samples from 805 children up to 15 years were examined for parasites, ova and cysts by direct wet preparation, formol-ether concentration and modified Ziehl-Neelsen stain, during the period November 1998 through to June 2000. Samples were cultured for Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter and Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli. Antibiotic sensitivity tests were performed on the relevant clinical isolates by agar disk diffusion method. All stools from children below 3 years of age (653 samples) were processed for adenovirus and rotavirus using a commercially available latex agglutination test (Diarlex). In addition, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was performed on 200 randomly selected samples using oligonucleotide primers for Rotavirus A, B and C. RESULTS Four subjects were found positive for parasites. Eighty-three (10.3%) samples were found positive for Salmonella (46 isolates), Shigella (26 isolates), Campylobacter jejuni (7 isolates), and Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (4 isolates). Rotavirus was found in 91 (13.9%) samples and 4 samples (0.6%) were found positive for adenovirus. Out of 200 samples examined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, 73 (36.5%) were positive for group A rotavirus. CONCLUSIONS Rotavirus type A appeared to be the most common single agent in our pediatric population, followed by the classical bacterial pathogens. Adenovirus and parasites appeared to play a very minor role in diarrhea. Thus, we suggest the introduction of rotavirus diagnostic tests in microbiological examination of diarrheic stools of children below 3 years of age.","Ismaeel, Abdulrahman Y; Jamsheer, Afaf E; Yousif, Ahmed Q; Al-Otaibi, Mohammad A; Botta, Giuseppe A",Saudi medical journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12370713/,33
194942,WHO issues global alert after grim report on HIV/AIDS.,2003,"We have previously demonstrated antibody-dependent enhancement of feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) infection of macrophages using both virus-specific antisera and monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to the spike (S) protein of FIPV. To increase our understanding of this phenomenon, six representative MAbs from a previously documented group of 12 enhancing MAbs were used to identify epitopes that mediate antibody-dependent enhancement of FIPV infectivity. Analysis of the results of kinetics-based competitive ELISA (K-cELISA) among these six enhancing MAbs grouped the epitopes into two clusters. Because transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and FIPV are so closely related antigenically, we also conducted K-cELISA experiments between the FIPV MAbs and TGEV S protein-specific MAbs for which the epitopes had previously been mapped to specific sites on the TGEV S protein. Results of these assays indicated that the two FIPV epitope clusters are homologues of the previously defined TGEV S protein sites A and E/F. In addition, two TGEV S protein-specific MAbs also induced antibody-dependent enhancement of FIPV infection of macrophages. This functional cross-reactivity provides further support for the close antigenic relationship between FIPV and TGEV. Our results provide a preliminary localization of several enhancing epitopes within the amino acid sequence of the FIPV S protein.","Olsen, C W; Corapi, W V; Jacobson, R H; Simkins, R A; Saif, L J; Scott, F W",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7682252/,33
196106,Be prepared.,2005,"Aminopeptidase N (APN), a 150-kDa metalloprotease also called CD13, serves as a receptor for serologically related coronaviruses of humans (human coronavirus 229E [HCoV-229E]), pigs, and cats. These virus-receptor interactions can be highly species specific; for example, the human coronavirus can use human APN (hAPN) but not porcine APN (pAPN) as its cellular receptor, and porcine coronaviruses can use pAPN but not hAPN. Substitution of pAPN amino acids 283 to 290 into hAPN for the corresponding amino acids 288 to 295 introduced an N-glycosylation sequon at amino acids 291 to 293 that blocked HCoV-229E receptor activity of hAPN. Substitution of two amino acids that inserted an N-glycosylation site at amino acid 291 also resulted in a mutant hAPN that lacked receptor activity because it failed to bind HCoV-229E. Single amino acid revertants that removed this sequon at amino acids 291 to 293 but had one or five pAPN amino acid substitution(s) in this region all regained HCoV-229E binding and receptor activities. To determine if other N-linked glycosylation differences between hAPN, feline APN (fAPN), and pAPN account for receptor specificity of pig and cat coronaviruses, a mutant hAPN protein that, like fAPN and pAPN, lacked a glycosylation sequon at 818 to 820 was studied. This sequon is within the region that determines receptor activity for porcine and feline coronaviruses. Mutant hAPN lacking the sequon at amino acids 818 to 820 maintained HCoV-229E receptor activity but did not gain receptor activity for porcine or feline coronaviruses. Thus, certain differences in glycosylation between coronavirus receptors from different species are critical determinants in the species specificity of infection.","Wentworth, D E; Holmes, K V",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11559807/,33
196855,The year of the patient.,1992,"Two antigenically related porcine coronaviruses, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) which infects primarily the intestinal tract and causes severe diarrhea, and porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) which infects the respiratory tract and causes subclinical or mild respiratory infections, presented a unique opportunity to study the interrelationship of gut-(GALT) and bronchus-associated lymphoid tissues (BALT) and their contribution to protective immunity against TGEV infection. Pigs were inoculated oral-nasally with TGEV or with PRCV at eleven days of age and challenged 24 days later with TGEV. All pigs initially given TGEV developed diarrhea and were completely protected against disease upon challenge. In contrast, pigs given PRCV had no clinical disease and shed virus in nasal secretions only; after challenge, 5 of 12 pigs developed diarrhea. Virus-specific IgG and IgA Ab-secreting cells (ASC) were enumerated by ELISPOT in the mesenteric and bronchial lymph nodes, spleens, and gut lamina propria at challenge and various post challenge days. Before challenge, in pigs exposed to TGEV, IgA-ASC in the duodenum and jejunum constituted the major ASC response. Conversely, PRCV-exposed pigs had mainly IgG-ASC in bronchial lymph nodes, with low ASC responses in the gut. After challenge, numbers of IgG-ASC increased rapidly in the gut lamina propria and mesenteric lymph nodes of only PRCV-primed pigs. Our results suggest that virus-specific IgG-ASC precursors derived in BALT of PRCV-primed pigs may migrate to the gut in response to TGEV challenge and contribute to the partial protection observed. The presence of IgA-ASC in the gut lamina propria of TGEV-primed pigs at the time of challenge correlated with complete protection against TGEV challenge. Thus a dichotomy exists in the BALT and GALT ASC responses; immunization via BALT induced a systemic type of response (IgG-ASC) and provided imperfect protection against an enteric pathogen, whereas immunization via GALT induced IgA-ASC and provided complete protection.","VanCott, J L; Brim, T A; Lunney, J K; Saif, L J",Journal of immunology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8144965/,33
197001,"Making Compassionate Use More Useful: Using real-world data, real-world evidence and digital twins to supplement or supplant randomized controlled trials.",2021,"OBJECTIVES To describe the effect of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on the initiation of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in patients with out-of-hospital cardiopulmonary arrest. To compare the cardiopulmonary arrest caseload during the pandemic to the caseloads in other periods. MATERIAL AND METHODS Observational, prospective study based on the registry of out-of-hospital cardiopulmonary arrest emergencies the SUMMA112 ambulance service responded to between March 1 and April 30, 2020, in the Spanish autonomous community of Madrid. The registry is a Utstein-style database. The period of March-April 2019 was the control period for direct comparison with the 2020 study period and with the January-February periods of 2019 and 2020. RESULTS The responders undertook advanced CPR in 146 of the 313 cardiopulmonary arrest cases registered during March-April, 2020. Of the 87 patients with COVID-19-positive tests, 33 reached the hospital alive. Advanced CPR was not applied in 167 cases; the most frequent reason was prolonged circulatory collapse. Most cases (92.7%) occurred in the home. The emergency dispatchers received more calls in March and April of 2020, but they sent out a similar number of ambulances. CONCLUSION Mortality was higher in cases of cardiopulmonary arrest during the COVID-19 pandemic. The percentage of cases with no application of advanced CPR rose; the main reason was the amount of time between collapse and first response. Even though the number of emergency calls increased significantly, the SUMMA112 service did not dispatch more ambulances.","Navalpotro-Pascual, José María; Fernández Pérez, Cristina; Peinado Vallejo, Francisco Alfonso; Carrillo Moya, Alfredo; Muñecas Cuesta, Yago; Muñoz Isabel, Belén; González León, Manuel José; Les González, Juan Ignacio",Emergencias : revista de la Sociedad Espanola de Medicina de Emergencias,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33750050/,33

Partial sequences spanning the amino terminus region of S1 from amino acid residues 48 to 219, based on the Beaudette strain, were used for analysis. Phylogenetic clustering and high-sequence identity values were used to identify isolates that appeared to be derived from live IBV vaccines used in the two countries. Novel variant strains, unrelated by S1 sequencing and restriction fragment length polymorphism analyses to reference and vaccine strains, were also identified. Based on S1 sequence identity to available vaccines, the potential to use vaccination to control IBV infections was evaluated. Vaccination with commercial live strains Massachusetts (Mass), Arkansas (Ark) or DE/072/92, generally produced immunity against vaccine-related field isolates displaying high S1 sequence similarities (> or = 90%) to the respective vaccine strains. Immunization with a bivalent vaccine containing the Mass and Ark strains provided good cross-protection, averaging 81% against challenge with five variant isolates from the US having amino acid identity values ranging from 62 to 69% to Mass and from 68 to 83% to Ark, respectively. In contrast, the H120 vaccine strain induced low levels of protection, ranging from 25 to 58% against variant field isolates from Israel with amino acid identity values from 65 to 67%.","Gelb, J; Weisman, Y; Ladman, B S; Meir, R",Avian pathology : journal of the W.V.P.A,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16191702/,33
197867,An intense influenza pandemic--possible subtype of H5N1: its implications for Jamaica.,2010,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW Transplant patients are uniquely predisposed to emerging infections for a number of reasons. Two outbreaks, West Nile virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome, have recently provided important lessons on how transplant patients are affected, and how transplant programmes must adapt and evolve in the face of emerging infections. An update of emerging infections in transplant patients, using West Nile virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome as specific examples, is summarized here. RECENT FINDINGS Exogenous immunosuppression, specific allograft factors, and extensive contact with the healthcare system all predispose transplant patients to emerging infections. Transplant patients may acquire West Nile virus through blood transfusion, donor transmission, or community exposure. Seroprevalence data in transplant populations suggest the risk of severe neurological disease is several fold higher in transplant recipients who acquire West Nile virus compared with immunocompetent individuals. Prevention strategies are critical in this population. These include nucleic acid testing of blood products and potentially also screening organ donors in a similar manner. During the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, transplant patients with severe and rapidly progressive disease were reported. Higher viral burdens appeared to be present in transplant patients and may have implications for the increased infectivity of these patients. Transplant programmes in severe acute respiratory syndrome areas were also adversely affected because of donor concerns, recipient issues and resource problems. SUMMARY Transplant patients are uniquely predisposed to emerging infections. Lessons learned from West Nile virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome in transplantation should be applicable to future outbreaks of other emerging infectious diseases.","Kumar, Deepali; Humar, Atul",Current opinion in infectious diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15985831/,33

Increased hemagglutination-inhibition antibody titers to a parvovirus (PV) antigenically related to feline panleukopenia virus were found in convalescent serum specimens of 78% (20/26) of the affected dogs and in 83% (5/6) of apparently healthy dogs. With one exception, all dogs tested had significant levels of hemagglutination-inhibition antibody to this PV. Similar increased antibody titers were found to feline panleukopenia virus. Also, neutralizing antibody responses were detected to the canine coronavirus in 24% (6/25) and canine herpesvirus in 45% (10/22) of the affected dogs. However, antibody titers did not increase to canine distemper virus, infectious canine hepatitis virus, canine parainfluenza virus, or minute virus of canines. Subsequent serotesting of the colony provided evidence that additional PV infections occurred in pups from each of 8 litters born 3 to 8 months after the epizootic.

198733,Digital pathology as a solution for working from home.,2021-08-01,"INTRODUCTION Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) remains the primary mechanism of resuscitation for cardiac arrest victims. However, the quality of delivery of CPR varies widely in different settings, possibly affecting patient outcomes. This study is aimed to determine the efficacy of an audio-visual (AV) CPR feedback device in improving the quality of CPR delivered by healthcare providers. METHODS This pre-post, single-arm, quasi-experimental study randomly sampled 140 healthcare providers working in the Emergency Department of Hospital Ampang, Malaysia. Parameters of CPR quality, namely chest compression rate and depth were compared among participants when they performed CPR with and without an AV CPR feedback device. The efficacy of the AV CPR feedback device was assessed using the Chi-square test and Generalised Estimating Equations (GEE) models. RESULTS The use of an AV CPR feedback device increased the proportion of healthcare providers achieving recommended depth of chest compressions from 38.6% (95% Confidence Interval, 95%CI: 30.5, 47.2) to 85.0% (95%CI: 78.0, 90.5). A similar significant improvement from 39.3% (95%CI: 31.1, 47.9) to 86.4% (95%CI: 79.6, 91.6) in the recommended rate of chest compressions was also observed. Use of the AV CPR device significantly increased the likelihood of a CPR provider achieving recommended depth of chest compressions (Odds Ratio, OR=13.01; 95%CI: 7.12, 24.01) and rate of chest compressions (OR=13.00; 95%CI: 7.21, 23.44). CONCLUSION The use of an AV CPR feedback device significantly improved the delivered rate and depth of chest compressions closer to American Heart Association (AHA) recommendations. Usage of such devices within real-life settings may help in improving the quality of CPR for patients receiving CPR.","Chelladurai, G; Noor Azhar, A M; Mohd Isa, R; Bustam, A; Ahmad, R; Munisamy, M",The Medical journal of Malaysia,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32918419/,33

A cross-sectional, comparative study was conducted among 61 patients receiving care in an urban clinic (31 with and 30 without a venous ulcer, mean age 54 years [range 40 to 65 years], 93% African American) to examine pain and its relation to activity and walking in persons with injectionrelated venous ulcers. The questionnaire included items about pain and its treatment, as well as activity and walking (ie, Brief Pain Inventory [BPI] Short Form, Self-Treatment of Pain, Pain and Narcotic Use, Difficulty with Activities, and Walking Scale questionnaires). Among those with a venous ulcer (VU+), worst pain significantly related to total interference (r = 0.65, P <0.0001) and total difficulty (r = 0.42, P = 0.02) BPI scores. The common pain sites for those VU+ involved the legs (24, 36.4%), wound sites (13, 19.7%), back (eight, 12.1%), general body (five, 7.6%), shoulder and knee (four, 6.1% each), and other (eight, 12.1%). Persons VU+ were more likely than those without a venous ulcer (VU-) to have received a prescription for narcotics in the past year (96% versus 41%, X(2) = 21.3, P <0.0001). Persons VU+ versus VU- were significantly (X(2) = 8.89, P = 0.003) more likely to resort to street drug use and relapse to addiction if pain was not adequately treated. They were also twice as likely to have decreased walking over the past 5 years (67% versus 33%, X(2) = 5.93, P <0.02). Among those VU+, venous ulcers added to chronic pain and decreased walking. These findings highlight the negative effects of injection-related venous ulcers on pain, activity, and walking, as well as the propensity of this groupto resort to illicit drug use for pain control. Persons VU+ should have pain assessed and treated.","Pieper, Barbara; DiNardo, Ellen; Nordstrom, Cheryl K",Ostomy/wound management,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23669257/,33
199829,Top-down control of saccades requires inhibition of suddenly appearing stimuli,2020,"Coronaviruses encode the largest replicase polyprotein of any known positive-strand RNA virus. Replicase protein precursors and mature products are thought to mediate the formation and function of viral replication complexes on the surfaces of intracellular double-membrane vesicles. However, the functions of only a few of these proteins are known. For the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), the first proteolytic processing event of the replicase polyprotein liberates an amino-terminal 28-kDa product (p28). While previous biochemical studies have suggested that p28 is associated with viral replication complexes, the intracellular localization and interactions of p28 with other proteins during the course of MHV replication have not been defined. We used immunofluorescence confocal microscopy to show that p28 localizes to viral replication complexes in the cytoplasm during early times postinfection. However, at late times postinfection, p28 localizes to sites of M accumulation distinct from the replication complex. Furthermore, by yeast two-hybrid and coimmunoprecipitation analyses, we demonstrate that p28 specifically binds to p10 and p15, two coronavirus replicase proteins of unknown function. Deletion mutagenesis experiments determined that the carboxy terminus of p28 is not required for its interactions with p10 and p15. These results suggest that p28 may play a part at the replication complex by interacting with p10 and p15. Moreover, our findings highlight a potential role for p28 at virion assembly sites.","Brockway, Sarah M; Lu, Xiao Tao; Peters, Timothy R; Dermody, Terence S; Denison, Mark R",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15479796/,33

The objective of this document was to update, according to the available evidence, the management of some basic elements in the Infection Control Programs (PCI) and the daily care of patients. As a result: 1. The routine use of the N95 masks is not recommended for the care of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients. Available data indicates that SARS-CoV-2 has spread primarily like most other common respiratory viruses, through droplet and contact transmission. In certain situations, personto-person transmission is described through the airway, observed in poorly ventilated environments, and while the individual carried out actions of greater potential transmission 2. The limited reuse and decontamination methods of N95 masks are accepted under safe and effective prot ocols in the context of limited resources. 3.

Extreme production of many kinds of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines occur in severe COVID-19 that called cytokine storm. Signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT-3) present in the cytoplasm in an inactive form and can be stimulated by a vast range of cytokines, chemokines and growth factors. Thus, STAT-3 can participate in the induction of inflammatory responses during coronavirus infections. STAT-3 can also suppress anti-virus interferon response and induce unbalanced anti-virus adaptive immune response, through influencing Th17-, Th1-, Treg-, and B cell-mediated functions. Furthermore, STAT-3 can contribute to the M2 macrophage polarization, lung fibrosis and thrombosis. Moreover, STAT-3 may be directly targeted by some virus-derived protein and operate as a pro-viral or anti-viral element in a virus-specific process. Here, the possible contribution of STAT-3 to the pathogenesis of COVID-19 was explained, while providing potential approaches to target this transcription factor in an attempt for COVID-19 treatment.","Jafarzadeh, Abdollah; Nemati, Maryam; Jafarzadeh, Sara",Microb Pathog,,33

Objective: To assess the prevalence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection across Virginia and the risk factors associated with infection after the first wave of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infections in the US. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this statewide cross-sectional surveillance study, 4675 adult outpatients presenting for health care not associated with COVID-19 in Virginia between June 1 and August 14, 2020, were recruited to participate in a questionnaire and receive venipuncture to assess SARS-CoV-2 serology. Eligibility was stratified to meet age, race, and ethnicity quotas that matched regional demographic profiles. Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcome was SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity, as measured by the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G assay. Results: Among 4675 adult outpatients (mean [SD] age, 48.8 [16.9] years; 3119 women [66.7%]; 3098 White [66.3%] and 4279 non-Hispanic [91.5%] individuals) presenting for non-COVID-19-associated health care across Virginia, the weighted seroprevalence was 2.4% (95% CI, 1.8%-3.1%) and ranged from 0% to 20% by zip code. Seroprevalence was notably higher among participants who were Hispanic (10.2%; 95% CI, 6.1%-14.3%), residing in the northern region (4.4%; 95% CI, 2.8%-6.1%), aged 40 to 49 years (4.4%; 95% CI, 1.8%-7.1%), and uninsured (5.9%; 95% CI, 1.5%-10.3%). Higher seroprevalence was associated with Hispanic ethnicity (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 3.56; 95% CI, 1.76-7.21), residence in a multifamily unit (aOR, 2.55; 95% CI, 1.25-5.22), and contact with an individual with confirmed COVID-19 infection (aOR, 4.33; 95% CI, 1.77-10.58). The sensitivity of serology results was 94% (95% CI, 70%-100%) among those who reported receiving a previous polymerase chain reaction test for COVID-19 infection. Among 101 participants with seropositive results, 67 individuals (66.3%) were estimated to have asymptomatic infection. These data suggested a total estimated COVID-19 burden that was 2.8-fold higher than that ascertained by PCR-positive case counts. Conclusions and Relevance: This large statewide serologic study estimated that 2.4% of adults in Virginia had exposure to SARS-CoV-2, which was 2.8-fold higher than confirmed case counts. Hispanic ethnicity, residence in a multifamily unit, and contact with an individual with confirmed COVID-19 infection were significant risk factors associated with exposure. Most infections were asymptomatic. As of August 2020, the population in Virginia remained largely immunologically naive to the virus.","Rogawski McQuade, Elizabeth T; Guertin, Kristin A; Becker, Lea; Operario, Darwin; Gratz, Jean; Guan, Dave; Khan, Fauzia; White, Jennifer; McMurry, Timothy L; Shah, Bhruga; Garofalo, Stephanie; Southerland, Matt; Bear, Kelly; Brush, John; Allen, Cynthia; Frayser, Amy; Vokes, Rebecca; Pershad, Rashmi; Peake, Lilian; deFilippi, Christopher; Barackman, Kathleen; Bearman, Gonzalo; Bidanset, Andrea; Farrell, Francis; Trump, David; Houpt, Eric R",JAMA Netw Open,,33

The combination of these two points led WHO to forecast a high expected mortality rate of approximately 2% of the population. The phenomenon of Simpson's paradox teaches us that we should be careful when we combine two variables together. Indeed, despite the high mortality rate in several places, this forecast seems to have collapsed. We believe one of the reasons for the erroneous forecasts is that combining the above points ignored a confounding variable - many of the virus carriers are asymptomatic and therefore not diagnosed.","Shaki, Yair Y",Sci Prog,,33

208679,New insights into the neurological effects of COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: Spain has been one of the countries most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Since the first confirmed case was reported on January 31, 2020, there have been over 405,000 cases and 28,000 deaths in Spain. The economic and social impact is without precedent. Thus, it is important to quickly assess the situation and perception of the population. Large-scale online surveys have been shown to be an effective tool for this purpose. OBJECTIVE: We aim to assess the situation and perception of the Spanish population in four key areas related to the COVID-19 pandemic: social contact behavior during confinement, personal economic impact, labor situation, and health status. METHODS: We obtained a large sample using an online survey with 24 questions related to COVID-19 in the week of March 28-April 2, 2020, during the peak of the first wave of COVID-19 in Spain. The self-selection online survey method of nonprobability sampling was used to recruit 156,614 participants via social media posts that targeted the general adult population (age >18 years). Given such a large sample, the 95% CI was ±0.843 for all reported proportions. RESULTS: Regarding social behavior during confinement, participants mainly left their homes to satisfy basic needs. We found several statistically significant differences in social behavior across genders and age groups. The population's willingness to comply with the confinement measures is evident. From the survey answers, we identified a significant adverse economic impact of the pandemic on those working in small businesses and a negative correlation between economic damage and willingness to stay in confinement. The survey revealed that close contacts play an important role in the transmission of the disease, and 28% of the participants lacked the necessary resources to properly isolate themselves. We also identified a significant lack of testing, with only 1% of the population tested and 6% of respondents unable to be tested despite their doctor's recommendation. We developed a generalized linear model to identify the variables that were correlated with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result. Using this model, we estimated an average of 5% for SARS-CoV-2 prevalence in the Spanish population during the time of the study. A seroprevalence study carried out later by the Spanish Ministry of Health reported a similar level of disease prevalence (5%). CONCLUSIONS: Large-scale online population surveys, distributed via social media and online messaging platforms, can be an effective, cheap, and fast tool to assess the impact and prevalence of an infectious disease in the context of a pandemic, particularly when there is a scarcity of official data and limited testing capacity.","Oliver, Nuria; Barber, Xavier; Roomp, Kirsten; Roomp, Kristof",J Med Internet Res,,33

Patients presenting a preexisting chronic condition, as Type 1 Diabetes (T1D), are the ones suffering the most from this situation. Moreover, people affected by diabetes are the ones with the worst prognosis, if infected by SARS-CoV-2. We analyzed why patients with T1D were poorly represented between the subjects hospitalized for COVID-19 and why the cases of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) were fewer and more severe compared with the past years. Furthermore, literature has showed how patients of all ages with T1D did not experience a deterioration in their glucose control throughout the lockdown. Among other causes, this is also due to the surging use of telemedicine. Finally, we tried to understand how the coronavirus tropism for endocrine tissues could influence the future epidemiology of T1D, focusing on the effects they have on pancreatic ß-cells.","Iughetti, Lorenzo; Trevisani, Viola; Cattini, Umberto; Bruzzi, Patrizia; Lucaccioni, Laura; Madeo, Simona; Predieri, Barbara",Acta Biomed,,33

Raised sNfL levels have been reported in adults infected with pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Levels in children infected with COVID-19 have not as yet been reported. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether sNfL is elevated in children contracting COVID-19. METHODS: Between May 22 and July 22, 2020, a network of outpatient pediatricians in Bavaria, Germany, the Coronavirus antibody screening in children from Bavaria study network (CoKiBa), recruited healthy children into a cross-sectional study from two sources: an ongoing prevention program for 1-14 years, and referrals of 1-17 years consulting a pediatrician for possible infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We determined sNfL levels by single molecule array immunoassay and SARS-CoV-2 antibody status by two independent quantitative methods. RESULTS: Of the 2652 included children, 148 (5.6%) were SARS-CoV-2 antibody positive with asymptomatic to moderate COVID-19 infection. Neurological symptoms-headache, dizziness, muscle aches, or loss of smell and taste-were present in 47/148 cases (31.8%). Mean sNfL levels were 5.5 pg/ml (SD 2.9) in the total cohort, 5.1 (SD 2.1) pg/ml in the children with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, and 5.5 (SD 3.0) pg/ml in those without. Multivariate regression analysis revealed age-but neither antibody status, antibody levels, nor clinical severity-as an independent predictor of sNfL. Follow-up of children with pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome (n = 14) showed no association with sNfL.

All countries have taken measures to control the spread of the epidemic. Because it is not known when the epidemic will end in several countries, then the prediction of the COVID-19 pandemic is a very important challenge. This study has predicted the temporal evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic in several countries using the logistic growth model. This model has analyzed several countries to describe the epidemic situation of these countries. The time interval of the actual data used as a comparison with the prediction results of this model was starting in the firstly confirmed COVID-19 cases to December 2020. This study examined an approach to the complexity spread of the COVID-19 pandemic using the logistic growth model formed from an ordinary differential equation. This model described the time-dependent population growth rate characterized by the three parameters of the analytical solution. The non-linear least-squares method was used to estimate the three parameters. These parameters described the rate growth constant of infected cases and the total number of confirmed cases in the final phase of the epidemic. This model is applied to the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in several countries. The prediction results show the spread dynamics of COVID-19 infected cases which are characterized by time-dependent dynamics. In this study, the proposed model provides estimates for the model parameters that are good for predicting the COVID-19 pandemic because they correspond to actual data for all analyzed countries. It is based on the coefficient of determination, R2, and the R2 value of more than 95% which is obtained from the non-linear curves for all analyzed countries. It shows that this model has the potential to contribute to better public health policy-making in the prevention of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Kartono, Agus Wahyudi Setyanto Tri Setiawan Ardian Arif Sofian Irmansyah",Infectious Disease Reports,,33

We tested the efficacy of a motivationally informed antidoping intervention for coaches, with their athletes' willingness to dope as the primary outcome. METHODS: We delivered a cluster randomised controlled trial in Australia, the UK and Greece. This study was a parallel group, two-condition, superiority trial. Participants were 130 coaches and 919 athletes. Coaches in the intervention group attended two workshops and received supplementary information to support them in adopting a motivationally supportive communication style when discussing doping-related issues with their athletes. Coaches in the control condition attended a standard antidoping workshop that provided up-to-date information on antidoping issues yet excluded any motivation-related content. Assessments of willingness to dope (primary outcome) and other secondary outcomes were taken at baseline, postintervention (3 months) and at a 2-month follow up. RESULTS: Compared with athletes in the control group, athletes in the intervention group reported greater reductions in willingness to take prohibited substances (effect size g=0.17) and psychological need frustration (g=0.23) at postintervention, and greater increases in antidoping knowledge (g=0.27) at follow-up. Coaches in the intervention group reported at postintervention greater increases in efficacy to create an antidoping culture (g=0.40) and in perceived effectiveness of need supporting behaviours (g=0.45) to deal with doping-related situations. They also reported greater decreases in doping attitudes (g=0.24) and perceived effectiveness of need thwarting behaviours (g=0.35). CONCLUSIONS: Antidoping education programmes should consider incorporating principles of motivation, as these could be beneficial to coaches and their athletes. We offer suggestions to strengthen these programmes, as most of the effects we observed were not sustained at follow-up.

Nonemergency health services, such as cancer screening, have been scaled down or withheld as a result of travel restrictions and resources being redirected to manage the pandemic. The present article discusses the challenges to cancer screening implementation in the pandemic environment, suggesting ways to optimize services for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer screening. METHODS: The manuscript was drafted by a team of public health specialists with expertise in implementation and monitoring of cancer screening. A scoping review of literature revealed the lack of comprehensive guidance on continuation of cancer screening in the midst of waxing and waning of infection. The recommendations in the present article were based on the advisories issued by different health agencies and professional bodies and the authors' understanding of the best practices to maintain quality-assured cancer screening. RESULTS: A well-coordinated approach is required to ensure that essential health services such as cancer management are maintained and elective services are not threatened, especially because of resource constraints. In the context of cancer screening, a few changes in invitation strategies, screening and management protocols and program governance need to be considered to fit into the new normal situation. Restoring public trust in providing efficient and safe services should be one of the key mandates for screening program reorganization. This may be a good opportunity to introduce innovations (eg, telehealth) and consider de-implementing non-evidence-based practices. It is necessary to consider increased spending on primary health care and incorporating screening services in basic health package. CONCLUSION: The article provides guidance on reorganization of screening policies, governance, implementation, and program monitoring.","Basu, Partha; Alhomoud, Samar; Taghavi, Katayoun; Carvalho, Andre L; Lucas, Eric; Baussano, Iacopo",JCO Glob Oncol,,33
218992,In Reply: Precautions for Endoscopic Transnasal Skull Base Surgery During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND: The first months of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Spain resulted in high incidence and mortality A national sero-epidemiological survey suggests higher cumulative incidence of infection in older individuals than in younger individuals However, little is known about the epidemic dynamics in different age groups, including the relative effect of the lockdown measures introduced on March 15, and strengthened on March 30 to April 14, 2020 when only essential workers continued to work METHODS: We used data from the National Epidemiological Surveillance Network (RENAVE in Spanish) on the daily number of reported COVID-19 cases (by date of symptom onset) in eleven 5-year age groups: 15-19y through 65-69y For each age group g, we computed the proportion E(g) of individuals in age group g among all reported cases aged 15-69y during the pre-lockdown period (March 1-10, 2020) and the corresponding proportion L(g) during two lockdown periods (March 25-April 3 and April 8-17, 2020) For each lockdown period, we computed the proportion ratios PR(g)= L(g)/E(g) For each pair of age groups g1,g2, PR(g1)&gt;PR(g2) implies a relative increase in the incidence of detected SARS-CoV-2 infection in the age group g1 compared with g2 for the later vs early period RESULTS: For the first lockdown period, the highest PR values were in age groups 50-54y (PR=1 21;95% CI: 1 12,1 30) and 55-59y (PR=1 19;1 11,1 27) For the second lockdown period, the highest PR values were in age groups 15-19y (PR=1 26;0 95,1 68) and 50-54y (PR=1 20;1 09,1 31) CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that different outbreak control measures led to different changes in the relative incidence by age group During the first lockdown period, when non-essential work was allowed, individuals aged 40-64y, particularly those aged 50-59y presented with higher COVID-19 relative incidence compared to pre-lockdown period, while younger adults/older adolescents (together with persons aged 50-59y) had increased relative incidence during the later, strengthened lockdown The role of different age groups during the epidemic should be considered when implementing future mitigation efforts","Martinez de Salazar, Pablo; Gomez-Barroso, Diana; Pampaka, Despina; Gil, Josep Maria; Penalver, Belen; Fernandez-Escobar, Carlos; Lipsitch, Marc; Larrauri, Amparo; Goldstein, Edward; Hernan, Miguel",,,33

RECENT FINDINGS: The latest research on mental health needs in low-resource settings has identified a high need for mental health services for difficult-to-reach and underserved populations. Research on tele-consultation and tele-supervision was reviewed and found that tele-consultation and tele-supervision to be an effective modality for insuring quality mental health care delivery in low-resource settings. Additionally, two case studies were included which illustrate the use of both tele-consultation and tele-supervision in low-resource low- and middle-income settings. The paper concludes that tele-consultation and tele-supervision hold the promise to narrow the gap in quality mental health services in low-resource settings so often impacted by disaster and conflict. The authors recommend that telemental health training be developed that specifically enhances consultants' and supervisors' skills in tele-consultation and tele-supervision.","Augusterfer, Eugene F; O039,; Neal, Colleen R; Martin, Shannon W; Sheikh, Taiwo Lateef; Mollica, Richard F",Curr Psychiatry Rep,,33

222963,It's Not Your Fault,2021,"Forecasting the outcome of outbreaks as early and as accurately as possible is crucial for decision making and policy implementations. A significant challenge faced by forecasters is that not all outbreaks and epidemics turn into pandemics making the prediction of their severity difficult. At the same time, the decisions made to enforce lockdowns and other mitigating interventions versus their socioeconomic consequences are not only hard to make, but also highly uncertain. The majority of modeling approaches to outbreaks, epidemics, and pandemics take an epidemiological approach that considers biological and disease processes. In this paper, we accept the limitations of forecasting to predict the long-term trajectory of an outbreak, and instead, we propose a statistical, time-series approach to modelling and predicting the short-term behaviour of COVID-19. Our model assumes a multiplicative trend, aiming to capture the continuation of the two variables we predict (global confirmed cases and deaths) as well as their uncertainty. We present the timeline of producing and evaluating 10-day-ahead forecasts over a period of four months. Our simple model offers competitive forecast accuracy and estimates of uncertainty that are useful and practically relevant.","Petropoulos, Fotios; Makridakis, Spyros; Stylianou, Neophytos",International journal of forecasting,,33

225032,Viral Fundamentals: Riding the Corona Waves in India,2020,"PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: To study the prevalence of anxiety-depressive disorders and sleep disorders in their structure among patients hospitalized in connection with COVID-19, as well as to develop differentiated recommendations for their therapy in patients with new coronavirus infection. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this publication, the authors present preliminary results of their own observations of psychoemotional disorders and sleep disorders in their structure in patients with a new coronavirus infection. We analyzed the data of 119 patients (aged 47 to 69 years, male and female), conducted a detailed interview, including using telemedicine technologies, and assessed the scales: The hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), subjective the asthenia rating scale (MFI-20, Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory) and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire. RESULTS: According to the results of the HADS questionnaire, clinically pronounced anxiety-depressive symptoms were observed in 33 (28%) patients of 119 hospitalized in connection with the diagnosis of COVID-19. Of them, only clinically significant anxiety was recorded in 11% of cases (n=13), in 5 (4%) patients - clinically significant depression, an increase in both subscales of anxiety and depression - in 13% (n=15). An increase in the MFI-20 scale (more than 20 points) was found in 87 (73%) patients, sleep disorders in accordance with the PSQI questionnaire was recorded in 32 (27%) patients. CONCLUSION: According to the results of the study, it was noted that in most patients with COVID-19, along with a depressive symptom complex, anxiety and hypochondriacal disorders, an asthenic symptom complex, sleep disturbances with difficulty falling asleep, and dissatisfaction with the quality of sleep are recorded. Differentiated recommendations for the treatment of the studied conditions have been developed, taking into account the side effects of the prescribed drugs, drug interactions and the characteristics of the somatic status of patients. The choice of the drug should be based on the severity of the violations identified.","Samushiya, M A; Kryzhanovsky, S M; Ragimova, A A; Berishvili, T Z; Chorbinskaya, S A; Ivannikova, E I",Zh Nevrol Psikhiatr Im S S Korsakova,,33

226791,Chitosan-drug encapsulation as a potential candidate for COVID-19 drug delivery systems: A review,2020,"Background: In many low- and middle-income countries, where vaccinations will be delayed and healthcare systems are underdeveloped, the COVID-19 pandemic will continue for the foreseeable future. Mortality scales can aid frontline providers in low-resource settings (LRS) in identifying those at greatest risk of death so that limited resources can be directed towards those in greatest need and unnecessary loss of life is prevented. While many prognostication tools have been developed for, or applied to, COVID-19 patients, no tools to date have been purpose-designed for, and validated in, LRS. Objectives: This study aimed to develop a pragmatic tool to assist LRS frontline providers in evaluating in-hospital mortality risk using only easy-to-obtain demographic and clinical inputs. Methods: Machine learning was used on data from a retrospective cohort of Sudanese COVID-19 patients at two government referral hospitals to derive contextually appropriate mortality indices for COVID-19, which were then assessed by C-indices. Findings: Data from 467 patients were used to derive two versions of the AFEM COVID-19 Mortality Scale (AFEM-CMS), which evaluates in-hospital mortality risk using demographic and clinical inputs that are readily obtainable in hospital receiving areas. Both versions of the tool include age, sex, number of comorbidities, Glasgow Coma Scale, respiratory rate, and systolic blood pressure; in settings with pulse oximetry, oxygen saturation is included and in settings without access, heart rate is included. The AFEM-CMS showed good discrimination: the model including pulse oximetry had a C-statistic of 0.775 (95% CI: 0.737-0.813) and the model excluding it had a C-statistic of 0.719 (95% CI: 0.678-0.760). Conclusions: In the face of an enduring pandemic in many LRS, the AFEM-CMS serves as a practical solution to aid frontline providers in effectively allocating healthcare resources. The tool's generalisability is likely narrow outside of similar extremely LRS settings, and further validation studies are essential prior to broader use.","Pigoga, J L; Omer, Y O; Wallis, L A",Ann Glob Health,,33

229485,Memorials to John Snow - Pioneer in anaesthesia and epidemiology,2021,"AIMS: Type 2 diabetes is considered to be one of the essential risks of adverse outcomes in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).1 Metformin and insulin were suggested to affect the outcomes. However, divergent views are still expressed. We aim to gain further insight into metformin and insulin in both pre-admission and in-hospital usage in COVID-19 patients with pre-existed type 2 diabetes. MAIN METHODS: This is a multicentral retrospective study of the hospital confirmed COVID-19 patients between January 19 to April 09, 2020, who admitted to 3 main hospitals in Xiangyang city, China. The effect of type 2 diabetes, metformin, and insulin on COVID-19 were analyzed, respectively. Clinical characteristics, blood laboratory indices, clinical observational indices, and outcomes of these cases were collected. KEY FINDINGS: A total of 407 confirmed COVID-19 patients (including 50 pre-existed type 2 diabetes) were eligible in our study. COVID-19 patients with type 2 diabetes had more adverse outcomes than non-diabetes (OR2: mortality: 1.46 [95% CI3 1.11, 1.93]; P < 0.001). Pre-admission metformin usage showed a declined intensive care unit admission rate in a dose-dependent fashion (OR 0.04 [95% CI 0.00, 0.99]; adjust P = 0.049). While in-hospital insulin usage attempted to increase the invasive ventilation (8 [34.8%] vs. 1 [3.7%], adjust P = 0.043), independent of age and blood glucose. SIGNIFICANCE: Our study indicated that pre-admitted metformin usage may have beneficial effects on COVID-19 with pre-existed type 2 diabetes, insulin should be used sparingly in the hospital stay.","Cheng, Xueqi; Xin, Siyi; Chen, Yaqi; Li, Leyu; Chen, Wanjun; Li, Wenjia; Zhou, Baoan; Li, Chenxia; Gong, Yu; Li, Fei; Duan, Peng; Zhou, Xingjian",Life Sci,,33

In-hospital death occurred in 37 of 90 patients (41.1%) with HF history vs. 126 of those with no HF history (20.9%). The increased risk of death associated with HF history remained significant after adjustment for clinical variables related to COVID-19 and HF severity, including comorbidities, oxygen saturation, lymphocyte count and plasma troponin [adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for death: 2.25; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.26-4.02; P = 0.006 at multivariable Cox regression model including 404 patients]. Patients with a history of HF also had more in-hospital complications including acute HF (33.3% vs. 5.1%, P < 0.001), acute renal failure (28.1% vs. 12.9%, P < 0.001), multiorgan failure (15.9% vs. 5.8%, P = 0.004) and sepsis (18.4% vs. 8.9%, P = 0.006). Other independent predictors of outcome were age, sex, oxygen saturation and oxygen partial pressure at arterial gas analysis/fraction of inspired oxygen ratio (PaO2 /FiO2 ). In-hospital treatment with corticosteroids and heparin had beneficial effects (adjusted HR for death: 0.46; 95% CI 0.29-0.74; P = 0.001; n = 404 for corticosteroids, and adjusted HR 0.41; 95% CI 0.25-0.67; P < 0.001; n = 364 for heparin). CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and a history of HF have an extremely poor outcome with higher mortality and in-hospital complications. HF history is an independent predictor of increased in-hospital mortality.","Tomasoni, Daniela; Inciardi, Riccardo M; Lombardi, Carlo M; Tedino, Chiara; Agostoni, Piergiuseppe; Ameri, Pietro; Barbieri, Lucia; Bellasi, Antonio; Camporotondo, Rita; Canale, Claudia; Carubelli, Valentina; Carugo, Stefano; Catagnano, Francesco; Dalla Vecchia, Laura A; Danzi, Gian Battista; Di Pasquale, Mattia; Gaudenzi, Margherita; Giovinazzo, Stefano; Gnecchi, Massimiliano; Iorio, Annamaria; La Rovere, Maria Teresa; Leonardi, Sergio; Maccagni, Gloria; Mapelli, Massimo; Margonato, Davide; Merlo, Marco; Monzo, Luca; Mortara, Andrea; Nuzzi, Vincenzo; Piepoli, Massimo; Porto, Italo; Pozzi, Andrea; Sarullo, Filippo; Sinagra, Gianfranco; Volterrani, Maurizio; Zaccone, Gregorio; Guazzi, Marco; Senni, Michele; Metra, Marco",Eur. j. heart fail,,33
233340,On the Potential of Zines as a Medium for Visualization,2021-08-04,"PURPOSE: The current pandemic caused by COVID-19 is the biggest challenge for national health systems for a century. While most medical resources are allocated to treat COVID-19 patients, fractures still need to be treated, as some patients with non-deferrable pathologies. The aim of this paper is to report the early experience of an integrated team of orthopaedic surgeons during this period. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This is a mono-geographic, observational, retrospective, descriptive study. We collected data from the beginning of the epidemic (1 March 2020), during the pandemic lockdown period (declared in the country on March 16, 2020) until the end of our study period on April 15, 2020. All the 140 patients presented to the Emergency Department of the hospital during this period with a diagnosis of fracture, or trauma (sprains, dislocations, wounds) were included in the cohort. In addition, 12 patients needing hospitalization for planning a non-deferrable elective surgical treatment were included. A group of patients from the two same hospitals and treated during the same period (1st March 2018 to April 15, 2018) but previously was used as control. RESULTS: Of these 152 patients (mean age 45.5 years; range 1 to 103), 100 underwent a surgical procedure and 52 were managed non-operatively. Twenty-eight were children and 124 were adults. The COVID-19 diagnosis was confirmed for four patients. The frequency of patients with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis among this population treated in emergency was ten fold higher (2.6%; 4 among 152) than in the general population (0.30%) of the country. The mortality rate for patients with surgery was 2% (2 of 100 patients) and 50% (2 of 4) for those older than 60 years with COVID-19; it was null for patients who were managed non-operatively. As compared to the year 2018, the number of patients seen with trauma had decreased of 32% during the epidemic. CONCLUSION: Staying home during the COVID-19 pandemic decreased trauma frequency of 32%. The structural organization in our hospital allowed us to reduce the time to surgery and ultimately hospital stay, thereby maximizing the already stretched medical resources available to treat all the patients who needed orthopedic care during this period.","Hernigou, Jacques; Morel, Xavier; Callewier, Antoine; Bath, Olivier; Hernigou, Philippe",Int Orthop,,33
233352,Demystifying the mist: Sources of microbial bioload in dental aerosols,2020,"Background and Purpose: Chloroquine is a traditional medicine to treat malaria. There is increasing evidence that chloroquine not only induces phagocytosis but regulates vascular tone. Few reports investigating the effect of chloroquine on vascular responsiveness of coronary arteries have been made. In this study, we examined how chloroquine affected endothelium-dependent relaxation in coronary arteries under normal and diabetic conditions. Experimental Approach: We isolated coronary arteries from mice and examined endothelium-dependent relaxation (EDR). Human coronary endothelial cells and mouse coronary endothelial cells isolated from control and diabetic mouse (TALLYHO/Jng [TH] mice, a spontaneous type 2 diabetic mouse model) were used for the molecular biological or cytosolic NO and Ca2+measurements. Key Results: Chloroquine inhibited endothelium-derived NO-dependent relaxation but had negligible effect on endothelium-derived hyperpolarization (EDH)-dependent relaxation in coronary arteries of control mice. Chloroquine significantly decreased NO production in control human coronary endothelial cells partly by phosphorylating eNOSThr495(an inhibitory phosphorylation site of eNOS) and attenuating the rise of cytosolic Ca2+concentration after stimulation. EDR was significantly inhibited in diabetic mice in comparison to control mice. Interestingly, chloroquine enhanced EDR in diabetic coronary arteries by, specifically, increasing EDH-dependent relaxation due partly to its augmenting effect on gap junction activity in diabetic mouse coronary endothelial cells. Conclusions and Implications: These data indicate that chloroquine affects vascular relaxation differently under normal and diabetic conditions. Therefore, the patients' health condition such as coronary macrovascular or microvascular disease, with or without diabetes, must be taken account into the consideration when selecting chloroquine for the treatment of malaria.","Zhang, Qian; Tsuji-Hosokawa, Atsumi; Willson, Conor; Watanabe, Makiko; Si, Rui; Lai, Ning; Wang, Ziyi; Yuan, Jason X.-J.; Wang, Jian; Makino, Ayako",Br.

We reviewed the measures used to assess physical performance in these patients. Secondary targets were measures of exercise or daily life activities induced symptoms. METHODS: Medline, CINAHL, and Pedro databases were searched from January 2020 to February 2021 for articles in the English language. Two investigators independently conducted the search, screened all titles and/or abstracts based on the inclusion criteria and independently scored the studies. The quality of the studies was evaluated by two reviewers according to the NIH quality assessment tool for observational cohort and cross-sectional studies. Discrepancies were resolved through consensus. RESULTS: Out of 156 potentially relevant articles, 31 observational studies (8 cross-sectional), 1 randomized controlled trial, and 1 protocol were included. The quality of most of the 31 evaluable studies was judged as low (11 studies) or fair (14 studies). Sample sizes of the studies ranged from 14 to 20,889 patients. among the 28 reported measures, Barthel Index (42.4% of studies), Six-Minute Walking Distance Test (36.4%), Short Physical Performance Battery (21.2%) and 1-Minute Sit-to-Stand (12.1%) were the most used. Fifteen% and 36% of studies reported exercise induced desaturation and dyspnoea when performing the assessments, respectively. Other exercise induced symptoms were fatigue and pain. Studies reported wide ranges of impairment in physical performance as compared to ""reference"" values (range of mean or median reported values vs ""reference values"": 11-77 vs 100 points for Barthel Index; 11-22 vs 22-37 repetitions/min for 1m-STS; 0.5-7.9 vs 11.4 ± 1.3 points for SPPB; and 45-223 vs 380-782 m for 6MWT respectively). CONCLUSION: This review found that a wide variety of functional status tests have been used, making comparisons difficult between studies. These measures show impairment in physical performance in COVID-19 patients. However, the quality of most of the studies was judged as low or fair.","Simonelli, Carla; Paneroni, Mara; Vitacca, Michele; Ambrosino, Nicolino","Pulmonology (Barc., Print)",,33

237459,Optimal step length for the Newton method near the minimum of a self-concordant function,2020-03-19,"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic worldwide necessitates the development of therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2. ACE2 is the main receptor of SARS-CoV-2 S1 and mediates viral entry into host cells. Herein, membrane nanoparticles (NPs) prepared from ACE2-rich cells were discovered to have potent capacity to block SARS-CoV-2 infection. The membranes of human embryonic kidney-239T cells highly expressing ACE2 were applied to prepare NPs using an extrusion method. The nanomaterials, termed ACE2-NPs, contained 265.1 ng mg-1 ACE2 on the surface and acted as baits to trap S1 in a dose-dependent manner, resulting in reduced recruitment of the viral ligand to HK-2 human renal tubular epithelial cells. Aside from affecting receptor recongnition, S1 translocated to the cytoplasm and induced apoptosis by reducing optic atrophy 1 expression and increasing cytochrome c release, which was also inhibited by ACE2-NPs. Further investigations revealed that ACE2-NPs efficiently suppressed SARS-CoV-2 S pseudovirions entry into host cells and blocked viral infection in vitro and in vivo. This study characterizes easy-to-produce memrbane nanoantagonists of SARS-CoV-2 that enrich the existing antiviral arsenal and provide possibilities for COVID-19 treatment.","Wang, Cheng; Wang, Shaobo; Chen, Yin; Zhao, Jianqi; Han, Songling; Zhao, Gaomei; Kang, Jing; Liu, Yong; Wang, Liting; Wang, Xiaoyang; Xu, Yang; Wang, Song; Huang, Yi; Wang, Junping; Zhao, Jinghong",ACS Nano,,33

238206,Overview of the virtual 2020 FDA's circulatory system devices advisory panel on Neovasc reducer system,2021,"PURPOSE: Symptomatic adult spinal deformity (ASD) with an extremely variable presentation with pain, with and without neurogenic leg pain, and/or disturbed sagittal and coronal balance, causes a significant societal burden of disease. It is an important consequence of the aging adult population, generating a plethora of spine-related interventions with variable treatment efficacy and consistently high costs. Recent years have witnessed more than a threefold increase in the prevalence and treatment of ASD, and further increases over the coming decades are expected with the growing elderly population worldwide. The ability to monitor and assess clinical outcomes has not kept pace with these developments. This paper addresses the pressing need to provide a set of common outcome metrics for this growing group of patients with back pain and other disabilities due to an adult spinal deformity. METHODS: The standard outcome set was created by a panel with global representation, using a thorough modified Delphi procedure. The three-tiered outcome hierarchy (Porter) was used as a framework to capture full cycle of care. The standardized language of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (WHO-ICF) was used. RESULTS: Consensus was reached on a core set of 25 WHO-ICF outcome domains ('What to measure'); on the accompanying globally available clinician and patient reported measurement instruments and definitions ('How to measure'), and on the timing of the measurements ('When to measure'). The current work has brought to light domains not routinely reported in the spinal literature (such as pulmonary function, return to work, social participation), and domains for which no adequate instruments have yet been identified (such as how to clinically quantify in routine practice lumbar spinal stenosis, neurogenic claudication, radicular pain, and loss of lower extremity motor function). CONCLUSION: A standard outcome set was developed for patients undergoing treatment for adult spinal deformity using globally available outcome metrics. The current framework can be considered a reference for further work, and may provide a starting point for routine methodical and systematic monitoring of outcomes. Post-COVID e-health may accelerate the routine capture of these types of data.","de Kleuver, Marinus; Faraj, Sayf S A; Haanstra, Tsjitske M; Wright, Anna K; Polly, David W; van Hooff, Miranda L; Glassman, Steven D",Spine Deform,,33

239980,Improvement of physical training by performance-enhancing substances,2020,"As some patients infected with the novel coronavirus progress to critical illness, a subset will eventually develop shock. High-quality data on management of these patients are scarce, and further investigation will provide valuable information in the context of the pandemic. A group of experts identify a set of pragmatic recommendations for the care of patients with SARS-CoV-2 and shock in resource-limited environments. We define shock as life-threatening circulatory failure that results in inadequate tissue perfusion and cellular dysoxia/hypoxia, and suggest that it can be operationalized via clinical observations. We suggest a thorough evaluation for other potential causes of shock and suggest against indiscriminate testing for coinfections. We suggest the use of the quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) as a simple bedside prognostic score for COVID-19 patients and point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) to evaluate the etiology of shock. Regarding fluid therapy for the treatment of COVID-19 patients with shock in low-middle-income countries, we favor balanced crystalloids and recommend using a conservative fluid strategy for resuscitation. Where available and not prohibited by cost, we recommend using norepinephrine, given its safety profile. We favor avoiding the routine use of central venous or arterial catheters, where availability and costs are strong considerations. We also recommend using low-dose corticosteroids in patients with refractory shock. In addressing targets of resuscitation, we recommend the use of simple bedside parameters such as capillary refill time and suggest that POCUS be used to assess the need for further fluid resuscitation, if available.","Maximous, Stephanie; Brotherton, Brian Jason; Achilleos, Andrew; Akrami, Kevan M; Barros, Lia M; Cobb, Natalie; Misango, David; Papali, Alfred; Park, Casey; Shetty, Varun U; Schultz, Marcus J; Taran, Shaurya; Lee, Burton W",Am. j. trop. med. hyg,,33

A survey was carried out by the Intermittent Water Supply Specialist Group of the International Water Association (IWA IWS SG) to better understand the current state of these systems and challenges that water companies may have faced under COVID-19 pandemic and to capture successful management strategies applied by water utilities. The survey consisted of three parts: (1) general information about IWS systems, (2) current state of IWS and (3) resilience of IWS under COVID-19 conditions, as well as some questions about potential interventions in order to improve system performance in general and under future uncertain conditions. The survey responses were evaluated based on the Safe & SuRe resilience framework, assessing measures of mitigation, adaptation, coping and learning, and exploring organisational and operational responses of IWS utilities. Infrastructure capacity and water resources availability were identified as the main causes of intermittency in most water distribution systems, while intermittent electricity was considered as the main external cause. Participants indicated that some risk assessment process was in place;however, COVID-19 has surpassed any provisions made to address the risks. Lessons learnt highlighted the importance of financial resources, e-infrastructure for efficient system operation and communication with consumers, and the critical role of international knowledge transfer and the sharing of best practice guidelines for improving resilience and transitioning towards continuous water supply.","Farmani, R.; Dalton, J.; Charalambous, B.; Lawson, E.; Bunney, S.; Cotterill, S.",Aqua-Water Infrastructure Ecosystems and Society,,33

The COVID-19 pandemic has further disrupted communication between clinicians and their patients and families. The dependence on phone communication and the physical barriers of protective gear limit nonverbal communication and diminish clinicians' ability to recognize and respond to emotion. Developing new approaches to teach communication skills to trainees who are often responsible for communicating with patients and their families is challenging, especially during a pandemic or other crisis. ""Just-in-time"" simulation-simulation-based training immediately before an intervention-provides the scaffolding and support trainees need for conducting difficult conversations, and it enhances patients' and families' experiences. Using a realistic scenario, the author illustrates key steps for effectively using just-in-time simulation-based communication training: assessing the learner's understanding of the situation; determining what aspects of the encounter may prove most challenging; providing a script as a cognitive aid; refreshing or teaching a specific skill; preparing learners emotionally through reflection and mental rehearsal; coaching on the approach, pace, and tone for a delivery that conveys empathy and meaning; and providing specific, honest, and curious feedback to close a performance gap. Additionally, the author acknowledges that clinical conditions sometimes require learning by observing rather than doing and has thus provided guidance for making the most of vicarious observational learning: identify potential challenges in the encounter and explicitly connect them to trainee learning goals; explain why a more advanced member of the team is conducting the conversation; ask the trainee to observe and prepare feedback; choose the location carefully; identify everyone's role at the beginning of the conversation; debrief; share reactions; and thank the trainee for their feedback and observations.","Rock, Laura K",Acad. med,,33

Operating room (OR) best practice in this crisis is poorly defined. This systematic review was performed to identify contemporary evidence relating to OR practice in the context of COVID-19. METHODS: MEDLINE was searched systematically using PubMed (search date 19 March 2020) for relevant studies in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Documented practices and guidance were assessed to determine Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (OCEBM) levels of evidence, and recommendations for practice within five domains were extracted: physical OR, personnel, patient, procedure, and other factors. RESULTS: Thirty-five articles were identified, of which 11 met eligibility criteria. Nine articles constituted expert opinion and two were retrospective studies. All articles originated from the Far East (China, 9; Singapore, 2); eight of the articles concerned general surgery. Common themes were identified within each domain, but all recommendations were based on low levels of evidence (median OCEBM level 5 (range 4-5)). The highest number of overlapping recommendations related to physical OR (8 articles) and procedural factors (13). Although few recommendations related to personnel factors, consensus was high in this domain, with all studies mandating the use of personal protective equipment. CONCLUSION: There was little evidence to inform this systematic review, but there was consensus regarding many aspects of OR practice.

241723,"Eberhard Willich, 1919-2020",2021,"OBJECTIVES: We aimed to estimate the seroprevalence of COVID-19 in a rural district of South India, six months after the index case. METHODOLOGY: We conducted a cross-sectional study of 509 adults aged more than 18 years. From all the four subdistricts, two grampanchayats (administrative cluster of 5-8 villages) were randomly selected followed by one village through convenience. The participants were invited for the study to the community-based study kiosk set up in all the eight villages through village health committees. We collected socio-demographic characteristics and symptoms using a mobile application-based questionnaire, and we tested samples for the presence of IgG antibodies for SARS CoV-2 using an electro chemiluminescent immunoassay. We calculated age-gender adjusted and test performance adjusted seroprevalence. RESULTS: The age-and gender-adjusted seroprevalence was 8.5% (95% CI 6.9%- 10.8%). The unadjusted seroprevalence among participants with hypertension and diabetes was 16.3% (95% CI:9.2-25.8) and 10.7% (95% CI: 5.5-18.3) respectively. When we adjusted for the test performance, the seroprevalence was 6.1% (95% CI 4.02-8.17). The study estimated 7 (95% CI 1:4.5-1:9) undetected infected individuals for every RT-PCR confirmed case. Infection Fatality Rate (IFR) was calculated as 12.38 per 10000 infections as on 22 October 2020. History of self-reported symptoms and education were significantly associated with positive status (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: A significant proportion of the rural population in a district of south India remains susceptible to COVID-19. A higher proportion of susceptible, relatively higher IFR and a poor tertiary healthcare network stress the importance of sustaining the public health measures and promoting early access to the vaccine are crucial to preserving the health of this population. Low population density, good housing, adequate ventilation, limited urbanisation combined with public, private and local health leadership are critical components of curbing future respiratory pandemics.","Inbaraj, Leeberk Raja; George, Carolin Elizabeth; Chandrasingh, Sindhulina",PLoS One,,33

DNA methylation (DNAm) changes may elucidate adverse health effects of environmental exposures. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of allergen and diesel exhaust (DE) exposures on global DNAm and its regulation enzymes in human airway epithelium. METHODS: 11 participants, including 7 with and 4 without airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), were recruited for a randomized, double-blinded crossover study. Each participant had 3 exposures: filtered air + saline (FA-S), filtered air + allergen (FA-A), and DE + allergen (DE-A). 48 hours post-exposure, endobronchial biopsies and bronchoalveolar lavages (BAL) were collected. Levels of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) and ten-eleven translocation enzymes (TETs), 5-methylcytosine (5mC), and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) were determined by immunohistochemistry. Cytokines and chemokines in BAL were measured by electrochemiluminescence multiplex assays. RESULTS: Predominant DNMT (pDNMT, the most abundant among DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B), and predominant TET (pTET, the most abundant among TET1, TET2, and TET3) were participant-dependent. 5mC and its regulation enzymes differed between participants with and without AHR at baseline (FA-S) and in response to allergen challenge (regardless of DE exposure). pDNMT and pTET correlated with lung function. Allergen challenge effect on interleukin-8 in BAL was modified by TET2 baseline levels in the epithelium. CONCLUSIONS: Response to allergen challenge is associated with key DNAm regulation enzymes. This relationship is generally unaltered by DE co-exposure but is rather dependent on AHR status. These enzymes therefore warranted further inquiry regarding their potential in diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of asthma.","Li, Hang; Ryu, Min Hyung; Rider, Christopher F; Tse, Wayne; Clifford, Rachel L; Aristizabal, Maria J; Wen, Weiping; Carlsten, Chris",J. allergy clin. immunol,,33
241950,Predictors of Transradial Failure in Neurointerventional Procedures,2020,"Kenya is home to Africa's third largest population of dromedary camels, and production at commercial and local levels are increasingly important. In pastoral and nomadic communities in the arid and semi-arid lands (ASALs), camels play a vital role in food security, while commercial milk production and formalized export markets are rapidly emerging as camel populations expand into non-traditional areas. Until recently, little focus was placed on camels as hosts of zoonotic disease, but the emergence of Middle Eastern respiratory coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, and the discovery of exposure to the virus in Kenyan camels, highlighted the need for further understanding of this area. This systematised review utilised a robust search strategy to assess the occurrence of camel-associated zoonoses in Kenya and to evaluate the quality of the published literature. Seventy-four studies were identified, covering sixteen pathogens, with an increasing number of good quality studies in recent years. Despite this, the area remains under-researched and there is a lack of robust, high-quality research. Trypanosome spp., Echinococcus granulosus and Brucella spp. appeared most frequently in the literature. Pathogens with the highest reported prevalence were MERS-CoV (0-100%), Echinococcus granulosa (7-60%) and Rift Valley fever virus (7-57%). Exposure to Brucella spp., Coxiella burnetii and Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus showed higher levels in camel or camel-associated vectors than other livestock species, although brucellosis was the only disease for which there was robust evidence linking camel and human exposure. Zoonotic agents with less severe human health outcomes, such as Dermatophilosus congolensis and contagious ecthyma, were also represented in the literature. This review provides an important summary of the scope and quality of current knowledge. It demonstrates that further research, and improved adherence to robust study design and reporting are essential if the zoonotic risk from camels in Kenya, and elsewhere, is to be better understood.","Hughes, Ellen Clare; Anderson, Neil Euan",,,33
242202,In Reply: Precautions for Endoscopic Transnasal Skull Base Surgery During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"Saliva has been proposed as an alternative to upper airway swabs when testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Although some studies have suggested higher viral loads and clinical sensitivity when testing saliva, studies have been relatively small and have given rise to contradictory results. To better understand the relative performance characteristics of saliva and upper airway samples, I performed a rapid systematic review (registered on PROSPERO as CRD42020205035), focusing on studies that included at least 20 subjects who provided diagnostic saliva and upper airway samples on the same day, which were tested by nucleic acid amplification methods and for which a confusion matrix could be constructed for based on a composite reference standard. Nineteen studies comprising 21 cohorts that met predetermined acceptance criteria were identified following a search of PubMed, medRxiv, and bioRxiv. Seven of these cohorts were incorporated into a meta-analysis using a random effects model, which suggests that nasopharyngeal swabs are somewhat more sensitive than saliva samples for the diagnosis of early disease in ambulatory patients, such as in drive-through centers or community health centers. Nevertheless, the difference is modest, and the reduced need for personal protective equipment for saliva sampling may justify the difference. Conclusions are limited by the significant heterogeneity of disease prevalence in the study populations and variation in the approaches to saliva sample collection.","O039,; Leary, Timothy J",J Mol Diagn,,33

One possible side effect is the depletion of implantable pulse generator (IPG) battery and the associated sudden recurrence of PD or dystonia symptoms, which can be potentially life-threatening. Delayed or postponed outpatient visits due to COVID -19 may be a risk factor of battery end-of-life consequences. OBJECTIVE: To analyse the clinical outcomes in reported PD and dystonia patients treated with DBS, who, as a result of the sudden depletion of the neurostimulator battery, developed life-threatening symptoms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The databases of PubMed, Scopus, EMBASE and Google Scholar were searched using pre-established criteria. RESULTS: A total of 244 articles was found, of which 12 met the adopted criteria. Selected papers presented a total of 17 case reports of DBS-treated patients - 11 with PD, and six with dystonia - who had depleted IPG batteries and due to rapid worsening of PD/dystonia symptoms required urgent hospital admission. IPG battery replacement was the only effective treatment in the majority of cases. CONCLUSIONS: IPG battery depletion can result in fatal outcomes. Sudden recurrence of PD or dystonia symptoms in patients treated by DBS can be potentially life-threatening, so scheduling the replacement of a discharged IPG battery should not be postponed. The COVID-19 pandemic should alert staff at emergency, neurology and movement disorders wards not to postpone the visits of patients with an implanted DBS system.","Przytula, Filip; Dulski, Jaroslaw; Sobstyl, Michal; Slawek, Jaroslaw",Neurol. neurochir. pol,,33

Increased transmission and poor outcomes noted in emerging data on patients with cancer and COVID-19 call for aggressive isolation and minimization of nosocomial exposure. Palliative care and oncology providers are posed with unique challenges due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Telepalliative care is the use of telehealth services for remotely delivering palliative care to patients through videoconferencing, telephonic communication, or remote symptom monitoring. It offers great promise in addressing the palliative and supportive care needs of patients with advanced cancer during the ongoing pandemic.

Using the reference strain SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020, we evaluated modes of transmission and the ability of prior infection or vaccine-induced immunity to protect against infection in ferrets. Ferrets were semi-permissive to infection with the USA-WA1/2020 isolate. When transmission was assessed via the detection of vRNA at multiple timepoints, direct contact transmission was efficient to 3/3 and 3/4 contact animals in two respective studies, while respiratory droplet transmission was poor to only 1/4 contact animals. To determine if previously infected ferrets were protected against re-infection, ferrets were re-challenged 28 or 56 days post-infection. Following viral challenge, no infectious virus was recovered in nasal wash samples. In addition, levels of vRNA in the nasal wash were several orders of magnitude lower than during primary infection, and vRNA was rapidly cleared. To determine if intramuscular vaccination protected ferrets, ferrets were vaccinated using a prime-boost strategy with the S-protein receptor-binding domain formulated with an oil-in-water adjuvant. Upon viral challenge, none of the mock or vaccinated animals were protected against infection, and there were no significant differences in vRNA or infectious virus titers in the nasal wash. Combined these studies demonstrate that in ferrets direct contact is the predominant mode of transmission of the USA-WA1/2020 isolate and immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is maintained for at least 56 days. Our studies also indicate protection of the upper respiratory tract against SARS-CoV-2 will require vaccine strategies that mimic natural infection or induce site-specific immunity.Importance:The SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020 strain is a CDC reference strain used by multiple research laboratories. Here, we show the predominant mode of transmission of this isolate in ferrets is by direct contact. We further demonstrate ferrets are protected against re-infection for at least 56 days even when levels of neutralizing antibodies are low or undetectable. Last, we show that when ferrets were vaccinated by the intramuscular route to induce antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, ferrets remain susceptible to infection of the upper respiratory tract. Collectively, these studies suggest protection of the upper respiratory tract will require vaccine approaches that mimic natural infection.","Patel, Devanshi R; Field, Cassandra J; Septer, Kayla M; Sim, Derek G; Jones, Matthew J; Heinly, Talia A; Vanderford, Thomas H; McGraw, Elizabeth A; Sutton, Troy C",J. virol,,33

METHODS: The study was carried out on a selected group of 60 healthy subjects. All subjects were trained to voice a vocal sample of a sustained /a/, at a conversational voice intensity for the Maximum Phonation Time (MPT), wearing the surgical mask and then without wearing the surgical mask. Voice samples were recorded directly in Praat. RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences in any acoustic parameter between the masked and unmasked condition. There was a non-significant decrease in vocal intensity in 65% of the subjects while wearing a surgical mask. CONCLUSIONS: The statistical comparison carried out between all the acoustic voice parameters observed, extracted wearing and not wearing a surgical mask did not reveal any significant statistical difference. Most of the subjects, after wearing the surgical mask, presented a decrease in vocal intensity measured. Our conclusion was that wearing a mask is likely to induce the unconscious need to increase the vocal effort, resulting over time in a greater risk of developing functional dysphonia. The reduction of intensity can affect also social interaction and speech audibility, especially for individuals with hearing loss.","Fiorella, Maria Luisa; Cavallaro, Giada; Di Nicola, Vincenzo; Quaranta, Nicola",J. voice,,33

245623,Prejudice in science - Lessons from the coronavirus story,2020,"The main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2 is a highly conserved and mutation-resistant coronaviral enzyme, which plays a pivotal role in viral replication, making it an ideal target for the development of novel broad-spectrum anti-coronaviral drugs. In this study, a codon-optimized Mpro gene was cloned into pET-21a and pET-28a expression vectors. The recombinant plasmids were transformed into E. coli Rosetta(DE3) competent cells and the expression conditions were optimized. The highly expressed recombinant proteins, Mpro and Mpro-28, were purified by HisTrapTM chelating column and its proteolytic activity was determined by a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay. The FRET assay showed that Mpro exhibits a desirable proteolytic activity (25 000 U/mg), with Km and kcat values of 11.68 µmol/L and 0.037/s, respectively. The specific activity of Mpro is 25 times that of Mpro-28, a fusion protein carrying a polyhistidine tag at the N and C termini, indicating additional residues at the N terminus of Mpro, but not at the C terminus, are detrimental to its proteolytic activity. The preparation of active SARS-CoV-2 Mpro through codon-optimization strategy might facilitate the development of the rapid screening assays for the discovery of broad-spectrum anti-coronaviral drugs targeting Mpro.","Chen, Yunyu; Fu, Zhenghao; Yan, Gangan; Lin, Yuan; Liu, Xiaoping",Sheng Wu Gong Cheng Xue Bao,,33

The relationship between severe SARS-CoV-2 infection and specific mental disturbances remains poorly understood. Aimto reveal the possibility of identifying the typology and frequency of psychiatric syndromes associated with acute COVID-19 using cluster analysis of discrete psychopathological phenomena. Materials and methodsDescriptive data on the mental state of 55 inpatients with COVID-19 were obtained by young-career physicians with psychiatric backgrounds. Classification of observed clinical phenomena was performed with k-means cluster analysis of variables codded from the main psychopathological symptoms. Dispersion analysis with p-level 0.05 was used to reveal the clusters differences in demography, parameters of inflammation and respiration function collected on the basis of the original medical records. ResultsThree resulting clusters of patients were identified: persons with anxiety, disorders of fluency and tempo of thinking, mood, attention, motor-volitional sphere, reduced insight, and pessimistic plans for the future (n=11); persons without psychopathology (n=37); persons with disorientation, disorders of memory, attention, fluency, and tempo of thinking, reduced insight (n=7).

The current study aimed to (1) conduct a preliminary assessment of patients' perspectives regarding this transition, and (2) explore potential demographic, clinical, and treatment-related factors associated with these perspectives. METHODS: Sixty-three patients with EDs whose treatment was moved to an online format, were surveyed during the COVID-19 lockdown (April-May 2020). A 6-item measure was developed to examine their perspectives toward this transition. Exploratory factor analyses (EFAs) were conducted to confirm the rational-theoretical structure of the measure (Eigenvalue = 3.745, explaining 62.4% of variance). The Cronbach's alpha value was excellent (&#945; = 0.878). Validated questionnaires were used to measure ED symptoms, general psychopathology, therapeutic alliance, and pandemic anxiety, and their associations with our transition-focused scale and telemedicine satisfaction were examined. RESULTS: Mixed views were found regarding the transition, with the majority (68%) stating that they would not choose to continue online therapy given the option. Longer duration of treatment (r = 0.291, p = 0.022), stronger therapeutic alliance (r = 0.293, p = 0.028), and higher COVID-19 anxiety (r = 0.276, p = 0.029) were linked with more positive views towards the transition. CONCLUSIONS: Analyses suggest that patients' perspectives towards the transition can be measured using a Likert-type 6-item scale. Findings highlight the various responses to online treatment and indicate a need to identify patients who may face difficulties in the transition to this newly ubiquitous treatment mode. Clinicians should be cognizant of these potential difficulties and consider appropriate modes of treatment in the ongoing pandemic situation.","Lewis, Yael Doreen; Elran-Barak, Roni; Grundman-Shem Tov, Rinat; Zubery, Eynat",J Eat Disord,,33

In contrast to acute COVID-19 infection, which is usually mild in children, 68% of patients with MIS-C will need intensive care unit. Myocarditis and coronary artery ectasia/aneurysm are included between the main cardiovascular complications in MIS-C. Therefore, close clinical assessment is need it both at diagnosis and during follow-up. Echocardiography is the cornerstone modality for myocardial function and coronary artery evaluation in the acute phase. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) detects diffuse myocardial inflammation including oedema/fibrosis, myocardial perfusion and coronary arteries anatomy during the convalescence and in adolescents, where echocardiography may provide inadequate images. Brain involvement in MIS-C is less frequent compared to cardiovascular disease. However, it is not unusual and should be monitored by clinical evaluation and brain magnetic resonance (MRI), as we still do not know its effect in brain development. Brain MRI in MIS-C shows T2-hyperintense lesions associated with restricted diffusion and bilateral thalamic lesions. To conclude, MIS-C is a multisystem disease affecting many vital organs, such as heart and brain. Clinical awareness, application of innovative, high technology imaging modalities and advanced treatment protocols including supportive and anti-inflammatory medication will help physicians to prevent the dreadful complications of MIS-C.","Mavrogeni, Sophie I; Kolovou, Genovefa; Tsirimpis, Vasileios; Kafetzis, Dimitrios; Tsolas, Georgios; Fotis, Lampros",Rheumatol Int,,33

DESIGN: Simulation agent based modeling study. SETTING: Simulated population based on real world US county. PARTICIPANTS: The simulation included 100 000 agents, with a representative distribution of demographics and occupations. Networks of contacts were established to simulate potentially infectious interactions though occupation, household, and random interactions. INTERVENTIONS: Simulation of standard covid-19 vaccination versus delayed second dose vaccination prioritizing the first dose. The simulation runs were replicated 10 times. Sensitivity analyses included first dose vaccine efficacy of 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, and 90% after day 12 post-vaccination; vaccination rate of 0.1%, 0.3%, and 1% of population per day; assuming the vaccine prevents only symptoms but not asymptomatic spread (that is, non-sterilizing vaccine); and an alternative vaccination strategy that implements delayed second dose for people under 65 years of age, but not until all those above this age have been vaccinated. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cumulative covid-19 mortality, cumulative SARS-CoV-2 infections, and cumulative hospital admissions due to covid-19 over 180 days. RESULTS: Over all simulation replications, the median cumulative mortality per 100 000 for standard dosing versus delayed second dose was 226 v 179, 233 v 207, and 235 v 236 for 90%, 80%, and 70% first dose efficacy, respectively. The delayed second dose strategy was optimal for vaccine efficacies at or above 80% and vaccination rates at or below 0.3% of the population per day, under both sterilizing and non-sterilizing vaccine assumptions, resulting in absolute cumulative mortality reductions between 26 and 47 per 100 000. The delayed second dose strategy for people under 65 performed consistently well under all vaccination rates tested.

To identify the frequency and features of SARS-CoV-2 involvement, we performed a clinicopathologic analysis of 75 placental cases from women infected at the time of delivery and 75 uninfected controls. Placental samples were studied with anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunohistochemistry and/or in situ hybridization. Positive results were confirmed by electron microscopy and quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). During delivery, only one woman had symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019, six women reported previous symptoms, and 68 women were asymptomatic. All neonates tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 as per nasopharyngeal swab PCR results. Obstetric histories were unremarkable in 29 of 75 SARS-CoV-2-positive and 8 of 75 SARS-CoV-2-negative women. Placental examination was normal in 12 of 75 infected and 3 of 75 uninfected subjects, respectively. In the remaining cases, placental pathology correlated with obstetric comorbidities without significant differences between SARS-CoV-2-positive and SARS-CoV-2-negative women. SARS-CoV-2 was identified in one placenta of an infected, but asymptomatic, parturient. Viral staining was predominantly localized to the syncytiotrophoblast (STB) which demonstrated marked damage accompanied by perivillous fibrin deposition and mixed intervillositis. A significant decrease of viral titers was detected in the attached umbilical cord compared with the villous parenchyma as per qRT-PCR. SARS-CoV-2 is seldom identified in placentas of infected women. Placental involvement by the virus is characterized by STB damage disrupting the placental barrier and can be seen in asymptomatic mothers without evidence of vertical transmission.","Debelenko, Larisa; Katsyv, Igor; Chong, Alexander M; Peruyero, Leonore; Szabolcs, Matthias; Uhlemann, Anne-Catrin",Hum Pathol,,33

256449,Comment on Ellenberg and Morris: The role of statisticians in vaccine surveillance,2021,"The efficacy of an intervention can be assessed by randomising patients to different diagnostic tests instead of to an intervention and control. This is based on a familiar view that treatment will be more effective if given to patients based on the results of appropriate diagnostic tests (i.e. the correct diagnosis) than if it given to those based on the results of inappropriate tests (i.e. the wrong diagnosis). The tests must have different characteristics e.g. sensitivities with respect to the outcome. This principle is applied by allocating an intervention to an individual if a test result is positive (or on one side of a threshold) and allocating to a control to an individual if the result is negative (or on the other side of the threshold). This can also be done with different dichotomizing thresholds for one test. The frequencies of the outcome in those with each of the four resulting observations are then used to calculate the risk reduction by solving a pair of simultaneous equations. This assumes that the risk reduction and the overall frequency of the outcome is the same in both groups created by randomization. The calculations are illustrated by using data from a randomized controlled trial that assessed the efficacy of the angiotensin receptor blocker in lowering the risk of diabetic nephropathy in patients conditional on different urinary albumin excretion rates. They are also illustrated with simulated data based on a suggested methodology for assessing the effectiveness of test, trace and isolation to reduce transmission of the SARS-Cov-2 virus using RT-PCR and LFD tests.

Over more than a decade, Sentinel has become an integral part of FDA's surveillance capabilities and has been used to conduct analyses that have contributed to regulatory decisions. FDA's role in the COVID-19 pandemic response has necessitated an expansion and enhancement of Sentinel. Here we describe how the Sentinel System has supported FDA's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We highlight new capabilities developed, key data generated to date, and lessons learned, particularly with respect to working with inpatient electronic health record data. Early in the pandemic, Sentinel developed a multi-pronged approach to support FDA's anticipated data and analytic needs. It incorporated new data sources, created a rapidly refreshed database, developed protocols to assess the natural history of COVID-19, validated a diagnosis-code based algorithm for identifying patients with COVID-19 in administrative claims data, and coordinated with other national and international initiatives. Sentinel is poised to answer important questions about the natural history of COVID-19 and is positioned to use this information to study the use, safety, and potentially the effectiveness of medical products used for COVID-19 prevention and treatment.","Cocoros, Noelle M; Fuller, Candace C; Adimadhyam, Sruthi; Ball, Robert; Brown, Jeffrey S; Dal Pan, Gerald J; Kluberg, Sheryl A; Lo Re, Vincent; Maro, Judith C; Nguyen, Michael; Orr, Robert; Paraoan, Dianne; Perlin, Jonathan; Poland, Russell E; Driscoll, Meighan Rogers; Sands, Kenneth; Toh, Sengwee; Yih, W Katherine; Platt, Richard",Pharmacoepidemiol Drug Saf,,33
258135,COVID-19 in Children: Clinical Manifestations and Pharmacological Interventions Including Vaccine Trials,2021,"BACKGROUND: Streptococcus pneumoniae coinfection with influenza results in synergistic lethality, but there are limited data on pneumococcal coinfection with SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: Public Health England conducts invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) and SARS-CoV-2 surveillance in England. IPD trends during 2000/01-2019/20 were analysed and cases between during February-June 2020 were linked with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess risk factors for death. RESULTS: IPD incidence in 2019/20 (7.6/100,000; n=3,964) was 30% (IRR 0.70, 95%CI, 0.18-2.67) lower compared to 2018/19 (10.9/100,000; n=5,666) with large reductions observed across all age-groups during March-June 2020. The serotypes responsible for IPD during 2019/20 were similar to previous years. There were 160,886 SARS-CoV-2 and 1,137 IPD cases during February-June 2020, including 40 IPD/COVID-19 (0.025% [95%sCI, 0.018-0.034] of SARS-CoV-2 infections; 3.5% [95%CI, 2.5-4.8] of IPD cases), 21 with COVID-19 diagnosed 3-27 days after IPD and 27 who developed COVID-19 &#8805;28 days after IPD. Case-fatality rates (CFR) were 63.2% (25/40), 47.6% (10/21) and 33.3% (9/27), respectively (p<0.001). In addition to an independent association with increasing age and pneumococcal serotype group, CFR was 7.8-fold (95% CI, 3.8-15.8) higher in those with IPD/COVID-19 co-infection and 3.9-fold (95% CI, 1.4-10.7) higher in patients who developed COVID-19 3-27 days after IPD compared to patients with IPD only. CONCLUSIONS: Large declines in IPD were observed following COVID-19 lockdown in England. IPD/COVID-19 confections were rare but associated with high CFR, mainly in older adults. The rarity, age distribution and serotype distribution of IPD/SARS-CoV-2 coinfections does not support wider extension of pneumococcal vaccination.","Amin-Chowdhury, Zahin; Aiano, Felicity; Mensah, Anna; Sheppard, Carmen; Litt, David; Fry, Norman K; Andrews, Nick; Ramsay, Mary E; Ladhani, Shamez N",Clin. infect. dis,,33

258725,Patient-centric sampling special focus issue,2020,"In December 2019, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was discovered. Since its emergence, COVID-19 has been outbreaking rapidly worldwide, where the virus has so far caused the death of hundreds of thousands and infected more than a million, what has been called a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). According to the WHO-Coronavirus disease 2019 Situation Report-142, by June 10, 2020, there are 7,145,539 confirmed cases and 408,025 deaths. There is an urgent need to develop a suitable specific medicine against this novel coronavirus; therefore, scientists and researchers around the world are making great efforts endeavoring to discover an efficient specific medication for COVID-19 treatment. Given the similarity of the novel coronavirus with previous epidemic viruses, namely, the acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), previously tested drugs could potentially work against the novel coronavirus. In this narrative review, we aim to summarize and discuss the effectiveness of current Western medicine and traditional Chinese medicine options for COVID-19 treatment based on the overview of the scientific literature. Some Western medicines including remdesivir, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, favipiravir, lopinavir/ritonavir, and arbidol, as well as some traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) such as Qingfei Paidu decoction, Yupingfeng, Lianhua Qingwen, and TCM injections have revealed a relative activity against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, in observational studies, and in clinical trials. However, further extensive studies and clinical trials including double-blind and randomized clinical trials, with a higher number of patients, are necessary to confirm the activity of these medicines. There are several ongoing trials conducted on the drugs of COVID-19, and the results are urgently needed to make a suitable treatment recommendation.","Al-Romaima, Abdulbaset; Liao, Yinan; Feng, Jie; Qin, Xihui; Qin, Guiming",J Thorac Dis,,33

Methods We evaluated country reports from 2018 on adult immunisation programmes sent to WHO and UNICEF. We described existing programmes and used multivariable regression to identify independent factors associated with having them. Results Of 194 WHO Member States, 120 (62%) reported having at least one adult immunisation programme. The Americas and Europe had the highest proportions of adult immunisation programmes, most commonly for hepatitis B and influenza vaccines (&gt; 47% and &gt; 91% of countries, respectively), while Africa and South-East Asia had the lowest proportions, with &lt; 11% of countries reporting adult immunisation programmes for hepatitis B or influenza vaccines, and none for pneumococcal vaccines. In bivariate analyses, high or upper-middle country income, introduction of new or underused vaccines, having achieved paediatric immunisation coverage goals and meeting National Immunisation Technical Advisory Groups basic functional indicators were significantly associated (p &lt; 0.001) with having an adult immunisation programme. In multivariable analyses, the most strongly associated factor was country income, with high- or upper-middle-income countries significantly more likely to report having an adult immunisation programme (adjusted odds ratio: 19.3;95% confidence interval: 6.5-57.7). DiscussionWorldwide, 38% of countries lack adult immunisation programmes. COVID-19 vaccine deployment will require national systems for vaccine storage and handling, delivery and waste management to target adult risk groups. There is a need to strengthen immunisation systems to reach adults with COVID-19 vaccines.","Williams, S. R.; Driscoll, A. J.; LeBuhn, H. M.; Chen, W. H.; Neuzil, K. M.; Ortiz, J.

Such assumptions, however, may not hold in the real world: (1) when there is a shortfall of all products, product substitution may be inadequate unless it is paired with other strategies such as dual sourcing; and (2) production lines do not survive forever and may fail. To relax such assumptions, this paper therefore investigates the situations that the manufacturer may optimize substitution policy and dual sourcing policy to cope with supply chain disruptions. The paper obtains and compares the optimal policies for both deterministic and stochastic demands. A real-world case is also studied to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model.","Wu, Di; Gong, Min; Peng, Rui; Yan, Xiangbin; Wu, Shaomin",Reliab Eng Syst Saf,,33

This study assesses COVID-19 knowledge and case management of informal providers (IPs), trained practitioners of Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homeopathy (AYUSH) and Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) medical doctors providing primary care services in rural Bihar, India. DESIGN: This was a cross-sectional study of primary care providers conducted via telephone between 1 and 15 July 2020. SETTING: Primary care providers from 224 villages in 34 districts across Bihar, India. PARTICIPANTS: 452 IPs, 57 AYUSH practitioners and 38 doctors (including 23 government doctors) were interviewed from a census of 1138 primary care providers used by community members that could be reached by telephone. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Providers were interviewed using a structured questionnaire with choice-based answers to gather information on (1) change in patient care seeking, (2) source of COVID-19 information, (3) knowledge on COVID-19 spread, symptoms and methods for prevention and (4) clinical management of COVID-19. RESULTS: During the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, 72% of providers reported a decrease in patient visits. Most IPs and other private primary care providers reported receiving no COVID-19 related engagement with government or civil society agencies. For them, the principal source of COVID-19 information was television and newspapers. IPs had reasonably good knowledge of typical COVID-19 symptoms and prevention, and at levels similar to doctors. However, there was low stated compliance among IPs (16%) and qualified primary care providers (15% of MBBS doctors and 12% of AYUSH practitioners) with all WHO recommended management practices for suspect COVID-19 cases. Nearly half of IPs and other providers intended to treat COVID-19 suspects without referral. CONCLUSIONS: Poor management practices of COVID-19 suspects by rural primary care providers weakens government pandemic control efforts. Government action of providing information to IPs, as well as engaging them in contact tracing or public health messaging can strengthen pandemic control efforts.","Rao, Krishna D; Kaur, Japneet; Peters, Michael A; Kumar, Navneet; Nanda, Priya",BMJ Open,,33

The influence in standard energies, like crude oil, and renewable energies markets has been twofold: from one side, the predictability of volatility has strongly decreased;secondly, the linkages of the price time series have been modified. In this paper, by using DCC-GARCH and Price Leadership Share methodology, we can investigate the changes in the influences between standard energies and renewable energies markets by analyzing one-minute time series of West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures contract (WTI), the Brent crude oil futures contract (BRENT), the STOXX Europe 600 oil &amp;gas index (SXEV), and the European renewable energy index (ERIX). Our results confirm volatility spillover between the time series. However, when assessing the accuracy of the predictability of the DCC-GARCH model, the results show that the model fails its prediction in the period of higher instability. Besides, we found that price leadership has been strongly influenced by the virus spreading stages. These results have been obtained by dividing the period between September 2019 and January 2021 into 6 subperiods according to the pandemic stages.","De Blasis, Riccardo Petroni Filippo",Energies,,33

The COVID-19 main protease (Mpro) was selected for the development of the pharmacophore model. The model consisted of a hydrogen bond acceptor, donor, and hydrophobic features. These features demonstrated good corroboration with a previously reported model that was used to validate the present model, showing an RMSD value of 0.32. The virtual screening was carried out using the ZINC database. A set of 208,000 hits was extracted and filtered using the ligand pharmacophore mapping, applying the lead-like properties. Lipinski's filter and the fit value filter were used to minimize hits to the top 2000. Simultaneous docking was carried out for 200 hits for natural drugs belonging to the FDA-approved drug database. The top 28 hits from these experiments, with promising predicted pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties, are reported here. To optimize these hits as Mpro inhibitors and potential treatment options for COVID-19, bench work investigations are needed.","Saeed, Mohd; Saeed, Amir; Alam, Md Jahoor; Alreshidi, Mousa",Molecules (Basel),,33

The objective of this study is to test a machine-learning (ML) method based on radiomics features extracted from chest CT images for screening COVID-19 cases. METHODS: The study is carried out on two groups of patients, including 138 patients with confirmed and 140 patients with suspected COVID-19. We focus on distinguishing pneumonia caused by COVID-19 from the suspected cases by segmentation of whole lung volume and extraction of 86 radiomics features. Followed by feature extraction, nine feature-selection procedures are used to identify valuable features. Then, ten ML classifiers are applied to classify and predict COVID-19 cases. Each ML models is trained and tested using a ten-fold cross-validation method. The predictive performance of each ML model is evaluated using the area under the curve (AUC) and accuracy. RESULTS: The range of accuracy and AUC is from 0.32 (recursive feature elimination [RFE]+Multinomial Naive Bayes [MNB] classifier) to 0.984 (RFE+bagging [BAG], RFE+decision tree [DT] classifiers) and 0.27 (mutual information [MI]+MNB classifier) to 0.997 (RFE+k-nearest neighborhood [KNN] classifier), respectively. There is no direct correlation among the number of the selected features, accuracy, and AUC, however, with changes in the number of the selected features, the accuracy and AUC values will change. Feature selection procedure RFE+BAG classifier and RFE+DT classifier achieve the highest prediction accuracy (accuracy: 0.984), followed by MI+Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB) and logistic regression (LGR)+DT classifiers (accuracy: 0.976). RFE+KNN classifier as a feature selection procedure achieve the highest AUC (AUC: 0.997), followed by RFE+BAG classifier (AUC: 0.991) and RFE+gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) classifier (AUC: 0.99). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that the ML model based on RFE+KNN classifier achieves the highest performance to differentiate patients with a confirmed infection caused by COVID-19 from the suspected cases.","Masoud Rezaeijo, Seyed; Abedi-Firouzjah, Razzagh; Ghorvei, Mohammadreza; Sarnameh, Samad",,,33

In particular, we experiment with several models to identify (i) whether a tweet is traffic-related or not, and (ii) in the case that the tweet is traffic-related to identify more fine-grained information regarding the event (e.g., the type of the event, where the event happened). To do so, we frame (i) the problem of identifying whether a tweet is a traffic-related event or not as a text classification subtask, and (ii) the problem of identifying more fine-grained traffic-related information as a slot filling subtask, where fine-grained information (e.g., where an event has happened) is represented as a slot/entity of a particular type. We propose the use of several methods that process the two subtasks either separately or in a joint setting, and we evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed methods for solving the traffic event detection problem. Experimental results indicate that the proposed architectures achieve high performance scores (i.e., more than 95% in terms of F$_{1}$ score) on the constructed datasets for both of the subtasks (i.e., text classification and slot filling) even in a transfer learning scenario. In addition, by incorporating tweet-level information in each of the tokens comprising the tweet (for the BERT-based model) can lead to a performance improvement for the joint setting.","Yang, Xiangyu; Bekoulis, Giannis; Deligiannis, Nikos",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.06035v1.pdf,33

However, once infected there is a small but significant increased risk of mortality. Among the different treatments, NSAIDs are associated with higher rates of complications, but data for other drugs are conflicting or incomplete. The use of certain drugs for autoimmune inflammatory rheumatisms appears to be a potentially interesting options for the treatment. The rationale for their use is based on the immune system runaway and the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Il1, IL6, TNF&#945;) in severe forms of the disease.

On presentation, her physical examination was benign, except for sinus tachycardia, and she was oxygenating adequately on room air. Laboratory studies were unremarkable, except a PCR test positive for SARS-COV2, and a CT scan of her chest showed bilateral multi-focal ground-glass opacities. A fetal non-stress test was reassuring. She was treated with intravenous fluids, ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and hydroxychloroquine. During her hospital stay, she developed progressively worsening respiratory failure, initially requiring non-invasive ventilation, and subsequently progressed to acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring mechanical ventilation. She then suffered from sudden hypoxemia and hemodynamic collapse, on maximal ventilatory support, prompting an emergency cesarean section at bedside. This led to rapid stabilization of hemodynamic parameters, and of her overall respiratory status. Both the twins were born prematurely, and one of them tested positive for SARS-COV2.","Mehta, Harsh; Ivanovic, Sasa; Cronin, Amanda; VanBrunt, Lindsey; Mistry, Nirav; Miller, Richard; Yodice, Paul; Rezai, Fariborz",Case Rep Womens Health,,33

270649,Animal Models of COVID-19 II. Comparative Immunology,2021,"OBJECTIVES: This document presents the fundamentals of speech audiometry in noise, general requirements for implementation and criteria for choice among the tests available in French according to the health-professional's needs. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The recommendations are based on a systematic analysis of the literature carried out by a multidisciplinary group of doctors, audiologists and audioprosthetists from all over France. They are graded A, B, C or expert opinion according to decreasing level of scientific evidence. RESULTS: Eight tests of speech audiometry in noise can be used in France. CONCLUSION: To be complete, evaluation of hearing status requires testing understanding of speech in noise. The examination must begin with a minimum of two measurements familiarizing the subject with the test procedure. For initial diagnosis, adaptive procedures establishing the 50% speech reception threshold (SRT50) in noise are to be preferred in order to obtain a rapid and standardized measurement of perception of speech in noise. When the aim is to measure real-life speech comprehension, tests based on sentences, cocktail-party noise and free-field stimulation are to be preferred. Prosthetic gain is evaluated exclusively in free field. This is the only way to evaluate the contribution of binaurality and to measure perception in noise in an environment as close as possible to real life. In order to avoid acoustic interference in free field, at least five loudspeakers should be used, in particular for evaluating the effectiveness of directional microphones, CROS devices enabling sounds picked up in the damaged ear to be rerouted to the functional ear, or bimodal fitting (i.e., when hearing is enabled by two modalities: for example, hearing aid for one ear, cochlear implant for the other).","Joly, C-A; Reynard, P; Mezzi, K; Bakhos, D; Bergeron, F; Bonnard, D; Borel, S; Bouccara, D; Coez, A; Dejean, F; Del Rio, M; Leclercq, F; Henrion, P; Marx, M; Mom, T; Mosnier, I; Potier, M; Renard, C; Roy, T; Sterkers-Artières, F; Venail, F; Verheyden, P; Veuillet, E; Vincent, C; Thai-Van, H",Eur. ann. otorhinolaryngol. head neck dis,,33
270818,A novel apoA-I mimetic peptide suppresses atherosclerosis by promoting physiological HDL function in apoE-/- mice,2020,"In the last two decades, education scholarship has made significant progress in advancing the feminist social justice agenda with women scholars having been almost entirely the drivers of this movement. Women scholars in teacher education have been successful in establishing and consolidating this disciplinary field of study quite firmly in the teacher education curriculum. Despite this, many forms of oppression, including domestic or intimate partner violence and sex- and gender-based violence, continue to plague South African universities and society in general. The current COVID-19 pandemic's mandatory home confinement restrictions have further exacerbated the conditions for individuals likely to experience domestic violence. Men have been relatively silent and inactive in this social justice project. There is also limited extant scholarship that addresses the role that profeminist men might play in this social justice enterprise. There is also little work that attempts to understand the level of sophistication with which men understand feminism, determine with which feminisms men might align themselves, and the accountability and responsibility that might come with assuming certain positions. In this critical autoethnographic piece, I engage with the questions of how critical pedagogical encounters in a teacher education course might serve as disruptive devices that trouble stubbornly resistant gendered socialisations. I draw on my experiences as a teacher educator as I struggle to locate and identify my own profeminist positionality and the tensions this presents. I contemplate the poststructuralist caution about writing (my)self into a text given that the writing self is an evolving/changing self. I reflect on my attempt to disrupt obliviousness as I contemplate the prospect of self-disclosure as a point of entry for profeminist men's praxis in a teacher education programme subscribed to by young men (and women) deeply socialised in a patriarchal history and culture. © 2021 University of KwaZulu-Natal.

272926,Small Area Estimation for Disease Prevalence Mapping,2020,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak is evolving rapidly worldwide. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the risk of serious adverse outcomes in patients with COVID-19 by stratifying the comorbidity status. METHODS: We analysed data from 1590 laboratory confirmed hospitalised patients from 575 hospitals in 31 provinces/autonomous regions/provincial municipalities across mainland China between 11 December 2019 and 31 January 2020. We analysed the composite end-points, which consisted of admission to an intensive care unit, invasive ventilation or death. The risk of reaching the composite end-points was compared according to the presence and number of comorbidities. RESULTS: The mean age was 48.9â years and 686 (42.7%) patients were female. Severe cases accounted for 16.0% of the study population. 131 (8.2%) patients reached the composite end-points. 399 (25.1%) reported having at least one comorbidity. The most prevalent comorbidity was hypertension (16.9%), followed by diabetes (8.2%). 130 (8.2%) patients reported having two or more comorbidities. After adjusting for age and smoking status, COPD (HR (95% CI) 2.681 (1.424-5.048)), diabetes (1.59 (1.03-2.45)), hypertension (1.58 (1.07-2.32)) and malignancy (3.50 (1.60-7.64)) were risk factors of reaching the composite end-points. The hazard ratio (95% CI) was 1.79 (1.16-2.77) among patients with at least one comorbidity and 2.59 (1.61-4.17) among patients with two or more comorbidities. CONCLUSION: Among laboratory confirmed cases of COVID-19, patients with any comorbidity yielded poorer clinical outcomes than those without. A greater number of comorbidities also correlated with poorer clinical outcomes.","Guan, Wei-Jie; Liang, Wen-Hua; Zhao, Yi; Liang, Heng-Rui; Chen, Zi-Sheng; Li, Yi-Min; Liu, Xiao-Qing; Chen, Ru-Chong; Tang, Chun-Li; Wang, Tao; Ou, Chun-Quan; Li, Li; Chen, Ping-Yan; Sang, Ling; Wang, Wei; Li, Jian-Fu; Li, Cai-Chen; Ou, Li-Min; Cheng, Bo; Xiong, Shan; Ni, Zheng-Yi; Xiang, Jie; Hu, Yu; Liu, Lei; Shan, Hong; Lei, Chun-Liang; Peng, Yi-Xiang; Wei, Li; Liu, Yong; Hu, Ya-Hua; Peng, Peng; Wang, Jian-Ming; Liu, Ji-Yang; Chen, Zhong; Li, Gang; Zheng, Zhi-Jian; Qiu, Shao-Qin; Luo, Jie; Ye, Chang-Jiang; Zhu, Shao-Yong; Cheng, Lin-Ling; Ye, Feng; Li, Shi-Yue; Zheng, Jin-Ping; Zhang, Nuo-Fu; Zhong, Nan-Shan; He, Jian-Xing",Eur. respir. j,,33

275517,Alone We Can Do So Little;Together We Can Do So Much,2021,"Background and Purpose- Hyperacute assessment and management of patients with stroke, termed code stroke, is a time-sensitive and high-stakes clinical scenario. In the context of the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the ability to deliver timely and efficacious care must be balanced with the risk of infectious exposure to the clinical team. Furthermore, rapid and effective stroke care remains paramount to achieve maximal functional recovery for those needing admission and to triage care appropriately for those who may be presenting with neurological symptoms but have an alternative diagnosis. Methods- Available resources, COVID-19-specific infection prevention and control recommendations, and expert consensus were used to identify clinical screening criteria for patients and provide the required nuanced considerations for the healthcare team, thereby modifying the conventional code stroke processes to achieve a protected designation. Results- A protected code stroke algorithm was developed. Features specific to prenotification and clinical status of the patient were used to define precode screening. These include primary infectious symptoms, clinical, and examination features. A focused framework was then developed with regard to a protected code stroke. We outline the specifics of personal protective equipment use and considerations thereof including aspects of crisis resource management impacting team role designation and human performance factors during a protected code stroke. Conclusions- We introduce the concept of a protected code stroke during a pandemic, as in the case of COVID-19, and provide a framework for key considerations including screening, personal protective equipment, and crisis resource management. These considerations and suggested algorithms can be utilized and adapted for local practice.","Khosravani, Houman; Rajendram, Phavalan; Notario, Lowyl; Chapman, Martin G; Menon, Bijoy K",Stroke,,33

RECENT FINDINGS: This review focuses on patient-centered outcomes in the ICU, highlighting the latest research to promote brain health and psychological recovery during and after perioperative critical illness. Topics include sedation in the obese patient, delirium severity assessments, the role of the Psychiatry Consultation-Liaison in the ICU, Post-intensive care syndrome, and the importance of family engagement in the COVID era. SUMMARY: Highlighting new research, such as novel implementation strategies in addition to a lack of research in certain areas like sleep in the ICU may lead to innovation and establishment of evidence-based practices in critical care. Perioperative brain health is multifaceted, and an increase in multidisciplinary interventions may help improve outcomes and decrease morbidity in ICU survivors.","Ortiz, Damaris",Curr Opin Crit Care,,33

In this study, we compared the detection of SARS-CoV-2 by a one-step real-time RT-PCR method using a heat-resistant reverse transcriptase variant MM4 from Moloney murine leukemia virus, two thermostable DNA polymerase variants with reverse transcriptase activity from Thermotoga petrophila K4 and Thermococcus kodakarensis KOD1, or a wild-type DNA polymerase from Thermus thermophilus M1. The highest performance was achieved by combining MM4 with the thermostable DNA polymerase from T. thermophilus M1. These enzymes efficiently amplified specific RNA using uracil-DNA glycosylase (UNG) to remove contamination and human RNase P RNA amplification as an internal control. The standard curve was obtained from 5 to 105 copies of synthetic RNA. The one-step real-time RT-PCR method's sensitivity and specificity were 99.44% and 100%, respectively (n = 213), compared to those of a commercially available diagnostic kit.

An Extensive Review,2021,"BackgroundInformation concerning the longevity of immunity to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) following natural infection may have considerable implications for durability of immunity induced by vaccines. Here, we monitored the SARS-CoV-2 specific immune response in convalescent coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) patients up to 15 months after symptoms onset. MethodsThe levels of anti-spike and anti-receptor binding domain antibodies and neutralizing activities were tested in a total of 188 samples from 136 convalescent patients who experience mild to critical COVID-19. Specific memory B and T cell responses were measured in 76 peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples collected from 54 patients. Twenty-three vaccinated individuals were included for comparison. FindingsFollowing a peak at day 15-28 post-infection, the IgG antibody response and plasma neutralizing titers gradually decreased over time but stabilized after 6 months. Plasma neutralizing activity against G614 was still detected in 87% of the patients at 6-15 months. Compared to G614, the median neutralizing titers against Beta, Gamma and Delta variants in plasma collected at early (15-103 days) and late (9-15 month) convalescence were 16- and 8-fold lower, respectively. SARS-CoV-2-specific memory B and T cells reached a peak at 3-6 months and persisted in the majority of patients up to 15 months although a significant decrease in specific T cells was observed between 6 and 15 months. ConclusionThe data suggest that antiviral specific immunity especially memory B cells in COVID-19 convalescent patients is long-lasting, but some variants of concern, including the fast-spreading Delta variant, may at least partially escape the neutralizing activity of plasma antibodies.

282924,"JAMA Neurology-The Year in Review, 2020",2021,"We surveyed three well-established store-and-forward telemedicine networks to identify any changes during the first half of 2020, which might have been due to the effect of the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic on their telemedicine operations. The three networks all used the Collegium Telemedicus system. Various quantitative performance indicators, which included the numbers of referrals and the case-mix, were compared with their values in previous years. Two of the three networks surveyed (A and B) provided telemedicine services for any type of medical or surgical case, while the third (network C) handled only pediatric radiology cases. All networks operated in Africa, but networks A and C also provided services in other resource-constrained regions. Two of the networks (networks B and C) used local staff to submit referrals, while network A relied mainly on its expatriate staff. During the first half of 2020, the numbers of referrals received on network B increased substantially, while in contrast, the numbers of referrals on network A declined. All three networks had relatively stable referral rates during 2018 and 2019. All three networks delivered a service that was rated highly by the referrers. One network operated at relatively high efficiency compared to the other two, although it is not known if this is sustainable. The networks which were more reliant on local referrers saw little reduction—or even an increase—in submitted cases, while the network that had the most dependence on international staff saw a big fall in submitted cases. This was probably due to the effect of international travel restrictions on the deployment of its staff. We conclude that organizations wanting to build or expand their telemedicine services should consider deliberately empowering local providers as their referrers.

The release of national COVID-19 death data by racial/ethnic group now permits analysis of age-specific mortality rates for these groups and the non-Hispanic Asian or Pacific Islander (NHAPI) population. Our objectives were to examine variation in age-specific COVID-19 mortality rates by racial/ethnicity and to calculate the impact of this mortality using years of potential life lost (YPLL). METHODS AND FINDINGS: This cross-sectional study used the recently publicly available data on US COVID-19 deaths with reported race/ethnicity, for the time period February 1, 2020, to July 22, 2020. Population data were drawn from the US Census. As of July 22, 2020, the number of COVID-19 deaths equaled 68,377 for NHW, 29,476 for NHB, 23,256 for Hispanic, 1,143 for NHAIAN, and 6,468 for NHAPI populations; the corresponding population sizes were 186.4 million, 40.6 million, 2.6 million, 19.5 million, and 57.7 million. Age-standardized rate ratios relative to NHW were 3.6 (95% CI 3.5, 3.8; p < 0.001) for NHB, 2.8 (95% CI 2.7, 3.0; p < 0.001) for Hispanic, 2.2 (95% CI 1.8, 2.6; p < 0.001) for NHAIAN, and 1.6 (95% CI 1.4, 1.7; p < 0.001) for NHAP populations. By contrast, NHB rate ratios relative to NHW were 7.1 (95% CI 5.8, 8.7; p < 0.001) for persons aged 25-34 years, 9.0 (95% CI 7.9, 10.2; p < 0.001) for persons aged 35-44 years, and 7.4 (95% CI 6.9, 7.9; p < 0.001) for persons aged 45-54 years. Even at older ages, NHB rate ratios were between 2.0 and 5.7. Similarly, rate ratios for the Hispanic versus NHW population were 7.0 (95% CI 5.8, 8.7; p < 0.001), 8.8 (95% CI 7.8, 9.9; p < 0.001), and 7.0 (95% CI 6.6, 7.5; p < 0.001) for the corresponding age strata above, with remaining rate ratios ranging from 1.4 to 5.0. Rate ratios for NHAIAN were similarly high through age 74 years. Among NHAPI persons, rate ratios ranged from 2.0 to 2.8 for persons aged 25-74 years and were 1.6 and 1.2 for persons aged 75-84 and 85+ years, respectively. As a consequence, more YPLL before age 65 were experienced by the NHB and Hispanic populations than the NHW population-despite the fact that the NHW population is larger-with a ratio of 4.6:1 and 3.2:1, respectively, for NHB and Hispanic persons. Study limitations include likely lag time in receipt of completed death certificates received by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for transmission to NCHS, with consequent lag in capturing the total number of deaths compared to data reported on state dashboards. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we observed racial variation in age-specific mortality rates not fully captured with examination of age-standardized rates alone. These findings suggest the importance of examining age-specific mortality rates and underscores how age standardization can obscure extreme variations within age strata. To avoid overlooking such variation, data that permit age-specific analyses should be routinely publicly available.","Bassett, Mary T; Chen, Jarvis T; Krieger, Nancy",PLoS Med,,33

285280,Highlights From the Circulation Family of Journals,2021,"Most teledermatology studies focus on patients' satisfaction; fewer focus on the experiences of healthcare professionals. This qualitative study explored healthcare professionals' perceptions of teledermatology used for linking public primary care clinics with the specialist dermatology centre in Singapore. Semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted with 25 family physicians and dermatologists. Six themes were identified: satisfaction with the service; perceived patient benefits; rationale for introducing teledermatology; educational impact; challenges of virtual consultations; and desirable service refinements for the future. Family physicians and dermatologists were positive about the service, but highlighted a need to streamline referral processes and improve the quality of transmitted images. Reduced need for referral to the specialist centre could be achieved by expanding the polyclinic's pharmacopoeia and treatment modalities. This study highlights the benefits of telemedicine for patient, professionals, and healthcare organizations, and these are reassuring given the widespread and rapid introduction of telemedicine through necessity during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Chow, Aloysius; Teo, Sok Huang; Kong, Jing Wen; Lee, Simon Biing Ming; Heng, Yee Kiat; van Steensel, Maurice A M; Smith, Helen E",Acta derm. venereol,,33

287372,Effect of diagnostic testing on the isolation rate in a compartmental model with asymptomatic groups,2020-11-25,"INTRODUCTION: Evidence-based clinical data on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pharmacotherapies are scarce. OBJECTIVE: This study documented and characterized COVID-19 cases reported in individuals receiving treatment with Pfizer pharmaceutical products and cases that reported use of Pfizer pharmaceutical products for COVID-19 treatment. METHODS: This retrospective observational review leveraged the Pfizer safety database containing adverse event data collected in association with use of Pfizer products between 1 October, 2019, and 25 June, 2020; the database includes worldwide adverse event data from various sources. Selected Medical Dictionary for Drug Regulatory Activities (MedDRA®) Preferred Terms and subsequent clinical review were used to characterize COVID-19 cases. RESULTS: Over 1500 relevant cases were identified over an 8-month period. In cases that reported COVID-19, immunosuppressant/immunomodulating agents, followed by anticoagulant/antithrombic agents and corticosteroids, were the most frequently reported agents. The frequent reporting of immunosuppressant/immunomodulating agents among cases of COVID-19 suggests increased vulnerability to infection among treated patients, either because of immunosuppressive effects of certain agents or the nature of the underlying treated condition. In cases involving off-label pharmacotherapy use for the treatment of COVID-19-related conditions, the most frequently reported therapeutic classes included antibiotics, antimalarial agents, antivirals/antiretroviral agents, immunosuppressant/immunomodulating agents, corticosteroids, anticoagulants, and immunoglobulin/interferons. The most frequently reported pharmacotherapeutic agents were azithromycin and chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine, followed by lopinavir-ritonavir, ceftriaxone, and tofacitinib. The most frequently reported clinical adverse events associated with azithromycin (as sole therapy or combined with chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine) include electrocardiogram QT prolonged, drug interaction, hepatitis, diarrhea, and hepatitis acute. Regarding cardiac-related events, 19% (120/645) of azithromycin cases reported events associated with QT prolongation/torsade de pointes (which included seven fatal cardiac events). The most frequently reported clinical adverse events associated with other commonly used agents are also presented. CONCLUSIONS: This pharmacovigilance surveillance study provides a unique characterization of cases in which a broad range of pharmaceutical products was reported in relation to COVID-19.","Beyzarov, Elena; Chen, Yan; Julg, Rob; Naim, Karen; Shah, Jigna; Gregory, William W; Ayoub, Ayman; Caubel, Patrick",Drug Saf,,33

Method: A retrospective, single centre, observational cohort study of all patients undergoing surgery between 17 March 2020 and 3May 2020 was performed. Outcomes were stratified by British Orthopaedic Association COVID-19 Patient Risk Assessment Tool. Patients who were SARS-CoV-2 positive at the time of surgery were excluded. Results: Overall, 96 patients assessed as negative for SARS-CoV-2 at the time of surgery underwent 100 emergency or urgent orthopaedic procedures during the study period. Within 30 days of surgery 9.4% of patients (n = 9) were found to be SARS-CoV-2 positive by nasopharyngeal swab. The overall 30 day mortality rate across the whole cohort of patients during this period was 3% (n = 3). Of those testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 66% (n = 6) developed significant COVID-19 related complications and there was a 33% 30-day mortality rate (n = 3). Overall, the 30-day mortality in patients classified as BOA low or medium risk (n = 69) was 0%, whereas in those classified as high or very high risk (n = 27) it was 11.1%. Conclusion: Orthopaedic surgery in SARS-CoV-2 negative patients who transition to positive within 30 days of surgery carries a significant risk of morbidity and mortality. In lower risk groups, the overall risk of becoming SARS-CoV-2 positive, and subsequently developing a significant postoperative related complication, was low even during the peak of the pandemic. In addition to ensuring patients are SARS-CoV-2 negative at the time of surgery it is important that the risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 is minimized through their recovery.Cite this article: Bone Joint Open 2020;1-8:474-480.","Price, Andrew; Shearman, Alexander D; Hamilton, Thomas W; Alvand, Abtin; Kendrick, Ben",Bone Jt Open,,33
288407,Reply to Letter to the Editor Regarding;‘The Optimistic Pursuit of Plastic Surgery Training’,2021,"At Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center School of Medicine, our curriculum begins with rigorous and fast-paced basic science blocks followed by clinical clerkships. During the first semester of the first year, medical students take a combined Biochemistry, Cell Biology and Histology block (called BCT) after successfully finishing an anatomy block. Historically, the medical students have had difficulties in both assimilating the amount of content presented and in appreciating how the topics covered in BCT help them better understand the pathophysiology and treatment of diseases. Further, because the COVID-19 environment prompted a change from a categorical to a Pass/Fail grading system and shifted the delivery of didactic material from in-person to remote learning, retention of student engagement became a priority. It has been demonstrated by others that using clinical correlations to teach basic science concepts is an effective way to enhance student engagement and retention of basic science knowledge. The primary hypothesis for this study was that student engagement and interest in basic science knowledge would be enhanced by the incorporation of a clinically oriented, case-based exercise. A second hypothesis was that students would be able to apply information provided during lectures to successfully complete it. The BCT block is 8 weeks long and consists of 3 units primarily focused on medical biochemistry (unit 1), cell biology (unit 2) and histology (unit 3). The case study, focused on diabetes, was designed to run as a ?thread? through all of the units and build in complexity with each unit in order to better understand the pathophysiology of this disease. The case was revealed progressively in three units, each of which consisted of a portion of an hypothetical scenario and a matched, five-question quiz that was offered both at the beginning and the end of each unit. The correct answers were given to the students after completion of each post-quiz. To enhance student participation, 2% was added to their grade after successful completion of at least 3 quizzes. Comparison of the pre- and post-quiz data revealed that for units 1 and 3, students scored significantly higher on post-quizzes as compared to pre-quizzes (unit 1- 86% vs 48%, a 78% change, and unit 3- 66% vs 61%, an 8.9% change). For unit 2, there was a trend toward significance;however, the average post-quiz score (87% vs 83%, a 4.5% change) was not significantly different from the pre-quiz score (p=0.07). Students responded favorably to the exercise (as reported in an end-of-block survey), wherein it was ranked higher as a learning resource than any of the recommended textbooks or atlases. Collectively, these data reveal that addition of a case study effectively enhances students' learning of the didactic material as well as their ability to apply basic science knowledge to a clinical case-based scenario.","Kaur, Gurvinder Webster Dan",The FASEB Journal,,33
288995,"Dripping, jetting and tip streaming",2020,"Introduction While the COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV2 virus has challenged healthcare systems across the country, inpatient psychiatric hospitals struggle with a unique challenge Psychiatric patients participate in therapy groups and eat meals together on milieus It is difficult to enforce mask use or self-isolation practices in the setting of psychosis or mania Additionally, neuropsychiatric disorders such as new onset psychosis, delirium, and affective disorders have all been documented following a SARS-CoV2 infection A surveillance study from the UK found that primary psychiatric diagnoses were most common in younger patients and encephalopathy was more common in older adults following a SARS-CoV2 infection A multicenter cohort study looking specifically at older adults found that 226 (28%) of 817 geriatric patients with COVID-19 had delirium at ED presentation Delirium was the sixth most common of all presenting symptoms of COVID-19 Of patients with delirium, 16% had delirium as a primary presenting complaint and 37% had no fever or shortness of breath Our psychiatric hospital has a geriatric psychiatry service, which has generated further challenges during the pandemic The hospital requires COVID-19 testing prior to admission, but false negatives are possible We continue to adapt our procedures to best serve this vulnerable population as we learn more about COVID-19 and atypical presentations We provide a case report of a geriatric psychiatry patient who presented with delirium secondary to COVID-19 and the subsequent consideration in our admission process Methods A case report of a patient who was admitted to the geriatric psychiatry inpatient service and was found to have delirium as a presenting COVID-19 symptom A review of neuropsychiatric manifestations of COVID-19 will be presented Results Ms A is an 80-year-old woman with history of major depressive disorder, recent non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction, aortic stenosis, ischemic cardiomyopathy, and hypertension She was originally admitted to the inpatient psychiatry from the ED for suicidal ideation and worsening depression but was found to be inattentive and disoriented She had multiple falls in the several days leading up to admission, but no respiratory symptoms or fever The geriatric psychiatry service determined she was delirious and started medical work up for etiology Her rapid COVID-19 test at an outside facility was negative Her medical work up was remarkable for a leukocytosis of 11 ×109 per liter, and an acute kidney injury (AKI) with BUN 20 mg/dL and Creatinine 1 31 mg/dL increased acutely from baseline of 0 9 Urinalysis was negative for infection She was transferred to the emergency room for encephalopathy and declining oral intake There, she tested positive for COVID-19 by PCR and was admitted to medicine for delirium of likely multiple etiologies including COVID-19 Her EEG showed generalized slowing and her head CT was negative for hemorrhage or infarction The consult liaison psychiatry service continued to follow Mrs A during her three-week hospitalization, during which she required Olanzapine 2 5 mg as needed for agitation related to her hyperactive delirium Her AKI resolved with intravenous fluids and avoidance of nephrotoxic agents She was discharged into the care of family on psychiatric medications fluoxetine 40 mg and mirtazapine 45 mg after her delirium gradually resolved with supportive care including physical and occupational therapy Conclusions The diverse clinical presentation, often multifactorial etiology and the waxing and waning course of delirium makes it difficult to diagnose in an emergency room setting even for experienced physicians Delirium can present with depressive, cognitive, and psychotic symptoms It is not uncommon for delirious geriatric patients to be admitted to our inpatient unit for agitation, psychosis or depression, as was the case with Ms A Delirium can be a presenting symptom of COVID-19 Given this and our unique circumstances on a psychiatric milieu, we need to take greater consideration when assessing for delirium and other possible neuropsychiatric symptoms of SARS-CoV2 infection prior to admission Grossman et al developed a modified confusion assessment method for the emergency department (mCAM-ED) that requires 3 to 5 minutes to complete the whole instrument However, despite having this and other tools, formal assessment tools for delirium are rarely used in the ED It is important that geriatric patients are triaged to the appropriate level of care so proper medical treatment can be initiated without delay, as prolonged encephalopathy can lead to permanent decline in cognitive function, worse outcomes, and increased mortality This case reinforces the clinical importance of including delirium on checklists of presenting symptoms of COVID-19, specifically for geriatric patients, that guide standardized screening, evaluation, and treatment Funding The authors received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this

However, it does occur with common mild to severe ailments afflicting the world population. Several allopathic medicines are available to attenuate fever by targeting the pathogen or the symptom itself. However, many people in marginal civilizations are obligated to use locally grown medicinal plants due to limited access to common pharmaceuticals. The Karen ethnic group is the biggest ethnic minority group in the hill-tribes of Thailand. They utilise a vast repertoire of medicinal plant species. Since many modern drugs were discovered out of traditional therapies, it is possible to discover new allopathic drugs in the treatment of fever and associated pathogens from the Karen people. Thus, this study aims to identify and record the ethnomedicinal plants they used for the treatment of “fever”. The names of plants used by the Thai Karen people for the treatment of fever were mined from publications on ethnomedicinal uses. Useful plant species and families were identified using the Cultural Importance Index (CI). With the mined data, 125 plant species from 52 families were identified, distributed across 25 Karen villages. A chemical cross-examination of these species provided valuable insights into chemical classes worthy of further investigation in the context of fever and associated pathogens.","Phumthum, Methee; Sadgrove, Nicholas J.",Antibiotics,,33

We tested the hypothesis that sociodemographic, access to health care, and presentation to care characteristics among individuals with diabetes in Mexico confer an additional risk of hospitalization with COVID-19. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study using public data from the General Directorate of Epidemiology of the Mexican Ministry of Health. We included individuals with laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 between 1 March and 31 July 2020. The primary outcome was the predicted probability of hospitalization, inclusive of 8.5% of patients who required intensive care unit admission. RESULTS: Among 373,963 adults with COVID-19, 16.1% (95% CI 16.0-16.3) self-reported diabetes. The predicted probability of hospitalization was 38.4% (37.6-39.2) for patients with diabetes only and 42.9% (42.2-43.7) for patients with diabetes and one or more comorbidities (obesity, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease). High municipality-level of social deprivation and low state-level health care resources were associated with a 9.5% (6.3-12.7) and 17.5% (14.5-20.4) increased probability of hospitalization among patients with diabetes, respectively. In age-, sex-, and comorbidity-adjusted models, living in a context of high social vulnerability and low health care resources was associated with the highest predicted probability of hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: Social vulnerability contributes considerably to the probability of hospitalization among individuals with COVID-19 and diabetes with associated comorbidities. These findings can inform mitigation strategies for populations at the highest risk of severe COVID-19.","Sosa-Rubí, Sandra G; Seiglie, Jacqueline A; Chivardi, Carlos; Manne-Goehler, Jennifer; Meigs, James B; Wexler, Deborah J; Wirtz, Veronika J; Gómez-Dantés, Octavio; Serván-Mori, Edson",Diabetes care,,33
293274,Letter to the Editor,2021,"PURPOSE: It was the primary purpose of the present systematic review to identify the optimal protection measures during COVID-19 pandemic and provide guidance of protective measures for orthopedic surgeons. The secondary purpose was to report the protection experience of an orthopedic trauma center in Wuhan, China during the pandemic. METHODS: A systematic search of the PubMed, Cochrane, Web of Science, Google Scholar was performed for studies about COVID-19, fracture, trauma, orthopedic, healthcare workers, protection, telemedicine. The appropriate protective measures for orthopedic surgeons and patients were reviewed (on-site first aid, emergency room, operating room, isolation wards, general ward, etc.) during the entire diagnosis and treatment process of traumatic patients. RESULTS: Eighteen studies were included, and most studies (13/18) emphasized that orthopedic surgeons should pay attention to prevent cross-infection. Only four studies have reported in detail how orthopedic surgeons should be protected during surgery in the operating room. No detailed studies on multidisciplinary cooperation, strict protection, protection training, indications of emergency surgery, first aid on-site and protection in orthopedic wards were found. CONCLUSION: Strict protection at every step in the patient pathway is important to reduce the risk of cross-infection. Lessons learnt from our experience provide some recommendations of protective measures during the entire diagnosis and treatment process of traumatic patients and help others to manage orthopedic patients with COVID-19, to reduce the risk of cross-infection between patients and to protect healthcare workers during work.

295873,Surgical management of thymic epithelial tumors,2020,"SIGNIFICANCE: This analysis and review demonstrate that, although emerging data indicate that the prevalence of severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on the ocular surface and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) conjunctivitis is rare, the ocular surface remains of interest as a potential inoculation and transmission site for SARS-CoV-2. Continued safety precautions should be taken as more data become available.COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, is a novel, global pandemic that has infected millions and, up to this point, caused more than two million fatalities worldwide. The ocular surface has become of interest as a possible vector for transmission by acting as a direct inoculation site, being a conduit for the virus into the respiratory system or as a method of transmission from potentially infected conjunctiva or tears. The components necessary for SARS-CoV-2 to theoretically infect ocular tissues are present: binding receptors (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and cluster of differentiation 147) and mechanisms for cell entry (transmembrane protease serine 2 and cathepsin L). This meta-analysis of COVID-19 prevalence data indicates that SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been infrequently found in conjunctival samples when tested with reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. This review estimates the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 on the ocular surface and prevalence of conjunctivitis in patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. There is much to be learned regarding ocular tropism of SARS-CoV-2.","Sopp, Nicole M; Sharda, Vandhana",Optom Vis Sci,,33

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The first COVID-19 case was diagnosed in Turkey on 11 March, 2020, and the peak phase seemed to end by the end of April. All the patients whom were referred, treated, or previously operated but still at the hospital during the peak phase of COVID-19 pandemics in the country were included into this retrospective study. Patient's diagnosis, interventions, adverse events, and early post-procedural courses were studied. RESULTS: Thirty-one patients with various diagnoses of congenital cardiovascular disorders were retrospectively reviewed. Ages of the patients ranged between 2 days and 16 years. Seventeen cases were males and 14 cases were females. Elective cases were postponed. Priority was given to interventional procedures, and five cases were treated percutaneously. Palliative procedures were preferred in patients whom presumably would require long hospital stay. Corrective procedures were not hesitated in prioritised stable patients. Mortality occurred in one patient. Eight patients out of 151 ICU admissions were diagnosed with COVID-19, and they were transferred to COVID-19 ICU immediately. Three nurses whom also took care of the paediatric cases became infected with SARS-CoV-2; however, the children did not catch the disease. CONCLUSION: Mandatory and emergent congenital cardiac percutaneous and surgical procedures may be performed with similar postoperative risks as there are no pandemics with meticulous care and preventive measures.","Ugurlucan, Murat; Yildiz, Yahya; Oztas, Didem Melis; Coban, Senay; Beyaz, Metin Onur; Sari, Gizem; Ulukan, Mustafa Ozer; Karakaya, Atalay; Vatansever, Binay; Erkanli, Korhan; Meric, Mert; Unal, Orcun; Demirkol, Demet; Yozgat, Yilmaz; Saritas, Turkay; Erdem, Abdullah; Akdeniz, Celal; Turkoglu, Halil",Cardiol Young,,33

Specific information about critically ill COVID-19 patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) is rare.To describe the clinical course and complications of critically ill patients with COVID-19 who received IMV and were successfully weaned from it.This retrospective study included patients admitted to 3 intensive care units (ICUs) and 1 sub-ICU of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University and Wuhan Jin Yin-tan Hospital between December 24, 2019, and March 12, 2020. Eleven patients who had been diagnosed with critically ill COVID-19 according to the World Health Organization interim guidance, received invasive ventilation, and were finally successfully weaned from it, were enrolled in our study. Their presenting symptoms, comorbidity conditions, laboratory values, ICU course, ventilator parameters, treatments, and relative complications were recorded.Of 108 critically ill COVID-19 patients who received invasive ventilation, 11 patients who underwent tracheal extubation or terminal weaning were included. The mean age of the 11 patients was 52.8âyears (range, 38-70âyears), 8 (72.7%) were male, and 2 were health care workers. The median time from onset of symptoms to dyspnea was 6.6âdays (range, 3-13âdays), and the median duration of IMV was 15.7âdays (range, 6-29âdays). All 11 patients presented with acute severe hypoxemic respiratory failure and received IMV, and 1 patient switched to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation assistance. A lung-protective strategy with lower tidal volume ventilation and proper driving pressure is the main strategy of IMV. All patients had extrapulmonary manifestations, including acute kidney injury, hepatic dysfunction, myocardial damage, and/or lymphopenia. Hospital-acquired infections occurred in 7 (63.6%) patients.Critical COVID-19 illness is characterized by acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and subsequent dysfunction of other organs with a high mortality rate. Correct ventilation strategies and other clinical strategies to improve oxygenation based on the skilled trained group and the availability of equipment are the key methods to rescue lives.","Liu, Yulan; Xie, Wenjie; Meng, Yang; Sun, Lifang; Yan, Juanjuan; Dong, Weiguo; Zhou, Chenliang; Yu, Zhui",Medicine (Baltimore),,33

We aimed to identify potential early prognostic protein markers and to expand understanding of proteome dynamics during clinical progression of the disease. We performed in-depth proteome profiling on 137 sera, longitudinally collected from 25 patients with COVID-19 (non-severe patients, n = 13; patients who progressed to severe COVID-19, n = 12). We identified 11 potential biomarkers, including the novel markers IGLV3-19 and BNC2, as early potential prognostic indicators of severe COVID-19. These potential biomarkers are mainly involved in biological processes associated with humoral immune response, interferon signalling, acute phase response, lipid metabolism, and platelet degranulation. We further revealed that the longitudinal changes of 40 proteins persistently increased or decreased as the disease progressed to severe COVID-19. These 40 potential biomarkers could effectively reflect the clinical progression of the disease. Our findings provide some new insights into host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, which are valuable for understanding of COVID-19 disease progression. This study also identified potential biomarkers that could be further validated, which may support better predicting and monitoring progression to severe COVID-19.","Lee, Jee-Soo; Han, Dohyun; Kim, So Yeon; Hong, Ki Ho; Jang, Myoung-Jin; Kim, Man Jin; Kim, Young-Gon; Park, Jae Hyeon; Cho, Sung Im; Park, Wan Beom; Lee, Kyung Bok; Shin, Ho Seob; Oh, Hyeon Sae; Kim, Taek Soo; Park, Sung Sup; Seong, Moon-Woo",Proteomics,,33

The deep-learning system was developed using a heterogeneous multicentre dataset of 145,202 images, and tested retrospectively and prospectively with thousands of additional images across four patient cohorts and multiple countries. The system generalized across settings, discriminating between viral pneumonia, other types of pneumonia and the absence of disease with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) of 0.94-0.98; between severe and non-severe COVID-19 with an AUC of 0.87; and between COVID-19 pneumonia and other viral or non-viral pneumonia with AUCs of 0.87-0.97. In an independent set of 440 chest X-rays, the system performed comparably to senior radiologists and improved the performance of junior radiologists. Automated deep-learning systems for the assessment of pneumonia could facilitate early intervention and provide support for clinical decision-making.","Wang, Guangyu; Liu, Xiaohong; Shen, Jun; Wang, Chengdi; Li, Zhihuan; Ye, Linsen; Wu, Xingwang; Chen, Ting; Wang, Kai; Zhang, Xuan; Zhou, Zhongguo; Yang, Jian; Sang, Ye; Deng, Ruiyun; Liang, Wenhua; Yu, Tao; Gao, Ming; Wang, Jin; Yang, Zehong; Cai, Huimin; Lu, Guangming; Zhang, Lingyan; Yang, Lei; Xu, Wenqin; Wang, Winston; Olvera, Andrea; Ziyar, Ian; Zhang, Charlotte; Li, Oulan; Liao, Weihua; Liu, Jun; Chen, Wen; Chen, Wei; Shi, Jichan; Zheng, Lianghong; Zhang, Longjiang; Yan, Zhihan; Zou, Xiaoguang; Lin, Guiping; Cao, Guiqun; Lau, Laurance L; Mo, Long; Liang, Yong; Roberts, Michael; Sala, Evis; Schönlieb, Carola-Bibiane; Fok, Manson; Lau, Johnson Yiu-Nam; Xu, Tao; He, Jianxing",Nat Biomed Eng,,33

This review focuses on what the new literature has provided in terms of more general information about the management of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). RECENT FINDINGS: Measures taken to reduce the spread of COVID-19 have caused a significant drop in influenza worldwide. Improvements in imaging, especially ultrasound, and especially in the application of rapid molecular diagnosis are likely to have significant impact on the management of CAP. Therapeutic advances are so far limited. SUMMARY: COVID-19 has taught us that we can do far more to prevent seasonal influenza and its associated mortality, morbidity and economic cost. Improvements in imaging and pathogen diagnosis are welcome, as is the potential for secondary benefits of anti-COVID-19 therapies that may have reach effect on respiratory viruses other than severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. As community-transmission is likely to persist for many years, recognition and treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 will need to be incorporated into CAP guidelines moving forward.","Waterer, Grant W",Curr. opin. infect. dis,,33

Alguns cães infectados por L. infantum podem desenvolver uma forte resposta imune celular contra o invasor e eliminar a infecção, enquanto outros podem responder com uma produção exagerada de anticorpos contra o parasita e desenvolver a doença, que pode ser fatal se não tratada. Os fatores que desencadeiam a polarização inicial da resposta imune, bem como marcadores de resistência e susceptibilidade à infecção por L. infantum e o desenvolvimento da doença em cães, não estão totalmente compreendidos.

In view to expedite new drug leads for COVID-19, Main Proteases (Mpro) of novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has emerged as a crucial target for this virus. Nitric oxide (NO) inhibits the replication cycle of SARS-CoV. Inhalation of nitric oxide is used in the treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome. Herein, we evaluated the phenyl furoxan, a well-known exogenous NO donor to identify the possible potent inhibitors through in silico studies such as molecular docking as per target analysis for candidates bound to substrate binding pocket of SARS-COV-2 Mpro. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of most stable docked complexes (Mpro-22 and Mpro-26) helped to confirm the notable conformational stability of these docked complexes under dynamic state. Furthermore, Molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM-PBSA) calculations revealed energetic contributions of key residues of Mpro in binding with potent furoxan derivatives 22, 26. In the present study to validate the molecular docking, MD simulation and MM-PBSA results, crystal structure of Mpro bound to experimentally known inhibitor X77 was used as control and the obtained results are presented herein. We envisaged that spiro-isoquinolino-piperidine-furoxan moieties can be used as effective ligand for SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibition due to the presence of key isoquinolino-piperidine skeleton with additional NO effect.

304678,Aging Science Talks: The role of miR-181a in age-related loss of muscle mass and function,2020,"IMPORTANCE: The novel coronavirus 2019 (SARS-CoV-2) has been well described in adults. Further, the impact on older children and during the perinatal time is becoming better studied. As community spread increases, it is important to recognize that neonates are vulnerable to community spread as well. The impact that community-acquired SARS-CoV-2 has in the neonatal time period is unclear, as this population has unique immunity considerations. OBJECTIVE: To report on a case series of SARS-CoV-2 in neonates through community acquisition in the USA. DESIGN: This is an early retrospective study of patients admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) identified as having SAR-CoV-2 through positive real-time polymerase chain reaction assay of nasopharyngeal swabs. FINDINGS: Three patients who required admission to the NICU between the ages of 17 and 33 days old were identified. All 3 had ill contacts in the home or had been to the pediatrician and presented with mild to moderate symptoms including fever, rhinorrhea, and hypoxia, requiring supplemental oxygen during their hospital stay. One patient was admitted with neutropenia, and the other 2 patients became neutropenic during hospitalization. None of the patients had meningitis or multiorgan failure. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Infants with community-acquired SARS-CoV-2 may require hospitalization due to rule-out sepsis guidelines if found to have fever and/or hypoxia. Caregivers of neonates should exercise recommended guidelines before contact with neonates to limit community spread of SARS-CoV-2 to this potentially vulnerable population, including isolation, particularly as asymptomatic cases become prevalent.","White, Alicia; Mukherjee, Priya; Stremming, Jane; Sherlock, Laura G; Reynolds, Regina M; Smith, Danielle; Asturias, Edwin J; Grover, Theresa R; Dietz, Robert M",Neonatology,,33

We analyzed the determinants of discrimination against recovered COVID-19 patients and suggest policy recommendations to reduce such discrimination.Methods: Twenty-seven Chinese cities were selected randomly based on their geographical location and GDP rank. One hundred adults were interviewed in each city with an equal number of men and women and three urban residents for every two rural residents. A multiple ordered logistic regression model was used to assess the associations between potential determinants and the COVID-19 discrimination level.Results: Of 2377 participants, 79.76% displayed discrimination toward recovered COVID-19 patients. The female discrimination level was 1.25 times that of males; the discrimination level increased with age; and was occupation-specific, with physicians' (OR = 0.352) and students' (OR = 0.553) discrimination level lower than that of farmers. The discrimination level of participants from the central regions was 1.828 times, and the eastern region 1.504 times, that of participants from western region. The participants' discrimination level was lower when they scored higher in transmission knowledge, prevention knowledge and other COVID-19 knowledge, treatment methods and quarantine time.Conclusion: Sex, age, occupation, infections of relatives and friends, regions and scores on COVID-19 knowledge were determinants of discrimination level against recovered COVID-19 patients. In contrast with qualitative studies, our quantitative study recommends targeted education campaigns, focusing on physicians, women, older people and certain occupations. Only the COVID-19 vaccination program for the whole population will resolve the COVID-19 discrimination problem.","Liu, Rugang; Nicholas, Stephen; Leng, Anli; Qian, Dongfu; Maitland, Elizabeth; Wang, Jian",Hum Vaccin Immunother,,33

313252,Author commentary on Arthur Belle et al,2020,"PURPOSE: To describe the immediate consequences of SARS-CoV-2 and the COVID-19 pandemic on the ocular surface and eye-care professionals, and to discuss the need for a mandatory switch from currently performed tele-screening to true teleconsultation for remote ocular surface assessment. MAIN FINDINGS: Ophthalmologists have been largely impacted by the COVID-19 sanitary crisis, due to both the ocular manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 and to the high contagiousness of the virus. The proximity of ophthalmologists to their patients have pushed eye-care providers to readapt their practices and develop alternatives to face-to-face consultations. However, teleconsultation has some major limitations and drawbacks, especially for ocular surface assessment that relies on high-quality graphic data for adequate diagnosis. Tele-screening, on the other hand, emphasizes on the importance of history-taking and listening to the patient in order to adequately prioritize appointments based on the presumed degree of emergency. CONCLUSION: Despite all the enthusiasm, tele-screening as currently performed with the available tools is still not capable of completely replacing a standard ophthalmic examination for the assessment of ocular surface diseases. While waiting for new emerging technologies and future implementation of imaging modalities and artificial intelligence, decision making algorithms can help eye-practitioners remotely screen their patients to assess the optimal time for follow-up appointments.","Labetoulle, Marc; Sahyoun, Marwan; Rousseau, Antoine; Baudouin, Christophe",Eur J Ophthalmol,,33

Given that poorer families have a larger number of children than other families, the analysis first establishes the proportion of children living in monetary poor households, as defined by national standards, across developing countries.

Early identification of this novel coronavirus by molecular tools is critical for surveillance and control of the epidemic outbreak. We aimed to establish a simple method for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in differentiating with SARS-CoV. Primers of our in-house reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays were designed to target conserved regions of the RdRP gene and E gene, selected restriction enzymes EcoRI, Tsp45I, and AluI to distinguish between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. In this report, a 396-bp fragment of the RdRp gene and 345-bp fragment of the E gene were amplified by one-step RT-PCR. Enzyme Tsp45I cuts the RdRP-amplified product of SARS-CoV-2 generating three fragments of 45, 154, and 197 bp, but it did not cut the amplicon of SARS-CoV. In contrast, the amplified product of SARS-CoV was digested with EcoRI producing two fragments of 76 and 320 bp, whereas the amplicon of SARS-CoV-2 was undigested by Tsp45I help to distinguish clearly SARS-CoV-2 from SARS-CoV on gel electrophoresis. In addition, AluI cut the amplicon of the E gene of SARS-CoV-2 generating two fragments of 248 and 97 bp without cutting to SARS-CoV. The accuracy of the assay was confirmed by sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. When evaluated on clinical samples showed a high sensitivity of 95%, specificity of our assay was 100% and clinical performance for detection of SARS-CoV-2 in comparison with other reference assays. In conclusion, in the present study, we successfully developed a simple method for molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 in differentiating with SARS-CoV.","Son, Ho Anh; Hang, Dinh Thi Thu; Thuan, Nghiem Duc; Quyen, Le Thi Bao; Thuong, Luong Thi Hoai; Nga, Vu Thi; Quang, Le Bach; Hung, Trinh Thanh; Son, Nguyen Thai; Linh, Nguyen Tung; Nam, Le Van; Van Ba, Nguyen; Tien, Tran Viet; Quyet, Do; Van Luong, Hoang; Su, Hoang Xuan",J. med. virol,,33

We therefore explored the prognostic factors for patients with COVID-19 and the contribution of immunomodulatory therapy on COVID-19 outcome. Methods: From 1 Feb to 16 March 2020, consecutive cases with COVID-19 were analyzed in the West Campus of Wuhan Union Hospital, a tertiary care center that is designated to care for patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China. The observation was based on follow-up until in-hospital death or discharge. Logistic regressions were performed for prognostic factors associated with in-hospital death. Furthermore, a propensity score-matched analysis was done using a multivariable logistic regression model to analyze the contributions of multiple treatments on COVID-19 death. Results: Three hundred and seventeen patients with COVID-19 were enrolled, of whom 269 were discharged and 48 died in hospital. After propensity score-matching based on age, gender, symptoms and comorbidities, multivariable logistic regression was performed with the adjustment of other variables that were significant risk factors in the univariate regression. Treatments with glucocorticoids, immunoglobulin, thymosin, and ammonium glycyrrhizinate were significantly associated with a higher rate of COVID-19 death. Conclusions: For in-hospital patients with COVID-19 of all severity levels, high risk for fatal outcome was observed in those treated with glucocorticoids, immunoglobulin, thymosin, and ammonium glycyrrhizinate. The results of this study do not support immunomodulatory therapy in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19. Further prospective studies are essential to clarify our findings, especially for non-critically ill patients.","Wang, Yu; Yan, Xin; Huang, Chenglong; Sun, Yan; Yao, Chunlin; Lin, Yun; Xiao, Weimin",Curr Med Res Opin,,33

Spain was one of the countries with the strictest conditions, as outdoor physical activity was banned for nearly two months. This study aimed to analyse the changes in physical activity and sedentary behaviours in Spanish university students before and during the confinement by COVID-19 with special focus on gender. We also analysed enjoyment, the tools used and motivation and impediments for doing physical activity. An online questionnaire, which included the International Physical Activity Questionnaire Short Form and certain ""ad hoc"" questions, was designed. Students were recruited by distributing an invitation through the administrative channels of 16 universities and a total of 13,754 valid surveys were collected. Overall, university students reduced moderate (-29.5%) and vigorous (-18.3%) physical activity during the confinement and increased sedentary time (+52.7%). However, they spent more time on high intensity interval training (HIIT) (+18.2%) and mind-body activities (e.g., yoga) (+80.0%). Adaptation to the confinement, in terms of physical activity, was handled better by women than by men. These results will help design strategies for each gender to promote physical activity and reduce sedentary behaviour during confinement periods.","Rodríguez-Larrad, Ana; Mañas, Asier; Labayen, Idoia; González-Gross, Marcela; Espin, Ander; Aznar, Susana; Serrano-Sánchez, José Antonio; Vera-Garcia, Francisco J; González-Lamuño, Domingo; Ara, Ignacio; Carrasco-Páez, Luis; Castro-Piñero, José; Gómez-Cabrera, Mari Carmen; Márquez, Sara; Tur, Josep A; Gusi, Narcis; Benito, Pedro J; Moliner-Urdiales, Diego; Ruiz, Jonatan R; Ortega, Francisco B; Jiménez-Pavón, David; Casajús, José Antonio; Irazusta, Jon",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,33

Models of the conditional odds function are employed to understand the various random forest flavours. Existing random forest variants for ordinal outcomes, such as Ordinal Forests and Conditional Inference Forests, are evaluated in the presence of a non-proportional odds impact of prognostic variables. We propose two novel random forest variants in the model-based transformation forest family, only one of which explicitly assumes proportional odds. These two novel transformation forests differ in the specification of the split procedures for the underlying ordinal trees. One of these split criteria is able to detect changes in non-proportional odds situations and the other one focuses on finding proportional-odds signals. We empirically evaluate the performance of the existing and proposed methods using a simulation study and illustrate the practical aspects of the procedures by a re-analysis of the respiratory sub-item in functional rating scales of patients suffering from Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS).","Buri, Muriel; Hothorn, Torsten",International journal of biostatistics,,33
318864,Antiviral Medicinal Plants of Veterinary Importance: A Literature Review,2020,"Relevant pandemic-spread scenario simulations can provide guiding principles for containment and mitigation policies. We devised a compartmental model to predict the effectiveness of different mitigation strategies with a main focus on mass testing. The model consists of a set of simple differential equations considering the population size, reported and unreported infections, reported and unreported recoveries, and the number of COVID-19-inflicted deaths. We assumed that COVID-19 survivors are immune (e.g., mutations are not considered) and that the virus is primarily passed on by asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic individuals. Moreover, the current version of the model does not account for age-dependent differences in the death rates, but considers higher mortality rates due to temporary shortage of intensive care units. The model parameters have been chosen in a plausible range based on information found in the literature, but it is easily adaptable, i.e., these values can be replaced by updated information any time. We compared infection rates, the total number of people getting infected and the number of deaths in different scenarios. Social distancing or mass testing can contain or drastically reduce the infections and the predicted number of deaths when compared with a situation without mitigation. We found that mass testing alone and subsequent isolation of detected cases can be an effective mitigation strategy, alone and in combination with social distancing. It is of high practical relevance that a relationship between testing frequency and the effective reproduction number of the virus can be provided. However, unless one assumes that the virus can be globally defeated by reducing the number of infected persons to zero, testing must be upheld, albeit at reduced intensity, to prevent subsequent waves of infection. The model suggests that testing strategies can be equally effective as social distancing, though at much lower economic costs. We discuss how our mathematical model may help to devise an optimal mix of mitigation strategies against the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, we quantify the theoretical limit of contact tracing and by how much the effect of testing is enhanced, if applied to sub-populations with increased exposure risk or prevalence.","Gorji, Hossein; Arnoldini, Markus; Jenny, David; Hardt, Wolf-Dietrich; Jenny, Patrick",Swiss Med Wkly,,33

323567,Many small steps towards a COVID-19 drug,2020,"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus discovered in December 2019 and is currently the cause of the global COVID-19 pandemic. A critical aspect of fighting this pandemic is to obtain accurate and timely test results so that patients who have tested positive for COVID-19 can be identified and isolated to reduce the spread of the virus. Research has shown that saliva is a promising candidate for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics because its collection is minimally invasive and can be reliably self-administered. However, little research has been conducted on saliva testing and SARS-CoV-2 self-sampling (SARS-CoV-2SS) in Sub-Saharan Africa. OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this study is to comparatively evaluate the clinical sensitivity and specificity of nasal and oral samples self-collected by individuals for SARS-CoV-2 testing against a reference method involving sample collection and testing by a health care professional. The secondary objectives of this study are to evaluate the usability of nasal self-sampling and saliva self-sampling as a sample collection method for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing by using failure mode and error assessment. METHODS: Participants will be recruited from the general population by using various methods, Participants will be screened progressively as they present at the clinical trial sites as well as in primary health care catchment areas in the inner city of Johannesburg, South Africa. In the event that recruitment numbers are low, we will use a mobile van to recruit participants from outlying areas of Johannesburg. We aim to enroll 250 participants into this study in approximately 6 weeks. Two sample types-a self-administered nasal swab and a self-administered saliva sample-will be collected from each participant, and a health care professional will collect a third sample by using a nasopharyngeal swab (ie, the standard reference method). RESULTS: This protocol has been approved by the University of the Witwatersrand Human Research Ethics Committee on July 31, 2020 (Protocol number EzCov003). As of May 13, 2021, 120 participants have been enrolled into the study. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2SS may offer many benefits to individuals, by allowing for initial self-identification of symptoms and collection of samples without involving third parties and potential risk of infection provided the sample can be safely processed via a collection system. The results of this study will provide preliminary data on the acceptability, feasibility, and usability of SARS-CoV-2SS among the general population for its future implementation.

AIMS: We aimed to identify the causes of anxiety in HCPs during the COVID-19 pandemic, to assess whether HCPs felt they had adequate mental health and wellbeing support and to identify their unmet support needs. METHOD: We used a web-based survey utilising an online tool circulated to UK HCPs over 5 weeks. Self-perceived anxiety levels prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic were measured on a 10-point Likert-type rating scale. RESULTS: The survey was completed by 558 HCPs. During the pandemic, self-perceived anxiety scores significantly increased from a median of 2 to 7 (paired Wilcoxon signed-rank test; p<0.001). The main reasons were concerns about exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and lack of personal protective equipment. Other wide-ranging reasons were identified. Only 41% of respondents felt there was adequate support. Thematic analysis of what support HCPs wanted identified 13 wide-ranging themes; including effective leadership and peer support. CONCLUSION: Anxiety levels in HCPs significantly increased during the COVID-19 pandemic and the main causes were identified. Many HCPs felt there was inadequate support and identified what support they needed.

METHODS: This was a prospective, controlled study conducted on patients with COVID-19 who were hospitalised. In this study, 55 patients were included. The patients were divided into two groups as the ozone and control group. Ozone therapy (major autohemotherapy) was applied to 37 patients who were being treated with the appropriate COVID-19 treatment protocol determined by the infectious diseases committee of our hospital. The ozone treatment protocol consisted of seven sessions (one session per day) of intravenous ozone administration, applied in a volume of 100 mL and a concentration of 30 µg/mL. Only the conventional COVID-19 treatment protocol was applied to 18 patients in the control group. Clinical follow-up was performed until the discharge of the patients from the hospital with successful treatment or until the mortality occurred. Factors affecting mortality were analysed using univariate regression analysis. RESULTS: Intensive care unit (ICU) hospitalisation was required in 6 of the 37 patients who were treated with ozone (16.2%), while 4 of 18 patients in the control group required ICU treatment (22.2%) (P = .713). When the mortality rates between the two groups were compared, mortality was lower in the ozone group (P = .032). As a result of univariate logistic regression analysis performed to investigate the factors affecting mortality, treatment with ozone therapy was determined as a risk factor for mortality. Patients receiving ozone therapy appear to have a lower mortality risk (odds ratio [OR]: 0.149, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.026-0.863, P = .034). CONCLUSION: In this study, the findings suggested that the administration of ozone therapy along with the conventional medical treatment in patients hospitalised for COVID-19 could reduce mortality.","Çolak, Sahin; Genç Yavuz, Burcu; Yavuz, Mürsel; Özçelik, Burak; Öner, Metin; Özgültekin, Asu; Senbayrak, Seniha",Int J Clin Pract,,33
328695,Erratum,2020,"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus. It is similar to influenza viruses and raises concerns through alarming levels of spread and severity resulting in an ongoing pandemic world-wide. Within five months (by May 2020), it infected 5.89 million persons world-wide and over 357 thousand have died. Drones or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are very helpful in handling the COVID-19 pandemic. This work investigates the drone-based systems, COVID-19 pandemic situations, and proposes architecture for handling pandemic situations in different scenarios using real-time and simulation-based case studies. The proposed architecture uses wearable sensors to record the observations in Body Area Networks (BANs) in a push-pull data fetching mechanism. The proposed architecture is found to be useful in remote and highly congested pandemic areas where either the wireless or Internet connectivity is a major issue or chances of COVID-19 spreading are high. It collects and stores the substantial amount of data in a stipulated period and helps to take appropriate action as and when required. In real-time drone-based healthcare system implementation for COVID-19 operations, it is observed that a large area can be covered for sanitization, thermal image collection, patient identification etc. within a short period (2 KMs within 10 minutes approx.) through aerial route. In the simulation, the same statistics are observed with an addition of collision-resistant strategies working successfully for indoor and outdoor healthcare operations.","Kumar, Adarsh; Sharma, Kriti; Singh, Harvinder; Naugriya, Sagar Gupta; Gill, Sukhpal Singh; Buyya, Rajkumar",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.06943v1.pdf,33

In both samples and across reporting methods (self and partner), the 16-item MMEA-SF has good internal consistency, good concurrent validity with the Revised Conflict Tactics Scales (CTS2) psychological aggression subscale, and similar correlations with CTS2 physical assault subscale as the original 28-item MMEA version. The MMEA-SF can reduce assessment burden while maintaining good domain coverage and strong psychometric properties and will be an asset to researchers and practitioners who need a brief, multifaceted measure of emotional relationship abuse in both clinic and undergraduate samples.","Maldonado, Ana I; Farzan-Kashani, Julian; Sun, Shuyan; Pitts, Steven C; Lorenzo, Jennifer M; Barry, Robin A; Murphy, Christopher M",J Interpers Violence,,33

However, sensitive populations submitted to longer periods of restrictions may experience detrimental effects in significant areas of their lifestyle, such as sexual activity. This study examines sexual activity during the COVID-19 confinement in Spain. A survey distributed through an institutional social media profile served to collect data, whereas chi-squared tests, t-tests, analyses of variance, and multiple logistic regression analysis were used to assess differences among sample subgroups. A total of 71.3% adults (N = 536) (72.8% female) reported engaging in sexual activity with a weekly average of 2.39 times (SD = 1.80), with significant differences favoring males, middle age, married/in a domestic relationship (p < 0.001), employed (p < 0.005), medium-high annual household income, living outside the Iberian Peninsula, and smoking and alcohol consumption. Analyses adjusted for the complete set of control variables showed significant odds for a lower prevalence of weekly sexual activity in women (OR = 0.44, 95% CI 0.27-0.72). Interventions to promote sexual activity in confined Spanish adults may focus on groups with lower sexual activity.","López-Bueno, Rubén; López-Sánchez, Guillermo F; Gil-Salmerón, Alejandro; Grabovac, Igor; Tully, Mark A; Casaña, José; Smith, Lee",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,33

333202,"Characterization of diketopiperazine heterodimers as potential chemical markers for discrimination of two dominant black aspergilli, Aspergillus niger and Aspergillus tubingensis",2020,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (CoV) 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes the coronavirus disease 2019, encodes several proteins whose roles are poorly understood. We tested their ability either to directly form plasma membrane ion channels or to change functions of two mammalian plasma membrane ion channels, the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) and the &#945;3ß4 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. In mRNA-injected Xenopus oocytes, none of nine SARS-CoV-2 proteins or two SARS-CoV-1 proteins produced conductances, nor did co-injection of several combinations. Immunoblots for ORF8, spike (S), and envelope (E) proteins revealed that the proteins are expressed at appropriate molecular weights. In experiments on coexpression with ENaC, three tested SARS proteins (SARS-CoV-1 E, SARS-CoV-2 E, and SARS-CoV-2 S) markedly decrease ENaC currents. SARS-CoV-1 S protein decreases ENaC currents modestly. Coexpressing the E proteins but not the S proteins with &#945;3ß4 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors significantly reduces acetylcholine-induced currents. ENaC inhibition does not occur if the SARS-CoV protein mRNAs are injected 24 h after the ENaC mRNAs, suggesting that SARS-CoV proteins affect early step(s) in functional expression of channel proteins. Consistent with the hypothesis that the SARS-CoV-2 S protein-induced ENaC inhibition involves competition for available protease, mutating the furin cleavage site in SARS-CoV-2 S protein partially relieves inhibition of ENaC currents. Extending previous suggestions that SARS proteins affect ENaC currents via protein kinase C (PKC) activation, PKC activation via phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate decreases ENaC and &#945;3ß4 activity. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate application reduced membrane capacitance â¼5%, presumably via increased endocytosis, but this decrease is much smaller than the SARS proteins' effects on conductances. Also, incubating oocytes in Gö-6976, a PKC&#945; and PKCß inhibitor, did not alter E or S protein-induced channel inhibition. We conclude that SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 proteins alter the function of human plasma membrane channels, via incompletely understood mechanisms. These interactions may play a role in the coronavirus 2019 pathophysiology.","Grant, Stephen N; Lester, Henry A",Biophys J,,33
333245,COVID-19 Vaccines Based on Adenovirus Vectors,2021,"BACKGROUND: The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has infected over 10 million people globally with a relatively high mortality rate. There are many therapeutics undergoing clinical trials, but there is no effective vaccine or therapy for treatment thus far. After affected by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), molecular signaling pathways of host cells play critical roles during the life cycle of SARS-CoV-2. Thus, it is significant to identify the involved molecular signaling pathways within the host cells. Drugs targeting these molecular signaling pathways could be potentially effective for COVID-19 treatment. METHODS: In this study, we developed a novel integrative analysis approach to identify the related molecular signaling pathways within host cells, and repurposed drugs as potentially effective treatments for COVID-19, based on the transcriptional response of host cells. RESULTS: We identified activated signaling pathways associated with the infection caused SARS-CoV-2 in human lung epithelial cells through integrative analysis. Then, the activated gene ontologies (GOs) and super GOs were identified. Signaling pathways and GOs such as MAPK, JNK, STAT, ERK, JAK-STAT, IRF7-NFkB signaling, and MYD88/CXCR6 immune signaling were particularly activated. Based on the identified signaling pathways and GOs, a set of potentially effective drugs were repurposed by integrating the drug-target and reverse gene expression data resources. In addition to many drugs being evaluated in clinical trials, the dexamethasone was top-ranked in the prediction, which was the first reported drug to be able to significantly reduce the death rate of COVID-19 patients receiving respiratory support. CONCLUSIONS: The integrative genomics data analysis and results can be helpful to understand the associated molecular signaling pathways within host cells, and facilitate the discovery of effective drugs for COVID-19 treatment.","Li, Fuhai; Michelson, Andrew P; Foraker, Randi; Zhan, Ming; Payne, Philip R O",BMC Med Inform Decis Mak,,33

Therefore, it is being stressed by transfusion medicine specialists to use COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) therapy early in the course of the disease, preferably within 72h of diagnosis. The authors herein, propose a scoring system for the rapid assessment of the patients who have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, a systematic approach may be followed where the patients are categorised into two groups, namely, the low-risk group [LRG; score<5] and the high-risk group [HRG; score &#8805; 5] based on this scoring system. Those classified as an HRG should be administered CCP therapy within 72h of a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 to neutralise the SARS-CoV-2 virus and prevent the occurrence of the cytokine storm. This in turn could help reduce the overall mortality in the recipients.","Bansal, Naveen; Raturi, Manish; Bansal, Yashik; Singh, Pushpendra",Transfus. clin. biol,,33

337870,Workshop report: Exploring deep oceanic crust off Hawai`i,2021,"There has been a dramatic increase in the popularity of utilizing social media data for research purposes within the biomedical community. In PubMed alone, there have been nearly 2,500 publication entries since 2014 that deal with analyzing social media data from Twitter and Reddit. However, the vast majority of those works do not share their code or data for replicating their studies. With minimal exceptions, the few that do, place the burden on the researcher to figure out how to fetch the data, how to best format their data, and how to create automatic and manual annotations on the acquired data. In order to address this pressing issue, we introduce the Social Media Mining Toolkit (SMMT), a suite of tools aimed to encapsulate the cumbersome details of acquiring, preprocessing, annotating and standardizing social media data. The purpose of our toolkit is for researchers to focus on answering research questions, and not the technical aspects of using social media data. By using a standard toolkit, researchers will be able to acquire, use, and release data in a consistent way that is transparent for everybody using the toolkit, hence, simplifying research reproducibility and accessibility in the social media domain.","Tekumalla, Ramya; Banda, Juan M.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.13894v1.pdf,33

Objectives: To investigate the predictive factors of the outcome of moderate-stage coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and maximal extent of lung injury. Patients and Methods: This study was a retrospective analysis of 97 patients with moderate-stage COVID-19 diagnosed in our hos-pital. We divided the patients into two groups according to disease progression: one group for moderate stage and another for both severe stage and critically severe stage COVID-19. We then analyzed the independent factors influencing changes in the course of the disease in moderate-stage patients using binary logistic regression. Next, we assessed the computed tomography (CT) score of maximal lung injury using follow-up images of the patients. We used multiple linear regression (MLR) to analyze the independent variables, and to predict the CT score of maximal lung injury in COVID-19 patients. Results: The results were obtained using multivariate logistic regression analysis, and the independent factors affecting clinical classification were baseline CT score (P = 0.008), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) (P = 0.001), and diabetes (P = 0.04). MLR revealed that the factors predicting the extent of maximal lung injury in COVID-19 patients were age (P = 0.014), neutrophil percentage (P = 0.038), lymphocyte percentage (P = 0.031), hs-CRP (P = 0.010), and baseline CT score (P &lt; 0.001). The optimal cut-off value of hs-CRP was 18.5, and the baseline CT score was 8.5. Conclusion: Age, baseline CT score, hs-CRP, neutrophil percentage, and lymphocyte percentage could predict the CT score of maximal lung injury, and hs-CRP &gt; 18.5, baseline CT score ≥ 9, and diabetes were independent factors of severe/critically severe COVID-19.","Chen, P.; Fan, N.; Liang, Y.; Fan, W.",Iranian Journal of Radiology,,33

Aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of lockdown on glycemic control in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes (T1D) followed through telemedicine. Subjects/Methods: This observational study involved patients with T1D using the real-time continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) Dexcom G6®. Ambulatory glucose profile data from the 3-months before schools closure (November 26, 2019-February 23, 2020; T0) and from the 3-months of consecutive lockdown (February 24-May 18, 2020; T1) were compared. Results: Sixty-two children and adolescents (11.1 ± 4.37 years, 50% males) with T1D (median time disease 3.67 years) were enrolled in the study. Insulin total daily dose was unchanged, while time spent on physical activities was decreased (p<0.0001). Despite the lack of statistical significance, median value of the glucose management indicator decreased from 7.4% to 7.25%. Glucose standard deviation (p<0.0001) and coefficient of variation (p=0.001) improved across the study. Median time in range increased from 60.5% to 63.5% (p=0.008), time above range decreased from 37.3% to 34.1% (p=0.048), and time below range decreased from 1.85% to 1.45% (p=0.001). Conclusions: Overall, in our children and adolescents with T1D glycemic control improved during lockdown. Despite patients were confined to their homes and limited to exercise, our data suggest that the use of real-time CGM, the continuous parental management, and the telemedicine can display beneficial effects on T1D care.","Predieri, Barbara; Leo, Francesco; Candia, Francesco; Lucaccioni, Laura; Madeo, Simona F; Pugliese, Marisa; Vivaccia, Valentina; Bruzzi, Patrizia; Iughetti, Lorenzo",Front Endocrinol (Lausanne),,33

344070,Safe Blues: The case for virtual safe virus spread in the long-term fight against epidemics,2021,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has limited daily activities and even contact between patients and primary care providers. This makes it more difficult to provide adequate primary care services, which include connecting patients to an appropriate medical specialist. A smartphone-compatible artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot that classifies patients' symptoms and recommends the appropriate medical specialty could provide a valuable solution. OBJECTIVE: In order to establish a contactless method of recommending the appropriate medical specialty, this study aimed to construct a deep learning-based natural language processing (NLP) pipeline and to develop an AI chatbot that can be used on a smartphone. METHODS: We collected 118,008 sentences containing information on symptoms with labels (medical specialty), conducted data cleansing, and finally constructed a pipeline of 51,134 sentences for this study. Several deep learning models, including 4 different long short-term memory (LSTM) models with or without attention and with or without a pretrained FastText embedding layer, as well as bidirectional encoder representations from transformers for NLP, were trained and validated using a randomly selected test data set. The performance of the models was evaluated on the basis of the precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). An AI chatbot was also designed to make it easy for patients to use this specialty recommendation system. We used an open-source framework called ""Alpha"" to develop our AI chatbot. This takes the form of a web-based app with a frontend chat interface capable of conversing in text and a backend cloud-based server application to handle data collection, process the data with a deep learning model, and offer the medical specialty recommendation in a responsive web that is compatible with both desktops and smartphones. RESULTS: The bidirectional encoder representations from transformers model yielded the best performance, with an AUC of 0.964 and F1-score of 0.768, followed by LSTM model with embedding vectors, with an AUC of 0.965 and F1-score of 0.739. Considering the limitations of computing resources and the wide availability of smartphones, the LSTM model with embedding vectors trained on our data set was adopted for our AI chatbot service. We also deployed an Alpha version of the AI chatbot to be executed on both desktops and smartphones. CONCLUSIONS: With the increasing need for telemedicine during the current COVID-19 pandemic, an AI chatbot with a deep learning-based NLP model that can recommend a medical specialty to patients through their smartphones would be exceedingly useful. This chatbot allows patients to identify the proper medical specialist in a rapid and contactless manner, based on their symptoms, thus potentially supporting both patients and primary care providers.","Lee, Hyeonhoon; Kang, Jaehyun; Yeo, Jonghyeon",J Med Internet Res,,33
344596,Revising Pharmacokinetics of Oral Drug Absorption: I Models Based on Biopharmaceutical/Physiological and Finite Absorption Time Concepts,2020,"Extensive research has demonstrated the transactional nature of parent-child psychopathology, with limited studies examining these effects during late adolescence and none, to our knowledge, longitudinally during the COVID-19 pandemic. The current study examined the cross-lagged effects of parent and adolescent internalizing symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic and the moderating role of avoidant coping. A sample of 291 adolescents (Age mean = 18.27; 53% female; 61% White) and their parents rated their own anxiety and depressive symptoms and coping during the first two months following stay-at-home orders during the COVID-19 pandemic. Parent internalizing symptoms at the first assessment predicted adolescent internalizing symptoms at the second assessment. Adolescent avoidant coping style moderated this effect of parent internalizing symptoms on adolescent internalizing symptoms in the subsequent month, such that parent internalizing symptoms predicted child internalizing symptoms only among adolescents with moderate to high rates of avoidant coping. Follow-up analyses indicated different patterns when examining depressive and anxiety symptoms separately. The results highlight complex family dynamics between adolescents and their parents and begin to differentiate how individual characteristics impact the response to a significant life event such as the COVID-19 pandemic.","Lorenzo, Nicole E; Zeytinoglu, Selin; Morales, Santiago; Listokin, Jamie; Almas, Alisa N; Degnan, Kathryn A; Henderson, Heather; Chronis-Tuscano, Andrea; Fox, Nathan A",J Youth Adolesc,,33

It has had a devastating effect around the world, not only for public health, but also for the economy, labor market, and other facets of individual and societal life. Health systems have been put under high strain, and health professionals have experienced unusual and stressful work circumstances. With the aim of drawing lessons for nursing education, the present study analyzed, during the weeks of peak infection in Spain, the stress experience and coping strategies of a sample of 403 nurses from the Spanish health system. Specifically, we analyzed how tenure, stress appraisal, problem-focused coping, and support-seeking coping predicted nurses' awareness of their education needs, both in terms of technical-professional knowledge and skills and transversal skills. Structural equation modeling analysis revealed that more tenure (years of experience) was related to lower stress appraisal (workload, -0.12, p < 0.05; insufficient preparation, -0.33, p < 0.001; and fear of contagion -0.36, p < 0.001) and more problem focused coping (PFC) strategies were related to higher awareness of professional (0.18, p < 0.01) and transversal educational needs (0.17, p < 0.01) while support seeking strategies just related to transversal training needs (0.10, p < 0.05). Moreover, the participants provided valuable input about specific contents to be considered in future nursing education programs.

354612,"The COVID-19 Vaccines: Recent Development, Challenges and Prospects",2021,"BACKGROUND: Older people are at increased risk of adverse health events because of reduced physical activity. There is concern that activity levels are further reduced in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, as many older people are practicing physical and social distancing to minimize transmission. Mobile health (mHealth) and eHealth technologies may offer a means by which older people can engage in physical activity while physically distancing. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess the evidence for mHealth or eHealth technology in the promotion of physical activity among older people aged 50 years or older. METHODS: We conducted a rapid review of reviews using PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. We searched for systematic reviews published in the English language in 3 electronic databases: MEDLINE, CINAHL Plus, and Scopus. Two reviewers used predefined inclusion criteria to select relevant reviews and extracted data on review characteristics and intervention effectiveness. Two independent raters assessed review quality using the AMSTAR-2 tool. RESULTS: Titles and abstracts (n=472) were screened, and 14 full-text reviews were assessed for eligibility. Initially, we included 5 reviews but excluded 1 from the narrative as it was judged to be of critically low quality. Three reviews concluded that mHealth or eHealth interventions were effective in increasing physical activity. One review found that the evidence was inconclusive. CONCLUSIONS: There is low to moderate evidence that interventions delivered via mHealth or eHealth approaches may be effective in increasing physical activity in older adults in the short term. Components of successful interventions include self-monitoring, incorporation of theory and behavior change techniques, and social and professional support.","McGarrigle, Lisa; Todd, Chris",J Med Internet Res,,33

Elevated cytokines, such as interferon-Î³ (IFN-Î³), in offspring's brains play a central role. IFN-Î³ activates an antiviral cellular state, limiting viral entry and replication. Moreover, IFN-Î³ is implicated in brain development. We tested the hypothesis that IFN-Î³ signaling contributes to molecular and cellular phenotypes associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. Transient IFN-Î³ treatment of neural progenitors derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells increased neurite outgrowth. RNA sequencing analysis revealed that major histocompatibility complex class I (MHCI) genes were persistently up-regulated through neuronal differentiation-an effect that was mediated by IFN-Î³-induced promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) nuclear bodies. Critically, IFN-Î³-induced neurite outgrowth required both PML and MHCI. We also found evidence that IFN-Î³ disproportionately altered the expression of genes associated with schizophrenia and autism, suggesting convergence between genetic and environmental risk factors. Together, these data implicate IFN-Î³ signaling in neurodevelopmental disorder etiology.","Warre-Cornish, Katherine; Perfect, Leo; Nagy, Roland; Duarte, Rodrigo R R; Reid, Matthew J; Raval, Pooja; Mueller, Annett; Evans, Amanda L; Couch, Amalie; Ghevaert, Cédric; McAlonan, Grainne; Loth, Eva; Murphy, Declan; Powell, Timothy R; Vernon, Anthony C; Srivastava, Deepak P; Price, Jack",Sci.

358157,Greater functional similarity in mobile compared to sessile assemblages colonizing artificial coastal habitats,2021,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has caused significant mortality and morbidity worldwide, sparing almost no community. As the disease will likely remain a threat for years to come, an understanding of the precise influences of human demographics and settlement, as well as the dynamic factors of climate, susceptible depletion, and intervention, on the spread of localized epidemics will be vital for mounting an effective response. We consider the entire set of local epidemics in the United States; a broad selection of demographic, population density, and climate factors; and local mobility data, tracking social distancing interventions, to determine the key factors driving the spread and containment of the virus. Assuming first a linear model for the rate of exponential growth (or decay) in cases/mortality, we find that population-weighted density, humidity, and median age dominate the dynamics of growth and decline, once interventions are accounted for. A focus on distinct metropolitan areas suggests that some locales benefited from the timing of a nearly simultaneous nationwide shutdown, and/or the regional climate conditions in mid-March; while others suffered significant outbreaks prior to intervention. Using a first-principles model of the infection spread, we then develop predictions for the impact of the relaxation of social distancing and local climate conditions. A few regions, where a significant fraction of the population was infected, show evidence that the epidemic has partially resolved via depletion of the susceptible population (i.e.,""herd immunity""), while most regions in the United States remain overwhelmingly susceptible. These results will be important for optimal management of intervention strategies, which can be facilitated using our online dashboard.","Afshordi, Niayesh; Holder, Benjamin; Bahrami, Mohammad; Lichtblau, Daniel",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.00159v1.pdf,33

To probe the action of biochar on soil aggregates, a 5-year field experiment was implemented in the brown earth soil of northeastern China. We determined the aggregate distribution (> 2000 µm, 250-2000 µm, 53-250 µm, and < 53 µm) and organic carbon (OC) and organo-mineral complex contents both in the topsoil (0-20 cm) and within the soil aggregates. Three treatments were studied as follows: control (basal application of mineral NPK fertilizer), biochar (biochar applied at a rate of 2.625 t ha-1), and stover (maize stover applied at a rate of 7.5 t ha-1), and all treatments received the same fertilization. The biochar and stover applications decreased the soil bulk and particle densities significantly (p < 0.05) and enhanced the soil total porosity. Both amendments significantly (p < 0.05) enhanced the total OC, heavy OC fractions, and organo-mineral complex quantities in the bulk soil as well as in all the studied aggregate fractions. Biochar and stover applications promoted the formation of small macroaggregates. A greater amount of organic matter was contained in the macroaggregates, which led to the formation of more organo-mineral complexes, thereby improving soil aggregate stability. However, the different mechanisms underlying the effect of biochar and stover on organo-mineral complexes need further research. Biochar and stover applications are both effective methods of improving the soil structure in Northeast China.","Sun, Qiang; Meng, Jun; Sarkar, Binoy; Lan, Yu; Lin, Li; Li, Haifeng; Yang, Xu; Yang, Tiexin; Chen, Wenfu; Wang, Hailong",,,33

Here, we report for the first time that the 11S proteasomal activator PA28Î³ regulates the intracellular abundance of the SARS-CoV-2 N protein (nCoV N). Furthermore, we have identified proteasome activator PA28Î³ as a nCoV N binding protein by co-immunoprecipitation assay. As a result of their interaction, nCoV N could be degraded by PA28Î³-20S in vitro degradation assay. This was also demonstrated by blocking de novo protein synthesis with cycloheximide. The stability of nCoV N in PA28Î³-knockout cells was greater than in PA28Î³-wildtype cells. Notably, immunofluorescence staining revealed that knockout of the PA28Î³ gene in cells led to the transport of nCoV N from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Overexpression of PA28Î³ enhanced proteolysis of nCoV N compared to that in PA28Î³-N151Y cells containing a dominant-negative PA28Î³ mutation, which reduced this process. These results suggest that PA28Î³ binding is important in regulating 20S proteasome activity, which in turn regulates levels of the critical nCoV N nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2, furthering our understanding of the pathogenesis of COVID-19.","Zhang, Haiyang; Tu, Jialu; Cao, Chulei; Yang, Ting; Gao, Liangcai",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,,33

The final usable data were obtained from the formal survey of 311 employees of six manufacturing companies that have returned to work amid COVID-19. Structural equation modelling was adopted to analyze the data. Results show that employees' JCB strengthens their occupational satisfaction and IWB via work engagement. Theoretically, our research enriches the existing body of knowledge about JCB from a cross-disciplinary angle integrating the perspectives of career and psychology. Practically, we offer valuable first-hand evidence about how manufacturing employees conducted JCB to re-orient their careers and to innovate in the face of the high unemployment situation.","Ren, Tianzhou; Cao, Lele; Chin, Tachia",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,33
370246,The Doctor Stamp and COVID-19: A Perspective,2021,"Since the first recording of what we now call Covid-19 infection in Wuhan, Hubei province, China on Dec 31, 2019, the disease has spread worldwide and met with a wide variety of social distancing and quarantine policies. The effectiveness of these responses is notoriously difficult to quantify as individuals travel, violate policies deliberately or inadvertently, and infect others without themselves being detected. In this paper, we attempt to interpret and extrapolate from publicly available data using a mixed first-principles epidemiological equations and data-driven neural network model. Leveraging our neural network augmented model, we focus our analysis on four locales: Wuhan, Italy, South Korea and the United States of America, and compare the role played by the quarantine and isolation measures in each of these countries in controlling the effective reproduction number $R_{t}$ of the virus. Our results unequivocally indicate that the countries in which rapid government interventions and strict public health measures for quarantine and isolation were implemented were successful in halting the spread of infection and prevent it from exploding exponentially. We test the predictive ability of our model by matching predictions in the duration 3 March - 1 April 2020 for Wuhan and in the duration 25 March - 1 April 2020 for Italy and South Korea. In the case of the US, our model captures well the current infected curve growth and predicts a halting of infection spread by 20 April 2020. We further demonstrate that relaxing or reversing quarantine measures right now will lead to an exponential explosion in the infected case count, thus nullifying the role played by all measures implemented in the US since mid March 2020.","Dandekar, Raj; Barbastathis, George",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.02752v1.pdf,33

372173,Application of Viral Vectors for Vaccine Development with a Special Emphasis on COVID-19,2020,"Rates of food insecurity skyrocketed during the COVID-19 pandemic, doubling overall and tripling among households with children. Even before the pandemic, the rate of food insecurity in the United States was “unusually high” compared to other rich democracies, and rates have not improved substantially over the last 25 years. What explains the lack of progress in addressing food insecurity? This article maps out an overview of the experiences, causes, and consequences of food insecurity in the United States. We demonstrate that racism is a fundamental cause of food insecurity, both because racism contributes to racial disparities in income and wealth, and because racism is linked to food insecurity independent of poverty and socioeconomic status. For example, people of color are more likely to experience racial discrimination, which is associated with food insecurity, and to live in states where stricter regulations and harsher punishments are tied to social assistance programs, including food assistance programs. Because racism is a fundamental cause of food insecurity, eliminating it requires going beyond “just” eliminating poverty. Instead, the fundamental cause must be tackled directly: racism itself, which is built into the structure of American society and entrenched in its institutions. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Bowen, S.; Elliott, S.; Hardison-Moody, A.",Sociology Compass,,33

Both analyses were performed for the pandemic lockdown due to COVID-19 in the City of Buenos Aires (CABA), the capital and the largest city in Argentina. Daily data from temperature, rainfall, average relative humidity, wind speed, PM&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;, NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, new cases and deaths due COVID-19 were analyzed. Our findings showed a significant correlation of meteorological and air quality variables with COVID-19 cases. The highest temperature correlation occurred before the confirmation day of new cases. PM&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; presented the highest correlation within 13 to 15 days lag, while NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; within 3 to 6 days lag. Also, reductions in PM&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; and NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; were observed. This study shows that exposure to air pollution was significantly correlated with an increased risk of becoming infected and dying due to COVID-19. Thus, these results show that the NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and PM&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; levels in CABA can serve as one of the indicators to assess vulnerability to COVID-19.

373494,Application of DNA sequences in anti-counterfeiting: Current progress and challenges,2021,"BACKGROUND: The outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) has shown a global spreading trend. Early and effective predictors of clinical outcomes are urgently needed to improve management of Covid-19 patients. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether elevated D-dimer levels could predict mortality in patients with Covid-19. METHODS: Patients with laboratory confirmed Covid-19 were retrospective enrolled in Wuhan Asia General Hospital from January 12, 2020, to March 15, 2020. D-dimer levels on admission and death events were collected to calculate the optimum cutoff using receiver operating characteristic curves. According to the cutoff, the subjects were divided into two groups. Then the in-hospital mortality between two groups were compared to assess the predictive value of D-dimer level. RESULTS: A total of 343 eligible patients were enrolled in the study. The optimum cutoff value of D-dimer to predict in-hospital mortality was 2.0 µg/mL with a sensitivity of 92.3% and a specificity of 83.3%. There were 67 patients with D-dimer &#8805;2.0 µg/mL, and 267 patients with D-dimer <2.0 µg/mL on admission. 13 deaths occurred during hospitalization. Patients with D-dimer levels &#8805;2.0 µg/mL had a higher incidence of mortality when comparing with those who with D-dimer levels <2.0 µg/mL (12/67 vs 1/267, P < .001; hazard ratio, 51.5; 95% confidence interval, 12.9-206.7). CONCLUSIONS: D-dimer on admission greater than 2.0 µg/mL (fourfold increase) could effectively predict in-hospital mortality in patients with Covid-19, which indicated D-dimer could be an early and helpful marker to improve management of Covid-19 patients.

374471,Next-Generation COVID-19 Vaccines Should Take Efficiency of Distribution into Consideration,2021,"BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic presents a significant challenge to minimize mortality and hospitalizations due to this disease. Vaccinations have begun to roll-out; however, restriction policies required during and after the rollout remain uncertain. A susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) model was developed for Nova Scotia, and it accounted for the provinces policy interventions, demographics, and vaccine rollout schedule. MethodsA modified SEIR model was developed to simulate the spread and outcomes from COVID-19 in Nova Scotia under different policy options. The model incorporated the age distribution and co-morbidity of the province. A system dynamics model was developed in Vensim. Several scenarios were run to determine the effects of various policy options and loosening of restrictions during and after the vaccine roll-out period. ResultsWhen restrictions policy include moderate closure of businesses, restricting travel to Atlantic Canada, and the mandating of masks and physical distancing, the number of cumulative infections after 110 days was less than 120. However, if national travel was opened by July 5 2021 and there were no restrictions by September 2021, the number of active infections will peak at 6,114 by February 16 2022, and there will be a peak of 104 hospitalizations on February 16 2022. Immediate opening of travel and all restrictions on March 15, 2021 will result in 71,731 active infections by June 4 2021. DiscussionModerate restrictions will be required even after the population is fully vaccinated in order to avoid a large number of infections and hospitalizations because herd immunity is not reached due to children under 12 not being vaccinated, the efficacy of the vaccine, and the portion of the population that will choose not to be vaccinated.","Gillis, Melissa; Saif, Ahmed; Murphy, Matthew; Kamal, Noreen",,,33

This includes determining initial triggers, timing of symptoms, associated features, and exacerbating factors. This article covers distinct causes of chronic dizziness including persistent postural perceptual dizziness, mal de débarquement syndrome, motion sickness and visually induced motion sickness, bilateral vestibulopathy, and persistent dizziness after mild concussion. RECENT FINDINGS: To date, none of the disorders above has a cure but are considered chronic syndromes with fluctuations that are both innate and driven by environmental stressors. As such, the mainstay of therapy for chronic disorders of dizziness involves managing factors that exacerbate symptoms and adding vestibular rehabilitation or cognitive-behavioral therapy alone or in combination, as appropriate. These therapies are supplemented by serotonergic antidepressants that modulate sensory gating and reduce anxiety. Besides expectation management, ruling out concurrent disorders and recognizing behavioral and lifestyle factors that affect symptom severity are critical issues in reducing morbidity for each disorder. SUMMARY: Many syndromes of chronic dizziness can be diagnosed by recognition of key features, although many symptoms overlap between these groups. Symptoms may be manageable and improve with time, but they are often incompletely relieved.","Cha, Yoon-Hee",Continuum (Minneap Minn),,33

We aimed to determine the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, as compared to influenza pneumonia or no viral infection, and the incidence of VA-LRTI. METHODS: Multicenter retrospective European cohort performed in 36 ICUs. All adult patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation > 48 h were eligible if they had: SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, influenza pneumonia, or no viral infection at ICU admission. VA-LRTI, including ventilator-associated tracheobronchitis (VAT) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), were diagnosed using clinical, radiological and quantitative microbiological criteria. All VA-LRTI were prospectively identified, and chest-X rays were analyzed by at least two physicians. Cumulative incidence of first episodes of VA-LRTI was estimated using the Kalbfleisch and Prentice method, and compared using Fine-and Gray models. RESULTS: 1576 patients were included (568 in SARS-CoV-2, 482 in influenza, and 526 in no viral infection groups). VA-LRTI incidence was significantly higher in SARS-CoV-2 patients (287, 50.5%), as compared to influenza patients (146, 30.3%, adjusted sub hazard ratio (sHR) 1.60 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.26 to 2.04)) or patients with no viral infection (133, 25.3%, adjusted sHR 1.7 (95% CI 1.2 to 2.39)). Gram-negative bacilli were responsible for a large proportion (82% to 89.7%) of VA-LRTI, mainly Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter spp., and Klebsiella spp. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of VA-LRTI is significantly higher in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, as compared to patients with influenza pneumonia, or no viral infection after statistical adjustment, but residual confounding may still play a role in the effect estimates.","Rouzé, Anahita; Martin-Loeches, Ignacio; Povoa, Pedro; Makris, Demosthenes; Artigas, Antonio; Bouchereau, Mathilde; Lambiotte, Fabien; Metzelard, Matthieu; Cuchet, Pierre; Boulle Geronimi, Claire; Labruyere, Marie; Tamion, Fabienne; Nyunga, Martine; Luyt, Charles-Edouard; Labreuche, Julien; Pouly, Olivier; Bardin, Justine; Saade, Anastasia; Asfar, Pierre; Baudel, Jean-Luc; Beurton, Alexandra; Garot, Denis; Ioannidou, Iliana; Kreitmann, Louis; Llitjos, Jean-François; Magira, Eleni; Mégarbane, Bruno; Meguerditchian, David; Moglia, Edgar; Mekontso-Dessap, Armand; Reignier, Jean; Turpin, Matthieu; Pierre, Alexandre; Plantefeve, Gaetan; Vinsonneau, Christophe; Floch, Pierre-Edouard; Weiss, Nicolas; Ceccato, Adrian; Torres, Antoni; Duhamel, Alain; Nseir, Saad",Intensive Care Med,,33

However, preliminary scientific research does not conclusively associate cannabis with improved mental health. In this study, we explore the relationship between depression and consumption of cannabis in a targeted social media corpus involving personal use of cannabis with the intent to derive its potential mental health benefit. We use tweets that contain an association among three categories annotated by domain experts - Reason, Effect, and Addiction. The state-of-the-art Natural Langauge Processing techniques fall short in extracting these relationships between cannabis phrases and the depression indicators. We seek to address the limitation by using domain knowledge; specifically, the Drug Abuse Ontology for addiction augmented with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders lexicons for mental health. Because of the lack of annotations due to the limited availability of the domain experts' time, we use supervised contrastive learning in conjunction with GPT-3 trained on a vast corpus to achieve improved performance even with limited supervision. Experimental results show that our method can significantly extract cannabis-depression relationships better than the state-of-the-art relation extractor. High-quality annotations can be provided using a nearest neighbor approach using the learned representations that can be used by the scientific community to understand the association between cannabis and depression better.","Roy, Kaushik; Lokala, Usha; Khandelwal, Vedant; Sheth, Amit",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01222v1.pdf,33

The experienced radiologists can offer precise diagnosis according to the chest radiographs. The localization of the pneumothorax lesions will help to quickly diagnose, which will be benefit for the patients in the underdevelopment areas lack of the experienced radiologists. In recent years, with the development of large neural network architectures and medical imaging datasets, deep learning methods have become a methodology of choice for analyzing medical images. The objective of this study was to the construct convolutional neural networks to localize the pneumothorax lesions in chest radiographs. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We developed a convolutional neural network, called CheXLocNet, for the segmentation of pneumothorax lesions. The SIIM-ACR Pneumothorax Segmentation dataset was used to train and validate CheXLocNets. The training dataset contained 2079 radiographs with the annotated lesion areas. We trained six CheXLocNets with various hyperparameters. Another 300 annotated radiographs were used to select parameters of these CheXLocNets as the validation set. We determined the optimal parameters by the AP50 (average precision at the intersection over union (IoU) equal to 0.50), a segmentation evaluation metric used by several well-known competitions. Then CheXLocNets were evaluated by a test set (1082 normal radiographs and 290 disease radiographs), based on the classification metrics: area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value (PPV); segmentation metrics: IoU and Dice score. For the classification, CheXLocNet with best sensitivity produced an AUC of 0.87, sensitivity of 0.78 (95% CI 0.73-0.83), and specificity of 0.78 (95% CI 0.76-0.81). CheXLocNet with best specificity produced an AUC of 0.79, sensitivity of 0.46 (95% CI 0.40-0.52), and specificity of 0.92 (95% CI 0.90-0.94). For the segmentation, CheXLocNet with best sensitivity produced an IoU of 0.69 and Dice score of 0.72. CheXLocNet with best specificity produced an IoU of 0.77 and Dice score of 0.79. We combined them to form an ensemble CheXLocNet. The ensemble CheXLocNet produced an IoU of 0.81 and Dice score of 0.82. Our CheXLocNet succeeded in automatically detecting pneumothorax lesions, without any human guidance. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we proposed a deep learning network, called, CheXLocNet, for the automatic segmentation of chest radiographs to detect pneumothorax. Our CheXLocNets generated accurate classification results and high-quality segmentation masks for the pneumothorax at the same time. This technology has the potential to improve healthcare delivery and increase access to chest radiograph expertise for the detection of diseases. Furthermore, the segmentation results can offer comprehensive geometric information of lesions, which can benefit monitoring the sequential development of lesions with high accuracy. Thus, CheXLocNets can be further extended to be a reliable clinical decision support tool.

389317,Offline: a different kind of lockdown,2020,"The dance between microbes and the immune system takes place in all biological systems, including the human body, but this interaction is especially complex in the primary gateway to the body: the oral cavity. Recent advances in technology have enabled deep sequencing and analysis of members and signals of these communities. In a healthy state, the oral microbiome is composed of commensals, and their genes and phenotypes may be selected by the immune system to survive in symbiosis. These highly regulated signals are modulated by a network of microbial and host metabolites. However, in a diseased state, host-microbial networks lead to dysbiosis and considerable burden to the host prior to systemic impact that extends beyond the oral compartment. Interestingly, we presented data demonstrating similarities between human and mice immune dysbiosis and discussed how this affects the host response to similar pathobionts. The host and microbial signatures of a number of disease states are currently being examined to identify potential correlations. How the oral microbiome interacts with inflammation and the immune system to cause disease remains an area of active research. In this review, we summarize recent advancements in understanding the role of oral microbiota in mediating inflammation and altering systemic health and disease. In line with these findings, it is possible that existing conditions may be resolved by targeting specific immune-microbial markers in a positive way.","Kleinstein, S E; Nelson, K E; Freire, M",J Dent Res,,33

Stress, isolation, lack of structure, limited access to physical and mental health care, and changes in treatment paradigms all increase risk of return to drug use events and pose barriers to recovery for people with SUDs. The pandemic has forced treatment providers and facilities to rapidly adapt to address these threats while redesigning their structure to accommodate physical distancing regulations. Digital health interventions can function without the need for physical proximity. Clinicians can use digital health intervention, such as telehealth, wearables, mobile applications, and other remote monitoring devices, to convert in-person care to remote-based care, and they can leverage these tools to address some of the pandemic-specific challenges to treatment.

393278,Affective empathy predicts self-isolation behaviour acceptance during coronavirus risk exposure,2021,"OBJECTIVES: This study investigated associations between perceptions of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in workers at hospitals designated to treat COVID-19, as well as the difference in the magnitude of these associations by occupational type and previous Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) experience. METHODS: The participants were workers at hospitals designated to treat COVID-19 who completed a questionnaire about their perceptions related to COVID-19, work experience during the previous MERS-CoV outbreak, and symptoms of PTSD ascertained by the PTSD Checklist for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. Participants' characteristics were compared using the chi-square test. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to evaluate the associations between perceptions and the prevalence of PTSD, stratified by occupational type and previous MERS-CoV experience. RESULTS: Non-medical personnel showed stronger associations with PTSD than medical personnel according to general fear (odds ratio [OR], 6.67; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.92 to 23.20), shortages of supplies (OR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.07 to 1.56), and issue-specific fear (OR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.05 to 1.59). Those with prior MERS-CoV quarantine experience were more prone to PTSD than those without such experience in terms of general fear (OR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.22 to 2.37), shortages of supplies (OR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.10 to 1.40), and issue-specific fear (OR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.06 to 1.38). CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, non-medical personnel tended to have higher odds of being categorized as having PTSD. Workers with prior MERS-CoV experience were more susceptible than those without such experience. These findings suggest the need for timely interventions to manage human resources for a sustainable quarantine system.","Lee, Youngrong; Kim, Kwanghyun; Park, Sungjin; Jung, Sun Jae",J Prev Med Public Health,,33

396172,Inside this Month's Cytopathology,2021,"We describe a practical two-dimensional (2D) diffusion MRI framework to deliver specificity and improve sensitivity to axonal injury in the spinal cord. This approach provides intravoxel distributions of correlations of water mobilities in orthogonal directions, revealing sub-voxel diffusion components. Here we use it to investigate water diffusivities along axial and radial orientations within spinal cord specimens with confirmed, tract-specific axonal injury. First, we show using transmission electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry that tract-specific axonal beading occurs following Wallerian degeneration in the cortico-spinal tract as direct sequelae to closed head injury. We demonstrate that although some voxel-averaged diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metrics are sensitive to this axonal injury, they are non-specific, i.e., they do not reveal an underlying biophysical mechanism of injury. Then we employ 2D diffusion correlation imaging (DCI) to improve discrimination of different water microenvironments by measuring and mapping the joint water mobility distributions perpendicular and parallel to the spinal cord axis. We determine six distinct diffusion spectral components that differ according to their microscopic anisotropy and mobility. We show that at the injury site a highly anisotropic diffusion component completely disappears and instead becomes more isotropic. Based on these findings, an injury-specific MR image of the spinal cord was generated, and a radiological-pathological correlation with histological silver staining % area was performed. The resulting strong and significant correlation (r=0.70,pâ¯<â¯0.0001) indicates the high specificity with which DCI detects injury-induced tissue alterations. We predict that the ability to selectively image microstructural changes following axonal injury in the spinal cord can be useful in clinical and research applications by enabling specific detection and increased sensitivity to injury-induced microstructural alterations. These results also encourage us to translate DCI to higher spatial dimensions to enable assessment of traumatic axonal injury, and possibly other diseases and disorders in the brain.","Benjamini, Dan; Hutchinson, Elizabeth B; Komlosh, Michal E; Comrie, Courtney J; Schwerin, Susan C; Zhang, Guofeng; Pierpaoli, Carlo; Basser, Peter J",Neuroimage,,33

The negative effect of the lockdown is more conspicuous among the less-educated workers than the highly-educated workers. Because Asian Americans are more likely to have a bachelor or higher degree than any other racial group, they are expected to be relatively immune to the drop in employment unless the detrimental impact of the lockdown is severer for Asian Americans. Exploiting the panel aspect of the Current Population Survey - Merged Outgoing Rotation Group, we examine the changes in At-work status before and after the lockdown and between the lockdown and months of the reopening. The empirical results uncover that Asian Americans are more negatively affected by the lockdown than any other racial group, net of education, immigration status, and other covariates. Surprisingly, the negative impact of the lockdown is entirely concentrated on less-educated Asian Americans. Regardless of gender, less-educated Asian Americans are substantially more likely to lose employment than equally educated Whites and are not more likely to regain employment during the reopening months. Other less-educated racial minorities do not experience more reduction in At-work status than Whites, net of covariates. Highly-educated Asian Americans' employment is equally affected by the lockdown with equally educated Whites.","Kim, Andrew Taeho; Kim, ChangHwan; Tuttle, Scott E; Zhang, Yurong",Res Soc Stratif Mobil,,33

Methods This multicenter retrospective cohort study included all patients who were hospitalized due to COVID-19 from 21 hospitals in Hubei province, China between December 31, 2019 and April 21, 2020. Patients who were aged < 18 or &#8805; 85 years old, in pregnancy, with acute lethal organ injury (e.g., acute myocardial infarction, severe acute pancreatitis, acute stroke), hypothyroidism, malignant diseases, severe malnutrition, and those with normal lipid profile under lipid-lowering medicines (e.g., statin, niacin, fenofibrate, gemfibrozil, and ezetimibe) were excluded. Propensity score matching (PSM) analysis at 1:1 ratio was performed to minimize baseline differences between patient groups of hyperlipidemia and non-hyperlipidemia. PSM analyses with the same strategies were further conducted for the parameters of hyperlipidemia in patients with increased triglyceride (TG), increased low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). Mixed-effect Cox model analysis was performed to investigate the associations of the 28-days all-cause deaths of COVID-19 patients with hyperlipidemia and the abnormalities of lipid parameters. The results were verified in male, female patients, and in patients with pre-existing CVDs and type 2 diabetes. Results Of 10 945 inpatients confirmed as COVID-19, there were 9822 inpatients included in the study, comprising 3513 (35.8%) cases without hyperlipidemia and 6309 (64.2%) cases with hyperlipidemia. Based on a mixed-effect Cox model after PSM at 1:1 ratio, hyperlipidemia was not associated with increased or decreased 28-day all-cause death [adjusted hazard ratio (HR), 1.17 (95% CI, 0.95-1.44), P =0.151]. We found that the parameters of hyperlipidemia were not associated with the risk of 28-day all-cause mortality [adjusted HR, 1.23 (95% CI, 0.98-1.55), P = 0.075 in TG increase group; 0.78 (95% CI, 0.57-1.07), P = 0.123 in LDL-C increase group; and 1.12 (95% CI, 0.9-1.39), P = 0.299 in HDL-C decrease group, respectively]. Hyperlipidemia was also not significantly associated with the increased mortality of COVID-19 in patients accompanied with CVDs or type 2 diabetes, and in both male and female cohorts. Conclusion Our study support that the imbalanced lipid profile is not significantly associated with the 28-day all-cause mortality of COVID-19 patients, even in those accompanied with CVDs or diabetes. Similar results were also obtained in subgroup analyses of abnormal lipid parameters. Therefore, hyperlipidemia might be not a major causative factor for poor outcome of COVID-19, which provides guidance for the intervention of inpatients during the epidemic of COVID-19.","Wu, Bin; Zhou, Jiang Hua; Wang, Wen Xin; Yang, Hui Lin; Xia, Meng; Zhang, Bing Hong; She, Zhi Gang; Li, Hong Liang",Chin Med Sci J,,33

398006,Human milk microbiome: From actual knowledge to future perspective,2021,"Restrictions on outdoor activities, tips for hygiene, and tips for mental health are among the most common initiatives to counter the COVID-19 pandemic. These measures aim to protect people's health and, at the same time, impact their social lives. So far, it is little known how people evaluate those anti-Corona measures with regard to their social spheres (close family, wider family and friends, colleagues, and society). Furthermore, it is plausible that the subjective evaluation of attitudinal objects and especially severe events, like the COVID-19 pandemic and the related counter-measures, is multidimensional. Against this background, we combine the social spheres with the elements of the Theory of Planned Behavior. On the methodological basis of the Means-End Theory of Complex Cognitive Structures, we determine the perceived relevance and quality of the attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, and social spheres regarding anti-Corona measures. Furthermore, the applied methodology allows the deduction of norm strategies to define the priority of securing or increasing the effectiveness of elements of anti-Corona measures. Based on the answers of 663 participants, we found that the protection from COVID-19 and its consequences (attitude) are more important to people than the practicability of anti-Corona measures in their social lives (perceived behavioral control), which, again, has a higher subjective relevance than the willingness to fulfill the expectations of others (subjective norm). Additionally, people distinguish between their close family (higher subjective relevance) and their other social spheres (lower subjective relevance). The people attribute the highest quality to the tips on hygiene, followed by the restrictions on outdoor activities and the tips for mental health. The protection and practicability of the anti-Corona measures have higher quality ratings than the willingness to fulfill the expectations of others. Based on the norm strategies, policymakers should secure the effectiveness of the current anti-Corona measures with a high priority by focusing on the protection and practicability with regard to close and wider family and friends. Increasing the effectiveness of the protection and practicability of anti-Corona measures in work and society also has a high priority. Focusing on the subjective norm should be of lower priority.","Godbersen, Hendrik; Hofmann, Laura Anna; Ruiz-Fernández, Susana",Front Psychol,,33

When faced with too many intervention choices, however, individuals may find it difficult to decide which option to take, especially when they lack the experience or knowledge to evaluate different options. The choice overload issue may negatively affect users' engagement in health management. In this study, we take a design-science perspective to propose a recommendation framework that helps users to select healthcare interventions. Taking into account that users' health behaviors can be highly dynamic and diverse, we propose a multi-armed bandit (MAB)-driven recommendation framework, which enables us to adaptively learn users' preference variations while promoting recommendation diversity in the meantime. To better adapt an MAB to the healthcare context, we synthesize two innovative model components based on prominent health theories. The first component is a deep-learning-based feature engineering procedure, which is designed to learn crucial recommendation contexts in regard to users' sequential health histories, health-management experiences, preferences, and intrinsic attributes of healthcare interventions. The second component is a diversity constraint, which structurally diversifies recommendations in different dimensions to provide users with well-rounded support. We apply our approach to an online weight management context and evaluate it rigorously through a series of experiments. Our results demonstrate that each of the design components is effective and that our recommendation design outperforms a wide range of state-of-the-art recommendation systems.

400950,Dynamic causal modelling of mitigated epidemiological outcomes,2020-11-24,"Proper simulation of processes of the natural gas industry such as dehydration, liquefaction and regasification require accurate prediction of thermodynamic properties of the working fluids. For such processes, cubic equations of state are the calculation methods most frequently employed. Among them, the Peng-Robinson equation is usually the one recommended for gas, refinery and petrochemical applications in many simulators. Numerous works have been proposed in order to improve the temperature dependence relation of the attraction parameter of the equation - the so called alpha function. In this work, five currently available alpha functions are evaluated for the prediction of molar volumes and enthalpies of natural gas samples. Additionally, parameters of one of the models are readjusted to volumetric data of methane, in order to represent its supercritical behavior more accurately. Experimental data of 44 mixtures are compared with calculated results. Van der Waals mixing rules are used, with binary interaction parameters set as zero. In the case of the original alpha function, it is also tested how the inclusion of non-zero binary parameters affects the predictions.

402248,"In the Age of Viral Pandemic, Can Ingredients Inspired by Human Milk and Infant Nutrition Be Repurposed to Support the Immune System?",2021,"While the implementation of physical distancing practices and renewed awareness of our ability to spread communicable diseases to one another were (and remain) important in mitigating the spread of infection, a downstream effect of the pandemic that is still not fully appreciated may be the long-term impact of these changes on mental health, specifically as a contributing factor to loneliness.1 Even as the world begins to emerge from the worst of the pandemic in terms of immediate danger to life and physical well-being, a full understanding of the overall impact of the last year on our mental health and wellness is just beginning. The negative effects of loneliness and social isolation are not limited to mental health issues, such as depression and anxiety, but also include physical maladies such as heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, and even higher overall mortality.5-7 The risk of a person developing one or more of these illnesses because of loneliness is comparable to that incurred from other, more well-known factors such as smoking and obesity, and in many studies, loneliness has been shown to be independently associated with the outcome.8,9 Especially important for the pharmacy student population, young people (ages 18-30 years) and students are at greater risk of experiencing loneliness, both prior to and during the pandemic, with the incidence of loneliness higher in these groups than in other demographic populations.10 Cross-sectional studies of different age groups have shown that upwards of 60% of older adults have never reported feeling lonely, whereas the rates of severe loneliness among young adults range from 20%-48%.11 Researchers theorize that, because loneliness is the distress experienced when there is a discrepancy between the expected and perceived quantity and quality of an individual's social interactions, loneliness may not be as closely tied to social isolation in older adults who have more fully developed and mature brains as it is in adolescents and young adults.12 Former US Surgeon General Vivek Murthy's book, Together: The Healing Power ofConnection in a Sometimes Lonely World, published in April 2020, details his experience in learning about the wide-ranging effects of loneliness on mental as well as physical health and its pervasive and growing presence in society, even prior to the pandemic.13 As he traveled across the United States speaking to different groups about public health issues such as cancer, smoking, and opioid use disorder, Murthy was surprised at the numbers of people across demographic groups and geographic areas who discussed with him their struggles with loneliness and feeling alone. In addition to disenfranchised grief over the loss of normal life, there can be a natural tendency to compare our own plight to that of others and employ the idea that ""things could be worse,"" an act known as comparative suffering}1 As discussed by author Brene Brown on her podcast Unlocking Us in the early stages of the pandemic, comparative suffering was a natural coping mechanism employed by many individuals in a noble attempt to encourage gratefulness both internally and externally.18 However well-intentioned, the challenge with comparative suffering over the long term is that it devalues and underappreciates the impact of our own emotions and suffering and buries or pushes them away to be dealt with at another time. Whether intentional or not, the message sent and received is that our feelings are wrong, causing some to even experience shame for feeling them. Because clinical loneliness can stem from the subjective experience of our social connections being inadequate to our needs, it is understandable how the pandemic and its aftermath may have set us up to experience loneliness.","Malcom, Daniel R.

The aim of this study is to evaluate which of these common markers of cardiac disease is the most useful predictor of fatal outcome in COVID-19 patients. One hundred and seventy-four patients affected with COVID-19 were recruited, and markers of cardiac disease and the clinical history of the patients were collected at admission in the infectious disease unit or intensive care unit. NT-proBNP, BNP and HsTnI values were higher in in-hospital non-surviving patients. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis of NT-proBNP, BNP and HsTnI was performed, with NT-proBNP (AUC = 0.951) and HsTnI (AUC = 0.947) being better performers (p = 0.01) than BNP (AUC = 0.777). Logistic regression was performed assessing the relation of HsTnI and NT-proBNP to fatal outcome adjusting for age and gender, with only NT-proBNP being significant. The population was then divided into two groups, one with higher NT-proBNP values at admission than the cut-off resulted from the ROC curve (511 ng/L) and a second one with lower values. The Kaplan–Meier analysis showed an absence of fatal outcome in the group of patients with NT-proBNP values lower than the cut-off (p &lt; 0.001). NT-proBNP proved to be the best prognostic tool for fatal outcome among markers of cardiac disease in COVID-19 patients.","de Falco, Renato Vargas Maria Palma Daniela Savoia Marcella Miscioscia Anna Pinchera Biagio Vano Martina Servillo Giuseppe Gentile Ivan Fortunato Giuliana",Journal of Clinical Medicine,,33

This study aims to investigate the psychological distress perceived by the Italian general population during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, and to analyze affective temperament and adult attachment styles as potential mediators. Through an online survey, we collected sociodemographic and lockdown-related information and evaluated distress, temperament, and attachment using the Kessler 10 Psychological Distress Scale (K10), the Temperament Evaluation of Memphis, Pisa, Paris and San Diego-Autoquestionnaire short version (TEMPS-A) and the Attachment Style Questionnaire (ASQ). In our sample (n = 500), 62% of the individuals reported no likelihood of psychological distress, whereas 19.4% and 18.6% displayed mild and moderate-to-severe likelihood. Cyclothymic (OR: 1.24; p < 0.001), depressive (OR: 1.52; p < 0.001) and anxious (OR: 1.58; p = 0.002) temperaments, and the ASQ ""Need for approval"" (OR: 1.08; p = 0.01) were risk factors for moderate-to-severe psychological distress compared to no distress, while the ASQ ""Confidence"" (OR: 0.89; p = 0.002) and ""Discomfort with closeness"" were protective (OR: 0.92; p = 0.001). Cyclothymic (OR: 1.17; p = 0.008) and depressive (OR: 1.32; p = 0.003) temperaments resulted as risk factors in subjects with moderate-to-severe psychological distress compared to mild distress, while the ASQ ""Confidence"" (OR: 0.92; p = 0.039) and ""Discomfort with closeness"" (OR: 0.94; p = 0.023) were protective. Our data indicated that a relevant rate of individuals may have experienced psychological distress following the COVID-19 outbreak. Specific affective temperament and attachment features predict the extent of mental health burden. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first data available on the psychological impact of the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic on a sizeable sample of the Italian population. Moreover, our study is the first to investigate temperament and attachment characteristics in the psychological response to the ongoing pandemic. Our results provide further insight into developing targeted intervention strategies.","Moccia, Lorenzo; Janiri, Delfina; Pepe, Maria; Dattoli, Luigi; Molinaro, Marzia; De Martin, Valentina; Chieffo, Daniela; Janiri, Luigi; Fiorillo, Andrea; Sani, Gabriele; Di Nicola, Marco",Brain Behav Immun,,33

404201,A Healing Handicraft,2020,"Beta-amyloid(Aß)-induced inflammation plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Nod-like receptor nucleotide-binding domain leucine rich repeat containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome is involved in the Aß-induced inflammation. However, the mechanisms by which extracellular Aß activates cytoplasmic NLRP3 inflammasome are poorly understood. Toll-like receptor 4(TLR4) acts as a sensor of Aß and performs a key role in neuroinflammation. TLR4 is involved in activating the NLRP3 inï¬ammasome in several diseases. In this study, the interaction between TLR4 and NLRP3 inflammasome in Aß1-42-induced neuroinflammation was investigated. BV-2 microglia and primary microglia were primed with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and then pretreated with TLR4 inhibitor CLI-095, followed by stimulation with Aß1-42. The protein expression of NLRP3, the adaptor protein apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC), and caspase-1 p 10 was detected by western blotting and immunostaining. The mRNA expression of inflammatory factors was measured by real-time PCR. The protein level of pro IL-1ß and IL-1ß was examined by ELISA. Activated microglia were examined by immunoï¬uorescence staining for ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule-1 (Iba-1). Conditioned medium of BV-2 cells was collected to challenge HT-22 neurons. Cell viability was assessed with MTT assay. Assessment of HT-22 cell apoptosis was performed by Annexin V/PI staining and western blotting to detect the protein level of cleaved caspase 3. The results showed that Aß1-42 activated and up-regulated the expression of NLRP3 inflammasome in BV-2 microglia, as indicated by increased activation of caspase-1 and secretion of IL-1ß. Pharmacological inhibition of TLR4 by CLI-095 abolished Aß1-42-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation, which curbed the development of inflammation and exerted protective effect on HT-22 neurons. Furthermore, the inhibitory effects of CLI-095 on Aß1-42-induced inflammation were reversed by NLRP3 activator ATP. Overall, our findings suggested TLR4 mediated Aß1-42-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation in mouse microglia. TLR4/NLRP3 pathway plays a critical role in Aß1-42-induced neuroinflammation.","Liu, Yang; Dai, Yue; Li, Qing; Chen, Chen; Chen, Hao; Song, Yuanjian; Hua, Fang; Zhang, Zuohui",Neurosci Lett,,33

Vahl) usually used to treat inflammatory diseases. However, little is known about the therapeutic effect of FSE on liver fibrosis. AIM OF THE STUDY: The purpose of our study was to investigate the therapeutic effect of FSE on liver fibrosis and reveal the underlying mechanism. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Liver fibrosis model was established by subcutaneous injection of olive oil containing 40% CCl4. Rat liver tissue morphologic pathology was investigated by using HE staining, Masson staining and Sirius red staining. Several biochemical markers including liver (ALT, AST, AKP, Î³-GT), fibrosis (HA, LN, PC III, Col IV) and inflammation (IL-6, IL-1ß, TNF-&#945;) were determined by using Elisa kits. Immunohistochemistry was used to observe the distribution of &#945;-SMA and COL1 in liver tissue. Effects of FSE on inflammatory pathway (TLR4/MyD88/NF-&#954;B) and fibrotic pathway (TGF-ß/smads) were detected by western blot and qPCR. RESULTS: The results showed that hepatic histopathological injury, abnormal liver function, fibrosis and inflammation induced by CCl4 were improved by FSE (2.5, 5 g/kg). Immunohistochemistry and western blot results indicated that the expression of &#945;-SMA and COL1 in liver tissue was inhibited by FSE (2.5, 5 g/kg). Western blot and qPCR results further proved that FSE (2.5, 5 g/kg) inhibited the transduction of TLR4/MyD88/NF-&#954;B and TGF-ß/smads signaling pathways. CONCLUSION: FSE can inhibit the expression of inflammatory factors and fibrotic cytokines, reduce liver injury, and inhibit the development of liver fibrosis through TLR4/MyD88/NF-&#954;B and TGF-ß/smads signaling pathways.","Hu, Naihua; Guo, Chaocheng; Dai, Xuyang; Wang, Cheng; Gong, Lihong; Yu, Lingyuan; Peng, Cheng; Li, Yunxia",J Ethnopharmacol,,33

Sturdy observing of the initial site of infection in patients is crucial to gain control in the struggle with COVID-19. The early automated detection of the recent coronavirus disease (COVID-19) will help to limit its dissemination worldwide. Many initial studies have focused on the identification of the genetic material of coronavirus and have a poor detection rate for long-term surgery. The first imaging procedure that played an important role in COVID-19 treatment was the chest X-ray. Radiological imaging is often used as a method that emphasizes the performance of chest X-rays. Recent findings indicate the presence of COVID-19 in patients with irregular findings on chest X-rays. There are many reports on this topic that include machine learning strategies for the identification of COVID-19 using chest X-rays. Other current studies have used non-public datasets and complex artificial intelligence (AI) systems. In our research, we suggested a new COVID-19 identification technique based on the locality-weighted learning and self-organization map (LWL-SOM) strategy for detecting and capturing COVID-19 cases. We first grouped images from chest X-ray datasets based on their similar features in different clusters using the SOM strategy in order to discriminate between the COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 cases. Then, we built our intelligent learning model based on the LWL algorithm to diagnose and detect COVID-19 cases. The proposed SOM-LWL model improved the correlation coefficient performance results between the Covid19, no-finding, and pneumonia cases; pneumonia and no-finding cases; Covid19 and pneumonia cases; and Covid19 and no-finding cases from 0.9613 to 0.9788, 0.6113 to 1 0.8783 to 0.9999, and 0.8894 to 1, respectively.

408070,Composition and Configuration Patterns in Multiple-View Visualizations,2020-07-30,"SARS-CoV-2 infections elicit both humoral and cellular immune responses. For the prevention and treatment of COVID19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, it has become increasingly apparent that T cell responses are equally, if not more important than humoral responses in mediating recovery and immune-protection. One of the major challenges in developing T cell-based therapies for infectious and malignant diseases has been the identification of immunogenic epitopes that can elicit a meaningful T cell response. Traditionally, this has been achieved using sophisticated in silico methods to predict putative epitopes deduced from binding affinities and consensus data. Our studies find that, in contrast to current dogma, immunodominant SARS-CoV-2 peptides defined by such in silico methods often fail to elicit T cell responses recognizing naturally presented SARS-CoV-2 epitopes.","Pan, Ke; Chiu, Yulun; Chen, Michelle; Wang, Junmei; Lai, Ivy; Singh, Shailbala; Shaw, Rebecca Marie; Yee, Cassian",,,33

Elective medical procedures, including routine office visits, were restricted raising concerns regarding opioid and benzodiazepine provider and prescription availability. Objective: To examine how the cancelation of elective medical procedures due to COVID-19 impacted the dispensing of opioid and benzodiazepine prescriptions in Texas. Methods: Interrupted time series analyses were preformed to examine changes in prescription trends for opioids and benzodiazepines before and after the restriction on elective medical procedures. Samples of patients who filled an opioid or benzodiazepine prescription from January 5, 2020 to May 12, 2020 were identified from the Texas Prescription Monitoring Program. Elective medical procedures were restricted starting March 23, 2020 indicating the beginning of the intervention period. Results: Restricting elective procedures was associated with a significant decrease in the number of patients (β = −6029, 95%CI = −8810.40, −3246.72) and prescribers (β = −2784, 95%CI = −3671.09, −1896.19) filling and writing opioid prescriptions, respectively. Also, the number of patients filling benzodiazepine prescriptions decreased significantly (β = −1982, 95%CI = −3712.43, −252.14) as did the number of prescribers (β = −708.62, 95%CI = −1190.54, −226.71).

Well-validated multiplex immunoassays are scarce. Here, we evaluated the performance of an 11-plex serological assay capable of detecting antibodies directed to four antigenic targets of SARS-CoV-2 and to S1 proteins of other human pathogenic coronaviruses. We used 620 well-characterized sera (n = 458 seropositive and n = 110 seronegative for SARS-CoV-2 in the pre-SARS-CoV-2 era and n = 52 seronegative for SARS-CoV-2 in the era of SARS-CoV-2) as positive and negative standards. We calculated the sensitivity, specificity, as well as positive and negative predictive values, including a 95% confidence interval. The difference in mean fluorescence intensity (95% CI) was used to assess a potential cross-reaction between antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and the other coronaviruses. The sensitivity (95% CI) of detecting anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies to four antigenic targets ranged from 83.4% (76.7–86.7) to 93.7% (91.0–95.7) and the specificity from 98.2% (93.6–99.8) to 100% (96.7–100). We observed no obvious cross-reaction between anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and antibodies to the other coronaviruses except for SARS-CoV-1. The high sensitivity and specificity warrant a reliable utilization of the assay in population-based seroprevalence surveys or vaccine efficacy studies.","Borena, Wegene Kimpel Janine Gierer Melanie Rössler Annika Riepler Lydia Oehler Susanne von Laer Dorothee Miholits Markus",Vaccines,,33

More recently, these higher rates have been attributed to underlying social, structural, and environmental determinants of health including resource inequities, inadequate housing, and occupational and environmental hazards that result in greater exposure to and less protection from COVID-19. 5,6 Augmented by the added physiologic stress of pregnancy, these comorbidities and disparities compound the risk of pregnancy-associated cardiomyopathy, thromboembolism, and hemorrhage, often resulting in lasting physical and mental health consequences.","Stratton, Pamela; Gorodetsky, Elena; Clayton, Janine",J. natl. med. assoc,,33

Whereas these devices provide excellent protection of the user, there is an added element of risk during doffing and cleaning of the device. An additional layer of barrier protection, in the form of a polypropylene gown, to be worn over the hood and motor belt, can be used to minimise this risk. However, the device entrains air perpendicular to the lie of the gown, resulting in the impermeable material being sucked into the air intake, and partial occlusion of flow. In this report, we describe a clinical-academic partnership whereby a bespoke filter guard was designed to disrupt airflow and prevent gown entrainment, thereby enabling full barrier protection of both the device and user. This intervention was simple, cheap, scalable and able to be mass produced.","Miles, L F; Chuen, J; Edwards, L; Hohmann, J D; Williams, R; Peyton, P; Grayden, D B",Anaesth Rep,,33

413666,On the optimal control of coronavirus (2019-nCov) mathematical model;a numerical approach,2020,"Background and aims: Over the past year, millions of people around the world have infected with the COVID-19 virus The SARS-CoV-2 replicates efficiently in the human upper respiratory tract Infected people produce large amounts of the virus in their upper respiratory tract during an introductory period, which leads to more spread of the virus to other people The World Health Organization (WHO) has suggested that acute respiratory syndrome SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted through person-to-person transmission and contact with contaminated surfaces However, the rapid spread of the disease suggests that other routes, such as airborne transmission, may play a role Several research studies have been performed to evaluate the possible transmission of the virus through the air Although some studies have found no evidence of airborne transmission, recent work has confirmed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 even in public places Experience and knowledge of the mechanism of similar viruses such as SARS-CoV also support this hypothesis During COVID-19 pandemic, while the hospitals can be one of the most important centers in providing health care services, due to the inappropriate air ventilation and purification system, high traffic of people;some of them have been introduced themselves as one of the most high-risk sources of SARS-CoV-2 transmission The present study aimed to assess the SARS-CoV-2 in the air and surfaces of ICU ward in one of the designated hospitals in Tehran So that, in addition to determining the possibility of inhalation and contact exposure in ICU, which is the main ward for presenting special medical care to patients with severe acute respiratory infections, it aimed to assess a hypothesis of SARS-CoV-2 airborne transmission Methods: This cross-sectional experimental study was performed on April 29, 2020 in the Covid-19 ICU ward in one of the designated hospitals, Tehran, Iran The area of ward was 50 m2 and has seven beds, all of which were occupied at the time of sampling, and five medical staff were involving there All patients were equipped with oxygen masks and all the staff used all conventional personal protective equipment such as Honeywell-75FFP100NL respirators On average, surface disinfection was performed three times a day The general ventilation system included the ceiling diffuser to supply fresh air into the room and wall-mounted exhaust vent and did not use natural ventilation (such as opening the window) It should be noted that the exhaust system did not work well at the time of sampling This study was carried out in two phases including surface and air sampling Impinger method was applied to air sampling Thus, at a distance of 1 5 to 1 8 meters from the ground, the air of the ICU ward was passed through a sampling pump with an flow rate of 1 5 l/min into the porous midget impeller-30 ml containing 15 ml of virus transmission medium (PVTM) for 45 minutes To reverse the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in air samples, the reverse polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) reaction method was used Sampling of surfaces was done with the help of swabs impregnated with the solution of the Viral Transport Medium from a certain area (25 cm2) from the desired part and putting it inside the vial containing the transfer medium (protein stabilizer, antibiotic and buffer solution) They are also were analyzed by RT-PCR technique Prior to sampling, all laboratory equipment used was sterilized and autoclaved using a 70% alcohol solution according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) protocol The air sampling was done at a distance of 1 5 to 2 meters from the patient's bed The devices used to measure temperature, humidity and air velocity were multi-purpose anemometer (China BENETE, GM8910,) and air pressure, digital barometer (AIRFLOW, DB2, USA) The mean parameters of weather conditions included: air temperature 24 ° C, humidity 35%, air pressure 1005 mb and air velocity of 0 09 m / s Results: Of the ten air samples, 6 were positive (60%), with the highest RNA concentrations observed at the point between beds 6 and 7 (3913 copies per ml) Most of the reported negative air samples were from the middle of the ward, which was further away from the patients' beds The mean RNA concentration of the virus was obtained 820 ± 2601 copies per milliliter In addition, of ten samples taken from different surfaces of the ward, 4 samples were positive (40%) and the highest concentration (8318 copies per ml) was related to the table next to bed number 3 All positive samples were observed close to the patient's bed, and the mean RNA concentration of the virus was 3227 ± 3674 copies per milliliter Conclusion: The results of the study indicated that the virus was present in the inhaled air of the ward and its surfaces, especially in areas close to the bed of patients These findings underscore the airborne transmission of the virus along with other ways of transmission, such as person-to-person contact and contact with contaminated surfaces Due to the environmental pollution of the studied ICU ward to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the effective implementation of air isolation methods such as the use of respiratory protection equipment (N95 mask) and powered air-purifying respirator as well as ensuring the correct function of hospital ventilation systems and improving it, is essential for the protection of health care staff Health care workers need to be continuously monitored and screened from a COVID-19 perspective, and infection prevention and control protocols (IPCs), such as respiratory protection, regular cleaning of the environment, and effective disinfection of areas have been implemented In the case of the virus, the spread of the disease through both direct methods (drops and person-to-person) as well as indirect contact (contaminated objects and airborne transmission) has almost been proven, which reaffirms the need for precautionary measures regarding airborne isolation against the virus It has been suggested that in order to more accurately assess the transmission behavior of the virus, similar studies but longitudinal ones have been done from the admission to discharge of the patients in different wards of the hospitals Moreover, the role of

We have developed an epidemic progression model involving the susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered dynamics, the age-stratified disease transmissibility, and the possible large-scale undocumented (i.e., asymptomatic and/or untested) transmission of COVID-19 taking place in the USA. Our analysis utilizes COVID-19 observational data in the USA between March 19 and 28, corresponding to the early stage of the epidemic when the impacts of social distancing on disease progression were yet to manifest. Calibrating our model using epidemiological data from this time period enabled us to unbiasedly address the question ""How long and with what intensity does the USA need to implement social distancing intervention during the COVID-19 pandemic?"" For a short (i.e., up to two weeks) duration, we find a near-linear decrease in hospital beds demand with increasing intensity (&#966;) of social distancing. For a duration longer than two weeks, our findings highlight the diminishing marginal benefit of social distancing, characterized by a linear decrease in medical demands against an exponentially increasing social distancing duration. Long-term implementation of strict social distancing with &#966;>50% could lead to the emergence of a second wave of infections due to a large residual susceptible population which highlights the need for contact tracing and isolation before re-opening of the economy. Finally, we investigate the scenario of intermittent social distancing and find an optimal social-to-no-distancing duration ratio of 5:1 corresponding to a sustainable reduction in medical demands.","Liu, Pai; Beeler, Payton; Chakrabarty, Rajan K",Chaos,,33

422245,Effects of SGLT2 Inhibitors on Kidney and Cardiovascular Function,2020,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the associations of serum markers for systemic inflammation, liver, mineral, and energy status, and blood neutrophil counts with the function of circulating neutrophils in postpartum dairy cows. Blood samples were collected from 21 healthy Holstein cows at 5, 10, 14, and 21 d postpartum. Serum samples were used to measure concentrations of total calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, total protein, albumin, globulin, cholesterol, urea, glucose, gamma-glutamyl transferase, aspartate aminotransferase, glutamate dehydrogenase, haptoglobin (Hp), ß-hydroxybutyrate, non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA), and insulin-like growth factor-1. The shift of percentage of activated neutrophils for phagocytosis (PPC) and oxidative burst (POB) and the median fluorescence intensity (MFI) for PC (MFIPC), OB (MFIOB), and endocytic and proteolytic degradation measured via DQ-ovalbumin (MFIDQ) were evaluated using flow cytometry. Mixed linear regression models were used to assess the associations of serum concentrations of metabolites and blood neutrophil counts with each neutrophil function assay outcome accounting for d postpartum, parity, and body condition score. Pearson correlation tests (r) were used to describe the relationships of metabolites and neutrophil counts with neutrophil function assays that were significant in the regression models. Greater serum concentrations of Hp were associated with lesser OB function (POB and MFIOB; r = -0.2 for both), but greater PPC and MFIDQ (r = 0.3 for both). Greater serum NEFA and cholesterol were associated with lesser (r = -0.3) and greater (r = 0.2) POB function, respectively. Blood neutrophil counts were associated with PPC (r = -0.2) and MFIDQ (r = -0.3). At 5 d postpartum, greater serum total protein was associated with greater OB function (POB and MFIOB; r = 0.4 for both). Other markers were not associated with neutrophil function. Some metabolic and inflammatory markers in healthy postpartum dairy cows were associated with circulating neutrophil function. However, these associations only explained a small proportion of the variance in neutrophil function. Serum Hp concentration was most associated with neutrophil function changes but had opposite directions of association with OB- and PC-related functions. Future studies should focus on understanding the mechanisms by which Hp and other metabolic indicators affect neutrophil function in healthy and diseased postpartum dairy cows.","Bogado Pascottini, O; Bruinjé, T C; Couto Serrenho, R; Mion, B; LeBlanc, S J",Vet Immunol Immunopathol,,33
422460,The other side of life,2020,"The outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-related disease (coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19]) has spread rapidly to a pandemic proportion, increasing the demands on health systems for the containment and management of COVID-19. Cancer has been reported as a major risk factor for adverse outcomes of and death from COVID-19. We extracted data from the World Health Organization's progress reports and from the Italian Council of Medicine. In addition, we retrieved clinical data on patients with cancer and with confirmed COVID-19 in our institution. As of 2nd April 2020, 110,574 COVID-19 cases and 13,157 deaths have been reported in Italy, representing a global share of 5.1% and 28.9% for incidence and mortality, respectively. In Italy, we report the analysis of the Italian Medical Council on 909 patients who died from COVID-19; of whom, 16.5% were patients with cancer. The population was enriched with subjects with multiple comorbid non-communicable diseases, with less than 1% of the population presenting no comorbid conditions. At the patient level, we identified nine patients referred to our department in the last two months who were receiving standard-of-care or experimental medications in the curative and palliative settings. The median age was 68 years (range = 42-79 years), and patients carried a median of one comorbid condition (0-2); two of nine patients presented with severe COVID-19 and were receiving inpatient care. None of the patients receiving immunotherapy experienced severe adverse outcomes, and four patients were discharged with complete reversal of the clinical syndrome and SARS-CoV-2 clearance. Learning from the experience of countries with a high burden, efforts must be made to assure the access of patients with cancer to treatments, prioritising the cancer health interventions based on their intrinsic value and limiting the exposure to an unacceptable risk of infection for both health providers and patients. Any significant work in the design and implementation of health system actions, including clinical care, must be framed as an initiative under the global response agenda and through a community approach, with the intention of pursuing common goals to tackle COVID-19 and cancer, as 'One Community' working for 'One Health's.","Trapani, Dario; Marra, Antonio; Curigliano, Giuseppe",Eur J Cancer,,33
422535,What's in a name? Issues to consider when naming Mendelian disorders,2020,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus (SARS-COV-2) is now a global concern because of its higher transmission capacity and associated adverse consequences including death. The reproductive number of coronavirus provides an estimate of the possible extent of the transmission. This study aims to provide a summary reproductive number of coronavirus based on available global level evidence. METHODS: A total of three databases were searched on September 15, 2020: PubMed, Web of Science, and Science Direct. The searches were conducted using a pre-specified search strategy to record studies reported the reproductive number of coronavirus from its inception in December 2019. It includes keywords of coronavirus and its reproductive number, which were combined using the Boolean operators (AND, OR). Based on the included studies, we estimated a summary reproductive number by using the meta-analysis. We used narrative synthesis to explain the results of the studies where the reproductive number was reported, however, were not possible to include in the meta-analysis because of the lack of data (mostly due to confidence interval was not reported). RESULTS: Total of 42 studies included in this review whereas 29 of them were included in the meta-analysis. The estimated summary reproductive number was 2.87 (95% CI, 2.39-3.44). We found evidence of very high heterogeneity (99.5%) of the reproductive number reported in the included studies. Our sub-group analysis was found the significant variations of reproductive number across the country for which it was estimated, method and model that were used to estimate the reproductive number, number of case that was considered to estimate the reproductive number, and the type of reproductive number that was estimated. The highest reproductive number was reported for the Diamond Princess Cruise Ship in Japan (14.8). In the country-level, the higher reproductive number was reported for France (R, 6.32, 95% CI, 5.72-6.99) following Germany (R, 6.07, 95% CI, 5.51-6.69) and Spain (R, 3.56, 95% CI, 1.62-7.82). The higher reproductive number was reported if it was estimated by using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method (MCMC) method and the Epidemic curve model. We also reported significant heterogeneity of the type of reproductive number- a high-value reported if it was the time-dependent reproductive number. CONCLUSION: The estimated summary reproductive number indicates an exponential increase of coronavirus infection in the coming days. Comprehensive policies and programs are important to reduce new infections as well as the associated adverse consequences including death.","Billah, Md Arif; Miah, Md Mamun; Khan, Md Nuruzzaman",PLoS One,,33

The decline in sales provokes intra-organizational and inter-organizational tension, requiring a new approach for managing firms' business operations. Particularly, the direct threat to human beings places the attention of managers on the individual. This study investigates the main differences between prior “traditional” financial-based crises and the practices that managers can adopt to navigate and survive the Coronavirus crisis from a social exchange theory (SET) view. The authors identify eight crisis-comparative dimensions to consider to successfully prevail: (1) formation, (2) focus, (3) temporality, (4) government jurisdiction, (5) preparedness, (6) normality, (7) business, and (8) operational deployment. In addition, the study results propose four intertwined areas to classify the managerial practices: (1) digital transformation, (2) decision-making processes, (3) leadership, and (4) emotions and stress.","Mora Cortez, Roberto; Johnston, Wesley J.",Ind.

426605,"Soil Pathogens that may Potentially Cause Pandemics, Including SARS Coronaviruses",2020,"INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 presentation may include a profound increase in cytokines and associated pneumonia, rapidly progressing to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). This so-called cytokine storm often leads to refractory edema, respiratory arrest, and death. At present, anti-IL-6, antiviral therapy, convalescent plasma, hydroxychloroquine, and azithromycin among others are being investigated as potential treatments for COVID-19. As the disease etiology and precise therapeutic interventions are still not definitively defined, we wanted to review the roles that complement and the contact system may have in either the treatment or pathogenesis of the disease. METHODS: We searched the recent literature (PubMed) on complement and coronavirus; contact system and coronavirus; bradykinin and coronavirus; and angiotensin receptor and coronavirus. The manuscript complies with ethics guidelines and was deemed exempt from institutional review board approval according to Human Subjects Protection Office guidelines. RESULTS: Mouse models are available for the study of coronavirus and complement. Although complement is effective in protecting against many viruses, it does not seem to be protective against coronavirus. C3 knockout mice infected with SARS-CoV had less lung disease than wild-type mice, suggesting that complement may play a role in coronavirus pathogenesis. Some evidence suggests that the observed pulmonary edema may be bradykinin-induced and could be the reason that corticosteroids, antihistamines, and other traditional interventions for edema are not effective. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a co-receptor for SARS-CoV-2, and studies thus far have not concluded a benefit or risk associated with the use of either ACE-inhibitors or angiotensin receptor antagonists. Activation of complement and the contact system, through generation of bradykinin, may play a role in the SARS-CoV-2-induced pulmonary edema, and our search suggests that further work is necessary to confirm our suspicions.","Maglakelidze, Natella; Manto, Kristen M; Craig, Timothy J",Pulm Ther,,33
426780,Using contact data to model the impact of contact tracing and physical distancing to control the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Kenya [version 1;peer review: awaiting peer review],2020,"OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to compare the changes of the condylar axis, the anteroposterior condylar position relative to the glenoid fossa, after intraoral vertical ramus osteotomy (IVRO). Study design 21 patients diagnosed as skeletal class III malocclusion underwent IVRO and were followed according to the authors' postoperative management regimen. The three-dimensional positions of the condyles were evaluated by cone-beam computerized tomography (CBCT) at pre-op, post-op, and at follow-up. CBCT images were referenced to assess the condylar axis change and the anteroposterior condylar position in the glenoid fossa. A repeated-measures analysis of variance (P<0.05) also was performed. RESULTS: After surgery, both the axial condylar angles and the anteroposterior condylar position were significantly different (P<0.05). The coronal condylar axis rotated outwardly. The anteroposterior condylar position in the glenoid fossa had moved from the concentric to the anterior position. But the condyle changes between post-op and follow-up (P>0.05) were insignificant. CONCLUSIONS: With postoperative intermaxillary elastic traction, the condyles changed their positions physiologically for newly established jaw movement after IVRO.","Huang, Luo; Tang, Shan; Zou, Rui; Ouyang, Kexiong; Piao, Zhengguo",J.

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate the diagnostic value of chest computed tomography (CT) in RT-PCR-negative patients with suspected COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included patients who were admitted to our hospital with the suspicion of COVID-19 between 1 April 2020 and 30 April 2020 and tested negative after RT-PCR test, and underwent CT for further diagnosis. Initial CT findings were classified as typical, indeterminate, and atypical for COVID-19, and negative for pneumonia. Incidental findings on CT were noted. RESULTS: Of the 338 patients with a mean age of 57 years (min 18 years-max 96 years), 168 (49.70%) were male and 170 (50.29%) were female. The most common symptoms were cough (58.87%), fever (40.82%), and dyspnea (39.34%). The CT findings were typical for COVID-19 in 109 (32.24%) patients, indeterminate in 47 (13.90%) patients, and atypical in 77 (22.78%) patients. The CT findings of 105 (31.06%) patients were negative for pneumonia. Incidental lung nodules suspicious of malignancy were identified in seven patients. Seventy-seven patients (22.78%) had extrapulmonary incidental findings CONCLUSION: The diagnostic value of CT in RT-PCR-negative patients with suspected COVID-19 is not very high.

We retrospectively identified patients admitted to our Emergency Room from March 8th to May 4th 2020 (time frame corresponding to the first wave of the pandemic peak, one of the most severe in the world at that time) with a diagnosis of fracture that were subsequently surgically treated. We applied a dedicated pathway for the management of COVID-19 trauma patients allowed to perform an early surgery and short hospitalization. For each patient included demographics, clinical, laboratory, radiological data and type of treatment for COVID-19 infection were collected. Sixty-five (65) patients were identified. Of those, 17 (6 women and 11 men, mean age 63.41 years old, mean ASA grade 2.35) were COVID-19 positive (study group), while the others were control group (mean age 56.58 years old, mean ASA grade 2.21). In the study group, the preoperative laboratory tests showed leukocytosis in six and lymphopenia in 15 cases. Fourteen patients had a high level of C-reactive protein.

Editors and publishers compete for impact factor rankings, to demonstrate how important their journals are, and researchers strive to publish in perceived top journals, despite high publication and access charges. This raises questions of how top journals are identified, whether assessments of impacts are accurate and whether high publication charges borne by the research community are justified, bearing in mind that they also collectively provide free peer-review to the publishers. Although traditional journals accelerated peer review and publication during the COVID-19 pandemic, preprint servers made a greater impact with over 30,000 open access articles becoming available and accelerating a trend already seen in other fields of research. We review and comment on the advantages and disadvantages of a range of assessment methods and the way in which they are used by researchers, managers, employers and publishers.

In the early 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared it as a global health emergency without definitive treatments and preventive approaches. In the absence of definitive therapeutic agents, this thorough review summarizes and outlines the potency and safety of all molecules and therapeutics which may have potential antiviral effects. A number of molecules and therapeutics licensed or being tested for some other conditions were found effective in different in vitro studies as well as in many small sample-sized clinical trials and independent case studies. However, in those clinical trials, there were some limitations which need to be overcome to find the most promising antiviral against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In conclusion, many of above-mentioned antivirals seems to have some therapeutic effects but none of them have been shown to have a strong evidence for their proper recommendation and approval in the treatment of COVID-19. Constantly evolving new evidences, exclusive adult data, language barrier, and type of study (observational, retrospective, small-sized clinical trials, or independent case series) resulted to the several limitations of this review.

Descriptive statistics and explanatory multivariable Cox regression modeling with clinical parameters as time-varying covariates were used to identify risk factors of severe AKI. Results: Severe AKI developed in 70 of 223 patients (31%) with COVID-19, of which 95.7% required kidney replacement therapy. Patients with severe AKI were older, predominantly male, had more comorbidities, and displayed excess mortality. Severe AKI occurred exclusively in intensive care unit patients, and 97.3% of the patients developing severe AKI had respiratory failure. Mechanical ventilation, vasopressor therapy, and inflammatory markers (serum procalcitonin levels and leucocyte count) were independent time-varying risk factors of severe AKI. Increasing inflammatory markers displayed a close temporal association with the development of severe AKI. Sensitivity analysis on risk factors of AKI stage 2 and 3 combined confirmed these findings. Conclusion: Severe AKI in COVID-19 was tightly coupled with critical illness and systemic inflammation and was not observed in milder disease courses. These findings suggest that traditional systemic AKI mechanisms rather than kidney-specific processes contribute to severe AKI in COVID-19.","Hardenberg, Jan-Hendrik B; Stockmann, Helena; Aigner, Annette; Gotthardt, Inka; Enghard, Philipp; Hinze, Christian; Balzer, Felix; Schmidt, Danilo; Zickler, Daniel; Kruse, Jan; Körner, Roland; Stegemann, Miriam; Schneider, Thomas; Schumann, Michael; Müller-Redetzky, Holger; Angermair, Stefan; Budde, Klemens; Weber-Carstens, Steffen; Witzenrath, Martin; Treskatsch, Sascha; Siegmund, Britta; Spies, Claudia; Suttorp, Norbert; Rauch, Geraldine; Eckardt, Kai-Uwe; Schmidt-Ott, Kai M",,,33

435904,The role of fear in modern societies: Our ancient fear response to new situations is not always helpful in a civilised society,2020,"Robotic teleoperation is a key technology for a wide variety of applications. It allows sending robots instead of humans in remote, possibly dangerous locations while still using the human brain with its enormous knowledge and creativity, especially for solving unexpected problems. A main challenge in teleoperation consists of providing enough feedback to the human operator for situation awareness and thus create full immersion, as well as offering the operator suitable control interfaces to achieve efficient and robust task fulfillment. We present a bimanual telemanipulation system consisting of an anthropomorphic avatar robot and an operator station providing force and haptic feedback to the human operator. The avatar arms are controlled in Cartesian space with a 1:1 mapping of the operator movements. The measured forces and torques on the avatar side are haptically displayed directly to the operator. We developed a predictive avatar model for limit avoidance which runs on the operator side, ensuring low latency. Only off-the-shelf components were used to build the system. It is evaluated in lab experiments and by untrained operators in a small user study.","Lenz, Christian; Behnke, Sven",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.13382v1.pdf,33

A potentially high-risk group for PIU are those with symptoms of attention deficit and hyperactivity (ADHD symptoms), because of restrictions in their physical activity levels and engagement in computer diversions requiring only short attention spans. METHODS: We used convenience sampling in a cross-sectional survey of university students from 30 universities in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. We assessed PIU using the Internet Addiction Test and ADHD symptoms using the WHO Adult ADHD Self-Report Screening Scale. Using logistic regression and linear regression analyses we adjusted for demographic, epidemic-related and psychological covariates in models of the association between ADHD symptoms and PIU. RESULTS: Among 11,254 participants, we found a 28.4% (95% CI, 27.5%-29.2%) prevalence of PIU, relatively higher than before the pandemic. In our final logistic regression model, participants with ADHD symptoms had approximately two times the risk for PIU (OR: 2.31, 95% CI: 1.89-2.83). Similarly, individuals with depression, anxiety, insomnia, PTSD symptoms and feeling stress during the pandemic had a higher risk of PIU, while those exercising regularly during the pandemic had a lower risk. LIMITATIONS: The cross-sectional design and reliance on internet based self-reports for ADHD symptoms and PIU assessments, without direct structured interviews for validation, are limitations. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of PIU was high during COVID-19, and those people with ADHD symptoms and other mental illness symptoms appear to be at higher risk of PIU. Regular exercise may reduce that PIU risk and hence should be recommended during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Zhao, Yimiao; Jiang, Zhendong; Guo, Suihuai; Wu, Ping; Lu, Qingdong; Xu, Yingying; Liu, Lin; Su, Sizhen; Shi, Le; Que, Jianyu; Sun, Yan; Sun, Yankun; Deng, Jiahui; Meng, Shiqiu; Yan, Wei; Yuan, Kai; Sun, Siwei; Yang, Li; Ran, Maosheng; Kosten, Thomas R; Strang, John; Lu, Yu; Huang, Guofu; Lu, Lin; Bao, Yanping; Shi, Jie",J Affect Disord,,33

After inputting a handful of readily available variables, the computer program generates a forecast of how long it will take to see the backlog of patients. This information could be used to allow surgical groups to run simulations to explore different resource allocation strategies in order to help prevent downstream consequences of delayed patient care.","Brandman, David M; Leck, Erika; Christie, Sean",Can J Surg,,33

Siddha medicine classifies disease and disorders into 4448 types and has remedy for more than 64 types of fever. Among these Kabasura Kudineer and Thonthasura Kudineer are two siddha formulations used against fevers due to respiratory infections. The present study was carried out to evaluate these two formulations against COVID 19 using in silico docking methods. For that the active principles/phytocompounds from the ingredients of the formulations were docked against coronavirus spike glycoprotein trimmer (PDB ID: 3JCL) using iGEMDOCK software. 10 phytocompounds showed promising activity against COVID spike glycoprotein. This study showed that 10 phytocompounds which act as ligands to bind with viral proteins to prevent the binding of host receptors. Of these Cucurbitacin B (-112.09), Cardiofoliolide (-111.5), Apigenin (-98.84) and Pyrethrin (-92.98) were observed as more effective with less bind energies required for binding with spike proteins to prevent the fusion lead viral replication.

We evaluated that optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) measurement, which can reflect intracranial pressure, may be a criterion for decision of endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) success. METHODS: 28 adult patients suffering long overt standing ventriculomegaly (LOVA) who performed ETV were included in this retrospective study. The patients were divided into two groups as successful (group A) and failed ETV group (group B) according to their postoperative evaluation. ONSD was measured on pre- and post-operative computed tomography (CT) and Evan's index (EI), diameter of third ventricule (V3), the patency of ETV stoma and periventricular edema were evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). RESULTS: The mean ONSD was measured as 6.39±0.92mm for the right eye, 6.50±0.91mm for the left eye on preoperative CT. The mean ONSD by CT (after surgery) was 4.89±0.87mm for the right eye, 5.02±0.1mm for the left eye (p<0.05). Postoperative group A and group B were compared according to ONSD measurement; mean ONSD in group A was 4.52±0.69mm for the right and 4.59±0.9mm for the left, mean ONSD in group B was 5.82±0.51mm for the right and 6.1±0.32mm for the left (p<0.05). The best ONSD value for detecting failed ETV was 5.40mm (sensitivity 90%, specifity 75%, AUROC 0.938) for right and 5.91mm (sensitivity 90%, specifity 75%, AUROC 0.950) for left. EE was measured as 0.39±0.12mm on preoperative MRI and 0.39±0.12mm on postoperative MRI (p=0.3). V3 was measured as 14.7±2.47mm on preoperative MRI and 10.47±1.99mm on postoperative MRI (p<0.05).

Although continuous renal replacement therapy is the standard of care for critically ill patients, prolonged intermittent renal replacement therapy (PIRRT) may be a feasible option. We aimed to describe the tolerability and security of PIRRT treatments in COVID-19 patients with ARDS who required mechanical ventilation and developed severe AKI. METHODS: We prospectively analyzed patients who underwent PIRRT treatments at a COVID-19 reference hospital in Mexico City. Intradialytic hypotension was defined as a systolic blood pressure decrease of &#8805;20 mm Hg or an increase of 100% in vasopressor dose. RESULTS: We identified 136 AKI cases (60.7%) in 224 patients admitted to the intensive care unit. Among them, 21 (15%) underwent PIRRT (130 sessions) due to stage 3 AKI. The median age of the cohort was 49 (range 36-73) years, 17 (81%) were male, 7 (33%) had diabetes, and the median time between symptoms onset and PIRRT initiation was 12 (interquartile range [IQR] 7-14) days. The median of PIRRT procedures for each patient was 5 (IQR 4-9) sessions. In 108 (83%) PIRRT sessions, the total ultrafiltration goal was achieved. In 84 (65%) PIRRT procedures, there was a median increase in norepinephrine dose of +0.031 mcg/kg/min during PIRRT (IQR 0.00 to +0.07). Intradialytic hypotensive events occurred in 56 (43%) procedures. Fifteen (12%) PIRRT treatments were discontinued due to severe hypotension. Vasopressor treatment at PIRRT session onset (OR 6.2, 95% CI 1.4-28.0, p: 0.02) and a pre-PIRRT lactate &#8805;3.0 mmol/L (OR 4.63, 95% CI 1.3-12.8, p: 0.003) were independently and significantly associated with the risk of hypotension during PIRRT. During follow-up, 11 patients (52%) recovered from AKI and respiratory failure and 9 (43%) died. Several adaptations to our PIRRT protocol during the COVID-19 outbreak are presented. CONCLUSIONS: PIRRT was feasible in the majority of COVID-19 patients with ARDS and severe AKI, despite frequent transitory intradialytic hypotensive episodes. PIRRT may represent an acceptable alternative of renal replacement therapy during the COVID-19 outbreak.","Ramirez-Sandoval, Juan C; Gaytan-Arocha, Jorge E; Xolalpa-Chávez, Pedro; Mejia-Vilet, Juan M; Arvizu-Hernandez, Mauricio; Rivero-Sigarroa, Eduardo; Torruco-Sotelo, Carlos; Correa-Rotter, Ricardo; Vega-Vega, Olynka",Blood Purif,,33

458853,Highlights from this issue,2021,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most lethal cancers worldwide due to a high rate of tumour metastasis and disease recurrence. In physiological conditions, tetraspanins interact with specific partner proteins in tetraspanin-enriched microdomains and regulate their subcellular localizations and function. However, the function of Tspan5 in pathological processes, particularly in cancer biology, and its clinical significance are still unclear. Here, we describe that a high expression of Tspan5 is significantly associated with some clinicopathological features including invasive length, vascular invasion, clinical stage and poor overall survival of HCC patients. Alterations of Tspan5 expression by lentivirus transductions in HCC cells demonstrated that Tspan5 promotes wound healing and cell migration in vitro and tumour metastasis of HCC cells in vivo. Mechanistic studies revealed that Tspan5 promoted cell migration and tumour metastasis by increasing the enzymatic maturation of ADAM10 and activating Notch signalling via the increase of the cleavage of the Notch1 receptor catalysed by the Î³-secretase complex. Activation of Notch signalling by Tspan5 was shown to further enhance the epithelial-mesenchymal transition and actin skeleton rearrangement of tumour cells. In clinical HCC samples, Tspan5 expression is strongly correlated with many key molecules acting in Notch signalling and EMT, highlighting the role of Tspan5 in the regulation of Notch signalling, EMT and tumour metastasis of HCC. Our findings provide new insights on the mechanism of tumour metastasis and disease progression of HCC and may facilitate the development of novel clinical intervention strategies against HCC.","Xie, Qian; Guo, Huiling; He, Peirong; Deng, Huan; Gao, Yanjun; Dong, Ningning; Niu, Wenbo; Liu, Tiancai; Li, Ming; Wang, Suihai; Wu, Yingsong; Li, Ji-Liang",Molecular oncology (Online),,33

RESEARCH QUESTION: Among adult volunteers, do either cloth masks or surgical masks impair oxygenation or ventilation either at rest or during physical activity? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: With IRB approval and informed consent, we measured heart rate (HR), transcutaneous carbon dioxide (CO2) tension and oxygen levels (SpO2) at the conclusion of six 10-minute phases: sitting quietly and walking briskly without a mask, sitting quietly and walking briskly while wearing a cloth mask, and sitting quietly and walking briskly while wearing a surgical mask. Brisk walking required at least a 10bpm increase in heart rate. Occurrences of hypoxemia (decrease in SpO2 of &#8805;3% from baseline to a value of &#8804;94%) and hypercarbia (increase in CO2 tension of &#8805;5 mmHg from baseline to a value of &#8805;46 mmHg) in individual subjects were collected. Wilcoxon signed-rank was used for pairwise comparisons among values for the whole cohort (e.g. walking without a mask versus walking with a cloth mask). RESULTS: Among 50 adult volunteers (median age 33 years; 32% with a co-morbidity), there were no episodes of hypoxemia or hypercarbia (0%; 95% confidence interval 0-1.9%). In paired comparisons, there were no statistically significant differences in either CO2 or SpO2 between baseline measurements without a mask and those while wearing either kind of mask mask, both at rest and after walking briskly for ten minutes. INTERPRETATION: The risk of pathologic gas exchange impairment with cloth masks and surgical masks is near-zero in the general adult population.","Shein, Steven L; Whitticar, Sofie; Mascho, Kira K; Pace, Elizabeth; Speicher, Richard; Deakins, Kathleen",PLoS One,,33
460435,"Past, present, and future of COVID-19: a review",2020,"This article brings together two ostensibly separate subjects: language empowerment and the Covid-19 pandemic. It argues that knowledge of local languages can help disseminate health-related information on a regional level. This addresses two problems simultaneously: the problems raised by the intelligibilty of governmental healthcare protocols and the functions of the use of local languages. The article is a case study presenting a number of interventions in the languages of East Kalimantan and can be seen as an inclusive, grassroots example of health communication. The study was initially a modest attempt to generate on-the-ground examples of health information in the dominant languages of the region of East Kalimantan. These studies demonstrate that the local communities of these languages are very enthusiastic about getting involved in the interventions. They also reveal that communication using IT and social media is thriving. One of our observations was that information about this pandemic tends to be understood only by highly educated urban people. This happens because it is conveyed by the government in standard Indonesian, which includes many foreign loanwords. The application of local languages is not just using local language vocabulary, it is instead a trigger to revive the collective memory of disaster management based on local culture. In this case, local languages are recognized and considered useful in helping to break the chain of virus transmission to free Indonesia of the Covid-19 outbreak. There were a number of unexpected developments. We found support for the intervention being rolled out on a national level by Special Task Force for Covid-19 under National Disaster Management Agency (Badan Nasional Penanggulangan Bencana/BNPB). We also welcomed the online publication by the National Agency for Language Development and Cultivation (Badan Bahasa) of the Handbook for managing behavior about health protocols in seventy-seven local languages. The main thrust of this article should therefore be of interest to anyone working to empower local languages and language vitality.","Lauder, A.

Previously, we developed a mathematical model to understand factors governing the effectiveness of traveller screening to prevent spread of emerging pathogens (Gostic et al., 2015). Here, we estimate the impact of different screening programs given current knowledge of key COVID-19 life history and epidemiological parameters. Even under best-case assumptions, we estimate that screening will miss more than half of infected people. Breaking down the factors leading to screening successes and failures, we find that most cases missed by screening are fundamentally undetectable, because they have not yet developed symptoms and are unaware they were exposed. Our work underscores the need for measures to limit transmission by individuals who become ill after being missed by a screening program. These findings can support evidence-based policy to combat the spread of COVID-19, and prospective planning to mitigate future emerging pathogens.","Gostic, Katelyn; Gomez, Ana Cr; Mummah, Riley O; Kucharski, Adam J; Lloyd-Smith, James O",eLife (Cambridge),,33

As a preventive measure, human movement is restricted in most of the world. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), along with the WHO have laid out some therapeutic guidelines for the infected patients. However, other than handwashing and vigilance surrounding commonly encountered oronasal symptoms and fever, no useful prophylactic measure has yet been established. In a pandemic, the accessibility of a prophylactic biologically active substance is crucial. Ideally, it would be something readily available at a low price to a larger percentage of the population with minimal risk. Studies have demonstrated that zinc may reduce viral replication and increase immune responses. For example, in some studies, zinc supplementation used against the influenza virus has been shown to yield clinical benefits with reduced disease burden. While consuming zinc (within the recommended upper safety limits), as a prophylactic might provide an additional shield against the initiation and progression of COVID-19 would need clinical studies, the potential clearly exists.","Razzaque, Mohammed S",,,33

Legal principles concerning a new typology of prescriptions,2021,"AimsPhysical health outcomes are poor for patients with severe mental illness as demonstrated by the significant mortality gap present globally.[1] Access to and engagement with care is a key factor underpinning this disparity.[2] The Early Intervention in Psychosis service works with young people from 14-35 experiencing a first episode of psychosis in the community. Within the service, difficulties in engagement have been reflected in the high ‘no-show’ rates observed in the Foundation Year 2 trainee doctor-led physical health clinic. This quality improvement project aimed to reduce the ‘did not attend’ (DNA) rate in the physical health clinic by 20% in order to improve patient outcomes, particularly in the context of their physical health.MethodThe project took place between September and November 2020, over the course of 10 weeks. A driver diagram was constructed to identify key influencing factors and subsequent change ideas. In order to implement each of these changes, three cycles within the Plan, Do, Study, Act (PDSA) ramp framework were completed. These consisted of phone reminders within 48 hours of appointments, a teaching session for staff alongside the distribution of an accompanying information leaflet and increased flexibility in clinic times with opportunistic appointments. The change ideas were cumulative with each cycle lasting a duration of seventeen days.ResultThe baseline DNA rate was calculated based on the preceding month and found to be 55%. Following cycle one of the project, there was a significant reduction in DNA rates to 30% although this remained relatively stable at 33% after cycle two. By the end of cycle three when all interventions had been introduced, the DNA rate had dropped to 22%. As such, a total drop in DNA rate of over 30% was achieved which surpassed the initial aim of the project.ConclusionThe outcomes of this project demonstrate that the introduction of even simple measures can lead to positive change. Successful implementation of these changes requires teamwork and a culture of openness and flexibility. Feedback from team members, particularly care coordinators, also indicated better resulting engagement of clients with the service overall, suggesting potential for both improved mental and physical health outcomes. Next steps for this project may involve not only continued implementation of established changes but also service user input and scope for virtual consultations particularly in light of current COVID-19 restrictions.","Tansley-Ahmed, Zena Wei Han Lim",BJPsych Open,,33

We find that 27% (23/85) of patients exhibited AKI. The elderly patients and cases with comorbidities (hypertension and heart failure) are more prone to develop AKI. Haematoxylin & eosin staining shows that the kidneys from COVID-19 autopsies have moderate to severe tubular damage. In situ hybridization assays illustrate that viral RNA accumulates in tubules. Immunohistochemistry shows nucleocapsid and spike protein deposits in the tubules, and immunofluorescence double staining shows that both antigens are restricted to the angiotensin converting enzyme-II-positive tubules. SARS-CoV-2 infection triggers the expression of hypoxic damage-associated molecules, including DP2 and prostaglandin D synthase in infected tubules. Moreover, it enhances CD68+ macrophages infiltration into the tubulointerstitium, and complement C5b-9 deposition on tubules is also observed.

The online survey was conducted from June 17 to 29, 2020. Respondents reported the frequency of travel before the pandemic, during the pandemic, and anticipated travel when normal activities resume for walking, bicycling, personal vehicle use, and public transit. Analyses were conducted in July and August 2020. RESULTS: During the pandemic, local travel significantly decreased (-10.36%, 95% CI= -16.26, -4.02) relative to prepandemic levels. Within travel modes, significant decreases were reported for public transit, personal vehicle use, and walking. There was no change in reported bicycle use during the pandemic period relative to prepandemic levels. When normal activities resume, respondents anticipated a significant increase in bicycling (24.54%, 95% CI=3.24, 50.24). Anticipated travel using personal vehicles, public transit, and walking were not significantly different from the prepandemic levels. CONCLUSIONS: Unlike the other local travel modes, bicycling did not decrease during the pandemic and is anticipated to significantly increase.

Recent studies showed that serum from convalescent patients can display variable neutralization capacities. Still, it remains unclear whether there are specific signatures that can be used to predict neutralization. Here, we performed a detailed analysis of sera from a cohort of 101 recovered healthcare workers and we addressed their SARS-CoV-2 antibody response by ELISA against SARS-CoV-2 Spike receptor binding domain and nucleoprotein. Both ELISA methods detected sustained levels of serum IgG against both antigens. Yet, the majority of individuals from our cohort generated antibodies with low neutralization capacity and only 6% showed high neutralizing titers against both authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus and the Spike pseudotyped virus. Interestingly, higher neutralizing sera correlate with detection of -IgG, IgM and IgA antibodies against both antigens, while individuals with positive IgG alone showed poor neutralization response. These results suggest that having a broader repertoire of antibodies may contribute to more potent SARS-CoV-2 neutralization. Altogether, our work provides a cross sectional snapshot of the SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody response in recovered healthcare workers and provides preliminary evidence that possessing multiple antibody isotypes can play an important role in predicting SARS-CoV-2 neutralization.","Noval, Maria G; Kaczmarek, Maria E; Koide, Akiko; Rodriguez-Rodriguez, Bruno A; Louie, Ping; Tada, Takuya; Hattori, Takamitsu; Panchenko, Tatyana; Romero, Larizbeth A; Teng, Kai Wen; Bazley, Andrew; de Vries, Maren; Samanovic, Marie I; Weiser, Jeffrey N; Aifantis, Ioannis; Cangiarella, Joan; Mulligan, Mark J; Desvignes, Ludovic; Dittmann, Meike; Landau, Nathaniel R; Aguero-Rosenfeld, Maria; Koide, Shohei; Stapleford, Kenneth A",Sci Rep,,33

The authors of this article are of the view that one of the factors that help maintain the stability and development of bilateral relations in the current context is public diplomacy. Since the beginning of the twenty-first century, India has invested a huge amount of resources in public diplomacy to leverage India?s soft power. A dedicated public diplomacy division within the Ministry of External Affairs was set up in May 2006, many new schemes were designed to engage domestic and foreign public opinion and a series of high-profile dialogues with foreign think tanks were organised. By utilising both traditional and new approaches of public diplomacy, India is actively seeking new audiences within and outside India. India?s foreign policy-making process has become more open and democratic with the contribution of communities outside New Delhi political and diplomatic elite. New media has also been utilised to reach its various target audiences. Vietnam considers public diplomacy an important pillar of the comprehensive diplomacy of the country. Public diplomacy helps Vietnam succeed in implementing comprehensive and effective foreign policies. It contributes important part in building cooperative, peaceful and friendly relations between Vietnam and international partners. The importance that both India and Vietnam attach to public diplomacy has many implications for strengthening Vietnam?India relations in the current context. This article focuses on India and Vietnam public diplomacy as an instrument of strengthening bilateral relations and thereby proposes suggestions for both sides to enhance cooperation in the future.","Nga, Le Thi Hang Quang Trieu Hong",India Quarterly,,33

479862,UK policy targeting obesity during a pandemic - the right approach?,2020,"Background: Health care workers (HCWs) are at increased risk of acquiring and transmitting COVID-19 infection. Moreover, they present role models for communities with regards to attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccination. Hence, hesitancy of HCWs towards vaccination can crucially affect the efforts aiming to contain the pandemic. Previously published studies paid little attention to HCWs in Arab countries, which have a population of over 440 million. Objectives: To assess the rates of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in Arabic-speaking HCWs residing in and outside Arab countries, and their perceived barriers towards vaccination. Methods: A cross-sectional study based on an online survey was conducted from 14–29 January 2021, targeting Arabic-speaking HCWs from all around the world. Results: The survey recruited 5708 eligible participants (55.6% males, 44.4% females, age 30.6 ± 10 years) from 21 Arab countries (87.5%) and 54 other countries (12.5%). Our analysis showed a significant rate of vaccine hesitancy among Arabic-speaking HCWs residing in and outside of Arab countries (25.8% and 32.8%, respectively). The highest rates of hesitancy were among participants from the western regions of the Arab world (Egypt, Morocco, Tunisia, and Algeria). The most cited reasons for hesitancy were concerns about side effects and distrust of the expedited vaccine production and healthcare policies. Factors associated with higher hesitancy included age of 30–59, previous or current suspected or confirmed COVID-19, female gender, not knowing the vaccine type authorized in the participant’s country, and not regularly receiving the influenza vaccine. Conclusion: This is the first large-scale multinational post-vaccine-availability study on COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among HCWs. It reveals high rates of hesitancy among Arab-speaking HCWs. Unless addressed properly, this hesitancy can impede the efforts for achieving widespread vaccination and collective immunity.","Qunaibi, Eyad Basheti Iman Soudy Mohamed Sultan Iyad",Vaccines,,33

480360,Author Correction: Years of life lost to COVID-19 in 81 countries,2021,"OBJECTIVE: This study explored a multiple mediation model in Wuhan's college students. Positive thinking and resilience were identified as mediators between 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) victimization experiences and mental health. METHOD: The sample included 384 from 4 universities in Wuhan, China. Four structured instruments were applied to the college students, including scale of the 2019-nCoV coronavirus victimization experience, scale of the positive thinking, scale of the resilience, and scale of the mental health. The responses were scored using a 5-point Likert scale. Structural equation models were used to construct measurement and structural models. RESULTS: The findings confirmed that the 2019-nCoV victimization experience was a negative predictor of mental health; positive thinking and resilience were strong mediators between 2019-nCoV victimization experience and mental health. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicated that a complete model was significant because positive thinking compensated for resilience. Notably, these 2 strong mediators will vastly resist the negative influences of 2019-nCoV victimization experience on mental health in Wuhan's college students until the end of the pandemic.

480962,Update on the ISGyP Endocervical Adenocarcinoma Project,2020,"BACKGROUND: In early 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, New Zealand implemented graduated, risk-informed national COVID-19 suppression measures aimed at disease elimination. We investigated their impacts on the epidemiology of the first wave of COVID-19 in the country and response performance measures. METHODS: We did a descriptive epidemiological study of all laboratory-confirmed and probable cases of COVID-19 and all patients tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in New Zealand from Feb 2 to May 13, 2020, after which time community transmission ceased. We extracted data from the national notifiable diseases database and the national SARS-CoV-2 test results repository. Demographic features and disease outcomes, transmission patterns (source of infection, outbreaks, household transmission), time-to-event intervals, and testing coverage were described over five phases of the response, capturing different levels of non-pharmaceutical interventions. Risk factors for severe outcomes (hospitalisation or death) were examined with multivariable logistic regression and time-to-event intervals were analysed by fitting parametric distributions using maximum likelihood estimation. FINDINGS: 1503 cases were detected over the study period, including 95 (6·3%) hospital admissions and 22 (1·5%) COVID-19 deaths. The estimated case infection rate per million people per day peaked at 8·5 (95% CI 7·6-9·4) during the 10-day period of rapid response escalation, declining to 3·2 (2·8-3·7) in the start of lockdown and progressively thereafter. 1034 (69%) cases were imported or import related, tending to be younger adults, of European ethnicity, and of higher socioeconomic status. 702 (47%) cases were linked to 34 outbreaks. Severe outcomes were associated with locally acquired infection (crude odds ratio [OR] 2·32 [95% CI 1·40-3·82] compared with imported), older age (adjusted OR ranging from 2·72 [1·40-5·30] for 50-64 year olds to 8·25 [2·59-26·31] for people aged &#8805;80 years compared with 20-34 year olds), aged residential care residency (adjusted OR 3·86 [1·59-9·35]), and Pacific peoples (adjusted OR 2·76 [1·14-6·68]) and Asian (2·15 [1·10-4·20]) ethnicities relative to European or other. Times from illness onset to notification and isolation progressively decreased and testing increased over the study period, with few disparities and increasing coverage of females, Maori, Pacific peoples, and lower socioeconomic groups. INTERPRETATION: New Zealand's response resulted in low relative burden of disease, low levels of population disease disparities, and the initial achievement of COVID-19 elimination.

481119,A generalized-growth model to characterize the early ascending phase of infectious disease outbreaks,2015-12-04,"As Europe is facing the second wave of the CoViD-19 pandemic, each country should carefully review how it dealt with the first wave of outbreak. Lessons from the first experience should be useful to avoid indiscriminate closures and, above all, to determine universal (understandable) parameters to guide the introduction of containment measures to reduce the spreading of the virus. The use of few (effective) parameters is indeed of extreme importance to create a link between authorities and population, allowing the latter to understand the reason for some restrictions and, consequently, to allow an active participation in the fight against the pandemic. Testing strategies, fitting skew parameters (as mean, mode, standard deviation, and skewness), mortality rates, and weekly CoViD-19 spreading data, as more people are getting infected, were used to compare the first wave of the outbreak in the Italian regions and to determine which parameters have to be checked before introducing restrictive containment measures. We propose few \textit{universal} parameters that, once appropriately weighed, could be useful to correctly differentiate the pandemic situation in the national territory and to rapidly assign the properly pandemic risk to each region.","Leo, Stefano De; Araujo, Manoel P.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.03373v2.pdf,33

Challenging resource allocation questions highlight the need for a clearly articulated ethics framework that integrates principled decision making into how different cardiovascular care services are prioritized. A practical application of the principles of harm minimisation, fairness, proportionality, respect, reciprocity, flexibility, and procedural justice is provided, and a model for prioritisation of the restoration of cardiovascular services is outlined. The prioritisation model may be used to determine how and when cardiovascular services should be continued or restored.

487217,Rapid Fabrication of Sterile Medical Nasopharyngeal Swabs by Stereolithography for Widespread Testing in a Pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has placed unprecedented strain on health-care systems. Frailty is being used in clinical decision making for patients with COVID-19, yet the prevalence and effect of frailty in people with COVID-19 is not known. In the COVID-19 in Older PEople (COPE) study we aimed to establish the prevalence of frailty in patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to hospital and investigate its association with mortality and duration of hospital stay. METHODS: This was an observational cohort study conducted at ten hospitals in the UK and one in Italy. All adults (&#8805;18 years) admitted to participating hospitals with COVID-19 were included. Patients with incomplete hospital records were excluded. The study analysed routinely generated hospital data for patients with COVID-19. Frailty was assessed by specialist COVID-19 teams using the clinical frailty scale (CFS) and patients were grouped according to their score (1-2=fit; 3-4=vulnerable, but not frail; 5-6=initial signs of frailty but with some degree of independence; and 7-9=severe or very severe frailty). The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality (time from hospital admission to mortality and day-7 mortality). FINDINGS: Between Feb 27, and April 28, 2020, we enrolled 1564 patients with COVID-19. The median age was 74 years (IQR 61-83); 903 (57·7%) were men and 661 (42·3%) were women; 425 (27·2%) had died at data cutoff (April 28, 2020). 772 (49·4%) were classed as frail (CFS 5-8) and 27 (1·7%) were classed as terminally ill (CFS 9). Compared with CFS 1-2, the adjusted hazard ratios for time from hospital admission to death were 1·55 (95% CI 1·00-2·41) for CFS 3-4, 1·83 (1·15-2·91) for CFS 5-6, and 2·39 (1·50-3·81) for CFS 7-9, and adjusted odds ratios for day-7 mortality were 1·22 (95% CI 0·63-2·38) for CFS 3-4, 1·62 (0·81-3·26) for CFS 5-6, and 3·12 (1·56-6·24) for CFS 7-9. INTERPRETATION: In a large population of patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19, disease outcomes were better predicted by frailty than either age or comorbidity. Our results support the use of CFS to inform decision making about medical care in adult patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19.

487766,Stories as “med-sins”: Lee Maracle’s Ravensong and Celia’s Song,2021,"Angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2), the cellular receptor for SARS-CoV-2, is widely distributed in the urogenital system, including proximal renal tubular cells, urothelial bladder cells, Leydig cells, and cells in seminiferous ducts. Thus, the potential direct insults in COVID-19 patients include acute kidney injury (AKI), hypogonadism, and infertility. The implications of SARS-CoV-2 being isolated from urine include potential transmission through urine and the possibility of a urine-based noninvasive diagnostic test. Viral shedding in urine may be a result of cytokine storm-induced renal dysfunction or direct invasion by binding to ACE2 receptors. Emphasis is made about the cadre of urological patients at increased risk of COVID-19, including those with urological malignancies and chronic kidney disease, especially dialysis-dependent patients. These patients have increased susceptibility to infection and also higher mortality due to decreased immunity. As such, the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic for a urologist is underscored.","Abhisek, Pandey",Indian Journal of Urology,,33
487965,"Thank You to JAMA Peer Reviewers, Authors, and Readers",2020,"OBJECTIVES: To analyze the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 related deaths in Wuhan, China and comprehend the changing trends of this epidemic along with analyzing the prevention and control measures in Wuhan. METHODS: Through the China's Infectious Disease Information System, we collected information about COVID-19 associated deaths from December 15, 2019 to February 24, 2020 in Wuhan. We analyzed the patient's demographic characteristics, drew epidemiological curve and made geographic distribution maps of the death toll in each district over time, etc. ArcGIS was used to plot the numbers of daily deaths on maps. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS and @Risk software. RESULTS: As of February 24, 2020, a total of 1833 deaths were included. Among the deaths with COVID-19, mild type accounted for the most (37.2%), followed by severe type (30.1%). The median age was 70.0 (inter quartile range: 63.0-79.0) years. Most of the deaths were distributed in 50-89 age group, whereas no deaths occurred in 0-9 age group. Additionally, the male to female ratio was 1.95:1. A total of 65.7% of the deaths in Wuhan combined with underlying diseases, and was more pronounced among males. Most of the underlying diseases included hypertension, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. The peak of daily deaths appeared on February 14 and then declined. The median interval from symptom onset to diagnosis was 10.0 (6.0-14.0) days; the interval from onset to diagnosis gradually shortened. The median intervals from diagnosis to death and symptom onset to deaths were 6.0 (2.0-11.0), 17.0 (12.0-22.0) days, respectively. Most of the disease was centralized in central urban area with highest death rate in Jianghan District. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 poses a greater threat to the elderly people and men with more devastating effects, particularly in the presence of underlying diseases. The geographical distributions show that the epidemic in the central area of Wuhan is more serious than that in the surrounding areas. Analysis of deaths as of February 24 indicates that a tremendous improvement of COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan has achieved by effective control measures taken by Wuhan Government.","Bai, Jianjun; Shi, Fang; Cao, Jinhong; Wen, Haoyu; Wang, Fang; Mubarik, Sumaira; Liu, Xiaoxue; Yu, Yong; Ding, Jianbo; Yu, Chuanhua",Glob Health Res Policy,,33

Early reports suggest that one downstream ramification is a change in trauma presentations. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect these public health measures had on major trauma admissions in the Northern Region, New Zealand. METHODS: A retrospective comparative cohort study was performed. Two cohorts were identified: 16 March to 8 June 2020 and the same period in 2019. Data was extracted from the New Zealand Major Trauma Registry which prospectively collects data on all major trauma in New Zealand. All patients who presented to a hospital in the Northern Region with major trauma and met the Registry inclusion criteria were included. RESULTS: There were 163 major trauma admissions in 2019 and 123 in 2020, a reduction of 25% (rate ratio 0.75, 95% confidence interval 0.6-0.95; P = 0.018). There was no significant difference in mechanism of injury (P = 0.442), type of injury (P = 0.062) or intent of injury (P = 0.971). There was a significant difference in place of injury (P = 0.004) with 20% of injuries happening at home in 2019 compared with 35% in 2020. CONCLUSION: This study has shown that public health interventions to prevent the spread of COVID-19 reduced major trauma admissions in the Northern Region of New Zealand. There was a variation in effect a between institutions within the region and a change in pattern of injury.","McGuinness, Matthew J; Harmston, Christopher",ANZ J Surg,,33

In the context of COVID-19, some studies observed inverse associations between influenza vaccination and SARS-CoV-2 infection and clinical outcomes, while others did not. We conducted a meta-analysis to assess the association between influenza vaccination and SARS-CoV-2 infection and clinical outcomes, aiming to provide evidence for COVID-19 prevention and vaccination promotion. We searched four databases from inception to 10 March, 2021. Random effects and fixed effects models were used to pool odds ratios (ORs) and adjusted estimates with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We used funnel plots to evaluate the publication bias, I2 statistics to evaluate the heterogeneity, and conducted subgroup analyses. Sixteen observational studies involving 290,327 participants were included. Influenza vaccination was associated with a lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection (pooled adjusted OR: 0.86, 95%CI: 0.81–0.91), while not significantly associated with adverse outcomes (intensive care: adjusted OR 0.63, 95%CI: 0.22–1.81;hospitalization: adjusted OR 0.74, 95%CI: 0.51–1.06;mortality: adjusted OR 0.89, 95%CI: 0.73–1.09). Our findings suggest that influenza vaccination is associated with a lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. It is crucial for policy makers to implement strategies on influenza vaccination, for it may also have benefits for COVID-19 prevention.","Wang, Ruitong Liu Min Liu Jue",Vaccines,,33

490492,2020: The year of the microbe,2021,"ABSTRACT Objective: to relate nursing diagnoses/outcomes and interventions for critically ill patients affected by COVID-19 and sepsis in the Intensive Care Unit, according to the International Classification for Nursing Practice (ICNP®). Method: a documentary study conducted in March and April 2020 from the ICNP® terminology subset for adult patients with sepsis. The documentary corpus was composed of the list of nursing diagnoses/outcomes and interventions based on Horta's Theory of Basic Human Needs; on the 7-Axis Model of the International Classification for Nursing Practice, version 2017; on the Pathophysiological model of sepsis; as well as relying on the authors' expertise in direct care for suspected or confirmed critically ill patients affected by COVID-19. Outcomes: a total of 58 nursing diagnoses/outcomes were identified that belong to the psychobiological needs of oxygenation (13-22.4%), vascular regulation (12-20.7%), neurological regulation (10-17.2%), hydration (08-13.8%), elimination (08-13.8%), immunological regulation (04-6.9%) and thermal regulation (03-5.2%), evidencing a total of 172 nursing interventions with a mean of 03 for each nursing diagnosis/outcome. Conclusion: data analysis provided greater knowledge about the disease and the nursing process in the ICU setting, serving as a guide for the professional practice for critically ill patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and sepsis.","Ramalho Neto, José Melquiades; Viana, Renata Andréa Pietro Pereira; Franco, Andrezza Serpa; Prado, Patrícia Rezende do; Gonçalves, Fernanda Alves Ferreira; Nóbrega, Maria Miriam Lima da",Texto &amp; contexto enferm,,33

Previous studies have already reported that biological and social risk factors increase disease susceptibility, particularly in BAME communities. Despite frontline workers in ethnic minority communities in the United Kingdom's National Health Service attempting to quell the pandemic, disproportionate numbers of BAME physicians and other health care workers have died of COVID-19. This unprecedented situation highlights ethical and moral implications, which could further augment the impact of the pandemic on their mental health. While the government attempts to mitigate the rate of virus transmission, certain key factors inadvertently augment the negative impact of the pandemic on the mental health and general well-being of BAME communities. This study examined the available literature to explore the association between, and the wider impact of, COVID-19 on BAME communities. Furthermore, this study aims to raise awareness and provide a deeper insight into current scientific discussions.","Phiri, Peter; Delanerolle, Gayathri; Al-Sudani, Ayaat; Rathod, Shanaya",JMIR Public Health Surveill,,33
491965,Rapid behavioural response of urban birds to COVID-19 lockdown,2021,"Activatable contrast agents are of ongoing research interest because they offer low background and high specificity to the imaging target. Engineered sensitivity to protease activity is particularly desirable because proteases are critical biomarkers in cancer, infectious disease, inflammatory disorders, and so forth. Herein, we developed and characterized a set of peptide-linked cyanine conjugates for dual-modal detection of protease activity via photoacoustic (PA) and fluorescence imaging. The peptide-dye conjugates were designed to undergo contact quenching via intramolecular dimerization and contained n dyes (n = 2, 3, or 4) with n - 1 cleavable peptide substrates. The absorption peaks of the conjugates were blue-shifted 50 nm relative to the free dye and had quenched fluorescence. This effect was sensitive to solvent polarity and could be reversed by solvent switching from water to dimethyl sulfoxide. Employing trypsin as a model protease, we observed a 2.5-fold recovery of the peak absorbance, 330-4600-fold fluorescent enhancement, and picomolar detection limits following proteolysis. The dimer probe was further characterized for PA activation. Proteolysis released single dye-peptide fragments that produced a 5-fold PA enhancement through the increased absorption at 680 nm with nanomolar sensitivity to trypsin. The peptide substrate could also be tuned for protease selectivity; as a proof-of-concept, we detected the main protease (Mpro) associated with the viral replication in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Last, the activated probe was imaged subcutaneously in mice and signal was linearly correlated to the cleaved probe. Overall, these results demonstrate a tunable scaffold for the PA molecular imaging of protease activity with potential value in areas such as disease monitoring, tumor imaging, intraoperative imaging, in vitro diagnostics, and point-of-care sensing.","Moore, Colman; Borum, Raina M; Mantri, Yash; Xu, Ming; Fajtová, Pavla; O039,; Donoghue, Anthony J; Jokerst, Jesse V",ACS Sens,,33

INTRODUCTION: The pandemic caused by the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has catalized several changes in many fields of our lives, and also at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of the University of Debrecen, Hungary. OBJECTIVES: We wanted to analyse the compound effect of our new local protocols regarding elective labour inductions at term, the coronavirus pandemic and the resulting infection control measures, the merging of the Obstetrics and Gynecology Ward of the Kenézy County Hospital of Debrecen and the University Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, and also the change of the legal environment. METHODS: Local protocols were introduced: 1. Labour induction. 2. Cervical ripening in labour induction. 3. Choosing the route of delivery after cesarean. 4. Management of pregnancy around term in the case of planned trial of labour after cesarean. We compared the obstetrical data (number of deliveries, cesarean section rate, perinatal outcome and the rate and success rate of labour inductions) before and after the implementation of the protocols. The results were also compared to the Hungarian national database. RESULTS: The annual cesarean rate at our department dropped to 33.5% in 2020. In the first 9-month period, after the introduction of the new reforms, the cesarean rate decreased to 30.7%, whereas the Hungarian national rate was 40.3% in 2020. At our department, 20% of all the deliveries were induced and 74% of them led to vaginal deliveries in 2020, while in 2019 only 11% of deliveries were labour inductions, and 47% of these cases were vaginal deliveries. The monthly number of deliveries was rising constantly between January 2020 (250 deliveries) and January 2021 (450 deliveries), and the monthly cesarean rate decreased from 41% to 25%. Comparing the data of 2019 and 2020, the annual perinatal mortality rate dropped from 6.3 in 2019 to 4.2 in 2020. Neonatal morbidity, as measured by admissions to the neonatal intensive care unit, also decreased (14.8% in 2019 and 13.5% in 2020). CONCLUSIONS: As a compound result of the described factors, but mainly due to the new protocols, both the rate and the success rate of labour inductions increased significantly, while the cesarean rate decreased with improving perinatal mortality and morbidity.

494779,Pathogenesis guided therapeutic management of COVID-19: an immunological perspective,2020,"Of the three groups of innate lymphoid cells, the type 3 innate lymphoid cell(s) (ILC3) include the subgroup of enteric ILC3 that participates in many physiological functions of the organism, such as promoting the repair of damaged mucosa, maintaining the homeostasis of gut symbiotic microorganisms, and presenting specific antigens. ILC3 also includes splenic and decidual ILC3. Like other physiological processes in the organism, enteric ILC3 functions are precisely regulated at the endogenous and exogenous levels. However, there has been no review on the physiological functions and regulatory signals of intestinal ILC3. In this paper, based on the current research on the physiological functions of enteric ILC3 in animals and the human, we summarize the signals that regulate cytokine secretion, antigen presentation and the quantity of ILC3 under normal intestinal conditions. We discuss for the first time the classification of the promoting mechanism of secretagogues of ILC3 into direct and indirect types. We also propose that ILC3 can promote intestinal homeostasis, and intestinal homeostasis can ensure the physiological phenotype of ILC3. If homeostasis is disturbed, ILC3 may participate in intestinal pathological changes. Therefore, regulating ILC3 and maintaining intestinal homeostasis are critical to the body.","Xian, Yin; Lv, Xiaodong; Xie, Minjia; Xiao, Fuyang; Kong, Chenyang; Ren, Yixing",Life Sci,,33

496811,Joint ACPGBI and The Duke's Club statement on colonoscopy training,2021,"Introduction: Bladder outflow obstruction (BOO) surgery is among the most commonly performed urologic procedures. Postoperative assessment consists of physical measurement of uroflowmetry and post-void residual volume, but health systems worldwide have experienced pressures in demand, leading to exploration of greater efficiency in organizing clinic protocols. International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) questionnaire measurement has been identified as a tool to predict change in postoperative management. Our institution established a nurse-led follow-up virtual clinic (VC) for patients undergoing BOO surgery based on IPSS measurement. We present the clinical and economic outcomes of this new service. Materials and Methods: Patients with a successful postoperative trial without catheter were contacted by telephone via VC and discharged by a Urology Clinical Nurse Specialist (UCNS) if IPSS was <8. Data were analyzed for IPSS, arrangement of subsequent clinic visits, and numbers discharged. Primary outcome was the proportion of patients discharged after VC consultation. Secondary outcomes were overall discharge rate following subsequent face-to-face (FTF) appointment; and the proportion of patients re-referred from Primary Care within 3 months of discharge from VC. Cost savings were calculated based on tariffs of £135 for first attendance with UCNS, £199 for uroflowmetry, and £47.84 for VC appointment. Results: The first 50 patients to be recipients of the new VC were included. The median IPSS and quality-of-life score were 13 (interquartile range [IQR] 5) and 3 (IQR 1), respectively. Thirty-nine (78%) patients were discharged from VC; 36 (72%) had IPSS <8. Overall discharge rate following subsequent FTF appointment was 88%. Two patients discharged from VC (5.1%) were subsequently re-referred, neither of whom required additional treatment. Total cost savings with VC amounted to £10,634. Conclusion: Telephone follow-up for BOO surgery based on IPSS is clinically safe and cost-effective, providing greater efficiency for clinic protocols.","Sarmah, Piyush Bhargav; Broadley, Graham Alexander; Khwaja, Sikandar; Delves, George Henry",J. endourol,,33

We demonstrate that the authors refer to conclusions that are not supported by experimental data. Further, there is a lack of objective, independent information and studies regarding the widespread, public testing program currently in force in the Slovak Republic. We offer an alternative explanation of observed data as they have been provided by the Slovak Republic government to fill this information gap. We also provide explanations and conclusions that more accurately describe viral spread dynamics. Drawing from available public data and our simple but rigorous analysis, we show that it is not possible to make clear conclusions about any positive impact of the public testing program in the Slovak Republic. In particular, it is not possible to conclude that this testing program forces the curve down for the SARS-CoV-2 virus outbreak. We think that Pavelka et al. did not consider many fundamental phenomena in their proposed computer simulations and data analysis - in particular: the complexity of SARS-CoV-2 virus spread. In complex spatio-temporal dynamical systems, small spatio-temporal fluctuations can dramatically change the dynamics of virus spreading on large scales.","vCern'ak, Jozef",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.00613v1.pdf,33

We present our single-centre nurse-led initiation and titration clinic findings from Waikato Hospital. Method: Our retrospective analysis includes 149 consecutive patients with HFrEF who were commenced on sacubitril/valsartan by the Heart Failure Clinical Nurse Specialist (HF CNS) clinic between 1 October 2018 and 30 September 2019. Statistical analyses for Wilcoxon signed-rank test (two-tailed) were performed using Prism 8. Results: Our cohort of 149 patients were predominantly male (81%) with a median age of 68. The majority were either European (72%) or Māori (25%). Two-thirds (64%) were aetiologically non-ischaemic. Mean systolic blood pressure, mean GFR, mean weight and mean serum K+ were similar at baseline and at 6 month follow-up. 69% achieved target dose and 6% had withdrawal of sacubitril/valsartan. 36% had reduction in loop diuretic dose and 18% had mineralocorticoid antagonist withdrawn. Statistically significant differences were observed with decrease in NYHA Class (z = -7.961; p &lt;.00001), decrease in NT-pro BNP (z = -6.441; p &lt;.00001) and improvement in LVEF (z = -6.052; p &lt;.00001) across the cohort. 10% (n = 15) were hospitalised for HF and 3.4% died (n = 5) within 6 months of commencing sacubitril/valsartan. Conclusion: Our early, single-centre experience with a nurse-initiated and led sacubitril-valsartan clinic has yielded results in keeping with the data from the PARADIGM-HF trial, whereby patients experience an improvement clinically (NYHA Class), biochemically (NT-pro BNP) and echocardiographically () with a favourable adverse effect profile.

Currently, several vaccine candidates against SARS-CoV-2 are in clinical trials but approval of these vaccines is likely to take a long time before they are available for public use. In a previous report, the importance of passive immunity and how immunoglobulin (Ig)G collected from recovered coronavirus patients could help in the protection against COVID-19 and boost the immune system of new patients was reported. Passive immunity by immunoglobulin transfer is a concept employed by most mammals and bovine IgG has a role to play in human therapy. IgG is one of the major components of the immunological activity found in cow's milk and colostrum. Heterologous transfer of passive immunity associated with the consumption of bovine immune milk by humans has been investigated for decades for its immunological activity against infections. This short review focuses on passive immunity and how microfiltered raw immune milk or colostrum collected from cows vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 could provide short-term protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans and could be used as an option until a vaccine becomes commercially available.","Jawhara, Samir",Front Immunol,,33

Healthcare databases were systematically searched over 2-weeks from 1st-14th November 2020 to identify eligible studies assessing the impact of COVID-19 on hip fracture patients. Meta-analysis of proportion was performed to obtain pooled values of prevalence, incidence and case fatality rate of hip fracture patients with COVID-19 infection. 30-day mortality, excess mortality and all-cause mortality were analysed using a mixed-effects model. 22 studies reporting 4015 patients were identified out of which 2651 (66%) were assessed during the pandemic. An excess mortality of 10% was seen for hip fractures treated during the pandemic (OR 2.00, p = 0.007), in comparison to the pre-pandemic controls (5%). Estimated mortality of COVID-19 positive hip fracture patients was four-fold (RR 4.59, p < 0.0001) and 30-day mortality was 38.0% (HR 4.73, p < 0.0001).

498849,Binding site analysis of potential protease inhibitors of COVID-19 using AutoDock,2020,"OBJECTIVE: Reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) has been validated to diagnose several viral infections. However, its diagnostic accuracy in detecting SARS-CoV-2 in real-life clinical settings remains unclear. This study aimed to determine the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of RT-LAMP compared to reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) over the disease course of COVID-19. METHODS: A total of 124 nasopharyngeal swab samples obtained from 24 COVID-19 patients were tested by RT-LAMP and RT-qPCR. Sensitivities and specificities of RT-LAMP compared with RT-qPCR were analyzed as a function of time from onset. RESULTS: Up to the 9th day after onset, the RT-LAMP had a positivity of 92.8%, and the sensitivity and specificity compared with RT-qPCR was 100%. However, after the 10th day after onset, the positivity of RT-LAMP decreased to less than 25%, and the concordance of positivity between the two methods was below 60%. The limit of detection of RT-LAMP was 6.7 copies/reaction. CONCLUSIONS: Until the 9th day after the onset of symptoms, RT-LAMP had the same diagnostic accuracy as RT-qPCR. These findings suggest that RT-LAMP can be used as a diagnostic tool for COVID-19 as an alternative to RT-qPCR in the acute symptomatic phase of COVID-19.","Inaba, Masato; Higashimoto, Yuki; Toyama, Yoko; Horiguchi, Tomoya; Hibino, Masaya; Iwata, Mitsunaga; Imaizumi, Kazuyoshi; Doi, Yohei",Int J Infect Dis,,33

499699,Medical costs of keeping the US economy open during COVID-19,2020,"As the COVID-19 spreads across the world, many nations impose lockdown measures at the early stage of the pandemic to prevent the spread of the disease. Controversy surrounds the lockdown as it is a choice between economic freedom and public health. The ultimate solution to a pandemic is to vaccinate a massive population to achieve herd immunity. However, the whole vaccination programme is a long and complicated process. The virus and the vaccine will persist for quite a long time. How to gradually ease the lockdown based on vaccination progress is an important issue, as both economic and epidemiological issues are involved. In this paper, we extend the classic SIR model to find optimal decision making to balance between economy and public health in the process of vaccination rollout. The model provides an approach of vaccine value estimation. Our results provide scientific suggestion for policymakers to make important decisions about when to start the lockdown and how strong it should be over the entire vaccination cycle.","Fu, Yuting; Jin, Hanqing; Xiang, Haitao; Wang, Ning",Financ Res Lett,,33

SETTING: Ophthalmology department of Centro Hospitalar e Universitário do Porto (CHUP), Oporto, Portugal. DESIGN: Cross-sectional, non-randomized, retrospective study. METHODOLOGY: Data of all patients waiting for cataract surgery were analysed at the beginning of May 2020, after two months without performing elective surgery. The waiting time since surgical inscription was considered an independent and overriding factor. Also, higher priority was given to patients with white or brunescent cataracts and patients with low visual acuity: corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) &#8804;20/200 in binocular patients or CDVA &#8804;20/63 in monocular patients. Criteria of medium priority included patients that remained with anisometropia and patients with glaucoma or low to moderate risk of chronic angle closure. Data of scheduled surgeries in the following months were then analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 717 patients were waiting for phacoemulsification in our center. 191 patients (26.64%) had more than 4.5 months on the waiting list; the medium waiting time was 3.51±1.57 months. According to both priority criteria and waiting time, 48.6% (n=348) were categorized as priority cases. A total of 158 patients (22.0%) met the highest priority; 61 patients (8.5%) met the medium priority criteria. In 129 patients (18.0%), priority was considered based solely on higher waiting time. This algorithm allowed us to operate all priority cases within the first three months. CONCLUSION: The presented protocol showed to be effective, providing a timely surgical opportunity for priority cases.","Vieira, Rita; Baptista, Pedro; Castro, Catarina; Leite, João; Menéres, Maria João; Menéres, Pedro",J. cataract. refract. surg,,33

Genomic surveillance of SARSCoV-2 emerging variants is important for pandemic monitoring and informing public health responses. Through an interstate academic-public health partnership, we established Rhode Island's capacity to sequence SARSCoV-2 genomes and created a systematic surveillance program to monitor the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 variants in the state. We describe circulating SARSCoV-2 lineages in Rhode Island;provide a timeline for the emerging and expanding contribution of variants of concern (VOC) and variants of interest (VOI), from their first introduction to their eventual predominance over other lineages;and outline the frequent identification of known adaptively beneficial spike protein mutations that appear to have independently arisen in non-VOC/non-VOI lineages. Overall, the described Rhode Islandcentric genomic surveillance initiative provides a valuable perspective on SARS-CoV-2 in the state and contributes data of interest for future epidemiological studies and state-to-state comparisons.

501590,Year 2020 in review – Emergency medicine,2020,"BACKGROUND: Since December 2019, a number of cases and deaths due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic have been reported worldwide. In spite of clinical manifestations similar to the SARS-CoV epidemic in 2003, affected organs and severity are yet to be defined. Moreover, viral load alterations and viral shielding among different specimens remained scarce. Therefore, clarifying clinical presentations and correlations among viral loads, disease severity, and viral shielding of SARS-CoV-2 infection is crucial in the disease prevention. METHODS: The clinical courses of SARS-CoV-2 cases were presented through Gantt charts. Laboratory examinations and reverse-transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reactions (RT-qPCR) among different specimens were tested periodically. Cycle thresholds (CT) were recorded and presented as viral loads. RESULTS: From March 2020 to April 2020, four SARS-CoV-2 cases were presented, of which, cases 1 and 2 manifested the symptoms severer than cases 3 and 4, along with higher serum lactate dehydrogenase levels and graded for lymphocytopenia. Case 4 initially exhibited anosmia, but recovered within a short period. Curves of the CT of all the cases, except case 2, concaved upward after prescribing hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and azithromycin. Except for case 4, the CT in most stool specimens remained undetectable; however, none of the cases presented gastrointestinal symptoms. Surprisingly, the CT values of the saliva specimens were inconsistent with those of the nasopharyngeal swabs and sputum. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 manifests various symptoms. Sudden onset of central nervous system symptoms should be considered. The timing of HCQ and azithromycin administration might be a key factor in the viral load reduction. Positive prediction values of RT-qPCR of different specimens should be tested carefully to prevent false-negative results.","Chen, Po-Liang; Hsiao, Yi-Han; Chuang, Chien; Feng, Jia-Yih; Ho, Hsiang-Ling; Lin, Yi-Tsung; Chen, Su-Jung; Huang, Shiang-Fen; Chen, Hsin-Pai; Chou, Teh-Ying; Chen, Yuh-Min; Wang, Fu-Der",J.

METHODS: We performed a retrospective, single-center analysis of 84 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in Wuhan Union Hospital, China, from January 19 through February 7, 2020. Cases were confirmed by real-time reverse-transcriptase PCR of nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Blood samples were analyzed for white blood cell count, lymphocyte count, alanine aminotransferase, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, D-dimer, C-reactive protein, and in some cases, immunoglobulins, complement, lymphocyte subsets, and cytokines. Virus RNA was detected in stool samples by real-time PCR. RESULTS: Of the 84 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 26 (31%) had diarrhea. The duration of fever and dyspnea in patients with diarrhea was significantly longer than those without diarrhea (all P < .05). Stool samples from a higher proportion of patients with diarrhea tested positive for virus RNA (69%) than from patients without diarrhea (17%) (P < .001). As of February 19, a lower proportion of patients with diarrhea had a negative result from the latest throat swab for SARS-CoV-2 (77%) than patients without diarrhea (97%) (P = .010), during these patients' hospitalization. Of 76 patients with a negative result from their latest throat swab test during hospitalization, a significantly higher proportion of patients with diarrhea had a positive result from the retest for SARS-CoV-2 in stool (45%) than patients without diarrhea (20%) (P = .039). CONCLUSIONS: At a single center in Wuhan, China, 31% of patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia had diarrhea. A significantly higher proportion of patients with diarrhea have virus RNA in stool than patients without diarrhea. Elimination of SARS-CoV-2 from stool takes longer than elimination from the nose and throat.","Wei, Xiao-Shan; Wang, Xu; Niu, Yi-Ran; Ye, Lin-Lin; Peng, Wen-Bei; Wang, Zi-Hao; Yang, Wei-Bing; Yang, Bo-Han; Zhang, Jian-Chu; Ma, Wan-Li; Wang, Xiao-Rong; Zhou, Qiong",Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol,,33

505744,Newborn Infants' Preference for Attractive Faces: The Role of Internal and External Facial Features,2000,"According to previous reports, diabetes seems to be a risk factor which worsens the serious clinical events caused by COVID-19. But is diabetes per se a risk factor that increases the probability of getting the virus? This paper will discuss this point. There are not many research data on antidiabetic drugs in this context. The potential influence of glucose-lowering agents on the severity of COVID-19 has not been described yet. Dipeptidylpeptidase-4 (DPP-4) is a cell surface protein ubiquitously expressed in many tissues and it is also a soluble molecule found in serum/plasma fluids. DPP-4 is involved in infection of cells by some viruses. This paper reviews data about the use of DPP-4 inhibitors and others diabetes drugs on COVID-19 patients. As such, no available evidence has yet suggested that glucose-lowering drugs - including those targeting DPP4-related pathways - produce any significant harm or benefit in the context of human infections. However, insulin must remain the first-choice agent in the management of critically ill-hospitalized patients, while it is recommended to suspend other agents in unstable patients. This paper provides related French and international recommendations for people with diabetes who got infected by COVID-19 and upholds that infections may alter glucose control and may require additional vigilance.","Bouhanick, Béatrice; Cracowski, Jean-Luc; Faillie, Jean-Luc",Therapie,,33

509165,Improving adherence: It's complicated,2021,"AIMS: Cell surface binding immunoglobin protein (csBiP) is predicted to be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 binding. With a substrate-binding domain (SBD) that binds to polypeptides and a nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) that can initiate extrinsic caspase-dependent apoptosis, csBiP may be a promising therapeutic target for COVID-19. This study aims to identify FDA-approved drugs that can neutralize viral binding and prevent viral replication by targeting the functional domains of csBiP. METHODS: In silico screening of 1999 FDA-approved drugs against the functional domains of BiP were performed using three molecular docking programs to avoid bias from individual docking programs. Top ligands were selected by averaging the ligand rankings from three programs. Interactions between top ligands and functional domains of BiP were analyzed. KEY FINDINGS: The top 10 SBD-binding candidates are velpatasvir, irinotecan, netupitant, lapatinib, doramectin, conivaptan, fenoverine, duvelisib, irbesartan, and pazopanib. The top 10 NBD-binding candidates are nilotinib, eltrombopag, grapiprant, topotecan, acetohexamide, vemurafenib, paritaprevir, pixantrone, azosemide, and piperaquine-phosphate. Among them, Velpatasvir and paritaprevir are antiviral agents that target the protease of hepatitis C virus. Netupitant is an anti-inflammatory drug that inhibits neurokinin-1 receptor, which contributes to acute inflammation. Grapiprant is an anti-inflammatory drug that inhibits the prostaglandin E2 receptor protein subtype 4, which is expressed on immune cells and triggers inflammation. These predicted SBD-binding drugs could disrupt SARS-CoV-2 binding to csBiP, and NBD-binding drugs may falter viral attachment and replication by locking the SBD in closed conformation and triggering apoptosis in infected cells. SIGNIFICANCE: csBiP appears to be a novel therapeutic target against COVID-19 by preventing viral attachment and replication. These identified drugs could be repurposed to treat COVID-19 patients.","Zhang, Yiming; Greer, Rory A; Song, Yuwei; Praveen, Hrithik; Song, Yuhua",Eur J Pharm Sci,,33

We used data from the Singapore Civil Defence Force to compare the incidence, characteristics and outcomes of all Emergency Medical Services (EMS)-attended adult OHCA during the pandemic (January-May 2020) and pre-pandemic (January-May 2018 and 2019) periods. Pre-hospital return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) was the primary outcome. Binary logistic regression was used to calculate the adjusted odds ratios (aOR) for the characteristics of OHCA. Of the 3893 OHCA patients (median age 72 years, 63.7% males), 1400 occurred during the pandemic period and 2493 during the pre-pandemic period. Compared with the pre-pandemic period, OHCAs during the pandemic period more likely occurred at home (aOR: 1.48; 95% CI: 1.24-1.75) and were witnessed (aOR: 1.71; 95% CI: 1.49-1.97).

510324,Anesthetic effects of AQUI-S 20E® (eugenol) on the afferent neural activity of the oyster toadfish (Opsanus tau),2020,"OBJECTIVES: COVID-19 pandemic caused several alarming challenges for clinical trials. On-site source data verification (SDV) in the multicenter clinical trial became difficult due to travel ban and social distancing. For multicenter clinical trials, centralized data monitoring is an efficient and cost-effective method of data monitoring. Centralized data monitoring reduces the risk of COVID-19 infections and provides additional capabilities compared to on-site monitoring. The key steps for on-site monitoring include identifying key risk factors and thresholds for the risk factors, developing a monitoring plan, following up the risk factors, and providing a management plan to mitigate the risk. METHODS: For analysis purposes, we simulated data similar to our clinical trial data. We classified the data monitoring process into two groups, such as the Supervised analysis process, to follow each patient remotely by creating a dashboard and an Unsupervised analysis process to identify data discrepancy, data error, or data fraud. We conducted several risk-based statistical analysis techniques to avoid on-site source data verification to reduce time and cost, followed up with each patient remotely to maintain social distancing, and created a centralized data monitoring dashboard to ensure patient safety and maintain the data quality. CONCLUSION: Data monitoring in clinical trials is a mandatory process. A risk-based centralized data review process is cost-effective and helpful to ignore on-site data monitoring at the time of the pandemic. We summarized how different statistical methods could be implemented and explained in SAS to identify various data error or fabrication issues in multicenter clinical trials.","Afroz, Most Alina; Schwarber, Grant; Bhuiyan, Mohammad Alfrad Nobel",Contemp Clin Trials,,33
512250,Past epidemics in transylvania (1830–1918) and their lessons for the current challenges,2020,"Background: Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have shown a range of clinical outcomes. Previous studies have reported that patient comorbidities are predictive of worse clinical outcomes, especially when patients have multiple chronic diseases. We aim to: 1) derive a simplified comorbidity evaluation and determine its accuracy of predicting clinical outcomes (i.e., hospital admission, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, ventilation, and in-hospital mortality);and 2) determine its performance accuracy in comparison to well-established comorbidity indexes. Methods: This was a single-center retrospective observational study. We enrolled all emergency department (ED) patients with COVID-19 from March 1, 2020, to December 31, 2020. A simplified comorbidity evaluation (COVID-related high-risk chronic condition (CCC)) was derived to predict different clinical outcomes using multivariate logistic regressions. In addition, chronic diseases included in the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) and Elixhauser Comorbidity Index (ECI) were scored, and its accuracy of predicting COVID-19 clinical outcomes was also compared with the CCC. Results: Data were retrieved from 90,549 ED patient visits during the study period, among which 3,864 patients were COVID-19 positive. Forty-seven point nine percent (1,851/3,864) were admitted to the hospital, 9.4% (364) patients were admitted to the ICU, 6.2% (238) received invasive mechanical ventilation, and 4.6% (177) patients died in the hospital. The CCC evaluation correlated well with the four studied clinical outcomes. The adjusted odds ratios of predicting inhospital death from CCC was 2.84 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.81 - 4.45, P &lt; 0.001). C-statistics of CCC predicting in-hospital allcause mortality was 0.73 (0.69 - 0.76), similar to those of the CCI’s (0.72) and ECI’s (0.71, P = 0.0513). Conclusions: CCC can accurately predict clinical outcomes among patients with COVID-19. Its performance accuracies for such predictions are not inferior to those of the CCI or ECI’s. © The authors © Journal compilation Clin Med Res and Elmer Press Inc™ ;www.jocmr.org This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial 4.0 International License, which permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited","Kirby, J.

513660,The Green-Tao theorem for affine curves over F_q,2021-01-04,"ORF7a is an accessory protein common to SARS-CoV1 and the recently discovered SARS-CoV2, which is causing the COVID19 pandemic. The ORF7a protein has a structural homology with ICAM-1 which binds to the T lymphocyte integrin receptor LFA-1. As COVID19 has a strong immune component as part of the disease, we sought to determine whether SARS-CoV2 would have a similar structural interaction with LFA-1. Using molecular docking simulations, we found that SARS-CoV2 ORF7a has the key structural determinants required to bind LFA-1 but also the related leukocyte integrin Mac-1, which is also known to be expressed by macrophages. Our study shows that SARS-CoV2 ORF7a protein has a conserved Ig immunoglobulin-like fold containing an integrin binding site that provides a mechanistic hypothesis for SARS-CoV2's interaction with the human immune system. This suggests that experimental investigation of ORF7a mediated effects on immune cells such as T lymphocytes and macrophages (leukocytes) could help understand the disease further and develop effective treatments.","Nizamudeen, Zubair A; Xu, Emma-Ruoqi; Karthik, Vivin; Halawa, Mohamed; Arkill, Kenton P; Jackson, Andrew; Bates, David O; Elmsley, Jonas",Biosci. rep,,33

A mathematical model was formulated based on non-linear ordinary differential equations considering young (60 years old or less) and elder (60 years old or more) subpopulations, aiming to describe the introduction and dissemination of the new coronavirus in São Paulo. This deterministic model used the data collected from São Paulo to estimate the model parameters, obtaining R0 = 6.8 for the basic reproduction number. The model also allowed to estimate that 50% of the population of São Paulo was in isolation, which permitted to describe the current epidemiological status. The goal of isolation implemented in São Paulo to control the rapid increase of the new coronavirus epidemic was partially succeeded, concluding that if isolation of at least 80% of the population had been implemented, the collapse in the health care system could be avoided. Nevertheless, the isolated persons must be released one day. Based on this model, we studied the potential epidemiological scenarios of release by varying the proportions of the release of young and elder persons. We also evaluated three different strategies of release: All isolated persons are released simultaneously, two and three releases divided in equal proportions. The better scenarios occurred when young persons are released, but maintaining elder persons isolated for a while. When compared with the epidemic without isolation, all strategies of release did not attain the goal of reducing substantially the number of hospitalisations due to severe CoViD-19. Hence, we concluded that the best decision must be postponing the beginning of the release.","Yang, H M; Lombardi Junior, L P; Castro, F F M; Yang, A C",Epidemiol Infect,,33

Management of oncological patients affected by chemo-, immune-, and radiotherapy-related cutaneous and mucosal adverse events is a challenge. Firstly because of the differential diagnosis of cutaneous rash (e.g., drug-related rash or paraviral exanthema). Secondly, oncological patients can suffer from xerosis, pruritus, and mucositis that contribute to cutaneous and mucosal barrier lesions, thus becoming vulnerable site for viral or bacterial colonization. These lesions can also be aggravated by the use of protective mask and gloves. Here, we report also our results of a teledermatological survey on 87 oncological patients, where the health status of oncological patients referred to our dedicated clinic was assessed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, it is fundamental that oncological patients are followed up by their dermatologists even if the clinics are closed. Teledermatology represents a crucial means of communication. Patients can contact the dermatological staff by emails and telephone, 24 h a day, 7 days a week, for video calls and dermatological consultations.","Cinelli, Eleonora; Fabbrocini, Gabriella; Fattore, Davide; Marasca, Claudio; Damiani, Giovanni; Annunziata, Maria Carmela",Support Care Cancer,,33

In this blinded randomized clinical trial (EudraCT 2021-002348-57) we compare the efficacy and safety of an additional booster vaccination with a vector versus mRNA vaccine in non-seroconverted patients. We assigned 60 patients under rituximab treatment, who did not seroconvert after their primary mRNA vaccination with either BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) or mRNA-1273 (Moderna), to receive a third dose, either using the same mRNA or the vector vaccine ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (Oxford-AstraZeneca). Patients were stratified according to the presence of peripheral B-cells. The primary efficacy endpoint was the difference in the SARS-CoV-2 antibody seroconversion rate between vector (heterologous) and mRNA (homologous) vaccinated patients by week four. Key secondary endpoints included the overall seroconversion and cellular immune response; safety was assessed at weeks one and four. Seroconversion rates at week four were comparable between vector (6/27 patients, 22%) and mRNA (9/28, 32%) vaccine (p=0.6). Overall, 27% of patients seroconverted; specific T-cell responses were observed in 20/20 (100%) vector versus 13/16 (81%) mRNA vaccinated patients. Newly induced humoral and/or cellular responses occurred in 9/11 (82%) patients. No serious adverse events, related to immunization, were observed. This enhanced humoral and/or cellular immune response supports an additional booster vaccination in non-seroconverted patients irrespective of a heterologous or homologous vaccination regimen.","Bonelli, Michael; Mrak, Daniel; Tobudic, Selma; Sieghart, Daniela; Koblischke, Maximilian; Mandl, Peter; Kornek, Barbara; Simader, Elisabeth; Radner, Helga; Perkmann, Thomas; Haslacher, Helmuth; Mayer, Margareta; Hofer, Philipp; Redlich, Kurt; Husar-Memmer, Emma; Fritsch-Stork, Ruth; Thalhammer, Renate; Stiasny, Karin; Winkler, Stefan; Smolen, Josef S.; Aberle, Judith H.; Zeitlinger, Markus; Heinz, Leonhard X.; Aletaha, Daniel",,,33

Articles were posted on many official WeChat accounts to transmit health information about this pandemic. The public also sought related information via social media more frequently. However, little is known about what kinds of information satisfy them better. This study aimed to explore the characteristics of health information dissemination that affected users' information behavior on WeChat. Methods: Two-wave data were collected from the top 200 WeChat official accounts on the Xigua website. The data included the change in the number of followers and the total number of likes on each account in a 7-day period, as well as the number of each type of article and headlines about coronavirus. It was used to developed regression models and conduct content analysis to figure out information characteristics in quantity and content. Results: For nonmedical institution accounts in the model, report and story types of articles had positive effects on users' following behaviors. The number of headlines on coronavirus positively impacts liking behaviors. For medical institution accounts, report and science types had a positive effect, too. In the content analysis, several common characteristics were identified. Conclusions: Characteristics in terms of the quantity and content in health information dissemination contribute to users' information behavior. In terms of the content in the headlines, via coding and word frequency analysis, organizational structure, multimedia applications, and instructions-the common dimension in different articles-composed the common features in information that impacted users' liking behaviors.","Ma, Rongyang; Deng, Zhaohua; Wu, Manli",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,33

The study objective was to assess 30-day outcomes (ED revisit, admission, ICU admission, and death) for low-risk patients discharged after ED evaluation for COVID-19. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study of patients triaged to a COVID-19 surge area within an urban ED and discharged between March 12 and April 6. Physicians were encouraged to discharge patients if they were well-appearing with few comorbidities. Data were collected from review of medical records and phone follow-up, and the analysis was descriptive. Results: Of 452 patients, the median age was 38, and 61.7% had no comorbidities. Chest radiographs were performed for 50.4% of patients and showed infiltrates in 14% of those tested. Polymerase chain reaction testing was performed for 28.3% of patients during the index ED visit and was positive in 35.9% of those tested. Follow-up was achieved for 75.4% of patients. ED revisits occurred for 13.7% of patients. The inpatient admission rate at 30 days was 4.6%, with 0.7% requiring intensive care. Median number of days between index ED evaluation and return for admission was 5 (interquartile range 3-7, range 1-17). There were no known deaths. Conclusions: A minority of low-risk patients with suspected COVID-19 will require hospitalization after being discharged home from the ED.

In this paper, we explore strategies that such institutions can adopt to conduct safe reopening and resume operations during the pandemic. The research is motivated by the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign's (UIUC's) SHIELD program, which is a set of policies and strategies, including rapid saliva-based COVID-19 screening, for ensuring safety of students, faculty and staff to conduct in-person operations, at least partially. Specifically, we study how rapid bulk testing, contact tracing and preventative measures such as mask wearing, sanitization, and enforcement of social distancing can allow institutions to manage the epidemic spread. This work combines the power of analytical epidemic modeling, data analysis and agent-based simulations to derive policy insights. We develop an analytical model that takes into account the asymptomatic transmission of COVID-19, the effect of isolation via testing (both in bulk and through contact tracing) and the rate of contacts among people within and outside the institution. Next, we use data from the UIUC SHIELD program and 85 other universities to estimate parameters that describe the analytical model. Using the estimated parameters, we finally conduct agent-based simulations with various model parameters to evaluate testing and reopening strategies. The parameter estimates from UIUC and other universities show similar trends. For example, infection rates at various institutions grow rapidly in certain months and this growth correlates positively with infection rates in counties where the universities are located. Infection rates are also shown to be negatively correlated with testing rates at the institutions. Through agent-based simulations, we demonstrate that the key to designing an effective reopening strategy is a combination of rapid bulk testing and effective preventative measures such as mask wearing and social distancing. Multiple other factors help to reduce infection load, such as efficient contact tracing, reduced delay between testing and result revelation, tests with less false negatives and targeted testing of high-risk class among others. This paper contributes to the nascent literature on combating the COVID-19 pandemic and is especially relevant for educational institutions and similarly large organizations. We contribute by providing an analytical model that can be used to estimate key parameters from data, which in turn can be used to simulate the effect of different strategies for reopening. We quantify the relative effect of different strategies such as bulk testing, contact tracing, reduced infectivity and contact rates in the context of educational institutions. Specifically, we show that for the estimated average base infectivity of 0.025 ([Formula: see text]), a daily number of tests to population ratio T/N of 0.2, i.e., once a week testing for all individuals, is a good indicative threshold. However, this test to population ratio is sensitive to external infectivities, internal and external mobilities, delay in getting results after testing, and measures related to mask wearing and sanitization, which affect the base infection rate.","Mukherjee, Ujjal K; Bose, Subhonmesh; Ivanov, Anton; Souyris, Sebastian; Seshadri, Sridhar; Sridhar, Padmavati; Watkins, Ronald; Xu, Yuqian",Sci Rep,,33

Increasing demands, user-user and user-environment conflicts occur throughout the area. The three countries, which are parties to the Benguela Current Convention (BCC), have begun to implement Marine Spatial Planning (MSP) to support the sustainable development of the area and enhance ocean governance. This makes the region one of the first in a developing economies context and on the African continent to introduce MSP. The article (1) traces the origin of MSP in the region and describes the reasons for its development, (2) reviews the status of MSP processes to date at the regional and national level, and (3) reflects on the regional and individual country processes in terms of differences and similarities in approach and process governance, shared opportunities and difficulties. The study finds that MSP in the region is introduced because of both strong interests to use it as a means to help grow the blue/ocean economy and as a mechanism to further the implementation of the ecosystem approach. Similar steps have been taken so far and alike approaches to MSP exist across the three countries, with the BCC as regional convention facilitating knowledge sharing and assisting to improve cross-border coherence and consistency on MSP from the outset. Although challenges, such as limited finances and data gaps exist both at national and regional level, the MSP processes to-date have created an enabling environment to develop the first marine spatial plans in each country and to exchange knowledge and experiences within the region and with other regions.","Finke, Gunnar; Gee, Kira; Gxaba, Thandiwe; Sorgenfrei, Roman; Russo, Vladimir; Pinto, Duarte; Nsiangango, Silvi Edith; Sousa, Lia Neto; Braby, Rodney; Alves, Fátima Lopes; Heinrichs, Bernhard; Kreiner, Anja; Amunyela, Maria; Popose, Gcobani; Ramakulukusha, Moses; Naidoo, Ashley; Mausolf, Elisabeth; Nsingi, Kumbi Kilongo",Environmental development,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2211464520300919; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211464520300919?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envdev.2020.100569; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33457197/,33

DESIGN AND METHODS: KPIs regarding the global POCT process, extra-analytical phase, quality assurance and staff training and competency were evaluated for blood gases, HbA1c, sweat test and non-connected and connected glucose in an ISO 22870 accredited network. We established the definition of every KPI and its corresponding target. The results of KPIs from all clinical settings were appraised every month during the study period, taking corrective actions when necessary. RESULTS: Annual global results were generally acceptable. However, some clinical areas displayed deviations in specific months. The monitoring of these KPIs allowed us to detect the deviations immediately and identify their causes.

This paper defines the term lockdown and describes the design, timing and implementation of lockdown in nine countries in Sub Saharan Africa: Ghana, Nigeria, South Africa, Sierra Leone, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe. It also discusses the manner in which lockdown is enforced, the need to mitigate the harms of lockdown, and the association between lockdown and the reported number of COVID-19 cases and deaths. While there are some commonalities in the implementation of lockdown, a more notable finding is the variation in the design, timing and implementation of lockdown measures across the nine countries. We found that the number of reported cases is heavily dependent on the number of tests done, and that testing rates ranged from 9 to 21,261 per million population. The reported number of COVID-19 deaths per million population also varies, but is generally low when compared to countries in Europe and North America. While lockdown measures may have helped inhibit some community transmission, the pattern and nature of the epidemic remains unclear. Of concern are signs of lockdown harming health by affecting the functioning of the health system and causing social and economic harms.

This aid aims to optimize the referral to and use of EBSCIs in primary care and to increase adherence to Dutch guidelines for smoking cessation. METHODS: Practice nurses (PNs) will be randomly allocated to an experimental condition or control condition, and will then recruit smoking patients who show a willingness to quit smoking within six months. PNs allocated to the experimental condition will provide smoking cessation guidance in accordance with the referral aid. Patients from both conditions will receive questionnaires at baseline and after six months. Cessation effectiveness will be tested via multilevel logistic regression analyses. Multiple imputations as well as intention to treat analysis will be performed. Intervention appreciation and level of informed decision-making will be compared using analysis of (co)variance. Predictors for appreciation and informed decision-making will be assessed using multiple linear regression analysis and/or structural equation modeling. Finally, a cost-effectiveness study will be conducted. DISCUSSION: This paper describes the study design for the development and evaluation of an information and decision tool to support PNs in their guidance of smoking patients and their referral to EBSCIs. The study aims to provide insight into the (cost) effectiveness of an intervention aimed at expediting the use of EBSCIs in primary care.","Zijlstra, Daniëlle N.; Muris, Jean W.M.; Bolman, Catherine; Elling, J.

The virus’ non-structural proteins are promising drug targets because of their vital role in the viral cycle. A significant body of work has been focused on finding inhibitors which covalently and competitively bind the active site of the non-structural proteins, but little has been done to address regions other than the active site, i.e. for non-competitive inhibition. Here we extend previous work on the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro (nsp5) to three other SARS-CoV-2 proteins: host shutoff factor (nsp1), papain-like protease (nsp3, also known as PLpro) and RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (nsp12, also known as RdRp) in complex with nsp7 and nsp8 cofactors. Using open-source software (DDPT) to construct Elastic Network Models (ENM) of the chosen proteins we analyse their fluctuation dynamics and thermodynamics, as well as using this protein family to study convergence and robustness of the ENM. Exhaustive 2-point mutational scans of the ENM and their effect on fluctuation free energies suggest several new candidate regions, distant from the active site, for control of the proteins’ function, which may assist the drug development based on the current small molecule binding screens. The results also provide new insights, including non-additive effects of double-mutation or inhibition, into the active biophysical research field of protein fluctuation allostery and its underpinning dynamical structure.","Dubanevics, Igors; Heaton, Charles; Riechmann, Carlos; McLeish, Tom C.B.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.12.422477,33

Two of these variants, sp-4 and JHM-X, were found to have smaller mRNA3 and E2 glycoprotein species compared with those of the other four variants. In addition, sp-4 and JHM-X were distinguished from the other four variants by their inability to bind to monoclonal antibodies recognizing two antigenic domains of the E2 molecule.

However, these methods are not always thoroughly tested or are applied only to a limited geographic range. Here, we present a method for near real time monitoring of Re, applied to epidemic data from 170 countries. We thoroughly validate the method on simulated data, and present an intuitive web interface for interactive data exploration. We show that in the majority of countries the estimated Re dropped below 1 only after the introduction of major non-pharmaceutical interventions. For Europe, Asia, and North America we found that the implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions was associated with reductions in the effective reproductive number. Globally, we found that relaxing non-pharmaceutical interventions did not fully revert Re values to their original levels. Generally, our framework is useful both to inform governments and the general public on the status of the epidemic in their country, as well as a source for detailed comparison between countries and in relation to local public health policies and external covariates such as mobility, behavioural, or weather data.","Huisman, J.

Two mRNA vaccines have been approved for emergency use by the FDA and have demonstrated extraordinary effectiveness. The success of these mRNA vaccines establishes the speed of development and therapeutic potential of mRNA. These authorized vaccines encode full-length versions of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. They are formulated with lipid nanoparticle (LNP) delivery vehicles that have inherent immunostimulatory properties. Different vaccination strategies and alternative mRNA delivery vehicles would be desirable to ensure flexibility of future generations of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and the development of mRNA vaccines in general. Here, we report on the development of an alternative mRNA vaccine approach using a delivery vehicle called charge-altering releasable transporters (CARTs). Using these inherently nonimmunogenic vehicles, we can tailor the vaccine immunogenicity by inclusion of coformulated adjuvants such as oligodeoxynucleotides with CpG motifs (CpG-ODN). Mice vaccinated with the mRNA-CART vaccine developed therapeutically relevant levels of receptor binding domain (RBD)-specific neutralizing antibodies in both the circulation and in the lung bronchial fluids.

It is estimated that at least 50% of older adults in the U.S. have pets; while pets may be a source of support, they could also pose unique challenges during an already trying time. We aimed to investigate how pets impacted the everyday lives of older adults in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A large survey of U.S. pet owners (n = 2,068) was administered to assess the impact of relationships with pets during COVID-19 on human health and well-being. We conducted bivariate analyses to compare levels of social support, loneliness, pet attachment, and family income for a subset of older adults (ages 65 and older) with a younger comparison group (ages 18–64). Using thematic and content analysis, we analyzed two open-ended prompts from age 65+ respondents (n = 122): (1) the pros and cons of living with pets during the pandemic, and (2) advice for those living with pets in future pandemics. Results: Older adults, on average, reported lower levels of social support and less loneliness than respondents below age 65. There were no significant differences in strength of attachment to pets nor income between the younger and older respondents. For the open-ended prompt regarding pros and cons, we coded three emerging themes and related sub-themes: (1) pros (company; more time together; life purpose or meaning; love; support; stress relief; routine; distraction; exercise), (2) cons (general worry; potential for illness; limited participation; veterinary care access; obtaining supplies; difficulty meeting pet needs; financial concerns), and (3) no difference. Advice shared was coded into 13 themes/sub-themes: pets' health and welfare; make plans; veterinary information; treat pets like family; don't abandon pets; human health and well-being; stay calm; enjoy pets; keep routine; be careful of transmission; seek community resources; keep supplies stocked; and finances. Conclusions: Pets may fulfill some social and emotional needs for older adults during this particularly isolating event; equally important to consider are the challenges that may be precipitated by and/or exacerbated by this public health emergency.","Applebaum, Jennifer W.; Ellison, Carlyn; Struckmeyer, Linda; Zsembik, Barbara A.; McDonald, Shelby E.",Front Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33898382/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.652610,33

Caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and primarily manifesting as an acute respiratory failure with interstitial and alveolar pneumonia, it can also affect multiple organs. Kidney involvement was underestimated in early reports and its role remains controversial. The aim of this study was to analyse the role of kidney damage in COVID-19 outcome. METHODS: This is a prospective cohort study of 1603 consecutive patients admitted in a University Reference Hospital in the heart of the European outbreak. RESULTS: Median age was 64 years, 40.4% were female, 15.2% presented diabetes mellitus, 35.7% hypertension and 20.3% obesity. On admission, the prevalence of elevated serum creatinine (sCr), proteinuria, leucocyturia and haematuria were 21.0, 37.8, 31.8 and 45.6%, respectively. In total, 43.5% of those with an elevated sCr had previous chronic kidney disease (CKD) and 11.4% of those with normal sCr developed an in-hospital acute kidney injury (AKI); 17 patients needed acute haemodialysis; and 197 patients died during hospitalization. Cox proportional hazard regression confirmed that elevated baseline sCr [hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) 2.40 (1.79–3.22)], previous CKD [1.59 (1.06-2.37)], haematuria [1 + 1.68 (0.92–3.06), 2–3 + 2.69 (1.49–4.87)] and in-hospital AKI [1.50 (0.92–2.44)] were independent risk factors for in-hospital death after adjusting for age, sex and comorbidity.

This activity is being developed as a potential antiviral therapeutic strategy. Studies in vitro, and some in vivo, appear to show the feasibility of using RNAi to treat virus infection. Therapeutic use of RNAi seems to be promising when directed against viruses that cause localized acute infections in accessible target cells. Therapeutic strategies using RNAi against viruses that cause chronic infections, such as HIV, hepatitis B virus, or hepatitis C virus, are more difficult to design, but studies have begun to address identifiable problems. Two clinical trials using RNAi have recently been initiated—one phase II trial against respiratory syncytial virus and a phase I trial against HIV.

Methods - We investigated for SARS-CoV-2 presence in heart tissue autopsies of 6 consecutive COVID-19 patients deceased for respiratory failure showing no signs of cardiac involvement and with no history of heart disease. Cardiac autopsy samples were analysed by digital PCR, Western blot, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, RNAScope, and transmission electron microscopy assays. Results - The presence of SARS-CoV-2 into cardiomyocytes was invariably detected. A variable pattern of cardiomyocytes injury was observed, spanning from the absence of cell death and subcellular alterations hallmarks to the intracellular oedema and sarcomere ruptures. In addition, we found active viral transcription in cardiomyocytes, by detecting both sense and antisense SARS-CoV-2 spike RNA. Conclusions - In this analysis of autopsy cases, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 into cardiomyocytes, determining variable patterns of intracellular involvement, has been documented.

600570,From apparent to true – from frequency to distributions (II),2020-08-11,"[Image: see text] In recent years, a steadily growing number of chemists, from both academia and industry, have dedicated their research to the development of continuous flow processes performed in milli- or microreactors. The common availability of continuous flow equipment at virtually all scales and affordable cost has additionally impacted this trend. Furthermore, regulatory agencies such as the United States Food and Drug Administration actively encourage continuous manufacturing of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) with the vision of quality and productivity improvements. That is why the pharmaceutical industry is progressively implementing continuous flow technologies. As a result of the exceptional characteristics of continuous flow reactors such as small reactor volumes and remarkably fast heat and mass transfer, process conditions which need to be avoided in conventional batch syntheses can be safely employed. Thus, continuous operation is particularly advantageous for reactions at high temperatures/pressures (novel process windows) and for ultrafast, exothermic reactions (flash chemistry). In addition to conditions that are outside of the operation range of conventional stirred tank reactors, reagents possessing a high hazard potential and therefore not amenable to batch processing can be safely utilized (forbidden chemistry). Because of the small reactor volumes, risks in case of a failure are minimized. Such hazardous reagents often are low molecular weight compounds, leading generally to the most atom-, time-, and cost-efficient route toward the desired product. Ideally, they are generated from benign, readily available and cheap precursors within the closed environment of the flow reactor on-site on-demand. By doing so, the transport, storage, and handling of those compounds, which impose a certain safety risk especially on a large scale, are circumvented. This strategy also positively impacts the global supply chain dependency, which can be a severe issue, particularly in times of stricter safety regulations or an epidemic. The concept of the in situ production of a hazardous material is generally referred to as the “generator” of the material. Importantly, in an integrated flow process, multiple modules can be assembled consecutively, allowing not only an in-line purification/separation and quenching of the reagent, but also its downstream conversion to a nonhazardous product. For the past decade, research in our group has focused on the continuous generation of hazardous reagents using a range of reactor designs and experimental techniques, particularly toward the synthesis of APIs. In this Account, we therefore introduce chemical generator concepts that have been developed in our laboratories for the production of toxic, explosive, and short-lived reagents. We have defined three different classes of generators depending on the reactivity/stability of the reagents, featuring reagents such as Br(2), HCN, peracids, diazomethane (CH(2)N(2)), or hydrazoic acid (HN(3)). The various reactor designs, including in-line membrane separation techniques and real-time process analytical technologies for the generation, purification, and monitoring of those hazardous reagents, and also their downstream transformations are presented. This Account should serve as food for thought to extend the scope of chemical generators for accomplishing more efficient and more economic processes.","Dallinger, Doris; Gutmann, Bernhard; Kappe, C.

However, despite the utmost relevance of quality and safety standards and their role for sustaining the innovation pathway of DHT, their actual making has not yet been subjected to in-depth social-science scrutiny. Drawing on the conceptual repertoires of Science and Technology Studies (STS), this article investigates how digital health evolved from a buzzword into an ‘object of government’, or gained material meaning and transformed into a regulatable object, by charting the standard-making process of FDA’s medical digital health policy between 2008 and 2018. From this, we reflect on the mutually sustaining dynamics between technological and organizational innovation, as the FDA’s attempts to standardize medical DHT not only shaped the lifestyle/medical boundary for DHT.

The new virus has spread to at least 316 cities (until 1st February 2020) in China. We used the traffic flow data from Baidu Map, and number of air passengers who left Wuhan from 1st January to 26th January, to quantify the potential infectious people. We developed multiple linear models with local population and air passengers as predicted variables to explain the variance of confirmed cases in every city across China. We found the contribution of air passengers from Wuhan was decreasing gradually, but the effect of local population was increasing, indicating the trend of local transmission. However, the increase of local transmission is slow during the early stage of novel coronavirus, due to the super strict control measures carried out by government agents and communities.","Zhao, Xumao; Liu, Xiang; Li, Xinhai",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.07.20021196,33
603569,"Patient’s Perspectives of Telepsychiatry: The Past, Present and Future",2020-11-01,"Abstract Background COVID-19 disease is becoming a global pandemic and more than 200 countries were affected because of this disease. Italy is one of the countries is largely suffered with this virus outbreak, and about 180,000 cases were registered which explains the large transmissibility and reproduction case numbers. Objective In this study, we considered the Marche region of Italy to compute different daily transmission rates (Rt) including five provinces in it. We also present forecasting of daily and cumulative incidences associated after the next thirty days. The Marche region is the 8th in terms of number of people infected in Italy and the first in terms of diffusion of the infection among the 4 regions of the center of Italy. Methods Epidemic statistics were extracted from the national Italian Health Ministry website. We considered outbreak information where the first case registered with onset symptoms (26 February 2020) to the present date (20 April 2020). Adoption of incidence and projections with R statistics was done. Results The median values of Rt for the five provinces of Pesaro and Urbano, Ancona, Fermo, Ascoli Piceno, and Macerata, was 2.492 (1.1-4.5), 2.162 (1.0-4.0), 1.512 (0.75-2.75), 1.141 (1.0-1.6), and 1.792 (1.0-3.5) with 95% of CI achieved. The projections at end of 30th day of the cumulative incidences 323 (95% CI), and daily incidences 45 (95% CI) might be reached. Conclusions This study highlights the knowledge of essential insights into the Marche region in particular to virus transmission dynamics, geographical characteristics of positive incidences, and the necessity of implementing mitigation procedures to fight against the COVID-19 outbreak.","Chintalapudi, Nalini; Battineni, Gopi; Sagaro, Getu Gamo; Amenta, Francesco",Int J Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.05.029; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32437930/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971220303362?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971220303362,33

In recent years, RdRp has emerged as an optimal target for the development of antiviral drugs, as demonstrated by recent approvals of sofosbuvir and remdesivir against Hepatitis C virus (HCV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), respectively. In this work, we overview the main sequence and structural features of the RdRp of emerging RNA viruses such as Coronaviruses, Flaviviruses, and HCV, as well as inhibition strategies implemented so far. While analyzing the structural information available on the RdRp of emerging RNA viruses, we provide examples of success stories such as for HCV and SARS-CoV-2. In contrast, Flaviviruses’ story has raised attention about how the lack of structural details on catalytically-competent or ligand-bound RdRp strongly hampers the application of structure-based drug design, either in repurposing and conventional approaches.","Picarazzi, Francesca; Vicenti, Ilaria; Saladini, Francesco; Zazzi, Maurizio; Mori, Mattia",Molecules,https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules25235695; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33287144/,33
604646,COVAX: more than a beautiful idea,2021,"BACKGROUND: In April 2020, two independent clinical trials to assess SARS-CoV-2 prophylaxis strategies among health care workers were initiated at our hospital: MeCOVID (melatonin vs placebo) and EPICOS (tenofovir disoproxil/emtricitabine vs hydroxychloroquine vs combination therapy vs placebo). OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the reasons why health care workers chose to participate in the MeCOVID and EPICOS trials, as well as why they chose one over the other. METHODS: Both trials were offered to health care workers through an internal news bulletin. After an initial screening visit, all subjects were asked to respond to a web-based survey. RESULTS: In the first month, 206 health care workers were screened and 160 were randomized. The survey participation was high at 73.3%. Health care workers cited “to contribute to scientific knowledge” (n=80, 53.0%), followed by “to avoid SARS-CoV-2 infection” (n=33, 21.9%) and “the interest to be tested for SARS-CoV-2” (n=28, 18.5%), as their primary reasons to participate in the trials. We observed significant differences in the expected personal benefits across physicians and nurses (P=.01). The vast majority of volunteers (n=202, 98.0%) selected the MeCOVID trial, their primary reason being their concern regarding adverse reactions to treatments in the EPICOS trial (n=102, 69.4%). CONCLUSIONS: Health care workers’ reasons to participate in prophylaxis trials in an acute pandemic context appear to be driven largely by their desire to contribute to science and to gain health benefits. Safety outweighed efficacy when choosing between the two clinical trials.","Borobia, Alberto M; García-García, Irene; Díaz-García, Lucía; Rodríguez-Mariblanca, Amelia; Martínez de Soto, Lucía; Monserrat Villatoro, Jaime; Seco Meseguer, Enrique; González, Juan J; Frías Iniesta, Jesús; Ramírez García, Elena; Arribas, Jose Ramón; Carcas-Sansuán, Antonio J",J Med Internet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33556032/; https://doi.org/10.2196/23441,33
604651,Diagnosis of breast cancer based on modern mammography using hybrid transfer learning,2021-01-11,"Importance: Seroprevalence studies complement data on detected cases and attributed deaths in assessing the cumulative spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Objective: To estimate seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in patients receiving dialysis and adults in the US in January 2021 before the widespread introduction of COVID-19 vaccines. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study used data from the third largest US dialysis organization (US Renal Care), which has facilities located nationwide, to estimate SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence among US patients receiving dialysis. Remainder plasma (ie, plasma that would have otherwise been discarded) of all patients receiving dialysis at US Renal Care facilities from January 1 to 31, 2021, was tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Patients were excluded if they had a documented dose of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination or if a residence zip code was missing from electronic medical records. Crude seroprevalence estimates from this sample (January 2021) were standardized to the US adult population using the 2018 American Community Survey 1-year estimates and stratified by age group, sex, self-reported race/ethnicity, neighborhood race/ethnicity composition, neighborhood income level, and urban or rural status. These data and case detection rates were then compared with data from a July 2020 subsample of patients who received dialysis at the same facilities. Exposures: Age, sex, race/ethnicity, and region of residence as well as neighborhood race/ethnicity composition, poverty, population density, and urban or rural status. Main Outcomes and Measures: The spike protein receptor-binding domain total antibody assay (Siemens Healthineers; manufacturer-reported sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 99.8%) was used to estimate crude SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in the unweighted sample, and then the estimated seroprevalence rates for the US dialysis and adult populations were calculated, adjusting for age, sex, and region. Results: A total of 21 464 patients (mean [SD] age, 63.1 [14.2] years; 12 265 men [57%]) were included in the unweighted sample from January 2021. The patients were disproportionately older (aged 65-79 years, 7847 [37%]; aged &#8805;80 years, 2668 [12%]) and members of racial/ethnic minority groups (Hispanic patients, 2945 [18%]; non-Hispanic Black patients, 4875 [29%]). Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was 18.9% (95% CI, 18.3%-19.5%) in the sample, with a seroprevalence of 18.7% (95% CI, 18.1%-19.2%) standardized to the US dialysis population, and 21.3% (95% CI, 20.3%-22.3%) standardized to the US adult population. In the unweighted sample, younger persons (aged 18-44 years, 25.9%; 95% CI, 24.1%-27.8%), those who self-identified as Hispanic or living in Hispanic neighborhoods (25.1%; 95% CI, 23.6%-26.4%), and those living in the lowest-income neighborhoods (24.8%; 95% CI, 23.2%-26.5%) were among the subgroups with the highest seroprevalence. Little variability was observed in seroprevalence by geographic region, population density, and urban or rural status in the January 2021 sample (largest regional difference, 1.2 [95% CI, 1.1-1.3] higher odds of seroprevalence in residents of the Northeast vs West). Conclusions and Relevance: In this cross-sectional study of patients receiving dialysis in the US, fewer than 1 in 4 patients had evidence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies 1 year after the first case of SARS-CoV-2 infection was detected in the US. Results standardized to the US population indicate similar prevalence of antibodies among US adults. Vaccine introduction to younger individuals, those living in neighborhoods with a large population of racial/ethnic minority residents, and those living in low-income neighborhoods may be critical to disrupting the spread of infection.","Anand, Shuchi; Montez-Rath, Maria; Han, Jialin; Cadden, LinaCel; Hunsader, Patti; Kerschmann, Russell; Beyer, Paul; Boyd, Scott D; Garcia, Pablo; Dittrich, Mary; Block, Geoffrey A; Parsonnet, Julie; Chertow, Glenn M",JAMA Netw Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34251441/; https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.16572,33

STUDY DESIGN: Prospective observational cohort study METHODS: Adults with confirmed COVID-19 who were admitted into fourteen participating acute hospitals across ROI and referred to speech and language therapy between March 1st to June 30th 2020 were recruited. Outcomes obtained at initial SLT evaluation and at discharge were oral intake status (Functional Oral Intake Scale), perceptual voice quality (GRBAS), and global dysarthria rating (Dysarthria Severity Scale). RESULTS: Data from 315 adults were analysed. At initial SLT assessment, 84% required modified oral diets, and 31% required tube feeding. There were high rates of dysphonia (42%) and dysarthria (23%). History of intubation (OR 19.959, 95% CI 6.272, 63.513; p=.000), COVID-19 neurological manifestations (OR 3.592, 95% CI 1.733, 7.445; p=.001) and age (OR 1.034; 95% CI 1.002, 1.066; p=0.036) were predictive of oral intake status. History of intubation was predictive of voice quality (OR 4.250, 95% CI 1.838, 9.827; p=.001) and COVID-19 neurological manifestations were predictive of dysarthria (OR 2.275; 95% CI 1.162, 4.456; p=0.017). At discharge, there were significant improvements in oral intake (Z=-7.971; p=.000), voice quality (Z=-5.971; p=.000), and dysarthria severity (Z=-2.619; p=0.009), although need for modified oral intake (59%), dysphonia (23%) and dysarthria (14%) persisted.

Results: Over the study period, 164,202 new sickness absence episodes for mental ill health were recorded in 12.5% (119,525) of the study sample. There was a spike of sickness absence for mental ill health in March-April 2020 (899,730 days lost) compared with 519,807 days in March and April 2019; the surge was driven by an increase in new episodes of long-term absence and had diminished by May and June 2020. The increase was greatest in those aged >60 years (227%) and among employees of Asian and Black ethnic origin (109%-136%). Among doctors and dentists the number of days absent declined by 12.7%. The biggest increase was in London (122%) and the smallest in the East Midlands (43.7%); the variation between regions reflected the rates of Covid19 sickness absence during the same period. Conclusion: Although the Covid19 epidemic led to an increase in sickness absence attributed to mental ill health in NHS staff, this had substantially declined by May and June 2020, corresponding with the decrease in pressures at work as the first wave of the epidemic subsided.","van der Plaat, D.; Edge, R.; Coggon, D.; van Tongersen, M.; Muiry, R.; Parsons, V.; Cullinan, P.; Madan, I.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.09.21258629; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.09.21258629v1?rss=1,33
605617,Acute systemic DNA damage in youth does not impair immune defense with aging,2016-04-13,"We have reported on aristeromycin (1) and 6′-fluorinated-aristeromycin analogues (2), which are active against RNA viruses such as Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Zika virus (ZIKV), and Chikungunya virus (CHIKV). However, these exhibit substantial cytotoxicity. As this cytotoxicity may be attributed to 5′-phosphorylation, we designed and synthesized one-carbon homologated 6′-fluorinated-aristeromycin analogues. This modification prevents 5′-phosphorlyation by cellular kinases, whereas the inhibitory activity towards S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine (SAH) hydrolase will be retained. The enantiomerically pure 6′-fluorinated-5′-homoaristeromycin analogues 3a-e were synthesized via the electrophilic fluorination of the silyl enol ether with Selectfluor, using a base-build up approach as the key steps. All synthesized compounds exhibited potent inhibitory activity towards SAH hydrolase, among which 6′-β-fluoroadenosine analogue 3a was the most potent (IC(50) = 0.36 μM). Among the compounds tested, 6′-β-fluoro-homoaristeromycin 3a showed potent antiviral activity (EC(50) = 0.12 μM) against the CHIKV, without noticeable cytotoxicity up to 250 μM. Only 3a displayed anti-CHIKV activity, whereas both3a and 3b inhibited SAH hydrolase with similar IC(50) values (0.36 and 0.37 μM, respectively), which suggested that 3a’s antiviral activity did not merely depend on the inhibition of SAH hydrolase. This is further supported by the fact that the antiviral effect was specific for CHIKV and some other alphaviruses and none of the homologated analogues inhibited other RNA viruses, such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and ZIKV. The potent inhibition and high selectivity index make 6′-β-fluoro-homoaristeromycin (3a) a promising new template for the development of antivirals against CHIKV, a serious re-emerging pathogen that has infected millions of people over the past 15 years.","Shin, Young Sup; Jarhad, Dnyandev B.; Jang, Min Hwan; Kovacikova, Kristina; Kim, Gyudong; Yoon, Ji-seong; Kim, Hong-Rae; Hyun, Young Eum; Tipnis, Amol S.; Chang, Tong-Shin; van Hemert, Martijn J.; Jeong, Lak Shin",Eur J Med Chem,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejmech.2019.111956; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31841728/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0223523419311080; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0223523419311080,33

The first step of the infection mechanism of the SARS-CoV-2 in the human host is adhesion, which occurs through the S glycoprotein that is found in diverse human organs. Another way through which SARS-CoV-2 could possibly attach to the host’s cells is by means of the histo-blood group antigens. In this work, we have reviewed the mechanisms by which some viruses bind to the histo-blood group antigens, which could be related to the susceptibility of the individual and are dependent on the histo-blood group.","Cuéllar-Cruz, Mayra",Future Microbiol,https://doi.org/10.2217/fmb-2020-0158; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33459559/,33

In the present study, two types (type 1 and 2) of an ICT kit were evaluated for detection of rabies. These were developed using monoclonal antibodies which recognize epitope II and III of the nucleoprotein of rabies virus. Both kits specifically detected all rabies virus strains and there was no cross reactivity with Lyssaviruses (Lagos, Mokola and Duvenhage), Rhabdovirus (VSV and Oita 296/1972) and other common canine‐pathogenic viruses. In type 1, a single type of monoclonal antibody was used. It was capable of detecting recombinant nucleoprotein and showed sensitivity of 95.5% (42/44) and specificity of 88.9% (32/36) using brain samples from rabid dogs. In contrast, type 2 which was made of two different monoclonal antibodies had a lower sensitivity of 93.2% (41/44) and higher specificity of 100% (36/36). These ICT kits provide a simple and rapid method for rabies detection. They need neither cold chain for transportation nor complicated training for personnel. This diagnostic test is suitable for rabies screening, particularly in areas with a high prevalence of rabies and where the fluorescent antibody test is not available.","Nishizono, Akira; Khawplod, Pakamatz; Ahmed, Kamruddin; Goto, Kazuyo; Shiota, Seiji; Mifune, Kumato; Yasui, Takehito; Takayama, Katsuyoshi; Kobayashi, Yukuharu; Mannen, Kazuaki; Tepsumethanon, Veera; Mitmoonpitak, Chanarong; Inoue, Satoshi; Morimoto, Kinjiro",Microbiol Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18426399/; https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1348-0421.2008.00031.x,33

METHODS: This study is a single‐center, retrospective, observational study. Hospitalized COVID‐19 patients between 24/03/2020 and 31/05/2020 were included in the study. All patients were evaluated for renal dysfunctions with urine dipstick, protein/creatinine ratio, albumin/creatinine ratio in spot urine, serum cystatin C, serum creatinine level on hospital admission, and 28th day of hospital admission. To assess the utility of these parameters to predict AKI, a receiver‐operating characteristic curve was generated and the area under the curve (AUC) was calculated. RESULTS: 348 patients were included. The average incidence of AKI was 4.9% (n = 17). The incidence of AKI in mild, moderate and severe COVID‐19 cases was 1.3% (n = 4), 9.0% (n = 3) and 76.9% (n = 10), respectively. Proteinuria was detected in 7.8% (n = 27) of patients with a urine dipstick test. In spot urine analysis, proteinuria was found in 20.1% (n = 70) of patients. The frequency of persistent proteinuria was 5.2% (n = 18). The AUC alue of serum cystatin C, D‐dimer and albumin/creatinine ratio to predict COVID‐19 related AKI were 0.96 (0.90 to 1.0), 0.94 (0.89–0.98), and 0.95 (0.91–0.98). CONCLUSION: In COVID‐19 patients with normal serum creatinine levels on hospital admission, albuminuria, serum cystatin C and D‐dimer levels may be an early predictor of COVID‐19 related AKI and these patients should be monitored closely for AKI. Since the sample size in the AKI group was small, our study results should be confirmed with larger cohort studies.","Yildirim, Cigdem; Ozger, Hasan Selcuk; Yasar, Emre; Tombul, Nazrin; Gulbahar, Ozlem; Yildiz, Mehmet; Bozdayi, Gulendam; Derici, Ulver; Dizbay, Murat",Nephrology (Carlton),https://doi.org/10.1111/nep.13856; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33502771/,33

Community-acquired respiratory viruses (CARVs) pose a particular challenge due to the frequent exposure pre-, peri-, and posttransplantation. Although influenza A and B viruses have a top priority regarding prevention and treatment, recent molecular diagnostic tests detecting an array of other CARVs in real time have dramatically expanded our knowledge about the epidemiology, diversity, and impact of CARV infections in the general population and in allogeneic HCT and SOT patients. These data have demonstrated that non-influenza CARVs independently contribute to morbidity and mortality of transplant patients. However, effective vaccination and antiviral treatment is only emerging for non-influenza CARVs, placing emphasis on infection control and supportive measures. Here, we review the current knowledge about CARVs in SOT and allogeneic HCT patients to better define the magnitude of this unmet clinical need and to discuss some of the lessons learned from human influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenzavirus, rhinovirus, coronavirus, adenovirus, and bocavirus regarding diagnosis, prevention, and treatment.","Ison, Michael G.; Hirsch, Hans H.",Clin Microbiol Rev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31511250/; https://doi.org/10.1128/cmr.00042-19,33

His respiratory status declined despite initiation of standard treatments, prompting initiation of subcutaneous octreotide. Following initiation of this therapy, he rapidly improved and was discharged from the hospital 2 days later.

608558,EFORT Open Reviews: Turbulence,2020-10-26,"Australian strains of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) have been evolving independently for many years, with control achieved by vaccination with local attenuated strains. Previous studies have documented the emergence of recombinants over the last 20 years, with the most recent one, Ck/Aus/N1/08, detected in 2008. These recombinants did not appear to be controlled by the vaccines currently in use. In this study we sequenced the complete genomes of three emergent Australian strains of IBV (IBV/Ck/Aus/N1/88, IBV/Ck/Aus/N1/03 and IBV/Ck/Aus/N1/08) and a previously incompletely characterised vaccine strain, IBV/Ck/Aus/Armidale, and compared them to the genome of the vaccine strain VicS. We detected multiple recombination events throughout the genome between wild type viruses and the vaccine strains in all three emergent isolates. Moreover, we found that strain N1/88 was not entirely exogenous, as was previously hypothesised. Rather, it originated from a recombination event involving the VicS vaccine strain. The S glycoprotein genes of N1/88 and N1/03 were known to be genetically distinct from previously characterised circulating strains and from each other, and the original donors of these genes remains unknown. The S1 glycoprotein gene of N1/88, a subgroup 2 strain, shares a high nucleotide identity with the sequence of the S1 gene of the recent isolate N1/08. As the subgroup 2 strains have not been isolated for at least 20 years, it appears likely that an unknown avian coronavirus that was the donor of the S1 glycoprotein sequence of N1/88 in the 1980s is still recombining with IBV strains in the field.","Quinteros, José A.; Lee, Sang-Won; Markham, Philip F.; Noormohammadi, Amir H.; Hartley, Carol A.; Legione, Alistair R.; Coppo, Mauricio J.C.; Vaz, Paola K.; Browning, Glenn F.",Vet Microbiol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2016.11.003; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113516302693; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113516302693; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27938680/,33

Along with their resistant strains, new pathogenic viruses continue to be discovered so creating an ongoing need for new antiviral treatments. RNA interference is a cellular gene‐silencing phenomenon in which sequence‐specific degradation of target mRNA is achieved by means of complementary short interfering RNA (siRNA) molecules. Short interfering RNA technology affords a potential tractable strategy to combat viral pathogenesis because siRNAs are specific, easy to design, and can be directed against multiple strains of a virus by targeting their conserved gene regions. In this review, we briefly summarize the current status of siRNA therapy for representative examples from different virus families. In addition, other aspects like their design, delivery, medical significance, bioinformatics resources, and limitations are also discussed.","Qureshi, Abid; Tantray, Vaqar Gani; Kirmani, Altaf Rehman; Ahangar, Abdul Ghani",Rev Med Virol,https://doi.org/10.1002/rmv.1976; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29656441/,33

The new variant COVID-19 has started to spread rapidly since December 2019, posing a new threat to global health. To counter the spread of the virus, the Italian government forced the population to close all activities starting from 9 March 2020 to 4 May 2020. In this scenario, we conducted a cross-sectional study on a heterogeneous sample (average age of 28 ± 12 years, 62.6% females) of the University of Naples Federico II (Italy). The aim of the study was to describe the lifestyle change in the university population during quarantine for the COVID 19 pandemic. Participants compiled an online survey consisting of 3 sections: socio-demographic data, dietary behaviours, physical activity habits and psychological aspects. The different results by gender are: 90.8% of females continued to work from home (81.9% were students); 34.8% increased their physical activity; and, only 0.8% prefer ready meals. Whereas, the same percentage of men continued to work from home (90%), but only 72.1% were students (p < 0.001 vs. females), only 23.9% increased physical activity (p < 0.001) and 1.7% favous ready meals.

Every facility that provides obstetric service needs a certain level of preparedness to be able to handle at least Covid-suspect pregnant women awaiting test reports, who need to be managed as Covid-positive patients till reports are available. Thus, these facilities need to have triage areas and Covid-suspect labour rooms. Healthcare facilities can have designated areas for Covid-positive patients or have referral linkages with designated Covid-positive hospitals. Preparation includes structural reorganization with setting up a Covid-suspect and Covid-positive facility in adequate space, as well as extensive training of staff about infection control practices and rational use of personal protective equipment (PPE). A systematic approach involving five essential steps of making standard operating procedures, infrastructural reorganization for a triage area and a Covid-suspect labour ward, procurement of PPE, managing the personnel and instituting appropriate infection control practices can ensure uninterrupted services to patients without compromising the safety of healthcare providers.","Sharma, K Aparna; Dadhwal, Vatsla; Rana, Anubhuti; Singhal, Seema; Kumar, Sunesh; Bhatla, Neerja",Natl Med J India,https://doi.org/10.4103/0970-258x.321135; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34341213/,33

An online survey was used to collect data from 1291 respondents. The structural model was examined through the partial least square structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). The multi-group analysis (MGA) was conducted to understand the role of geographical areas in moderating all hypothetical relationships. The findings show that the respondents were not excited about online learning due to weak means (below 3) for most items of five variables; enjoyment, perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, attitude, and intention to use. All relationships were supported except the relationship between experience and perceived usefulness. The strongest significant relationship emerged between intention to use and actual use. Meanwhile, the least significant relationship was found between self-efficacy and perceived usefulness.

The dog was diagnosed with non-responsive enteropathy (NRE) based on clinical and histopathological examinations. Since the dog did not respond to the immunosuppressive drugs, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) was performed during the treatment with chlorambucil. A single endoscopic FMT into the cecum and colon drastically recovered clinical signs and clinicopathological abnormalities and corrected dysbiosis in the dog.

612217,Nkengasong tipped to lead PEPFAR.,2021-10-02,"The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a major role in COVID-19. Severity of several inflammation-related diseases has been associated with autoantibodies against RAS, particularly agonistic autoantibodies for angiotensin type-1 receptors (AA-AT1) and autoantibodies against ACE2 (AA-ACE2). Disease severity of COVID-19 patients was defined as mild, moderate or severe following the WHO Clinical Progression Scale and determined at medical discharge. Serum AA-AT1 and AA-ACE2 were measured in COVID-19 patients (n = 119) and non-infected controls (n = 23) using specific solid-phase, sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Serum LIGHT (TNFSF14; tumor necrosis factor ligand superfamily member 14) levels were measured with the corresponding assay kit. At diagnosis, AA-AT1 and AA-ACE2 levels were significantly higher in the COVID-19 group relative to controls, and we observed significant association between disease outcome and serum AA-AT1 and AA-ACE2 levels. Mild disease patients had significantly lower levels of AA-AT1 (p < 0.01) and AA-ACE2 (p < 0.001) than moderate and severe patients. No significant differences were detected between males and females. The increase in autoantibodies was not related to comorbidities potentially affecting COVID-19 severity. There was significant positive correlation between serum levels of AA-AT1 and LIGHT (TNFSF14; r(Pearson) = 0.70, p < 0.001). Both AA-AT1 (by agonistic stimulation of AT1 receptors) and AA-ACE2 (by reducing conversion of Angiotensin II into Angiotensin 1-7) may lead to increase in AT1 receptor activity, enhance proinflammatory responses and severity of COVID-19 outcome. Patients with high levels of autoantibodies require more cautious control after diagnosis. Additionally, the results encourage further studies on the possible protective treatment with AT1 receptor blockers in COVID-19.","Rodriguez-Perez, Ana I.; Labandeira, Carmen M.; Pedrosa, Maria A.; Valenzuela, Rita; Suarez-Quintanilla, Juan A.; Cortes-Ayaso, María; Mayán-Conesa, Placido; Labandeira-Garcia, Jose L.",J Autoimmun,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34144328/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0896841121000913; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaut.2021.102683; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896841121000913?v=s5,33

Growth, health, stress indices, and behavior of newly born calves, along with physical characteristics and bacterial counts of bedding, were evaluated for 42 d during August to October, 2002. Overall average daily gain and dry matter intake of calves did not differ due to bedding type, although during wk 2 calves housed on rice hulls had the greatest dry matter intake and those housed on wood shavings had the lowest. During wk 2, calves housed on granite fines and sand were treated more often for scours, and calves housed on long wheat straw received the fewest antibiotic treatments (week by bedding material interaction). Granite fines formed a harder surface than other bedding, and calves housed on granite fines scored the dirtiest. When bedding materials were evaluated, sand was scored to be the dirtiest, while pens bedded with rice hulls, long wheat straw, and wood shavings scored cleaner. Long wheat straw had the warmest surface temperature, and rice hulls and wood shavings were warmer than granite fines and sand. Serum cortisol, α 1-acid glycoprotein, immunoglobulin G concentrations, and the neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio were not affected by bedding type. On d 0, coliform counts were greatest in rice hulls. After use, coliform counts were greatest in long wheat straw (week by bedding material interaction). On d 42, the concentration of ammonia at 10cm above the bedding was lowest for long wheat straw. Growth performance of calves bedded for 42 d with 5 bedding types did not differ; however, the number of antibiotic treatments given for scours was greatest on granite fines and sand; coliform counts in the bedding were highest in rice hulls before use and in long wheat straw after 42 d of use.","Panivivat, R.; Kegley, E.

They may interfere with the participation in physical activities. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate how these masks influence dyspnoea (primary outcome), exercise performance and cardiorespiratory response during a 1-min sit-to-stand test (1STST), and to assess masks discomfort sensations. METHODS: A randomized crossover trial was conducted in healthy adults. They performed 3 1STST (with either no mask (NM), a SM, or a CM) separated from each other by 24–72 h. The number of 1STST repetitions and leg rate of perceived exertion (RPE) were measured. Dyspnoea (Borg scale), hearth rate, respiratory rate and SpO(2) were recorded before and at the end of 1STST, as well as after a short resting period. Several domains of subjective discomfort perceptions with masks were assessed. RESULTS: Twenty adults aged 22 ± 2y (11 males) were recruited. Wearing the CM generated significantly higher dyspnoea than NM at all time points, but it only became clinically relevant after the 1STST (median difference, 1 [95%CI 0 to 1]). The SM generated a small but significant higher leg RPE than NM (median difference, 1 [95%CI 0 to 1]). The masks had no impact on 1STST performance nor cardiorespiratory parameters. Both masks were rated similarly for discomfort perceptions except for breathing resistance where CM was rated higher. CONCLUSIONS: In healthy adults, the CM and SM had minimal to no impact on dyspnoea, cardiorespiratory parameters, and exercise performance during a short submaximal exercise test.","Reychler, Gregory; Straeten, Charlie vander; Schalkwijk, Adrien; Poncin, William",Respir Med,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0954611121002365; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34273733/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rmed.2021.106530; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0954611121002365,33

For each patient, nasopharyngeal- and rectal swabs, bile, urine, and plasma samples were collected at different time points for SARS-CoV-2 RNA quantification by two ddPCR assays. For both patients, ddPCR revealed persistent and prolonged detection of viral RNA in the nasopharyngeal swab despite triple-negative or single-positive results by qRT-PCR. In Patient 1, SARS-CoV-2 RNA dropped more rapidly in bile and rectal-swab and declined slowly in nasopharyngeal swab and plasma, becoming undetectable in all compartments 97 days after symptoms started. Conversely, in patient 2, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected, even if at low copies, in all body samples (with the exception of urine) up to 75 days after the onset of symptoms.

We investigated (1) changes in child and adult well-being, (2) mother–child associations of mental well-being, and (3) associations between pre-pandemic brain activation during mentalizing and later fears or burden. In adults the prevalence of clinically significant anxiety-levels was 34.88% and subthreshold depression 32.56%. Caregiver burden in parents was moderately elevated. Overall, scores of depression, anxiety, and caregiver burden decreased across the 11 weeks after Covid-19-onset. Children’s behavioral and emotional problems during Covid-19 did not significantly differ from pre-pandemic levels and decreased during restrictions. Mothers’ subjective burden of care was associated with children’s emotional and behavioral problems, while depression levels in mothers were related to children’s mood. Furthermore, meeting friends was a significant predictor of children’s mood during early restrictions.

This data was combined with information about industries according to whether they were likely or possibly essential during the COVID‐19 pandemic and the frequency of exposure to infections and close proximity to others by occupation. The percentage of workers employed in essential industries and occupations with a high risk of infection and close proximity to others by race and ethnicity was calculated. RESULTS: People of color were more likely to be employed in essential industries and in occupations with more exposure to infections and close proximity to others. Black workers in particular faced an elevated risk for all of these factors.

Primary human tracheal (HTE) and nasal (HNE) epithelial cells were pretreated with nafamostat and infected with the 2009 pandemic [A/Sendai‐H/108/2009/(H1N1) pdm09] or seasonal [A/New York/55/2004(H3N2)] influenza virus. Pretreatment with nafamostat reduced the titers of the pandemic and seasonal influenza viruses and the secretion of inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin‐6 and tumor necrosis factor‐α, in the supernatants of the cells infected with the pandemic influenza virus. HTE and HNE cells exhibited mRNA and/or protein expression of transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), TMPRSS4, and TMPRSS11D. Pretreatment with nafamostat reduced cleavage of the precursor protein HA0 of the pandemic influenza virus into subunit HA1 in HTE cells and reduced the number of acidic endosomes in HTE and HNE cells where influenza virus RNA enters the cytoplasm. Additionally, nafamostat (30 mg/kg/day, intraperitoneal administration) reduced the levels of the pandemic influenza virus [A/Hyogo/YS/2011 (H1N1) pdm09] in mouse lung washes.

It is important to improve mental health among nurses in these countries. The objective of this study was to examine the efficacy of two types of newly developed smartphone-based stress management programs in improving depressive and anxiety symptoms among hospital nurses in Vietnam. This study was a three-arm (including two intervention groups and one control group) randomized trial. Participants were recruited from nurses in a large general hospital in Hanoi, Vietnam. Two types (free-choice and fixed sequential order) of smartphone-based stress management programs were developed. Participants were randomly allocated to Program A (a free-choice, multimodule stress management), Program B (a fixed-order, internet cognitive behavioral therapy, iCBT), or a control group (treatment as usual). The depressive and anxiety symptoms were measured by using the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scales at baseline, 3-, and 7-month follow-up surveys. 951 participants were randomly allocated to each of the three groups. Program B showed a statistically significant effect on improving depressive symptoms at 3-month (p = 0.048), but not at 7-month (p = 0.92); Cohen’s d was − 0.18 (95% CI − 0.34 to − 0.02) and 0.03 (95% CI − 1.00 to 1.05), respectively. Program A failed to show a significant intervention effect on any of the outcomes at 3- or 7-month follow-up (p > 0.05).

With limited access to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in our region, we implemented a mobile ECMO team by April 2020 to serve patients with COVID-19. Several logistical and operational needs were assessed and addressed to ensure a successful program, including credentialing, equipment management, and transportation. A multi-disciplinary team was included in the planning, decision making, and implementation of mobile ECMO. From April 2020 to January 2021, we provided mobile ECMO to 22 patients in 13 facilities across four southern California counties. The survival to hospital discharge of patients with COVID-19 who received mobile ECMO was 52.4% (11/21) compared to 45.2% (14/31) for similar patients cannulated in-house.

With no approved antiviral or vaccine interventions for MERS, vaccines are being developed for camels to prevent virus transmission into humans. We have previously developed a chimpanzee adenoviral vector-based vaccine for MERS-CoV (ChAdOx1 MERS) and reported its strong humoral immunogenicity in dromedary camels. Here, we looked back at total RNA isolated from whole blood of three immunised dromedaries pre and post-vaccination during the first day; and performed RNA sequencing and bioinformatic analysis in order to shed light on the molecular immune responses following a ChAdOx1 MERS vaccination. Our finding shows that a number of transcripts were differentially regulated as an effect of the vaccination, including genes that are involved in innate and adaptive immunity, such as type I and II interferon responses. The camel Bcl-3 and Bcl-6 transcripts were significantly upregulated, indicating a strong activation of Tfh cell, B cell, and NF-κB pathways. In conclusion, this study gives an overall view of the first changes in the immune transcriptome of dromedaries after vaccination; it supports the potency of ChAdOx1 MERS as a potential camel vaccine to block transmission and prevent new human cases and outbreaks.","Hala, Sharif; Ribeca, Paolo; Aljami, Haya A.; Alsagaby, Suliman A.; Qasim, Ibrahim; Gilbert, Sarah C.; Alharbi, Naif Khalaf",Vet Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34437478/; https://doi.org/10.3390/vetsci8080156,33

Fifty-five SARS-CoV-2-infected patients from the early pandemic phase were followed up including serological testing and whole genome sequencing. Anti-spike and nucleocapsid protein (S/N) IgG and IgM levels were determined by screening ELISA and IgG was further characterized by reactivity to S-subunit 1 (anti-S1), S-subunit 2 (anti-S2) and anti-N. In 55 patients, 90 genetic SARS-CoV-2 changes including 48 non-synonymous single nucleotide variants were identified. Phylogenetic analysis of the sequencing data showed a cluster representing a local outbreak and various family clusters. Anti-S/N and anti-N IgG were detected in 49 patients at an average of 83 days after blood collection. Anti-S/N IgM occurred significantly less frequently than IgG whereas anti-S2 was the least prevalent IgG reactivity (P < 0.05, respectively). Age and overweight were significantly associated with higher anti-S/N and anti-S1 IgG levels while age only with anti-N IgG (multiple regression, P < 0.05, respectively). Anti-S/N IgG/IgM levels, blood group A + , cardiovascular and tumour disease, NSP12 Q444H and ORF3a S177I were independent predictors of clinical characteristics with anti-S/N IgM being associated with the need for hospitalization (multivariate regression, P < 0.05, respectively). Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody generation was mainly affected by higher age and overweight in the present cohort. COVID-19 traits were associated with genetic SARS-CoV-2 variants, anti-S/N IgG/IgM levels, blood group A + and concomitant disease. Anti-S/N IgM was the only antibody associated with the need for hospitalization.

The COVID-19 infection causes more severe illness in patients with comorbid diseases, especially in patients with diabetes, hypertension and kidney failure. Methods This is a retrospective study using electronic records and laboratory data of adult patients hospitalised at All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Patna between May 1st, 2020 and March 31st, 2021, who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and needed haemodialysis. The demographic characteristics, co-morbidities, symptoms, clinical course, laboratory parameters, and treatments were recorded. The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical profile and outcome of patients on hemodialysis with COVID-19 infection. Results The study included 261 COVID-19 patients who needed haemodialysis. The most common symptoms on admission were fever (72.8%), cough (64.3%) and dyspnoea (46.6%). The mean age was 58.4 +/-15 years. A total of 195 patients (74.7%) were male. The most common co-morbid condition was hypertension (85.1%) followed by diabetes (71.9%). A total of 118 (45.2) patients had acute on chronic kidney disease (CKD), 40 (15.3) were on maintenance haemodialysis (MHD) and 103 (39.5) were having acute kidney injury (AKI). Eight patients were renal transplant recipients. At presentation, 183 (70.1%) patients were having mild to moderately severe infection and 78 (29.9%) patients were having severe disease. A total of 213 patients required ICU admissions, 186 (75.3%) of whom required invasive ventilation. Overall mortality was 66% (172/261) and the rest were discharged. Conclusion The study suggests that COVID-19 disease has a significantly more severe course and poorer outcome in patients requiring haemodialysis.","Vardhan, Harsh; Kumar, Amit; Shyama, Shyama; Chaudhary, Neha; Pandey, Sanjay; Rai, Deependra K; Kumar, Deepak; Kumar, Sanyal",Cureus,https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.17170; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34548976/,33

The objective of this study was to analyse and compare the reporting of statistical sample size calculations in RCT papers on the treatment of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), glaucoma and cataract published in 2018. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study comprises a total of 113 RCT papers (RCT-P) published in 2018 (AMD: 14, glaucoma: 28, cataract: 71), in English or German, and identified through an internet-based literature search in PubMed and EMBASE. The primary outcome measure of the study was the number of trials providing a complete description of the underlying sample case calculation on the basis of the variables required (significance level, expected outcomes, power, and resulting sample size). RESULTS: Of the RCTs reviewed, 64% (AMD), 61% (glaucoma) and 31% (cataract) provided a justification of the number of patients included. A complete description of the described studies’ sample size calculation including all the necessary values (primary outcome measure of this study) was described by 21% of the AMD, 29% of the cataract and 18% of the glaucoma RCT publications (in total: 24 of 113 (21%) at a confidence interval of 95%: [13%; 29%]). CONCLUSION: All three treatment areas analysed lacked reporting quality regarding the justification of the number of patients included in a clinical trial based on a sample size calculation required for ethical reasons. More than half of all RCT publications reviewed did not provide all of the required information on statistical sample size calculation, and thus lacked transparency and completeness. It is therefore urgently required to involve methodologists in a study’s planning and publishing processes to ensure that methodology descriptions are transparent and of high quality.","Tulka, Sabrina; Knippschild, Stephanie; Funck, Sina; Goetjes, Isabelle; Uluk, Yasmin; Baulig, Christine",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0252640; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34086796/,33

The WHO Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) Collaborating Centres Network conducted a survey to assess the effects of COVID-19 on AMR surveillance, prevention and control. Methods From October-December 2020, WHO Global Antimicrobial Resistance and Use Surveillance System (GLASS) national focal points completed a questionnaire including Likert-scales and open-ended questions. Data were descriptively analysed, income/regional differences were assessed, and free-text questions were thematically analysed. Results Seventy-three countries across income levels participated. During the COVID-19 pandemic, 67% reported limited ability to work with AMR partnerships; decreases in funding were frequently reported by low- and middle-income countries (LMICs; p<0.01). Reduced availability of nursing, medical and public health staff for AMR was reported by 71%, 69% and 64%, respectively, whereas 67% reported stable cleaning staff availability. The majority (58%) reported reduced reagents/consumables, particularly LMICs (p<0.01). Decreased numbers of cultures, elective procedures, chronically ill admissions and outpatients and increased intensive care unit admissions reported could bias AMR data. Reported overall infection prevention and control (IPC) improvement could decrease AMR rates, whereas increases in selected inappropriate IPC practices and antibiotic prescribing could increase rates. Most did not yet have complete data on changing AMR rates due to COVID-19. Conclusions This was the first survey to explore the global impact of COVID-19 on AMR among GLASS countries. Responses revealed universal patterns but also captured country variability. Although focus is understandably on COVID-19, gains in detecting and controlling AMR, a global health priority, cannot afford to be lost.","Tomczyk, S.; Taylor, A.; Brown, A.; de Kraker, M.; Eckmanns, T.; El-Saed, A.; Alshamrani, M.; Hendriksen, R.; Jacob, M.; Lofmark, S.; Perovic, O.; Shetty, N.; Sievert, D.; Smith, R.; Stelling, J.; Thakur, S.; Tornimbene, B.; Vietor, A.

The three CRCoV-positive samples were found to be competent for viral propagation and isolation, using human rectal tumor cells (HRT-18), and the structure and nonstructure proteins encoded in the 3′-end of the CRCoV genome were sequenced. The small open reading frames situated between the spike and envelope genes of the three Korean CRCoV isolates were found to encode three nonstructural proteins (4.9 kDa, 2.7 kDa, and 12.8 kDa in size), as were the British (CRCoV G9142) and Italian (CRCoV 240-05) strains. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences of the spike protein in the CRCoV and bovine coronavirus (BCoV) strains revealed twenty sequence variations. The predicted spike protein of CRCoV contained 20 or 21 N-glycosylation sites, whereas that of BCoV contained 19 sites. Phylogenetic analysis of the spike gene from eight CRCoV and six BCoV strains, performed using the neighbor-joining approach, allowed us to classify into two clades (CRCoV and BCoV) and three Korean strains (CRCoV-K9, -K37, and -K39) related to the Japanese strain 06/075.","An, Dong-Jun; Jeong, Wooseog; Yoon, Sook Hee; Jeoung, Hye-Young; Kim, Hyun-Jeong; Park, Bong-Kyun",Vet Microbiol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113509004039; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19819086/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113509004039; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2009.09.002,33

These are not merely inhibitors rather they are at heart of many pathological conditions ranging from diabetes to renal failure. These are essential for maintenance of protein balance of the cell; once this balance gets disturbed, it may lead to cell death. Thus, cystatins cannot be merely regarded as TPI’s as these have been found to play a pivotal role in tumorigenesis and neurodegenerative diseases. Many studies have reported the variation in cystatin level in incidences of different types of cancer; highlighting an important role played by these inhibitors in cancer development and progression. Cystatin C is increasingly replacing creatinine as a biomarker of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) thereby highlighting the importance of this important inhibitor. Some recent studies have also reported the interaction pattern of various anti-cancer drugs with cystatins in a bid to find how these drugs affect this important inhibitors and whether these drugs have any side effect on cystatins. Thus, in this growing disease era it can be said that cystatins are no more just inhibitors blocking the activity of thiol proteases rather they play a pivotal role in variety of pathological conditions.","Shamsi, Anas; Bano, Bilqees",Int J Biol Macromol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28445699/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2017.04.071; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0141813017310395; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0141813017310395,33

Our study aimed to evaluate patient clinical characteristics and outcomes comparing the different COVID-19 infection peak periods. Methods This is a retrospective study of all adult patients hospitalized with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 between March 1 to April 24, 2020 and November 1 to December 31, 2020, which corresponded to the first and second waves of COVID-19 infection in our institution, respectively. Demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients were compared and used for propensity matching. Clinical outcomes, such as need for intubation, renal replacement therapy and inpatient mortality were subsequently compared between the two groups. Results Patients in the second COVID-19 wave had a significantly higher body mass index (32.58 vs 29.83, p <0.001), as well as prevalence of asthma (14% vs 8%, p=0.019) and chronic kidney disease (42% vs 18%, p <0.001).

620794,Japan's vision for a peaceful and healthier world,2015-12-11,"COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 was first identified in Japan on January 15th, 2020, soon after the pandemic originated in Wuhan, China. Subsequently, Japan experienced three distinct waves of the outbreak in the span of a year and has been attributed to new exogenous strains and evolving existing strains. Japan engaged very early on in tracking different COVID-19 sub-strains and have sequenced approximately 5% of all confirmed cases. While Japan has enforced stringent airport surveillance on cross-border travelers and returnees, some carriers appear to have advanced through the quarantine stations undetected. In this study, 17112 genomes sampled in Japan were analyzed to understand the strains, heterogeneity and temporal evolution of different SARS-CoV-2 strains. We identified 11 discrete strains with a substantial number of cases with most strains possessing the spike (S) D614G and nucleocapsid (N) 203_204delinsKR mutations. Besides these variants, ORF1ab P3371S, A4815V, S1361P, and N P151L were also detected in nearly half the samples constituting the most common strain in Japan. 115 distinct strains have been introduced into Japan and 12 of them were introduced after strict quarantine policy was implemented. In particular, the B.1.1.7 strain, that emerged in the United Kingdom (UK) in September 2020, has been circulating in Japan since late 2020 after eluding cross-border quarantine stations. Similarly, the B.1.351 strain dubbed the South African variant, P.1 Brazilian strain and R.1 strain with the spike E484K mutation have been detected in Japan. At least four exogenous B.1.1.7 sub-strains have been independently introduced in Japan as of late January 2021, and these strains carry mutations that give selective advantage including N501Y, H69_V70del, and E484K that confer increased transmissibility, reduced efficacy to vaccines and possible increased virulence. It is imperative that the quarantine policy be revised, cross-border surveillance reinforced, and new public health measures implemented to mitigate further transmission of this deadly disease and to identify strains that may engender resistance to vaccines.","Tokumasu, R.; Weeraratne, D.; Snowdon, J.; Parida, L.; Kudo, M.; Koyama, T.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.26.21252555; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.26.21252555v1?rss=1,33

623056,Herd immunity and a vaccination game: An experimental study,2020-05-14,"AIMS: Chinese university students are at high risk for depressive symptoms and the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may have exacerbated the mental health of university students. However, existing studies on depressive symptoms in Chinese university students during the COVID-19 pandemic reported a wide range of prevalence estimates, making mental health planning for this population difficult. The objective of this study was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of surveys that assessed the prevalence of depressive symptoms in Chinese university students amid the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Major Chinese (CNKI, Wanfang, VIP) and English (PubMed, Embase, PsycInfo) databases and preprint platforms were searched to identify cross-sectional studies containing data on the prevalence of depressive symptoms in Chinese university students during the pandemic. Two authors independently retrieved the literature, evaluated the eligibility of potential studies, assessed the risk of bias (RoB) of included studies, and extracted data. RoB was assessed with the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist for Studies Reporting Prevalence Data. RESULTS: In total, 1177 records were retrieved, and 84 studies involving 1 292 811 Chinese university students during the pandemic were included. None of the included studies were rated as completely low RoB. Statistically significant heterogeneity in the prevalence estimates of included studies was detected (I(2) = 99.9%, p < 0.001). The pooled prevalence of depressive symptoms was 26.0% (95%CI: 23.3–28.9%), which was significantly higher in female than in male students (30.8% v. 28.6%, p < 0.001), in postgraduates than in undergraduates (29.3% v. 22.9%, p < 0.001), in students living inside than in those living outside the COVID-19 epicentre (27.5% v. 22.3%, P < 0.001), in students from universities at the epicentre than in those from universities outside the epicentre (26.2% v. 23.1%, p < 0.001), in students who had close contact with COVID-19 than in those who did not (46.0% v. 25.0%, p < 0.001), and in students who had acquaintances or relatives infected with COVID-19 (39.7% v. 24.0%, p < 0.001) than in those who did not. Five sources of heterogeneity were identified from the subgroup analysis: survey period, % of males among the survey sample, scale of depressive symptoms, cutoff score of the scale and level of RoB. CONCLUSIONS: Over one-fourth of Chinese university students experienced depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. Mental health services for this population should include periodic evaluation of depressive symptoms, expanded social support and psychiatric assessment and treatment when necessary. It is also necessary to design depression prevention programmes that target higher-risk cohorts of university students.","Luo, Wei; Zhong, Bao-Liang; Chiu, Helen Fung-Kum",Epidemiol Psychiatr Sci,https://doi.org/10.1017/s2045796021000202; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33766163/,33

However, information on the rate of outbreak occurrences which helps to identify the type of workplaces that are more likely to experience an outbreak, or infection attack rates which estimates the potential extent of the virus transmission in an outbreak, has not yet been available to inform intervention strategies to limit transmission . Objectives: To link datasets on workplace settings and COVID-19 workplace outbreaks in England in order to: identify the geographical areas and workplace sectors with a high rate of outbreaks; and compare infection attack rates by workplace size and sector. Methods: We analysed Public Health England (PHE) HPZone data on COVID-19 outbreaks in workplaces, covering the time period of 18 May - 12 October 2020. The workplaces analysed excluded care homes, hospitals and educational settings. We calculated the workplace outbreak rates by nine English regions, 151 Upper Tier Local Authorities (UTLAs) and twelve industrial sectors, using National Population Database (NPD) data extracted in May 2019 on the total number of the relevant workplaces as the denominator. We also calculated the infection attack rates by enterprise size (small, medium, large) and industrial sector, using PHE Situations of Interest (SOI) data on the number of test-confirmed COVID-19 cases in a workplace outbreak as the numerator, and using NPD data on the number employed in that workplace as the denominator. Results: In total, 1,317 confirmed workplace outbreaks were identified from HPZone data, of which 1,305 were available for estimation of outbreak rates. The average outbreak rate was 66 per 100,000 workplaces. Of the nine geographical regions in England, the North West had the highest workplace outbreak rate (155/100,000 workplaces), based on 351 outbreaks. Of the UTLAs, the highest workplace outbreak rate was Blackburn with Darwen (387/100,000 workplaces). The industrial sector with the highest workplace outbreak rate was manufacturers and packers of food (1,672/100,000), based on 117 outbreaks: this was consistent across seven of the regions. In addition, high outbreak rates in warehouses were observed in the East Midlands and the North West. In total, 390 outbreaks were identified from SOI data and 264 of them allowed for estimation of attack rates. The overall median attack rate was 3.4% of the employed persons with confirmed COVID-19 at a workplace with an outbreak. Most of these outbreaks (162) had an attack rate less than 6%. However, in a small number of outbreaks (57) the attack rate was over 15%. The attack rates increased as the size of the enterprise decreased. The highest attack rate was for outbreaks in close contact services (median 16.5%), which was followed by outbreaks in restaurants and catering (median 10.2%), and in manufacturers and packers of non-food products (median 6.7%). Conclusions: Our linked dataset analysis approach allows early identification of geographical regions and industrial sectors with higher rates of COVID-19 workplace outbreaks as well as estimation of attack rates by enterprise size and sector. This can be used to inform interventions to limit transmission of the virus. Our approach to analysing the workplace outbreak data can also be applied to calculation of outbreak rates and attack rates in other types of settings such as care homes, hospitals and educational settings.","Chen, Y.; Aldridge, T.; UK COVID-19 National Core Studies Consortium,; Ferraro, C.

First introduced in the market in the early 1980s, the number of approved biopharmaceutical products has been steadily increasing, with therapeutic proteins, antibodies, and their derivatives accounting for most of the generated revenues. The success of pharmaceutical biotechnology is closely linked with remarkable developments in DNA recombinant technology, which has enabled the production of proteins with high specificity. Among promising biopharmaceuticals are interferons, first described by Isaacs and Lindenmann in 1957 and approved for clinical use in humans nearly thirty years later. Interferons are secreted autocrine and paracrine proteins, which by regulating several biochemical pathways have a spectrum of clinical effectiveness against viral infections, malignant diseases, and multiple sclerosis. Given their relevance and sustained market share, this review provides an overview on the evolution of interferon manufacture, comprising their production, purification, and formulation stages. Remarkable developments achieved in the last decades are herein discussed in three main sections: (i) an upstream stage, including genetically engineered genes, vectors, and hosts, and optimization of culture conditions (culture media, induction temperature, type and concentration of inducer, induction regimens, and scale); (ii) a downstream stage, focusing on single- and multiple-step chromatography, and emerging alternatives (e.g., aqueous two-phase systems); and (iii) formulation and delivery, providing an overview of improved bioactivities and extended half-lives and targeted delivery to the site of action. This review ends with an outlook and foreseeable prospects for underdeveloped aspects of biopharma research involving human interferons.","Castro, Leonor S.; Lobo, Guilherme S.; Pereira, Patrícia; Freire, Mara G.; Neves, Márcia C.; Pedro, Augusto Q.",Vaccines (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9040328; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33915863/,33
626190,Perceptions of best practices for return of results in an international survey of psychiatric genetics researchers,2020-10-03,"Retrovirus Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV) matures by budding at the cell surface. Central to the budding process is the myristoylated viral core protein precursor Gag which, even in the absence of all other viral components, is capable of associating with the cytoplasmic leaflet of the plasma membrane and assembling into extracellular virus- like particles. In this paper we have used heterologous, Semliki Forest virus-driven, expression of M-MuLV Gag to study the mechanism by which this protein is targeted to the cell surface. In pulse-chase experiments, BFA, monensin, and 20 degrees C block did not affect incorporation of Gag into extracellular particles thereby indicating that the secretory pathway is not involved in targeting of Gag to the cell surface. Subcellular fractionation studies demonstrated that newly synthesized Gag became rapidly and efficiently associated with membranes which had a density similar to that of plasma membrane- derived vesicles. Protease-protection studies confirmed that the Gag- containing membranes were of plasma membrane origin, since in crude cell homogenates, the bulk of newly synthesized Gag was protease- resistant as expected of a protein that binds to the cytoplasmic leaflet of the plasma membrane. Taken together these data indicate that targeting of M-MuLV Gag to the cell surface proceeds via direct insertion of the protein to the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane. Furthermore, since the membrane insertion reaction is highly efficient and specific, this suggests that the reaction is dependent on as-yet-unidentified cellular factors.",,J Cell Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8991095/,33

Methods MHealth Fairview encompasses four hospitals (one academic, three community-based) in the Minneapolis, Minnesota metro area. To compare HF hospitalization trends, two inpatient samples were created using HF discharges in the following time periods: pre COVID-19 (February 28, 2019-February 28, 2020) and post COVID-19 (April 1, 2020- May 15, 2020). March 2020 was excluded as this represented a transition point of the pandemic in the United States. Average number of discharges per day as well as demographics, diagnosis related group (DRG) codes, and inpatient mortality was then compared between the two inpatient HF samples. Results The pre COVID-19 group had 2,601 patients with an average of 7.1 (+/-3) discharges per day. The post COVID-19 group had 210 patients with an average of 4.7 (+/-1.7) discharges per day, which represented a 34% reduction in HF discharges (p <0.001). No statistically significant differences were observed between the pre and post COVID-19 inpatient samples with respect to age (76 vs. 75 years, p = 0.25), gender (46% vs. 48% male, p = 0.7), and DRG codes (DRG 291: 78% vs. 85% p = 0.15). Inpatient HF mortality pre and post COVID-19 was not significantly different (3% vs. 2.9%, p = 0.99). Conclusion HF hospitalizations have decreased significantly during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in this multi-center health care system, however the make-up of hospitalized patients remains similar. There is an urgent need to provide continued access to safe hospital care during the pandemic and to inform HF patients that inpatient care remains available.","Fraser, Meg; Mutschler, Melinda; Sackman, Kerry; Newman, Christie; Alexy, Tamas; Garry, Daniel; Kamdar, Forum; Thenappan, Thenappan; Pritzker, Marc; Martin, Cindy M.; Cogswell, Rebecca",Journal of Cardiac Failure,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1071916420311556; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1071916420311556,33

A significant proportion of the world’s population that is affected by latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is at risk for reactivation and subsequent transmission to close contacts. Despite sustained efforts in eradication, the rise of multidrug-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb) has rendered traditional antibiotic therapy less effective at mitigating the morbidity and mortality of the disease. Management of TB is further complicated by medications with various off-target effects and poor compliance. Immunocompromised patients are the most at-risk in reactivation of a LTBI, due to impairment in effector immune responses. Our laboratory has previously reported that individuals suffering from Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) and HIV exhibited compromised levels of the antioxidant glutathione (GSH). Restoring the levels of GSH resulted in improved control of M. tb infection. The goal of this review is to provide insights on the diverse roles of TGF- β and vitamin D in altering the levels of GSH, granuloma formation, and clearance of M. tb infection. We propose that these pathways represent a potential avenue for future investigation and development of new TB treatment modalities.","Singh, Mohkam; Vaughn, Charles; Sasaninia, Kayvan; Yeh, Christopher; Mehta, Devanshi; Khieran, Ibrahim; Venketaraman, Vishwanath",J Clin Med,https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm9092757; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32858837/,33

Through direct effects within tumor cells and promotion of tumor-stroma interactions, emmprin participates in induction of tumor cell invasiveness, angiogenesis, metastasis and chemoresistance. Although its contribution to cancer progression has been widely studied, the role of emmprin in viral oncogenesis still remains largely unclear, and only a small body of available literature implicates emmprin-associated mechanisms in viral pathogenesis and tumorigenesis. We summarize these data in this review, focusing on the role of emmprin in pathogenesis associated with the Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), a common etiology for cancers arising in the setting of immune suppression. We also discuss future directions for mechanistic studies exploring roles for emmprin in viral cancer pathogenesis.","Dai, Lu; Bai, Lihua; Lu, Ying; Xu, Zengguang; Reiss, Krys; Valle, Luis Del; Kaleeba, Johnan; Toole, Bryan P.; Parsons, Chris; Qin, Zhiqiang",Cancer Letters,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.canlet.2013.05.037; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0304383513004230; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3728473?pdf=render; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23743354/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304383513004230,33

The hazards of cleaning without adequate skin protection,2021-03-22,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is characterized by manifestations and symptoms involving systemic organs and apparatus, associated with elevated cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, bone disease, and other tissue involvement. Arterial hypertension (AH), diabetes mellitus (DM), and dyslipidemia, with glomerular or congenital diseases, are the traditional risk factors recognized as the main causes of progressive kidney dysfunction evolving into uremia. Acute kidney injury (AKI) has recently been considered an additional risk factor for the worsening of CKD or the development of CKD de novo. Evidence underlies the role of systemic inflammation as a linking factor between AKI and CKD, recognizing the role of inflammation in AKI evolution to CKD. Moreover, abnormal increases in oxidative stress (OS) and inflammatory status in CKD seem to exert an important pathogenetic role, with significant involvement in the clinical management of this condition. With our revision, we want to focus on and update the inflammatory mechanisms responsible for the pathologic conditions associated with CKD, with particular attention on the development of AKI and AKI-CKD de novo, the alteration of calcium-phosphorus metabolism with bone disease and CKD-MBD syndrome, the status of malnutrition and malnutrition–inflammation complex syndrome (MICS) and protein-energy wasting (PEW), uremic sarcopenia, the status of OS, and the different inflammatory pathways, highlighting a new approach to CKD. The depth comprehension of the mechanisms underlying the development of inflammation in CKD may present new possible therapeutic approaches in CKD and hopefully improve the management of correlated morbidities and provide a reduction in associated mortality.","Tinti, Francesca; Lai, Silvia; Noce, Annalisa; Rotondi, Silverio; Marrone, Giulia; Mazzaferro, Sandro; Di Daniele, Nicola; Mitterhofer, Anna Paola",Life (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34063052/; https://doi.org/10.3390/life11050419,33

Creating a comprehensive topic course is particularly challenging because the traditional, week-by-week linear curriculum design is often a barrier to learners interested in only specific topics. We created a novel, flexible course as both a ‘choose your topic’ MOOC for the public learner and a Small Private Online Course (SPOC) for medical students. METHODS: We describe creating ‘Injury Prevention for Children and Teens’, a course of 59 video learning segments within eight modules taught by a multidisciplinary panel of 25 nationally-recognized experts. Completion tracking and course evaluations were collected. RESULTS: In 2.5 years, 4,822 learners from 148 countries have enrolled. Two-thirds of learners were female. Median age of learners was 31 years. For engagement, 19.3% (n = 932) of learners attempted quizzes, and 5.2% (n = 252) participated in online forum discussions. Medical professionals (n = 162) claimed an average of 13 credit hours per learner. Over 200 senior medical students have taken the SPOC.

Thus, the race to develop a COVID-19 vaccine is an urgent global imperative. At the time of writing, there are over 165 vaccine candidates being developed, with 33 in various stages of clinical testing. In this review, we discuss emerging insights about the human immune response to SARS-CoV-2, and their implications for vaccine design. We then review emerging knowledge of the immunogenicity of the numerous vaccine candidates that are currently being tested in the clinic and discuss the range of immune defense mechanisms that can be harnessed to develop novel vaccines that confer durable protection against SARS-CoV-2. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of the potential role of a systems vaccinology approach in accelerating the clinical testing of vaccines, to meet the urgent needs posed by the pandemic.","Grigoryan, Lilit; Pulendran, Bali",Semin Immunol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.smim.2020.101422; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33262067/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1044532320300385?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1044532320300385,33

This brings serious clinical concerns regarding the potential need for in‐depth cardiac screening in athletes after Covid‐19 before return to play. The aim of this study was to gain further insight into the relation between Covid‐19 and cardiac involvement in professional athletes. This was a retrospective cohort study, in which 26 consecutive elite athletes (national team, Olympians, top national league players; median age 24 years, interquartile range [IQR] 21–27, 81% female) were included. At 1.5 T including balanced steady‐state free precession cine imaging, T1 and T2‐mapping using Myomaps software (Siemens), dark‐blood T2‐weighted images with fat suppression, and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) with phase‐sensitive inversion recovery sequence were used. The athletes had mainly asymptomatic or mild course of the disease (77%). They were scanned after a median of 32 days (IQR 22–62 days) from the diagnosis. MR data were reviewed by three independent observers, each with >10 years cardiac MR experience. Native T1, T2, extracellular volume, and T2 signal intensity ratio were calculated. Diagnosis of acute myocarditis was based on modified Lake Louise criteria. Statistical analyses used were Pearson correlation and Bland–Altman repeatability analysis. At the time of MR the athletes had no pathologic electrocardiogram abnormalities or elevated troponin levels. MR did not reveal any case of acute myocarditis. Cardiac abnormalities were found in five (19%) athletes, including four athletes presenting borderline signs of isolated myocardial edema and one athlete showing nonischemic LGE with pleural and pericardial effusion. Another athlete had signs of persistent lung congestion without cardiac involvement. We have shown that in a small group of elite athletes with mainly asymptomatic to mild Covid‐19, lack of electrocardiographic changes, and normal troponin concentration 1–2 months after the diagnosis, there were no signs of acute myocarditis, but 19% of athletes had some abnormalities as assessed by cardiac MR.

631874,Research and control of parasitic diseases in Japan: current position and future perspectives,2007-03-09,"The tropism of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a virus responsible for the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, toward the host cells is determined, at least in part, by the expression and distribution of its cell surface receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The virus further exploits the host cellular machinery to gain access into the cells; its spike protein is cleaved by a host cell surface transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) shortly after binding ACE2, followed by its proteolytic activation at a furin cleavage site. The virus primarily targets the epithelium of the respiratory tract, which is covered by a tightly regulated airway surface liquid (ASL) layer that serves as a primary defense mechanism against respiratory pathogens. The volume and viscosity of this fluid layer is regulated and maintained by a coordinated function of different transport pathways in the respiratory epithelium. We argue that SARS-CoV-2 may potentially alter evolutionary conserved second-messenger signaling cascades via activation of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) or by directly modulating G protein signaling. Such signaling may in turn adversely modulate transepithelial transport processes, especially those involving cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and epithelial Na(+) channel (ENaC), thereby shifting the delicate balance between anion secretion and sodium absorption, which controls homeostasis of this fluid layer. As a result, activation of the secretory pathways including CFTR-mediated Cl(−) transport may overwhelm the absorptive pathways, such as ENaC-dependent Na(+) uptake, and initiate a pathophysiological cascade leading to lung edema, one of the most serious and potentially deadly clinical manifestations of COVID-19.","Abdel Hameid, Reem; Cormet-Boyaka, Estelle; Kuebler, Wolfgang M.; Uddin, Mohammed; Berdiev, Bakhrom K.",Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33434105/; https://doi.org/10.1152/ajplung.00499.2020,33

When infected cells and isolated virions were assayed for this protein by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, p28 could be detected in infected cells labeled at late times after infection, but not at early times or in purified virions. p28 represents the first protein product of the putative coronavirus polymerase gene to be identified in infected cells.","Denison, M.; Perlman, S.",Virology,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0042682287903035; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0042682287903035; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3029990/,33

A number of studies have suggested for the co-occurrence of the two diseased conditions. In terms of global prevalence, AD and ADHD almost exhibit a parallel increment according to epidemiological data. In addition, recent reports indicate AD to show a temporal association with later onset of ADHD. Although several studies suggest for the potential link between AD and ADHD, currently there is no definitive answer to this regard. Furthermore, epidemiological evidence of co-occurrence does not ascertain a pathophysiological link between the two conditions. The pathophysiological basis behind the association of AD and ADHD also remain poorly elucidated. The objective of this review is to present an extensive account of AD and associated comorbidities with a special attention toward ADHD as well as to elaborate on the mechanisms underlying their association. The review can provide healthcare providers with the recent updates on AD-ADHD association and help them while dealing with such patients.

Despite the considerable interest in developing covid-19 prediction models, the review concluded that all models to date, with no exception, are at high risk of bias with concerns related to data quality, flaws in the statistical analysis and poor reporting, and none are recommended for use. Disappointingly, the recent study by Yang and colleagues describing the development of a prediction model to identify covid-19 patients with severe disease, is no different. The study has failed to report important information needed to judge the study findings, but has numerous methodological concerns in design and analysis that deserve highlighting.

636100,Discerning truth through the fog of fallacies,2021,"As the global severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic expands, genomic epidemiology and whole genome sequencing are being used to investigate its transmission and evolution. Against the backdrop of the global emergence of “variants of concern” (VOCs) during December 2020 and an upsurge in a state in the western part of India since January 2021, whole genome sequencing and analysis of spike protein mutations using sequence and structural approaches were undertaken to identify possible new variants and gauge the fitness of the current circulating strains. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that newly identified lineages B.1.617.1 and B.1.617.2 were predominantly circulating. The signature mutations possessed by these strains were L452R, T478K, E484Q, D614G and P681R in the spike protein, including within the receptor-binding domain (RBD). Of these, the mutations at residue positions 452, 484 and 681 have been reported in other globally circulating lineages. The structural analysis of RBD mutations L452R, T478K and E484Q revealed that these may possibly result in increased ACE2 binding while P681R in the furin cleavage site could increase the rate of S1-S2 cleavage, resulting in better transmissibility. The two RBD mutations, L452R and E484Q, indicated decreased binding to select monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and may affect their neutralization potential. Further in vitro/in vivo studies would help confirm the phenotypic changes of the mutant strains. Overall, the study revealed that the newly emerged variants were responsible for the second wave of COVID-19 in Maharashtra. Lineage B.1.617.2 has been designated as a VOC delta and B.1.617.1 as a variant of interest kappa, and they are being widely reported in the rest of the country as well as globally. Continuous monitoring of these and emerging variants in India is essential.","Cherian, Sarah; Potdar, Varsha; Jadhav, Santosh; Yadav, Pragya; Gupta, Nivedita; Das, Mousumi; Rakshit, Partha; Singh, Sujeet; Abraham, Priya; Panda, Samiran; Team, NIC",Microorganisms,https://doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms9071542; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34361977/,33

We retrieved posts from the /r/covidlonghaulers subreddit and extracted symptoms via approximate matching using an expanded meta-lexicon. We mapped the extracted symptoms to standard concept IDs, compared their distributions with those reported in recent literature and analyzed their distributions over time. From 42 995 posts by 4249 users, we identified 1744 users who expressed at least 1 symptom. The most frequently reported long-COVID symptoms were mental health-related symptoms (55.2%), fatigue (51.2%), general ache/pain (48.4%), brain fog/confusion (32.8%), and dyspnea (28.9%) among users reporting at least 1 symptom. Comparison with recent literature revealed a large variance in reported symptoms across studies. Temporal analysis showed several persistent symptoms up to 15 months after infection.

Repeated virus identification in the airways of patients with mild and severe asthma during prospective follow‐up. Allergy 2011; 66: 1099–1106. ABSTRACT: Background: Respiratory viruses may persist in the airways of asthmatics between episodes of clinical worsening. We hypothesized that patients with clinically stable, severe asthma exhibit increased and more prolonged viral presence in the airways as compared to mild asthmatics and healthy controls. Methods: Thirty‐five subjects (no cold symptoms >4 weeks) entered a 12‐week prospective study using three groups: clinically stable mild asthma (GINA 2) (n = 12, age 34.1 ± 13.4 year), severe asthma (GINA 4) (n = 12, age 49.3 ± 14.8 year) and healthy controls (n = 11, age 37.9 ± 14.2 year). All subjects underwent spirometry and completed a written questionnaire on asthma symptoms at baseline. Nasal and throat swabs, induced sputum samples, exhaled breath condensate and gelatine‐filtered expired air were analysed at 0, 6 and 12 weeks by a multiplex real‐time PCR assay for 14 respiratory viruses using adequate positive and negative controls. Results: Thirty‐two of 525 patient assessments (6%) showed a virus‐positive sample. Among the 14 respiratory viruses examined, HRV, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza 3&4, human bocavirus, influenza B and coronavirus were detected. When combining all sampling methods, on average 18% of controls and 30% of mild and severe asthmatics were virus positive, which was not different between the groups (P = 0.34). The longitudinal data showed a changing rather than persistent viral presence over time. Conclusion: Patients with clinically stable asthma and healthy controls have similar detection rates of respiratory viruses in samples from nasopharynx, sputum and exhaled air. This indicates that viral presence in the airways of stable (severe) asthmatics varies over time rather than being persistent.","Turchiarelli, V.; Schinkel, J.; Molenkamp, R.; Foschino Barbaro, M.

638272,Cyclosporine: an old weapon in the fight against Coronaviruses,2020-07-30,"In Denmark, remote monitoring and management of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) started two decades ago with the web application Constant Care. The disease monitoring in Constant Care consists of simple disease activity questionnaires and home measurement of faecal calprotectin, a stool biomarker for inflammation. It has now been implemented in clinical practice at North Zealand University Hospital in Denmark. Digital health care solutions facilitate remote contact between patients and healthcare providers and have been shown to reduce time to remission, outpatient visits and hospital admissions, and increase adherence to medical therapy, quality of life and disease and treatment knowledge. In Australia, E-Health is an area of increasing interest, particularly given the significant distances travelled by rural patients to access specialist care. There are several foreseeable benefits to incorporating E-Health/remote monitoring into Australian IBD management, including reduced burdens of time and cost on rural patients, and more efficient management of well outpatients, thereby increasing clinic availability for acutely unwell patients. The significant portion of IBD patients managed in private practice in Australia, and the infrastructure within private practice that is well suited to implementation of E-Health makes Australia a viable setting for an E-Health IBD management model like Denmark's Constant Care model. One pilot study is currently underway investigating the feasibility of rapid and remote IBD monitoring and E-Health in an Australian IBD population. The current COVID-19 pandemic has further illustrated the importance of telehealth as a means of maintaining health services to patients in geographic, or social, isolation.","Ankersen, Dorit V; Noack, Savannah; Munkholm, Pia; Sparrow, Miles P",Intern Med J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34346152/; https://doi.org/10.1111/imj.15132,33
638591,Attitudes and perception of influenza vaccines among older people in Singapore: A qualitative study,2019-10-16,"Urban green space (UGS) is an essential element in the urban environment, providing multiple ecosystem services as well as beneficial effects on physical and mental health. In a time of societal crisis these effects may be amplified, but ensuring that they are maintained requires effective planning and management – which is a complex challenge given the rapid changes in modern society and the need for continual adaptation. This study aims to identify the drivers that normally attract visitors to UGS, and to assess the effects of social isolation on the usage and perception of UGS during the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted an online survey during the period in which restrictive measures were imposed in response to the pandemic (March-May 2020), in Croatia, Israel, Italy, Lithuania, Slovenia and Spain. Results showed that urban residents normally have a need for accessible UGS, mainly for physical exercise, relaxing and observing nature. The reduction in UGS visitation during the containment period was related to distinct changes in the motivations of those who did visit, with a relative increase in ""necessary activities"" such as taking the dog out, and a reduction in activities that could be considered non-essential or high-risk such as meeting people or observing nature. Behavioral changes related to proximity were also observed, with an increase in people walking to small urban gardens nearby (e.g. in Italy) or tree-lined streets (e.g. in Spain, Israel), and people traveling by car to green areas outside the city (e.g. in Lithuania). What the respondents missed the most about UGS during the pandemic was ""spending time outdoors"" and ""meeting other people"" – highlighting that during the COVID-19 isolation, UGS was important for providing places of solace and respite, and for allowing exercise and relaxation. Respondents expressed the need for urban greenery even when legally mandated access was limited – and many proposed concrete suggestions for improved urban planning that integrates green spaces of different sizes within the fabric of cities and neighborhoods, so that all residents have access to UGS.","Ugolini, Francesca; Massetti, Luciano; Calaza-Martínez, Pedro; Cariñanos, Paloma; Dobbs, Cynnamon; Ostoic, Silvija Krajter; Marin, Ana Marija; Pearlmutter, David; Saaroni, Hadas; Šaulienė, Ingrida; Simoneti, Maja; Verlič, Andrej; Vuletić, Dijana; Sanesi, Giovanni",Urban For Urban Green,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33100944/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1618866720307056?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1618866720307056; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ufug.2020.126888,33

Matériels et méthodes Nous avons inclus tous les patients hospitalisés pour COVID-19 dans le service de maladies infectieuses entre le 12/03/20 et le 13/05/20. Le diagnostic était confirmé par une PCR SARS-CoV-2 positive sur prélèvement nasopharyngé et/ou par un scanner thoracique compatible et des données clinicobiologiques évocatrices. Nous avons étudié les caractéristiques des patients et leur devenir. Les traitements par antibiotiques (ATB), hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) et corticoïdes (CTC) ont été administrés au moins 48h. Nous avons comparé les patients décédés et survivants par une analyse univariée : test de Fischer ou Chi2 pour les données qualitatives et test t de Student pour les données quantitatives. Résultats Parmi les 326 patients inclus, le sex-ratio H/F était 1,5 et l’âge médian 69 ans (IQR : 57–84). La répartition des ethnies était : 195 (60 %) caucasiens, 80 (24 %) originaires d’Afrique du Nord et 51 (16 %) originaires d’Afrique subsaharienne. L’indice de masse corporelle (IMC) médian était de 27kg/m2 (IQR : 24–30). Des comorbidités telles HTA, diabète, cardiovasculaires, respiratoires, neurologiques, étaient présentes chez 238 patients (73 %). La PCR SARS-CoV-2 était positive chez 256 (79 %). Le scanner thoracique était évocateur chez 238/246 (97 %) et retrouvait une atteinte modérée à sévère chez 171/246 (70 %). Les patients avaient présenté les symptômes suivants : fièvre 242 (74 %), asthénie 224 (69 %), dyspnée 219 (67 %), toux 204 (63 %), myalgies 91 (28 %), diarrhées 89 (27 %), céphalées et/ou confusion 60 (18 %) et agueusie et/ou anosmie 22 (7 %). À l’entrée : 212 (65 %) avaient une saturation en oxygène en air ambiant (oxymétrie au pouls) SpO2 ≤ 94 % et la SpO2 médiane était 93 % (IQR : 90 %–95 %) ; la CRP médiane était 93mg/L (IQR : 40–171). Concernant les traitements reçus : 291 (89 %) ont eu des ATB, 97 (30 %) de l’HCQ seule, 41 (13 %) des CTC seuls et 43 (13 %) de l’HCQ et des CTC. Au total 140 (43 %) ont eu de l’HCQ et 84 (26 %) des CTC. Les patients ont été hospitalisés dans le service en médiane à j7 (IQR : 4–10) du début de leurs symptômes, pour une durée médiane de 5jours (IQR : 3–7). À J2 d’hospitalisation en médiane (IQR : 0–3), 60 patients (18,4 %) ont été transférés en réanimation et parmi eux, 48 (80 %) ont survécu. Pendant l’hospitalisation, 60 patients (18,4 %) sont décédés dans le service, en réanimation ou en soins de suite. La comparaison univariée entre les patients décédés et les survivants a montré de façon statistiquement significative (p <0,05) que les patients décédés : étaient plus âgés (84 ans vs 65), avaient une SpO2 à l’entrée plus basse (90 % vs 93,5 %) et une CRP plus élevée (156 vs 80).

However, only a few cases of Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) and COVID-19 have been reported. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate a case of concomitant GBS with COVID-19 in Colombia. CASE PRESENTATION: A 39-year-old woman was admitted to a teaching hospital in Barranquilla, Colombia with a history of progressive general weakness with lower limb dominance. Previous symptoms such as ageusia, anosmia and intense headache were reported. Upon admission, facial diplegia, quadriparesis with lower extremity predominance and Medical Research Council muscular strength of 2/5 in the lower limbs and 4/5 in the upper limbs were reported. During clinical evolution, due to general areflexia, hypertensive emergency and progressive diaphragmatic weakness, the patient was admitted to an intensive care unit. The cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed protein-cytological dissociation and the GBS diagnosis was confirmed via a nerve conduction and electromyography test. With regard to the symptoms before hospitalisation, SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing was performed with positive results in the second test. The patient was managed with supportive care and was discharged after 20 days of hospitalization with clinical improvement. CONCLUSIONS: Only a few cases of COVID-19 with GBS have been reported. Different subtypes have been previously identified, such as Miller-Fisher syndrome and dysautonomic GBS with SARS-CoV-2 infection. This study investigated the first confirmed case of COVID-19 with concomitant GBS in Colombia. In patients with GBS, several viral and bacterial pathogens have been found in case-control studies but the factors that induce the immune-mediated destruction of the nerve tissues have not been determined. Further studies are needed to determine the possible association between COVID-19 exposure and GBS.","Mackenzie, Nuvia; Lopez-Coronel, Eva; Dau, Alberto; Maloof, Dieb; Mattar, Salvador; Garcia, Jesus Tapia; Fontecha, Briyis; Lanata, Cristina M.; Guillen-Burgos, Hernan Felipe",BMC Neurol,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12883-021-02162-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33757457/,33

Reports of unrecognized anosmia in COVID-19 patients suggests that self-reported measures are insufficient for capturing patients with chemosensory dysfunction. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to quantify the impact of recent COVID-19 infection on chemosensory function and demonstrate the use of at-home objective smell and taste testing in an at-risk population of healthcare workers. METHODS: Two hundred and fifty healthcare workers were screened for possible loss of smell and taste using online surveys. Self-administered smell and taste tests were mailed to respondents meeting criteria for elevated risk of infection, and one-month follow-up surveys were completed. RESULTS: Among subjects with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, 73% reported symptoms of olfactory and/or gustatory dysfunction. Self-reported smell and taste loss were both strong predictors of COVID-19 positivity. Subjects with evidence of recent SARS-CoV-2 infection (<45 days) had significantly lower olfactory scores but equivalent gustatory scores compared to other subjects. There was a time-dependent increase in smell scores but not in taste scores among subjects with prior infection and chemosensory symptoms. The overall infection rate was 4.4%, with 2.5% reported by PCR swab. CONCLUSION: Healthcare workers with recent SARS-CoV-2 infection had reduced olfaction and normal gustation on self-administered objective testing compared to those without infection. Rates of infection and chemosensory symptoms in our cohort of healthcare workers reflect those of the general public.","Cao, Austin C.; Nimmo, Zachary M.; Mirza, Natasha; Cohen, Noam A.; Brody, Robert M.; Doty, Richard L.",World J Otorhinolaryngol Head Neck Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33614178/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wjorl.2021.02.001; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2095881121000159; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095881121000159?v=s5,33

So far there is no consensus for drug treatment to stop the spread of the virus. Discovery of a drug that would limit the virus expansion is one of the biggest challenges faced by the humanity in the last decades. In this perspective, to test existing drugs as inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 main protease is a good approach. Among natural phenolic compounds found in plants, fruit, and vegetables; flavonoids are the most abundant. Flavonoids, especially in their glycosylated forms, display a number of physiological activities, which makes them interesting to investigate as antiviral molecules. The flavonoids chemical structures were downloaded from PubChem and protease structure 6LU7 was from the Protein Data Bank site. Molecular docking study was performed using AutoDock Vina. Among the tested molecules Quercetin-3-O-rhamnoside showed the highest binding affinity (-9,7 kcal/mol). Docking studies showed that glycosylated flavonoids are good inhibitors for the SARS-CoV-2 protease and could be further investigated by in vitro and in vivo experiments for further validation.

The mortality was 8.7% higher in the treatment group (15.6% vs 6.9% in the supportive care group, P < 0.001). Treatment was not protective against progression to severe disease (18.4% vs 3.6% with supportive care, P < 0.0001). Time to defervescence, duration of oxygen support, and hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay were also higher in the treatment group. In multivariate analysis, 60 years or older, presence of severe disease, and need for ICU admission were identified as independent predictors of 28-day mortality. There were 41 (10.5%) adverse event in the treatment group, with the majority being QT prolongation and gastrointestinal effects. CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of hospitalized patients admitted to acute care services, treatment with hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir or both could not be shown to improve mortality, progression to severe disease, or clinical response.","Marsh, Kassandra; Decano, Arnold; Siegfried, Justin; Ahmed, Nabeela; Blum, Sharon; Tirmizi, Samad; Dong, Mei Qin; Mehta, Dhara; Pham, Vinh P.; Papadopoulos, John; Dubrovskaya, Yanina",Infect Dis Clin Pract (Baltim Md),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34191902/; https://doi.org/10.1097/ipc.0000000000000982,33

METHODS: Twenty-six patients whose treatment had been completed and who had no previous hearing or balance complaints were included in the study. Patients diagnosed with the disease by PCR were included in the study. Patients with at least one month of illness were included in the study. The hearing of patients was evaluated with transient evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAE) and pure-tone audiometry. Bedside tests, the European Evaluation of Vertigo scale (EEV), Video Head Impulse Test (vHIT), Ocular Vestibular Myogenic Evoked Potential (oVEMP), Cervical Vestibular Myogenic Evoked Potential (cVEMP) and Videonystagmography (VNG) tests were applied to evaluate the vestibular system. RESULTS: A statistically significant difference was found between the COVID-19 positive and control groups according to the mean values of the 4000 Hz and 8000 Hz in both the right and left ears (p < 0.05). No statistically significant difference was found in the other frequencies and TEOAE. No statistically significant difference was found between the COVID-19 positive and control groups in terms of their normal or pathological VNG saccade, optokinetic and spontaneous nystagmus values (p > 0.05). The normal and pathological VNG head shake values were found to be significantly different between the COVID-19 positive and control groups (p < 0.05). CONCLUSİON: The high frequencies in audiometry in the COVID-19 positive group were worse than those in the control group. In the vestibular system, especially in oVEMP and cVEMP, asymmetric findings were obtained in comparison to the control group, and a low gain in vHIT was shown. This study shows that the audiovestibular system of people with COVID-19 infection may be affected.","Tan, Mehmet; Cengiz, Deniz Uğur; Demir, İsmail; Demirel, Sümeyye; Çolak, Sanem Can; Karakaş, Oğuz; Bayındır, Tuba",Am J Otolaryngol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34392022/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S019607092100274X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjoto.2021.103173; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S019607092100274X?v=s5,33

The potential animal reservoirs for SARS-CoV-2 are currently unknown, however sequence analysis has provided plausible potential candidate species. SARS-CoV-2 binds to the angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to enable its entry into host cells and establish infection. We analyzed the binding surface of ACE2 from several important animal species to begin to understand the parameters for the ACE2 recognition by the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD). We employed Shannon entropy analysis to determine the variability of ACE2 across its sequence and particularly in its RBD interacting region, and assessed differences between various species' ACE2 and human ACE2. Recombinant ACE2 from human, hamster, horseshoe bat, cat, ferret, and cow were evaluated for RBD binding. A gradient of binding affinities were seen where human and hamster ACE2 were similarly in the low nanomolar range, followed by cat and cow. Surprisingly, horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus sinicus) and ferret (Mustela putorius) ACE2s had poor binding activity compared to the other species' ACE2. The residue differences and binding properties between the species' variants provide a framework for understanding ACE2-RBD binding and virus tropism.","Gan, Jessie L; Huang, Ruiqi; Kelley, Abigail; Warner, Gabrielle; McGregor, Duncan; Smider, Vaughn V",Biochem. j,https://doi.org/10.1042/bcj20200908; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34558627/,33

We aimed to investigate the blood coagulation function and its influences on clinical outcomes of patients with syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) infection. METHODS: A total of 71 severe patients with confirmed SARS‐CoV‐2 infection who were treated in Wuhan First Hospital from February 12 to March 20, 2020, were enrolled. The blood coagulation data in these patients and in 61 healthy controls were collected. The patients with COVID‐19 were divided into two groups: the aggravated group and the nonaggravated group, respectively, basing on whether the patients' conditions turned to critically ill or not after admission. RESULTS: Compared with healthy controls, patients with COVID‐19 had significant performances with coagulation dysfunction, including dramatically elevated values of FIB, PT, APTT, INR, FDP, and D‐Dimers but markedly reduced AT value (P < .05). Importantly, more noteworthy coagulation disorders similar to the differences between patients and controls were found in the aggravated patients with conditions deterioration after admission than those in the nonaggravated patients without conditions deterioration (P < .05). Moreover, the aggravated patients possessed a longer hospital stay and a higher mortality compared with the nonaggravated patients (P < .001). The coagulation parameters of COVID‐19 patients were widely and closely related to the indexes of liver function and inflammation (P < .05), indicating the coagulation dysfunction of these patients may be caused by liver injury and inflammatory storm. CONCLUSION: Severe patients with SARS‐CoV‐2 infection often possess coagulation dysfunction on admission. A certain correlation exists in coagulation disorder and adverse clinical outcome among severe COVID‐19 patients.","Zhang, Yanhong; He, Liwei; Chen, Huixin; Lu, Shuangyan; Xiong, Yongfen; Liu, Juan; Zheng, Yao; Wang, Shun; Liu, Lei",Int J Lab Hematol,https://doi.org/10.1111/ijlh.13273; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32592539/,33
645929,Next WHO Director-General: hear the angels while fighting the wolves,2017-02-15,"Résumé L’indemnisation des accidents médicaux sans faute des professionnels ou des établissements est prévue par l’article L.1142-1 du code de la santé publique créé par la loi du 4 mars 2002 relative aux droits des malades et à la qualité du système de santé. Il indique les conditions d’imputabilité, de critères cliniques et de gravité. Parmi les critères cliniques « un accident médical (…) ouvre droit à la réparation des préjudices (…) au titre de la solidarité nationale, lorsqu’ils (…) qu’ils ont eu pour le patient des conséquences anormales au regard de son état de santé comme de l’évolution prévisible de celui-ci (…) ». Les ordres juridictionnels ont eu à caractériser cette « anormalité des conséquences ». Selon la jurisprudence du Conseil d’État du 12 décembre 2014 la condition d’anormalité est toujours « remplie lorsque l'acte médical a entraîné des conséquences notablement plus graves que celles auxquelles le patient était exposé de manière suffisamment probable en l’absence de traitement » et si tel n’est pas le cas, « elles ne peuvent être regardées comme anormales sauf si, dans les conditions où l’acte a été accompli, la survenance du dommage présentait une probabilité faible ; qu’ainsi, elles ne peuvent être regardées comme anormales au regard de l’état du patient lorsque la gravité de cet état a conduit à pratiquer un acte comportant des risques élevés dont la réalisation est à l’origine du dommage ». Le Conseil d’Etat a précisé, en 2019 qu’une probabilité de survenance de 3 % était une probabilité faible. Summary Compensation for no-fault medical accidents to professionals or establishments is provided for by article L.1142-1 of the public health code, created by the law of March 4, 2002 relating to the rights of patients and the quality of the health system. It indicates the conditions of accountability, clinical criteria and severity. Among the clinical criteria ""a medical accident (...) gives the right to compensation for damages (...) in the name of national solidarity, when (...) they have had abnormal consequences for the patient in view of his condition as well as the foreseeable evolution of it (…)”. The jurisdictional orders have had to characterize this ""abnormality of the consequences"". According to the jurisprudence of the Conseil d’Etat of December 12, 2014 the condition of abnormality is always ""satisfied when the medical act entailed consequences significantly more serious than those to which the patient was exposed in a sufficiently probable way in the absence of treatment "". And if this is not the case,"" they cannot be regarded as abnormal unless, under the conditions in which the act was performed, the occurrence of damage presented a low probability; that thus, they cannot be regarded as abnormal with regard to the state of the patient when the gravity of this state led to practicing an act involving high risks whose realization is at the origin of the damage "".

The findings suggest that the impact of social distancing measures on purchase intentions is mediated by the trust in the targeted restaurant and hotel. Risk tolerance significantly moderates the influence of social distancing measures on trust; (non-) cash promotions have an insignificant impact on purchase intentions.

646619,Exposure science in an infectious disease pandemic: who do we want to be?,2020-10-07,"ABSTRACT: Short synthetic peptide molecules which bind to a specific target protein with a high affinity to exert its function are known as peptide aptamers. The high specificity of aptamers with small-molecule targets (metal ions, dyes and theophylline; ATP) is within 1 pM and 1 μM range, whereas with the proteins (thrombin, CD4 and antibodies) it is in the nanomolar range (which is equivalent to monoclonal antibodies). The recently identified coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) genome encodes for various proteins, such as envelope, membrane, nucleocapsid, and spike protein. Among these, the protein necessary for the virus to enter inside the host cell is spike protein. The work focuses on designing peptide aptamer targeting the spike receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2. The peptide aptamer has been designed by using bacterial Thioredoxin A as the scaffold protein and an 18-residue-long peptide. The tertiary structure of the peptide aptamer is modeled and docked to spike receptor-binding domain of SARS CoV2. Molecular dynamic simulation has been done to check the stability of the aptamer and receptor-binding domain complex. It was observed that the aptamer binds to spike receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 in a similar pattern as that of ACE2. The aptamer–receptor-binding domain complex was found to be stable in a 100 ns molecular dynamic simulation. The aptamer is also predicted to be non-antigenic, non-allergenic, non-hemolytic, non-inflammatory, water-soluble with high affinity toward ACE2 than serum albumin. Thus, peptide aptamer can be a novel approach for the therapeutic treatment for SARS-CoV-2. GRAPHICAL ABSTRACT: [Image: see text]","Devi, Arpita; Chaitanya, Nyshadham S.

646656,Design a Database of Italian Vascular Alimurgic Flora (AlimurgITA): Preliminary Results,2021-04-10,"RATIONALE: Viruses are the most common pathogens that can cause infection-related non-recurrent death after transplantation, occurring mostly from the early stages of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) to within 1 year after transplantation. Human coronavirus (HCoV)-NL63 is a coronavirus that could cause mortality among patients with underlying disease complications. Serological tests are of limited diagnostic value in immunocompromised hosts and cases of latent infection reactivation. In contrast, macro-genomic high-throughput (DNA and RNA) sequencing allows for rapid and accurate diagnosis of infecting pathogens for targeted treatment. PATIENT CONCERNS: In this report, we describe a patient who exhibited acute B-lymphocytic leukemia and developed complicated pulmonary HCoV-NL63 infection after a second allogeneic HSCT (allo-HSCT). Six months after the second allo-HSCT, he developed sudden-onset hyperthermia and cough with decreased oxygen saturation. Chest computed tomography (CT) suggested bilateral multiple rounded ground-glass opacities with the pulmonary lobules as units. DIAGNOSES: HCoV-NL63 was detected by metagenomic next-generation sequencing (NGS), and HCoV-NL63 viral pneumonia was diagnosed. INTERVENTIONS: The treatment was mainly based on the use of antiviral therapy, hormone administration, and gamma-globulin. OUTCOMES: After the therapy, the body temperature returned to normal, the chest CT findings had improved on review, and the viral copy number eventually became negative. LESSONS: The latest NGS is an effective method for early infection diagnosis. The HCoV-NL63 virus can cause inflammatory factor storm and alter the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR). This case suggests that the patient's NLR and cytokine levels could be monitored during the clinical treatment to assess the disease and its treatment outcome in a timely manner.","Li, Zhihui; Meng, Shuo; Zheng, Qinlong; Wu, Tong",Medicine (Baltimore),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34160438/; https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000026446,33

Rapid research and development, on an international scale, has already generated assays for detecting SARS-CoV-2 RNA and host immunoglobulins. However, the complexities of COVID-19 are such that fuller definitions of patient status, trajectory, sequelae, and responses to therapy are now required. There is accumulating evidence—from studies of both COVID-19 and the related disease SARS—that protein biomarkers could help to provide this definition. Proteins associated with blood coagulation (D-dimer), cell damage (lactate dehydrogenase), and the inflammatory response (e.g., C-reactive protein) have already been identified as possible predictors of COVID-19 severity or mortality. Proteomics technologies, with their ability to detect many proteins per analysis, have begun to extend these early findings. To be effective, proteomics strategies must include not only methods for comprehensive data acquisition (e.g., using mass spectrometry) but also informatics approaches via which to derive actionable information from large data sets. Here we review applications of proteomics to COVID-19 and SARS and outline how pipelines involving technologies such as artificial intelligence could be of value for research on these diseases.","Whetton, Anthony D.; Preston, George W.; Abubeker, Semira; Geifman, Nophar",J Proteome Res,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jproteome.0c00326; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32657586/,33

Yet, efforts to improve worker well-being in the United States are often focused on changing individual health behaviors via employer wellness programs. The COVID-19 health crisis has brought into sharp relief some of the limitations of current approaches, revealing structural conditions that heighten the vulnerability of workers and their families to physical and psychosocial stressors. To address these gaps, we build on existing frameworks and work redesign research to propose a model of work redesign updated for the 21st century that identifies strategies to reshape work conditions that are a root cause of stress-related health problems. These strategies include increasing worker schedule control and voice, moderating job demands, and providing training and employer support aimed at enhancing social relations at work. We conclude that work redesign offers new and viable directions for improving worker well-being and that guidance from federal and state governments could encourage the adoption and effective implementation of such initiatives.

Two internally quenched fluorogenic peptides, 1NC and 2NC, corresponding to the N-terminal and the C-terminal autocleavage sites of SARS-CoV 3CL(pro), respectively, were used as substrates. SARS-CoV 3CL(pro) seemed to work more efficiently on 1NC than on 2NC in trans-cleavage assay. Mutational analysis demonstrated that the His41 residue, the N-terminal 7 amino acids, and the domain III of SARS-CoV 3CL(pro) were important for the enzymatic activity. Antibodies recognizing domain III could significantly inhibit the enzymatic activity of SARS-CoV 3CL(pro).

653151,Ligand-based approach for predicting drug targets and for virtual screening against COVID-19,2021-01-18,"Following the outbreak of COVID-19, governments took unprecedented measures to curb the spread of the virus. Public participation in decisions regarding (the relaxation of) these measures has been notably absent, despite being recommended in the literature. Here, as one of the exceptions, we report the results of 30,000 citizens advising the government on eight different possibilities for relaxing lockdown measures in the Netherlands. By making use of the novel method Participatory Value Evaluation (PVE), participants were asked to recommend which out of the eight options they prefer to be relaxed. Participants received information regarding the societal impacts of each relaxation option, such as the impact of the option on the healthcare system. The results of the PVE informed policymakers about peoples preferences regarding (the impacts of) the relaxation options. For instance, we established that participants assign an equal value to a reduction of 100 deaths among citizens younger than 70 years and a reduction of 168 deaths among citizens older than 70 years. We show how these preferences can be used to rank options in terms of desirability. Citizens advised to relax lockdown measures, but not to the point at which the healthcare system becomes heavily overloaded. We found wide support for prioritising the re-opening of contact professions. Conversely, participants disfavoured options to relax restrictions for specific groups of citizens as they found it important that decisions lead to unity and not to division. 80% of the participants state that PVE is a good method to let citizens participate in government decision-making on relaxing lockdown measures. Participants felt that they could express a nuanced opinion, communicate arguments, and appreciated the opportunity to evaluate relaxation options in comparison to each other while being informed about the consequences of each option. This increased their awareness of the dilemmas the government faces.","Mouter, N.; Hernandez, J. I.; Itten, A.

Many regions have struggled to adapt to disruptions to health care practice and employ systems that effectively manage the demand for services. Objective: To examine the effectiveness of the first five weeks of a 24/7 physician-staffed COVID-19 hotline. Design: Cohort study using electronic health records. Setting: A single large health care system in Northeast Ohio. Participants: During 5 weeks of operation, 10,112 patients called the hotline (callers) and were evaluated by a registered nurse (RN) using standardized protocols. Of these, 4,213 (42%) were referred for a physician telehealth visit (telehealth patients). The mean age of callers was 42 years. 67% were female, 51% white, and 46% were on Medicaid or uninsured. Intervention: Physician telehealth visits for COVID-19. Main Outcomes and Measures: We describe clinical diagnosis, patient characteristics (age, sex race/ethnicity, smoking status, insurance status), and visit disposition. We use logistic regression to evaluate associations between patient characteristics, visit disposition and subsequent emergency department use, hospitalization, and SARS-Cov-2 PCR testing. Results: Common caller concerns included cough, fever, and shortness of breath. Most telehealth patients (79%) were advised to self-isolate at home, 14% were determined to be unlikely to have COVID-19, 3% were advised to seek emergency care, and 4% had miscellaneous other dispositions. A total of 287 (7%) patients had a subsequent ED visit, and 44 (1%) were hospitalized with a COVID-19 diagnosis. Of the callers, 482 (5%) had a COVID-19 test reported with 69 (14%) testing positive. Among patients advised to stay at home, 83% had no further face-to-face visits. In multivariable results, only a physician recommendation to seek emergency care was associated with emergency room use (OR=4.73, 95%CI 1.37-16.39, p=.014). Only older age was associated with having a positive test result. Conclusions and Relevance: Robust, physician-directed telehealth services can meet a wide range of needs during the acute phase of a pandemic, conserving scarce resources such as personal protective equipment and testing supplies and preventing the spread of infections to patients and health care workers.","Margolius, D.; Hennekes, M.; Yaho, J.; Einstadter, D.; Gunzler, D.; Chehade, N.; Sehgal, A.

Mapping this potential of performance contributes to the discussion about the use of LBAS in France and paves the way for a broader assessment of the effectiveness of alerting solutions in order to propose a multi-channel system that will consider the territorial characteristics.","Bopp, Esteban; Douvinet, Johnny",Int J Disaster Risk Reduct,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2212420920314114; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijdrr.2020.101909; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33052302/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212420920314114?v=s5,33

In this study, we report the design, preclinical development, immunogenicity and anti-viral protective effect in rhesus macaques of the BNT162b2 vaccine candidate. BNT162b2 contains an LNP-formulated nucleoside-modified mRNA that encodes the spike glycoprotein captured in its prefusion conformation. After expression of the BNT162b2 coding sequence in cells, approximately 20% of the spike molecules are in the one-RBD ‘up’, two-RBD ‘down’ state. Immunisation of mice with a single dose of BNT162b2 induced dose level-dependent increases in pseudovirus neutralisation titers. Prime-boost vaccination of rhesus macaques elicited authentic SARS-CoV-2 neutralising geometric mean titers 10.2 to 18.0 times that of a SARS-CoV-2 convalescent human serum panel. BNT162b2 generated strong TH1 type CD4+ and IFNγ+ CD8+ T-cell responses in mice and rhesus macaques. The BNT162b2 vaccine candidate fully protected the lungs of immunised rhesus macaques from infectious SARS-CoV-2 challenge. BNT162b2 is currently being evaluated in a global, pivotal Phase 2/3 trial (NCT04368728).","Vogel, Annette B.; Kanevsky, Isis; Che, Ye; Swanson, Kena A.; Muik, Alexander; Vormehr, Mathias; Kranz, Lena M.; Walzer, Kerstin C.; Hein, Stephanie; Güler, Alptekin; Loschko, Jakob; Maddur, Mohan S.; Tompkins, Kristin; Cole, Journey; Lui, Bonny G.; Ziegenhals, Thomas; Plaschke, Arianne; Eisel, David; Dany, Sarah C.; Fesser, Stephanie; Erbar, Stephanie; Bates, Ferdia; Schneider, Diana; Jesionek, Bernadette; Sänger, Bianca; Wallisch, Ann-Kathrin; Feuchter, Yvonne; Junginger, Hanna; Krumm, Stefanie A.; Heinen, André P.; Adams-Quack, Petra; Schlereth, Julia; Kröner, Christoph; Hall-Ursone, Shannan; Brasky, Kathleen; Griffor, Matthew C.; Han, Seungil; Lees, Joshua A.; Mashalidis, Ellene H.; Sahasrabudhe, Parag V.; Tan, Charles Y.; Pavliakova, Danka; Singh, Guy; Fontes-Garfias, Camila; Pride, Michael; Scully, Ingrid L.; Ciolino, Tara; Obregon, Jennifer; Gazi, Michal; Carrion, Ricardo; Alfson, Kendra J.; Kalina, Warren V.; Kaushal, Deepak; Shi, Pei-Yong; Klamp, Thorsten; Rosenbaum, Corinna; Kuhn, Andreas N.; Türeci, Özlem; Dormitzer, Philip R.; Jansen, Kathrin U.; Sahin, Ugur",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.08.280818,33
655234,Variation of positiveness to enhance testing of specimens during an epidemic,2020-04-29,"OBJECTIVE: The burden of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) illness is not well characterised in primary care. We estimated the burden of disease attributable to RSV in children in the UK between 1995 and 2009. DESIGN: Time-series regression modelling. SETTING: A multiple linear regression model based on weekly viral surveillance (RSV and influenza, Public Health England), and controlled for non-specific seasonal drivers of disease, estimated the proportion of general practitioner (GP) episodes of care (counted as first visit in a series within 28 days; Clinical Practice Research Datalink, CPRD), hospitalisations (Hospital Episode Statistics, HES) and deaths (Office of National Statistics, ONS) attributable to RSV each season. PARTICIPANTS: Children 0–17 years registered with a GP in CPRD, or with a respiratory disease outcome in the HES or ONS databases. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: RSV-attributable burden of GP episodes, hospitalisations and deaths due to respiratory disease by age. RSV-attributable burden associated with selected antibiotic prescriptions. RESULTS: RSV-attributable respiratory disease in the UK resulted in an estimated 450 158 GP episodes, 29 160 hospitalisations and 83 deaths per average season in children and adolescents, with the highest proportions in children <6 months of age (14 441/100 000 population, 4184/100 000 and 6/100 000, respectively). In an average season, there were an estimated 125 478 GP episodes for otitis media and 416 133 prescriptions for antibiotics attributable to RSV. More GP episodes, hospitalisations and deaths from respiratory disease were attributable to RSV than to influenza in children under 5 years. CONCLUSIONS: The burden of RSV in children in the UK exceeds that of influenza. RSV in children and adolescents contributes substantially to GP office visits for a diverse range of illnesses, and was associated with an average 416 133 prescribed antibiotic courses per season. Effective antiviral treatments and preventive vaccines are urgently needed for the management of RSV infection in children.

Various guidelines suggest the use of video-laryngoscope (VL) as the first device to aid intubation in a COVID patient. The best VL to facilitate intubation in such a setting especially by novices is not ascertained. We compared intubation characteristics by two VL's (McGrath-MAC and C-MAC) for intubation in a COVID simulated mannequin by novices. METHODOLOGY: This prospective randomized manikin-based crossover study was done in thirty medical professionals with no previous experience of intubation with VL. All participants were trained on Laerdel airway management trainer and were allowed 5 practice sessions with each scope with an intubation box while wearing face protective personal protective equipment (PPE). Participants were randomized into two groups of 15 each, one group performed the intubation first with McGrath and the other with C-MAC before crossing over. RESULTS: The mean (S. D.) time to intubation was similar with both McGrath-VL and CMAC VL [31.33 (14.72) s vs 26.47 (8.5) s, P = (p-0.063)]. POGO score [mean (S. D.)] was better with CMAC [81.33 (16.24) vs 60.33 (14.73), p-0.00. The majority of the users preferred C-MAC VL for intubation (93.33%). The incidence of failed intubation and multiple attempts at intubating were similar with the two scopes. CONCLUSION: The time to intubation was similar with both VL's but the majority of novices preferred CMAC probably due to a bigger screen that helped them to have a better view of glottis in the COVID simulated mannequin.","Vig, Saurabh; Bhan, Swati; Gupta, Nishkarsh; Meena, Jitendra Kumar; Bhatnagar, Sushma",Saudi J Anaesth,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34188630/; https://doi.org/10.4103/sja.sja_1058_20,33

As a research project, TIRCON received funding in the 7th Framework Programme (FP7) of the European Union (EU) from 2011 to 2015. After successful and timely completion of the initial FP7 project, funding and donations from industry and patient organizations have sustained the further development of TIRCON's dedicated clinical research infrastructure and its governance architecture, as well as the ongoing efforts undertaken in the NBIA community to establish a network of care. From the beginning, the University Hospital of the Ludwig-Maximilians-University in Munich, Germany has been coordinating the TIRCON initiative. It consists of 8 work packages, of which the first double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, multi-site clinical trial in NBIA (deferiprone in PKAN, completed) and a global patient registry and biobank, currently comprising baseline and follow-up data of > 400 NBIA patients have gained particular importance. Here we describe TIRCON's history with all the challenges and achievements in diagnosing and treating NBIA. Today, TIRCON lays the ground for future clinical care and research.

658311,Robotic in situ 3D bio-printing technology for repairing large segmental bone defects,2020-11-25,"Introduction: Transmission of SARS-Cov-2 through aerosol has been implicated particularly in the presence of highly concentrated aerosols in enclosed environments. It is accepted that aerosols are produced during a range of dental procedures, posing potential risks to both dental practitioners and patients. There has been little agreement concerning aerosol transmission associated with orthodontics and associated mitigation. Methods: Orthodontic procedures were simulated in a closed side-surgery using a dental manikin on an acrylic model using composite-based adhesive. Adhesive removal representing debonding was undertaken using a 1:1 contra-angle handpiece and fast hand-piece with variation in air and water flow. The removal of acid etch was also simulated with use of combined 3-in-1 air water syringe to remove etch. An optical particle scanner and a spectrometer particle scanner were both to assess particulate matter ranging from 'very small' (0.08 - 0.26 um) to large (2.7 - 10 um). Results: Standard debonding procedure (involving air but no water) was associated with clear increase in the very small and small (0.26 - 0.9 um) particles, but only for a short period with no significant increases for other sizes. Debonding procedures without air appeared to produce similar levels of aerosol to standard debonding. Debonding in association with water tended to produce large increase in aerosol levels, producing particles of all sizes throughout the experiment. The use of water and a fast hand-piece led to the most significant increase in particles. Combined use of the 3-in-1 air water syringe did not result in any detectable increase in the aerosol levels. Conclusions: Particulate matter was released during orthodontic debonding, although the concentration and volume was markedly less than that associated with the use of a fast hand-piece. No increase in particulates was associated with prolonged use of a 3-in-1 air-water syringe. Particulate levels reduced to baseline levels over a short period (approx. 5 minutes). Further research within alternative, open environments and without air exchange systems is required.","Din, A.

658460,Phytochemical profile of Paulownia tomentosa (Thunb). Steud.,2014-08-29,"BACKGROUND: Clinically, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with a wide range of symptoms, which can range from mild complaints of an upper respiratory infection to life-threatening hypoxic respiratory insufficiency and multiorgan failure. OBJECTIVE: The initially identified pulmonary damage patterns, such as diffuse alveolar damage in acute lung failure, are accompanied by new findings that draw a more complex scenario. These include microvascular involvement and a wide range of associated pathologies of multiple organ systems. A back-scaling of microstructural vascular changes is possible via targeted correlation of pathological autopsy results with radiological imaging. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Radiological and pathological correlation as well as microradiological imaging to investigate microvascular involvement in fatal COVID-19. RESULTS: The cases of two COVID-19 patients are presented. Patient 1 showed a relative hypoperfusion in lung regions that did not have typical COVID-19 infiltrates; the targeted post-mortem correlation also showed subtle signs of microvascular damage even in these lung sections. Patient 2 showed both radiologically and pathologically advanced typical COVID-19 destruction of lung structures and the case illustrates the damage patterns of the blood-air barrier. The perfusion deficit of the intestinal wall shown in computed tomography of patient 2 could not ultimately clearly be microscopically attributed to intestinal microvascular damage. CONCLUSION: In addition to microvascular thrombosis, our results indicate a functional pulmonary vasodysregulation as part of the pathophysiology during the vascular phase of COVID-19. The clinical relevance of autopsies and the integration of radiological imaging findings into histopathological injury patterns must be emphasized for a better understanding of COVID-19.","Wagner, W.

The COVID-19 pandemic combined several features that, individually, had been shown to negatively affect sleep health in the general population. Those features included state of crisis, restrictions on in-person social interactions, as well as financial adversity. To address the lack of a comprehensive summary of sleep research across these three distinctive domains, we undertook three parallel systematic reviews based on the following themes: 1) Sleep in times of crises; 2) Sleep and social isolation; and 3) Sleep and economic uncertainty. Using a scoping review framework, we systematically identified and summarized findings from these three separated bodies of works. Potential moderating factors such as age, sex, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, psychological predisposition, occupation and other personal circumstances are also discussed. To conclude, we propose novel lines of research necessary to alleviate the short- and long-term impacts of the COVID-19 crises and highlight the need to prepare the deployment of sleep solutions in future crises.","Simonelli, Guido; Petit, Dominique; Delage, Julia Pizzamiglio; Michaud, Xavier; Lavoie, Marie Denise; Morin, Charles M.; Godbout, Roger; Robillard, Rebecca; Vallières, Annie; Carrier, Julie; Bastien, Célyne",Sleep Med Rev,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1087079221001301; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34571477/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.smrv.2021.101545; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1087079221001301,33
661132,Pneumoscrotum Caused by a Bronchopleural Fistula,2021-08-18,"The epidemic threshold of a social system is the ratio of infection and recovery rate above which a disease spreading in it becomes an epidemic. In the absence of pharmaceutical interventions (i.e. vaccines), the only way to control a given disease is to move this threshold by non-pharmaceutical interventions like social distancing, past the epidemic threshold corresponding to the disease, thereby tipping the system from epidemic into a non-epidemic regime. Modeling the disease as a spreading process on a social graph, social distancing can be modeled by removing some of the graphs links. It has been conjectured that the largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix of the resulting graph corresponds to the systems epidemic threshold. Here we use a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method to study those link removals that do well at reducing the largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix. The MCMC method generates samples from the relative canonical network ensemble with a defined expectation value of [Formula: see text] . We call this the “well-controlling network ensemble” (WCNE) and compare its structure to randomly thinned networks with the same link density. We observe that networks in the WCNE tend to be more homogeneous in the degree distribution and use this insight to define two ad-hoc removal strategies, which also substantially reduce the largest eigenvalue. A targeted removal of 80% of links can be as effective as a random removal of 90%, leaving individuals with twice as many contacts. Finally, by simulating epidemic spreading via either an SIS or an SIR model on network ensembles created with different link removal strategies (random, WCNE, or degree-homogenizing), we show that tipping from an epidemic to a non-epidemic state happens at a larger critical ratio between infection rate and recovery rate for WCNE and degree-homogenized networks than for those obtained by random removals.","Ansari, Sara; Anvari, Mehrnaz; Pfeffer, Oskar; Molkenthin, Nora; Moosavi, Mohammad R.; Hellmann, Frank; Heitzig, Jobst; Kurths, Jürgen",Eur Phys J Spec Top,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34221247/; https://doi.org/10.1140/epjs/s11734-021-00138-5,33

This pathogen has spread rapidly across the world, causing high numbers of deaths and significant social and economic impacts. SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus with a suggested zoonotic origin with the potential for cross-species transmission among animals. Antarctica can be considered the only continent free of SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, concerns have been expressed regarding the potential human introduction of this virus to the continent through the activities of research or tourism to minimise the effects on human health, and the potential for virus transmission to Antarctic wildlife. We assess the reverse-zoonotic transmission risk to Antarctic wildlife by considering the available information on host susceptibility, dynamics of the infection in humans, and contact interactions between humans and Antarctic wildlife. The environmental conditions in Antarctica seem to be favourable for the virus stability. Indoor spaces such as those at research stations, research vessels or tourist cruise ships could allow for more transmission among humans and depending on their movements between different locations the virus could be spread across the continent. Among Antarctic wildlife previous in silico analyses suggested that cetaceans are at greater risk of infection whereas seals and birds appear to be at a low infection risk. However, caution needed until further research is carried out and consequently, the precautionary principle should be applied. Field researchers handling animals are identified as the human group posing the highest risk of transmission to animals while tourists and other personnel pose a significant risk only when in close proximity (< 5 m) to Antarctic fauna.

With the occurrence of AIDS and the discovery of new pathogens the come-back of infectious diseases was noted, 15 to 20 years later, and the concept of emerging infections was defined. An emerging infection is the appearance of a new infection or the increase of its incidence if not new. It also includes infections for which the incidence could increase because of favorable conditions. Several scenarios can be proposed: 1) the appearance of a new infection (AIDS or SARS); 2) the appearance of a known infection where it did not exist previously (West Nile virus infection in the USA); 3) an infection that existed but that was not diagnosed or could not be linked precisely to a particular infectious agent (hepatitis C before the discovery of the hepatitis C virus; 4) a known infection that increases its usual incidence (outbreaks…); 5) infectious diseases for which current conditions may facilitate transmission (decrease of immunization coverage...). The deliberate release of a biological agent is one of the possible scenarios of emergence. Qualitative changes of infectious agents such as the resistance to anti-infectious agents may also contribute, through a selection mechanism, to the emergence of new infectious threat. Emerging infections result from the interaction between the agent, the host, and environment evolving according to human activity.

Neutralizing antibodies that disrupt the interaction of RBD and ACE2 has been under the spotlight as a way of developing the COVID-19 treatment. Some animals, such as llamas, manufacture heavy-chain antibodies that have a single variable domain (VHH) instead of two variable domains (VH/VL) as opposed to typical antibodies. Nanobodies are antigen-specific, single-domain, changeable segments of camelid heavy chain-only antibodies that are recombinantly produced. These types of antibodies exhibit a wide range of strong physical and chemical properties, like high solubility, and stability. The VHH's high-affinity attachment to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) allowed the neutralization of SARS-CoV-2. To tackle COVID-19, some nanobodies are being developed against SARS-CoV-2, some of which have been recently included in clinical trials. Nanobody therapy may be useful in managing the COVID-19 pandemic as a potent and low-cost treatment. This paper describes the application of nanobodies as a new class of recombinant antibodies in COVID-19 treatment.","Zebardast, Arghavan; Hosseini, Parastoo; Hasanzadeh, Ali; latifi, Tayebeh",Mol Biol Rep,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11033-021-06819-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34648139/,33

Children are more likely to be asymptomatic or have milder symptoms and less likely to present for healthcare and be tested for SARS-CoV-2; thus, our current estimates are likely under-representative of the true burden of SARS-CoV-2 in children. Given the potential direct benefit of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in children and the substantial indirect benefit through community protection or ‘herd immunity’, we argue that planning and implementation of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines should include children. Furthermore, community protection occurred after widespread implementation of prior childhood vaccines against Streptococcus pneumoniae, rubella and rotavirus. We detail considerations for vaccine clinical trials, potential barriers to the implementation of widespread vaccination and argue why children would be an ideal target population for vaccination.","Kao, Carol M; Orenstein, Walter A; Anderson, Evan J",Clin Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa712; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32492123/,33

Some of the questions that have been asked can be addressed by computational modeling based on the use of high-performance computing (HPC) and machine learning techniques. The Reference Model previously used such techniques to model diabetes. The Reference Model is now used to answer a few questions on COVID-19, while changing the traditional susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model approach. This adaptation allows us to answer questions such as the probability of transmission per encounter, disease duration, and mortality rate. The Reference Model uses data on US infection and mortality from 52 states and territories combining multiple assumptions of human interactions to compute the best fitting parameters that explain the disease behavior for given assumptions and accumulated data from April 2020 to June 2020. This is a preliminary report aimed at demonstrating the possible use of computational models based on computing power to aid comprehension of disease characteristics.

This study aims to describe the evolving impact of COVID‐19 on surgical activity and patient outcomes at a major public tertiary referral hospital. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study involving adult surgical patients treated at a large public tertiary referral hospital in Sydney, Australia. Surgical activity, surgical outcomes and patient demographics were compared across two time periods, including the ‘first wave’ (February–May 2020 vs. February–May 2019) and the ‘perseverance phase’ (June–September 2020 vs. June–September 2019). Variables across both groups were compared using an independent t test or chi‐squared test. RESULTS: A −32% reduction in surgical separations was observed in the ‘first wave’, including −20% emergency and −37% elective. In the ‘perseverance phase’, there was a −19% reduction in surgical activity, including 0% emergency and −27% elective. The average length of stay, intensive care admissions, postoperative complications and in‐hospital costs significantly increased in the ‘first wave’. The proportion of public patients increased marginally (3%) in the ‘first wave’. CONCLUSION: The impact of COVID‐19 was most severely experienced in the initial months of the pandemic and observed in the number of patients treated. Although there was an initial effect on surgical outcomes, overall, the standard of care remained safe. The delivery of elective surgery remains a challenge and reflects the ongoing system‐wide changes that are required to manage the COVID‐19 pandemic.","McBride, Kate E.; Steffens, Daniel; Solomon, Michael J.",ANZ J Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34152669/; https://doi.org/10.1111/ans.17016,33

We describe a nested RT-PCR assay (~1500 bps) to detect multiple key spike protein mutations distinctive of the major known circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants, including the three Variants of Concern (VOCs) 20I/501Y.V1 (United Kingdom), 20H/501Y.V2 (South Africa), and 20J/501Y.V3 (Brazil), as well as the 20E.EU1 variant (Spain), the CAL.20C recently identified in California, and the mink-associated variant (GR, lineage B.1.1.298). Prior to application to field samples, the discriminatory potential of this PCR assay was explored using GISAID and Nextclade. To extend variant detection to challenging matrices such as sewage, where the amplification of long fragments is problematic, two short nested RT-PCR assays (~300 bps) were also designed, targeting portions of the region spanned by the long nested assay. The three newly-designed assays were then tested on field samples, including 7 fully-sequenced viral isolates from swab samples and 34 urban wastewater samples, some of which collected in areas where circulation of VOCs had been reported. The long assay successfully amplified all the previously characterized viral isolates, allowing the correct identification of variants 20I/501Y.V1 and 20E.EU1 present in the panel. The sequences obtained using the short assays were consistent with those obtained with the long assay. Mutations characteristic of VOCs (UK and Brazilian variant) and of other variant (Spanish) were detected in sewage samples. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence of the presence of sequences harboring key mutations of 20I/501Y.V1 and 20J/501Y.V3 in urban wastewaters, highlighting the potential contribution of wastewater surveillance to explore SARS-CoV-2 diversity. The developed nested RT-PCR assays can be used as an initial rapid screening test to select clinical samples containing mutations of interest. This can speed up diagnosis and optimize resources since it allows full genome sequencing to be done only on clinically relevant specimens. The assays can be also employed for a rapid and cost-effective detection of VOCs or other variants in sewage for the purposes of wastewater-based epidemiology. The approach proposed here can be used to better understand SARS-CoV-2 variant diversity, geographic distribution and impact worldwide.","La Rosa, G.; Mancini, P.; Bonanno Ferraro, G.; Veneri, C.; Iaconelli, M.; Lucentini, L.; Bonadonna, L.; Brusaferro, S.; Brandtner, D.; Fasanella, A.; Pace, L.; Parisi, A.; Galante, D.; Suffredini, E.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.09.21252450; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.09.21252450v1?rss=1,33

The vaccine encodes an alphavirus-based replicon and the SARS-CoV-2 full length spike glycoprotein. Translation of the replicon produces a replicase complex that amplifies and prolong SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein expression. A single prime vaccination in mice led to robust antibody responses, with neutralizing antibody titers increasing up to day 60. Activation of cell mediated immunity produced a strong viral antigen specific CD8+ T lymphocyte response. Assaying for intracellular cytokine staining for IFN-γ and IL-4 positive CD4+ T helper lymphocytes as well as anti-spike glycoprotein IgG2a/IgG1 ratios supported a strong Th1 dominant immune response. Finally, single LUNAR-COV19 vaccination at both 2 μg and 10 μg doses completely protected human ACE2 transgenic mice from both mortality and even measurable infection following wild-type SARS-CoV-2 challenge.

Assisted living (AL) is a type of long-term care setting for older adults who need supportive care but not ongoing nursing care and emphasizes a social model of care provision. Because AL is a type of long-term care, it has at times been referenced along with nursing homes in discussions related to COVID-19 but not recognized for its different care practices that pose unique challenges related to COVID-19; in that manner, it has largely been left out of the COVID-19 discourse, although ~812,000 older adults live in AL. To identify COVID-19 issues specific to AL, stakeholders with expertise in AL operations, policy, practice, and research (n = 42) were recruited to participate in remote interviews between July and September 2020. Using a thematic analysis, we derived the following overarching themes: (1) Policymakers are disconnected from and lack an understanding of the AL context; (2) AL administrators were left to coordinate, communicate, and implement constantly changing guidelines with little support; (3) AL organizations faced limited knowledge of and disparate access to funding and resources; (4) state-level regulatory requirements conflicted with COVID-19 guidelines resulting in uncertainty about which rules to follow; and (5) AL operators struggled to balance public health priorities with promoting their residents' quality of life and well-being. To develop evidence-informed policy and avoid unintended consequences, AL operators, direct care workers, residents, and clinicians practicing in these settings should have opportunities to provide feedback throughout the policy development process, both state and national.","Dys, Sarah; Winfree, Jaclyn; Carder, Paula; Zimmerman, Sheryl; Thomas, Kali S.",Front Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34095066/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.661042,33

667415,A generalized-growth model to characterize the early ascending phase of infectious disease outbreaks,2016-06-01,"The epicenter of the original outbreak in China has high male smoking rates of around 50%, and early reported death rates have an emphasis on older males, therefore the likelihood of smokers being overrepresented in fatalities is high. In Iran, China, Italy, and South Korea, female smoking rates are much lower than males. Fewer females have contracted the virus. If this analysis is correct, then Indonesia would be expected to begin experiencing high rates of Covid-19 because its male smoking rate is over 60% (Tobacco Atlas). Smokers are vulnerable to respiratory viruses. Smoking can upregulate angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor, the known receptor for both the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the human respiratory coronavirus NL638. This could also be true for new electronic smoking devices such as electronic cigarettes and “heat-not-burn” IQOS devices. ACE2 could be a novel adhesion molecule for SARS-CoV-2 causing Covid-19 and a potential therapeutic target for the prevention of fatal microbial infections, and therefore it should be fast tracked and prioritized for research and investigation.

The analysis plan was pre-registered (https://osf.io/n2k34/). Design Matched cohorts were assembled using a UK primary care registry (the CPRD-Aurum database). Patients were followed-up for up to 10 months, from 1st February 2020 to 9th December 2020. Setting Primary care database of 11,923,499 adults (>16 years). Participants From 232,780 adults with a positive COVID-19 test (after excluding those with <2 years historical data or <1 week follow-up), 86,922 without prior mental illness, 19,020 with anxiety or depression, 1,036 with psychosis, 4,152 with fatigue and 4,539 with sleep problems were matched to up to four controls based on gender, general practice and year of birth. A negative control used patients who tested negative for COVID-19 and patients negative for COVID with an influenza diagnosis. Main Outcomes and Measures Cox proportional hazard models estimated the association between a COVID-19 positive test and subsequent psychiatric morbidity (depression, anxiety, psychosis, or self-harm), sleep problems, fatigue or psychotropic prescribing. Models adjusted for comorbidities, ethnicity, smoking and BMI. Results After adjusting for observed confounders, there was an association between testing positive for COVID-19 and almost all markers of psychiatric morbidity, fatigue and sleep problems. The adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) for incident psychiatric morbidity was 1.75 (95% CI 1.56-1.96). However, there was a similar risk of incident psychiatric morbidity for those with a negative COVID-19 test (aHR 1.57, 95% CI 1.51-1.63) and a larger increase associated with influenza (aHR 2.97, 95% CI 1.36-6.48).

Methods We included consecutive patients who were admitted to Hackensack Meridian Health system hospitals with laboratory-confirmed diagnoses of COVID-19 at Hackensack University Medical Center by the CDI virus test between March 12, 2020, and April 8, 2020. Clinical data and viral testing results were collected and analyzed for characteristics associated with outcomes, as well as the correlation with viral load. Results A total of 722 patients were included in the study, with a median age of 63 (interquartile range (IQR), 51-75) and 272 (37.7%) females. Mortality of this case series was 25.8%, with a statistically significant linear increase observed from age 40 to [≥]80 by 10-year intervals. Viral load, as indicated by the cycle of threshold (Ct) values from the RT-PCR test, was significantly higher in the oldest patient group ([≥]80), and inversely correlated with survival.

This potential heavily relies on antibody levels showing acceptable agreement with gold standard virus neutralization tests. The aim of our study was to investigate diagnostic value of the available serological tests in terms of predicting virus neutralizing activity of serum samples drawn 5–7 weeks after onset of symptoms from 101 donors with a history of COVID-19. Immune responses against Receptor Binding Domain (RBD), Spike1 and 2 proteins and Nucleocapsid antigens were measured by various ELISA tests. Neutralizing antibody activity in serum samples was assessed by a cell-based virus neutralization test. Spearman correlation coefficients between serological and neutralization results ranged from 0.41 to 0.91 indicating moderate to strong correlation between ELISA test results and virus neutralization. The sensitivity and specificity of ELISA tests in the prediction of neutralization were 35–100% and 35–90% respectively. No clear cut off levels can be established that would reliably indicate neutralization activity. For some tests, however, a value below which the sample is not expected to neutralize can be established. Our data suggests that several of the ELISA kits tested may be suitable for epidemiological surveys 1–2 months after the infection, estimating whether a person may have recently exposed to the virus. Sensitivities considerably superseding specificity at the cut-off values proposed by the manufacturers suggest greater potential in the identification of insufficient antibody responses than in confirming protection.

670127,Immunoglobulin heavy chain diversity in Pteropid bats: evidence for a diverse and highly specific antigen binding repertoire,2010-02-17,"At least since March 2020, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic and the multi-organ coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are keeping a firm grip on the world. Although most cases are mild, older patients and those with co-morbidities are at increased risk of developing a cytokine storm, characterized by a systemic inflammatory response leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome and organ failure. The present paper focuses on the small molecule MP1032, describes its mode of action, and gives rationale why it is a promising option for the prevention/treatment of the SARS-CoV-2-induced cytokine storm. MP1032 is a phase-pure anhydrous polymorph of 5-amino-2,3-dihydro-1,4-phthalazinedione sodium salt that exhibits good stability and bioavailability. The physiological action of MP1032 is based on a multi-target mechanism including localized, self-limiting reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging activities that were demonstrated in a model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced joint inflammation. Furthermore, its immune-regulatory and PARP-1-modulating properties, coupled with antiviral effects against SARS-CoV-2, have been demonstrated in various cell models. Preclinical efficacy was elucidated in LPS-induced endotoxemia, a model with heightened innate immune responses that shares many similarities to COVID-19.

The purpose of this study was to explore the adequacy of the 360-degree video (video 360) technology in EM education in the context of: (a) students' attitudes towards the video 360; (b) students' academic performance in their required examination at the end of the EM course compared to the assessment results of students from the previous academic year. METHODS: A mixed-method research project enrolled the fourth-year medical students who attended the required EM course during the first semester of the academic year 2020–2021 when all activities with undergraduate students went online and teaching scenarios recorded in the video 360 format were employed. Data collection was two-fold: (a) anonymous questionnaires, complemented with basic YouTube analytics; (b) multiple-choice questionnaires (MCQ) and oral examination, contrasting the results with those in 2019–2020. Data analysis used descriptive statistics and non-parametric methods. RESULTS: Seventy-nine students (53 females and 26 males) participated in the project and all completed the EM course. Students' interest in and their acceptance of the video 360 technology were high (total scoring in the upper 20% of the respective scales), with consistently good performance in two parallel, independent, interview-based oral/practical evaluations (Spearman correlation coefficient R = 0.665, p < .001). The majority scored over 90% in the summative MCQ, with higher values compared to their colleagues’ during the previous academic year (with on-site teaching): scoring percentages with mean ± standard deviation of 92.52 ± 4.57 and 76.67 ± 18.77, respectively. CONCLUSION: Our project showed that the video 360 scenarios were effective in teaching EM. In the long term, employing this accessible and inexpensive educational approach would add value to on-site training by enriching the exposure to a specific ED environment. KEY MESSAGES: Medical students valued the 360-degree video scenarios as contributing substantially to their EM knowledge and preparedness. Examination results confirmed the 360-degree video scenarios as viable in EM teaching. The 360-degree video technology would be a sustainable solution for hybrid medical teaching in the long term.","Petrica, Alina; Lungeanu, Diana; Ciuta, Alexandru; Marza, Adina M.; Botea, Mihai-Octavian; Mederle, Ovidiu A.",Annals of medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34612105/; https://doi.org/10.1080/07853890.2021.1970219,33

We sought to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 in the overall screening for acute stroke utilizing a commercial clinical artificial intelligence platform. METHODS: Data were derived from the Viz Platform, an artificial intelligence application designed to optimize the workflow of patients with acute stroke. Neuroimaging data on suspected patients with stroke across 97 hospitals in 20 US states were collected in real time and retrospectively analyzed with the number of patients undergoing imaging screening serving as a surrogate for the amount of stroke care. The main outcome measures were the number of computed tomography (CT) angiography, CT perfusion, large vessel occlusions (defined according to the automated software detection), and severe strokes on CT perfusion (defined as those with hypoperfusion volumes >70 mL) normalized as number of patients per day per hospital. Data from the prepandemic (November 4, 2019 to February 29, 2020) and pandemic (March 1 to May 10, 2020) periods were compared at national and state levels. Correlations were made between the inter-period changes in imaging screening, stroke hospitalizations, and thrombectomy procedures using state-specific sampling. RESULTS: A total of 23 223 patients were included. The incidence of large vessel occlusion on CT angiography and severe strokes on CT perfusion were 11.2% (n=2602) and 14.7% (n=1229/8328), respectively. There were significant declines in the overall number of CT angiographies (−22.8%; 1.39–1.07 patients/day per hospital, P<0.001) and CT perfusion (−26.1%; 0.50–0.37 patients/day per hospital, P<0.001) as well as in the incidence of large vessel occlusion (−17.1%; 0.15–0.13 patients/day per hospital, P<0.001) and severe strokes on CT perfusion (−16.7%; 0.12–0.10 patients/day per hospital, P<0.005). The sampled cohort showed similar declines in the rates of large vessel occlusions versus thrombectomy (18.8% versus 19.5%, P=0.9) and comprehensive stroke center hospitalizations (18.8% versus 11.0%, P=0.4). CONCLUSIONS: A significant decline in stroke imaging screening has occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic. This analysis underscores the broader application of artificial intelligence neuroimaging platforms for the real-time monitoring of stroke systems of care.","Nogueira, Raul G.; Davies, Jason M.; Gupta, Rishi; Hassan, Ameer E.; Devlin, Thomas; Haussen, Diogo C.; Mohammaden, Mahmoud H.; Kellner, Christopher P.; Arthur, Adam; Elijovich, Lucas; Owada, Kumiko; Begun, Dina; Narayan, Mukund; Mordenfeld, Nadia; Tekle, Wondwossen G.; Nahab, Fadi; Jovin, Tudor G.; Frei, Don; Siddiqui, Adnan H.; Frankel, Michael R.; Mocco, J",Stroke,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33657851/; https://doi.org/10.1161/strokeaha.120.031960,33

670969,Infection kinetics of Covid-19 and containment strategy,2021-06-02,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can infect animals, however, the whole range of potential hosts is still unknown. This work makes an assessment of wildlife susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 by analyzing the similarities of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) and Transmembrane Protease, Serine 2 (TMPRSS2) —both recognized as receptors and protease for coronavirus spike protein— and the genetic variation of the viral protein spike in the recognition sites. The sequences from different mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians, and the sequence from SARS-CoV-2 S protein were obtained from the GenBank. Comparisons of aligned sequences were made by selecting amino acids residues of ACE2, TMPRSS2 and S protein; phylogenetic trees were reconstructed using the same sequences. The species susceptibility was ranked by substituting the values of amino acid residues for both proteins. Our results ranked primates at the top, but surprisingly, just below are carnivores, cetaceans and wild rodents, showing a relatively high potential risk, as opposed to lab rodents that are typically mammals at lower risk. Most of the sequences from birds, reptiles and amphibians occupied the lowest ranges in the analyses. Models and phylogenetic trees outputs showed the species that are more prone to getting infected with SARS-CoV-2. Interestingly, during this short pandemic period, a high haplotypic variation was observed in the RBD of the viral S protein, suggesting new risks for other hosts. Our findings are consistent with other published results reporting laboratory and natural infections in different species. Finally, urgent measures of wildlife monitoring are needed regarding SARS-CoV-2, as well as measures for avoiding or limiting human contact with wildlife, and precautionary measures to protect wildlife workers and researchers; monitoring disposal of waste and sewage than can potentially affect the environment, and designing protocols for dealing with the outbreak.","Martínez-Hernández, Fernando; Isaak-Delgado, Ana Belem; Alfonso-Toledo, Jorge Alberto; Muñoz-García, Claudia Irais; Villalobos, Guiehdani; Aréchiga-Ceballos, Nidia; Rendón-Franco, Emilio",Perspect Ecol Conserv,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2530064420300596?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pecon.2020.09.008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33043253/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2530064420300596,33
671311,Early warning signals of infectious disease transitions: a review,2021-09-29,"BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, measures to prevent microorganism transmission were implemented across hospitals, including wearing compulsory surgical masks, minimising non-urgent procedures and restricting visitors. Previously, concerns have been raised that MRO-associated deaths could rise during a future pandemic through superimposed bacterial infections, inappropriate antibiotic use and reduced focus on preventing MRO infections. METHODS: In the state of Queensland, Australia with a population of 5 million, only a short first wave of coronavirus cases occurred and restrictions were quickly scaled back. This presented a natural experiment of pre-, during and post-COVID-19 restriction timings to evaluate the effectiveness of heightened prevention measures on multidrug resistant organism (MRO) infections. Patient isolation days and MRO types were collected weekly from routine infection control reports, at a large public hospital, from 28(th) January 2020 to 24(th) July 2020. In this interrupted time series design, we employed Poisson mixed effect regression modelling to evaluate the difference in incidence of patient isolation days between time periods. RESULTS: Compared to pre-COVID, patient isolation days reduced during COVID restrictions (incidence rate ratio 0.65, 95%CI: 0.59, 0.70; p<0.001) and increased again post-COVID restrictions, but did not return to pre-COVID levels (0.87, 95%CI: 0.80, 0.95; p=0.001). The efficiency of isolating patients improved after COVID-19 with fewer bed closures required. CONCLUSION: Heightened infection control awareness, hand sanitation and mask wearing after COVID-19 restrictions were lifted appear to effectively prevent common hospital-acquired MRO infections.","Elliott, Thomas M.; Hurst, Cameron; Doidge, Michelle; Hurst, Trish; Harris, Patrick NA.; Gordon, Louisa G.",Infect Dis Health,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.idh.2021.08.001; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2468045121000432; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468045121000432?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34507923/,33

In many cases, these differences in behaviour relate to pre‐existing group identities. However, in times of rapid societal change, novel opinion‐based groups can emerge and provide a new basis for partisan identification and divergent collective behaviour. Here, we use network methods to map the emergence of opposing opinion‐based groups and assess their implications for public health behaviour. In a longitudinal study, we tracked public health attitudes and self‐reported behaviour in a sample of UK participants over four time points. Network visualisation reveal a rift in attitudinal alignment over time and the genesis of two distinct groups characterised by trust, or distrust, in science (Study 1a; N = 253). These groups also diverge in public health behaviour. In a brief follow‐up study (N = 206), we find that this opinion polarization partially reflects underlying societal divides. We discuss implications for opinion‐based group research and public health campaigns.","Maher, Paul J.; MacCarron, Pádraig; Quayle, Michael",Br J Soc Psychol,https://doi.org/10.1111/bjso.12396; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32621294/,33

We examined (1) the association between unemployment, occurring upon the coronavirus outbreak, and psychological distress among Israeli young people (20–35-years-old); (2) the associations between various psychological resources/risk factors and psychological distress; and (3) whether these resources and risk factors were moderators in the unemployment-psychological distress link. A real-time survey based on snowball sampling was conducted during the month of April 2020 (N = 390). We employed hierarchical linear models to explore associations between unemployment, psychological resources, risk factors, and psychological distress. Unemployment was independently associated with greater psychological distress. Perceived trust, optimism, and sense of mastery decreased psychological distress, whereas financial strain and loneliness during the crisis increased this distress. The effect of unemployment on psychological distress did not depend on participants’ resource and risk factor levels. Policymakers must develop and extend health initiatives aimed at alleviating the mental health consequences of COVID-19-related unemployment and promote labor market interventions to help young job seekers integrate into employment. These measures, which are in line with the UN sustainable development goals, should be seen as an important route to promote public health.","Achdut, Netta; Refaeli, Tehila",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33007892/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17197163,33

674233,Sexual dimorphism and plasticity in wing shape in three Diptera,2021-02-19,"INTRODUCTION: The SARS-CoV-2 virus (COVID19) pandemic has placed extreme pressures on the Canadian Healthcare system. Many health care regions in Canada have cancelled or limited surgical and non-surgical interventions on patients to preserve healthcare resources for a predicted increase in COVID19 related hospital admissions. Also reduced health interventions may limit the risk of possible transmission of COVID19 to other patients and health care workers during this pandemic. The majority of institutions in Canada have developed their own operational mandates regarding access to surgical resources for patients suffering from Head and Neck Cancers during this pandemic. There is a large degree of individual practitioner judgement in deciding access to care as well as resource allocation during these challenging times. The Canadian Association of Head and Neck Surgical Oncology (CAHNSO) convened a task force to develop a set of guidelines based on the best current available evidence to help Head and Neck Surgical Oncologists and all practitioners involved in the care of these patients to help guide individual practice decisions. MAIN BODY: The majority of head and neck surgical oncology from initial diagnosis and work up to surgical treatment and then follow-up involves aerosol generating medical procedures (AGMPs) which inherently put head and neck surgeons and practitioners at high risk for transmission of COVID19. The aggressive nature of the majority of head and neck cancer negates the ability for deferring surgical treatment for a prolonged period of time. The included guidelines provide recommendations for resource allocation for patients, use of personal protective equipment for practitioners as well as recommendations for modification of practice during the current pandemic. CONCLUSION: 1. Enhanced triaging should be used to identify patients with aggressive malignancies. These patients should be prioritized to reduce risk of significant disease progression in the reduced resource environment of COVID19 era. 2. Enhanced triaging including aggressive pre-treatment COVID19 testing should be used to identify patients with high risk of COVID19 transmission. 3. Enhanced personal protective equipment (PPE) including N95 masks and full eye protection should be used for any AGMPs performed even in asymptomatic patients. 4. Enhanced PPE including full eye protection, N95 masks and/or powered air purifying respirators (PAPRs) should be used for any AGMPs in symptomatic or presumptive positive COVID 19 patients.","O’Connell, Daniel A.; Seikaly, Hadi; Isaac, Andre; Pyne, Justin; Hart, Robert D.; Goldstein, David; Yoo, John",J Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40463-020-00448-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32727583/,33

METHODS A prospective, observational, multicentre cohort study in Catalonia, Spain. Recruitment was consecutive from mid-March to mid-May 2020. Patients had an acute ischemic stroke within 48 hours and a previous modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 0 to 3. We collected demographic data, vascular risk factors, prior mRS score, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, rate of reperfusion therapies, logistics, and metrics. Primary end point was functional outcome at 3 months. Favourable outcome was defined depending on the previous mRS score. Secondary outcome was mortality at 3 months. We performed mRS shift and multivariable analyses. RESULTS We evaluated 701 patients (mean age 72.3±13.3 years, 60.5% men) and 91 (13%) had COVID-19 infection. Median baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was higher in patients with COVID-19 compared with patients without COVID-19 (8 [3-18] versus 6 [2-14], P=0.049). Proportion of patients with a favourable functional outcome was 33.7% in the COVID-19 and 47% in the non-COVID-19 group. However, after a multivariable logistic regression analysis, COVID-19 infection did not increase the probability of unfavourable functional outcome. Mortality rate was 39.3% among patients with COVID-19 and 16.1% in the non-COVID-19 group. In the multivariable logistic regression analysis, COVID-19 infection was a risk factor for mortality (hazard ratio, 3.14 [95% CI, 2.10-4.71]; P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS Patients with ischemic stroke and COVID-19 infection have more severe strokes and a higher mortality than patients with stroke without COVID-19 infection. However, functional outcome is comparable in both groups.","Martí-Fàbregas, Joan; Guisado-Alonso, Daniel; Delgado-Mederos, Raquel; Martínez-Domeño, Alejandro; Prats-Sánchez, Luis; Guasch-Jiménez, Marina; Cardona, Pere; Núñez-Guillén, Ana; Requena, Manuel; Rubiera, Marta; Olivé, Marta; Bustamante, Alejandro; Gomis, Meritxell; Amaro, Sergio; Llull, Laura; Ustrell, Xavier; Castilho de Oliveira, Gislaine; Seró, Laia; Gomez-Choco, Manuel; Mena, Luis; Serena, Joaquín; Bashir Viturro, Saima; Purroy, Francisco; Vicente, Mikel; Rodríguez-Campello, Ana; Ois, Angel; Catena, Esther; Carmen Garcia-Carreira, Maria; Barrachina, Oriol; Palomeras, Ernest; Krupinski, Jerzky; Almeria, Marta; Zaragoza, Josep; Esteve, Patricia; Cocho, Dolores; Moreira, Antia; van Eendenburg, Cecile; Emilio Codas, Javier; Pérez de la Ossa, Natalia; Salvat, Mercè; Camps-Renom, Pol",Stroke,https://doi.org/10.1161/strokeaha.121.034883; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34455823/,33

We aimed to report a case of AMN and underlying disease of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). CASE PRESENTATION: A thirty-five-year-old female patient with bone marrow biopsy confirmed AML, and bicytopenia, under chemotherapy, complained of sudden paracentral visual field defect in her right eye was referred. Visual acuity was 20/20 in both eyes. Posterior segment evaluation revealed multiple Roth’s spots. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) demonstrated hyper-reflectivity band, in the outer nuclear layer and outer plexiform layer, nasal to the fovea of the right eye, and hyperreflective patch in outer retina segmentation en-face OCT, suggestive of the diagnosis of AMN. Nine days after AMN diagnosis, dyspnea, malaise, and cough was initiated. Ground glass opacities in lung CT scan, beside reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2, was conclusive of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The patient deceased after 6 days. CONCLUSION: We report a rare case of AMN following AML. Our findings support the role of ischemia in the outer retina, of which AML may contributed to the pathophysiological process. The patient has deceased less than 2 weeks from AMN initiation.","Zamani, Ghodsieh; Ataei Azimi;, Sajjad; Aminizadeh, Ali; Shams Abadi, Elham; Kamandi, Mostafa; Mortazi, Hasan; Shariat, Somayeh; Abrishami, Mojtaba",J Ophthalmic Inflamm Infect,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33415590/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12348-020-00231-1,33

This study aims to identify issues in patient flow on mental health units and align them with potential AI solutions, ultimately devising a model for their integration at service level. METHOD: Following a narrative literature review and pilot interview, 20 semi-structured interviews were conducted with AI and mental health experts. Thematic analysis was then used to analyse and synthesise gathered data and construct an enhanced model. RESULTS: Predictive variables for length-of-stay and readmission rate are not consistent in the literature. There are, however, common themes in patient flow issues. An analysis identified several potential areas for AI-enhanced patient flow. Firstly, AI could improve patient flow by streamlining administrative tasks and optimising allocation of resources. Secondly, real-time data analytics systems could support clinician decision-making in triage, discharge, diagnosis and treatment stages. Finally, longer-term, development of solutions such as digital phenotyping could help transform mental health care to a more preventative, personalised model. CONCLUSIONS: Recommendations were formulated for NHS trusts open to adopting AI patient flow enhancements. Although AI offers many promising use-cases, greater collaborative investment and infrastructure are needed to deliver clinically validated improvements. Concerns around data-use, regulation and transparency remain, and hospitals must continue to balance guidelines with stakeholder priorities.

METHODS: We used a microsimulation to estimate the 10-year impact of COVID-19 disruptions in healthcare delivery on HCV outcomes including identified infections, linkage to care, treatment initiation and completion, cirrhosis, and liver-related death. We modeled hypothetical scenarios consisting of an 18-month pandemic-related disruption in HCV care starting in March 2020 followed by varying returns to pre-pandemic rates of screening, linkage, and treatment through March 2030 and compared them to a counterfactual scenario in which there was no COVID-19 pandemic or disruptions in care. We also performed alternate scenario analyses in which the pandemic disruption lasted for 12- and 24-months. RESULTS: Compared to the 'no pandemic' scenario, in the scenario in which there is no return to pre-pandemic levels of HCV care delivery, we estimate 1,060 fewer identified cases, 21 additional cases of cirrhosis, and 16 additional liver-related deaths per 100,000 people. Only 3% of identified cases initiate treatment and <1% achieve sustained virologic response (SVR). Compared to 'no pandemic', the best-case scenario in which an 18-month care disruption is followed by a return to pre-pandemic levels, we estimated a smaller proportion of infections identified and achieving SVR. CONCLUSIONS: A recommitment to the HCV epidemic in the U.S. that involves additional resources coupled with aggressive efforts to screen, link, and treat people with HCV is needed to overcome the COVID-19-related disruptions.","Barocas, Joshua A; Savinkina, Alexandra; Lodi, Sara; Epstein, Rachel L; Bouton, Tara C; Sperring, Heather; Hsu, Heather E; Jacobson, Karen R; Schechter-Perkins, Elissa M; Linas, Benjamin P; White, Laura F",Clin. infect. dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34499124/; https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciab779,33

Patients with mild symptoms have been advised for home treatment since most of the hospitals are running out of bed. In this situation delivering healthcare to people has become revolutionizing due to the rapid advancement of embedded systems, communication, and informatics technologies. Integration of different health sensors, handheld devices, and internet can be a great potential for significant improvement of the quality of remote healthcare. This paper discusses the use of MySignals HW shield which is a hardware development platform for medical devices to build e-health monitoring system. Wearable health monitoring system prototype has been developed in this work. To conduct experiments, health vitals such as body temperature, ECG, oxygen saturation level, and pulse rate from 5 volunteers have been measured, collected, and stored in a cloud database using the system prototype. To evaluate the performance of the prototype, transmission delay has been recorded in both wired (Ethernet) and wireless (Wi-Fi) communication modes. It is observed that it takes 2.71 ms and 5.18 ms of time to collect and store the health vitals to the cloud database in wired and wireless mode respectively. Comparing the collected health vitals with the normal range of health vitals, no abnormality is found in all volunteer's health.

Central to this approach was a DNA microarray designed to detect a wide range of known viruses as well as novel members of existing viral families; this microarray contained the most highly conserved 70mer sequences from every fully sequenced reference viral genome in GenBank. During an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in March 2003, hybridization to this microarray revealed the presence of a previously uncharacterized coronavirus in a viral isolate cultivated from a SARS patient. To further characterize this new virus, approximately 1 kb of the unknown virus genome was cloned by physically recovering viral sequences hybridized to individual array elements. Sequencing of these fragments confirmed that the virus was indeed a new member of the coronavirus family. This combination of array hybridization followed by direct viral sequence recovery should prove to be a general strategy for the rapid identification and characterization of novel viruses and emerging infectious disease.","Wang, David; Urisman, Anatoly; Liu, Yu-Tsueng; Springer, Michael; Ksiazek, Thomas G; Erdman, Dean D; Mardis, Elaine R; Hickenbotham, Matthew; Magrini, Vincent; Eldred, James; Latreille, J.

We conducted a multi-center evaluation of kidney biopsy findings in living patients to identify various kidney disease pathology in patients with COVID-19 and their association with SARS-CoV-2 infection. STUDY DESIGN: Case series. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: We identified 14 native and 3 transplant kidney biopsies performed for-cause in patients with documented recent or concurrent COVID-19 infection treated at 7 large hospital systems in the United States. OBSERVATIONS: Males and females were equally represented in our study cohort, with a higher proportion of Black (n=8) and Hispanic (n=5) patients. All 17 patients had RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 infection, but only 3 presented with severe COVID-19 symptoms. Acute kidney injury (AKI; n=15) and proteinuria (n=11) were the most common indications for biopsy and these symptoms developed concurrently or within 1 week of COVID-19 symptoms in all patients. Acute tubular injury (n=14), collapsing glomerulopathy (n=7) and endothelial injury/thrombotic microangiopathy (n=6) were the most common histologic findings. Two of the three transplant patients developed active antibody-mediated rejection weeks after COVID-19 infection. Eight patients required dialysis, but others improved with conservative management. LIMITATIONS: Small study size and short clinical follow up. CONCLUSIONS: Cases of even symptomatically mild COVID-19 infection were accompanied by AKI and/or heavy proteinuria that prompted a diagnostic kidney biopsy. While acute tubular injury was seen among the majority of them, uncommon pathology such as collapsing glomerulopathy and acute endothelial injury were detected, and most of these patients progressed to irreversible kidney injury and dialysis.","Akilesh, Shreeram; Nast, Cynthia C.; Yamashita, Michifumi; Henriksen, Kammi; Charu, Vivek; Troxell, Megan L.; Kambham, Neeraja; Bracamonte, Erika; Houghton, Donald; Ahmed, Naila I.; Chong, Chyi Chyi; Thajudeen, Bijin; Rehman, Shehzad; Khoury, Firas; Zuckerman, Jonathan E.; Gitomer, Jeremy; Raguram, Parthassarathy C.; Mujeeb, Shanza; Schwarze, Ulrike; Shannon, M.

We purge the monthly log level series from the systematic component to extract unexpected changes or shocks to log short-time workers. These monthly shocks are included in a univariate model for quarterly GDP growth to capture timely, current-quarter unexpected changes in growth dynamics. Included shocks additionally explain 24% in GDP growth variation. The model is able to forecast quite precisely the decrease in GDP during the financial crisis. It predicts a mean decline in GDP of 5.7% over the next two quarters. Without additional growth stimulus, the GDP level forecast remains persistently 4% lower in the long run. The uncertainty is large, as the 95% highest forecast density interval includes a decrease in GDP as large as 9%. A recovery to pre-crisis GDP level in 2021 lies only in the upper tail of the 95% highest forecast density interval.","Kaufmann, Sylvia",Swiss J Econ Stat,https://doi.org/10.1186/s41937-020-00053-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32934939/,33

683623,Factors related with COVID-19 vaccination willingness among outpatients in China,2021,"Since the emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, China, the number of globally confirmed cases according to World Health Organization statistics reached 292 124 in 189 countries by 22 March 2020. The number of deaths reached 12 784, with estimated case-fatality rates ranging from 0.5% to 5.7%. Children population seems to be the least affected by the disease, while the highest rate of death is among the elderly and people with comorbidities. Most infected individuals are asymptomatic or only exhibit mild symptoms. After the incubation period, the most common symptoms are fever, cough and fatigue. Asymptomatic carrier state is of paramount importance because of carriers' ability to spread the infection and to shed the virus into the air and surroundings. Although much is still unknown about SARS-CoV-2, the scientific research is moving at an unprecedented pace towards understanding the nature, effective control, prevention and treatment of SARS-CoV-2. Various reports have suggested an in vivo evolution of the virus, which may explain the rapid spread and changing epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2, but further evidence is needed. Unfortunately, no effective treatment or therapeutic drug is available for the disease; only supportive treatment and classical intervention measures are available for confronting the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","Abduljalil, J.M.; Abduljalil, B.M.",New Microbes New Infect,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S205229752030024X?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S205229752030024X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nmni.2020.100672; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32322400/,33

685209,The Anomalous Mei-yu Rainfall of Summer 2020 from a Circulation Clustering Perspective: Current and Possible Future Prevalence,2021-08-31,"Chest X-ray (CXR) imaging is one of the most feasible diagnosis modalities for early detection of the infection of COVID-19 viruses, which is classified as a pandemic according to the World Health Organization (WHO) report in December 2019. COVID-19 is a rapid natural mutual virus that belongs to the coronavirus family. CXR scans are one of the vital tools to early detect COVID-19 to monitor further and control its virus spread. Classification of COVID-19 aims to detect whether a subject is infected or not. In this article, a model is proposed for analyzing and evaluating grayscale CXR images called Chest X-Ray COVID Network (CXRVN) based on three different COVID-19 X-Ray datasets. The proposed CXRVN model is a lightweight architecture that depends on a single fully connected layer representing the essential features and thus reducing the total memory usage and processing time verse pre-trained models and others. The CXRVN adopts two optimizers: mini-batch gradient descent and Adam optimizer, and the model has almost the same performance. Besides, CXRVN accepts CXR images in grayscale that are a perfect image representation for CXR and consume less memory storage and processing time. Hence, CXRVN can analyze the CXR image with high accuracy in a few milliseconds. The consequences of the learning process focus on decision making using a scoring function called SoftMax that leads to high rate true-positive classification. The CXRVN model is trained using three different datasets and compared to the pre-trained models: GoogleNet, ResNet and AlexNet, using the fine-tuning and transfer learning technologies for the evaluation process. To verify the effectiveness of the CXRVN model, it was evaluated in terms of the well-known performance measures such as precision, sensitivity, F1-score and accuracy. The evaluation results based on sensitivity, precision, recall, accuracy, and F1 score demonstrated that, after GAN augmentation, the accuracy reached 96.7% in experiment 2 (Dataset-2) for two classes and 93.07% in experiment-3 (Dataset-3) for three classes, while the average accuracy of the proposed CXRVN model is 94.5%.","Elzeki, Omar M.; Shams, Mahmoud; Sarhan, Shahenda; Abd Elfattah, Mohamed; Hassanien, Aboul Ella",PeerJ Comput Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33817008/; https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj-cs.358,33

METHOD: In-person qualitative interviews informed by an adaptation of Karasek's Job Demand-control model were conducted with a convenience sample of healthcare workforce from March to April 2020. RESULTS: Themes emerging from interviews coalesced around three main areas: fear of uncertainty, physical and psychological manifestations of stress, and resilience building. Shifting information, a lack of PPE, and fear of infecting others prompted worry for those working with Covid-infected patients. Participants reported that stress manifested more psychologically than physically. Individualized stress mitigation efforts, social media and organizational transparency were reported by healthcare workers to be effective against rising stressors. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 has presented healthcare workforce with unprecedented challenges in their work environment. With attention to understanding stressors and supporting clinicians during healthcare emergencies, more research is necessary in order to effectively promote healthcare workforce well-being.","Norful, Allison A.; Rosenfeld, Adam; Schroeder, Krista; Travers, Jasmine L.; Aliyu, Sainfer",Gen Hosp Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.genhosppsych.2021.01.001; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163834321000013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33485091/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0163834321000013,33

Greece authorizes and regulates communicable disease control commensurate with public health risks, and integrates the principles of equality, objectivity, and respect for human rights. Despite strength at the level of principles, Greek law lacks coherence, clarity, and systematization. An inadequate body of regulations means legislation falls short of adequate implementing authority and guidelines; public health authorities often cannot find or understand the laws, nor are they certain about allocation of jurisdictional authority.

We describe a case of a patient who developed pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum in the setting of COVID-19 without having ARDS or requiring mechanical ventilation. Our patient developed sudden onset of shortness of breath and desaturation. Chest X-ray and CT chest revealed pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum. Though pneumothorax in pulmonary infection is most likely associated with increased airway pressure in acute respiratory distress syndrome and positive pressure mechanical ventilation. Pneumothorax is a life-threatening complication and if diagnosed early it can reduce mortality. In patients with COVID-19 infection, sudden clinical worsening with shortness of breath and desaturation should prompt the clinician to look for potentially treatable causes such as pneumothorax.","Sonia, FNU; Kumar, Mukesh",Cureus,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32983734/; https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.10044,33

Additionally, various proteins of SARS-CoV-2 for finding a potent inhibitor have also been highlighted. To mitigate this deadly virus, an understanding of atomic level information, pathogenicity mechanisms and functions of different proteins in causing the infection is imperative.

The complex origin, extended human-to-human transmission, pathogenesis, host immune responses, and various clinical presentations of SARS-CoV-2 have presented serious challenges in understanding and combating the pandemic situation. Human CoVs gained attention only after the SARS-CoV outbreak of 2002–2003. On the other hand, animal CoVs have been studied extensively for many decades, providing a plethora of important information on their genetic diversity, transmission, tissue tropism and pathology, host immunity, and therapeutic and prophylactic strategies, some of which have striking resemblance to those seen with SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, the evolution of human CoVs, including SARS-CoV-2, is intermingled with those of animal CoVs. In this comprehensive review, attempts have been made to compare the current knowledge on evolution, transmission, pathogenesis, immunopathology, therapeutics, and prophylaxis of SARS-CoV-2 with those of various animal CoVs. Information on animal CoVs might enhance our understanding of SARS-CoV-2, and accordingly, benefit the development of effective control and prevention strategies against COVID-19.","Ghosh, Souvik; Malik, Yashpal S.",Microorganisms,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33238451/; https://doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms8111840,33
