7305,Describing dengue epidemics: Insights from simple mechanistic models,2012-09-26,"We design, analyze and implement nonstandard finite difference (NSFD) schemes for some differential models in biosciences. The NSFD schemes are reliable in three directions. They are topologically dynamically consistent for onedimensional models. They can replicate the global asymptotic stability of the disease-free equilibrium of the MSEIR model in epidemiology whenever the basic reproduction number is less than 1. They preserve the positivity and boundedness property of solutions of advection-reaction and reaction-diffusion equations.","Anguelov, R.; Dumont, Y.; Lubuma, J.
