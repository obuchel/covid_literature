The NSFD schemes are reliable in three directions. They are topologically dynamically consistent for onedimensional models. They can replicate the global asymptotic stability of the disease-free equilibrium of the MSEIR model in epidemiology whenever the basic reproduction number is less than 1. They preserve the positivity and boundedness property of solutions of advection-reaction and reaction-diffusion equations.","Anguelov, R.; Dumont, Y.; Lubuma, J. M.-S.",AIP Conf Proc,535,1
