4489,Development of the WHO-INTEGRATE evidence-to-decision framework: an overview of systematic reviews of decision criteria for health decision-making,2020-02-11,"BACKGROUND: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the major health and socioeconomic problems in the world. Immune-enhancing enteral formula has been proven to significantly reduce infection rate in TBI patients. One of the ingredients that can be used in immunonutrition formulas to reduce inflammation and oxidative stress is pycnogenol. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this work is to survey the effect of pycnogenol on the clinical, nutritional, and inflammatory status of TBI patients. METHODS: This is a double-blind, randomized controlled trial. Block randomization will be used. An intervention group will receive pycnogenol supplementation of 150 mg for 10 days and a control group will receive a placebo for the same duration. Inflammatory status (IL-6, IL- 1β, C-reactive protein) and oxidative stress status (malondialdehyde, total antioxidant capacity), at the baseline, at the 5th day, and at the end of the study (10th day) will be measured. Clinical and nutritional status will be assessed three times during the intervention. The Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) questionnaire for assessment of organ failure will be filled out every other day. The mortality rate will be calculated within 28 days of the start of the intervention. Weight, body mass index, and body composition will be measured. All analyses will be conducted by an initially assigned study arm in an intention-to-treat analysis. DISCUSSION: We expect that supplementation of 150 mg pycnogenol for 10 days will improve clinical and nutritional status and reduce the inflammation and oxidative stress of the TBI patients. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial is registered at clinicaltrials.gov (ref: NCT03777683) at 12/13/2018.","Malekahmadi, Mahsa; Moradi Moghaddam, Omid; Islam, Sheikh Mohammed Shariful; Tanha, Kiarash; Nematy, Mohsen; Pahlavani, Naseh; Firouzi, Safieh; Zali, Mohammad Reza; Norouzy, Abdolreza",Trials,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7014642/,360
5165,Biowarfare as a biopolitical icon,2005-08-12,"A number of widely repeated and factually incorrect myths have pervaded the AIDS research literature, misdirecting research and treatment. Five of the most outstanding are: 1) that all risk groups develop AIDS at the same rate following HIV infection; 2) that there are no true seroreversions following HIV infection; 3) that antibody is protective against HIV infection; 4) that the only way to treat AIDS effectively is through retroviral therapies; and 5) that since HIV is so highly correlated with AIDS incidence, it must be the sole necessary and sufficient cause of AIDS. A huge body of research, reviewed in this paper, demonstrates the falsity of these myths. 1) The average number of years between HIV infection and AIDS is greater than 20 years for mild hemophiliacs, 14 years for transfussion severe hemophiliacs, 10 years for old severe hemophiliacs, 10 years for homosexual men, 6 years for transfusion patients of all ages, 2 years for transplant patients, and 6 months for perinatally infected infants. These differences can only be explained in terms of risk-group associated cofactors. 2) Seroreversions are common. Between 10 and 20 percent of HIV-seronegative people in high risk groups have T-cell immunity to HIV, and may have had one or more verified positive HIV antibody tests in the past. 3) Antibody, far from being protective against HIV, appears to be highly diagnostic of loss of immune regulation of HIV, and some evidence of antibody-enhancement of infection exists. 4) Non-retroviral treatments of HIV infection, including safer sex practices, elimination of drug use, high nutrient diets, and limited reexposure to HIV and its cofactors have proven to be effective means of preventing or delaying onset of AIDS. 5) Many immunosuppressive factors, including drug use, multiple concurrent infections, and exposure to alloantigens, are as highly correlated with AIDS risk groups as HIV. These data are more consistent with AIDS being a multifactorial or synergistic disease than a monofactorial one.","Root-Bernstein, Robert S.",Genetica,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7087958/,360
5305,Global stressors and the global decline of amphibians: tipping the stress immunocompetency axis,2010-03-24,"Three lines of observation demonstrate the role of arthropods in transmission and evolution of viruses. a) Recent outbreaks of viruses from their niches took place and insects have played a major role in propagating the viruses. b) Examination of the list of viral families and their hosts shows that many infect invertebrates (I) and vertebrates (V) or (I) and plants (P) or all kingdoms (VIPs). This notion holds true irrespective of the genome type. At first glance the argument seems to be weak in the case of enveloped and non-enveloped RNA viruses with single-stranded (ss) segmented or non-segmented genomes of positive (+) or negative polarity. Here, there are several families infecting V or P only; no systematic relation to arthropods is found. c) In the non-enveloped plant viruses with ss RNA genomes there is a strong tendency for segmentation and individual packaging of the genome pieces. This is in contrast to ss+ RNA animal viruses and can only be explained by massive transmission by seed or insects or both, because individual packaging necessitates a multihit infection. Comparisons demonstrate relationships in the nonstructural proteins of double-stranded and ss+ RNA viruses irrespective of host range, segmentation, and envelope. Similar conclusions apply for the negative-stranded RNA viruses. Thus, viral supergroups can be created that infect V or P and exploit arthropods for infection or transmission or both. Examples of such relationships and explanations for viral evolution are reviewed and the arthropod orders important for cell culture are given.","Koblet, Hans",In Vitro Cell Dev Biol Anim,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7088601/,360

7471,The Finnish Pension System and Its Future Challenges,2020-04-01,"Chronic food restriction (FR) leads to adaptive cellular changes, some of which retard aging. Moreover, some of these changes occur within weeks after onset of FR. Because neuroendocrine mechanisms may mediate these effects, we measured the effect of FR on the messenger ribonucleicacids (mRNAs) encoding all of the tropic hormones of the anterior pituitary (AP). Slot blot and solution hybridization were conducted on AP ribonucleicacid (RNA) samples obtained at 0500 h (AM) and 1500 h (PM) from 3-month-old male Fischer 344 rats fed ad libitum (AL) or FR (60% of AL calories) since 6 weeks of age. Poly A RNA/μg total RNA was similar in AL and FR rats, indicating that there was no overall effect of FR on mRNA levels. The level of proopiomelanocortin (POMC) mRNA was not reduced by FR when expressed per fig of RNA or as total AP content. By contrast, the total AP content of the mRNAs encoding LHβ, FSHβ TSHβ, GH, and PRL was markedly reduced by FR. When expressed per fig of RNA, however, only GH (AM and PM), FSHβ (AM), TSHbeta; (PM), and PRL (PM) were reduced by FR. These results reveal that FR differentially affects pituitary tropic hormone mRNA levels within weeks after onset of FR, and are consistent with a role for neuroendocrine alterations in the initiation of adaptive cellular responses to FR.","Han, Eun-Soo; Lu, Deedee H.; Nelson, James F.",J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7110300/,360
7737,Nurse Participation in Continuing Education in Disaster Nursing in Taiwan,2017-03-28,"The Yankees are rapidly finding out the benefits of the telephone. A newly made grandmamma, we are told, was recently awakened by the bell at midnight, and told by her inexperienced daughter, “Baby has the croup. What shall I do with it?” Grandmamma replied she would call the family doctor, and would be there in a minute. Grandmamma woke the doctor, and told him the terrible news. He in turn asked to be put in telephone communication with the anxious mamma. “Lift the child to the telephone, and let me hear it cough,” he commands. The child is lifted, and it coughs. “That's not the croup,” he declares, and declines to leave his house on such small matters. He advises grandmamma also to stay in bed; and, all anxiety quieted, the trio settle down happy for the night.(138) Concerns over infraglottic and bronchial infections have been a source of anxiety and lost sleep for many children, parents, and physicians long before the advent of the telephone. The annual incidence of lower respiratory tract infections in children younger than 6 years old exceeds 5 million in the United States.(83) Despite the frequency of these infections, the often common and nonspecific clinical symptomatology, variable severity, and changing epidemiology over time all have contributed to our understanding and misunderstanding of these disorders. The anxiety of the relatives described in the opening passage is a poignant reminder that the diagnosis of diphtheritic croup at that time carried a mortality of around 25%.(62) By simple definition, laryngitis, tracheitis, bronchitis, and any combination of terms (e.g., laryngotracheitis, laryngotracheobronchitis [LTB], tracheobronchitis) represent inflammatory conditions of part or parts of the airway.42, 155 In this basic form, no specific causes, infectious or noninfectious, are implied by these terms.","Uba, Alan",Prim Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7119357/,360
10499,Modeling Behavioral Response to Vaccination Using Public Goods Game,2019-03-07,"Social media analytics has drawn new quantitative insights of human activity patterns. Many applications of social media analytics, from pandemic prediction to earthquake response, require an in-depth understanding of how these patterns change when human encounter unfamiliar conditions. In this paper, we select two earthquakes in China as the social context in Sina-Weibo (or Weibo for short), the largest Chinese microblog site. After proposing a formalized Weibo information flow model to represent the information spread on Weibo, we study the information spread from three main perspectives: individual characteristics, the types of social relationships between interactive participants, and the topology of real interaction networks. The quantitative analyses draw the following conclusions. First, the shadow of Dunbar’s number is evident in the “declared friends/followers” distributions, and the number of each participant’s friends/followers who also participated in the earthquake information dissemination show the typical power-law distribution, indicating a rich-gets-richer phenomenon. Second, an individual’s number of followers is the most critical factor in user influence. Strangers are very important forces for disseminating real-time news after an earthquake. Third, two types of real interaction networks share the scale-free and small-world property, but with a looser organizational structure. In addition, correlations between different influence groups indicate that when compared with other online social media, the discussion on Weibo is mainly dominated and influenced by verified users.",,IEEE Trans Comput Soc Syst,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7176041/,360

Our aims were to decrease median time to first parental hold of neonates requiring respiratory support from 6.4 to 3 days, and to increase the percentage of neonates held within the first 24 h after birth from 6 to 75%. METHODS: Lean Six Sigma methodology was used to identify barriers to holding and opportunities for improvement. INTERVENTION: A multifactorial improvement bundle was implemented to reduce the time to first parental hold of critically ill neonates. RESULTS: Median time to first parental hold was reduced from 6.4 to 1.2 days (p < 0.01). Infants held within the first 24 h after birth increased from 6 to 35%. There was no increase in adverse events associated with parental holding. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of an improvement bundle resulted in a significant reduction in time to first parental hold of infants requiring respiratory support.","Kenaley, Kaitlin M.; Rickolt, Annette L.; Vandersteur, Derek A.; Ryan, Julia D.; Stefano, John L.",J Perinatol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7223435/,360
13892,Author Correction: Data visualisation to support obesity policy: case studies of data tools for planning and transport policy in the UK,2019-02-15,"Heart failure (HF) represents one of the leading causes of cardiovascular diseases with high rates of hospitalization, morbidity and mortality worldwide. Ample evidence has consolidated a crucial role for mitochondrial injury in the progression of HF. It is well established that mitochondrial Ca(2+) participates in the regulation of a wide variety of biological processes, including oxidative phosphorylation, ATP synthesis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, mitochondrial dynamics and mitophagy. Nonetheless, mitochondrial Ca(2+) overload stimulates mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening and mitochondrial swelling, resulting in mitochondrial injury, apoptosis, cardiac remodeling, and ultimately development of HF. Moreover, mitochondria possess a series of Ca(2+) transport influx and efflux channels, to buffer Ca(2+) in the cytoplasm. Interaction at mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum membranes (MAMs) may also participate in the regulation of mitochondrial Ca(2+) homeostasis and plays an essential role in the progression of HF. Here, we provide an overview of regulation of mitochondrial Ca(2+) homeostasis in maintenance of cardiac function, in an effort to identify novel therapeutic strategies for the management of HF.","Xu, Hai-xia; Cui, Su-mei; Zhang, Ying-mei; Ren, Jun",Acta Pharmacol Sin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7608470/,360

16012,Observations in the Time of Pandemic,2021-03-05,"Introduction: Echocardiography is widely used because of its portability, high temporal resolution, absence of radiation, and due to the low-costs. Over the past years, echocardiography has been recommended by the European Society of Cardiology in most cardiac diseases for both diagnostic and prognostic purposes. These recommendations have led to an increase in number of performed studies each requiring diligent processing and reviewing. The standard work pattern of image analysis including quantification and reporting has become highly resource intensive and time consuming. Existence of a large number of datasets with digital echocardiography images and recent advent of AI technology have created an environment in which artificial intelligence (AI) solutions can be developed successfully to automate current manual workflow. Methods and Results: We report on published AI solutions for echocardiography analysis on methods' performance, characteristics of the used data and imaged population. Contemporary AI applications are available for automation and advent in the image acquisition, analysis, reporting and education. AI solutions have been developed for both diagnostic and predictive tasks in echocardiography. Left ventricular function assessment and quantification have been most often performed. Performance of automated image view classification, image quality enhancement, cardiac function assessment, disease classification, and cardiac event prediction was overall good but most studies lack external evaluation. Conclusion: Contemporary AI solutions for image acquisition, analysis, reporting and education are developed for relevant tasks with promising performance. In the future major benefit of AI in echocardiography is expected from improvements in automated analysis and interpretation to reduce workload and improve clinical outcome. Some of the challenges have yet to be overcome, however, none of them are insurmountable.","Schuuring, Mark J.; Išgum, Ivana; Cosyns, Bernard; Chamuleau, Steven A.

16674,Editorial: Outside the Comfort Zone: What Can Psychology Learn From Tourism (and Vice Versa),2021-03-25,"BACKGROUND: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a chronic neurodevelopmental condition with a prevalence rate above 1%, characterized by deficits in social communication and interaction; restrictive, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities; and a preference for sameness and routines. The majority of adult ASD patients suffer from comorbid conditions such as depression and anxiety. Therapy options for adult ASD patients are lacking, with presently no available evidence-based interventions in Germany. Recently, two interventions to improve social responsiveness have been published. FASTER (“Freiburger Asperger-Spezifische Therapie für ERwachsene” = Freiburg Asperger-specific therapy for adults) is a manualized group psychotherapy program including three modules on psychoeducation, stress regulation management, and non-verbal and verbal social communication training with videotaped tasks. SCOTT&EVA (“Social Cognition Training Tool”, and its enhancement “Emotionen Verstehen und Ausdruecken” = understanding and expressing emotions) is a computer-based training program to enhance social cognition including video and audio material of emotional expressions and complex real-life social situations. Initial studies for both programs have shown good feasibility and efficacy. METHODS: Three hundred sixty adult participants with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) will take part in a randomized controlled three-armed multi-center trial to prove the efficacy of manualized group psychotherapy and a manualized computer-based training program. Both interventions will be compared with a treatment as usual (TAU) group, aiming to establish evidence-based psychotherapy approaches for adult individuals with ASD. The primary outcome is evaluated by parents, spouses, or others who have sufficient insight into the respective participant’s social communication and interaction, and will be measured with the Social Responsiveness Scale. First, each of both interventions will be compared to TAU. If at least one of the differences is significant, both interventions will be compared against each other. The primary outcome will be measured at baseline (T0) and 4 months after baseline (T1). DISCUSSION: The trial is the first to validate psychiatric therapeutic and training interventions for adult ASD patients in Germany. A trial is needed because the prevalence of ASD in adulthood without intellectual disability is high, and no evidence-based intervention can be offered in Germany.

17621,Crystal and solution structures reveal oligomerization of individual capsid homology domains of Drosophila Arc,2021-05-14,"Human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) is the leading cause of bronchiolitis in infants. Two subgroups of HRSV (A and B) routinely cocirculate. Most research has been performed with HRSV-A strains because these are easier to culture than HRSV-B strains. In this study, we aimed to compare the replicative fitness and HRSV-induced innate cytokine responses of HRSV-A and HRSV-B strains in disease-relevant cell culture models. We used two recombinant (r) clinical isolate-based HRSV strains (A11 and B05) and one recombinant laboratory-adapted HRSV strain (A2) to infect commercially available nasal, bronchial, and small-airway cultures. Epithelial cells from all anatomical locations were susceptible to HRSV infection despite the induction of a dominant type III interferon response. Subgroup A viruses disseminated and replicated faster than the subgroup B virus. Additionally, we studied HRSV infection and innate responses in airway organoids (AOs) cultured at air-liquid interface (ALI). Results were similar to the commercially obtained bronchial cells. In summary, we show that HRSV replicates well in cells from both the upper and the lower airways, with a slight replicative advantage for subgroup A viruses. Lastly, we showed that AOs cultured at ALI are a valuable model for studying HRSV ex vivo and that they can be used in the future to study factors that influence HRSV disease severity. IMPORTANCE Human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) is the major cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in young infants and causes almost 200,000 deaths per year. Currently, there is no vaccine or treatment available, only a prophylactic monoclonal antibody (palivizumab). An important question in HRSV pathogenesis research is why only a fraction (1 to 3%) of infants develop severe disease. Model systems comprising disease-relevant HRSV isolates and accurate and reproducible cell culture models are indispensable to study infection, replication, and innate immune responses. Here, we used differentiated AOs cultured at ALI to model the human airways. Subgroup A viruses replicated better than subgroup B viruses, which we speculate fits with epidemiological findings that subgroup A viruses cause more severe disease in infants. By using AOs cultured at ALI, we present a highly relevant, robust, and reproducible model that allows for future studies into what drives severe HRSV disease.","Rijsbergen, L. C.; Lamers, M.

21339,A Nomogram for the Determination of the Necessity of Concurrent Chemotherapy in Patients With Stage II–IVa Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma,2021-09-06,"BACKGROUND: AKI is an important complication post cardiac surgery in children. An early diagnosis can help in mitigating complications and allow for prognostication. Urinary albumin:creatinine ratio (ACR) as a biomarker can provide a cheaper and more accessible AKI risk assessment and prediction. There is a paucity of paediatric literature regarding its utility. METHODS: This was a prospective observational study, enrolling all children aged 1 month to 18 years, who underwent cardiac surgery, with use of cardiopulmonary bypass. Cohort was divided into groups < 2 years and ≥ 2 years for analyses to account for differences in physiological albumin excretion with age. RESULTS: Of 143 children enrolled in the study, 36 developed AKI. In both age groups, the post-operative ACR was higher than pre-operative ACR among patients with and without AKI. In the group aged ≥ 2 years, the highest first post-operative ACR tertile (> 75.8 mg/g) predicted post-operative AKI after adjusting for clinical variables (adjusted RR, 11.71; 1.85–16.59). In the group aged < 2 years, the highest first post-operative ACR tertile (> 141.3 mg/g) predicted post-operative AKI in unadjusted analysis but not after adjusting for clinical variables (RR, 2.78; 0.70–6.65). For AKI risk prediction, AUC (95% CI) was highest after combining clinical model and pre-operative ACR for groups aged < 2 years [0.805 (0.713-0.896)] and ≥ 2 years [0.872 (0.772–0.973)]. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence for use of albuminuria as a feasible biomarker in AKI prediction in children post cardiac surgery, especially when added to a clinical model.

21504,Online Tools for Teaching Cancer Bioinformatics,2021-08-31,"BACKGROUND: This study investigated the immunogenicity and impact on nasopharyngeal carriage of a single dose of PCV10 given to 18-month-old Vietnamese children. This information is important for countries considering catch-up vaccination during PCV introduction and in the context of vaccination during humanitarian crises. METHODS: Two groups of PCV-naïve children within the Vietnam Pneumococcal Project received PCV10 (n=197) or no PCV (unvaccinated; n=199) at 18 months of age. Blood samples were collected at 18, 19, and 24 months of age, and nasopharyngeal swabs at 18 and 24 months of age. Immunogenicity was assessed by measuring serotype-specific IgG, opsonophagocytosis (OPA) and memory B cells (Bmem). Pneumococci were detected and quantified using real-time PCR and serotyped by microarray. FINDINGS: At 19 months of age, IgG and OPA responses were higher in the PCV10 group compared with the unvaccinated group for all PCV10 serotypes and cross-reactive serotypes 6A and 19A. This was sustained out to 24 months of age, at which point PCV10-type carriage was 60% lower in the PCV10 group than the unvaccinated group. Bmem levels increased between 18 and 24 months of age in the vaccinated group. INTERPRETATION: We demonstrate strong protective immune responses in vaccinees following a single dose of PCV10 at 18 months of age, and a potential impact on herd protection through a substantial reduction in vaccine-type carriage. A single dose of PCV10 in the second year of life could be considered as part of catch-up campaigns or in humanitarian crises to protect children at high-risk of pneumococcal disease.","Higgins, Rachel A; Temple, Beth; Dai, Vo Thi Trang; Phan, Thanh V; Toan, Nguyen Trong; Spry, Leena; Toh, Zheng Quan; Nation, Monica L; Ortika, Belinda D; Uyen, Doan Y; Cheung, Yin Bun; Nguyen, Cattram D; Bright, Kathryn; Hinds, Jason; Balloch, Anne; Smith-Vaughan, Heidi; Huu, Tran Ngoc; Mulholland, Kim; Satzke, Catherine; Licciardi, Paul V",Lancet Reg Health West Pac,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8453212/,360

24079,Challenges to the European Exception: What Can S&T Do?,2006,"The first major pandemic of the new millennium that arose from southern China in 2002 was of zoonotic origin from wild game animals, called severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS]. The culprit was determined to be a coronavirus of animal origin [SARS-CoV]. The discovery of the SARS-CoV, which caused an outbreak of >8000 people in >30 countries with fatality of about 10%, resulted in intense search for novel coronaviruses with potentially high pathogenicity. Ten years later after the SARS pandemic, another novel coronavirus crossed the species barrier from bats to humans through an intermediate camel host, to produce a severe lower respiratory infection labeled the Middle East respiratory syndrome [MERS]. A novel coronavirus [MERS-CoV] was first identified in September 2012, from patients who resided or traveled to Saudi Arabia. The MERS-CoV spread through contacts with camel and subsequently from human to human via droplet transmission. MERS cases occurred in several other countries including in Europe and the United States, mainly from residence or travel to the Arabian Peninsula, but was not of pandemic potential. However, in the spring of 2015, a MERS outbreak started in South Korea which was initiated by a returning traveler from Saudi Arabia, and subsequently secondary infection of over 186 local residents occurred. Recent estimate in May 2015 indicates that the MERS-CoV have afflicted 1167 patients with MERS worldwide with 479 deaths [41% fatality]. Thus MERS is more deadly than SARS but appears to be less contagious. However, unlike SARS which has not reappeared since 2002–2003, MERS-CoV have the potential to cause sporadic or local outbreaks for many years as the virus may now be entrenched endemically in dromedary camels of the Middle East.","Fong, I.

24310,Financial Services Industry,2012,"The inference of ancestral genomes is a fundamental problem in molecular evolution. Due to the statistical nature of this problem, the most likely or the most parsimonious ancestral genomes usually include considerable error rates. In general, these errors cannot be abolished by utilizing more exhaustive computational approaches, by using longer genomic sequences, or by analyzing more taxa. In recent studies we showed that co-evolution is an important force that can be used for significantly improving the inference of ancestral genome content. In this work we formally define a computational problem for the inference of ancestral genome content by co-evolution. We show that this problem is NP-hard and present both a Fixed Parameter Tractable (FPT) algorithm, and heuristic approximation algorithms for solving it. The running time of these algorithms on simulated inputs with hundreds of protein families and hundreds of co-evolutionary relations was fast (up to four minutes) and it achieved an approximation ratio < 1.3. We use our approach to study the ancestral genome content of the Fungi. To this end, we implement our approach on a dataset of 33,931 protein families and 20,317 co-evolutionary relations. Our algorithm added and removed hundreds of proteins from the ancestral genomes inferred by maximum likelihood (ML) or maximum parsimony (MP) while slightly affecting the likelihood/parsimony score of the results. A biological analysis revealed various pieces of evidence that support the biological plausibility of the new solutions.","Tuller, Tamir; Birin, Hadas; Kupiec, Martin; Ruppin, Eytan",Comparative Genomics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120581/,360

Veelal betreft het onschuldige aandoeningen, vaak van infectieuze aard. Meestal zijn deze aandoeningen ‘self-limiting’ en horen ze bij een normale ontwikkeling. De toediening van medicijnen heeft zin als onderdeel van een gerichte behandeling. Het voorschrijven van geneesmiddelen aan kinderen is helaas (nog steeds) zelden onderbouwd door goed wetenschappelijk onderzoek naar de effectiviteit en veiligheid ervan bij kinderen. Veelal zijn het soort en de dosering van geneesmiddelen afgeleid van bekende toepassingen en doseringen bij volwassenen. Een dosering wordt daarbij veelal omgerekend op grond van het lichaamsgewicht. Hoewel dit bij jonge kinderen over het algemeen een goed uitgangspunt is voor het berekenen van de juiste dosering, moet er bij oudere kinderen (globaal boven de acht jaar) rekening worden gehouden met de maximale dosering voor volwassenen, omdat men deze onbedoeld kan overschrijden bij het berekenen van de dosering per kg lichaamsgewicht bij deze (oudere) leeftijdsgroep. Voor pasgeborenen en zuigelingen bestaan vaak aparte doseringsvoorschriften.

Enabling such communication is not trivial, as every scientific field develops its own jargon with implicit understandings that can easily escape an outsider. We describe here our approach to enforce an explicit and exact data representation for the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB Peters et al. 2005) through the use of a formal ontology. Being the first database of its scale in the immune epitope domain, it was necessary for the IEDB to devise an adequate data structure at the outset of the project with the goal that it should be capable of capturing the context of immune recognition. Early on, it became readily apparent that an unambiguous description of the information being captured is imperative for consistent curation across journal articles and among curators. Accordingly, an initial ontology was developed (Sathiamurthy et al. 2005) based upon consultations with domain experts and guidance from expert ontologists. The structure devised from this ontology proved capable of dealing with a great deal of immunological data over time.","Greenbaum, Jason A.; Vita, Randi; Zarebski, Laura M.; Sette, Alessandro; Peters, Bjoern",Bioinformatics for Immunomics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121563/,360

This is particularly difficult in the PICU patient because many of the standard modes of nutritional monitoring, although well described and available, are fraught with difficulties. Thus, repeated anthropometric and laboratory markers must be jointly analyzed but individually interpreted according to disease and metabolic changes, in order to modify and monitor the nutritional treatment. In addition, isotope techniques are neither clinically feasible nor compatible with the multiple measurements needed to follow progression. On the other hand, indirect alternatives exist but may have pitfalls, of which the clinician must be aware. Risks exist for both overfeeding and underfeeding of PICU patients so that an accurate monitoring of energy expenditure, using targeted indirect calorimetry, is necessary to avoid either extreme. This is very important, since the monitoring of the nutritional status of the critically ill child serves as a guide to early and effective nutritional intervention.","Briassoulis, George",Pediatric Critical Care Medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121882/,360

However, developing countries are more exposed and more vulnerable due to a multitude of factors, including geographic, demographic and socio-economic factors. Noncommunicable diseases like cardio-vascular diseases, cancer, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and mental disorders are affecting developing countries with an increasing trend. In parallel, 10.1007/978-0-387-78665-0_5343 such as HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, acute respiratory infections and diarrheal disease are causing high mortality rates especially in low and middle income countries. Other diseases like the so-called neglected diseases are exclusively afflicting developing countries. Low-income countries are particularly affected by lymphatic filariasis, leishmaniasis, schistosomiasis, Buruli ulcer, cholera, cysticercosis, dracunculiasis, foodborne trematode infections, hydatidosis, soil-transmitted helminthiasis (ascariasis, trichuriasis, hookworm diseases), trachoma, sleeping sickness, onchocerciasis, Chagas disease, dengue and others. Beyond the high mortality and morbidity rates caused by communicable and/or noncommunicable diseases in developing countries, the global burden includes economic losses due to care for diseases and disabilities but also as a lack of productivity. More generally, communicable and noncommunicable diseases are impeding human development in developing countries by their negative impact on education, income and life expectancy and other health indicators.

A large part of the burden caused by noncommunicable diseases like cardio vascular diseases, cancer, diabetes, obesity and others can be avoided by preventive measures, early diagnosis and detection and mainly by controlling risk factors such as smoking, alcohol, diet, and physical inactivity. Similarly, the impact of communicable diseases can be alleviated by efficient strategies, including affordability of treatments, development of new vaccines and medicines, improvement of environmental conditions and general incentives and sensitization.","Boutayeb, A.",Handbook of Disease Burdens and Quality of Life Measures,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122505/,360
25974,Hochsicherheitslabor,2016-06-21,The eukaryotic abundant high mobility group HMGA and HMGB proteins can act as architectural transcription factors by promoting the assembly of higher-order protein-DNA complexes which can either activate or repress gene expression. The structural organisation of both classes of protein is similar with either a single or repeated DNA binding domain preceding a short negatively charged C-terminal tail. In the HMGB class of proteins the HMG DNA-binding domain binds non-specifically and introduces a sharp bend into DNA whereas the AT-hook in the HMGA protein binds preferentially to A/T rich regions of DNA and stabilises a B-DNA structure. The acidic tails are hypothesised to facilitate the interaction of the proteins with nudeosomes by binding to the positively charged histone tails.

Although the implementation of effective measures resulted in a significant decrease of global mortality, much remains to be done. The burden of GE in the neonatal age is generally reduced in relation to some protective factors (breastfeeding, minimal exposure to water and contaminated food, passive maternal immunity). In newborns, the contribution of the various causative agents could differ from that of the other pediatric age groups, nevertheless Rotavirus and pathogenic strains of E. coli remain the main etiologies. The acquisition of the pathogen generally occurs through the contaminated birth canal or by the use of contaminated tools, objects, or hands of the caregivers. The clinical presentation may vary widely from an acute, self-limiting disease to life-threatening complicated infections. The assessment of the dehydration and its rapid correction represent the cornerstones of the management of any GE. Antibiotic therapy should be reserved to cases with systemic symptoms, severe dehydration, or in the presence of bloody diarrhea. While the occurrence of diarrhea in the neonatal age is mainly caused by acute gastrointestinal infections, differential diagnosis with several other diseases including forms of severe congenital disorders should be considered.","De Luca, Andrea; Zanelli, Giacomo",Neonatology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123415/,360

New Zealand Universities have aspired to create stronger linkages with institutions overseas to access external research income that may be funnelled through principal investigators at overseas Universities. In November 2015, the New Zealand government asked the “Productivity Commission” to write a report with recommendations on how to create “new models” for tertiary education. The Commission was tasked to investigate “how trends in technology, internationalisation, population, tuition costs and demand for skills may drive changes in models of tertiary education”. For future growth, the Universities need to partner more effectively with industry and create a culture that truly believes that a country like New Zealand deserves a great University system, and that the Universities are a true asset, essential for the country to thrive.

Real-world dynamic graphs are continuously evolved where new nodes and edges are introduced or removed during graph evolution. Most existing dynamic graph representation learning methods focus on modeling dynamic graphs with fixed nodes due to the complexity of modeling dynamic graphs, and therefore, cannot efficiently learn the evolutionary patterns of real-world evolving graphs. Moreover, existing methods generally model the structural information of evolving graphs separately from temporal information. This leads to the loss of important structural and temporal information that could cause the degradation of predictive performance of the model. By employing an innovative neural network architecture based on graph attention networks and temporal convolutions, our framework jointly learns graph representations contemplating evolving graph structure and temporal patterns. We propose a deep attention model to learn low-dimensional feature representations which preserves the graph structure and features among series of graph snapshots over time. Experimental results on multiple real-world dynamic graph datasets show that, our proposed method is competitive against various state-of-the-art methods.","Fathy, Ahmed; Li, Kan",Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206228/,360

In response, we point to the value of live, place-based debate in HE institutions to highlight distributional inequity, raise local voices and connect these with national policy. Yet even as we compiled this article about HE debate, the Covid-19 pandemic took hold globally, cancelling face-to-face meetings, by necessity.

32906,Dimensions and Contradictions of the European Integration: Deepening Versus Widening,2020-05-27,"Atmospheric pollutants and cigarette smoke influence the human respiratory system and induce airway inflammation, injury, and pathogenesis. Activation of the NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) transcription factor and downstream antioxidant response element (ARE)-mediated transcriptions play a central role in protecting respiratory cells against reactive oxidative species (ROS) that are induced by airway toxins and inflammation. Recent studies have revealed that Nrf2 can also target and activate many genes involved in developmental programs such as cell proliferation, cell differentiation, cell death, and metabolism. Nrf2 is closely regulated by the interaction with kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1), while also directly interacts with a number of other proteins, including inflammatory factors, transcription factors, autophagy mediators, kinases, epigenetic modifiers, etc. It is believed that the multiple target genes and the complicated interacting network of Nrf2 account for the roles of Nrf2 in physiologies and pathogeneses. This chapter summarizes the molecular functions and protein interactions of Nrf2, as well as the roles of Nrf2 and the Nrf2-interacting network in respiratory inflammation and diseases, including acute lung injury (ALI), asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pulmonary fibrosis (PF), cystic fibrosis (CF), viral/bacterial infections, and lung cancers.

They utilize a debugging hardware feature in modern Intel CPUs, Processor Trace (PT), to efficiently collect runtime contextual information. These PT-based CFI mechanisms offload the processing of the collected PT trace and CFI enforcement onto idle cores. However, a processor does not always have idle cores due to the commonly-used multi-threaded applications such as web browsers. In fact, dedicating one or more cores for CFI enforcement reduces the number of available cores for running user programs. Our evaluation with a state-of-the-art CFI mechanism ([Formula: see text]CFI) shows that the performance overhead of a CFI mechanism can substantially increase (up to 652% on a single-core processor) when there is no idle core for CFI enforcement. To improve the performance of [Formula: see text]CFI, we propose to leverage a hardware monitor that unlike PT does not incur trace processing overhead. We show that the hardware monitor can be used to efficiently collect program traces (<1% overhead) in their original forms and apply [Formula: see text]CFI. We prototype the hardware-monitor based [Formula: see text]CFI on a single-core RISC-V processor.

Due to the high complexity of the verification problem (non-elementary), we introduce an incomplete procedure for the construction of Presburger stage graphs, and implement it on top of an SMT solver.

37412,Building up financial literacy and financial resilience,2020-07-31,"Transformation in a political system regarding number of parties is a significant phenomenon which creates ample grounds for scholarly discourse. The Pakistani political system witnessed a change in the party politics where it transformed from a two-party system to a three-party system in a relatively short time period. Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf emerged on the political scene and after just two elections was able to form a government. Challenging the status quo political forces through organizational mobilization, ideology, counter narrative, and redeeming civil military balance, PTI successfully achieved the systemic transformation in political structure of Pakistan. The change in a complex political fabric was attempted across various spectrums of party dynamics and electoral mechanics both at the federal and provincial legislatures employing diverse strategies. The challenge at hand is the translation of those mechanics of change into political realities and policy orientations while dealing with structural intricacies, domestic compulsions of economy, and external relations. China has less experience dealing with this change in the political system and this new important player in Pakistan’s politics. PTI also lacks experience managing external relations which has implications for both the important stakeholders. Undergoing political transition dealing with resistance to change from political actors and managing external relations will define the future of political stability and its impact over China–Pakistan relations.","Wu, Xiang; Ali, Salman",Chin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7382323/,360

It has been suggested that Chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), which were primarily employed as prophylaxis and treatment for malaria, could be used to treat COVID-19. CQ and HCQ may be potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells, which is mediated via the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and may also inhibit subsequent intracellular processes which lead to COVID-19, including damage to the cardiovascular system. However, paradoxically, CQ and HCQ have also been reported to cause damage to the cardiovascular system. In this review, we provide a critical examination of the published evidence. CQ and HCQ could potentially be useful drugs in the treatment of COVID-19 and other ACE2 involved virus infections, but the antiviral effects of CQ and HCQ need to be tested in more well-designed clinical randomized studies and their actions on the cardiovascular system need to be further elucidated. However, even if it were to turn out that CQ and HCQ are not useful drugs in practice, further studies of their mechanism of action could be helpful in improving our understanding of COVID-19 pathology.","Chen, Li; Chen, Haiyan; Dong, Shan; Huang, Wei; Chen, Li; Wei, Yuan; Shi, Liping; Li, Jinying; Zhu, Fengfeng; Zhu, Zhu; Wang, Yiyang; Lv, Xiuxiu; Yu, Xiaohui; Li, Hongmei; Wei, Wei; Zhang, Keke; Zhu, Lihong; Qu, Chen; Hong, Jian; Hu, Chaofeng; Dong, Jun; Qi, Renbin; Lu, Daxiang; Wang, Huadong; Peng, Shuang; Hao, Guang",Function (Oxf),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7454642/,360

39705,Stewardship and Shareholder Engagement in Germany,2020-09-23,"BACKGROUND: The increase in the number of pediatric patients with complex health conditions necessitates the application of advance care planning for children. Earlier, withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment was taboo in the medical society in South Korea due to the history of such practice being punishable by law, and physicians tended to pursue aggressive treatment. With changes in public opinion on end-of-life care, the Korean government enacted a new law that protect human dignity by respecting patients’ self-determination and facilitating advance care planning. However, little is known about current state of advance care planning for pediatric patients. The study aimed to assess perceptions regarding advance care planning among South Korean pediatricians and clarify any differences in perception among pediatric subspecialties. METHODS: This study was an observational cross-sectional survey that used a web-based self-report questionnaire. Participants comprised of pediatricians currently caring for children with life-limiting conditions in 2018. RESULTS: Of the 96 respondents, 89 were included in the analysis. In a hypothetical patient scenario, more hemato-oncologists and intensivists than neonatologists and neurologists preferred to provide comfort care than aggressive treatment. While 72.2% of hemato-oncologists reported that they usually or always discuss advance care plans with parents during treatment, more than half of other pediatricians reported that they seldom do so. Furthermore, 65% of respondents said that they never discuss advance care planning with adolescent patients. Moreover, there were no notable differences among subspecialties. The most prevalent answers to factors impeding advance care planning were lack of systemic support after performing advance care planning (82.0%) and uncertain legal responsibilities (70.8%). CONCLUSIONS: The pediatricians differed in their experiences and attitudes toward advance care planning based on their subspecialty. Consequently, institutional support and education should be provided to physicians so that they can include children and families in discussions on prognosis.","Song, In Gyu; Kang, Sung Han; Kim, Min Sun; Kim, Cho Hee; Moon, Yi Ji; Lee, Jung",BMC Palliat Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7500719/,360

An increasing number of CIP cases have been reported since 2015, which are attributed to the augmentation of approvals and uses of ICIs, but a comprehensive understanding of CIP is still lacking.

40826,Spatial impacts of fiscal stimulus policies during the 2009 global financial crisis in Indonesia,2020-10-15,"PURPOSE: Overweight and obesity are associated with one of the severe phenotypes of asthma, with an increased rate of exacerbations, low level of lung function, and reduced response to corticosteroid therapy. The present study focused on identifying useful biomarkers of severity in overweight patients with adult-onset asthma using real-world data. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 56 patients with adult-onset asthma who visited Saga University Hospital between 2018 and 2019 were retrospectively reviewed. Overweight was defined as a body mass index (BMI) greater than 25 kg/m(2). Blood eosinophils, cytokines, and chemokines were compared between non-overweight asthma and overweight asthma patients. RESULTS: Overweight asthma patients had a higher annual exacerbation rate, lower pulmonary function even when treated frequently with high-dose inhaled corticosteroids, and a significantly lower percentage of eosinophils and lower eosinophil count compared to non-overweight asthma patients (p<0.01, p=0.03). Moreover, the percentage of eosinophils was significantly negatively correlated with BMI (ρ=−0.38, p<0.01) (Figure 1). On serum cytokine and chemokine analyses, the overweight asthma group included significantly more patients with a lower level of tissue growth factor α (TGF-α) (1.1 pg/mL) and higher levels of hsIL-6 (2.5 pg/mL), RANTES/CCL5 (298.5 pg/mL), and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) (63.7 pg/mL), than the non-overweight asthma group (p=0.02, p<0.01, p=0.02, p=0.01, respectively). CONCLUSION: The present study showed that overweight patients with adult-onset asthma were characterized by a higher rate of annual exacerbations and worse lung function despite treatment with high-dose inhaled corticosteroids and lower blood eosinophil counts than non-overweight patients with asthma. On blood cytokine and chemokine analyses, a low level of TGF-α and high levels of hsIL-6, RANTES/CCL5, and VEGF-A might be biomarkers reflecting the pathophysiology in overweight patients with asthma.","Tashiro, Hiroki; Takahashi, Koichiro; Sadamatsu, Hironori; Kurihara, Yuki; Haraguchi, Tetsuro; Tajiri, Ryo; Takamori, Ayako; Kimura, Shinya; Sueoka-Aragane, Naoko",J Asthma Allergy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7537834/,360

However, the role of LL-37 as a T cell self-antigen in the context of atherosclerosis remains unclear. The objective of this study was to test for the presence of T cells reactive to LL-37 in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Furthermore, the role of T cells reactive to LL-37 in atherosclerosis was assessed using apoE−/− mice immunized with the LL-37 mouse ortholog, mCRAMP. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with ACS were stimulated with LL-37. PBMCs from stable coronary artery disease (CAD) patients or self-reported subjects served as controls. T cell memory responses were analyzed with flow cytometry. Stimulation of PBMCs with LL-37 reduced CD8+ effector T cell responses in controls and patients with stable CAD but not in ACS and was associated with reduced programmed cell death protein 1 (PDCD1) mRNA expression. For the mouse studies, donor apoE−/− mice were immunized with mCRAMP or adjuvant as controls, then T cells were isolated and adoptively transferred into recipient apoE−/− mice fed a Western diet. Recipient mice were euthanized after 5 weeks. Whole aortas and hearts were collected for analysis of atherosclerotic plaques. Spleens were collected for flow cytometric and mRNA expression analysis. Adoptive transfer experiments in apoE−/− mice showed a 28% reduction in aortic plaque area in mCRAMP T cell recipient mice (P < 0.05). Fifty six percent of adjuvant T cell recipient mice showed calcification in atherosclerotic plaques, compared to none in the mCRAMP T cell recipient mice (Fisher’s exact test P = 0.003). Recipients of T cells from mice immunized with mCRAMP had increased IL-10 and IFN-γ expression in CD8+ T cells compared to controls. In conclusion, the persistence of CD8+ effector T cell response in PBMCs from patients with ACS stimulated with LL-37 suggests that LL-37-reactive T cells may be involved in the acute event. Furthermore, studies in apoE−/− mice suggest that T cells reactive to mCRAMP are functionally active in atherosclerosis and may be involved in modulating plaque calcification.","Chernomordik, Fernando; Cercek, Bojan; Lio, Wai Man; Mihailovic, Peter M.; Yano, Juliana; Herscovici, Romana; Zhao, Xiaoning; Zhou, Jianchang; Chyu, Kuang-Yuh; Shah, Prediman K.; Dimayuga, Paul C.",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7573569/,360

The purpose of this article, in keeping with the theme of the Journal of Organization Design Special Collection, is thus to invigorate research into the CHQ. We begin by explicating four canonical questions related to the design of the CHQ. We then survey fundamental changes in the business environment occurring in the twenty-first century, and discuss their potential implications for CHQ design. When suitable here we also refer to the contributions published in our Special Collection. Finally, we put forward recommendations for advancements and new directions for future research to foster a deeper and broader understanding of the topic. We believe that we are on the cusp of a change in the CHQ as radical as that which saw its initial emergence in the late nineteenth/early twentieth century.

41889,Epilogue,2020-11-10,"CASE REPORT - INTRODUCTION: It has been reported by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control that by May 2020 there were 230 suspected cases of PIMS-TR COVID-19. At Great Ormond Street Hospital NHS Foundation Trust (GOSH) there were 50 suspected cases. This report summarises the physiotherapy input to these patients outside of PICU. The rheumatology team were allocated the COVID-19positive ward and therefore were able to be involved in the evolving understanding of the clinical presentation and management of this new disease. CASE REPORT - CASE DESCRIPTION: 50 children were admitted to GOSH with suspected PIMS-TR COVID-19, of these, 36 were admitted to PICU. The mean length of stay in PICU was 4.6 days and the median 3.5 days (Range 1–16 days). The mean total length of stay in hospital was 11 days (range 2–94 days). 42% were male and 57% female and the age ranged from 5 weeks -17 years, but the mean age was 9 yrs. Most were previously well, but 3 had asthma, 2 diabetes, 1 obese, 1 with liver disease and 2 with sickle cell disease. The physiotherapy provided included assessment and relatively quickly it was recognised that these patients had a specific pattern of muscle weakness (proximal>distal) and so the Manual Muscle Test of 8 muscle groups (MMT8) and the Childhood Myositis Assessment Score (CMAS) were adopted as outcomes. The initial mean MMT8 score was 56/80 (42–79) and mean CMAS score 20/52 (4–51) Assessment of respiratory function, mobility and safety of postural changes including sitting to standing, gait and managing the stairs was also included. The treatment provided included breathing exercises and specific muscle strengthening that was progressed as able. Advice to the nursing and medical staff was provided to ensure that patients were safe while they were regaining strength and stability. Gait re-education and stairs assessment was completed before discharge. The patients have now been placed into a multidisciplinary assessment programme to follow up the long-term outcomes including physiotherapy outcomes. At the 2 months follow up the mean MMT8 was 72/80 and the mean CMAS is 46/52 indicating that there may be a long-term impact upon musculoskeletal function in young people. CASE REPORT - DISCUSSION: At GOSH the rheumatology physiotherapy team were redeployed to the temporary general paediatrics service. This service was responsible for the patients who were diagnosed with this new and evolving disease and who were transferred from the PICU. The physiotherapy team started to recognise the extent of their illness including postural instability, muscle weakness, severe fatigue, and joint involvement. The children also had impairment in respiratory function and cardiac function. It was recognised that mobility was limited for many reasons and care was required in the intensity and frequency of exercise and level of activity. Initially moving around the bed was exhausting and had to be effective and safe before progressing to weight-bearing and walking. Because the physiotherapy team were musculoskeletal specialists, they were able to consider different outcome measures and quickly decided upon using the MMT8 and the CMAS as well as assessing joint range of movement and muscle length. Respiratory assessments were also completed. It was also recognised that as the hospital had rapidly developed the COVID-19ward (Hedgehog ward) and as the staff were from many different areas of the hospital effective communication between this new team had to be established and within weeks a daily MDT meeting was started that ensured all aspects of each patients care were discussed to enable complete co-ordinated treatment of the patient. This meeting allowed staff to contribute to decisions about treatment as well as ensuring the nursing staff were informed about safety for each child regarding mobility. The meeting also allowed for discharge planning to ensure that every child was safe to be discharged and was able to physically manage at home. A weekly psychosocial meeting was also developed and so the psychological and social factors for each child and their family could also be considered and supported. CASE REPORT - KEY LEARNING POINTS: The hospital planned and prepared for the Pandemic and staff were placed together to work in different ways. Because of the diversity of the skills of the staff it was possible to recognise the many systems that were affected by the disease and to pull together the expertise of the staff to be able to provide a high level and holistic clinical management for each and every child. It has also been possible to explore outcome measures and to be able to work with each other and to learn and discuss treatments moving forwards. The speed in which a completely new service was established was impressive especially as there had been a misunderstanding initially that children would probably not be severely affected by COVID-19. The importance of physiotherapy treatment in order to enable these young people to regain strength, mobility and function was apparent and with the longer term follow up it is demonstrating that several of these patients need longer term care and treatment after discharge. The outcome measures that are being used for the longer term follow up; CMAS, MMT8, 6 min walking test as well as neurological examinations and questionnaires to assess function and psychological well-being and fatigue are able to be used if other patients develop this disease and these measures can be used nationwide in order to enable a cohesive approach to managing PIMS-TR COVID-19.","Maillard, Susan; Noar, Kim; Harris, Samantha; Hasson, Jeremy; Foy, Kathryn",Rheumatol Adv Pract,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7607307/,360

42257,Restructure Your Strategy for the Post‐COVID World,2020-10-05,"The public university in India was conceptualized to provide economically accessible and socially inclusive education. It has had the dual task of simultaneously critiquing and serving the nation. However, along with the declining quality of higher education, there has also been a significant decline in public funding recently. Increasing government intervention in the everyday life of university has further resulted in policies that inadvertently have much to do with increasing surveillance and regulation of university spaces. Placing this within the ambit of the national political situation, there was a lot of student activism and unrest on city streets and inside campuses. A global public health crisis in the midst of all this resulted in a tangential change from the above issues to those of infrastructure, access, and inclusion. At this juncture then, it becomes imperative to reevaluate the purpose of the existing institutions. The paper thus is an attempt to contextualize contemporary Indian higher education, in times of the pandemic. A qualitative approach using unstructured (physical and virtual) conversations along with literature survey has been used. An analysis of the factors, like research quality, institutionalized discrimination, infrastructure, and public funding, is used to decipher how the public university in India negotiates and exists as a prominent social institution in the country.","Urvashi, Shreya",Hu Arenas,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7665965/,360

42537,A financial market with singular drift and no arbitrage,2020-11-25,"INTRODUCTION: There is evidence to suggest that there is a mismatch between the number of reported cases of leprosy in India and the number of actual cases in the country. One reason could be that many patients are diagnosed and treated outside the NLEP network and dermatologists may be managing some of these patients not captured by official statistics. To estimate these missing numbers, the DermLep survey was carried out to study the number and profile of leprosy patients seen by dermatologists and their significance. METHODOLOGY: The DermLep survey was a questionnaire-based study to be filled in by participating dermatologists from all over India, both in private practice and in medical institutions. Participating dermatologists provided information on old and new leprosy patients seen in their clinic over a 3-month period. RESULTS: Total of 201 dermatologists from 20 states of India participated in the survey. 3701 leprosy patients (M: F ratio 2.1:1) were seen. Of them 46.62% (n = 1680) were new; 22.89% (n = 825) were under-treatment; and 19.65% (n = 708) were post RFT patients. Children <15 years constituted 4.29%, while elderly >60 years were 22.21%. As per WHO classification, MB were 73.36% and PB 28.46%. Of all patients 30.91% had lepra reactions, with T2R being more frequent. While 23.58% of all patients in the survey had G2D; in new patients 17.79%; and in post RFT patients 37% had G2D. Among the 1680 new cases seen, 59% were reported to NLEP by the dermatologists and 41% remained unreported mainly by the private dermatologists, among whom for 20% of the cases they mentioned “no access to register”. Source of MDT was WHO-MDT in 60.09% of new cases and for rest of 39.91% it was private pharmacies where private dermatologists had no access to MDT blister packs. CONCLUSION: This survey suggests that a good number of new-untreated leprosy patients, treatment defaulters and post RFT cases are managed by dermatologists in India. About 40% of the new patients managed mainly by private dermatologists are not being reported to NLEP for various reasons, and these constitute the “missing numbers” from government statistics. If extrapolated to the large of number of practicing dermatologists in India, these numbers could be very significant. The high percentage of G2D noted in patients surveyed (23.58%) and post RFT patient issues observed need special attention. There is a need to develop access for dermatologists to confidentially report leprosy patients treated at their clinics to the NLEP.","Rao, P.

International Large-scale Students Assessment (ILSA) studies have substantially contributed to this monitoring since the late 1990s. Both, the definition of the disciplines and domains evaluated and the results obtained, have motivated curricular reforms to adapt what is taught to children and young people to prepare them for a globalized world, with a strong presence of information and communication technology. The Chilean students’ results have impacted the system, especially by highlighting its weaknesses, related to little improvement over decades, differences in learning achieved by different groups of students, and performance below than expected in the most economically and culturally advantaged sectors. To accomplish these challenges, the system has changed its organization and developed diverse strategies. Data provided by ILSA studies have been used to promote policies and programs for the improvement and strengthening of the most vulnerable groups and a general approach that promotes gender equality in education, politics, and labor.

Or Both?,2020-12-01,"The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of oropharyngeal aspiration on ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) incidence just prior to changing patient position. This randomized controlled experimental study was conducted between July 2015 and April 2019 in anesthesiology and reanimation of intensive care unit (ICU). The patients of experimental group underwent oropharyngeal aspiration under surgical aseptic conditions before each position change. Patients of the control group received oropharyngeal aspiration only as needed. The mean age of the patients was 62.87 ± 17.33 years. The mean and median duration of stay in the ICU were 27.28 ± 30.69 and 18.00 days respectively. The mean and median of duration of the mechanical ventilation support were 26.72 ± 30.65 and 18.00 (min 4; max 168) days respectively. Thirty percent of the patients were VAP. The mean duration of VAP development was 7.50 ± 5.07 days. The rate of VAP development was 11.23/1000 mechanical ventilator days. Only 8.3% of the experimental group patients developed VAP; 91.7% of the control group patients developed VAP. The VAP rate in the control group was 16.82/1000 mechanical ventilator days and the VAP rate in the experimental group was 2.41/1000 mechanical ventilator days. Most VAP agents were multidrug resistant. Distribution of isolated microorganisms was as Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Corynebacterium striatum, Staphylococcus aureus, Providencia stuartii, Serratia marcescens, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and Aspergillus flavus. In our study, it was concluded that oropharyngeal aspiration performed prior to patient position change prevented the development of VAP.","Akbiyik, Ayşe; Hepçivici, Ziynet; Eşer, Ismet; Uyar, Mehmet; Çetin, Perihan",Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7683036/,360

43766,Enduring the great recession: Economic integration in the European Union,2021-01-04,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: The presence of polymorphic gene variants in the human genome provides extensive genetic (and eventually phenotypic) variation affecting both normal physiological mechanisms and cancer pathogenesis. Functional genetic polymorphisms might have predictive and/or prognostic value in lung cancer, opening novel opportunities to improve prediction and guide clinical reasoning and therapeutics in lung cancer patients. Recent knowledge pinpoints a pleiotropic role for renin-angiotensin system, particularly in the lung and mainly through locally regulated alternative molecules and secondary pathways. Dysregulation of this system play a role in cell proliferation, hypoxia and angiogenesis, which processes are involved in lung cancer progression. Here we suggest that polymorphic variants in genes coding for renin-angiotensin system might play a role in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer progression. ABSTRACT: Introduction: The renin–angiotensin system (RAS) is involved in cell proliferation, immunoinflammatory response, hypoxia and angiogenesis, which are critical biological processes in lung cancer. Our aim was to study the association of putatively functional genetic polymorphisms in genes coding for proteins involved in RAS, hypoxia and angiogenesis with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) prognosis. Methods: Genotyping of 52 germline variants from genes of the RAS and hypoxic/angiogenic factors/receptors was performed using MassARRAY iPLEX Gold in a retrospective cohort (n = 167) of advanced NSCLC patients. Validation of the resulting genetic markers was conducted in an independent group (n = 190), matched by clinicopathological characteristics. Results: Multivariate analysis on the discovery set revealed that MME rs701109 C carriers were protected from disease progression in comparison with homozygous T (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.5, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.2–0.8, p = 0.010). Homozygous A and T genotypes for KDR rs1870377 were at increased risk for disease progression and death compared to heterozygous (HR = 1.7, 95% CI = 1.2–2.5, p = 0.005 and HR = 2.1, 95% CI = 1.2–3.4, p = 0.006, respectively). Carriers of homozygous genotypes for ACE2 rs908004 presented increased risk for disease progression, only in the subgroup of patients without tumour actionable driver mutations (HR = 2.9, 95% CI = 1.3–6.3, p = 0.010). Importantly, the association of homozygous genotypes in MME rs701109 with risk for disease progression was confirmed after multivariate analysis in the validation set. Conclusion: This study provides evidence that MME polymorphism, which encodes neprilysin, may modulate progression-free survival in advanced NSCLC. Present genetic variation findings will foster basic, translational, and clinical research on their role in NSCLC.","Catarata, Maria Joana; Medeiros, Rui; Oliveira, Maria José; Pêgo, Alice; Frade, João Gonçalo; Martins, Maria Fátima; Robalo Cordeiro, Carlos; Herth, Felix J.

Result of the measurement of demographic and clinical variables [Image: see text] Comparative analysis of the variables studied stratified by hospital outcome [Image: see text] METHODS: It includes a cohort of patients with pneumonia confirmed by Sars Cov 2 PCR-RT, treated at the Veracruz Norte branch of the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social from April to May 2020, analyzing the neutrophil-lymphocyte, platelet-lymphocyte and immunity-systemic inflammation indices. Correlation analysis of severity hematological variables with hospital outcome [Image: see text] RESULTS: We included 100 patients, 54 (54%) women and 46 (46%) men, with a mean age of 49.4 ± 19.3 years. The mean of leukocytes was 10,103.0 ± 4,289.0 cel / mm3, neutrophils 8,509.3 ± 4,216.0 cel / mm3 and lymphocytes of 1,112.7 ± 585.4 cel / mm3; Regarding the hematological indices used to measure severity, we found that the mean of the INL was 10.7 ± 10.9, that of the IPL was 290.1 ± 229.2 and that of the IIIS was 2.6 ± 3.4 x 109. Regarding the type of pneumonia, 54 (54%) had mild pneumonia and 46 (46%) had severe pneumonia. Regarding hospital outcomes, 75 (75%) of the patients were discharged due to clinical improvement and 25 (25%) of the patients died during the hospital stay. The mean age was significantly higher in the group of patients who died during the hospital stay (45.9 ± 18.6 VS 60.0 ± 17.5 years, p = 0.001), the proportion of women who died was higher and tended to be statistically significant. The mean INL was 20.4 ± 16.9 in patients who died VS 7.5 ± 4.9 in patients who improved (p = 0.001). The mean IPL was 417.1 ± 379.7 in patients who died VS 247.7 ± 127.4 in patients who had improvement; p = 0.038. Finally, the mean IIIS was significantly higher in patients who died VS patients who had clinical improvement (4.8 ± 6.1 VS 1.9 ± 1.2; p = 0.030, respectively). In the correlation analysis, high and significant r were found in the three indices.

The epidemic started in Wuhan, China, in December of 2019 and quickly spread to over 200 countries. COVID-19 can cause multiple organ injuries (e.g., kidney, heart, blood, and nervous system). Among them, acute kidney injury (AKI) is a critical complication due to its high incidence and mortality rate. So, it is essential to evaluate AKI in COVID-19 patients during this pandemic state. The aim of this work is to detect the occurrence of AKI in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. So, a retrospective study was conducted on hospitalized adult patients > 18 years old with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted to the Abo Teeg Hospital at Assiut City, Egypt, from May 1, 2020, to July 1, 2020. All data were collected from medical records, patients’ follow-up, and charts. Data were verified, coded by the researcher, and analyzed using IBM-SPSS 21.0. RESULTS: Eighty-six COVID-19 patients were admitted to Abo Teeg Hospital in Assiut City, Egypt, between May and July 2020. Thirty-eight patients (33%) were of the male gender. Mean age was 58.07 ± 17.9, and 61 patients developed AKI. 32.8% of the AKI group were a stage I severity (increase in serum creatinine by 0.3 mg/dl within 48 h), 21.3% of them presented by stage II (2–2.9 times increase in serum creatinine), and 45.9% were in stage III (3 times or more increase in serum creatinine). The overall hospital mortality for the patients admitted to ICU with AKI was 6.7% (11/61), compared to 1% (4/25) in those without AKI. CONCLUSION: Hospitalized patients with COVID-19 had a higher risk of AKI, and we recommended that those patients should be evaluated after discharge for the development of CKD.","Azeem, Haitham A.; Abdallah, Hytham; Abdelnaser, Mohamad M.",Egypt J Bronchol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7802983/,360

During this unique period, many water utilities have been forced to operate outside of design conditions with reduced workforce and financial capacities. Few studies have examined how water utilities respond to a pandemic; such methods are even absent from many emergency response plans. Here, we documented how utilities have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted a qualitative analysis of 30 interviews with 53 practitioners spanning 28 U.S. water utilities. Our aim was to, first, understand the challenges experienced by utilities and changes to operations (e.g., demand and deficit accounts) and, second, to document utilities’ responses. Results showed that to maintain service continuity and implement SDPs, utilities had to overcome various challenges. These include supply chain issues, spatiotemporal changes in demand, and financial losses, and these challenges were largely dependent on the type of customers served (e.g., commercial or residential). Examples of utilities’ responses include proactively ordering extra supplies and postponing capital projects. Although utilities’ adaptations ensured the immediate provision of water services, their responses might have negative repercussions in the future (e.g., delayed projects contributing to aging infrastructure).","Spearing, Lauryn A.; Thelemaque, Nathalie; Kaminsky, Jessica A.; Katz, Lynn E.; Kinney, Kerry A.; Kirisits, Mary Jo; Sela, Lina; Faust, Kasey M.",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7805597/,360
45025,"Introduction: Special Issue: Alcohol and Leisure, Sport and Tourism",2021-01-26,"This article analyzes the economic impact of the pandemic, providing insights into the consequences of alternative policies. Our framework focuses on three key features: (i) COVID-19 is a sectoral shock of unknown depth and duration affecting some sectors and technologies more than others; (ii) there are constraints in shifting resources across sectors; and (iii) there is a high level of uncertainty about the disease and its economic aftermath, inducing a high level of precautionary behavior by some agents and leading to others facing more severe credit constraints. Because of macroeconomic externalities, precautionary behavior exacerbates the downturn, and even sectors where COVID-19 does not directly affect consumption or production may face unemployment. Multipliers associated with different government expenditure programs differ markedly. The article describes policies that can mitigate precautionary behavior, leading to reduced unemployment. Greater wage flexibility may lead to increased unemployment. The precautionary behavior is the antithesis of equilibrium behavior, suggesting that standard equilibrium approaches may not provide the appropriate framework for analyzing the pandemic: individuals know that they don’t know the future, that existing and newly made contracts and plans may be broken, and that they need to be able to respond to these unknowable contingencies.","Stiglitz, Joseph E; Guzman, Martin M",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7799092/,360

Therefore, the use of some criteria has been proposed in order to give more objectivity to the diagnosis process. Two of them are the International Dental Federation (FDI) and the Caries Associated with Restorations and Sealants (CARS) criteria. Both methods have a different approach to caries, and it is not possible to know which one of them is the best to use in clinical practice to assess restorations in children. Thus, the present protocol aims to evaluate the effect of the use of the FDI and CARS criteria in the assessment of caries lesions around restorations in primary teeth on outcomes related to oral health in children and costs resulting from the assessments. Methods and analysis: A total of 626 restorations of children from three to 10 years were randomly assessed and are being treated following the FDI criteria (FDI group) or CARS criteria (CARS group). Participants will be followed-up after six, 12, 18, and 24 months. The primary outcome will be the need for a new intervention in the evaluated restorations. This outcome consists of several components, and each of these events will be analyzed separately as secondary outcomes. The changes in children’s oral health-related quality of life and the cost of the restoration dental treatments will also be analyzed as secondary outcomes. The methods will be compared using the Cox regression model with shared frailty. A significance level of 5% will be adopted for all statistical analyses.

46052,Correction to: Disinformation in Open Online Media,2020-10-19,"While previous studies have examined front-line teachers’ written feedback practices in second language (L2) writing classrooms, such studies tend to not take teachers’ language and sociocultural backgrounds into consideration, which may mediate their performance in written feedback provision. Therefore, much remains to be known about how L2 writing teachers with different first languages (L1) enact written feedback. To fill this gap, we designed an exploratory study to examine native English-speaking (NES) and non-native English-speaking (NNES) (i.e., Chinese L1) teachers’ written feedback practices in the Chinese tertiary context. Our study collected 80 English as a foreign language (EFL) students’ writing samples with teacher written feedback and analyzed them from three aspects: Feedback scope, feedback focus, and feedback strategy. The findings of our study revealed that the two groups of teachers shared similar practices regarding feedback scope and feedback strategies. Both NES and NNES EFL teachers used a comprehensive approach to feedback provision, although NNES teachers provided significantly more feedback points than their NES peers and they delivered their feedback directly and indirectly. However, their practices differed greatly with regard to feedback focus. Specifically, when responding to EFL students’ writing, NES teachers showed more concern with global issues (i.e., content and organization), whereas NNES teachers paid more attention to linguistic errors. With a surge in the recruitment of expatriate NES and local NNES English teachers in China and other EFL countries, our study is expected to make a contribution to a better understanding of the two groups of EFL teachers’ pedagogical practices in written feedback provision and generate important implications for their feedback provision.","Cheng, Xiaolong; Zhang, Lawrence Jun",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7890002/,360

Sepsis-related deaths have been reported to account for 19.7% of all global deaths. However, no effective and specific therapeutic for clinical sepsis management is available due to the complex pathogenesis. Concurrently eliminating infections and restoring immune homeostasis are regarded as the core strategies to manage sepsis. Sophisticated nanoplatforms guided by supramolecular and medicinal chemistry, targeting infection and/or imbalanced immune responses, have emerged as potent tools to combat sepsis by supporting more accurate diagnosis and precision treatment. Nanoplatforms can overcome the barriers faced by clinical strategies, including delayed diagnosis, drug resistance and incapacity to manage immune disorders. Here, we present a comprehensive review highlighting the pathogenetic characteristics of sepsis and future therapeutic concepts, summarizing the progress of these well-designed nanoplatforms in sepsis management and discussing the ongoing challenges and perspectives regarding future potential therapies. Based on these state-of-the-art studies, this review will advance multidisciplinary collaboration and drive clinical translation to remedy sepsis.

It appeared that some higher educational institutions and a certain part of their students were almost ready to go online as these institutions had been developing their online platforms thus integrating traditional face-to-face classes with computer-assisted learning as well as integrating massive open or shared online courses into their curricular. At the same time, many other universities and institutes proved to be absolutely unprepared to shift online as they and their students had neither their own educational environment and online resources developed by their teaching staff nor any experience of working in an external online environment and choosing courses appropriate for their educational purposes. It turned out that most existing online courses could not be successfully used for implementing into most universities curricula and for teaching a majority of technical students as they simply reproduced the traditional classroom learning process and missed all advantages and opportunities afforded by online learning environments. The authors objective for this research in progress is to identify the key features and describe structure, content and assessment specifics of an academical online course for technical students. This paper provides tips on how to organize the course content into a proper structure stressing what types of teaching materials could be uploaded to the educational platform and goes into its assessment specifics.

47637,The Implementation of European Privacy Law in Malta,2021-03-12,"In the winter and early spring of 2020, COVID-19 stunned the world. Across the globe, public health was slow to respond. Failures of surveillance—of gathering, understanding, and sharing information—drew part of the blame. These lapses were real and could have been anticipated. This volume addresses the ethical, political, and legal issues underlying difficulties in maintaining adequate surveillance for public health. It argues that public trust is essential to sustain surveillance. For trust to be warranted, publics must be assured that information will be used to promote health equitably. Transparency and oversight are needed to protect individuals against harm and groups against discrimination and stigma. Bringing together expertise from bioethics, law, political science, and public policy, the authors of this volume develop a comprehensive approach to sustaining surveillance in today’s changing, diverse, and unjust world.","Francis, John G.; Francis, Leslie P.",Sustaining Surveillance: The Importance of Information for Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7972164/,360

One of the weakest in the Russian Federation was the activity of the judiciary. The procedural legislation of the Russian Federation is based on the main basic principles, such as: legality, directness and oral proceedings, transparency, equality of the parties and others, the implementation of online dispute resolution to practice. Despite the adoption of various targeted programs to reform and modernize the judicial system of the Russian Federation, it is impossible to speak about their success, since the situation with the pandemic demonstrated the shortcomings of legal regulation, technical equipment and the unwillingness of most of the population to switch to a new digital format of life. Currently, the activity of the courts is aimed at stabilizing the entire judicial system by switching to an electronic form of interaction between all participants in court proceedings. The judicial community has realized the need to adapt new modern information and telecommunications technologies. China is a successful foreign experience of switching to an electronic judicial platform, which since 2017 has already created three Internet courts, and during the pandemic, so far we can talk about creating a new judicial system under the name of the Internet judicial system of the People's Republic of China.","Rusakova, Ekaterina P.; Frolova, Evgenia E.; Arzumanova, Lana L.",Modern Global Economic System: Evolutional Development vs,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7972256/,360

Dissatisfaction with high and long-term trade deficit stimulated the US to accept tariff restrictions in trade with China, which was called the “trade war”. The purpose of this paper is twofold: to identify the possible consequences of trade war for existing production linkages within the GVCs; to characterise the counter measures carried out both by Chinese companies and Chinese government. In this paper we consider only trade war direct effects on China. We highlight a set of implications of the trade war on China in terms of company performance. These effects include trade diversion (a short-term effect), switching suppliers (a medium-term effect), and production shift (a long-term effect). The combination of effects has led to a high probability of transformation along the GVCs. Chinese government responds in order to restore broken ties in the chain. One of the most important ways is to focus on the domestic market and move from an export-oriented economy to a consumer-oriented economy with technological and scientific leadership. China has set the task of combining the GVC model with the development of the internal value chain model. The reconstruction of the value chain will take place mostly between countries along the “One Belt – One Road”.","Volgina, Natalia A.; Pengfei, Liu",Modern Global Economic System: Evolutional Development vs,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7972276/,360
47737,Future Perspectives: Sustainability Communication as Scientific and Societal Challenge,2020-09-14,"Scientific research is based on the fact that the business activity of subjects is one of the key elements in achieving sustainable development goals. Considering that business activity is carried out on the basis of certain principles, the authors believe that the goals of sustainable development have an impact on the modernisation and the formation of new principles of business activity. Compliance with these principles contributes to the actualisation of the business (economic) turnover in modern reality. The aim of the article is to substantiate the formation of new principles of business activity of subjects as the main guiding principles of its implementation and appropriate regulation in the context of sustainable development. This study aims to prove that the following elements can be considered the new principles of management: a) ensuring the vital interests of entrepreneurs, consumers and society in information environment; b) corporate social responsibility; c) fair competition in entrepreneurship; d) corporate greening. To achieve this goal, the authors provided the characteristics of these principles and analysed the current state of their application. To solve the problem, first, the relationship between the listed principles and the goals of sustainable development is analysed. And secondly, the analysis of the influence of each of the principles on business activity is carried out. While conducting the scientific research, methods such as dialectical, system-structural analysis, formal-legal, comparative, as well as other methods and scientific approaches were used to achieve the goal of the study. In the course of the study, it was substantiated that the listed principles fully fit into the concept of sustainable development, which includes economic, social and environmental components. The conclusions summarise the characteristics of each of the new principles of business activity. Also, recommendations were formulated regarding the optimisation of the regulatory consolidation and the practical implementation of these economic principles, taking into account the European and Ukrainian experience. The results of the study are important for theory and practice, since they regard the presented principles as those that can be used to assess the activities of specific business entities, as well as the state of legislation and government policy. The obtained results of the assessment can be used to develop proposals for improving the legal regulation and state policy of the economic sphere (including business and entrepreneurial activity).","Kalachenkova, Kateryna; Melnyk, Svitlana; Pavliuchenko, Yuliia; Titova, Olena; Kvasnytska, Raisa",The Importance of New Technologies and Entrepreneurship in Business Development: In The Context of Economic Diversity in Developing Countries,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7972437/,360

A hemiplegic patients observe paralysis on one side of their body, and as so, loses autonomy and their quality of life decreases. In this study, we decided to only focus on the hand rehabilitation aspect. However, there is a clear tendency in stroke patients to stop training regularly when returning home from the hospital and the first part of their rehabilitation is over. They often experience demotivation, having the feeling that they will never get back to a fully autonomous person ever again and tend to put their training aside, especially when they do not see clear and visible results anymore. This is also due to the supervised training becoming sparser. All of this results in patients stagnating or even worse, regressing. Thus, we decided to offer a motivating solution for hand rehabilitation at home through gamification.","Duval-Dachary, Sarah; Chevalier-Lancioni, Jean-Philippe; Rossini, Mauro; Perego, Paolo; Covarrubias, Mario",Computers Helping People with Special Needs,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7972614/,360

Nevertheless, a detailed study on whether context should be incorporated implicitly (e.g. by spatial features) or explicitly (by exploiting classifiers tailored towards image analysis) and to which degree contextual information has a positive influence on the final classification result is missing in the literature. In this paper we close this gap by using projection-based Random Forests that allow to use various degrees of local context without changing the overall properties of the classifier (i.e. its capacity). Results on two PolSAR data sets - one airborne over a rural area, one space-borne over a dense urban area - show that local context indeed has substantial influence on the achieved accuracy by reducing label noise and resolving ambiguities. However, increasing access to local context beyond a certain amount has a negative effect on the obtained semantic maps.","Hänsch, Ronny",Pattern Recognition,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7972709/,360

Despite the documented rise in domestic violence incidents, seeking help while at home with an abuser remains difficult, if not near impossible. In addition to heightened security concerns for clients, the shared trauma, or shared traumatic reality, faced by clinicians has created unforeseen challenges with boundaries and the therapeutic relationship.

This paper highlights some of the missing elements of SNA accounts with respect to contribution of natural resources and its implications. Sustainability analyses call for the mainstreaming of a system of natural resource accounting that integrates information on environment-economy interactions. The System of Integrated Environmental and Economic Accounting (SEEA) by the UN provides the conceptual framework for understanding such interactions. It was adopted by the UNSD as the first international statistical standard for environmental-economic accounting in 2012, and the framework along with its standardised methodology serves as a ready reckoner for countries looking to mainstream natural resource accounting. This paper presents the conceptual framework and scope of the SEEA. Widespread adoption of SEEA will support critical global initiatives such the monitoring of SDG indicators, the post-2020 biodiversity agenda and international climate policy. In this context, the paper also presents the Indian narrative on the initiatives by the government towards mainstreaming of natural resource accounting, which have been sporadic, albeit noteworthy and encouraging.","Saksena, Shalini",Sustainable Development Insights from India,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7978652/,360

But it must be, and this film is the conduit. And the Band Played On is a faithful representation of the 1987 630-page book of the same name, written by journalist Randy Shilts. As an openly gay reporter for the San Francisco Chronicle, in a city that had the largest population of gay males at that time—roughly 17% of the city’s population was gay (KQED 2009), Shilts tracked the deadly pandemic from its first appearance around 1979 through the disease’s infancy and early childhood, signing off in 1987, when he completed the book. In “AIDS Years” 1987 was a timeframe that was considered a turning point in HIV/AIDS, when it finally began to be treated like a twentieth century infectious disease instead of a seventeenth century plague, and the year that azidothymidine (AZT), the first anti-retroviral medication for AIDS, was introduced. Shilts refrained from taking the HIV antibody test until he completed the book (60 min 1994); he tested positive and died of AIDS in 1994 at age 42, two years before protease inhibitors were discovered. His greatest contribution to society and medicine was writing down what occurred so that the tragic ethical violations and medical harms that characterized this time period can be taught to future generations of practitioners who now regard AIDS as casually as type 2 diabetes, and who may even see a cure for AIDS in their professional lifetime.","Rosenthal, M.

It was declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organization in 2020. In this chapter, a model for the detection of COVID-19 virus from CT chest medical images will be presented. The proposed model is based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), and a fine-tuned deep transfer learning model. GAN is used to generate more images from the available dataset. While deep transfer models are used to classify the COVID-19 virus from the normal class. The original dataset consists of 746 images. The is divided into two parts; 90% for the training and validation phase, while 10% for the testing phase. The 90% then is divided into 80% percent for the training and 20% percent for the validation after using GAN as image augmenter. The proposed GAN architecture raises the number of images in the training and validation phase to be 10 times larger than the original dataset. The deep transfer models which are selected for experimental trials are Resnet50, Shufflenet, and Mobilenet. They were selected as they include a medium number of layers on their architectures if they are com-pared with large deep transfer models such as DenseNet, and Inception-ResNet. This will reflect on the performance of the proposed model in terms of reducing training time, memory and CPU usage. The experimental trials show that Shufflenet is selected to be the optimal deep transfer learning in the proposed model as it achieves the highest possible for testing accuracy and performance metrics. Shufflenet achieves an overall testing accuracy with 84.9, and 85.33% in all performance metrics which include recall, precision, and F1 score.","Khalifa, Nour Eldeen M.; Taha, Mohamed Hamed N.; Hassanien, Aboul Ella; Taha, Sarah Hamed N.",Big Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence Against COVID-19: Innovation Vision and Approach,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7981023/,360

Nations have relied on various confidence building measures (CBMs) or the crisis management mechanisms (CMMs) at bilateral, regional as well as multilateral levels. The CBMs, perhaps have not been fully explored in the case of India and China, even if these have been in place or are being negotiated have not been fully examined. More often than not, the interaction is perceived to be an example of adhocism that has led to negativity between the two; a series of stand-offs in 2013, 2014, especially the Doklam and Galwan in 2017 and 2020 point to this and that these have been violated and interpreted according to one’s convenience. This paper aims at studying the cooperation and crisis of confidence building between India and China and their impact on the overall relations. The case study of 1991, 1996, 2005 and 2012 CBMs provides a base for the theoretical discussion. The findings have led to some assumptions through which we could explain the cooperation and crisis management in the context of India and China. It concludes that the cooperation and crisis of confidence building are determined by various variables such as internal and external factors; economic and political factors; asymmetrical force structure and the power shift in the global power structure.

50034,Three-Phase Model,2021-03-24,"In 2030, there are still three main activity areas that a Chief Human Resource Officer must take care of: (1) People and Talent Management, (2) Organization Design & Change, and (3) Management and Leadership of the HR department. While the tasks as such remain rather stable, there are significant changes in how they are done. The way these activities are performed is heavily influenced by technology that automatically processes data and communicates with humans. We delineate these changes in terms of the three Cs of Smart HRM that characterize HRM in 2030: “Conversational HR”, “Connected Robotics,” and “Controlled Analytics.” Together, these three Cs drive HR practices both in terms of efficiency as well as quality. We illustrate this by describing some use cases of the various technologies along the HR Value Chain. In addition, the three Cs produce another “C” as an unintended consequence: they corroborate a “Chasm between digital winners and digital losers”—and HR needs to address this divide.","Gärtner, Christian; Kern, Dieter",Managing Work in the Digital Economy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7983122/,360

We assume that the intensity process of the Hawkes driver coincides, up to a constant, with the variance process. By applying the theory of continuous-state branching processes with immigration, we prove existence and uniqueness of strong solutions of the SDE governing the asset price dynamics. We propose a measure change of self-exciting Esscher type in order to describe the relation between the risk-neutral and the historical dynamics, showing that the [Formula: see text] -OU Hawkes framework is stable under this probability change. By exploiting the affine features of the model we provide an explicit form for the Laplace transform of the asset log-return, for its quadratic variation and for the ergodic distribution of the variance process. We show that the proposed model exhibits a larger flexibility in comparison with the [Formula: see text] -OU model, in spite of the same number of parameters required. We calibrate the model on market vanilla option prices via characteristic function inversion techniques, we study the price sensitivities and propose an exact simulation scheme. The main financial achievement is that implied volatility of options written on VIX is upward shaped due to the self-exciting property of Hawkes processes, in contrast with the usual downward slope exhibited by the [Formula: see text] -OU Barndorff-Nielsen and Shephard model.","Bernis, Guillaume; Brignone, Riccardo; Scotti, Simone; Sgarra, Carlo",Math Finan Econ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7987553/,360

However, as the maritime business evolved, a change in the maritime education curriculum started to be necessary. To align maritime programmes with the needs of maritime stakeholders, maritime studies became an interdisciplinary academic field. Today, MET institutions juggle to comply with the Standard Training and Certificate Watch keeping (STCW) Convention and Code. However, it is also important to ensure that core subjects do not fade out under the integration of these new courses. As the emphasis on creating dedicated knowledge arises, students should be encouraged to participate on the researches conducted by their own centres through new participatory forms of web-based communication. This project has its origins in the research carried out by the Nautical Science and Engineering Department (DCEN) of the Barcelona School of Nautical Studies for the optimization of routes in the western Mediterranean. Through the analysis of the weather conditions in the western Mediterranean sailing area and, in particular, the most common adverse weather conditions in the area, a study of the impact of these weather conditions is carried on in the context of sea route optimization and their importance for short-haul transport. The results of the study are presented in participatory web format for dissemination and use as a didactic tool by the students; the routes studied will also be used as practical examples to explain the contents of the course in a clear and concise way. Through computer-supported collaborative learning, students will acquire lifelong skills and they will participate in the activities of their institution.","Martínez de Osés, F.

50301,Conclusion,2020-11-01,"This paper is a contribution to the comparative historical literature on the development of American and European federal macroeconomic government institutions, spawned by the 2010–12 Eurozone crisis. The literature has two major shortcomings, namely a lack of agreement on relevant periodization and a lack of causal explanations about the sources of the processes being compared. My claim is that the most relevant comparison is between the first half of the twentieth century for the USA and the period beginning in the 1980s for the European Union. The reason for this is the underlying and profound socio-economic process of the corporate reconstruction of American and European capitalisms, which I identify as the root cause of the development of federal macroeconomic government institutions in both polities.","Georgiou, Christakis",Comp Eur Polit,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7989686/,360
50327,Vertical Proliferation Challenges,2020-11-24,"If we want to become successful as an organization, we need to make continuous learning a cornerstone of the company culture. Only this way can we ensure the future of what we do and make sure that we can keep on innovating in a positive manner. Too many organizations get stuck in the way they are doing things and refuse to look outside of what they know. Knowledge and experience leads to new insights, and only if we continuously combine both external and internal information, we can keep on improving the performance of the organization. Education and learning are often seen as investments that don’t get proper return. Only by accepting that you have a continuous need of new knowledge can we make sure that we stay competitive, creative, and innovative. However, for most of you this will mean a real change in the way things are currently being done. Perhaps it is a good idea we go through the benefits for both the individual and the organization first, before we go into the details how we can make continuous learning a real part of the company culture. It is also because of this that continuous learning is a key component of what we call “the innovative organization” in Figure 6-1.","Hijfte, Stijn Van",Make Your Organization a Center of Innovation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7989882/,360

But our social contract is under threat. Governments and large corporations are today being tempted to abandon the ancient conventions of our social contract by the allure of emerging technology that promises the leaders of large corporations and institutions greater control over LIQUIDITY + DATA. It has traditionally been inaccessible because the digital integration required to create the market was not possible. People intermediated transactions and played an important role in safeguarding important conventions. Machines, however, do not always adopt our conventions. And a big question is, who really owns the data rights anyway? In the absence of concerted action by democracies, the nation the largest source of aggregate demand will set the global standards for the ownership rights of data released from silos by digital integration.

50947,"Austerity, Assistance and Institutions: Lessons from the Greek Sovereign Debt Crisis",2021-03-29,"Gastrointestinal carriage of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria is one of the main risk factors for developing serious, difficult-to-treat infections. Given that there is currently no all-round solution to eliminate colonization with MDR bacteria, it is particularly important to understand the dynamic process of colonization to aid the development of novel decolonization strategies. The aim of our present study was to perform metataxonomic analyses of gut microbiota dynamics during colonization with an extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)- and carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (ECKP) strain in mice; additionally, to ascertain the effects of antibiotic administration (ampicillin, ceftazidime, and ciprofloxacin) on the establishment and elimination of ECKP intestinal colonization. We have found that the phyla Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes were most dominant in all of the treatment groups; however, Bacteroidetes was more common in the groups treated with antibiotics compared to the control group. Significant differences were observed among the different antibiotic-treated groups in beta but not alpha diversity, implying that the difference is the relative abundance of some bacterial community members. Bacteria from the Lachnospiraceae family (including Agathobacter, Anaerostipes, Lachnoclostridium 11308, Lachnospiraceae UCG-004, Lachnospiraceae NK3A20 group 11318, Lachnospiraceae NK4A136 group 11319, Roseburia, and Tyzzerella) showed an inverse relationship with the carriage rate of the ECKP strain, whereas members of Enterobacteriaceae and the ECKP strain have shown a correlational relationship. Our results suggest that the composition of the microbial community plays a primary role in the MDR-colonization rate, whereas the antibiotic susceptibility of individual MDR strains affects this process to a lesser extent. Distinct bacterial families have associated into microbial clusters, collecting taxonomically close species to produce survival benefits in the gut. These associations do not develop at random, as they may be attributed to the presence of specific metabolomic networks. A new concept should be introduced in designing future endeavors for MDR decolonization, supplemented by knowledge of the composition of the host bacterial community and the identification of bacterial clusters capable of suppressing or enhancing the invader species.","Juhász, János; Ligeti, Balázs; Gajdács, Márió; Makra, Nóra; Ostorházi, Eszter; Farkas, Ferenc Balázs; Stercz, Balázs; Tóth, Ákos; Domokos, Judit; Pongor, Sándor; Szabó, Dóra",Antibiotics (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8001907/,360

As an advanced chemometrics tool, multi-way analysis shows great potential for solving a wide range of food problems and analyzing complex spectroscopic data. This paper describes the representative multi-way models which were used for analyzing NIRS data, as well as the advances, advantages and limitations of different multi-way models. The applications of multi-way analysis in NIRS for the food industry in terms of food process control, quality evaluation and fraud, identification and classification, prediction and quantification, and image analysis are also reviewed. It is evident from this report that multi-way analysis is presently an attractive tool for modeling complex NIRS data in the food industry while its full potential is far from reached. The combination of multi-way analysis with NIRS will be a promising practice for turning food data information into operational knowledge, conducting reliable food analyses and improving our understanding about food systems and food processes.

We therefore evaluated the effect of COVID-19 on rates of compliance with recommended post-injury follow-up. We hypothesized that this isolation may lead to detrimental effects on adherence to proper follow-up for children with burn injuries. METHODS: We queried the registry at an ABA-verified Level 1 pediatric burn center for patients aged 0–14 years who were treated and released from March 30 to July 31, 2020, which represents the height of the pandemic. As a control, we searched the registry for patients treated during the same time frame from 2016 to 2019. Patient and clinical factors were compared between the COVID and pre-COVID cohorts. Predictors of follow-up were compared using chi-squared and Kruskal-Wallis tests. Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate for predictors of compliance with follow-up. RESULTS: A total of 401 patients were seen and discharged from the pediatric ED for burn injuries. The COVID cohort consisted of 58 (14.5%) of these patients. Burn characteristics and demographic patterns did not differ between the COVID and pre-COVID cohorts. Demographics, including age, gender, race, and ethnicity did not differ between patients with 2-week follow-up and those without. The rate of compliance with 2-week follow-up was also not affected (62.4% prior to COVID vs. 55.2% during, p=0.29). As expected, burn size, burn depth, and mechanism of injury all significantly predicted compliance with 2-week follow up (table 1). After adjusting for these variables, there was still no difference in the odds of appropriate follow up (OR 0.6, 95% CI 0.3 – 1.1; p=0.12). CONCLUSIONS: Despite concerns about decreased access to healthcare during the pandemic, the experience at our Level 1 pediatric burn center, including rates of follow-up for those managed as outpatients, appears unchanged.

Subspecialty consultative resources to help front-line clinicians treat these conditions is often limited. We implemented a “Virtual Hyperglycemia Surveillance Service (VHSS)” to guide glucose management in COVID19 patients admitted to our 1541-bed academic medical center. From April 22 to June 9, 2020, hospitalized adult patients with COVID19 and 2 or more blood glucose (BG) values greater than 250 mg/dl over 24-h were identified using a daily BG report. The VHSS reviewed BGs and treatment plans, then made recommendations for future glycemic management via a one-time note, visible to all providers. Some patients with re-admission or persistently elevated BG after 1 week received a second VHSS note. We compared BGs from 24-h pre- and 72-h post-intervention starting at 6AM on the day following VHSS review. We also evaluated for hypoglycemia, insulin infusion use and use of formal diabetes consults. A subgroup analysis was performed on patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). At the end of the intervention, we identified a retrospective control cohort admitted to the same hospital from March 21 to April 21, 2020 who met the inclusion criteria for a VHSS assessment. The VHSS group consisted of 100 patients with 126 individual VHSS encounters, and the control group comprised 50 patients. Baseline characteristics in the VHSS and control groups, respectively, were: mean age 62.5 vs 62.1 years, % male 58 vs 56, mean weight 91.4 vs 93.4 kg, BMI 31.8 vs 33.0 kg/m(2), and HbA1c 9.1 vs 8.8 %. There were fewer patients in the ICU in the VHSS than control group (44% vs 66%). In the VHSS group, mean BG pre- vs. post-intervention was 260.3 ±21.7 and 227.4 ±25.3 mg/dl (p<0.001). In the control group, mean BG pre-and post- the day they met assessment criteria was 264.8 ± 6.5 mg/dl and 250.6 ± 8.6 mg/dl (p=0.18). There was no difference in the use of insulin infusions or diabetes consults between the two groups. More hypoglycemia (BG<70 mg/dl) occurred in the VHSS than control group (8.3% vs 0%, p=0.04). Within the VHSS group, the average change in BG was significantly greater in ICU than non-ICU patients (-51.8 ±8.7 vs -19.6 ±5.0 mg/dl, p<0.01) and the reduction in the % of BG over 250 mg/dl was also significantly greater in the ICU (-32.2% vs -16.8%, p=0.02). Implementation of a single virtual consult for severely hyperglycemic hospitalized COVID19 patients was associated with rapidly reduced BG concentrations, especially in the ICU. The mean reduction in BG with VHSS intervention was more than 2-fold greater than that observed in our control group. Glucose control remained suboptimal, however, suggesting the need for subsequent input from this specialty service.","Athonvarangkul, Diana; Gunawan, Felona; Nagel, Kathryn; Bak, Leigh; Herold, Kevan C; Hwang, Janice Jin; Jastreboff, Ania M; Kibbey, Richard; Shulman, Gerald I; Vatner, Daniel; Alausa, Jameel; Subair, Labeebah; Inzucchi, Silvio E",J Endocr Soc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8089507/,360

A consultant led VSC is held weekly to review the database and follow-up patients virtually. METHOD: Analysis of patients added over a 15-month period was performed. Outcomes included spontaneous stone passage rates, intervention rates and time from initial imaging to VSC outcomes. RESULTS: 615 patients with a median age of 48 years were analysed. Emergency referrals to urology accounted for 85.9% of data. VSC review occurred a median of 5 days after initial imaging. Majority of stones were lower ureteric (64.6%), 28.1% upper ureteric and 7.2% renal stones. Follow up data was available for 557 patients (90.6%). 73.6% of patients passed stones spontaneously. Median time from investigation to imaging was 21 days. 372 patients were discharged following VSC review. 111 patients were listed for surgical intervention. Median time to intervention was 21 days for ESWL, 62 days for ureteroscopy and 202 days for PCNL. CONCLUSIONS: VSC leads to shorter waiting times for follow-up imaging and interventions in patients with renal stone disease.

The study aims to identify contributing factors in order to minimise future risk to patients and staff. METHOD: A single-site retrospective cohort study including all T&O patients who underwent surgery with confirmed peri-operative COVID-19 infection. The primary outcome was 30-day mortality. Exposures investigated included diagnostic timing and theatre designation. RESULTS: 92% of participants were not tested pre-operatively. 75% met the criteria for hospital acquired COVID-19. Only 2 patients were operated on in designated COVID-19 theatres. Two lists accounted for 50% of the T&O COVID-positive patients. Remaining patients on both lists were discharged without further testing. Local 30-day mortality rate (25%) was in line with the findings of the international COVIDSurg Study (23.8%). No further COVID-positive T&O cases identified since the introduction of blanket admission swabbing. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients did not meet criteria for pre-operative testing. Thus, were not operated on in appropriately designated theatres despite unknown COVID status, increasing risk of cross-contamination.

This study aimed to identify and externally validate PPC risk prediction models in an international, prospective cohort. METHOD: A systematic review was conducted to identify risk prediction models for PPC following abdominal surgery. External validation was performed using data from a prospective dataset of adult patients undergoing major abdominal surgery from January to April 2019 in the UK, Ireland, and Australia. The primary outcome was identification of PPC within 30-days (StEP-COMPAC criteria definition). Model discrimination and diagnostic accuracy were compared. RESULTS: Six unique risk prediction models were eligible from 2819 records (112 full texts). These were validated across 11,591 patients, with an overall PPC rate of 7.8% (n = 903). The Assess Respiratory Risk in Surgical Patients in Catalonia (ARISCAT) score provided the best discrimination (AUROC: 0.709 (95% CI: 0.692-0.727), yet no risk prediction model demonstrated good discrimination (AUROC >0.7). CONCLUSIONS: The risk of PPC for patients following major abdominal surgery in the pre-covid era is not well described by existing prediction tools. New prediction tools are required to account for additional variation introduced for patients affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection.",,Br J Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8135940/,360

The overconsumption of antibiotics in general medicine, veterinary, or agriculture has led to a spike in drug-resistant microorganisms; obtaining standardized results is imposed by standard definitions for various categories of drug-resistant bacteria—such as multiple-drug resistant (MDR), extensive drug-resistant (XDR), and pan drug-resistant (PDR). This retrospective study conducted in three university teaching hospitals in Romania has analyzed urine probes from 15,231 patients, of which 698 (4.58%) presented multidrug-resistant strains. Escherichia coli was the leading uropathogen 283 (40.54%), presenting the highest resistance to quinolones (R = 72.08%) and penicillin (R = 66.78%) with the most important patterns of resistance for penicillin, sulfonamides, and quinolones (12.01%) and aminoglycosides, aztreonam, cephalosporins, and quinolones (9.89%). Klebsiella spp. followed—260 (37.24%) with the highest resistance to amoxicillin-clavulanate (R = 94.61%) and cephalosporins (R = 94.23%); the leading patterns were observed for aminoglycosides, aminopenicillins + β-lactams inhibitor, sulfonamides, and cephalosporins (12.69%) and aminoglycosides, aztreonam, cephalosporins, quinolones (9.23%). The insufficient research of MDR strains on the Romanian population is promoting these findings as an important tool for any clinician treating MDR-UTIs.","Petca, Răzvan-Cosmin; Negoiță, Silvius; Mareș, Cristian; Petca, Aida; Popescu, Răzvan-Ionuț; Chibelean, Călin Bogdan",Antibiotics (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8147389/,360
53714,"DREAMS: dromen van grote, systematisch verzamelde datasets",2021-06-07,"Early-life sleep deprivation (ESD) is a serious condition with severe cognitive sequelae. Considering hippocampus plays an essential role in cognitive regulation, the present study aims to determine whether melatonin, a neuroendocrine beard with significant anti-oxidative activity, would greatly depress the hippocampal oxidative stress, improves the molecular machinery, and consequently exerts the neuro-protective effects following ESD. Male weanling Wistar rats (postnatal day 21) were subjected to ESD for three weeks. During this period, the animals were administered normal saline or melatonin (10 mg/kg) via intraperitoneal injection between 09:00 and 09:30 daily. After three cycles of ESD, the animals were kept under normal sleep/wake cycle until they reached adulthood and were sacrificed. The results indicated that ESD causes long-term effects, such as impairment of ionic distribution, interruption of the expressions of neurotransmitters and receptors, decreases in the levels of several antioxidant enzymes, and impairment of several signaling pathways, which contribute to neuronal death in hippocampal regions. Melatonin administration during ESD prevented these effects. Quantitative evaluation of cells also revealed a higher number of neurons in the melatonin-treated animals when compared with the saline-treated animals. As the hippocampus is critical to cognitive activity, preserving or even improving the hippocampal molecular machinery by melatonin during ESD not only helps us to better understand the underlying mechanisms of ESD-induced neuronal dysfunction, but also the therapeutic use of melatonin to counteract ESD-induced neuronal deficiency.","Chang, Hung-Ming; Lin, Hsing-Chun; Cheng, Hsin-Lin; Liao, Chih-Kai; Tseng, To-Jung; Renn, Ting-Yi; Lan, Chyn-Tair; Chen, Li-You",Antioxidants (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8153000/,360
54226,P613 Social Media Analytics for Inflammatory Bowel Disease – What Are We Missing?,2021-05-27,"BACKGROUND: Burnout is defined as a syndrome resulting from chronic workplace stress that has not been successfully managed. It is characterised by feelings of energy depletion or exhaustion, increased mental distance from one’s job and reduced professional efficacy. The COVID-19 pandemic has created unexpected demands on healthcare systems worldwide and they have experienced numerous stressors. As the coping is one of the stressors management strategies that may affect burnout, this is a descriptive cross-sectional study aimed to estimate the frequency and level of burnout and its association with coping strategies among physicians and nurses in Saudi Arabia during the COVID-19 Pandemic using Copenhagen Burnout Inventory and Brief-COPE. RESULTS: Overall, 403 healthcare providers were recruited (85 physicians, 318 nurses). Personal, work-related and client-related burnout were detected among 67.5%, 68% and 58.3% of the respondents, respectively. The mean score for adaptive coping was (27.6 ± 10.3, median: 29 IQR: 14.0) out of 48, and the mean score for maladaptive coping was (14.2 ± 6.81, median: 14 IQR: 8.0) out of 36. Some factors associated with burnout were participants’ age group, professional position, number of family members and years of experience in the medical field. The personal, work-related and client-related burnout had inverse correlations with the overall adaptive coping category. CONCLUSION: The frequency of burnout during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly among nurses, was significant. Burnout was also frequent among both the younger age group and those with fewer years of experience. Some predictors were identified as having a close person infected with COVID-19, being assigned to treat COVID-19 patients, longer working hours, having sleeping hours affected by the pandemic and experiencing verbal or physical abuse from patients. In addition to a significant correlation between the adaptive coping category and the three burnout dimensions.","AlJhani, Sumayah; AlHarbi, Hatim; AlJameli, Shahad; Hameed, Lama; AlAql, Khozama; Alsulaimi, Mohammed",Middle East Curr Psychiatry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8189724/,360
54308,Does economic policy uncertainty matter to explain connectedness within the international sovereign bond yields?,2021-06-11,"The aseptic trauma of peripheral surgery activates a systemic inflammatory response that results in neuro-inflammation; the microglia, the resident immunocompetent cells in the brain, are a key element of the neuroinflammatory response. In most settings microglia perform a surveillance role in the brain detecting and responding to “invaders” to maintain homeostasis. However, microglia have also been implicated in producing harm possibly by changing its phenotype from its beneficial, anti-inflammatory state (termed M2) into an injurious pro-inflammatory state (termed M1); it is likely that there are intermediates states between these polar phenotypes and some consider that a gradient exists with a number of intermediates, rather than a strict dichotomy between M1 and M2. In the pro-inflammatory phenotypes, microglia can disrupt synaptic plasticity such as long- term potentiation that can result in disorders of learning and memory of the type observed in Peri-operative Neurocognitive Disorders. Therefore, investigators have sought strategies to prevent microglia from provoking this adverse event in the perioperative period. In preclinical studies microglia can be depleted by removing trophic factors required for its maintenance; subsequent repopulation with a more beneficial microglial phenotype may result in memory enhancement, improved sensory motor function, as well as suppression of neuroinflammatory and oxidative stress pathways. Another approach consists of preventing microglial activation using the non-specific P38 MAP kinase blockers such as minocycline. Perhaps a more physiologic approach is the use of inhibitors of potassium (K(+)) channels that are required to convert the microglia into an active state. In this context the specific K(+) channels that are implicated are termed Kv1.3 and KCa3.1 and high selective inhibitors for each have been developed. Data are accumulating demonstrating the utility of these K(+) channel blockers in preventing Perioperative Neurocognitive Disorders.","Saxena, Sarah; Kruys, Veronique; Vamecq, Joseph; Maze, Mervyn",Front Aging Neurosci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8193130/,360
54360,Effects of sponsorship quality and quantity on employee brand behavior,2021-06-14,"BACKGROUND: There is an ongoing concern over the impact of COVID-19 on IBD patients. A significant proportion of IBD patients are treated with immunosuppressive medications and their effects on COVID-19 susceptibility and outcomes remain of concern to patients and physicians alike. Apart from the clinical outcome, the pandemic may have other psychosocial effects on this vulnerable cohort such as employment stability. The primary aim of this study was to analyze the percentage of COVID-19 patients who tested themselves for COVID-19 and the outcome of those who tested positive. A secondary aim was to assess their employment status. METHODS: This was a multicentre international study whereby IBD patients (>18 years) in clinical remission over the last year, were asked to answer an anonymous questionnaire. Demographic data, type of IBD, current and previous medication, admissions to hospital, were collected. Exclusion criteria included patients with IBD flares requiring corticosteroids in the previous 12 months. RESULTS: 573 patients (CD: 55.5%) from 8 European Centres and Israel participated in the study. The mean patient age was 39.9 years (SD+/- 13.0). 21.6% were current smokers and 48.5% were non-smokers. The rest were ex-smokers. 44.5% (n=255 ) of patients were tested for Covid-19 and 5.1% (n=13) were positive. The majority were treated at home (92.3%) with only one patient requiring hospital admission. This was a 33 year old female smoker with UC (E3 disease activity) on anti-TNF therapy. 66.7% of positive cases were on anti-TNF medication and 22.2% were on thiopurines. None of the positive cases were on dual antiTNF/thiopurine therapy. 7.2% of patients had family members who also tested positive for Covid-19. Almost half of all patients (45.2%) had their job affected during the pandemic and this was more prevalent in the UC cohort (P<0.05). 70% of patients switched to remote work from home and 21.4% became unemployed. The average age of patients becoming unemployed was 39.3years (SD+/- 11.9). [Image: see text] [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: Nearly half of our cohort (45.2%) underwent testing and the majority (92.3%) were treated at home even though two thirds of them were on Anti-TNF medication. Unemployment rates affected 1 in 5 individuals and measures promoting remote work have been taken up wisely by IBD patients. Though the clinical outcomes were excellent, the psychological effects of unemployment have yet to be considered.","Sciberras, M; Nascimento, C; Tabone, T; Karmiris, K; Nikolaou, P; Theodoropoulou, A; Mula, A; Goren, I; Yanai, H; Amir, H; Mantzaris, G; Georgiadi, T; Foteinogiannopoulou, K; Koutroubakis, I; Allocca, M; Fiorino, G; Furfaro, F; Katsanos, K H; Fousekis, F; Michalopoulos, G; Torres, J; Ellul, P",J Crohns Colitis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8194632/,360

Immune eradication of cancer cells is dependent on polymorphisms of HLA class I molecules and antigen-processing machinery (APM) components. We have already published highly significant associations of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the ERAP1 gene with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in Chinese, but not in Polish populations. However, the smoking status of participants was not known in the previous study. Here, we compared the distribution of APM polymorphic variants in larger cohorts of Polish patients with NSCLC and controls, stratified according to their smoking status. We found significant but opposite associations in never-smokers and in smokers of all tested SNPs (rs26653, rs2287987, rs30187, and rs27044) but one (rs26618) in ERAP1. No significant associations were seen in other genes. Haplotype analysis indicated that the distribution of many ERAP1/2 haplotypes is opposite, depending on smoking status. Additionally, haplotypic combination of low activity ERAP1 and the lack of an active form of ERAP2 seems to favor the disease in never-smokers. We also revealed interesting associations of some APM polymorphisms with: age at diagnosis (ERAP1 rs26653), disease stage (ERAP1 rs27044, PSMB9 rs17587), overall survival (ERAP1 rs30187), and response to chemotherapy (ERAP1 rs27044). The results presented here may suggest the important role for ERAP1 in the anti-cancer response, which is different in smokers versus never-smokers, depending to some extent on the presence of ERAP2, and affecting NSCLC clinical course.","Wiśniewski, Andrzej; Sobczyński, Maciej; Pawełczyk, Konrad; Porębska, Irena; Jasek, Monika; Wagner, Marta; Niepiekło-Miniewska, Wanda; Kowal, Aneta; Dubis, Joanna; Jędruchniewicz, Natalia; Kuśnierczyk, Piotr",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8212834/,360

The current state of cross-national surveys makes it difficult to address the new theoretical concerns due to (1) lack of theoretically relevant variables, (2) lack of longitudinal data to track historical changes in non-religious positions, and (3) difficulties in accessing small and/or hardly reachable sub-populations of religious nones.

Through a number of potential benefits, including improvements to the implant–bone interface and surgical workflow, PSIs aim to improve patient and surgical outcomes, as well as potentially provide new avenues for combating challenges routinely faced by spinal surgeons. However, obstacles to widespread acceptance and routine application include the lack of quality long-term data, research challenges and the practicalities of production and navigating the regulatory environment. While recognition of the significant potential of Spinal PSIs is evident in the literature, it is clear a number of key questions must be answered to inform future clinical and research practices. The spinal surgical community must selectively and ethically continue to offer PSIs to patients, simultaneously allowing for the necessary larger, comparative studies to be conducted, as well as continuing to provide optimal patient care, thereby ultimately determining the exact role of this technology and potentially improving outcomes.","Amin, Tajrian; Parr, William C.H.; Mobbs, Ralph J.",J Pers Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8228233/,360

Symptoms of COVID‐19 range from mild to severe, including respiratory symptoms, systemic inflammatory responses, and even death. Currently, remdesivir is the only FDA‐approved therapeutic agent to treat COVID‐19, although it shows limited efficacy. We were interested in learning about the drug design process for a novel virus. We focused on drug research targeting the SARS‐CoV‐2 main protease, known as nsp5 or Mpro. The nsp5 protease is an enzyme critical for viral replication, with ebselen, cinanserin, and N3 being lead compounds identified as possible effective drugs (Jin, 2020). Starting with these chemical drug structures, we used an in silico drug design process to explore how to modify and refine these drugs. Our goal was to make the compounds more drug‐like, according to Lipinski's and Veber's rules. Using the crystal structure file 6YB7 from the Protein Data Bank (PDB), we focused on the protease active site, defined by amino acids His41, Met49, Asn142, Cys145, His164, Met165, Glu166, Pro168, and Gln189. Cys145 is especially important, as it is the target for irreversible covalent inhibitors. Based on this information, we used molecular docking software to first re‐dock these drugs into the nsp5 protease. We then made changes to the structures of the lead compounds, docked those new compounds, and used the energetic information to continue the refinement process. Once we completed our own drug design explorations, we created a three‐dimensional printed model of the full nsp5 protease, with the key amino acids highlighted. We also created a three‐dimensional model zoomed in on the active site, with the different drugs fitting into that active site model. Here, we present what we learned about the drug design process for a novel virus such as SARS‐CoV‐2. Our docking protocols and models are useful for teaching the fundamentals of drug design and about modern drug discovery and design processes.","Dencklau, Dalton; Evertsen, Michel; Juhler, Isabelle; Larson, Kallista; Pinos, Alexa; Rothfus, Jesse; Hall, Bonnie",FASEB J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8239509/,360

Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, extensively explored as clinical agents for COVID‐19, have multiple cellular effects including alkalizing lysosomes and blocking autophagy as well as exhibiting dose‐limiting toxicities in patients. To identify an alternative lysosome‐based drug repurposing opportunity we evaluated additional lysosomotropic compounds . We found that six of these compounds blocked the cytopathic effect of SARS‐CoV‐2 in Vero E6 cells with half‐maximal effective concentration (EC50) values ranging from 2.0 to 13 μM and selectivity indices (SIs; SI = CC50/EC50) ranging from 1.5‐ to >10‐fold. We demonstrate how the compounds (1) blocked lysosome functioning and autophagy, (2) prevented pseudotyped particle entry, (3) increased lysosomal pH, and (4) that ROC‐325 reduced viral titers in the EpiAirway 3D tissue model. Consistent with these findings, the siRNA knockdown of ATP6V0D1 blocked the HCoV‐NL63 cytopathic effect in LLC‐MK2 cells. Moreover, an analysis of SARS‐CoV‐2 infected Vero E6 cell lysate revealed significant dysregulation of autophagy and lysosomal function, suggesting a contribution of the lysosome to the life cycle of SARS‐CoV‐2.

The analysis indicates that the prevalence of infectious diseases has an economically and statistically significant negative effect on nonfinancial corporate performance. This adverse impact is particularly pronounced on smaller and younger firms, compared to larger and more established corporations. We also find that a higher number of infectious‐disease cases in the population increases the probability of failure among nonfinancial firms, particularly for small and young firms. In the case of COVID‐19, the magnitude of these effects will be much greater, given the unprecedented scale of the outbreak and strict policy responses to contain its spread.","Cevik, Serhan; Miryugin, Fedor",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8242456/,360

Given the fear and uncertainty generated by the COVID‐19 pandemic, there exists a pervasive activation of the sympathetic nervous system in the community. In this article, I present two case studies as examples of a cross‐cultural/cross‐linguistic approach that facilitates two clients to find a place of comfort and calmness and consequently a balancing activation of the para‐sympathetic nervous system. First is a client who, due to the overwhelming pandemic chaos, suddenly exhibited a host of signs and symptoms of a functional neurological nature, which she experienced as a lack of control and disconnection from her body, her primary language, and herself. Within a trusted therapeutic relationship that draws on the culture and primary language of the therapist, the client regains connection with language and enhances her ability to communicate and connect with her body. Second is an international student who is encouraged to use her culture of origin and primary language to induce calmness, reconnect with herself, and return to the familiar as a ‘known’ collectively inclusive, comforting, and nurturing environment.","Amorin‐Woods, Deisy",Aust N Z J Fam Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8251485/,360
55584,The coronavirus crisis as tipping point: communicating the environment in a time of pandemic,2020-11-11,"This study investigates different instructional designs to promote students’ collective cognitive responsibility for Knowledge Building in blended university courses. Using an iterative, design-based research methodology with reference to the conjecture mapping technique, the blended learning design of an undergraduate educational psychology course was refined over three years in three design iterations. The iterations differed substantially in the embodiment of the Concurrent Embedded and Transformative Assessment Knowledge Building principle that engaged students in knowledge assessments and strategy assessments of their community’s work. The design of the knowledge assessment involved face-to-face small group and whole class discussions in all three iterations. In the first and second iterations, students also worked online by writing individual reflections and contributing to a community portfolio. The design of the strategy assessment changed in each iteration. In the first iteration, the students’ strategy assessment took place in face-to-face discussions; in the second iteration, students contributed to an online community portfolio; and in the third iteration, the strategy assessment took place in an online community portfolio and face-to-face discussions before beginning the course and in the online community portfolio in the middle of the course. Collective cognitive responsibility was analyzed in terms of productive and informative participation, interdependence between participants, self-regulation skills. The results show that the second iteration’s design was most effective for fostering the students' collective cognitive responsibility, showing an increase in productive participation and self-regulation skills in the first part of the course and also an increase in the interdependence of participants during the course. Some implications concerning the relationship between the implementation of the CETA principle and Knowledge Building are identified for future directions of inquiry and for blended learning environments design.","Cacciamani, Stefano; Perrucci, Vittore; Fujita, Nobuko",Tech Know Learn,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8254631/,360
55586,"Extraordinary issue: Coronavirus, crisis and communication",2020-11-11,"Low latency and high availability of resources are essential characteristics to guarantee the quality of services in health systems. Hospital systems must be efficient to prevent loss of human life. Smart hospitals promise a health revolution by capturing and transmitting patient data to doctors in real-time via a wireless sensor network. However, there is a significant difficulty in assessing the performance and availability of such systems in real contexts due to failures not being tolerated and high implementation costs. This paper adopts analytical models to assess the performance and availability of intelligent hospital systems without having to invest in real equipment beforehand. Two Stochastic Petri Net models were proposed to represent intelligent hospital architectures. One model is used to assess performance, and another to assess availability. The models are pretty parametric, making it possible to calibrate the resources, service times, times between failures, and times between repairs. The availability model, for example, allows you to define 48 parameters, allowing you to evaluate a large number of scenarios. The analysis showed that the arrival rate in the performance model is an impacting parameter. It was possible to observe the close relationship between MRT, resource utilization, and discard rate in different scenarios, especially for high arrival rates. Three scenarios were explored considering the second model. The highest availability results were observed in scenario A, composed of server redundancy (local and remote). Such scenario—with redundancy—presented an availability of 99.9199%, that is, 7.01 h/year of inactivity. In addition, this work presents a sensitivity analysis that identifies the most critical components of the architecture. Therefore, this work can help hospital system administrators plan more optimized architectures according to their needs.","Rodrigues, Laécio; Gonçalves, Igor; Fé, Iure; Endo, Patricia Takako; Silva, Francisco Airton",Computing,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8254637/,360

56450,Fiscal Stimulus: Lessons From the US to the EU?,2021-08-05,"BACKGROUND: Cognitive immunisation against disconfirmatory evidence (i.e., devaluing expectation-disconfirming information through cognitive mechanisms) has recently been discussed as an obstacle to the revision of dysfunctional beliefs in mental disorders such as depression. Yet, it is unclear whether cognitive immunisation is also involved in belief updating in non-clinical samples. METHODS: Using a three-group modulation protocol (promotion vs. inhibition of cognitive immunisation vs. control group), we examined how cognitive immunisation influences belief updating in response to performance feedback in three non-clinical samples. In Experiments 1 (N = 99) and 2 (N = 93), participants received unexpectedly negative feedback, whereas participants from Experiment 3 (N = 118) received unexpectedly positive feedback. Depressive symptoms and dispositional optimism were examined as additional predictors of belief updating. RESULTS: In all experiments, participants adjusted their expectations in line with the feedback received, but this effect was not influenced by the cognitive immunisation manipulation. In Experiment 3, expectation change remained stable over 2 weeks. Depressive symptoms were associated with a reduced integration of positive feedback, but not with an increased sensitivity to negative feedback. CONCLUSIONS: Whereas previous research has shown that cognitive immunisation contributes to persistent beliefs in clinical populations, the present findings suggest that it does not affect belief updating in non-clinical samples.

56453,Fuelling fire sales? Prudential regulation and crises: evidence from the Italian market,2021-08-05,"BACKGROUND: The critical role of vascular health on brain function has received much attention in recent years. At the single-cell level, studies on the developmental processes of cerebral vascular growth are still relatively few. Techniques for constructing gene regulatory networks (GRNs) based on single-cell transcriptome expression data have made significant progress in recent years. Herein, we constructed a single-cell transcriptional regulatory network of mouse cerebrovascular cells. METHODS: The single-cell RNA-seq dataset of mouse brain vessels was downloaded from GEO (GSE98816). This cell clustering was annotated separately using singleR and CellMarker. We then used a modified version of the SCENIC method to construct GRNs. Next, we used a mouse version of SEEK to assess whether genes in the regulon were coexpressed. Finally, regulatory module analysis was performed to complete the cell type relationship quantification. RESULTS: Single-cell RNA-seq data were used to analyze the heterogeneity of mouse cerebrovascular cells, whereby four cell types including endothelial cells, fibroblasts, microglia, and oligodendrocytes were defined. These subpopulations of cells and marker genes together characterize the molecular profile of mouse cerebrovascular cells. Through these signatures, key transcriptional regulators that maintain cell identity were identified. Our findings identified genes like Lmo2, which play an important role in endothelial cells. The same cell type, for instance, fibroblasts, was found to have different regulatory networks, which may influence the functional characteristics of local tissues. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, a transcriptional regulatory network based on single-cell analysis was constructed. Additionally, the study identified and profiled mouse cerebrovascular cells using single-cell transcriptome data as well as defined TFs that affect the regulatory network of the mouse brain vasculature.","Lin, Wei-Wei; Xu, Lin-Tao; Chen, Yi-Sheng; Go, Ken; Sun, Chenyu; Zhu, Yong-Jian",Biomed Res Int,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8324343/,360

56633,The emerging community planning in the super-blocks of New Belgrade,2021-08-09,"With the increase of wounds and body damage, the clinical demand for antibacterial, hemostatic, and repairable biomaterials is increasing. Various types of biomedical materials have become research hotspots. Of these, and among materials derived from marine organisms, the research and application of alginate, chitosan, and collagen are the most common. Chitosan is mainly used as a hemostatic material in clinical applications, but due to problems such as the poor mechanical strength of a single component, the general antibacterial ability, and fast degradation speed research into the extraction process and modification mainly focuses on the improvement of the above-mentioned ability. Similarly, the research and modification of sodium alginate, used as a material for hemostasis and the repair of wounds, is mainly focused on the improvement of cell adhesion, hydrophilicity, degradation speed, mechanical properties, etc.; therefore, there are fewer marine biological collagen products. The research mainly focuses on immunogenicity removal and mechanical performance improvement. This article summarizes the source, molecular structure, and characteristics of alginate, chitosan, and collagen from marine organisms; and introduces the biological safety, clinical efficacy, and mechanism of action of these materials, as well as their extraction processes and material properties.

BACKGROUND: Patients with heart failure in the setting of COVID-19 requiring admission to the intensive care unit may present a set of unique challenges. There is limited data to describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes in this subset of the patient population. PURPOSE: The study""s purpose was to extensively describe the characteristics and outcomes of heart failure patients admitted to the intensive care unit with COVID-19 compared to non-heart failure patients . METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, prospective analysis for all adult critically ill patients with heart failure admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) between March 1 to August 31, 2020, with an objectively confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of 723 critically ill patients with COVID-19 had been admitted in ICUs, 59 patients with heart failure, and 664 patients with no heart failure before ICU admission. Heart failure patients had significantly more comorbid conditions such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and acute coronary syndrome. Higher baseline severity scores (APACHE II & SOFA score) and nutritional risk (NUTRIC Score) were observed in heart failure patients. Also, heart failure patients had more acute kidney injury during ICU admission and required more mechanical ventilation within 24 hours of ICU admission. Patients with heart failure had a similar incidence of thrombosis compared to patients with no heart failure. Critically ill patients with COVID-19 and heart failure had similar ICU length of stay (LOS), mechanical ventilation duration, and hospital LOS compared to patients with no heart failure. During ICU stay, patients with heart failure had more in-hospital and ICU deaths in comparison to the non-heart failure group (64.3% vs. 44.6%, P-value <0.01) and (54.5% vs. 39%, P-value = 0.02) respectively. CONCLUSION: In this observational study evaluating the clinical characteristics and outcomes of critically ill COVID-19 patients with heart failure, patients with COVID-19 and heart failure had similar ICU LOS, duration of MV and hospital LOS, thrombosis rate compared to patients with no heart failure. However, during ICU stay, patients with heart failure had more in-hospital and ICU deaths than the non-heart failure group.","Badreldin, H; Hafidh, DR; Bin Saleh, DR; Al Sulaiman, DR; Al Juhani, DR; Alharbi, DR; Alanazi, DR; Almujarri, MS; Alobathani, MS; Al Harbi, MR; Al Harbi, DR",Eur J Cardiovasc Nurs,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8344549/,360

A mediation model,2021-08-16,"Biological systems can be modeled and described by biological networks. Biological networks are typical complex networks with widely real-world applications. Many problems arising in biological systems can be boiled down to the identification of important nodes. For example, biomedical researchers frequently need to identify important genes that potentially leaded to disease phenotypes in animal and explore crucial genes that were responsible for stress responsiveness in plants. To facilitate the identification of important nodes in biological systems, one needs to know network structures or behavioral data of nodes (such as gene expression data). If network topology was known, various centrality measures can be developed to solve the problem; while if only behavioral data of nodes were given, some sophisticated statistical methods can be employed. This paper reviewed some of the recent works on statistical identification of important nodes in biological systems from three aspects, that is, 1) in general complex networks based on complex networks theory and epidemic dynamic models; 2) in biological networks based on network motifs; and 3) in plants based on RNA-seq data. The identification of important nodes in a complex system can be seen as a mapping from the system to the ranking score vector of nodes, such mapping is not necessarily with explicit form. The three aspects reflected three typical approaches on ranking nodes in biological systems and can be integrated into one general framework. This paper also proposed some challenges and future works on the related topics. The associated investigations have potential real-world applications in the control of biological systems, network medicine and new variety cultivation of crops.","Wang, Pei",J Syst Sci Complex,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8353063/,360

From the perspective of Self-Determination Theory, changes in social context interact with the satisfaction or frustration of basic psychological needs and, as a result, with study-related motivational regulation and vitality. In this study, we investigate the relationships between the contextual factors of online-based distance learning, basic psychological needs, forms of motivational regulation and subjective vitality in a sample of N = 1849 university students across eight universities in Austria and Germany. Based on structural equational modelling, the results stress the relevance of satisfaction with technological resources in regard to higher levels of satisfaction in all three basic psychological needs, while perceived overload is linked to lower levels of needs satisfaction and increased basic psychological needs frustration. Further, the estimated workload difference before and during the pandemic is not related to the motivational outcomes of the model. All relationships have been tested for mediation effects between basic psychological needs and the different forms of motivational regulation on subjective vitality: for the need for relatedness, no mediation is found, while the effect of the need for autonomy is fully mediated by autonomous regulation styles. The need for competence was associated with several mediating interactions with regulation styles. The results offer insight into students’ perceptions of their study-related experiences during the pandemic and can help to develop effective methods in online-based and blended learning settings in the future.","Martinek, Daniela; Carmignola, Matteo; Müller, Florian H.; Bieg, Sonja; Thomas, Almut; Eckes, Alexander; Großmann, Nadine; Dittrich, Ann-Kathrin; Wilde, Matthias",Eur J Investig Health Psychol Educ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8314371/,360

The aims of our study were: i) to perform a meta-analysis on the efficacy of the bacterial lysate OM-85 BV in preventing acute exacerbations in patients with COPD; ii) to evaluate whether this preventive treatment can lead to significant savings for the National Health Service (NHS). METHODS: A systematic research was conducted in the electronic database MEDLINE (PubMed) in June 2017-July 2020, collecting evidences without time restrictions. Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included. The keywords used were “OM 85 BV AND chronic bronchitis” and “OM 85 BV AND COPD”. A cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) was performed considering the costs for a treatment with OM-8BV, the costs for the treatment of an acute exacerbation and the number of prevented exacerbations. RESULTS: 59 publications were found, but the meta-analysis was conducted on 13 studies that met the inclusion criteria. OM-85 BV is responsible of a statistically significant reduction in the mean number of COPD exacerbations (p < 0.01; WMD = -0.86; CI 95%: -1.38, -0.34) and in the days of antibiotic therapy (p < 0.01; WMD = -9.49; CI 95%: -11.93, -7.05). The cost-effectiveness ratio with a negative value is in favor to treatment. CONCLUSIONS: OM-85 BV is effective in reducing exacerbations, and could lead to significant savings for the NHS. Moreover, reducing the number of exacerbations it could avoid an over-use of antibiotics and the consequent antibiotic resistance.","TROIANO, GIANMARCO; MESSINA, GABRIELE; NANTE, NICOLA",J Prev Med Hyg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8451348/,360

Most CDI will respond to antibiotic therapy, but 3%-10% of all patients with CDI will progress to a severe, life-threatening course. Complete removal of the large bowel is indicated for severe CDI. However, the 30-day mortality following surgical intervention for severe CDI ranges from 20% to 70%. A less invasive approach using surgical faecal diversion and direct colonic lavage with polyethylene glycol (PEG) and vancomycin has demonstrated a relative mortality reduction of approximately 50%. As an alternative to these operative approaches, we propose to treat patients with bedside intestinal lavage with PEG and vancomycin instillation via nasojejunal tube, in addition to usual antibiotic management. Preliminary data collected by our research group are encouraging. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We will conduct a 1-year, single-centre, pilot randomised controlled trial to study this new treatment strategy for patients with severe CDI and additional risk factors for fulminant or complicated infection. After informed consent, patients with severe-complicated CDI without immediate indication for surgery will be randomised to either usual antibiotic treatment or usual antibiotic treatment with the addition of 8 L of PEG lavage via nasojejunal tube. This pilot trial will evaluate our eligibility and enrolment rate, protocol compliance and adverse event rates and provide further data to inform a more robust sample size calculation and protocol modifications for a definitive multicentre trial design. Based on historical data, we anticipate enrolling approximately 24 patients during the 1-year pilot study period.As a pilot study, data will be reported in aggregate. Between-group differences will be assessed in a blinded fashion for evidence of harm, and to further refine our sample size calculation. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION This study protocol has been reviewed and approved by our local institutional review board. Results of the pilot trial and subsequent main trial will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal.

65593,Improved Anthropogenic SO2 Retrieval from High-Spatial-Resolution Satellite and its Application during the COVID-19 Pandemic.,2021-09-07,"PURPOSE The anatomy of the inguinal region is notoriously challenging to master. We sought to teach open inguinal hernia (OIH) and totally extraperitoneal (TEP) anatomy with simulation models among general surgery (GS) interns. METHODS Low-fidelity OIH and TEP models were constructed out of cardboard, plastic bins, fabric, and yarn. GS interns (n = 30) participated in a 3-h hernia session including a pretest, anatomy lecture, simulated OIH and TEP hernia repair, and posttest. Pre- and posttest scores were based on a difficult 30-point exam which included didactic questions (10 points), drawing relevant TEP (10 points), and OIH (10 points) anatomy. Participants were surveyed following the session. RESULTS Median pretest scores were 13 % (range 0-60 %). Median posttest scores improved to 47 % (range 20-93 %, p < 0.001). Median number of structures drawn in the TEP image improved from 2 (range 0-14) to 11 (range 1-21, p < 0.001). Median number of structures drawn in the OIH image improved from 3 (range 0-15) to 7 (range 1-19, p < 0.001). 67 % (12/18) demonstrated improvement in knowledge of abdominal wall layers. 23 % (7/30) knew the triangles of pain/doom on the pretest vs. 77 % (23/30) on the posttest. Mean Likert scores favored session enjoyability (4.5), not a waste of training time (4.4), and improved understanding of OIH and TEP anatomy (4.4, 4.2). CONCLUSIONS Low-fidelity simulators can be used to teach and assess knowledge of TEP and OIH anatomy. While enjoyable and useful, one 3-h session does not create master hernia surgeons or expert anatomists out of novice trainees.","Rowse, P G; Ruparel, R K; Abdelsattar, J M; AlJamal, Y N; Dy, B M; Farley, D R",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10029-015-1409-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26238398/,360

Therefore, they should have the essential competencies for approaching patients. Aims The study aimed to identify essential competencies required for approaching patients with COVID-19. Methods All postgraduate health professionals at the Syrian Virtual University SVU (n=28) were invited to participate in the study during the Covid-19 lockdown in 2020, resulting in 20 postgraduates accepting. The Delphi technique was adopted for identifying competencies in medical education and a virtual meeting was undertaken through the University Management System in order to provide instruction and create a list of competencies. Competency domains were divided into 'knowledge', 'skills', and 'attitudes' and were classified into four categories: etiology, assessment and diagnosis, management, and prognosis. Results Fifty-two essential competencies were identified; 7 competencies on etiology, 7 related to assessment and diagnosis, 34 related to management, and 4 related to prognosis. Conclusion It is hoped that the identified competencies would help health professionals to deliver the best health care for COVI-19 patients, as well as help policy-makers to support comprehensive training programmes that can equip health professionals with the required competencies to fight the pandemic.","Dashash, Mayssoon; Almasri, Bashar; Takaleh, Eman; Halawah, Alaa Abou; Sahyouni, Amal",Eastern Mediterranean health journal = La revue de sante de la Mediterranee orientale = al-Majallah al-sihhiyah li-sharq al-mutawassit,https://doi.org/10.26719/emhj.20.111; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33047791/,360

There is a gap in the understanding of the risk factors associated with the development of pediatric PTS preventing the early identification of those patients at greatest risk, and the development of risk-stratified interventions. OBJECTIVES To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature on prognostic factors for PTS development in pediatric patients. METHODS A systematic search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library from 1960 to December 2018 was performed. Eligible studies reported at least one prognostic factor for PTS development in patients <21 years of age with a radiographically confirmed DVT. To be included in the meta-analysis, prognostic factors had to be reported in at least three published studies. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS Twelve studies (n= 1,160 patients) met criteria for inclusion. Ninety-three percent of patients with an extremity DVT(n=1076) were assessed for PTS. PTS developed in 40% (n=434) of these patients. Central venous catheter-associated DVT (odds ratio [OR] 1.8, 95% CI 1.08-2.98), complete veno-occlusion (OR 1.89, 95% CI 1.04-3.46), and incomplete DVT resolution (OR 2.07, 95% CI 1.4-3.07) were identified as candidate prognostic factors for pediatric PTS. These findings should be interpreted in the context of the heterogeneity of the included studies and the limitations of current pediatric PTS assessment tools. Further, the predictive value of these prognostic factors will need to be validated in future collaborative prospective multicenter studies that maximize the homogeneity of pediatric DVT patients.","Engel, Elissa R; Nguyen, Anh Thy H; Amankwah, Ernest K; Albisetti, Manuela; Brandão, Leonardo R; Goldenberg, Neil A; Betensky, Marisol",Journal of thrombosis and haemostasis : JTH,https://doi.org/10.1111/jth.14984; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32614496/,360

In these cases, questions arise of a detailed analysis of the etiology and pathogenesis of the disease, differential diagnosis of the pathological process, including those rarely encountered in the practice of a maxillofacial surgeon. One of these diseases is Rosai Dorfman's disease, which refers to extranodal histiocytosis. In domestic and foreign literature, single clinical observations are found without a detailed analysis of the diagnostic algorithm and the choice of treatment tactics. This article presents a clinical case of Rosai-Dorfman disease of a 55-year-old patient with a lesion of the soft tissues of the maxillofacial region. The described case took place in the clinic of maxillofacial surgery of the Research Institute of Dentistry of Surgical and Maxillofacial Surgery PSPbGMU named after academician I.P. Pavlova in the period from 2016 to 2019. Given the complexity of the diagnosis of this rare nosological form, we offer a specific examination algorithm that leads to a multidisciplinary comprehensive approach from disease verification to the choice of treatment tactics.","Kalakutskiy, N V; Baranova, I B; Ovsepian, T N; Ribakova, M G; Kasimova, N D",Stomatologiia,https://doi.org/10.17116/stomat202110003190; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34180631/,360

72113,A Novel Approach to Clinical Simulation in Removable Partial Denture Treatment.,2020-06-26,"BACKGROUND As we move toward a polio-free world, the challenge for the polio program is to create an unrelenting focus on smaller areas where the virus is still present, where children are being repeatedly missed, where immunity levels are low, and where surveillance is weak. OBJECTIVE This article aimed to describe a possible solution to address weak surveillance systems and document the outcomes of the deployment of the Auto-Visual Acute Flaccid Paralysis Detection and Reporting (AVADAR) project. METHODS This intervention was implemented in 99 targeted high-risk districts with concerns for silent polio circulation from eight countries in Africa between August 1, 2017, and July 31, 2018. A total of 6954 persons (5390 community informants and 1564 health workers) were trained and equipped with a smartphone on which the AVADAR app was configured to allow community informants to send alerts on suspected acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) and allow health worker to use electronic checklists for investigation of such alerts. The AVADAR and Open Data Kit ONA servers were at the center of the entire process. A dashboard system and coordination teams for monitoring and supervision were put in place at all levels. RESULTS Overall, 96.44% (24,142/25,032) of potential AFP case alerts were investigated by surveillance personnel, yielding 1414 true AFP cases. This number (n=1414) reported through AVADAR was higher than the 238 AFP cases expected during the study period in the AVADAR districts and the 491 true AFP cases reported by the traditional surveillance system. A total of 203 out of the 1414 true AFP cases reported were from special population settings, such as refugee camps and insecure areas. There was an improvement in reporting in silent health areas in all the countries using the AVADAR system. Finally, there were 23,473 reports for other diseases, such as measles, diarrhea, and cerebrospinal meningitis, using the AVADAR platform. CONCLUSIONS This article demonstrates the added value of AVADAR to rapidly improve surveillance sensitivity. AVADAR is capable of supporting countries to improve surveillance sensitivity within a short interval before and beyond polio-free certification.","Ticha, Johnson Muluh; Akpan, Godwin Ubong; Paige, Lara Mf; Senouci, Kamel; Stein, Andrew; Briand, Patrick; Tuma, Jude; Oyaole, Daniel Rasheed; Ngofa, Reuben; Maleghemi, Sylvester; Touray, Kebba; Salihu, Abdullahi Ahmed; Diallo, Mamadou; Tegegne, Sisay Gashu; Bello, Isah Mohammed; Idris, Umar Kabo; Maduka, Omosivie; Manengu, Casimir; Shuaib, Faisal; Galway, Michael; Mkanda, Pascal",JMIR public health and surveillance,https://doi.org/10.2196/18950; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33263550/,360

Material and Methods An electronic search was conducted in PubMed, ScienceDirect, ISI Web of Knowledge and Google Scholar between January 2010 and February 2020. Studies evaluating implant survival rate and main clinical parameters were included for a qualitative and quantitative analysis. Results In total, nine studies were included and a pool of 2281 sockets were analysed. Compared with the non-infected group, the infected group showed no significant differences in implant survival rates (risk ratio [RR] = 0.99; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.98 to 1; P = 0.08). No significant statistical differences were found in marginal bone level (mean difference [MD] = -0.03; 95% CI = -0.1 to 0.04; P = 0.41), marginal gingival level (MD = -0.07; 95% CI = -0.17 to 0.04; P = 0.23), probing depth (MD = 0.06; 95% CI = -0.24 to 0.36; P = 0.7), modified bleeding index (MD = -0.00162196; 95% CI = -0.09 to 0.09; P = 0.97) and slight but significant changes were seen in width of keratinized gingiva (MD = 0.25; 95% CI = -0.3 to 0.8; P = 0.38) between the groups at the latest follow-up. Conclusions There were no significant difference in implant survival rates, marginal bone level, marginal gingival level, modified bleeding index and probing depth between infected sockets and non-infected sockets. However, slight but significant changes were seen in width of keratinized gingiva favouring the non-infected group.","Saijeva, Aza; Juodzbalys, Gintaras",Journal of oral & maxillofacial research,https://doi.org/10.5037/jomr.2020.11201; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32760474/,360

80429,The end of social confinement and COVID-19 re-emergence risk.,2020-06-22,"One of the prominent, by now seminal, paradigms in the research tradition of cognitive dissonance (Festinger, 1957) is the free-choice paradigm developed by Brehm (1956) to measure choice-induced preference change. Some 50 years after Brehm introduced the paradigm, Chen and Risen (2010) published an influential critique arguing that what the paradigm measures is not necessarily a choice-induced preference change, but possibly an artifact of the choice revealing existing preferences. They showed that once the artifact is experimentally controlled for, there is either no or very little evidence for choice-induced preference change. Given the prominence of the paradigm, this critique meant that much of what we thought we knew about the psychological process of cognitive dissonance might not be true. Following the critique, research using the paradigm applied various corrections to overcome the artifact. The present research examined whether choice truly changes preferences, or rather merely reflects them. We conducted a meta-analysis on 43 studies (N = 2,191), all using an artifact-free free-choice paradigm. Using different meta-analytical methods, and conceptually different analyses, including a Bayesian one, we found an overall effect size of Cohen's d = 0.40, 95% confidence interval (CI) [0.32, 0.49]. Furthermore, we found no evidence for publication bias as an alternative explanation for the choice-induced preference change effect. These results support the existence of true preference change created by choice.

However, CAT is a known risk factor for postoperative bleeding after elective surgery. The primary objective of the present study was to evaluate the short- and long-term complications of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) in patients receiving CAT. METHODS This is a retrospective analysis of a prospective database of CAT patients undergoing LSG between March 2004 and December 2012. This LSG-CAT group was matched 1:2 on preoperative data with patients not receiving CAT (LSG-control group). Primary efficacy criterion was the frequency of CAT-related complications. Secondary efficacy criteria were the major postoperative complications, frequency of revisional surgery, long-term CAT-related complications, and a change in the dose level of oral anticoagulants. RESULTS The LSG-CAT group consisted of 15 patients with a median age of 54 years (32-65). The LSG-control group consisted of 30 patients. Median operating time was 75 min in both groups (p = 0.33). Major complication rates in the LSG-CAT and LSG-control groups were 13.3 and 3.3 %, respectively (p = 0.20), with one case of postoperative bleeding in each group (6.7 and 3.3 %, p = 0.6); incidence of revisional surgery was 13.3 and 3.3 % (p = 0.2). There were no postoperative mortalities. After a median follow-up of 14 months (9-43), no changes in the dose level of oral anticoagulants were reported. CONCLUSIONS LSG in patients receiving CAT is not associated with CAT-specific complications. This surgical procedure enables good weight loss and does not require change in the dose level of oral anticoagulants.","Gerin, Olivier; Rebibo, Lionel; Dhahri, Abdennaceur; Regimbeau, Jean-Marc",Obesity surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-015-1590-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25663098/,360
82518,The Value of Triage during Periods of Intense COVID-19 Demand: Simulation Modeling Study.,2021-02-09,"Abstract The implementation of public health measures to control the current COVID-19 pandemic (such as wider lockdowns, overseas travel restrictions and physical distancing) is likely to have affected the spread of other notifiable diseases. This is a descriptive report of communicable disease surveillance in Central Queensland (CQ) for six months (1 April to 30 September 2020) after the introduction of physical distancing and wider lockdown measures in Queensland. The counts of notifiable communicable diseases in CQ in the six months were observed and compared with the average for the same months during the years 2015 to 2019. During the study's six months, there were notable decreases in notifications of most vaccine-preventable diseases such as influenza, pertussis and rotavirus. Conversely, notifications increased for disease groups such as blood-borne viruses, sexually transmitted infections and vector-borne diseases. There were no reported notifications for dengue fever and malaria which are mostly overseas acquired. The notifications of some communicable diseases in CQ were variably affected and the changes correlated with the implementation of the COVID-19 public health measures. Background The current COVID-19 pandemic has led to some significant changes to local, regional and national public health practices including social distancing and wider lockdown. These measures have been previously reported to be associated with reductions in the incidence of gastrointestinal and respiratory diseases as well as of other airborne transmitted agents.1,2 A preliminary analysis was conducted assessing the impact of these measures on nationally notifiable diseases across Australia;3 however, the impact of these measures on communicable diseases within regional Australia is not well established. Like most regional areas, Central Queensland (CQ) has a lower population density and considerable distance from major cities; it will be informative to understand how these measures impact on notifiable conditions in this regional setting. We aimed to identify the patterns of change in reported notifiable conditions to the Central Queensland Public Health Unit (CQPHU), during a six-month period (1 April to 30 September 2020) following the implementation of COVID-19 measures. Here, we compare these notifications to the surveillance data for the same six-month period for the previous five years (2015 to 2019). Methods The study encompasses all notifiable conditions reported from CQ, which covers approximately 226,000 population and is spread over 117,588 square kilometres. Communicable diseases data were retrieved from the Queensland Notifiable Conditions System (NoCS), an online epidemiological database, from 1 January 2015 to 30 September 2020. The data were collected under the Public Health Act 2005, a legislative authority that provides permission to access health information. Permission to publish was given by the Communicable Diseases Branch of Queensland. Data were extracted on selected notifiable diseases in Queensland: blood-borne viruses (BBV), gastrointestinal diseases, sexually transmissible infections (STIs), vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs), vector-borne diseases, zoonotic diseases and other diseases. For each disease, the count for six months following the implementation of COVID-19 public health measures (1 April to 30 September 2020) was compared with the average for the same six-month period during the years 2015 to 2019. Results From 1 April to 30 September 2020, after the implementation of Queensland's COVID-19 preventive measures, there was a decrease seen in several diseases notifications reported to the CQPHU, mostly VPDs, when compared with the same months for each of 2015 to 2019 and for the 5-year average (2015-2019) for those months (Table 1). However, increases in notifications for April-September 2020 were observed in a greater number of other notifiable disease groups.","Adegbija, Odewumi; Walker, Jacina; Smoll, Nicolas; Khan, Arifuzzaman; Graham, Julieanne; Khandaker, Gulam",Communicable diseases intelligence,https://doi.org/10.33321/cdi.2021.45.11; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33632091/,360

High volume care of complex surgical oncology patients has been repeatedly associated with improved outcomes. Most studies, however, are retrospective and have not prospectively accounted for confounders such as financial ability and social support. Four electronic databases (Ovid MEDLINE®, Ovid EMBASE, Cochrane Library (Wiley), and EBSCHOHost) were searched from inception until August 25, 2018. Two authors independently reviewed 5887 references, with a third independent reviewer acting as arbitrator when needed. Data extracted from 11 articles that met inclusion criteria. Risk of bias assessments conducted using MINORS criteria for the non-randomized, observational studies, and the Cochrane tool for the randomized-controlled trial. Of the 11 studies selected, we found 7 historically-controlled trials, two retrospective cohort studies with prospective data collection, one prospective study, and one randomized-controlled trial. 73% of studies were from Northern Europe, 18% from Ontario, Canada, and 9% from England. Pancreatic surgery accounted for 36% of studies, followed by gynecologic oncology (27%), thoracic surgery (18%), and dermatologic surgery (9%). The studies reported varying outcome parameters, but all showed improvement post-regionalization. Included studies featured poor-to-fair risk of bias. 11 studies indicated improved outcomes following regionalization of surgical oncology, but most exhibit poor methodological rigor. Prospective evidence for the regionalization of surgical oncology is lacking. More research addressing patient access to care and specialist availability is needed to understand the shortcomings of centralization.","Goel, Shokhi; Symer, Matthew M; Alzghari, Talal; Nelson, Becky B; Yeo, Heather L",Updates in surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s13304-021-01073-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34028698/,360

SARS-CoV-2 antibody deficiency in the setting of a tissue viral burden suggests that using an antibody as a therapeutic agent would augment the antiviral immune response. In this issue of the JCI, Wang and collaborators describe the kinetics of viral load and antibody responses of 23 individuals with COVID-19 with mild and severe disease. The researchers found: 1) individuals with mild and severe disease produced neutralizing IgG to SARS-CoV-2 10 days after disease onset; 2) SARS-CoV-2 persisted longer in those with severe disease; and 3) there was cross-reactivity between antibodies to SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, but only antibodies from patients with COVID-19 neutralized SARS-CoV-2. These observations provide important information on the serological response to SARS-CoV-2 of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 that can inform the use of convalescent plasma therapy.","Casadevall, Arturo; Joyner, Michael J; Pirofski, Liise-Anne",The Journal of clinical investigation,https://doi.org/10.1172/jci139760; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32634126/,360

Pigs infected with ASF and CSF viruses (ASFV and CSFV) develop clinical signs that may be indistinguishable from other diseases. Likewise, various causes of vesicular disease can mimic clinical signs caused by the FMD virus (FMDV). Early detection is critical to limiting the impact and spread of these disease outbreaks, and the ability to perform herd-level surveillance for all 3 diseases rapidly and cost effectively using a single diagnostic sample and test is highly desirable. This study assessed the feasibility of simultaneous ASFV, CSFV, and FMDV detection by multiplex reverse transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction (mRT-qPCR) in swine oral fluids collected through the use of chewing ropes. Animal groups were experimentally infected independently with each virus, observed for clinical signs, and oral fluids collected and tested throughout the course of infection. All animal groups chewed on the ropes readily before and after onset of clinical signs and before onset of lameness or serious clinical signs.

DESIGN Correlational. Intelligence (Stanford-Binet) and neurocognitive functioning (NEPSY) were assessed, with sleep variables being measured during overnight polysomnography. SETTING Hospital sleep laboratory. PARTICIPANTS Twenty-seven healthy children (mean age 8.19 y; 14 female, 13 male). INTERVENTIONS N/A. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS Participants underwent a single night of overnight polysomnography after completing measures of intelligence and neurocognitive functioning. Sleep spindles were visually identified by an experienced sleep scoring technician and separated algorithmically into fast (> 13 Hz) and slow spindle (< 13 Hz) categories. The number of fast spindles was significantly correlated with narrative memory (r(s) = 0.38) and sensorimotor functioning (-0.43). Mean central frequency of spindles was also significantly correlated with sensorimotor functioning (-0.41), planning ability (-0.41), and working memory (-0.54). CONCLUSIONS Basal sleep spindle activity is associated with different aspects of cognitive performance in children. To the extent that these associations in a pediatric population are different from what is known in adult sleep may play an important role in development.","Chatburn, Alex; Coussens, Scott; Lushington, Kurt; Kennedy, Declan; Baumert, Mathias; Kohler, Mark",Sleep,https://doi.org/10.5665/sleep.2380; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23372271/,360

Objective To characterize the risk and degree of QT prolongation in patients with COVID-19 in association with their use of hydroxychloroquine with or without concomitant azithromycin. Design, Setting, and Participants This was a cohort study performed at an academic tertiary care center in Boston, Massachusetts, of patients hospitalized with at least 1 positive COVID-19 nasopharyngeal polymerase chain reaction test result and clinical findings consistent with pneumonia who received at least 1 day of hydroxychloroquine from March 1, 2020, through April 7, 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures Change in QT interval after receiving hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin; occurrence of other potential adverse drug events. Results Among 90 patients given hydroxychloroquine, 53 received concomitant azithromycin; 44 (48.9%) were female, and the mean (SD) body mass index was 31.5 (6.6). Hypertension (in 48 patients [53.3%]) and diabetes mellitus (in 26 patients [28.9%]) were the most common comorbid conditions. The overall median (interquartile range) baseline QTc was 455 (430-474) milliseconds (hydroxychloroquine, 473 [454-487] milliseconds vs hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, 442 [427-461] milliseconds; P < .001). Those receiving concomitant azithromycin had a greater median (interquartile range) change in QT interval (23 [10-40] milliseconds) compared with those receiving hydroxychloroquine alone (5.5 [-15.5 to 34.25] milliseconds; P = .03). Seven patients (19%) who received hydroxychloroquine monotherapy developed prolonged QTc of 500 milliseconds or more, and 3 patients (8%) had a change in QTc of 60 milliseconds or more. Of those who received concomitant azithromycin, 11 of 53 (21%) had prolonged QTc of 500 milliseconds or more and 7 of 53 (13 %) had a change in QTc of 60 milliseconds or more. The likelihood of prolonged QTc was greater in those who received concomitant loop diuretics (adjusted odds ratio, 3.38 [95% CI, 1.03-11.08]) or had a baseline QTc of 450 milliseconds or more (adjusted odds ratio, 7.11 [95% CI, 1.75-28.87]). Ten patients had hydroxychloroquine discontinued early because of potential adverse drug events, including intractable nausea, hypoglycemia, and 1 case of torsades de pointes. Conclusions and Relevance In this cohort study, patients who received hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of pneumonia associated with COVID-19 were at high risk of QTc prolongation, and concurrent treatment with azithromycin was associated with greater changes in QTc. Clinicians should carefully weigh risks and benefits if considering hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, with close monitoring of QTc and concomitant medication usage.","Mercuro, Nicholas J; Yen, Christina F; Shim, David J; Maher, Timothy R; McCoy, Christopher M; Zimetbaum, Peter J; Gold, Howard S",JAMA cardiology,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamacardio.2020.1834; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32936252/,360

PATIENTS AND METHODS In this retrospective single-centre study, 340 consecutive patients underwent LPN and OPN for localized, incidentally discovered, renal masses of <7 cm (cT1). The patients were matched for age, sex, body mass index, American Society of Anesthesiology score, tumour side (right or left kidney) and tumour characteristics (RENAL nephrometry score). Demographic data, peri- and postoperative variables, including operating time, estimated blood loss, complications, hospital stay, renal function, histological tumour staging and grading, and metastasis rates were collected and analysed. RESULTS The median (SEM) operating time for LPN and OPN was 145.3 (45.4) min and 155.2 (35.6) min, respectively (P = 0.07). The median (SEM) warm ischaemia time was 11.7 (2.2) min in the LPN and 14.4 (1.9) min in the OPN group (P = 0.03). The median (SEM) RENAL nephrometry scores for LPN and OPN were 5.9 (1.6) and 6.1 (0.3), respectively (P = 0.11). During follow-up, the biochemical markers of glomerular filtration were completely normalized, showing the absence of renal injury and there was no significant difference in glomerular filtration rate between the groups, with median (SEM) rates of 79.8 (3.0) mL/min/1.72 m(2) for the LPN and 80.2 (2.7) mL/min/1.72 m(2) for the OPN group at 5-year follow-up. The 5-year overall survival and cancer-specific survival rates, calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method, were 94% and 91% in the LPN group, and 92% and 88% in the OPN group. CONCLUSION LPN and OPN provide similar long-term oncological outcomes in the therapy of T1 renal cancer. With regard to renal function, no damage to the kidney was found after LPN and OPN, with a complete normalization of renal function at the 5-year follow-up in both groups.","Springer, Christopher; Hoda, M Raschid; Fajkovic, Harun; Pini, Giovannalberto; Mohammed, Nasreldin; Fornara, Paolo; Greco, Francesco",BJU international,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1464-410x.2012.11280.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22672491/,360

AIMS We aimed to identify the causes of anxiety in HCPs during the COVID-19 pandemic, to assess whether HCPs felt they had adequate mental health and wellbeing support and to identify their unmet support needs. METHOD We used a web-based survey utilising an online tool circulated to UK HCPs over 5 weeks. Self-perceived anxiety levels prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic were measured on a 10-point Likert-type rating scale. RESULTS The survey was completed by 558 HCPs. During the pandemic, self-perceived anxiety scores significantly increased from a median of 2 to 7 (paired Wilcoxon signed-rank test; p<0.001). The main reasons were concerns about exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and lack of personal protective equipment. Other wide-ranging reasons were identified. Only 41% of respondents felt there was adequate support. Thematic analysis of what support HCPs wanted identified 13 wide-ranging themes; including effective leadership and peer support. CONCLUSION Anxiety levels in HCPs significantly increased during the COVID-19 pandemic and the main causes were identified. Many HCPs felt there was inadequate support and identified what support they needed. Implementing effective strategies to support HCPs' unmet wellbeing needs are required as a matter of urgency.","Siddiqui, Imrana; Aurelio, Marco; Gupta, Ajay; Blythe, Jenny; Khanji, Mohammed Y",Clinical medicine,https://doi.org/10.7861/clinmed.2020-0502; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33479070/,360

The total patient cohort comprised the first 237 patients undergoing robotic surgeries at our hospital between August 2007 and June 2009; the last 100 patients undergoing LAVH by the same surgeons between July 2006 and February 2008 and 165 patients undergoing LAVHs performed by nine surgeons between January 2008 and June 2009; 87 patients undergoing LSH by the same nine surgeons between January 2008 and June 2009. Among the RALH patients were cases of greater complexity: (1) higher prevalence of prior abdominopelvic surgery than that found among LAVH patients; (2) an increased number of procedures for endometriosis and pelvic reconstruction. Uterine weights also were greater in RALH patients [207.4 vs. 149.6 (LAVH; P < 0.001) and 141.1 g (LSH; P = 0.005)]. Despite case complexity, operative time was significantly lower in RALH than in LAVH (89.9 vs. 124.8 min, P < 0.001) and similar to that in LSH (89.6 min). Estimated blood loss was greater in LAVH (167.9 ml) than in RALH (59.0 ml, P < 0.001) or LSH (65.7 ml, P < 0.001). Length of hospital stay was shorter for RALH than for LAVH or LSH. Conversion and complication rates were low and similar across procedures. Multivariable regression indicated that LAVH, obesity, uterine weight ≥250 g and older age predicted significantly longer operative time. The learning curve for RALH demonstrated improved operative time over the case series. Our findings show the benefits of RALH over LAVH. Outcomes in RALH can be as good as or better than those in LSH, suggesting the latter should be the choice primarily for women desiring cervix-sparing surgery.","Giep, Bang N; Giep, Hoang N; Hubert, Helen B",Journal of robotic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11701-010-0206-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20835393/,360

This application (WO2012106634A1) claims the use of blocking CD200 antibody to achieve long-term survival of allografts. CD200 is the ligand for the inhibitory CD200 receptor (CD200R). METHODS In mouse allograft transplantation models, a blocking CD200 antibody was used to improve renal and cardiac graft survival. Similarly, in humans a blocking CD200 antibody would be administered to the organ recipient in combination with currently used immunosuppressive drugs or even as a monotherapy. RESULTS In the presented animal experiments, anti-CD200 antibody application to the allograft recipient decreases SHIP expression in splenocytes. This is accompanied by a significant increase in renal or cardiac graft survival. Furthermore, anti-CD200 antibody has an immunosuppressive effect manifested by an increased production of T regulatory and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and a decrease in B cells and activated T cells. CONCLUSION In vivo administration of anti-CD200 antibody has a remarkable positive effect on allograft survival. However, since this finding contradicts all previous effects of in vivo CD200 manipulation described in transplantation settings, future development of this invention is highly uncertain.","Rygiel, Tomasz P; Luijk, Bart; Meyaard, Linde",Expert opinion on therapeutic patents,https://doi.org/10.1517/13543776.2013.765406; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23351009/,360

METHODS In this cross-sectional study, an online-based anonymous survey was conducted within the Convention of University Professors of Orthopaedic and Trauma Surgery in Germany from April 3 to April 11, 2020. A bipolar 5-point Likert scale (with possible responses of ""totally disagree,"" ""rather disagree,"" ""neutral,"" ""rather agree,"" and ""totally agree"") was applied. Fifty-two (69.3%) of 75 clinic directors participated. RESULTS Communication and cooperation with the government, hospital administration, and other departments during the COVID-19 pandemic were mainly perceived as appropriate. However, only 7 respondents (13.7%) totally agreed or rather agreed with the statement that the authorities are supporters of orthopaedic and trauma surgery departments. Substantial financial and personnel changes in orthopaedic and trauma surgery departments of university hospitals were reported, resulting in an average reduction of 49.4% in operating room capacity and an expected 29.3% loss of revenue. In addition, 14.7% of physicians were reallocated from orthopaedic and trauma surgery to other care-delivery environments. CONCLUSIONS Our study demonstrated that the COVID-19 pandemic has had a substantial impact on orthopaedic and trauma surgery departments in German university hospitals. Distinct structural and financial effects were noted. Nevertheless, the present study demonstrates the commitment of our specialty to overcome the pandemic by providing competent personnel as well as close cooperation with the hospital administration and other departments. CLINICAL RELEVANCE To our knowledge, this is the first Germany-wide survey among the heads of orthopaedic and trauma surgery departments in university hospitals on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey results may help to inform system-wide decision-making in Germany, in Europe, and beyond.","Haffer, Henryk; Schömig, Friederike; Rickert, Markus; Randau, Thomas; Raschke, Michael; Wirtz, Dieter; Pumberger, Matthias; Perka, Carsten",The Journal of bone and joint surgery.

These include chronic neurological conditions such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, and acute respiratory infections such as that caused by COVID-19. The capsules were fabricated by concentrically dripping oil/alginate droplets, from a coaxial nozzle, into an oppositely charged ionic liquid. This fabrication technique enables full control over the capsule size, the shell thickness and the volume of the encapsulated oil. After formation, liquid capsules were left to dry and form a solid crust surrounding the oil. The prototype test consists of placing a standardized number of capsules between adhesive strips that users crush and pull apart to release the smell. In addition to the fabrication method, a simple mathematical model was developed to predict the volume of encapsulated oil within the capsule in terms of the flow rate ratio and the nozzle size. Tensile tests show that capsule strength is inversely proportional to its size owing to an increase in the shell thickness. By increasing the alginate concentration, the load required to rupture the capsule increases, to the point where capsules are too stiff to be broken by a fingertip grip. Results from a preliminary screening test, within a group of patients with Parkinson's disease, found that smells were detectable using a 'forced choice' paradigm.","Ismail, A Said; Goodwin, Gregory R; Castrejon-Pita, J Rafael; Noyce, Alastair J; Azevedo, Helena S","Journal of the Royal Society, Interface",https://doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2021.0039; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33906383/,360

Enzymatic glycosylation of proteins involves a complex metabolic network and different types of glycosylation pathways that orchestrate enormous amplification of the proteome in producing diversity of proteoforms and its biological functions. The tremendous structural diversity of glycans attached to proteins poses analytical challenges that limit exploration of specific functions of glycosylation. Major advances in quantitative transcriptomics, proteomics and nuclease-based gene editing are now opening new global ways to explore protein glycosylation through analysing and targeting enzymes involved in glycosylation processes. In silico models predicting cellular glycosylation capacities and glycosylation outcomes are emerging, and refined maps of the glycosylation pathways facilitate genetic approaches to address functions of the vast glycoproteome. These approaches apply commonly available cell biology tools, and we predict that use of (single-cell) transcriptomics, genetic screens, genetic engineering of cellular glycosylation capacities and custom design of glycoprotein therapeutics are advancements that will ignite wider integration of glycosylation in general cell biology.","Schjoldager, Katrine T; Narimatsu, Yoshiki; Joshi, Hiren J; Clausen, Henrik",Nature reviews.

In relation to Mycoplasma and Ureaplasma spp., only few species seem to show a correlation with infertility and poor in-vitro fertilization outcomes. There is evidence of a role for bacterial vaginosis in early pregnancy loss. HPV infection in males seems to determine infertility.

100286,"The 2020 special report of the MJA-Lancet Countdown on health and climate change: lessons learnt from Australia's ""Black Summer"".",2020-12-02,"BACKGROUND APOL1 is found in human kidney podocytes and endothelia. Variants G1 and G2 of the APOL1 gene account for the high frequency of nondiabetic CKD among African Americans. Proposed mechanisms of kidney podocyte cytotoxicity resulting from APOL1 variant overexpression implicate different subcellular compartments. It is unclear where endogenous podocyte APOL1 resides, because previous immunolocalization studies utilized overexpressed protein or commercially available antibodies that crossreact with APOL2. This study describes and distinguishes the locations of both APOLs. METHODS Immunohistochemistry, confocal and immunoelectron microscopy, and podocyte fractionation localized endogenous and transfected APOL1 using a large panel of novel APOL1-specific mouse and rabbit monoclonal antibodies. RESULTS Both endogenous podocyte and transfected APOL1 isoforms vA and vB1 (and a little of isoform vC) localize to the luminal face of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and to the cell surface, but not to mitochondria, endosomes, or lipid droplets. In contrast, APOL2, isoform vB3, and most vC of APOL1 localize to the cytoplasmic face of the ER and are consequently absent from the cell surface. APOL1 knockout podocytes do not stain for APOL1, attesting to the APOL1-specificity of the antibodies. Stable re-transfection of knockout podocytes with inducible APOL1-G0, -G1, and -G2 showed no differences in localization among variants. CONCLUSIONS APOL1 is found in the ER and plasma membrane, consistent with either the ER stress or surface cation channel models of APOL1-mediated cytotoxicity. The surface localization of APOL1 variants potentially opens new therapeutic targeting avenues.","Scales, Suzie J; Gupta, Nidhi; De Mazière, Ann M; Posthuma, George; Chiu, Cecilia P; Pierce, Andrew A; Hötzel, Kathy; Tao, Jianhua; Foreman, Oded; Koukos, Georgios; Oltrabella, Francesca; Klumperman, Judith; Lin, WeiYu; Peterson, Andrew S",Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN,https://doi.org/10.1681/asn.2019080829; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32764142/,360

Although approved vaccines bring much hope, a vaccination program covering the entire global population will take a very long time, making the development of effective antiviral drugs an effective solution for the immediate treatment of this dangerous infection. Previous studies found that three natural compounds, namely, tannic acid, 3-isotheaflavin-3-gallate and theaflavin-3,3-digallate, are effective proteinase (3CLpro) inhibitors of SARS-CoV (IC50 <10 µM). Based on this information and due to the high sequence identity between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro, these three compounds could be candidate inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro. This paper explores the structural and energetic features that guided the molecular recognition of these three compounds for dimeric SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV 3CLpro, the functional state of this enzyme, using docking and MD simulations with the molecular mechanics-generalized-born surface area (MMGBSA) approach. Energetic analysis demonstrated that the three compounds reached good affinities in both systems in the following order: tannic acid > 3-isotheaflavin-3-gallate > theaflavin-3,3-digallate.

102302,A Note on Decomposition of Sources of Variability in Perceptual Decision-making.,2020-09-01,"PURPOSE Tonsillectomies are among the most common surgeries in otorhinolaryngology. A novel electrosurgical temperature-controlled instrument (device) promises rapid tonsillectomies and might reduce postoperative pain, but comparative studies to assess performance are warranted. METHODS This randomized self-controlled clinical trial was conducted from October 2019 to October 2020 at the Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery of the Medical University of Vienna. Forty-eight patients underwent a tonsillectomy with the device on one side and using cold-steel with localized bipolar cauterization on the other side (control). Main outcomes were the time for tonsil removal (per side) and the time to stop bleeding (per side). Secondary measurements were postoperative pain, assessed once on day 0 and five times on days 1, 3, 5, 7, and 10. Postoperative bleeding episodes and consequences were recorded. RESULTS Device tonsillectomies were performed significantly faster than controls; the mean surgical time difference was 209 s (p < 0.001, 95% CI 129; 288). Intraoperative blood loss was significantly lower on the device side (all p < 0.05). Postoperative measurements of pain and bleeding were similar for both sides. Two return-to-theatre secondary bleeding events were recorded for the control side. CONCLUSION The novel electrosurgical temperature-controlled divider reduced the tonsillectomy surgical time and intraoperative blood loss, with no apparent negative effects on postoperative pain or bleeding, compared to a cold-steel tonsillectomy with localized bipolar cauterization. In time-restricted settings, the device could be beneficial, particularly after familiarization with device handling.

103473,Gerontology in a Time of Pandemic: An Introduction to the Special Collection.,2021-01-21,"BACKGROUND Current therapies in Alzheimer's disease (AD), including Memantine, have proven to be only symptomatic but not curative nor disease-modifying. Fluoroethylnormemantine (FENM) is a structural analogue of Memantine, functionalized with a fluorine group that allowed its use as a positron emission tomography tracer. We here analyzed FENM neuroprotective potential in a pharmacological model of AD, in comparison to Memantine. METHODS Swiss mice were treated intracerebroventricularly with aggregated Aβ25-35 peptide and examined after one week in a battery of memory tests (spontaneous alternation; passive avoidance; object recognition; place learning in the water-maze; topographic memory in the Hamlet). Toxicity induced in the mouse hippocampus or cortex was analyzed biochemically or morphologically. RESULTS Both Memantine and FENM showed symptomatic anti-amnesic effects in Aβ25-35-treated mice. Interestingly, FENM was not amnesic when tested alone at 10 mg/kg, contrarily to Memantine. Drugs injected once-a-day prevented Aβ25-35-induced memory deficits, oxidative stress (lipid peroxidation, cytochrome c release), inflammation (IL-6, TNFα increases; glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and Iba1 immunoreactivity in the hippocampus and cortex), and apoptosis and cell loss (Bax/Bcl-2 ratio; cell loss in the hippocampus CA1 area). However, FENM effects were more robust than observed with Memantine, with significant attenuations vs. the Aβ25-35-treated group. CONCLUSIONS FENM therefore appeared as a potent neuroprotective drug in an AD model, with a superior efficacy as compared with Memantine, and an absence of direct amnesic effect at higher doses. These results open the possibility to use the compound at more relevant dosages than the ones actually proposed in Memantine treatment for AD.","Couly, Simon; Denus, Morgane; Bouchet, Mélanie; Rubinstenn, Gilles; Maurice, Tangui",The international journal of neuropsychopharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1093/ijnp/pyaa075; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32977336/,360

Lately, the role played by the neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in the development of HCC has attracted attention. However, the exact relationship is not fully understood.A total of 538 participants diagnosed with HCC were recruited between 2010 and 2018. Their relevant routine blood parameters were measured, including NLR. Pearson Chi-Squared test, Spearman Rho test, and logistic regression analysis were performed to explore any correlations between NLR and HCC. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to determine the usefulness of NLR for predicting HCC. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis for relevant routine blood parameters and any relationships with overall survival (OS) were performed. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to explore any further relationships with OS.NLR was significantly correlated with HCC tumor size by Pearson Chi-Squared test (P = .008). Furthermore, Spearman correlation coefficient showed that HCC tumor size was significantly correlated with NLR (P = .115, P = .008). NLR could sensitively and specifically predict HCC tumor size (area under the curve [AUC], 0.605; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.429-0.743; P = .000). Higher NLR in patients with HCC was correlated with better OS (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.584; P = .000).A close correlation existed between increased NLR and HCC; NLR could sensitively and specifically predict HCC. High NLR might be an independent protective factor in the prognosis of patients with HCC.","Li, Sheng-Chao; Xu, Zhuo; Deng, Yan-Li; Wang, Ya-Ni; Jia, Yu-Ming",Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000020919; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32629689/,360

Nurses provide a vital role in mitigating the effects of health crises. In order to help nurses better understand their skills, abilities, and knowledge, as well as the actions that they should take to manage care, the research aims of this study are to (1) investigate the level of preparedness, readiness, and anxiety among nurses during the COVID-19 outbreak in Sabah, Malaysia; (2) examine the effects of various differences in preparedness and readiness among nurses; and (3) examine the effect of COVID-19 preparedness on anxiety among nurses. The results revealed that the nurses were moderately competent in managing the COVID-19 care situation. Each of the 3 differentiating characteristics (age, work experience, and previous disaster experience) did not predict how nurses would manage COVID-19 preparedness significantly. Besides, we also found only 2 dimensions of preparedness (familiarity with epidemiology and surveillance and familiarity with psychological issues) significantly predicted nurses' anxiety levels. Familiarity with epidemiology and surveillance predicted nurses' anxiety positively; in contrast, familiarity with psychological issues negatively influenced nurses' anxiety.","Chua, Bee Seok; Cosmas, Getrude; Arsat, Norkiah",Asia-Pacific journal of public health,https://doi.org/10.1177/10105395211012170; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33938289/,360
104795,Transcarotid Mechanical Thrombectomy for Embolic Intracranial Large Vessel Occlusion after Endovascular Deconstructice Embolization for Carotid Blowout Syndrome.,2020-02-20,"Human CD317 is an intrinsic immunity factor that restricts the release of enveloped viruses, including the major pathogens HIV and Lassa virus, from infected cells in culture. Its importance for infection control in humans is unclear, due in part to its incompletely defined in vivo expression pattern. CD317 also has been proposed as a selective target for immunotherapy of multiple myeloma. To provide a framework for studies of the biological functions, regulation, and therapeutic potential of CD317, we performed microarray-based expression profiling in 468 tissue samples from 25 healthy organs from more than 210 patients. We found that CD317 protein was expressed to varying degrees in all organs tested and detected in a number of specialized cell types, including hepatocytes, pneumocytes, ducts of major salivary glands, pancreas and kidney, Paneth cells, epithelia, Leydig cells, plasma cells, bone marrow stromal cells, monocytes, and vascular endothelium. Although many of these cell types are in vivo targets for pathogenic viruses, restriction by CD317 or virus-encoded antagonists has been documented in only some of them. Limited cell type-dependent coexpression of CD317 with the IFN biomarker MxA in vivo and lack of responsive stimulation in organ explants suggest that interferons may only partially regulate CD317. This in vivo expression profiling sheds light on the biology and species-specificity of CD317, identifies multiple thus far unknown interaction sites of viruses with this restriction factor, and refutes the concept of its restricted constitutive expression and primary IFN inducibility. CD317's widespread expression calls into question its suitability as a target for immunotherapy.","Erikson, Elina; Adam, Tarek; Schmidt, Sarah; Lehmann-Koch, Judith; Over, Benjamin; Goffinet, Christine; Harter, Christoph; Bekeredjian-Ding, Isabelle; Sertel, Serkan; Lasitschka, Felix; Keppler, Oliver T",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1101684108; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21808013/,360

114824,"""It's Like Learning by the Seat of Your Pants"": Surgeons Lack Formal Training in Opioid Prescribing.",2020-09-08,"Although the levels of micropollutants in landfill leachate and municipal wastewater are well-established, the individual removal mechanisms and the fate of micropollutants throughout a landfill leachate treatment plant (LTP) were seldom investigated. Therefore, the determination of the removal efficiencies and the fates of micropollutants in a full-scale leachate treatment plant located in the largest city of Turkey were aimed in this study. Some important processes, such as equalization pond, bioreactor, ultrafiltration (UF) and nanofiltration (NF), are being operated in the treatment plant. Landfill leachate was characterized as an intense pollution source of macro and micropollutants compared to other water types. Chemical oxygen demand (COD), NH3, suspended solids (SS) and electrical conductivity (EC) values of the landfill leachate (and their removal efficiencies in the treatment plant) were determined as 18,656 ± 12,098 mg/L (98%), 3090 ± 845 mg/L (99%), 4175 ± 1832 mg/L (95%) and 31 ± 2 mS/cm (51%), respectively. Within the scope of the study, the most frequently and abundantly detected micropollutants in the treatment plant were found as heavy metals (8 ± 1.7 mg/L), VOCs (38 ± 2 μg/L), alkylphenols (9 ± 3 μg/L) and phthalates (8 ± 3 μg/L) and the overall removal efficiencies of these micropollutants ranged from -11% to 100% in the treatment processes. The main removal mechanism of VOCs in the aerobic treatment process has been found as the volatilization due to Henry constants greater than 100 Pa·m3/mol. However, the molecular weight cut off restriction of UF membrane has caused to less or negative removal efficiencies for some VOCs. The biological treatment unit which consists of sequential anoxic and oxic units (A/O) was found effective on the removal of PAHs (62%) and alkylphenols (87%). It was inferred that both NO3 accumulation in anoxic reactor, high hydraulic retention time (HRT) and sludge retention time (SRT) in aerobic reactor provide higher biodegradation and volatilization efficiencies as compared to the literature. Membrane processes were more effective on the removal of alkylphenols (60-80%) and pesticides (59-74%) in terms of influent and effluent loads of each unit. Removal efficiencies for Cu, Ni and Cr, which were the dominant heavy metals, were determined as 92, 91 and 51%, respectively and the main removal mechanism for heavy metals has thought to be coprecipitation of suspended solids by microbial biopolymers in the bioreactor and the separation of colloids during membrane filtration. Total effluent loads of the LTP for VOCs, semi volatiles and heavy metals were 1.0 g/day, 5.2 g/day and 1.5 kg/day, respectively. It has been concluded that the LTP was effectively removing both conventional pollutants and micropollutants with the specific operation costs of 0.27 $/(kg of removed COD), 0.13 $/(g of removed VOCs), 0.35 $/(g of removed SVOCs) and 2.6 $/(kg of removed metals).","Argun, Mehmet Emin; Akkuş, Mehmet; Ateş, Havva",The Science of the total environment,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.141423; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32818893/,360

INTRODUCTION Disasters can have catastrophic impacts on society and are broadly classified into natural events, man-made incidents, or a mixture of both. The PHCPs working in rural and remote communities face additional challenges when dealing with disasters and have significant roles during the Prevention, Preparedness, Response, and Recovery (PPRR) stages of disaster management. METHODS A Johanna Briggs Institute (JBI) scoping review methodology was utilized, and the search was conducted over seven electronic databases according to a priori protocol. RESULTS Forty-one papers were included and sixty-one roles were identified across the four stages of disaster management. The majority of disasters described within the literature were natural events and pandemics. Before a disaster occurs, PHCPs can build individual resilience through education. As recognized and respected leaders within their community, PHCPs are invaluable in assisting with disaster preparedness through being involved in organizations' planning policies and contributing to natural disaster and pandemic surveillance. Key roles during the response stage include accommodating patient surge, triage, maintaining the health of the remaining population, instituting infection control, and ensuring a team-based approach to mental health care during the disaster. In the aftermath and recovery stage, rural and remote PHCPs provide long-term follow up, assisting patients in accessing post-disaster support including delivery of mental health care. CONCLUSION Rural and remote PHCPs play significant roles within their community throughout the continuum of disaster management. As a consequence of their flexible scope of practice, PHCPs are well-placed to be involved during all stages of disaster, from building of community resilience and contributing to early alert of pandemics, to participating in the direct response when a disaster occurs and leading the way to recovery.","Willson, Katie A; FitzGerald, Gerard J; Lim, David",Prehospital and disaster medicine,https://doi.org/10.1017/s1049023x21000200; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33678209/,360

Twenty-four hours later, a two-port laparoscopy was performed using a near-infrared (NIR) laparoscope. The magnet position in the jejunum was detected with the transluminal fluorescence of the dye. Magnetic interaction with the metallic tip of the laparoscopic grasper allowed to capture the ring and bring the bowel loop to the future anastomotic site on the gastric wall. The proximal magnet was inserted into the stomach endoscopically and released when magnetic interaction started, allowing for a precise connection with the distal ring. The animals were followed up for 12 days and underwent control endoscopies and radiograms. In the acute animals, the anastomotic procedure was repeated 24 times. Finally, the procedure was performed in the human anatomical specimen. RESULTS There were no technical problems, and magnetic connection could be precisely directed at both the anterior and posterior gastric walls. No complications occurred during the survival period and the anastomoses were patent on day 5. Transluminal fluorescence enabled a rapid detection of the magnet. CONCLUSIONS Hybrid-reduced port magnetic gastrojejunostomy using a pair of fluorescently coated magnetic rings was feasible, reproducible, and easy to perform in both porcine and cadaver models.","Watanabe, Ryohei; Barberio, Manuel; Kanaji, Shingo; Lapergola, Alfonso; Ashoka, Anila Hoskere; Andreiuk, Bohdan; Guerriero, Ludovica; Pizzicannella, Margherita; Seeliger, Barbara; Saida, Yoshihisa; Kaneko, Hironori; Worreth, Marc; Saadi, Alend; Marescaux, Jacques; Klymchenko, Andrey S; Diana, Michele",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-019-06963-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31317330/,360

We assessed the ability of various combinations of National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) subitems and published stroke scales (i.e., RACE scale, 3I-SS, sNIHSS-8, sNIHSS-5, sNIHSS-1, mNIHSS, a-NIHSS items profiles A-E, CPSS1, CPSS2, and CPSSS) to predict LVO on CT or MR arteriography in 1085 consecutive patients (39.4 % women, mean age 67.7 years) with anterior circulation strokes within 6 h of symptom onset. 657 patients (61 %) had an occlusion of the internal carotid artery or the M1/M2 segment of the middle cerebral artery. Best cut-off value of the total NIHSS score to predict LVO was 7 (PPV 84.2 %, sensitivity 81.0 %, specificity 76.6 %, NPV 72.4 %, ACC 79.3 %). Receiver operating characteristic curves of various combinations of NIHSS subitems and published scores were equally or less predictive to show LVO than the total NIHSS score. At intersection of sensitivity and specificity curves in all scores, at least 1/5 of patients with LVO were missed. Best odds ratios for LVO among NIHSS subitems were best gaze (9.6, 95 %-CI 6.765-13.632), visual fields (7.0, 95 %-CI 3.981-12.370), motor arms (7.6, 95 %-CI 5.589-10.204), and aphasia/neglect (7.1, 95 %-CI 5.352-9.492). There is a significant correlation between clinical scores based on the NIHSS score and LVO on arteriography. However, if clinically relevant thresholds are applied to the scores, a sizable number of LVOs are missed. Therefore, clinical scores cannot replace vessel imaging.","Heldner, Mirjam R; Hsieh, Kety; Broeg-Morvay, Anne; Mordasini, Pasquale; Bühlmann, Monika; Jung, Simon; Arnold, Marcel; Mattle, Heinrich P; Gralla, Jan; Fischer, Urs",Journal of neurology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00415-016-8180-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27272907/,360

However, present experimental methods have only been able to study a few physico-chemical properties for a few excipient lots due to time, cost, and sample gathering considerations. An alternative analysis method is proposed here that shows how quantitative physico-chemical property data reported in vendor certificates of analysis can evaluate excipient lot-to-lot variability in a comprehensive and low cost manner. Microcrystalline cellulose, spray-dried lactose, and magnesium stearate were selected as commonly-used excipients for this demonstration. The proposed analysis method offers drug product developers several advantages over present experimental methods, including the ability to: (1) examine excipient products for manufacturing site and/or year-to-year variations, (2) quantify a domain of prior experience for each excipient by determining the percentage of excipient lots contained within a multi-dimensional ellipsoid described by the excipient lots used during drug product development, and (3) rationally select excipient lots from the vendors inventory to maximize the domain of prior experience throughout the drug development process. For cases where certificate of analysis data may contain insufficient information, drug product developers and excipient vendors should work together to identify more appropriate datasets for analysis.","Kushner, Joseph",Pharmaceutical development and technology,https://doi.org/10.3109/10837450.2011.604784; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21877870/,360

In this study, a PcIFN-α gene was amplified, which encoded a protein of 193 amino acids with a 26-amino acid signal peptide sharing 72.16-95.70% identity with other avians in Aves. After expression in prokaryote, PcIFN-α was analyzed for its physicochemical property and antiviral activity. Intriguingly, compared with chicken IFN-α, an effective viral infection therapeutic agent, PcIFN-α showed superior anti-VSV, NDV, and AIV activities, which were then abrogated by rabbit anti-PcIFN-α antibodies in vitro. Moreover, PcIFN-α was shown to be highly sensitive to trypsin; however, it remained stable despite changes in pH and temperature. Additionally, PcIFN-α induced the transcriptional or translational levels of Mx1 and ISG12 genes time-dependently.

Patients and Methods We searched MEDLINE and other databases from inception through April 30, 2020, as well as bibliography of articles selected for data extraction. We selected observational studies reporting the magnitude of the association of at least 1 risk factor (demographic characteristics, lifestyle factors, clinical risk factors, or biomarkers) with premature MI and a control group. Pooled risk estimates (random effects) from all studies unadjusted and adjusted for risk factors were reported as summary odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs. Results From 35,320 articles of 12.7 million participants, we extracted data on 19 risk factors from 77 studies across 58 countries. Men had a higher risk of premature MI (OR, 2.39; 95% CI, 1.71 to 3.35) than did women. Family history of cardiac disease was associated with a higher risk of premature MI (OR, 2.67; 95% CI, 2.29 to 3.27). Major modifiable risk factors associated with higher risk were current smoking (OR, 4.34; 95% CI, 3.68 to 5.12 vs no/former), diabetes mellitus (OR, 3.54; 95% CI, 2.69 to 4.65), dyslipidemia (OR, 2.94; 95% CI, 1.76 to 4.91), and hypertension (OR, 2.85; 95% CI, 2.48 to 3.27). Higher body mass index carried higher risk (OR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.24 to 1.71 for ≥25 kg/m2 vs <25 kg/m2). Biomarkers associated with 2- to 3-fold higher risk were total cholesterol levels greater than 200 mg/dL, triglyceride levels higher than 150 mg/dL, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels less than 60 mg/dL (to convert to mmol/L, multiply by 0.0259). Conclusion Major risk factors for premature MI are mostly amenable to patient, population, and policy level interventions. Mild elevations in body mass index and triglyceride levels were associated with higher risk, which has implications for the growing worldwide epidemic of cardiometabolic diseases.","Dugani, Sagar B; Hydoub, Yousif M; Ayala, Ana Patricia; Reka, Roger; Nayfeh, Tarek; Ding, Jingyi Francess; McCafferty, Shannon N; Alzuabi, Muayad; Farwati, Medhat; Murad, M Hassan; Alsheikh-Ali, Alawi A; Mora, Samia","Mayo Clinic proceedings.

This study characterized PHEV infection, pathogenesis, and immune response in caesarean-derived, colostrum-deprived (CDCD) neonatal pigs. Infected animals developed mild respiratory, enteric, and neurological clinical signs between 2 to 13 days post oronasal inoculation (dpi). PHEV did not produce viremia, but virus shedding was detected in nasal secretions (1-10 dpi) and feces (2-7 dpi) by RT-qPCR. Viral RNA was detected in all tissues except liver, but the detection rate and RT-qPCR Ct values decreased over time. The highest concentration of virus was detected in inoculated piglets necropsied at 5 dpi in turbinate and trachea, followed by tonsils, lungs, tracheobronchial lymph nodes, and stomach. The most representative microscopic lesions were gastritis lymphoplasmacytic, moderate, multifocal, with perivasculitis, and neuritis with ganglia degeneration. A moderate inflammatory response, characterized by increased levels of IFN-α in plasma (5 dpi) and infiltration of T lymphocytes and macrophages was also observed. Increased plasma levels of IL-8 were detected at 10 and 15 dpi, coinciding with the progressive resolution of the infection. Moreover, a robust antibody response was detected by 10 dpi. An ex vivo air-liquid CDCD-derived porcine respiratory cells culture (ALI-PRECs) system showed virus replication in ALI-PRECs and cytopathic changes and disruption of ciliated columnar epithelia, thereby confirming the tracheal epithelia as a primary site of infection for PHEV.IMPORTANCEAmong the ∼46 virus species in the Family Coronaviridae (2019), many of which are important pathogens of humans and 6 of which are commonly found in pigs, porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis remains one of the least researched.

This study aims to measure France's global competitiveness for international clinical trials (CT) and assess its strengths and areas of excellence. METHODS A descriptive and comparative analysis was conducted using the data from both the ClinicalTrials.gov registry for the 2015-2019 period and those reported in a national web-based database (OSCAR) involving the major pharmaceutical companies operating in France in 2018-2019. OSCAR allows to describe the administrative authorization and starting process for all drug trials conducted in France. RESULTS Among 8607 worldwide drug trials initiated in 2019, 34.3% (n=2.954) were funded exclusively by pharmaceutical companies (52.1% in France). On average, France was involved in 10.5% of all global industrial CTs launched over 2018-2019, still ranking in the 4th position among European countries. Early-phase trials represented 17.3% of trials conducted by the drug companies in France, versus 25% in Germany and 29% in United Kingdom. Oncology remains an area of excellence in France with 18.7% of all worldwide CTs conducted in this therapeutic area over the study period involving at least some French centres, ranking France 2nd among European countries. The median of total deadline before the first patient inclusion of 204 days in 2018-2019 with no marked improvement as compared to 2016-2017 period.

METHODS AND RESULTS Five randomized controlled trials encompassing 10,350 patients were included. Primary efficacy and safety endpoints were all-cause death and major bleeding, respectively. All-cause death at 30 days did not significantly differ with bivalirudin compared to heparin (odds ratio (OR) 0.97, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.74-1.28; P=0.84). Major bleeding was significantly reduced by bivalirudin compared to heparin (OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.40-0.85; P=0.005). Bivalirudin use was associated with non-significantly different rates of 30-day definite stent thrombosis (ST) (OR 1.71, 95% CI 0.84-3.49; P=0.14), albeit with higher rates of acute ST (OR 3.55, 95% CI 1.67-7.56; P=0.001) and non-significantly different rates of subacute ST (OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.46-1.61; P=0.64). There were non-significant differences in the 30-day rates of reinfarction (OR 1.47, 95% CI 0.94-2.30; P=0.10) and cardiovascular death (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.56-1.02; P=0.07). There were no significant interactions between bailout versus routine GPI use in the heparin arm for any of the safety or efficacy outcomes (all Pinteraction>0.10). CONCLUSIONS Bivalirudin compared with heparin was associated with comparable 30-day rates of mortality with reduced major bleeding, at the price of an increased risk of acute ST, with non-significant differences in the overall 30-day rates of ST and reinfarction. Intended use of GPI in the heparin arm did not significantly modify the treatment effects of bivalirudin. Given the important differences between trials, as well as evolution in technique and adjunct pharmacotherapy, further randomized trials are warranted to discriminate whether there are substantial safety and efficacy differences between these agents during primary PCI in STEMI.","Capodanno, Davide; Gargiulo, Giuseppe; Capranzano, Piera; Mehran, Roxana; Tamburino, Corrado; Stone, Gregg W",European heart journal.

135139,A Multi-Brain Framework for Social Interaction.,2020-07-22,"BACKGROUND Referral networks are critical in the timely delivery of surgical care, particularly for populations residing in rural areas who have limited access to specialist services. However, in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) referral networks are often undermined by systemic inefficiencies. If equitable access to essential surgical services is to be achieved, sound evidence is needed to ensure efficient patient care pathways. The aim of this scoping review was to investigate current knowledge regarding inter-hospital surgical referral systems in LMICs to identify the main obstacles to their functioning and to critically assess proposed solutions. METHODS MEDLINE, EMBASE and Global Health databases and grey literature were systematically searched to identify relevant studies. The search generated 2261 unique records, of which 14 studies were selected for inclusion in the review. The narrative synthesis of retrieved data is based on a conceptual framework developed though a thematic analysis approach. RESULTS Multiple shortages in surgical infrastructure, equipment and personnel, as well as gaps in surgical and decision-making skills of clinicians at sending hospitals, act as obstacles to safe and appropriate referrals. Comprehensive protocols for surgical referrals are lacking in most LMICs and established patient pathways, when in place, are not correctly followed. Interventions to improve coordination and communication between different level facilities may enhance efficiency of referral pathways. Strengthening capacity of referring hospitals to manage more surgical conditions locally could improve outcomes, decrease the need for referral and reduce the burden on tertiary facilities. DISCUSSION The field of surgical referrals is still an uncharted territory and the limited empirical evidence available is of low quality. Developing strategies for assessing functionality and effectiveness of referral systems in surgery is essential to improve access, coverage and quality of services in resource-limited settings, as well as overall health systems performance.","Pittalis, Chiara; Brugha, Ruairi; Gajewski, Jakub",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0223328; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31560716/,360

METHODS Among 141 patients who underwent surgery for PSP from July 2009 to December 2013, a total of 100 patients underwent SITS. Their data were examined for clinical characteristics and surgical results. RESULTS More patients with younger age, female sex, and who had social indications were treated by SITS than by three-port video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS). The mean operative time for SITS was 48.8 min. There were no conversions from SITS to three-port VATS or thoracotomy. After SITS, the median duration of chest drainage was 1 day, and the median hospital stay was 2 days. Early complications included one surgical-site infection and one case of air leakage. Four patients (4.0%) had ipsilateral recurrence of PSP. CONCLUSION SITS is feasible when performed for selected patients with PSP. Long-term follow-up and further examinations are required to evaluate patient selection, efficacy, and comparability of SITS with conventional open and three-port VATS approaches.","Yamazaki, Koji; Haratake, Naoki; Shikada, Yasunori; Mori, Ryo; Kouso, Hidenori; Shoji, Fumihiro; Takeo, Sadanori",Annals of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery : official journal of the Association of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgeons of Asia,https://doi.org/10.5761/atcs.oa.15-00063; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26073140/,360

Reply.,2020-12-30,"INTRODUCTION Body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC) cut-offs associated with hyperglycemia may differ by ethnicity. We investigated the optimal BMI and WC cut-offs for identifying hyperglycemia in the predominantly Afro-Caribbean population of Barbados. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS A cross-sectional study of 865 individuals aged ≥25 years without known diabetes or cardiovascular disease was conducted. Hyperglycemia was defined as fasting plasma glucose ≥5.6 mmol/L or hemoglobin A1c ≥5.7% (39 mmol/mol). The Youden index was used to identify the optimal cut-offs from the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Further ROC analysis and multivariable log binomial regression were used to compare standard and data-derived cut-offs. RESULTS The prevalence of hyperglycemia was 58.9% (95% CI 54.7% to 63.0%). In women, optimal BMI and WC cut-offs (27 kg/m2 and 87 cm, respectively) performed similarly to standard cut-offs. In men, sensitivities of the optimal cut-offs of BMI ≥24 kg/m2 (72.0%) and WC ≥86 cm (74.0%) were higher than those for standard BMI and WC obesity cut-offs (30.0% and 25%-46%, respectively), although with lower specificity.

CONCLUSIONS While BMI and WC cut-offs in Afro-Caribbean women approximate international standards, our findings, consistent with other studies, suggest lowering cut-offs in men may be warranted to improve detection of hyperglycemia.

140721,Defending 'snake oil': The preservation of contentious knowledge and practices.,2021-02-23,"UNLABELLED The herpes simplex virus (HSV) virion host shutoff (vhs) RNase destabilizes cellular and viral mRNAs, suppresses host protein synthesis, dampens antiviral responses, and stimulates translation of viral mRNAs. vhs mutants display a host range phenotype: translation of viral true late mRNAs is severely impaired and stress granules accumulate in HeLa cells, while translation proceeds normally in Vero cells. We found that vhs-deficient virus activates the double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase R (PKR) much more strongly than the wild-type virus does in HeLa cells, while PKR is not activated in Vero cells, raising the possibility that PKR might play roles in stress granule induction and/or inhibiting translation in restrictive cells. We tested this possibility by evaluating the effects of inactivating PKR. Eliminating PKR in HeLa cells abolished stress granule formation but had only minor effects on viral true late protein levels. These results document an essential role for PKR in stress granule formation by a nuclear DNA virus, indicate that induction of stress granules is the consequence rather than the cause of the translational defect, and are consistent with our previous suggestion that vhs promotes translation of viral true late mRNAs by preventing mRNA overload rather than by suppressing eIF2α phosphorylation. IMPORTANCE The herpes simplex virus vhs RNase plays multiple roles during infection, including suppressing PKR activation, inhibiting the formation of stress granules, and promoting translation of viral late mRNAs. A key question is the extent to which these activities are mechanistically connected. Our results demonstrate that PKR is essential for stress granule formation in the absence of vhs, but at best, it plays a secondary role in suppressing translation of viral mRNAs. Thus, the ability of vhs to promote translation of viral mRNAs can be largely uncoupled from PKR suppression, demonstrating that this viral RNase modulates at least two distinct aspects of RNA metabolism.","Dauber, Bianca; Poon, David; Dos Santos, Theodore; Duguay, Brett A; Mehta, Ninad; Saffran, Holly A; Smiley, James R",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.03180-15; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27099317/,360
141420,Narrative Gerontology in Practice: Students' Experiences With Conducting Autoethnography.,2020-05-25,"For individuals aspiring to a career in otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, mentorship can shape destiny. Mentorship helps assure safe passage into the specialty, and it influences the arc of professional development across the career continuum. Even before the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, technology and social networking were transforming mentorship in otolaryngology. Now, in an increasingly virtual world, where in-person interactions are the exception, mentorship plays an even more pivotal role. Mentors serve as trusted guides, helping learners navigate accelerating trends toward early specialization, competency-based assessments, and key milestones. However, several structural barriers render the playing field unlevel. For medical students, cancellation of visiting clerkships, in-person rotations, and other face-to-face interactions may limit access to mentors. The pandemic and virtual landscape particularly threaten the already-leaky pipeline for underrepresented medical students. These challenges may persist into residency and later career stages, where structural inequities continue to subtly influence opportunities and pairings of mentors and mentees. Hence, overreliance on serendipitous encounters can exacerbate disparities, even amid societal mandates for equity. The decision to take deliberate steps toward mentoring outreach and engagement has profound implications for what otolaryngology will look like in years to come. This article introduces the concept of new age mentoring, shining a light on how to modernize practices. The key shifts are from passive to active engagement; from amorphous to structured relationships; and from hierarchical dynamics to bidirectional mentoring. Success is predicated on intentional outreach and purposefulness in championing diversity, equity, and inclusion in the progressively technology-driven landscape.","Ahmadmehrabi, Shadi; Farlow, Janice L; Wamkpah, Nneoma S; Esianor, Brandon I; Brenner, Michael J; Valdez, Tulio A; Malekzadeh, Sonya; Bradford, Carol R; Francis, Howard W",JAMA otolaryngology-- head & neck surgery,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaoto.2020.5448; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33538788/,360

METHODS Thirty-six caregivers (64.94 ± 13.54 years, 41.7% female) of individuals with NCD (74.28 ± 6.76 years, 66.7% female) selected from the Body & Brain exercise program were interviewed over the phone. The following instruments were used: Barthel Index (BI) to assess care recipients' ability to function independently on activities of daily living (ADL), the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) to evaluate neuropsychiatric symptoms, and the CarerQol-7D/ CarerQol-VAS to determine caregiver subjective burden/well-being. RESULTS Pre and post-confinement comparisons showed that care recipients significantly declined their independence in ADL (p = 0.003) and increased NPI total score (MD = 5.72; 95% CI: 1.19 to 10.25, p = 0.015). As for caregivers, results also showed an increased caregiving burden (MD = -0.17; 95% CI: -0.27 to -0.08; p = 0.001) and a decline in their well-being (p = 0.015).

The aim at this study is to explore psycho-social factors of female adolescents with high depressive symptomatology and gender differences in depressive symptoms among Chinese adolescents. METHOD We examined 4100 adolescents from Wuhan city and Jianli county via a cross-sectional study. Depressive symptomatology was screened through the Chinese version of Center for Epidemiology Studies Depression Scale. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to explore the factors related to high depressive symptomatology in female and male adolescents, respectively. RESULTS The prevalence of high depressive symptomatology in female and male were 38.9 and 30.2% respectively. The psycho-social factors of high depressive symptomatology in female adolescents were age (Adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.201, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.076 ~ 1.341), single parent family (aOR = 2.004, 95%CI, 1.448 ~ 2.772) and fathers' education level (compared to primary school and below, [Junior middle school, aOR = 0.641, 95%CI, 0.439 ~ 0.934; Senior middle school, aOR = 0.603, 95%CI, 0.410 ~ 0.888; College degree and above, aOR = 0.639, 95%CI, 0.437 ~ 0.936]).

We investigated the safety and efficacy of single-unit CBT (SCBT)-retrieving the thrombus as a single unit with SR and AC into the guide catheter-compared with single use of either SR or contact aspiration (CA). METHODS We analysed 763 consecutive patients who underwent mechanical thrombectomy for AIS between January 2013 and January 2020, at six comprehensive stroke centers. Patients were divided into SCBT and single device (SR/CA) groups. The successful recanalization with first pass (SRFP) and other procedural outcomes were compared between groups. RESULTS Overall, 240 SCBT and 301 SR/CA (SR 128, CA 173) patients were analyzed. SRFP (modified Thrombolysis In Cerebral Infarction (mTICI) ≥2c, 43.3% vs 27.9%, p<0.001; mTICI 3, 35.8% vs 25.5%, p=0.009) and final mTICI ≥2b recanalization (89.1% vs 82.0%, p=0.020) rates were significantly higher, puncture-to-reperfusion time was shorter (median (IQR) 43 (31.5-69) vs 55 (38-82.2) min, p<0.001), and the number of passes were fewer (mean±SD 1.72±0.92 vs 1.99±1.01, p<0.001) in the SCBT group. Procedural complications were similar between the groups. In subgroup analysis, SCBT was more effective in women, cardioembolic stroke patients, and internal carotid artery and M2 occlusions.

UVC LED array treatment effectively inactivated viral infectivity, achieving 5-log reductions within 45 mJ/cm2 for MS2, Qβ, and ϕX174 viruses. UVC LED array effectiveness in inactivating Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Listeria monocytogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus aerosols achieved 2.5- to 4-log reductions within 1.5 to 4.6 mJ/cm2 Also, 4-log reductions of Aspergillus flavus and Alternaria japonica were achieved at a dosage of 23 mJ/cm2 using UVC LED array irradiation. The highest UV susceptibility, represented by the inactivation rate constant, was calculated for bacteria, followed by fungi and viruses. UVC LED, an innovative technology, can effectively inactivate microorganisms regardless of taxonomic classification and can sufficiently substitute for conventional mercury UV lamps.IMPORTANCE The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) convened the Minamata Convention on Mercury in 2013 to ban mercury-containing products in order to ensure human and environmental health. It will be effectuated in 2020 to discontinue use of low-pressure mercury lamps and new UV-emitting sources have to replace this conventional technology. However, the UV germicidal irradiation (UVGI) system still uses conventional UV lamps, and no research has been conducted for air disinfection using UVC LEDs. The research reported here investigated the inactivation effect of aerosolized microorganisms, including viruses, bacteria, and fungi, with an UVC LED module. The results can be utilized as a primary database to replace conventional UV lamps with UVC LEDs, a novel type of UV emitter. Implementation of UVC LED technology is truly expected to significantly reduce the extent of global mercury contamination, and this study provides important baseline data to help ensure a healthier environment and increased health for humanity.","Kim, Do-Kyun; Kang, Dong-Hyun",Applied and environmental microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1128/aem.00944-18; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29959245/,360

X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, UCL spectrum, UCL lifetime, and pump power dependence are adhibited for characterization. Compared with the former work, except for a smaller total size, tunable emission in color from red to yellow to green, and intensity from low to stronger than that of traditional UCNPs is achieved for ≈10 nm NaHoF4 core size by means of changing number of layers and Gd3+ /Yb3+ concentration ratios in different layers. Besides, simultaneously doping Ho3+ into the shells will result in lowered UCL intensity and lifted green/red ratio. Surface energy loss and sensitizing energy supply, which can be modulated with inert shielding of Gd3+ and sensitization of Yb3+ , are proved to be the essential determinant. More UCL properties of these peculiar Ho@Yb UCNPs are uncovered and detailedly summarized, and the findings can help to expand the application scope of NaHoF4 into photoinduced therapy.","Kuang, Ye; Li, Tianyao; Jia, Tao; Gulzar, Arif; Zhong, Chongna; Gai, Shili; He, Fei; Yang, Piaoping; Lin, Jun",Small,https://doi.org/10.1002/smll.202003799; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33006248/,360

SARS-CoV-2 mainly affects the tissues expressing angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2). ACE2 is used as a receptor for the virus to enter the cells. Once SARS-CoV-2 enters the cells, it leads to further events through signaling pathways. This pathophysiological condition can appear as changes in laboratory tests. METHOD However, the lack of studies in this area is strongly felt. The present study was conducted to review the most common abnormalities in laboratory tests caused by COVID-19 and their related molecular pathways and outcomes. RESULTS It showed that the levels of IL-6, CRP, PCT, AST/ALT, bilirubin, ALP, GGT, LDH, ferritin, D-dimer, and neutrophils increased. Conversely, the levels of albumin and lymphocytes decreased. Since most of these parameters were related to hepatic function, their alterations indicated liver injury. CONCLUSIONS Overall, the parameters CRP, D-dimer, and CBC are more important in diagnosis. Moreover, it seems that MAPK and NF-κB are the most frequent signaling pathways in which alterations may contribute to the pathogenesis of the virus. Altogether, our review encourages researchers to study signaling pathways as potential molecular targets to achieve effective treatment.","Saberiyan, Mohammadreza; Safi, Amir; Kamel, Ali; Movahhed-Abbasabad, Parvaneh; Miralimalek, Mahdiye; Afkhami, Hamed; Khaledi, Mansoor; Teimori, Hossein",Clinical laboratory,https://doi.org/10.7754/clin.lab.2020.200705; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33073969/,360
147467,"Development of a radioiodinated apoptosis-inducing ligand, rhTRAIL, and a radiolabelled agonist TRAIL receptor antibody for clinical imaging studies.",2012,"BACKGROUND Cognitive deficits after perinatal anesthetic exposure are well established outcomes in animal models. This vulnerability is sex-dependent and associated with expression levels of the chloride transporters NKCC1 and KCC2. The hypothesis was that androgen signaling, NKCC1 function, and the age of isoflurane exposure are critical for the manifestation of anesthetic neurotoxicity in male rats. METHODS Flutamide, an androgen receptor antagonist, was administered to male rats on postnatal days 2, 4, and 6 before 6 h of isoflurane on postnatal day 7 (ntotal = 26). Spatial and recognition memory were subsequently tested in adulthood. NKCC1 and KCC2 protein levels were measured from cortical lysates by Western blot on postnatal day 7 (ntotal = 20). Bumetanide, an NKCC1 antagonist, was injected immediately before isoflurane exposure (postnatal day 7) to study the effect of NKCC1 inhibition (ntotal = 48). To determine whether male rats remain vulnerable to anesthetic neurotoxicity as juveniles, postnatal day 14 animals were exposed to isoflurane and assessed as adults (ntotal = 30). RESULTS Flutamide-treated male rats exposed to isoflurane successfully navigated the spatial (Barnes maze probe trial F[1, 151] = 78; P < 0.001; mean goal exploration ± SD, 6.4 ± 3.9 s) and recognition memory tasks (mean discrimination index ± SD, 0.09 ± 0.14; P = 0.003), unlike isoflurane-exposed controls. Flutamide changed expression patterns of NKCC1 (mean density ± SD: control, 1.49 ± 0.69; flutamide, 0.47 ± 0.11; P < 0.001) and KCC2 (median density [25th percentile, 75th percentile]: control, 0.23 [0.13, 0.49]; flutamide, 1.47 [1.18,1.62]; P < 0.001). Inhibiting NKCC1 with bumetanide was protective for spatial memory (probe trial F[1, 162] = 6.6; P = 0.011; mean goal time, 4.6 [7.4] s). Delaying isoflurane exposure until postnatal day 14 in males preserved spatial memory (probe trial F[1, 140] = 28; P < 0.001; mean goal time, 6.1 [7.0] s). CONCLUSIONS Vulnerability to isoflurane neurotoxicity is abolished by blocking the androgen receptor, disrupting the function of NKCC1, or delaying the time of exposure to at least 2 weeks of age in male rats. These results support a dynamic role for androgens and chloride transporter proteins in perinatal anesthetic neurotoxicity.

However, innovations often end up in what is popularly termed as the ""valley of death"" between upstream creation and downstream product development and implementation. Consequently, the benefits of innovation do not always reach the citizens. In addition, critically informed governance of innovations matter because it allows steering of innovations in response to the values and end points desired by society.

METHODS A manikin, connected to a test lung set at 2 breathing frequencies (20 and 30 breaths/min), was ventilated in pressure support ventilation (PSV) mode with 2 different settings, randomly applied, of the ratio of pressurization time to expiratory trigger time (T(press)/T(exp-trigger)) 50%/25%, default setting, and T(press)/T(exp-trigger) 80%/60%, fast setting, through a helmet. The helmet was connected to the ventilator randomly with the double and the standard circuit. We measured inspiratory trigger delay (T(insp-delay)), expiratory trigger delay (T(exp-delay)), T(press)), time of synchrony (T(synch)), trigger pressure drop, inspiratory pressure-time product (PTP), PTP at 300 ms and 500 ms, and PTP at 500 ms expressed as percentage of an ideal PTP500 (PTP500 index). RESULTS At both breathing frequencies and ventilator settings, helmet NIV with the double tube circuit showed better patient-ventilator interaction, with shorter T(insp-delay), T(exp-delay), and T(press); longer T(synch); and higher PTP300, PTP500, and PTP500 index (all P < .01). CONCLUSIONS The double tube circuit had significantly better patient-ventilator interaction and a lower rate of wasted effort at 30 breaths/min.","Ferrone, Giuliano; Cipriani, Flora; Spinazzola, Giorgia; Festa, Olimpia; Arcangeli, Andrea; Proietti, Rodolfo; Antonelli, Massimo; Conti, Giorgio; Costa, Roberta",Respiratory care,https://doi.org/10.4187/respcare.02060; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23431311/,360
150109,Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children During Induction Chemotherapy in a Newly Diagnosed Pediatric Acute Myeloid Leukemia and Concurrent COVID-19.,2021-06-16,"Chronic pain after peripheral nerve injury is associated with afferent hyperexcitability and upregulation of hyperpolarization-activated, cyclic nucleotide-regulated (HCN)-mediated IH pacemaker currents in sensory neurons. HCN channels thus constitute an attractive target for treating chronic pain. HCN channels are ubiquitously expressed; analgesics targeting HCN1-rich cells in the peripheral nervous system must spare the cardiac pacemaker current (carried mostly by HCN2 and HCN4) and the central nervous system (where all four isoforms are expressed). The alkylphenol general anesthetic propofol (2,6-di-iso-propylphenol) selectively inhibits HCN1 channels versus HCN2-HCN4 and exhibits a modest pharmacokinetic preference for the periphery. Consequently, we hypothesized that propofol, and congeners, should be antihyperalgesic. Alkyl-substituted propofol analogs have different rank-order potencies with respect to HCN1 inhibition, GABA(A) receptor (GABA(A)-R) potentiation, and general anesthesia. Thus, 2,6- and 2,4-di-tertbutylphenol (2,6- and 2,4-DTBP, respectively) are more potent HCN1 antagonists than propofol, whereas 2,6- and 2,4-di-sec-butylphenol (2,6- and 2,4-DSBP, respectively) are less potent. In contrast, DSBPs, but not DTBPs, enhance GABA(A)-R function and are general anesthetics. 2,6-DTBP retained propofol's selectivity for HCN1 over HCN2-HCN4. In a peripheral nerve ligation model of neuropathic pain, 2,6-DTBP and subhypnotic propofol are antihyperalgesic. The findings are consistent with these alkylphenols exerting analgesia via non-GABA(A)-R targets and suggest that antagonism of central HCN1 channels may be of limited importance to general anesthesia. Alkylphenols are hydrophobic, and thus potential modifiers of lipid bilayers, but their effects on HCN channels are due to direct drug-channel interactions because they have little bilayer-modifying effect at therapeutic concentrations. The alkylphenol antihyperalgesic target may be HCN1 channels in the damaged peripheral nervous system.","Tibbs, Gareth R; Rowley, Thomas J; Sanford, R Lea; Herold, Karl F; Proekt, Alex; Hemmings, Hugh C; Andersen, Olaf S; Goldstein, Peter A; Flood, Pamela D",The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,https://doi.org/10.1124/jpet.113.203620; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23549867/,360
150875,Radiofrequency ablation in a patient with radiation enteritis: A case report.,2018,"PURPOSE The adrenal gland is a common site of metastasis in patients with advanced cancer, but it is rarely symptomatic. A subset of patients develop a complex pain syndrome with anorexia, nausea, and poorly localized visceral pain in the back, flank, or epigastric region. These symptoms can impact quality of life and are occasionally challenging to palliate. The role of palliative radiotherapy (PRT) in these patients is unclear. This population-based retrospective study evaluates PRT practices for patients with adrenal metastases and aims to describe treatment response and acute toxicity. METHODS AND MATERIALS Patients who received PRT to an adrenal metastasis between the years of 1985 and 2015 were identified in a XXX database. Patient demographics, tumor factors, symptom burden, radiotherapy prescriptions and response to treatment were collected. Variables were summarized using descriptive statistics. Kaplan-Meier was used to assess survival. Factors associated with clinical response were evaluated using univariate and logistic regression analysis. Factors associated with survival were evaluated using univariate and Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS One hundred patients who received 103 separate courses of PRT were identified. The majority had a lung primary (82%). The most common baseline symptoms were pain (90%) and gastrointestinal upset (13%). Prescriptions ranged from 600 cGy in a single fraction to 4500 cGy in 25 fractions. Seventy percent of patients experienced an improvement in pain (either a complete or partial response). Forty-three percent of patients developed acute toxicity from treatment. Median survival was 3 months. CONCLUSIONS Compared to other anatomic sites, conventional PRT is uncommonly delivered to adrenal metastases. Despite heterogeneity in tumor histology and radiotherapy prescriptions, treatment was associated with an overall pain response of 70%. Prophylactic anti-emetics to decrease radiation induced nausea are required prior to treatment. Given the poor prognosis of this population, short fractionations are indicated.","Parhar, Ravi; Livergant, Jonathan; Lefresne, Shilo","International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrobp.2020.12.038; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33385498/,360
151789,Nurses International Open Educational Resources for Global Impact.,2020-08-01,"INTRODUCTION Single incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) is established in many procedures but not in bariatric surgery. One explanation may be that SILS is technically demanding in morbidly obese patients. This report describes our technique and experience with single incision laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (SILAGB). METHODS Prospective data collection was performed on consecutive obese patients who underwent SILAGB between November 2009 and February 2011. A single 3 cm transverse incision in the right upper quadrant was used for a Covidien SILS™ multichannel access port. The technique is described with a standard pars flaccida approach and the 'tips and tricks' needed for a wide range of candidates using standard laparoscopic equipment. RESULTS A total of 29 patients (27 female) with a median body mass index of 41 kg/m(2) (range: 35-52 kg/m(2)) and median age of 44 years (range: 22-57 years) underwent SILAGB. There were no 'conversions' to a standard laparoscopic technique. Two cases required the addition of one single 5 mm port. The only complications were two postoperative wound infections (one with a port site infection requiring replacement of the port) and one faulty band requiring replacement. There were therefore two returns to theatre and no 30-day deaths. All patients were discharged on the first postoperative day.

153415,Message to the Food and Nutrition Bulletin Community.,2020-06-01,"BACKGROUND The lecture-based learning (LBL) implemented in most Indonesian nursing/midwifery schools underlies the students' lack of ability in clinical reasoning. Team-based learning (TBL) was proposed to improve the students' ability in clinical reasoning as it is applying a course concept of real complex scenarios. In this study, we aimed to assess and compare the effects of TBL and LBL of postpartum hemorrhage topics on the clinical reasoning and classroom engagement of midwifery students in Indonesia. METHODS We conducted a cluster randomized controlled trial to compare the effects of TBL and LBL. The unit was schools and random allocation was conducted using a simple random sampling method (i.e., coin flipping). There was 1 cluster in the intervention group (n = 62 students) and 1 cluster in the control group (n = 53 students). The students in the intervention group participated in a TBL class (90 min) three times, whereas the students in the control group attended an LBL class on postpartum hemorrhage topics. The primary outcome was the clinical reasoning on postpartum hemorrhage score measured at pre-test, post-test, and 2 weeks post-test. The secondary outcome was Classroom Engagement Survey (CES) score measured after each class finished. We used an unpaired t-test to evaluate the differences between the two groups. The baseline characteristics of the participants were compared using standardized difference. RESULTS We evaluated a total of 115 participants. Regarding the baseline characteristics, there was a small difference in the age, Grade Point Average and knowledge at pre-test between the intervention and control groups. The mean clinical reasoning on postpartum hemorrhage scores were significantly higher in the TBL students than in the LBL students at post-test (p < .001; Cohen's d = 1.41) and 2 weeks post-test (p < .001; Cohen's d = 1.50). The CES showed a significantly higher in the intervention group than in the control group. CONCLUSIONS TBL is an effective learning method for enhancing the clinical reasoning ability of students. This learning method allows for more independent and active learning. Having a strong background knowledge, and discussing cases comprehensively with peers can sharpen the clinical reasoning ability of students.","Ulfa, Yunefit; Igarashi, Yukari; Takahata, Kaori; Shishido, Eri; Horiuchi, Shigeko",BMC medical education,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12909-021-02881-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34419030/,360

The unchanged goal of the standard is to provide a uniform file format that allows files created by one type of acquisition hardware and software to be analyzed by any other type. The standard retains the overall FCS file structure and most features of previous versions, but also contains a few changes that were required to support new types of data and use cases efficiently. These changes are incompatible with existing FCS file readers. Notably, FCS 3.2 supports mixed data types to, for example, allow FCS measurements that are intrinsically integers (e.g., indices or class assignments) or measurements that are commonly captured as integers (e.g., time ticks) to be more represented as integer values, while capturing other measurements as floating-point values in the same FCS data set. In addition, keywords explicitly specifying dyes, detectors and analytes were added to avoid having to extract those heuristically and unreliably from measurement names. Types of measurements were formalized, several keywords added, others removed, or deprecated, and various aspects of the specification were clarified.

154276,Impact of transfer status on hospitalization cost and discharge disposition for acute ischemic stroke across the US.,2016,"INTRODUCTION Influenza-like illness (ILI) surveillance is usually performed using outpatient data, and information on the surveillance of patients hospitalised for ILI, which is critical for the complete assessment of the influenza burden, is lacking. METHODOLOGY In this prospective active surveillance study, patients with community-acquired ILI hospitalised for at least 24 hours in the Emergency Room (ER) of Gazi University Hospital were identified according to the ICD-10 codes at hospital admission through active surveillance of the 2013-2014 and 2014-2015 influenza seasons. The presence of influenza and other respiratory viruses was analysed in the nasopharyngeal or pharyngeal specimens by real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS 351 patients admitted to emergency room with certain ICD-10 codes were assessed, and 111 patients with ILI were included in the study. We detected 15 influenza and 23 other respiratory viruses in 33 of the 111 patients. More than one virus was detected in 5 patients. No virus was detected in a majority of the patients with ILI. The sensitivity of hospital admission/discharge ICD-10 codes used in the study to detect real influenza cases was low. Patients with influenza were admitted to the hospital more frequently with high fever symptoms compared with patients with influenza virus-negative and other respiratory virus-positive (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS This study revealed that non-influenza respiratory viruses were a major contributor to ILI. Patients admitted with fever during the influenza seasons should be evaluated for influenza virus infection, and the use of diagnostic codes in surveillance studies can lead to incorrect results.","Aysert-Yildiz, Pinar; Aktas, Firdevs",Journal of infection in developing countries,https://doi.org/10.3855/jidc.10893; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32087074/,360

Not only does eating correctly provide substantial physical benefits, it also ensures psychological comfort throughout admission. Nevertheless, our formative years as medical students, and now as junior doctors, have shown us that patient nutrition is frequently neglected both in the clinical setting and in the subject matter of our education.Amid the coronavirus pandemic, this is especially problematic; older, frailer patients, with multiple comorbidities and higher rates of malnutrition, are faring much worse with the virus. Combined with the fact that 40% of patients admitted to hospital are malnourished to some degree, we are looking at a huge population of potential COVID-19 patients facing a further decline in nutritional status and higher mortality as a result of this, making attention to nutrition more important than ever.As junior doctors, we have a role in the nutritional assessment of and support for our patients by ensuring that all patients are suitably assessed using a scoring tool with the appropriate ensuing actions taken.

157184,Opportunities in Chaos: Leveraging Innovation to Create a New Reality in Nursing Education.,2021-02-05,"BACKGROUND Tonsillectomy is one of the most common surgical procedures in pediatric patients. The tonsillar retractor, which is routinely used during a tonsillectomy, applies high pressure to the patient's tongue and can lead to various complications. AIMS This study aimed to explore tongue edema induced by the pressure applied by tonsillar retractor, using ultrasonography in pediatric patients undergoing tonsillectomy surgeries. MATERIALS AND METHODS Sixty-one patients were included in the study. The tonsillectomy group included 31 patients who underwent tonsillectomy surgery, while the control group included 30 patients who underwent inguinal hernia and circumcision surgery. Submental coronal plane ultrasonography examinations of the tongue were performed twice for each patient. In the tonsillectomy group, the first examination of tongue area (TA1) was done immediately after intubation but before the placement of tonsillar retractor. The second examination (TA2) was done at the end of the tonsillectomy surgery after the removal of the tonsillar retractor but before extubation. In the control group, the first examination (TA1) was done immediately after intubation, whereas the second examination (TA2) was done at the end of the surgery before extubation. These results were compared with those for the control group. RESULTS Groups were similar in terms of demographics and intubation duration. Groups did not significantly differ in terms of TA1 (P = .212), but they significantly differed in terms of TA2 (P = .000). They also significantly differed in terms of tongue edema defined as TA2 - TA1 (P = .000). CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE Tonsillar retractor does cause tongue edema in tonsillectomy surgeries. This tongue edema seems to be a result of the pressure applied by the tonsillar retractor. This study is the first to demonstrate the possible role of ultrasonography examination in determining the tonsillar retractor-induced tongue edema in pediatric patients.","Onal, Merih; Colpan, Bahar; Elsurer, Cagdas; Bozkurt, Mete Kaan; Ozturk, Mehmet; Onal, Ozkan; Turan, Alparslan","Ear, nose, & throat journal",https://doi.org/10.1177/0145561320934918; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32633658/,360
158448,Thermochemical valorization and characterization of household biowaste.,2017,"Cephalopods could simultaneously achieve both accurate positioning and agile bodily maneuvers by coordinating the mantle and the funnel, which is ideal for underwater robotic applications toward a compact propulsor with combined thrust vectoring and regulation. For a wide range of underwater applications from videography to manipulation, this novel approach would offer a compact and integrated alternative to the state-of-the-art with multiple vectoring thrusters. This article presents a biomimetic soft-robotic siphon (BSRS) as the propulsor unit, consisting of a novel central flow-regulative duct (CFRD) encircled by three circumferential siphon actuation muscles (SAMs). Hydraulic pressurization of the SAMs could enable both thrust vectoring by deflecting the BSRS and flow regulation by proportionally alternating the orifice of the CFRD. The design, modeling, and fabrication of the BSRS are presented in detail. Experiments using a prototype BSRS were conducted for validating the performances of deflection deformation and flow regulation, showing bending range of over 180° and flow-restricting capability of up to 100%. A burst effect was achieved with the ability of exceeding the constant flow rate by up to 50%, enabling tremendous thrust increase in very short time. This work proves the feasibility of combining omnidirectional deflection with flow regulation within a soft-robotic mechanism, paving the way to compact water-jetting propulsion for underwater robots.","Zhang, Runzhi; Shen, Zhong; Zhong, Hua; Tan, Jiyong; Hu, Yong; Wang, Zheng",Soft robotics,https://doi.org/10.1089/soro.2019.0152; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32758059/,360
160423,Isolation and Loneliness.,2021,"INTRODUCTION Current studies estimated a general incubation period distribution of COVID-19 based on early-confirmed cases in Wuhan, and have not examined whether the incubation period distribution varies across population segments with different travel histories. We aimed to examine whether patients infected by community transmission had extended incubation periods than the early generation patients who had direct exposures to Wuhan. METHODOLOGY Based on 4741 patient case reports from municipal centers of disease control by February 21, 2020, we calculated the incubation periods of 2555 patients with clear epidemiological survey information and illness development timeline. All patients were categorized into five groups by their travel histories. Incubation period distributions were modeled for each group by the method of the posterior Weibull distribution estimation. RESULTS Adults aged 30 to 59 years had the most substantial proportion of confirmed cases in China. The incubation period distribution varied slightly across patient groups with different travel histories. Patients who regularly lived in Wuhan and left to other locations before January 23, 2020 had the shortest posterior median value of 7.57 days for the incubation period, while the incubation periods for persons affected by local community transmission had the largest posterior median of incubation periods, 9.31 days. CONCLUSIONS The median incubation period for all patients infected outside Wuhan was 9 days, a bit of more extended than the early estimated 5-day incubation period that was based on patients in Wuhan. Our findings may imply the decreases of virulence of the COVID-19 virus along with intergenerational transmission.","Xiao, Zuopeng; Xie, Xi; Guo, Wenbo; Luo, Zhiqiang; Liao, Jianxiang; Wen, Feiqiu; Zhou, Qingfeng; Han, Laiwei; Zheng, Te",Journal of infection in developing countries,https://doi.org/10.3855/jidc.12718; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32379707/,360

161254,Infectious diseases and social distancing in nature.,2021-03-05,"BACKGROUND Small airway dysfunction is a common but neglected respiratory abnormality. Little is known about its prevalence, risk factors, and prognostic factors in China or anywhere else in the world. We aimed to estimate the prevalence of small airway dysfunction using spirometry before and after bronchodilation, both overall and in specific population subgroups; assess its association with a range of lifestyle and environmental factors (particularly smoking); and estimate the burden of small airway dysfunction in China. METHODS From June, 2012, to May, 2015, the nationally representative China Pulmonary Health study invited 57 779 adults to participate using a multistage stratified sampling method from ten provinces (or equivalent), and 50 479 patients with valid lung function testing results were included in the analysis. We diagnosed small airway dysfunction on the basis of at least two of the following three indicators of lung function being less than 65% of predicted: maximal mid-expiratory flow, forced expiratory flow (FEF) 50%, and FEF 75%. Small airway dysfunction was further categorised into pre-small airway dysfunction (defined as having normal FEV1 and FEV1/forced vital capacity [FVC] ratio before bronchodilator inhalation), and post-small airway dysfunction (defined as having normal FEV1 and FEV1/FVC ratio both before and after bronchodilator inhalation). Logistic regression yielded adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for small airway dysfunction associated with smoking and other lifestyle and environmental factors. We further estimated the total number of cases of small airway dysfunction in China by applying present study findings to national census data. FINDINGS Overall the prevalence of small airway dysfunction was 43·5% (95% CI 40·7-46·3), pre-small airway dysfunction was 25·5% (23·6-27·5), and post-small airway dysfunction was 11·3% (10·3-12·5). After multifactor regression analysis, the risk of small airway dysfunction was significantly associated with age, gender, urbanisation, education level, cigarette smoking, passive smoking, biomass use, exposure to high particulate matter with a diameter less than 2·5 μm (PM2·5) concentrations, history of chronic cough during childhood, history of childhood pneumonia or bronchitis, parental history of respiratory diseases, and increase of body-mass index (BMI) by 5 kg/m2. The ORs for small airway dysfunction and pre-small airway dysfunction were similar, whereas larger effect sizes were generally seen for post-small airway dysfunction than for either small airway dysfunction or pre-small airway dysfunction. For post-small airway dysfunction, cigarette smoking, exposure to PM2·5, and increase of BMI by 5 kg/m2 were significantly associated with increased risk, among preventable risk factors. There was also a dose-response association between cigarette smoking and post-small airway dysfunction among men, but not among women. We estimate that, in 2015, 426 (95% CI 411-468) million adults had small airway dysfunction, 253 (238-278) million had pre-small airway dysfunction, and 111 (104-126) million had post-small airway dysfunction in China. INTERPRETATION In China, spirometry-defined small airway dysfunction is highly prevalent, with cigarette smoking being a major modifiable risk factor, along with PM2·5 exposure and increase of BMI by 5 kg/m2. Our findings emphasise the urgent need to develop and implement effective primary and secondary prevention strategies to reduce the burden of this condition in the general population.

METHODS Consecutive PWE who were treated at the epilepsy center of Hiroshima University Hospital, which was located in the COVID-19 non-pandemic area, between March 2019 and August 2020 were enrolled. We evaluated clinical and socioeconomic factors that were associated with seizure exacerbation (an increase in seizure frequency) during the first 6 months after the COVID-19 pandemic started compared with the previous 6 months. RESULTS Among the 196 PWE who were evaluated (mean age was 37.8 ± 16.2 years), there were 33 PWE (16.8%) whose seizure frequency had increased after the pandemic began. People with epilepsy with a seizure increase showed a significant association with living alone (p < 0.001), a higher seizure frequency (p < 0.001), negative findings on MRI (p = 0.020), history of dissociative seizure (p < 0.001), mood disorders (p < 0.001), insomnia (p < 0.001), and high psychological stress levels (p = 0.024) at baseline compared with PWE without seizure exacerbation. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that ""living alone"" (odds ratio (OR) 3.69; 95%CI 1.29-10.52), ""high seizure frequency at baseline"" (OR 4.53; 95%CI 1.63-12.57), and ""comorbidity of insomnia"" (OR 9.55; 95%CI 3.71-24.55) were independently associated with seizure exacerbation. CONCLUSIONS Even in the non-pandemic area, PWE had seizure exacerbation, suggesting that clinicians should screen patients' mental health before the outbreak to provide care, reduce the burden, and prevent social isolation in PWE. This should be addressed particularly in patients with medically refractory seizures with insomnia who live alone.","Neshige, Shuichiro; Aoki, Shiro; Shishido, Takeo; Morino, Hiroyuki; Iida, Koji; Maruyama, Hirofumi",Epilepsy & behavior : E&B,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yebeh.2021.107886; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33714184/,360

Our method of performing mesh repair under the anterior lamina of the rectus sheath (MUAR) involves placing mesh between the dorsal surface of the anterior rectus sheath and the rectus abdominis muscle. We evaluated the short-term and long-term outcomes of our MUAR method. METHODS The subjects of this retrospective study were 80 patients with abdominal incisional hernia, who underwent MUAR at our hospital between August, 2009 and September, 2018. We investigated the rate of recurrence and postoperative complications in these patients, who were followed-up postoperatively for at least 18 months. Patients who completed all visits were then followed-up further with questionnaires. RESULTS The recurrence rate after MUAR was 0%. Postoperative complications consisted of subcutaneous wound infections in two patients (2.5%), successfully treated with wound cleansing and antibiotics; and subcutaneous hematoma in three patients (3.8%), which was spontaneously absorbed in two patients, and removed in one. There were no other complications, such as seroma, intestinal obstruction, mesh infection and bulging, or prolonged postoperative pain. CONCLUSION Mesh repair under the anterior lamina of the rectus sheath is simple and safe with positive short-term and long-term outcomes, suggesting that it is a good option for incisional hernia repair.","Miyake, Yuichiro; Watanabe, Souta; Mizojiri, Gaku; Maruyama, Kentaro; Lee, Kyowon; Oka, Hiroshi",Surgery today,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00595-021-02282-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33866433/,360

We determined if intratumoral lipopolysaccharide (LPS) detection by immunohistochemistry is associated with outcome in advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) treated with gemcitabine and non-gemcitabine containing 1st-line chemotherapy. Methods: We examined LPS on tumor tissue from 130 patients treated within the randomized phase 3 trial AIO-PK0104 and a validation cohort (n=113) from a prospective biomarker study and analyzed the association of LPS detection to patient outcome according to treatment subgroups. Results: In 24% of samples from the AIO-PK0104 study LPS was detected; in LPS-positive patients median OS was 4.4 months, compared to 7.3 months with LPS negative tumors (HR 1.732, p=0.010). A difference in OS was detected in the subgroup of patients treated with 1st-line gemcitabine-based treatment (n=71; HR 2.377, p=0.002), whereas no difference in OS was observed in the non-gemcitabine subgroup (n=59; HR 1.275, p=0.478). Within the validation cohort, the LPS positivity rate was 23%, and LPS detection was correlated with impaired OS in the gemcitabine subgroup (n=94; HR 1.993, p=0.008) whereas no difference in OS was observed in the non-gemcitabine subgroup (n=19; HR 2.596, p=0.219). Conclusions: The detection of intratumoral LPS as a surrogate marker for gram-negative bacterial colonization may serve as a negative predictor for gemcitabine efficacy in advanced PDAC.

The Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) has attracted interest for its simplicity and consideration of multiple relevant geriatric dimensions. However, a criticism of the CFS has been the possible subjectivity in the scoring, bringing the possible danger of lack of scoring consistency across agencies. For that reason, the authors of the CFS published a classification tree method to assist with routine scoring of the CFS. The aim of the present study was to apply the CFS classification tree to data from adults aged 65 and over from The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA) and correlate derived CFS categories with patterns of health and social care utilisation in Irish older people assessed in Wave 5 of the study (year 2018). In addition, we explored how CFS categories and states changed over 8 years in TILDA between Wave 1 (2010) and Wave 5. Results showed the following prevalence of CFS categories in Wave 5: 6% very fit (CFS1), 36% fit (CFS2), 31% managing well (CFS3), 16% vulnerable (CFS4), 6% mildly frail (CFS5), 4% moderately frail (CFS6) and 1% severely frail (CFS7). No participants were very severely frail or terminally ill. In wave 5, increasing CFS categories had an association with increasing utilisation of hospital and community health services, and increasing hours of formal and informal social care provision. The transitions analyses from Wave 1 to 5 suggested a dynamic picture of CFS transitions, with 2-year probability of transitioning from fit (CFS1-3) to vulnerable (CFS4), and fit to frail (CFS5+) at 34% and 6%, respectively. Vulnerable and frail had a 22% and 17% probability of reversal to fit and vulnerable, respectively. Our results suggest that the CFS classification tree was able to stratify the TILDA population aged 65 and over into subgroups with increasing health and social care needs. The CFS classification tree could be used to aid the allocation of health and social care resources in older people in Ireland, but given the frequency of CFS transitions in the population, it is recommended that CFS status in individuals is reviewed at least every 2 years.","O Halloran, A.

Emergency situations, such as the recent COVID-19 pandemic, have led many companies to declare bankruptcy. In this context, the present study aims to analyze strategic opinions of company executives in a declaration of bankruptcy.Design/methodology/approachTo this end, an innovative approach is applied to strategic management and business. First, the authors conducted 14 interviews with executives, and the interview data were transcribed. Second, using textual analysis and data mining techniques, the transcripts were analyzed to understand the importance of indicators identified as relevant in companies in a declaration of bankruptcy.FindingsThis resulted in identification of 10 relevant indicators perceived by executives to avoid or anticipate a state of bankruptcy, including innovation, business adaptability, room for improvement in production processes, time to react to situations of alarm, layoffs, support from public institutions, suppliers, international and national regulations, impact on the industry, credits and debts.Originality/valueThe paper concludes with a discussion of important theoretical and practical implications of these findings for the industry. Also, strategic management decision-making strategies are presented as a result of the innovative textual analysis approach used.","Nagel, Raphael Aviles Carmen",Journal of Indian Business Research,https://doi.org/10.1108/jibr-07-2020-0245,360

163999,Global trends in the social economy development,2021,"Increased red cell distribution width (RDW), which measures erythrocyte size variability (anisocytosis), has been linked to early mortality in many diseases and normal aged population through unknown mechanisms. Hypoxia has been proposed to increase both RDW and mortality. However, experimental evidence, especially in animal models, is lacking. Here, we show that chronic hypobaric hypoxia (~10% O2) increases erythrocyte numbers, hemoglobin and RDW, while reducing longevity in male mice. Compound heterozygous knockout (chKO) mutations in succinate dehydrogenase (Sdh; mitochondrial complex II) genes Sdhb, Sdhc and Sdhd reduce high RDW and immature reticulocyte fraction, and increase healthy lifespan in chronic hypoxia. Hemoglobin and erythrocyte numbers in hypoxia do not show statistically significant differences between Sdh chKO and WT mice. These results identify a mitochondrial mechanism regulating both RDW and organismal adaptation to chronic hypoxia, and suggest SDH as a potential therapeutic target to reduce high RDW-associated clinical mortality.","Baysal, Bora E.; Tabaczynski, Debra; Curtin, Leslie; Seshadri, Mukund; Sexton, Sandra",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.18.444547,360

Several studies have shown the risk of developing depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder in medical and paramedical staff. Causes included the high contagiousness of the virus, the fear of contracting it, the lack of adequate personal protective equipment, and physical and psychological fatigue. In this context, resilience represents a protective factor against adversity and stress burden. The aim of this research was to investigate if and how the resilience and personality profile is able to influence the response to stress and anxiety on a sample of Italian healthcare workers, during the COVID-19 outbreak. The sample consisted of 152 frontline healthcare workers, physicians, and paramedical professionals. Participants completed the online questionnaire measuring the Resilience Scale for Adults, the Big Five Inventory-10 Item, the State Anxiety Inventory, and the Perceived Stress Scale. Analyses of data aimed to show differences in the stress of healthcare workers due to gender and professional role, and at finding, by means of multidimensional scaling, the relations among anxiety, stress, resilience, and traits of personality. The findings gave some suggestions for implementing strategies useful to increase the resilience in healthcare workers and support them to cope with stressful events, typical of the pandemic emergency.","Coco, Marinella Guerrera Claudia Savia Santisi Giuseppe Riggio Febronia Grasso Roberta Di Corrado Donatella Di Nuovo Santo Ramaci Tiziana",Sustainability,https://doi.org/10.3390/su13137096,360

In addition, the effects of the pandemic on business were examined. Therefore, a qualitative, cross-sectional, descriptive, and ex-ploratory research project was developed with micro and small business in the following sec-tors: lodging, transportation, agency, F&B, consultancy, ceremonies, and events. Data were collected through a semi-structured script containing the categories crisis impacts, crisis planning, implementation of crisis management and post-crisis management. A content analysis technique was used. The results show negative impacts, such as 'financial difficul-ties', and positive impacts, such as 'professional qualification opportunities'. F&B compa-nies achieved 'improvements in revenue' due to delivery. The strategies used to face the pandemic deal with marketing, finances, operational and HR management, and they vary according to the type of segments and stakeholders involved. In general, companies do not make contingency plans and act responsively to crises. Findings also point out the perfor-mance of public and private institutions in 'technical and financial support' to businesses, although 'slow access to financial subsidies' has been jeopardizing the future of businesses.

However, the extent of sexual victimisation in old age psychiatry patients is unknown. Due to insufficient communication skills in both patients and healthcare workers, assessing SV in old age psychiatry patients is challenging. Methods Between July 2019 and March 2020, 100 patients at three old age psychiatry wards across Flanders participated in a face-to-face structured interview receiving inpatient treatment. The participation rate was 58%. We applied the WHO definition of SV, encompassing sexual harassment, sexual abuse with physical contact without penetration, and (attempted) rape. Outcomes In 57% of patients (65% F, 42% M) SV occurred during their lifetime and 7% (6% F, 9% M) experienced SV in the past 12-months. Half of the victims disclosed their SV experience for the first time during the interview. Only two victims had disclosed SV to a mental health care professional before. Interpretation Sexual victimisation appears to be common in old age psychiatry patients, yet it remains largely undetected. Although victims did reveal SV during a face-to-face interview to a trained interviewer, they do not seem to spontaneously disclose their experiences to mental health care professionals. In order to provide tailored care for older SV victims, professionals urgently need capacity building through training, screening tools and care procedures.","Nobels, A.; Keygnaert, I.; Robert, E.; Vandeviver, C.; Haekens, A.; Lemey, L.; Strobbe, M.; Van Den Noortgate, N.; Lemmens, G.

BINGO (Baryon Acoustic Oscillations [BAO] from Integrated Neutral Gas Observations) is a new unique radio telescope designed to be one of the first to probe BAO at radio frequencies. BINGO has two science goals: cosmology and astrophysics. Cosmology is the main science goal and the driver for BINGO's design and strategy. The key of BINGO is to detect the low redshift BAO to put strong constraints in the dark sector models. Given the versatility of the BINGO telescope, a secondary goal is astrophysics, where BINGO can help discover and study Fast Radio Bursts (FRB) and other transients, Galactic and extragalactic science. In this paper, we introduce the latest progress of the BINGO project, its science goals, describing the scientific potential of the project in each science and the new developments obtained by the collaboration. We introduce the BINGO project and its science goals and give a general summary of recent developments in construction, science potential and pipeline development obtained by the BINGO collaboration in the past few years. We show that BINGO will be able to obtain competitive constraints for the dark sector, and also that will allow for the discovery of several FRBs in the southern hemisphere. The capacity of BINGO in obtaining information from 21-cm is also tested in the pipeline introduced here. There is still no measurement of the BAO in radio, and studying cosmology in this new window of observations is one of the most promising advances in the field. The BINGO project is a radio telescope that has the goal to be one of the first to perform this measurement and it is currently being built in the northeast of Brazil.

So, this is a power-efficient, simple low footprint device. Importantly, the personal identity of the people in the crowd can not be obtained using this method. First, the system uses practical data to determine whether the outdoor environment is empty or not. If not, it tries to estimate the number of people occupying the near range locality.

A designated Fever Area (FA) with a resuscitation room was rapidly set up to manage patients at risk of COVID-19. Our paper describes measures put into this new area to optimise safety outcomes of these patients. Methods: Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles incorporating in-situ simulation in the FA resuscitation room were conducted. Using varied resuscitation scenarios and facilitated debriefing, we identified safety gaps and took immediate steps to rectify them in a collaborative manner involving various respective stakeholders. Results: Following reflective debriefing and studying of work processes, latent safety threats were identified resulting in successful improvements and modifications to protocols, equipment, staffing and processes in the FA resuscitation area. Conclusion: PDSA cycles involving in-situ simulation helped to identify safety threats and refine work processes in a newly set up FA facility. As a result, our healthcare team was more prepared to manage the complexities of COVID-19 patients in a highrisk environment.

165304,"Modeling, estimation, and analysis of COVID-19 secondary waves: The Case of the Italian Country",2021,"Background The WHO has stated that all health systems haemorrhage money, citing one of the causes of financial leakage as non-compliant billing and fraud. In Australia, it has been estimated that leakage from Medicare caused by non-compliant medical billing may be 10-15% of the schemes total cost. Despite a growing body of international research suggesting that rather than deliberately abusing the health financing systems they operate within, medical practitioners may be struggling to understand complex and highly interpretive medical billing rules, there is a lack of research in this area in Australia. The aim of this study was to address this research gap by examining the experiences of Australian medical practitioners as they interact with Australias Medicare by engaging in conversations with them about their lived experiences conducting medical billing in grass roots practice. Method This study interviewed 27 specialist and general medical practitioners who claim Medicare reimbursements in their daily practice. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analysed using thematic analysis. Results The qualitative data revealed five themes including inadequate induction, poor legal literacy, absence of reliable advice and support, fear and deference, and unmet opportunities for improvement. Conclusion The qualitative data presented in this study suggest Australian medical practitioners are ill-equipped to manage their Medicare compliance obligations, have low levels of legal literacy and desire education, clarity and certainty around complex billing standards and rules. Non-compliant medical billing under Australias Medicare scheme is a nuanced phenomenon that may be far more complex than previously thought. Strategies to address the barriers and deficiencies identified by participants in this study will require a multi-pronged approach. The data suggest that the current system of ensuring compliance by Australian medical practitioners is not fit for purpose.","Faux, M.; Adams, J.; Dahiya, S.; Wardle, J.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.26.20113324v1?rss=1,360

Previous studies have showed that it is a potential drug target for cancer, neurodegenerative disease, and viral infections. Here, we report a series of cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of substrate-engaged human p97 complex that captured “power stroke”-like motions of both the D1 and D2 ATPase rings of p97. A key feature of these structures is the critical conformational changes of the inter-subunit signaling (ISS) motifs, which tightens the binding of nucleotides and neighboring subunits, and contributes to the spiral staircase conformation of the D1 and D2 rings. We further determined the cryo-EM structure of human p97 in complex with NMS-873, the most potent p97 inhibitor. The structures showed that NMS-873 binds at a cryptic groove in the D2 domain and interacts with the ISS motif, preventing its conformational change, thus blocking substrate translocation allosterically.","Pan, Man; Yu, Yuanyuan; Ai, Huasong; Zheng, Qingyun; Xie, Yuan; Liu, Lei; Zhao, Minglei",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.08.430295,360

Its incidence is increasing due to aging populations, longer disease duration and potentially as a COVID-19 sequela. Photobiomodulation (PBM) has been successfully used in animal models to reduce the signs of PD and to protect dopaminergic neurons. OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness of PBM to mitigate clinical signs of PD in a prospective proof-of-concept study, using a combination of transcranial and remote treatment, in order to inform on best practice for a larger randomized placebo-controlled trial (RCT). METHODS: Twelve participants with idiopathic PD were recruited. Six were randomly chosen to begin 12 weeks of transcranial, intranasal, neck and abdominal PBM. The remaining 6 were waitlisted for 14 weeks before commencing treatment. After the 12-week treatment period, all participants were supplied with PBM devices to continue home treatment. Participants were assessed for mobility, fine motor skills, balance and cognition before treatment began, after 4 weeks of treatment, after 12 weeks of treatment and the end of the home treatment period. A Wilcoxon Signed Ranks test was used to assess treatment effectiveness at a significance level of 5%. RESULTS: Measures of mobility, cognition, dynamic balance and fine motor skill were significantly improved (p<0.05) with PBM treatment for 12 weeks and up to one year. Many individual improvements were above the minimal clinically important difference, the threshold judged to be meaningful for participants. Individual improvements varied but many continued for up to one year with sustained home treatment. There was a demonstrable Hawthorne Effect that was below the treatment effect. No side effects of the treatment were observed. CONCLUSIONS: PBM was shown to be a safe and potentially effective treatment for a range of clinical signs and symptoms of PD. Improvements were maintained for as long as treatment continued, for up to one year in a neurodegenerative disease where decline is typically expected. Home treatment of PD by the person themselves or with the help of a carer might be an effective therapy option. The results of this study indicate that a large RCT is warranted.","Liebert, A.; Bicknell, B.; Laakso, E.-L.; Heller, G.; Jalilitabaei, P.; Tilley, S.; Mitrofanis, J.; Kiat, H.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.05.26.21257833v1?rss=1,360
166362,Chaos at the Gates: The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and energy price shocks on South Korea's gas industry amid energy transition,2021,"COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy has become a major issue in the U.S. as vaccine supply has outstripped demand and vaccination rates slow down. At least one recent global survey has sought to study the covariates of vaccine acceptance, but an inferential model that makes simultaneous use of several socio-demographic variables has been lacking. In this article, we present such a model using US-based survey data collected by Gallup. Our study agrees with the global survey results in some respects, but is also found to exhibit significant differences. For example, women and people aged between 25-54 were found to be more vaccine hesitant. Our conditional inference tree model suggests that trust in government, age and ethnicity are the most important covariates for predicting vaccine hesitancy, and can interact in ways that make them useful for communication-based outreach, especially if conjoined with census data. In particular, we found that the most vaccine hesitant individuals were those who identified as Black Republicans with a high school (or lower) education and lower income levels, who were involuntarily unemployed and trusted in the Trump administration.","Shen, K.; Kejriwal, M.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.10.02.21264456v1?rss=1,360

With COVID-19 pandemic, its implementation has been accelerated globally at an unprecedented speed and haste. Thus, the aim of this paper is to investigate the university students’ perspectives on ODL amidst COVID-19. By using the convenient sampling method, a total of 608 diploma and degree students throughout Malaysia have participated and shared their feedback on ODL implementation. The collected data covered their general feedback and what they enjoyed the most about ODL. Moreover, their recommendations on ODL implementation were analyzed by categorising the responses into different themes. The demographic data was summarized using descriptive analysis. A comparison between the diploma and the degree students’ perspectives is also discussed in the paper. The findings show that most students have positive perceptions on ODL implementation, where positive feedback and fun factors are highlighted by the respondents. Some students indicated that ODL should not be continued in the future semester, due to problems such as poor internet connection, budget constraints and time management issues. Recommendations on improvements for better ODL implementations in the near future are also provided.

Over the last year, many higher education institutions have rapidly switched their usual classroom-based learning to online learning in order to accommodate the social distancing requirements arising from the outbreak of COVID-19. This paper investigates the implication on the students’ perceived usefulness of OER after the switch to online learning. Based on two identical surveys conducted in a university in Hong Kong before and after the change, it is revealed that the students’ perceived usefulness was generally increased, where the increase in perceived usefulness was more significant on open online complete courses, online tutorials, and open access e-books than other types of OER. It is also revealed that the students have become more aware of the shortcomings of OER, especially on accuracy and comprehensiveness. OER, especially open online courses, tutorials, and open access textbooks, are perceived to be useful for students to accommodate a rapid shift to online learning mode. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Cheung, S.

166810,The effects of resilience and familiarity on the relationship between CSR and consumer attitudes,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic has shown that some companies have been prepared for the pandemic in terms of crisis management, but other companies have not been prepared at all. The dependency of a company on third-party provider is even bigger in a pandemic situation. Operational resilience must be assured for third-party providers, who are supporting the company in delivering critical business processes. In a pandemic, the risk is much bigger that a third-party provider is having economical or employee-related issues, for example financial problems or loss of staff so that the provider will not be able to support the company on the same level as before the pandemic or cannot support the company at all. To assure operational resilience within a company, it is needed to first identify the critical IT assets and critical processes within the company. Only then it is possible to protect these IT assets and assure the business continuity of the critical business processes.

166845,Small business survival capabilities and fiscal programs: Evidence from oakland,2021,"Introduction Microcatheter exchange increases the risks of intracranial angioplasty and stenting using the Wingspan/Gateway system and may have contributed to the high procedural risks in the SAMMPRIS trial. We present a case series of direct stent deployment through the balloon catheter, simplifying the technique of intracranial angioplasty and stenting using self-expanding stents. Materials and Methods We retrospectively reviewed all patients who underwent stenting for intracranial stenosis with deployment of the Neuroform Atlas stent through the Gateway balloon in our hospital system since this technique was first utilized in October 2020. Procedural success, complication rate, short term clinical and imaging follow-up were assessed. Results Ten Neuroform Atlas stents were deployed through either the Gateway or Emerge balloon catheter in eight patients. The median age was 59 (range 30-75) and 50% were female. All patients had symptomatic severe intracranial stenosis with mean stenosis of 83% (range 70% to 90%). Six patients had recurrent strokes and had failed medical therapy, while two patients presented with acute stroke symptoms and were treated emergently. Mean post-stenting stenosis was 32% (range 0% to 50%). Two procedures were performed under conscious sedation and the rest under general anesthesia. Four stents were placed in the supraclinoid internal carotid artery (ICA), one in the middle cerebral artery M1, two in M2, two in the basilar artery and one in the intracranial vertebral artery. All five patients who underwent short-term follow-up angiograms (mean interval 1.2 months) had further improvement of residual stenosis. There were no ischemic or hemorrhagic periprocedural complications. None of the patients had recurrent TIAs or strokes. One patient died of a COVID-19 infection. One patient had transient neurological deterioration at four months due to profound hypoglycemia. Conclusion Deploying self-expanding stents through an angioplasty balloon catheter is feasible, safe, and can greatly simplify the procedure. The Neuroform Atlas stent is strong enough to prevent immediate recoil of intracranial stenosis after angioplasty.","Takayanagi, A.; Fields, J.; Chao, K.; Rex, D.; Cheng, P.; Feng, L.",Journal of NeuroInterventional Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2021-snis.140,360

167156,The influence of technology on academic distraction: A review,2021,"The exceptional circumstance caused by the COVID-19 pandemic demands substantial modifications in the teaching-learning processes across the globe. Teachers and students are making use of online learning in virtual classrooms as an alternative for face-to-face learning in physical classrooms. However, students' attendance management during virtual learning is a challenging problem. It is quite difficult to identify students' disengagement and even to know whether they are in front of their smart devices or not. In this paper, we introduce the 'Random Interval Attendance Management System' (RIAMS), which is an innovative solution for attendance monitoring issues, students' disengagement, and attendance faking during virtual learning. In RIAMS, we employed a face recognition module built using the Dlib open-source software library. In order to improve the efficiency of the system, we introduced two ancillary modalities - verifying students' responses to CAPTCHAs and UIN (Unique Identification Number) queries. Both the face recognition and ancillary modalities operate at random intervals of time. This distinctive feature of randomness in our design ensures that students' attention and engagement in virtual learning are enhanced. Furthermore, the RIAMS' multimodal architecture and its sub-modalities' adaptive weight system enable teachers to customize their attendance strategy for every course. The output analysis of each of the RIAMS modalities and the combined results emphasize the effectiveness and reliability of our system in the attendance management for virtual learning. The novel RIAMS model has the potential to be extensively deployed for virtual learning in post-COVID settings.","Anzar, S. M.; Subheesh, N.

Background The MODS caused by an excessive systemic inflammatory response following trauma is associated with a high morbidity and mortality. The protein BTK is known to play a role in the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, which is a key component of the innate inflammatory response. However, its role in trauma-hemorrhage is unknown. Methods Acute and chronic HS rat models were performed to determine the influence of acalabrutinib or fenebrutinib on MODS. The activation of BTK, NF-κB and NLRP3 pathways were analyzed by western blot in the kidney. Results We demonstrated that (a) HS caused organ injury and/or dysfunction and hypotension (post resuscitation) in rats, while (b) treatment of HS-rats with either acalabrutinib or fenebrutinib attenuated the organ injury and dysfunction in acute and chronic HS models and (c) reduced the activation of BTK, NF-κB and NLRP3 pathways in the kidney. Conclusion Our results point to a role of BTK in the pathophysiology of organ injury and dysfunction caused by trauma/hemorrhage and indicate that BTK inhibitors may be repurposed as a potential therapeutic approach for MODS after trauma and/or hemorrhage. MINI-ABSTRACT This study evaluated the role of Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) in trauma/hemorrhage. Patients with trauma had elevated gene expression of BTK. The BTK inhibitors acalabrutinib (irreversible) and fenebrutinib (reversible) attenuated the trauma-induced multiple organ dysfunction in rats with hemorrhagic shock, indicating that BTK could be a potential therapeutic target.","Patel, Nikita M; Oliveira, Filipe RMB; Ramos, Hanna Pillmann; Aimaretti, Eleonora; Alves, Gustavo Ferreira; Coldewey, Sina M; Collino, Massimo; Sordi, Regina; Thiemermann, Christoph",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.23.460775,360

We are helping to meet this demand by proposing a new candidate extending the standard Ailamujia distribution, called the power Ailamujia distribution. The idea is to extend the adaptability of the Ailamujia distribution through the use of the power transform, introducing a new shape parameter in its definition. In particular, the new parameter is able to produce original non-monotonic shapes for the main functions that are desirable for data fitting purposes. Its interest is also shown through results about stochastic orders, quantile function, moments (raw, incomplete and probability weighted), stress-strength parameter and Tsallis entropy. New classes of distributions based on the power Ailamujia distribution are also presented. Then, we investigate the corresponding statistical model to analyze two kinds of data: complete data and data in presence of censorship.

Here’ we develop a new method to estimate human population size in light of recent developments in species-abundance distributions of microbial ecosystems.

We present a new non-parametric model, MicrobiomeCensus, for estimating human population size from sewage samples. MicrobiomeCensus harnesses the inter-individual variability in human gut microbiomes and performs maximum likelihood estimation based on simultaneous deviation of multiple taxa’s relative abundances from their population means. MicrobiomeCensus outperformed generic algorithms in data-driven simulation benchmarks and detected population size differences in field data.

168484,"Online grocery shopping for the elderly in Quebec, Canada: The role of mobility impediments and past online shopping experience",2021,"Abstract Importance: Effective therapeutics for Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment are needed. Objective: To determine whether a precision medicine approach to Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment, in which potential contributors to cognitive decline are identified and targeted therapeutically, is effective enough in a proof-of-concept trial to warrant a larger, randomized, controlled clinical trial. Rationale: Previous clinical trials for Alzheimer's disease have pre-determined a single treatment modality, such as a drug candidate or therapeutic procedure, that may be unrelated to the primary drivers of the neurodegenerative process. Therefore, increasing data set size to include the potential contributors to cognitive decline for each patient, and addressing the identified potential contributors, may represent a more effective therapeutic strategy. Hypothesis: Alzheimer's disease is a multi-factorial network dysfunction that results from a chronic or repeated insufficiency of support for a neuroplasticity network; thus factors that increase demand -- such as infections or toxin exposure -- or reduce support -- such as reduced energetics or trophic support -- may contribute to the neurodegenerative process. Rectifying this hypothesized network dysfunction represents a rational approach to the treatment of the cognitive decline associated with Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment. Design: Twenty-five patients with Alzheimer's disease or mild cognitive impairment, with Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores of 19 or higher, were evaluated for markers of inflammation, chronic infection, dysbiosis, insulin resistance, protein glycation, vascular disease, nocturnal hypoxemia, hormone insufficiency or dysregulation, nutrient deficiency, toxin or toxicant exposure (metals, organic toxicants, and biotoxins), genetic predisposition to cognitive decline, and other biochemical parameters associated with cognitive decline. Brain magnetic resonance imaging with volumetrics was performed at baseline and study conclusion. Patients were treated for nine months with a personalized, precision medicine protocol that addressed each patient's identified potentially contributory factors, and cognition was assessed at t = 0, 3, 6, and 9 months. Trial registration and IRB approval: The clinical trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03883633), 1 and approved by the Advarra IRB. Support for the trial: The trial was supported by a grant from the Four Winds Foundation via Evanthea, LLC, and we are grateful to Diana Merriam and Gayle Brown for their interest, discussions, and support. Main Outcome Measures: Trained external raters evaluated the study subjects with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), CNS Vital Signs (a computerized cognitive assessment battery), AQ-21 (a subjective scale completed by the significant other or study partner), and AQ-C change scale (a subjective scale of cognitive improvement or decline, completed by the significant other or study partner). Follow-up brain MRI with volumetrics was carried out at the completion of the trial. Results: All outcome measures revealed improvement: statistically highly significant improvement in MoCA scores, CNS Vital Signs Neurocognitive Index, and AQ-C were documented. No serious adverse events were recorded. Conclusions and Relevance: Based on the cognitive improvements observed in this study of patients with Alzheimer's disease or mild cognitive impairment, a larger, randomized, controlled trial of the precision medicine therapeutic approach described herein is warranted.","Toups, K.; Hathaway, A.; Gordon, D.; Chung, H.; Raji, C.; Boyd, A.; Hill, B.

Twenty-two components have been identified and represented 97.41 % of the total oil composition. The major constituents of the essential oil were m-cymene (30.58 %), n-hexadecanoic acid (14.88 %) and docosane-11-decyl (10.43 %). Four methods were used to determine the antioxidant activity: DPPH, ABTS, CUPRAC and reducing power assay. The results indicate that the essential oil extract has moderate to low activity compared to the reference antioxidant compounds. In vitro anticholinesterase activity of the essential oil has also been studied. It exhibited higher inhibitory activity against butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) than against acetylcholinesterase (AChE). Docking studies conducted for Alzheimer's disease-related enzymes have displayed that compounds docosane-11-decyl and octaethyleneglycol monododecyl ether have strong potency, and compounds 15,15’Bi1,4,7,10,13-pentaoxacyclohexadecane and n-Hexadecanoic acid have moderate inhibitory potential. In addition, these three compounds (Docosane-11-decyl, octaethyleneglycol monododecyl ether and 15,15’Bi1,4,7,10,13-pentaoxacyclohexadecane) of the essential oil displayed strong interaction against SARS-CoV-2 main protease and Nsp15 endoribonuclease.

Methods PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science and CINAHL databases were searched for quantitative literature (between the years 2000 and 2020) containing indicators or variables representing MI in MH, which was defined as the involvement, participation, engagement or support of men in all activities related to maternal health. Results After full text review, 282 studies were included in the review. Most studies were conducted in Africa (43%), followed by North America (23%), Asia (15%) and Europe (12%). Descriptive analysis and text mining analysis showed MI in MH has been conceptualised by focusing on two main aspects: psychosocial support and instrumental support for maternal health care utilisation. Differences in measurement and topics were noted according to continent with Africa focusing on HIV prevention, North America and Europe on psychosocial health and stress, and Asia on nutrition. One third of studies used one single indicator for assessing MI in MH and no common pattern of indicators could be identified. Antenatal care attendance was the most used indicator (40%) followed by financial support (17%), presence during childbirth (17%) and HIV testing (14%). Majority of studies did not collect data from men directly. Discussion Researchers often focus on a single aspect of MI in MH, resulting in the usage of a narrow and simplified set of indicators. Aspects such as communication between the couple, shared decision making, participation in household tasks and the subjective feeling of being supported have received little attention. We believe a more multidimensional approach can broaden the potential of MI programs. Further research, involving experts and pilot testing, is recommended to develop consensus regarding a more robust and comprehensive set of valid and feasible indicators for assessing MI in MH.","Galle, A.; Plaieser, G.; Van Steenstraeten, T.; Griffin, S.; Osman, N.; Roelens, K.; Degomme, O.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.13.21249728v1?rss=1,360
168878,"Social distance forever? Or, what is a horizon for 'being near, together with others'?",2021,"Background The effect of the BioNTech-Pfizer BNT162b2 vaccination in the elderly (>=80 years) could not be fully assessed in the BioNTech-Pfizer trial due to low numbers in this age group. We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the BioNTech-Pfizer (BNT162b2) vaccine to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe outcomes in octo- and novo-generians in a German state setting. Methods and Findings A prospective observational study of 708,187 persons aged >=80 years living in Bavaria, Germany, was conducted between Jan 9 to Apr 11, 2021. We assessed the vaccine efficacy (VE) for two doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine with respect to SARS-CoV-2 infection and related hospitalisations and mortality. Additionally, differences in VE by age groups >=80 to <=89 years and >=90 years were studied. Analyses were adjusted by sex. By the end of follow-up, 63.8% of the Bavarian population [≥]80 years had received one dose, and 52.7% two doses, of the BNT162b2 vaccine. Two doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine lowered the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infections and related outcomes, resulting in VE estimates of 68.3% (95% confidence interval (CI) 65.5%, 70.9%) for infection, 73.2% (95% CI 65.3%, 79.3%) for hospitalisation, and 80.1% (95% CI 80.0%, 89.0%) for mortality. Sex differences in the risk of COVID-19 outcomes observed among unvaccinated persons disappeared after two BNT162b2 vaccine doses. Overall, the BNT162b2 vaccine was equally efficacious in octo- and novo-genarians. Conclusions Two doses of BioNTech-Pfizers BNT162b2 vaccine is highly effective against COVID-19 outcomes in elderly persons.","Gomes, D.; Beyerlein, A.; Katz, K.; Hoelscher, G.; Nennstiel, U.; Liebl, B.; Ueberla, K.; von Kries, R.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.08.19.21262266v1?rss=1,360

169252,Combating hate speech using an adaptive ensemble learning model with a case study on COVID-19,2021,"Background During the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic, hospitals were forced to cancel or postpone non-COVID-19 care. With new outbreaks emerging, hospitals are now figuring out how to balance preparedness for future COVID-19 waves with their elective and regular services. This report discusses how four hospital systems deal with these dual responsibilities in China, Norway and the UK. Reflections Based on the experiences and combined reflections of hospital executives, we have formulated five strategic and leadership lessons for hospitals as they manage these dual responsibilities. (1) Redesign organisation to separate COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 services both within and across hospitals. (2) Expand virtual care strategies to improve access. (3) Use data-driven models to allocate resources across COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 units. (4) Invest in programmes to promote frontline staff well-being. (5) Secure financial support to continue to deliver on the dual responsibilities. Conclusion The COVID-19 pandemic gives rise to leadership challenges that have fuelled organisational change and new approaches to healthcare delivery. Leading hospitals during the pandemic is a balancing act -providing care for both patients with COVID-19 and non-COVID-19, while at the same time preparing for the next waves of the pandemic. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

169501,Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model study using free particle dynamics,2021,"Background Over three quarters of all new HIV infections among 15-24 year old adolescents and young people globally take place in sub-Saharan Africa. As this growing cohort becomes older, understanding and meeting their sexual and reproductive health (SRH) needs is critical, particularly in light of COVID-19 healthcare and social disruptions. However, few studies have documented these outcomes among adolescents in resource-limited settings, with none reporting data from longitudinal cohorts. Summary This talk summarises what we know about the sexual and reproductive health of adolescents living with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa, particularly experiences of pregnancy, motherhood and relationships. It draws from findings of a review of SRHR experiences of adolescents and young people living with HIV, complemented by analyses of two large community- traced cohort: the Mzantsi Wakho ('Your South Africa') and HEY BABY (Helping Empower Youth Brought up in Adversity with their Babies and Young children) studies in South Africa. The Mzantsi Wakho cohort conducted three waves of data collection with over 1,600 adolescents and young people living with HIV (93%-97% retained at each wave), 1,064 of whom were living with HIV since baseline. The HEY BABY study recruited over 1,000 adolescent and young women who had their first child <20 years old, 315 of whom were living with HIV. Qualitative data from COVID-19 related research with two Teen Advisory Groups in South Africa and Kenya will also be shared to highlight sexual and reproductive health service provision and access experiences of young people and their healthcare providers.","Toska, E.; Banougnin, B.",Sexually Transmitted Infections,https://doi.org/10.1136/sextrans-2021-sti.32,360

Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) is the cause of the COVID-19 disease. Staphylococcus aureus, like SARS-CoV2, is a harmful microorganism. Once the skin is breached, S. aureus can cause infections like pneumonia and skin infections. The coinfections between these two microorganisms present high risk on human health. This study deals with investigating the effect of electromagnetic radiation on Staphylococcus aureus. It focuses on exposing the S. aureus bacteria samples to different Ultra High Frequencies (UHF). The number of bacterial colonies that grew from the exposed sample and unexposed samples were assessed. The average bacterial growth was 90.51% This means that some of the bacteria did not survive after exposure to radiation. This result showed that some of the UHF's had affected the growth of Staphylococcus aureus. The correlation between the frequency and the growth of the bacteria was also calculated by means of computing the Pearson Correlation coefficient. The result is 0.4344 which signifies a small positive linear relation between the two parameters mentioned. These results can be preliminary stage on exploring other possible application of electromagnetic radiation in prevention of diseases.","Cordero-Samortin, A.; Dela Cruz, J.

Within ECP, the Co-design Center for Particle Applications (CoPA) is addressing challenges faced by particle-based applications across four sub-motifs: short-range particle-particle interactions (e.g., those which often dominate molecular dynamics (MD) and smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) methods), long-range particle-particle interactions (e.g., electrostatic MD and gravitational N-body), particle-in-cell (PIC) methods, and linear-scaling electronic structure and quantum molecular dynamics (QMD) algorithms. Our crosscutting co-designed technologies fall into two categories: proxy applications (or apps) and libraries. Proxy apps are vehicles used to evaluate the viability of incorporating various types of algorithms, data structures, and architecture-specific optimizations and the associated trade-offs; examples include ExaMiniMD, CabanaMD, CabanaPIC, and ExaSP2. Libraries are modular instantiations that multiple applications can utilize or be built upon; CoPA has developed the Cabana particle library, PROGRESS/BML libraries for QMD, and the SWFFT and fftMPI parallel FFT libraries. Success is measured by identifiable lessons learned that are translated either directly into parent production application codes or into libraries, with demonstrated performance and/or productivity improvement.

170403,Algorithms and Decision-Making in the Public Sector,2021-06-07,"Linear infrastructure intrusions are common around the world to meet the needs of a growing and interconnected human population. The implementation of linear infrastructures involves numerous forms and mechanisms of land‐use transformation that can facilitate and serve as pathways to the spread of invasive non‐native species. However, the type and intensity of land transformations change over time and this can affect the frequency and intensity in which linear infrastructures route the spread of invasive species.Here, we present results collected over 5 years of monitoring surveys (2015–2019) to assess the relationship between the construction of one of the largest canals to date in Brazil and the spread of non‐native species. We studied the Integration Project of the São Francisco River (PISF), a canal fully inserted in the Caatinga biome, a tropical dry forest ecosystem for which information on invasion dynamics are little known.Our results confirmed PISF canals served as habitat and dispersal corridors for non‐native plant species. Monitoring surveys recorded 26 non‐native species established along the 83.2 km2 PISF deployment area. Eleven years after the canal deployment area was completely cleared of vegetation, 92.3% of its extension had non‐native plant populations. Of the 10 species assessed for their population status, 8 had invasive populations.The time immediately after construction work finished was the critical stage for the spread of non‐native woody plants, which increased their distributions with reduced levels of construction intervention, whereas most of the herbaceous species reduced their distributions. When human intervention was drastically reduced, many populations of non‐native plants rapidly formed at the deployment area.Policy implications. Man‐made linear infrastructures can remove biogeographical barriers and serve as pathways for the spread of invasive species over long distances and across ecosystems. Thus, the planning, construction and management of such infrastructures should include measures and funding for risk assessment, prevention, monitoring and control of biological invasions. Agencies responsible for environmental licensing should mandate invasive species management as part of the installation and operation licensing conditions.

A implantação de infraestrutura linear envolve inúmeras formas e mecanismos de transformação no uso do solo que podem facilitar e servir como corredores para a disseminação de espécies exóticas invasoras. No entanto, o tipo e intensidade das transformações do solo mudam ao longo do tempo e isso pode afetar a frequência e intensidade com que infraestruturas lineares direcionam a propagação de espécies invasoras.Aqui nós apresentamos resultados coletados ao longo de cinco anos de campanhas de Monitoramento (2015 a 2019) para avaliar a relação entre a construção de uma das maiores infraestruturas lineares do Brasil no momento e a dispersão de espécies exóticas. Nós estudamos o Projeto de Integração do rio São Francisco (PISF), um canal totalmente inserido no bioma Caatinga.Nossos resultados confirmam que as estruturas do PISF agem como um corredor para a dispersão de espécies de plantas exóticas. As campanhas de monitoramento registraram 26 espécies exóticas estabelecidas ao longo de 83,2 km² da área de implantação do PISF. Onze anos após a área de implantação ser completamente desmatada, 92,3% de sua extensão tinha populações de plantas exóticas. Das dez espécies avaliadas quanto ao status populacional oito tinham populações invasoras.O período logo após o término da construção foi o estágio crítico para a disseminação de arbustos, árvores e uma espécie de liana exótica, que aumentaram suas distribuições em níveis reduzidos de intervenção no ambiente, enquanto a maioria das espécies herbáceas reduziram suas distribuições. Quando o nível de intervenção humana foi drasticamente reduzido muitas espécies de plantas exóticas rapidamente formaram populações na área de implantação.Implicações para políticas.

However, other respiratory samples have not been evaluated. Methods: This prospective comparison between GENECUBE(R) HQ SARS-CoV-2 and reference real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 using anterior nasal samples and saliva samples. Additionally, we evaluated a new rapid examination protocol using GENECUBE(R) HQ SARS-CoV-2 for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 with saliva samples. For the rapid protocol, in the preparation of saliva samples, purification and extraction processes were adjusted, and the total process time was shortened to approximately 35 minutes. Results: For 359 anterior nasal samples, the total-, positive-, and negative concordance of the two assays was 99.7% (358/359), 98.1% (51/52), and 100% (307/307), respectively.

170598,"Towards a Hindu Rashtra: Hindutva, religion, and nationalism in India",2021,"Purpose: This paper aims to examine new housekeeping procedures introduced in response to COVID-19. The pandemic has required hotels to reassess their standard operating procedures, especially in housekeeping to retain the confidence of guests in the hotel/brand via high standards of sanitization, hygiene and the maintenance of social distancing. Design/methodology/approach: The article draws on publications and announcements made by major brands and associations about their updated standards of cleaning, hygiene and sanitisation, social distancing and workplace protocols arising from the pandemic. Further, a survey was used to determine the impact of new processes on housekeeping teams and their perceptions of its effect on service quality, guests and employee safety. Findings: Some key new processes are: keeping the hotel room vacant for several hours after departure, the sanitisation of every room, cleaning and sanitisation of high touch points, linen and waste management and low frequency or complete avoidance of the cleaning of occupied rooms. The survey questionnaire establishes that housekeepers value their new standard operating procedures (SOPs) and agree that “clinically clean” is the new normal and essential to avoid cross-contamination and keep guests and employees safe. Research limitations/implications: As the pandemic is a current phenomenon, the guidelines and protocols are rapidly evolving. Hotels are innovating and looking for new processes to manage infection control. This study has mainly focused on cleanliness and hygiene protocols and procedures prevalent in the industry. Currently, future work could be useful to evaluate the long-term impact of COVID-19 on the new processes and procedures that have been deployed. Practical implications: In order to recover from the pandemic, the Indian hotel industry faces a colossal task. Even when the virus peaks have passed and hotels can safely reopen, the fear of infection will continue and so guest trust and confidence is essential. Given this, the paper should be of interest to hoteliers and policymakers seeking to implement the best possible post COVID-19 housekeeping practices. Originality/value: This paper identifies and analyses best practice in hotel housekeeping in response to COVID-19.

Among various guidelines, the most promising preventing measure is to cover the face with a mask to minimize the spread of COVID-19. For the same, various models are being developed by different researchers to automate the process of mask detection that will help to ensure that maximum people adhere to the advisories issued by leading health organizations. Here, in this paper, the authors propose an automated system that detects the mask. The proposed model identifies faces through facial features through technology such as video cameras. The proposed Face Mask Recognition System employs Deep Learning, a type of Artificial Intelligence (AI), to detect the person with or without a mask. The proposed model can be connected with any surveillance system installed at your premises. Further, the authorities can identify the person who is not wearing a mask to initiate any action if required. The system also sends an alert message to the administrator if someone enters the premises without a face mask. The proposed model has been tested to establish its efficiency and effectiveness.

We made amendments based on these, and undertook a second study, this time evaluating 4 CTAs used in other countries. This has led to the completion of the Usability pillar, which can now be used to evaluate global CTAs.","Storni, C.; Tsvyatkova, D.; Richardson, I.; Buckley, J.; Abbas, M.; Beecham, S.; Chochlov, M.; Fitzgerald, B.; Glynn, L.; Johnson, K.; Laffey, J.; McNicholas, B.; Nuseibeh, B.; O039,; Connell, J.; Keeffe, D.; Keeffe, I.; Callaghan, M.; Razzaq, A.; Rekanar, K.; Simpkin, A.; Walsh, J.; Welsh, T.",Healthinf: Proceedings of the 14th International Joint Conference on Biomedical Engineering Systems and Technologies - Vol. 5: Healthinf,https://doi.org/10.5220/0010307005570565,360

Ramp-up as a phase of value creation, begins with the completion of a product’s design and ends with the reach of maximum production capacity. In today’s world, there is a significant advance in technology but simultaneously there is an increasing uncertainty as we have experienced with the Covid-19 crisis. Within this context, the importance of ramp-up management become more than ever evident. Whilst some products like face masks saw their demand increase drastically, some other companies had to shut off their production or switch to manufacture new products like hand sanitizers. Hence, it is critical today to have a successful ramp-up management in order to predict and meet clients’ demand in terms of quality and quantity. This paper aims to provide a set of guidelines for ramp-up management considering crisis context. The paper relies on an exploratory research coupling literature analysis and interviews among practitioners.

As we are facing the growing numbers of COVID-19 cases caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, an understanding of the impact of air pollutants and meteorological variables on the incidence of respiratory infections is crucial. The influenza-like illness (ILI) incidence might be used as a close proxy for the circulation of influenza viruses. Recently, SARS-CoV-2 has also been detected in patients with ILI. Using distributed lag nonlinear models, we analyzed the association between ILI, meteorological variables and particulate matter concentration in Bialystok, Poland, from 2013-2019. We found an exponential relation between cumulative PM2.5 pollution and the incidence of ILI that remained significant after adjusting for air temperatures and a long-term trend. Pollution had the greatest effect during the same week, but the risk of ILI was increased for the four following weeks. The risk of ILI was also increased by low air temperatures, low absolute humidity, and high wind speed. Altogether, our results show that all measures implemented to decrease PM2.5 concentrations would be beneficial to reduce the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory infections.","Toczylowski, K.; Wietlicka-Piszcz, M.; Grabowska, M.; Sulik, A.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.18.21250031v1?rss=1,360

Data are extracted from four sources, recorded using five clinical terminologies and stored in different schemas. The aims of our research were to: a) develop a semi-supervised approach for bootstrapping EHR phenotyping algorithms in UKB EHR, and b) to evaluate our approach by implementing and evaluating phenotypes for 31 common biomarkers. Materials and Methods We describe an algorithmic approach to phenotyping biomarkers in primary care EHR involving a) bootstrapping definitions using existing phenotypes, b) excluding generic, rare or semantically distant terms, c) forward-mapping terminology terms, d) expert review, and e) data extraction. We evaluated the phenotypes by assessing the ability to reproduce known epidemiological associations with all-cause mortality using Cox proportional hazards models. Results We created and evaluated phenotyping algorithms for 31 biomarkers many of which are directly related to COVID-19 complications e.g. diabetes, cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease. Our algorithm identified 1651 Read v2 and Clinical Terms Version 3 terms and automatically excluded 1228 terms. Clinical review excluded 103 terms and included 44 terms, resulting in 364 terms for data extraction (sensitivity 0.89, specificity 0.92). We extracted 38,190,682 events and identified 220,978 participants with at least one biomarker measured.

As such, the study was intended to find out the association between students’ inattentiveness to study and their psychological conditions during this pandemic. Primary data for this study were collected from a total of 157 samples chosen from the undergraduate students of 18 academic departments of the Noakhali Science and Technology University (NSTU), Bangladesh on the basis of snowball sampling. The study reveals that most of the respondents were much inattentive to study during the COVID-19 pandemic and they were much anxious, depressed, tensed, restless, bored and frightened, and thereby their mental health and well-being were affected. The study shows that there is a strong positive association between the students’ inattentiveness to study and their psychological conditions which involve anxiety, depression, tension, restlessness, boredom and fear/panic. The study indicates that the association between the students’ inattentiveness to study and their psychological conditions is statistically significant. Finally, the study suggests that the Government and the authority concerned should undertake proper measures to mitigate the adverse psychological conditions of the NSTU students by means of motivations and psychosocial counselling, and thereby keeping up their attentiveness to study during the pandemic or any other critical situation. As such, there is a crying need for establishing a psychosocial counselling centre or an educational counselling centre in all universities of Bangladesh including the NSTU. © 2021.

The scale was mainly used to assess the structural model. Besides, tests of difference were addressed regarding digital technology access for instructional use based on gender, teaching experience and school location.Design/methodology/approachThe authors implemented a survey design in this study. A scale based on prior studies was developed, validated and piloted. The pilot study data were computed for an exploratory factor analysis. Further, partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) and t-test procedures were used for the main data analysis (n.2677). The authors also included the importance-performance map analysis to extend of the results of the PLS-SEM.FindingsThe findings of the study successfully assessed the validity and reliability of the scale. All hypothetical relationships in the structural model were positively significant. The t-test results show that teaching experience and school location were significantly different regarding instructional use access;however, an insignificant difference emerged based on gender.Practical implicationsFailure in technology integration is possible if policies have not been carefully prepared. Therefore, users' perception is an essential factor in determining technology integration, including access to digital technology.Originality/valueThis research has the potential to enhance the understanding of access to digital technology in the context of developing countries by the elaboration of the proposed model's instrument development and validation, path analysis assessment and difference test examination with a large sample size.

But the new viral variants can reduce the efficacy of the currently available antibodies, as well as diminish the vaccine induced immunity. Here, we demonstrate how the microscopic dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing monoclonal antibodies, can be modulated by the mutations present in the spike proteins of the variants currently circulating in the world population. We show that the dynamical perturbation in the antibody structure can be diverse, depending both on the nature of the antibody and on the location of the mutation. The correlated motion between the antibody and the receptor binding domain (RBD) can also be changed, altering the binding affinity. By constructing a protein graph connectivity network, we could delineate the mutant induced modifications in the allosteric information flow pathway through the antibody, and observed the presence of both localized and long distance effects. We identified a loop consisting of residues 470-490 in the RBD which works like an anchor preventing the detachment of the antibodies, and individual mutations in that region can significantly affect the antibody binding propensity. Our study provides fundamental and atomistically detailed insight on how virus neutralization by monoclonal antibody can be impacted by the mutations in the epitope, and can potentially facilitate the rational design of monoclonal antibodies, effective against the new variants of the novel coronavirus.","Ray, Dhiman; Quijano, Riley Nicolas; Andricioaei, Ioan",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.13.456317,360

To investigate the impact of residential heating activities on atmospheric particles, the chemical composition, size distribution, and evolution process of single particles collected during the wintertime of 2019 were investigated using a single-particle aerosol mass spectrometer (SPAMS). The results showed that the concentrations of four air pollutants including PM2.5, SO2, NO2, and CO during the heating period were 1.1-1.2 times higher than those before the heating period largely due to the increase of pollutant emissions from coal combustion, while O-3 concentration during the heating period decreased by 40.2%. The mass spectra and unscaled size distributions of single particles suggested that the particles had undergone a significant aging process during the whole observation period. The acidity of single particles was calculated by the relative acidity ratio (R-ra), which increased from 36.1 +/- 13.9 before the heating period to 64.8 +/- 43.9 during the heating period, implying that the single particles were more acidic and less aged during the heating period, mainly due to the enhanced formation of sulfate and nitrate and the decreased O-3 concentration during the heating period. Moreover, R-ra decreased from clean days to polluted days before and during the heating period, suggesting that the atmospheric particles in polluted days were less acidic and more aged. The percentage of elemental carbon (EC) particles increased by 13.6% and 11.5% from clean days to polluted days before and during the heating period, respectively, suggesting the significant contribution of EC particles to the polluted days. Source identification results showed that single particles before the heating period were mostly derived from secondary inorganic source (26.5%) and vehicle exhaust (21.4%), whereas those during the heating period were largely from coal combustion (24.0%) and secondary inorganic source (21.4%).","Song, A.

Most existing reports have been limited to individual centers or voluntary reporting registries.2,3 Objectives: To compare the occurrence of hospitalizations following COVID-19 diagnosis among patients with RA treated with various classes of DMARDs. Methods: A cohort of patients with confirmed COVID-19 (ICD10 diagnosis code or positive PCR or antigen test result) were identified within a large US electronic health record (EHR) dataset (Optum, Inc.) during the time period Feb 1, 2020 through Oct 14, 2020. From these, we identified RA patients (ICD10 RA diagnosis code) with treatment (most recent of JAK inhibitor [JAKi], biologic [bDMARD] or conventional synthetic [csDMARD] only) within the 12 months prior to COVID-19 diagnosis (i.e., index). The primary outcome was any hospitalization on or within 30 days after COVID-19 diagnosis. Multivariable logistic regression models compared users of JAKi's to non-TNFi bDMARDs and csDMARDs (separately), as well as users of TNFi's to non-TNFi bDMARDS and csDMARDs (separately), and were adjusted for age, gender, index month and baseline corticosteroid use. Sensitivity analyses included restriction of prevalent treatment use to within 180 days prior to COVID-19 diagnosis and restriction of csDMARDs to a group without hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine. Results: The study included 910 RA patients on DMARD treatment who were diagnosed with COVID-19 (mean age ± SD: 61±15, 80% female, 62% white. Of those, 26% (n=240) were hospitalized on or within 30 days after COVID-19 diagnosis. The proportion of patients hospitalized was highest in non-TNFi bDMARD users (37/87;43%), followed by csDMARDs users (161/581;28%) and lowest in JAKi (13/68;19%) and TNFi users (29/174;17%). In multivariable-adjusted models, no differences in risk of hospitalization were found comparing JAKi users to csDMARD users (aOR=0.71;95% CI 0.37-1.36) or TNFi users to csDMARD users (aOR=0.67;95%CI 0.43-1.06). Compared to non-TNFi bDMARD users, JAKi use and TNFi use was associated with reduced risk of hospitalization (JAKi aOR=0.32;95%CI 0.14-0.71;TNFi aOR=0.34;95%CI 0.18-0.62). Age and corticosteroid use were positively associated with 30-day hospitalization in all models. Results of sensitivity analyses were consistent with the main findings. Conclusion: In this study, roughly a quarter of RA patients with recent DMARD treatment were hospitalized within 30 days after COVID diagnosis. Patients treated with JAKi and TNFi therapies experienced the lowest risk of hospitalization, with risk of hospitalization significantly lower than non-TNFi bDMARDs. However, recent therapy recorded in the EHR may not reflect exposure at time of COVID-19 diagnosis and small sample size per treatment may limit interpretation.","Wegrzyn, L.; Winthrop, K.; Kim, S.; Ye, Y.; Huisingh, C.; Krueger, W.; Maniccia, A.; Kilpatrick, R.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,https://doi.org/10.1136/annrheumdis-2021-eular.2206,360

Therefore, the purpose of this research is to evaluate the use of e-learning platforms among students at universities in West Sumatera, Indonesia, during the Covid-19 pandemic, particularly widely used Google Classroom. This research employs the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) by considering relevant external factors related to the pandemic situation and examining their effects on the acceptance of Google Classroom. A questionnaire was distributed from December 11th to December 31st, 2020, to collect data via an online-based survey. Using Cochran's formula with a confidence level of 95%, 383 students were selected as samples, while Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was applied as a method for data analysis. The result showed that the facility had made the learning process easy for students, which influenced its usefulness. The facility is related to the possession of the required tools and knowledge to utilize the technology, alongside the significant effect on ease of use and usefulness. When adequately provided, the ease and benefit of using Google Classroom are maximally felt when distance learning is ongoing. Consequently, the ease of use positively influenced the benefits of the platform as its features were simple and benefited the students during the learning process. The usefulness of Google Classroom also had a positive influence on attitude towards the platform, and this variable finally determined the intention to use, which was significantly influenced by the perceived usefulness of e-learning. Therefore, this study shows that factors that determine facility, such as the internet, devices used by students, or knowledge to use Google Classroom, are important in online learning during the Covid-19 pandemic. © ACPIL.","Fauzi, A.; Wandira, R.; Sepri, D.; Hafid, A.",Electronic Journal of e-Learning,https://doi.org/10.34190/ejel.19.4.2348,360

We note that, specifically in the area of fairness-accuracy trade-off optimization scholarship, similar attention is not paid to the normative assumptions that ground this approach. Such assumptions presume that 1) accuracy and fairness are in inherent opposition to one another, 2) strict notions of mathematical equality can adequately model fairness, 3) it is possible to measure the accuracy and fairness of decisions independent from historical context, and 4) collecting more data on marginalized individuals is a reasonable solution to mitigate the effects of the trade-off. We argue that such assumptions, which are often left implicit and unexamined, lead to inconsistent conclusions: While the intended goal of this work may be to improve the fairness of machine learning models, these unexamined, implicit assumptions can in fact result in emergent unfairness.

173589,Conversations editorial,2021,"In this study we demonstrate that the adoption of a segmenting and shielding (S&S) strategy could increase scope to partially exit COVID-19 lockdown while limiting the risk of an overwhelming second wave of infection. The S&S strategy has an antecedent in the ""cocooning"" of infants by immunisation of close family members (Forsyth et al., 2015), and forms a pillar of infection, prevention and control (IPC) strategies (RCN, 2017). We are unaware of it being proposed as a major public health initiative previously. We illustrate the S&S strategy using a mathematical model that segments the vulnerable population and their closest contacts, the ""shielders"". We explore the effects on the epidemic curve of a gradual ramping up of protection for the vulnerable population and a gradual ramping down of restrictions on the non-vulnerable population over a period of 12 weeks after lockdown. The most important determinants of outcome are: i) post-lockdown transmission rates within the general population segment and between the general and vulnerable segments; ii) the fraction of the population in the vulnerable and shielder segments; iii) adherence with need to be protected; and iv) the extent to which population immunity builds up in all segments. We explored the effects of extending the duration of lockdown and faster or slower transition to post-lockdown conditions and, most importantly, the trade-off between increased protection of the vulnerable segment and fewer restrictions on the general population. We illustrate how the potential for the relaxation of restrictions interacts with specific policy objectives. We show that the range of options for relaxation in the general population can be increased by maintaining restrictions on the shielder segment and by intensive routine screening of shielders. We find that the outcome of any future policy is strongly influenced by the contact matrix between segments and the relationships between physical distancing measures and transmission rates. These relationships are difficult to quantify so close monitoring of the epidemic would be essential during and after the exit from lockdown. More generally, S&S has potential applications for any infectious disease for which there are defined proportions of the population who cannot be treated or who are at risk of severe outcomes.","Bunnik, Bram A.D. van; Morgan, Alex L.K.; Bessell, Paul; Calder-Gerver, Giles; Zhang, Feifei; Haynes, Samuel; Ashworth, Jordan; Zhao, Shengyuan; Cave, Nicola Rose; Perry, Meghan R.; Lepper, Hannah C.; Lu, Lu; Kellam, Paul; Sheikh, Aziz; Medley, Graham F.; Woolhouse, Mark E.J.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.04.20090597,360
173717,"Disparate Recoveries: Wealth, Race, and the Working Class after the Great Recession",2021,"Featured ApplicationThe results of the presented research extend the methodology of economic analysis and risk assessment of large infrastructure projects.AbstractThis article deals with the partial outputs of large-scale infrastructure project risk assessment, specifically in the field of road and motorway construction. The Department of Transport spends a large amount of funds on project preparation and implementation, which however, must be allocated effectively, and with knowledge of the risks that may accompany them. Therefore, documentation for decision-making on project financing also includes their analysis. This article monitors the frequency of occurrence of individual risk factors within the qualitative risk analysis, with the support of the national risk register, and identifies dependent variables that represent part of the economic cash flows for determining project economic efficiency. At the same time, it compares these dependent variables identified by sensitivity analysis with critical variables, followed by testing the interaction of the critical variables’ effect on the project efficiency using the Monte Carlo method. A partial section of the research was focused on the analysis of the probability distribution of input variables, especially “the investment costs” and “time savings of infrastructure users” variables. The research findings conclude that it is necessary to pay attention to the setting of statistical characteristics of variables entering the economic efficiency indicator calculations, as the decision of whether or not to accept projects for funding is based on them.","Hromádka, Vít",Applied Sciences,https://doi.org/10.3390/app11010109,360
173901,I’m Somali and I’m Christian: A dilemma for religion and identity in the context of migration in Southern Africa,2021,"A climate-positive COVID-19 recovery can accelerate the energy transition away from fossil fuels. Yet, current assessments of recovery stimulus programs suggest that the most fossil fuel producers are more likely to take on a ‘dirty’ recovery path out of the pandemic than a ‘green’ one. Such a path will postpone climate action and entrench fossil fuel dependence. To change course, fossil fuel producers have to get on board of a 'green recovery'. For this, cooperative international efforts mobilizing both fossil fuel consumers and producers need to promote ‘just transition’ policies that increase support for a green shift among fossil fuel companies and producing countries, including fossil fuel exporters. In turn, fossil fuel producers should leverage the opportunity of stimulus packages to reduce their fossil fuel production dependence and help accelerate an energy transition through supply-side measures. A combination of ‘green’ investments and ‘just’ transition reforms could help enroll fossil fuel producers into a climate-friendly post-COVID recovery. Key policy insights Fossil fuel producers have mostly promoted ‘dirty’ rather than ‘green’ recovery paths from the COVID-19 pandemic A green recovery agenda requires a ‘just’ transition component to entice and support fossil fuel producers Both demand and supply-side strategies are required to advance a ‘just transition’ agenda throughout the post-COVID 19 recovery The post-COVID-19 transition requires energy policies responding to the constraints of consumer and producer countries to address climate and equity challenges Fossil fuel producers have mostly promoted ‘dirty’ rather than ‘green’ recovery paths from the COVID-19 pandemicA green recovery agenda requires a ‘just’ transition component to entice and support fossil fuel producersBoth demand and supply-side strategies are required to advance a ‘just transition’ agenda throughout the post-COVID 19 recoveryThe post-COVID-19 transition requires energy policies responding to the constraints of consumer and producer countries to address climate and equity challenges [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Climate Policy (Taylor & Francis Ltd) is the property of Taylor & Francis Ltd and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

173938,Key drivers for green building project financing in Ghana,2021,"Chase-escape percolation is a variation of the standard epidemic spread models. In this model, each site can be in one of three states: unoccupied, occupied by a single prey, or occupied by a single predator. Prey particles spread to neighboring empty sites at rate $p$, and predator particles spread only to neighboring sites occupied by prey particles at rate $1$, killing the prey particle that existed at that site. It was found that the prey can survive with non-zero probability, if $p>p_c$ with $p_c<1$. Using Monte Carlo simulations on the square lattice, we estimate the value of $p_c = 0.49451 \pm 0.00001$, and the critical exponents are consistent with the undirected percolation universality class. We define a discrete-time parallel-update version of the model, which brings out the relation between chase-escape and undirected bond percolation. For all $p<p_c$ in $D$-dimensions, the number of predators in the absorbing configuration has a stretched-exponential distribution in contrast to the exponential distribution in the standard percolation theory. We also study the problem starting from the line initial condition with predator particles on all lattice points of the line $y=0$ and prey particles on the line $y=1$. In this case, for $p_c<p<1$, the center of mass of the fluctuating prey and predator fronts travel at the same speed. This speed is strictly smaller than the speed of an Eden front with the same value of $p$, but with no predators. At $p=1$, the fronts undergo a depinning transition. The fluctuations of the front follow Kardar-Parisi-Zhang scaling both above and below this depinning transition.","Kumar, Aanjaneya; Grassberger, Peter; Dhar, Deepak",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.05310v2.pdf,360
174062,Does a Pro-Environmental Firm Attract Future Cash Flow? With an Impact of Sustainable Advertisement on Firms’ Financial Performance,2021,"N95 respirators and safety goggles are important components of personal protective equipment to reduce the spread of airborne infections, such as COVID-19, among healthcare workers. Poor N95 respirator seal may reduce its protective effect, thereby increasing transmission. Quantitative fit testing is an established way of assessing the N95 respirator fit, which provides a quantitative measure for seal, called the fit factor. Duckbill N95 respirators frequently fail the fit test. We hypothesized that using safety goggles with a wraparound elastic headband will increase their fit-factor by reinforcing the seal between the face and the upper margin of the respirator. We studied the effect of safety goggles with a wraparound elastic headband (3M (TM) Chemical Splash Resistant Goggles, ID 70006982741) on the fit factor of two types of Duckbill N95 respirators (Halyard FLUIDSHIELD*3, Model 99SA070M, and ProShield (R) N95 Model TN01-11) in 63 healthy volunteers in a nonrandomized, before-and-after intervention study design. The mean fit factor increased from 69.4 to 169.1 increased from 17/63 (27%) to 46/63 (73%) after the intervention (p <0.0001, OR 3 [95% CI = 4.9-1223]). This is the first study to explore the impact of safety goggles on N95 respirator fit. We conclude that the use of safety goggles with a wraparound elastic headband increases the fit factor of the tested Duckbill N95 respirators.","Johns, M.; Kyaw, S.; Lim, R.; Stewart, W.

174475,Influence of Population Income on Energy Consumption for Heating and Its CO2 Emissions in Cities,2021,"The impact of the pandemic and the lockdown has been more devastating than expected on the world economy. It is essential to formulate strategies in real-time. In this research, a multicriteria decision-making model for increasing the preparedness level of sales departments when facing COVID-19 waves and future pandemics is proposed. The model is comprised of 8 criteria, 29 sub-criteria, and 7 alternatives. The study is based on the integration of the AHP and TOPSIS techniques. AHP is used for calculating the criteria and sub-criteria weights. While, TOPSIS is used for calculating the preparedness level, ranking the companies, and identifying the weaknesses that should be addressed for increasing their effectiveness in the current market scenario. The model is developed with the aid of an experts’ group from the electrical appliance sector and studies from the reported literature. This application is completely novel in the literature and has been applied in the wild with remarkable companies in Colombia. A case study in the electrical appliance sector is presented as a pilot study but it should be noted that the methodology is flexible and scalable in any scenario. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Ortiz-Barrios, M.; Borrego-Areyanes, A.

174526,How Foreign- and U.S.-Born Latinos Fare during Recessions and Recoveries,2021,"Purpose: This study aims to make two major contributions. First, given the literature gap in housing unaffordability for different immigrant groups in Canada, it makes an essential contribution to the literature. To the best of the knowledge, this study is the first study of its kind to examine housing unaffordability by examining different immigrant groups. Second, differences in unaffordability can help understand the decline in welfare, as it can have financial implications and a negative impact on health outcomes. Third, this study’s findings are valuable for policy formulation to improve immigrant integration and ease the housing unaffordability crisis. Design/methodology/approach: This study examines the determinants of housing affordability to investigate differences among various immigrant groups in Canada. A bivariate logit model using public microdata from the Canadian census estimates the determinants of moderate and severe unaffordability. Additionally, the separation of tenants and owners provides insights into the dynamics of unaffordability. The results show significant differences between immigrant groups with higher levels of unaffordability among Asian immigrants. The insights can help devise and implement housing assistance programs to address the challenges arising from the post-COVID-19 pandemic phase. Findings: The results indicate that unaffordability declines with increasing age, education and full-time employment. Gender dynamics are evident, with women faring worse than men regarding the likelihood of extreme housing unaffordability. Households face a greater likelihood of unaffordability in more populous provinces and larger census metropolitan areas that struggle with the high cost of living, racial disparities and low income. Immigrants, especially from Asia, Africa and the Middle East, continue to struggle with chronic and severe unaffordability issues. The impact is much more severe for those renting, exemplifying the strain it is taking on the financial health of recent immigrants. Originality/value: Given the literature gap in housing unaffordability for different immigrant groups in Canada, it makes an essential contribution to the literature.

174541,Ambidexterity and Entrepreneurship Studies: A Literature Review and Research Agenda,2021,"Background: Increased rates of TE have been reported in patients (pts) with coronavirus disease (COVID-19), even without prior predisposition to thrombosis. Patients with cancer are already predisposed to a hypercoagulable state. We aimed to assess whether COVID-19 further increased the risk of TE in pts with active cancer at Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY. Methods: The EMR of 90 cancer pts diagnosed with COVID-19 from March 15 to April 10 , 2020 were reviewed. COVID-19 testing was performed by PCR of nasal swab samples. Active cancer was defined as disease treated &lt;1 year. Reports of imaging studies performed &lt;30 days of the COVID-19+ test, either for new symptoms or for other reasons, were reviewed for new arterial (ATE) and/or venous thromboses (VTE). Patient were followed for 30 days from the date of COVID-19+ test for development of TE, hospital length of stay (LOS) and mortality. Results: Of 90 pts, 11 (12.2%) were found to have 13 new TE within 30 days of COVID-19+ test, 8 (8.9%) arterial and 5 (5.6%) venous. Of the 8 ATE, 7 were new strokes and/or microvascular cerebral disease (MCD) and 1 was a spleen infarct (SI). Of the 5 VTE, 3 were deep venous thrombosis, 1 pulmonary embolism (PE) and 1 patient presented with a superficial VTE. Two patients had 2 new TE each;stroke/PE and MCD/SI, respectively. Peak Ddimer (DD) value was higher in the TE group;mean DD (SD), TE vs no TE, 7.1 (3.4) vs 6.4 (7) ug/mL, p=0.03. Pts on either prophylactic or therapeutic anticoagulation (AC) had less TE;AC vs no AC, 9.1% vs 90.9%, p=0.0003. Only 1 pt on Enoxaparin prophylaxis developed TE. Of the 20 pts on therapeutic AC, 25% were newly started due to concern for thrombosis;the rest were already receiving AC for other reasons. Mortality was higher in the TE group;HR, TE vs no TE, 2.6, 95% CI (1.2 - 5.6), p=0.009. There was no correlation of cancer type, disease stage (metastatic or not), administration of prior chemotherapy or immunotherapy, common comorbidities, patient setting (inpatient, ICU, outpatient, ED visit), LOS or ventilation status with increased incidence of TE. Conclusions: Pts with COVID-19 have high rates of TE, and this is true for our pts with cancer. A high incidence of ATE was noted. TE was associated with increased mortality.","Zavras, P.

174552,COVID-19 Analytics in Jupyter: Intuitive Provenance Integration Using ProvIt,2021,"Due to Covid-19, many working parents are facing new challenges. The aim of this paper is to share their personal experiences and the best recommendations for resolving their difficulties. We summarise their complex thoughts on the subject of the home office in relation to the household, homeschooling and the education of all concerned. In order to address this question, a qualitative research paradigm using WhatsApp as a medium in order to explore the following research questions was used: 1) How are employees able to manage the home office, homeschooling and the household under one roof? and 2) Will WFH and homeschooling disadvantage working mothers more than working fathers? Data were collected from 10 working parents (five males and five females) in Austria. According to coding, four major themes were explored: 1) Compatibility, 2) Work/home space, 3) Work week separation and 4) Suggestions and organisational recommendations. It was determined that at the beginning of the lockdown drawing a clear boundary between the home, office and school environments caused some difficulties. Especially parents with younger children experienced problems of compatibility. Secondly, flexibility and housing in relation to the home-office-school environment was a common topic throughout the interviews. Furthermore, before Covid-19 all participants had a more classic separation of roles. Roles and expectations changed as all the family members stayed at home day in and day out. Finally, in privileged situations (more living space, jobs that could be done remotely or support of the entire family), it was often easier to deal with the current challenges. This pandemic has brought many changes in everyday life and in terms of performing old tasks and new ones. This includes work at home and homeschooling. The obtained data provide important insights into how to deal with the impact of Covid-19 on work, home and school while emphasising the importance of these questions as well as of future research for support and information. © 2021 Michal Beno.

174605,Data-Driven Modeling to Facilitate Policymaking in Fighting to Contain the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"Background Reducing adult mortality by 2030 is a key component of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDGs). Monitoring progress towards these goals requires timely and reliable information on deaths by age, sex, and cause. To estimate baseline measures for UNSDGs, this study aimed to use several different data sources to estimate subnational measures of premature adult mortality (between 30 and 70 years) for India in 2017. Methods Age-specific population and mortality data were accessed for India and its 21 larger states from the Civil Registration System and Sample Registration System for 2017, and the most recent National Family and Health Survey. Similar data on population and deaths were also procured from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2016 and the National Burden of Disease Estimates Study for 2017. Life table methods were used to estimate life expectancy and age-specific mortality at national and state level from each source. An additional set of life tables were estimated using an international two-parameter model life table system. Three indicators of premature adult mortality were derived by sex for each location and from each data source, for comparative analysis Results Marked variations in mortality estimates from different sources were noted for each state. Assuming the highest mortality level from all sources as the potentially true value, premature adult mortality was estimated to cause a national total of 2.6 million male and 1.8 million female deaths in 2017, with Bihar, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal accounting for half of these deaths. There was marked heterogeneity in risk of premature adult mortality, ranging from 351 per 1000 in Kerala to 558 per 1000 in Chhattisgarh among men, and from 198 per 1000 in Himachal Pradesh to 409 per 1000 in Assam among women. Conclusions Available data and estimates for mortality measurement in India are riddled with uncertainty. While the findings from this analysis may be useful for initial subnational health policy to address UNSDGs, more reliable empirical data is required for monitoring and evaluation. For this, strengthening death registration, improving methods for cause of death ascertainment, and establishment of robust mortality statistics programs are a priority.","Rao, C.; Gupta, A.; Gupta, M.; Yadav, A.

The study controlled health-care expenditures, logistics performance index (LPI), carbon damages, and corporate social responsibility (CSR) to understand the nature of causation between the CFR and stated factors. Design/methodology/approach The study used a cross-sectional regression apparatus for coefficient estimates and variance decomposition analysis (VDA) for forecasting relationships between the variables over time. Findings The results confirmed the W-shaped relationship between CFR and case-to-test ratio (CTR) in the presence of a LPI that exacerbates the CFR cases across countries. The VDA estimates suggest that carbon damages, logistics activities, and CSR are likely to influence CFR over time. Originality/value To the best of the authors' knowledge, the study is believed to be the first study that assesses the W-shaped relationship between the CFR and CTR in the presence of dynamic variables, which helps to formulate long-term sustainable health-care policies worldwide.","Sasmoko, Lodhi M.

EV have been identified as potential biomarkers of disease severity and prognosis in other pulmonary diseases. We sought to characterize the EV phenotype within ARDS patient broncho-alveolar lavage fluid (BAL), and to determine whether BAL EV could be utilized as a potential biomarker in ARDS. EV from the BAL of sepsis patients with ARDS, sepsis patients without ARDS, and post-operative control patients were characterized with regards to size, number and cell of origin. ARDS patients had significantly higher numbers of CD14+/CD81+ monocyte-derived BAL EV than sepsis patients without ARDS (p=0.022). CD14+/CD81+ BAL EV numbers were significantly higher in those ARDS patients who died during the 30 days following ICU admission (p=0.027). Also, across all sepsis patients there was an association between CD66b+/CD63+ neutrophil-derived BAL EV and increased BAL IL-8 concentration, increased alveolar neutrophil apoptosis and decreased alveolar macrophage efferocytosis. Thus, CD14+/CD81+ BAL EV are a potential biomarker for disease severity and mortality in ARDS. These findings provide the impetus to further elucidate the contribution of these EV to ARDS pathogenesis.","Mahida, R. Y.; Price, J.; Lugg, S.

175245,Singularity and Coordination Problems: Pandemic Lessons from 2020,2020-10-07,"The topic of fake news is not new but its rise is fueled by the digital age era. The increased proliferation of fake news has been observed since the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) started, thus introducing controversy regarding its origin, conspiracies about 5G causing COVID-19 and COVID-19 home remedies or prevention methods. This information may be harmless, or could potentially pose a threat by misleading the population to depend on unjustified and unsubstantiated claims. Several studies worldwide are investing towards this topic, however, very little has been done in the South African context. Therefore, this study aims at analysing fake news about COVID-19 spread during the South African national lockdown on social media platforms and news outlets;together with the measures put in place by the government i.e. social relief funds and food parcels. This study took place between March 2020 and October 2020 whereby a Google form was used to collect data. The collected data was verified using fact-checking websites like Africa Check and techniques such as Google reverse image for image verification. Thereafter, the data was coded according to these categories, namely;misinformation, disinformation, malinformation, propaganda and scams, and annotated according to 11 annotation classes. The analysis showed that Twitter was the leading source of fake news at 59% followed by WhatsApp at 22%. In addition, most discussions were in reference to COVID-19 cures and treatments. Overtime, a correlation was observed between events (e.g., change in regulations) that occurred and the spread of fake news. To dispel and delegitimise the sources, a publicly accessible dashboard was created where all verified fake news were shared for easier access. This study has established an understanding of the nature of fake news and draws insights that offer practical guidance on how fake news may be combated in the future. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Mthethwa, S.; Dlamini, N.; Mkuzangwe, N.; Shibambu, A.; Boateng, T.; Mantsi, M.","3rd Multidisciplinary International Symposium on Disinformation in Open Online Media, MISDOOM 2021",https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-87031-7_5,360

175409,"The Crisis of Aesthetics, Aesthetics of Crisis",2021,"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The infection cycle starts in the respiratory tract with the binding of the virus spike S protein to the cellular ACE-2 receptor. The S protein has a trimeric structure determining a receptor binding domain (RBD) at its center, whereas the N-terminal domain (NTD) of each subunit, which displays a flat ganglioside-binding domain at its tip, is rejected at the periphery. Thus, the three NTDs form a tripod ideally suited for attracting the virus in lipid rafts where both gangliosides and ACE-2 reside. Molecular modeling studies suggested that this interaction can be blocked: (1) by hydroxychloroquine, which binds to gangliosides, (2) by azithromycin, which binds to the NTD, and (3) by neutralizing antibodies directed against the NTD. The aim of this chapter is to give some clues for studying, in silico, the different therapeutic and vaccine strategies based on the ganglioside-binding domain of the NTD of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein.","Fantini, J.",Methods Pharmacol.

Included 1000 samples as a healthcare worker involved in the study by used of convenience sampling technic, The study has been carried out in Iraqi, conducted throughout the period of April 15th, to July 19th, 2020. A self-administered questionnaire and Maslach Burnout Inventory Human Service Survey were used to collect data. Results: Overall, burnout were high level among 59.9 % of the participants in the study. High workload and intention to leave were associated with burnout at statistically significant (P&lt;0.05), and high significant relationship between demographic characteristics (age, gender, level of education, job title, work place ) and level of burnout (P&lt;0.05). Conclusions: The high level of burnout identified among health workers is mainly related to the high workload and psychological stress fronting them during COVID 19, as well as the lack of personal equipment necessary to protect themselves from this epidemic.","Jawad, M.

Jordanian universities and schools have also fully utilized long-distance education during this hard time. Furthermore, educational experts have emphasized that it will be used even when this pandemic is over, at least by integrating it into a traditional classroom method. In Jordan, tools such as E-learning platform namely Moodle, and meeting tools such as Zoom and Microsoft Teams have been widely used. It is a great necessity to evaluate the usability of these tools. This study aims to evaluate and compare the usability of the mentioned tools. We conducted this study using the System Usability Scale (SUS) questionnaire, which mainly focuses on ease of use, efficiency, and easy to learn.

(Special Issue: Paths out of poverty.),2021,"Introduction: Immunological markers have been described during COVID-19 and persist after recovery. Those immune alterations are associated with clinical features among SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals. Although, studies reporting a comprehensive analysis of these immune alterations are still limited. Objective: To evaluate the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, antibody response, and phenotype and function of NK cells and T cells in a Colombian familiar cluster of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Materials and methods: Proinflammatory cytokines were evaluated by RT-PCR and ELISA. Frequency, phenotype and function of NK cells (cocultures with K562 cells) and T-cells (stimulated with Spike/RdRp peptides) were assessed by flow cytometry;anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were determined by indirect immunofluorescence and plaque reduction neutralization assay. Results: During COVID-19, we observed a high pro-inflammatory cytokine production and reduced CD56bright NK cells and cytotoxic response. Compared with healthy controls, infected individuals had a higher frequency of dysfunctional CD8+ T cells CD38+HLA-DR-. During the acute phase, CD8+ T cells stimulated with viral peptides exhibited a monofunctional response characterized by a high IL-10 production. Nevertheless, during recovery, a bifunctional response was observed, characterized by the co-expression of CD107a and Granzyme B or Perforin. Conclusion: Although pro-inflammatory response is a hallmark of SARS-CoV-2 infection, other phenotypic and functional alterations in NK cells and CD8+ T cells could be associated with the outcome of COVID-19. However, additional studies are required to understand these alterations and, to guide future immunotherapy strategies.","Aguilar-Jimenez, W.; Florez-Alvarez, L.; Rincon, D.

176601,IoT-Based Smart Management of Healthcare Services in Hospital Buildings during COVID-19 and Future Pandemics,2021,"Smart wristbands and watches have become an important accessory to fitness, but their application to healthcare is still in a fledgling state. Their long-term wear facilitates extensive data collection and evolving sensitivity of smart wristbands allows them to read various body vitals. In this paper, we hypothesized the use of heart rate variability (HRV) measurements to drive an algorithm that can pre-empt the onset or worsening of an affliction. Due to its significance during the time of the study, SARS-Cov-2 was taken as the case study, and a hidden Markov model (HMM) was trained over its observed symptoms. The data used for the analysis was the outcome of a study hosted by Welltory. It involved the collection of SAR-Cov-2 symptoms and reading of body vitals using Apple Watch, Fitbit, and Garmin smart bands. The internal states of the HMM were made up of the absence and presence of a consistent decline in standard deviation of NN intervals (SSDN), the root mean square of the successive differences (rMSSD) in R-R intervals, and low frequency (LF), high frequency (HF), and very low frequency (VLF) components of the HRV measurements. The emission probabilities of the trained HMM instance confirmed that the onset or worsening of the symptoms had a higher probability if the HRV components displayed a consistent decline state. The results were further confirmed through the generation of probable hidden states sequences using the Viterbi algorithm. The ability to pre-empt the exigent state of an affliction would not only lower the chances of complications and mortality but may also help in curbing its spread through intelligence-backed decisions.","Gatha, Tanwar Ritu Chauhan Singh M.; Singh, D.",Sensors,https://doi.org/10.3390/s20247068/,360

These data will inform SARS-CoV-2 natural history, transmission dynamics, prevention practices, and therapeutic development. Objective: To prospectively characterize early SARS-CoV-2 viral shedding in persons with incident infection. Design: Prospective cohort study. Setting: Secondary data analysis from a multicenter study in the U.S. Participants: The samples derived from a randomized controlled trial of 829 community-based asymptomatic participants recently exposed (<96 hours) to persons with SARS-CoV-2. Participants collected daily mid-turbinate swabs for SARS-CoV-2 detection by polymerase-chain-reaction and symptom diaries for 14-days. Persons with negative swab for SARS-CoV-2 at baseline who developed infection during the study were included in the analysis. Exposure: Laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Main outcomes and measures: The observed SARS-CoV-2 viral shedding characteristics were summarized and shedding trajectories were examined using a piece-wise linear mixed-effects modeling. Whole viral genome sequencing was performed on samples with cycle threshold (Ct)<34. Results: Ninety-seven persons (57% women, median age 37-years) developed incident infections during 14-days of follow-up. Two-hundred fifteen sequenced samples were assigned to 15 lineages that belonged to the G614 variant. Forty-two (43%), 18(19%), and 31(32%) participants had viral shedding for 1 day, 2-6 days, and >7 days, with median peak viral load Ct of 38.5, 36.7, and 18.3, respectively. Six (6%) participants had 1-6 days of observed viral shedding with censored duration. The peak average viral load was observed on day 3 of viral shedding. The average Ct value was lower, indicating higher viral load, in persons reporting COVID-19 symptoms than asymptomatic. Using the statistical model, the median time from shedding onset to peak viral load was 1.4 days followed by a median of 9.7 days before clearance. Conclusions and Relevance: Incident SARS-CoV-2 G614 infection resulted in a rapid viral load peak followed by slower decay and positive correlation between peak viral load and shedding duration; duration of shedding was heterogeneous. This longitudinal evaluation of the SARS-CoV-2 G614 variant with frequent molecular testing may serve as a reference for comparing emergent viral lineages to inform clinical trial designs and public health strategies to contain the spread of the virus.","Stankiewicz Karita, H.

176634,Communities on a Threshold: Climate Action and Wellbeing Potentialities in Scotland,2021,"The huge body of publicly available RNA-seq libraries is a treasure of functional information allowing to quantify the expression of known or novel transcripts in tissues. However, transcript quantification commonly relies on alignment methods requiring a lot of computational resources and processing time, which does not scale easily to large datasets. K-mer decomposition constitutes a new way to process RNA-seq data for the identification of transcriptional signatures, as k-mers can be used to quantify accurately gene expression in a less resource-consuming way. We present the Kmerator Suite, a set of three tools designed to extract specific k-mer signatures, quantify these k-mers into RNA-seq datasets and quickly visualize large datasets characteristics. The core tool, Kmerator, produces specific k-mers for 97% of human genes, enabling the measure of gene expression with high accuracy in simulated datasets. KmerExploR, a direct application of Kmerator, uses a set of predictor genes specific k-mers to infer metadata including library protocol, sample features or contaminations from RNA-seq datasets. KmerExploR results are visualised through a user-friendly interface. Moreover, we demonstrate that the Kmerator Suite can be used for advanced queries targeting known or new biomarkers such as mutations, gene fusions or long non coding-RNAs for human health applications.","Riquier, Sébastien; Bessiere, Chloé; Guibert, Benoit; Bouge, Anne-Laure; Boureux, Anthony; Ruffle, Florence; Audoux, Jérôme; Gilbert, Nicolas; Xue, Haoliang; Gautheret, Daniel; Commes, Thérèse",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.20.444982,360

All the 17 SDGs are interlinked. For instance, quality education (SDG4) reduces poverty (SDG 1,2) and inequalities (SDG10) and stimulates good health and wellbeing (SDG3). The paper applied unorthodox theoretical postulations such as convergence models, intergovernmentalism, neofunctionalism and neorealism in explaining how functional (educational) institutions are a necessary enabling environment in accelerating the attainment of SDGs. Empirically, the paper identified unclear modus operandi, lack of political will, political instability, small and fragmented markets and economies with heterogeneous characteristics, and lack of standardization of product and procedures, among other factors, as constraints to sustainability in tertiary education. A Vector Autoregressive (VAR) model was employed using data from 51 Sub-Saharan countries. The three variables were gross domestic product per capita (GDPP), governance and tertiary education expenditure. Results indicated significant short-run unidirectional causality from gross domestic product per capita and tertiary education expenditure to governance, but joint short-run causality was not established. However, transmission effects across the three variables became significant as the number of years increased to ten years. The study recommends a holistic approach from policymakers in order to ensure sustainability in tertiary education due to interlinkages, with emphasis placed on direction of causality.","Pasara, Michael Takudzwa",Education Sciences,https://doi.org/10.3390/educsci11070343,360

Understanding the impact of classifier tuning on the results obtained will allow the users to apply the provided tools consciously. Therefore, using a given screening test they will be able to choose the threshold value characterising the classifier that gives, for example, an acceptable balance between sensitivity and specificity. The presented work introduces the optimisation approach and the resulting classifiers obtained for various quality threshold assumptions.

While many biomedical research outputs are more readily accessible through open data efforts, finding relevant outputs remains a significant challenge. Schema.org is a metadata vocabulary standardization project that enables web content creators to make their content more FAIR. Leveraging Schema.org could benefit biomedical research resource providers, but it can be challenging to apply Schema.org standards to biomedical research outputs. We created an online browser-based tool that empowers researchers and repository developers to utilize schema.org or other biomedical schema projects. Results Our browser-based tool includes features which can help address many of the barriers towards schema.org-compliance such as: The ability to easily browse for relevant Schema.org classes, the ability to extend and customize a class to be more suitable for biomedical research outputs, the ability to create data validation to ensure adherence of a research output to a customized class, and the ability to register a custom class to our schema registry enabling others to search and re-use it. We demonstrate the use of our tool with the creation of the Outbreak.info schema—a large multi-class schema for harmonizing various COVID-19 related resources.

METHODS: We collected routine clinical and laboratory parameters and derived inflammatory indexes on admission in 65 consecutive COVID-19 patients transferred to the Unit of Respiratory and Infectious Disease of the University Hospital of Sassari (North-Sardinia, Italy) who were alive on discharge. RESULTS: Patients with prolonged length of stay (LOS) (PLOS &gt;= 26 days, N.=22) had significantly higher chest CT severity scores, neutrophils, neutrophil lymphocyte ratio (NLR), aggregate index of systemic inflammation, Systemic Inflammation Response Index, Systemic Inflammation Index (SII), aspartate aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and rates of obesity and respiratory support, than non-PLOS patients (N.=43). In univariate analysis, LOS was significantly and negatively correlated with lymphocytes and monocytes, and positively correlated with Body Mass Index (BMI), intensity of care, chest CT severity score, NLR, platelet lymphocyte ratio, SII and LDH. In multivariate regression analysis, only the SII was significantly associated with LOS (beta=0.506, P=0.002) after adjusting for BMI, intensity of care, chest CT severity score and LDH. CONCLUSIONS: SII values on admission were independently associated with LOS in COVID-19 patients. Prospective studies in larger cohorts are required to confirm our findings and to determine the role of the SII in clinical decision making.","Zinellu, A.; Scano, V.; Masotto, E.; De Riu, G.; Vaira, L.

In South Africa, the COVID-19 vaccine roll-out plan will first prioritise key frontline forces, the elderly and those with comorbidities. Although there is some new academic insight on COVID-19 within the context of churches, not much has been written on the role that churches can play in partnership with government towards procuring vaccines for the poor people of South Africa. The contribution towards vaccine procurement by churches is juxtaposed with the proclamation of the year of the Lord’s favour in Luke 4:18–19 and the feeding of 5000 men (excluding women and children) in Matthew 14:13–21, Mark 6:30–44, John 6:1–14 and Luke 9:10–17. This is done against an environment where corruption in the procurement of personal protective equipment, unjust food parcel distribution and subverted relief packages occurred during the hard lockdown of 2020. This article makes use of both missio Dei and missio hominum as its missiological theory in conformity with calls for public health restoration during and after COVID-19. It employs a literature review to support missio Dei and missio hominum as compassion and fundraising for the poor in the face of COVID-19, as exemplified by Paul in 1 Corinthians 16:1–4 and Jesus in Mark 6:8 and Luke 8:1–3. Contribution: In order to preserve lives that would otherwise be lost whilst waiting for the COVID-19 vaccine, this article entreats all churches of South Africa to launch a nationwide church fundraising effort towards procuring COVID-19 vaccines for the poor following the example of the Solidarity Fund, which was established by President Cyril Ramaphosa as one of the early interventions to cushion the impact of COVID-19.","Thinane, Jonas S.",Hervormde Teologiese Studies,https://doi.org/10.4102/hts.v77i3.6544,360

Social restrictions, changes in habits, and permanent stay at home might have a negative impact on the psychological state of people. The purpose of our study is to conduct a psycholinguistic analysis of pandemic narratives to identify markers of traumatic experience and identify possible gender differences. The sample consisted of 167 respondents (72 % females). The mean age of participants was 21.09 years (SD = 4.52). The study was conducted in Ukraine online in 2020, during the second wave of lockdown. The audience was asked to write a narrative on “How my life changed during the Covid-19 pandemic. Personal experience.” As a result, we have found psycholinguistic markers that confirm the traumatic experience, among them are markers of time, depersonalization, and affective processes. A clear distinction of experience before and after the pandemic was detected in the narratives. This is characteristic of traumatic experience. In samples, such a distinction is made using the words “was” and “became”. The psychological marker of affective processes indicates immersion in a traumatic event. This discomposure is reflected in the manifestation of negative emotions through the words “bad”, “problems”, “critical”, and “difficult”. The main semantic markers in pandemic narratives are time and life. The life marker was meaningfully represented by stories about social limitations and physical health. Distinctions in pandemic descriptions of men and women have been revealed as psycholinguistic and semantic markers are different. Narratives of women are larger, they use more words (pronouns, adverbs and conjunctions, interrogatives and quantifiers) than men. Regarding content, men are more likely to talk about affective processes, while women − about social and biological ones. Our study is a maiden attempt to reflect on the pandemic as a traumatic event within the collective experience. © Kostruba, Natalia, 2021.

Methods: SIGLEC1 was analysed by flow cytometry in our central laboratory facility in 232 patients referred to our institution with suspected SLE between October 2015 and September 2020. Results: SLE was confirmed in 76 of 232 patients (32.8%) according to the 2019 EULAR/ACR classification criteria and their . SIGLEC1 values were significantly higher in patients with SLE compared to patients without SLE (p<0.0001). A sensitivity of 98.7 %, a specificity of 82.1 %, a negative predictive value (NPV) of 99.2 % and a positive predictive value (PPV) of 72.8 % were calculated for SIGLEC1. Adjusted to the highest reported prevalence of SLE, the NPV and PPV were > 99.9 % and 0.1 %, respectively. Using ROC analysis and DeLlong testing, the area under the curve (AUC) for SIGLEC1 (AUC=0.95) was significantly higher than for ANA (AUC=0.88, p=0.031), C3 (AUC=0.83, p=0.001) and C4 (AUC=0.83, p=0.002) but not for anti-dsDNA antibodies (AUC=0.90, p=0.163). Conclusion: IFN-I pathway activation is detectable in almost most all newly diagnosed SLE patients, where SIGLEC1 outcompetes the performance of other biomarkers to exclude SLE with high predictability in suspected cases. Thus, a negative test result for SIGLEC1 is powerful to exclude SLE in suspected cases.","Zorn-Pauly, L.; von Stuckrad, A. S.

Here, we found that myeloid-biased MPP3 (2, 3) are functionally and molecularly heterogeneous, with a distinct subset of myeloid-primed secretory cells with high endoplasmic reticulum (ER) volume and FcγR expression. We show that FcγR+/ERhigh MPP3 are a transitional population for rapid production of granulocyte/macrophage progenitors (GMP), which directly amplify myelopoiesis through inflammation-triggered secretion of cytokines in the local bone marrow (BM) microenvironment. Our results identify a novel regulatory function for a subset of secretory MPP3 that controls myeloid differentiation through lineage-priming and cytokine production, and act as a self-reinforcing amplification compartment in stress and disease conditions.

Zonally averaged ozone in the free troposphere during Northern Hemisphere spring and summer is found 5 to 15% lower than 19-year climatological values, in good agreement with observations. About one third of this anomaly is attributed to the reduction scenario of air traffic during the pandemic, another third to the reduction scenario of surface emissions, the remainder to 2020 meteorological conditions, including the exceptional springtime Arctic stratospheric ozone depletion. For the combined emission reductions, the overall COVID-19 reduction in northern hemisphere tropospheric ozone in June is less than 5 ppb below 400 hPa, but reaches 8 ppb at 250 hPa.

Methods: This prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded-endpoint, multicenter, parallel-group, comparative study included 340 subjects with T2DM but no history of apparent CVD recruited at 24 clinical units. Subjects were randomly allocated to either the tofogliflozin treatment group (n=169) or conventional treatment group using drugs other than SGLT2 inhibitors (n=171). Primary outcomes were changes in mean and maximum common carotid IMT measured by echography during a 104-week treatment period. Findings: Although the mean IMT of the common carotid artery (mean-IMT-CCA), along with the right and left maximum IMT of the CCA (max-IMT-CCA), statistically significantly declined in both the tofogliflozin (-0.132 mm, SE 0.007;-0.163 mm, SE 0.013;-0.170 mm, SE 0.020;respectively) and the control group (-0·140 mm, SE 0·006;-0·190 mm, SE 0·012;-0·190 mm, SE 0·020;respectively), no significant difference was observed between the two groups. Relative to the control treatment effects, tofogliflozin statistically significantly reduced the HbA1c, blood glucose level, body weight/body mass index, abdominal circumference, and systolic blood pressure, and statistically significantly increased the HDL-C. Interpretation: A tofogliflozin treatment regimen of 104 weeks was not associated with improved inhibition of carotid wall thickening in T2DM patients without apparent CVD, as compared to the effect of the control treatment.

178501,Media Consumption and Media Behavior of Contemporary Russian Youth as Constructs of Protest Identity,2021,"Generative adversarial networks (GANs) exhibit training pathologies that can lead to convergence-related degenerative behaviors, whereas spatially-distributed, coevolutionary algorithms (CEAs) for GAN training, e.g. Lipizzaner, are empirically robust to them. The robustness arises from diversity that occurs by training populations of generators and discriminators in each cell of a toroidal grid. Communication, where signals in the form of parameters of the best GAN in a cell propagate in four directions: North, South, West and East, also plays a role, by communicating adaptations that are both new and fit. We propose Lipi-Ring, a distributed CEA like Lipizzaner, except that it uses a different spatial topology, i.e. a ring. Our central question is whether the different directionality of signal propagation (effectively migration to one or more neighbors on each side of a cell) meets or exceeds the performance quality and training efficiency of Lipizzaner. Experimental analysis on different datasets (i.e, MNIST, CelebA, and COVID-19 chest X-ray images) shows that there are no significant differences between the performances of the trained generative models by both methods. However, Lipi-Ring significantly reduces the computational time (14.2%... 41.2%). Thus, Lipi-Ring offers an alternative to Lipizzaner when the computational cost of training matters. © 2021 Owner/Author.","Toutouh, J.; O039,; Reilly, U.

Design/methodology/approach: The nature of this study is qualitative, attempting to indulge into the contribution of Fintech in Islamic social finance. This study uses a mixed-method to gauge the perception of stakeholders. For the quantitative approach, a survey was carried out focussing on zakah receiver and zakah payer. The data then was analysed based on the technology acceptance model. While interview survey with multiple stakeholders (zakah institutions, JAWHAR and university) was conducted to gauge the perception of zakah institutions in using blockchain technology. Findings: The findings of this study provide a positive view for zakah institutions to embrace the usage of blockchain in its management, however, there are several concern that needs to be addressed. Practical implications: This study provides new insights to the body of knowledge especially in the zakah management system and Fintech. Besides, from a managerial aspect, this study contributes to the new practices that could be implemented in zakah institutions. Social implications: Many people lose jobs and income due to the economic turmoil and COVID-19 pandemic, which makes zakah an important Islamic social finance tool to assist in socio-economic development. It is high time for zakah institutions to implement blockchain especially during this pandemic crisis that requires a more contactless approach to ensure health and safety. Originality/value: This study is important to encourage Islamic social finance institutions to embrace blockchain technology in providing an efficient service to the development of social and economic. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Mohd Nor, S.; Abdul-Majid, M.; Esrati, S.

179286,Corona-Warn-App: Tracing the Start of the Official COVID-19 Exposure Notification App for Germany,2020-07-25,"Background: Intrahospital transfers have become more common as hospital staff balance patient needs with bed availability. However, this may leave patients more vulnerable to potential pathogen transmission routes via increased exposure to contaminated surfaces and contacts with individuals. Objective: This study aimed to quantify the association between the number of intrahospital transfers undergone during a hospital spell and the development of a hospital-acquired infection (HAI). Methods: A retrospective case-control study was conducted using data extracted from electronic health records and microbiology cultures of non-elective, medical admissions to a large urban hospital trust comprising 3 hospital sites between 2016 and 2018 (n=24,239). As elderly patients comprise a large proportion of hospital users and are a high-risk population for HAIs, the analysis focused on those over 65-years old. Logistic regression was conducted to obtain the odds ratio (OR) for developing a HAI as a function of intrahospital transfers until onset of HAI for cases, or hospital discharge for controls, while controlling for age, gender, time-at-risk, Elixhauser comorbidities, hospital site of admission, dominant treatment function code, intensive care admission, total number of procedures, and discharge destination. Results: Of the 24,239 spells, 2879 cases were included in the analysis. 72.2% of spells contained at least one intrahospital transfer. On multivariable analysis, each additional intrahospital transfer increased the odds of acquiring a HAI by 9% (OR 1.09; 95%CI 1.05 to 1.13). Conclusion: Intrahospital transfers are associated with increased odds of developing a HAI. Strategies for minimising intrahospital transfers should be considered, and further research is needed to identify unnecessary transfers. Their reduction may diminish spread of contagious pathogens in the hospital environment.","Boncea, E.; Expert, P.; Honeyford, K.; Kinderlerer, A.; Mitchell, C.; Cooke, G.

179438,Factors Affecting the Lut Desert Tourism in Iran: Developing an Interpretive-Structural Model,2021,"SARS-CoV-2 is a single-stranded RNA betacoronavirus with a high mutation rate. The rapidly emerged SARS-CoV-2 variants could increase the transmissibility, aggravate the severity, and even fade the vaccine protection. Although the coinfections of SARS-CoV-2 with other respiratory pathogens have been reported, whether multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants coinfection exists remains controversial. This study collected 12,986 and 4,113 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from the GISAID database on May 11, 2020 (GISAID20May11) and April 1, 2021 (GISAID21Apr1), respectively. With the single-nucleotide variants (SNV) and network clique analysis, we constructed the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) coexistence networks and noted the SNP number of the maximal clique as the coinfection index. The coinfection indices of GISAID20May11 and GISAID21Apr1 datasets were 16 and 34, respectively. Simulating the transmission routes and the mutation accumulations, we discovered the linear relationship between the coinfection index and the coinfected variant number. Based on the linear relationship, we deduced that the COVID-19 cases in the GISAID20May11 and GISAID21Apr1 datasets were coinfected with 2.20 and 3.42 SARS-CoV-2 variants on average. Additionally, we performed Nanopore sequencing on 42 COVID-19 patients to explore the virus mutational characteristics. We found the heterozygous SNPs in 41 COVID-19 cases, which support the coinfection of SARS-CoV-2 variants and challenge the accuracy of phylogenetic analysis. In conclusion, our findings reported the coinfection of SARS-CoV-2 variants in COVID-19 patients, demonstrated the increased coinfected variants number in the epidemic, and provided clues for the prolonged viral shedding and severe symptoms in some cases.","Li, Yinhu; Jiang, Yiqi; Li, Zhengtu; Yu, Yonghan; Chen, Jiaxing; Jia, Wenlong; Ng, Yen Kaow; Ye, Feng; Shen, Bairong; Li, Shuai Cheng",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.06.459196,360

Whether survivors of mild or asymptomatic infections can expect any long-term health consequences is not yet known. Herein we investigated lasting changes to soluble inflammatory factors and cellular immune phenotype and function in individuals who had recovered from mild SARS-CoV-2 infections (n=22) compared to those that had recovered from other mild respiratory infections (n=11). Individuals who had mild SARS-CoV-2 infections had elevated levels of C-reactive protein 1-3 months after symptom onset, and changes in phenotype and function of circulating T cells that were not apparent in individuals 6-9 months post-symptom onset. Markers of monocyte activation and expression of adherence and chemokine receptors indicative of altered migratory capacity were also higher at 1-3 months post-infection in individuals who had mild SARS-CoV-2, but these were no longer elevated by 6-9 months post-infection. Perhaps most surprisingly, polyclonal activation of T cells was higher in individuals who had recently experienced a mild SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to individuals with other recent respiratory infections. These data are indicative of prolonged immune activation and systemic inflammation that persists for up to three months after mild or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections.","Kennedy, A.

179537,Ken Hyland Second Language Writing,2020-05-07,"There are still mathematical predictions in the fight against epidemics. Speedy expansion, ways and procedures for the pandemic control require early understanding when solutions with better computer-based mathematical modeling and prognosis are developed. Despite high uncertainty in each of these models, one of the important tools for public health management system is epidemiology models. The fractional order is shown to be more effective in modeling epidemic diseases, in relation to the memory effects. Notably, recently founded calculus tools, called fractal-fractional calculus, having a fractional order and fractal dimension, enable us to study the behavior of a real-world problem under both fractal and fractional tools. This paper is about the dynamical behavior of a new mathematical model of novel corona disease (COVID-19) under the fractal-fractional Atangana–Baleanu derivative. The considered model has three compartments, namely, susceptible, infected and recovered or removed (SIR). The existence and uniqueness of the model’s solution will be proved via Krasnoselskii’s and Banach’s fixed point theorems, respectively. The stability of the solution in the sense of Hyers–Ulam (HU) will be built up by nonlinear functional analysis. Moreover, the numerical simulations for different values of isolation parameters corresponding to various fractal-fractional orders are analyzed using fractional Adams–Bashforth (AB) method with two-step Lagrange polynomial. Finally, the obtained simulation results are applied to the real data of disease spread from Pakistan. The graphical interpretations demonstrate that increasing the isolation parameters which is caused by strict precautionary measures will reduce the disease infection transmission in society.

We propose a discrete mathematical model with control strategies using three controls that represent, respectively, uk, which represents awareness of the dangers of electronic games through written and visual media;vk, which represents the effort to direct children and adolescents to educational and entertaining alternative means;and wk, which represents creating rehabilitation centers for addicts to quit electronic game addiction. To characterize optimal controls, we use Pontryagin’s maximum principle and the system of optimality solved by an iterative method. Finally, numerical simulations are presented with and without controls. Using a cost-effectiveness analysis, we will show that the control that represents the creation of rehabilitation centers for gaming addicts is the most cost-effective strategy to control the spread of gaming addiction.","Kada, Driss Khajji Bouchaib Balatif Omar Rachik Mostafa Labriji El Houssine",Discrete Dynamics in Nature and Society,https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/5584315,360

They can also improve the public transportation by connecting city centers with main mass transit systems. The development of technologies that can provide a sense of security to the passenger when the driver is missing remains a challenging task. Moreover, such technologies are forced to adopt to the new reality formed by the COVID-19 pandemic, as it has created significant restrictions to passenger mobility through public transportation. In this work, an image-based approach, supported by novel AI algorithms, is proposed as a service to increase autonomy of non-fully autonomous people such as kids, grandparents and disabled people. The proposed real-time service, can identify family members via facial characteristics and efficiently ignore face masks, while providing notifications for their condition to their supervisor relatives.

Methods: A community-based cross-sectional observational study was conducted. Data was collected using a self-constructed online google survey tool from July 2020 to August 2020. Results: Out of a total 1083 sample, a higher proportion of the participants (41.3%) belonged to the 34-49 years age group, followed by the age group of 50-65 (32.5%). The sample was almost equally distributed; about 51.9% of the population was male, and 48.4% were female. The COVID-19 positivity was recorded almost double (3.1%) in groups not practicing 3SRB exercises compared to a group (1.3%) practicing 3SRB exercises. Furthermore, the practice of 3SRB was significantly associated with a lower percentage of COVID-19 infection (p=0.046). Conclusions: Practice of 3SRB is significantly associated with a lower percentage of COVID-19 infection.

Children's understanding of perception and physical interaction over video chat,2021,"BACKGROUND: The biological processes associated with post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) are unknown. METHODS: We measured soluble markers of inflammation in a SARS-CoV-2 recovery cohort at early (<90 days) and late (>90 days) timepoints. We defined PASC as the presence of one or more COVID-19-attributed symptoms beyond 90 days. We compared fold-changes in marker values between those with and without PASC using mixed effects models with terms for PASC and early and late recovery time periods. RESULTS: During early recovery, those who went on to develop PASC generally had higher levels of cytokine biomarkers including TNF-alpha (1.14-fold higher mean ratio, 95%CI 1.01-1.28, p=0.028) and IP-10 (1.28-fold higher mean ratio, 95%CI 1.01-1.62, p=0.038). Among those with PASC, there was a trend toward higher IL-6 levels during early recovery (1.28-fold higher mean ratio, 95%CI 0.98-1.70, p=0.07) which became more pronounced in late recovery (1.44-fold higher mean ratio, 95%CI: 1.11-1.86, p<0.001). These differences were more pronounced among those with a greater number of PASC symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Persistent immune activation may be associated with ongoing symptoms following COVID-19. Further characterization of these processes might identify therapeutic targets for those experiencing PASC.","Peluso, M. J.; Lu, S.; Tang, A. F.; Durstenfeld, M. S.; Ho, H.-e.; Goldberg, S.

The COVID-19 disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus first appeared in Wuhan, China, and is considered a serious disease due to its high permeability, and contagiousness. Patients with COVID-19 may suffer from cough, fever, tiredness, dyspnea, and other signs and symptoms similar to those of tuberculosis (TB) and other respiratory infections disease. The similarity of COVID-19 disease with other lung infections, along with its high spreading rate, makes the diagnosis difficult. Solutions based on machine learning techniques achieved relevant results in identifying the correct disease and providing early diagnosis, and can hence provide significant clinical decision support;however, such approaches suffer from the lack of proper means for interpreting the choices made by the models, especially in case of deep learning ones. With the aim to improve interpretability and explainability in the process of making qualified decisions, we designed a system that allows a partial opening of this black box by means of proper investigations on the rationale behind the decisions. We tested our approach over artificial neural networks trained for multiple classifications based on Chest X-ray images;our tool analyzed the internal processes performed by the networks during the classification tasks to identify the most important elements involved in the training process that influence the network’s decisions. We report the results of an experimental analysis aimed at assessing the viability of the proposed approach. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Bruno, P.; Calimeri, F.","19th International Conference of the Italian Association for Artiﬁcial Intelligence, AIxIA 2020",https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-77091-4_3,360

Prior to COVID19, agents held in-person community forums to gather input and community priorities for interventions. COVID19 spurred innovation in this process. Although many states have used videoconferencing services to host meetings, lack of functional internet access posed a barrier for many communities in Louisiana. To gather broad community input through Qualtrics surveys in order to assess needs and assets, guide project prioritization, and gather feedback on previous projects. Qualtrics surveys were distributed via email to community members, stakeholders, and partners serving low-income audiences. Three surveys solicited feedback for existing Healthy Communities coalitions (n = 45);1 survey gathered initial input for a newly formed Healthy Communities coalition (n = 63). The overall response rate across all surveys was 23.6%. Survey responses to community health and engagement questions were separated by counties and analyzed through qualitative content analysis. The research team worked with Extension agents to conduct member checking through discussing survey results with participants. One hundred and eight responses were received from 4 communities. Extension agents reported high satisfaction with the process. Surveys provided action items and potential new coalition members. Across all 4 communities, common themes included acknowledging racial health disparities, a need for greater community involvement in coalition efforts, and a lack of healthy food options. Qualtrics surveys were an effective way to gather community input and allowed wider participation than would have been possible with a virtual meeting. Post-COVID, agents plan to continue to solicit community input through Qualtrics surveys, in addition to face-to-face forums. This method is a valuable tool for lower-income and rural communities. Results reflected an awareness of low community engagement, racial health disparities and limited healthy food access. Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program - Education.

During this tough and critical situation, one of the major concerns is dealing with pregnant women across the globe. As we have been noticing in the past one year of observation in our country, the number of active pregnancies has been increasing during the period of lockdown in the country. Pregnant women getting affected by COVID-19 can be a risk to them and their babies. They may show symptoms or can be asymptomatic, which makes it difficult to diagnose in the very first place. In the whole scenario, patients undergoing this situation expect distinguished attention from the medical fraternity.

181681,Segmentation and Measurement of Lung Pathological Changes for COVID-19 Diagnosis Based on Computed Tomography,2021,"Nurses who work on the front-line and are involved in caring for COVID-19 patients have a high risk of transmission. The increase in the number of confirmed and suspected cases, followed by an increase in workload, a limitation of personal protection equipment, a lack of effective treatment, and inadequate emotional support may contribute to the work intention during a pandemic. Purpose: This study aimed to describe nurses’ intention to work and provide care when people may be at risk of the COVID-19 and examine its relating factors. Methods: This was a cross-sectional and survey-based study that collected the respondents' characteristics and the intention to work measurements from 238 nurses in 36 hospitals in West Sumatera, Indonesia. Data analysis was performed using descriptive statistics, T-tests, and ANOVA. Results: The mean and standard deviation scores of nurses’ intention to work during the COVID-19 outbreak were 42.49±5.92. The isolation experience, the presence of authorized beds for COVID-19, and sufficient protection equipment supply, were correlated to the intention to work (p=0.016, p=0.035, p=0.000). Nurse respondents expected that hospital managers should provide more attention to nurses who agreed to attend to work during the COVID-19 outbreak. Conclusion: Nurses showed preserved intention to work during the COVID-19 outbreak. The factors correlated with intention to work were isolation experience, the presence of authorized beds for COVID-19, and protection equipment supply. The government and hospital management should ensure strategies and regulations to provide adequate hospital protective equipment supplies. They should also support compensations to nurses who actively care for patients during the COVID-19 outbreak.","Mailani, Fitri; Huriani, Emil; Muthia, Rahmi; Sarfika, Rika; en,",Nurse Media Journal Of Nursing,https://doi.org/10.14710/nmjn.v11i1.34093,360
182010,Ighlāq al-Masājid Man’an lī intishār Fayrūs Corona Dirāsah Taḥlīlīyah fī Ḍaw’ Maqāṣid al-Sharī`ah,2020,"Background: The long-term benefit of adjuvant dab + tram in pts with resected stage III BRAFV600E/K-mutant melanoma was demonstrated in COMBI-AD where AEs led to permanent discontinuation of dab + tram in 26% of pts, most often due to pyrexia (9%). The COMBIAPlus trial (NCT03551626) is designed to evaluate whether an adapted pyrexia management algorithm could reduce high-grade pyrexia and other pyrexia-related adverse outcomes, such as treatment cessation and hospitalization. Methods: COMBI-APlus is an open-label, Phase IIIb trial evaluating an adapted pyrexia management algorithm in pts with high-risk resected stage III BRAF V600E/K-mutant melanoma treated with 12 mo of adjuvant dab + tram. In the adapted algorithm, both dab and tram were interrupted promptly at the onset of pyrexia (temperature ≥ 38°C). In the event of suspected recurrent pyrexia, treatment may be interrupted in the presence of pyrexia syndrome (ie, chills, rigors, night sweats, or influenza-like symptoms without temperature ≥ 38°C) at investigator discretion. Treatment with dab + tram was restarted at the same dose level once pts were symptom free for ≥ 24 hours. The primary endpoint is the composite rate of grade 3/4 pyrexia, hospitalization due to pyrexia, or permanent discontinuation due to pyrexia vs a historical control from COMBI-AD (20%;95% CI, 16.3%-24.1%). Secondary endpoints include relapse-free survival (RFS) and safety. Results: A total of 552 pts were enrolled. At the data cutoff (5 Oct 2020), all pts had completed 12 mo of treatment;median duration of follow-up was 18.4 mo. COMBI-APlus met its primary endpoint of significant improvement in composite rate of pyrexia. The composite rate was 8.0% (95% CI, 5.9%-10.6%), with rates of 3.8% for grade 3/4 pyrexia, 4.3% for hospitalization due to pyrexia, and 2.4% for discontinuation due to pyrexia. The estimated 12-mo RFS rate was 91.8% (95% CI, 89.0%-93.9%). The most common AEs (≥ 20%) were pyrexia (67.8%), headache (31.7%), blood creatine phosphokinase increase (27.9%), diarrhoea (27.0%), chills (26.4%), fatigue (25.7%), asthenia (23.6%), nausea (23.4%), rash (21.4%), and arthralgia (21.0%). AEs of any type led to permanent dab + tram discontinuation in 14.7% of pts. Conclusions: This primary analysis suggests the new adapted pyrexia management algorithm is effective in reducing grade 3/4 pyrexia, pyrexiarelated hospitalization, and treatment discontinuation in pts receiving adjuvant dab + tram. The early efficacy appears consistent with that observed in COMBI-AD. The growing experience of oncologists in managing pyrexia with this simple algorithm may reduce the need for hospitalization or visits to a healthcare provider, which is highly desirable during the current COVID- 19 pandemic. Thus, more pts can remain on treatment and derive benefit.","Atkinson, V.; Robert, C.; Grob, J. J.; Gogas, H.; Dutriaux, C.; Demidov, L. V.; Gupta, A.; Menzies, A.

The COVID-19 pandemic, has resulted in reduction in ECT services internationally. The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically and rapidly transformed hospitals in heavily affected areas, decreasing mental health services. The need to locate critical patients in spaces intended for anesthesia, where we usually administered ECT, has forced us to decrease the number of procedures and be highly selective. In the same way, continuation and maintenance ECT (m-ECT) have also been dramatically reduced.

182435,The Crisis after the Crisis Resilience or Reset?,2021,"Background: Vaccination is an important tool in the fight against pandemics. However, the associated adverse events (AEs) may negatively impact the public perception of vaccines, therefore leading to decreased vaccination willingness. Interestingly, pharmacovigilance data of the three COVID-19 vaccines with a two-dose schedule approved in the EU (AstraZeneca, BioNTech and Moderna) already revealed country-specific differences in their safety profile early on (as of February 2021), at a time when the accumulated occurrence of specific AEs was not yet known. In the safety outcome assessment presented here, we aimed to establish whether these country-specific differences in pharmacovigilance data could be explained by differences in the frequency of AEs as reported in the respective approval studies of each vaccine. Methods: A systematic search was performed to identify all publications regarding the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of two-dose vaccines approved in the EU (AstraZeneca, BioNTech and Moderna), including regulatory reports and journal articles. All obtained safety data was manually entered into an SQL database. In order to enable the comparability among the data, the solicited AEs for all vaccines (i.e. those AEs actively sought after vaccination) were investigated. The data was standardized to promote comparability and overcome data heterogeneity and complexity. Findings: Twelve documents regarding the RCTs for the three COVID-19 vaccines with a two-dose schedule approved in the EU (AstraZeneca, BioNTech and Moderna) were included in the safety outcome analysis. The entire safety data compiled in the SQL database amounted to 66 different study arms. The data structure revealed 13 different age thresholds or ranges and three different data sets regarding doses (first dose vs. second dose vs. all doses). After standardization and identification of subgroups, the analyses demonstrated that the highest rates of AEs occur after the first dose with the AstraZeneca vaccine, whereas with Moderna and BioNTech most AEs occur after the second dose. Astonishingly, the absolute frequencies of each AE after the first AstraZeneca dose correspond to those of the second dose of the mRNA vaccines (BioNTech and Moderna). Reversely, the absolute frequencies of the same AEs after the second AstraZeneca dose correspond to those of the first dose with the mRNA vaccines. The most common AEs with any vaccine were fatigue, headache and myalgia. Moreover, middle-aged subjects (18 to 55 years) had more side effects than older individuals (> 55 years), an observation that persisted among vaccines. Interpretation: This is the first indirect comparison of these vaccines that uses all available RCT data. The absolute frequency of each AE is similar between the first AstraZeneca dose and the second dose of BioNTech or Moderna; their occurrence was thus independent of platform (vector or mRNA) or the vaccine itself. This assessment demonstrates that the varying frequencies of AEs reported in early pharmacovigilance data for the vaccines in distinct countries, at a time when the accumulated occurrence of specific AEs with certain vaccines was not yet known, cannot be explained by different frequencies being reported in the respective RCTs. Conclusion: The approach presented here could help to objectify future discussions on vaccine preferences. Therefore, it may serve as basis for future public awareness campaigns and may also allow the comparison of vaccine performance in different subgroups (e.g. virus variants, high-risk patients). This approach may also be applied to a broad range of other challenges across the R&D process and various disease categories.","Behrens, C.; Gasperazzo, T.; Samii-Moghadam, M.; Lampe, J.

In this paper, we develop a stylised game-theoretical model to evaluate the impacts of producing and selling masks on supply chain profits, safety index and consumer and social welfare. Firstly, we find that as the infection probability without protection (IPWP) increases, both the retail price and demand for these masks will increase. When the IPWP is sufficiently low, those consumers who want to purchase masks are more likely to purchase N95 masks, but when the IPWP increases, surgical masks are more popular amongst consumers. Secondly, we develop a safety index that indicates the effectiveness of using masks in preventing respiratory disease infection. This index is especially crucial in cases where the IPWP is moderate;in other words, recommending to wear masks is particularly important when the IPWP is moderate. We also examine the impacts of government involvement in handling the outbreak of respiratory diseases. Providing consumer subsidies and promoting the social mask enterprise can effectively combat respiratory diseases under different conditions. Our results can be used for combating COVID-19 and preparing for future health crisess.","Shen, B.; Liu, Y.; Quan, V.; Wen, X.",International Journal of Production Research,https://doi.org/10.1080/00207543.2021.1943036,360

However, traditional observational studies that support this hypothesis could not effectively establish the causal effects. Objective: Utilizing recently published genome-wide associations studies (GWAS) on serum Testosterone level and on COVID-19 related phenotypes, we sought to assess the causality through Mendelian Randomization (MR) analyses. We further applied a suite of statistical genomics methods to further explore the biological mechanisms. Results: We found that testosterone level is significantly associated with Covid-19 critical illness. All six MR methods yielded significant associations. There is no significant association between Testosterone and COVID-19 respiratory failure or COVID-19 susceptibility. Conclusion: Based on the GWAS currently available, we provide support for a causal role of Testosterone on COVID-19 critical illness. Nevertheless, we recognize that the COVID-19 susceptibility GWAS effort is still ongoing and there is no such strong locus as CCR5 for HIV discovered for COVID-19.","Xiong, J.; Ma, Z.; Miao, R.; Huang, J.; Kong, X.-J.; Qu, Y.; Yang, X.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.10.10.21264779v1?rss=1,360

However, if children continue to mix with others outside the home during the closures, these measures are unlikely to be effective. Objectives This review aimed to summarise existing literature on children's activities and contacts made outside the home during unplanned school closures. Methods We searched four databases from inception to February 2020 for relevant literature. Main findings were extracted. Results 3,343 citations were screened and 19 included in the review. Activities and social contacts appeared to decrease during closures but contact was still common. All studies reported children leaving the house or being looked after by non-household members. There was some evidence that older child age and parental disagreement with closure were predictive of children leaving the house, and mixed evidence regarding the relationship between infection status and leaving the home. Parental agreement with closure was generally high, but some parents disagreed due to perceived low risk of infection and practical issues regarding childcare and financial impact. Conclusions Evidence suggests that many children continue to leave the house and mix with others during school closures despite public health recommendations to avoid social contact. This review of behaviour during unplanned school closures could be used to improve infectious disease modelling.","Brooks, Samantha; Smith, Louise; Webster, Rebecca; Weston, Dale; Woodland, Lisa; Hall, Ian; Rubin, James",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.17.20037457,360

Binding assays performed on LM-coated plates showed that 10-15% of NK cells spontaneously adhere to LM, and this adhesion is mediated by VLA-6. Activation of NK cells through CD16 triggering or by phorbol ester results in a rapid increase of adhesion to LM, which is still mediated by VLA-6. The enhanced adhesiveness is not associated with changes in beta 1 LM receptor expression, while it correlates with changes in the phosphorylation status of alpha 6 subunit. The expression of VLA-6 on NK cells and the modulation of its avidity by activating stimuli may be relevant for NK cell migration and tissue location during inflammation or immune response.",,J Exp Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2119439/,360

Both IgM and IgG1 share the same idiotype and use the same VDJ rearrangement. Here, a detailed Southern blot analysis of the entire constant region of the Ig heavy chain (Ig CH) locus of parental (BCL1.B1) and variants (BCL1.B2) DNA showed no detectable rearrangement. Similar analysis of the JH-C mu region led to the conclusion that two heavy chain alleles present in the IgM/IgG1-producing variants carried the same VDJ rearrangement but differed in their 3' flanking regions. One chromosome 12 did not carry any Ig CH genes, whereas, the other chromosome 12 carried one copy of CH genes. In BCL1.B1, however, each of the chromosome 12 alleles carried a full copy of CH genes. Karyotypic analysis confirmed the presence of two translocated t(12;16) chromosomes in both BCL1.2.58 and BCL1.B1 cells, with a break 5' to the VH locus at the distal region (12F2) of chromosome 12, and at the proximal region below the centromere (16B3) of chromosome 16. We conclude that double production of IgM and IgG1 in BCL1.B2 is accomplished by transcription of the corresponding CH genes in germline configuration using a single VDJ on the same chromosome 12.",,J Exp Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2188233/,360
187314,[Adaptation of elderly Petersburgers to the situation of the coronavirus pandemic.],2020,"Membrane fusion of the alphaviruses is mediated by the E1 protein, a class II virus membrane fusion protein. During fusion, E1 dissociates from its heterodimer interaction with the E2 protein and forms a target membrane-inserted E1 homotrimer. The structure of the homotrimer is that of a trimeric hairpin in which E1 domain III and the stem region fold back toward the target membrane-inserted fusion peptide loop. The E1 stem region has a strictly conserved length and several highly conserved residues, suggesting the possibility of specific stem interactions along the trimer core and an important role in driving membrane fusion. Mutagenesis studies of the alphavirus Semliki Forest virus (SFV) here demonstrated that there was a strong requirement for the E1 stem in virus assembly and budding, probably reflecting its importance in lateral interactions of the envelope proteins. Surprisingly, however, neither the conserved length nor any specific residues of the stem were required for membrane fusion. Although the highest fusion activity was observed with wild-type E1, efficient fusion was mediated by stem mutants containing a variety of substitutions or deletions. A minimal stem length was required but could be conferred by a series of alanine residues. The lack of a specific stem sequence requirement during SFV fusion suggests that the interaction of domain III with the trimer core can provide sufficient driving force to mediate membrane merger.","Liao, Maofu; Kielian, Margaret",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16971447/,360
188088,A dynamic risk-based approach to managing a pandemic.,2021-01-01,"INTRODUCTION In this prospective, observational study, we have evaluated right (RV) and left (LV) ventricular function with echocardiography and correlated it to the levels of biomarkers, hs-TNT, NT-pro-BNP, D-dimer and fibrinogen. In a subgroup, we have evaluated the effect of inhaled milrinone on RV afterload and function. METHODS Thirty-one ICU patients with COVID-19 in need of mechanical ventilation and norepinephrine infusion were prospectively included. Hemodynamic and respiratory variables were measured at the time of the echocardiographic examination and biomarkers were obtained on arrival at the ICU and then followed up routinely. Eight patients received inhaled aerosolized milrinone at a dose of 2.5 mg/hour. RESULTS The most common echocardiographic pattern was RV dilation with or without systolic dysfunction, which was found in 62% of patients. Pulmonary acceleration time was abnormal in 55% and indices of RV systolic function, such as fractional area of change, RV strain, were abnormal in 30% and 31% of patients respectively. A cardiac index of < 2.5 l/min*m2 was seen in 58% of the patients. Left ventricular ejection fraction and global left ventricular strain were impaired in 10% and 16% respectively. The correlation between echocardiographic variables and cardiac biomarkers was poor. RV afterload correlated well to the levels of D-dimer. Milrinone inhalation did not improve RV function or afterload. CONCLUSION RV dysfunction was the most common finding. The poor correlation to cardiac biomarkers argues against extensive myocardial involvement. The lack of improvement in RV function after milrinone inhalation suggests that the most likely cause of RV dysfunction is increased RV afterload caused by pulmonary thrombosis/embolism.","Norden, Nina; Lundin, Erik O; Hagberg, Eva; Gao, Sinsia A; Hård Af Segerstad, Mathias; Nellgård, Bengt; Dalla, Keti",American journal of cardiovascular disease,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34084661/,360
192595,Global informing. Impact and implications of technology in a global marketplace.,2004,"UNLABELLED Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a newly emerging, highly transmissible and fatal disease caused by a previously unknown coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Existing in non-identified animal reservoirs, SARS-CoV continues to represent a threat to humans because there is no effective specific antiviral therapy for coronavirus infections. OBJECTIVES Starting from the observation that cyclopentenone cyclooxygenase (COX) metabolites are active against several RNA viruses, we investigated the effect of the COX inhibitor indomethacin on coronavirus replication. METHODS Work involving infectious SARS-CoV was performed in biosafety level 3 facilities. SARS-CoV was grown in monkey VERO cells and human lung epithelial A549 cells, while canine coronavirus (CCoV) was grown in A72 canine cells. Antiviral activity was analysed by determining infective virus titres by TCID50, viral RNA synthesis by Northern blot analysis and real-time RT-PCR, and viral protein synthesis by SDS-PAGE analysis after 35S-methionine-labelling. Antiviral efficacy in vivo was determined by evaluating virus titres in CCoV-infected dogs treated orally with 1 mg/kg body weight indomethacin (INDO). RESULTS Unexpectedly, we found that INDO has a potent direct antiviral activity against the coronaviruses SARS-CoV and CCoV. INDO does not affect coronavirus binding or entry into host cells, but acts by blocking viral RNA synthesis at cytoprotective doses. This effect is independent of cyclooxygenase inhibition. INDO's potent antiviral activity (>1,000-fold reduction in virus yield) was confirmed in vivo in CCoV-infected dogs. CONCLUSIONS The results identify INDO as a potent inhibitor of coronavirus replication and suggest that, having both anti-inflammatory and antiviral activity, INDO could be beneficial in SARS therapy.","Amici, Carla; Di Caro, Antonino; Ciucci, Alessandra; Chiappa, Lucia; Castilletti, Concetta; Martella, Vito; Decaro, Nicola; Buonavoglia, Canio; Capobianchi, Maria R; Santoro, M Gabriella",Antiviral therapy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17302372/,360

Given the multiple dimensions of pain--whether acute or chronic, mild, moderate, or severe, nociceptive or neuropathic--a multimodal approach may be needed. Fortunately, clinicians have an array of nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic treatment choices; however, each modality must be chosen carefully, because some often used oral agents are associated with safety and tolerability issues that restrict their use in certain patients. In particular, orally administered nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, opioids, antidepressants, and anticonvulsants are known to cause systemic adverse effects in some patients. To address this problem, a number of topical therapies in various therapeutic classes have been developed to reduce systemic exposure and minimize the risks of patients developing adverse events. For example, topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug formulations produce a site-specific effect (ie, cyclo-oxygenase inhibition) while decreasing the systemic exposure that may lead to undesired effects in patients. Similarly, derivatives of acetylsalicylic acid (ie, salicylates) are used in topical analgesic formulations that do not significantly enter the patient's systemic circulation. Salicylates, along with capsaicin, menthol, and camphor, compose the counterirritant class of topical analgesics, which produce analgesia by activating and then desensitizing epidermal nociceptors. Additionally, patches and creams that contain the local anesthetic lidocaine, alone or co-formulated with other local anesthetics, are also used to manage patients with select acute and chronic pain states. Perhaps the most common topical analgesic modality is the cautious application of cutaneous cold and heat. Such treatments may decrease pain not by reaching the target tissue through systemic distribution, but by acting more directly on the affected tissue. Despite the tolerability benefits associated with avoiding systemic circulation, topically applied analgesics are associated with application-site reactions in patients, such as dryness, erythema, burning, and discoloration. Furthermore, some adverse events that have been observed in patients may be suggestive of some degree of systemic exposure. This article reviews the mechanisms of action, pharmacokinetics, and tolerability of topical treatments for the management of patient pain.","Barkin, Robert L",Postgraduate medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24547599/,360
195996,Critical Thinking During a Pandemic.,2020-07-01,"OBJECTIVE To compile the lessons learned in the Greater Maghreb, during the first six months of the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, in the field of ""capacity building"" of community resilience. METHODS An expert consultation was conducted during the first week of May 2020, using the ""Delphi"" technique. An email was sent requesting the formulation of a lesson, in the form of a ""Public Health"" good practice recommendation. The final text of the lessons was finalized by the group coordinator and validated by the signatories of the manuscript. RESULTS A list of five lessons of resilience has been deduced and approved : 1. Elaboration of ""white plans"" for epidemic management; 2. Training in epidemic management; 3. Uniqueness of the health system command; 4. Mobilization of retirees and volunteers; 5. Revision of the map sanitary. CONCLUSION Based on the evaluation of the performance of the Maghreb fight against COVID-19, characterized by low resilience, this list of lessons could constitute a roadmap for the reform of Maghreb health systems, towards more performance to manage possible waves of COVID-19 or new emerging diseases with epidemic tendency.","Ben Abdelaziz, Ahmed; Berkane, Salah; Ben Salem, Kamel; Dahdi, Sid Ahmed; Mlouki, Imen; Benzarti, Sofien; Nouira, Sarra; Azzaza, Mohamed; Azouaou, Monia; Bouamra, Abderrazek; Achouri, Mohamed Yacine; Soulimane, A",La Tunisie medicale,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33479936/,360

The clinical course lasted 24 hours and consisted of progressively deteriorating consciousness and hyperventilation, usually leading to death. Mice killed and necropsied while stuporous or comatose had serum ammonia levels of 2524 +/- 179 versus 66 +/- 8 micrograms/dl for control BALB/cByJ mice. Necropsy findings included swollen, diffusely pale yellow livers with panlobular microvesicular fatty change, pale renal cortices with epithelial fat droplets of the proximal convoluted tubules, and Alzheimer type II astrocytosis of the neocortex, corpus striatum, hippocampus, and thalamus. In three of the five outbreaks involving 66% of affected animals, mice had active coronaviral enteritis. Electron microscopic changes in hepatocytes, neocortical astrocytes, and neurons were similar to or identical with those described for the acute phase of Reye's syndrome in man. The epizootiology of these outbreaks and the apparent synchrony between Reye's syndrome-like illness and the stage of intestinal coronavirus infections in some of these outbreaks suggest that one or more naturally occurring murine viruses were of etiologic significance.","Brownstein, D G; Johnson, E A; Smith, A L",Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6482384/,360

METHODS Eight hospitals were selected in six provinces from a national acute respiratory infection surveillance network. Demographic information, clinical history and physical examination, and laboratory testing results of the enrolled hospitalized patients aged less than five years with pneumonia, including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human influenza virus, adenoviruses (ADV), human parainfluenza virus (PIV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), human coronavirus (hCoV)and human bocavirus (hBoV) were analyzed. The viral etiology spectrum of the enrolled patients was analyzed by age-group, year, and seasonality of the detected viral etiologies were described. RESULTS 4 508 hospitalized children less than five years old, with pneumonia from 8 hospitals were included, and 2 688 (59.6%) patients were positive for at least one viral etiology. The most frequent detected virus was RSV (21.3%), followed by PIV (7.1%) and influenza (5.2%), hBoV (3.8%), ADV(3.6%) and hMPV(2.6%). The lowest positive rates in hCoV(1.1%). RSV, influenza, PIV, hBoV and hMPV all showed the nature of seasonality. CONCLUSION RSV was a most common viral etiology in the hospitalized young children less than 5 years of age with pneumonia. Prevention measures should be conducted to decrease its severe impact to the young infants and children in China.","Feng, Luzhao; Lai, Shengjie; Li, Fu; Ye, Xianfei; Li, Sa; Ren, Xiang; Zhang, Honglong; Li, Zhongjie; Yu, Hongjie; Yang, Weizhong",Zhonghua liu xing bing xue za zhi = Zhonghua liuxingbingxue zazhi,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25174464/,360

The amount of healthcare waste in these countries is continuously increasing as a result of the expansion of healthcare systems and services. In the past, healthcare waste, if it was treated at all, was mainly incinerated. In the last decade more comprehensive waste management systems were developed for Southeast Asian countries and implementation started. This also included the establishment of alternative healthcare waste treatment systems. The developments in the lower-middle-income countries are of special interest, as major investments are planned. Based upon sample projects, a short overview of the current development trends in the healthcare waste sector in Laos, Indonesia and Vietnam is provided. The projects presented include: (i) Lao Peoples Democratic Republic (development of the national environmental health training system to support the introduction of environmental health standards and improvement of healthcare waste treatment in seven main hospitals by introducing steam-based treatment technologies); (ii) Indonesia (development of a provincial-level healthcare waste-management strategy for Province Nanggroe Aceh Darussalam (NAD) and introduction of an advanced waste treatment system in a tertiary level hospital in Makassar); and (iii) Vietnam (development of a healthcare waste strategy for five provinces in Vietnam and a World Bank-financed project on healthcare waste in Vietnam).","Kühling, Jan-Gerd; Pieper, Ute","Waste management & research : the journal of the International Solid Wastes and Public Cleansing Association, ISWA",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22993139/,360

These limitations have been doggedly ignored by the WHO, although the authorities in India have now realized that such vertical programs are expensive and not sustainable. Launching of Communication for Behavioral Impact (COMBI) appears to mark a desperate effort to revive their performance. It represents yet another deviation from the mandate given to the WHO. In 1983, the then director general warned against motivational manipulation of people to sell health ideas, but the WHO has now brazenly come forward to look for help from the private sector. COMBI uses the jargon and language of the market place to ""market"" health programs; it calls this ""cause-related marketing."" The WHO has been most a historical in conceptualizing COMBI, as it has not learned from the failure of UNICEF's earlier venture to market child survival by employing experts in social marketing to bring about ""community mobilization."" The WHO should have reviewed the large body of literature on work in the health social sciences, health education, and the many programs based on the concept of ""information, education, and communication.""

In the present study, we evaluated two second-generation, replicase (R) gene-based, real-time RT-PCR test kits--the RealArt HPA coronavirus LC kit (Artus, Hamburg, Germany) and the LightCycler SARS-CoV quantification kit (Roche, Penzberg, Germany)--and a real-time RT-PCR assay for the nucleocapsid (N) gene. Detecting the N-gene RNA might be advantageous due to its high abundance in cells. The kits achieved sensitivities of 70.8% (Artus) and 67.1% (Roche) in 66 specimens from patients with confirmed SARS (samples primarily from the upper and lower respiratory tract and stool). The sensitivity of the N-gene assay was 74.2%. The differences in all of the sensitivities were not statistically significant (P = 0.680 [analysis of variance]). Culture cells initially contained five times more N- than R-gene RNA, but the respective levels converged during 4 days of virus replication. In clinical samples the median concentrations of R- and N-gene RNA, respectively, were 1.2 x 10(6) and 2.8 x 10(6) copies/ml (sputum and endotracheal aspirates), 4.3 x 10(4) and 5.5 x 10(4) copies/ml (stool), and 5.5 x 10(2) and 5.2 x 10(2) copies/sample (throat swabs and saliva). Differences between the samples types were significant but not between the types of target RNA. All (n = 12) samples from the lower respiratory tract tested positive in all tests. In conclusion, the novel assays are more sensitive than the first-generation tests, but they still do not allow a comprehensive ruling out of SARS. Methods for the routine sampling of sputum without infection risk are needed to improve SARS RT-PCR.","Drosten, Christian; Chiu, Lily-Lily; Panning, Marcus; Leong, Hoe Nam; Preiser, Wolfgang; Tam, John S; Günther, Stephan; Kramme, Stefanie; Emmerich, Petra; Ng, Wooi Loon; Schmitz, Herbert; Koay, Evelyn S C",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15131168/,360

The aim was to understand the infertility experience of women who have undergone assisted reproduction technologies. METHODS Qualitative study using Grounded Theory. Through intentional sampling and theoretical sampling, 20 women who had undergone Assisted Reproduction Technologies in public hospitals and specialized private clinics in Spain were selected. Data were collected using semi-structured interviews and were analysed using the principles of Grounded Theory: initial coding and focused coding, memo writing, theoretical sampling and constant comparative method. RESULTS ""Uncovering infertility: unveiling the unknown"" is the core category that explains the process which women go through. Four subcategories emerged and describe the temporal process from seeking pregnancy to reception and coping with the infertility diagnosis: ""Seeking for a vital desire: being mothers/fathers"", ""Suspecting infertility: the absence of the natural"", ""In search of a diagnosis: knowing and understanding the problem"" and ""The impact of diagnosis: a vital grief"". CONCLUSIONS Uncovering infertility is a process that has an impact on the different areas of women's lives. This process produces different emotions and feelings such as guilt, frustration, sadness or anger. This process could be easier if women have the support of their partner, their social environment and if they share their problem with women who have the same situation.","Rujas Bracamonte, Sara; Serrano Gallardo, Pilar; Martínez Marcos, Mercedes",Revista espanola de salud publica,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34643187/,360

This suggests that active or passive immunisation might be an effective option in preventing or treating SARS. Therefore, the development of SARS vaccination strategies belongs to the most important targets of SARS research. The present study analyses data-bases for the current knowledge on vaccination strategies. Both, passive and active immunisation protocols are presently being developed. Passive immunisation with sera from surviving patients leads to partial success. Whereas the passive immunisation exhibits a promising therapeutic tool, only active immunisation can successfully prevent infection. A number of approaches has been used on the basis of inactivated SARS coronaviruses, recombinant subunits, recombinant DNA, and viral vectors. However, all recently developed candidates need to be evaluated critically before clinical use. The so-called ""antibody-dependent enhancement"" can improve viral uptake into host cells resulting in increased viral load and exacerbation of disease.","Pletz, M W; Dickgreber, N; Hagen, L v; Golpon, H; Zabel, P; Bauer, T T; Welte, T; Groneberg, D A",Pneumologie,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17763311/,360

202300,Contact Tracing Enhances the Efficiency of COVID-19 Group Testing,2020-11-28,"Sequential pattern mining (SPM) has been applied in many fields. However, traditional SPM neglects the pattern repetition in sequence. To solve this problem, gap constraint SPM was proposed and can avoid finding too many useless patterns. Nonoverlapping SPM, as a branch of gap constraint SPM, means that any two occurrences cannot use the same sequence letter in the same position as the occurrences. Nonoverlapping SPM can make a balance between efficiency and completeness. The frequent patterns discovered by existing methods normally contain redundant patterns. To reduce redundant patterns and improve the mining performance, this paper adopts the closed pattern mining strategy and proposes a complete algorithm, named Nettree for Nonoverlapping Closed Sequential Pattern (NetNCSP) based on the Nettree structure. NetNCSP is equipped with two key steps, support calculation and closeness determination. A backtracking strategy is employed to calculate the nonoverlapping support of a pattern on the corresponding Nettree, which reduces the time complexity. This paper also proposes three kinds of pruning strategies, inheriting, predicting, and determining. These pruning strategies are able to find the redundant patterns effectively since the strategies can predict the frequency and closeness of the patterns before the generation of the candidate patterns. Experimental results show that NetNCSP is not only more efficient but can also discover more closed patterns with good compressibility. Furtherly, in biological experiments NetNCSP mines the closed patterns in SARS-CoV-2 and SARS viruses. The results show that the two viruses are of similar pattern composition with different combinations.","Wu, Youxi; Zhu, Changrui; Li, Yan; Guo, Lei; Wu, Xindong",Knowl Based Syst,,360
202327,"Earnings Volatility, the Use of Financial Derivatives and Earnings Management: Evidence from an Emerging Market",2021,"Haemostasis stops bleeding at the site of vascular injury and maintains the integrity of blood vessels through clot formation. This regulated physiological process consists of complex interactions between endothelial cells, platelets, von Willebrand factor and coagulation factors. Haemostasis is initiated by a damaged vessel wall, followed with a rapid adhesion, activation and aggregation of platelets to the exposed subendothelial extracellular matrix. At the same time, coagulation factors aggregate on the procoagulant surface of activated platelets to consolidate the platelet plug by forming a mesh of cross-linked fibrin. Platelets and coagulation mutually influence each other and there are strong indications that, thanks to the interplay between platelets and coagulation, haemostasis is far more effective than the two processes separately. Clinically this is relevant because impaired interaction between platelets and coagulation may result in bleeding complications, while excessive platelet-coagulation interaction induces a high thrombotic risk. In this review, platelets, coagulation factors and the complex interaction between them will be discussed in detail.","Sang, Yaqiu; Roest, Mark; de Laat, Bas; de Groot, Philip G; Huskens, Dana",Blood Rev,,360

The aim of this study is reporting a complex case of immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) during pregnancy who has been diagnosed with COVID-19 as well as suspicion of HELLP syndrome. CASE PRESENTATION: A 24-year-old woman with a platelet count of 6000/mL and resistance to conventional therapies was referred. A day after starting 0.5 g/day of methylprednisolone for her, fever and a decrease in SpO2 presented. According to the paraclinical investigations, COVID-19 was diagnosed and the conventional COVID-19 treatments started for her (the methylprednisolone pulse stopped). Due to the increased liver enzymes and low platelet count, with suspicion of HELLP syndrome, cesarean section surgery was performed which resulted in a healthy neonate. Then, the methylprednisolone pulse was restarted for and she developed an increase in the platelet count. CONCLUSION: It is not clear how COVID-19 and pregnancy affected the patient's condition and the underlying disease; however, it seems the delivery and/or restarting the methylprednisolone pulses caused improvement in her condition.","Norooznezhad, Amir Hossein; Nurzadeh, Maryam; Darabi, Mohammad Hasan; Naemi, Mahsa",BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,,360

Despite this, the research lacks spatiotemporal statistical and mathematical analysis based on large datasets. We describe a novel methodology to extract useful spatiotemporal information from COVID-19 pandemic data. (2) Methods: We perform specific analyses based on mathematical and statistical tools, like mathematical morphology, hierarchical clustering, parametric data modeling and non-parametric statistics. These analyses are here applied to the large dataset consisting of about 19,000 COVID-19 patients in the Veneto region (Italy) during the entire Italian national lockdown. (3) Results: We estimate the COVID-19 cumulative incidence spatial distribution, significantly reducing image noise. We identify four clusters of connected provinces based on the temporal evolution of the incidence. Surprisingly, while one cluster consists of three neighboring provinces, another one contains two provinces more than 210 km apart by highway. The survival function of the local spatial incidence values is modeled here by a tapered Pareto model, also used in other applied fields like seismology and economy in connection to networks. Model's parameters could be relevant to describe quantitatively the epidemic.

Telehealth was felt to be most helpful for conditions relying on history, external examination, and previously collected ancillary testing and not helpful for conditions requiring funduscopic examination. CONCLUSIONS: Telehealth modality usage by neuro-ophthalmologists increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. Identified benefits have relevance both during and beyond COVID-19. Further work is needed to address barriers in their current and future states to maintain these modalities as viable care delivery options.","Moss, Heather E; Lai, Kevin E; Ko, Melissa W",J Neuroophthalmol,,360

These measures have been published by the Public Health Authority of the Slovak Republic in the relevant legal regulations and are based on the decisions of the Government of the Slovak Republic, which took into account the opinions of the experts of the Pandemic Commission of the Government of the Slovak Republic. In general, these measures are based on the mask-distance-hand principle. In public areas outside and inside, it was ordered to wear masks and later wear a respirator of FFP2 class in exterior and interior, gloves on hands or disinfection of customers’ hands before entering the store, observance of 2 m distance of people standing in a row at the cash registers, maximum capacity of persons in stores was determined one person per 25 m2 of sales area and later, this measure was tightened to 15 m2 of sales area. Also, to perform regular ventilation of the premises and to have as many cash registers as possible so as not to create long lines of customers. All shops were closed at 8:00 PM. In the case of shopping centers, entry is prohibited for people with a body temperature higher than 37 °C, and disinfection of hands is mandatory, wearing a mask and later wear respirators of FFP2 class is necessary. In a stricter regime, during the peak of the pandemic, there was a restriction for persons to shop food only in the nearest retail/grocery or similar place from the place of residence to the extent necessary to procure the essential needs of life. © 2021 Potravinarstvo Slovak Journal of Food Sciences, License: CC BY 4.0","Zajác, P.; Čurlej, J.; Benešová, L.; Čapla, J.",Potravinarstvo Slovak Journal of Food Sciences,,360
209372,Contestations of the Liberal International Order: From Liberal Multilateralism to Postnational Liberalism,2021,"BACKGROUND: In the four months after the discovery of the index case of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), several studies highlighted the psychological impact of COVID-19 on frontline health care workers and on members of the general public. It is evident from these studies that individuals experienced elevated levels of anxiety and depression in the acute phase, when they first became aware of the pandemic, and that the psychological distress persisted into subsequent weeks. It is becoming apparent that technological tools such as SMS text messages, web-based interventions, mobile interventions, and conversational agents can help ameliorate psychological distress in the workplace and in society. To our knowledge, there are few publications describing how digital tools have been used to ameliorate psychological symptoms among individuals. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this review was to identify existing SMS text message, web-based, mobile, and conversational agents that the general public can access to ameliorate the psychological symptoms they are experiencing during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: To identify digital tools that were published specifically for COVID-19, a search was performed in the PubMed and MEDLINE databases from the inception of the databases through June 17, 2020. The following search strings were used: ""NCOV OR 2019-nCoV OR SARS-CoV-2 OR Coronavirus OR COVID19 OR COVID"" and ""mHealth OR eHealth OR text"". Another search was conducted in PubMed and MEDLINE to identify existing digital tools for depression and anxiety disorders. A web-based search engine (Google) was used to identify if the cited web-based interventions could be accessed. A mobile app search engine, App Annie, was used to determine if the identified mobile apps were commercially available. Results: A total of 6 studies were identified. Of the 6 identified web-based interventions, 5 websites (83%) could be accessed. Of the 32 identified mobile interventions, 7 apps (22%) could be accessed. Of the 7 identified conversational agents, only 2 (29%) could be accessed. RESULTS: A total of 6 studies were identified. Of the 6 identified web-based interventions, 5 websites (83%) could be accessed. Of the 32 identified mobile interventions, 7 apps (22%) could be accessed. Of the 7 identified conversational agents, only 2 (29%) could be accessed. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant psychological distress.

211157,An International Perspective: The Evolution of Financial Services in Canada,2020,"ABSTRACT This article aims to present reflections on cooking skills in times of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. The current period of uncertainty and isolation heightens food insecurity issues, influencing food choice, purchase, and preparation. Social media and networks are sources of entertainment and learning, with vast resources for cooking skills, which can stimulate home cooking and strengthen family ties. Research has evidenced the positive relationship between cooking and diet quality, an important factor for groups at increased risk of severe illness from Covid-19. For some individuals, cooking may be a strategy to reduce anxiety and stress associated with the pandemic. However, the Brazilian reality is marked by inequalities in income and access to food. Thus, more vulnerable populations may not have the same relationship with cooking. Public policies should focus on food and nutrition programs and actions for the development of cooking skills as a means to promote healthy eating and encourage self-care.","UGGIONI, Paula Lazzarin; ELPO, Clarice Mariano Fernandes; GERALDO, Ana Paula Gines; FERNANDES, Ana Carolina; MAZZONETTO, Ana Cláudia; BERNARDO, Greyce Luci",Rev.

211245,Leading in an Unprecedented Global Crisis: The Heightened Importance of Versatility,2020,"Background: Cardiac involvement among hospitalized patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is common and associated with adverse outcomes. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence and clinical implications of SARS-CoV-2 cardiac involvement in young competitive athletes. Methods: In this prospective multicenter observational cohort study with data from 42 colleges/universities, we assessed the prevalence, clinical characteristics, and outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 cardiac involvement among collegiate athletes in the United States. Data were collected from September 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020. The primary outcome was the prevalence of definite, probable, or possible SARS-CoV-2 cardiac involvement based on imaging definitions adapted from the Updated Lake Louise Criteria. Secondary outcomes included the diagnostic yield of cardiac testing, predictors for cardiac involvement, and adverse cardiovascular events or hospitalizations. Results: Among 19,378 athletes tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection, 3018 (mean age 20 years [SD,1 year]; 32% female) tested positive and underwent cardiac evaluation. A total of 2820 athletes underwent at least one element of cardiac 'triad' testing [12-lead electrocardiography (ECG), troponin, and/or transthoracic echocardiography(TTE)] followed by cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) if clinically indicated. In contrast, primary screening CMR was performed in 198 athletes. Abnormal findings suggestive of SARS-CoV-2 cardiac involvement were detected by ECG (21/2999,0.7%), cardiac troponin (24/2719,0.9%), and TTE (24/2556,0.9%). Definite, probable, or possible SARS-COV-2 cardiac involvement was identified in 21/3018 (0.7%) athletes, including 15/2820 (0.5%) who underwent clinically indicated CMR (n=119) and 6/198 (3.0%) who underwent primary screening CMR. Accordingly, the diagnostic yield of CMR for SARS-COV-2 cardiac involvement was 4.2 times higher for a clinically indicated CMR (15/119,12.6%) versus a primary screening CMR (6/198,3.0%). After adjustment for race and sex, predictors of SARS-CoV-2 cardiac involvement included cardiopulmonary symptoms (OR:3.1,95% CI:1.2,7.7) or at least one abnormal triad test (OR:37.4,95% CI:13.3,105.3). Five (0.2%) athletes required hospitalization for non-cardiac complications of SARS-CoV-2. During clinical surveillance (median follow-up 113 days [IQR=90,146]), there was one (0.03%) adverse cardiac event likely unrelated to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 infection among young competitive athletes is associated with a low prevalence of cardiac involvement and a low risk of clinical events in short term follow-up.","Moulson, Nathaniel; Petek, Bradley J; Drezner, Jonathan A; Harmon, Kimberly G; Kliethermes, Stephanie A; Patel, Manesh R; Baggish, Aaron L",Circulation,,360

The tests varied using pure, diluted samples, combined with Proteinase K (PK) or Lysis Buffer. Our findings showed consistently that PK pre-treated samples in the absence of RNA extraction procedures presents similar results to those obtained by standard RNA isolation procedures. On average, 16 samples extracted with the MagMAX&#8482; CORE Kit, take around 2 h, costing an average of USD 5, the pre-treatment of samples using PK, on the other hand, would cut the value to less than USD 0.30 and reduce the time of procedure in more than 1 ½ hours.

While analyzing the overall spread of the disease, clusters of countries could be identified where the population-adjusted number of cases and mortality rates (MRs) were significantly different from the others. To draw a comparison over the countries at the same stage of infection, the nature and spread of the infection was evaluated at the 90th day of the pandemic for each country. It was observed that the countries with prevalent malarial transmission tended to have lesser population-adjusted COVID-19 caseloads. It was further observed that high population coverage of the Bacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccination was negatively associated with population-adjusted caseloads and MRs due to COVID-19. The present cross-sectional study is an attempt to bring in several social, economic, and structural confounders into understanding of the nature and spread of this novel pandemic globally.","Goswami, Rudra Prosad; Ganguli, Bhaswati; Chatterjee, Moumita",J Med Virol,,360

Glaucoma is a common neurodegenerative disease in which neuronal levels of NAD decline. We assess the effects of nicotinamide (a precursor to NAD) on retinal ganglion cells (the affected neuron in glaucoma) in normal physiological conditions and across a range of glaucoma relevant insults including mitochondrial stress and axon degenerative insults. We demonstrate retinal ganglion cell somal, axonal, and dendritic neuroprotection by nicotinamide in rodent models which represent isolated ocular hypertensive, axon degenerative, and mitochondrial degenerative insults. We performed metabolomics enriched for small molecular weight metabolites for the retina, optic nerve, and superior colliculus which demonstrates that ocular hypertension induces widespread metabolic disruption, including consistent changes to &#945;-ketoglutaric acid, creatine/creatinine, homocysteine, and glycerophosphocholine. This metabolic disruption is prevented by nicotinamide. Nicotinamide provides further neuroprotective effects by increasing oxidative phosphorylation, buffering and preventing metabolic stress, and increasing mitochondrial size and motility whilst simultaneously dampening action potential firing frequency. These data support continued determination of the utility of long-term nicotinamide treatment as a neuroprotective therapy for human glaucoma.","Tribble, James R; Otmani, Amin; Sun, Shanshan; Ellis, Sevannah A; Cimaglia, Gloria; Vohra, Rupali; Jöe, Melissa; Lardner, Emma; Venkataraman, Abinaya P; Domínguez-Vicent, Alberto; Kokkali, Eirini; Rho, Seungsoo; Jóhannesson, Gauti; Burgess, Robert W; Fuerst, Peter G; Brautaset, Rune; Kolko, Miriam; Morgan, James E; Crowston, Jonathan G; Votruba, Marcela; Williams, Pete A",Redox Biol,,360

METHODS: Public data from the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) were used to estimate age- and sex-specific CFRs for COVID-19 in South Korea up to June 12, 2020. We applied statistical methods previously developed to adjust for the delay between diagnosis and death, and presented both delay-adjusted and crude (unadjusted) CFRs throughout the epidemic. RESULTS: The overall estimated delay-adjusted CFR was 2.39% (3.05% for males and 1.92% for females). Within each age strata where deaths were reported, males were found to have significantly higher CFRs than females. The estimated CFRs increased substantially from age 60 years in males and from 70 years in females. Both the delay-adjusted and crude CFRs were found to have evolved substantially, particularly early in the epidemic, converging only from mid-April 2020. CONCLUSIONS: The CFRs for South Korea provide an estimate of mortality risk in a setting where case ascertainment is likely to be more complete. The evolution in CFRs throughout the epidemic highlights the need for caution when interpreting CFRs calculated at a given time point.","Newall, A T; Leong, R N F; Nazareno, A; Muscatello, D J; Wood, J G; Kim, W J",Int J Infect Dis,,360

COVID-19 puts into stark relief our mutual obligations that reflect our interdependence as participants in a common society. Drawing on the work of Amartya Sen concerning famine and related challenges, I discuss the accompanying implications for social justice. Social justice in catastrophe requires strong social insurance structures and legal protections for the most vulnerable people, who would otherwise lack economic resources and political influence to protect their essential interests. Social justice also requires greater and more-sustained attention to disaster preparedness and public health infrastructure-both of which are characteristically neglected, in part because the public health enterprise is identified with politically weak and often stigmatized populations.","Pollack, Harold A",J. health polit. policy law,,360
214822,Study of the trend pattern of COVID-19 using spline-based time series model: a Bayesian paradigm,2021,"Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) mainly infects the intestinal epithelial cells of newborn piglets causing acute, severe atrophic enteritis. The underlying mechanisms of PEDV infection and the reasons why newborn piglets are more susceptible than older pigs remain incompletely understood. Iron deficiency is common in newborn piglets. Here we found that high levels of transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) distributed in the apical tissue of the intestinal villi of newborns, and intracellular iron levels influence the susceptibility of newborn piglets to PEDV. We show that iron deficiency induced by deferoxamine (DFO, an iron chelating agent) promotes PEDV infection while iron accumulation induced by ferric ammonium citrate (FAC, an iron supplement) impairs PEDV infection in vitro and in vivo. Besides, PEDV infection was inhibited by occluding TfR1 with antibodies or decreasing TfR1 expression. Additionally, PEDV infection was increased in PEDV-resistant Caco-2 and HEK 293T cells over-expressed porcine TfR1. Mechanistically, the PEDV S1 protein interacts with the extracellular region of TfR1 during PEDV entry, promotes TfR1 re-localization and clustering, then activates TfR1 tyrosine phosphorylation mediated by Src kinase, and heightens the internalization of TfR1, thereby promoting PEDV entry. Taken together, these data suggest that the higher expression of TfR1 in the apical tissue of the intestinal villi caused by iron deficiency, accounts for newborn piglets being acutely susceptible to PEDV.","Zhang, Shuai; Cao, Yanan; Yang, Qian",PLoS Pathog,,360

BACKGROUND: The emergence of COVID-19 has significantly impacted the psychological and mental well-being of frontline health care workers, including nurses. To date, no studies have been conducted examining how this fear of COVID-19 contributes to health, well-being and work outcomes in frontline nurses. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional research design involving 261 frontline nurses in the Philippines. Five standardized scales were used for data collection. RESULTS: Overall, the composite score of the fear of COVID-19 scale was 19.92. Job role and attendance of COVID-19-related training predicted fear of COVID-19. An increased level of fear of COVID-19 was associated with decreased job satisfaction, increased psychological distress and increased organisational and professional turnover intentions. CONCLUSIONS: Frontline nurses who reported not having attended COVID-19-related training and those who held part-time job roles reported increased fears of COVID-19. Addressing the fear of COVID-19 may result in improved job outcomes in frontline nurses, such as increased job satisfaction, decreased stress levels and lower intent to leave the organisation and the profession. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: Organisational measures are vital to support the mental health of nurses and address their fear of COVID-19 through peer and social support, psychological and mental support services (e.g. counselling or psychotherapy), provision of training related to COVID-19 and accurate and regular information updates.","Labrague, Leodoro J; de Los Santos, Janet Alexis A",J. nurs. manag,,360

To decipher any correlation between SARS-CoV-2 evolution and its epidemiology in India, we studied the mutational diversity of spike glycoprotein, the key player for the attachment, fusion and entry of virus to the host cell. For this, we analyzed the sequences of 630 Indian isolates as available in GISAID database till June 07, 2020 (during the time-period before the start of Unlock 1.0 in India on and from June 08, 2020), and detected the spike protein variants to emerge from two major ancestors - Wuhan-Hu-1/2019 and its D614G variant. Average stability of the docked spike protein - host receptor (S-R) complexes for these variants correlated strongly (R2 = 0.96) with the fatality rates across Indian states. However, while more than half of the variants were found unique to India, 67% of all variants showed lower stability of S-R complex than the respective ancestral variants, indicating a possible fitness loss in recently emerged variants, despite a continuous increase in mutation rate. These results conform to the sharply declining fatality rate countrywide (>7-fold during April 11 - June 28, 2020). Altogether, while we propose the potential of S-R complex stability to track disease severity, we urge an immediate need to explore if SARS-CoV-2 is approaching mutational meltdown in India.","Banerjee, Rachana; Basak, Kausik; Ghosh, Anamika; Rajachandran, Vyshakh; Sureka, Kamakshi; Ganguly, Debabani; Chattopadhyay, Sujay",Infect Genet Evol,,360

Based on our qualitative analysis, we find that the effectiveness of local approaches appears to depend on: (i) cross-sector collaboration, (ii) supply chains, and (iii) addressing gaps in service to increased risk populations.","Jablonski, Becca B R; Casnovsky, Joy; Clark, Jill K; Cleary, Rebecca; Feingold, Beth; Freedman, Darcy; Gray, Steven; Romeiko, Xiaobo; Olabisi, Laura Schmitt; Torres, Mariana; van den Berg, Alexandra E; Walsh, Colleen; Wentworth, Chelsea",Appl Econ Perspect Policy,,360
217962,Cross-Validation Comparison of COVID-19 Forecast Models,2021,"BACKGROUND: The dynamics of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 are complicated by age-dependent factors, changing levels of infection, and the relaxation of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) as the perceived risk declines, necessitating the use of mathematical models. Our aims were to use epidemiological data from the UK together with estimates of vaccine efficacy to predict the possible long-term dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 under the planned vaccine rollout. METHODS: In this study, we used a mathematical model structured by age and UK region, fitted to a range of epidemiological data in the UK, which incorporated the planned rollout of a two-dose vaccination programme (doses 12 weeks apart, protection onset 14 days after vaccination). We assumed default vaccine uptake of 95% in those aged 80 years and older, 85% in those aged 50-79 years, and 75% in those aged 18-49 years, and then varied uptake optimistically and pessimistically. Vaccine efficacy against symptomatic disease was assumed to be 88% on the basis of Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines being administered in the UK, and protection against infection was varied from 0% to 85%. We considered the combined interaction of the UK vaccination programme with multiple potential future relaxations (or removals) of NPIs, to predict the reproduction number (R) and pattern of daily deaths and hospital admissions due to COVID-19 from January, 2021, to January, 2024. FINDINGS: We estimate that vaccination alone is insufficient to contain the outbreak. In the absence of NPIs, even with our most optimistic assumption that the vaccine will prevent 85% of infections, we estimate R to be 1·58 (95% credible intervals [CI] 1·36-1·84) once all eligible adults have been offered both doses of the vaccine. Under the default uptake scenario, removal of all NPIs once the vaccination programme is complete is predicted to lead to 21 400 deaths (95% CI 1400-55 100) due to COVID-19 for a vaccine that prevents 85% of infections, although this number increases to 96 700 deaths (51 800-173 200) if the vaccine only prevents 60% of infections. Although vaccination substantially reduces total deaths, it only provides partial protection for the individual; we estimate that, for the default uptake scenario and 60% protection against infection, 48·3% (95% CI 48·1-48·5) and 16·0% (15·7-16·3) of deaths will be in individuals who have received one or two doses of the vaccine, respectively. INTERPRETATION: For all vaccination scenarios we investigated, our predictions highlight the risks associated with early or rapid relaxation of NPIs. Although novel vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 offer a potential exit strategy for the pandemic, success is highly contingent on the precise vaccine properties and population uptake, both of which need to be carefully monitored.

218585,A comprehensive evaluation of early potential risk factors for disease aggravation in patients with COVID-19,2021,"Telemedicine, defined as practicing medicine at a distance, has grown in popularity over the past ten years, as advances in consumer technology have permitted its expansion. Dermatology is a field that especially lends itself to this method of care, as many common dermatological diagnoses can be made upon visual inspection. With social distancing becoming the new standard in this age of COVID-19, telemedicine emerges as a key tool in continuing patient care without interruption. In this pilot study, we examine the reliability of acne vulgaris diagnostic assessments made via patient-taken photos compared to in-office assessments in patients between the ages of 16 and 23 with mild to moderate acne. Fourteen patient encounters were clinically examined for three outcomes: inflammatory lesions, noninflammatory acne lesions, and facial nodules. On the same day patient outcomes were counted and recorded in-person, patients were instructed to photograph their faces. These images were reviewed 8&ndash;12 weeks later by investigators for the same assessment. Initial findings suggest strong concordance between in-person and digital diagnosis, with a Spearman&rsquo;s correlation coefficient of 0.96 across all lesion and nodule scores. These data support further research on the expansion and implementation of telemedicine for dermatology.

Therefore, infection control measures are necessary to prevent infection of dental personnel during dental treatments. The use of a preprocedural mouth rinse with chlorhexidine (CHX), cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC), or hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) solution for 30-60 s may reduce the viral load and may protect the personnel in a dental practice. In the present study the virucidal effect of the mouth rinsing solutions ViruProX® with 0.05% CPC and 1.5% H2O2 and BacterX® pro containing 0.1% CHX, 0.05% CPC, and 0.005% sodium fluoride (F-) was investigated in vitro. The mouth rinsing solutions successfully inactivated infectious SARS-CoV-2 particles, the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), within 30 s. To determine the effective components, CHX, CPC, H2O2, and a combination of CHX and CPC, were tested against SARS-CoV-2 in addition. While a combination of CPC and CHX as well as CPC alone led to a significant reduction of infectious viral particles, H2O2 and CHX alone had no virucidal effect against SARS-CoV-2. It can be assumed that preprocedural rinsing of the mouth with ViruProX® or BacterX® pro will reduce the viral load in the oral cavity and could thus lower the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in dental practice.","Koch-Heier, Julia; Hoffmann, Helen; Schindler, Michael; Lussi, Adrian; Planz, Oliver",,,360

This study investigated vaccine awareness and opinions on the anti-vaccination movement among students at three faculties of Eastern Mediterranean University. Data were collected by questionnaire. Exposure to anti-vaccination propaganda increased proportionally with the size of the cities where participants were born. In total, 88.6% of the participants declared that they planned to vaccinate their children, while those who did not cited various reasons including the belief that vaccines do not work, that vaccines are harmful, and that it is better to be infected naturally. 60.6% of participants reported that they would get vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 if there was an effective vaccine. Meanwhile, 24.5% of participants were not sure whether would get vaccinated even if it were possible, 11.4% of participants stated that they would not vaccinate their children for a variety of reasons. These results are important, especially in the context of a pandemic, because students will become leaders in education, business, and media, and thus shape the thoughts and opinions of future generations. The anti-vaccination movement is building momentum, and is especially influential in big cities; therefore, it is vital to change our approach to informing students about vaccination.","Guzoglu, Nilufer; Daneshvar, Zahra; Hamrang, Elmira; Kayisbudak, Ilayda Deniz; Khasawneh, Hayel; Mahmoud, Omar Yasser; Sani, Abeer Mohammad; Sokmen, Gorkem",Hum Vaccin Immunother,,360

219290,The Effects of Stringent Interventions for Coronavirus Pandemic,2020-05-31,"After the first case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Japan on 15 January 2020, multiple nationwide COVID-19 clusters were identified by the end of February. The Japanese government focused on mitigating the emerging COVID-19 clusters by conducting active nationwide epidemiological surveillance. However, an increasing number of cases continued to appear until early April 2020, many with unclear infection routes and no recent history of travel outside Japan. We aimed to evaluate the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) genome sequences from the COVID-19 cases that appeared until early April 2020 and to characterize their genealogical networks in order to demonstrate possible routes of spread in Japan. Nasopharyngeal specimens were collected from patients, and reverse transcription-quantitative PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 were performed. Positive RNA samples were subjected to whole-genome sequencing, and a haplotype network analysis was performed. Some of the primary clusters identified during January and February 2020 in Japan descended directly from the Wuhan-Hu-1-related isolates from China and other distinct clusters. Clusters were almost contained until mid-March; the haplotype network analysis demonstrated that the COVID-19 cases from late March through early April may have created an additional large cluster related to the outbreak in Europe, leading to additional spread within Japan. In conclusion, genome surveillance has suggested that there were at least two distinct SARS-CoV-2 introductions into Japan from China and other countries.IMPORTANCE This study aimed to evaluate the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) genome sequences from COVID-19 cases and to characterize their genealogical networks to demonstrate possible routes of spread in Japan. We found that there were at least two distinct SARS-CoV-2 introductions into Japan, initially from China and subsequently from other countries, including Europe. Our findings can help understand how SARS-CoV-2 entered Japan and contribute to increased knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 in Asia and its association with implemented stay-at-home/shelter-in-place/self-restraint/lockdown measures. This study suggested that it is necessary to formulate a more efficient containment strategy using real-time genome surveillance to support epidemiological field investigations in order to highlight potential infection linkages and mitigate the next wave of COVID-19 in Japan.","Sekizuka, Tsuyoshi; Itokawa, Kentaro; Hashino, Masanori; Kawano-Sugaya, Tetsuro; Tanaka, Rina; Yatsu, Koji; Ohnishi, Asami; Goto, Keiko; Tsukagoshi, Hiroyuki; Ehara, Hayato; Sadamasu, Kenji; Taira, Masakatsu; Shibata, Shinichiro; Nomoto, Ryohei; Hiroi, Satoshi; Toho, Miho; Shimada, Tomoe; Matsui, Tamano; Sunagawa, Tomimasa; Kamiya, Hajime; Yahata, Yuichiro; Yamagishi, Takuya; Suzuki, Motoi; Wakita, Takaji; Kuroda, Makoto",MSphere,,360

The core polymerase enzyme in the viral replication/transcription machinery is generally conserved and serves well for drug target. In this work we briefly review structural biology and computational clues on representative single-subunit viral polymerases that are more or less connected with SARS-CoV-2 RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), in particular, to elucidate how nucleotide substrates and potential drug analogs are selected in the viral genome synthesis. To do that, we first survey two well studied RdRps from Polio virus and hepatitis C virus in regard to structural motifs and key residues that have been identified for the nucleotide selectivity. Then we focus on related structural and biochemical characteristics discovered for the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. To further compare, we summarize what we have learned computationally from phage T7 RNA polymerase (RNAP) on its stepwise nucleotide selectivity, and extend discussion to a structurally similar human mitochondria RNAP, which deserves special attention as it cannot be adversely affected by antiviral treatments. We also include viral phi29 DNA polymerase for comparison, which has both helicase and proofreading activities on top of nucleotide selectivity for replication fidelity control. The helicase and proofreading functions are achieved by protein components in addition to RdRp in the coronavirus replication-transcription machine, with the proofreading strategy important for the fidelity control in synthesizing a comparatively large viral genome.","Long, Chunhong; Romero, Moises Ernesto; La Rocco, Daniel; Yu, Jin",,,360

Our main contribution is to quantify this gap by calibrating the model with unique survey data from Germany on social distancing and impure altruism from the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. The optimal policy is to drastically reduce contacts at the beginning to almost eradicate the epidemic and keep them at levels that contain the pandemic at a low prevalence level. We find that also in laissez faire, private protection efforts by forward-looking, risk averse individuals would have stabilized the epidemic, but at a much higher prevalence of infection than optimal. Altruistic motives increase individual protection efforts, but a substantial gap to the social optimum remains.","Quaas, Martin F; Meya, Jasper N; Schenk, Hanna; Bos, Björn; Drupp, Moritz A; Requate, Till",PLoS One,,360

This report aimed to assess the relationship between tobacco product-specific risk perceptions for COVID-19 and changes in tobacco use since the start of the pandemic. METHODS: A sample (n=776) of past-30 day exclusive smokers (n=238), exclusive e-cigarette users (n=143), and dual users (n=395) residing in the US and aged 18 or older was collected using Mechanical Turk from April 27 to June 8, 2020. Adjusted associations between tobacco product-specific COVID-19 risk perceptions (i.e. risk that smokers/vapers are at for COVID-19 relative to non-smokers/non-vapers) and changes in tobacco use since the pandemic began were assessed using partial proportional odds models. RESULTS: A majority of those who used cigarettes (63.7%) and e-cigarettes (56.1%) felt that the risk of COVID-19 was greater for users of their tobacco product than for non-users. Twenty-four percent of smokers had increased their cigarette use since the start of the pandemic and 28.0% had decreased. Similarly, 27.3% of e-cigarette users had increased their e-cigarette use since the start of the pandemic and 23.8% had decreased. Higher risk perceptions for COVID-19 were associated with reductions in tobacco use since the pandemic began for exclusive e-cigarette users and dual users. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide support that tobacco product-specific COVID-19 risk perceptions may be an important correlate of changes in tobacco use during the pandemic. Targeted information to inform tobacco users regarding their risks for COVID-19 is needed during this public health crisis.","White, Augustus M; Li, Dongmei; Snell, L Morgan; O039,; Connor, Richard; Hoetger, Cosima; Croft, Daniel; Lester, Rebecca C; McIntosh, Scott; Underwood, Megan; Schneller, Liane; Breland, Alison; Barnes, Andrew J; Cobb, Caroline O; Ossip, Deborah J",Nicotine tob. res,,360

The Chinese government has encouraged people to wear face masks in public places;however, due to the large population, there may be a series of problems related to this recommendation, including shortages of masks and lack of an optimal disposal method for used masks. Objective: The purpose of this study is to understand the current status of mask shortages and used masks in China. Methods: A questionnaire survey was designed to assess the current status of mask shortages and used masks. The differences among groups were analyzed with chi-square tests. Results: The constituent ratio of those who reuse masks was 61%. Obtaining masks from the drugstore was reported to be very difficult due to high demand and short supply, and approximately 1/3 of the respondents purchased expensive masks. Most people know how to properly handle used masks, and only 7% of them casually discard masks. However, 50% of respondents have seen others throw away used masks at will. A further subgroup analysis showed that respondents in Central China tended to use masks repeatedly, as did medical personnel. Females, people living in the central region, and medical personnel may find it more difficult to purchase masks in drugstores. Non-medical personnel may be more likely to buy expensive masks. Females, people living in the western region, and medical personnel may be more likely to know how to properly handle used masks and not to discard used masks at will. Medical personnel may be more likely to observe others discarding used masks at will. Conclusion: In response to COVID-19, the public should be encouraged to use face masks and are advised not to reuse or throw away masks at will due to safety concerns.","Chen, J.; Cheng, Y.

224090,In the Face of a Pandemic,2020,"The growing adoption of decentralised renewable energy generation (such as solar photovoltaic panels and wind turbines) and low-carbon technologies will increase the strain experienced by the distribution networks in the near future. In such a scenario, energy storage is becoming a key alternative to traditional expensive reinforcements to network infrastructure, due to its flexibility, decreasing costs and fast deployment capabilities. In this work, an end-to-end data-driven solution to optimally design the control of a battery unit with the aim of reducing the peak electricity demand is presented. The proposed solution uses state-of-the-art machine learning methods for forecasting electricity demand and PV generation, combined with an optimisation strategy to maximise the use of photovoltaic energy to charge the energy storage unit. To this end, historical demand, weather, and solar energy generation data collected at the Stentaway Primary substation near Plymouth, UK, and at other six locations were employed.","Borghini, Eugenio Giannetti Cinzia Flynn James Todeschini Grazia",Energies,,360
224590,Characteristics and Role of the Malaysia Commercial Real Estate Market,2020,"Mid Regional pro-ADM (MR-proADM) is a promising novel biomarker in the evaluation of deteriorating patients and an emergent prognosis factor in patients with sepsis, septic shock and organ failure. It can be induced by bacteria, fungi or viruses. We hypothesized that the assessment of MR-proADM, with or without other inflammatory cytokines, as part of a clinical assessment of COVID-19 patients at hospital admission, may assist in identifying those likely to develop severe disease. A pragmatic retrospective analysis was performed on a complete data set from 111 patients admitted to Udine University Hospital, in northern Italy, from 25th March to 15th May 2020, affected by SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Clinical scoring systems (SOFA score, WHO disease severity class, SIMEU clinical phenotype), cytokines (IL-6, IL-1b, IL-8, TNF-&#945;), and MR-proADM were measured. Demographic, clinical and outcome data were collected for analysis. At multivariate analysis, high MR-proADM levels were significantly associated with negative outcome (death or orotracheal intubation, IOT), with an odds ratio of 4.284 [1.893-11.413], together with increased neutrophil count (OR = 1.029 [1.011-1.049]) and WHO disease severity class (OR = 7.632 [5.871-19.496]). AUROC analysis showed a good discriminative performance of MR-proADM (AUROC: 0.849 [95% Cl 0.771-0.730]; p < 0.0001). The optimal value of MR-proADM to discriminate combined event of death or IOT is 0.895 nmol/l, with a sensitivity of 0.857 [95% Cl 0.728-0.987] and a specificity of 0.687 [95% Cl 0.587-0.787]. This study shows an association between MR-proADM levels and the severity of COVID-19. The assessment of MR-proADM combined with clinical scoring systems could be of great value in triaging, evaluating possible escalation of therapies, and admission avoidance or inclusion into trials. Larger prospective and controlled studies are needed to confirm these findings.","Sozio, Emanuela; Tascini, Carlo; Fabris, Martina; D039,; Aurizio, Federica; De Carlo, Chiara; Graziano, Elena; Bassi, Flavio; Sbrana, Francesco; Ripoli, Andrea; Pagotto, Alberto; Giacinta, Alessandro; Gerussi, Valentina; Visentini, Daniela; De Stefanis, Paola; Merelli, Maria; Saeed, Kordo; Curcio, Francesco",Sci Rep,,360

We identified a phenotype in individuals with extremely high viral load who could act as superspreaders. METHODS: Data were analyzed from individuals tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from 18 March through 15 August 2020. Outcomes were compared using contingency table and quantile regression to test the equality of medians between the pandemic waves and by viral load groups. RESULTS: Of the 11 564 samples tested, 1319 (11.4%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2. An increase in weekly median viral load occurred in the second wave of the SARS-CoV2 pandemic. This population was more likely to be women, outpatients, and symptomatic and to have an extremely high or high viral load. In patients with multiple reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction-positive test results, the durations of viral shedding were comparable between individuals with asymptomatic/mild and mild/moderate illness severity. CONCLUSIONS: We detected a small group of individuals with extremely high SARS-CoV-2 viral loads and mild illness. We believe that these individuals' characteristics could be consistent with the superspreader phenomenon and that greater awareness of the social dynamics of these individuals is needed to understand the spread of SARS-CoV-2.","Avadhanula, Vasanthi; Nicholson, Erin G; Ferlic-Stark, Laura; Piedra, Felipe-Andres; Blunck, Brittani N; Fragoso, Sonia; Bond, Nanette L; Santarcangelo, Patricia L; Ye, Xunyan; McBride, Trevor J; Aideyan, Letisha O; Patel, Kirtida D; Maurer, Lauren; Angelo, Laura S; Piedra, Pedro A",J Infect Dis,,360

227954,An Exploratory Study of COVID-19 Information on Twitter in the Greater Region,2021,"INTRODUCTION: In patients with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), immunological response is compromised. Knowledge about COVID-19 in CVID patients is sparse. We, here, synthesize current research addressing the level of threat COVID-19 poses to CVID patients and the best-known treatments. METHOD: Review of 14 publications. RESULTS: The number of CVID patients with moderate to severe (~29%) and critical infection courses (~10%), and the number of fatal cases (~13%), are increased compared to the general picture of COVID-19 infection. However, this might be an overestimate. Systematic cohort-wide studies are lacking, and asymptomatic or mild cases among CVID patients occur that can easily remain unnoticed. Regular immunoglobulin replacement therapy was administered in almost all patients, potentially explaining why the numbers of critical and fatal cases were not higher. In addition, the application of convalescent plasma was demonstrated to have positive effects. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 poses an elevated threat to CVID patients. However, only systematic studies can provide robust information on the extent of this threat. Regular immunoglobulin replacement therapy is beneficial to combat COVID-19 in CVID patients, and best treatment after infection includes the use of convalescent plasma in addition to common medication.","Weifenbach, Niels; Jung, Alisha; Lötters, Stefan",Immun.

Here, we conducted a prospective, multicenter, open-label and randomized controlled trial to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of XYP injection in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. We consecutively recruited 130 COVID-19 patients with mild to moderate symptoms from five study sites, and randomized them in 1:1 ratio to receive XYP injection in combination with standard therapy or receive standard supportive therapy alone. We found that XYP injection significantly reduced the time to cough relief, fever resolution and virus clearance. Less patients receiving XYP injection experienced disease progression to the severe stage during the treatment process. No severe adverse events were reported during the study. Taken together, XYP injection is safe and effective in improving the recovery of patients with mild to moderate COVID-19.

Thisstudy aimed to estimate the impact of hypothetical disruptions to organized FIT-based CRC screening programs on short-and long-term CRC incidence and mortality in three countries using microsimulation modelling. Methods Using CRC microsimulation models for Australia (Policy1-Bowel), Canada (OncoSim) and the Netherlands (ASCCAand MISCAN-Colon) participating in the COVID-19 and Cancer Global Modelling Consortium (CCGMC), we simulated a rangeof scenarios to assess the potential impact of disruptions to screening on CRC incidence and mortality. Modelled scenariosvaried by disruption duration (3-, 6-and 12-months), post-disruption participation reduction, and catch-up screeningstrategy (no catch-up, immediate and 6-month delayed catch-up). Results Without catch-up screening, CRC incidence increased by 0.1-0.3 %, 0.2-0.6 %, and 0.4-1.2 % over 2020-2050among individuals aged 50 years and older in the three modelled countries after 3-, 6-, and 12-month disruptions,respectively, compared to undisrupted screening and CRC mortality increased by 0.2-0.5 %, 0.4-1.0 %, and 0.8-2.0 % over2020-2050 among individuals aged 50 years and older compared to undisrupted screening. A 6-month disruption withoutcatch-up resulted in an estimated 3,552, 2,844 and 803-1,803 additional CRC diagnoses and 1,961, 1,319, and 678-881 additional CRC-related deaths in Australia, Canada and the Netherlands, respectively. A post-disruption reduction inparticipation increased CRC diagnoses by 0.2-0.9 % and CRC-related deaths by 0.5-1.6 % compared to undisruptedscreening. Providing catch-up screening minimized this impact to 0.0-0.2 %. Conclusions Although the relative impact of the modelled CRC screening disruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemicappears modest, given a high burden of CRC, there is a substantial impact on CRC diagnoses and deaths across allcountries considered. It is crucial that, if disrupted, screening programs ensure participation rates return to previouslyobserved rates and provide catch-up screening wherever possible, as the impact of any disruption could be considerablylarger otherwise.","De Jonge, L.; Worthington, J.; Van Wifferen, F.; Iragorri, N.; Peterse, E.

A number of vaccines have already achieved emergency use authorization based on data from large phase 3 field efficacy clinical trials. However, our knowledge about the extent and durability of this immunity, and the breadth of vaccine coverage against SARS-CoV-2 variants is still evolving. In this narrative review, we summarize the latest and rapidly developing understanding of immunity to SARS-CoV-2 infection, including what we have learned about the key antigens of SARS-CoV-2 (i.e., the spike protein and its receptor-binding domain), their importance in vaccine development, the immediate immune response to SARS-CoV-2, breadth of coverage of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, contributions of preexisting immunity to related coronaviruses, and duration of immunity. We also discuss lessons from newer approaches, such as systems serology, that provide insights into molecular and cellular immune responses elicited and how they relate to the trajectory of infection, and potentially inform immune correlates of protection. We also briefly examine the limited research literature on immune responses in special populations, such as pregnant women and children.","Fergie, Jaime; Srivastava, Amit",Front Immunol,,360

This qualitative study describes behavioral health provider perspectives on the use of telebehavioral health before and during the pandemic and how policy changes impacted access to and utilization of behavioral health services in Michigan. Materials and Methods: A convenience sample of 31 licensed and nonlicensed behavioral health providers operating in Michigan participated in semi-structured interviews between July and August 2020. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed by using inductive methods. Results: The thematic analysis resulted in four overarching themes: (1) increased access to care; (2) maintenance of quality of care; (3) minimal privacy concerns; and (4) client and provider satisfaction. Discussion: During and post-pandemic, providers need flexibility to determine whether in-person or telebehavioral health services, including audio-only, best meet client needs. Providers identified several populations for which telebehavioral health was less accessible: clients with serious mental illness and substance use disorder, those with no broadband Internet access, children, and older adults. Additional training in telebehavioral health service provision can positively impact quality of care. Conclusion: Policies that support reimbursement parity and expand provider use of telebehavioral health services should be maintained after the COVID-19 pandemic ends to avoid imposing barriers to accessing behavioral health care barriers post-pandemic.","Schoebel, Victoria; Wayment, Caitlyn; Gaiser, Maria; Page, Cory; Buche, Jessica; Beck, Angela J",Telemed. j. e. health,,360

233981,"Interpretations of ""Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol for Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (Trial Version 7)""",2020,"It has become clear since the pandemic broke out that SARS-CoV-2 virus causes reduction of smell and taste in a significant fraction of COVID-19 patients. The olfactory dysfunction often occurs early in the course of the disease, and sometimes it is the only symptom in otherwise asymptomatic carriers. The cellular mechanisms for these specific olfactory disturbances in COVID-19 are now beginning to be elucidated. Several very recent papers contributed to explaining the key cellular steps occurring in the olfactory epithelium leading to anosmia/hyposmia (collectively known as dysosmia) initiated by SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this Viewpoint, we discuss current progress in research on olfactory dysfunction in COVID-19 and we also propose an updated model of the SARS-CoV-2-induced dysosmia. The emerging central role of sustentacular cells and inflammatory processes in the olfactory epithelium are particularly considered. The proposed model of anosmia in COVID-19 does not answer unequivocally whether the new coronavirus exploits the olfactory route to rapidly or slowly reach the brain in COVID-19 patients. To answer this question, new systematic studies using an infectious virus and appropriate animal models are needed.","Bilinska, Katarzyna; Butowt, Rafal",ACS Chem Neurosci,,360

234476,After the Pandemic: Experimental Governance and the Foundational Economy,2021,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019, a highly transmissible respiratory infection, has created a public health crisis of global magnitude. The mainstay of diagnostic testing for coronavirus disease 2019 is molecular polymerase chain reaction testing of a respiratory specimen, obtained with a viral swab. As the incidence of new cases of coronavirus disease 2019 increases exponentially, the use of viral swabs to collect nasopharyngeal specimens is anticipated to increase drastically. CASE REPORT: This paper draws attention to a complication of viral swab testing in the nasopharynx and describes the premature engagement of a viral swab breakpoint, resulting in impaction in the nasal cavity. CONCLUSION: This case highlights a possible design flaw of the viral swab when used to collect nasopharyngeal specimens, which then requires an aerosol-generating procedure in a high-risk patient to be performed. The paper outlines a safe technique of nasal foreign body removal in a suspected coronavirus disease 2019 patient and suggests alternative testing materials.","Mughal, Z; Luff, E; Okonkwo, O; Hall, C E J",J Laryngol Otol,,360

With this, the world population is going through a process of changing habits, with social distance, improvement of hygiene techniques, to reduce the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and, consequently, reduce the number of hospitalized people in serious condition, as well as the mortality rate. This scenario has been promoting a continuous search for researchers, in the most varied areas, for possible methods of prevention or cure. Specifically, in the field of pharmaceutical nanotechnology, a variety of products are being developed against SARS-CoV-2. Under these circumstances, we propose here an exposition of some of the nanotechnological products (nanoscale between 1 to 1000 nm) currently designed for the detection of the virus, for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19, in addition to equipment for personal protection. We believe that pharmaceutical nanotechnology will be a valuable tool in the disease from the development of products that guarantee our protection against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.","Cavalcanti, Iago Dillion Lima; Cajubá de Britto Lira Nogueira, Mariane",J.

Two-thirds of the more than 600 original studies identified involved basic research, a pattern that is consistent with previous analyses of research funding allocations and that did not change over time. One of every eight studies involved intervention research, which occurred in community-based programs only about one-quarter of the time.

One natural type of question to ask tries to fill a gap in knowledge during text comprehension, like reading a news article: we might ask about background information, deeper reasons behind things occurring, or more. Despite recent progress with data-driven approaches, generating such questions is beyond the range of models trained on existing datasets. We introduce INQUISITIVE, a dataset of ~19K questions that are elicited while a person is reading through a document. Compared to existing datasets, INQUISITIVE questions target more towards high-level (semantic and discourse) comprehension of text. We show that readers engage in a series of pragmatic strategies to seek information. Finally, we evaluate question generation models based on GPT-2 and show that our model is able to generate reasonable questions although the task is challenging, and highlight the importance of context to generate INQUISITIVE questions.","Ko, Wei-Jen; Chen, Te-Yuan; Huang, Yiyan; Durrett, Greg; Li, Junyi Jessy",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.01657v1.pdf,360
236349,Current understanding on molecular drug targets and emerging treatment strategy for novel coronavirus-19,2021,"OBJECTIVES: The objectives were to characterize the effects of wearing face coverings on: 1) acoustic speech cues, and 2) speech recognition of patients with hearing loss who listen with a cochlear implant. METHODS: A prospective cohort study was performed in a tertiary referral center between July and September 2020. A female talker recorded sentences in three conditions: no face covering, N95 mask, and N95 mask plus a face shield. Spectral differences were analyzed between speech produced in each condition. The speech recognition in each condition for twenty-three adult patients with at least 6 months of cochlear implant use was assessed. RESULTS: Spectral analysis demonstrated preferential attenuation of high-frequency speech information with the N95 mask plus face shield condition compared to the other conditions. Speech recognition did not differ significantly between the uncovered (median 90% [IQR 89%-94%]) and N95 mask conditions (91% [IQR 86%-94%]; P = .253); however, speech recognition was significantly worse in the N95 mask plus face shield condition (64% [IQR 48%-75%]) compared to the uncovered (P < .001) or N95 mask (P < .001) conditions. CONCLUSIONS: The type and combination of protective face coverings used have differential effects on attenuation of speech information, influencing speech recognition of patients with hearing loss. In the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a need to protect patients and clinicians from spread of disease while maximizing patient speech recognition. The disruptive effect of wearing a face shield in conjunction with a mask may prompt clinicians to consider alternative eye protection, such as goggles, in appropriate clinical situations.

236647,Covid-19 fever symptom detection based on IoT cloud,2021,"COVID crisis has abruptly broken into our hospitals, and many difficulties have emerged, including those related to supply logistics. A huge number of new patients, a fast internal reorganization process and many other changes were suddenly established. These circumstances revealed the need to increase stocks of drugs, both for basic treatment as well as for specific SARS-CoV-2 infection management. At the same time, other problems (shortages, new and complex purchasing procedures, etc.) surfaced, so they could risk safety along the pharmacotherapeutic process. The main objective was to develop and implement all the necessary measures within the logistics circuit in order to ensure the availability of medicines for patients, as safely and effectively as possible, during the Coronavirus crisis. Firstly, two pharmacists were appointed to coordinate the whole process, and a preliminary analysis of the following aspects was carried out an estimation of needs to make an initial drug provisioning, a storage feasibility study and a global analysis of the logistics process to detect critical points. Three different circuits for medicines supply were established as some drugs were operated by Agencia Española de Medicamentos y Productos Sanitarios (AEMPS) or Servicio Madrileño de Salud (SERMAS), and others were under no restrictions. For stocks control, inventory was frequently reviewed and monitoring of prescription trends was implemented. For all new medicinal products, compliance with security standards was reviewed and relabeling was carried out if necessary. Criteria were defined for the storage of overstocks and it was placed an isolated area for quarantined drugs. Shortages inevitably occurred but their effects were partly mitigated by AEMPS and SERMAS. After all, we consider that the implemented procedure for logistics management may be reproducible, and the key points we have identified are the following: to enhance our quality management system, to develop an Action Plan for Healthcare Emergencies and to ensure the adequate training for all pharmacy staff. Furthermore, we also should address other aspects: to establish storage optimization strategies, to focus on a more advanced logistics management model, as well as to take advantage of the extraordinary multidisciplinary network, which has been consolidated during this COVID pandemic.","Palomar-Fernández, Carmen; Álvarez-Díaz, Ana",Farm Hosp,,360
237635,Mental simulation effects on performance: benefits of outcome versus process simulations in online courses,2020,"Across a broad range of stimulus types and tasks (16 stimulus types × 26 tasks, 1,744 observers in total), the present study employed an individual-item differences analysis to extract the factors of visual-attentional processing. Three orthogonal factors were identified and they can be summarized as an FVS 2.0 framework: featural, visual, and spatial strengths. Apart from one exception (low-level motion), the FVS 2.0 framework accounts for the vast majority (95.4%) of the variances in the 25 tasks. Therefore, the three straightforward factors provide a unifying framework for understanding the relationship between stimulus types as well as those between tasks. Combining these and other related results, the role of preattentive features seems to be rather different from the traditional view: visual features are general purpose, exclusive, innate, constancy based, and keyword like. A general-purpose, exclusive, innate, constancy-based and keyword-like (GEICK) conjecture is proposed which suggests that the features are conscious-level keywords generated by the specific brain area of V4 and/or IT and then used by all other brain areas.

She underwent simultaneous pancreas and kidney transplantation for type 1 diabetes 8 years previously followed by a renal transplant 1 year prior to presentation, and was taking tacrolimus as long-term immunosuppression. The full blood count showed haemoglobin 97 g/L, platelet count 2×109/L and neutrophil count 0.22×109/L. Peripheral blood film examination confirmed genuine thrombocytopenia in the absence of any haemolytic or malignant features. Serological testing identified autoantibodies against all three blood lineages, consistent with a diagnosis of autoimmune pancytopenia. Treatment with steroids, intravenous immunoglobulins, romiplostim and mycophenolate mofetil achieved only fleeting remissions. Blood counts eventually normalised following the administration of rituximab and a change from tacrolimus to ciclosporin immunosuppression. Cytopenias are a well-recognised complication of post-transplantation care but we believe this to be the first reported case of autoimmune pancytopenia following solid organ transplantation. In this case report, we discuss the approach to investigation of haematological abnormalities post-transplant and the rationale for, and outcome of, the management of this rare case.","Bull, Tom; Jolley, Ruth; Martin-Cabrera, Pedro; Thomas, William",BMJ case reports,,360

Furthermore, we show that our method is able to generalize to crowdsourced samples from Latin America and clinical samples from South Asia, without further training using the specific samples from those regions. As more crowdsourced data is collected, further development can be implemented using various respiratory audio samples to create a cough analysis-based machine learning (ML) solution for COVID-19 detection that can likely generalize globally to all demographic groups in both clinical and non-clinical settings.","Chaudhari, Gunvant; Jiang, Xinyi; Fakhry, Ahmed; Han, Asriel; Xiao, Jaclyn; Shen, Sabrina; Khanzada, Amil",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.13320v2.pdf,360

Although replication-defective in normal cells, 28 kbp of adenovirus genes is delivered to the cell nucleus alongside the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein gene. METHODS: We used direct RNA sequencing to analyse transcript expression from the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 genome in human MRC-5 and A549 cell lines that are non-permissive for vector replication alongside the replication permissive cell line, HEK293. In addition, we used quantitative proteomics to study over time the proteome and phosphoproteome of A549 and MRC5 cells infected with the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine. RESULTS: The expected SARS-CoV-2 S coding transcript dominated in all cell lines. We also detected rare S transcripts with aberrant splice patterns or polyadenylation site usage. Adenovirus vector transcripts were almost absent in MRC-5 cells, but in A549 cells, there was a broader repertoire of adenoviral gene expression at very low levels. Proteomically, in addition to S glycoprotein, we detected multiple adenovirus proteins in A549 cells compared to just one in MRC5 cells. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine's transcriptomic and proteomic repertoire in cell culture is as expected. The combined transcriptomic and proteomics approaches provide a detailed insight into the behaviour of this important class of vaccine using state-of-the-art techniques and illustrate the potential of this technique to inform future viral vaccine vector design.","Almuqrin, Abdulaziz; Davidson, Andrew D; Williamson, Maia Kavanagh; Lewis, Philip A; Heesom, Kate J; Morris, Susan; Gilbert, Sarah C; Matthews, David A",Genome Med,,360

METHOD: A discrete event simulation was used to explore the impact of different permutations of staff roster, including the number of shifts per day, the number of staff on duty per shift, overall number of staff accessible to work in the laboratory (i.e. overall staff pool), the frequency of shift changes (i.e. number of consecutive days worked), fixed work-rest days and split team arrangement on workplace transmission of COVID-19 by a simulated index staff who acquired the infection from the community over 21 days. Additionally, the impact of workplace social distancing (physical distancing) and use of personal protective equipment (PPE) were investigated. RESULTS: A higher rate of transmission was associated with smaller overall staff pool (expressed as multiples of the number of staff per shift), higher number of shifts per day, higher number of staff per shift, and longer consecutive days worked. Having fixed work-rest arrangement did not significantly reduce the transmission rate unless the workplace outbreak was prolonged. Social distancing and PPE use significantly reduced the transmission rate. CONCLUSION: Laboratories should consider organizing the staff into smaller teams/shift and reduce the number of consecutive days worked. Additionally, our observation aligns with the IFCC biosafety recommendation of monitoring staff health (to detect early infection), split team arrangement, workplace social distancing and use of PPE.","Lim, Chun Yee; Bohn, Mary Kathryn; Lippi, Giuseppe; Ferrari, Maurizio; Loh, Tze Ping; Yuen, Kwok-Yung; Adeli, Khosrow; Horvath, Andrea Rita",Clin. biochem,,360

However, the unprecedented year of 2020 and the COVID-19 pandemic has prompted a drastic change in healthcare provision across all disease areas. In this review, we summarize changes that have been introduced to support rehabilitation in axSpA during the pandemic and considerations for the future of axSpA rehabilitation in the wake of COVID-19. We have witnessed the launch of online virtual physical therapy and education, in addition to an emphasis on remote monitoring. We have been propelled into a new era of digital service provision;not only providing a temporary stop-gap in treatment for some patients, but in future potentially allowing for a wider reach/ provision of care and resilience of vital services. Unique collaboration between patients, healthcare professionals and researchers will be key to foster relationships/ trust and facilitate wider evaluation and implementation of digital services at each stage in a patient?s journey - imperative to relieve pressure from healthcare providers. Despite the potential of such digital interventions, it is important to highlight the maintained critical need for face-to-face services, particularly for vulnerable patients or during diagnosis or a flare of symptoms. It is also vital that we remain vigilant regarding digital exclusion, to avoid further widening of existing health inequalities. Optimisation of digital infrastructure, staff skills and digital education alongside promoting accessibility, engagement and building trust among communities will be vital as we enter this new age of blended in-person/ digital service provision.","Barnett, Rosemarie Sengupta Raj",Arthritis Care & Research,,360
243923,"A comprehensive review on viral zoonosis: Emphasizing on pathogenesis, diagnosis, treatment, prevention strategies and future perspectives",2020,"BACKGROUND: Improved oncological and surgical measures now enable curative treatment of malignant lower extremity tumors in majority of cases. Complication rates associated with surgical resection of lower extremity tumors and replacement with megaendoprostheses are high. The aim of this study was to identify risk factors that predispose to revision surgery following the use of megaimplants in curative treatment of malignant tumors of the lower extremities. METHODS: this retrospective study included patients aged &#8805; 18 years who underwent implantation of a megaendoprosthesis for tumors or metastatic lesions of the lower extremities between January 2010 and December 2020. Baseline characteristics and information on adjuvant treatment, hospitalization time, comorbidities, mobility, complications, and revision surgery were considered. Primary outcomes were revision surgery and reasons for revision. Secondary outcomes were in-hospital complications and the duration of hospitalization. RESULTS: Fifty-four patients (48% female, age 63 years, SD 15) were available for final analysis. Surgeries were performed at hip level in 37 patients (68.5%) and at knee level in 17 patients (31.5%). Revision for wound-related causes was performed in 12 cases (22.2%), with microbiological proof of infection in 8 cases (14.8%). Revision for hip joint instability was carried out in 4 cases (7.4%) and for disconnection between components of the megaimplant in 2 cases (3.7%). Those patients requiring a wound-related revision had undergone a longer primary surgical intervention than those who required an implant-related revision (276 vs 134 min, p = .002). Wound drains after the primary implantation remained longer in situ in patients who later required revision surgery for wound-related complications (5 vs 3 days, p = .020). An ASA > 3 was associated with an increased likelihood for in-hospital complications in general (p = .041), and in-hospital death in particular (p = .012). CONCLUSIONS: The management of malignant tumors of the lower extremities with megaendoprostheses is associated with a high rate of wound-related complications. Swift surgical performance and early postoperative removal of wound drains minimize the risk of complications in general and the necessity of revision surgery in particular. Patients with more comorbidities were more likely to suffer in-hospital complications.","von Salis-Soglio, Moritz; Ghanem, Mohamed; Lycke, Christian; Roth, Andreas; Osterhoff, Georg",J Orthop Surg Res,,360
244372,Progress in Instruction,2020,"COVID-19 has devastated care homes. Point of care tests (POCTs), mainly using Lateral Flow Devices (LFDs), have been deployed hurriedly without much consideration of their usability or impact on care workflow. Even after the pandemic POCTs, particularly multiplex tests, may be an important control against spread of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory infections in care homes by enabling identification of cases. They should not, however, replace other infection control measures such as barrier methods and quarantine. Adherence to LFDs as implemented among care home staff is suboptimal. Other tests-such as point of care polymerase chain reaction and automated antigen tests-would also need to be accommodated into care home workflows to improve adherence. The up-front costs of POCTs are straightforward but additional costs, including staffing preparation and reporting processes and the impacts of false positive and negative tests on absence rates and infection days, are more complex and as yet unquantified. A detailed appraisal is needed as the future of testing in care homes is considered.","Buckle, Peter; Micocci, Massimo; Tulloch, John; Kierkegaard, Patrick; Parvulescu, Paula; Thompson, Carl; Spilsbury, Karen; Allen, A Joy; Body, Richard; Hayward, Gail; Buchan, Iain; Gordon, Adam L",Age ageing,,360

Follow-up analysis in a cohort of 171 patients at 4-11 months after the onset revealed high levels of IgG antibodies. A total of 78.1% (164/210) of the specimens tested positive for neutralizing antibody (NAb). SARS-CoV-2 antigen peptide pools-stimulated-IL-2 and -IFN-Î³ response can distinguish COVID-19 convalescent individuals from healthy donors. Interestingly, NAb survival was significantly affected by the antigen peptide pools-stimulated-IL-2 response, -IL-8 response, and -IFN-Î³ response. The antigen peptide pools-activated CD8+ T cell counts were correlated with NAb. The antigen peptide pools-activated natural killer (NK) cell counts in convalescent individuals were correlated with NAb and disease severity. Our data suggested that the development of NAb is associated with the activation of T cells and NK cells. Our work provides a basis for further analysis of the protective immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and for understanding the pathogenesis of COVID-19. It also has implications for the development of an effective vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Pan, Yunbao; Jiang, Xianghu; Yang, Liu; Chen, Liangjun; Zeng, Xiaojiao; Liu, Guohong; Tang, Yueting; Qian, Chungen; Wang, Xinming; Cheng, Fangming; Lin, Jun; Wang, Xinghuan; Li, Yirong",Signal Transduct Target Ther,,360

These risk factors combine with shift work and concomitant irregular sleep patterns to increase the prevalence of fatigue. Fatigue is closely linked with stress and, subsequently, poor physiological and psychological health. In parallel, a wealth of evidence has demonstrated the health and wellbeing benefits of spending time in nature. Here, we sought to examine whether spending time in nature was associated with lower levels of fatigue, anxiety and depression in HGV drivers. 89 long-distance drivers (98.9% male, mean ± SD age: 51.0 ± 9 years, body mass index: 29.8 ± 4.7 kg/m2) participating in a wider health promotion programme reported time spent in nature (during and before the Covid-19 pandemic) and symptoms of occupational fatigue, depression and anxiety. After controlling for covariates, truck drivers who visited nature at least once a week exhibited 16% less chronic fatigue prior to the pandemic, and 23% less chronic fatigue and 20% less acute fatigue during the pandemic. No significant differences were observed for either anxiety or depression.

The oligonucleotide was used for searching and recognizing target viral RNA sequence, and the conjugated 4A2-5 was used for guided RNase L activation to sequence-specifically degrade viral RNAs. Since RNase L can potently cleave single-stranded RNA during innate antiviral response, degradation efficiencies with these chimeras were twice as much as those with only antisense oligonucleotides for both SARS-CoV-2 RNA targets. In pseudovirus infection models, chimera-S4 achieved potent and broad-spectrum inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 and its N501Y and/or &#916;H69/&#916;V70 mutants, indicating a promising antiviral agent based on the nucleic acid-hydrolysis targeting chimera (NATAC) strategy.","Su, Xiaoxuan; Ma, Wenxiao; Feng, Di; Cheng, Boyang; Wang, Qian; Guo, Zefeng; Zhou, Demin; Tang, Xinjing",Angew. chem; int. ed. engl,,360

256064,Hypertension and predisposition to infection: an important issue during this global pandemic,2020,"With the rapid spread of COVID-19 worldwide, the demand for appropriate face masks in the market has also skyrocketed To ease strain on the supply of masks to the essential healthcare sector, it has become imperative that ordinary people rely more on home-made masks that can be easily put together using commonly available materials, while at the same time performing reasonably at arresting the ingress or egress of airborne droplets Here, we propose a simple do-it-yourself (DIY) method for preparing a three-layered face mask that deploys two hydrophobic polypropylene nonwoven layers interspaced with a hydrophilic cellulosic cloth The first hydrophobic layer, facing the user, allows high-momentum droplets (e g , expelled by a sneeze or cough) to pass through and get absorbed in the next hydrophilic layer, thereby keeping the skin in contact with the mask dry and comfortable The third (outermost) hydrophobic layer prevents penetration of the liquids from the middle layer to the outside, and also arrests any airborne droplets on its exterior Simple tests show that our masks perform better in arresting the droplet transmission as compared to surgical masks available in the market","Sarkar, Sourav; Mukhopadhyay, Achintya; Sen, Swarnendu; Mondal, Safwan; Banerjee, Arnav; Mandal, Pranibesh; Ghosh, Ratna; Megaridis, Constantine M.; Ganguly, Ranjan",Transactions of the Indian National Academy of Engineering,,360
256195,A Comprehensive Survey of Enabling and Emerging Technologies for Social Distancing - Part II: Emerging Technologies and Open Issues,2020,"Purpose Adults with mild-to-moderate age-related hearing loss typically exhibit issues with speech understanding, but their processing of syntactically complex sentences is not well understood. We test the hypothesis that listeners with hearing loss' difficulties with comprehension and processing of syntactically complex sentences are due to the processing of degraded input interfering with the successful processing of complex sentences. Method We performed a neuroimaging study with a sentence comprehension task, varying sentence complexity (through subject-object order and verb-arguments order) and cognitive demands (presence or absence of a secondary task) within subjects. Groups of older subjects with hearing loss (n = 20) and age-matched normal-hearing controls (n = 20) were tested. Results The comprehension data show effects of syntactic complexity and hearing ability, with normal-hearing controls outperforming listeners with hearing loss, seemingly more so on syntactically complex sentences. The secondary task did not influence off-line comprehension. The imaging data show effects of group, sentence complexity, and task, with listeners with hearing loss showing decreased activation in typical speech processing areas, such as the inferior frontal gyrus and superior temporal gyrus. No interactions between group, sentence complexity, and task were found in the neuroimaging data. Conclusions The results suggest that listeners with hearing loss process speech differently from their normal-hearing peers, possibly due to the increased demands of processing degraded auditory input. Increased cognitive demands by means of a secondary visual shape processing task influence neural sentence processing, but no evidence was found that it does so in a different way for listeners with hearing loss and normal-hearing listeners.","Vogelzang, Margreet; Thiel, Christiane M; Rosemann, Stephanie; Rieger, Jochem W; Ruigendijk, Esther",J Speech Lang Hear Res,,360

SARS-CoV- 2 infection has so far caused more than one million deaths, with the only measures capable of containing the spread of the virus being social distancing, frequent hand washing, and the wearing of masks. Vaccine development was urgently needed and there are now more than 90 candidate vaccines being developed using different technologies. The European Medicines Agency has recently approved a second mRNA-based vaccine, but the introduction of vaccines has raised some doubts about patients with rheumatic disease, who are at high risk of infection because of disease activity and the therapies used to treat it. The aim of this study was to investigate how vaccines may interact with the immune system and treatment of such patients, and how to monitor the post-vaccine antibody titres and T cell responses in order to assess their efficacy and safety.","Benucci, Maurizio Infantino Maria Marotto Daniela Ardizzone Sandro Manfredi Mariangela Sarzi-Puttini Piercarlo",Clinical and experimental rheumatology,,360

In addition to these known mutations, other new mutations have been found across regions in this study. Based on the results, in which 4,326 SARS-CoV-2 whole sequences were used, some mutations are found to be peculiar with certain regions, while some other mutations are found in all regions. In Asia, mutations (3 different mutations in QLA46612 isolated from South Korea) were found in the same sequence. Although huge number of mutations are detected (more than 70 in Asia) by regions, according to bioinformatics tools, some of them which are G75V (isolated from North America), T95I (isolated from South Korea), G143V (isolated from North America), M177I (isolated from Asia), L293M (isolated from Asia), P295H (isolated from Asia), T393P (isolated from Europe), P507S (isolated from Asia), and D614G (isolated from all regions) (These color used only make correct) predicted a damage to spike’ protein structure. Furthermore, this study also aimed to reveal how binding sites of ligands change if the spike protein structure is damaged, and whether more than one mutation affects ligand binding. Mutations that were predicted to damage the structure did not affect the ligand-binding sites, whereas ligands’ binding sites were affected in those with multiple mutations. It is thought that this study will give a different perspective to both the vaccine SARS-CoV studies and the change in the structure of the spike protein belonging to this virus against mutations.","Aktas, E.",Bioinformatics and Biology Insights,,360

We established a chronic pain model induced by chronic constriction injury (CCI) and models of acute pain and anxiety without pain in mice that were subsequently subjected to partial hepatectomy surgery. Morris water maze (MWM) tests were performed to evaluate the learning and memory abilities of the mice. ELISA was used to measure IL-1ß, IL-6, and TNF-&#945; in serum, and HPLC-MS was used to detect neurotransmitters in the prefrontal cortices and hippocampi of the mice. The results indicated that chronic pain induced by CCI might have significantly impaired the learning and memory abilities of mice, while acute pain and anxiety without pain only affected the memory abilities of mice. Perioperative acute pain increased the level of IL-1ß in serum, and CCI might have increased the level of IL-6. CCI and acute pain increased dopamine (DA) levels in the cortex, similar to anxiety. Like anxiety, CCI increased 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) levels in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. Acute pain led to a decrease in the acetylcholine (ACH) level in the hippocampus. Our results suggest that acute pain and CCI-induced chronic pain might aggravate postoperative cognitive dysfunction via neurotransmitters and by changing the levels of inflammatory factors such as IL-1ß and IL-6.","Ding, Xian; Gao, Xiang; Wang, Zhichun; Jiang, Xuliang; Lu, Shunmei; Xu, Jingjing; Qin, Guowei; Gu, Zhengfeng; Huang, Dongxiao",J. mol. neurosci,,360

However, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic presents a potential challenge to the country's goal for malaria elimination by 2025. The path toward malaria elimination depends on sustained interventions to prevent rapid resurgence, which can quickly set back any gains achieved.Malaria Consortium supported mobile malaria workers (MMWs) to engage with target communities to build acceptance, trust, and resilience. At the start of the pandemic, Malaria Consortium conducted a COVID-19 risk assessment and quickly developed and implemented a mitigation plan to ensure MMWs were able to continue providing malaria services without putting themselves or their patients at risk. Changes in malaria intervention coverage and community uptake have been monitored to gauge the indirect effects of COVID-19. Comparisons have been made between output indicators reported in 2020 and from the same month-period of the previous year.In general, malaria service intervention coverage and utilization rates did not decline in 2020. Rather, the reported figures show there was a substantial increase in service utilization. Preliminary internal reviews and community meetings show that despite a heightened public risk perception toward COVID-19, malaria testing motivation has been well sustained throughout the pandemic. This may be attributable to proactive program planning and data monitoring and active engagement with the communities and the national authorities to circumvent the indirect effect of COVID-19 on intervention coverage in Cambodia during the pandemic.","Feldman, Mitra; Vernaeve, Lieven; Tibenderana, James; Braack, Leo; Debackere, Mark; Thu, Htin Kyaw; Hamade, Prudence; Lo, Koung",Glob Health Sci Pract,,360
259999,Weathering Economic Shocks and Financial Uncertainty: Here We Go Again,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Headache is one of the most frequent neurologic manifestations in COVID-19. We aimed to analyze which symptoms and laboratory abnormalities were associated with the presence of headache and to evaluate if patients with headache had a higher adjusted in-hospital risk of mortality. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study. We included all consecutive patients admitted to the Hospital with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection between March 8th and April 11th, 2020. We collected demographic data, clinical variables and laboratory abnormalities. We used multivariate regression analysis. RESULTS: During the study period, 576 patients were included, aged 67.2 (SD: 14.7), and 250/576 (43.3%) being female. Presence of headache was described by 137 (23.7%) patients. The all-cause in-hospital mortality rate was 127/576 (20.0%). In the multivariate analysis, patients with headache had a lower risk of mortality (OR: 0.39, 95% CI: 0.17-0.88, p = 0.007). After adjusting for multiple comparisons in a multivariate analysis, variables that were independently associated with a higher odds of having headache in COVID-19 patients were anosmia, myalgia, female sex and fever; variables that were associated with a lower odds of having headache were younger age, lower score on modified Rankin scale, and, regarding laboratory variables on admission, increased C-reactive protein, abnormal platelet values, lymphopenia and increased D-dimer. CONCLUSION: Headache is a frequent symptom in COVID-19 patients and its presence is an independent predictor of lower risk of mortality in COVID-19 hospitalized patients.","Trigo, Javier; García-Azorín, David; Planchuelo-Gómez, Álvaro; Martínez-Pías, Enrique; Talavera, Blanca; Hernández-Pérez, Isabel; Valle-Peñacoba, Gonzalo; Simón-Campo, Paula; de Lera, Mercedes; Chavarría-Miranda, Alba; López-Sanz, Cristina; Gutiérrez-Sánchez, María; Martínez-Velasco, Elena; Pedraza, María; Sierra, Álvaro; Gómez-Vicente, Beatriz; Arenillas, Juan Francisco; Guerrero, Ángel L",J Headache Pain,,360

Although the symptoms remain mild in most patients, the elderly and patients with previous comorbidities have higher rates of morbidity and mortality. Patients with liver cirrhosis, especially after decompensation, may be more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection due to systemic immune dysfunction. CASE REPORT The patient was a 51-year-old man who was hypertensive, an ex-alcoholic abstinent for 6 months, and a smoker. He was diagnosed with alcoholic liver cirrhosis in July 2019, and was using norfloxacin at home for secondary prophylaxis of bacterial peritonitis. He was also using furosemide and spironolactone to control ascites and propranolol for primary prophylaxis of esophageal varices. The patient entered our hospital in July 2020 with cough, dyspnea, runny nose, diarrhea, and fever.

We aimed to investigate the prevalence of infection among HCW in medical disciplines with AGP. DesignA nationwide questionnaire-based study in in- and outpatient settings was conducted between 12/16/2020 and 01/24/2021. Data on SARS-CoV-2 infections among HCW and potential risk factors were investigated. Results2,070 healthcare facilities with 25,113 employees were included in the study. Despite a higher rate of pre-interventional testing, clinics treated three times more confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases than private practices (28.8% vs. 88.4%, p<0.001). Overall infection rate among HCW accounted for 4.7%. Multivariate analysis revealed that ZIP-regions having comparably higher incidences were significantly associated with increased risk of infection. Furthermore, clinical setting and the GIE specialty have more than double the risk of infection (OR 2.63; 95% CI 2.501-2.817, p<0.01 and OR 2.35; 95% CI 2.245-2.498, p<0.01). The number of procedures performed per day was also significantly associated with an increased risk of infection (OR 1.01; 95% CI 1.007-1.014), p<0.01). No treatment of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases was tending to lower the risk of infection (OR 0.72; 95% CI 0.507-1.025, p=0.068). ConclusionHCW in GIE seem to be at higher risk of infection than those in other AGP, especially in the clinical setting. Regions having comparably higher incidences as well as the number of procedures performed per day were also significantly associated with increased risk of infection. Significance of this studyO_ST_ABSWhat is already known on this subject?C_ST_ABSHealth care workers, especially those exposed to aerosol generating procedures, are assumed to have an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, data confirming this are lacking, especially for the outpatient care setting. What are the new findings?Health care workers in gastrointestinal endoscopy have a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2-infection than in other AGPs. This risk is particularly higher - in clinical settings compared to private practices - in regions having comparably higher incidences - the more procedures are performed per day How might it impact on clinical practice in the foreseeable future?Our study suggests making additional efforts to protect HCW in the gastrointestinal work field.","Roemmele, Christoph; Ebigbo, Alanna; Kahn, Maria; Zellmer, Stephan; Muzalyova, Anna; Hammel, Gertrud; Bartenschlager, Christina; Beyer, Albert; Rosendahl, Jonas; Schlittenbauer, Tilo; Zenk, Johannes; Al-Nawas, Bilal; Frankenberger, Roland; Hoffmann, Juergen; Arens, Christoph; Lammert, Frank; Traidl-Hoffmann, Claudia; Messmann, Helmut",,,360

264631,The Impact of OJK Regulation No. 48/POJK.03/2020 on the Quality of Credit and Risk Management of Banking Credit (preprint),2021,"BACKGROUND: Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and azithromycin (AZM) are antimalarial drugs recently reported to be active against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus- 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is causing the global COVID-19 pandemic. In an emergency response to the pandemic, we aimed to develop a quantitation method for HCQ, its metabolites desethylhydroxychloroquine (DHCQ) and bisdesethylchloroquine (BDCQ), and AZM in human plasma. METHODS: Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry was used to develop the method. Samples (20 µL) are extracted by solid-phase extraction and injected onto the LC-MS/MS system equipped with a PFP column (2.0 × 50 mm, 3 µm). ESI+ and MRM are used for detection. Ion pairs m/z 336.1â247.1 for HCQ, 308.1â179.1 for DHCQ, 264.1â179.1 for BDCQ, and 749.6â591.6 for AZM are selected for quantification. The ion pairs m/z 342.1â253.1, 314.1â181.1, 270.1â181.1, and 754.6â596.6 are selected for the corresponding deuterated internal standards (IS) HCQ-d4, DHCQ-d4, BDCQ-d4, and AZM-d5. The less abundant IS ions from 37Cl were used to overcome the interference from the analytes. RESULTS: Under optimized conditions, retention times are 0.78 min for BDCQ, 0.79 min for DHCQ, 0.92 min for HCQ and 1.87 min for AZM. Total run time is 3.5 min per sample. The calibration ranges are 2-1000 ng/mL for HCQ and AZM, 1-500 ng/mL for DHCQ and 0.5-250 ng/mL for BDCQ; samples above the range are validated for up to 10-fold dilution. Recoveries of the method ranged from 88.9-94.4% for HCQ, 88.6-92.9% for DHCQ, 88.7-90.9% for BDCQ, and 98.6%-102% for AZM. The IS normalized matrix effect were within (100±10) % for all 4 analytes. Blood samples are stable for at least 6 hr at room temperature. Plasma samples are stable for at least 66 hr at room temperature, 38 days at -70°C, and 4 freeze-thaw cycles. CONCLUSIONS: An LC-MS/MS method for simultaneous quantitation of HCQ, DHCQ, BDCQ, and AZM in human plasma was developed and validated for clinical studies requiring fast turnaround time and small samples volume.","Sok, Vong; Marzan, Florence; Gingrich, David; Aweeka, Francesca; Huang, Liusheng",PLoS One,,360
264632,The Impact of OJK Regulation No. 48/POJK.03/2020 on the Quality of Credit and Risk Management of Banking Credit (preprint),2021,"Unprecedented by number of casualties and socio-economic burden occurring worldwide, the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the worst health crisis of this century. In order to develop adequate countermeasures against Covid-19, identification and structural characterization of suitable antiviral targets within the SARS-CoV-2 protein repertoire is urgently needed. The nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (N) is a multifunctional and highly immunogenic determinant of virulence and pathogenicity, whose main functions consist in oligomerizing and packaging the single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) viral genome. Here we report the structural and biophysical characterization of the SARS-CoV-2 N C-terminal domain (CTD), on which both N homo-oligomerization and ssRNA binding depend. Crystal structures solved at 1.44 Å and 1.36 Å resolution describe a rhombus-shape N CTD dimer, which stably exists in solution as validated by size-exclusion chromatography coupled to multi-angle light scattering and analytical ultracentrifugation. Differential scanning fluorimetry revealed moderate thermal stability and a tendency towards conformational change. Microscale thermophoresis demonstrated binding to a 7-bp SARS-CoV-2 genomic ssRNA fragment at micromolar affinity. Furthermore, a low-resolution preliminary model of the full-length SARS-CoV N in complex with ssRNA, obtained by cryo-electron microscopy, provides an initial understanding of self-associating and RNA binding functions exerted by the SARS-CoV-2 N.","Zinzula, Luca; Basquin, Jerome; Bohn, Stefan; Beck, Florian; Klumpe, Sven; Pfeifer, Günter; Nagy, István; Bracher, Andreas; Hartl, F Ulrich; Baumeister, Wolfgang",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,,360

METHODS: In April 2020, we deployed online questionnaires to individuals in their home environment to assess the prevalence and potential risk factors of suspected COVID-19 in persons with NID (PwNID) and change in their neurological care. RESULTS: Our cohort included 1115 participants (630 NID, 98% MS; 485 reference) as of 30 April 2020. 202 (18%) participants, residing in areas with high COVID-19 case prevalence, met the April 2020 CDC symptom criteria for suspected COVID-19, but only 4% of all participants received testing given testing shortages. Among all participants, those with suspected COVID-19 were younger, more racially diverse, and reported more depression and liver disease. PwNID had the same rate of suspected COVID-19 as the reference group. Early changes in disease management included telemedicine visits in 21% and treatment changes in 9% of PwNID. After adjusting for potential confounders, increasing neurological disability was associated with a greater likelihood of suspected COVID-19 (ORadj = 1.45, 1.17-1.84). INTERPRETATIONS: Our study of real-time, patient-reported experience during the COVID-19 pandemic complements physician-reported MS case registries which capture an excess of severe cases. Overall, PwNID seem to have a risk of suspected COVID-19 similar to the reference population.","Levin, Seth N; Venkatesh, Shruthi; Nelson, Katie E; Li, Yi; Aguerre, Ines; Zhu, Wen; Masown, Karman; Rimmer, Kathryn T; Diaconu, Claudiu I; Onomichi, Kaho B; Leavitt, Victoria M; Levine, Libby L; Strauss-Farber, Rebecca; Vargas, Wendy S; Banwell, Brenda; Bar-Or, Amit; Berger, Joseph R; Goodman, Andrew D; Longbrake, Erin E; Oh, Jiwon; Weinstock-Guttman, Bianca; Thakur, Kiran T; Edwards, Keith R; Riley, Claire S; Xia, Zongqi; De Jager, Philip L",Ann Clin Transl Neurol,,360

It was hypothesised that high care disruptions and psychological stress would be observed among paediatric and adult CHD patients in the early phase of the pandemic. METHODS: A cross-sectional, international, electronic survey study was completed. Eligible participants included parents of children with acquired or CHD, adults with CHD, or caregivers of adults with CHD. RESULTS: A total of 1220 participants from 25 countries completed the survey from 16 April to 4 May, 2020. Cardiac care disruption was significant with 38% reporting delays in pre-pandemic scheduled cardiac surgeries and 46% experiencing postponed cardiac clinic visits. The majority of respondents (75%) endorsed moderate to high concern about the patient with heart disease becoming ill from COVID-19. Worry about returning for in-person care was significantly greater than worry of harm to patient due to postponed care. Clinically significant psychological stress was high across the sample including children (50%), adults with CHD (42%), and caregivers (42%). CONCLUSIONS: The early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to considerable disruptions in cardiac care for patients with paediatric and adult CHD. COVID-19-related fears are notable with potential to impact willingness to return to in-person care. Psychological stress is also very high necessitating intervention. Further study of the impact of delays in care on clinical outcomes is warranted.","Cousino, Melissa K; Pasquali, Sara K; Romano, Jennifer C; Norris, Mark D; Yu, Sunkyung; Reichle, Garrett; Lowery, Ray; Viers, Suzanne; Schumacher, Kurt R",Cardiol Young,,360

267924,Animal Studies,2020,"The infectious power of coronaviruses is dependent on cholesterol present in the membranes of their target cells. Indeed, the virus enters the infected cell either by fusion or by endocytosis, in both cases involving cholesterol-enriched membrane microdomains. These membrane domains can be disorganized in-vitro by various cholesterol-altering agents, including statins that inhibit cell cholesterol biosynthesis. As a consequence, numerous cell physiology processes, such as signaling cascades, can be compromised. Also, some examples of anti-bacterial and anti-viral effects of statins have been observed for infectious agents known to be cholesterol dependent. In-vivo, besides their widely-reported hypocholesterolemic effect, statins display various pleiotropic effects mediated, at least partially, by perturbation of membrane microdomains as a consequence of the alteration of endogenous cholesterol synthesis. It should thus be worth considering a high, but clinically well-tolerated, dose of statin to treat Covid-19 patients, in the early phase of infection, to inhibit virus entry into the target cells, in order to control the viral charge and hence avoid severe clinical complications. Based on its efficacy and favorable biodisposition, an option would be considering Atorvastatin, but randomized controlled clinical trials are required to test this hypothesis. This new therapeutic proposal takes benefit from being a drug repurposing, applied to a widely-used drug presenting a high efficiency-to-toxicity ratio. Additionally, this therapeutic strategy avoids any risk of drug resistance by viral mutation since it is host-targeted. Noteworthy, the same pharmacological approach could also be proposed to address different animal coronavirus endemic infections that are responsible for heavy economic losses.","Orlowski, Stéphane; Mourad, Jean-Jacques; Gallo, Antonio; Bruckert, Eric",Biochimie,,360

We propose a framework that delineates the structural composition of costs imposed by market violence that ranges from extraction to e-waste disposal. We advocate for the engineering of policies that create conditions for doing more with less resources, eliminating waste, and recycling as crucial steps in creating sustainable waste management innovations. Additionally, we highlight a set of fundamental issues regarding enablers and inhibitors of sustainable innovations and policies for waste management worth considering for future research. These include programmed obsolescence, irresponsible extraction, production, and consumption, all seen through the theoretical lens of market violence.","Ahen, Frederick Amankwah-Amoah Joseph",Sustainability,,360

One of the largest aspects of cost of the MSWM system is the collection of waste. This paper describes a methodology that combines geographic information systems (GIS), hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set (HFLTS), and the full multiplicative form of multi-objective optimization by ratio analysis (MULTIMOORA), to determine suitable locations for waste collection boxes (named AYPIKUT), which have been designed specifically for collection of domestic waste vegetable oil and waste batteries. It takes as case study, Atakum, a district of Samsun city, Turkey. As a solution to the problem, first, a total of 88 items have been identified for consideration by seven criteria elicited from the insights of experts, and spatial analyses were performed. Multi-criteria HFLTS was then used to determine weights of the criteria. Population density was the most significant criterion affecting the selection process, and proximity to housing complexes with more than 150 dwellings was the least important. According to the weights of the seven criteria, and three rules determined by the experts, 15 AYPIKUT locations were identified using GIS. As a final step, the alternative locations (A1-A15) were ranked with the MULTIMOORA method. A5 was the most suitable site, and A6 was the least suitable site for an AYPIKUT. The results indicated the ability of the proposed model to select the suitable locations for waste collection box.","Çalis Boyaci, Asli; Sisman, Aziz; Saricaoglu, Köksal",,,360

270280,The Rising Costs of Fossil-Fuel Extraction: An Energy Crisis That Will Not Go Away,2020,"Since January 2020, the COVID-19 outbreak has been progressing at a rapid pace. To keep the pandemic at bay, countries have implemented various measures to interrupt the transmission of the virus from person to person and prevent an overload of their health systems. We analyze the impact of these measures implemented against the COVID-19 pandemic by using a sample of 68 countries, Puerto Rico and the 50 federal states of the United States of America, four federal states of Australia, and eight federal states of Canada, involving 6,941 daily observations. We show that measures are essential for containing the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. After controlling for daily COVID-19 tests, we find evidence to suggest that school closures, shut-downs of non-essential business, mass gathering bans, travel restrictions in and out of risk areas, national border closures and/or complete entry bans, and nationwide curfews decrease the growth rate of the coronavirus and thus the peak of daily confirmed cases. We also find evidence to suggest that combinations of these measures decrease the daily growth rate at a level outweighing that of individual measures. Consequently, and despite extensive vaccinations, we contend that the implemented measures help contain the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic and ease the overstressed capacity of the healthcare systems.","Kaimann, Daniel; Tanneberg, Ilka",PLoS One,,360

Objectives: The objective was to understand the spatial distribution and trends of the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Mumbai during the lockdown period and draw insights for effective actions. Methods: Spatial and trend analysis was conducted to trace the spread of the virus during the lockdown period in April 2020. The administrative divisions of Mumbai, in the form of wards and zones, have been used as units of analysis. Results: Greater Mumbai area occupies only 0.015% of the landmass of India, but is contributing to over 20% of the SARS-CoV-2 cases in India. Cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections have increased over 375 times within 50 days of the lockdown. An analysis of trends across the wards during the 3-week period (April 4 to April 25) shows a skewed pattern, with three zones out of six contributing to the vast majority of cases in Mumbai. The wards with higher formal economic activity are relatively less affected than the other wards. The test positivity rate in Mumbai is much higher than the rest of India. Conclusion: The study suggests that the virus had already spread to the community in Mumbai before the lockdown started.","Mukherjee, Kanchan",Indian J Public Health,,360
271189,Leading in a VUCA World,2021,"This study was conducted to assess the clinical spectrum, management, and outcome of SARS-CoV-2-related multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). We reviewed medical records of children with MIS-C diagnosis seen at the Children's Hospital of Michigan in Detroit between April and June 2020. Thirty-three children were identified including 22 who required critical care (group 1) and 11 with less intense inflammation (group 2). Children in group 1 were older (median 7.0 years) than those in group 2 (median 2.0 years). Abdominal pain was present in 68% of patients in group 1. Hypotension or shock was present in 17/22 patients in group 1. Thirteen (39.4%) had Kawasaki disease (KD)-like manifestations. Five developed coronary artery dilatation; All resolved on follow-up. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) was given to all patients in group 1 and 7/11 in group 2. Second-line therapy was needed in 13/22 (group 1) for persisting inflammation or myocardial dysfunction; 12 received infliximab. All patients recovered.Conclusion: MIS-C clinical manifestations may overlap with KD; however, MIS-C is likely a distinct inflammatory process characterized by reversible myocardial dysfunction and rarely coronary artery dilatation. Supportive care, IVIG, and second-line therapy with infliximab were associated with a favorable outcome. What is Known: â¢ Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) manifestations include fever, gastrointestinal symptoms, shock, and occasional features of Kawasaki disease (KD). â¢ Treatment includes immunomodulatory agents, most commonly IVIG and corticosteroids. What is New: â¢ Spectrum of MIS-C varies from mild to severe inflammation and coronary artery dilatation occurred in 5/22 (23%) critically ill patients. â¢ IVIG and infliximab therapy were associated with a favorable outcome including resolution of coronary dilatation; only 2/33 received corticosteroids.","Abdel-Haq, Nahed; Asmar, Basim I; Deza Leon, Maria P; McGrath, Eric J; Arora, Harbir S; Cashen, Katherine; Tilford, Bradley; Charaf Eddine, Ahmad; Sethuraman, Usha; Ang, Jocelyn Y",Eur. j. pediatr,,360

In this study, we characterize the impact of the lockdown associated with the pandemic on air quality in six major cities across the state of Florida, namely: Jacksonville, Tallahassee, Gainesville, Orlando, Tampa, and Miami. Hourly measurements of PM2.5, ozone, NO2, SO2, and CO were provided by the US EPA at thirty sites operated by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection during mid-February to mid-April from 2015 through 2020. To analyze the effect of the pandemic, atmospheric pollutant concentrations in 2020 were compared to historic data at these cities during the same period from 2015 to 2019. Reductions in NO2 and CO levels were observed across the state in most cities and were attributed to restrictions in mobility and the decrease in vehicle usage amid the lockdown. Likewise, decreases in O3 concentrations were observed and were related to the prevailing NOx-limited regime during this time period. Changes in concentrations of SO2 exhibited spatial variations, concentrations decreased in northern cities, however an increase was observed in central and southern cities, likely due to increased power generation at facilities primarily in the central and southern regions of the state. PM2.5 levels varied temporally during the study and were positively correlated with SO2 concentrations during the lockdown. In March, reductions in PM2.5 levels were observed, however elevations in PM2.5 concentrations in April were attributed to long-range transport of pollutants rather than local emissions. This study provides further insight into the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on anthropogenic sources from vehicular emissions and power generation in Florida. This work has implications for policies and regulations of vehicular emissions as well as consequences on the use of sustainable energy sources in the state.","El-Sayed, Marwa M H; Elshorbany, Yasin F; Koehler, Kirsten",Environ Pollut,,360

This survey aimed to explore the views of an ethnically diverse sample of HCPs in the UK about COVID-19-related deaths among HCPs in general and BAME HCPs in particular. METHODS: It is a cross-sectional prospective survey of HCPs in UK and was conducted online using Google Forms between 28th April and 4th May 2020. FINDINGS: A total of 1119 UK HCPs (aged 45.0 ± 9.5 years, 56% males, 71% BAME) participated. Seventy-two per cent of respondents reported being worried about COVID-19 and 84% had concerns about personal protective equipment (PPE). Almost all (93%) respondents felt that inadequate PPE may be a contributory factor to HCP deaths. Half of the respondents, especially younger and BAME, reported feeling unable to say 'no', if asked to work without adequate PPE. BAME HCPs were considered at a higher-risk of acquiring coronavirus and dying with COVID-19. Reasons for excess BAME HCP deaths were believed to be comorbidities, inadequate PPE and working in high-risk areas. Majority (81%) of respondents felt that the government has been slow to respond to COVID-19 related deaths in HCPs and 67% HCPs were of the opinion that BAME workers with risk factors should be removed from direct clinical care. INTERPRETATION: HCPs have significant COVID-19-related concerns. BAME HCPs are considered at increased risk due to comorbidities, working in high-risk areas, and inadequate PPE. BAME HCP should have a thorough risk assessment and high-risk HCPs may need work adjustment or redeployment.

274096,SOCMS : Smart online class monitoring system,2021,"Urbanization is an ongoing global phenomenon as more and more people are moving from rural to urban areas for better employment opportunities and a higher standard of living, leading to the growth of megacities, broadly defined as urban agglomeration with more than 10 million inhabitants. Intense activities in megacities induce high levels of air pollutants in the atmosphere that harm human health, cause regional haze and acid deposition, damage crops, influence air quality in regions far from the megacity sources, and contribute to climate change. Since the Great London Smog and the first recognized episode of Los Angeles photochemical smog seventy years ago, substantial progress has been made in improving the scientific understanding of air pollution and in developing emissions reduction technologies. However, much remains to be understood about the complex processes of atmospheric oxidation mechanisms; the formation and evolution of secondary particles, especially those containing organic species; and the influence of emerging emissions sources and changing climate on air quality and health. While air quality has substantially improved in megacities in developed regions and some in the developing regions, many still suffer from severe air pollution. Strong regional and international collaboration in data collection and assessment will be beneficial in strengthening the capacity. This article provides an overview of the sources of emissions in megacities, atmospheric physicochemical processes, air quality trends and management in a few megacities, and the impacts on health and climate.

The only current FDA-approved treatment, which directly targets the virus, is the ProTide prodrug remdesivir. In its activated form, remdesivir prevents viral replication by inhibiting the essential RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Like other ProTide prodrugs, remdesivir contains a chiral phosphorus center. The initial selection of the (SP)-diastereomer for remdesivir was reportedly due to the difficulty in producing the pure (RP)-diastereomer of the required precursor. However, the two currently known enzymes responsible for the initial activation step of remdesivir are each stereoselective and show differential tissue distribution. Given the ability of the COVID-19 virus to infect a wide array of tissue types, inclusion of the (RP)-diastereomer may be of clinical significance. To help overcome the challenge of obtaining the pure (RP)-diastereomer of remdesivir, we have developed a novel chemoenzymatic strategy that utilizes a stereoselective variant of the phosphotriesterase from Pseudomonas diminuta to enable the facile isolation of the pure (RP)-diastereomer of the chiral precursor for the chemical synthesis of the (RP)-diastereomer of remdesivir.","Bigley, Andrew N; Narindoshvili, Tamari; Raushel, Frank M",Biochemistry,,360

Comparing Climate Change Mitigation Through Geoengineering Versus Reduced Vehicle Emissions,2021,"The electrochemical behaviors of thiourea (TU) oxidation have been studied at Palladium (Pd) electrode in the acidic medium by recording cyclic voltammograms (CVs). The influence of pH was investigated in the pH range of 1.0 to 9.0. Facilitated adsorption of TU on electrode surface results in enhanced catalytic response in acidic medium and maximum electro-catalytic response was found at pHâ¼3.0. Chronoamperometric (CA) experiment determined this oxidation as 1e- transfer process and the variation of TU concentration reveals a 1st order kinetics. In the CV responses, the large value of peak separation (âµEp >380â mV) calculated by the variation of scan rate indicates that oxidation of TU is an irreversible process. With the aid of convolution potential sweep voltammetry (CPSV), the standard rate constant (k°) for the reaction was found to be 7.1×10-4 cm/s and the formal potential constant (E°' ) was evaluated to be â¼0.37â V vs Ag/AgCl (sat. KCl). The value of transfer coefficient (&#945;) was found to vary from 0.74 to 0.40 with applied potential (E). From the potential dependent variation of transfer coefficient (&#945;) and activation energy (âµG&#8800; ), it was concluded that the overall electrochemical oxidation of TU follows a stepwise mechanism at lower potential (<0.40) V and a concerted one at relatively higher potential (>0.40) V. The FTIR analysis of the product after oxidation of TU molecules confirmed the appearance of a new sharp band near 530â cm-1 due to the formation of S-S bonds suggesting formation of formamidine disulfide (FD) ions.","Shabik, Md Fazle; Begum, Humayra; Rahman, Mohammed M; Marwani, Hadi M; Hasnat, Mohammad A",Chem. - Asian j.

Although all confirmed cases were linked to a general ward designated for pulmonology patients, no medical staff members, medical support personnel, or employees working at the same ward were infected. Contact with confirmed COVID-19 cases was frequent among inpatients and medical support personnel. The most common contact area was the general ward for pulmonology patients and medical support areas, including clinical and imaging examination rooms. Finally, the total number of hospital-associated infections was 14, consisting of four diagnosed at our hospital and ten diagnosed outside the hospital. CONCLUSIONS: The robust control of the COVID-19 outbreak further minimized the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the hospital and local communities. However, there was also a debate over the appropriate period of hospital shutdown and testing of all hospital staff and patients. Future studies are required to refine and establish the in-hospital quarantine and de-isolation guidelines based on the epidemiological and clinical settings.","Kim, Sei Won; Jo, Sung Jin; Lee, Heayon; Oh, Jung Hwan; Lim, Jihyang; Lee, Sang Haak; Choi, Jung Hyun; Lee, Jehoon",PLoS One,,360
275780,The growth of cyber entrepreneurship in the food industry: virtual community engagement in the COVID-19 era,2020,"This study presents the first evidence of effects of applying both positive and negative stimuli simultaneously on visual laterality in Old World monkeys. Thirteen captive individuals of Sichuan snub-nosed monkeys (Rhinopithecus roxellana) were chosen as focal subjects in the monocular box task. In total, 4 emotional categories (the preferred, the novel, the neutral, and the fearful) of visual stimuli were applied, and eye preference was recorded when individuals looked at each stimulus through an observation hole in the box. We found evidence of visual laterality at the individual level, but not at the group level for each stimulus. For the preferred stimulus, 9 individuals showed significant right-eye preference while 4 individuals showed significant left-eye preference. For the other 3 stimuli, 7 individuals displayed significant right-eye preference while 6 individuals displayed significant left-eye preference. Totally, 11 of 13 individuals showed consistency in the visual laterality direction (7 right-eye preference and 4 left-eye preference) across the 4 stimuli. The remaining 2 individuals displayed right-eye preference for the preferred stimulus while they showed left-eye preference for the other 3 stimuli. There was no significant difference among various stimuli regarding the direction of visual laterality. However, there was a significant difference in the strength of visual laterality among various stimulus categories. The strength of visual laterality for the preferred stimulus was significantly lower than that for the other 3 stimuli. The strength of visual laterality for the fearful stimulus was significantly higher than that for the novel stimulus and the neutral stimulus. Furthermore, the looking duration for the preferred stimulus was significantly higher than that for the other 3 stimuli. The looking duration for the novel stimulus was significantly higher than that for the neutral stimulus and the fearful stimulus. The looking duration for the neutral stimulus was significantly higher than that for the fearful stimulus. Our findings indicate emotional valence of stimuli significantly influence eye looking duration and the strength of visual laterality but not for the direction of visual laterality in this species. Taken together, emotional valence of stimuli plays an important role in the eye use of R. roxellana.","Zhao, Dapeng; Wang, Yuan; Li, Baoguo",Folia Primatol (Basel),,360

Evidence from macro-data with special implications for China,2021,"OBJECTIVE: Preliminary findings suggest a relationship between lower serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels and incidence and severity of COVID-19. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between vitamin D status at admission and different markers of inflammation, coagulation, and sepsis in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. METHOD: We conducted a retrospective study on 137 consecutive patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and available data on serum 25(OH)D levels, who were admitted to our Institution between March 1 and April 30, 2020. Patients were divided into two groups: survivors (n = 78; 57%) and non-survivors (n = 59; 43%). RESULTS: At admission, all patients showed hypovitaminosis D. Median total serum 25(OH)D levels at admission were significantly higher in survivors than non-survivors (12 ng/mL vs 8 ng/mL; p < 0.01). Non-survivors exhibited significantly higher median levels of white blood cell (WBC) count, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte count ratio (NLR), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), ferritin, interleukin 6 (IL-6), D-dimer, fibrinogen, and procalcitonin (PCT) compared to survivors at three different time points during hospitalization. In a multivariate analysis performed by a logistic regression model, serum 25(OH)D levels were significantly inversely associated with risk of COVID-19-related in-hospital mortality (odds ratio, 0.91; 95% confidence interval, 0.85-0.98; p = 0.01). According to receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, hsCRP, NLR, ferritin, and D-dimer were the best predictive biomarkers for poor prognosis of COVID-19, whereas IL-6, PCT, fibrinogen, 25(OH)D, WBC count, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-&#945;) may serve as supportive biomarkers for worse clinical course of the disease. CONCLUSIONS: We found a markedly high prevalence (100%) of hypovitaminosis D in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19, suggesting a possible role of low vitamin D status in increasing the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and subsequent hospitalization. The inverse association between serum 25(OH)D levels and risk of in-hospital mortality observed in our cohort suggests that a lower vitamin D status upon admission may represent a modifiable and independent risk factor for poor prognosis in COVID-19.","Infante, Marco; Buoso, Andrea; Pieri, Massimo; Lupisella, Santina; Nuccetelli, Marzia; Bernardini, Sergio; Fabbri, Andrea; Iannetta, Marco; Andreoni, Massimo; Colizzi, Vittorio; Morello, Maria",J Am Coll Nutr,,360

Understanding the epidemiology of reported COVID-19 cases helps decision makers in planning future responses. We described the epidemiological patterns, laboratory surveillance and contact tracing of COVID-19 cases in Punjab. Methods: We analysed state's COVID-19 data from March-May 2020 to describe time, place and person distribution. We analysed the laboratory surveillance and contact tracing reports to calculate frequency of testing, sample positivity rate (PR) and contacts traced per case. Findings: A total of 2256 cases were reported from March-May, 2020 (attack rate 75 cases/million and case fatality rate 2%). Attack rate was higher among males (81 cases/million males) and maximum affected age group was 60-69 years (164â5 cases/million). Five of 22 districts reported almost half cases in May's first week. Mortality rate was highest among individuals >60years (six deaths/million) and males (two deaths/million males). Of 45 deaths, 41 reported comorbidities [(hypertension (42%), diabetes (40%)]. COVID-19 testing increased from 46 samples/day (PR: 2%) in March's first week to 4000 samples/day (PR: 2â5%) by May's end (2752 tests/million). Amritsar conducted 2035 tests/million (highest PR: 6â5%) while Barnala conducted 4158 tests/million (lowest PR: 1%). For 2256 cases, 19,432 contacts were traced (nine contacts/case) with 11% positivity rate. Interpretation: COVID-19 in Punjab mostly affected males, >60 years of age and individuals with comorbid conditions. Many districts with less testing and contact tracing had higher positivity rate. We recommended to implement and ensure adequate testing and contact tracing in all the districts of Punjab.","Sharma, Sahil; Goel, Kapil; Kurup, Karishma Krishna; Grover, Gagandeep Singh; Bhaskar, Rajesh",Clin Epidemiol Glob Health,,360

This workflow is accessible to a wide range of students in life science majors regardless of their prior bioinformatics knowledge, and all software is freely available, thus eliminating potential cost barriers. Using the workflow can thus provide a diverse group of students the opportunity to conduct inquiry-driven research. Here we demonstrate the utility of this workflow and outline the logical steps involved in the identification of therapeutic or vaccine targets against SARS CoV-2. We also provide an example of how the workflow may be adapted to other infectious microbes. Overall, our workflow anchors student understanding of viral biology and genomics and allows students to develop valuable bioinformatics expertise as well as to hone critical thinking and problem-solving skills, while also creating an opportunity to better understand emerging information surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic.","Bryce, Samantha; Heath, Kevin N.; Issi, Luca; Ryder, Elizabeth F.; P.

Two divergent hypotheses have been proposed: hyperinflammatory cytokine storm; and failure of host protective immunity that results in unrestrained viral dissemination and organ injury. A key explanation for the inability to address this controversy has been the lack of diagnostic tools to evaluate immune function in COVID-19 infections. ELISpot, a highly sensitive, functional immunoassay, was employed in 27 patients with COVID-19, 51 patients with sepsis, 18 critically ill nonseptic (CINS) patients, and 27 healthy control volunteers to evaluate adaptive and innate immune status by quantitating T cell IFN-É£ and monocyte TFN-&#945; production. Circulating T cell subsets were profoundly reduced in COVID-19 patients. Additionally, stimulated blood mononuclear cells produced less than 40%-50% of the IFN-É£ and TNF-&#945; observed in septic and CINS patients, consistent with markedly impaired immune effector cell function. Approximately 25% of COVID-19 patients had increased IL-6 levels that were not associated with elevations in other canonical proinflammatory cytokines. Collectively, these findings support the hypothesis that COVID-19 suppresses host functional adaptive and innate immunity. Importantly, IL-7 administered ex vivo restored T cell IFN-É£ production in COVID-19 patients. Thus, ELISpot may functionally characterize host immunity in COVID-19 and inform prospective therapies.","Remy, Kenneth E; Mazer, Monty; Striker, David A; Ellebedy, Ali H; Walton, Andrew H; Unsinger, Jacqueline; Blood, Teresa M; Mudd, Philip A; Yi, Daehan J; Mannion, Daniel A; Osborne, Dale F; Martin, R Scott; Anand, Nitin J; Bosanquet, James P; Blood, Jane; Drewry, Anne M; Caldwell, Charles C; Turnbull, Isaiah R; Brakenridge, Scott C; Moldwawer, Lyle L; Hotchkiss, Richard S",JCI insight,,360

Typical approaches for PPE detection based on deep learning are (i) to train an object detector for items such as those listed above or (ii) to train a person detector and a classifier that takes the bounding boxes predicted by the detector and discriminates between people wearing and people not wearing the corresponding PPE items. We propose a novel and accurate approach that uses three components: a person detector, a body pose estimator and a classifier. Our novelty consists in using the pose estimator only at training time, to improve the prediction performance of the classifier. We modify the neural architecture of the classifier by adding a spatial attention mechanism, which is trained using supervision signal from the pose estimator. In this way, the classifier learns to focus on PPE items, using knowledge from the pose estimator with almost no computational overhead during inference.","Sandru, Adrian; Duta, Georgian-Emilian; Georgescu, Mariana-Iuliana; Ionescu, Radu Tudor",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.12339v1.pdf,360
281329,My home is my castle – The benefits of working from home during a pandemic crisis,2021,"At the end of 2019, the pandemic, which originated in China, has become a major concern all over the world. A new coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been defined as the reason for a cluster of unknown pneumonia. Thus far, no precise therapy or vaccine has been shown to be effective against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Mild cases can be treated by supportive care although symptomatic treatment is not enough for critically ill patients. However, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, convalescent (immune) plasma (CIP) and certain specific antiviral drugs for this disease are still being investigated for improving the survival rate of cases with SARS-CoV-2 infection whose condition continued to deteriorate. The use of passive immunization, for the prophylaxis and therapy of human contagious diseases, has been gone back to the 20thcentury. Human whole blood is also a source of antibodies. CIP consists of collecting blood plasma from someone who has recovered from a specific infection. Recent literature data show that human CIP may be an alternative option for managing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and will be accessible when adequate numbers of individuals have improved. However, such donors should have a high titer of neutralizing immunoglobulin-containing plasma. CIP can be administered to improve the survival rate for COVID-19, together with other drugs and preventive measures, when specific management is not obtainable. On the other hand, randomized clinical trials are still necessary to assess the safety and efficiency of CIP in the therapy of COVID-19. In this article, we want to address the special role of CIP therapy in various infectious diseases from yesterday to today, including COVID-19.","Özdemir, Öner; Arsoy, Hacer Efnan Melek",Erciyes. med.

282064,Rethinking Vaccine Development as an Integral Part of Preparedness in the European Health Union,2020,"Objectives. The COVID-19 pandemic has made a major impact on hospital services globally, including the care of persons with diabetes and endocrine disorders. The aim of this study is to describe the epidemiology of COVID-19 in the ASEAN Federation of Endocrine Societies (AFES) member countries; to describe challenges, changes and opportunities in caring for patients with endocrine diseases, as well as in fellowship training programs, and endocrine-related research in the AFES countries. Methodology. The AFES ASEAN Survey Of Needs in Endocrinology (AFES A.S.-O.N.E.) was an open-ended questionnaire that was sent to the presidents and representatives of the AFES member countries by email. Responses from Societies were collated and synthesized to obtain perspectives on the emergent issues in endocrinology in the Southeast Asian region during this pandemic. Results. The burden of COVID-19 cases varied widely across the AFES member countries, with the least number of cases in Vietnam and Myanmar, and the greatest number of cases in either the most populous countries (Indonesia and the Philippines), or a country with the highest capability for testing (Singapore). The case fatality rate was also the highest for Indonesia and the Philippines at around 6%, and lowest for Vietnam at no fatalities. The percentage with diabetes among patients with COVID-19 ranged from 5% in Indonesia to 20% in Singapore, approximating the reported percentages in China and the United States. The major challenges in managing patients with endocrine diseases involved inaccessibility of health care providers, clinics and hospitals due to the implementation of lockdowns, community quarantines or movement control among the member countries. This led to disruptions in the continuity of care, testing and monitoring, and for some, provision of both preventive care and active management including surgery for thyroid cancer or pituitary and adrenal tumors, and radioactive iodine therapy. Major disruptions in the endocrine fellowship training programs were also noted across the region, so that some countries have had to freeze hiring of new trainees or to revise both program requirements and approaches to training due to the closure of outpatient endocrine clinics. The same observations are seen for endocrine-related researches, as most research papers have focused on the pandemic. Finally, the report ends by describing innovative approaches to fill in the gap in training and in improving patient access to endocrine services by Telemedicine. Conclusion. The burden of COVID-19 cases and its case fatality rate varies across the AFES member countries but its impact is almost uniform: it has disrupted the provision of care for patients with endocrine diseases, and has also disrupted endocrine fellowship training and endocrine-related research across the region. Telemedicine and innovations in training have been operationalized across the AFES countries in an attempt to cope with the disruptions from COVID-19, but its over-all impact on the practice of endocrinology across the region will only become apparent once we conquer this pandemic.","Jasul, Gabriel; Paz-Pacheco, Elizabeth; Jimeno, Cecilia; Suastika, Ketut; Hussein, Zanariah; Mustafa, Norlaila; Aung, Aye Aye; Robles, Jeremyjones; Leow, Melvin Khee Shing; Deerochanawong, Chaicharn; Khue, Nguyen Thy; Dang, Tran Huu",J.

Accepted manuscripts have been peer-reviewed and copyedited, but are posted online before technical formatting and author proofing. These manuscripts are not the final version of record and will be replaced with the final article (formatted per AJHP style and proofed by the authors) at a later time. PURPOSE: This case report describes utilization of thromboelastography (TEG) in the setting of an acute major bleed in a patient on dabigatran who had concomitant acute kidney injury. SUMMARY: An 80-year-old female presented to the emergency department after a fall with complaints of pain in her knee, shoulder, and hip. Her medical history was significant for coronary artery disease, for which she took clopidogrel 75 mg daily, and atrial fibrillation, for which she took dabigatran 150 mg twice daily. The physical exam was remarkable for pain within the shoulder, hip, and knee, which had swelling and ecchymosis that extended into the right thigh. Given the possibility of compartment syndrome with multiple possible etiologies of coagulopathy, TEG and computed tomography angiography (CTa) of the right lower extremity were performed. The initial TEG showed prolonged R time and activated clotting time, indicating clotting factor dysfunction with no additional coagulopathy noted, including antiplatelet effects. On the basis of the TEG and CTa findings, it was decided to reverse dabigatran with 5 grams of idarucizumab. Approximately 1 hour after administration of idarucizumab, the patient was taken to interventional radiology where a limited angiogram of the right lower extremity showed no active extravasation. Because of the patient's renal dysfunction and the possibility of rebound hypercoaguability, repeat TEG tests were ordered at 4 and 8 hours after the initial reversal to ensure clearance of idarucizumab-dabigatran complexes. The repeat TEG values showed complete reversal of the initial coagulopathy noted. During the admission, the patient required no blood transfusions or surgical interventions and all her initial laboratory results improved. CONCLUSION: Serial TEG testing was successful at managing multiple coagulopathies in a patient at risk for trauma-induced compartment syndrome.","Gilbert, Brian W; Ott, Jacob M; Philip, George J",Am. j. health system pharm,,360
282953,The Economic Freedom Fighters: rethinking Du Bois in a tale of reconstruction,2020,"SARS-CoV-2 testing is crucial to controlling the spread of this virus, yet shortages of nucleic acid extraction supplies and other key reagents have hindered the response to COVID-19 in the US. Several groups have described loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assays for SARS-CoV-2, including testing directly from nasopharyngeal swabs and eliminating the need for reagents in short supply. Frequent surveillance of individuals attending work or school is currently unavailable to most people but will likely be necessary to reduce the ~50% of transmission that occurs when individuals are nonsymptomatic. Here we describe a fluorescence-based RT-LAMP test using direct nasopharyngeal swab samples and show consistent detection in clinically confirmed primary samples with a limit of detection (LOD) of ~625 copies/µl, approximately 100-fold lower sensitivity than qRT-PCR. While less sensitive than extraction-based molecular methods, RT-LAMP without RNA extraction is fast and inexpensive. Here we also demonstrate that adding a lysis buffer directly into the RT-LAMP reaction improves the sensitivity of some samples by approximately 10-fold. Furthermore, purified RNA in this assay achieves a similar LOD to qRT-PCR. These results indicate that high-throughput RT-LAMP testing could augment qRT-PCR in SARS-CoV-2 surveillance programs, especially while the availability of qRT-PCR testing and RNA extraction reagents is constrained.","Dudley, Dawn M; Newman, Christina M; Weiler, Andrea M; Ramuta, Mitchell D; Shortreed, Cecilia G; Heffron, Anna S; Accola, Molly A; Rehrauer, William M; Friedrich, Thomas C; O039,; Connor, David H",PLoS One,,360

283483,US Spillovers of US Monetary Policy: Information effects&Financial Flows,2021-08-02,"BACKGROUND The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic that spread from China is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The head and neck region can be variably affected in adult patients, and taste and smell disorders are typical manifestations. However, pediatric clinical signs are less severe, making the onset diagnosis challenging to interpret. The variability of nasal olfactory symptoms in children and adolescents is intertwined with possible warning signs, including gastrointestinal, ocular, or dermatological symptoms. We present a case involving a 15-year-old boy with clinically confirmed COVID-19 who had late-onset rash and transient taste and smell disorders. CASE REPORT The boy's clinical history revealed that a family member was positive for SARS-CoV-2. In the preceding 3 days, the boy's eating habits had changed; he perceived a metallic taste while eating and had a loss of appetite. He also had erythematous skin lesions on the lower limbs for the 2 previous days. A sore throat, nasal congestion, and a runny nose were reported on head and neck examination. A real-time polymerase chain reaction test was positive, confirming the initial diagnostic hypothesis. CONCLUSIONS SARS-CoV-2 virus infection in children and adolescents can be asymptomatic, but it can also occur with fever, dry cough, fatigue, and gastrointestinal symptoms. Due to the unique immune characteristics of pediatric and adolescent patients, the correct interpretation of the gustatory and skin symptoms associated with specific laboratory tests for SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to the most appropriate management and supportive care.","Maniaci, Antonino; Iannella, Giannicola; Vicini, Claudio; Pavone, Piero; Nunnari, Giuseppe; Falsaperla, Raffaele; Di Mauro, Paola; Ferlito, Salvatore; Cocuzza, Salvatore",Am J Case Rep,,360

One dose of the BNT162b2 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine is efficacious in the general population, but responses in patients receiving hemodialysis are uncertain. METHODS: We obtained serial plasma from patients receiving hemodialysis and health care worker controls before and after vaccination with 1 dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine, as well as convalescent plasma from patients receiving hemodialysis who survived COVID-19. We measured anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels and stratified groups by evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: Our study included 154 patients receiving hemodialysis (135 without and 19 with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection), 40 controls (20 without and 20 with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection) and convalescent plasma from 16 patients. Among those without previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, anti-RBD IgG was undetectable at 4 weeks in 75 of 131 (57%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 47% to 65%) patients receiving hemodialysis, compared with 1 of 20 (5%, 95% CI 1% to 23%) controls (p < 0.001). No patient with nondetectable levels at 4 weeks developed anti-RBD IgG by 8 weeks. Results were similar in non-immunosuppressed and younger individuals. Three patients receiving hemodialysis developed severe COVID-19 after vaccination. Among those with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, median anti-RBD IgG levels at 8 weeks in patients receiving hemodialysis were similar to controls at 3 weeks (p = 0.3) and to convalescent plasma (p = 0.8). INTERPRETATION: A single dose of BNT162b2 vaccine failed to elicit a humoral immune response in most patients receiving hemodialysis without previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, even after prolonged observation. In those with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, the antibody response was delayed. We advise that patients receiving hemodialysis be prioritized for a second BNT162b2 dose at the recommended 3-week interval.","Goupil, Rémi; Benlarbi, Mehdi; Beaubien-Souligny, William; Nadeau-Fredette, Annie-Claire; Chatterjee, Debashree; Goyette, Guillaume; Gunaratnam, Lakshman; Lamarche, Caroline; Tom, Alexander; Finzi, Andrés; Suri, Rita S",CMAJ,,360

288309,"Leading with stories: Andrew Cuomo, family narratives and authentic leadership",2021,"IntroductionDozens of medications have been re-evaluated as possible treatments for coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Tocilizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against the interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor that has been proposed as a therapy for patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. It is possible that the immunomodulatory effects of tocilizumab may also have the unintended consequence of predisposing to secondary infections. We sought to assess the risk of invasive fungal disease and therapeutic impact of tocilizumab on hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) outcomes in critically ill patients with severe COVID-19. MethodsRecords of critically-ill patients with COVID-19 over a 6 month period at our institution were reviewed, and medical histories, treatments, and clinical outcomes were extracted. The incidence of fungal infections in those that received tocilizumab in addition to standard COVID-19 treatments was assessed. ICU length of stay (LOS), duration of mechanical ventilation, and hospital LOS were compared between treatment groups. ResultsOne-hundred and thirty patients were identified, of which 56 met inclusion criteria. 16 patients received tocilizumab, and 40 did not. Invasive fungal infections occurred in 10.7% of all patients. Infection rates were significantly higher in the tocilizumab group than in the control group (31.2% v 2.5%, RR 12.5, p&lt;0.01). There was a strong dose-response relation for tocilizumab, with 2.5% of events occurring with 0 doses, 20% with a single dose, and 50% with 2 doses (M-H OR 39, p&lt;0.01). There were also statistically significant increased ICU LOS (3.73 v 1.91, p &lt;0.01), duration of mechanical ventilation (3.58 v. 1.95, p&lt;0.01), and hospital LOS (3.83 v. 2.58, p &lt;0.01) in those that received tocilizumab and developed a fungal infection (Figure 1). ConclusionsRepurposed therapies like tocilizumab may have a potential role in the treatment of severe COVID-19, but these data suggest there is a significant risk of developing secondary fungal infection and highlight the impact this can have on important ICU outcomes.

In this study, a recombinant Newcastle disease virus (NDV) expressing the hemagglutinin of PPRV (NDV-PPRVH) was evaluated on small ruminants by serology response in sheep and goats, experimental infection in goats and immunity duration in sheep. The NDV-PPRVH vaccine injected twice at 28 days' interval, provided full protection against challenge with a virulent PPR strain in the most sensitive species and induced significant neutralizing antibodies. Immunological response in goats was slightly higher than sheep and the vaccine injected at 108.0 50 % egg infective dose/mL allowed anti-PPRV antibodies that lasted at least 12 months as shown by antibody response monitoring in sheep. The NDV vector presented a limited replication in the host and vaccinated animals remained negative when tested by cELISA based on PPRV nucleoprotein allowing DIVA. This recombinant vaccine appears to be a promising candidate in a free at risk countries and may be an important component of the global strategy for PPR eradication.","Fakri, F Z; Bamouh, Z; Elmejdoub, S; Elkarhat, Z; Tadlaoui, K; Chen, W; Bu, Z; Elharrak, M",Vet Microbiol,,360
289022,Business and Society Research in Times of the Corona Crisis,2020,"Information about factors potentially favoring the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in rural settings is limited. Following a case-control study design in a rural Ecuadorian village that was severely struck by the pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 RNA were detected by real-time PCR in swabs obtained from inner and upper walls in 24/48 randomly selected latrines from case-houses and in 12/48 flushing toilets from paired control-houses (P = 0.014; McNemar's test). This association persisted in a conditional logistic regression model adjusted for relevant covariates (OR: 4.82; 95% CI: 1.38-16.8; P = 0.014). In addition, SARS-CoV-2-seropositive subjects were more often identified among those living in houses with a latrine (P = 0.002). Latrines have almost five times the odds of containing SARS-CoV-2 RNA than their paired flushing toilets. Latrines are reservoirs of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, and it cannot be ruled out that latrines could contribute to viral transmission in rural settings. Frequent disinfection of latrines should be recommended to reduce the likelihood of fecal contamination.","Del Brutto, Oscar H; Costa, Aldo F; Mera, Robertino M; Andrade-Molina, Derly; Recalde, Bettsy Y; García, Héctor H; Fernández-Cadena, Juan C",Am. j. trop. med. hyg,,360
290131,"A Case Study on the Particularities and Sustainability of the Concepts of TQM, Quality Control, and Risk Management in the Corporate Insurance Industry: Loss and the Incidence of Catastrophic Risks",2020,"The aim of this study is to examine the use of an inflammasome competitor as a preventative agent. Coronaviruses have zoonotic potential due to the adaptability of their S protein to bind receptors of other species, most notably demonstrated by SARS-CoV. The binding of SARS-CoV-2 to TLR (Toll-like receptor) causes the release of pro-IL-1ß, which is cleaved by caspase-1, followed by the formation and activation of the inflammasome, which is a mediator of lung inflammation, fever, and fibrosis. The NLRP3 (NACHT, LRR and PYD domains-containing protein 3) inflammasome is implicated in a variety of human diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD), prion diseases, type 2 diabetes, and numerous infectious diseases. By examining the use of 4,4'-diaminodiphenyl sulfone (DDS) in the treatment of patients with Hansen's disease, also diagnosed as Alzheimer's disease, this study demonstrates the diverse mechanisms involved in the activation of inflammasomes. TLRs, due to genetic polymorphisms, can alter the immune response to a wide variety of microbial ligands, including viruses. In particular, TLR2Arg677Trp was reported to be exclusively present in Korean patients with lepromatous leprosy (LL). Previously, mutation of the intracellular domain of TLR2 has demonstrated its role in determining the susceptibility to LL, though LL was successfully treated using a combination of DDS with rifampicin and clofazimine. Of the three tested antibiotics, DDS was effective in the molecular regulation of NLRP3 inflammasome activators that are important in mild cognitive impairment (MCI), Parkinson's disease (PD), and AD. The specific targeting of NLRP3 itself or up-/downstream factors of the NLRP3 inflammasome by DDS may be responsible for its observed preventive effects, functioning as a competitor.","Lee, Jong-Hoon; An, Ha Kyeu; Sohn, Mun-Gi; Kivela, Paul; Oh, Sangsuk",,,360

291848,Training Feedforward Neural Network Using Enhanced Black Hole Algorithm: A Case Study on COVID-19 Related ACE2 Gene Expression Classification,2021,"BACKGROUND: Schwannomas are neoplasms that typically arise from the myelin sheath of peripheral nerves and rarely originate within the brain parenchyma. Some case reports present schwannomas arising from the brainstem, but regrowth of the tumor and the efficacy of postoperative irradiation have not been examined. In addition, the genetic background of schwannomas arising from the brainstem has not been investigated. CASE PRESENTATION: A 21-year-old male presented with diplopia, dysphagia, and left-sided hemiparesis, dysesthesia, and ataxia. Intracranial imaging showed a heterogeneous mass with a cystic lesion in the pontomedullary junction. Since the tumor caused obstructive hydrocephalus, the patient underwent subtotal tumor resection. A histopathologic evaluation aided a diagnosis of brainstem intraparenchymal schwannoma. Gradual postoperative mass regrowth was recognized. Three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy was performed on the residual mass and surgical cavity. No tumor regrowth was observed 4 years after surgery. To investigate the genetic background of the tumor, target sequences for 36 genes, including NF2, SMARCB1, and LZTR1, and microsatellite analysis for loss of 22q did not show any somatic variants or 22q loss. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that brainstem schwannomas might differ from conventional schwannomas in their genetic background.","Ishigami, Daiichiro; Miyawaki, Satoru; Nakatomi, Hirofumi; Takayanagi, Shunsaku; Teranishi, Yu; Ohara, Kenta; Hongo, Hiroki; Dofuku, Shogo; Kin, Taichi; Abe, Hiroyuki; Mitsui, Jun; Komura, Daisuke; Katoh, Hiroto; Ishikawa, Shumpei; Saito, Nobuhito",BMC Med Genomics,,360

However, research aiming to examine public willingness to wear (WTW) face masks in Pakistan are scarce. The current research aims to overcome this research void and contributes by expanding the theoretical mechanism of theory of planned behavior (TPB) to include three novel dimensions (risk perceptions of the pandemic, perceived benefits of face masks, and unavailability of face masks) to comprehensively analyze the factors that motivate people to, or inhibit people from, wearing face masks. The study is based on an inclusive questionnaire survey of a sample of 738 respondents in the provincial capitals of Pakistan, namely, Lahore, Peshawar, Karachi, Gilgit, and Quetta. Structural equation modeling (SEM) is used to analyze the proposed hypotheses. The results show that attitude, social norms, risk perceptions of the pandemic, and perceived benefits of face masks are the major influencing factors that positively affect public WTW face masks, whereas the cost of face masks and unavailability of face masks tend to have opposite effects. The results emphasize the need to enhance risk perceptions by publicizing the deadly effects of COVID-19 on the environment and society, ensure the availability of face masks at an affordable price, and make integrated and coherent efforts to highlight the benefits that face masks offer.","Irfan, Muhammad; Akhtar, Nadeem; Ahmad, Munir; Shahzad, Farrukh; Elavarasan, Rajvikram Madurai; Wu, Haitao; Yang, Chuxiao",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,360

294442,Introduction to the JPCC special issue: Professionalism in the Pandemic,2020,"Background: Emerging trial data for treatment of COVID-19 suggest that in addition to improved clinical outcomes, these treatments reduce length of hospital stay (LOS). However, the economic value of a shortened LOS is unclear. Objective: To estimate incremental costs per day of hospitalization for a patient with influenza or viral pneumonia, as a proxy for COVID-19; ICU costs associated with invasive mechanical ventilation (iMV) were also determined. Methods: Retrospective analysis of claims-based data was conducted using the IBM MarketScan® Commercial Claims and Encounters and Medicare Supplemental and Coordination of Care and the Medicare Fee-for-Service claims databases for hospitalizations due to influenza/viral pneumonia between January 2018 and June 2019. Cases were stratified as uncomplicated hospitalizations or with ICU. Ordinary least squares regression, excluding LOS or costs exceeding the 99th percentile (base case), was used to estimate incremental costs per day; a sensitivity analysis included all qualified hospitalizations. Additional sensitivity analyses used weighting methodology. Results: Among 6055 and 118,419 hospitalizations in the commercially insured and Medicare databases, respectively, 5958 and 116,552 hospitalizations, respectively, represented the base case. Estimated incremental base case costs per additional inpatient day were $2158 and $3900 in the commercial population for uncomplicated hospitalizations and hospitalizations with ICU, respectively, and $475 and $668, respectively in the Medicare population. Estimated incremental base case costs per additional ICU day were $5254 and $608 for Commercial and Medicare populations, respectively. Higher absolute costs were estimated in the sensitivity analysis on all qualified hospitalizations; the weighted sensitivity analyses generally showed that estimates were stable. Use of iMV increased costs by $35,482 and $13,101 in the commercial and Medicare populations, respectively. Conclusion: The incremental daily cost of a hospitalization is substantial for US patients with commercial insurance and for Medicare patients. These findings may help quantify the economic value of COVID-19 treatments that reduce LOS.","Wu, Ning; Kuznik, Andreas; Wang, Degang; Moretz, Chad; Xi, Ann; Kumar, Shambhavi; Hamilton, Laurie",Clinicoecon Outcomes Res,,360

294559,Efficiency of Covid-19 mobile contact tracing containment by measuring time dependent doubling time,2020,"The flourishing development of e-commerce technologies has fostered the rapid development of shipping e-commerce, which has a huge development potential especially in the case of the great impact of COVID-19 on the container shipping industry. Shipping e-commerce is characterized by ensuring that the transportation contract is completed on time. While in the traditional channel, shippers may not complete the contract on time due to the overselling behavior of liner companies. However, participants usually are unfamiliar with the shipping e-commerce channel, which leads to a wait-and-see attitude. Therefore, the issue of the liner slot dual-channel sales strategy is worth tackling under two sales channels, including the ES channel (shipping e-commerce platform and spot market) and CS channel (contract and spot markets). A two-stage game model considering the overselling behavior of liner companies is constructed for each channel to analyze the shipper’s ordering decision and the liner company’s pricing strategy, identifying a win-win sales channel for them. The results indicate that whether a strategy is win-win depends on the demand gap between high-and low-demand seasons, the allocated capacity under each channel, and unit compensation cost. Moreover, the impacts of some parameters on the optimal performances under the win-win strategy are analyzed. The results would be conducive to both the academic research on the contract mechanism when liner companies design shipping e-commerce platforms and the practice of container slot sales strategy selection to achieve various long-term goals.","Sun, Heying Siu Lee Lam Jasmine Zeng Qingcheng",Computers &amp; Industrial Engineering,,360

Inherent to this is the promise that advancement and transitions in training would be defined by readiness to practice rather than by time. Of the logistical problems facing competency-based, time-variable (CBTV) training, enacting time variability may be the largest hurdle to clear. Although it is true that an 'all or nothing' approach to CBTV training would require massive overhauls of both medical education and health care systems, the authors propose that training institutions should gradually evolve within their current environments to incrementally move toward the best version of CBTV training for learners, supervisors, and patients. In support of this evolution, the authors seek to demonstrate the feasibility of advancing toward the goal of realistic CBTV training by detailing examples of successful CBTV training and describing key features of initial steps toward CBTV training implementation.","Schumacher, Daniel J; Caretta-Weyer, Holly; Busari, Jamiu; Carraccio, Carol; Damodaran, Arvin; Gruppen, Larry D; Hall, Andrew K; Kinnear, Benjamin; Warm, Eric; Ten Cate, Olle",Med Teach,,360

Therefore, we monitored the time course of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration in raw sewage in the Frankfurt metropolitan area, the European financial center. To determine the SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration in sewage, we continuously collected 24 h composite samples twice a week from two wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) influents (Niederrad and Sindlingen) serving the Frankfurt metropolitan area and performed RT-qPCR analysis targeting three genes (N gene, S gene, and ORF1ab gene). In August, a resurgence in the SARS-CoV-2 RNA load was observed, reaching 3 × 1013 copies/day, which represented similar levels compared to April with approx. 2 × 1014 copies/day. This corresponds to a continuous increase again in COVID-19 cases in Frankfurt since August, with an average of 28.6 incidences, compared to 28.7 incidences in April. Different temporal dynamics were observed between different sampling points, indicating local dynamics in COVID-19 cases within the Frankfurt metropolitan area. The SARS-CoV-2 RNA load to the WWTP Niederrad ranged from approx. 4 × 1011 to 1 × 1015 copies/day, the load to the WWTP Sindlingen from approx. 1 × 1011 to 2 × 1014 copies/day, which resulted in a preceding increase in these loading in July ahead of the weekly averaged incidences. The study shows that WBE has the potential as an early warning system for SARS-CoV-2 infections and a monitoring system to identify global hotspots of COVID-19.","Agrawal, Shelesh; Orschler, Laura; Lackner, Susanne",Sci Rep,,360

A small proportion might develop severe disease and may have cytokine storm. One of the therapeutic options to treat such cases is Tocilizumab (TCZ). In this study, we present cases of severe COVID-19 treated with TCZ and glucocorticoids and discuss the treatment responses. METHODS: This is a retrospective observational study of severe COVID-19 cases treated with TCZ and glucocorticoids. The case series examined the characteristics and outcome of those patients. RESULTS: This study included 40 Severe Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) confirmed patients who received TCZ and glucocorticoids.

In this syndrome, inflammatory cytokines are released after activation of the inflammatory cascade, with the predominant role of interleukin (IL)-6. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of tocilizumab, as an IL-6 antagonist, in patients with severe or critical SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: In this prospective clinical trial, 76 patients with severe or critical SARS-CoV-2 infection were evaluated for eligibility, and ultimately, 42 patients were included. Tocilizumab was administered at a dose of 400â¯mg as a single dose via intravenous infusion. Primary outcomes included changes in oxygenation support, need for invasive mechanical ventilation, and death. Secondary outcomes included radiological changes in the lungs, IL-6 plasma levels, C-reactive protein levels, and adverse drug reactions. The data were analyzed using SPSS software. RESULTS: Of the 42 included patients, 20 (48%) patients presented the severe infection stage and 22 (52%) were in the critical stage. The median age of patients was 56â¯years, and the median IL-6 level was 28.55â¯pg/mL. After tocilizumab administration, only 6 patients (14%) required invasive ventilation. Additionally, 35 patients (83.33%) showed clinical improvement. By day 28, a total of 7 patients died (6 patients in the critical stage and 1 patient in the severe stage). Neurological adverse effects were observed in 3 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the current results, tocilizumab may be a promising agent for patients with severe or critical SARS-CoV-2 infection, if promptly initiated during the severe stage.","Dastan, Farzaneh; Saffaei, Ali; Haseli, Sara; Marjani, Majid; Moniri, Afshin; Abtahian, Zahra; Abedini, Atefeh; Kiani, Arda; Seifi, Sharareh; Jammati, Hamidreza; Hashemian, Seyed Mohammad Reza; Pourabdollah Toutkaboni, Mihan; Eslaminejad, Alireza; Heshmatnia, Jalal; Sadeghi, Mohsen; Nadji, Seyed Alireza; Dastan, Alireza; Baghaei, Parvaneh; Varahram, Mohammad; Yousefian, Sahar; Salamzadeh, Jamshid; Tabarsi, Payam",Int Immunopharmacol,,360

Despite efforts to carefully monitor the COVID-19 pandemic, the reported number of confirmed cases is likely to underestimate the actual number of infections. We aim to estimate the total number of COVID-19 infections in a straightforward manner using a demographic scaling model. This model is broadly applicable as it is based on little input data: deaths attributable to COVID-19, COVID-19 infection fatality rates, and life tables. As many countries lack reliable estimates of age-specific infection fatality rates, we map them from a reference country onto countries of interest based on remaining life expectancy. This scaling accounts for cross-country differences in the age structure, the health status, and the health care system. We also introduce easy to apply formulas to quantify the bias that would be required in death counts and infection fatality rates in order to reproduce a certain estimate of infections. Across the 10 countries with most COVID-19 deaths as of April 17, 2020, our estimates suggest that the total number of infected is approximately 4 times the number of confirmed cases. The uncertainty, however, is high, as the lower bound of the 95% prediction interval suggests on average twice as many infections than confirmed cases, and the upper bound 10 times as many. Comparing our results with findings from local seroprevalence studies and applying our bias formulas shows that some of their infection estimates would only be possible if just a small fraction of COVID-19 related deaths were recorded, indicating that these seroprevalence estimates might not be representative for the total population.","Bohk-Ewald, Christina; Dudel, Christian; Myrskyla, Mikko",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.12836v1.pdf,360

299651,Virtual world as an interactive safety training platform,2021,"We investigate the visual cross-embodiment imitation setting, in which agents learn policies from videos of other agents (such as humans) demonstrating the same task, but with stark differences in their embodiments -- shape, actions, end-effector dynamics, etc. In this work, we demonstrate that it is possible to automatically discover and learn vision-based reward functions from cross-embodiment demonstration videos that are robust to these differences. Specifically, we present a self-supervised method for Cross-embodiment Inverse Reinforcement Learning (XIRL) that leverages temporal cycle-consistency constraints to learn deep visual embeddings that capture task progression from offline videos of demonstrations across multiple expert agents, each performing the same task differently due to embodiment differences. Prior to our work, producing rewards from self-supervised embeddings typically required alignment with a reference trajectory, which may be difficult to acquire under stark embodiment differences. We show empirically that if the embeddings are aware of task progress, simply taking the negative distance between the current state and goal state in the learned embedding space is useful as a reward for training policies with reinforcement learning. We find our learned reward function not only works for embodiments seen during training, but also generalizes to entirely new embodiments. Additionally, when transferring real-world human demonstrations to a simulated robot, we find that XIRL is more sample efficient than current best methods.

METHODS: The COVID-19 Psychological Research Consortium (C19PRC) Study is a longitudinal, nationally representative, online survey of UK adults. The current study analysed data from its first three waves of data collection: Wave 1 (March 2020, N = 2025), Wave 2 (April 2020, N = 1406) and Wave 3 (July 2020, N = 1166). Anxiety-depression was measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire Anxiety and Depression Scale (a composite measure of the PHQ-9 and GAD-7) and COVID-19-related posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with the International Trauma Questionnaire. Changes in mental health outcomes were modelled across the three waves. Latent class growth analysis was used to identify subgroups of individuals with different trajectories of change in anxiety-depression and COVID-19 PTSD. Latent class membership was regressed on baseline characteristics. RESULTS: Overall prevalence of anxiety-depression remained stable, while COVID-19 PTSD reduced between Waves 2 and 3. Heterogeneity in mental health response was found, and hypothesised classes reflecting (i) stability, (ii) improvement and (iii) deterioration in mental health were identified. Psychological factors were most likely to differentiate the improving, deteriorating and high-stable classes from the low-stable mental health trajectories. CONCLUSIONS: A low-stable profile characterised by little-to-no psychological distress ('resilient' class) was the most common trajectory for both anxiety-depression and COVID-19 PTSD. Monitoring these trajectories is necessary moving forward, in particular for the ~30% of individuals with increasing anxiety-depression levels.","Shevlin, Mark; Butter, Sarah; McBride, Orla; Murphy, Jamie; Gibson-Miller, Jilly; Hartman, Todd K; Levita, Liat; Mason, Liam; Martinez, Anton P; McKay, Ryan; Stocks, Thomas V A; Bennett, Kate; Hyland, Philip; Bentall, Richard P",Psychol Med,,360

METHODS: We developed and validated a multivariable logistic regression model for in-hospital clinical deterioration (defined as any requirement of ventilatory support or critical care, or death) among consecutively hospitalised adults with highly suspected or confirmed COVID-19 who were prospectively recruited to the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infections Consortium Coronavirus Clinical Characterisation Consortium (ISARIC4C) study across 260 hospitals in England, Scotland, and Wales. Candidate predictors that were specified a priori were considered for inclusion in the model on the basis of previous prognostic scores and emerging literature describing routinely measured biomarkers associated with COVID-19 prognosis. We used internal-external cross-validation to evaluate discrimination, calibration, and clinical utility across eight National Health Service (NHS) regions in the development cohort. We further validated the final model in held-out data from an additional NHS region (London). FINDINGS: 74â944 participants (recruited between Feb 6 and Aug 26, 2020) were included, of whom 31â924 (43·2%) of 73â948 with available outcomes met the composite clinical deterioration outcome. In internal-external cross-validation in the development cohort of 66â705 participants, the selected model (comprising 11 predictors routinely measured at the point of hospital admission) showed consistent discrimination, calibration, and clinical utility across all eight NHS regions. In held-out data from London (n=8239), the model showed a similarly consistent performance (C-statistic 0·77 [95% CI 0·76 to 0·78]; calibration-in-the-large 0·00 [-0·05 to 0·05]); calibration slope 0·96 [0·91 to 1·01]), and greater net benefit than any other reproducible prognostic model.

The main objective of the study is to analyze whether HT represents an independent risk factor for death as a hard endpoint in patients hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 in Spain Design and method: Cross-sectional, observational, retrospective multicenter study, analyzing 12226 patients who required hospital admission in 150 Spanish centers included in the nationwide SEMI-COVID-19 Network. We compared the clinical characteristics of survivors versus non-survivors Results: The mean age of the study population was 67.5 ± 16.1 years, 42.6% were women. Overall, 2630 (21.5%) subjects died. The most common comorbidity was hypertension (50.9%) followed by diabetes (19.1%), and atrial fibrillation (11.2%). Multivariate analysis showed that after adjusting for gender (males OR: 1.5, p = 0.0001), age tertiles (second and third tertiles, OR: 2.0 and 4.7, p = 0.0001), and Charlson Comorbidity Index scores (second and third tertiles OR: 4.7 and 8.1, p = 0.0001), hypertension was signi ficantly predictive of allcause mortality when this comorbidity was treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) (OR: 1.6, p = 0.002) or other than renin-angiotensinaldosterone blockers (OR: 1.3, p = 0.001) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) (OR: 1.2, p = 0.035) Conclusions: The preexisting condition of hypertension had an independent prognostic value for all-cause mortality in patients with COVID-19 who required hospitalization.

Repurposing existing medications may offer the best hope for treating COVID 19 patients to curb the pandemic. IMU-838 is a dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) inhibitor, which is an effective mechanism for antiviral effects against respiratory viruses. When used synergistically with Oseltamivir, therapeutic effects have been observed against influenza and SARS-CoV-2 in rodents.(13) The IONIC trial is a randomized control trial that will investigate whether time to clinical improvement in COVID 19 patients is improved following a 14 day course of IMU-838 + Oseltamivir versus Oseltamivir alone. MethodsIONIC trial is an open label study in which participants will be randomised 1:1 in two parallel arms; the intervention arm (IMU-838 + Oseltamivir) and control arm (Oseltamivir only). The primary outcome is time-to-clinical improvement; defined as the time from randomisation to: a 2-point improvement on WHO ordinal scale; discharge from hospital, or death (whichever occurs first). The study is sponsored by UHCW NHS Trust and funded by LifeArc. DiscussionThe IONIC Protocol describes an overarching trial design to provide reliable evidence on the efficacy of IMU-838 (vidofludimus calcium) when delivered in combination with an antiviral therapy (Oseltamivir) [IONIC Intervention] for confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection in adult patients receiving usual standard of care. Trial RegistrationThe trial was registered with EudraCT (2020-001805-21) on 09.04.2020 and ISRCTN on 23.09.2020 (ISRCTN53038326) and Clinicaltrials.gov on 17.08.2020 (NCT04516915) Strengths and LimitationsThis study is the first to recruit participants in the trial exploring the effectiveness of IMU-838 in COVID-19. In addition, we believe it is the only trial exploring the effectiveness of IMU-838 in combination with Oseltamivir (Tamiflu) in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19. However, to make the trial design flexible due to the on-going pandemic the trial is un-blinded.","Sharma, Kavi; Berry, Dr Lisa; Vryonis, Dr Evangelos; Ali, Dr Asad; Lara, Dr Beatriz; Noufaily, Dr Angela; Parsons, Dr Nick; Bradley, Christopher James; Haley, Becky; Tabuso, Maria; Arasaradnam, Professor Ramesh",,,360

303401,Situating ‘careful surveillance’,2021,"Wearing face masks has become the new normal worldwide due to the global spread of the coronavirus disease 2019. The inhalation of microplastics due to the wearing of masks has rarely been reported. The present study used different types of commonly used masks to conduct breathing simulation experiments and investigate microplastic inhalation risk. Microplastic inhalation caused by reusing masks that underwent various treatment processes was also tested. Results implied that wearing masks considerably reduces the inhalation risk of particles (e.g., granular microplastics and unknown particles) even when they are worn continuously for 720 h. Surgical, cotton, fashion, and activated carbon masks wearing pose higher fiber-like microplastic inhalation risk, while all masks generally reduced exposure when used under their supposed time (<4 h). N95 poses less fiber-like microplastic inhalation risk. Reusing masks after they underwent different disinfection pretreatment processes can increase the risk of particle (e.g., granular microplastics) and fiber-like microplastic inhalation. Ultraviolet disinfection exerts a relatively weak effect on fiber-like microplastic inhalation, and thus, it can be recommended as a treatment process for reusing masks if proven effective from microbiological standpoint. Wearing an N95 mask reduces the inhalation risk of spherical-type microplastics by 25.5 times compared with not wearing a mask.","Li, Lu; Zhao, Xiaoli; Li, Zhouyang; Song, Kang",J Hazard Mater,,360
303716,Prediction of COVID-19 Severity Using Chest Computed Tomography and Laboratory Measurements: Evaluation Using a Machine Learning Approach,2020,"BACKGROUND: Leading scientific societies have recommended delaying and/or suspending active cancer treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic. Nevertheless, data on this novel infection in patients with a diagnosis of cancer receiving active treatment are scarce and it is unknown if these recommendations could have repercussions on future progress of the disease. The main objective of this study is to learn the COVID-19 incidence rate in outpatients with cancer receiving active treatment. METHODS: This work is a retrospective cohort study that included all patients with a diagnosis of cancer who received active cancer treatment in two Andalusian hospitals between February 26 and May 13, 2020. Variables regarding the patient, tumor, and development of COVID-19 were collected. A descriptive analysis was performed and the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in these patients was evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 673 patients were included. The median age was 62 years. There was a low rate of comorbidity and 12.1% had an ECOG >2. Breast cancer was the most common cancer (41%), followed by colorectal and lung cancer. Stage IV cancer was reported in 52.7% of patients. The most common treatment was chemotherapy (53.9%). Treatment was delayed or suspended in 6% of patients. Only three patients developed COVID-19. The cumulative incidence was 0.44% and one person died due to infection. CONCLUSIONS: In the present retrospective cohort study we found a low incidence of COVID-19 infection in patients with cancer receiving active treatment in an outpatient setting. The sociodemographic factors of Andalusia may explain why these results differ from those presented by other colleagues in Spain, but raise questions about whether universal recommendations may put the benefits of antineoplastic therapy at risk.","Martín-Bravo, Celia; Quirós, Raúl; Blancas, Isabel; Villatoro-Roldán, Rosa; Robles, Marta; Alcaide, Julia; Navarro, Víctor; Pérez, Diego; Zarcos, Irene; Rivas-Ruiz, Francisco; Pérez-Ruiz, Elisabeth; Quero, Cristina",Semin. oncol,,360

304327,Giving Up Privacy For Security: A Survey On Privacy Trade-off During Pandemic Emergency,2020-07-01,"Background COVID-19 vaccines have been approved and made available. While questions of vaccine allocation strategies have received significant attention, important questions remain regarding the potential impact of the vaccine given uncertainties regarding efficacy against transmission, availability, timing, and durability. Methods We adapted a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model to examine the potential impact on hospitalization and mortality assuming increasing rates of vaccine efficacy, coverage, and administration. We also evaluated the uncertainty of the vaccine to prevent infectiousness as well as the impact on outcomes based on the timing of distribution and the potential effects of waning immunity. Findings Increased vaccine efficacy against disease reduces hospitalizations and deaths from COVID-19;however, the relative benefit of transmission blocking varied depending on the timing of vaccine distribution. Early in an outbreak, a vaccine that reduces transmission will be relatively more effective than one introduced later in the outbreak. In addition, earlier and accelerated implementation of a less effective vaccine is more impactful than later implementation of a more effective vaccine. These findings are magnified when considering the durability of the vaccine. Vaccination in the spring will be less impactful when immunity is less durable. Interpretation Policy choices regarding non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as social distancing and face mask use, will need to remain in place longer if the vaccine is less effective at reducing transmission or distributed slower. In addition, the stage of the local outbreak greatly impacts the overall effectiveness of the vaccine in a region and should be considered when allocating vaccines.

304785,"COVID-19, supply chain disruption and China's hog market: a dynamic analysis",2020,"Hypoxia is defined by low oxygen concentration in organs, tissues and cells. Maintaining oxygen homeostasis represents the essential cellular metabolic process for the structural integrity of tissues in different pathological conditions, including SARS-CoV-2 infection. Considering the role of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) as regulator of cellular response to hypoxia and its involvement in angiogenesis, erythropoiesis, glucose metabolism, inflammation, we propose hypoxic preconditiong (HPC) as a novel prevention therapeutic approach on healthy contacts of COVID-19 patients. To date, several studies revealed the benefic effects of hypoxic preconditioning in ischemia, kidney failure and in pulmonary function recovery of lung surgery patients. HPC increases the expression of factors that promote cell survival and angiogenesis, induces an anti-inflammatory outcome, triggers coordinated hypoxia responses that promote erythropoiesis, and mobilizes the circulating progenitor cells. Futhermore, the mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) exposed to HPC show improvement of their regenerative capacities, and increases the effectiveness of stem cell therapy in different pathologies, including COVID-19. In conclusion, HPC should be considered an approach with beneficial outcomes and without significant side effects when the organism is severely exposed to the same stressor. HPC appears as a trigger to mechanisms that improve and maintain tissue oxygenation and repair, a main goal in different pathologies, including COVID-19 or other respiratory conditions.","Hertzog, Radu Gabriel; Bicheru, Nicoleta Simona; Popescu, Diana Mihaela; Calborean, Octavian; Catrina, Ana-Maria",Int. j. infect. dis,,360

The COVID-19 outbreak arrived in Greece on 26 February 2020, at the time that Athens had declared a state of emergency at the Greek/Turkish border. From this point in time the government enforced a series of measurements, aiming to contain the epidemic and avoid the collapse of the healthcare system. The vast majority of the general population complied to the measures and consequently Greece's death toll was low.

Studies using digital data sources show that the mobility of individuals was effectively reduced in multiple countries. However, it remains unclear whether these reductions caused deeper structural changes in mobility networks, and how such changes may affect dynamic processes on the network. Here we use movement data of mobile phone users to show that mobility in Germany has not only been reduced considerably: Lockdown measures caused substantial and lasting structural changes in the mobility network. We find that long-distance travel was reduced disproportionately strongly. The trimming of long-range network connectivity leads to a more local, clustered network and a moderation of the""small-world""effect. We demonstrate that these structural changes have a considerable effect on epidemic spreading processes by""flattening""the epidemic curve and delaying the spread to geographically distant regions.","Schlosser, Frank; Maier, Benjamin F.; Hinrichs, David; Zachariae, Adrian; Brockmann, Dirk",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.01583v2.pdf,360

306792,Problematizing the Global: An Introduction to Global Culture Revisited,2020,"Coronaviruses (CoVs) assemble by budding into the lumen of the intermediate compartment (IC) at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi interface. However, why CoVs have chosen the IC as their intracellular site of assembly and how progeny viruses are delivered from this compartment to the extracellular space has remained unclear. Here we address these enigmatic late events of the CoV life cycle in light of recently described properties of the IC. Of particular interest are the emerging spatial and functional connections between IC elements and recycling endosomes (REs), defined by the GTPases Rab1 and Rab11, respectively. The establishment of IC-RE links at the cell periphery, around the centrosome and evidently also at the noncompact zones of the Golgi ribbon indicates that-besides traditional ER-Golgi communication-the IC also promotes a secretory process that bypasses the Golgi stacks, but involves its direct connection with the endocytic recycling system. The initial confinement of CoVs to the lumen of IC-derived large transport carriers and their preferential absence from Golgi stacks is consistent with the idea that they exit cells following such an unconventional route. In fact, CoVs may share this pathway with other intracellularly budding viruses, lipoproteins, procollagen, and/or protein aggregates experimentally introduced into the IC lumen.","Saraste, Jaakko; Prydz, Kristian",,,360

In German-speaking countries, research investigating spiritual care in nursing teaching and nursing practice is limited. The aim of this study was to measure nursing students' perceptions of their spiritual care competencies, care attitudes, involvement, perception and well-being. Three groups of second-year undergraduate nursing students in the years 2018, 2019 and 2020 participated in a cross-sectional study using validated scales to measure students' spiritual well-being (JAREL), spiritual care attitudes and involvement (SAIL), spirituality and spiritual care perceptions (SSCRS), and competencies (SCCS). Nursing students (N = 191) show a high level of spiritual attitude and involvement. The groups attained similar scores on the SSCRS, but the group of 2020 achieved the highest score, indicating a broader view of spirituality. This group also scored highest on the SCCS, which shows a higher self-perceived competence in delivering spiritual care. At the same time, the 2020 group reported significantly low spiritual well-being scores. Students rated their competencies in delivering spiritual care as high. This may be negatively affected if their spiritual well-being remains low.

307416,The People Still Make the (Remote Work-) Place: Lessons from a Pandemic,2021,"INTRODUCTION: To date, there are no effective treatments for decreasing hospitalizations in Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infections. It has been suggested that the influenza vaccine might attenuate the severity of COVID-19. METHODS: This is a retrospective single-centered cohort review of a de-identified database of 2005 patients over the age of 18 within the University of Florida health care system who tested positive for COVID-19. Comorbidities and influenza vaccination status were examined. The primary outcome was severity of disease as reflected by hospitalization and intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Logistic regression was performed to examine the relationship between influenza status and hospitalization. RESULTS: COVID-19-positive patients who had not received the influenza vaccination within the last year had a 2.44 (95% CI, 1.68, 3.61) greater odds of hospitalization and a 3.29 (95% CI, 1.18, 13.77) greater odds of ICU admission when compared with those who were vaccinated. These results were controlled to account for age, race, gender, hypertension, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, obesity, coronary artery disease, and congestive heart failure. DISCUSSION: Our analysis suggests that the influenza vaccination is potentially protective of moderate and severe cases of COVID-19 infection. This protective effect holds regardless of comorbidity. The literature points to a potential mechanism via natural killer cell activation. Though our data potentially is limited by its generalizability and our vaccination rate is low, it holds significant relevance given the upcoming influenza season. Not only could simply encouraging influenza vaccination decrease morbidity and mortality from the flu, but it might help flatten the curve of the COVID-19 pandemic as well. We encourage further studies into this finding.","Yang, Ming-Jim; Rooks, Benjamin J; Le, Thanh-Tam Thi; Santiago, Inocente O; Diamond, Jeffrey; Dorsey, Nicholas L; Mainous, Arch G",J Am Board Fam Med,,360

Emergence of new genotypes of SARS-CoV during the last few years has pointed out the limited efficacy of available vaccines and antivirals, constraining the global response to the COVID-19 outburst to largely monitoring/containment. There is high priority for treatment regimes and new potential therapeutic and vaccine strategies. Several candidates have shown promising outcomes in various in vitro and in vivo models. In addition, clinical trials are in progress to test conceivable therapies showing promising outcomes in various in vivo studies. Unfortunately, very little information is available in the scientific scope which offers details to the diverse strategies being targeted to fight the pandemic, particularly with respect to the molecular targets. This review article summarizes and highlights the ongoing advances and approaches that are being carried out across the globe in designing vaccines and novel therapeutics, with particular reference to the previous knowledge gained from other viral infections like with the earlier SARS and MERS-CoV.

METHODS: A retrospective study was performed analyzing claims data from a large German Hospital network during the COVID-19 outbreak (study period: March 13-May 21, 2020) as compared to periods directly before the outbreak (same year control: January 1-March 12, 2020) and one year earlier (previous year control: March 13-May 21, 2019). RESULTS: A total of 13,151 emergency hospital admissions for psychiatric diagnoses were included in the analysis. For all psychiatric diagnoses combined, emergency admissions significantly decreased during the study period with mean (interquartile range) incidence rate ratios (IRRs) of 0.68 (0.65, 0.71) and 0.70 (0.67, 0.73) as compared to the same and previous year controls, respectively (both p < 0.00001). IRR ranged from 0.56 for mood affective disorders (F30-F39) to 0.75 for mental disorders due to psychoactive substance use (F10-F19; all p < 0.00001). Mean (standard deviation) length of hospital stay for all psychiatric diagnoses was significantly shorter during the study period [9.8 (11.6) days] as compared to same [14.7 (18.7) days] and previous [16.4 (23.9) days] year controls (both p < 0.00001). CONCLUSION: Both emergency hospital admissions and length of hospital stay significantly decreased for psychiatric disorders during the COVID-19 outbreak.

The control on the transmission of the virus is highly desired, even though several key measures have already been made, including masks, sanitizing and disinfecting measures. The ongoing research, though devoted to this pandemic, has certain flaws, due to which no permanent solution has been discovered. Currently different data based studies have emerged but unfortunately, the pandemic fate is still unrevealed. During this research, we have focused on a compartmental model, where delay is taken into account from one compartment to another. The model depicts the dynamics of the disease relative to time and constant delays in time. A deep learning technique called ""Self Organizing Map"" is used to extract the parametric values from the data repository of COVID-19.

In this paper, we examine how countries within the European Union and the United Kingdom responded to challenges brought by the COVID-19 crisis in terms of access to abortion. By combining information from various sources, we have explored different responses according to two dimensions: changes in policy and protocols, and reported difficulties in access. Our analysis shows significant differences across the observed regions and salient debates around abortion. While some countries made efforts to maintain and facilitate abortion care during the pandemic through the introduction or expansion of use of telemedicine and early medical abortion, others attempted to restrict it further.

This area has faced numerous challenges, including the shortage of frequent-use products (hydroalcoholic solutions, lopinavir/ritonavir suspension), the use of new preparations for SARS-CoV-2 (tocilizumab, remdesivir), or requests from overwhelmed wards unable to assume the safe preparation of a high volume of medications (intravenous solutions). The demand for all types of preparations (topic and oral medications, intravenous solutions) has increased dramatically. This increase has highlighted the shortage of resources allocated to this area, which has made it difficult to meet the high demand for preparations. In addition, the pandemic has revealed the scarcity of research on such basic aspects as agent stability and drug compatibility. One of the most relevant conclusions drawn from the COVID-19 pandemic is that the basic areas of hospital pharmacy, along with other, must be maintained and reinforced, as these are the areas that make us essential.","Alonso-Herreros, José María; Berisa-Prado, Silvia; Cañete-Ramírez, Carme; Dávila-Pousa, Carmen; Flox-Benítez, María Del Pilar; Ladrón de Guevara-García, Margarita; López-Cabezas, Carmen; Martín de Rosales-Cabrera, Ana María; Ramos-Martínez, Beatriz",Farm Hosp,,360

Disruption in care may be a barrier to identifying COVID-19 associated sequelae, such as mental health symptoms, among the immunocompromised. Our objectives were to evaluate COVID-19-related preventive behaviors, with a focus on canceling doctor's appointments as a proxy for continuity of care, and to compare COVID-19-related mental health symptoms among the immunocompromised with the general population. We used nationally-representative data of 10,760 U.S. adults from the publicly-available COVID-19 Household Impact Survey. We defined immunocompromised as adults with a self-reported diagnosis of ""a compromised immune system"" (n = 854, 7.6%). We adherence to self-reported COVID-19 preventive behaviors among immunocompromised adults to others using &#967;2-tests. We focused on continuity of care and estimated determinants of canceling doctor's appointments among the immunocompromised using multivariable Poisson regression to estimate adjusted prevalence ratios (aPRs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). We evaluated associations of mental health symptoms with being immunocompromised using multinomial logistic regression and estimated conditional odds ratios (cOR) with 95% CIs. Immunocompromised adults were more likely to adhere to recommended COVID-19 preventive behaviors, including washing or sanitizing hands (96.3% vs. 89.8%, &#967;2 <0.001), maintaining social distance (91.9% vs. 83.7%, &#967;2 <0.001), and canceling a doctor's appointment (47.1% vs. 29.7%, &#967;2 <0.001). Hispanic immunocompromised adults (aPR: 1.47, 95% CI: 1.12-1.92) and immunocompromised women (aPR: 1.25, 95% CI: 1.00-1.56) were more likely to cancel doctor's appointments compared to non-Hispanic White immunocompromised adults and men, respectively. Immunocompromised adults reported higher odds of feeling nervous/anxious/on edge (cOR: 1.89, 95% CI: 1.44-2.51), depressed (cOR: 2.81, 95% CI: 2.17-3.64), lonely (cOR: 2.28, 95% CI: 1.74-2.98), and hopeless (cOR: 2.86, 95% CI: 2.21-3.69) 3-7 days in the last week. Immunocompromised adults were more likely to cancel their doctor's appointments and report COVID19-related mental health symptoms. The continuity of care of immunocompromised adults should be prioritized through alternative interventions, such as telehealth.","Islam, Jessica Yasmine; Vidot, Denise Christina; Havanur, Amoghvarsha; Camacho-Rivera, Marlene",AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses,,360

Herein, we evaluated the presence of rheumatic, thyroid and phospholipid autoantibodies in sera samples from 120 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in comparison to pre-pandemic samples from 100 healthy individuals. In addition, to estimate the frequency of these autoantibodies in COVID-19, a meta-analysis of selected articles was conducted. Hospitalized patients with COVID-19 displayed latent autoimmunity mainly mediated by a high frequency of anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies, rheumatoid factor (RF), anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide third generation antibodies, antinuclear antibodies (ANAs), IgM ß2-glycoprotein I (ß2GP1) and IgM anti-cardiolipin antibodies. The meta-analysis confirmed our results, being RF and ANAs the most common autoantibodies. In addition, cluster analysis revealed that those patients with high positivity for RF, IgM ß2GP1 antibodies and ANAs had a longer hospital stay, required more vasopressors during hospitalization, and were more likely to develop critical disease. These data suggest that latent autoimmunity influences the severity of COVID-19, and support further post-COVID studies in order to evaluate the development of overt autoimmunity.","Anaya, Juan-Manuel; Monsalve, Diana M; Rojas, Manuel; Rodríguez, Yhojan; Montoya-García, Norma; Mancera-Navarro, Laura Milena; Villadiego-Santana, Ana María; Rodríguez-Leguizamón, Giovanni; Acosta-Ampudia, Yeny; Ramírez-Santana, Carolina",J Transl Autoimmun,,360
314455,The end of Afropessimism and their-story: Rastafari as ethos,2020,"Introduction: following the declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic on 11 March 2020, countries started implementing strict control measures, health workers were re-deployed and health facilities re-purposed to assist COVID-19 control efforts. These measures, along with the public concerns of getting COVID-19, led to a decline in the utilization of regular health services including immunization. Methods: we reviewed the administrative routine immunization data from 15 African countries for the period from January 2018 to June 2020 to analyze the trends in the monthly number of children vaccinated with specific antigens, and compare the changes in the first three months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: thirteen of the 15 countries showed a decline in the monthly average number of vaccine doses provided, with 6 countries having more than 10% decline. Nine countries had a lower monthly mean of recipients of first dose measles vaccination in the second quarter of 2020 as compared to the first quarter. Guinea, Nigeria, Ghana, Angola, Gabon, and South Sudan experienced a drop in the monthly number of children vaccinated for DPT3 and/or MCV1 of greater than 2 standard deviations at some point in the second quarter of 2020 as compared to the mean for the months January-June of 2018 and 2019. Conclusion: countries with lower immunization coverage in the pre-COVID period experienced larger declines in the number of children vaccinated immediately after the COVID-19 pandemic was declared. Prolonged and significant reduction in the number of children vaccinated poses a serious risk for outbreaks such as measles. Countries should monitor coverage trends at national and subnational levels, and undertake catch-up vaccination activities to ensure that children who have missed scheduled vaccines receive them at the earliest possible time.","Masresha, Balcha Girma; Luce, Richard; Shibeshi, Messeret Eshetu; Ntsama, Bernard; N039,; Diaye, Abubacar; Chakauya, Jethro; Poy, Alain; Mihigo, Richard",Pan Afr Med J,,360

According to the current studies, numerous diseases including lung disease, cardiovascular disease and immunosuppression appear to be at higher risk for severe forms of the COVID-19. To date, there are no data in the literature on the comorbid dermatologic diseases and COVID-19. We tried to analyze the previous dermatological comorbidity of 93 patients with COVID-19 (51 males, 42 females) who presented to the dermatology outpatient clinics for the last 3 years. The most common dermatologic diseases in patients with COVID-19 who have dermatologic diseases for the last 3 years were superficial fungal infections (24, 25.8%), seborrheic dermatitis (11, 11.8%), actinic keratosis (10, 10.8%), psoriasis (6, 6.5%), and eczema (6, 6.5%), respectively. In addition, the number of COVID-19 patients who presented to dermatology in the last 3 months was 17 (11 men, 6 women). The median age of these patients was 58 (minimum 18, maximum 80) years, and the most common dermatologic diseases before diagnosed COVID-19 were superficial fungal infections (5, 25%), psoriasis (4, 20%), and viral skin diseases (3, 15%). The possible similarity between cutaneous and mucosal immunity and immunosuppression suggests that patients with some dermatologic diseases especially superficial fungal infections and psoriasis may be more vulnerable to the COVID-19.","Kutlu, Ömer; Metin, Ahmet",Dermatol Ther,,360

Tripterygium wilfordii hook f (TwHF) is a traditional Chinese herb with anti-inflammatory effect, and 1.0âmg/(kg·d) dose of Tripterygium glycosides has been reported to significantly improve the disease activity of a SAPHO patient in a case report. However, the optimal dose of TwHF is still unclear. Here, we report the first case of SAPHO patient who achieved rapid remission in clinical symptoms after receiving 1.5âmg/(kg·d) dose of Tripterygium glycosides treatment. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 67-year-old woman noted palmoplantar pustulosis and pain in the anterior chest wall and waist. Bone scintigraphy demonstrated the typical tracer accumulation feature and magnetic resonance images showed bone marrow edema in lumbosacral vertebra. DIAGNOSES: The diagnosis was made by dermatological and osteoarticular manifestations and classical signs in bone scintigraphy in accordance with the diagnostic criteria proposed in 2012. INTERVENTIONS: Tripterygium glycosides was given with a primary dose of 1.5âmg/(kg·d) for 1 month and then reduced at a rate of 10âmg every 2 weeks until 1.0âmg/(kg·d) for a long-term maintenance. OUTCOMES: Fast-induced remission on clinical manifestations was achieved and magnetic resonance imaging abnormality was improved significantly. Additionally, no apparent side effects were observed. LESSONS: 1.5âmg/(kg·d) dose of Tripterygium glycosides seems to have fast-induced remission than 1.0âmg/(kg·d) with reliable safety. Besides, Tripterygium glycosides may also have a pharmacological effect of inhibiting osteolysis and enhancing bone strength.","Gong, Liang; Wang, Lun; Cao, Yihan; Li, Chen",Medicine (Baltimore),,360
315663,Digital Citizenship and Digital Communities: How Technology Matters for Individuals and Communities,2021,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The international, public health crisis caused by the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in unforeseen medical and psychiatric consequences. We reviewed publications from January 2020 to January 2021, given that earlier documents were not relevant, to review findings on changes in substance use and overdoses during the pandemic. Additionally, this review of the literature also documents advocacy efforts, health service modification and challenges, as well as COVID-related health complications associated with substance use. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent work focused on identifying changes in the distribution and use of substances as well as the unique challenges to promoting the health of persons who use substances in the current pandemic. Although COVID-19 has triggered unprecedented innovations in the organizational and public policy, the use of certain substances (alcohol, cannabis, cigarettes, fentanyl, heroin, and opiates) is increasing internationally. Unique associations between substance use and pandemic-related adverse health outcomes were identified. In addition, the pandemic precipitated significant barriers and disruptions to care. SUMMARY: Given increased overdose rates and infections among people who use drugs, continued surveillance and vigilance are needed to assess changes and reduce use and adverse consequences during the continuing COVID-19 crisis. Changes are urgently needed to reduce adverse health outcomes because of treatment barriers and lack of adequate treatment options. Additionally, integrative approaches are necessary to promote the public health of persons who use substances.","Striley, Catherine W; Hoeflich, Carolin C",Curr Opin Psychiatry,,360

Substantial progress has been made; so, a question that stakeholders ask is: Is veteran homelessness still a problem? METHODS: To answer this question, 2 different data sources were analyzed in 2020: (1) a nationally representative community survey of 4,069 veterans conducted in 2019 and (2) national administrative data from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs on >6 million healthcare and homeless services in 2019. RESULTS: In the community sample, the lifetime prevalence of adult homelessness was 10.2%, with the highest prevalence found in participants aged 30-44 years (19.9% prevalence). In the Veterans Affairs administrative data, 4.2% of all Veterans Affairs service users used homeless services (n=290,515 Veterans Affairs homeless services); 27.9% of these were first-time Veterans Affairs homeless service users. Veterans who were racial/ethnic minorities were more likely to report any lifetime adult homelessness, more likely to be identified as homeless in Veterans Affairs records, and more likely to have used any Veterans Affairs homeless program. There was no sex difference in the lifetime prevalence of homelessness, but Veterans Affairs records showed that male veterans were more likely to be identified as homeless and to use homeless programs, suggesting possible underidentification of female veteran homelessness. Across age, sex, and racial/ethnic groups, 35.1% of Veterans Affairs homeless service users used emergency department services in the same year. CONCLUSIONS: There is a continued need to dedicate resources to address veteran homelessness across sociodemographic groups, and these data serve as a benchmark before and after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Tsai, Jack; Pietrzak, Robert H; Szymkowiak, Dorota",Am. j. prev. med,,360

In this scoping review, we aimed to describe factors that contributed to the spread and mortality of COVID-19 in nursing homes and provide an overview of responses that were implemented to try to overcome such challenges. METHODS: The MeSH terms ""Nursing homes"" and ""COVID-19"" were searched in MEDLINE Ovid, and English language articles were retrieved that were published between 1 March 2020 and 31 January 2021. Article titles and abstracts were screened by two reviewers, and the results of included articles were grouped by themes. RESULTS: The search retrieved 348 articles, of which 76 were included in the thematic review. 8 articles related to COVID-19 disease characteristics (e.g. asymptomatic transmission), 24 to resident-related factors (e.g. comorbidities, nutrition, cognition), 13 to facility characteristics (e.g. physical space, occupancy, for-profit status), 21 to staffing (e.g. staffing levels, staff-to-resident ratio, staff multi-employment), and 10 to external factors (e.g. availability of personal protective equipment, prevailing health and social care policies). In terms of responses, identified themes included widespread testing, isolation and cohorting of residents, staff protection and support, promotion of residents' well-being, and technological innovations. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 exerted severe challenges on the nursing home population and its staff. Both internal and external factors predisposed nursing homes to an increased propensity of spread. Numerous strategies were employed to attempt to mitigate the negative impacts. Substantial learning occurred that may not only aid future pandemic preparedness but improve quality of care for nursing home residents at all times.","Giri, Shamik; Chenn, Lee Minn; Romero-Ortuno, Roman",,,360

We observed that plasma miR-4286 was associated with higher risk of ACS (adjusted odds ratio according to an interquartile range increase, 1.26 [95% CI, 1.07-1.48]). Further association analysis revealed that triglyceride was positively associated with plasma miR-4286, and an interquartile range increase in triglyceride was associated with an 11.04% (95% CI, 3.77%-18.83%) increase in plasma miR-4286. In addition, the Mendelian randomization analysis suggested a potential causal effect of triglyceride on plasma miR-4286 (ß coefficients: 0.27 [95% CI, 0.01-0.53] and 0.27 [95% CI, 0.07-0.47] separately by inverse variance-weighted and Mendelian randomization-pleiotropy residual sum and outlier tests). Moreover, the causal mediation analysis indicated that plasma miR-4286 explained 5.5% (95% CI, 0.7%-17.0%) of the association of triglyceride with incident ACS. Conclusions Higher level of plasma miR-4286 was associated with an increased risk of ACS. The upregulated miR-4286 in plasma can be attributed to higher triglyceride level and may mediate the effect of triglyceride on incident ACS.","Shen, Miaoyan; Xu, Xuedan; Liu, Xuezhen; Wang, Qiuhong; Li, Wending; You, Xiaomin; Peng, Rong; Yuan, Yu; Long, Pinpin; Niu, Rundong; Yang, Handong; Cheng, Xiang; Pan, An; Tanguay, Robert M; Zhang, Xiaomin; He, Meian; Wang, Chaolong; Liang, Liming; Wu, Tangchun",J Am Heart Assoc,,360
318806,Stand for black lives matter,2020,"BACKGROUNDAccurately identifying COVID-19 patients at-risk to deteriorate remains challenging. Tools integrating host-protein expression have proven useful in determining infection etiology and hold potential for prognosticating disease severity. METHODSAdults with COVID-19 were recruited at medical centers in Israel, Germany, and the United States. Severe outcome was defined as intensive care unit admission, non-invasive or invasive ventilation, or death. Tumor necrosis factor related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) and interferon gamma inducible protein-10 (IP-10; also known as CXCL10) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured using an analyzer providing values within 15 minutes. A signature indicating the likelihood of severe outcome was derived generating a score (0-100). Patients were assigned to 4 score bins. RESULTSBetween March and November 2020, 518 COVID-19 patients were enrolled, of whom 394 were eligible, 29% meeting a severe outcome. The signatures area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was 0.86 (95% confidence interval: 0.81-0.91). Performance was not confounded by age, sex, or comorbidities and superior to IL-6 (AUC 0.77; p = 0.033) and CRP (AUC 0.78; p < 0.001). Likelihood of severe outcome increased significantly (p < 0.001) with higher scores. The signature differentiated patients who further deteriorated after meeting a severe outcome from those who improved (p = 0.004) and projected 14-day survival probabilities (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONThe derived immune-protein signature combined with a rapid measurement platform is an accurate predictive tool for early detection of COVID-19 patients at-risk for severe outcome, facilitating timely care escalation and de-escalation and appropriate resource allocation.

In this study, we investigated 14 natural compounds isolated from Amphimedon sp. via a molecular docking study, to examine their ability to act as anti-COVID-19 agents. Moreover, the pharmacokinetic properties of the most promising compounds were studied. The docking study showed that virtually screened compounds were effective against the new coronavirus via dual inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp and the 3CL main protease. In particular, nakinadine B (1), 20-hepacosenoic acid (11) and amphimedoside C (12) were the most promising compounds, as they demonstrated good interactions with the pockets of both enzymes. Based on the analysis of the molecular docking results, compounds 1 and 12 were selected for molecular dynamics simulation studies.

319861,Acceptance and forgiveness contribution to resilience of student's affected by Covid-19,2021,"As a public health measure against COVID-19, South Africa restricted the sale of ""tobacco, e-cigarettes and related products"" for 5 months, ending on August 17, 2020. We examined marketing activities related to novel tobacco products (e-cigarettes and heated tobacco products) during this restriction. Using web scraping, we accessed data for 2661 e-cigarette liquids marketed online by South African vendors in June 2020. We also analyzed heated tobacco product volume sales (kits) using retail scanner data from Nielsen Company. The 2661 e-cigarette liquids assessed online comprised cannabidiol liquids, 28.8%[767/2661], nicotine salts, 10.4%[276/2661], e-cigarette juice concentrates, 14.1%[376/2661], nicotine-free e-liquid, 4.0%[107/2661], and nicotine-containing e-liquid, 42.6%[1135/2661]. Cannabidiol liquids had the highest percentage of fruit (78.4%[601/767]) and tobacco flavors (9.4%[72/767]). During the restriction, many online e-cigarette vendors actively promoted cannabidiol liquid in lieu of regular e-liquid. Nielsen retail scanner data showed that volume of heated tobacco product sales in February 2020, preceding the restriction (7.76 million kits), were higher than in February 2019 (4.52 million kits). The restriction saw decreased sales of heated tobacco products; mean weekly heated tobacco product sales in the 6 weeks following the restriction (772,585 kits/week) were dramatically lower versus the 6 weeks preceding the restriction (2.26 million kits/week). Lifting the restriction saw a 131% spike in sales between the latter half of August 2020 (825,638 kits) and mid-September 2020 sales (1.90 million kits), even though total sales in September 2020 were half of what was observed in the preceding year (3.81 million units in September 2020, vs 6.33 million units, September 2019). The marketing of cannabidiol and other novel products by e-cigarette manufacturers and the tobacco industry may encourage youth use; close monitoring is required.","Agaku, Israel T; Egbe, Catherine O; Ayo-Yusuf, Olalekan A",Prev Med,,360

We estimated the adverse maternal and neonatal characteristics and outcomes among COVID-19 infected women and determined heterogeneity in the estimates and associated factors. STUDY DESIGNS: PubMed search was performed of confirmed COVID-19 pregnant cases and related outcomes were ascertained prior to July 8, 2020, in this systematic review and meta-analysis. Studies reporting premature birth, low birth weight, COVID-19 infection in neonates, or mode of delivery status were included in the study. Two investigators independently performed searches, assessed quality of eligible studies as per the Cochrane handbook recommendations, extracted and reported data according to PRISMA guidelines. Pooled proportions of maternal and neonatal outcomes were estimated using meta-analyses for studies with varying sample sizes while a systematic review with descriptive data analysis was performed for case report studies. Maternal and neonatal outcomes included C-section, premature birth, low birth weight, adverse pregnancy events and COVID transmission in neonates. RESULTS: A total of 790 COVID-19 positive females and 548 neonates from 61 studies were analyzed. The rates of C-section, premature birth, low birth weight, and adverse pregnancy events were estimated as 72 %, 23 %, 7 %, and 27 % respectively. In the heterogeneity analysis, the rate of C-section was substantially higher in Chinese studies (91 %) compared to the US (40 %) or European (38 %) studies. The rates of preterm birth and adverse pregnancy events were also lowest in the US studies (12 %, 15 %) compared to Chinese (17 %, 21 %), and European studies (19 %, 19 %). In case reports, the rates of C-section, preterm birth, and low birth weight were estimated as 69 %, 56 %, and 35 %, respectively. Adverse pregnancy outcomes were associated with infection acquired at early gestational ages, more symptomatic presentation, myalgia symptom at presentation, and use of oxygen support therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Adverse pregnancy outcomes were prevalent in COVID-19 infected females and varied by location, type, and size of the studies. Regular screening and early detection of COVID-19 in pregnant women may provide more favorable outcomes.","Dubey, Pallavi; Reddy, Sireesha Y; Manuel, Sharron; Dwivedi, Alok K",Eur J Obstet Gynecol Reprod Biol,,360

The aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency and characteristics of gastrointestinal bleeding in SC-CIP. Patients with diagnosed SC-CIP were retrospectively identified and compared to a control group of patients with cardiac surgery and intensive care treatment but without the development of SC-CIP. Fifty-three patients with SC-CIP and 19 controls were included in the study. The frequency of gastrointestinal bleeding was 30% in SC-CIP (16 patients) and 5% in the control group (1 patient) (p = 0.03). Bleeding occured in the mean 13 months after admission to an intensive care unit in SC-CIP, three patients (19%) suffered bleeding during intensive care treatment. Three SC-CIP patients (19%) had cirrhosis at the time of bleeding, five (31%) had splenomegaly, and four (25%) received oral anticoagulation. In SC-CIP, 13 bleedings were identified in the upper gastrointestinal tract, two in the lower, and one remained unknown. The most common reasons for bleeding were gastroduodenal ulcers. In total, 80% of patients needed blood units, and one death due to bleeding occurred in SC-CIP. In conclusion, gastrointestinal bleeding is a frequent complication in patients with SC-CIP. Whether the liver disease itself or cofactors cause the susceptibility for bleeding remains unclear.","Blesl, Andreas Eibisberger Martin Schörghuber Michael Klivinyi Christoph Stadlbauer Vanessa",Journal of Clinical Medicine,,360
322486,Working from Home: How We Managed Our Team Remotely with Technology,2020,"Wild mammalian species, including bats, constitute the natural reservoir of betacoronavirus (including SARS, MERS, and the deadly SARS-CoV-2). Different hosts or host tissues provide different cellular environments, especially different antiviral and RNA modification activities that can alter RNA modification signatures observed in the viral RNA genome. The zinc finger antiviral protein (ZAP) binds specifically to CpG dinucleotides and recruits other proteins to degrade a variety of viral RNA genomes. Many mammalian RNA viruses have evolved CpG deficiency. Increasing CpG dinucleotides in these low-CpG viral genomes in the presence of ZAP consistently leads to decreased viral replication and virulence. Because ZAP exhibits tissue-specific expression, viruses infecting different tissues are expected to have different CpG signatures, suggesting a means to identify viral tissue-switching events. The author shows that SARS-CoV-2 has the most extreme CpG deficiency in all known betacoronavirus genomes. This suggests that SARS-CoV-2 may have evolved in a new host (or new host tissue) with high ZAP expression. A survey of CpG deficiency in viral genomes identified a virulent canine coronavirus (alphacoronavirus) as possessing the most extreme CpG deficiency, comparable with that observed in SARS-CoV-2. This suggests that the canine tissue infected by the canine coronavirus may provide a cellular environment strongly selecting against CpG. Thus, viral surveys focused on decreasing CpG in viral RNA genomes may provide important clues about the selective environments and viral defenses in the original hosts.","Xia, Xuhua",Mol Biol Evol,,360

First, social protection systems are less common in the Pacific than in the rest of the world, meaning the region is not particularly well equipped to deal with the sharp decline in economic activity associated with the disease and standard policy responses (e.g., lockdowns) without plunging a large share of the population into poverty. Second, aggressive travel restrictions and effective domestic policy responses have spared many Pacific countries from the worst impacts of COVID-19. Ten countries have not had a single confirmed case. The experience of the region thus offers helpful lessons for other developing countries in keeping the crisis at bay. Third, the relative success of Australia and New Zealand in managing the virus provides an opportunity to pilot and test in the region what a carefully managed pathway to allow the tourism, migration, and remittances, that many countries depend on, to begin flowing again. Against its relative success, the Pacific has a unique opportunity to show the world how to safely emerge from the current crisis and address underlying vulnerabilities before the next one.","Edwards, Ryan B.",World Dev.,,360
323349,Digital Innovation in Times of Emergency: Reactions from a School of Management in Italy,2020,"Despite the fact that more than a year has passed since the WHO declared the pandemic, there is still no effectivetreatment of COVID-19. According to current knowledge, the only method to stop the virus from spreading is prophylactic vaccination of the population. However, to achieve herd immunity, 60–72% of the population needs to be vaccinated, which is a significant challenge for current healthcare systems. As it has already been proven, having an effective vaccine is not the same as using it. Public acceptance is essential here. The study aimed to assess the changes in the attitudes of online respondents toward vaccination against COVID-19 over time. In the research, a questionnaire designed by the author of the study was used and it was distributed via the Internet in two stages. The questionnaire included a section assessing a sociodemographic status as well as the questions, designed by the author, evaluating the willingness of the respondents to get vaccinated and their main concerns associated with it. The first stage covered the period before the commencement of the population vaccination programme in Poland, i.e., 14–27 December 2020. Then, the survey was redistributed 2 months after the vaccination programme was started, i.e., 1–19 March 2021. Participation in the study was fully anonymous, voluntary and there was a possibility to opt out at any stage of the research. A total of 2048 respondents were surveyed and 26 persons refused to be involved in the research. A total number of 2022 responses were analysed. Stage I of the research involved 22.9% of the respondents (463 persons). The questions were answered by 1559 persons (72.9%) after the survey was redistributed. Among the participants of stage II of the study, 422 (27.1%) persons have already been vaccinated against COVID-19. A comparison of the responses that were collected from both stages of the study showed a slight increase in the willingness to get vaccinated against COVID-19 over time. It turned out that women, residents of large cities, people with a higher level of education and healthcare workers showed a more favourable attitude toward vaccination. According to the results of the survey, chronic diseases do not have a significant impact on the attitude toward vaccinations (p = 0.155). As the social vaccination promotion campaign continued, a slight increase in the willingness to get vaccinated was observed. According to the survey, women, residents of large cities and those with higher education demonstrated more favourable attitudes toward getting vaccinated against COVID-19. It should be stressed that despite the passage of time and the increasing experience with the new types of vaccines against COVID-19, the percentage of people who are afraid of the complications after the vaccination has not decreased significantly and the concern related to the ineffectiveness of vaccination has dramatically increased. This demonstrates the limited effectiveness of the current information system regarding passing the knowledge on of the safety and efficiency of vaccination and it indicates a necessity to modernise it as soon as possible.","Babicki, Mateusz Mastalerz-Migas Agnieszka",Vaccines,,360

Cancer patients are more susceptible to infection and tumor history is defined as an important factor of poor prognosis, which challenges both doctors and patients. For metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) patients, maintenance therapy is the optimal choice. The patients with tumor progression or poor biological behavior should receive or continue combination chemotherapy. Adjuvant chemotherapy should reduce the intensity of treatment and shorten the therapy time. Fever patients during chemotherapy need to receive differential diagnosis and screening according to national standards. Patients with stable diseases and good general conditions may delay imaging examination.

Pretreatment validation and monitoring of these factors during irradiation are necessary for appropriate VMAT treatment. Recently, a gantry mounted transmission detector ""Delta4 Discover® (D4D)"" was developed to detect errors in delivering doses and dose distribution immediately after treatment. In this study, the performance of D4D was evaluated. Simulation plans, in which the MLC position was displaced by 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, and 3.0 mm from the clinically used original plans, were created for ten patients who received VMAT treatment for prostate cancer. Dose deviation (DD), distance-to-agreement (DTA), and gamma index analysis (GA) for each plan were evaluated by D4D. These results were compared to the results (DD, DTA and GA) measured by Delta4 Phantom + (D4P). We compared the deviations between the planned and measured values of the MLC stop positions A-side and B-side in five clinical cases of prostate VMAT during treatment and measured the GA values. For D4D, when the acceptable errors for DD, DTA, and GA were determined to be &#8804;3%, &#8804;2 mm, and &#8804;3%/2 mm, respectively, the minimum detectable errors in the MLC position were 2.0, 1.5, and 1.5 mm based on DD, DTA, and GA respectively. The corresponding minimum detectable MLC position errors were 2.0, 1.0, and 1.5 mm, respectively, for D4P. The deviation between the planned and measured position of MLC stopping point of prostate VMAT during treatment was stable at an average of -0.09 ± 0.05 mm, and all GA values were above 99.86%. In terms of delivering doses and dose distribution of VMAT, error detectability of D4D was comparable to that of D4P. The transmission-type detector ""D4D"" is thus suitable for detecting delivery errors during irradiation.","Honda, Hirofumi; Tominaga, Masahide; Sasaki, Motoharu; Oita, Masataka; Kanzaki, Hiromitsu; Hamamoto, Yasushi; Ishii, Yoshiaki; Yamamoto, Ryuji; Mochizuki, Teruhito; Kido, Teruhito; Uto, Yoshihiro",J. appl. clin. med. phys,,360

As for antiretrovirals, the follow-up of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) users during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak may help to understand the potential protective effect of PrEP against SARS-CoV-2. We aimed to identify associations between oral PrEP use and COVID-19-related symptoms self-reporting. Phone call interviews or digital investigation (through WhatsApp® or e-mail) about oral PrEP regular use, social distancing, exposure to suspected or confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19-related symptoms. Among 108 individuals, the majority were cisgender, white and gay men. Although most of the individuals engaged in social distancing (68.52%), they kept on taking PrEP (75.93%). Few people have had contact with suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19 (12.04%), but some had COVID-19-related symptoms the month before the interview (27.78%) including rhinorrheoa (56.67%), cough (53.33%), asthaenia (50.00%) and headache (43.33%).

331244,Graduate Employability and Competence Development in Higher Education—A Systematic Literature Review Using PRISMA,2020,"In this paper, we demonstrate that aromatic oil capsules, produced by dripping droplets, can offer a simple, yet effective, testing tool to aid in the diagnosis of various diseases, in which the loss of smell is a key symptom. These include chronic neurological conditions such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, and acute respiratory infections such as that caused by COVID-19. The capsules were fabricated by concentrically dripping oil/alginate droplets, from a coaxial nozzle, into an oppositely charged ionic liquid. This fabrication technique enables full control over the capsule size, the shell thickness and the volume of the encapsulated oil. After formation, liquid capsules were left to dry and form a solid crust surrounding the oil. The prototype test consists of placing a standardized number of capsules between adhesive strips that users crush and pull apart to release the smell. In addition to the fabrication method, a simple mathematical model was developed to predict the volume of encapsulated oil within the capsule in terms of the flow rate ratio and the nozzle size. Tensile tests show that capsule strength is inversely proportional to its size owing to an increase in the shell thickness. By increasing the alginate concentration, the load required to rupture the capsule increases, to the point where capsules are too stiff to be broken by a fingertip grip. Results from a preliminary screening test, within a group of patients with Parkinson's disease, found that smells were detectable using a 'forced choice' paradigm.","Ismail, A Said; Goodwin, Gregory R; Castrejon-Pita, J Rafael; Noyce, Alastair J; Azevedo, Helena S",J R Soc Interface,,360
331301,Interrogating the “productive” home gardener in a time of pandemic lockdown in the Philippines,2020,"The World Health Organization declared a COVID-19 pandemic on March 11, 2020, when there were 4,293 confirmed cumulative deaths. By May 17, 2020 this number increased to 315,005. The risk of death is higher above the age of 60, but there are many deaths below 60 (for example, in Sao Paulo, 25%). Due to the lack of a vaccine or specific treatment, there are at least three types of interventions used in the first wave of this pandemic: increased alertness and hygiene (e.g. Sweden); identification and isolation of infected people and their contacts (e.g. South Korea); lockdown (e.g. Italy). These interventions are complementary. Choices of the right mix of interventions will vary from society to society and in the same society at different times. The search for a miracle drug is dangerous because it is based on the mistaken belief that any treatment option is better than ""nothing"". Brazilian society will not be able to maintain lockdown for a long period. Naturally, in the near future, regardless of the advice from scientists, doctors and authorities, commerce, services and schools will reopen. In order to implement any strategy aimed to control the pandemic and preserve the economy, the country needs leadership that centralizes and coordinates actions. Unfortunately, the Brazilian government is not fulfilling this role; on the contrary, it is a hindrance. This negative leadership and lack of coordination are causing many deaths and are severely damaging the lives of survivors by delaying the resuming of economic and social activities.","Nadanovsky, Paulo; Santos, Ana Paula Pires Dos",Braz Oral Res,,360

This has led to an urgent need to understand the molecular determinants of SARS-CoV-2 infection, factors associated with COVID-19 heterogeneity and severity, and therapeutic options for these patients. In this review, we discuss the role of host factors in SARS-CoV-2 infection and describe variations in host factor expression as mechanisms underlying the symptoms and severity of COVID-19. We focus on two host factors, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), implicated in SARS-CoV-2 infection. We also discuss genetic variants associated with COVID-19 severity revealed in selected patients and based on genome-wide association studies (GWASs). Furthermore, we highlight important advances in cell and chromatin biology, such as single-cell RNA and chromatin sequencing and chromosomal conformation assays, as methods that may aid in the discovery of viral-host interactions in COVID-19. Understanding how regulation of host factor genes varies in physiological and pathological states might explain the heterogeneity observed in SARS-CoV-2 infection, help identify pathways for therapeutic development, and identify patients most likely to progress to severe COVID-19.","Ong, Samantha Y Q; Flyamer, Ilya M; Bickmore, Wendy A; Biddie, Simon C",Exp Mol Med,,360

We reported successful use of high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) in cases of severe COVID-19, but evidence from larger case series is still lacking. Methods: A multi-center retrospective study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of IVIg administered within two weeks of disease onset at a total dose of 2 g/kg body weight, in addition to standard care. The primary endpoint was 28-day mortality. Efficacy of high-dose IVIg was assessed by using the Cox proportional hazards regression model and the Kaplan-Meier curve adjusted by inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) analysis, and IPTW after multiple imputation (MI) analysis. Results: Overall, 26 patients who received high-dose IVIg with standard therapy and 89 patients who received standard therapy only were enrolled in this study. The IVIg group was associated with a lower 28-day mortality rate and less time to normalization of inflammatory markers including IL-6, IL-10, and ferritin compared with the control. The adjusted HR of 28-day mortality in high-dose IVIg group was 0.24 (95% CI 0.06-0.99, p<0.001) in IPTW model, and 0.27 (95% CI 0.10-0.57, p=0.031) in IPTW-MI model. In subgroup analysis, patients with no comorbidities or treated in the first week of disease were associated with more benefit from high-dose IVIg. Conclusions: High-dose IVIg administered in severe COVID-19 patients within 14 days of onset was linked to reduced 28-day mortality, more prominent with those having no comorbidities or treated at earlier stage.","Cao, Wei; Liu, Xiaosheng; Hong, Ke; Ma, Zhiyong; Zhang, Yuelun; Lin, Ling; Han, Yang; Xiong, Yong; Liu, Zhengyin; Ruan, Lianguo; Li, Taisheng",Front Immunol,,360

The crisis layers and thresholds model and Information and Communication Technology-mediated social sensing for evidence-based crisis management and communication,2020,"Organisations, whether in government, industry or commerce, are required to make decisions in a complex and uncertain environment. The way models are used is intimately connected to the way organisations make decisions and the context in which they make them. Typically, in a complex organisation, multiple related models will often be used in support of a decision. For example, engineering models might be combined with financial models and macro-economic models in order to decide whether to invest in new production capability. Different parts of a complex organisation might operate their own related models which might then be presented to a central decision maker. Yet in practice, there is little awareness of the practical challenges of using models in a robust way to support decision making. There is significant scope to improve decision making though an enhanced understanding of the role and limitations of modelling and through the application of cutting edge methodologies and organisational best practice. This report is in the form of a 'white paper', whose purpose is to identify key issues for consideration whist postulating tentative approaches to these issues that might be worthy of further exploration, focussing on both technical and organisational aspects. It begins with a framework for consideration of how model-based decisions are made in organisations. It then looks more closely at the questions of uncertainty and multiple models. It then postulates some technical statistical and organisational approaches for managing some of these issues. Finally, it considers the way forward, and the possible focus for further work.","Dent, Chris J; Goldstein, Michael; Wright, Andrew; Wynn, Henry P.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.11813v1.pdf,360

Although SARS-CoV-2 mainly attacks respiratory systems, manifestations of multiple organs have been observed. A great concern was raised about whether COVID-19 may affect male reproductive functions. In this study, we collected semen specimens from 12 male COVID-19 patients for virus detection and semen characteristics analysis. No SARS-CoV-2 was found in semen specimens. Eight out of 12 patients had normal semen quality. We also compared the sex-related hormone levels between 119 reproductive-aged men with SARS-CoV-2 infection and 273 age-matched control men. A higher serum luteinizing hormone (LH) and a lower ratio of testosterone (T) to LH were observed in the COVID-19 group. Multiple regression analysis indicated that serum T: LH ratio was negatively associated with white blood cell counts and C-reactive protein levels in COVID-19 patients. It's the first report about semen assessment and sex-hormone evaluation in reproductive-aged male COVID-19 patients. Although further study is needed to clarify the reasons and underlying mechanisms, our study presents an abnormal sex hormone secretion among COVID-19 patients, suggesting that attention should be paid to reproductive function evaluation in the follow-up.","Ma, Ling; Xie, Wen; Li, Danyang; Shi, Lei; Ye, Guangming; Mao, Yanhong; Xiong, Yao; Sun, Hui; Zheng, Fang; Chen, Zhimin; Qin, Jyuling; Lyu, Jing; Zhang, Yuanzhen; Zhang, Ming",J. med. virol,,360

RESULTS: A total of 628 surveys were completed (18% response rate); the mean respondent age was 52 ± 10 years, and 79% were women. Anxiety was reported by 68% of respondents, followed by sadness (41%), sleep problems (36%), anger (25%), and depression (23%). A higher psychological distress score correlated with female gender (odds ratio [OR], 1.9; P = .001), younger age (OR, 0.8 per SD; P = .005), and a higher financial loss score (OR, 1.4; P < .0001). Participants whose practices had not initiated wellness efforts specific to COVID-19 (54%) had higher psychological distress scores (OR, 1.4; P = .03). Of those with children at home, 38% reported increased childcare needs, higher in women than men (40% versus 29%, P < .001). Thirty-seven percent reported that childcare needs had adversely affected their jobs, which correlated with higher psychological distress scores (OR, 2.2-3.3; P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Psychological distress was highest among younger and female respondents and those with greater pandemic-specific childcare needs and financial loss. Practice-initiated COVID-19-specific wellness efforts were associated with decreased psychological distress. Policies are needed to mitigate pandemic-specific burnout and worsening gender disparities.","Milch, Hannah S; Grimm, Lars J; Plimpton, S Reed; Tran, Khai; Markovic, Daniela; Dontchos, Brian N; Destounis, Stamatia; Dialani, Vandana; Dogan, Basak E; Sonnenblick, Emily B; Zuley, Margarita L; Dodelzon, Katerina",J Am Coll Radiol,,360

For two-line thermometry, the uncertainties in linestrengths of the absorption lines may cause systematic errors in temperature and species concentration estimations. Thus, the radial profiles of water vapor concentration are obtained first using the LIBS, assuming that the combustion is complete; then, the radial temperature profiles are estimated from the radial profiles of absorption coefficient, as reconstructed from the absorbance profiles obtained using the TDLAS. The spectral lines of water vapor at 7185.6 and 7444.36 cm-1 are selected as the linestrengths show monotonic decreases with the increase in temperature within the measuring temperature range. The radial profiles of temperature and water mole fraction are well-reconstructed, and the measurement error is found to be as low as 3%. The technique yielded higher temperatures compared to the thermocouple, possibly owing to the significant radiative heat loss in the thermocouple data.","Lee, Jungwun; Bong, Cheolwoo; Yoo, Jihyung; Bak, Moon Soo",Opt Express,,360

339632,Coronavirus pandemic stirs fight over abortion rights in US,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic is causing a significant increase in the number of patients requiring relatively prolonged invasive mechanical ventilation and an associated surge in patients who need a tracheostomy to facilitate weaning from respiratory support. In parallel, there has been a global increase in guidance from professional bodies representing staff who care for patients with tracheostomies at different points in their acute hospital journey, rehabilitation and recovery. Of concern are the risks to healthcare staff of infection arising from tracheostomy insertion and caring for patients with a tracheostomy. Hospitals are also facing extraordinary demands on critical care services such that many patients who require a tracheostomy will be managed outside established intensive care or head and neck units and cared for by staff with little tracheostomy experience. These concerns led NHS England and NHS Improvement to expedite the National Patient Safety Improvement Programme's 'Safe Tracheostomy Care' workstream as part of the NHS COVID-19 response. Supporting this workstream, UK stakeholder organisations involved in tracheostomy care were invited to develop consensus guidance based on: expert opinion; the best available published literature; and existing multidisciplinary guidelines. Topics with direct relevance for frontline staff were identified. This consensus guidance includes: infectivity of patients with respect to tracheostomy indications and timing; aerosol-generating procedures and risks to staff; insertion procedures; and management following tracheostomy.","McGrath, B A; Ashby, N; Birchall, M; Dean, P; Doherty, C; Ferguson, K; Gimblett, J; Grocott, M; Jacob, T; Kerawala, C; Macnaughton, P; Magennis, P; Moonesinghe, R; Twose, P; Wallace, S; Higgs, A",Anaesthesia,,360
339667,The Resilient Melbourne experiment: Analyzing the conditions for transformative urban resilience implementation,2020,"COVID-19 is a pandemic disease that causes severe pulmonary damage and hyperinflammation. Vitamin A is a crucial factor in the development of immune functions and is known to be reduced in cases of acute inflammation. This prospective, multicenter observational cross-sectional study analyzed vitamin A plasma levels in SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals, and 40 hospitalized patients were included. Of these, 22 developed critical disease (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome [ARDS]/Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [ECMO]), 9 developed severe disease (oxygen supplementation), and 9 developed moderate disease (no oxygen supplementation). A total of 47 age-matched convalescent persons that had been earlier infected with SARS-CoV-2 were included as the control group. Vitamin A plasma levels were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. Reduced vitamin A plasma levels correlated significantly with increased levels of inflammatory markers (CRP, ferritin) and with markers of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection (reduced lymphocyte count, LDH). Vitamin A levels were significantly lower in hospitalized patients than in convalescent persons (p < 0.01). Of the hospitalized patients, those who were critically ill showed significantly lower vitamin A levels than those who were moderately ill (p < 0.05). Vitamin A plasma levels below 0.2 mg/L were significantly associated with the development of ARDS (OR = 5.54 [1.01-30.26]; p = 0.048) and mortality (OR 5.21 [1.06-25.5], p = 0.042). Taken together, we conclude that vitamin A plasma levels in COVID-19 patients are reduced during acute inflammation and that severely reduced plasma levels of vitamin A are significantly associated with ARDS and mortality.","Tepasse, Phil-Robin; Vollenberg, Richard; Fobker, Manfred; Kabar, Iyad; Schmidt, Hartmut; Meier, Jörn Arne; Nowacki, Tobias; Hüsing-Kabar, Anna",Nutrients,,360

342052,Rapidly Changing Cities: Working with Socio-Ecological Systems to Facilitate Transformation,2021,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had an unprecedented impact on the healthcare system in the United States. The redistribution of resources and suspension of elective procedures and other services has resulted in financial stress across all service lines. The financial effects on the practice of vascular surgery have not yet been quantified. We hypothesized that vascular surgery divisions have experienced losses affecting the hospital and professional sides that will not be recoupable without significant productivity increases. METHODS: Administrative claims data for clinical services performed by the vascular surgery division at a tertiary medical center for March and April 2019 and for March and April 2020 were analyzed. These claims were separated into two categories: hospital claims (inpatient and outpatient) and professional claims (professional reimbursement for all services provided). Medicare reimbursement methods were used to assign financial value: diagnosis-related group for inpatient services, ambulatory payment classification for outpatient services, and the Medicare physician fee schedule for professional reimbursement and work relative value units (wRVUs). Reimbursements and productivity (wRVUs) were compared between the two periods. A financial model was created to determine the increase in future productivity over baseline required to mitigate the losses incurred during the pandemic. RESULTS: A total of 11,317 vascular surgery claims were reviewed. Hospital reimbursement during the pandemic decreased from $4,982,114 to $2,649,521 (-47%) overall (inpatient, from $3,505,775 to $2,128,133 [-39%]; outpatient, from $1,476,339 to $521,388 [-65%]) and professional reimbursement decreased from $933,897 to $430,967 (-54%) compared with the same period in 2019. Professional productivity as measured by wRVUs sustained a similar decline from 10,478 wRVUs to 5386 wRVUs (-51%). Modeling sensitivity analyses demonstrated that if a vascular division were able to increase inpatient and outpatient revenue to greater than prepandemic levels by 10%, 5%, or 3%, it would take 9, 19, or 31 months, respectively, for the hospital to recover their pandemic-associated losses. Similarly, professional reimbursement recovery would require 11, 20, or 36 months with corresponding increases in productivity. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has had profound and lasting effects on the world in terms of lives lost and financial hardships. The financial effects on vascular surgery divisions has resulted in losses ranging from 39% to 65% compared with the prepandemic period in the previous year. Because the complete mitigation of losses is not feasible in the short term, alternative and novel strategies are needed to financially sustain the vascular division and hospital during a prolonged recovery period.","Fang, Zachary B; Simons, Jessica P; Judelson, Dejah R; Arous, Edward J; Jones, Douglas W; Steppacher, Robert C; Schanzer, Andres; Aiello, Francesco A",J Vasc Surg,,360

However, the emotional response of persons with diabetes to the pandemic is only now beginning to emerge. Therefore this study aimed to identify factors contributing to emotional reactions towards this pandemic among persons with diabetes. A total of 205 persons with diabetes participated in this cross-sectional online survey between 14 May and 22 June 2020. Participants completed measures of emotional reactions towards COVID-19, perceived diabetes status, perceived susceptibility, knowledge about COVID-19, sense of mastery and sociodemographic questionnaires. Statistical analyses included Pearson correlations and regression analysis. According to the results, the mean score of negative emotional reactions towards COVID-19 was 3.45 (standard deviation 1.11, range 1-5), meaning that the score was relatively high. Higher levels of negative emotional reactions towards COVID-19 were associated with higher perceived susceptibility, greater knowledge about COVID-19 and a lower sense of mastery. The study's findings emphasize the need to communicate ongoing knowledge regarding COVID-19 and diabetes as well as to provide persons with diabetes with the necessary emotional support related to coping with diabetes and COVID-19.","Shinan-Altman, Shiri; Levkovich, Inbar",International health (Online),,360

COVID-19 is associated with viral pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome causing significant morbidity and mortality. The proposed treatments for COVID-19 have shown little or no effect in the clinic so far. Additionally, bacterial and fungal pathogens contribute to the SARS-CoV-2-mediated pneumonia disease complex. The antibiotic resistance in pneumonia treatment is increasing at an alarming rate. Therefore, carbon-based nanomaterials (CBNs), such as fullerene, carbon dots, graphene, and their derivatives constitute a promising alternative due to their wide-spectrum antimicrobial activity, biocompatibility, biodegradability, and capacity to induce tissue regeneration. Furthermore, the antimicrobial mode of action is mainly physical (e.g., membrane distortion), characterized by a low risk of antimicrobial resistance. In this Review, we evaluated the literature on the antiviral activity and broad-spectrum antimicrobial properties of CBNs. CBNs had antiviral activity against 13 enveloped positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses, including SARS-CoV-2. CBNs with low or no toxicity to humans are promising therapeutics against the COVID-19 pneumonia complex with other viruses, bacteria, and fungi, including those that are multidrug-resistant.","Serrano-Aroca, Ángel; Takayama, Kazuo; Tuñón-Molina, Alberto; Seyran, Murat; Hassan, Sk Sarif; Pal Choudhury, Pabitra; Uversky, Vladimir N; Lundstrom, Kenneth; Adadi, Parise; Palù, Giorgio; Aljabali, Alaa A A; Chauhan, Gaurav; Kandimalla, Ramesh; Tambuwala, Murtaza M; Lal, Amos; Abd El-Aziz, Tarek Mohamed; Sherchan, Samendra; Barh, Debmalya; Redwan, Elrashdy M; Bazan, Nicolas G; Mishra, Yogendra Kumar; Uhal, Bruce D; Brufsky, Adam",ACS Nano,,360

Currently, a few studies include octogenarian patients and none of them analyze the impact of functional status on this health outcome. Our objective is to describe the characteristics of patients older than 80 years hospitalized for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), to determine the mortality rate and to identify associated factors. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Prospective observational study carried out on patients over 80 years admitted for COVID-19 in a Geriatrics Service. Sociodemographic, clinical, functional, mental, analytical, radiological, therapeutic and healthcare variables were collected. The factors associated with in-hospital lethality were analyzed by bivariate analysis. RESULTS: 58 cases with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were included, mean age 88.3 ± 5.4 years, 69% women, 65.5% moderate-severe cognitive impairment and previous Barthel index 40.66 ± 36. The main symptoms were fever (60,3%), dyspnea (53.4%) and deterioration of functional condition (50%). The most frequent comorbidities were cardiovascular disease (75.9%), hypertension (HT) (74.1%) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) (50%). A mortality rate of 41,4% was detected and the associated factors were: severe functional dependence (OR = 3.8 [1.2-12.2]), moderate-severe cognitive impairment (OR = 4.9 [1-25.4]) and CKD (OR = 3.2 [1.1-9.7]). CONCLUSION: High mortality rates are observed in older patients hospitalized for COVID-19, with a higher risk of dying in those with severe functional dependence or cognitive impairment. These findings reinforce the value of Geriatric Assessment to develop strategies to adapt diagnostic and therapeutic decision-making and to optimize care for elderly patients in the event of a new epidemic outbreak.","Gutiérrez Rodríguez, José; Montero Muñoz, Javier; Jiménez Muela, Francisco; Guirola García-Prendes, Cristina; Martínez Rivera, Marta; Gómez Armas, Laura",Rev. esp. geriatr. gerontol.

344912,A Message from the Editor-in-Chief,2020,"BackgroundSerological assays are being deployed to monitor antibody responses in SARS-CoV-2 convalescents and vaccine recipients. There is a need to determine whether such assays can predict immunity, as antibody levels wane and viral variants emerge. MethodsWe measured antibodies in a cohort of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients using several high-throughput serological tests and functional neutralization assays. The effects of time and spike protein sequence variation on the performance and predictive value of the various assays was assessed. FindingsNeutralizing antibody titers decreased over the first few months post-infection but stabilized thereafter, at about 30% of the level observed shortly after infection. Serological assays commonly used to measure antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 displayed a range of sensitivities that declined to varying extents over time. Quantitative measurements generated by serological assays based on the spike protein were better at predicting neutralizing antibody titers than assays based on nucleocapsid, but performance was variable and manufacturer positivity thresholds were not able to predict the presence or absence of detectable neutralizing activity. Even though there was some deterioration in correlation between serological measurements and functional neutralization activity, some assays maintained an ability to predict neutralizing titers, even against variants of concern. InterpretationThe ability of high throughput serological assays to predict neutralizing antibody titers is likely crucial for evaluation of immunity at the population scale. These data will facilitate the selection of the most suitable assays as surrogates of functional neutralizing activity and suggest that such measurements may have utility in clinical practice.","Muecksch, Frauke; Wise, Helen; Templeton, Kate; Batchelor, Becky; Squires, Maria; McCance, Kirsty; Jarvis, Lisa; Malloy, Kristen; Furrie, Elizabeth; Richardson, Claire; MacGuire, Jacqueline; Godber, Ian; Burns, Alana; Mavin, Sally; Zhang, Fengwen; Schmidt, Fabian; Bieniasz, Paul; Jenks, Sara; Hatziioannou, Theodora",,,360

Several risk factors have been identified, and obesity has become one of prominent concern. Excessive weight is considered a risk factor for CVD based on evidence linking it to a hypercoagulable state. Considering the prevalence of CVD and obesity in the USA, along with the increased risk for thrombus-related events, anticoagulation plays a significant role in prevention and treatment. Direct oral anticoagulants have taken the place of many traditional anticoagulants. Considering the recently approved indications and continued postmarketing studies conducted with rivaroxaban, this updated review provides data on the overall impact of obesity on this compound. This includes data obtained from both healthy obese volunteers and obese patients with various CVD conditions enrolled in rivaroxaban clinical trials, along with data obtained from postmarketing real-world evidence studies. Assessment of the clinical pharmacology and population pharmacokinetics in obese individuals revealed no clinically relevant effects of increased weight. Additionally, subgroup analyses from each of the pivotal phase III trials supporting the current approved labeling also demonstrated consistent efficacy and safety results in obese patients. Lastly, these findings are further supported by several recent real-world evidence studies assessing the continued effectiveness and safety of rivaroxaban. In conclusion, rivaroxaban's overall pharmacological and clinical profile remained consistent in obese adults when assessed in both drug development and postmarketing studies, supporting the premise that higher weight does not necessitate adjustment in either dose strength or regimen.","Ashton, Veronica; Mudarris, Lana; Moore, Kenneth T",Am. j. cardiovasc. drugs,,360

DESIGN: A cross-sectional national survey. SETTING: Amazon Mechanical Turk (mTurk) and Prolific Research Platforms. PARTICIPANTS: Five hundred and one U.S. dwelling English-speaking adults 60 years old and older. MEASUREMENTS: Participants completed an online survey with the PHQ-9; GAD-7; Short Health Anxiety Inventory; 3-item UCLA Loneliness scale; PROMIS measures of global health, instrumental, and emotional support; 10-item Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale; and COVID-19 needs assessment. RESULTS: Across the sample 13% reported moderate depressive symptoms, 9% reported moderate anxiety symptoms, and 26% endorsed being ""lonely."" The emotionally distressed group endorsed more loneliness, lower resiliency, less physical exercise, and worse physical health. The low Socio-Economic Status group endorsed less loneliness, less likely to engage in physical exercise and worse physical health.The lonely group endorsed less resilience, less physical exercise, and worse physical health. A multiple logistic regression found that resilience, socioeconomic status, and physical health were significant predictors of loneliness, whereas global health was the best predictor of emotional distress. CONCLUSIONS: Even after prolonged social distancing, older adults in this study did not report greater psychological distress compared to earlier studies of older adults during COVID-19. Older adults with lower SES, worse physical health, and less resiliency, were more likely to report more loneliness. It is this group that should be the focus of intervention.","Sams, Nichole; Fisher, Dylan M; Mata-Greve, Felicia; Johnson, Morgan; Pullmann, Michael D; Raue, Patrick J; Renn, Brenna N; Duffy, Jaden; Darnell, Doyanne; Fillipo, Isabell Griffith; Allred, Ryan; Huynh, Kathy; Friedman, Emily; Areán, Patricia A",Am. j. geriatr. psychiatry,,360

347154,"Community Development Block Grants and the CARES Act [Updated May 14, 2020]",2020,"Last few decades, viruses are a real menace to human safety. Therefore, the rapid identification of viruses should be one of the best ways to prevent an outbreak and important implications for medical healthcare. The recent outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus which belongs to the single-stranded, positive-strand RNA viruses. The pandemic dimension spread of COVID-19 poses a severe threat to the health and lives of seven billion people worldwide. There is a growing urgency worldwide to establish a point-of-care device for the rapid detection of COVID-19 to prevent subsequent secondary spread. Therefore, the need for sensitive, selective, and rapid diagnostic devices plays a vital role in selecting appropriate treatments and to prevent the epidemics. During the last decade, electrochemical biosensors have emerged as reliable analytical devices and represent a new promising tool for the detection of different pathogenic viruses. This review summarizes the state of the art of different virus detection with currently available electrochemical detection methods. Moreover, this review discusses different fabrication techniques, detection principles, and applications of various virus biosensors. Future research also looks at the use of electrochemical biosensors regarding a potential detection kit for the rapid identification of the COVID-19.","Khan, M Z H; Hasan, M R; Hossain, S I; Ahommed, M S; Daizy, M",Biosens Bioelectron,,360
347159,A data visualization interactive exploration of human mobility data during the COVID-19 outbreak: a case study,2020,"BACKGROUND: Undifferentiated connective tissue disease (UCTD) is known to induce adverse pregnancy outcomes and even recurrent spontaneous abortion (RSA) by placental vascular damage and inflammation activation. Anticoagulation can prevent pregnancy morbidities. However, it is unknown whether the addition of immune suppressants to anticoagulation can prevent spontaneous pregnancy loss in UCTD patients. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and low-dose prednisone on recurrent pregnancy loss for women with UCTD. METHODS: The Immunosuppressant for Living Fetuses (ILIFE) Trial is a three-arm, multicenter, open-label randomized controlled trial with the primary objective of comparing hydroxychloroquine combined with low-dose prednisone and anticoagulation with anticoagulation alone in treating UCTD women with recurrent spontaneous abortion. The third arm of using hydroxychloroquine combined with anticoagulant for secondary comparison. A total of 426 eligible patients will be randomly assigned to each of the three arms with a 1:1:1 allocation ratio. The primary outcome is the rate of live births. Secondary outcomes include adverse pregnancy outcomes and progression of UCTD. DISCUSSION: This is the first multi-center, open-label, randomized controlled trial which evaluates the efficacy of immunosuppressant regimens on pregnancy outcomes and UCTD progression. It will provide evidence on whether the immunosuppressant ameliorates the pregnancy prognosis in UCTD patients with RSA and the progression into defined connective tissue disease.

347597,Who is hacking the NHS during a pandemic?,2021,"Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are known to infect both humans and animals. However, the evidence of inter-transmission of coronavirus between humans and companion animals is still a debatable issue. There is substantial evidence that the virus outbreak is fueled by zoonotic transmission because this new virus belongs to the same family of viruses as SARS-CoV associated with civet cats, and MERS-CoV associated with dromedary camels. While the whole world is investigating the possibility about the transmission of this virus, the transmission among humans is established, but the interface between humans and animals is not much evident. Not only are the lives of human beings at risk, but there is an equal potential threat to the animal world. With multiple reports claiming about much possibility of transmission of COVID-19 from humans to animals, there has been a significant increase in the number of pets being abandoned by their owners. Additionally, the risk of reverse transmission of COVID-19 virus from companion pets like cats and dogs at home is yet another area of concern. The present article highlights different evidence of human-animal interface and necessitates the precautionary measures required to combat with the consequences of this interface. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) have suggested various ways to promote awareness and corroborate practices for helping people as well as animals to stay secure and healthy.","Singla, Rubal; Mishra, Abhishek; Joshi, Rupa; Jha, Sonali; Sharma, Amit Raj; Upadhyay, Sujata; Sarma, Phulen; Prakash, Ajay; Medhi, Bikash",Vet Res Commun,,360
347820,Covid-19 and the Opportunity in Publishing,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To examine mortality rates related to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by gender among European countries. METHODS: PubMed, preprint medRxiv and bioRxiv repositories, and Google were searched for the terms COVID-19, mortality rates, gender, and Europe. Only Google provided a website with appropriate information. COVID-19 cases and deaths from European countries were extracted by gender from the Global Health 50/50 repository up to May 23, 2020. Extracted data included country, the total number of COVID-19 cases and the number of related deaths by gender. Random effects models with the inverse variance method were used for meta-analyses. Results are reported as death risk ratios (RRs). RESULTS: We identified information from 23 European countries that reported separately by gender mortality rates related to COVID-19. The sample comprised 484,919 men and 605,229 women positive for COVID-19. The mortality rate was significantly higher in men than in women (risk ratio = 1.60, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1.53, 1.68). The trend was similar when countries reporting < 5000, or < 10,000 cases were excluded from the analysis (RR = 1.60, 95 % CI 1.52, 1.69 and RR = 1.68; CI 1.62, 1.76, respectively). CONCLUSION: In Europe, the new zoonotic coronavirus causes significantly more deaths in men than in women.","Pérez-López, Faustino R; Tajada, Mauricio; Savirón-Cornudella, Ricardo; Sánchez-Prieto, Manuel; Chedraui, Peter; Terán, Enrique",Maturitas,,360
347874,Comparative Analysis of the International Development Banks’ Activities During COVID-19 and Beyond,2021,"As of October 8th, 2020, the number of confirmed cases and deaths in Brazil due to COVID-19 hit 5,002,357 and 148,304, respectively, making the country one of the most affected by the pandemic. The State of São Paulo (SSP) hosts the largest number of confirmed cases in Brazil, with over 1,016,755 cases to date. This study was carried out to investigate how the social distancing measures could have influenced the Ibitinga reservoir's water transparency in São Paulo State, Brazil. We hypothesize that although the city's drainage is the major reservoir's input, as opposed to what has been reported elsewhere, the effect of extensive lockdown in the city of São Paulo due to COVID-19 is marginal on the water transparency. A time series of OLI/Landsat-8 images since 2014 were used to estimate the Secchi Disk Depth (ZSD). The COVID-19 cases and deaths (per 100,000 inhabitants), and social isolation index were used to find links between the ZSD and COVID-19. The results showed that the highest ZDS (higher than 1.6 m) occurred during the dry season (Austral autumn and beginning of Austral winter) and the lowest (0.4–0.8 m) during March 2020 (end of Austral summer). Paired sample t-Tests between images of 2020 and all the others showed that April 20th values were not different from that of June 14th, April 17th and March 18th. ZSD values from May 20th were not statistically different from May 14th and April 15th;June 20th values were not different from June 14th;and March 20th values were statistically different from all. We therefore conclude that, based on satellite data, the lockdown in SSP unlikely have influenced the water transparency in the Ibitinga reservoir. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Contador, T.

Firstly emerged in the city of Wuhan, China, SARS-CoV-2 infection is rapidly escalating into a global pandemic. It is first thought as the result of a zoonotic transmission event, similar to the previous epidemic of coronaviruses. However, a continuously increasing number of confirmed cases indicates that the virus gains capacity of efficient human-to-human transmission. Soon after the pandemic is arising, many efforts are focused on identifying the origin of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the human population. Current evidence suggests that the virus is probably derived from bat or pangolin coronaviruses as the natural host. Whether intermediate host(s) exist in the transmission cascade from bat or pangolin to humans is, to a great extent, elusive. This information is essential as the basis for infection prevention and control measures. In this review, we discuss our recent understanding of SARS-CoV-2 biology, highlighting its origin and molecular evolution.","Hakim, Mohamad Saifudin; Annisa, Luthvia; Supriyati, Endah; Daniwijaya, Edwin W.; Wibowo, Rakhmat A.; Arguni, Eggi; Nuryastuti, Titik",Journal Of The Medical Sciences (Berkala Ilmu Kedokteran),,360

Drawing on social representations theory and positioning theory, we explore social representations and identities related to COVID-19 in mass media using a visual rhetoric analysis. More specifically, we focus on how newspaper photographs construct subjects' positions for different age groups. The data consisted of 4,506 photographs of people published in the two largest Finnish newspapers between 1 January and 31 August 2020. The study identified the following subject positions for the different age groups: (a) children as controlled pupils and joyful players; (b) youth as future-oriented graduates and reckless partygoers; (c) adults as authoritative experts, adaptive professionals, responsible caretakers and active recreationists and (d) elderly people as isolated loners. In addition to echoing the positions of villains, heroes and victims identified in previous studies, the photographs seemed to construct an intergroup divide between adults and the other age groups. Methodologically, this study elaborates the usefulness of the analysis of visual rhetoric in social representations research. Theoretically, we seek to advance the understanding of the role of media, particularly images, in the social construction of knowledge.","Martikainen, Jari; Sakki, Inari",,,360

OBJECTIVE: Determine the association between county-level proportion of non-Hispanic Black (NHB) on county COVID-19 case and death rates and observe how this association was influenced by county sociodemographic and health care infrastructure characteristics. DESIGN AND SETTING: This was an ecologic analysis of US counties as of September 20, 2020, that employed stepwise construction of linear and negative binomial regression models. The primary independent variable was the proportion of NHB population in the county. Covariates included county demographic composition, proportion uninsured, proportion living in crowded households, proportion living in poverty, population density, state testing rate, Primary Care Health Professional Shortage Area status, and hospital beds per 1000 population. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcomes were exponentiated COVID-19 cases per 100 000 population and COVID-19 deaths per 100 000 population. We produced county-level maps of the measures of interest. RESULTS: In total, 3044 of 3142 US counties were included. Bivariate relationships between the proportion of NHB in a county and county COVID-19 case (Exp ß = 1.026; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.024-1.028; P < .001) and death rates (rate ratio [RR] = 1.032; 95% CI, 1.029-1.035; P < .001) were not attenuated in fully adjusted models. The adjusted association between the proportion of NHB population in a county and county COVID-19 case was Exp ß = 1.025 (95% CI, 1.023-1.027; P < .001) and the association with county death rates was RR = 1.034 (95% CI, 1.031-1.038; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of NHB people in a county was positively associated with county COVID-19 case and death rates and did not change in models that accounted for other socioecologic and health care infrastructure characteristics that have been hypothesized to account for the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on racial and ethnic minority populations.

In a phase 1-2 trial involving healthy adults, the NVX-CoV2373 nanoparticle vaccine had an acceptable safety profile and was associated with strong neutralizing-antibody and antigen-specific polyfunctional CD4+ T-cell responses. Evaluation of vaccine efficacy was needed in a setting of ongoing SARS-CoV-2 transmission. METHODS: In this phase 2a-b trial in South Africa, we randomly assigned human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-negative adults between the ages of 18 and 84 years or medically stable HIV-positive participants between the ages of 18 and 64 years in a 1:1 ratio to receive two doses of either the NVX-CoV2373 vaccine (5 µg of recombinant spike protein with 50 µg of Matrix-M1 adjuvant) or placebo. The primary end points were safety and vaccine efficacy against laboratory-confirmed symptomatic Covid-19 at 7 days or more after the second dose among participants without previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: Of 6324 participants who underwent screening, 4387 received at least one injection of vaccine or placebo. Approximately 30% of the participants were seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 at baseline. Among 2684 baseline seronegative participants (94% HIV-negative and 6% HIV-positive), predominantly mild-to-moderate Covid-19 developed in 15 participants in the vaccine group and in 29 in the placebo group (vaccine efficacy, 49.4%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 6.1 to 72.8). Vaccine efficacy among HIV-negative participants was 60.1% (95% CI, 19.9 to 80.1). Of 41 sequenced isolates, 38 (92.7%) were the B.1.351 variant. Post hoc vaccine efficacy against B.1.351 was 51.0% (95% CI, -0.6 to 76.2) among the HIV-negative participants. Preliminary local and systemic reactogenicity events were more common in the vaccine group; serious adverse events were rare in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: The NVX-CoV2373 vaccine was efficacious in preventing Covid-19, with higher vaccine efficacy observed among HIV-negative participants. Most infections were caused by the B.1.351 variant.

350341,Editor's Note: Prospects for STS and the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: Genetic variants identified in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are often not specific enough to reveal complex underlying physiology. By integrating RNA-seq data and GWAS summary statistics, novel computational methods allow unbiased identification of trait-relevant tissues and cell types. METHODS: The CKDGen consortium provided GWAS summary data for eGFR, urinary albumin-creatinine ratio (UACR), BUN, and serum urate. Genotype-Tissue Expression Project (GTEx) RNA-seq data were used to construct the top 10% specifically expressed genes for each of 53 tissues followed by linkage disequilibrium (LD) score-based enrichment testing for each trait. Similar procedures were performed for five kidney single-cell RNA-seq datasets from humans and mice and for a microdissected tubule RNA-seq dataset from rat. Gene set enrichment analyses were also conducted for genes implicated in Mendelian kidney diseases. RESULTS: Across 53 tissues, genes in kidney function-associated GWAS loci were enriched in kidney (P=9.1E-8 for eGFR; P=1.2E-5 for urate) and liver (P=6.8·10-5 for eGFR). In the kidney, proximal tubule was enriched in humans (P=8.5E-5 for eGFR; P=7.8E-6 for urate) and mice (P=0.0003 for eGFR; P=0.0002 for urate) and confirmed as the primary cell type in microdissected tubules and organoids. Gene set enrichment analysis supported this and showed enrichment of genes implicated in monogenic glomerular diseases in podocytes. A systematic approach generated a comprehensive list of GWAS genes prioritized by cell type-specific expression. CONCLUSIONS: Integration of GWAS statistics of kidney function traits and gene expression data identified relevant tissues and cell types, as a basis for further mechanistic studies to understand GWAS loci.","Li, Yong; Haug, Stefan; Schlosser, Pascal; Teumer, Alexander; Tin, Adrienne; Pattaro, Cristian; Köttgen, Anna; Wuttke, Matthias",J.

352236,The Social Robot in Rehabilitation and Assistance: What Is the Future?,2021,"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has shaken the global financial system and caused great turmoil. Facing unprecedented risks in the markets, people have increasing needs to find a safe haven for their investments. Given that the nature of this crisis is a combination of multiple problems, it is substantially different from all other financial crises known to us. It is therefore urgent to re-evaluate the safe-haven role of some traditional asset types, namely, gold, cryptocurrency, foreign exchange and commodities. This paper introduces a sequential monitoring procedure to detect changes in the left-quantiles of asset returns, and to assess whether a tail change in the equity index can be offset by introducing a safe-haven asset into a simple mean-variance portfolio. The sample studied covers a training period between August–December 2019 and a testing period of December 2019–March 2020. Furthermore, we calculate the cross-quantilogram between pair-wise asset returns and compare their directional predictability on left-quantiles in both normal market conditions and the COVID-19 period. The main results show that the role of safe haven becomes less effective for most of the assets considered in this paper, while gold and soybean commodity futures remain robust as safe-haven assets during this pandemic.","Ji, Qiang; Zhang, Dayong; Zhao, Yuqian",Int.

To address this urgent problem, the field of health education and public health must be equipped with the critical frameworks and concepts to analyze racism and White supremacy and how it affects the health and well-being of Asian Americans. We argue that using an ethnic studies lens in health education can help educators, researchers, and practitioners teach and train health educators to address racism experienced by Asian Americans during COVID-19 in relation to their health. We will discuss the elements of ethnic studies and demonstrate how to use it as a lens in understanding health disparities in the Asian American population influenced and exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.","Maglalang, Dale Dagar; Peregrina, Hillary Nicole; Yoo, Grace J; Le, Mai-Nhung",Health Educ Behav,,360

It is also an important and current research issue concerning seaports. Innovations may have a different nature, and practice shows that their implementation is in line with certain trends that set the directions for the development of innovative solutions throughout the world. This study aims to identify the most important technological innovations implemented in European seaports and determine whether they are in line with global innovation trends. It was also a priority to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the direction of innovation processes implemented within the ports. The author carried out two steps of research. The first one was based on secondary sources (publications and data from the Internet) and the second on primary sources (surveys conducted in March and October 2020). The analysis of data from secondary sources made it possible to identify the most significant global innovation trends in seaports. The study of data from surveys carried out with the managers of port companies allowed the author to conclude that the COVID-19 pandemic in the analyzed period of the year 2020 had little impact on the European seaports' innovative activities, which go in line with global innovation trends. It did not stop the innovation processes in those ports, causing only slight delays in implementing some scheduled innovative projects. It also did not influence the types of such projects carried out at that time or their significance. We can see that it also had no adverse effect on the emergence of new innovative trends in the examined enterprises. During the pandemic, European seaports made efforts to ensure the continued implementation of innovations in line with the established plans.","Szymanowska, B.",E-Mentor,,360

The research results show that consumers are self-efficacious to a degree when it comes to purchase decision making in the context of pandemics. Vulnerability and resilience directly influence the purchase satisfaction and indirectly influence the repurchase intention via satisfaction. Furthermore, purchase satisfaction positively affects the repurchase intention. In addition, research results show that consumer adaptability to online shopping moderates the relationship between consumer resilience and purchase satisfaction.

(preprint),2021,"Introduction Environ 5 % des patients atteints de COVID-19 nécessitent une prise en charge en réanimation et sont à risque de développer des infections secondaires, y compris des infections fongiques invasives (IFI). Notre objectif est de décrire l’impact de la première vague de COVID-19 sur la consommation en antifongiques systémiques (AF) en milieu hospitalier. Matériels et méthodes Une application dédiée a été développée pour recueillir les consommations AF exprimées en nombre de doses définies journalières pour 1000 journées d’hospitalisation (DDJ/1000 JH). La consommation totale de l’hôpital et en réanimation a été recueillie mensuellement pour les premiers semestres 2019 et 2020 (S1-2019 et S1-2020). Le nombre de patients COVID-19 hospitalisés au cours du premier semestre 2020 et le nombre de JH en réanimation étaient renseignés. Résultats Quarante-huit hôpitaux ont participé à cette étude (18 hôpitaux universitaires, 2 centres de lutte contre le cancer et 28 centres hospitaliers). Tous sauf un ont reçu des patients COVID-19 au cours du premier semestre 2020 (nombre moyen de patients 454 ;[0–2067]). La consommation totale AF était supérieure en 2020 comparée à 2019 (24,7 DDJ/1000 JH en 2019 versus 28,2 en 2020). Le nombre de JH en réanimation était supérieur durant S1-2020 avec 229 195 JH, comparé à 210 830 JH pour S1-2019. Cependant la consommation AF en réanimation a diminué (154,5 en 2019 vs 149,7 en 2020), notamment pour le fluconazole (56,6 en S1-2019 vs 47,8 en S1-2020) et l’amphotéricine B (41,4 vs 37,9), alors que la consommation a augmenté pour le voriconazole (15,2 à 18,3), posaconazole (3,4 à 4,6), isavuconazole (2,6 vs 3,3) et caspofungine (31,2 vs 35,4). Conclusion La consommation globale en ATF a augmenté dans cette enquête nationale entre S1-2019 et S1-2020, suggérant un impact de la pandémie COVID-19 sur la consommation hospitalière AF. Parallèlement à l’augmentation de l’activité en réanimation sur la même période, nous avons observé une augmentation de la consommation en AF anti-aspergillaires (azolés ciblés) et en échinocandines ;et une diminution de la consommation en fluconazole et en amphotéricine B. Il y a plusieurs biais possibles à cette étude, liés notamment à la difficulté à évaluer l’activité hospitalière et l’annulation des soins pendant la première vague de COVID-19. Cependant, ces données pourraient refléter une sensibilisation des prescripteurs, et notamment des réanimateurs, au risque accru d’IFI (aspergilloses pulmonaires invasives et candidémies) observé chez les patients COVID-19 hospitalisés en réanimation, ayant entraîné des prescriptions AF, soit pour un traitement curatif ciblé, soit pour un traitement empirique et/ou prophylactique.","Lieutier-Colas, F.; Jouzeau, A.; Chabaud, A.; Dumartin, C.; Péfau, M.; Botterel, F.; Alanio, A.; Ranque, S.; Gangneux, J.; Simon, L.",Infectious Diseases Now,,360

355182,Dynamical SEIR Model With Information Entropy Using COVID-19 as a Case Study,2021,"Quantitative analysis of computing systems is an emerging area in automated formal analysis. Such properties address aspects such as costs and rewards, quality measures, resource consumption, distance metrics, etc. Existing solutions for problems in quantitative analysis face two challenges, namely lack of generalizability and separation-of-techniques. Lack of generalizability refers to the issue that solution approaches are specialized to cost model. Different cost models deploy such disparate algorithms that there is no transfer of knowledge from one cost model to another. Separation-of-techniques refers to the inherent dichotomy in solving problems in quantitative analysis. Most algorithms comprise of a structural phase which reasons about the structure of the quantitative system(s) using techniques from automata or graphs, and a numerical phase, which reasons about the quantitative dimension/cost model using numerical methods. The techniques used in both phases are so unlike each other that they are difficult to combine, thereby impacting scalability. This thesis contributes to a novel framework that addresses these challenges. The introduced framework, called comparator automata or comparators in short, builds on automata-theoretic foundations to generalize across a variety of cost models. Comparators enable automata-based methods in the numerical phase, hence eradicating the dependence on numerical methods. In doing so, comparators are able to integrate the structural and numerical phases.

355935,Online Grocery Shopping at Multichannel Supermarkets: The Impact of Retailer Brand Equity,2021,"BACKGROUND: Lung ultrasound (LUS) can be an important imaging tool for the diagnosis and assessment of lung involvement. Ultrasound sonograms have been confirmed to illustrate damage to a person's lungs, which means that the correct classification and scoring of a patient's sonogram can be used to assess lung involvement. METHODS: The purpose of this study was to establish a lung involvement assessment model based on deep learning. A novel multimodal channel and receptive field attention network combined with ResNeXt (MCRFNet) was proposed to classify sonograms, and the network can automatically fuse shallow features and determine the importance of different channels and respective fields. Finally, sonogram classes were transformed into scores to evaluate lung involvement from the initial diagnosis to rehabilitation. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Using multicenter and multimodal ultrasound data from 104 patients, the diagnostic model achieved 94.39% accuracy, 82.28% precision, 76.27% sensitivity, and 96.44% specificity. The lung involvement severity and the trend of COVID-19 pneumonia were evaluated quantitatively.","Hu, Zhaoyu; Liu, Zhenhua; Dong, Yijie; Liu, Jianjian; Huang, Bin; Liu, Aihua; Huang, Jingjing; Pu, Xujuan; Shi, Xia; Yu, Jinhua; Xiao, Yang; Zhang, Hui; Zhou, Jianqiao",Biomed Eng Online,,360

Originating in bats, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is transmitted to humans through unknown intermediate hosts, where it is primarily known to cause pneumonia-like complications in the respiratory system. Organ-to-organ transmission has not been ruled out, thereby raising the possibility of the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on multiple organ systems. The male reproductive system has been hypothesized to be a potential target of SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is supported by some preliminary evidence. This may pose a global threat to male fertility potential, as men are more prone to SARS-CoV-2 infection than women, especially those of reproductive age. Preliminary reports have also indicated the possibility of sexual transmission of SARS-CoV-2. It may cause severe complications in infected couples. This review focuses on the pathophysiology of potential SARS-CoV-2 infection in the reproductive organs of males along with their invasion mechanisms. The risks of COVID-19 on male fertility as well as the differences in vulnerability to SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with females have also been highlighted.","Roychoudhury, Shubhadeep; Das, Anandan; Jha, Niraj Kumar; Kesari, Kavindra Kumar; Roychoudhury, Shatabhisha; Jha, Saurabh Kumar; Kosgi, Raghavender; Choudhury, Arun Paul; Lukac, Norbert; Madhu, Nithar Ranjan; Kumar, Dhruv; Slama, Petr",Open Biol,,360

358146,The Political Economy of Pandemic Response: 3rd Quarter (Update) (preprint),2020,"BACKGROUND: People who use drugs (PWUD) may be at an increased risk of experiencing negative effects related to COVID-19. Border and non-essential service closures may have placed PWUD at an increased risk of experiencing unintended consequences regarding drug consumption and supply patterns, as well as related outcomes. However, the extent of these effects upon this population is unknown. The current study examined how COVID-19 has impacted substance use supply and use characteristics among a national cohort of PWUD in Canada. METHODS: We conducted semi-structured one-on-one telephone-based interviews with 200 adult PWUD across Canada who were currently using a licit or illicit psychoactive substance at least weekly, and/or currently receiving opioid agonist treatment (OAT). Thematic analyses were conducted using qualitative software. RESULTS: PWUD attributed adverse changes to their substance use frequency, supply, use patterns, and risk behaviors and outcomes to COVID-19. Many participants noted supply disruptions with the majority indicating a decrease in potency and availability, and an increase in the price of substances since COVID-19. Nearly half of participants specified that they had increased their substance use, with some experiencing relapses. In terms of changes to risk level, many participants perceived they were at a greater risk for experiencing an overdose. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated the impacts of COVID-19 on PWUD, including a significant disruption substance supply. For many, these changes led to increased use and substitution for toxic and adulterated substances, which ultimately amplified PWUD's risk for experiencing related harms, including overdoses. These findings warrant the need for improved supports and services, as well as accessibility of safe supply programs, take home naloxone kits, and novel approaches to ensure PWUD have the tools necessary to mitigate risk when using substances.","Ali, Farihah; Russell, Cayley; Nafeh, Frishta; Rehm, Jürgen; LeBlanc, Sean; Elton-Marshall, Tara",Int J Drug Policy,,360
358537,"‘We are all just prisoners here of our own device’: The moral challenge of balancing technology, work and capitalistic pursuits",2021,"Undoubtedly, the global pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has had a significant impact on Shared Resource Laboratories (SRL) operations worldwide. Unlike other crises (e.g., natural disasters, acts of war, or terrorism) which often result in a sudden and sustained cessation of scientific research usually affecting one or two cities at a time, this impact is being seen simultaneously in every SRL worldwide albeit to a varying degree. The alterations to SRL operations caused by the COVID-19 pandemic can generally be divided into three categories: (1) complete shutdown, (2) partial shutdown, and (3) uninterrupted operations. In many cases, SRLs that remained partially or fully operational during the initial wave of global infections saw a concurrent increase in COVID-19-related research coming through their facilities. This forced SRLs to make rapid adjustments to core operations at the same time as infectious disease experts were still developing recommendations for the safety of frontline medical workers. Although many SRLs already had contingency plans in place, this pandemic has highlighted the importance of having such plans for continuity of service, if possible, during a crisis. Immediate changes have occurred in the way SRLs operate due to potential virus transmission and in line with this new ""Best Practices"" have been established, that is,social distancing, remote working, and technology-based meetings and training. Many of these changes are likely to be in place for some time with the threat of further waves of infections toward the end of 2020 and into 2021. Some of these best practices, such as having many training resources recorded and available online, are likely to remain long-term. Although many changes have been made in haste, these will alter the future operations of SRLs. In addition, we have learnt how to deal with future crises that may be encountered in the workplace. © 2020 The Authors.

Objectives: To document patterns and costs of ambulatory care in the US before and during the initial stage of the pandemic and to assess how patient, practitioner, community, and COVID-19-related factors are associated with telehealth adoption. Design, Setting, and Participants: This is a cohort study of working-age persons continuously enrolled in private health plans from March 2019 through June 2020. The comparison periods were March to June in 2019 and 2020. Claims data files were provided by Blue Health Intelligence, an independent licensee of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association. Data analysis was performed from June to October 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: Ambulatory encounters (in-person and telehealth) and allowed charges, stratified by characteristics derived from enrollment files, practitioner claims, and community characteristics linked to the enrollee's zip code. Results: A total of 36â¯568â¯010 individuals (mean [SD] age, 35.71 [18.77] years; 18â¯466â¯557 female individuals [50.5%]) were included in the analysis. In-person contacts decreased by 37% (from 1.63 to 1.02 contacts per enrollee) from 2019 to 2020. During 2020, telehealth visits (0.32 visit per person) accounted for 23.6% of all interactions compared with 0.3% of contacts in 2019. When these virtual contacts were added, the overall COVID-19 era patient and practitioner visit rate was 18% lower than that in 2019 (1.34 vs 1.64 visits per person). Behavioral health encounters were far more likely than medical contacts to take place virtually (46.1% vs 22.1%). COVID-19 prevalence in an area was associated with higher use of telehealth; patients from areas within the top quintile of COVID-19 prevalence during the week of their encounter were 1.34 times more likely to have a telehealth visit compared with those in the lowest quintile (the reference category). Persons living in areas with limited social resources were less likely to use telehealth (most vs least socially advantaged neighborhoods, 27.4% vs 19.9% usage rates). Per enrollee medical care costs decreased by 15% between 2019 and 2020 (from $358.32 to $306.04 per person per month). During 2020, those with 1 or more COVID-19-related service (1â¯470â¯721 members) had more than 3 times the medical costs ($1701 vs $544 per member per month) than those without COVID-19-related services. Persons with 1 or more telehealth visits in 2020 had considerably higher costs than persons having only in-person ambulatory contacts ($2214.10 vs $1337.78 for the COVID-19-related subgroup and $735.87 vs $456.41 for the non-COVID-19 subgroup). Conclusions and Relevance: This study of a large cohort of patients enrolled in US health plans documented patterns of care at the onset of COVID-19. The findings are relevant to policy makers, payers, and practitioners as they manage the use of telehealth during the pandemic and afterward.","Weiner, Jonathan P; Bandeian, Stephen; Hatef, Elham; Lans, Daniel; Liu, Angela; Lemke, Klaus W",JAMA Netw Open,,360

366859,Income convergence across the U.S. states: further evidence from new recent data,2020,"We propose a conceptually simple framework for fast COVID-19 screening in 3D chest CT images. The framework can efficiently predict whether or not a CT scan contains pneumonia while simultaneously identifying pneumonia types between COVID-19 and Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) caused by other viruses. In the proposed method, two 3D-ResNets are coupled together into a single model for the two above-mentioned tasks via a novel prior-attention strategy. We extend residual learning with the proposed prior-attention mechanism and design a new so-called prior-attention residual learning (PARL) block. The model can be easily built by stacking the PARL blocks and trained end-to-end using multi-task losses. More specifically, one 3D-ResNet branch is trained as a binary classifier using lung images with and without pneumonia so that it can highlight the lesion areas within the lungs. Simultaneously, inside the PARL blocks, prior-attention maps are generated from this branch and used to guide another branch to learn more discriminative representations for the pneumonia-type classification. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework can significantly improve the performance of COVID-19 screening. Compared to other methods, it achieves a state-of-the-art result. Moreover, the proposed method can be easily extended to other similar clinical applications such as computer-aided detection and diagnosis of pulmonary nodules in CT images, glaucoma lesions in Retina fundus images, etc.","Wang, Jun; Bao, Yiming; Wen, Yaofeng; Lu, Hongbing; Luo, Hu; Xiang, Yunfei; Li, Xiaoming; Liu, Chen; Qian, Dahong",IEEE Trans Med Imaging,,360

Using this data we present a simple deterministic model for influenza dynamics incorporating media effects, and show that such a model helps explain the dynamics of historical influenza outbreaks. Furthermore, through model selection we show that the proposed media function fits historical data better than other media functions proposed in earlier studies.","Mitchell, Lewis; Ross, Joshua V.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.08283v1.pdf,360
367044,Modifying Regulatory Practices to Create a Safe and Effective Working Environment Within a Shared Resource Laboratory During a Global Pandemic,2020,"BackgroundWith over 40 million cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection reported in the US and discussion of both vaccine mandates as well as boosters ongoing, we aim to examine protection conferred by previous infection compared with vaccination so that citizens and policy makers can make informed decisions. ObjectivesTo compare mRNA COVID-19 vaccine-induced immunity against immunity induced by previous infection with SARS-CoV-2 between June and August 2021 when the Delta variant became dominant in the US. We conducted a retrospective observational study comparing two groups whose incident vaccination or infection occurred within the first two months of 2021: (1) SARS-CoV-2-naive individuals who received a full mRNA vaccination - 2 doses of either Pfizer or Moderna vaccine, (2) newly infected individuals who were subdivided into those have not been vaccinated and those have been vaccinated after their infection. Matched multivariable Cox proportional hazards model was applied. We evaluated laboratory (RT-PCR) confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection during follow-up, COVID-related hospitalization, and deaths. SettingVeterans Health Administration (VHA). Main outcomesPositive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test, COVID-related hospitalization, and deaths. Protection was estimated from hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals (CI). ResultsA total of 9,539 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection during the first two months of 2021 were matched to 14,458 and 23,105 patients fully vaccinated with Moderna and Pfizer mRNA vaccines, during the same two months. 3,917 (41%) of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were subsequently vaccinated. We plan to study this group separately. Consequently, protections were estimated among those with infection but were not subsequently vaccinated and those vaccinated with a mRNA vaccine. Among seniors, Moderna and Pfizer mRNA vaccines offered stronger protection against infection, lowering the risk by an additional 66% [HR: 0.34 (95% CI, 0.14-0.78)] and 68% [HR: 0.32 (95% CI, 0.14-0.70)]; stronger protection against hospitalization, lowering the risk by an additional 61% [HR: 0.34 (95% CI, 0.14-0.78)] and 45% [HR: 0.34 (95% CI, 0.14-0.78)]; and stronger protection against deaths lowering the risk by an additional 95% [HR: 0.05 (95% CI, 0.004-0.62)] and 99% [HR: 0.01 (95% CI, 0.001-0.44)]. Among young adults (age < 65), the protections offered by vaccines were statistically equivalent to that provided by previous infection, especially in terms of absolute incidence rate. ConclusionsAmong the elderly (age 65 or older), two-dose mRNA vaccines provided stronger protection against infection, hospitalization, and death, compared to natural immunity. Among young adults (age < 65), the protections offered between natural immunity and vaccine-induced immunity were similar.","Young-Xu, Yinong; Smith, Jeremy; Korves, Caroline",,,360

367909,Suspended Mobility Challenges Real Estate Markets,2020,"Background: Throughout history, the field of medical social work has been shaped by epidemics and pandemics. As COVID-19 rapidly overwhelmed the healthcare system in 2020, oncology departments found that space, staff, and funds were reallocated to address patient needs during the pandemic. Traditional outpatient services were required to operate with reduced resources, with special attention to additional measures to protect workers and patients from exposure to the virus. Little is known about how these changes affected the nature of the practice of oncology social work.Methods: We compared data on OSW interventions for three months (March-May) 2019 to the same period in 2020. Mount Sinai Downtown Cancer Center's Department of Social Work routinely collects data on services provided by social workers using a validated instrument. As NYC became the epicenter of the COVID-19 in March 2020, the comparison of these time periods creates a natural experiment to examine whether and how the presence of the virus impacted the services provided by OSWs.Findings: There was little difference in the number of encounters that took place between the two time periods (2186 encounters in 2019 and 2084 encounters in 2020); however, there were notable differences in the types of interventions. While interventions involving supportive counseling decreased in 2020, we identified a significant increase specific to bereavement counseling.Conclusion: The study shows a remarkable consistency in the volume and types of services provided by OSWs, in spite of the radical increase in stressors they experienced during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings suggest that the OSWs did not allow these stressors to interfere with their work with patients. This study demonstrates how routine use of an instrument to measure OSW interventions can be used to examine services provided over time and to evaluate potential influences of external factors.","Snow, Alison; Handsman, Sarah; Lawton, Brittany; Burruss, Karen; Oktay, Julianne S",J Psychosoc Oncol,,360
368025,A gradient boosting machine learning approach in modeling the impact of temperature and humidity on the transmission rate of COVID-19 in India,2020,"Sepsis is a life-threatening systemic illness attributed to a dysregulated host response to infection. Sepsis is a global burden killing ~11 million persons annually. In December 2019, a novel pneumonia condition termed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged and has resulted in more than 1,535,982 deaths globally as of 8th December 2020. These two conditions share many pathophysiological and clinical features. Notably, both sepsis and COVID-19 patients experience consumptive thrombocytopenia, haemolytic anaemia, vascular microthrombosis, multi-organ dysfunction syndrome, coagulopathy, septic shock, respiratory failure, fever, leukopenia, hypotension, leukocytosis, high cytokine production and high predisposition to opportunistic infections. Considering the parallels in the immunopathogenesis and pathophysiological manifestations of sepsis and COVID-19, it is highly likely that sepsis care, which has a well-established history in most health systems, could inform on COVID-19 management. In view of this, the present perspective compares the immunopathogenesis and pathophysiology of COVID-19 and non-SARS-CoV-2 induced sepsis, and lessons from sepsis that can be applicable to COVID-19 management.","Olwal, Charles Ochieng039; Nganyewo, Nora Nghuchuzie; Tapela, Kesego; Djomkam Zune, Alexandra Lindsey; Owoicho, Oloche; Bediako, Yaw; Duodu, Samuel",Front Immunol,,360
368065,The Value of a Clinical Educator,2021,"For the control of COVID-19, vaccination programmes provide a long-term solution. The amount of available vaccines is often limited, and thus it is crucial to determine the allocation strategy. While mathematical modelling approaches have been used to find an optimal distribution of vaccines, there is an excessively large number of possible schemes to be simulated. Here, we propose an algorithm to find a near-optimal allocation scheme given an intervention objective such as minimization of new infections, hospitalizations, or deaths, where multiple vaccines are available. The proposed principle for allocating vaccines is to target subgroups with the largest reduction in the outcome of interest, such as new infections, due to vaccination that fully immunizes a single individual. We express the expected impact of vaccinating each subgroup in terms of the observed incidence of infection and force of infection. The proposed approach is firstly evaluated with a simulated epidemic and then applied to the epidemiological data on COVID-19 in the Netherlands. Our results reveal how the optimal allocation depends on the objective of infection control. In the case of COVID-19, if we wish to minimize deaths, the optimal allocation strategy is not efficient for minimizing other outcomes, such as infections. In simulated epidemics, an allocation strategy optimized for an outcome outperforms other strategies such as the allocation from young to old, from old to young, and at random. Our simulations clarify that the current policy in the Netherlands (i.e., allocation from old to young) was concordant with the allocation scheme that minimizes deaths. The proposed method provides an optimal allocation scheme, given routine surveillance data that reflect ongoing transmissions. The principle of allocation is useful for providing plausible simulation scenarios for complex models, which give a more robust basis to determine intervention strategies. Author summaryVaccination is the key to controlling the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In the early stages of an epidemic, there is shortage of vaccine stocks. Here, we propose an algorithm that computes an optimal vaccine distribution among groups for each intervention objective (e.g., minimizing new infections, hospitalizations, or deaths). Unlike existing approaches that use detailed information on at-risk contacts between and among groups, the proposed algorithm requires only routine surveillance data on the number of cases. This method is applicable even when multiple vaccines are available. Simulation results show that the allocation scheme optimized by our algorithm performed the best compared with other strategies such as allocating vaccines at random and in the order of age. Our results also reveal that an allocation scheme optimized for one specific objective is not necessarily efficient for another, indicating the importance of the decision-making at the early phase of distributions.","Miura, Fuminari; Leung, Ka Yin; Klinkenberg, Don; Ainslie, Kylie E.C.; Wallinga, Jacco",,,360

However, even socialization efforts have been carried out, the spread of Covid-19 cases still has not yet decreased. Many aspects have to be evaluated to fix the situation. One of them is to evaluate the level of community compliance compared to the spread of Covid-19. This study aims to determine the level of community compliance to stay at home and its correlation with the number of positive cases of Covid-19 in Indonesia. This study takes the data from the tweets of the Indonesian people. The algorithms used are logistic regression and random forest combined with the ensemble algorithm, namely bagging.

It plays an important role in physiological and pathological processes in the human body and its level may be clinically relevant in new onset atrial fibrillation. The aim of this study was to determine whether elevated MR-proANP level is a predictor of new-onset atrial fibrillation in patients with acute myocardial infarction. METHODS AND RESULTS: The study included 96 patients with their first diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction hospitalized in the Department of Interventional Cardiology within one year. The plasma levels of MR-proANP were determined on admission, and on the first and fifth day of hospitalisation by BRAHMS MRproANP KRYPTOR. New onset AF was diagnosed in 9.4% of patients during hospitalisation; the level of MR proANP was also found to be significantly higher in this group of patients compared to those without arrhythmia (p = 0.017). ROC curve analysis indicates that the concentration of MR-proANP is a good predictor of AF diagnosed during the hospitalisation in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AUC = 0.738, p = 0.0011). CONCLUSIONS: MR-proANP might be a good predictor of new-onset atrial fibrillation in patients with acute myocardial infarction.","Karolina, Idzikowska; Michal, Kacprzak; Marzenna, Zielinska",Biomarkers,,360

Type I and III interferon (IFN) responses act as the first line of defense against viral infection and are activated by the recognition of viruses by infected cells and innate immune cells. Dysregulation of host IFN responses has been known to be associated with severe disease progression in COVID-19 patients. However, the reported results are controversial and the roles of IFN responses in COVID-19 need to be investigated further. In the absence of a highly efficacious antiviral drug, clinical studies have evaluated recombinant type I and III IFNs, as they have been successfully used for the treatment of infections caused by two other epidemic coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-1 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV. In this review, we describe the strategies by which SARS-CoV-2 evades IFN responses and the dysregulation of host IFN responses in COVID-19 patients. In addition, we discuss the therapeutic potential of type I and III IFNs in COVID-19.","Choi, Hojun; Shin, Eui Cheol",Yonsei Med J,,360

With the global transmission of the virus, a large number of SARS-CoV-2 variants have also appeared, especially, emerging strains that have recently been discovered in the United Kingdom (variant 20I/501Y.V1, lineage B.1.1.7), South Africa (variant 20H/501Y.V2, lineage B.1.351), and Brazil (variant 20 J/501Y.V3, and lineage P.1). The common feature of these variants is that they share the N501Y mutation involving the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein, which is precisely the target of most COVID-19 vaccines. Furthermore, mutations such as N501Y, E484K, and K417N in the S protein may affect viral fitness and transmissibility. However, current research on the impact of these variants on COVID-19 vaccines is still lacking. Herein, we briefly explain why most COVID-19 vaccines target the S protein, update the progress of research regarding S protein-related COVID-19 vaccines, review the latest studies concerning the effects of S protein variants on COVID-19 vaccines, and finally, propose certain strategies to deal with SARS-CoV-2 variants.","Jia, Zaixing; Gong, Wenping",J Korean Med Sci,,360

We investigated the dynamics of virion movement from a medium toward the interior of insect cells and established a mechanistic model that shows an excellent fit to experimental results. It also makes possible a description of the viral dynamics on the cell surface. A novel measurement method was used to distinguish between infected cells that carry virions on their surfaces, cells that carry virions in their interior, and those carrying virions both inside and on their surface. The maximum number of virions carried by a cell: 55 viruses/cell, and the time required for viral internalization, 0.8 h , are reported. This information is particularly useful for assessing the infection efficacy and the required number of virions needed to infect a given cell population. Although our model specifically concerns the infection process of Sf9 insect cells by baculovirus, it describes general features of viral infection. Some of the model features may eventually be applicable in the studies towards palliation of the COVID-19 outbreak.","Zhang, Youhong; Enden, Giora; Wei, Wei; Zhou, Feng; Chen, Jie; Merchuk, Jose C",Chem Eng Sci,,360

374340,The impact of COVID-19 as a necessary evil on air pollution in India during the lockdown,2020,"BACKGROUND: Severe critical illness-induced immune suppression, termed immunoparalysis, is associated with longer duration of organ dysfunction in septic children. mRNA studies have suggested differential benefit of hydrocortisone in septic children based on their immune phenotype, but this has not been shown using a functional readout of the immune response. This study represents a secondary analysis of a prospectively conducted immunophenotyping study of pediatric severe sepsis to test the hypothesis that hydrocortisone will be differentially associated with clinical outcomes in children with or without immunoparalysis. METHODS: Children with severe sepsis/septic shock underwent blood sampling within 48 h of sepsis onset. Immune function was measured by quantifying whole blood ex vivo LPS-induced TNF&#945; production capacity, with a TNF&#945; response < 200 pg/ml being diagnostic of immunoparalysis. The primary outcome measure was number of days in 14 with MODS. Univariate and multivariable negative binomial regression models were used to examine associations between hydrocortisone use, immune function, and duration of MODS. RESULTS: One hundred two children were enrolled (age 75 [6-160] months, 60% male). Thirty-one subjects received hydrocortisone and were more likely to be older (106 [52-184] vs 38 [3-153] months, p = 0.04), to have baseline immunocompromise (32 vs 8%, p = 0.006), to have higher PRISM III (13 [8-18] vs 7 [5-13], p = 0.0003) and vasoactive inotrope scores (20 [10-35] vs 10 [3-15], p = 0.0002) scores, and to have more MODS days (3 [1-9] vs 1 [0-3], p = 0.002). Thirty-three subjects had immunoparalysis (TNF&#945; response 78 [52-141] vs 641 [418-1047] pg/ml, p < 0.0001). Hydrocortisone use was associated with longer duration of MODS in children with immunoparalysis after adjusting for covariables (aRR 3.7 [1.8-7.9], p = 0.0006) whereas no association with MODS duration was seen in children without immunoparalysis (aRR 1.2 [0.6-2.3], p = 0.67). CONCLUSION: Hydrocortisone use was independently associated with longer duration of MODS in septic children with immunoparalysis but not in those with more robust immune function. Prospective clinical trials using a priori immunophenotyping are needed to understand optimal hydrocortisone strategies in this population.","Bline, Katherine E; Moore-Clingenpeel, Melissa; Hensley, Josey; Steele, Lisa; Greathouse, Kristin; Anglim, Larissa; Hanson-Huber, Lisa; Nateri, Jyotsna; Muszynski, Jennifer A; Ramilo, Octavio; Hall, Mark W",Crit Care,,360

However, data on pre-existing disparities in telemedicine utilization is currently lacking. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to study: (1) the prevalence of outpatient telemedicine visits before the COVID-19 pandemic by patient subgroups based on age, comorbidity burden, residence rurality, and median household income; and (2) associated diagnosis categories. RESEARCH DESIGN: This was a retrospective cohort study. SUBJECT: Commercial claims data from the Truven MarketScan database (2014-2018) representing n=846,461,609 outpatient visits. MEASURES: We studied characteristics and utilization of outpatient telemedicine services before the COVID-19 pandemic by patient subgroups based on age, comorbidity burden, residence rurality, and median household income. Disparities were assessed in unadjusted and adjusted (regression) analyses. RESULTS: With overall telemedicine uptake of 0.12% (n=1,018,092/846,461,609 outpatient visits) we found that pre-COVID-19 disparities in telemedicine use became more pronounced over time with lower use in patients who were older, had more comorbidities, were in rural areas, and had lower median household incomes (all trends and effect estimates P<0.001). CONCLUSION: These results contextualize pre-existing disparities in telemedicine use and are crucial in the monitoring of potential disparities in telemedicine access and subsequent outcomes after the rapid expansion of telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Poeran, Jashvant; Cho, Logan D; Wilson, Lauren; Zhong, Haoyan; Mazumdar, Madhu; Liu, Jiabin; Memtsoudis, Stavros G",Med Care,,360

375623,The Constrained Air Transport Energy Paradigm in 2021,2021,"In this study, we adopt an ecological perspective to reflect on how a specific Italian school cluster adapted to the challenges of the COVID‐19 pandemic by focusing on how students experienced the interplay between continuity and change in school teaching and learning practices caused by the pandemic. Specifically, the study investigates how the school's physical/virtual learning system was (re)configured to provide new opportunities for learning to a thousand‐plus population of primary and secondary students, and how they reacted to the transition to distance learning in terms of participation, autonomy, motivation and engagement. The research adopts a mixed method approach, based on school management system data and a survey tool, and analyses the students’ response to the emergency from the perspectives of the students themselves, their teachers and their parents. While these converged in positive evaluation of the experience, a number of lessons were learnt, such as the importance of building on favourable pre‐existing conditions and leveraging a solid shared school culture to promote a prompt reaction to the emergency. Significantly, students with an immigrant background displayed varying degrees of participation in online activities. Overall, for each of the three stakeholder groups surveyed, solid pre‐existing digital competence levels and close collaboration within the school community were the most important factors for non‐traumatic transition to distance learning. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic? Research on the relationship between the COVID‐19 pandemic and the effects on teaching and learning processes is constantly increasing. Most recently published studies focus on higher education, while very few investigate the impact of the COVID‐19 pandemic on K‐12 education. Very few papers have studied the interplay between change and continuity within an educational ecosystem in times of crisis. What this paper adds? This is one of the first studies to analyse the process of systematic transition from onsite learning to online learning within the Italian school system in response to the pandemic. This study employs a multiple perspective research approach to analyse Emergency Remote Education in a sizeable school cluster, with a specific focus on student response. Teachers, students and their families all saw solid pre‐existing digital competence and close school community collaboration as key factors facilitating rapid adjustment to the emergency. Implications for practice and policy Having a solid common school culture to rely on facilitates prompt emergency reaction. Encouraging the creation of professional communities of practice that comprise both expert and novice teachers can help prepare educators to deal with an educational emergency through adoption and appropriate use of technological solutions. Collaboration between school and families proves to be a key factor for dealing with emergencies. What is already known about this topic?

375788,#FlattenTheCurve,2020,"Traditional Indian medical practices (Ayurveda, Siddha, Unani, and homeopathy) are a vast reservoir of knowledge about medicinal plants. The promising pharmacological properties of these plants have paved the way for developing therapy against novel Coronavirus (CoV) infection. The current review will summarize published works of literature on the effects of traditional Indian medicinal plants against acute respiratory infection (COVID-19, SARS, Influenza, and Respiratory syncytial virus infection) and registered clinical trials of traditional Indian herbal medicines in COVID-19. The current study aims to comprehensively evaluate the data of traditional Indian medicinal plants to warrant their use in COVID-19 management. PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases were searched along with different clinical trial databases. A total of 22 relevant traditional Indian medicinal plants (35 relevant studies) were included in the current study having potential antiviral properties against virus-induced respiratory illness along with promising immunomodulatory and thrombolytic properties. Further, 36 randomized and nonrandomized registered clinical trials were also included that were aimed at evaluating the efficacy of herbal plants or their formulations in COVID-19 management. The antiviral, immunomodulatory, and thrombolytic activities of the traditional Indian medicinal plants laid down a strong rationale for their use in developing therapies against SARS-CoV-2 infection. The study identified some important potential traditional Indian medicinal herbs such as Ocimum tenuiflorum, Tinospora cordifolia, Achyranthes bidentata, Cinnamomum cassia, Cydonia oblonga, Embelin ribes, Justicia adhatoda, Momordica charantia, Withania somnifera, Zingiber officinale, Camphor, and Kabusura kudineer, which could be used in therapeutic strategies against SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Singh, Rahul Soloman; Singh, Ashutosh; Kaur, Harpinder; Batra, Gitika; Sarma, Phulen; Kaur, Hardeep; Bhattacharyya, Anusuya; Sharma, Amit Raj; Kumar, Subodh; Upadhyay, Sujata; Tiwari, Vinod; Avti, Pramod; Prakash, Ajay; Medhi, Bikash",Phytother. res,,360

376043,Peran Generasi Muda Dalam Era New Normal,2020,"Stress is a physiological state that hampers mental health and has serious consequences to physical health. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic has increased stress levels among people across the globe. Therefore, continuous monitoring and detection of stress are necessary. The recent advances in wearable devices have allowed the monitoring of several physiological signals related to stress. Among them, wrist-worn wearable devices like smartwatches are most popular due to their convenient usage. And the photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor is the most prevalent sensor in almost all consumer-grade wrist-worn smartwatches. Therefore, this paper focuses on using a wrist-based PPG sensor that collects Blood Volume Pulse (BVP) signals to detect stress which may be applicable for consumer-grade wristwatches. Moreover, state-of-the-art works have used either classical machine learning algorithms to detect stress using hand-crafted features or have used deep learning algorithms like Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) which automatically extracts features. This paper proposes a novel hybrid CNN (H-CNN) classifier that uses both the hand-crafted features and the automatically extracted features by CNN to detect stress using the BVP signal. Evaluation on the benchmark WESAD dataset shows that, for 3-class classification (Baseline vs. Stress vs. Amusement), our proposed H-CNN outperforms traditional classifiers and normal CNN by 5% and 7% accuracy, and 10% and 7% macro F1 score, respectively. Also for 2-class classification (Stress vs. Non-stress), our proposed H-CNN outperforms traditional classifiers and normal CNN by 3% and ~5% accuracy, and ~3% and ~7% macro F1 score, respectively.","Rashid, N.; Chen, L.; Dautta, M.; Jimenez, A.; Tseng, P.; Faruque, M.

Treatment generally requires the administration of high doses of these mAbs with limited efficacy in preventing disease complications or mortality among hospitalized COVID-19 patients5. Here we report the development and evaluation of Fc-optimized anti-SARS-CoV-2 mAbs with superior potency to prevent or treat COVID-19 disease. In several animal models of COVID-19 disease6,7, we demonstrate that selective engagement of activating FcgammaRs results in improved efficacy in both preventing and treating disease-induced weight loss and mortality, significantly reducing the dose required to confer full protection upon SARS-CoV-2 challenge and treatment of pre-infected animals. Our results highlight the importance of FcgammaR pathways in driving antibody-mediated antiviral immunity, while excluding any pathogenic or disease-enhancing effects of FcgammaR engagement of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies upon infection. These findings have important implications for the development of Fc-engineered mAbs with optimal Fc effector function and improved clinical efficacy against COVID-19 disease.","Ravetch, J.; Yamin, R.; Jones, A.; Hoffmann, H.

378681,"Imprints of COVID-19 lockdown on the surface water quality of Bagmati river basin, Nepal",2021,"A new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is a global threat to world health and economy. Its dimeric main protease (Mpro), which is required for the proteolytic cleavage of viral precursor proteins, is a good candidate for drug development owing to its conservation and the absence of a human homolog. Improving our understanding of Mpro behavior can accelerate the discovery of effective therapies to reduce mortality. All-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations (100 ns) of 50 mutant Mpro dimers obtained from filtered sequences from the GISAID database were analyzed using root-mean-square deviation, root-mean-square fluctuation, Rg, averaged betweenness centrality, and geometry calculations. The results showed that SARS-CoV-2 Mpro essentially behaves in a similar manner to its SAR-CoV homolog. However, we report the following new findings from the variants: (1) Residues GLY15, VAL157, and PRO184 have mutated more than once in SARS CoV-2; (2) the D48E variant has lead to a novel ""TSEEMLN"""" loop at the binding pocket; (3) inactive apo Mpro does not show signs of dissociation in 100 ns MD; (4) a non-canonical pose for PHE140 widens the substrate binding surface; (5) dual allosteric pockets coinciding with various stabilizing and functional components of the substrate binding pocket were found to display correlated compaction dynamics; (6) high betweenness centrality values for residues 17 and 128 in all Mpro samples suggest their high importance in dimer stability-one such consequence has been observed for the M17I mutation whereby one of the N-fingers was highly unstable. (7) Independent coarse-grained Monte Carlo simulations suggest a relationship between the rigidity/mutability and enzymatic function. Our entire approach combining database preparation, variant retrieval, homology modeling, dynamic residue network (DRN), relevant conformation retrieval from 1-D kernel density estimates from reaction coordinates to other existing approaches of structural analysis, and data visualization within the coronaviral Mpro is also novel and is applicable to other coronaviral proteins.","Sheik Amamuddy, Olivier; Verkhivker, Gennady M; Tastan Bishop, Özlem",J Chem Inf Model,,360
378682,"Imprints of COVID-19 lockdown on the surface water quality of Bagmati river basin, Nepal",2021,"BackgroundVaccination against COVID-19 is the cornerstone to control and mitigate the ongoing pandemic. Thrombotic adverse events linked to Moderna, Pfizer and the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine have been documented and described as extremely rare. While the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine has received much of the attention, the other vaccines should not go unchallenged. This study aimed to determine the frequency of reported thrombotic adverse events and clinical outcomes for these three COVID-19 vaccines, namely, Moderna, Pfizer and Oxford-AstraZeneca MethodsA retrospective descriptive analysis was conducted of spontaneous reports for Moderna, Pfizer and Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccines submitted to the EudraVigilance database in the period from 17 February to 14 June 2021. FindingsThere were 729,496 adverse events for the three vaccines, of which 3,420 were thrombotic, mainly Oxford-AstraZeneca (n=1,988, 58{middle dot}1%) followed by Pfizer (n=1,096, 32{middle dot}0%) and Moderna (n=336, 9{middle dot}8%). As serious adverse events, there were 705 reports of pulmonary embolism for the three vaccines, of which 130 reports (18{middle dot}4%) were for Moderna, 226 reports (32{middle dot}1%) for Pfizer and 349 (49{middle dot}5%) for Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines. The occurrence of pulmonary embolism is significantly associated with a fatal outcome (P=<0{middle dot}001). Sixty-three fatalities were recorded (63/3420, 1.8%), of which Moderna (n=6), Pfizer (n=25) and Oxford-AstraZeneca (n=32). InterpretationThrombotic adverse events reported for the three vaccines remains extremely rare with multiple causative factors reported elsewhere as precipitating these events. Practicing vigilance and proper clinical management for the affected vaccines, as well as continuing to report adverse events, are essential. FundingNo funding was sought for this study. Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSDuring the first quarter of 2021, several European countries suspended the use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine amid reports of blood clot events and the death of a vaccinated person. This was followed by several reports of fatalities related to pulmonary embolism and other thrombotic events including thrombocytopenia which has been referred to as vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT). The European Medicines Agency on 18 March 2021 concluded that the Oxford- AstraZeneca vaccine was safe, effective and the benefits outweighed the risks. Added value of this studyThis study investigated the occurrence of thrombotic adverse events and their clinical outcomes of the three approved and most used COVID-19 vaccines namely Moderna, Pfizer and Oxford-AstraZeneca, using one of the largest spontaneous adverse events databases, namely EudraVigilance. Out of 729,496 adverse events reported for the three vaccines in the study period, only 3420 (0.47%) potential thrombotic adverse events were reported, the majority associated with Oxford-AstraZeneca (n=1,988, 58.1%). Implications of all the available evidenceMore than 4{middle dot}89 billion doses of different COVID-19 vaccines have been administered across the globe. Despite thrombotic adverse events reported for the three vaccines in focus for this study - Moderna, Pfizer and Oxford-AstraZeneca - being extremely rare, so continuing to report adverse events is essential. On the basis of scientific evidence showing that benefit outweighs risk, people continue to be urged to accept the vaccination when offered.","Tobaiqy, Mansour; MacLure, Katie; Elkout, Hajer; Stewart, Derek",,,360
379544,Two Advanced Models of the Function of MRT Public Transportation in Taipei,2021,"Anosmia and hypogeusia, the inability or decreased ability to smell and taste, have been reported as common complaints in SARS-CoV-2 patients who were still in an asymptomatic phase. These impairments affect the ability to sense odors in foods and the environment, obviously affecting quality of life, related to social interactions and general well-being. The British Association of Otorhinolaryngology (ENT-UK) considers loss of sense of smell in their list of COVID-19's markers of infection. Here we present two cases in which early manifestations of anosmia and hypogeusia were experienced with psycho-sensorial and atmospheric phenomena. Psychiatrists, neurologists and physicians in general should be aware of this symptom presentation in order to avoid mistreatment, given that persistent olfactory dysfunction might increase the risks of nutritional deficit and lead to development of adjustment disorders. All clinicians should be aware that the presentation of SARS-CoV-2's symptoms goes far beyond respiratory and sensorial dimensions and involves psychosensorial and neurological dimensions; these clinical observations could shed light on the neurobiological substrates involved in COVID-19 disease.","Pallanti, Stefano",Compr Psychiatry,,360
380261,Conclusion,2021,"COVID-19 has revealed social and health inequities in the United States. Structural inequalities have increased the likelihood of immigrants contracting COVID-19, by being essential workers and through poverty that forces this population to continue working. Rural and urban immigrant families may face different concerns. Using a telephone survey in May 2020 of 105 Latinx families in an existing study, quantitative and qualitative data were gathered on work and household economics, childcare and education, healthcare, and community climate. Analyses show that, although rural and urban groups experienced substantial economic effects, impacts were more acute for urban families. Rural workers reported fewer workplace protective measures for COVID-19. For both groups, fear and worry, particularly about finances and children, dominated reports of their situations with numerous reports of experiencing stress and anxiety. The experience of the pandemic is interpreted as an example of contextual vulnerability of a population already experiencing structural violence through social injustice. Policy implications are highlighted.","Quandt, Sara A; LaMonto, Natalie J; Mora, Dana C; Talton, Jennifer W; Laurienti, Paul J; Arcury, Thomas A",New Solut,,360
380262,Conclusion,2021,"Keywords: COVID-19, Hypercoagulability, Thromboembolism, Coagulation The 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has spread rapidly, infecting millions of people in a matter of months 1 While COVID-19 is commonly linked to severe pneumonia often progressing to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a new feature of the disease has come to light 2 A remarkably high number of COVID-19 patients are presenting with a deranged coagulation profile resulting in a hypercoagulable state 1-10 The coagulation defect noted in this population has been linked to an increased risk of thrombotic complications as well as poor prognosis 2,4,6,7 Proposed mechanisms behind the coagulopathy include severe inflammation, hypoxia, immobilization, and diffuse intravascular coagulation (DIC) In a study from China by Tang et al , coagulation tests were retrospectively reviewed in 183 consecutive patients infected with COVID-19 4 Findings revealed that non-survivors of the disease had significantly higher D-dimer, fibrin degradation products (FDPs), and longer prothrombin times (PT) compared to those of survivors on admission 4 The authors state that the use of these conventional coagulation tests may be beneficial in guiding treatment and that they may be directly related to patient prognosis 4 Additional findings included significantly lower fibrinogen and antithrombin (AT) levels during late hospitalization 4 It was also noted that 71 4% of non-survivors met criteria for overt disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), making it a common feature of severe disease in this cohort 4 Physicians at a hospital in Milan, Italy observed a number of patients developing deep vein thromboses (DVTs) and pulmonary embolisms (PEs), while lacking the presence of DIC as described by Tang et al 4,6 Panigada et al decided to create their own study utilizing a thromboelastography (TEG) point of care device as well as conventional coagulation testing 6 The study included 24 intubated COVID-19 patients who were randomly selected from those admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) 6 Collective TEG results revealed a significant state of hypercoagulability, which may provide explanation for the frequency of DVTs and PEs seen within their facility Thromboelastometry profiles were similar to those observed by Panigada et al , as faster clot formation times and higher maximum clot firmness seen were consistent with a hypercoagulable state 6,7 Spieza et al mentions 23% of the patients in the study developed DVTs, even while being treated with prophylactic anticoagulation 7 While neither of these studies support the notion of consumption coagulopathy as described by Tang et al , they do share the finding of markedly high D-dimer levels, supporting the conclusion that elevated D-dimer is an independent risk factor for severe disease 4,6,7 The hypercoagulability described in both reports may also support the use of antithrombotic drugs in this population as a method to prevent thromboembolic complications 6,7 Han et al sought to evaluate the differences among blood coagulation parameters between COVID-19 patients and healthy controls in order to provide insight into their ability to predict progression of the disease 10 The study involved 94 patients from a Wuhan China hospital with positive COVID-19 diagnosis and 40 healthy patients for the control group 10 Compared to the control group, COVID-19 patients presented with significantly lower AT values and significantly higher FDP and D-dimer values 10 After confirming findings from previous studies, the cohort of COVID-19 positive patients was split into three groups classified as ordinary, severe, or critical states of disease 4,6,7,10 D-dimer and FDP values were found to be significantly higher in the severe disease group when compared to the mild disease group 10 This finding highlights potential benefits of D-dimer and FDP monitoring in predicting the progression of COVID-19 disease 10 Fogarty et al considers how ethnicity plays a significant role in coagulation, and that Chinese are 3-4 times less likely to experience venous thromboembolism (VTE) when compared to Caucasians 2 In fact, VTE prophylaxis is far less prevalent in China for this reason 2 Researchers designed a study to determine whether coagulopathic features differ between Chinese and Caucasian patients 2 The cohort consisted of 83 COVID-19 positive patients recruited from St James Hospital in Dublin, Ireland Eighty-one percent of patients were Caucasian, 12% Asian, and 6% African 2 Blood tests were performed on admission revealing significantly increased D-dimer, fibrinogen, and C-reactive protein levels 2 The cohort was next divided into two groups based on patients who were discharged and those requiring ICU admission 2 D-dimer, CRP, and fibrinogen levels on admission were found to be significantly higher in the groups requiring ICU level care 2 Unlike Tang et al , DIC was not identified within the cohort and platelet levels remained within a normal range 4,2 The lack of DIC development is hypothesized to be related to the use of pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis, which was utilized in all patients within this cohort 10 Significant hypercoagulability related to severity of disease was, however, similar to that seen in Chinese cohorts 2,4,10 Incidence of Thromboembolism The hypercoagulable state described in previous studies has been found to leave patients with COVID-19 infections at increased risk for

OR, ""ALL PERSONS ARE EQUAL BUT SOME PERSONS ARE MORE EQUAL THAN OTHERS""?",2020,"INTRODUCTION: Diabetic ketoacidosis is the most important metabolic emergency in children. Children mimic many syndromes with a combination of nonspecific symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many syndromes are triggered by changes in children's body conditions. Reporting specific cases can improve the diagnosis process. The present study reports an 18-month-old paediatric case of COVID-19 who presented ketoacidosis (DKA) symptoms. CASE PRESENTATION: The case is an 18-month-old child with fever and diarrhoea from 3 days before, who did not respond to outpatient treatment. On the day of the visit, he suffered from deep and abdominal breathing and decreased level of consciousness and sugar levels at admission of 420 mg/dl. He was then admitted with the initial diagnosis of DKA and had a positive PCR test result for COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Considering the non-specific symptoms of COVID-19, general practitioners and paediatricians are recommended that special attention be paid to these symptoms, especially those that are similar to life-threatening syndromes. They also should not easily ignore these symptoms and follow up patients and their recovery status and, if patients do not recover, consider the risk of COVID-19 given the current COVID-19 pandemic.","Akbarizadeh, Majidreza; Naderifar, Mahin; Ghanizadegan, Parisa; Akbarizadeh, Mahshid",Pediatr.

Due to the diversity of bacteria and yeast strains, strict approaches have been designed to assess for side effects and post-market surveillance. One of the most essential delivery systems of probiotics is within food, due to the great beneficial health effects of this system compared to pharmaceutical products and also due to the increasing importance of food and nutrition. Modern lifestyle or various diseases lead to an imbalance of the intestinal flora.

Methods: We employed a longitudinal design. We recruited participants for an online panel survey from chat groups on social media platforms. There were 5 waves of interviews. Information on uncertainty stress and related variables were collected via the online survey. Descriptive statistics and the GIM program were used for data analysis. Results: Participants numbered 150 for the linkable baseline survey and 102 (68%) for the final survey. Uncertainty stress (ß = -.047, SE = .118, p > .05) did not show a statistically significant temporal change trend over the observation period. Disease fear manifested a statistically significant downwards trend (ß = -.342, SE = .157, p < .05), and prevention behaviors indicated an upwards trend (ß = .048, SE = .021, p < .05) during the observation period. Uncertainty stress was positively associated with disease fear (ß = .45046, SE = .05964, p < .001), and negatively associated with self-efficacy (ß = -.6698, SE = .01035, p < .001), and prevention behaviors (ß = -.02029, SE = .00876, p =.021). Conclusion: This study yielded new information about uncertainty stress among Chinese people during the COVID-19 epidemic. Policy changes and public education are essential for minimizing the negative effects of uncertainty stress in disease prevention.","Peng, Sihui; Yang, Xiaozhao Yousef; Yang, Tingzhong; Zhang, Weifang; Cottrell, Randall R",Am J Health Behav,,360
382731,"“The More Things Change, the More They Stay the Same”: Research on Gang-Related Violence in the 21st Century—Introduction to Special Issue",2021,"AIM: to compare clinical features and outcome of children with severe acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) with or without SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted to Paediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU). METHODS: for this retrospective cohort study, all children aged<17 years admitted with severe ALRI at a PICU, in Salvador, Brazil were evaluated. Investigation of SARS-CoV-2 infection was performed by real-time reverse-transcription PCR. Clinical data, physical findings upon admission and outcome were registered. Patients were categorized by with or without SARS-Cov-2 infection. Outcomes were death and invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). RESULTS: we enrolled 210 patients, whose median age was 2.8 years (IQR: 7.1 months-6.2 years). IMV was used in 33 (15.7%; 95%CI 11.3%-21.1%) patients. Eight (3.8%; 95%CI 1.8%-7.1%) cases died. 62 patients (29.5%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Male gender (67.7% vs. 52.7%, P = 0.045) and sickle cell disease (6.5% vs. 0%, P = 0.007) were associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Wheezing upon admission was more common in patients without SARS-CoV-2 infection (38.5% vs. 21.0%, P = 0.01). IMV was more frequent among patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection (25.8% vs. 11.5%, P = 0.009) as well as death (8.1% vs. 2.0%, P = 0.05). CONCLUSION: children with severe ALRI infection with SARS-CoV-2 need IMV more frequently than those without it.","Lorenzo, Vivian Botelho; Nascimento-Carvalho, Cristiana M",J Infect,,360
382882,An Unsupervised Machine Learning Approach to Assess the ZIP Code Level Impact of COVID-19 in NYC,2020-06-11,"BACKGROUND: Closed reduction and percutaneous pinning (CRPP) of supracondylar humeral fractures is one of the most common procedures performed in pediatric orthopaedics. The use of full, standard preparation and draping with standard personal protective equipment (PPE) may not be necessary during this procedure. This is of particular interest in the current climate as we face unprecedented PPE shortages due to the current COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This is a retrospective chart review of 1,270 patients treated with CRPP of a supracondylar humeral fracture at 2 metropolitan pediatric centers by 10 fellowship-trained pediatric orthopaedic surgeons. One surgeon in the group did not wear a mask when performing CRPP of supracondylar humeral fractures, and multiple surgeons in the group utilized a semisterile preparation technique (no sterile gown or drapes). Infectious outcomes were compared between 2 groups: full sterile preparation and semisterile preparation. We additionally analyzed a subgroup of patients who had semisterile preparation without surgeon mask use. Hospital cost data were used to estimate annual cost savings with the adoption of the semisterile technique. RESULTS: In this study, 1,270 patients who underwent CRPP of a supracondylar humeral fracture and met inclusion criteria were identified. There were 3 deep infections (0.24%). These infections all occurred in the group using full sterile preparation and surgical masks. No clinically relevant pin-track infections were noted. There were no known surgeon occupational exposures to bodily fluid. It is estimated that national adoption of this technique in the United States could save between 18,612 and 22,162 gowns and masks with costs savings of $3.7 million to $4.4 million annually. CONCLUSIONS: We currently face critical shortages of PPE due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Data from this large series suggest that a semisterile technique during CRPP of supracondylar humeral fractures is a safe practice. We anticipate that this could preserve approximately 20,000 gowns and masks in the United States over the next year. Physicians are encouraged to reevaluate their daily practice to identify safe opportunities for resource preservation. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic Level III.

First, it goes beyond the current debate on whether individual- or organisational-level interventions are most effective in improving employee health and well-being and tests the cumulative effects of multilevel interventions, that is, interventions addressing individual, group, leader and organisational levels. Second, it tailors its interventions to address the aftermaths of the Covid-19 pandemic and develop suitable multilevel interventions for dealing with new ways of working. Third, it uses realist evaluation to explore and identify the working ingredients of and the conditions required for each level of intervention, and their outcomes. Finally, an economic evaluation will assess both the cost-effectiveness analysis and the affordability of the interventions from the employer perspective.

384390,Unveiling Women’s Needs and Expectations as Users of Bike Sharing Services: The H2020 DIAMOND Project,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic led to a digital evolution in the healthcare industry by necessitating widespread adoption of telehealth and other remote services to enable engagement with patients. Diabetes management is well suited for telehealth utilization if patients employ technology that efficiently generates, captures, and shares data with providers. Traditionally, training for automated insulin delivery devices is provided in-person to allow for a thorough understanding of the device and its use. However, during COVID-related quarantine regulations, most of these trainings needed to be conducted virtually. We performed a retrospective analysis of patient reported outcomes in people with diabetes who completed their training for the t:slim X2 pump with Control-IQ technology between April and September, 2020 and had uploaded 30 days of pump usage data to Tandem’s t:connect® web application. Most participants were adults (90%), female (54%), and had type 1 diabetes (89.9%). Mean age of the sample was 46 years (SD=18.7). Of all 1,686 participants, 1,256 had received virtual pump training while the remaining were trained in-person (n=430). Most participants reported completing their training in 1 to 2 hours (61.5%). After concluding training, participants completed an online questionnaire evaluating their training experience (8 items). Item response options included a 5-point Likert scale with higher values reflecting greater satisfaction and better experience with training. Multivariate analysis of variance indicated a significant effect of training method (virtual vs. in-person) on training-related experience (p=.020). Specifically, participants receiving virtual pump training reported greater overall satisfaction with their training (4.78 vs. 4.65, p=.012) and with the time when their training was conducted (convenient scheduling) (4.74 vs. 4.56, p=.008) compared to their counterparts who underwent in-person training. There were no significant differences between virtually trained and in-person participants on pace of training (4.71 vs. 4.57), trainer’s pump knowledge (4.82 vs. 4.74), trainer’s ability to answer their questions (4.77 vs. 4.70), and participants’ confidence to use the pump after training (4.62 vs. 4.53). In conclusion, all participants irrespective of their training method (virtual or in-person) reported a positive experience with their training for using the t:slim X2 pump with Control-IQ technology. Participants’ high scores on items evaluating their training method also reflects that their expectations of their training session were either met or exceeded. State-of-the-art technologies supporting diabetes management may benefit from patient-centric training methods to enable widespread optimal use. For future studies, it will be interesting to evaluate adherence to therapy by training method and relationship with glycemic outcomes.","Singh, Harsimran Manning Michelle McElwee-Malloy Molly Habif Steph",Journal of the Endocrine Society,,360

Five kinds of haloacetic acids(HAAs), including monochloroacetic acid, dichloroacetic acid, trichloroacetic acid, monobromoacetic acid, and dibromoacetic acid, were studied. According to the EU Technical Guidance Document on Risk Assessment, the values of PNEC of 5 HAAs were derived in the water and sediment with the toxicity data of native species in China using assessment factors and equilibrium method,respectively. The results show that the acute and chronic toxicity of the 5 HAAs to aquatic organism were both in the order of monobromoacetic acid &gt; monochloroacetic acid &gt;dichloroacetic acid &gt; trichloroacetic acid &gt; dibromoacetic acid. The PNEC values of five HAAs for water(PNECw) were 0.025,0.030,0.060,0.016 and 1.956 mg/L,respectively;for sediment(PNECs) are 0.021,0.026,0.057,0.013 and 1.679 mg/kg(by wet weigh),respectively.

We summarize the existing literature on this topic. An association between the provision of grandchild care and reduced feelings of loneliness was found in cross-sectional studies; however, a longitudinal study identified possible gender differences in the impact of grandchild care on feelings of loneliness, with the commencement of grandchild care linked to grandfathers feeling lonelier. At the conclusion of the summary, we highlight the need for further research in this field.

On July 2, 2020, the governor of Kansas issued an executive order (state mandate), effective July 3, requiring masks or other face coverings in public spaces. CDC and the Kansas Department of Health and Environment analyzed trends in county-level COVID-19 incidence before (June 1-July 2) and after (July 3-August 23) the governor's executive order among counties that ultimately had a mask mandate in place and those that did not. As of August 11, 24 of Kansas's 105 counties did not opt out of the state mandate§ or adopted their own mask mandate shortly before or after the state mandate was issued; 81 counties opted out of the state mandate, as permitted by state law, and did not adopt their own mask mandate. After the governor's executive order, COVID-19 incidence (calculated as the 7-day rolling average number of new daily cases per 100,000 population) decreased (mean decrease of 0.08 cases per 100,000 per day; net decrease of 6%) among counties with a mask mandate (mandated counties) but continued to increase (mean increase of 0.11 cases per 100,000 per day; net increase of 100%) among counties without a mask mandate (nonmandated counties). The decrease in cases among mandated counties and the continued increase in cases in nonmandated counties adds to the evidence supporting the importance of wearing masks and implementing policies requiring their use to mitigate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 (1-6). Community-level mitigation strategies emphasizing wearing masks, maintaining physical distance, staying at home when ill, and enhancing hygiene practices can help reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2.","Van Dyke, Miriam E; Rogers, Tia M; Pevzner, Eric; Satterwhite, Catherine L; Shah, Hina B; Beckman, Wyatt J; Ahmed, Farah; Hunt, D Charles; Rule, John",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,360
385454,Measuring Economic Policy Uncertainty Using an Unsupervised Word Embedding-based Method,2021-05-10,"Primary health care offers a cost-effective route to achieving universal health coverage (UHC). However, primary health-care systems are weak in many low- and middle-income countries and often fail to provide comprehensive, people-centred, integrated care. We analysed the primary health-care systems in 20 low- and middle-income countries using a semi-grounded approach. Options for strengthening primary health-care systems were identified by thematic content analysis. We found that: (i) despite the growing burden of noncommunicable disease, many low- and middle-income countries lacked funds for preventive services; (ii) community health workers were often under-resourced, poorly supported and lacked training; (iii) out-of-pocket expenditure exceeded 40% of total health expenditure in half the countries studied, which affected equity; and (iv) health insurance schemes were hampered by the fragmentation of public and private systems, underfunding, corruption and poor engagement of informal workers. In 14 countries, the private sector was largely unregulated. Moreover, community engagement in primary health care was weak in countries where services were largely privatized. In some countries, decentralization led to the fragmentation of primary health care. Performance improved when financial incentives were linked to regulation and quality improvement, and community involvement was strong. Policy-making should be supported by adequate resources for primary health-care implementation and government spending on primary health care should be increased by at least 1% of gross domestic product. Devising equity-enhancing financing schemes and improving the accountability of primary health-care management is also needed. Support from primary health-care systems is critical for progress towards UHC in the decade to 2030.","Langlois, Etienne V; McKenzie, Andrew; Schneider, Helen; Mecaskey, Jeffrey W",Bull World Health Organ,,360

386020,Virtual site visits: a new approach to nursing accreditation,2020,"OBJECTIVES: Using participatory health informatics (PHI) to detect disease outbreaks or learn about pandemics has gained interest in recent years. However, the role of PHI in understanding and managing pandemics, citizens' role in this context, and which methods are relevant for collecting and processing data are still unclear, as is which types of data are relevant. This paper aims to clarify these issues and explore the role of PHI in managing and detecting pandemics. METHODS: Through a literature review we identified studies that explore the role of PHI in detecting and managing pandemics. Studies from five databases were screened: PubMed, CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), IEEE Xplore, ACM (Association for Computing Machinery) Digital Library, and Cochrane Library. Data from studies fulfilling the eligibility criteria were extracted and synthesized narratively. RESULTS: Out of 417 citations retrieved, 53 studies were included in this review. Most research focused on influenza-like illnesses or COVID-19 with at least three papers on other epidemics (Ebola, Zika or measles). The geographic scope ranged from global to concentrating on specific countries. Multiple processing and analysis methods were reported, although often missing relevant information. The majority of outcomes are reported for two application areas: crisis communication and detection of disease outbreaks. CONCLUSIONS: For most diseases, the small number of studies prevented reaching firm conclusions about the utility of PHI in detecting and monitoring these disease outbreaks. For others, e.g., COVID-19, social media and online search patterns corresponded to disease patterns, and detected disease outbreak earlier than conventional public health methods, thereby suggesting that PHI can contribute to disease and pandemic monitoring.","Gabarron, Elia; Rivera-Romero, Octavio; Miron-Shatz, Talya; Grainger, Rebecca; Denecke, Kerstin",Yearb. med. inform.

386041,The political economy of the European Union,2020,"BACKGROUND: Clinically, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with a wide range of symptoms, which can range from mild complaints of an upper respiratory infection to life-threatening hypoxic respiratory insufficiency and multiorgan failure. OBJECTIVE: The initially identified pulmonary damage patterns, such as diffuse alveolar damage in acute lung failure, are accompanied by new findings that draw a more complex scenario. These include microvascular involvement and a wide range of associated pathologies of multiple organ systems. A back-scaling of microstructural vascular changes is possible via targeted correlation of pathological autopsy results with radiological imaging. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Radiological and pathological correlation as well as microradiological imaging to investigate microvascular involvement in fatal COVID-19. RESULTS: The cases of two COVID-19 patients are presented. Patient 1 showed a relative hypoperfusion in lung regions that did not have typical COVID-19 infiltrates; the targeted post-mortem correlation also showed subtle signs of microvascular damage even in these lung sections. Patient 2 showed both radiologically and pathologically advanced typical COVID-19 destruction of lung structures and the case illustrates the damage patterns of the blood-air barrier. The perfusion deficit of the intestinal wall shown in computed tomography of patient 2 could not ultimately clearly be microscopically attributed to intestinal microvascular damage. CONCLUSION: In addition to microvascular thrombosis, our results indicate a functional pulmonary vasodysregulation as part of the pathophysiology during the vascular phase of COVID-19. The clinical relevance of autopsies and the integration of radiological imaging findings into histopathological injury patterns must be emphasized for a better understanding of COVID-19.","Wagner, W L; Hellbach, K; Fiedler, M O; Salg, G A; Wehrse, E; Ziener, C H; Merle, U; Eckert, C; Weber, T F; Stiller, W; Wielpütz, M O; Dullin, C; Kenngott, H G; Schlemmer, H-P; Weigand, M A; Schirmacher, P; Longerich, T; Kauczor, H-U; Kommoss, F K-F; Schwab, C",Radiologe,,360

387073,How to improve the global 'Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation' (CORSIA)?,2020,"At the time of writing, the COVID-19 infection is spreading rapidly. Currently, there is no vaccine or treatment, and researchers around the world are attempting to fight the infection. In this paper, we consider a diagnosis method for COVID-19, which is characterized by a very rapid rate of infection and is widespread. A possible method for avoiding severe infections is to stop the spread of the infection in advance by the prompt and accurate diagnosis of COVID-19. To this end, we exploit a group testing (GT) scheme, which is used to find a small set of confirmed cases out of a large population. For the accurate detection of false positives and negatives, we propose a robust algorithm (RA) based on the maximum a posteriori probability (MAP). The key idea of the proposed RA is to exploit iterative detection to propagate beliefs to neighbor nodes by exchanging marginal probabilities between input and output nodes. As a result, we show that our proposed RA provides the benefit of being robust against noise in the GT schemes. In addition, we demonstrate the performance of our proposal with a number of tests and successfully find a set of infected samples in both noiseless and noisy GT schemes with different COVID-19 incidence rates.","Seong, Jin-Taek",Diagn.,,360

Here, we report the clinical characteristics and outcomes for both patients with COVID-19 and the anaesthetists who provided their spinal anaesthesia. METHODS: Forty-nine patients with radiologically confirmed COVID-19 for Caesarean section or lower-limb surgery undergoing spinal anaesthesia in Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan, China participated in this retrospective study. Clinical characteristics and perioperative outcomes were recorded. For anaesthesiologists exposed to patients with COVID-19 by providing spinal anaesthesia, the level of personal protective equipment (PPE) used, clinical outcomes (pulmonary CT scans), and confirmed COVID-19 transmission rates (polymerase chain reaction [PCR]) were reviewed. RESULTS: Forty-nine patients with COVID-19 requiring supplementary oxygen before surgery had spinal anaesthesia (ropivacaine 0.75%), chiefly for Caesarean section (45/49 [91%]). Spinal anaesthesia was not associated with cardiorespiratory compromise intraoperatively. No patients subsequently developed severe pneumonia. Of 44 anaesthetists, 37 (84.1%) provided spinal anaesthesia using Level 3 PPE. Coronavirus disease 2019 infection was subsequently confirmed by PCR in 5/44 (11.4%) anaesthetists. One (2.7%) of 37 anaesthetists who wore Level 3 PPE developed PCR-confirmed COVID-19 compared with 4/7 (57.1%) anaesthetists who had Level 1 protection in the operating theatre (relative risk reduction: 95.3% [95% confidence intervals: 63.7-99.4]; P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Spinal anaesthesia was delivered safely in patients with active COVID-19 infection, the majority of whom had Caesarean sections. Level 3 PPE appears to reduce the risk of transmission to anaesthetists who are exposed to mildly symptomatic surgical patients.","Zhong, Qi; Liu, Yin Y; Luo, Qiong; Zou, Yu F; Jiang, Hai X; Li, Hui; Zhang, Jing J; Li, Zhen; Yang, Xin; Ma, Min; Tang, Li J; Chen, Ying Y; Zheng, Feng; Ke, Jian J; Zhang, Zong Z",Br J Anaesth,,360

AIM: We examined the association of the COVID-19 outbreak and the mental, physical and sexual health of the female Polish population. METHODS: Data were collected in an online survey distributed on social media from April 22, 2020 through to May 7, 2020. The data collection began one month after the start of lockdown in Poland. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Women were asked to complete the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) questionnaires. RESULTS: Overall, 1644 women (median age 23 years) took part in the survey. They reported a lower frequency of sexual activity (P < .001) and a lower libido level (P < .001) during the pandemic then before it. 57.5% of the study group (nâ¯=â¯944) strongly agreed or agreed that fear of the health condition of loved ones was a source of stress and depressed mood. The average BDI-II total score was 11 (range 0-51; IQR 5-18), which corresponds to minimal depression. The average FSFI total score was 27.01 ± 7.61 (range 2-36). The FSFI and BDI scores were significantly correlated (P < .001). The FSFI score was significantly correlated with the presence of any comorbid chronic disease, the intensity of the fear of infection and fear of health conditions, perceived loneliness, and the being up to date with media news. The BDI score was significantly correlated with age, the intensity of the fear of infection and fear of health conditions, perceived loneliness, being up to date with media news, and the more frequent use of stimulants. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 lockdown setting was associated with a high occurrence of depressive symptoms and increased risk of sexual dysfunction with decreased libido and lower sexual frequency the most commonly reported issues.

388961,Research at a Distance: Area Studies in the Post-Pandemic Era,2020,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Infection screening tools classically define fever as 38.0°C (100.4°F). Frail older adults may not mount the same febrile response to systemic infection as younger or healthier individuals. We evaluate temperature trends among nursing home (NH) residents undergoing diagnostic SARS-CoV-2 testing and describe the diagnostic accuracy of temperature measurements for predicting test-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study evaluating diagnostic accuracy of pre-SARS-CoV-2 testing temperature changes. SETTING: Two separate NH cohorts tested diagnostically (e.g., for symptoms) for SARS-CoV-2. PARTICIPANTS Veterans residing in Veterans Affairs (VA) managed NHs and residents in a private national chain of community NHs. MEASUREMENTS: For both cohorts, we determined the sensitivity, specificity, and Youden's index with different temperature cutoffs for SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction results. RESULTS: The VA cohort consisted of 1,301 residents in 134 facilities from March 1, 2020, to May 14, 2020, with 25% confirmed for SARS-CoV-2. The community cohort included 3,368 residents spread across 282 facilities from February 18, 2020, to June 9, 2020, and 42% were confirmed for SARS-CoV-2. The VA cohort was younger, less White, and mostly male. A temperature testing threshold of 37.2°C has better sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2, 76% and 34% in the VA and community NH, respectively, versus 38.0°C with 43% and 12% sensitivity, respectively. CONCLUSION: A definition of 38.0°C for fever in NH screening tools should be lowered to improve predictive accuracy for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Stakeholders should carefully consider the impact of adopting lower testing thresholds on testing availability, cost, and burden on staff and residents. Temperatures alone have relatively low sensitivity/specificity, and we advocate any threshold be used as part of a screening tool, along with other signs and symptoms of infection.","McConeghy, Kevin W; White, Elizabeth; Panagiotou, Orestis A; Santostefano, Christopher; Halladay, Christopher; Feifer, Richard A; Blackman, Carolyn; Rudolph, James L; Mor, Vince; Gravenstein, Stefan",J Am Geriatr Soc,,360

In this paper, we consider such a setting and study the misinformation prevention problem. Given the examples of attacker-protector pairs, our goal is to learn a strategy to compute protectors against future attackers, without the need of knowing the underlying diffusion model. To this end, we design a structured prediction framework, where the main idea is to parameterize the scoring function using random features constructed through distance functions on randomly sampled subgraphs, which leads to a kernelized scoring function with weights learnable via the large margin method. Evidenced by experiments, our method can produce near-optimal protectors without using any information of the diffusion model, and it outperforms other possible graph-based and learning-based methods by an evident margin.","Tong, Guangmo",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.14337v1.pdf,360

389164,Using Computer Vision to enhance Safety of Workforce in Manufacturing in a Post COVID World,2020-05-11,"BACKGROUND: During Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in Lombardia, people were recommended to avoid visiting emergency departments and attending routine clinic visits. In this context, it was necessary to understand the psychological reactions of patients with chronic diseases. We evaluated the psychological effects on patients with chronic respiratory conditions and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) through the analysis of their spontaneous contacts with their referral centres. METHODS: Cross-sectional study was conducted from February 23 to April 27, 2020 in patients, or their parents, who contacted their multidisciplinary teams (MDT). E-mails and phone calls directed to the MDT of the centre for cystic fibrosis (CF) in Milano and for paediatric IBD in Bergamo, were categorised according to their contents as information on routine disease management, updates on the patient's health status, COVID-19 news monitoring, empathy towards health professionals, positive feedback and concern of contagion during the emergency. RESULTS: One thousand eight hundred and sixteen contacts were collected during the study period. In Milano, where the majority of patients were affected by CF, 88.7% contacted health professionals by e-mail, with paediatricians receiving the largest volume of emails and phone calls compared with other professionals (P< .001). Compared with Milano, the centre for IBD in Bergamo recorded more expression of empathy towards health professionals and thanks for their activity in the COVID-19 emergency (52.4% vs 12.7%, P< .001), as well as positive feedback (64.3% vs 2.7%, P = .003). CONCLUSION: One of the most important lessons we can learn from COVID-19 is that it is not the trauma itself that can cause psychological consequences but rather the level of balance, or imbalance, between fragility and resources. To feel safe, people need to be able to count on the help of those who represent a bulwark against the threat. This is the role played, even remotely, by health professionals.","Nobili, Rita Maria; Gambazza, Simone; Spada, Maria Simonetta; Tutino, Anna Luisa; Bulfamante, Anna Marta; Mariani, Alessandra; Brivio, Anna; Moioli, Loredana; Rizzato, Erika; Sansotta, Naire; Claut, Laura; Faelli, Nadia; Norsa, Lorenzo; Colombo, Carla",Int J Clin Pract,,360

The purpose of this study was to determine if the incidence of pneumomediastinum/subcutaneous emphysema in COVID-19 patients was higher than in ARDS patients without COVID-19 and if this difference could be attributed to barotrauma or to lung frailty. Methods: We identified both a cohort of patients with ARDS and COVID-19 (CoV-ARDS), and a cohort of patients with ARDS from other causes (noCoV-ARDS).Patients with CoV-ARDS were admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) during the COVID-19 pandemic and had microbiologically confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. NoCoV-ARDS was identified by an ARDS diagnosis in the 5â years before the COVID-19 pandemic period. Results: Pneumomediastinum/subcutaneous emphysema occurred in 23 out of 169 (13.6%) patients with CoV-ARDS and in three out of 163 (1.9%) patients with noCoV-ARDS (p<0.001). Mortality was 56.5% in CoV-ARDS patients with pneumomediastinum/subcutaneous emphysema and 50% in patients without pneumomediastinum (p=0.46).CoV-ARDS patients had a high incidence of pneumomediastinum/subcutaneous emphysema despite the use of low tidal volume (5.9±0.8â mL·kg-1 ideal body weight) and low airway pressure (plateau pressure 23±4â cmH2O). Conclusions: We observed a seven-fold increase in pneumomediastinum/subcutaneous emphysema in CoV-ARDS.

Policymakers need strategies to inform decisions about allocating scarce resources. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: We updated a systematic review on evidence-based approaches and searched databases through May 2020 for evaluation of strategies for policymakers. RESULTS: The 201 identified studies evaluated reducing demand for healthcare, optimizing existing resources, augmenting resources, and adopting crisis standards of care. Most research exists to reduce demand (n=149); 39 higher quality studies reported benefits of contact tracing, school closures, travel restrictions, and mass vaccination. Of 28 strategies to augment resources, 6 higher quality studies reported effectiveness of establishing temporary facilities, use of volunteers, and decision support software. Of 23 strategies to optimize existing resources, 12 higher quality studies reported successful scope of work expansions and building on existing interagency agreements. Of 15 COVID-19 studies, 4 higher quality studies evaluated combinations of policies and one reported benefits of community-wide mask policies. CONCLUSION: Despite the volume, the evidence base is limited; few strategies were empirically tested in robust study designs. The review provides a comprehensive overview of the effects of strategies to allocate resources and provides critical appraisal to direct them to the best available evidence.","Hempel, S; Burke, R V; Hochman, M; Thompson, G; Brothers, A; Shin, J; Motala, A; Larkin, J; Bolshakova, M; Fu, N; Ringel, J",J. clin. epidemiol,,360

394769,The future of financial fraud,2020,"The Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) epidemic model as well as its generalizations are extensively used for the study of the spread of infectious diseases, and for the understanding of the dynamical evolution of epidemics. From SIR type models only the model without vital dynamics has an exact analytic solution, which can be obtained in an exact parametric form. The SIR model with vital dynamics, the simplest extension of the basic SIR model, does not admit a closed form representation of the solution. However, in order to perform the comparison with the epidemiological data accurate representations of the time evolution of the SIR model with vital dynamics would be very useful. In the present paper, we obtain first the basic evolution equation of the SIR model with vital dynamics, which is given by a strongly nonlinear second order differential equation. Then we obtain a series representation of the solution of the model, by using the Adomian and Laplace-Adomian Decomposition Methods to solve the dynamical evolution equation of the model. The solutions are expressed in the form of infinite series. The series representations of the time evolution of the SIR model with vital dynamics are compared with the exact numerical solutions of the model, and we find that, at least for a specific range of parameters, there is a good agreement between the Adomian and Laplace-Adomian semianalytical solutions, containing only a small number of terms, and the numerical results.","Harko, Tiberiu; Mak, Man Kwong",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.00434v1.pdf,360

396437,"Education, Digital Natives, and Inequality",2021,"Recently, the world has witnessed outbreak of a novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), the virus which initially emerged in Wuhan, China has now made its way to a large part of the world, resulting in a public emergency of international concern. The functional importance of Chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) in viral replication and maturation turns it into an attractive target for the development of effective antiviral drugs against SARS and other coronaviruses. At present, there is no standard drug regime nor any vaccine available against the infection. The rapid development and identification of efficient interventions against SARS-CoV-2 remains a major challenge. Based on the available knowledge of closely related coronavirus and their safety profiles, repurposing of existing antiviral drugs and screening of available databases is considered a near term strategic and economic way to contain the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Herein, we applied computational drug design methods to identify Chymotrypsin-like protease inhibitors from FDA approved antiviral drugs and our in-house database of natural and drug-like compounds of synthetic origin. As a result three FDA approved drugs (Remdesivir, Saquinavir and Darunavir) and two natural compounds (. flavone and coumarine derivatives) were identified as promising hits. Further, MD simulation and binding free energy calculations were performed to evaluate the dynamic behavior, stability of protein-ligand contact, and binding affinity of the hit compounds. Our results indicate that the identified compounds can inhibit the function of Chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) of Coronavirus. Considering the severity of the spread of coronavirus, the current study is in-line with the concept of finding the new inhibitors against the vital pathway of the corona virus to expedite the process of drug discovery.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Real-time polymerase chain reaction (real-time PCR) is accounted for the perfect point of reference in detecting this virus. The notion that this virus also invades the male reproductive tract requires further investigation to prove the presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the semen. This investigation was designed to detect SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 survivors semen. This study design was a cross-sectional examination and conducted between November 2020 and March 2021 in the Andrology Unit of Dr. Soetomo General Hospital and Professor Nidom Foundation, both located in the City of Surabaya, Indonesia. The sample was 34 male participants aged above 18 years old and had been confirmed COVID-19 by nasopharyngeal swab PCR test. Part of the semen was taken for real-time PCR testing with the QuantStudio 5 Applied Biosystem (AB) PCR machine and the kits utilized were the STANDARD M nCOV Real-Time Detection Kit and mBioCov-19 RT-PCR Kit. Furthermore, the mean of participants ages was 35.74 years old with 25% of them had had a history of primary infertility and 21.8% of secondary infertility. From the real-time PCR COVID-19 of the semen examination, this investigation found that 27 participants had been negatives (74.4%), six inconclusive (17.6%), and one positive (3%) of SARS CoV-2. In summary, SARS-CoV-2 could be found in the semen of COVID-19 survivors. This should be a concern for the potential impact of COVID-19 in male fertility and the possibility of transmission reproductively.","Supardi, Supardi; Nidom, Reviany V.; Sisca, Eni M.; Tribowo, Jefry A.; Kandar, Patricia S.; Budiharto, Joice M.; Siswidiyanto, Eko B.; Wen, Maitra D.; Kirana, Tiara; Nidom, Astria N.; Ansori, Arif N.

Studying National Responses to a Global Pandemic in Europe,2021,"The short-term effectiveness of a two-dose regimen of the BioNTech/Pfizer mRNA BNT162b2 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine was widely demonstrated. However, long term effectiveness is still unknown. A nationwide vaccination campaign was initiated early in Israel, allowing for a real-world evaluation of the interaction between protection and time-from-vaccine. The Delta (B.1.617.2) variant became the dominant strain in Israel in June 2021, as Israel is currently experiencing a new surge of cases. Leveraging the centralized computerized database of Maccabi Healthcare Services (MHS), we assessed the correlation between time-from-vaccine and incidence of breakthrough infection. We found that the risk for infection was significantly higher for early vaccinees compared to those vaccinated later. This preliminary finding should prompt further investigagions into long-term protection against different strains, and prospective clinical trials to examine the effect of a booster vaccine against breakthrough infection.","Lotan, Roni; Gazit, Sivan; Chodik, Gabriel; Patalon, Tal; Perez, Galit; Tov, Amir Ben; mizrahi, barak; Kalkstein, Nir; Peretz, Asaf",,,360

Over 750,000 confirmed cases were reported, leading to more than 36,000 deaths. In this study, we analysed the efficiency of various intervention strategies to prevent infection by the virus, SARS-CoV-2, using an agent-based SEIIR model, in the fully urbanised city of Shenzhen, Guangdong Province, China. Shortening the duration from symptom onset to hospital admission, quarantining recent arrivals from Hubei Province, and letting symptomatic individuals stay at home were found to be the three most important interventions to reduce the risk of infection in Shenzhen. The ideal time window for a mandatory quarantine of arrivals from Hubei Province was between 10 January and January 17, 2020, while the ideal time window for local intervention strategies was between 15 and 22 January. The risk of infection could have been reduced by 50% if all symptomatic individuals had immediately gone to hospital for isolation, and by 35% if a 14-day quarantine for arrivals from Hubei Province had been introduced one week earlier. Intervention strategies implemented in Shenzhen were effective, and the spread of infection would be controlled even if the initial basic reproduction number had doubled. Our results may be useful for other cities when choosing their intervention strategies to prevent outbreaks of COVID-19.","Zhang, Nan; Cheng, Pan; Jia, Wei; Dung, Chung-Hin; Liu, Li; Chen, Wenzhao; Lei, Hao; Kan, Changcheng; Han, Xiaoyan; Su, Boni; Xiao, Shenglan; Qian, Hua; Lin, Borong; Li, Yuguo",Build.

METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of all women with a singleton pregnancy who gave birth > 24 week gestation in a single center (2000-2016). The exposure of interest was SGA, defined as birth weight < 10th or < 25th centile according to three fetal growth charts (Hadlock et al., Radiology 181:129-133, 1991; intergrowth-21st (IG21), WHO 2017, and a Canadian birthweight-based reference-Kramer et al., Pediatrics 108:E35, 2001). The outcome of interest was antepartum stillbirth due to placental dysfunction or unknown etiology. Cases of stillbirth attributed to other specific etiologies were excluded. RESULTS: A total of 49,458 women were included in the cohort. There were 103 (0.21%) cases of stillbirth due to placental dysfunction or unknown etiology. For cases in the early stillbirth cluster (&#8804; 30 weeks), the detection rate was high and was similar for the three ultrasound-based fetal growth charts of Hadlock, IG21, and WHO (range 83.3-87.0%). In contrast, the detection rate of SGA for cases in the late stillbirth cluster (> 30 weeks) was low, being highest for WHO and Hadlock (36.7% and 34.7%, respectively), and lowest for IG21 (18.4%). Using a threshold of the 25th centile increased the detection rate for stillbirth by approximately 15-20% compared with that achieved by the 10th centile cutoff. CONCLUSION: At > 30 week gestation, the Hadlock or WHO fetal growth charts provided the best balance between detection rate and false positive rate for stillbirth.","Hiersch, Liran; Lipworth, Hayley; Kingdom, John; Barrett, Jon; Melamed, Nir",Arch. gynecol. obstet,,360

Design/methodology/approach: Databases such as MEDLINE (Ovid), excerpta medica dataBASE (Ovid) and cumulative index of nursing and allied health literature (Elton B. Stephens Company), as well as grey literature, were used as a part of the search design to locate articles published on this subject. The search design was formatted in a way that aided in locating articles concerning a variety of mental health effects. Title and abstract screening and full text screening were conducted by two reviewers. The risk of bias assessment was conducted using AMSTAR2. Data extraction was performed by one reviewer and was confirmed by the other. Findings: A total of 28 articles were obtained, and of those, 11 were included in the review. From the data that was reviewed, the majority of the isolated individuals felt depressed and anxious. This negative psychological distress contributes to deteriorating health and quality of life in many people. Research limitations/implications: Few limitations include limited published research papers pertaining to the subject of the mental health effects of COVID-19 on individuals in social isolation. Therefore, this suggests the need for higher quality studies to be performed on this topic.

Vitamin D is a key modulator of the immune system. We hypothesized that vitamin D deficiency (VDD) could increase the risk of developing severe COVID-19 infection. Methods: patients with confirmed COVID-19 seen at the emergency department of our hospital with recent measurements of 25(OH)D were recruited. We explored the association of vitamin D deficiency (VDD), defined as 25-hydroxyvitamin D < 20 ng/mL, with a composite of adverse clinical outcomes. Results: we included 80 patients, of which 31 (39 %) presented the endpoint. VDD tended to predict an increased risk of developing severe COVID-19 after adjusting for age, gender, obesity, cardiac disease, and kidney disease [OR 3.2 (95 % CI: 0.9-11.4), p = 0.07]. Age had a negative interaction with the effect of VDD on the composite outcome (p = 0.03), indicating that the effect was more noticeable at younger ages. Furthermore, male gender was associated with VDD and with severe COVID-19 at younger ages. Conclusions: in this retrospective study, vitamin D deficiency showed a signal of association with severe COVID-19 infection. A significant interaction with age was noted, suggesting VDD may have a greater impact in younger patients. These findings should be confirmed in larger, prospective, adequately powered studies.","Macaya, Fernando; Espejo Paeres, Carolina; Valls, Adrián; Fernández-Ortiz, Antonio; González Del Castillo, Juan; Martín-Sánchez, F Javier; Runkle, Isabelle; Rubio Herrera, Miguel Ángel",Nutr Hosp,,360

Implementation of one or more social distancing policies resulted in an additional 24.5% reduction in mobility the following week, and subsequent shelter-in-place mandates yielded an additional 29.0% reduction. Decreases in mobility were associated with substantial reductions in case growth two to four weeks later. For example, a 10% reduction in mobility was associated with a 17.5% reduction in case growth two weeks later.

404031,The music export business: Born global,2021,"We hypothesized that because Covid-19 (C19) remains an urgent and visible threat, efforts to combat its negative health consequences have become moralized. This moralization of health-based efforts may generate asymmetries in judgement, whereby harmful by-products of those efforts (i.e., instrumental harm) are perceived as more acceptable than harm resulting from non-C19 efforts, such as prioritizing the economy or non-C19 issues. We tested our predictions in two experimental studies. In Study 1, American participants evaluated the same costs (public shaming, deaths and illnesses, and police abuse of power) as more acceptable when they resulted from efforts to minimize C19's health impacts, than when they resulted from non-health C19 efforts (e.g., prioritizing economic costs) or efforts unrelated to C19 (e.g., reducing traffic deaths). In Study 2, New Zealand participants less favorably evaluated the quality of a research proposal empirically questioning continuing a C19 elimination strategy in NZ than one questioning abandoning an elimination strategy, although both proposals contained the same amount of methodology information. This finding suggests questioning elimination approaches is morally condemned, a similar response to that found when sacred values are questioned. In both studies, condition effects were mediated by lowered moral outrage in response to costs resulting from pursuing health-minded C19 efforts. Follow-up analyses revealed that both heightened personal concern over contracting C19 and liberal ideology were associated with greater asymmetries in human cost evaluation. Altogether, results suggest reducing or eliminating C19 have become moralized, generating asymmetries in evaluations of human suffering.","Graso, Maja; Chen, Fan Xuan; Reynolds, Tania",J Exp Soc Psychol,,360
404050,The coronavirus pandemic narratives in Italian digital media,2021,"Acute viral respiratory tract infections (AVRIs) are a major burden on human health and global economy and amongst the top five causes of death worldwide resulting in an estimated 3.9 million lives lost every year. In addition, new emerging respiratory viruses regularly cause outbreaks such as SARS-CoV-1 in 2003, the ""Swine flu"" in 2009, or most importantly the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, which intensely impact global health, social life, and economy. Despite the prevalence of AVRIs and an urgent need, no vaccines-except for influenza-or effective treatments were available at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the innate RNAi pathway offers the ability to develop nucleic acid-based antiviral drugs. siRNA sequences against conserved, essential regions of the viral genome can prevent viral replication. In addition, viral infection can be averted prophylactically by silencing host genes essential for host-viral interactions. Unfortunately, delivering siRNAs to their target cells and intracellular site of action remains the principle hurdle toward their therapeutic use. Currently, siRNA formulations and chemical modifications are evaluated for their delivery. This progress report discusses the selection of antiviral siRNA sequences, delivery techniques to the infection sites, and provides an overview of antiviral siRNAs against respiratory viruses.","Mehta, Aditi; Michler, Thomas; Merkel, Olivia M",Adv Healthc Mater,,360

Nowadays, the vast majority of these masks are made of nonwoven fabrics. High-quality products have mainly melt-blown filtering layers of nano/microfiber. Melt blowing produces very fine synthetic nonwovens from a wide range of polymers and allows a fair control of the fiber structure and morphology that makes it ideal for filtration purposes. Melt blowing has a high throughput, and the low price of the filter makes these products widely available for civil use. Although melt-blown fiber applications were rapidly growing in the last three decades, we still have limited knowledge on the processing parameters. In this regard, we detailed the melt blowing parameters to obtain a filter media with high particle capturing efficiency and a low-pressure drop. We summarized the melt-blown fiber mat characteristics with specific attention to the pore size, the porosity, the fiber diameter, the fiber packing density and the air permeability desired for highly efficient filtration. Even though we cannot estimate the future social effects and the trauma caused by the current pandemic, and protective masks might remain a part of everyday life for a long while. That also implies that near-future investments in wider manufacturing capacities seem inevitable. This paper also aims to facilitate masks' production with improved filtration efficiency by reviewing the recent developments in melt blowing, the related applications, the effects of processing parameters on the structure and performance of the nonwoven products focusing on the filtration efficiency via knowledge.","Kara, Yahya Molnár Kolos",Journal of Industrial Textiles,,360
405438,Lessons Learned from 55 (or More) Years of Professional Experience in Urban Planning and Development,2021,"INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to examine whether telehealth is as safe and effective as traditional office visits in assessing and treating patients with symptoms consistent with COVID-19. METHODS: In this retrospective cross-sectional study, the primary outcome was any 14-day related healthcare follow-up event(s). Secondary outcomes were the type of 14-day related follow-up event including hospital admission, emergency department visit, office visit, telehealth visit and/or multiple follow-up visits. Individual visit types were identified due to the significant difference between a hospital admission and an office visit. Logistic regressions were done using the predictors of visit type, age, gender and comorbidities and the primary outcome variable of a related follow-up visit and then by follow-up type: hospital admission, emergency department visit or office visit. RESULTS: Of 1305 visits, median age was 42.3 years and 65.8% were female. Traditional office visits accounted for 741 (56.8%) of initial visits, while 564 (43.2%) visits occurred via telehealth. One hundred and forty-six (25.9%) of the telehealth visits resulted in a 14-day related healthcare follow-up visit versus 161 (21.7%) of the office visits (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.22, 95% CI 0.94-1.58). DISCUSSION: There was no significant difference in related follow-ups of initial telehealth visits compared to initial office visits including no significant difference in hospital admission or emergency department visits. These findings suggest that based on follow up healthcare utilization, telehealth may be a safe and effective option in assessing and treating patients with respiratory symptoms as the COVID-19 pandemic continues.","Phillips, J Cole; Lord, Richard W; Davis, Stephen W; Burton, Amanda A; Kirk, Julienne K",J Telemed Telecare,,360

METHODS: The Hospital Infection Control Committee (HICC) and virology testing records were combined to identify SARS-CoV-2 positive HCWs and study the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 over 6 months. RESULTS: COVID-19 cases in our HCWs cohort rose and declined parallel to community cases. Forty two out of 534 HCWs (8%) were SARS-CoV-2 positive with no fatalities. No clinical staff in the special COVID ward or ICU was positive. Significant proportion of non-clinical staff (30%) were SARS-CoV-2 positive. About 70% of SARS-CoV-2 positive staff had likely community acquisition, with a significant proportion having travelled by public transport or having a contact history with a positive case in the community. Twenty four percent of positive staff were asymptomatic and detected positive on re-joining test. CONCLUSIONS: Sustained transmission of SARS-CoV-2 did not occur in our cohort beyond community transmission. Appropriate PPE use, strict and constantly improving infection control measures and testing of both clinical and non-clinical staff were essential methods for restricting transmission amongst HCWs.","Pandrowala, A.; Shaikh, S.; Balsekar, M.; Kirolkar, S.; Udani, S.",Indian Pediatrics,,360

407077,Robotics' Role in the Coronavirus Crisis,2020,"Objectives: To determine how several existing crisis standards of care triage protocols would have distinguished between patients with coronavirus disease 2019 requiring intensive care. Design: Retrospective cohort study. Setting: Single urban academic medical center. Patients: One-hundred twenty patients with coronavirus disease 2019 who required intensive care and mechanical ventilation. Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: The characteristics of each patient at the time of ICU triage were used to determine how patients would have been prioritized using four crisis standards of care protocols. The vast majority of patients in the cohort would have been in the highest priority group using a triage protocol focusing on Sequential Organ Failure Assessment alone. Prioritization based on Sequential Organ Failure Assessment and 1-year life expectancy would have resulted in only slightly more differentiation between patients. Prioritization based on Sequential Organ Failure Assessment and 5-year life expectancy would have added significant additional differentiation depending on how priority groups were defined. Conclusions: There is considerable controversy regarding the use of criteria other than prognosis for short-term survival in initial allocation of critical care resources under crisis standards of care triage protocols. To the extent that initial triage protocols would not create sufficient differentiation between patients, effectively resulting in a first-come, first-served initial allocation of resources, it is important to focus on how resources would be reallocated in the event of ongoing scarcity.","Rubin, E.

Evidence on increased severity for patients undergoing antineoplastic treatment is posed against deferring oncologic treatment. We aimed to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on patient volumes in a cancer center in an epicenter of the pandemic. METHODS: Outpatient and inpatient volumes were extracted from electronic health record database. Two intervals were compared: pre-COVID-19 (March to May 2019) and COVID-19 pandemic (March to May 2020) periods. RESULTS: The total number of medical appointments declined by 45% in the COVID-19 period, including a 56.2% decrease in new visits. There was a 27.5% reduction in the number of patients undergoing intravenous systemic treatment and a 57.4% decline in initiation of new treatments. Conversely, there was an increase by 309% in new patients undergoing oral chemotherapy regimens and a 5.9% rise in new patients submitted to radiation therapy in the COVID-19 period. There was a 51.2% decline in length of stay and a 60% reduction in the volume of surgical cases during COVID-19. In the stem cell transplant unit, we observed a reduction by 36.5% in length of stay and a 62.5% drop in stem cell transplants. CONCLUSION: A significant decrease in the number of patients undergoing cancer treatment was observed after COVID-19 pandemic. Although this may be partially overcome by alternative therapeutic options, avoiding timely health care due to fear of getting COVID-19 infection might impact on clinical outcomes. Our findings may help support immediate actions to mitigate this hypothesis.","Araujo, Sérgio Eduardo Alonso; Leal, Alessandro; Centrone, Ana Fernanda Yamazaki; Teich, Vanessa Damazio; Malheiro, Daniel Tavares; Cypriano, Adriana Serra; Cendoroglo Neto, Miguel; Klajner, Sidney",Einstein (Sao Paulo),,360

It has resulted in loss of thousands of lives globally and has brought countries to the brink of economic, social, and health collapse. A major issue of this infection is the ease with which it transmits through salivary droplets and its survival for long durations outside the body. Therefore, its early detection is critical in prevention, diagnostic, and management efforts of COVID-19 patients. Loss of taste and smell is one of the early symptoms reported in these patients and the virus is abundantly found in the salivary secretion of the infected symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. Infection and inflammation of salivary glands are common among viral infections, particularly in the early stages, which lead to salivary composition changes. Chemosensory sensation of taste is critically dependent on the salivary flow rate and its inorganic constituents, protein levels, specific 3',5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate and 3',5'-cyclic guanosine monophosphate levels, ghrelins, pH levels, and enzymes. Therefore, the question arises, ""Does COVID-19 infection alter the salivary components and composition leading to early transient symptoms of Ageusia and hypogeusia?"" This review shows association of the COVID-19 and Ageusia, in addition to the early viral infection of salivary glands and possible changes in salivary flow and content. Therefore, suggesting a potential association between early ageusia in COVID-19 infection and salivary compositional changes.","Abduljabbar, Tariq; Alhamdan, Rana S; Al Deeb, Modhi; AlAali, Khulud A; Vohra, Fahim",European journal of dentistry,,360

To assess the long-term impact of a SARS-CoV-2-infection on the immune system, we conducted a prospective study of 80 acute and former SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals and 39 unexposed donors to evaluate autoantibody responses and immune composition. Autoantibody levels against cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP), a specific predictor for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), were significantly (p = 0.035) elevated in convalescents only, whereas both acute COVID-19 patients and long-term convalescents showed critically increased levels of anti-tissue transglutaminase (TG), a specific predictor of celiac disease (CD) (p = 0.002). Both, anti-CCP and anti-TG antibody levels were still detectable after 4-8 months post infection. Anti-TG antibodies occurred predominantly in aged patients in a context of a post-SARS-CoV-2-specific immune composition (R2 = 0.31; p = 0.044). This study shows that increased anti-CCP and anti-TG autoantibody levels can remain long-term after recovering even from mildly experienced COVID-19.

COVID-19 infection is highly variable, ranging from asymptomatic infections to severe, life-threatening manifestations. Personalized medicine can play a key role in elucidating individual susceptibility to the infection as well as inter-individual variability in clinical course, prognosis and response to treatment. Integrating personalized medicine into clinical practice can also transform health care by enabling the design of preventive and therapeutic strategies tailored to individual profiles, improving the detection of outbreaks or defining transmission patterns at an increasingly local level. SARS-CoV2 genome sequencing, together with the assessment of specific patient genetic variants, will support clinical decision-makers and ultimately better ways to fight this disease. Additionally, it would facilitate a better stratification and selection of patients for clinical trials, thus increasing the likelihood of obtaining positive results. Lastly, defining a national strategy to implement in clinical practice all available tools of personalized medicine in COVID-19 could be challenging but linked to a positive transformation of the health care system. In this review, we provide an update of the achievements, promises, and challenges of personalized medicine in the fight against COVID-19 from susceptibility to natural history and response to therapy, as well as from surveillance to control measures and vaccination.

Coagulation dysfunction is a hallmark in patients with COVID-19. Fulminant thrombotic complications emerge as critical issues in patients with severe COVID-19. Objective: To present a review of the literature and discuss the mechanisms of COVID-19 underlying coagulation activation and the implications for anticoagulant and thrombolytic treatment in the management of COVID-19. Data Sources: We performed a systemic review of scientific papers on the topic of COVID-19, online available via the PubMed NCBI, medRxiv, and Preprints as of May 15, 2020. We also shared our experience on the management of thrombotic events in patients with COVID-19. Conclusions: COVID-19-associated coagulopathy ranges from mild laboratory alterations to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) with a predominant phenotype of thrombotic/multiple organ failure. Characteristically, high D-dimer levels on admission and/or continuously increasing concentrations of D-dimer is associated with disease progression and poor overall survival. SARS-CoV-2 infection triggers the immune-hemostatic response. Drastic inflammatory responses including, but not limited to, cytokine storm, vasculopathy, and NETosis may contribute to an overwhelming activation of coagulation. Hypercoagulability and systemic thrombotic complications necessitate anticoagulant and thrombolytic interventions, which provide opportunities to prevent or reduce ""excessive"" thrombin generation, while preserving ""adaptive"" hemostasis and bring additional benefit via their anti-inflammatory effect in the setting of COVID-19.","Fei, Yang; Tang, Ning; Liu, Hefei; Cao, Wenjing",Arch. pathol. lab. med.

Indeed, CD20, CD38, CD22 and HER2/neu could constitute therapeutic targets. However, few studies have reported on the expression level of these markers. Such investigations would be useful to appreciate the potential efficacy/toxicity of immunotherapies targeting these antigens. Indeed, a cohort of 125 B-ALL patients (1-25 years old) was retrospectively enrolled, for whom the same multiparametric flow cytometry assay had been performed over the whole period, allowing for fluorescence intensities comparison. CD20, CD38 and CD22 were expressed in respectively 53,6%, 99,2% 98,4% of the cases, rather homogeneously and at intermediate levels. HER2/neu, a marker of breast cancer also expressed in a subset of ALL, was present in 16 samples (13,4%), but not detectable on hematogones. Interestingly, in this subgroup, patients had a significantly lower 5-year EFS compared to patients without expression of HER2/neu (63,0% versus 80,5%, p=0.02). In conclusion, these 4 antigens could be alternatives of interest especially since CD19 can be downmodulated after current therapies targeting this antigen. Trastuzumab could also be a potential interesting immunotherapy in the HER2/neu expressing group, especially in relapsed childhood ALL. This article is protected by copyright.

To estimate the severity of the disease, receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed that the areas under the curve which were determined based on the optimal cut off values that were calculated for the variables of values of neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR > 3.69), C-reactive protein (CRP > 46 mg/L), troponin I ( > 5.3 ng/L), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH > 325 U/L), ferritin ( > 303 ug/L), d-dimer ( > 574 µg/L), neutrophil NE ( > 4.99 × 109 /L), lymphocyte (LE < 1.04 × 109 /L), SO2 ( < %92) were 0.762, 0.757,0.742, 0.705, 0.698, 0.694,0.688, 0.678, and 0.66, respectively. To predict mortality, AUC of values for optimal cutoff troponin I ( > 7.4 ng/L), age ( > 62), SO2 ( < %89), urea ( > 40 mg/dL), procalcitonin ( > 0.21 ug/L), CKMB ( > 2.6 ng/L) were 0.715, 0.685, 0.644, 0.632, 0.627, and 0.617, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical progress could be severe if the baseline values of NLR, CRP, troponin I, LDH, are above, and LE is below the specified cut-off point. We found that the troponin I, elder age, and SO2 values could predict mortality.","Tahtasakal, Ceren A; Oncul, Ahsen; Sevgi, Dilek Yildiz; Celik, Emine; Ocal, Murat; Turkkan, Hakki M; Bayraktar, Banu; Oba, Sibel; Dokmetas, Ilyas",J Med Virol,,360
410011,Scientific interactions in a virtual world,2021,"Effective management of the global pandemic caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (also known as COVID-19), resulted in the implementation of severe restrictions in movement and enforcement of social distancing measures. This study aimed to understand and characterize the psychosocial effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in the general population and to identify risks and protective factors that predict changes in mental health status. In addition, the study investigated compliance with precautionary measures (PM) to halt the spread of the virus. The online anonymous survey collected information on sociodemographic data, compliance with PM, quality of life (QOL), and mental health via the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). A total of 1642 adult participants (71.6% women, 28.4% men) completed the survey in the European island country, Cyprus. A large percentage (48%) reported significant financial concerns and 66.7% significant changes in their QOL. About 41% reported symptoms associated with mild anxiety; 23.1% reported moderate-severe anxiety symptoms. Concerning depression, 48% reported mild and 9.2% moderate-severe depression symptoms. Women, younger age (18-29), student status, unemployment status, prior psychiatric history, and those reporting greater negative impact on their QOL, were at higher risk for increased anxiety and depression symptoms (p < 0.05). The youngest age group and males also reported lower levels of compliance with PM. Higher compliance with PM predicted lower depression scores (p < 0.001) but higher anxiety for measures related to personal hygiene. The results of this study provide important data on the effects of the COVID-19 outbreak on mental health and QOL and identify a variety of personal and social determinants that serve as risks and protective factors. Furthermore, it has implications for policy makers demonstrating the need for effective mental health programs and guidance for the implementation of PM as a public health strategy.","Solomou, Ioulia; Constantinidou, Fofi",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,360

METHODS: A survey of 788 U.S. adults was conducted to explore the relationships between demographics and psychosocial predictors of intent to get a future COVID-19 vaccine as well as willingness to get such a vaccine under EUA. RESULTS: Significant predictors of COVID-19 vaccine uptake intentions were education, having insurance, scoring high on subjective norms, a positive attitude toward the vaccine, as well as high perceived susceptibility to COVID-19, high perceived benefits of the vaccine, scoring low on barriers to the vaccine, and scoring high on self-efficacy. Predictors of willingness to take a COVID-19 vaccine under EUA were age, race/ethnicity, positive subjective norms, high perceived behavioral control, positive attitudes toward the vaccine, as well as high perceived susceptibility to COVID-19, high perceived benefits of the vaccine, low barriers to the vaccine, and scoring high on self-efficacy for getting the vaccine. Concerns about rushed vaccine development appear to reduce vaccine uptake intent, as well as willingness to get the vaccine under EUA. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 vaccine-related messages should both address concerns about the vaccine and its development and reinforce benefits of the vaccine (both factors significant in both models). Vaccine efforts may need to go beyond just communications campaigns correcting misinformation about a COVID-19 vaccine to also focus on re-establishing public trust in government agencies.","Guidry, Jeanine P D; Laestadius, Linnea I; Vraga, Emily K; Miller, Carrie A; Perrin, Paul B; Burton, Candace W; Ryan, Mark; Fuemmeler, Bernard F; Carlyle, Kellie E",Am. j. infect. control,,360

SARS-CoV-2 is proposed to cause AKI in the patients through various mechanisms. We are, nevertheless, far from a comprehensive understanding of the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of the kidney injury in this infection. AKI has been shown to be a marker of disease severity and also a negative prognostic factor for survival. Unfortunately, no effective preventive strategy to decrease the risk of kidney damage in these patients has yet been identified. In this hypothesis, we highlight the potential protective effects of acetazolamide, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, in preventing the proximal tubular damage caused by the virus through disrupting the virus-endosome fusion and also interfering with the lysosomal proteases. Our proposed mechanisms could pave the way for further in vitro studies and subsequent clinical trials.","Habibzadeh, Parham; Mofatteh, Mohammad; Ghavami, Saeid; Roozbeh, Jamshid",Eur J Pharmacol,,360

However, neurologic complications have arisen as an increasingly recognized area of morbidity and mortality. OBJECTIVE: This brief report summarizes the neurologic complications associated with COVID-19 with an emphasis on the emergency medicine clinician. DISCUSSION: COVID-19 has infected over 3.5 million people and killed over 240,000 people worldwide. While pulmonary complications are profound, the neurologic system is also significantly impacted, with complications including acute cerebrovascular events, encephalitis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, acute necrotizing hemorrhagic encephalopathy, and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. Additionally, patients on immunosuppressive medications for pre-existing neurologic issues are at an increased risk for complications with COVID-19 infection, and many of the currently proposed COVID-19 therapies can interact with these medications. CONCLUSIONS: When caring for COVID-19 patients, emergency medicine clinicians should be aware of the neurologic complications from COVID-19.","Bridwell, Rachel; Long, Brit; Gottlieb, Michael",Am J Emerg Med,,360

411135,Trump and the Liberal International Order,2020,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is shining a spotlight on health disparities that have long been overlooked in our society. The intersection between Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs), longstanding health disparities, and COVID-19 cannot be ignored. The accumulation of traumatic events throughout the childhood and adolescent years can cause toxic stress in the absence of supportive adults. This repetitive activation of the stress response system can be a catalyst to long-term, negative effects on both the body and brain. A major factor to appreciate is that ACEs do not affect all populations equally. ACEs disproportionately affect groups that have been historically oppressed. The current COVID-19 pandemic highlights this point when observing both case rates and fatality rates of the virus and has the potential to create a new series of long-term health conditions that will disproportionately affect marginalized communities. A foundational first and critical step of adopting a trauma-informed approach will help lead to system change, advance equity, and create a setting of mutuality and empowerment for our patients.","Sonu, Stan; Marvin, David; Moore, Charles",J Child Adolesc Trauma,,360
411228,An Enhanced IoT Based Tracing and Tracking Model for COVID -19 Cases,2021,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a severe public health threat worldwide. Despite the global spread, there is an observed aberration and skewness in the geographic/regional distribution of the disease, with a high preponderance of cases and mortality occurring in the temperate regions compared to the tropics. A plausible explanation for this discrepancy could be linked to variability in environmental factors. Hence, this review discusses succinctly the possible influences of geographic location, temperature/sunlight, relative humidity and building design on the rate of transmission of COVID-19. We postulate that elevated melatonin production in a hot climate, high temperature, adequate vitamin D synthesis from sunlight exposure, high relative humidity and efficient ventilation due to housing design confers innate immunity and adaptive advantage to COVID-19 transmission for populations in the tropics over those in the temperate regions. Hence, we recommend that control studies taking into congnizance the relationship between environment and disease be prioritized. Such studies are important for predicting viral disease spread, in particular if this leads to pandemics like in the case of COVID-19, to aid decisions in public health policies at the global level.","Allen, Sokan-Adeaga Adewale; Ayodeji, Sokan-Adeaga Micheal; Deborah, Sokan-Adeaga Eniola",J.

Recent findings on the role of PLA2 in the pathobiology of COVID-19 are also discussed. EXPERT OPINION: Although a number of PLA2 inhibitors have entered clinical trials, none has reached the market yet. Lipoprotein-associated PLA2 is now considered a biomarker of vascular inflammation rather than a therapeutic target for inhibitors like darapladib. Inhibitors of cytosolic PLA2 may find topical applications for diseases like atopic dermatitis and psoriasis. Inhibitors of secreted PLA2, varespladib and varespladib methyl, are under investigation for repositioning in snakebite envenoming. A deeper understanding of PLA2 enzymes is needed for the development of novel selective inhibitors.

However, isolation and social distancing are seemed to be effective preventive measures to control this pandemic. Therefore, in this paper, an optimization problem is formulated that accommodates both isolation and social distancing features of the individuals. To promote social distancing, we solve the formulated problem by applying a noncooperative game that can provide an incentive for maintaining social distancing to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Furthermore, the sustainability of the lockdown policy is interpreted with the help of our proposed game-theoretic incentive model for maintaining social distancing where there exists a Nash equilibrium. Finally, we perform an extensive numerical analysis that shows the effectiveness of the proposed approach in terms of achieving the desired social-distancing to prevent the outbreak of the COVID-19 in a noncooperative environment. Numerical results show that the individual incentive increases more than 85% with an increasing percentage of home isolation from 25% to 100% for all considered scenarios. The numerical results also demonstrate that in a particular percentage of home isolation, the individual incentive decreases with an increasing number of individuals.","Bairagi, Anupam Kumar; Masud, Mehedi; Kim, Do Hyeon; Munir, Md.

METHODS: The purpose of our retrospective study was to evaluate the prevalence of asymptomatic DVT in lower limbs in critically ill COVID-19 patients (n = 23) with severe respiratory failure and high levels of D-dimer by bedside Doppler ultrasound (DU). RESULTS: DVT was diagnosed in 14 cases (60.87%), 5 in proximal venous territory and 9 in infrapopliteal veins. Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiography (CTPA) was performed in six patients and all of them showed acute pulmonary embolism (APE) at segmental or subsegmental branches of pulmonary arteries. These patients (APE or DVT confirmed) were treated with therapeutic doses of anticoagulant therapy. CONCLUSION: In critically COVID-19 ill ICU patients with severe respiratory failure and elevated D-dimer, the incidence of asymptomatic DVT is high. We propose that DU allows detection of DVT in asymptomatic patients, adding a factor that may balance the decision to fully anticoagulate these patients.","Alfageme, Marta; González Plaza, Jorge; Méndez, Santiago; Gómez Patiño, Juan A; Collado, María L; Abadal, José M; González Costero, Rocío; Fontanilla, Teresa; García Suárez, Agustín",Ultrasound J,,360

415805,Application of intelligent virtual reality technology in Clothing virtual wear and color saturation after COVID-19 epidemic situation,2020,"Local M-smoothers are interesting and important signal and image processing techniques with many connections to other methods. In our paper we derive a family of partial differential equations (PDEs) that result in one, two, and three dimensions as limiting processes from M-smoothers which are based on local order-$p$ means within a ball the radius of which tends to zero. The order $p$ may take any nonzero value $>-1$, allowing also negative values. In contrast to results from the literature, we show in the space-continuous case that mode filtering does not arise for $p \to 0$, but for $p \to -1$. Extending our filter class to $p$-values smaller than $-1$ allows to include e.g. the classical image sharpening flow of Gabor. The PDEs we derive in 1D, 2D, and 3D show large structural similarities. Since our PDE class is highly anisotropic and may contain backward parabolic operators, designing adequate numerical methods is difficult. We present an $L^\infty$-stable explicit finite difference scheme that satisfies a discrete maximum--minimum principle, offers excellent rotation invariance, and employs a splitting into four fractional steps to allow larger time step sizes. Although it approximates parabolic PDEs, it consequently benefits from stabilisation concepts from the numerics of hyperbolic PDEs. Our 2D experiments show that the PDEs for $p<1$ are of specific interest: Their backward parabolic term creates favourable sharpening properties, while they appear to maintain the strong shape simplification properties of mean curvature motion.","Welk, Martin; Weickert, Joachim",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.13191v1.pdf,360

We aim to quantify excess stroke-related deaths and characterize its association with social distancing behavior and COVID-19-related vascular pathology. METHODS: United States and state-level excess cerebrovascular deaths from January to May 2020 were quantified using National Center for Health Statistic data and Poisson regression models. Excess cerebrovascular deaths were analyzed as a function of time-varying stroke-related emergency medical service (EMS) calls and cumulative COVID-19 deaths using linear regression. A state-level regression analysis was performed to determine the association between excess cerebrovascular deaths and time spent in residences, measured by Google Community Mobility Reports, during the height of the pandemic after the first COVID-19 death (February 29). RESULTS: Forty states and New York City were included. Excess cerebrovascular mortality occurred nationally from the weeks ending March 28 to May 2, 2020, up to a 7.8% increase above expected levels during the week of April 18. Decreased stroke-related EMS calls were associated with excess stroke deaths one (70 deaths per 1000 fewer EMS calls [95% CI, 20-118]) and 2 weeks (85 deaths per 1000 fewer EMS calls [95% CI, 37-133]) later. Twenty-three states and New York City experienced excess cerebrovascular mortality during the pandemic height. A 10% increase in time spent at home was associated with a 4.3% increase in stroke deaths (incidence rate ratio, 1.043 [95% CI, 1.001-1.085]) after adjusting for COVID-19 deaths. CONCLUSIONS: Excess US cerebrovascular deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic were observed and associated with decreases in stroke-related EMS calls nationally and mobility at the state level. Public health measures are needed to identify and counter the reticence to seeking medical care for acute stroke during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Sharma, Richa; Kuohn, Lindsey R; Weinberger, Daniel M; Warren, Joshua L; Sansing, Lauren H; Jasne, Adam; Falcone, Guido; Dhand, Amar; Sheth, Kevin N",Stroke,,360

PSR J0537-6910 is a young energetic X-ray pulsar and is the most frequent glitcher known. The inter-glitch braking index of the pulsar suggests that gravitational-wave emission due to r-mode oscillations may play an important role in the spin evolution of this pulsar. Theoretical models confirm this possibility and predict emission at a level that can be probed by ground-based detectors. In order to explore this scenario, we search for r-mode emission in the epochs between glitches by using a contemporaneous timing ephemeris obtained from NICER data. We do not detect any signals in the theoretically expected band of 86-97 Hz, and report upper limits on the amplitude of the gravitational waves. Our results improve on previous amplitude upper limits from r-modes in J0537-6910 by a factor of up to 3 and place stringent constraints on theoretical models for r-mode driven spin-down in PSR J0537-6910, especially for higher frequencies at which our results reach below the spin-down limit defined by energy conservation.","Collaboration, The LIGO Scientific; Collaboration, the Virgo; Abbott, the KAGRA Collaboration R.; Abbott, T.

For this purpose, an oral surgery simulator, ""Kobra"", was implemented in student training and was evaluated for dental education. Dental students (group 1, third-year and group 2, fourth-year) and dentists of the faculty (control group) were trained to use the simulator. The outcomes for group 1 (apicoectomy of an upper lateral incisor with Kobra), group 2 (removal of an impacted lower wisdom tooth with Kobra) and the control group (both procedures with Kobra) were evaluated. For evaluation purposes, subjective parameters (improvement of practical skills, comparison between conventional training and Kobra simulation, and implementation of simulation-based teaching) and objective parameters (removal of bone, tooth substance and soft tissue measured while performing the Kobra simulation) were assessed using questionnaires with a scale ranging from 1-5. A total of 49 students (third-year n = 29, with 22 women and 7 men; fourth-year n = 20, with 17 women and 3 men) and 10 dentists (women n = 5 and men n = 5) participated. Compared to the Kobra simulation, the conventional training method with plastic models was still favored (the difference was non-significant). Compared to the dentists, the simulation data showed a less precise surgical performance of the students (the difference was not significant). The Kobra simulation may offer an additional method to conventional surgery training using plastic models, with benefits for students and faculty staff.","Buchbender, Mayte; Maser, Mathias; Neukam, Friedrich W; Kesting, Marco R; Attia, Sameh; Schmitt, Christian M",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,360

419016,Distance learning: opportunities and challenges in quarantine,2020,"Annotation studies often require annotators to familiarize themselves with the task, its annotation scheme, and the data domain. This can be overwhelming in the beginning, mentally taxing, and induce errors into the resulting annotations; especially in citizen science or crowd sourcing scenarios where domain expertise is not required and only annotation guidelines are provided. To alleviate these issues, we propose annotation curricula, a novel approach to implicitly train annotators. Our goal is to gradually introduce annotators into the task by ordering instances that are annotated according to a learning curriculum. To do so, we first formalize annotation curricula for sentence- and paragraph-level annotation tasks, define an ordering strategy, and identify well-performing heuristics and interactively trained models on three existing English datasets. We then conduct a user study with 40 voluntary participants who are asked to identify the most fitting misconception for English tweets about the Covid-19 pandemic. Our results show that using a simple heuristic to order instances can already significantly reduce the total annotation time while preserving a high annotation quality. Annotation curricula thus can provide a novel way to improve data collection. To facilitate future research, we further share our code and data consisting of 2,400 annotations.","Lee, Ji-Ung; Klie, Jan-Christoph; Gurevych, Iryna",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.02382v2.pdf,360

420535,Simple bayesian forecast combination,2021,"AIMS: It remains unclear whether the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is having an impact on suicide rates (SR). Economic insecurity and mental disorders are risk factors for suicide, which may increase during the pandemic. METHODS: Data on suicide events in a major city in Germany, and the corresponding life years (LY) were provided by the local authorities. For the year 2020, periods without restrictions on freedom of movement and social contact were compared with periods of moderate and severe COVID-19 restrictions. To avoid distortions due to seasonal fluctuations and linear time trends, suicide risk during the COVID-19 pandemic was compared with data from 2010 to 2019 using an interrupted time series analysis. RESULTS: A total of 643 suicides were registered and 6 032 690 LY were spent between 2010 and 2020. Of these, 53 suicides and 450 429 LY accounted for the year 2020.In 2020, SR (suicides per 100 000 LY) were lower in periods with severe COVID-19 restrictions (SR = 7.2, &#967;2 = 4.033, p = 0.045) compared with periods without restrictions (SR = 16.8). A comparison with previous years showed that this difference was caused by unusually high SR before the imposition of restrictions, while SR during the pandemic were within the trend corridor of previous years (expected suicides = 32.3, observed suicides = 35; IRR = 1.084, p = 0.682). CONCLUSIONS: SR during COVID-19 pandemic are in line with the trend in previous years. Careful monitoring of SR in the further course of the COVID-19 crisis is urgently needed. The findings have regional reference and should not be over-generalised.","Radeloff, Daniel; Papsdorf, Rainer; Uhlig, Kirsten; Vasilache, Andreas; Putnam, Karen; von Klitzing, Kai",Epidemiol Psychiatr Sci,,360

A significant proportion of these patients require admission to intensive care units for acute hypoxic respiratory failure and are at an increased risk of developing cardiac arrhythmias. The presence of underlying comorbidities, pathophysiologic changes imposed by the disease, and concomitant polypharmacy, increase the likelihood of life-threatening arrhythmias in these patients. Supraventricular, as well as ventricular arrhythmias, are common and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. It is important to understand the interplay of various causal factors while instituting strategies to mitigate the impact of modifiable risk factors.

421668,A comprehensive overview on the implications of financial stability and key policies that will mitigate the impacts of COVID-19,2020,"Since the discovery of lymphocytes with immunosuppressive activity, increasing interest has arisen in their possible influence on the immune response induced by vaccines. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are essential for maintaining peripheral tolerance, preventing autoimmune diseases, and limiting chronic inflammatory diseases. However, they also limit beneficial immune responses by suppressing anti-infectious and anti-tumor immunity. Mounting evidence suggests that Tregs are involved, at least in part, in the low effectiveness of immunization against various diseases where it has been difficult to obtain protective vaccines. Interestingly, increased activity of Tregs is associated with aging, suggesting a key role for these cells in the lower vaccine effectiveness observed in older people. In this review, we analyze the impact of Tregs on vaccination, with a focus on older adults. Finally, we address an overview of current strategies for Tregs modulation with potential application to improve the effectiveness of future vaccines targeting older populations.","Batista-Duharte, Alexander; Pera, Alejandra; Aliño, Salvador F; Solana, Rafael",Int Immunopharmacol,,360

421892,From Artificial Intelligence Bias to Inequality in the Time of COVID-19,2021,"Coronaviruses are adept at evading host antiviral pathways induced by viral double-stranded RNA, including interferon (IFN) signaling, oligoadenylate synthetase-ribonuclease L (OAS-RNase L), and protein kinase R (PKR). While dysregulated or inadequate IFN responses have been associated with severe coronavirus infection, the extent to which the recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 activates or antagonizes these pathways is relatively unknown. We found that SARS-CoV-2 infects patient-derived nasal epithelial cells, present at the initial site of infection; induced pluripotent stem cell-derived alveolar type 2 cells (iAT2), the major cell type infected in the lung; and cardiomyocytes (iCM), consistent with cardiovascular consequences of COVID-19 disease. Robust activation of IFN or OAS-RNase L is not observed in these cell types, whereas PKR activation is evident in iAT2 and iCM. In SARS-CoV-2-infected Calu-3 and A549ACE2 lung-derived cell lines, IFN induction remains relatively weak; however, activation of OAS-RNase L and PKR is observed. This is in contrast to Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV, which effectively inhibits IFN signaling and OAS-RNase L and PKR pathways, but is similar to mutant MERS-CoV lacking innate immune antagonists. Remarkably, OAS-RNase L and PKR are activated in MAVS knockout A549ACE2 cells, demonstrating that SARS-CoV-2 can induce these host antiviral pathways despite minimal IFN production. Moreover, increased replication and cytopathic effect in RNASEL knockout A549ACE2 cells implicates OAS-RNase L in restricting SARS-CoV-2. Finally, while SARS-CoV-2 fails to antagonize these host defense pathways, which contrasts with other coronaviruses, the IFN signaling response is generally weak. These host-virus interactions may contribute to the unique pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2.","Li, Yize; Renner, David M; Comar, Courtney E; Whelan, Jillian N; Reyes, Hanako M; Cardenas-Diaz, Fabian Leonardo; Truitt, Rachel; Tan, Li Hui; Dong, Beihua; Alysandratos, Konstantinos Dionysios; Huang, Jessie; Palmer, James N; Adappa, Nithin D; Kohanski, Michael A; Kotton, Darrell N; Silverman, Robert H; Yang, Wenli; Morrisey, Edward E; Cohen, Noam A; Weiss, Susan R",Proc.

Epidemic fires and locative fears in the Information Age,2020,"The Coronavirus (CoV) is a large family of viruses known to cause illnesses ranging from the common cold to acute respiratory tract infection. The severity of the infection may be visible as pneumonia, acute respiratory syndrome, and even death. Until the outbreak of SARS, this group of viruses was greatly overlooked. However, since the SARS and MERS outbreaks, these viruses have been studied in greater detail, propelling the vaccine research. On December 31, 2019, mysterious cases of pneumonia were detected in the city of Wuhan in China's Hubei Province. On January 7, 2020, the causative agent was identified as a new coronavirus (2019-nCoV), and the disease was later named as COVID-19 by the WHO. The virus spread extensively in the Wuhan region of China and has gained entry to over 210 countries and territories. Though experts suspected that the virus is transmitted from animals to humans, there are mixed reports on the origin of the virus. There are no treatment options available for the virus as such, limited to the use of anti-HIV drugs and/or other antivirals such as Remdesivir and Galidesivir. For the containment of the virus, it is recommended to quarantine the infected and to follow good hygiene practices. The virus has had a significant socio-economic impact globally. Economically, China is likely to experience a greater setback than other countries from the pandemic due to added trade war pressure, which have been discussed in this paper.","Keni, Raghuvir; Alexander, Anila; Nayak, Pawan Ganesh; Mudgal, Jayesh; Nandakumar, Krishnadas",Front.

METHODS: Serum samples from 30 patients were assayed for anti-NP responses, for 'neutralisation' by the surrogate neutralisation assay and for neutralisation by SARS-CoV-2 S pseudotyped virus assays utilising two target cell lines. Correlation between assays was measured using linear regression. RESULTS: The responses observed within the surrogate neutralisation assay demonstrated an extremely strong, highly significant positive correlation with those observed in both pseudotyped virus assays. CONCLUSIONS: The tested ELISA-based surrogate assay provides an immunologically useful measure of functional immune responses in a much quicker and highly automatable fashion. It also reinforces that detection of anti-RBD neutralising antibodies alone is a powerful measure of the capacity to neutralise viral infection.","Murray, Matthew J; McIntosh, Megan; Atkinson, Claire; Mahungu, Tabitha; Wright, Edward; Chatterton, Wendy; Gandy, Michael; Reeves, Matthew B",J Infect,,360

Thus there is an urgent medical need for identification of readily available biomarkers that in patients with SARS-Cov-2 infection are able to; (1) identify patients in most need of medical care prior to admittance to an intensive care unit (ICU), and; (2) identify patients post-infection at risk of developing persistent fibrosis of lungs with subsequent impaired quality of life and increased morbidity and mortality. An intense amount of research have focused on wound healing and Extracellular Matrix (ECM) remodelling of the lungs related to lung function decline in pulmonary fibrosis (PF). A range of non-invasive serological biomarkers, reflecting tissue remodelling, and fibrosis have been shown to predict risk of acute exacerbations, lung function decline and mortality in PF and other interstitial lung diseases (Sand et al. in Respir Res 19:82, 2018). We suggest that lessons learned from such PF studies of the pathological processes leading to lung function decline could be used to better identify patients infected with SARS-Co-V2 at most risk of acute deterioration or persistent fibrotic damage of the lung and could consequently be used to guide treatment decisions.","Leeming, D J; Genovese, F; Sand, J M B; Rasmussen, D G K; Christiansen, C; Jenkins, G; Maher, T M; Vestbo, J; Karsdal, M A",Respir Res,,360

425786,Adopting Automated Bug Assignment in Practice -- A Registered Report of an Industrial Case Study,2021-09-28,"BackgroundCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disparities among vulnerable populations are of paramount concern that extend to vaccine administration. With recent uptick in infection rates, dominance of the delta variant, and proposal of a third booster shot, understanding the population-level vaccine coverage dynamics and underlying sociodemographic factors is critical for achieving equity in public health outcomes. This study aimed to characterize the scope of vaccine inequity in California counties through modeling the trends of vaccination using the Social Vulnerability Index (SVI). MethodsOverall SVI, its four themes, and 9228 data points of daily vaccination numbers from December 15, 2020, to May 23, 2021, across all 58 California counties were used to model the growth velocity and anticipated maximum proportion of population vaccinated, defined as having received at least one dose of vaccine. ResultsBased on the overall SVI, the vaccination coverage velocity was lower in counties in the high vulnerability category (v=0.0346, 95% CI: 0.0334, 0.0358) compared to moderate (v=0.0396, 95% CI: 0.0385, 0.0408) and low (v=0.0414, 95% CI: 0.0403, 0.0425) vulnerability categories. SVI Theme 3 (minority status and language) yielded the largest disparity in coverage velocity between low and high-vulnerable counties (v=0.0423 versus v=0.035, P<0.001). Based on the current trajectory, while counties in low-vulnerability category of overall SVI are estimated to achieve a higher proportion of vaccinated individuals, our models yielded a higher asymptotic maximum for highly vulnerable counties of Theme 3 (K=0.544, 95% CI: 0.527, 0.561) compared to low-vulnerability counterparts (K=0.441, 95% CI: 0.432, 0.450). The largest disparity in asymptotic proportion vaccinated between the low and high-vulnerability categories was observed in Theme 2 describing the household composition and disability (K=0.602, 95% CI: 0.592, 0.612; versus K=0.425, 95% CI: 0.413, 0.436). Overall, the large initial disparities in vaccination rates by SVI status attenuated over time, particularly based on Theme 3 status which yielded a large decrease in cumulative vaccination rate ratio of low to high-vulnerability categories from 1.42 to 0.95 (P=0.002). ConclusionsThis study provides insight into the problem of COVID-19 vaccine disparity across California which can help promote equity during the current pandemic and guide the allocation of future vaccines such as COVID-19 booster shots. Key MessagesO_LIThe Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) and its four themes along with the daily proportion of vaccinated individuals across the 58 California counties were used to model, overall and by theme, the growth velocity and anticipated maximum proportion of population vaccinated.

428430,COVID-19 leadership challenges in knowledge work,2021,"BACKGROUND: Brazil is witnessing a massive increase of corona virus disease (COVID-19). Its peculiar primary health care (PHC) system faces a burden due to the contagion occurring in the community environment. Then, the aim is to estimate the effect of the coverage of primary health care and social isolation on the evolution of confirmed cases and deaths by COVID-19, controlling sociodemographic, economic and health system aspects. METHODS: A time series design was designed with data on diagnosed cases of COVID-19 and their deaths as outcomes in the capital cities of the Northeast region of Brazil. Independent variables such as PHC coverage, hospital beds, social isolation, demographic density, Gini index and other indicators were analyzed. A Autoregressive Generalized Linear Model method was applied for model the relationship. RESULTS: We identified an exponential growth of cases (y = 0.00250.71x; p-value<0,001). However, there is a high variability in the occurrence of outcomes. PHC coverage&#8805;75% (&#967;2 = 9.27; p-value = 0.01) and social isolation rate (&#967;2 = 365.99; p-value<0.001) proved to be mitigating factors for the spread of COVID-19 and its deaths. Capitals with hospital beds &#8805; 3.2 per thousand inhabitants had fewer deaths (&#967;2 = 9.02; p-value = 0.003), but this was influenced by PHC coverage (&#967;2 = 30,87; p-value<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: PHC mitigates the occurrence of Covid-19 and its deaths in a region of social vulnerability in Brazil together with social isolation. However, it is not known until when the system will withstand the overload in view of the low adhesion to social isolation, the lack of support and appropriate direction from the government to its population.","Costa de Assis, Sanderson José; Lopes, Johnnatas Mikael; Guedes, Marcello Barbosa Otoni Gonçalves; Sanchis, Geronimo José Bouzas; Araujo, Diego Neves; Roncalli, Angelo Giuseppe",PLoS One,,360
428497,Self-directed experiential learning to meet ever-changing entrepreneurship demands,2020,"The global Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to the implementation of social distancing measures such as work-from-home orders that have drastically changed people's travel-related behavior. As countries are easing up these measures and people are resuming their pre-pandemic activities, the second wave of COVID-19 is observed in many countries. This study proposes a Community Activity Score (CAS) based on inter-community traffic characteristics (in and out of community traffic volume and travel distance) to capture the current travel-related activity level compared to the pre-pandemic baseline and study its relationship with confirmed COVID-19 cases. Fourteen other travel-related factors belonging to five categories (Social Distancing Index, residents staying at home, travel frequency and distance, mobility trend, and out-of-county visitors) and three social distancing measures (stay-at-home order, face-covering order, and self-quarantine for out-of-county travels) are also considered to reflect the likelihood of exposure to the COVID-19. Considering that it usually takes days from exposure to confirming the infection, the exposure-to-confirm temporal delay between the time-varying travel-related factors and their impacts on the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases is considered in this study. Honolulu County in the State of Hawaii is used as a case study to evaluate the proposed CAS and other factors on confirmed COVID-19 cases with various temporal delays at a county-level. Negative Binomial models were chosen to study the impacts of travel-related factors and social distancing measures on COVID-19 cases. The case study results show that CAS and other factors are correlated with COVID-19 spread, and models that factor in the exposure-to-confirm temporal delay perform better in forecasting COVID-19 cases later. Policymakers can use the study's various findings and insights to evaluate the impacts of social distancing policies on travel and effectively allocate resources for the possible increase in confirmed COVID-19 cases.","Guo, Yuntao; Yu, Hao; Zhang, Guohui; Ma, David T",Health Place,,360

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 66 patients with 264 central incisors in good periodontal health were included in this cross-sectional study. CBCT images were used to assess gingiva and alveolar bone thickness of the maxillary and mandibular incisors at four vertical levels. Cephalometric analysis was used to assess the sagittal profile of the craniofacial structures. Gingival thickness was compared in patients with different craniofacial profiles based on ANB value. Linear regression coefficients adjusted by age and gender were used to evaluate the correlation between gingival thickness and the cephalometric parameters. RESULTS: Individuals with a smaller ANB value (ANB< 2) presented with thinner supporting tissue and a keratinized gingiva width in the anterior zone. Labial gingival thickness on the mandibular incisors at the cementoenamel junction (G1) and at the alveolar bone crest (G2) was positively related to cephalometric measures, indicating a maxillae-mandibular sagittal relationship (ANB value, Wits appraisal, A-NPog value). CONCLUSIONS: A moderate correlation was found between mandibular gingival thickness and the sagittal craniofacial profile. Patients with a concave craniofacial profile had a smaller keratinized gingiva width and gingival thickness in the aesthetic zone. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Knowledge of these features on supporting tissue and their correlations with craniofacial morphology will help clinicians to develop a reasonable treatment plan and make decisions to achieve the best aesthetic outcome.","Cha, Sa; Lee, Sueng Min; Zhang, Chengxiaoxue; Tan, Zhen; Zhao, Qing",,,360

While diabetes does not seem to be associated with an increased risk of COVID19 infection per se, it has been clearly demonstrated that the presence of hyperglycemia of any degree predisposes to worse outcomes, such as more severe respiratory involvement, ICU admissions, need for mechanical ventilation and mortality. Further, COVID19 infection has been associated with the development of new-onset hyperglycemia and diabetes, and worsening of glycemic control in pre-existing diabetes, due to direct pancreatic damage by the virus, body's stress response to infection (including cytokine storm) and use of diabetogenic drugs such as corticosteroids in the treatment of severe COVID19. In addition, public health measures taken to flatten the pandemic curve (such as lockdowns) can also adversely impact persons with diabetes by limiting their access to clinical care, healthy diet, and opportunities to exercise. Most antidiabetic medications can continue to be used in patients with mild COVID19 but switching over to insulin is preferred in severe disease.","Unnikrishnan, Ranjit; Misra, Anoop",Nutr Diabetes,,360

These exacerbated a complex fear among the public. The aim of this article is, therefore, to understand the public perception of socioeconomic crisis and human stress in resource-limited settings of Bangladesh during the COVID-19 outbreak. The sample comprised of 1066 Bangladeshi participants. Principal component analysis (PCA) was considered to design a standardized scale to measure the mental stress and socioeconomic crisis, one-way ANOVA and t-test were conducted to perceive different demographic risk groups; multiple linear regression was applied to estimate the statistically significant association between each component, and classical test theory (CTT) analysis was applied to examine the reliability of each item according to the components to develop a composite score. Without safeguarding the fundamental needs for the vulnerable ultra-poor group can undeniably cause the socioeconomic crisis and mental stress due to the COVID-19 lockdown. It has further created unemployment, deprivation, hunger, and social conflicts. The weak governance in the fragile healthcare system exacerbates the general public's anxiety as the COVID-19 testing facilities are centered around in the urban areas, a long serial to be tested, minimum or no treatment facilities in the dedicated hospital units for COVID-19 patients are the chief observations hampered along with the disruption of other critical healthcare services. One-way ANOVA and t-test confirmed food and nutritional deficiency among the vulnerable poorest section due to loss of livelihood. Also, different emergency service provider professions such as doctors, healthcare staff, police forces, volunteer organizations at the frontline, and bankers are at higher risk of infection and subsequently mentally stressed. Proper risk assessment of the pandemic and dependable risk communications to risk groups, multi-sectoral management taskforce development, transparency, and good governance with inter-ministerial coordination is required along with strengthening healthcare capacity was suggested to reduce mental and social stress causing a socioeconomic crisis of COVID-19 outbreak. Moreover, relief for the low-income population, proper biomedical waste management through incineration, and preparation for the possible natural disasters such as flood, cyclones, and another infectious disease such as dengue was suggested.

429747,(Machine) learning from the COVID-19 lockdown about electricity market performance with a large share of renewables,2021,"The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) now is considered a global public health emergency. One of the unprecedented challenges is defining the optimal therapy for those patients with severe pneumonia and systemic manifestations of COVID-19. The optimal therapy should be largely based on the pathogenesis of infections caused by this novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Since the onset of COVID-19, there have been many prepublications and publications reviewing the therapy of COVID-19 as well as many prepublications and publications reviewing the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2. However, there have been no comprehensive reviews that link COVID-19 therapies to the pathogenic mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2. To link COVID-19 therapies to pathogenic mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2, we performed a comprehensive search through MEDLINE, PubMed, medRxiv, EMBASE, Scopus, Google Scholar, and Web of Science using the following keywords: COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, novel 2019 coronavirus, pathology, pathologic, pathogenesis, pathophysiology, coronavirus pneumonia, coronavirus infection, coronavirus pulmonary infection, coronavirus cardiovascular infection, coronavirus gastroenteritis, coronavirus autopsy findings, viral sepsis, endotheliitis, thrombosis, coagulation abnormalities, immunology, humeral immunity, cellular immunity, inflammation, cytokine storm, superantigen, therapy, treatment, therapeutics, immune-based therapeutics, antiviral agents, respiratory therapy, oxygen therapy, anticoagulation therapy, adjuvant therapy, and preventative therapy. Opinions expressed in this review also are based on personal experience as clinicians, authors, peer reviewers, and editors. This narrative review linking COVID-19 therapies with pathogenic mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in six major therapeutic goals for COVID-19 therapy based on the pathogenic mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2. These goals are listed below: 1. The first goal is identifying COVID-19 patients that require both testing and therapy. This is best accomplished with a COVID-19 molecular test from symptomatic patients as well as determining the oxygen saturation in such patients with a pulse oximeter. Whether a symptomatic respiratory illness is COVID-19, influenza, or another respiratory pathogen, an oxygen saturation less than 90% means that the patient requires medical assistance. 2. The second goal is to correct the hypoxia. This goal generally requires hospitalization for oxygen therapy; other respiratory-directed therapies such as prone positioning or mechanical ventilation are often used in the attempt to correct hypoxemia due to COVID-19. 3. The third goal is to reduce the viral load of SARS-CoV-2. Ideally, there would be an oral antiviral agent available such as seen with the use of oseltamivir phosphate for influenza. This oral antiviral agent should be taken early in the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Such an oral agent is not available yet. Currently, two options are available for reducing the viral load of SARS-CoV-2. These are post-Covid-19 plasma with a high neutralizing antibody titer against SARS-CoV-2 or intravenous remdesivir; both options require hospitalization. 4. The fourth goal is to identify and address the hyperinflammation phase often seen in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Currently, fever with an elevated C-reactive protein is useful for diagnosing this hyperinflammation syndrome. Low-dose dexamethasone therapy currently is the best therapeutic approach. 5. The fifth goal is to identify and address the hypercoagulability phase seen in many hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Patients who would benefit from anticoagulation therapy can be identified by a marked increase in d-dimer and prothrombin time with a decrease in fibrinogen. To correct this disseminated intravascular coagulation-like phase, anticoagulation therapy with low molecular weight heparin is preferred. Anticoagulation therapy with unfractionated heparin is preferred in COVID-19 patients with acute kidney injuries. 6. The last goal is prophylaxis for persons who are not yet infected. Potential supplements include vitamin D and zinc. Although the data for such supplements is not extremely strong, it can be argued that almost 50% of the population worldwide has a vitamin D deficiency. Correcting this deficiency would be beneficial regardless of any impact of COVID-19. Similarly, zinc is an important supplement that is important in one's diet regardless of any effect on SARS-CoV-2. As emerging therapies are found to be more effective against the SARS-CoV-2 pathogenic mechanisms identified, they can be substituted for those therapies presented in this review.","Stratton, Charles W; Tang, Yi-Wei; Lu, Hongzhou",J Med Virol,,360

Consequently, multiple federal and state governments have placed restrictions on hospitals such as limiting ""elective surgery"" and recommending social or physical distancing. We review the literature on several areas that have been affected including surgical selection, inpatient care, and physician well-being. These areas affecting inpatient paradigms include surgical priority, physical or social distancing, file sharing for online clinical communications, and physician wellness. During this crisis, it is important that orthopaedic departments place an emphasis on personnel safety and slowing the spread of the virus so that the department can still maintain vital functions. Physical distancing and emerging technologies such as inpatient telemedicine and online file sharing applications can enable orthopaedic programs to still function while attempting to protect medical staff and patients from the novel coronavirus spread. This literature review sought to provide evidence-based guidance to orthopaedic departments during an unprecedented time. Orthopaedic surgeons should follow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines, wear personal protective equipment (PPE) when appropriate, have teams created using physical distancing, understand the department's policy on elective surgery, and engage in routines which enhance physician wellness.","Massey, Patrick A; McClary, Kaylan; Zhang, Andrew S; Savoie, Felix H; Barton, R Shane",J Am Acad Orthop Surg,,360

Recent epidemiological data documented intriguing differences in prevalence of chemosensory dysfunctions between different world regions. Viral genetic factors as well as host genetic factors appear to be relevant; however, it is not yet known which mutations or polymorphisms actually contribute to such phenotypic differences between populations. Here, we discuss recent genetic and epidemiological data on the D614G spike protein variant and assess whether current evidence is consistent with the notion that this single nucleotide polymorphism augments chemosensory impairments in COVID-19 patients. We hypothesize that this spike variant is an important viral genetic factor that facilitates infection of chemosensory epithelia, possibly acting together with yet to be identified host factors, and thereby increases smell and taste impairment. We suggest that the prevalence of chemosensory deficits may reflect the pandemic potential for transmissibility and spread which differs between populations.","Butowt, Rafal; Bilinska, Katarzyna; Von Bartheld, Christopher S",ACS Chem Neurosci,,360

Although the respiratory system remains the most frequently affected organ, several case reports have revealed that the complications are not merely limited to the respiratory system, and neurotropic and neuroinvasive properties have also been observed, leading to neurological diseases. In the present paper, it was intended to review the possible neuroinvasive routes of SARS-CoV-2 and its mechanisms that may cause neurological damage. Additionally, the neurological manifestations of COVID-19 across the globe were discussed with emphasis on Iran, while highlighting the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the central and peripheral nervous systems.","Aslan, Cynthia; Nikfarjam, Sepideh; Asadzadeh, Mohammad; Jafari, Reza",J Neurovirol,,360

The need for more agile structures and more efficient mechanisms to transfer globally dispersed knowledge are two key enablers in this evolution. With increased interest, this paper offers the first systematic, integrative review of 100 articles on FGWAs. The review indicates that these forms of global work appear to be a somewhat overlooked double-edged sword in that they may confer significant but unrealised value for MNEs alongside hidden, adverse consequences for individuals. Notable was the lack of insight into the HR function's input or oversight at either a strategic or operational level. We find that there is a distinct lack of strategic linkages to global mobility and/or HR functions. We propose a research agenda that centres on better understanding the international HR function's role and responsibility in providing a more strategic and sustainable perspective of these increasingly common FGWAs alongside virtual work. The COVID-19 pandemic may offer a critical juncture point in which there is greater strategic consideration on the utilisation and support of such arrangements.","Jooss, Stefan; McDonnell, Anthony; Conroy, Kieran",Hum.

He has no other health conditions of note. Brian lives with his parents and an older brother, who also has ASD, in a rural area 2 hours from the center where he was diagnosed. Brian has a history of intermittent self-injurious behaviors (head-banging, throwing himself onto the floor, etc.) that regularly result in bruising, intense and lengthy tantrums, and aggression toward family and teachers. Brian will occasionally indicate items that he wants, but otherwise has no functional communication skills. Over the past 18 months, Brian's challenging behaviors have waxed and waned. The regional special education program is not equipped to safely manage his behaviors, and there are no in-home or center-based agencies that provide applied behavior analysis (ABA) available. Brian's developmental pediatrician initiated guanfacine (eventually adding a small dose of aripiprazole) and referred the family to psychology for weekly telehealth behavioral parent training to address behavioral concerns using the Research Units in Behavioral Intervention curriculum.Brian's behavioral problems decreased during the initial weeks of the COVID-19 crisis, when he no longer had to leave home or attend special education. However, as summer continued, his behaviors worsened substantially (regular bruising and tissue damage, numerous after-hours consultations with his psychologist and developmental pediatrician, and one trip to the emergency department). The intensity of Brian's behaviors (maintained primarily by access to tangible items and escape from demands) made progress with behavioral supports slow and discouraging for his parents. Other psychosocial stressors coalesced for the family as well, including employment loss, limited social support because of social distancing requirements, and illness of one of his parents. The developmental pediatrician continued to modify the medication regimen over the summer, transitioning Brian from guanfacine to clonidine and increasing his aripiprazole incrementally (with clear increased benefit); hydroxyzine was also used as needed during the episodes of highest intensity.Despite the availability of best-practice guidelines for children with Brian's presenting concerns, a confluence of barriers (geographic, economic, ABA work force, global pandemic, etc.) present serious questions for his family and care team related to the next steps in Brian's care. Should he attend in-person school in the fall, knowing that the available program may have limited educational benefit and increase his risk of COVID-19 exposure (not to mention self-injury)? Would the potential benefits of cross-country travel to an intensive behavioral treatment program outweigh the associated psychosocial and economic stressors?

435003,Organizational Resilience for a New Normal: Balancing the Paradox of Global Interdependence,2020,"Purpose This paper aims to analyse the most significant disruptive events affecting tourism during the twenty-first century, particularly the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. Design/methodology/approach Based on a thorough literature review, this study takes a complexity science approach to the field of tourism to shed light on the challenges of disruptive events in tourism systems. Findings Focusing on the COVID-19 pandemic, in particular, this study acknowledges that disruptive events are complex and have tremendous impacts on several areas of society: people's psychological well-being and the health-care system, as well as social, economic, cultural, technological, environmental and political dimensions. Whether they occur alone or interact, these dimensions add varying levels of complexity to the tourism system. In response, the tourism industry can adopt a resilience model as a crisis management tool to address disruptive events affecting this field. Research limitations/implications As this paper is mainly theoretical, future empirical research will contribute to refining the findings and testing the usefulness of the proposed model. Practical implications The paper looks at examples of successful and unsuccessful of COVID-19 outbreak management in various countries to analyse issues such as crisis management, resilience and tools for coping with the impacts of disruptive events. Originality/value This theoretical paper proposes a first taxonomy of the multidimensional impacts of twenty-first-century disruptive events on tourism and dissects the phases of crisis management, with a corresponding conceptual model.","Aldao, C.; Blasco, D.; Espallargas, M.

METHODS: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement was consulted to report this systematic review. Relevant articles were retrieved from PubMed, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, Cochrane Library, and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), VIP (Chinese) database. RESULTS: A total of 21 studies met our inclusion criteria. Meta-analyses suggest that mask use provided a significant protective effect (OR = 0.35 and 95% CI = 0.24-0.51). Use of masks by healthcare workers (HCWs) and non-healthcare workers (Non-HCWs) can reduce the risk of respiratory virus infection by 80% (OR = 0.20, 95% CI = 0.11-0.37) and 47% (OR = 0.53, 95% CI = 0.36-0.79). The protective effect of wearing masks in Asia (OR = 0.31) appeared to be higher than that of Western countries (OR = 0.45). Masks had a protective effect against influenza viruses (OR = 0.55), SARS (OR = 0.26), and SARS-CoV-2 (OR = 0.04). In the subgroups based on different study designs, protective effects of wearing mask were significant in cluster randomized trials and observational studies. CONCLUSIONS: This study adds additional evidence of the enhanced protective value of masks, we stress that the use masks serve as an adjunctive method regarding the COVID-19 outbreak.","Liang, Mingming; Gao, Liang; Cheng, Ce; Zhou, Qin; Uy, John Patrick; Heiner, Kurt; Sun, Chenyu",Travel Med Infect Dis,,360

We aim to provide evidence for clinical diagnosis and assessment of severity by analyzing patients' clinical data and early laboratory results and exploring the correlation between laboratory results and clinical classification. MATERIAL AND METHODS We enrolled 283 cases of suspected and diagnosed COVID-19 from 16 hospitals in Jiangsu Province from January to April 2020. The routine laboratory blood examinations, T lymphocyte subsets, and biochemical and coagulation function among different populations were contrasted by t test and chi-square (&#967;²) test. RESULTS Cough, fever, and dyspnea could be helpful to diagnose COVID-19 infection (P<0.05). Patients who were older or had comorbidities tended to become severe and critical cases. Among all the patients, the most obvious abnormal laboratory results were higher neutrophil count, CRP, total bilirubin, BUN, CRE, APTT, PT, and D-dimer, and lower blood platelet and lymphocyte count. CD3âº T cell, CD4âº T cell, and CD8âº T cell counts gradually decreased with exacerbation of the disease (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS Cough and fever were the most common symptom. Patients with comorbidities were in more serious condition.

438350,COVID and cities - A new demon that points at old problems: How can research help?,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Uncertainty and discovery have been two fundamental processes in the response to the Covid-19 pandemic. We continue to recognize new manifestations and complications of this syndrome and its respiratory manifestations. Two recently recognized complications of Covid-19 are pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum with the interesting caveat that these diagnoses can be early manifestations, complications of mechanical ventilation, or can develop late in disease course after other clinical signs have long since begun to improve. Here, we present the case of a young man whose Covid-19 convalescence was disrupted by development of a pneumothorax with early tension physiology. CASE: Our patient was a 34-year-old white, nonsmoking male with a history of asthma and morbid obesity. Five weeks before presentation he was diagnosed with an asymptomatic case of Covid-19 after his symptomatic wife tested positive. Seven days later, he required admission to the ICU for worsening respiratory failure and spent a total of eight days in the ICU receiving oxygen via high-flow nasal cannula but did not require intubation. He was weaned to four liters of oxygen via nasal cannula after a ten day hospitalization and discharged home with instructions to follow up with his outpatient pulmonologist. He was convalescing well with reduced oxygen requirements until 18 days later, when he experienced the sudden onset of worsening dyspnea, prompting him to return to the emergency department. Initial imaging revealed a large left-sided pneumothorax with mediastinal shift and early tension physiology, for which emergency chest tube decompression was performed. His left lung re-expanded immediately after chest tube placement and he was able to rapidly tolerate a clamping trial followed by removal three days later. He was subsequently discharged home. DISCUSSION: The lingering sequelae of Covid-19 infection, including radiographic abnormalities, dyspnea, hypoxemic respiratory failure, and fatigue continue to present challenges for patients and providers. In this case, the sudden worsening of the patient's previously improving clinical course was a key clue to a new etiology of his dyspnea and resulted in appropriate treatment after discovery of the cause. Providers should remain vigilant for pneumothorax in patients with Covid-19, even after their discharge from the hospital.","Chiles, J.

The resulting glycans have unneglectable roles in viral infection and immune response. The spike (S) protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which presents on the surface of matured virion and mediates viral entry into the host, also undergoes extensive glycosylation to shield it from the human defense system. It is believed that the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic with more than 90,000,000 infections and 1,900,000 deaths is partly due to its successful glycosylation strategy. On the other hand, while glycan patches on S protein have been reported to shield the host immune response by masking ""nonself"" viral peptides with ""self-glycans,"" the epitopes are also important in eliciting neutralizing antibodies. In this review, we will summarize the roles of S protein glycans in mediating virus-receptor interactions, and in antibody production, as well as indications for vaccine development.","Zhao, X.; Chen, H.; Wang, H.",Frontiers in Molecular Biosciences,,360

439505,On the Relationship of Cryptocurrency Price with US Stock and Gold Price Using Copula Models,2020,"Whereas recent investigations have revealed viral, inflammatory and vascular factors involved in SARS-CoV-2 lung pathogenesis, the pathophysiology of neurological disorders in COVID-19 remains poorly understood. Olfactory and taste dysfunction are common in COVID-19, especially in mildly symptomatic patients. Here, we conducted a virologic, molecular, and cellular study of the olfactory neuroepithelium of seven patients with COVID-19 presenting with acute loss of smell. We report evidence that the olfactory neuroepithelium may be a major site of SARS-CoV2 infection with multiple cell types, including olfactory sensory neurons, support cells, and immune cells, becoming infected. SARS-CoV-2 replication in the olfactory neuroepithelium was associated with local inflammation. Furthermore, we showed that SARS-CoV-2 induced acute anosmia and ageusia in golden Syrian hamsters, lasting as long as the virus remained in the olfactory epithelium and the olfactory bulb. Finally, olfactory mucosa sampling from patients showing long-term persistence of COVID-19-associated anosmia revealed the presence of virus transcripts and of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells, together with protracted inflammation. SARS-CoV-2 persistence and associated inflammation in the olfactory neuroepithelium may account for prolonged or relapsing symptoms of COVID-19, such as loss of smell, which should be considered for optimal medical management of this disease.","de Melo, Guilherme Dias; Lazarini, Françoise; Levallois, Sylvain; Hautefort, Charlotte; Michel, Vincent; Larrous, Florence; Verillaud, Benjamin; Aparicio, Caroline; Wagner, Sebastien; Gheusi, Gilles; Kergoat, Lauriane; Kornobis, Etienne; Donati, Flora; Cokelaer, Thomas; Hervochon, Rémi; Madec, Yoann; Roze, Emmanuel; Salmon, Dominique; Bourhy, Hervé; Lecuit, Marc; Lledo, Pierre-Marie",Sci. transl. med,,360
440576,International Education at the Coronavirus Crossroads,2020,"COVID-19, the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has become a global pandemic. It dramatically affects people's health and daily life. Neurological complications are increasingly documented for patients with COVID-19. However, the effect of COVID-19 on the brain is less studied, and existing quantitative neuroimaging analyses of COVID-19 were mainly based on the univariate voxel-based morphometry analysis (VBM) that requires corrections for a large number of tests for statistical significance, multivariate approaches that can reduce the number of tests to be corrected have not been applied to study COVID-19 effect on the brain yet. In this study, we leveraged source-based morphometry (SBM) analysis, a multivariate extension of VBM, to identify changes derived from computed tomography scans in covarying gray matter volume patterns underlying COVID-19 in 120 neurological patients (including 58 cases with COVID-19 and 62 patients without COVID-19 matched for age, gender and diseases). SBM identified that lower gray matter volume (GMV) in superior/medial/middle frontal gyri was significantly associated with a higher level of disability (modified Rankin Scale) at both discharge and six months follow-up phases even when controlling for cerebrovascular diseases. GMV in superior/medial/middle frontal gyri was also significantly reduced in patients receiving oxygen therapy compared to patients not receiving oxygen therapy. Patients with fever presented significant GMV reduction in inferior/middle temporal gyri and fusiform gyrus compared to patients without fever. Patients with agitation showed GMV reduction in superior/medial/middle frontal gyri compared to patients without agitation. Patients with COVID-19 showed no significant GMV differences from patients without COVID-19 in any brain region.

This study, catalysed by innovation programs in Ukraine and Latvia, conceptualises, measures and compares key facets of dispositional readiness of university students in two post-Soviet nations for digitalised work.Design/methodology/approachSurvey data, addressing technology attitudes and personal–cultural orientations (PCO), were collected by project teams at universities in Ukraine and Latvia and delivered to the authors for analysis. The authors defined three characteristics of digitalised work, conceptually positioned five of the measured constructs as readiness factors and generated readiness profiles for the two national student cohorts. Investigation of significant differences between the groups was conducted using an Independent Samples T-Test. A composite profile was produced for comparing the overall dispositional readiness of both groups for digitalised work.FindingsThe factor-level profiles showed similar patterns of dispositional alignment and misalignment with digitalised work. For example, technology optimism and learning interest were reported by large percentages of Ukrainians and Latvians and tolerance for unstructured work by small percentages. However, significant differences were found in group levels of technology optimism, technology anxiety, ambiguity intolerance and empowered decision-making. In each case, the Ukrainian profile appeared more strongly aligned with the target.Practical implicationsThe global digitalisation of work requires students, educators, human resource professionals and business leaders to rethink workforce readiness assessment and adapt (re)training programs. Technology enthusiasm and learning interest should be regarded as crucial measurable attitudes motivating technical skills development. Also, cultural orientations should be positioned alongside personality traits and digital skills as factors shaping successful human–computer interaction.Originality/valueThis study initiates a new sociotechnical and cross-cultural trajectory of technology readiness research from data generated in two post-Soviet contexts. Moreover, it positions several measurable dispositions as factors influencing student readiness for digitalised work.","Blayone, Todd J.

Health care personnel (HCP) are essential workers defined as paid and unpaid persons serving in health care settings who have the potential for direct or indirect exposure to patients or infectious materials (3). During February 12-April 9, among 315,531 COVID-19 cases reported to CDC using a standardized form, 49,370 (16%) included data on whether the patient was a health care worker in the United States; including 9,282 (19%) who were identified as HCP. Among HCP patients with data available, the median age was 42 years (interquartile range [IQR] = 32-54 years), 6,603 (73%) were female, and 1,779 (38%) reported at least one underlying health condition. Among HCP patients with data on health care, household, and community exposures, 780 (55%) reported contact with a COVID-19 patient only in health care settings. Although 4,336 (92%) HCP patients reported having at least one symptom among fever, cough, or shortness of breath, the remaining 8% did not report any of these symptoms. Most HCP with COVID-19 (6,760, 90%) were not hospitalized; however, severe outcomes, including 27 deaths, occurred across all age groups; deaths most frequently occurred in HCP aged &#8805;65 years.

441655,Disease spreading with social distancing: a prevention strategy in disordered multiplex networks,2020-04-22,"The COVID-19 pandemic disturbed the world from the beginning of 2020. The high excessive number of patients and the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 in human excreta and urine even after the infected person’s respiratory tests were negative, results in a heavy load of viral in various water bodies and mostly untreated wastewaters. In the present study, the reliability of using small-scale solar thermal desalination systems (solar stills) during a situation like the COVID-19 pandemic is discussed. Pollution of water bodies through the SARS-CoV-2 via numerous routes increases the risk of contaminating the feed water and subsequently the whole structure of solar stills. Since the transmission of pathogens (particle size: 0.5-3 μm) via droplets of water in solar still is reported before, transmitting of SARS-CoV-2 via droplets of water which multiple times smaller (particle size: 60-140 nm) than those pathogens is a concern. The most important issue which must be highlighted is that solar stills worked at low-temperature while the viability and survival of the SARS-CoV-2 in various water matrices in the temperature range (4-37°C) for several days is reported. In this regard, using solar stills during the COVID-19 pandemic need further consideration by all researchers and people around the world.","Parsa, Seyed Masoud",Desalination,,360

Anticoagulants are efficacious, but their optimal preventive doses are unknown. The present study was aimed to compare different enoxaparin doses/kg of body weight in the prevention of clot complications in COVID-19 pneumonia. Retrospective data from a cohort of adult patients hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia, never underwent to oropharyngeal intubation before admission, were collected in an Internal Medicine environments equipped for non-invasive ventilation. Unfavorable outcomes were considered as: deep venous thrombosis, myocardial infarction, stroke, pulmonary embolism, cardiovascular death. Fourteen clinical thromboembolic events among 42 hospitalized patients were observed. Patients were divided into two group on the basis of median heparin dose (0.5 mg-or 50 IU-for kg). The decision about heparin dosing was patient by patient. Higher enoxaparin therapy (mean 0.62±0.16 mg/kg) showed a better thromboprophylactic action (HR=0.2, p=0.04) with respect to lower doses (mean 0.42±0.06 mg/kg), independently from the clinical presentation of the disease. Therefore, COVID-19 pneumonia might request higher enoxaparin doses to reduce thromboembolic events in hospitalized patients, even if outside intensive care units.","Carallo, Claudio; Pugliese, Fabiola; Vettorato, Elisa; Tripolino, Cesare; Delle Donne, Livia; Guarrera, Giovanni; Spagnolli, Walter; Cozzio, Susanna",J. invest. med,,360

444316,Financial System Regulation in a Pandemic: Evidence from Nigeria (preprint),2021,"Paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) poses a serious health threat in Alaska and prevents effective utilization of shellfish resources by subsistence and recreational harvesters. Substantial economic losses also affect shellfish growers during PSP events. The toxins responsible for PSP are produced by dinoflagellates in the genus Alexandrium. Despite the persistent threat posed by PSP and the long history of shellfish toxicity research, there is still confusion concerning the Alexandrium species that cause PSP in Alaska. The primary objective of this study was to identify the toxic Alexandrium species present in Alaska and to develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays for use in screening phytoplankton and sediment samples. Before developing the PCR assays for this study, we evaluated published assays and many were not adequate because of primer dimer formation or because of cross-reactivity. Rather than continue to grapple with the uncertainty and inadequacy of published assays, we developed new assays for the Alexandrium species most likely to be present in Alaska. Only Alexandrium fundyense Group I and A. ostenfeldii were identified from four sampling regions from southeast Alaska to Kodiak Island, indicating that these two species are widely distributed. PCR assays for these two species were converted to quantitative (q)PCR format for use in monitoring programs. During the course of this study, we realized that a systematic evaluation of all published (~150) Alexandrium species-specific assays would be of benefit. Toward this objective, we collated published Alexandrium PCR, qPCR, and in situ hybridization assay primers and probes that targeted the small-subunit (SSU), internal transcribed spacer (ITS/5.8S), or D1-D3 large-subunit (LSU) (SSU/ITS/LSU) ribosomal DNA genes. Each individual primer or probe was screened against the GenBank database and Alexandrium gene sequence alignments constructed as part of this study. These data were used to identify a suite of species-specific Alexandrium assays that can be recommended for evaluation by the global harmful algal bloom community.","Vandersea, Mark W; Kibler, Steven R; Van Sant, Scott B; Tester, Patricia A; Sullivan, Kate; Eckert, Ginny; Cammarata, Charlayna; Reece, Kim; Scott, Gail; Place, Allen; Holderied, Kris; Hondolero, Dominic; Litaker, R Wayne",Phycologia,,360

446494,Macroeconomic aspects of the development of the transport industry under the influence of COVID-19,2020,"Long endemicity of the Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) H5N1 subtype in Egypt poses a lot of threats to public health. Contrary to what is previously known, outbreaks have been circulated continuously in the poultry sectors all year round without seasonality. These changes call the need for epidemiological studies to prove or deny the influence of climate variability on outbreak occurrence, which is the aim of this study. This work proposes a modern approach to examine the degree to which the HPAI-H5N1disease event is being influenced by climate variability as a potential risk factor using generalized estimating equations (GEEs). GEE model revealed that the effect of climate variability differs according to the timing of the outbreak occurrence. Temperature and relative humidity could have both positive and negative effects on disease events. During the cold seasons especially in the first quarter, higher minimum temperatures, consistently show higher risks of disease occurrence, because this condition stimulates viral activity, while lower minimum temperatures support virus survival in the other quarters of the year with the highest negative effect in the third quarter. On the other hand, relative humidity negatively affects the outbreak in the first quarter of the year as the humid weather does not support viral circulation, while the highest positive effect was found in the second quarter during which low humidity favors the disease event.","Elsobky, Yumna; El Afandi, Gamal; Abdalla, Ehsan; Byomi, Ahmed; Reddy, Gopal",PLoS One,,360

Design Retrospective observation was applied in this study. Methods 137 patients wearing no medical masks (Group A, aged from 20 to 87) and 136 patients wearing medical masks (Group B, aged from 18 to 91) were selected in this retrospective study after extubation in PACU. After that, their pulse oxygen saturation, noninvasive mean blood pressure and heart rate were recorded at two different time points (treated with 40% O2 oxygen therapy for 10 min and breathing room air for 10 min). The comfort, arterial blood gas data, complications and duration of patients were also reviewed in PACU. Findings There were no significant differences in the pulse oxygen saturation between the two groups after inhaling 40% O2 or air. Compared with Group A, patients in Group B have lower comfort (6[4-7] vs. 7[6-8]) (P&lt;0.001), with shortened duration after extubation in PACU (50[45-55] vs. 56[48-60]) (P&lt;0.001). No significant differences were found in heart rate, noninvasive mean blood pressure, arterial blood gas data and complications. And no hypoxaemia and respiratory adverse events happened in two groups. Conclusions Wearing medical masks cannot reduce oxygen saturation in adult surgical patients during recovery from general anesthesia. The discomfort caused by masks should be concerned in PACU.","Lv, Feng Xiong Qiuju Min Su Chen Jing Ren Li Zhu Zunyan Shen Yiwei Huang Fusen Hu Jun Li Jing",Journal of PeriAnesthesia Nursing,,360
448271,At the Boundary: Post-COVID Agenda for Business and Management Research in Europe and Beyond,2021,"The effects of vitamin D on the musculoskeletal system are well established. Its deficiency causes osteomalacia, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and an increased risk for fractures and falls. However, clinical and experimental evidence points to extra-skeletal actions of vitamin D, including on immune and respiratory systems. Thus, during this COVID-19 pandemic, a possible deleterious role of vitamin D deficiency has been questioned. This paper aims to present a brief review of the literature and discuss, based on evidence, the role of vitamin D in the lung function and in the prevention of respiratory infections. Relevant articles were searched in the databases MEDLINE/PubMed and SciELO/LILACS. The mechanisms of vitamin D action in the immune system response will be discussed. Clinical data from systematic reviews and meta-analyses show benefits in the prevention of respiratory infections and improvement of pulmonary function when vitamin D-deficient patients are supplemented. At the time of writing this paper, no published data on vitamin D supplementation for patients with COVID-19 have been found. Vitamin D supplementation is recommended during this period of social isolation to avoid any deficiency, especially in the context of bone outcomes, aiming to achieve normal values of 25(OH)D. The prevention of respiratory infections and improvement of pulmonary function are additional benefits observed when vitamin D deficiency is treated. Thus far, any protective effect of vitamin D specifically against severe COVID-19 remains unclear. We also emphasize avoiding bolus or extremely high doses of vitamin D, which can increase the risk of intoxication without evidence of benefits.","Santos, Rodrigo Nolasco Dos; Maeda, Sergio Setsuo; Jardim, José Roberto; Lazaretti-Castro, Marise",Arch. endocrinol. metab.

A Mathematical Modeling Approach,2020-08-10,"Importance: The American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) indicated that urgent or emergent vitreoretinal surgical procedures should continue during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Although decreases in the frequency of critical procedures have been reported outside the field of ophthalmology, analyses are limited by volume, geography, and time. Objective: To evaluate whether the frequency of ophthalmic surgical procedures deemed urgent or emergent by the AAO changed across the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design, Setting, and Participants: Vitreoretinal practices from 17 institutions throughout the US participated in this multicenter cross-sectional study. The frequency of 11 billed vitreoretinal Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes across respective weeks was obtained from each practice between January 1, 2019, and May 31, 2020. Data were clustered into intravitreal injections (code 67028), lasers and cryotherapy (codes 67141, 67145, and 67228), retinal detachment (RD) repairs (codes 67107, 67108, 67110, and 67113), and other vitrectomies (codes 67036, 67039, and 67040). Institutions were categorized by region (Northeast, Midwest, South, and West Coast), practice setting (academic [tax-exempt] or private [non-tax-exempt]), and date of respective statewide stay-at-home orders. Main Outcomes and Measures: Nationwide changes in the frequency of billing for urgent or emergent vitreoretinal surgical procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: A total of 526â¯536 CPT codes were ascertained: 483â¯313 injections, 19â¯257 lasers or cryotherapy, 14â¯949 RD repairs, and 9017 other vitrectomies. Relative to 2019, a weekly institutional decrease in injections was observed from March 30 to May 2, 2020, with a maximal 38.6% decrease (from a mean [SD] of 437.8 [436.3] to 273.8 [269.0] injections) from April 6 to 12, 2020 (95% CI, -259 to -69 injections; P = .002). A weekly decrease was also identified that spanned a longer interval, at least until study conclusion (March 16 to May 31, 2020), for lasers and cryotherapy, with a maximal 79.6% decrease (from a mean [SD] of 6.6 [7.7] to 1.5 [2.0] procedures) from April 6 to 12, 2020 (95% CI, -6.8 to -3.3 procedures; P < .001), for RD repairs, with a maximal 59.4% decrease (from a mean [SD] of 3.5 [4.0] to 1.6 [2.2] repairs) from April 13 to 19, 2020 (95% CI, -2.7 to -1.4 repairs; P < .001), and for other vitrectomies, with a maximal 84.3% decrease (from a mean [SD] of 3.0 [3.1] to 0.4 [0.8] other vitrectomies) from April 6 to 12, 2020 (95% CI, -3.3 to -1.8 other vitrectomies; P < .001). No differences were identified by region, setting, or state-level stay-at-home order adjustment. Conclusions and Relevance: Although the AAO endorsed the continued performance of urgent or emergent vitreoretinal surgical procedures, the frequency of such procedures throughout the country experienced a substantial decrease that may persist after the COVID-19 pandemic's initial exponential growth phase. This decrease appears independent of region, setting, and state-level stay-at-home orders. It is unknown to what extent vitreoretinal intervention would have decreased without AAO recommendations, and how the decrease is associated with outcomes. Although safety is paramount during the COVID-19 pandemic, practices should consider prioritizing availability for managing high-acuity conditions until underlying reasons for the reduction are fully appreciated.","Breazzano, Mark P; Nair, Archana A; Arevalo, J Fernando; Barakat, Mark R; Berrocal, Audina M; Chang, Jonathan S; Chen, Andrew; Eliott, Dean; Garg, Sunir J; Ghadiali, Quraish; Gong, Dan; Grewal, Dilraj S; Handa, James T; Henderson, Matthew; Leiderman, Yannek I; Leng, Theodore; Mannina, Amar; Mendel, Thomas A; Mustafi, Debarshi; de Koo, Lisa C Olmos; Patel, Shriji N; Patel, Tapan P; Prenner, Jonathan; Richards, Paige; Singh, Rishi P; Wykoff, Charles C; Yannuzzi, Nicolas A; Yu, Hannah; Modi, Yasha S; Chang, Stanley",JAMA Ophthalmol,,360

450515,Smart Simon Bot with Public Sentiment Analysis for Novel Covid-19 Tweets Stratification,2021,"BACKGROUND: There is a lot of debate about the effects of smoking on COVID-19. A recent fixed-effects meta-analysis found smoking to be associated with disease severity among hospitalized patients, but other studies report an unusually low prevalence of smoking among hospitalized patients. The purpose of this study was to expand the analysis by calculating the prevalence odds ratio (POR) of smoking among hospitalized COVID-19 patients, while the association between smoking and disease severity and mortality was examined by random-effects meta-analyses considering the highly heterogeneous study populations. METHODS: The same studies as examined in the previous meta-analysis were analyzed (N = 22, 20 studies from China and 2 from USA). The POR relative to the expected smoking prevalence was calculated using gender and age-adjusted population smoking rates. Random-effects meta-analyses were used for all other associations. RESULTS: A total of 7162 patients were included, with 482 being smokers. The POR was 0.24 (95%CI 0.19-0.30). Unlike the original study, the association between smoking and disease severity was not statistically significant using random-effects meta-analysis (OR 1.40, 95%CI 0.98-1.98). In agreement with the original study, no statistically significant association was found between smoking and mortality (OR 1.86, 95%CI 0.88-3.94). CONCLUSION: An unusually low prevalence of smoking, approximately 1/4th the expected prevalence, was observed among hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

In response to operating room resource constraints imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, our orthopaedic service rapidly adopted and expanded its use of WALANT. METHODS: A retrospective review of 16 consecutive cases performed by 7 surgeons was conducted. Patient demographics, surgical details, and perioperative outcomes were assessed. The primary end point was WALANT failure, defined as intraoperative conversion to general anesthesia. RESULTS: No instances of WALANT failure requiring conversion to general anesthesia occurred. In recovery, one patient (6%) required narcotics for pain control, and the average postoperative pain numeric rating scale was 0.6. The maximum pain score experienced was 4 in the patient requiring postoperative narcotics. The average time in recovery was 42 minutes and ranged from 8 to 118 minutes. CONCLUSION: The WALANT technique was safely and effectively used in 16 cases across multiple orthopaedic subspecialties, including three procedures not previously described in the literature. WALANT techniques hold promise for use in future disaster scenarios and should be evaluated for potential incorporation into routine orthopaedic surgical care.","Turcotte, Justin J; Petre, Benjamin M; Jones, Christopher M; Gelfand, Jeffrey M",J Am Acad Orthop Surg Glob Res Rev,,360

As a collateral effect, these changes have exacerbated the circulation of viruses and challenged our ability to prevent, control, and/or eliminate impactful swine diseases. Recent pandemic events in human and animal health, e.g., SARS-CoV-2 and African swine fever virus, highlight the fact that clinical observations are too slow and inaccurate to form the basis for effective health management decisions: systematic processes that provide timely, reliable data are required. Oral fluid-based surveillance reflects the adaptation of conventional testing methods to an alternative diagnostic specimen. The routine use of oral fluids in commercial farms for PRRSV and PCV2 surveillance was first proposed in 2008 as an efficient and practical improvement on individual pig sampling. Subsequent research expanded on this initial report to include the detection of &#8805;23 swine viral pathogens and the implementation of oral fluid-based surveillance in large swine populations (> 12,000 pigs). Herein we compile the current information regarding oral fluid collection methods, testing, and surveillance applications in swine production.","Henao-Diaz, Alexandra; Giménez-Lirola, Luis; Baum, David H; Zimmerman, Jeffrey",Porcine Health Manag,,360

The relationship is weaker among states with high levels of medical resources and states that are likely to get support from the federal government. In addition, we find that the negative effect is reduced for firms that report an expectation that an outbreak will increase revenues and for firms with a strong corporate social responsibility practice.

Based onclinical manifestations, blood routine, inflammatory factors, cell immunity, chest CT andtherapeutic effects, the diagnosis and treatment of NCP in kidney transplant recipients (5th edition) were compared to that ofordinary NCP patients. Both recipients developed onset of low andmoderate fever, with no cough or fatigue at the initial stage. Blood routine indicated a normal range of leukocytes,buta significant decrease in lymphocyte counts, increased C-reactive protein (CRP) , and slightly higher procalcitonin (PCT) . The cellular immunity was extremely low, and the chest CT showed multiple patchy ground glass shadows in both lungs.@*Result@#After 1 week of onset, both patients had significant disease progression. The pathogenesis and imaging changes were highly similar tothatreported in ordinary NCP patients.Two patients were givensymptomatic supportive treatment by antiviral agents, stop uses ofimmunosuppression agents, small amount of hormone maintenance, intravenous drip of gamma globulin andrespiratory support toavoid secondary infections. At present, the condition of both patients is obviously improved, and renal function is stable. One of them has recovered and was discharged.@*Conclusion@#The clinical manifestations of NCP in renal transplant recipients were generally consistent with that of ordinary NCP patients. Although there is no established method for the treatment of NCP, it is effective by stopping uses of immunosuppressive agents, maintaining small and medium doses of hormones, actively restoring immunity, and providing respiratory support in a timely manner.","Yafang, TU; Xiongfei, WU; LIU, Feng; WANG, Juan; LUO, Yu; CAI, Zhitao; CHEN, Rengui; LIAO, Wenliang; LIU, Na; HUANG, Jin",Chinese Journal of Organ Transplantation,,360

In this study, experimental evidence for the emission and transmission of Pseunomonas. amygdali pv. lachrymans (Pal) aerosol was provided, and the results supported that diseased cucumber plants served as the main source of Pal aerosol. Bacterial aerosols released by infected plants played a significant role in the epidemiology of cucumber angular leaf spot (ALS) disease. Aerosol chambers were constructed to study the characteristics of Pal aerosols released by artificially infested cucumber plants. The particle size of Pal aerosol was predominately distributed from 1.1 to 4.7 µm, accounting for 72.16% of the total amount of Pal aerosol. The infection threshold of aerosolized Pal to cause ALS disease was 84-179 CFU/m3. In addition, the transmission dynamics of Pal aerosols from donor cucumber plants to recipient cucumber plants were also confirmed in exposure chambers and greenhouses. The results from the present study verified the hypothesis that aerosol dissemination is a potential route for the epidemiology of plant bacterial disease, and these data will contribute to the development of new strategies for the effective alleviation and control of plant bacterial diseases.","Chai, Ali; Yuan, Lifang; Li, Lei; Shi, Yanxia; Xie, Xuewen; Wang, Qi; Li, Baoju",Sci Total Environ,,360
457786,National Security in the Post-Pandemic Era,2020,"Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it is very likely that many radiology residency and fellowship programs will adopt interactive videoconference interviewing for the 2020-2021 residency match cycle. Although video interviewing has become a common part of the hiring process for business, experience with video interviewing for resident and fellow selection has been limited. Advantages of video interviews over traditional on-site interviews include cost-savings to both applicants and residency programs, less disruption to an applicant's educational activities, and potential for training programs to access a wider pool of candidates. The loss of the casual interactions that occur during an on-site interview and the inability of candidates to evaluate training facilities and their surrounding environments in-person are among the obstacles posed by video interviews, but training programs can mitigate these challenges with enhanced website content and creative media solutions. Through a review of the existing literature and internet resources, this article recommends specific measures medical schools, applicants, and radiology residency and fellowship programs can take to optimize the virtual interview experience for all involved parties.","Joshi, Aparna; Bloom, David A; Spencer, Amy; Gaetke-Udager, Kara; Cohan, Richard H",Acad Radiol,,360
457914,"On the Application of Advanced Machine Learning Methods to Analyze Enhanced, Multimodal Data from Persons Infected with COVID-19",2021,"ABSTRACT: The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted teaching in a variety of institutions, especially in medical schools. Electronic learning (e-learning) became the core method of teaching the curriculum during the pandemic. After 8 weeks of only online learning, a survey was conducted to investigate perception of this type of learning among medical students.A survey was conducted by distributing an online questionnaire to Polish medical students. Data gathered from the survey were analyzed with routine statistical software.Eight hundred four students answered the questionnaire. According to respondents' answers, the main advantages of online learning were the ability to stay at home (69%), continuous access to online materials (69%), learning at your own pace (64%), and comfortable surroundings (54%). The majority of respondents chose lack of interactions with patients (70%) and technical problems with IT equipment (54%) as the main disadvantages. There was no statistical difference between face-to-face and online learning in terms of opinions on the ability of the learning method to increase knowledge (Pâ=â.46). E-learning was considered less effective than face-to-face learning in terms of increasing skills (Pâ<â.001) and social competences (Pâ<â.001). Students assessed that they were less active during online classes compared to traditional classes (Pâ<â.001). E-learning was rated as enjoyable by 73% of respondents.E-learning is a powerful tool for teaching medical students. However, successful implementation of online learning into the curriculum requires a well thought-out strategy and a more active approach.","Baczek, Michal; Zaganczyk-Baczek, Michalina; Szpringer, Monika; Jaroszynski, Andrzej; Wozakowska-Kaplon, Beata",Medicine (Baltimore),,360

Patients participated in the prospective, multicenter EuroNet-PHL-C1 study. Residual uptake was measured retrospectively using the qPET method, a validated semiautomatic quantitative extension of the Deauville score. Empirical cumulative distribution functions (ECDF) of the qPET values were used to systematically analyze the response to first-line and second-line treatment. Results and Conclusion: Individual patients responded variably to first-line and second line treatment. However, the ECDF of the qPET values from all patients were nearly superimposable.

It is caused by SARS-CoV-2 and the transmission is through the respiratory tract. Those infected may be asymptomatic, present typical symptoms (fever, dry cough and dyspnea), gastrointestinal symptoms (diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain) and viral RNA in stools. The objective of this work was to review the literature related to the prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms, and to check the possibility of fecal-oral transmission. We searched PubMed® database on COVID-19 and gastrointestinal tract and selected articles using the PRISMA method. We eliminated articles based on titles and abstracts, small number of patients and the mechanism of infection, leaving 14 studies. Comorbidities and laboratory alterations (elevation of hepatic aminotransferases and bilirubin) were related to worsening of the disease. The prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms ranged from 6.8% to 61.3%, including diarrhea (8.14% to 33.7%), nausea/vomiting (1.53% to 26.4%), anorexia (12.1% to 40.0%) and abdominal pain (0% to 14.5%). The presence of viral RNA in stools was rarely tested, but positive in 0% to 48.1%. The gastrointestinal tract is affected by COVID-19, causing specific symptoms, laboratory alterations and viral presence in the feces. However, the results of prevalence and possibility of fecal-oral transmission were varied, requiring further studies for more assertive conclusions. It is important that healthcare professionals draw attention to this fact, since these changes can help make diagnosis and initiate early treatment.","Almeida, Joana Ferro Machado de; Chehter, Ethel Zimberg",Einstein (Säo Paulo),,360

Due to the initial limited availability of COVID-19 vaccines in the United States, all states have developed allocation plans that outline a phased distribution. This study uses document analysis to compare the relative prioritization of incarcerated people, correctional staff, and other groups at increased risk of COVID-19 infection and morbidity. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a document analysis of the vaccine dissemination plans of all 50 US states and the District of Columbia using a triple-coding method. Documents included state COVID-19 vaccination plans and supplemental materials on vaccine prioritization from state health department websites as of December 31, 2020. We found that 22% of states prioritized incarcerated people in Phase 1, 29% of states in Phase 2, and 2% in Phase 3, while 47% of states did not explicitly specify in which phase people who are incarcerated will be eligible for vaccination. Incarcerated people were consistently not prioritized in Phase 1, while other vulnerable groups who shared similar environmental risk received this early prioritization. States' plans prioritized in Phase 1: prison and jail workers (49%), law enforcement (63%), seniors (65+ years, 59%), and long-term care facility residents (100%). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that states' COVID-19 vaccine allocation plans do not prioritize incarcerated people and provide little to no guidance on vaccination protocols if they fall under other high-risk categories that receive earlier priority.

Here we present the results of the initial analysis in the first 5,233 participants of the BRACOVID study. We have conducted a GWAS for Covid-19 hospitalization enrolling 3533 cases (hospitalized Covid-19 participants) and 1700 controls (non-hospitalized Covid-19 participants). Models were adjusted by age, sex and the 4 first principal components. A meta-analysis was also conducted merging BRACOVID hospitalization data with the Human Genetic Initiative (HGI) Consortia results. BRACOVID results validated most loci previously identified in the HGI meta-analysis. In addition, no significant heterogeneity according to ancestral group within the Brazilian population was observed for the two most important Covid-19 severity associated loci: 3p21.31 and Chr21 near IFNAR2. Using only data provided by BRACOVID a new genome-wide significant locus was identified on Chr1 near the genes DSTYK and RBBP5. The associated haplotype has also been previously associated with a number of blood cell related traits and might play a role in modulating the immune response in Covid-19 cases.","Pereira, Alexandre; Bes, Taniela M; Velho, Mariliza; Marques, Emanuelle; Jannes, Cinthia; Valino, Karina Ramos; Dinardo, Carla M; Costa, Silvia F; Duarte, Alberto J; Santos, Alexandre R; Mitne-Neto, Miguel; Pestana, Jose M; Krieger, Jose E",,,360

STUDY DESIGN: Correlation analysis between healthcare system indicators and COVID-19 mortality rate in Europe. METHODS: For each country in the European Union (EU), the date of the first diagnosed case and the crude death rate for COVID-19 were retrieved from the John Hopkins University website. These data were then combined with environmental, hospital and clinical indicators extracted from the European Health Information Gateway of the World Health Organization. RESULTS: The COVID-19 death rate in EU countries (mean 1.9 ± 0.8%) was inversely associated with the number of available general hospitals, physicians and nurses. Significant positive associations were also found with the rate of acute care bed occupancy, as well as with the proportion of population who were aged older than 65 years, overweight or who had cancer. Total healthcare expenditure, public sector health expenditure and the number of hospital and acute care beds did not influence COVID-19 death rate. CONCLUSIONS: Some common healthcare system inadequacies, such as limited numbers of general hospitals, physicians and nurses, in addition to high acute care bed occupancy, may be significant drivers of nationwide COVID-19 mortality rates in EU countries.","Mattiuzzi, C; Lippi, G; Henry, B M",Public Health,,360

AIM: This study investigated operating room nurses' anxiety levels and related factors during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The research was conducted between July and September 2020. The sample consisted of 192 operating room nurses. Data were collected using a descriptive questionnaire and the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). RESULTS: Participants had moderate levels of anxiety. The risk factors associated with high levels of anxiety included having chronic diseases, working with patients causing worry, fear of contracting COVID-19 and transmitting it to loved ones, incompetence of hospitals in managing the pandemic, lack of support from hospital managers, taking few breaks and working long shifts due to preventive measures at the workplace. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS OF NURSING MANAGEMENT: The results show that operating room nurses have had moderate anxiety levels since the onset of the pandemic. Therefore, it is critical to regularly identify and meet their mental and emotional needs to implement early preventive interventions. Identifying risk factors will help recognize anxiety in operating room nurses and take measures to protect their mental health while working with high-risk patients in different clinics during the pandemic. What is more, managers should draw up action plans for extraordinary conditions, such as a pandemic.","Gül, Senay; Kiliç, Sevcan Toptas",J. nurs. manag,,360

469548,Asian Americans as racial contagion,2021,"There is a dose effect in the infection process, that is, different initial virus invasion loads will lead to nonlinear changes in infection probability. Experiments already proved that there was a sigmoid functional relationship between virus infection probability and inoculum dose. By means of mathematical simulation of stochastic process, we theoretically demonstrate that there is a sigmoid function relationship between them. At the same time, our model found three factors that influence the severity of infection symptoms, those are virus toxicity, virus invasion dose and host immunity respectively. Therefore, the mortality rate cannot directly reflect the change of virus toxicity, but is the result of the comprehensive action of these three factors. Protective measures such as masks can effectively reduce the severity of infection while reducing the probability of infection. Based on the sigmoid function relationship between virus infection probability and initial virus invasion dose, we deduce that for highly infectious viruses, such as SARS-COV-2, the evolution of its toxicity is closely related to the host population density, and its toxicity will first increase and then decrease with the increase of host population density. That is to say, on the basis of extremely low host population density, increasing population density is beneficial to the development of virus towards strong toxicity. However, this trend is not sustainable, and there is a turning point of population density. Beyond this turning point, increasing population density will be beneficial to the development of virus towards weak toxicity. This theory can well explain the differences of mortality in Covid-19 in different countries. Countries with high population density and extremely low population density often correspond to lower mortality, while countries with population density in the range of 20-100/km2 often have higher mortality. At the same time, we propose that social distance and masks can effectively accelerate the evolution of virus towards low toxicity, so we should not give up simple and effective protection measures while emphasizing vaccination. HighlightsThrough mathematical simulation of random process, we prove the sigmoid function relationship between virus infection probability and initial virus invasion dose theoretically. Our model found three factors that influence the severity of infection symptoms: virus toxicity, virus invasion dose and host immunity. This can help explain why the average infection age was declining as the epidemic went through. With the increase of host population density, virus toxicity will increase at first and then decrease, which will explain the difference of mortality in different population density areas. From the mathematical level, social distance, masks and other protective measures were proved to be positive in promoting the virus evolving into the less toxicity one. Vaccination could also promote virus virulence attenuation.","Xu, Zhaobin; Zhang, Hongmei",,,360

Case study of 2019 Polish parliamentary election,2020-10-07,"The Gammacoronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a highly contagious economically important respiratory pathogen of domestic fowl. Reverse genetics allows for the molecular study of pathogenic determinants to enable rational vaccine design. The recombinant IBV (rIBV) Beau-R, a molecular clone of the apathogenic Beaudette strain, has previously been investigated as a vaccine platform. To determine tissues in which Beau-R could effectively deliver antigenic genes, an in vivo study in chickens, the natural host, was used to compare the pattern of viral dissemination of Beau-R to the pathogenic strain M41-CK. Replication of Beau-R was found to be restricted to soft tissue within the beak, whereas M41-CK was detected in beak tissue, trachea and eyelid up to seven days post infection. In vitro assays further identified that, unlike M41-CK, Beau-R could not replicate at 41 °C, the core body temperature of a chicken, but is able to replicate a 37 °C, a temperature relatable to the very upper respiratory tract. Using a panel of rIBVs with defined mutations in the structural and accessory genes, viral replication at permissive and non-permissive temperatures was investigated, identifying that the Beau-R replicase gene was a determinant of temperature sensitivity and that sub-genomic mRNA synthesis had been affected. The identification of temperature sensitive allelic lesions within the Beau-R replicase gene opens up the possibility of using this method of attenuation in other IBV strains for future vaccine development as well as a method to investigate the functions of the IBV replicase proteins.","Keep, Sarah; Stevenson-Leggett, Phoebe; Steyn, Angela; Oade, Michael S; Webb, Isobel; Stuart, Jamie; Vervelde, Lonneke; Britton, Paul; Maier, Helena J; Bickerton, Erica",Viruses,,360

Such measures are meant to increase the domestic availability of critical goods, and are commonly used in times of crisis. Yet, not much is known about their impact, especially on countries imposing them. Here we show that export bans are, by and large, counterproductive. Using a model of shock diffusion through the network of international trade, we simulate the impact of restrictions under different scenarios. We observe that while they would be beneficial to a country implementing them in isolation, their generalized use makes most countries worse off relative to a no-ban scenario. As a corollary, we estimate that prices increase in many countries imposing the restrictions. We also find that the cost of restraining from export bans is small, even when others continue to implement them. Finally, we document a change in countries' position within the international trade network, suggesting that export bans have geopolitical implications.","Grassia, Marco; Mangioni, Giuseppe; Schiavo, Stefano; Traverso, Silvio",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.11941v1.pdf,360
474358,The Coronavirus Pandemic: an Explosive Global Catastrophe,2020,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that is responsible for the global corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic enters host cells via a mechanism that includes binding to angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) 2 (ACE2). Membrane-bound ACE2 is depleted as a result of this entry mechanism. The consequence is that the protective renin-angiotensin system (RAS), of which ACE2 is an essential component, is compromised through lack of production of the protective peptides angiotensin-(1-7) and angiotensin-(1-9), and therefore decreased stimulation of Mas (receptor Mas) and angiotensin AT2-receptors (AT2Rs), while angiotensin AT1-receptors (AT1Rs) are overstimulated due to less degradation of angiotensin II (Ang II) by ACE2. The protective RAS has numerous beneficial actions, including anti-inflammatory, anti-coagulative, anti-fibrotic effects along with endothelial and neural protection; opposite to the deleterious effects caused by heightened stimulation of angiotensin AT1R. Given that patients with severe COVID-19 exhibit an excessive immune response, endothelial dysfunction, increased clotting, thromboses and stroke, enhancing the activity of the protective RAS is likely beneficial. In this article, we discuss the evidence for a dysfunctional protective RAS in COVID and develop a rationale that the protective RAS imbalance in COVID-19 may be corrected by using AT2R agonists. We further review preclinical studies with AT2R agonists which suggest that AT2R stimulation may be therapeutically effective to treat COVID-19-induced disorders of various organ systems such as lung, vasculature, or the brain. Finally, we provide information on the design of a clinical trial in which patients with COVID-19 were treated with the AT2R agonist Compound 21 (C21). This trial has been completed, but results have not yet been reported.","Steckelings, U Muscha; Sumners, Colin",Clin Sci (Lond),,360

475463,Continuous Intelligent Pandemic Monitoring (CIPM),2021,"Paraviral eruptions, such as the papular-purpuric gloves and socks syndrome or eruptive pseudoangiomatosis, share the following features that distinguish them from a classic viral eruption: they are highly recognizable; the eruption usually lasts a few weeks; many different viruses and sometimes other agents can trigger them; on microscopic examination, there is no specific cytopathogenic viral effect. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can induce both a classic viral eruption and a paraviral eruption, the meaning of which in terms of pathophysiology and prognosis is very different. Some patients infected with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have a papulovesicular eruption involving mainly the trunk. Those patients have active viremia, and some have developed pneumonia and died. Biopsy of the eruption revealed cytopathogenic viral effect, and thus there is a direct interaction of the virus with the skin; it is, therefore, a classic viral exanthema. Others, mainly young patients, developed chilblains of the fingers and toes 3 or 4 weeks after minor signs of COVID-19 or after contact with a diseased person. They did not develop severe COVID-19. Biopsy revealed classic findings of chilblains without cytopathogenic viral effect. Most of those patients did not develop specific antibodies. Those chilblains can be considered as paraviral. Classic viral manifestations are the consequence of a direct interaction of the skin with the virus, whereas paraviral manifestations result from the activation of the immune system. In the case of paraviral chilblains, I hypothesize that it is the innate immune system that rejects SARS-CoV-2. Chilblains are also observed in rare monogenic disorders called type 1 interferonopathies, where antiviral innate imunity is abormally activated. This would explain why these individuals do not develop specific antibodies, because they are probably naturally resistant to SARS-CoV-2 infection via their innate immuen system.","Lipsker, Dan",Clin.

In this context, the so-called hyperinflammation syndrome characterized by a cytokine storm accompanied by a massive increase in inflammatory markers such as interleukin(IL)-6, represents such a situation. This case report describes the therapeutic approach of using the IL-6-specific antibody tocilizumab in combination with hemoadsorption therapy (CytoSorb) in a 58-year-old male patient with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. The patient suffered a massive clinical deterioration with concomitant Horovitz index of 127âmmHg that occurred on the 6th day of ventilation. After combined application of the above-mentioned therapeutic approaches, the patient stabilized rapidly paralleled by a significant increase in the Horovitz index, and the possibility of de-escalating the ventilation regimen, which ultimately enabled successful extubation after only 13 days of ventilation. Moreover, the combined treatment was associated with significant hemodynamic stabilization and a consecutive reduction in vasopressor doses, while hyperinflammation could be kept well under control. The incorporation of the hemoadsorber into the therapeutic regimen proved to be safe and straightforward. In conclusion, the combination of CytoSorb therapy and IL-6 blockade by tocilizumab appeared, at least in this case, to be an effective measure to modulate an overshooting immune response in COVID-19 pneumonia with a concomitant clinical improvement in both respiratory and hemodynamic function, and thus could be used as a potential therapeutic option in this clinical picture.","Kornitzky, F W; Langen, H-J; Held, M",Pneumologie (Stuttg.),,360

In the United Kingdom, one service that has benefitted from this response is the provision of early medical abortion. England, Wales, and Scotland have all issued approval orders to this effect. These orders allow women to terminate pregnancies up to certain gestational limits, removing the need for them to contravene social distancing measures to access care. However, they are intended only as temporary measures for the duration of the pandemic response. In this paper, we chart these developments and further demonstrate the already acknowledged politicisation of abortion care. We focus on two key elements of the orders: (1) the addition of updated clinical guidance in the Scottish order that suggests an extended gestational limit, and (2) sunset clauses in the English and Welsh orders, as well as an indication of similar intentions in Scotland. In discussing these two issues, we suggest that the refusal of UK governments to introduce telemedical provision of early medical abortion previously has not been based on health concerns. Further, we question whether it would be appropriate for the approval orders to be lifted following the pandemic, suggesting that to do so would represent regressive and harmful policy.","Parsons, Jordan A; Romanis, Elizabeth Chloe",Health policy,,360

478860,Understanding Relations Between Perception of Fairness and Trust in Algorithmic Decision Making,2021-09-29,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic is a global health crisis, yet certain countries have had far more success in limiting COVID-19 cases and deaths. We suggest that collective threats require a tremendous amount of coordination, and that strict adherence to social norms is a key mechanism that enables groups to do so. Here we examine how the strength of social norms-or cultural tightness-looseness-was associated with countries' success in limiting cases and deaths by October, 2020. We expected that tight cultures, which have strict norms and punishments for deviance, would have fewer cases and deaths per million as compared with loose cultures, which have weaker norms and are more permissive. METHODS: We estimated the relationship between cultural tightness-looseness and COVID-19 case and mortality rates as of Oct 16, 2020, using ordinary least squares regression. We fit a series of stepwise models to capture whether cultural tightness-looseness explained variation in case and death rates controlling for under-reporting, demographics, geopolitical factors, other cultural dimensions, and climate. FINDINGS: The results indicated that, compared with nations with high levels of cultural tightness, nations with high levels of cultural looseness are estimated to have had 4·99 times the number of cases (7132 per million vs 1428 per million, respectively) and 8·71 times the number of deaths (183 per million vs 21 per million, respectively), taking into account a number of controls. A formal evolutionary game theoretic model suggested that tight groups cooperate much faster under threat and have higher survival rates than loose groups. The results suggest that tightening social norms might confer an evolutionary advantage in times of collective threat. INTERPRETATION: Nations that are tight and abide by strict norms have had more success than those that are looser as of the October, 2020. New interventions are needed to help countries tighten social norms as they continue to battle COVID-19 and other collective threats.

As a model system, we used the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein (48 kDa) due to its stability and important role in therapeutic development. Cryo-EM structures of the N protein monomer revealed a flexible N-terminal ""top hat"" motif and a helical-rich C-terminal domain. To complement our structural findings, we engineered microchip-based immunoprecipitation assays that led to the discovery of the first antibody binding site on the N protein. The data also facilitated molecular modeling of a variety of pandemic and common cold-related coronavirus proteins. Such insights may guide future pandemic-preparedness protocols through immuno-engineering strategies to mitigate viral outbreaks.","Casasanta, Michael A; Jonaid, G M; Kaylor, Liam; Luqiu, William Y; Solares, Maria J; Schroen, Mariah L; Dearnaley, William J; Wilson, Jarad; Dukes, Madeline J; Kelly, Deborah F",Nanoscale,,360
479346,The COVID-19 storm and the energy sector: The impact and role of uncertainty,2021,"One notable feature of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 has a polybasic furin cleavage site (FCS) at its S1-S2 boundary through the insertion of 12 nucleotides encoding four amino acid residues PRRA. Quite intriguingly, this polybasic FCS is absent in coronaviruses of the same clade as SARS-CoV-2. Thus, with currently available experimental structural data for S protein, this short article presents a set of comprehensive structural characterization of the insertion of FCS into S protein, and argues against a hypothesis of the origin of SARS-CoV-2 from purposeful manipulation: (1), the inserted FCS is spatially located at a random coil loop region, mostly distantly solvent-exposed (instead of deeply buried), with no structural proximity to the other part of the S protein; (2), the insertion of FCS itself does not alter, neither stabilize nor de-stabilize, the three-dimensional structure of S; (3), the net result here is the insertion of a furin cleavage site into S protein, whose S1 and S2 subunits will still be strongly electrostatically bonded together from a structural and biophysical point of view, even if the polybasic FCS is actually cleaved by furin protease before or after viral cell entry.","Li, Wei",Biophys Chem,,360

RECENT FINDINGS: The rate of good treatment adherence in PsA can be as low as 57.7% and successful patient education can help improve treatment adherence. Also, 78.7% of patients who stopped their disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic did so without the advice of their clinician. In delivering educational needs, the aspects of disease process, treatment, self-help measures, managing pain, movement, psychological and social needs should all be addressed, whilst at the same time, recognising that PsA patients with multidomain disease, are likely to be dealing with more than just pain. Arthritis self-care management education is potentially beneficial, but up to 11% of educational YouTube videos may contain misleading patient opinion and many existing apps do not meet the needs of the patients with PsA. SUMMARY: Significant room for improvement exists in treatment adherence in PsA and patient education addressing the relevant educational needs could assist with this issue.

Many academic healthcare research activities involve human subjects as research participants; but because of the lockdown, final year post-graduate students may not be able to complete their research projects within the stipulated time frame. Healthcare students are in a vulnerable situation because of the pressure to submit their research projects for the successful completion of the courses.

Pathogens such as viruses are always evolving owing to the processes of antigenic shift and drift. Such viral evolution results in the emergence of new types and serovars that prove deadly for humans-like influenza pandemics, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). The pandemic of novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is the recent example. It has resulted in a great loss of human lives and a serious burden on economy across the globe. To counter such situations, a system should exist for the early detection of emerging viral pathogens. This will help prevent possible outbreaks and save human lives. Most of such deadly novel viruses and viral outbreaks are known to be originated from animal hosts. Regular monitoring of potential hot spots of such emerging microbes, such as zoos and animal markets, through metagenomics could help assess the presence of new viruses and pathogens. In this review, we focus on the potential of viral metagenomics and propose a surveillance system based on it for the early detection and hence prevention of such emerging viral infections.","Mohsin, Hareem; Asif, Azka; Fatima, Minhaj; Rehman, Yasir",Arch. microbiol,,360

To what extent the pre-existing clinical condition and genetic background have implications for COVID-19 still needs to be explored. METHODS: Our study included 389,620 participants of European descent from the UK Biobank, of whom 3,884 received the COVID-19 test and 1,091 were tested positive for COVID-19. We examined the association of COVID-19 status with an extensive list of 974 medical conditions and 30 blood biomarkers. Additionally, we tested the association of genetic variants in two key genes related to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), with COVID-19 or any other phenotypes. RESULTS: The most significant risk factors for COVID-19 include Alzheimer's disease (OR = 2.29, 95% CI: 1.25-4.16), dementia (OR = 2.16, 95% CI: 1.36-3.42), and the overall category of delirium, dementia, amnestic and other cognitive disorders (OR = 1.90, 95% CI: 1.24-2.90).

For this, this research performs an empirical survey of the evolution of three market condition indicators: power demand, day-ahead energy prices, and prices of shares of power companies active in the generation sector. These are analyzed on examples of four European countries that all reacted differently to the spreading epidemic at governmental level: Italy, the United Kingdom, Poland, and Sweden.

Using the example of a clinic for visceral, transplantation, thorax and vascular surgery (VTTG), the performance development of inpatient care in the first 7 weeks in comparison to the previous year as well as an evaluation of the compensation measures laid down by law were evaluated. METHODOLOGY: Based on the performance figures, a comparison was made between the period from 16 March to 3 May 2019 and the same period in 2020. Changes in the number of cases, case mix, case mix index and day mix index as well as the bed occupancy days were recorded. The monetary measures from the COVID-19 Hospital Relief Act were applied to these changes and the adequacy was evaluated. RESULTS: Compared to the previous year there was a decrease in inpatient admissions of 120 patients during the observation period. As a result there was a decrease of 370 points in case mix and 1433 days of occupancy. For the whole VTTG this resulted in a decrease in revenue of approximately 0.8â¯million , which was completely compensated by the flat rate payment for empty beds. The individual areas of the VTTG showed a heterogeneous picture in relation to the compensation for the loss of revenue. Elective units in particular showed a shortfall up to 128,163â¯ with respect to inpatient treatment for 7 weeks. CONCLUSION: The measures taken by the Government are an important support for the economic security of German hospitals. The lack of differentiation of measures by specialty leads to a heterogeneous picture in compensation for VTTG revenues and has to be understood as an alarm signal especially for elective surgical healthcare.","von Dercks, Nikolaus; Seehofer, Daniel; Steinert, Matthias; Krämer, Sebastian; Branzan, Daniela; Dietrich, Arne; Schürmann, Olaf; Gockel, Ines",Chirurg,,360

483444,An international football match experienced from within a 'working quarantine' – a photographic journey,2021,"The rapid early spread of COVID-19 in the US was experienced very differently by different socioeconomic groups and business industries. In this study, we study aggregate mobility patterns of New York City and Chicago to identify the relationship between the amount of interpersonal contact between people in urban neighborhoods and the disparity in the growth of positive cases among these groups. We introduce an aggregate spatiotemporal contact density index (CDI) to measure the strength of this interpersonal contact using mobility data collected from mobile phones, and combine it with social distancing metrics to show its effect on positive case growth. With the help of structural equations modeling, we find that the effect of CDI on case growth was consistently positive and that it remained consistently higher in lower-income neighborhoods, suggesting a causal path of income on case growth via CDI. Using the CDI, schools and restaurants are identified as high contact density industries, and the estimation suggests that implementing specific mobility restrictions on these point-of-interest categories is most effective. This analysis can be useful in providing insights for government officials targeting specific population groups and businesses to reduce infection spread as reopening efforts continue to expand across the nation.","Verma, Rajat; Yabe, Takahiro; Ukkusuri, Satish V",Sci Rep,,360

483761,Pandemic Geography: What Happens Where,2020,"OBJECTIVES: We critically evaluated the quality of evidence and quality of harm reporting in clinical trials that evaluated the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) or chloroquine (CQ) for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Scientific databases were systematically searched to identify relevant trials of HCQ/CQ for the treatment of COVID-19 published up to 10 September 2020. The Cochrane risk-of-bias tools for randomized trials and non-randomized trials of interventions were used to assess risk of bias in the included studies. A 10-item Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) harm extension was used to assess quality of harm reporting in the included trials. RESULTS: Sixteen trials, including fourteen randomized trials and two non-randomized trials, met the inclusion criteria. The results from the included trials were conflicting and lacked effect estimates adjusted for baseline disease severity or comorbidities in many cases, and most of the trials recruited a fairly small cohort of patients. None of the clinical trials met the CONSORT criteria in full for reporting harm data in clinical trials. None of the 16 trials had an overall 'low' risk of bias, while four of the trials had a 'high', 'critical', or 'serious' risk of bias. Biases observed in these trials arise from the randomization process, potential deviation from intended interventions, outcome measurements, selective reporting, confounding, participant selection, and/or classification of interventions. CONCLUSION: In general, the quality of currently available evidence for the effectiveness of CQ/HCQ in patients with COVID-19 is suboptimal. The importance of a properly designed and reported clinical trial cannot be overemphasized amid the COVID-19 pandemic, and its dismissal could lead to poorer clinical and policy decisions, resulting in wastage of already stretched invaluable health care resources.","Mazhar, Faizan; Hadi, Muhammad Abdul; Kow, Chia Siang; Marran, Albaraa Mohammed N; Merchant, Hamid A; Hasan, Syed Shahzad",Int J Infect Dis,,360

With more COVID-19 vaccines expecting approval in the coming months, it is necessary to note that vaccine availability does not equate to vaccine accessibility, nor vaccine efficacy. Some research suggests that approximately 9 out of 10 individuals living in lower-income countries will not have access to COVID-19 vaccines until 2023 or later. For higher-income countries, such as the United States, the prevalence of vaccine hesitancy may further compound the situation. These insights combined, in turn, emphasize the fact that even though COVID-19 vaccines are becoming more available, safety measures (e.g., face masks, personal hygiene, and social distancing) are still of pivotal importance in protecting personal and public health against COVID-19. Furthermore, this paper argues for the continued imperative for health experts and government officials to communicate and emphasize the importance of COVID-19 safety measures with the public, to make sure people are protected against COVID-19 till the pandemic ceases to pose a threat to personal or public health.","Su, Zhaohui; Wen, Jun; McDonnell, Dean; Goh, Edmund; Li, Xiaoshan; Segalo, Sabina; Ahmad, Junaid; Cheshmehzangi, Ali; Xiang, Yu-Tao",Brain Behav Immun Health,,360
484425,Critical Thinking During a Pandemic,2020,"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by a new strain of coronavirus called Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was declared a pandemic by WHO on March 11, 2020. Soon after its emergence in late December 2019, it was noticed that diabetic individuals were at an increased risk of COVID-19-associated complications, ICU admissions, and mortality. Maintaining proper blood glucose levels using insulin and/or other oral antidiabetic drugs (such as Metformin) reduced the detrimental effects of COVID-19. Interestingly, in diabetic COVID-19 patients, while insulin administration was associated with adverse outcomes, Metformin treatment was correlated with a significant reduction in disease severity and mortality rates among affected individuals. Metformin was extensively studied for its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and antiviral capabilities that would explain its ability to confer cardiopulmonary and vascular protection in COVID-19. Here, we describe the various possible molecular mechanisms that contribute to Metformin therapy's beneficial effects and lay out the scientific basis of repurposing Metformin for use in COVID-19 patients.","Varghese, Elizabeth; Samuel, Samson Mathews; Liskova, Alena; Kubatka, Peter; Büsselberg, Dietrich",PLoS Pathog,,360

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, many trainings planned face-to-face were carried out remotely. In this study, our aim is to evaluate students' views on the efficiency of DAE, and to increase the efficiency of DAE in the future. METHODS: The questionnaire used in the study was applied to the first grade students in the Faculty of Medicine, at the Eskisehir Osmangazi University, in 2019-2020. 239 students completed the survey. The questionnaire consisted of the demographic information, that was obtained with voluntary consent, and sections containing suggestions on DAE, and its comparison with distance education of other basic medical science courses. The survey was prepared as a Likert scale (with 1 = totally disagree to 5 = totally agree), on Google forms and sent to the students online. RESULTS: 82.4% of the students marked ""totally disagree"" or ""disagree"" for the statement of ""DAE is more efficient than TAE"". The total percentage of students who marked ""totally disagree"" or ""disagree"" for the statement of ""I was satisfied with the theoretical education in DAE"" was 58.6%, but when it came to practical education the percentage raised to 79.9%. CONCLUSIONS: According to the results the efficiency of DAE, especially in terms of practice lessons, was found to be lower than TAE. To make DAE a powerful alternative to TAE, future studies should aim to develop a new syllabus for DAE.","Ortadeveci, Abdullah; Ermez, Merve Nur; Oz, Semih; Ozden, Hilmi",,,360

However, a thorough investigation of the interplay between infected cells and the immune system at sites of infection has been lacking. Here we use high-parameter imaging mass cytometry9 that targets the expression of 36 proteins to investigate the cellular composition and spatial architecture of acute lung injury in humans (including injuries derived from SARS-CoV-2 infection) at single-cell resolution. These spatially resolved single-cell data unravel the disordered structure of the infected and injured lung, alongside the distribution of extensive immune infiltration. Neutrophil and macrophage infiltration are hallmarks of bacterial pneumonia and COVID-19, respectively. We provide evidence that SARS-CoV-2 infects predominantly alveolar epithelial cells and induces a localized hyperinflammatory cell state that is associated with lung damage. We leverage the temporal range of fatal outcomes of COVID-19 in relation to the onset of symptoms, which reveals increased macrophage extravasation and increased numbers of mesenchymal cells and fibroblasts concomitant with increased proximity between these cell types as the disease progresses-possibly as a result of attempts to repair the damaged lung tissue. Our data enable us to develop a biologically interpretable landscape of lung pathology from a structural, immunological and clinical standpoint.

METHODS: We surveyed 16 physicians across 3 hospitals in our healthcare system to address COVID-19 related concerns in the management of interventional and structural heart disease patients, and to formulate system wide criteria for deferring cases till after the pandemic. RESULTS: Our survey yielded common concerns centered on the need to protect patients, cath lab staff and physicians from unnecessary exposure to COVID-19; for COVID-19 testing prior to arrival to the cath lab; for clear communication between the referring physician and the interventionalist; but there was initial uncertainty among physicians regarding the optimal management of ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI; percutaneous coronary intervention versus thrombolytics). Patients with stable angina and hemodynamically stable acute coronary syndromes were deemed suitable for initial medical management, except when they had large ischemic burden. Most transcatheter aortic valve implantations (TAVI) were felt appropriate for postponement except in symptomatic patients with aortic valve area <0.5 cm2 or recent hospitalization for heart failure (HF). Most percutaneous mitral valve repair (pMVR) procedures were felt appropriate for postponement except in patients with HF. All left atrial appendage closure (LAAC) and patent foramen ovale (PFO)/atrial septal defect (ASD) closure procedures were felt appropriate for postponement.

This rapid review provides an evaluation of current evidence with input from clinical experts to produce guidance for screening for active COVID-19 in a low prevalence setting. METHODS: An initial search of PubMed (until 6 May 2020) was combined with targeted searches of both PubMed and Google Scholar until 1 July 2020. Findings were streamlined for clinical relevance through the advice of an expert working group that included seven senior surgeons and a senior medical virologist. RESULTS: Patient history should be examined for potential exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Hyposmia and hypogeusia may present as early symptoms of COVID-19, and can potentially discriminate from other influenza-like illnesses. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction is the gold standard diagnostic test to confirm SARS-CoV-2 infection, and although sensitivity can be improved with repeated testing, the decision to retest should incorporate clinical history and the local supply of diagnostic resources. At present, routine serological testing has little utility for diagnosing acute infection. To appropriately conduct preoperative testing, the temporal dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 must be considered. Relative to other thoracic imaging modalities, computed tomography has the greatest utility for characterizing pulmonary involvement in COVID-19 patients who have been diagnosed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. CONCLUSION: Through a rapid review of the literature and advice from a clinical expert working group, evidence-based recommendations have been produced for the preoperative screening of surgical patients with suspected COVID-19.","Kovoor, Joshua G; Tivey, David R; Williamson, Penny; Tan, Lorwai; Kopunic, Helena S; Babidge, Wendy J; Collinson, Trevor G; Hewett, Peter J; Hugh, Thomas J; Padbury, Robert T A; Frydenberg, Mark; Douglas, Richard G; Kok, Jen; Maddern, Guy J",ANZ j.

487199,Will China Lead Humanity into an “Asian” Future?,2021,"Introduction-objectives: We live in exceptional times caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus pandemic. Although clinical involvement of children and patients with congenital heart disease are not frequent, the emergency care of adults with COVID-19 has almost collapsed our healthcare system. Consequently, the whole standard activity has been minimized during this period. In this manuscript we analyse the reduction of our congenital heart surgery over these 2 months of state of alarm, and we propose strategies to return to normal. Methods: From our Society congenital heart disease working group, a survey was carried out in Spanish congenital heart disease surgery hospitals, in order to find out the decrease in activity caused by the COVID-19 pandemic during the time period from March-13 to May-13, 2020. Results: During the pandemic, congenital heart disease surgery was partially reduced, stepping with the most urgent cases and minimizing the scheduled activity. Compared to the same period in 2019, 51% less major surgery and 54% less extracorporeal surgery were performed. Collaboration in adults COVID-19 front line care has been 15%, having 7% of our specialists on quarantine. Before operating on any patient, the PCR is asked to rule out SARS-CoV-2 infection and, if positive, we only consider intervention in urgent / emergency cases. Conclusions: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has forced all the congenital heart disease services nationwide to restructure, aiming to support colleagues with direct treatment of COVID-19, without sacrificing the healthcare of our own patients whose surgery could not be delayed.","Polo López, Luz; Centella Hernández, Tomasa; González Calle, Antonio; Bautista Hernández, Víctor; Gil Jaúrena, Juan Miguel; Fernández Doblas, Joaquín; Aramendi Gallardo, José Ignacio; Ríos Rodríguez, Luis; Ruiz Alonso, Enrique; Boni, Lorenzo; Merino Cejas, Carlos; Aguilar Jiménez, Juan Miguel; Serrano Martínez, Félix; Caffarena Calvar, José María",Cir.

(2) Methods: We conducted an overview of systematics reviews and searched the literature in the databases MEDLINE/PubMed, Cochrane, EMBASE, and Web of Science electronic databases. After a meticulous screening, we identified 20 that met the inclusion criteria, and RHIS evaluation results were presented according to the Performance of Routine Information System Management (PRISM) framework. (3) Results: The reviews were published between 2007 and 2020, focusing on the use of different systems or technologies and aimed to analyze interventions on professionals, centers, or patients' outcomes. All reviews examined showed variability in results in accordance with the variability of interventions and target populations. We have found different areas for improvement for RHISs according to the three determinants of the PRISM framework that influence the configuration of RHISs: technical, organizational, or behavioral elements. (4) Conclusions: RHIS interventions in the European region are promising. However, new global and international strategies and the development of tools and mechanisms should be promoted to highly integrate platforms among European countries.","Saigí-Rubió, Francesc; Pereyra-Rodríguez, José Juan; Torrent-Sellens, Joan; Eguia, Hans; Azzopardi-Muscat, Natasha; Novillo-Ortiz, David",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,360

METHODS: Nasopharyngeal swabs from patients with or suspected of having coronavirus disease 2019 were collected and tested at Bichat-Claude Bernard Hospital, Paris, France. Using the World Health Organisation-approved real-time-PCR assay developed by the Charité Institute of Virology as the reference, positive percent agreement (PPA) and negative percent agreement (NPA) were calculated. RESULTS: In total, 189 negative and 88 positive samples were analyzed. QIAstat-SARS-CoV-2 had an NPA of 90.48% (95% confidence interval (CI), 85.37%, 94.26%) and a PPA of 94.32% (95% CI, 87.24%, 98.13%). Co-infections were detected by QIAstat-SARS-CoV-2 in 4/277 specimens. The methods exhibited comparable failure rates (23/307 [7.5%] vs. 6/298 [2.0%] for QIAstat-SARS-CoV-2 and reference methods, respectively). The turnaround time was shorter for QIAstat-SARS-CoV-2 compared with the reference method (difference in mean -14:30 h [standard error, 0:03:23; 95% CI, -14:37, -14:24]; P < 0.001).

488147,No time for fun: the politics of partying during a pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND: Acute cholecystitis is a common reason for emergency general surgery admission. The declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic may have resulted in treatment delays and corresponding increases in severity of disease. This study compared cholecystitis admissions and disease severity pre- and postdeclaration of pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective review of adult acute cholecystitis admissions (January 1,2020-May 31, 2020). Corresponding time periods in 2018 and 2019 comprised the historical control. Difference-in-differences analysis compared biweekly cholecystitis admissions pre- and postdeclaration in 2020 to the historical control. Odds of increased severity of disease presentation were assessed using multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: Cholecystitis admissions decreased 48.7% from 5.2 to 2.67 cases (RR 0.51 [0.28,0.96], P = 0.04) following pandemic declaration when comparing 2020 to historical control (P = 0.02). After stratifying by severity, only Tokyo I admissions declined significantly postdeclaration (RR 0.42 [0.18,0.97]), when compared to historical control (P = 0.02). There was no change in odds of presenting with severe disease after the pandemic declaration (aOR 1.00 [95% CI 0.30, 3.38] P < 0.99) despite significantly longer lengths of symptoms reported in mild cases. CONCLUSIONS: Postpandemic declaration we experienced a significant decrease in cholecystitis admissions without corresponding increases in disease severity. The pandemic impacted healthcare-seeking behaviors, with fewer mild presentations. Given that the pandemic did not increase odds of presenting with increased severity of disease, our data suggests that not all mild cases of cholecystitis progress to worsening disease and some may resolve without medical or surgical intervention.","Vallès, Katherine F; Neufeld, Miriam Y; Caron, Elisa; Sanchez, Sabrina E; Brahmbhatt, Tejal S",J Surg Res,,360

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 407 patients from four high-volume centres with NMIBC that applied for follow-up cystoscopy were included in our study prospectively. Patients' demographics and previous tumour characteristics, the presence of tumour in follow-up cystoscopy, the pathology results of the latest transurethral resection of bladder tumour (if tumour was detected) and the delay in cystoscopy time were recorded. Our primary outcomes were tumour recurrences detected by follow-up cystoscopy and progression. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed using the possible factors identified with univariate analyses (P values &#8804; .2). RESULTS: A total of 105 patients (25.8%) had tumour recurrence in follow-up cystoscopy, and 20 (5.1%) of these patients had disease progression according to grade or stage. In multivariate analysis, the number of recurrences (OR: 1.307, P < .001) and the cystoscopy delay time (62-147 days, OR: 2.424, P = .002; >147 days, OR: 4.883, P < .001) were significant risk factors for tumour recurrence on follow-up cystoscopy; the number of recurrences (OR: 1.255, P = .024) and cystoscopy delay time (>90 days, OR: 6.704, P = .002) were significant risk factors for tumour progression. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that a 2-5 months of delay in follow-up cystoscopy increases the risk of recurrence by 2.4-fold, and delay in cystoscopy for more than 3 months increases the probability of progression by 6.7-fold. We suggest that cystoscopic surveillance should be done during the COVID-19 pandemic according to the schedule set by relevant guidelines.","Culpan, Meftun; Keser, Ferhat; Acar, Hazal Cansu; Otunctemur, Alper; Kucuk, Eyup Veli; Erdem, Selcuk; Ozer, Murat; Sen, Ugur Tolga; Degirmenci, Enes; Ergul, Rifat; Atis, Ramazan Gokhan; Yildirim, Asif",Int J Clin Pract,,360

We employed computational and transcriptome analyses of publicly available datasets from PBMCs from 126 patients with COVID-19 admitted to ICU (n=50), COVID-19 not admitted to ICU (n=50), non-COVID-19 admitted to ICU (n=16) and non-COVID-19 not admitted to ICU (n=10), and utilized the Gencode V33 assembly to analyze protein coding mRNA and long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) transcriptomes in the context of disease severity. Our data identified several aberrantly expressed mRNA and lncRNA based biomarkers associated with SARS-CoV-2 severity, which in turn significantly affected canonical, upstream, and disease functions in each group of patients. Immune, interferon, and antiviral responses were severely suppressed in COVID-19 admitted to ICU versus COVID-19 who were not admitted to ICU. Our data suggests a possible therapeutic approach for severe COVID-19 through administration of interferon therapy. Delving further into these biomarkers, roles and their implications on the onset and disease severity of COVID-19 could play a crucial role in patient stratification and identifying varied therapeutic options with diverse clinical implications.","Shaath, Hibah; Alajez, Nehad M",Heliyon,,360

490389,The great reset of management and organization theory. A European perspective,2021,"COVID-19 mortality is primarily driven by abnormal alveolar fluid metabolism of the lung, leading to fluid accumulation in the alveolar airspace. This condition is generally referred to as pulmonary edema and is a direct consequence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. There are multiple potential mechanisms leading to pulmonary edema in severe Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) patients and understanding of those mechanisms may enable proper management of this condition. Here, we provide a perspective on abnormal lung humoral metabolism of pulmonary edema in COVID-19 patients, review the mechanisms by which pulmonary edema may be induced in COVID-19 patients, and propose putative drug targets that may be of use in treating COVID-19. Among the currently pursued therapeutic strategies against COVID-19, little attention has been paid to abnormal lung humoral metabolism. Perplexingly, successful balance of lung humoral metabolism may lead to the reduction of the number of COVID-19 death limiting the possibility of healthcare services with insufficient capacity to provide ventilator-assisted respiration.","Cui, X.; Chen, W.; Zhou, H.; Gong, Y.; Zhu, B.; Lv, X.; Guo, H.; Duan, J.; Zhou, J.; Marcon, E.; Ma, H.",Frontiers in Pharmacology,,360

490857,Žižek's Pandemic: On Utopian Realism and the Spirit of Communism,2021,"OBJECTIVES: To describe the risk factors for and outcomes after myoclonus in a cohort of patients with coronavirus disease 2019. DESIGN: Multicenter case series. SETTING: Three tertiary care hospitals in Massachusetts, Georgia, and Virginia. PATIENTS: Eight patients with clinical myoclonus in the setting of coronavirus disease 2019. INTERVENTIONS & MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Outcomes in patients with myoclonus were variable, with one patient who died during the study period and five who were successfully extubated cognitively intact and without focal neurologic deficits. In five cases, the myoclonus completely resolved within 2 days of onset, while in three cases, it persisted for 10 days or longer. Seven patients experienced significant metabolic derangements, hypoxemia, or exposure to sedating medications that may have contributed to the development of myoclonus. One patient presented with encephalopathy and developed prolonged myoclonus in the absence of clear systemic provoking factors. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that myoclonus may be observed in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infected patients, even in the absence of hypoxia. This association warrants further evaluation in larger cohorts to determine whether the presence of myoclonus may aid in the assessment of disease severity, neurologic involvement, or prognostication.","Anand, Pria; Zakaria, Asma; Benameur, Karima; Ong, Charlene; Putman, Maryann; O039,; Shea, Sarah; Greer, David; Cervantes-Arslanian, Anna M",Crit Care Med,,360
490858,Žižek's Pandemic: On Utopian Realism and the Spirit of Communism,2021,"Introduction: There is limited data pertaining to comparative outcomes of remaining on dialysis versus kidney transplantation as the threat of COVID-19 remains. This study aims to delineate the differential risks involved using serological methods to help define exposure rates. Methods: From a cohort of 1433 patients with ESKD, we analysed COVID-19 infection rates and outcomes in 299 wait list patients compared with 237 transplant recipients within their first year post-transplant. Patients were followed over a 68-day period from the time our transplant programme closed due to COVID-19. Results: The overall mortality rate in wait list and transplant populations were equivalent, p=0.69. However, COVID-19 infection was more commonly diagnosed in the wait list patients, p=0.001, who were more likely to be tested by RT-PCR, p=0.0004. Once infection was confirmed, mortality risk was higher in the transplant patients, p=0.015. The seroprevalence in dialysis and transplant patients with undetected infection was 18.3% and 4.6% respectively, p=0.0001. After adjusting for a potential screening bias, the relative risk of death following a diagnosis of COVID-19 remained higher in transplant recipients, HR: 3.36 (1.19-9.50), p=0.022. Conclusions: In conclusion, whilst COVID-19 infection was more common in the wait list patients, a higher COVID-19 associated mortality rate was seen in transplant recipients, resulting in comparable overall mortality rates.","Clarke, Candice; Lucisano, Gaetano; Prendecki, Maria; Gleeson, Sarah; Martin, Paul; Ali, Mahrukh; McAdoo, Stephen P; Lightstone, Liz; Ashby, Damien; Charif, Rawya; Griffith, Megan; McLean, Adam; Dor, Frank; Willicombe, Michelle",,,360

IL-18 regulates both T helper (Th) 1 and Th2 responses. It acts synergistically with IL-12 in the Th1 paradigm, whereas with IL-2 and without IL-12 it can induce Th2 cytokine production from cluster of differentation (CD)4+ T cells, natural killer (NK cells, NKT cells, as well as from Th1 cells. IL-18 also plays a role in the hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, a life-threatening condition characterized by a cytokine storm that can be secondary to infections. IL-18-mediated inflammation was largely studied in animal models of bacterial, viral, parasitic, and fungal infections. These studies highlight the contribution of either IL-18 overproduction by the host or overresponsiveness of the host to IL-18 causing an exaggerated inflammatory burden and leading to tissue injury. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The damage in the later phase of the disease appears to be driven by a cytokine storm, including interleukin IL-1 family members and secondary cytokines like IL-6. IL-18 may participate in this hyperinflammation, as it was previously found to be able to cause injury in the lung tissue of infected animals. IL-18 blockade has become an appealing therapeutic target and has been tested in some IL-18-mediated rheumatic diseases and infantile-onset macrophage activation syndrome. Given its role in regulating the immune response to infections, IL-18 blockade might represent a therapeutic option for COVID-19, although further studies are warranted to investigate more in detail the exact role of IL-18 in SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Vecchié, Alessandra; Bonaventura, Aldo; Toldo, Stefano; Dagna, Lorenzo; Dinarello, Charles A; Abbate, Antonio",J. cell. physiol,,360
492600,From timely exegesis to contemporary ecclesiology: Relevant hermeneutics and provocative embodiment of faith in a corona-defined world – Generosity during a pandemic,2021,"Running machine learning analytics over geographically distributed datasets is a rapidly arising problem in the world of data management policies ensuring privacy and data security. Visualizing high dimensional data using tools such as t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (tSNE) and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) became common practice for data scientists. Both tools scale poorly in time and memory. While recent optimizations showed successful handling of 10,000 data points, scaling beyond million points is still challenging. We introduce a novel framework: Sketch and Scale (SnS). It leverages a Count Sketch data structure to compress the data on the edge nodes, aggregates the reduced size sketches on the master node, and runs vanilla tSNE or UMAP on the summary, representing the densest areas, extracted from the aggregated sketch. We show this technique to be fully parallel, scale linearly in time, logarithmically in memory, and communication, making it possible to analyze datasets with many millions, potentially billions of data points, spread across several data centers around the globe. We demonstrate the power of our method on two mid-size datasets: cancer data with 52 million 35-band pixels from multiple images of tumor biopsies; and astrophysics data of 100 million stars with multi-color photometry from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS).","Wei, Viska; Ivkin, Nikita; Braverman, Vladimir; Szalay, Alexander",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.06103v1.pdf,360

METHODS: Two groups of COVID-19 patients were retrospectively screened on the basis of plasma sodium level at admission: hyponatremic (sodium < 135 mM, n = 92) or normonatremic (sodium &#8805; 135 mM, n = 198) patients. Pearson's chi-2 (qualitative variables) and Student's T tests (quantitative variables) were used to compare the two groups. A multiple logistic regression model was used to explore the association between patients' clinical data and outcomes. RESULTS: Hyponatremia was frequent but generally mild. There were more male patients in the hyponatremic group (p = 0.014). Pulmonary lesions on the first thoracic CT-scan performed during hospitalization were significantly more extensive in the hyponatremic group (p = 0.010). ICU admission, mechanical ventilation or death were significantly more frequent in hyponatremic compared to normonatremic patients (37 versus 14%; p < 0.001; 17 versus 6%; p = 0.003; 18 versus 9%, p = 0.042, respectively). Hyponatremia was an independent predictor of adverse outcomes (adjusted Odds-ratio: 2.77 [1.26-6.15, p = 0.011]). CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed an independent relationship between hyponatremia at admission and transfer to ICU, use of mechanical ventilation or death in COVID-19 patients. Hyponatremia may reflect the severity of underlying pulmonary lesions. Our results support the use of sodium levels as a simple bedside screening tool for the early identification of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients at high risk of poor outcome.","De Carvalho, Hugo; Letellier, Thibault; Karakachoff, Matilde; Desvaux, Geoffrey; Caillon, Hélène; Papuchon, Emmanuelle; Bentoumi-Loaec, Maxime; Benaouicha, Nesrine; Canet, Emmanuel; Chapelet, Guillaume; Le Turnier, Paul; Montassier, Emmanuel; Rouhani, Armine; Goffinet, Nicolas; Figueres, Lucile",J. nephrol,,360

494298,"The Energy Transition, Trump Energy Agenda and COVID-19",2021,"BACKGROUND: The Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic broke out in December 2019 and is now characterized as a pandemic. Effective control of this infectious disease requires access to diagnostic techniques, for both case finding and epidemic size estimation. The molecular technique is routinely used worldwide. Although it is the ""standard"" case detection and management method, it has its own shortcomings. Thus, some easy-to-use rapid serological tests have been developed. METHODS: One hundred and fourteen positive RT-PCR-diagnosed patients were tested by VivaDiag Kit, a brand of rapid serological kits available in hospitals affiliated to Tehran University of Medical Sciences (TUMS), Tehran, Iran. Frozen serum specimens taken from healthy people in summer and fall 2019 were also tested as negative controls. RESULTS: Test sensitivity was 47.9% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 38.8-56.9) for IgM and 47.0% (95% CI: 38.0-56.0) for IgG. There was no difference between IgG and IgM seropositivity except in one case. Specificity was calculated as 99.0% (95% CI: 96.4-99.9) for IgM and of 100.0% (95% CI: 0.98.2-100.0) for IgG. Sensitivity was higher in men and older participants. CONCLUSION: This test can be used for epidemiological investigations, especially for the estimation of the level of infection in the community, after it is properly corrected for sensitivity and specificity. The low sensitivity could be attributed to the technical limitations of the kit or low levels of antibodies after infection. The different sensitivity in age and sex groups supports the hypothesis that different people show different immune responses to this virus.","Shamsollahi, Hamid Reza; Amini, Mostafa; Alizadeh, Shaban; Nedjat, Saharnaz; Akbari-Sari, Ali; Rezaei, Mehdi; Allameh, Seyed Farshad; Fotouhi, Akbar; Yunesian, Masud",Arch Iran Med,,360

However, the long-term effects of COVID-19 on physical activity (PA) in this subgroup of patients with persistent symptoms remain unclear. Methods: Demographics, self-reported average time spent walking per week, as well as participation in activities pre-COVID-19 and after three and six months of follow-up were assessed in members of online long-COVID-19 peer support groups. Results: Two hundred thirty-nine patients with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis were included (83% women, median (IQR) age: 50 (39-56) years). Patients reported a significantly decreased weekly walking time after three months of follow-up (three months: 60 (15-120) min. vs. pre-COVID-19: 120 (60-240) min./week; p < 0.05). Six months after the onset of symptoms walking time was still significantly lower compared to pre-COVID-19 but significantly increased compared to three months of follow-up (three months: 60 (15-120) min. vs. six months: 90 (30-150) min.; p < 0.05). Conclusions: Patients who experience persistent symptoms after COVID-19 may still demonstrate a significantly decreased walking time six months after the onset of symptoms.

Recently, vaccination against COVID-19 has begun, but further studies on effective therapeutic agents are still needed. The severity of COVID-19 is attributable to several factors such as the dysfunctional host immune response manifested by uncontrolled viral replication, type I interferon suppression, and release of impaired cytokines by the infected resident and recruited cells. Due to the evolving pathophysiology and direct involvement of the host immune system in COVID-19, the use of immune-modulating drugs is still challenging. For the use of immune-modulating drugs in severe COVID-19, it is important to balance the fight between the aggravated immune system and suppression of immune defense against the virus that causes secondary infection. In addition, the interplaying events that occur during virus-host interactions, such as activation of the host immune system, immune evasion mechanism of the virus, and manifestation of different stages of COVID-19, are disjunctive and require thorough streamlining. This review provides an update on the immunotherapeutic interventions implemented to combat COVID-19 along with the understanding of molecular aspects of the immune evasion of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which may provide opportunities to develop more effective and promising therapeutics.","Shah, Masaud; Woo, Hyun Goo",Mol Cells,,360

Beginning with a reinvigorated interest in the economic vision of the apostle Paul about what is meant by “weak” and “good works” and what the Pastoral Epistles communicate with eusebeia (not “godliness” but “social respectability and civility”), we reconsider the collection as an act on the part of the Pauline mission churches to express more than ecclesial unity This act embodied a theology of grace in mutual reciprocity and in equitable provision on the part of the wealthy for the poor, not least and not limited to those in their own Christian assemblies The term isotēs is too easily glossed over when translated as “fair balance”, “fairness”, and so the translation of the term with “equity” or “equality” comes closest to the vision of the apostle Too few studies on this term baptize it sufficiently in the economics of the ancient world and the early Christian radical vision of siblingship and family Contribution: From the perspective of the Historical Thought and Source Interpretation of the work of Paul, the question of systemic equality or equity is as crucial to navigating the current economic climate as it has ever been Equality or equity is not limited to Christian communities but following the early church in embodying a theology of grace","McKnight, Scot",Hervormde Teologiese Studies,,360

We propose a method comprising data analytics and machine learning classification for evaluating the effectiveness of lockdown regulations. Lockdown regulations should be reviewed on a regular basis by governments, to enable reasonable control over the outbreak. The model aims to measure the efficiency of lockdown procedures for various countries. The model shows a direct correlation between lockdown procedures and the infection rate. Lockdown efficiency is measured by finding a correlation coefficient between lockdown attributes and the infection rate. The lockdown attributes include retail and recreation, grocery and pharmacy, parks, transit stations, workplaces, residential, and schools. Our results show that combining all the independent attributes in our study resulted in a higher correlation (0.68) to the dependent value Interquartile 3 (Q3).

Methods: This case & ndash;control study enrolled 323 Saudi adults with COVID-19, confirmed by real-time reverse transcription & ndash;polymerase chain reaction. The participants were selected randomly between August 31, 2020, and July 1, 2020, from the Health Electronic Surveillance Network system, which contains the primary data on COVID-19 infections in Jazan, Saudi Arabia. The sample included 108 patients who died due to COVID-19 disease and 215 controls who recovered from it (1:2 ratio). The chi-square test, independent samples t-test, and logistic regression were used to perform the statistical analysis. Results: Mortality was higher in older age patients with COVID-19 (mean = 65.4 years, standard deviation [SD] = 15.6) compared to recovered patients (mean = 39.5 years, SD = 14.8) (p &lt; 0.001) with a moderate effect size (eta squared = 0.06). Diabetes mellitus (odds ratio [OR] = 9.4), hypertension (OR = 8.6), cardiovascular disease (OR = 7.4), chronic kidney disease (OR = 3.3), and obesity (OR = 2.0) were significantly associated with death due to COVID-19. Using logistic regression analysis, older age and diabetes mellitus were the primary independent predictors of COVID-19 mortality. However, there was no significant association between a specific ABO blood group and mortality risk (P = 0.07). Conclusion: Older age and the presence of co-morbidities, especially diabetes mellitus, increased the risk of death in patients with COVID-19. Establishing the causality of death in patients with COVID-19 should be a key aim of future studies. (c) 2021 The Author(s).

498716,The New Fear of One Another,2020,"COVID-19 continues to cause a significant impact on public health. To minimize this impact, policy makers undertake containment measures that however, when carried out disproportionately to the actual threat, as a result if errorneous threat assessment, cause undesirable long-term socio-economic complications. In addition, macro-level or national level decision making fails to consider the localized sensitivities in small regions. Hence, the need arises for region-wise threat assessments that provide insights on the behaviour of COVID-19 through time, enabled through accurate forecasts. In this study, a forecasting solution is proposed, to predict daily new cases of COVID-19 in regions small enough where containment measures could be locally implemented, by targeting three main shortcomings that exist in literature; the unreliability of existing data caused by inconsistent testing patterns in smaller regions, weak deploy-ability of forecasting models towards predicting cases in previously unseen regions, and model training biases caused by the imbalanced nature of data in COVID-19 epi-curves. Hence, the contributions of this study are three-fold; an optimized smoothing technique to smoothen less deterministic epi-curves based on epidemiological dynamics of that region, a Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM) based forecasting model trained using data from select regions to create a representative and diverse training set that maximizes deploy-ability in regions with lack of historical data, and an adaptive loss function whilst training to mitigate the data imbalances seen in epi-curves. The proposed smoothing technique, the generalized training strategy and the adaptive loss function largely increased the overall accuracy of the forecast, which enables efficient containment measures at a more localized micro-level.","Marikkar, Umar; Weligampola, Harshana; Perera, Rumali; Hassan, Jameel; Sritharan, Suren; Jayatilaka, Gihan; Godaliyadda, Roshan; Herath, Vijitha; Ekanayake, Parakrama; Ekanayake, Janaka; Rathnayake, Anuruddhika; Dharmaratne, Samath",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.09556v1.pdf,360

It is also a risk event for the public in affected areas. However, little is known about the relationship between ""being involved/exposed in a risk event at the moment"" and people's risk perception of that event. METHODS: The mediation model and analysis of covariance method were performed on a Chinese sample (N = 351) during the outbreak of COVID-19 to test the underlying mechanism between risk event involvement and risk perception. RESULTS: Risk event involvement was positively related not only to people's event-related risk perception but also their general risk perception (i.e. risk perception towards other events), and negative emotion mediated these relationships. In addition, the residents of Wuhan (vs. non-Wuhan) exhibited significantly higher event-related risk perception as well as general risk perception. CONCLUSIONS: The findings deepen our understanding of risk perception by suggesting that being involved in a risk event at the moment is also a nonnegligible variable positively related to risk perception through increased negative emotion. Finally, theoretical and managerial implications of the result are discussed.","Qian, Da; Li, Ou",Applied psychology. Health and well-being (Online),,360

Statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics (v26) software. A Medline search was performed, in order to attempt a comparative analysis with published papers. RESULTS: 28 Centers answered, for a response rate of 87.5%. Most of the urology staff in the Lombardy region were employed in COVID wards (p = 0.003), with a statistically significant reduction in the number of radical cystectomies (RC) performed during that time (p = 0.036). The total amount of RC across Italy remained the same between 2019 and 2020, however there was an increase in the number of surgeries performed in the Southern region. This was most likely due to travel restrictions limiting travel the North. The number of Trans-Urethral Resection of Bladder Tumors (TURBT) (p = 0.046) was higher in Academic Centers (AC) in 2020 (p = 0.037). CONCLUSIONS: The data of our survey, although limited, represents a snap shot of the management of BC during the first month of the COVD-19 pandemic, which posed a major challenge for cancer centers seeking to provide care during an extremely dynamic clinical and political situation which requires maximum flexibility to be appropriately managed.","Maccagnano, Carmen; Rocchini, Lorenzo; Montanari, Emanuele; Conti, Giario Natale; Petralia, Giovanni; Dehò, Federico; Bryan, Kadi-Ann; Contieri, Roberto; Hurle, Rodolfo",,,360
501052,Econometrics For Decision Making: Building Foundations Sketched By Haavelmo And Wald,2019-12-17,"We used automatic text-mining of PubMed abstracts of papers related to obesity, with the aim of revealing that the information used in abstracts reflects the current understanding and key concepts of this widely explored problem. We compared expert data from DisGeNET to the results of an automated MeSH (Medical Subject Heading) search, which was performed by the ScanBious web tool. The analysis provided an overview of the obesity field, highlighting major trends such as physiological conditions, age, and diet, as well as key well-studied genes, such as adiponectin and its receptor. By intersecting the DisGeNET knowledge with the ScanBious results, we deciphered four clusters of obesity-related genes. An initial set of 100+ thousand abstracts and 622 genes was reduced to 19 genes, distributed among just a few groups: heredity, inflammation, intercellular signaling, and cancer. Rapid profiling of articles could drive personalized medicine: if the disease signs of a particular person were superimposed on a general network, then it would be possible to understand which are non-specific (observed in cohorts and, therefore, most likely have known treatment solutions) and which are less investigated, and probably represent a personalized case.","Tarbeeva, Svetlana; Lyamtseva, Ekaterina; Lisitsa, Andrey; Kozlova, Anna; Ponomarenko, Elena; Ilgisonis, Ekaterina",,,360

We propose to elucidate the implications of SARS-CoV2 copies in concurrent nasopharyngeal swab (NPS), whole mouth fluid (WMF) and respiratory droplet (RD) samples on disease pathogenesis/transmission. METHODS: SARS-CoV2 copies quantified by RT-PCR in concurrent NPS, WMF and RD samples from 80 suspected COVID-19 patients were analysed with demographics, immune response and disease severity. RESULTS: Among the 55/80 (69 %) NPS-positive patients, SARS-CoV2 was detected in 44/55 (80 %) WMF (concordance with NPS-84 %; p = 0.02) and 17/55 (31 %) RD samples. SARS-CoV2 copies were similar in NPS (median:8.74 × 10^5) and WMF (median:3.07 × 10^4), but lower in RD (median:3.60 × 10^2). The 25-75 % interquartile range of SARS-CoV2 copies in the NPS was significantly higher in patients who shed the virus in WMF (p = 0.0001) and RD (p = 0.01). Multivariate analyses showed that hospitalized patients shed significantly higher virus copies in the WMF (p = 0.01). Hospitalized patients with more severe disease (p = 0.03) and higher IL-6 values (p = 0.001) shed more SARS-CoV2 virus in the RD. CONCLUSIONS: WMF may be used reliably as a surrogate for diagnosis. High copy numbers in the NPS probably imply early disease onset, while in the WMF and RD may imply more severe disease and increased inflammation.","Kannian, Priya; Jayaraman, Bagavad Gita; Alamelu, Swarna; Lavanya, Chandra; Kumarasamy, Nagalingeswaran; Rajan, Gunaseelan; Ranganathan, Kannan; Mahanathi, Pasuvaraj; Ashwini, Veeraraghavan; Challacombe, Stephen J; Webster-Cyriaque, Jennifer; Johnson, Newell W",Virus Res,,360

502197,C. difficile and the Patient with Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Testing Dilemma,2020,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has drawn the scientific community's attention to pre-existing metabolic conditions that could aggravate the infection, causing extended viral shedding, prolonged hospitalization, and high death rates. Metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) emerges as a surrogate for COVID-19 severity due to the constellation of metabolic alterations it entails. This review outlines the impact MAFLD exerts on COVID-19 severity in obese subjects, besides the possible mechanistic links to the poor outcomes. The data collected showed that MAFLD patients had poorer COVID-19 outcomes than non-MAFLD obese subjects. MAFLD is generally accompanied by impaired glycemic control and systemic arterial hypertension, both of which can decompensate during the COVID-19 clinical course. Also, MAFLD subjects had higher plasma inflammatory marker concentrations than non-MAFLD subjects, which might be related to an intensified cytokine storm syndrome frequently associated with the need for mechanical ventilation and death. In conclusion, MAFLD represents a higher risk than obesity for COVID-19 severity, resulting in poor outcomes and even progression to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Hepatologists should include MAFLD subjects in the high-risk group, intensify preventive measurements, and prioritize their vaccination.","Vasques-Monteiro, Isabela Macedo Lopes; Souza-Mello, Vanessa",World J Gastroenterol,,360

Although there are benefits for both animal welfare and researchers, advances on alternative methods have not progressed enough to be able to replace animal research in the foreseeable future. This trend has led first and foremost to a substantial increase in the administrative burden and hurdles required to make timely advances in research and treatments for human and animal diseases.

However, to our knowledge no studies have covered the clinical course of patients with moderate-type COVID-19. This study describes the clinical course of moderate-type patients with COVID-19 from Wuhan City and Yiyang City, and explores factors relevant to the length of hospitalization and symptoms relief. Methods: The study analyzed the clinical course of 107 moderate-type patients with COVID-19 from the outbreak area (Wuhan) and the imported area (Yiyang), and used automatic linear modeling and multivariate linear regression analysis to explore the factors relevant to the length of hospitalization and symptoms relief. Furthermore, we created a scoring system to value the length of hospitalization and symptoms relief. Results: Lymphopenia, elevated C-reactive protein, increased LDH, bilateral lung GGO (ground glass opacity), and lung consolidation were more likely to appear in ordinary inpatients with moderate-type COVID-19 from Wuhan (P < 0.05), compared to infected medical staff from Wuhan and ordinary inpatients with moderate-type COVID-19 from Yiyang. Meanwhile, the length of hospitalization and symptoms relief was longer in ordinary patients with moderate-type COVID-19 from Wuhan (P < 0.05). Onset of symptoms to admission, ESR, leucocytes count, and bilateral lung GGO were linearly related to the length of hospitalization (P < 0.05); onset of symptoms to admission, leucocytes count, bilateral lung GGO, and lung consolidation were linearly related to the length of symptoms relief (P < 0.05). By using the scoring system, we found that the time of hospitalization and symptoms relief lengthened as the scores increased. Conclusions: This study described the clinical course of patients with moderate-type COVID-19, and found that ordinary patients with moderate-type COVID-19 in outbreak areas were more serious and needed stronger treatment and longer treatment time. Onset of symptoms to admission, ESR, leucocytes count, and bilateral lung GGO can be effective predictors of the length of hospitalization. And onset of symptoms to admission, leucocytes count, bilateral lung GGO, and lung consolidation can be effective predictors of the amount of time until symptoms relief. Most importantly, we have created a scoring system, which could contribute to the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19.","Liao, Xiaohua; Lv, Xin; Song, Cheng; Jiang, Mao; He, Ronglin; Han, Yuanyuan; Li, Mengyu; Zhang, Yan; Jiang, Yupeng; Meng, Jie",Front Public Health,,360

Poland introduced extensive anti-epidemic measures relatively early, in order to slow down the spread of the disease. OBJECTIVES: The study aims at presenting recent data on COVID-19 hospitalization cases during the first months of this outbreak in Poland. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study is a retrospective, population-based study conducted using hospital discharge records that included a COVID-19 diagnosis. Data were obtained from the National Institute of Public Health, where they had been collected in a Polish hospital morbidity study. Data covered 8840 hospitalization records between February 2020 and September 2020. RESULTS: In the study group, we analyzed 8252 records of COVID-19 patients first-time hospitalizations, which accounted for 93 % of all hospitalization cases. The study group consisted of 4161 males (50.4% of all patients) and 4091 females (49.6% of all patients). Significantly more patients from urban than rural regions were hospitalized (21.8 per 100,000 vs 20.5 per 100,000; P<0.02). In the period subject to analysis, 1073 in-hospital deaths were observed (13% of all patients), 965 of which occurred during the first-time hospitalizations (11.7% of all patients). In the study group patients with fatal hospitalizations in comparison to patients with non-fatal hospitalizations were significantly older, more frequently from urban areas, and they had more comorbidities. CONCLUSIONS: The study findings, especially differences in patients with fatal and non-fatal hospitalizations, may be helpful in recognizing patients requiring special medical care and preventive measures during hospitalization.","Kanecki, Krzysztof; Nitsch-Osuch, Aneta; Gorynski, Pawel; Wojtyniak, Bogdan; Juszczyk, Grzegorz; Magdalena, Bogdan; Kosinska, Irena; Tyszko, Piotr",Pol.

This study explores initial PD patients' lived experiences to observe how quality of life and health care has been affected at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic and provide insight into the importance of patient engagement and virtual care. METHODS: Twenty-two virtual, in-depth semi-structured interviews with persons diagnosed with PD who usually attend a Movement Disorders specialty clinic in Calgary, Alberta, were completed between April 28 and May 13, 2020, and the care partners that wished to participate. Interviews were recorded and transcribed, after which transcripts were analyzed and coded into relevant themes using NVivo 12. RESULTS: Impacts from the public health measures and COVID-19 results into three main themes: (1) Impacts of COVID-19 on PD Clinical Care; (2) Activities of Daily Living; (3) Attitudes and Perceptions. Participants reported worsening in motor and nonmotor symptoms and had to accommodate to clinical care via virtual means which were associated with limitations and suggestions for improvement of remote care. CONCLUSION: This study provides a unique opportunity for researchers to better understand the lived experiences of PD patients in all aspects of their life suggesting that innovative means are needed for facilitating virtual health care medicine and increased social interaction.","Anghelescu, Beatrice Ana-Maria; Bruno, Veronica; Martino, Davide; Roach, Pamela",Can J Neurol Sci,,360

We were able to consistently detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in samples taken in late February, when communicated cases in that region were only incipient. We also find that the wastewater viral RNA context increased rapidly and anticipated the subsequent ascent in the number of declared cases. Our results strongly suggest that the virus was undergoing community transmission earlier than previously believed, and suggest that wastewater analysis could be sensitive and cost-effective strategy for COVID-19 epidemiological surveillance. Routine implementation of this surveillance tool would significantly improve our preparedness against new or re-occurring viral outbreaks.","Randazzo, Walter; Cuevas-Ferrando, Enric; Sanjuán, Rafael; Domingo-Calap, Pilar; Sánchez, Gloria",Int J Hyg Environ Health,,360
508247,Using a Virtual Scavenger Hunt to Engage Radiologic Science Students,2021,"Infectious diseases still remain one of the biggest challenges for human health. Accurate and early detection of infectious pathogens are crucial for transmission control, clinical diagnosis, and therapy. For a traditional reason, most immunological and microbiological laboratories are equipped with instruments designated for antibody-based assays in detection of infectious pathogens or clinical diagnosis. Emerging aptamer-based technologies have pushed a shift from antibody-based to aptamer-based assays due to equal specificity, even better sensitivity, lower manufacturing cost and more flexibility in amending for chemiluminescent, electrochemical or fluorescent detection in a multifaceted and high throughput fashion in comparison of aptamer-based to antibody-based assays. The nature of aptamer-based technologies is particularly suitable for point-of-care testing in remote areas at warm or hot atmosphere, and mass screening for potential infection in pandemic of emerging infectious agents, such as SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 in an epicentre or other regions. This review intends to summarize currently available aptamer-based technologies in detection of bacterial, viral, and protozoan pathogens for research and clinical application. It is anticipated that potential technologies will be further optimized and validated for clinical translation in meeting increasing demands for prompt, precise, and reliable detection of specific pathogens in various atmospheric conditions.","Li, Hui-Yan; Jia, Wan-Nan; Li, Xin-Yi; Zhang, Li; Liu, Chang; Wu, Jian",Emerg Microbes Infect,,360

Early intervention in aortovascular disease is often critical and cannot be deferred despite these reductions. There is urgent need to evaluate the provision and outcomes of thoracic aortovascular intervention during the peak of the pandemic. METHODS: Prospective data was collected for patients receiving open and endovascular thoracic aortovascular intervention over two-time points; January-May 2020 and January-May 2019 at three tertiary cardiovascular centres. Baseline demographics, cardiovascular risk and COVID-19 screening results were noted. Primary outcomes were median length of intensive care unit and hospital stay, intra-operative mortality, 30-day mortality, post-operative stroke, and spinal cord injury. RESULTS: Patients operated in 2020 (41) had significantly higher median EuroSCORE II than 2019 (53) (7.44 vs. 5.86, Pâ¯=â¯0.032) and rates of previous cardiac (19.5% vs. 3.8%, Pâ¯=â¯0.019), aortic (14.6% vs. 1.9%, Pâ¯=â¯0.041), and endovascular (22.0% vs. 3.8%, Pâ¯=â¯0.009) intervention. There was an increase in proportion of urgent cases in 2020 (31.7% vs. 18.9%). There were no intra-operative deaths in 2020 and 1 in 2019 (Pâ¯=â¯1.00). There were no significant differences (P &#8805; 0.05) in 30-day mortality (4.9% vs. 13.2%), median intensive care unit length of stay (72 vs. 70 hr), median hospital length of stay (8 vs. 9 days), post-operative stroke (3 vs. 6), or spinal cord injury (2 vs. 1) between 2020 and 2019 respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the increased mortality risk of patients and urgency of cases during COVID-19, complicated by the introduction of cohorting and screening regimens, thoracic aortovascular intervention remained safe with comparable in outcomes to pre-COVID-19.","McPherson, Iain; Chilvers, Nicholas; Freystaetter, Kathrin; Sivaharan, Ashwin; Kanani, Mazyar; Williams, Robin; McCaslin, James; Nandhra, Sandip; Booth, Karen",Ann. vasc. surg,,360

Not only are some cells motile but there is constant motion of organelles, proteins, nucleic acids and other molecules within every living cell. These complex molecular pathways control the life cycle of a cell and all come down to the basic players of the gene expression pathway: DNA, RNA and protein. It is therefore imperative to study biological processes as they naturally occur-in living cells, and to unravel the biophysical rules that govern intracellular dynamics. Towards this end, genetically encoded fluorescent proteins have become one of the major tools available for the study of kinetic processes taking place in real-time. This review will focus on the technical developments available for the study of gene activity in living cells and will summarize the novel biological information extracted from these approaches.","Shav-Tal, Yaron",Soft Matter,,360
510050,Psychological Crisis Interventions with Victims of the Coronavirus Pandemic,2020,"Understanding the relationships between biomedical terms like viruses, drugs, and symptoms is essential in the fight against diseases. Many attempts have been made to introduce the use of machine learning to the scientific process of hypothesis generation (HG), which refers to the discovery of meaningful implicit connections between biomedical terms. However, most existing methods fail to truly capture the temporal dynamics of scientific term relations and also assume unobserved connections to be irrelevant (i.e., in a positive-negative (PN) learning setting). To break these limits, we formulate this HG problem as future connectivity prediction task on a dynamic attributed graph via positive-unlabeled (PU) learning. Then, the key is to capture the temporal evolution of node pair (term pair) relations from just the positive and unlabeled data. We propose a variational inference model to estimate the positive prior, and incorporate it in the learning of node pair embeddings, which are then used for link prediction. Experiment results on real-world biomedical term relationship datasets and case study analyses on a COVID-19 dataset validate the effectiveness of the proposed model. © 2020 Neural information processing systems foundation.

Real-time RT-PCR (Reverse transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction), used to amplify and detect the viral RNA., is considered, as the current gold standard for diagnostics. It is an efficient process, but the complex engineering required for automated RNA extraction and temperature cycling makes it incompatible for use in point of care settings [1]. In the present work, by harnessing progress made in the past two decades in isothermal amplification and paper microfluidics, we created a portable test, in which SARS-CoV-2 RNA is extracted, amplified isothermally by RT-LAMP (Loop-mediated Isothermal Amplification), and detected using intercalating dyes or fluorescent probes. Depending on the viral load in the tested samples, the detection takes between twenty minutes and one hour. Using a set of 16 pools of naso-pharyngal swab eluates, we estimated a limit of detection comparable to real-time RT-PCR (i.e. 1 genome copies per microliter of clinical sample) and no cross-reaction with eight major respiratory viruses currently circulating in Europe. We designed and fabricated an easy-to-use portable device called ""COVIDISC"" to carry out the test at the point of care. The low cost of the materials along with the absence of complex equipment will expedite the widespread dissemination of this device. What is proposed here is a new efficient tool to help managing the pandemics.","Garneret, Pierre; Coz, Etienne; Martin, Elian; Manuguerra, Jean-Claude; Brient-Litzler, Elodie; Enouf, Vincent; González Obando, Daniel Felipe; Olivo-Marin, Jean-Christophe; Monti, Fabrice; van der Werf, Sylvie; Vanhomwegen, Jessica; Tabeling, Patrick",PLoS One,,360

No caso brasileiro, os governos estaduais anteciparam-se com a decretação de medidas de fechamento de escolas, suspensão de eventos públicos e restrição do comércio. O objetivo deste paper é analisar as diferenças entre os governos estaduais do Brasil relativamente à implementação de intervenções não farmacêuticas (NPIs) para o enfrentamento ao coronavírus, com base no cálculo de um índice de ação governamental. Tendo em vista a consecução deste objetivo geral, foram analisados 367 decretos de 25 executivos estaduais brasileiros nos dois primeiros meses da pandemia no país (final de fevereiro e final de abril). Os resultados preliminares desta análise sugerem diferentes níveis de rigor das medidas para o enfrentamento à COVID-19 por parte dos governos estaduais brasileiros, destacando-se a adoção proativa de políticas mais rigorosas de distanciamento social por alguns estados, antes mesmo da confirmação do primeiro caso da doença em seus domínios.","Schaefer, Bruno Marques; Resende, Roberta Carnelos; Epitácio, Sara de Sousa Fernandes; Aleixo, Mariah Torres",Rev. adm. pública (Online),,360

511336,Covid-19 and the accelerating smart home,2020,"Italy and South Korea have two distinctly different healthcare systems, causing them to respond to public health crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic in markedly different ways. Differences exist in medical education for both countries, allowing South Korean medical graduates to have a more holistic education in comparison to their Italian counterparts, who specialize in medical education earlier on. Additionally, there are fewer South Korean physicians per 1000 people in South Korea compared to Italian physicians per 1000 people in Italy. However, both countries have a national healthcare system with universal healthcare coverage. Despite this underlying similarity, the two countries addressed COVID-19 in nearly opposite manners. South Korea employed technology and the holistic education of its physician community, despite having a smaller proportion of physicians in society, to its advantage by implementing efficacious drive-through centers that test suspected individuals rapidly and with little to no contact with healthcare staff, decreasing the possibility of transmission of COVID-19. Conversely, Italy is presently considered the epicenter of the outbreak in Europe and has recorded the highest death toll of any country outside of mainland China. This is partially due to the reactionary nature of Italy's public health measures compared to South Korea's proactive response. The different healthcare responses of South Korea and Italy can inform decisions made by public health bodies in other countries, especially in countries across the Americas, which can selectively adopt policies that have worked in curtailing the spread of COVID-19 and learn from mistakes made by both countries.","Palaniappan, Ashwin; Dave, Udit; Gosine, Brandon",Rev.

DESIGN: Observational study using a time-series analysis. Natural experiment in a big city. SETTING: Population of the city of Buenos Aires and the integrated health reporting system records of positive RT-PCR for COVID-19 tests. PARTICIPANTS: Records from the Argentine Integrated Health Reporting System for all persons with suspected and RT-PCR-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 between 31 January and 14 July 2020. OUTCOMES: To estimate the effects of living in a slum on the standardised incidence rate of COVID-19, corrected Poisson regression models were used. Additionally, the impact of socioeconomic status was performed using an ecological analysis at the community level. RESULTS: A total of 114 052 people were tested for symptoms related with COVID-19. Of these, 39 039 (34.2%) were RT-PCR positive. The incidence rates for COVID-19 towards the end of the 20th week were 160 (155 to 165) per 100 000 people among the inhabitants who did not reside in the slums (n=2 841 997) and 708 (674 to 642) among slums dwellers (n=233 749). Compared with the better-off socioeconomic quintile (1.00), there was a linear gradient on incidence rates: 1.36 (1.25 to 1.46), 1.61 (1.49 to 1.74), 1.86 (1.72 to 2.01), 2.94 (2.74 to 3.16) from Q2 to Q5, respectively. Slum dwellers were associated with an incidence rate of 14.3 (13.4 to 15.4). CONCLUSIONS: The distribution of the epidemic is socially conditioned. Slum dwellers are at a much higher risk than the rest of the community. Slum dwellers should not be considered just another risk category but an entirely different reality that requires policies tailored to their needs.","Macchia, Alejandro; Ferrante, Daniel; Battistella, Gabriel; Mariani, Javier; González Bernaldo de Quirós, Fernán",BMJ Open,,360

514112,Fiscal space and the procyclicality of fiscal policy: The case for making hay while the sun shines,2021,"Particle size is an essential factor when considering the fate and transport of virus-containing droplets expelled by human, because it determines the deposition pattern in the human respiratory system and the evolution of droplets by evaporation and gravitational settling. However, the evolution of virus-containing droplets and the size-dependent viral load have not been studied in detail. The lack of this information leads to uncertainties in understanding the airborne transmission of respiratory diseases, such as the COVID-19. In this study, through a set of differential equations describing the evolution of respiratory droplets and by using the SARS-CoV-2 virus as an example, we investigated the distribution of airborne virus in human expelled particles from coughing and speaking. More specifically, by calculating the vertical distances traveled by the respiratory droplets, we examined the number of viruses that can remain airborne and the size of particles carrying these airborne viruses after different elapsed times. From a single cough, a person with a high viral load in respiratory fluid (2.35 × 109 copies per ml) may generate as many as 1.23 × 105 copies of viruses that can remain airborne after 10 seconds, compared to 386 copies of a normal patient (7.00 × 106 copies per ml). Masking, however, can effectively block around 94% of the viruses that may otherwise remain airborne after 10 seconds. Our study found that no clear size boundary exists between particles that can settle and can remain airborne. The results from this study challenge the conventional understanding of disease transmission routes through airborne and droplet mechanisms. We suggest that a complete understanding of the respiratory droplet evolution is essential and needed to identify the transmission mechanisms of respiratory diseases.","Wang, Yang; Xu, Guang; Huang, Yue-Wern",PLoS One,,360
514329,Bibliometric Analysis Of Herding Behavior In Times Of Crisis,2021-06-09,"Introduction Although COVID-19 related teaching restrictions have impacted all aspects of medical curricula, gross anatomy has been disproportionately affected. To decrease in-person contact many medical schools have adapted their curricula by reducing or eliminating gross dissection. The Indiana University School of Medicine (IUSM), believing gross dissection to be a critical foundational curricular component, retained cadaveric dissection in 2020 but in a reduced capacity (i.e., fewer labs and fewer student per lab). In an effort to address this shortfall in dissection experience and to increase student preparedness, 24 pre-lab demonstration videos covering 26 individual dissections were prepared for the 2020 cohort. Research Aim To determine if individual student performance is correlated with viewing pre-lab videos. Methods Pre-lab videos were available to all first-year students at IUSM (n=378 students across 9 campuses). Viewership data (total views, total duration) were aggregated from the Kaltura online video platform. Student exam performance data (practical and written exams) were compared to viewership data using the Pearson correlation test. Results 91.5% of student course evaluation respondents (n=329) report that they viewed pre-lab videos. Pearson's correlation tests revealed a positive correlation between viewership activity and overall performance on all exams. The strongest correlation (0.182) was between total views and overall practical exam performance. Correlation coefficients for individual block exams vary and range between 0.13 (back, upper limb and thorax) and 0.253 (Head and Neck). Likewise, correlation coefficients varied across campuses with several campuses exceeding the statewide values. Conclusion Pre-lab videos are an effective tool for exporting traditional lab-based learning from the lab environment when access and dissection time are limited. Their most immediate and significant impact is on practical exam performance although positive correlations between viewership data and performance on written exams with NBME-style questions suggests pre-lab videos effectively reinforce foundational anatomical relationships and concepts. While not directly addressing questions of overall cohort performance, particularly when dissection access is not limited, future directions for this research will include direct comparisons of overall class performance in multiple cohorts with and without full dissection schedule and with or without the aid of pre-lab videos. Likewise, student evaluation comments suggest that pre-lab videos were used in a variety of contexts (i.e., lab prep, peer-teaching, general study). An online survey exploring how students use the pre-lab videos was sent to the 2020 cohort at course end to better understand how students are using them. Implications Medical educators are increasingly asked to teach more with fewer contact hours. COVID-19 has exacerbated this situation. This study provides new data suggesting that pre-lab videos are an effective tool for exporting traditional lab-based learning when lab contact time is decreased.","Deane, Andrew Wisner Rebecca Byram Jessica",The FASEB Journal,,360
516524,Bidirectional contact tracing could dramatically improve COVID-19 control,2021,"We provide quantitative predictions of first order supply and demand shocks for the U.S. economy associated with the COVID-19 pandemic at the level of individual occupations and industries. To analyze the supply shock, we classify industries as essential or non-essential and construct a Remote Labor Index, which measures the ability of different occupations to work from home. Demand shocks are based on a study of the likely effect of a severe influenza epidemic developed by the US Congressional Budget Office. Compared to the pre-COVID period, these shocks would threaten around 22% of the US economy's GDP, jeopardise 24% of jobs and reduce total wage income by 17%. At the industry level, sectors such as transport are likely to have output constrained by demand shocks, while sectors relating to manufacturing, mining and services are more likely to be constrained by supply shocks. Entertainment, restaurants and tourism face large supply and demand shocks. At the occupation level, we show that high-wage occupations are relatively immune from adverse supply and demand-side shocks, while low-wage occupations are much more vulnerable. We should emphasize that our results are only first-order shocks -- we expect them to be substantially amplified by feedback effects in the production network.","Rio-Chanona, R.

In this premise, we studied the prognostic value of two markers of iron metabolismferritin and hemoglobin. Methodology: A retrospective-cohort study was carried out in a tertiary hospital in northern India involving 210 hospitalized COVID-19 patients aged 15-andabove. Analysis was done for clinical profile, comorbidities and basic laboratory indices including ferritin-hemoglobin ratio (FHR) with primary end-point being in-hospital all-cause mortality. Results: Median serum ferritin levels (640.00ng/mL vs 220.00ng/mL) were significantly higher among non-survivors as against survivors while median hemoglobin levels were significantly lower (12.12g/dL vs 13.73g/dL). Serum ferritin levels >400ng/mL (Sn 80%, Sp 70%) predicted mortality with high sensitivity and specificity. Notably, serum ferritin levels >400ng/mL (HR 11.075 [1.481-82.801]) and anemia, defined as a hemoglobin of <12g/dL for females and < 13g/dL for males and were significantly associated with the risk of mortality in a univariable Cox-proportional hazards regression. The median FHR was significantly higher among non-survivors compared to survivors (56.98 vs 17.17). FHR>31 (Sn 85% Sp 71.6%) was highly sensitive and specific for predicting mortality. The multivariable analysis indicated that FHR >31 remained an independent risk factor for mortality (HR 12.293 [3.147-48.028]). Conclusion: Ferritin-hemoglobin ratio (FHR), which encompasses into a single index, the effects of both elevated levels of ferritin and the severity of anemia, seems to perform particularly well as a prognostic marker and emerged as an independent risk factor for mortality in COVID-19 patients. Hyperferritinemia and anemia, both, are inexorably interlinked in addition to having a role, directly or indirectly in the disease pathophysiology. Ferritin and hemoglobin, hence should be seen as two sides of the same coin rather than as two discrete entities. © 2021 Journal of Association of Physicians of India.

We describe here a case of what we believe is the oldest (a 70-year-old) JW candidate to undergo a deceased donor kidney transplant reported in the literature. Prior to transplantation, discussions ensued amongst the multidisciplinary transplant team, weighing the potential benefits vs. risks of performing a kidney transplant on this patient due to her refusal (due to religion) to accept any blood transfusions or blood products combined with her advanced age and having longstanding insulin-dependent, type 2 diabetes mellitus with extensive peripheral vascular disease. Preoperatively, we believed that the odds were in favor of performing the kidney transplant safely without the need for any blood product usage. However, her post-operative course was complicated by severe anemia, which developed by post-transplant day 4. The anemia incapacitated the patient's physical and psychological state, creating medical, social and financial burdens on the patient, family, medical team and hospital. Both family and patient grew concerned about her overall condition. Blood transfusion was offered in order to improve her weakness and shortness of breath that developed due to the severe anemia, but the patient (along with her family) refused such treatment. During the 17 days of hospitalization, it was a continuous struggle between the transplant team, patient, and family for her to continue with the recovery process; at times we had even considered that performing the transplant had been a mistake. While organ transplantation can be performed safely in Jehovah's Witnesses, there are multiple factors seen in this particular case that warrant analyzing: (I) the potential use of stricter transplant exclusionary criteria, given the recipient's advanced age and preexisting co-morbidities, which likely increased her risk of developing severe anemia post-operatively, and (II) the recipient's emotional/psychological post-operative state of high anxiety, which developed while she was experiencing the severe anemia; in hindsight, her anxiety level may have been reduced if we had offered daily post-operative psychological counseling sessions. While the patient's allograft is currently doing well, we probably did not have strict enough criteria for proper selection of a JW candidate for kidney transplantation.","Guerra, Giselle; Ortigosa-Goggins, Mariella; Gaynor, Jeffrey J; Ciancio, Gaetano",Ann Transl Med,,360

METHODS: Prospective cohort study of HCWs using repetitive oro- and nasopharygeal swab samples, antibody tests, and self-reported symptoms questionnaires at a tertiary referral center in Copenhagen, Denmark. RESULTS: 347/361 (96%) HCWs participated. Seven (1.9%) were positive on swab tests and none had symptoms. Fifteen (4.2%) developed antibodies. Only one case of potential transmission between HCWs was identified. Infection rates were low and no procedures or areas within the department were identified as exposing HCWs to a higher risk. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Adherence to the surveillance program was high. The low incidence among HCW during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic may reflect local transmission and infection control precautions, as well as a low infectious burden in the Danish society.","Rasmussen, Kasper Møller Boje; Andersen, Peter Anders; Channir, Hani Ibrahim; Aanæs, Kasper; Knudsen, Jenny Dahl; Kirkeby, Nikolai Søren; Klokker, Mads; von Buchwald, Christian; Cayé-Thomasen, Per; Jensen, Ramon Gordon",Eur. arch. oto-rhino-laryngol,,360

The aim of the experiments was to obtaining microorganisms beneficial to plant development and protection and to highlight the capacity of microorganisms - bacteria and fungi - from forest soil to control phytopathogenic fungus in the complex, causing plant drop at tomatoes, which are frequently occurring in greenhouses and fields. Our research will continue in the direction of rigorous characterization of new wild strains of microorganisms isolated both at the genetic molecular level and of the mechanisms of action in the relationships of plant microorganisms and bioactive compounds secreted by these wild strains of microorganisms. Also, after characterizing the new microbial strains, we aim to obtain on their basis at laboratory and pilot scale growth stimulators and fungicides. For this we will carry out studies to optimize the conditions for growing microbial biomass, to obtain biologically active substances and to formulate ecological fungicides and growth stimulants for plants. After the crisis triggered by the SARS-CoV-2 virus will be overcome and we will be able to have access to the laboratory, we will start the experiments.","Ghiga, A.; Grebenisan, I.",Research Journal of Agricultural Science,,360

Cancer Patients suffering from SARS-CoV-2 have demonstrated higher rates of severe complications exacerbating towards death. Possible genetic and epigenetic alterations may exist in cancer patients which have the potential to contribute towards their increased vulnerability towards COVID-19. METHOD: An exhaustive literature search using 'COVID-19', 'SARS-CoV-2', 'Cancer', 'Malignancy', 'Relationships', Interlinks', 'Genetic', 'Epigenetic', 'Epidemiological studies', 'Clinical Studies', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccine scenario' were conducted in PubMed and EMBASE till 2nd June 2021. RESULT: In this narrative review, 17 epidemiological studies were listed which focused on clinical parameters of several malignancy patient cohorts who contracted COVID-19. Besides, genetic and epigenetic alterations seen among cancer patients are also discussed which may plausibly increase the vulnerability of cancer patients to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Also, global vaccination scenario among malignant patients along with the necessity to prioritize them in the vaccination campaigns are also elaborated. CONCLUSION: Genetic and epigenetic modifications present in ACE2, TMPRSS2, IL-6 and several cytokines require more in-depth research to elucidate the shared mechanisms of malignancy and SARS-CoV-2.","Sayed, Shomoita",Cancer Treat Res Commun,,360

At the peak of the crisis, consults for palliative care increased four- to sevenfold at NewYork-Presbyterian (NYP), an academic health care system with 10 campuses throughout New York City. We share our challenges, solutions, and lessons learned to help peer institutions meet increased palliative care demands during future crises and address pre-existing palliative care subspecialist shortages during nonpandemic times. Methods: In response to the increased demand, palliative care physician and administrative leadership at NYP piloted multiple creative care models to expand access to palliative care outpatient and inpatient services. The care models included virtual outpatient management of existing patients, embedded palliative care staff, education for providers, multidisciplinary family support, hospice units (which allowed for family visitation), and team expansion through training other disciplines (primarily psychiatry) and deploying an ePalliative Care service (staffed by out-of-state volunteers). Conclusion: Our comprehensive response successfully expanded the palliative care team's reach, and, at the height of the pandemic, allowed our teams to meet the increased demand for palliative care consults. We learned that flexibility and adaptability were critical to responding to a rapidly evolving crisis. Physician and family feedback and preliminary data suggest that virtual outpatient visits, embedded staff, hospice units, and team expansion through training other disciplines and deploying ePalliative Care services were impactful interventions.","Blinderman, Craig D; Adelman, Ronald; Kumaraiah, Deepa; Pan, Cynthia X; Palathra, Brigit C; Kaley, Kate; Trongone, Noelle; Spillane, Kristen",J. palliat. med,,360

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate ECG markers of sudden cardiac death on admission, including the index of cardiac electrophysiological balance (iCEB) (QTc/QRS) and transmural dispersion of repolarization (TDR) (T from peak to end (Tp-e) interval and Tp-e/QTc), in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 63 patients with newly diagnosed COVID-19 pneumonia who presented to the outpatient clinic or admitted to the respiratory care unit between August 20 and September 15, 2020. Forty-six persons matched for sex and age were selected from data collected before COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: QRS and QTc showed a significant prolongation in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia compared to the controls (87 vs. 78, p < .00, and 429 versus. 400, p < .00, respectively). After categorization of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia into 3 groups according to the severity of pneumonia as mild-moderate, severe, and critical groups, a decreased values of QRS were observed in the critical COVID-19 pneumonia group compared to severe and mild-moderate COVID-19 pneumonia groups (p = .04) while increased values of QTc and iCEB(QTc/QRS) were noted in critical COVID-19 pneumonia group compared to other 2 groups(p < .00).

524038,Managing COVID-19 Crisis using C(3)HIS Ontology,2021,"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), has rapidly spread leading to a global pandemic. Here, we combined multiple cross displacement amplification (MCDA) with CRISPR-Cas12a-based detection to develop a novel diagnostic test (MCCD) and applied for the diagnosis of COVID-19, called COVID-19 MCCD. The MCCD protocol conducts reverse transcription MCDA (RT-MCDA) reaction for RNA templates followed by CRISPR-Cas12a/CrRNA complex detection of predefined target sequences after which degradation of a single-strand DNA (ssDNA) molecule confirms detection of the target sequence. Two MCDA primer sets and two CrRNAs were designed targeting the opening reading frame 1a/b (ORF1ab) and nucleoprotein (N) of SARS-CoV-2. The optimal conditions include two RT-MCDA reactions at 63 °C for 35 min and a CRISPR-Cas12a/CrRNA detection reaction at 37 °C for 5 min. The COVID-19 MCCD assay can be visualized on a lateral flow biosensor (LFB) and completed within 1 h including RNA extraction (15 min), RT-MCDA reaction (35 min), CRISPR-Cas12a/CrRNA detection reaction (5 min), and reporting of result (within 2 min). The COVID-19 MCCD assay is very sensitive and detects the target gene with as low as seven copies per test and does not cross-react with non-SARS-CoV-2 templates. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 37 of 37 COVID-19 patient samples, and nonpositive results were detected from 77 non-COVID-19 patients. Therefore, the COVID-19 MCCD assay is a useful tool for the reliable and quick diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Zhu, Xiong; Wang, Xiaoxia; Li, Shijun; Luo, Wenkai; Zhang, Xinping; Wang, Chongzhen; Chen, Qian; Yu, Shuyi; Tai, Jun; Wang, Yi",ACS Sens,,360
591034,COVID-19 dynamics across the US: A deep learning study of human mobility and social behavior,2020-09-23,"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused the recent global COVID-19 outbreak, which led to a public health emergency. Entry of SARS-CoV-2 into human cells is dependent on the SARS-CoV receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, and cathepsin. Cathepsin degrades the spike protein (S protein), which results in the entry of viral nucleic acid into the human host cell. METHODS: We explored the susceptibility of the central nervous system (CNS) to SARS-CoV-2 infection using single-cell transcriptome analysis of glioblastoma. RESULTS: The results showed that ACE2 expression is relatively high in endothelial cells (ECs), bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs), and neural precursor cells (NPCs). Cathepsin B (Cat B) and cathepsin (Cat L) were also strongly expressed in various cell clusters within the glioblastoma microenvironment. Immunofluorescence staining of glioma and normal brain tissue chips further confirmed that ACE2 expression co-localized with CD31, CD73, and nestin, which confirmed the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 of nervous system cells, including ECs, BMSCs, and NPCs, from clinical specimens. CONCLUSIONS: These findings reveal the mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 neural invasion and suggest that special attention should be paid to SARS-CoV-2–infected patients with neural symptoms, especially those who suffered a glioma.","Wu, Bingshan; Wang, Weihong; Wang, Haopeng; Zou, Quanli; Hu, Benxia; Ye, Lei; Hu, Yangchun; Xie, Yuhuan; Huang, Nali; Lan, Qing; Cheng, Hongwei; Dong, Jun; Dai, Xingliang",Front Oncol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33312949/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2020.566599,360

Results show a significant increase of feelings of connectedness to the community after watching digital nature. Furthermore, tended nature scenes elicited more social aspirations than wild nature scenes. A multiple regression model further shows that living further away from nature was a significant predictor for loneliness scores, while number of nature interactions during a week was not. Results of this study confirm the importance of nature interaction for mental and social wellbeing for the general population and stress the potential of digital nature as a complementary strategy.

592195,Economic Policy Uncertainty Index Meets Ensemble Learning,2021-07-15,"Background: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, China implemented strict restrictions on cross-border travel to prevent disease importation. Yunnan, a Chinese province that borders dengue-endemic countries in Southeast Asia, experienced unprecedented reduction in dengue, from 6840 recorded cases in 2019 to 260 in 2020. Methods: Using a combination of epidemiological and virus genomic data, collected from 2013 to 2020 in Yunnan and neighbouring countries, we conduct a series of analyses to characterise the role of virus importation in driving dengue dynamics in Yunnan and assess the association between recent international travel restrictions and the decline in dengue reported in Yunnan in 2020. Findings: We find strong evidence that dengue incidence between 2013-2019 in Yunnan was closely linked with international importation of cases. A 0-2 month lag in incidence not explained by seasonal differences, absence of local transmission in the winter, effective reproductive numbers < 1 (as estimated independently using genetic data) and diverse cosmopolitan dengue virus phylogenies all suggest dengue is non-endemic in Yunnan. Using a multivariate statistical model we show that the substantial decline in dengue incidence observed in Yunnan in 2020 but not in neighbouring countries is closely associated with the timing of international travel restrictions, even after accounting for other environmental drivers of dengue incidence. Interpretation: We conclude that Yunnan is a regional sink for DENV lineage movement and that border restrictions may have substantially reduced dengue burden in 2020, potentially averting thousands of cases. Targeted testing and surveillance of travelers returning from high-risk areas could help to inform public health strategies to minimise or even eliminate dengue outbreaks in non-endemic settings like southern China.

Despite its growing evidence, there is a need to unravel the complex learning process in order to ensure high quality of interprofessional education delivery. AIM This study aimed to explore the experiences of healthcare students and facilitators on the use of 3DVW for interprofessional team-based virtual simulation. METHODS Interprofessional teams, each comprising six different healthcare students (Medicine, Nursing, Pharmacy, Physiotherapy, Occupational Therapy, and Medical Social Work) and two clinicians who acted as facilitators, logged into the 3DVW from their own remote locations to participate in team-based care delivery that included an interprofessional bedside round and a family conference. A qualitative descriptive study was conducted on a purposive sample of 30 healthcare students and 12 facilitators using focus group discussions and individual interviews. RESULTS Four themes emerged from their experiences: the ""wow experience"", authentic experience on collaborative care, ease of learning, and preeminent role of the facilitator. The simulation provided the ""wow"" experiences through contextual, collaborative and experiential learning approaches. Despite technical challenges, the participants were wooed by the comforts of learning from home and the psychological safety in virtual environment. The facilitators played a critical role in optimizing learning engagement to win learners over. CONCLUSION Our study explicates how attention to the ""wow, woo and win"" trilateral factors can transform the interprofessional learning experiences offered by 3DVW simulation. Future developments in the use of this learning technology should include developing the clinicians' facilitation skills and the provision of technical support to make this 3DVW a success calls in winning students' learning engagement.","Liaw, Sok Ying; Choo, Tingwei; Wu, Ling Ting; Lim, Wee Shiong; Choo, Hyekyung; Lim, Sok Mui; Ringsted, Charlotte; Wong, Lai Fun; Ooi, Sim Leng; Lau, Tang Ching",Nurse education today,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nedt.2021.105018; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34175564/,360

In Belgium, by the end of August, 93% of deaths due to COVID-19 were aged 65 or older. Similar trends were observed in other countries. As a consequence, older adults were identified as a group at risk, and strict governmental restrictions were imposed on them. This has caused concerns about their mental health. Using an online survey, this study established the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on adults aged 65 years or older, and which factors moderate this impact. Participants reported a significant decrease in activity level, sleep quality and wellbeing during the COVID-19 pandemic. Depression was strongly related to reported declines in activity level, sleep quality, wellbeing and cognitive functioning. Our study shows that the COVID-19 pandemic had a severe impact on the mental health of older adults.

In Ireland, the first NH case COVID-19 occurred on 16/03/2020. A national point-prevalence testing program of all NH residents and staff took place (18/04/2020–05/05/2020). AIMS: To examine characteristics of NHs across three Irish Community Health Organisations (CHOs), proportions with COVID-19 outbreaks, staff and resident infection rates symptom-profile, and resident case-fatality. METHODS: Forty-five NHs surveyed requesting details on occupancy, size, COVID-19 outbreak, outbreak timing, total symptomatic/asymptomatic cases, and outcomes for residents from 29/02/2020–22/05/2020. RESULTS: Surveys were returned from 62.2% (28/45) of NHs (2043 residents, 2,303 beds). Three-quarters (21/28) had COVID-19 outbreaks (1741 residents, 1972 beds). Median time from first COVID-19 case in Ireland to first case in these NHs was 27.0 days. Resident incidence was 43.9% (764/1741): 40.8% (710/1741) laboratory-confirmed, with 27.2% (193/710) asymptomatic, and 3.1% (54/1741) clinically-suspected. Resident case-fatality was 27.6% (211/764) for combined laboratory-confirmed/clinically-suspected COVID-19. Similar proportions of residents in NHs with “early-stage” (<28 days) versus “later-stage” outbreaks developed COVID-19. Lower proportions of residents in “early” outbreak NHs had recovered compared to those with “late” outbreaks (37.4% vs 61.7%; χ(2) = 56.9, P < 0.001). Of 395 NH staff across twelve sites with confirmed COVID-19, 24.7% (99/398) were asymptomatic. There was a significant correlation between the proportion of staff with symptomatic COVID-19 and resident numbers with confirmed/suspected COVID-19 (Spearman’s rho = 0.81, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the significant impact of COVID-19 on the NH sector. Systematic point-prevalence testing is necessary to reduce risk of transmission from asymptomatic carriers and manage outbreaks in this setting.","Kennelly, Sean P; Dyer, Adam H; Noonan, Claire; Martin, Ruth; Kennelly, Siobhan M; Martin, Alan; O’Neill, Desmond; Fallon, Aoife",Age Ageing,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32986806/; https://doi.org/10.1093/ageing/afaa220,360

The hypothesis of SARS-CoV-2 triggering autoimmunity is gaining attention and, in the present study, we have identified 28 human proteins harbouring regions homologous to SARS-CoV-2 peptides that could possibly be acting as autoantigens in COVID-19 patients displaying autoimmune conditions. Interestingly, these conserved regions are amongst the experimentally validated B cell epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 proteins. The reported human proteins have demonstrated presence of autoantibodies against them in typical autoimmune conditions which may explain the frequent occurrence of autoimmune conditions following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, the proposed autoantigens’ widespread tissue distribution is suggestive of their involvement in multi-organ manifestations via molecular mimicry.

Here, soluble prefusion-stabilized spike trimers (preS dTM) from the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) were formulated with the adjuvant AS03 and administered twice to nonhuman primates (NHP). Binding and functional neutralization assays and systems serology revealed that NHP developed AS03-dependent multi-functional humoral responses that targeted multiple spike domains and bound to a variety of antibody F(C) receptors mediating effector functions in vitro. Pseudovirus and live virus neutralizing IC(50) titers were on average greater than 1000 and significantly higher than a panel of human convalescent sera. NHP were challenged intranasally and intratracheally with a high dose (3×10(6) PFU) of SARS-CoV-2 (USA-WA1/2020 isolate). Two days post-challenge, vaccinated NHP showed rapid control of viral replication in both the upper and lower airways.

Moreover, vaccine-induced IgG mediated protection from SARS-CoV-2 challenge following passive transfer to hamsters. These data show that antibodies induced by the AS03-adjuvanted preS dTM vaccine are sufficient to mediate protection against SARS-CoV-2 and support the evaluation of this vaccine in human clinical trials.","Francica, Joseph R.; Flynn, Barbara J.; Foulds, Kathryn E.; Noe, Amy T.; Werner, Anne P.; Moore, Ian N.; Gagne, Matthew; Johnston, Timothy S.; Tucker, Courtney; Davis, Rachel L.; Flach, Britta; O’Connell, Sarah; Andrew, Shayne F.; Lamb, Evan; Flebbe, Dillon R.; Nurmukhambetova, Saule T.; Donaldson, Mitzi M.; Todd, John-Paul M.; Zhu, Alex Lee; Atyeo, Caroline; Fischinger, Stephanie; Gorman, Matthew J; Shin, Sally; Edara, Venkata Viswanadh; Floyd, Katharine; Lai, Lilin; Tylor, Alida; McCarthy, Elizabeth; Lecouturier, Valerie; Ruiz, Sophie; Berry, Catherine; Tibbitts, Timothy; Andersen, Hanne; Cook, Anthony; Dodson, Alan; Pessaint, Laurent; Ry, Alex Van; Koutsoukos, Marguerite; Gutzeit, Cindy; Teng, I-Ting; Zhou, Tongqing; Li, Dapeng; Haynes, Barton F.; Kwong, Peter D.; McDermott, Adrian; Lewis, Mark G.; Fu, Tong Ming; Chicz, Roman; van der Most, Robbert; Corbett, Kizzmekia S.; Suthar, Mehul S.; Alter, Galit; Roederer, Mario; Sullivan, Nancy J.; Douek, Daniel C.; Graham, Barney S.; Casimiro, Danilo; Seder, Robert A.",bioRxiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33688652/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.02.433390,360

METHODS: Parent satisfaction was longitudinally evaluated through questionnaires. The survey was developed with Google Questionnaire forms and sent via WhatsApp. The questionnaire consisted of 13 items concerning the management of KDTs using telemedicine in the context of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Our population of patients has limited financial resources and low levels of education. Given that many families did not have either computers or WIFI, or any other access to information or communication technology, WhatsApp was chosen as a tool as it was available on the cell phones of all families and the professionals. RESULTS: Our survey showed that 96.3% of the parents were satisfied with the management of KDTs through telemedicine. The main benefits observed were the possibility of continuing treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic and the ease of accessing the professional team from the comfort of their home. Overall, 72.2% of the families would recommend using telemedicine for KDTs in any situation regardless of the pandemic. None of the families reported that they would recommend against treatment by telemedicine. The availability of a social support network (parents WhatsApp group) coordinated by professionals from the KDT team was considered to be useful by most respondents (90%). CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that management of children with DRE on KDTs through telemedicine is feasible, well accepted by the families, and probably as safe as conventional medicine. WhatsApp may be an interesting telemedicine tool to start and maintain KDTs.","Semprino, Marcos; Fasulo, Lorena; Fortini, Sebastian; Martorell Molina, Catalina Isabel; González, Lara; Ramos, Paola Alejandra; Martínez, Carolina; Caraballo, Roberto",Epilepsy Behav,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yebeh.2020.107493; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1525505020306739; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33181913/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1525505020306739,360

However, there is a lack of longitudinal research investigating whether financial instability and social disruption may increase the risk of developing mental health problems over time that may potentially outlast the pandemic. Methods: We conducted an online survey for members of the general population (n = 2703) in Germany during the twelve months spanning from April 2020 to March 2021. We investigated the development of COVID-19 related psychological distress, the number of unemployed people, federal government debt, income distribution, and loneliness over the time period. Results: Over a period of twelve months, 53.6% of respondents in Germany reported experiencing psychological distress, varying from mild levels, 34.2%, to severe levels, 19.4%, of distress. High federal government debt, high incident COVID-19 cases, low incomes, and the prevalence of loneliness were found to be associated with increased long-term mental health problems. Psychological distress scores were most strongly increased in female and young respondents as well as those who reported fewer years of education, low income, and higher loneliness. Conclusions: Our study highlights factors that have a long-term impact on mental health amid the COVID-19 pandemic. We suggest that specific mental-health services could be offered to support high-risk groups experiencing financial fragility and loneliness. For purposes of safeguarding their mental health there is a need to monitor and track such risk factors in real time.","Liu, Shuyan; Haucke, Matthias N.; Heinzel, Stephan; Heinz, Andreas",J Clin Med,https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10194596; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34640614/,360

However, the existing computational predictors only focus on the protein pairwise similarity or the similarity between two groups of proteins from 2-folds. However, the homology relationship among proteins is in a hierarchical structure. The global protein similarity network will contribute to the performance improvement. In this study, we proposed a predictor called FoldRec-C2C to globally incorporate the interactions among proteins into the prediction. For the FoldRec-C2C predictor, protein fold recognition problem is treated as an information retrieval task in nature language processing. The initial ranking results were generated by a surprised ranking algorithm Learning to Rank, and then three re-ranking algorithms were performed on the ranking lists to adjust the results globally based on the protein similarity network, including seq-to-seq model, seq-to-cluster model and cluster-to-cluster model (C2C).

The outbreak of virus infection has aroused great concern of the World Health Organization (WHO). COVID-19 is highly infectious and has a high infection rate. So far, no specific drug has been found to cure it. China as one of the first countries attacked by epidemic has shown outstanding in fighting against the COVID-19. The contribution of traditional Chinese medicine can not be ignored. As a kind of representative of traditional Chinese medicine, the Chinese patent medicine injection has significant effect in reducing the clinical symptoms of patients and preventing the deterioration of the disease. However, there is no systematic review of its efficacy and safety. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Chinese patent medicine injection in the treatment of COVID-19. METHODS: All randomized controlled trials of Chinese patent medicine injection for COVID-19 will be included. The following electronic databases will be searched: PubMed, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, EMBASE, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Database, Chinese Scientific Journal Database, Chinese Biomedical Literature database and some clinical trial registration websites. Two researchers will independently screen titles, abstracts, full texts, and extract data, then assess the bias risk of each study.

AIM: To describe the spatiotemporal distributions of SARS-CoV-2 infections among HCWs in Wuhan, China. METHODS: In this study, an open-source dataset of HCW diagnoses was provided. A geographical detector technique was then used to investigate the impacts of hospital level, type, distance from the infection source, and other external indicators of HCW infections. FINDINGS: The number of daily HCW infections over time in Wuhan followed a log-normal distribution, with its mean observed on January 23(rd), 2020, and a standard deviation of 10.8 days. The implementation of high-impact measures, such as the lockdown of the city, may have increased the probability of HCW infections in the short term, especially for those in the outer ring of Wuhan. The infection of HCWs in Wuhan exhibited clear spatial heterogeneity. The number of HCW infections was higher in the central city and lower in the outer city. CONCLUSION: HCW infections displayed significant spatial autocorrelation and dependence. Factor analysis revealed that hospital level and type had an even greater impact on HCW infections; third-class and general hospitals closer to infection sources were correlated with especially high risks of infection.","Wang, P.; Ren, H.; Zhu, X.; Fu, X.; Liu, H.; Hu, T.",J Hosp Infect,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33561504/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhin.2021.02.002; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0195670121000463; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195670121000463,360

601704,The Case for Effective Risk Communication: Lessons from a Global Pandemic,2020-08-27,"The mechanistic (or mammalian) target of rapamycin (mTOR) is considered as a critical regulatory enzyme involved in essential signaling pathways affecting cell growth, cell proliferation, protein translation, regulation of cellular metabolism, and cytoskeletal structure. Also, mTOR signaling has crucial roles in cell homeostasis via processes such as autophagy. Autophagy prevents many pathogen infections and is involved on immunosurveillance and pathogenesis. Immune responses and autophagy are therefore key host responses and both are linked by complex mTOR regulatory mechanisms. In recent years, the mTOR pathway has been highlighted in different diseases such as diabetes, cancer, and infectious and parasitic diseases including leishmaniasis, toxoplasmosis, and malaria. The current review underlines the implications of mTOR signals and intricate networks on pathogen infections and the modulation of this master regulator by parasites. Parasitic infections are able to induce dynamic metabolic reprogramming leading to mTOR alterations in spite of many other ways impacting this regulatory network. Accordingly, the identification of parasite effects and interactions over such a complex modulation might reveal novel information regarding the biology of the abovementioned parasites and might allow the development of therapeutic strategies against parasitic diseases. In this sense, the effects of inhibiting the mTOR pathways are also considered in this context in the light of their potential for the prevention and treatment of parasitic diseases.","Rashidi, Sajad; Mansouri, Reza; Ali-Hassanzadeh, Mohammad; Mojtahedi, Zahra; Shafiei, Reza; Savardashtaki, Amir; Hamidizadeh, Nasrin; Karimazar, Mohammadreza; Nguewa, Paul; Manzano-Román, Raúl",Parasitol Res,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00436-021-07070-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33534053/,360

Different approaches are followed to mitigate its impact and reduce its spreading in different countries, but limiting mobility and exposure have been de-facto precaution to reduce transmission. However, a full lockdown cannot be sustained for a prolonged period. Evidence-based, multidisciplinary approach on risk zoning, personal and transmission risk assessment on a near real-time, and risk communication would support the optimized decisions to minimize the impact of coronavirus on our lives. This paper presents a framework to assess the individual and regional risk of COVID-19 along with risk communication tools and mechanisms. Relative risk scores on a scale of 100 represent the integrated risk of influential factors. The personal risk model incorporates: age, exposure history, symptoms, local risk and existing health condition, whereas regional risk is computed through the actual cases of COVID-19, public health risk factors, socioeconomic condition of the region, and immigration statistics. A web application tool (www.covira.info) has been developed, where anyone can assess their risk and find the guided information links primarily for Nepal.

603558,International entrepreneurship in the post Covid world,2020-09-14,"STAT1 belongs to the STAT family of transcription factors, which comprises seven factors: STAT1, STAT2, STAT3, STAT4, STAT5A, STAT5B and STAT6. STAT1 is a 91 kDa protein originally identified as the mediator of the cellular response to interferon (IFN) α, and thereafter found to be a major component of the cellular response to IFNγ. STAT1 is, in fact, involved in the response to several cytokines and to growth factors. It is activated by cytokine receptors via kinases of the JAK family. STAT1 becomes phosphorylated and forms a dimer which enters the nucleus and triggers the transcription of its targets. Although not lethal at birth, selective gene deletion of STAT1 in mice leads to rapid death from severe infections, demonstrating its major role in the response to pathogens. Similarly, in humans who do not express STAT1, there is a lack of resistance to pathogens leading to premature death. This indicates a key, non-redundant function of STAT1 in the defence against pathogens. Thus, to successfully infect organisms, bacterial, viral or parasitic pathogens must overcome the activity of STAT1, and almost all the steps of this pathway can be blocked or inhibited by proteins produced in infected cells. Interestingly, some pathogens, like the oncogenic Epstein–Barr virus, have evolved a strategy which uses STAT1 activation.","Najjar, Imen; Fagard, Remi",Biochimie,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0300908410000532; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20159032/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biochi.2010.02.009; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0300908410000532,360

Most documented “superspreading events” of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) occurred in hospitals, but the underlying causes remain unclear. We systematically analyzed the risk factors for nosocomial outbreaks of SARS among hospital wards in Guangzhou and Hong Kong, China. Methods. A case-control study was conducted. Case wards were hospital wards in which superspreading events of SARS occurred, and control wards were wards in which patients with SARS were admitted, but no subsequent nosocomial outbreaks occurred. Information on environmental and administrative factors was obtained through visits to the wards and interviews with ward managers or nursing officers. Relevant information about host factors was abstracted from the medical records. Logistic regression analyses were used to identify the major risk factors for superspreading events. Results. Eighty-six wards in 21 hospitals in Guangzhou and 38 wards in 5 hospitals in Hong Kong were included in the study. Six risk factors were significant in the final multiple-logistic regression model: minimum distance between beds of ≤1 m (odds ratio [OR], 6.94; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.68–28.75), availability of washing or changing facilities for staff (OR, 0.12; 95% CI, 0.02–0.97), whether resuscitation was ever performed in the ward (OR, 3.81; 95% CI, 1.04–13.87), whether staff members worked while experiencing symptoms (OR, 10.55; 95% CI, 2.28–48.87), whether any host patients (index patient or the first patient with SARS admitted to a ward) required oxygen therapy (OR, 4.30; 95% CI, 1.00–18.43), and whether any host patients required bi-level positive airway pressure ventilation (OR, 11.82; 95% CI, 1.97–70.80).

This is important in resource-limited countries. This study determined the knowledge and perception regarding COVID-19; adherence to COVID-19 preventive measures; as well as predictors of self-perceived risk of contracting COVID-19 among Nigerian adults. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among Nigerian adults ≥18 years using an online survey. A convenience sampling method was utilized to recruit a total of 1022 study participants. The participants were recruited using the authors’ social media networks. Data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics at a 5% level of statistical significance. RESULTS: Generally, a high proportion of respondents had correct knowledge about COVID-19. However, only approximately half (49.8% and 49.9%) had correct knowledge that obesity was a risk factor for COVID-19 and that antibiotics cannot be used to treat COVID-19. Most (84.1%) did not have a self-perceived risk of contracting COVID-19. Most (81.0%) have been avoiding crowded places and 61.3% washed their hands frequently.

To undertake basic research and therapeutic development, many of these viruses require handling by highly trained staff in BSL-3/4 facilities not readily available to the majority of the global R&D community. In order to circumvent the enhanced biosafety requirement, the development of non-pathogenic, replication-defective pseudotyped viruses is an effective and established solution to permit the study of many aspects of virus biology in a low containment biosafety level (BSL)-1/2 laboratory. Under the spectre of the unfolding Ebola crisis, this timely conference (the second to be organised by the Viral Pseudotype Unit, www.viralpseudotypeunit.info*) discusses the recent advances in pseudotype technology and how it is revolutionizing the study of important human and animal pathogens (human and avian influenza viruses, rabies/lyssaviruses, HIV, Marburg and Ebola viruses). Key topics addressed in this conference include the exploitation of pseudotypes for serology and serosurveillance, immunogenicity testing of current and next-generation vaccines and new pseudotype assay formats (multiplexing, kit development). *The first pseudotype-focused Euroscicon conference organised by the Viral Pseudotype Unit was recently reviewed [1].","Bentley, Emma M.; Mather, Stuart T.; Temperton, Nigel J.",Vaccine,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X15005472; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25936665/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X15005472; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2015.04.071,360
610599,Food shopping and food hygiene related knowledge and practices during the COVID-19 pandemic: The case of a developing country,2021-07-26,"BACKGROUND: Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) continues to be reported from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Data on the phenomenon of intermittent positive results for MERS-CoV on reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with negative results in between are lacking. Here we describe cases with intermittent positive MERS-CoV test results and highlight the required number of tests to rule out or rule in MERS-CoV infection based on a large retrospective cohort of patients with confirmed MERS-CoV. METHODS: This analysis included cases admitted between January 2014 and December 2017. The included patients had a minimum of 3 nasopharyngeal MERS-CoV RT-PCR tests for confirmation and needed 2 negative samples for MERS-CoV evaluated 48 hours apart with clinical improvement or stabilization apart to ensure clearance. RESULTS: A total of 408 patients with positive MERS-CoV test results were treated at the referring hospital. We excluded 72 patients who had only 1 swab result available in the system and were treated in the initial years of the disease. Of the remaining 336 patients, 300 (89%) had a positive result after 1 swab, 324 (96.5%) had a positive result after 2 consecutive swabs, and 328 (97.6%) had a positive result after 3 consecutive swabs. Of the total cases, 46 (13.7%) had a positive MERS-CoV test then a negative test, followed by positive test results. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that 2 to 3 nasopharyngeal samples are needed to produce the highest yield of positive results for MERS-CoV. In addition, 2 negative results 48 hours apart with clinical improvement or stabilization are needed to clear patients from MERS-CoV. Evaluation of the yield of sputum samples is needed to assess the effectiveness against nasopharyngeal swabs.","Alfaraj, Sarah H.; Al-Tawfiq, Jaffar A.; Memish, Ziad A.",Am J Infect Control,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30352694/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S019665531830871X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S019665531830871X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2018.08.020,360
612181,Machine Learning Maps Research Needs in COVID-19 Literature,2020-06-12,"BACKGROUND: There is emerging evidence that patients with Latent Tuberculosis Infection(LTBI) and Tuberculosis(TB) disease have an increased risk of the SARS-CoV-2 infection and predisposition towards developing severe COVID-19 pneumonia. In this study we attempted to estimate the number of TB patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and have severe disease during the COVID-19 epidemic in Delhi, India. METHODS: Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model was used to estimate the number of COVID-19 cases in Delhi. Assuming the prevalence of TB in Delhi to be 0.55%, 53% of SARS-CoV2 infected TB cases to present with severe disease we estimated the number of SARS-CoV2 infected TB cases and the number of severe patients. The modelling used estimated R(0) for two scenarios, without any intervention and with public health interventions. RESULTS: We observed that the peak of SARS-CoV-2-TB co-infected patients would occur on the 94th day in absence of public health interventions and on 138(th) day in presence of interventions. There could be 20,880 SARS-CoV-2 infected TB cases on peak day of epidemic when interventions are implemented and 27,968 cases in the absence of intervention. Among them, there could be 14,823 patients with severe disease when no interventions are implemented and 11,066 patients with severe disease in the presence of intervention. CONCLUSION: The importance of primary prevention measures needs to be emphasized especially in TB patients. The TB treatment centres and hospitals needs to be prepared for early diagnosis and management of severe COVID-19 in TB patients.","Marimuthu, Yamini; Nagappa, Bharathnag; Sharma, Nandini; Basu, Saurav; Kishore Chopra, Kamal",Indian J Tuberc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32553309/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijtb.2020.05.006; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0019570720300470; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019570720300470?v=s5,360

Since its early recognition pathologically in the 1960s and endoscopically in the 1990s, AEN, despite its rarity, is being increasingly recognized as a demonstratable cause of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Cases of pan-esophageal necrosis are sparsely reported, leaving management guidance to isolated case reports. CASE REPORT: An 80-year-old female smoker with advanced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease presented with signs and symptoms of acute pharyngitis and globus sensation that had been evolving over the preceding weeks. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed circumferential necrotic mucosa encircling the entire lumen of the esophagus. The patient was made nil-per-os and started on high-dose anti-reflux therapy with adequate hemo-dynamic resuscitation. CONCLUSIONS: AEN is multifactorial but primarily a combination of decreased tissue perfusion and a massive influx of gastric contents in settings of impaired local defense barriers. Despite its dramatic presentation, the majority of cases resolve with conservative medical management, foregoing surgical interventions.","Deliwala, Smit S.; Bala, Areeg; Haykal, Tarek; Elbedawi, Mamoon M.; Bachuwa, Ghassan; Gurvits, Grigoriy E.",Am J Case Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32881843/; https://doi.org/10.12659/ajcr.926019,360

Conventional technologies have several drawbacks (i.e., cross-infection risk, filtration efficiency improvements limited by difficulty in breathing, and no safe reusability), which have yet to be addressed in a single device. Here, we report the development of a filter overcoming the major technical challenges of respiratory protective devices. Large-pore membranes, offering high breathability but low bacteria capture, were functionalized to have a uniform salt layer on the fibers. The salt-functionalized membranes achieved high filtration efficiency as opposed to the bare membrane, with differences of up to 48%, while maintaining high breathability (> 60% increase compared to commercial surgical masks even for the thickest salt filters tested). The salt-functionalized filters quickly killed Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria aerosols in vitro, with CFU reductions observed as early as within 5 min, and in vivo by causing structural damage due to salt recrystallization. The salt coatings retained the pathogen inactivation capability at harsh environmental conditions (37 °C and a relative humidity of 70%, 80% and 90%). Combination of these properties in one filter will lead to the production of an effective device, comprehensibly mitigating infection transmission globally.","Rubino, Ilaria; Oh, Euna; Han, Sumin; Kaleem, Sana; Hornig, Alex; Lee, Su-Hwa; Kang, Hae-Ji; Lee, Dong-Hun; Chu, Ki-Back; Kumaran, Surjith; Armstrong, Sarah; Lalani, Romani; Choudhry, Shivanjali; Kim, Chun Il; Quan, Fu-Shi; Jeon, Byeonghwa; Choi, Hyo-Jick",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32807805/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-70623-9,360

First infections were reported in Germany by the end of January and on March 16th the federal government announced a partial lockdown in order to mitigate the spread. Since the dynamics of new infections started to slow down, German states started to relax the confinement measures as to the beginning of May. As a fall back option, a limit of 50 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants within seven days was introduced for each city or district in Germany. If a district exceeds this limit, measures to control the spread of the virus should be taken. Based on a multi--patch SEAIRD--type model, we will simulate the effect of choosing a specific upper limit for new infections. We investigate, whether the politically motivated bound is low enough to detect new outbreaks at an early stage. Subsequently, we introduce an optimal control problem to tackle the multi--criteria problem of finding a bound for new infections that is low enough to avoid new outbreaks, which might lead to an overload of the health care system, but is large enough to curb the expected economic losses.","Bock, W.; Goetz, T.; Jayathunga, Y.; Rockenfeller, R.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.16.20155036; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.07.16.20155036v1?rss=1,360

Objective: to assess CV traditional risk factors and global CV risk profile of Italian medical students throughout the six years of university. Methods: A cross-sectional survey accessible online via quick response (QR) code was conducted among 2700 medical students at the University of Milan, Italy. Data on baseline characteristics, traditional CV risk factors, diet, lifestyle habits, and perceived lifestyle variations were evaluated across different years of school. Results: Overall, 1183 students (mean age, 22.05 years; 729 women (61.6%)) out of 2700 completed the questionnaire (43.8% rate response). More than 16% of the students had at least 3 out of 12 CV risk factors and only 4.6% had ideal cardiovascular health as defined by the American Heart Association. Overweight, underweight, physical inactivity, sub-optimal diet, smoke history, and elevated stress were commonly reported. Awareness of own blood pressure and lipid profile increased over the academic years as well as the number of high-blood-pressure subjects, alcohol abusers, and students constantly stressed for university reasons. Moreover, a reduction in physical-activity levels over the years was reported by half of the students. Conclusion and Relevance: This study demonstrates that a “protected” population as that of young medical students can show an unsatisfactory cardiovascular risk profile and suggests that medical school itself, being demanding and stressful, may have a role in worsening of the lifestyle.","Faggiano, Andrea; Bursi, Francesca; Santangelo, Gloria; Tomasi, Cesare; Sforza, Chiarella; Faggiano, Pompilio; Carugo, Stefano",J Clin Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33805103/; https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10071343,360

Receptor binding and sialic acid cleavage by recombinant proteins correlate satisfactorily compared to whole viruses. Expression of HA and NA can be achieved in a plethora of different laboratory hosts. For immunological and receptor interaction studies however, insect and mammalian cell expressed proteins are preferred due to the presence of N‐linked glycosylation and disulfide bond formation. Because mammalian‐cell expression is widely applied, an increased expression yield is an important goal. Here we report that using codon‐optimized genes and sfGFP fusions, the expression yield of HA can be significantly improved. sfGFP also significantly increased expression yields when fused to the N‐terminus of NA. In this study, a suite of different hemagglutinin and neuraminidase constructs are described, which can be valuable tools to study a wide array of different HAs, NAs and their mutants.","van der Woude, Roosmarijn; Turner, Hannah L.; Tomris, Ilhan; Bouwman, Kim M.; Ward, Andrew B.; de Vries, Robert P.",Protein Sci,https://doi.org/10.1002/pro.3918; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32710576/,360

The objective of this study was to measure anxiety levels among cancer patient during COVID-19 pandemic and the associated factors including patients’ conditions of lockdown. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among adult cancer patients (hematological and solid tumors) receiving outpatient treatment or during follow-up in a French Comprehensive Cancer Centre. A postal self-administered questionnaire was sent to 4000 patients in June 2020, including Anxiety (Stait Trait), Fear of a cancer recurrence (FCR) as well as questions relative to socio-demographics, management of cancer care during the pandemic and the conditions of lockdown. Results: A total of 1097 patients completed the questionnaire (63.2% female;mean age 64.7 years ±12.3 years, 24.3% haematological cancers). Mean IES-R score was 15.7 ([0-81]) and 14.7% of patients had moderate or severe post-traumatic stress (score ≥33). Mean anxiety score was 39.0 (SD=13.6, range: [20-80]) with 30.5% of patients having anxiety symptoms. In the multivariate analysis we found that anxiety level was significantly increased for younger patients (OR=1.69, 95%IC [1.01-2.82]), female (OR=1.65, 95%IC [1.05-2.59]), patients with a high FCR score (OR=4.90, 95%IC [2.84-8.44]), patients unsatisfied with the current management of their cancer (OR=2.4, 95%IC [1.58-3.66]) and patients afraid of coming to hospital for fear of COVID (OR=2.10, 95%IC [1.32-3.35]). Protective factors against anxiety were staying busy during the lockdown period (OR=0.46, 95%IC [0.30-0.72]) and seeing the positive aspects of lockdown (OR=0.43, 95%IC [0.28-0.66]). Conclusions: These results contribute to a better understanding of the psychological consequences of COVID-19 pandemic in the context of cancer and highlight the need to better support patients at high risk of developing high anxiety levels.

Based on single-cell transcriptomes of nasopharyngeal and bronchial samples from clinically well-characterized patients presenting with moderate and critical severities, we reveal the different types and states of airway epithelial cells that are vulnerable for SARS-CoV-2 infection. In COVID-19 patients, we observed a two- to threefold increase of cells expressing the SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor ACE2 within the airway epithelial cell compartment. ACE2 is upregulated in epithelial cells through Interferon signals by immune cells suggesting that the viral defense system may increase the number of potentially susceptible cells in the respiratory epithelium. Infected epithelial cells recruit and activate immune cells by chemokine signaling. Recruited T lymphocytes and inflammatory macrophages were hyperactivated and showed a strong interaction with epithelial cells. In critical patients, increased expression of CCL2, CCL3, CCL5, CXCL9, CXCL10, IL8, IL1B and TNF in macrophages was identified as a likely cause of a hyperinflammatory lung pathology. Moreover, we observed exacerbated epithelial cell death, likely leading to lung injury and respiratory failure in fatal cases.

621962,Disaster and emergency management systems in urban areas,2011-12-21,"Introduction: Endoparasites in captive wildlife might pose a threat to public health; however, very few studies have been conducted on this issue, and much remains to be learned, especially in limited-resource settings. This study aimed to investigate endoparasites of captive wildlife in Bangladesh. Perception and understanding of veterinarians regarding one health and zoonoses were also assessed. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted from October 2019 to August 2020. A total of 45 fecal samples from 18 different species of wild animals (i.e., 11 species of mammals: herbivores, carnivores, and omnivores, six birds, and a single reptile species) were collected randomly. Parasitological assessments were done by modified formalin ether sedimentation technique and rechecked by Sheather’s sugar floatation technique. Molecular identification of Spirometra spp. was conducted by amplifying the cytochrome c oxidase 1 (cox1) gene. Questionnaire surveys among 15 veterinarians and an in-depth interview (IDI) with a zoo officer were conducted. Results: Helminths (Spirometra sp., Capillaria sp., Ascaridia/Heterakis, opisthorchiid, strongyles, acuariid, hookworms, roundworms, and unidentified nematode larvae) and protozoa (coccidian oocyst) were identified, and the overall prevalence was 48.9% (22/45). The cox1 sequences (341 bp) of the Bangladesh-origin Spirometra species from lion showed 99.3–99.7% similarity to the reference sequences of Spirometra decipiens (GenBank No: KJ599679.1; MT122766). The majority of study participants (86.6%) agreed about the importance of endoparasite control in zoo animals, and 73.3% expressed that the one health concept should be promoted in Bangladesh. Only 6.7% of veterinarians perceived confidence in diagnosing parasitic diseases and preventing antiparasiticidal resistance. Conclusions: In the present survey, we found a considerable prevalence of endoparasites in captive wildlife. For the first time, zoonotically important S. decipiens from lion was molecularly characterized in Bangladesh. Veterinarian training is required to improve parasite control knowledge and practice. This study highlights the need for routine parasitological assessment, promotion of one health, and improvement of the implementation of current parasite control strategies in zoo animals.","Nath, Tilak Chandra; Eom, Keeseon S.; Choe, Seongjun; Hm, Shahadat; Islam, Saiful; Ndosi, Barakaeli Abdieli; Kang, Yeseul; Bia, Mohammed Mebarek; Kim, Sunmin; Eamudomkarn, Chatanun; Jeon, Hyeong-Kyu; Park, Hansol; Lee, Dongmin",Pathogens,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33672404/; https://doi.org/10.3390/pathogens10020250,360

This study aimed to test and compare the efficacy of various makes of locally made or homemade cloth face masks obtained from face-mask vendors in Kampala, Uganda, during the COVID-19 pandemic. The testing was performed to assess the bacterial filtration efficiency (BFE), breathability, distance-dependent fitness, and reusability of the locally made or homemade cloth face masks, while considering the most commonly used non-published face-mask decontamination approaches in Uganda. During laboratory experimentation, modified protocols from various face-mask testing organizations were adopted. Ten different face-mask types were experimented upon; each face-mask type was tested four times for every single test, except for the decontamination protocols involving washing where KN95 and surgical face masks were not included. Among the locally made or homemade cloth face masks, the double-layered cloth face masks (described as F) had better BFE and distance-dependent fitness characteristics, they could be reused, and had good breathability, than the other locally made or homemade cloth face masks. Despite these good qualities, the certainty of these face masks protecting wearers against COVID-19 remains subject to viral filtration efficiency testing.","Mboowa, Gerald; Semugenze, Derrick; Nakabuye, Hellen; Bulafu, Douglas; Aruhomukama, Dickson",Am J Trop Med Hyg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33724922/; https://doi.org/10.4269/ajtmh.21-0030,360

Multivariable regressions were used to assess sociodemographic and clinical factors associated with increased odds of hospitalization among patients with confirmed COVID-19 between March 18, 2020 through April 25, 2020 at a community-based outpatient clinic in Massachusetts. Older age, BMI ≥ 25, self-reported dizziness/lightheadedness, temperature ≥ 99.5°F, tachycardia, and oxygen saturation < 95% were associated with increased odds of hospitalization after adjustment for age, sex, and BMI. There was also an association between speaking Spanish as primary language and increased odds of hospitalization (compared to English, adjusted OR = 2.99 [95% CI 1.39, 6.39]). Speaking Portuguese as primary language was not associated with increased odds of hospitalization (compared to English, adjusted OR = 1.83 [0.78, 4.28]).

DESIGN: Retrospective case series SETTING: Three designated COVID-19 care hospitals of the Union Hospital of Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan, China. PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred fourteen hospitalized patients with laboratory confirmed diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome from coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Data were collected from 16 January 2020 to 19 February 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical data were extracted from electronic medical records and reviewed by a trained team of physicians. Neurological symptoms fall into three categories: central nervous system (CNS) symptoms or diseases (headache, dizziness, impaired consciousness, ataxia, acute cerebrovascular disease, and epilepsy), peripheral nervous system (PNS) symptoms (hypogeusia, hyposmia, hypopsia, and neuralgia), and skeletal muscular symptoms. Data of all neurological symptoms were checked by two trained neurologists. RESULTS: Of 214 patients studied, 88 (41.1%) were severe and 126 (58.9%) were non-severe patients. Compared with non-severe patients, severe patients were older (58.7 ± 15.0 years vs 48.9 ± 14.7 years), had more underlying disorders (42 [47.7%] vs 41 [32.5%]), especially hypertension (32 [36.4%] vs 19 [15.1%]), and showed less typical symptoms such as fever (40 [45.5%] vs 92 [73%]) and cough (30 [34.1%] vs 77 [61.1%]). Seventy-eight (36.4%) patients had neurologic manifestations. More severe patients were likely to have neurologic symptoms (40 [45.5%] vs 38 [30.2%]), such as acute cerebrovascular diseases (5 [5.7%] vs 1 [0.8%]), impaired consciousness (13 [14.8%] vs 3 [2.4%]) and skeletal muscle injury (17 [19.3%] vs 6 [4.8%]). CONCLUSION: Compared with non-severe patients with COVID-19, severe patients commonly had neurologic symptoms manifested as acute cerebrovascular diseases, consciousness impairment and skeletal muscle symptoms.","Mao, Ling; Wang, Mengdie; Chen, Shanghai; He, Quanwei; Chang, Jiang; Hong, Candong; Zhou, Yifan; Wang, David; Li, Yanan; Jin, Huijuan; Hu, Bo",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.22.20026500,360

631111,P2 Surgery: Crisis…what crisis?,2021-05-14,"BACKGROUND: Epidemiological studies focused on primary healthcare needs of persons experiencing homelessness (PEH) are often based on data from specialist homeless healthcare services. AIM: To explore the presentation of PEH, coding of homelessness, and associated health conditions in mainstream primary care general practices in England. DESIGN & SETTING: EMIS electronic database search of medical records was conducted across 48 general practices in a clinical commissioning group (CCG), representing one of the most socioeconomically deprived regions in England, which also lacks a specialist primary healthcare service for PEH. METHOD: Key terms and codes were used to identify PEH, their respective diagnoses across 22 health conditions, and prescribed medications over the past 4 years. RESULTS: From a population of approximately 321 000, 43 (0.013%) people were coded as PEH, compared with a homelessness prevalence of 0.5% in the English general population. Mental health conditions were the most prevalent diagnoses among the PEH registrants (56.6%); the recorded prevalence of other common long-term conditions in PEH was lower than the levels observed in PEH registered with specialist homelessness health services. CONCLUSION: In a population with approximately four times higher rate of statutory homelessness, PEH representation in mainstream general practices was under-represented by several folds. As homelessness overlaps with mental health, substance misuse, and long-term health conditions, consistent coding of homelessness in medical records is imperative in order to offer tailored support and prevention actions when patients present for services.","Kaushal, Rishika; Jagpal, Parbir; Khanal, Saval; Vohra, Neha; Lowrie, Richard; Johal, Jaspal; Jenkins, Duncan; Saunders, Karen; Paudyal, Vibhu",BJGP open,https://doi.org/10.3399/bjgpo.2021.0050; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34045292/,360
634959,A healthcare logistic network considering stochastic emission of contamination: Bi-objective model and solution algorithm,2020-08-25,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus is highly pathogenic in humans and evades innate immunity at multiple levels. It has evolved various strategies to counteract the production and action of type I interferons, which mobilize the front-line defense against viral infection. In this study we demonstrate that SARS coronavirus M protein inhibits gene transcription of type I interferons. M protein potently antagonizes the activation of interferon-stimulated response element-dependent transcription by double-stranded RNA, RIG-I, MDA5, TBK1, IKKϵ, and virus-induced signaling adaptor (VISA) but has no influence on the transcriptional activity of this element when IRF3 or IRF7 is overexpressed. M protein physically associates with RIG-I, TBK1, IKKϵ, and TRAF3 and likely sequesters some of them in membrane-associated cytoplasmic compartments. Consequently, the expression of M protein prevents the formation of TRAF3·TANK·TBK1/IKKϵ complex and thereby inhibits TBK1/IKKϵ-dependent activation of IRF3/IRF7 transcription factors. Taken together, our findings reveal a new mechanism by which SARS coronavirus circumvents the production of type I interferons.","Siu, Kam-Leung; Kok, Kin-Hang; Ng, Ming-Him James; Poon, Vincent K.

Here, we assessed the levels of SARS-CoV-2 RBD specific antibodies in twenty-seven COVID-19 convalescent patients over 28-99 days after hospital discharge. Almost all patient who had severe or moderate COVID-19 symptoms and a high-level of IgG during the hospitalization showed a significant reduction at revisit. The remaining patients who had a low-level IgG during hospitalization stayed low at revisit. As expected, IgM levels in almost all convalescent patients reduced significantly or stayed low at revisit. The RBD-specific IgA levels were also reduced significantly at revisit. We also attempted to estimate decline rates of virus-specific antibodies using a previously established exponential decay model of antibody kinetics after infection. The predicted days when convalescent patients' RBD-specific IgG reaches to an undetectable level are approximately 273 days after hospital discharge, while the predicted decay times are 150 days and 108 days for IgM and IgA, respectively.

First, we use machine learning to remove the confounding effects of weather conditions on pollution concentrations. Second, we use a new augmented synthetic control method (Ben-Michael et al. in The augmented synthetic control method. University of California Berkeley, Mimeo, 2019. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.04170.pdf) to estimate the impact of the lockdown on weather normalised pollution relative to a control group of cities that were not in lockdown. We find NO[Formula: see text] concentrations fell by as much as 24 [Formula: see text] g/m[Formula: see text] during the lockdown (a reduction of 63% from the pre-lockdown level), while PM10 concentrations fell by a similar amount but for a shorter period. The lockdown had no discernible impact on concentrations of SO[Formula: see text] or CO. We calculate that the reduction of NO[Formula: see text] concentrations could have prevented as many as 496 deaths in Wuhan city, 3368 deaths in Hubei province and 10,822 deaths in China as a whole.","Cole, Matthew A.; Elliott, Robert J R; Liu, Bowen",Environ Resour Econ (Dordr),https://doi.org/10.1007/s10640-020-00483-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32836865/,360
641366,Energy Consumption of Cryptocurrencies Beyond Bitcoin,2020-08-04,"BACKGROUND: Critical illness polyneuropathy and myopathy (CIPNM) is a frequent neurological manifestation in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) infection. CIPNM diagnosis is usually limited to clinical evaluation. We compared patients with ARDS from COVID‐19 and other aetiologies, in whom a neurophysiological evaluation for the detection of CIPNM was performed. The aim was to determine if there were any differences between these two groups in frequency of CINPM and outcome at discharge from the intensive care unit (ICU). MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a single‐centre retrospective study performed on mechanically ventilated patients consecutively admitted (January 2016‐June 2020) to the ICU of Careggi Hospital, Florence, Italy, with ARDS of different aetiologies. Neurophysiological evaluation was performed on patients with stable ventilation parameters, but marked widespread hyposthenia (Medical Research Council score <48). Creatine phosphokinase (CPK), lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) and mean morning glycaemic values were collected. RESULTS: From a total of 148 patients, 23 with COVID‐19 infection and 21 with ARDS due to other aetiologies, underwent electroneurography/electromyography (ENG/EMG) recording. Incidence of CIPNM was similar in the two groups, 65% (15 of 23) in COVID‐19 patients and 71% (15 of 21) in patients affected by ARDS of other aetiologies. At ICU discharge, subjects with CIPNM more frequently required ventilatory support, regardless the aetiology of ARDS. CONCLUSION: ENG/EMG represents a useful tool in the identification of the neuromuscular causes underlying ventilator wean failure and patient stratification. A high incidence of CIPNM, with a similar percentage, has been observed in ARDS patients of all aetiologies.","Scarpino, Maenia; Bonizzoli, Manuela; Lazzeri, Chiara; Lanzo, Giovanni; Lolli, Francesco; Ciapetti, Marco; Hakiki, Bahia; Grippo, Antonello; Peris, Adriano; Ammannati, Andrea; Baldanzi, Fabrizio; Bastianelli, Maria; Bighellini, Annamaria; Boccardi, Cristina; Carrai, Riccardo; Cassardo, Annalisa; Cossu, Cesarina; Gabbanini, Simonetta; Ielapi, Carmela; Martinelli, Cristiana; Masi, Giulia; Mei, Cristina; Troiano, Simone",Acta Neurol Scand,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33890282/; https://doi.org/10.1111/ane.13433,360
641835,The effects of electronic alert letters for internet surveys of academic scientists,2021-05-23,"BACKGROUND: The Abbott Laboratories SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay and the DiaSorin LIASON SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG assay are both chemiluminescent immunoassays that qualitatively detect IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 antigens. The Abbott assay detects IgG against the viral nucleocapsid (N) protein, while the DiaSorin assay uses antigen derived from the viral spike (S) protein. Here we evaluate the performance of these two assays at our institution. METHODS: 45 patient samples (serum or plasma) were tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG by both the Abbott and DiaSorin assays. The samples were previously characterized at a national reference laboratory using the Abbott assay or by an in-house PCR-based test for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Samples yielding discordant results across platforms were further tested using the EUROIMMUN Anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA (IgG) assay at the reference laboratory. RESULTS: 22 samples tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 by the reference lab Abbott assay, and 23 tested positive by the same reference lab test (n = 13) or by an in-house PCR-based test (n = 10). The 22 samples characterized as negative again tested negative by both the Abbott (in-house) and DiaSorin assays (100% NPA). Among the 23 samples characterized as positive, all 23 tested positive by the Abbott assay (100% PPA), while only 15 tested positive by the DiaSorin assay (65% PPA). For each of the 8 discordant cases, samples were further tested by EUROIMMUN assay, which targets the S protein; 7 of the 8 samples tested negative by this assay, in agreement with the DiaSorin test results. Thus, for the discordant cases, testing for IgG against N (in-house and reference lab Abbott assays) gave positive results, while testing for IgG against S (DiaSorin and EUROIMMUN assays) mostly gave negative results. CONCLUSION: These findings highlight the importance of the differences between various SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests, and providers should be aware of the specific antigenic target(s) in each test. Selection of a specific assay may depend on the need to assess past exposure to SARS-CoV-2 (for which a nucleocapsid target may be more sensitive) or to detect neutralizing antibodies (for which a spike target may be more relevant). This also has implications for disease surveillance as reliance on anti-spike antibodies alone may underestimate infection prevalence.

Accordingly, the lungs bear the greatest pathologic burden with the major cause of death being respiratory failure. However, organs remote from the initial site of infection (e.g., kidney, heart) are not spared, particularly in severe and fatal cases. Emerging evidence indicates that an excessive inflammatory response coupled with a diminished antiviral defense is pivotal in the initiation and development of COVID-19. A common finding in autopsy specimens is the presence of thrombi in the lungs as well as remote organs, indicative of immunothrombosis. Herein, the role of SARS-CoV-2 in lung inflammation and associated sequelae are reviewed with an emphasis on immunothrombosis.

However, thromboembolic events are also prevalent in COVID-19. The pathogenesis of COVID-19 hypercoagulability is not well known but may be linked to the cytokine storm induced by a viral infection or endothelial damage that triggers a cascade leading to hypercoagulability. Because vascular endothelium has angiotensin-converting enzyme 2-like lung tissue, COVID-19 targets lung tissue and vascular endothelium, leading to thrombosis. We present a rare case of a young patient with COVID-19 who presented with thrombosis of the cerebral venous system managed with anticoagulation.

We previously studied 35 hospitalized COVID-19 patients of the 1st wave demonstrating a cytokine storm and the exhaustion of most lymphocyte subpopulations. Herein, we describe the results obtained from COVID-19 patients of the 2nd wave. METHODS: We analyzed interleukin (IL)-6 by human-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and a large set of lymphocyte subpopulations by flow cytometry in 274 COVID-19 patients hospitalized from September 2020 to May 2021. RESULTS: Patients of 2nd wave compared with those of 1st wave showed lower serum IL-6 levels and a higher number of B and most T lymphocyte subpopulations in advanced stages, in relation with the age and the gender. On the other hand, we observed in 2nd wave patients: (i) a reduction of most lymphocyte subpopulations at mild and moderate stages; (ii) a reduction of natural killer cells and T regulatory cells together with a higher number of activated T helper (TH) 17 lymphocytes in all stages, which were mainly related to steroid and azithromycin therapies before hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 had a less severe impact in patients of the 2nd wave in advanced stages, while the impact appeared more severe in patients of mild and moderate stages, as compared with 1st wave patients. This finding suggests that in COVID-19 patients with milder expression at diagnosis, steroid and azithromycin therapies appear to worsen the immune response against the virus. Furthermore, the cytometric profile may help to drive targeted therapies by monoclonal antibodies to modulate specific IL/lymphocyte inhibition or activation in COVID-19 patients.","Scalia, Giulia; Raia, Maddalena; Gelzo, Monica; Cacciapuoti, Sara; De Rosa, Annunziata; Pinchera, Biagio; Scotto, Riccardo; Giaccone, Agnese; Mormile, Mauro; Fabbrocini, Gabriella; Gentile, Ivan; Parrella, Roberto; Castaldo, Giuseppe",J Transl Med,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12967-021-03072-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34556132/,360

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted an analytical cross-sectional study among 23 Congolese referral hospitals, including three university hospitals, located in three towns from March through 30 April 2020. The main outcome variable was healthcare workers’ acceptance of a future vaccine against COVID-19. The associated factors of vaccination willingness were identified through a logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: A sample of 613 HCWs participated in the study and completed the study questionnaire, including 312 (50.9%) men and 301 (49.1%) women. Only 27.7% of HCWs said that they would accept a COVID-19 vaccine if it was available. From the logistic regression analysis, male healthcare workers (ORa=1.17, 95% CI: 1.15–2.60), primarily doctors (ORa=1.59; 95% CI:1.03–2.44) and having a positive attitude towards a COVID-19 vaccine (ORa=11.49; 95% CI: 5.88–22.46) were significantly associated with reporting willingness to be vaccinated. CONCLUSION: For acceptability of vaccination against COVID-19 among others education among HCWs is crucial because health professionals’ attitudes about vaccines are an important determinant of their own vaccine uptake and their likelihood of recommending the vaccine to their patients.","Kabamba Nzaji, Michel; Kabamba Ngombe, Leon; Ngoie Mwamba, Guillaume; Banza Ndala, Deca Blood; Mbidi Miema, Judith; Luhata Lungoyo, Christophe; Lora Mwimba, Bertin; Cikomola Mwana Bene, Aimé; Mukamba Musenga, Elisabeth",Pragmat Obs Res,https://doi.org/10.2147/por.s271096; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33154695/,360

The World Health Organization (WHO) introduced the “My Five Moments for Hand Hygiene” model to educate healthcare workers about the importance of hand hygiene to stop the spread of disease. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this paper were to determine if the WHO Hand Hygiene Observation Form could be used to monitor for hand and personal hygiene practices of Optometry students, and what their actual hygiene practices are in an Optometry training facility in South Africa. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was performed at an Optometry training facility in South Africa using third (n=32) and fourth year (n=39) students. The Hand Hygiene Knowledge Questionnaire for Health Care Workers by the WHO was used to determine their knowledge regarding hand hygiene. After completing the questionnaire, participants were observed in the clinic while consulting patients to determine the hand and surface hygiene practices they apply. RESULTS: The WHO hand hygiene observation rubric was not appropriate to evaluate hand and surface hygiene in Optometry facilities. The adapted observation rubric created was a better tool to evaluate student hygiene practices and was able to record which hand or surface hygiene were missed when presented with such opportunities. Although 90.1% of the students knew that germs could be transferred to the patients via hands, only 46.5% routinely used an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.

Citrus leafminer (Phyllocnistis citrella) is a potential pest that directly feeds the newly sprouted leaves and twigs of all three spring, summer and autumn flushes. Increasing temperatures in spring and autumn, leafminer accrued more heat units or developmental degree days to accelerate the biological stages of its life-cycle, thereby increasing the pressure of infestation. Present work was conducted at three different environmental conditions in Sargodha, Toba Tek Singh (TTS) and Vehari districts of the Punjab province, Pakistan; all three experimental sites were located in different agro-ecological zones. More infestation was recorded in all three flushes at TTS and Vehari than in Sargodha. Overall, more damage was observed due to higher temperatures in TTS and Vehari than in Sargodha. After May–June heat stress, spontaneous vegetative growth continued from July to November, produced newly spouted tender leaves for feeding the leafminer larvae, and was seen more in TTS and Vehari. Leafminer larva prefers to enter young and tender leaves with a maximum entrance in leaves up to 1 cm(2) in size while observing no entrance above 3 cm(2) of leaf size. Physiological response of leaves primarily attributed to chlorophyll and carotenoid contents, both of which were recorded lower in the mined leaves, thereby reducing leaf photosynthetic activity. Similarly, lower levels of polyphenols and antioxidant activity were also recorded in the mined leaves. The on-tree age of mined leaves of three vegetative flushes of Kinnow plant was also less counted than non-mined leaves. Climate change has affected vegetative phenology and become feasible for pests due to extemporaneous leaf growth, particularly leafminer, and eventually causes economic loss by supplying low carbohydrates either to hanging fruits or next-season crops.","Nawaz, Rab; Abbasi, Nadeem Akhtar; Hafiz, Ishfaq Ahmad; Khan, Muhammad Faisal; Khalid, Azeem",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33833311/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-87160-8,360

Following from the observation that a lncRNA that we call negative regulator of antiviral response (NRAV) was dramatically downregulated during infection with several viruses, we ectopically expressed NRAV in human cells or transgenic mice and found that it significantly promotes influenza A virus (IAV) replication and virulence. Conversely, silencing NRAV suppressed IAV replication and virus production, suggesting that reduction of NRAV is part of the host antiviral innate immune response to virus infection. NRAV negatively regulates the initial transcription of multiple critical interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), including IFITM3 and MxA, by affecting histone modification of these genes.

649483,Effectiveness of overnight learning commons: A comparative study,2020-11-30,"BACKGROUND: The infectious pathway of the non-enveloped Human Papillomavirus Type 16 (HPV16) includes binding to the cell surface, clathrin-mediated endocytosis, and penetration into an endosome. HPV16 infection was shown to decrease in the presence of the lysosomotrophic neutralizing agent ammonium chloride (NH(4)Cl). NH(4)Cl neutralizes acidic endo-lysosome compartments, thus suggesting that pH was responsible for PV capsid conformational changes leading endosome escape. RESULTS: However, our data suggested that NH(4)Cl blocked infection by preventing the movement of PV viral particles from the early endosome to the caveosome as was shown for JC virus [1,2]. We have confirmed that HPV 16 infection requires the trafficking of reporter-virions to the caveosome as is the case for BPV1 [3,4]. In this manuscript we propose that the observed decrease in infection of PV in the presence of NH(4)Cl was due to a loss of movement of reporter-virions to caveosomes. We also demonstrate that cysteine proteases are involved in the infectious process, and that cathepsin B treatment of viral particles was shown to overcome the block of infection observed in the presence of furin inhibition. We confirmed the need for cathepsin B in HPV16 infection using cathepsin B null mouse embryonic fibroblasts. CONCLUSION: We present data that suggest HPV16 infection is in part mediated by cysteine proteases, and that NH(4)Cl blocks the intracellular trafficking of infectious viral particles. To our knowledge this is the first demonstration that cysteine proteases influence the infection of a non-enveloped virus.","Dabydeen, Sarah A; Meneses, Patricio I",Virol J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19619315/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-6-109,360

Throughout the pandemic, several health systems were overwhelmed in light of the rapid emergence of new cases within a short period of time. The heavy workload imposed on hospital services might have negatively affected patients' outcomes and exacerbated mortality rates. Here, we assessed excess in-hospital mortality across the Israeli healthcare system, using a model developed for predicting patient mortality based on data of day-by-day patient disease course. Mortality predictions were made using Monte-Carlo methods based on a multistate survival analysis and a set of Cox regression models, first constructed and validated on a nationwide cohort during the first stages of the pandemic in Israel. We show that during a peak of hospitalizations in September and October 2020, patient deaths significantly exceeded the model's mortality predictions, while reverting to match the predictions as patient load subsided in October, and showing signs of renewed excess mortality as hospital load is increasing again since late December 2020. Our work emphasizes that even in countries in which the healthcare system did not reach a specific point defined as insufficiency, the increase in hospital workload was associated with higher patient mortality, while ruling out factors related to changes in the hospitalized population. In addition, our study highlights the importance of quantifying excess mortality in order to assess quality of care, and define an appropriate carrying capacity of severe patients in order to guide timely healthcare policies and allocate appropriate resources.

Previously, we showed that the cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus) is semi-permissive to HRV16 (major group, species HRV-A virus) infection, replicating in the upper and lower respiratory tracts with measurable pathology, mucus production, and expression of inflammatory mediators. Herein, we report that intranasal infection of cotton rats with HRV14 (major group, species HRV-B virus) results in isolation of infectious virus from the nose and lung. Similar to HRV16, intramuscular immunization with live HRV14 induces homologous protection that correlated with high levels of serum neutralizing antibodies. Vaccination and challenge experiments with HRV14 and HRV16 to evaluate the development of cross-protective immunity demonstrate that intramuscular immunization with live HRV16 significantly protects animals against HRV14 challenge. Determination of the immunological mechanisms involved in heterologous protection and further characterization of infection with other major HRV serotypes in the cotton rat could enhance the robustness of the model to define heterotypic relationships between this diverse group of viruses and thereby increase its potential for development of a multi-serotype HRV vaccine.","Patel, Mira C.; Pletneva, Lioubov M.; Boukhvalova, Marina S.; Vogel, Stefanie N.; Kajon, Adriana E.; Blanco, Jorge C.

651990,Is Net Zero Carbon 2050 Possible?,2020-09-11,"Vaccines are the most effective measure to prevent deaths and illness from infectious diseases. Nevertheless, the efficacy of several paediatric vaccines is lower in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs), where mortality from vaccine-preventable infections remains high. Vaccine efficacy can also be decreased in adults in the context of some common comorbidities. Identifying and correcting the specific causes of impaired vaccine efficacy is of substantial value to global health. Iron deficiency is the most common micronutrient deficiency worldwide, affecting more than 2 billion people, and its prevalence in LMICs could increase as food security is threatened by the COVID-19 pandemic. In this Viewpoint, we highlight evidence showing that iron deficiency limits adaptive immunity and responses to vaccines, representing an under-appreciated additional disadvantage to iron deficient populations. We propose a framework for urgent detailed studies of iron–vaccine interactions to investigate and clarify the issue. This framework includes retrospective analysis of newly available datasets derived from trials of COVID-19 and other vaccines, and prospective testing of whether nutritional iron interventions, commonly used worldwide to combat anaemia, improve vaccine performance.","Drakesmith, Hal; Pasricha, Sant-Rayn; Cabantchik, Ioav; Hershko, Chaim; Weiss, Guenter; Girelli, Domenico; Stoffel, Nicole; Muckenthaler, Martina U; Nemeth, Elizabeta; Camaschella, Clara; Klenerman, Paul; Zimmermann, Michael B",Lancet Haematol,https://doi.org/10.1016/s2352-3026(21)00201-5; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352302621002015; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2352302621002015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34450104/,360

The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) shares some similarities with IPF. SARS-CoV-2 related genes have been reported to be broadly regulated by N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A) RNA modification. Here, we identified the association between m(6)A methylation regulators, COVID-19 infection pathways, and immune responses in IPF. The characteristic gene expression networks and immune infiltration patterns of m(6)A-SARS-CoV-2 related genes in different tissues of IPF were revealed. We subsequently evaluated the influence of these related gene expression patterns and immune infiltration patterns on the prognosis/lung function of IPF patients. The IPF cohort was obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus dataset. Pearson correlation analysis was performed to identify the correlations among genes or cells. The CIBERSORT algorithm was used to assess the infiltration of 22 types of immune cells. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and proportional hazards model (Cox model) were used to develop the prognosis prediction model. Our research is pivotal for further understanding of the cellular and genetic links between IPF and SARS-CoV-2 infection in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, which may contribute to providing new ideas for prognosis assessment and treatment of both diseases.","Li, Xinyu; Peng, Cheng; Zhu, Ziqing; Cai, Haozheng; Zhuang, Quan",Aging (Albany NY),https://doi.org/10.18632/aging.202725; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33647885/,360

Predicting the concentrations of PM(2.5) and PM(10), therefore, is a prerequisite to avoid the consequences and mitigate the complications. This research utilized the machine learning (ML) models such as linear-support vector machine (L-SVM), medium Gaussian-support vector machine (M-SVM), Gaussian process regression (GPR), artificial neural network (ANN), random forest regression (RFR), and a time series model namely PROPHET. Atmospheric NO(X), SO(2), CO, and O(3), along with meteorological variables from Dhaka, Chattogram, Rajshahi, and Sylhet for the period of 2013 to 2019, were utilized as exploratory variables. Results showed that the overall performance of GPR performed better particularly for Dhaka in predicting the concentration of both PM(2.5) and PM(10) while ANN performed best in case of Chattogram and Sylhet for predicting PM(2.5). However, in terms of predicting PM(10), M-SVM and RFR were selected respectively.

Across some heterogeneity in tumor type, stage, and treatment, virus-exposed solid cancer patients display a dominant impact of SARS-CoV-2, apparent from the resemblance of their immune signatures to those for COVID-19(+) non-cancer patients. This is not the case for hematological malignancies, with virus-exposed patients collectively displaying heterogeneous humoral responses, an exhausted T cell phenotype and a high prevalence of prolonged virus shedding. Furthermore, while recovered solid cancer patients' immunophenotypes resemble those of non-virus-exposed cancer patients, recovered hematological cancer patients display distinct, lingering immunological legacies. Thus, while solid cancer patients, including those with advanced disease, seem no more at risk of SARS-CoV-2-associated immune dysregulation than the general population, hematological cancer patients show complex immunological consequences of SARS-CoV-2 exposure that might usefully inform their care.","Abdul-Jawad, Sultan; Baù, Luca; Alaguthurai, Thanussuyah; del Molino del Barrio, Irene; Laing, Adam G.; Hayday, Thomas S.; Monin, Leticia; Muñoz-Ruiz, Miguel; McDonald, Louisa; Francos Quijorna, Isaac; McKenzie, Duncan; Davis, Richard; Lorenc, Anna; Chan, Julie Nuo En; Ryan, Sarah; Bugallo-Blanco, Eva; Yorke, Rozalyn; Kamdar, Shraddha; Fish, Matthew; Zlatareva, Iva; Vantourout, Pierre; Jennings, Aislinn; Gee, Sarah; Doores, Katie; Bailey, Katharine; Hazell, Sophie; De Naurois, Julien; Moss, Charlotte; Russell, Beth; Khan, Aadil A.; Rowley, Mark; Benjamin, Reuben; Enting, Deborah; Alrifai, Doraid; Wu, Yin; Zhou, You; Barber, Paul; Ng, Tony; Spicer, James; Van Hemelrijck, Mieke; Kumar, Mayur; Vidler, Jennifer; Lwin, Yadanar; Fields, Paul; Karagiannis, Sophia N.; Coolen, Anthony C.C.; Rigg, Anne; Papa, Sophie; Hayday, Adrian C.; Patten, Piers E.M.; Irshad, Sheeba",Cancer Cell,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ccell.2021.01.001; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1535610821000015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33476581/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1535610821000015,360

Given the absence of a current vaccine or specific antiviral treatment, it is urgent to search for FDA-approved drugs that can potentially inhibit essential viral enzymes. The inhibition of 3CL(pro) has potential medical application, due to the fact that it is required for processing of the first translated replicase polyproteins into a series of native proteins, which are essential for viral replication in the host cell. We employed an in silico approach to test if disulfiram, as well as its metabolites, and captopril could be used as potential antiviral drugs against COVID-19. We provide data on the potential covalent interaction of disulfiram and its metabolites with the substrate binding subsite of 3CL(pro) and propose a possible mechanism for the irreversible protease inactivation thought the reaction of the aforementioned compounds with the Cys145. Although, captopril is shown to be a potential ligand of 3CL(pro), it is not recommended anti-COVID-19 therapy, due to the fact that it can induce the expression of the viral cellular receptor such as, angiotensin-converting enzyme ACE-2, and thus, making the patient potentially more susceptible to infection. On the other hand, disulfiram, an alcoholism-averting drug, has been previously proposed as an antimicrobial and anti-SARS and MERS agent, safe to use even at higher doses with low side effects, it is recommended to be tested for control of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

659072,When The Wrong People Are Immune,2020-05-08,"The current COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, poses a serious public health threat. Effective therapeutic and prophylactic treatments are urgently needed. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2, which binds to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Here, we developed recombinant human ACE2-Fc fusion protein (hACE2-Fc) and a hACE2-Fc mutant with reduced catalytic activity. hACE2-Fc and the hACE2-Fc mutant both efficiently blocked entry of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and HCoV-NL63 into hACE2-expressing cells and inhibited SARS-CoV-2 S protein-mediated cell–cell fusion. hACE2-Fc also neutralized various SARS-CoV-2 strains with enhanced infectivity including D614G and V367F mutations, as well as the emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.351 (Beta), B.1.617.1 (Kappa), and B.1.617.2 (Delta), demonstrating its potent and broad-spectrum antiviral effects. In addition, hACE2-Fc proteins protected HBE from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Unlike RBD-targeting neutralizing antibodies, hACE2-Fc treatment did not induce the development of escape mutants. Furthermore, both prophylactic and therapeutic hACE2-Fc treatments effectively protected mice from SARS-CoV-2 infection, as determined by reduced viral replication, weight loss, histological changes, and inflammation in the lungs. The protection provided by hACE2 showed obvious dose-dependent efficacy in vivo. Pharmacokinetic data indicated that hACE2-Fc has a relative long half-life in vivo compared to soluble ACE2, which makes it an excellent candidate for prophylaxis and therapy for COVID-19 as well as for SARS-CoV and HCoV-NL63 infections.","Zhang, Zhaoyong; Zeng, Eric; Zhang, Lu; Wang, Weiming; Jin, Yingkang; Sun, Jiye; Huang, Shuxiang; Yin, Wenguang; Dai, Jun; Zhuang, Zhen; Chen, Zhao; Sun, Jing; Zhu, Airu; Li, Fang; Cao, Weitao; Li, Xiaobo; Shi, Yongxia; Gan, Mian; Zhang, Shengnan; Wei, Peilan; Huang, Jicheng; Zhong, Nanshan; Zhong, Guocai; Zhao, Jingxian; Wang, Yanqun; Shao, Weihui; Zhao, Jincun",Cell Discov,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41421-021-00302-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34385423/,360

659200,Contemplating for the post pandemic era,2020-12-28,"BACKGROUND: Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) is the causative agent of postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS), and porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome (PDNS). It has caused heavy losses in global agriculture in recent decades. Rapid detection of PCV2 is very important for the effective prophylaxis and treatment of PMWS. RESULTS: A loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay was used to detect PCV2 in this study. Three pairs of primers were specially designed for recognizing eight distinct sequences of the ORF2 gene. This gene lies in the PCV2 virus genome sequence, and encodes the Rep protein that is involved in virus replication. Time and temperature conditions for amplification of PCV2 genes were optimized to be 55 min at 59°C. The analysis of clinical samples indicated that the LAMP method was highly sensitive. The detection limit for PCV2 by the LAMP assay was 10 copies, whereas the limit by conventional PCR was 1000 copies. The assay did not cross-react with PCV1, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, transmissible gastroenteritis of pigs virus or rotavirus. When 110 samples were tested using the established LAMP system, 95 were detected as positive. CONCLUSION: The newly developed LAMP detection method for PCV2 was more specific, sensitive, rapid and simple than before. It complements and extends previous methods for PCV2 detection and provides an alternative approach for detection of PCV2.","Zhao, Kai; Shi, Wei; Han, Fangting; Xu, Yan; Zhu, Lianlong; Zou, Yong; Wu, Xiao; Zhu, Hong; Tan, Furong; Tao, Shiru; Tang, Xueming",Virol J,https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-8-126; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21414233/,360

However, data regarding the follow-up of these individuals are scarce. METHODS: Three patients (data of two patients already published) with acute onset diabetes and DKA, precipitated by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), were followed for 14 weeks to assess the behavior of the diabetes. Detailed history, anthropometry, laboratory investigations, imaging studies, clinical course and outcomes were documented. RESULTS: Three individuals developed symptoms suggestive of SARS CoV-2 infection. After a few days, they were detected to have COVID-19 pneumonia, based on reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay and chest imaging. In the meantime, they also developed acute onset diabetes and DKA, which were precipitated by COVID-19. They responded well to treatment, including intravenous fluids and insulin. After around one week, they were transitioned to multiple shots of subcutaneous insulin. After about 4–6 weeks, their insulin requirement diminished and oral antihyperglycemic drugs were initiated. At the last follow-up (14 months), they had controlled glycemia with oral antihyperglycemic medicines. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 can induce acute onset diabetes and DKA in some individuals with no history of diabetes. These features resemble type 1 diabetes. However, after 4–6 weeks, their requirement for exogenous insulin diminishes and respond to oral antihyperglycemic medications.

At the end of 2015, we implemented antimicrobial stewardship including systematic use of MRT. Then, we compared our observations between the year 2015 and the year 2016. We designed the study according to the STrengthening the Reporting of OBservational studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) tool. A U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-cleared multiplexed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) system (BioFire FilmArray, Idaho Technology, Salt Lake City, UT) which detects 17 viruses and three bacteria was used for diagnosis. In total, 1317 patients were included; 630 (48%) were inpatients and 569 (43%) were older than 16 years of age. At least one virus was detected in 747 (57%) patients. Rhinovirus/enterovirus, influenza virus, and adenovirus were the most commonly detected. Among hospitalized patients, in children, a significant decrease in antibiotic use (44.5% in 2015 and 28.8% in 2016, p = 0.009) was observed, but in adults, the decrease was not statistically significant (72% in 2015 and 63% in 2016, p = 0.36). The duration of antibiotic use after the detection of virus was significantly decreased in both children and adults (p < 0.001 and p = 0.007, respectively). By using MRT, inappropriate antibiotic use and, also, duration of inappropriate antibiotic use after the detection of virus was significantly decreased.

Predictors of PTSD symptom severity were the female gender, past traumatic events, protracted symptoms, stigmatization, and a negative view on the COVID-19 pandemic. PTSD symptom severity was the sole independent predictor of the protracted symptoms. Our results suggest that COVID-19 patients are prone to substantial psychological distress in the first few months after the infection. The protracted symptoms were frequent in this period, and these were closely related to the posttraumatic symptoms.","Poyraz, Burç Çağrı; Poyraz, Cana Aksoy; Olgun, Yeşim; Gürel, Özge; Alkan, Sena; Özdemir, Yusuf Emre; Balkan, İlker İnanç; Karaali, Rıdvan",Psychiatry Res,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165178120332650?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165178120332650; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113604; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33296818/,360
665217,Monitoring the Spatial Spread of COVID-19 and Effectiveness of Control Measures Through Human Movement Data: Proposal for a Predictive Model Using Big Data Analytics,2020-12-18,"Background: Several studies have investigated the implication of air pollution and some social determinants on COVID-19-related outcomes, but none of them assessed the implication of spatial repartition of the socio-environmental determinants on geographic variations of COVID-19 related outcomes. Understanding spatial heterogeneity in relation to the socio-environmental determinant and COVID-19-related outcomes is central to target interventions toward a vulnerable population. Objectives: To determine the spatial variability of COVID-19 related outcomes among the elderly in France at the department level. We also aimed to assess whether a geographic pattern of Covid-19 may be partially explained by spatial distribution of both long-term exposure to air pollution and deprived living conditions. Methods: This study considered four health events related to COVID-19 infection over the period of 18 March and 02 December 2020: (i) hospitalization, (ii) cases in intensive health care in the hospital, (iii) death in the hospital, and (iv) hospitalized patients recovered and returned back home. We used the percentage of household living in an overcrowding housing to characterize the living conditions and long-term exposure to NO(2) to analyse the implication of air pollution. Using a spatial scan statistic approach, a Poisson cluster analysis method based on a likelihood ratio test and Monte Carlo replications was applied to identify high-risk clusters of a COVID-19-related outcome. Result: our results revealed that all the outcomes related to COVID-19 infection investigated were not randomly distributed in France with a statistically significant cluster of high risk located in Eastern France of the hospitalization, cases in the intensive health care at the hospital, death in the hospital, and recovered and returned back home compared to the rest of France (relative risk, RR = 1.28, p-value = 0.001, RR = 3.05, p = 0.001, RR = 2.94, p = 0.001, RR = 2.51, p = 0.001, respectively). After adjustments for socio-environmental determinants, the crude cluster shifts according to different scenarios suggested that both the overcrowding housing level and long-term exposure to largely NO(2) explain the spatial distribution of COVID-19-related outcomes. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the geographic pattern of COVID-19-related outcomes is largely explained by socio-spatial distribution of long-term exposure to NO(2). However, to better understand spatial variations of COVID-19-related outcomes, it would be necessary to investigate and adjust it for other determinants. Thus, the current sanitary crisis reminds us of how unequal we all are in facing this disease.","Deguen, Séverine; Kihal-Talantikite, Wahida",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18041824; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33668482/,360

Physiologically relevant models for respiratory conditions will be essential for new drug development. The composition and structure of the lung extracellular matrix (ECM) plays a major role in the function of the lung tissue and cells. Lung-on-chip models have been developed to address some of the limitations of current two-dimensional in vitro models. In this review, we describe various ECM substitutes utilized for modeling the respiratory system. We explore the application of lung-on-chip models to the study of cigarette smoke and electronic cigarette vapor. We discuss the challenges and opportunities related to model characterization with an emphasis on in situ characterization methods, both established and emerging. We discuss how further advancements in the field, through the incorporation of interstitial cells and ECM, have the potential to provide an effective tool for interrogating lung biology and disease, especially the mechanisms that involve the interstitial elements.","Bennet, Tanya J.; Randhawa, Avineet; Hua, Jessica; Cheung, Karen C.",Cells,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34206722/; https://doi.org/10.3390/cells10071602,360

It is of crucial importance to estimate the reproductive number (R0) of the novel virus in the early stage of outbreak and make a prediction of daily new cases on the ship. METHOD: We fitted the reported serial interval (mean and standard deviation) with a gamma distribution and applied “earlyR” package in R to estimate the R0 in the early stage of COVID-19 outbreak. We applied “projections” package in R to simulate the plausible cumulative epidemic trajectories and future daily incidence by fitting the data of existing daily incidence, a serial interval distribution, and the estimated R0 into a model based on the assumption that daily incidence obeys approximately Poisson distribution determined by daily infectiousness. RESULTS: The Maximum-Likelihood (ML) value of R0 was 2.28 for COVID-19 outbreak at the early stage on the ship. The median with 95% confidence interval (CI) of R0 values was 2.28 (2.06–2.52) estimated by the bootstrap resampling method. The probable number of new cases for the next ten days would gradually increase, and the estimated cumulative cases would reach 1514 (1384–1656) at the tenth day in the future. However, if R0 value was reduced by 25% and 50%, the estimated total number of cumulative cases would be reduced to 1081 (981–1177) and 758 (697–817), respectively. CONCLUSION: The median with 95% CI of R0 of COVID-19 was about 2.28 (2.06–2.52) during the early stage experienced on the Diamond Princess cruise ship. The future daily incidence and probable outbreak size is largely dependent on the change of R0. Unless strict infection management and control are taken, our findings indicate the potential of COVID-19 to cause greater outbreak on the ship.","Zhang, Sheng; Diao, MengYuan; Yu, Wenbo; Pei, Lei; Lin, Zhaofen; Chen, Dechang",Int J Infect Dis,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971220300916; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32097725/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.02.033; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971220300916,360

The introduction of live oral rotavirus vaccines has reduced the incidence of rotavirus disease in many countries. To explore the possibility of establishing a combined rotavirus-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, we generated recombinant (r)SA11 rotaviruses with modified segment 7 RNAs that contained coding sequences for NSP3 and FLAG-tagged portions of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein. A 2A translational element was used to drive separate expression of NSP3 and the S product. rSA11 viruses were recovered that encoded the S-protein S1 fragment, N-terminal domain (NTD), receptor-binding domain (RBD), extended receptor-binding domain (ExRBD), and S2 core (CR) domain (rSA11/NSP3-fS1, -fNTD, -fRBD, -fExRBD, and -fCR, respectively). Generation of rSA11/fS1 required a foreign-sequence insertion of 2.2-kbp, the largest such insertion yet made into the rotavirus genome. Based on isopycnic centrifugation, rSA11 containing S sequences were denser than wildtype virus, confirming the capacity of the rotavirus to accommodate larger genomes. Immunoblotting showed that rSA11/-fNTD, -fRBD, -fExRBD, and -fCR viruses expressed S products of expected size, with fExRBD expressed at highest levels. These rSA11 viruses were genetically stable during serial passage. In contrast, rSA11/NSP3-fS1 failed to express its expected 80-kDa fS1 product, for unexplained reasons. Moreover, rSA11/NSP3-fS1 was genetically unstable, with variants lacking the S1 insertion appearing during serial passage. Nonetheless, these results emphasize the potential usefulness of rotavirus vaccines as expression vectors of portions of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein (e.g., NTD, RBD, ExRBD, and CR) with sizes smaller than the S1 fragment.","Philip, Asha A.; Patton, John T.",bioRxiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33619485/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.18.431835,360

Despite the existence of effective vaccine and screening tools, efforts to reduce the burden of cervical cancer must be considered in the context of the social structures within the health systems of LMICs. Compounding this existing challenge is the global COVID-19 pandemic, declared in March 2020. While it is too soon to tell how health systems priorities will change as a result of COVID-19 and its impact on the cervical cancer elimination agenda, there are opportunities to strengthen cervical screening by leveraging on several trends. Many LMICs maximized the strengths of their long established community-based primary care and public health systems with expansion of surveillance systems which incorporated mobile technologies. LMICs can harness the momentum of the measures taken against COVID-19 to consolidate the efforts against cervical cancer. Self-sampling, molecular human papillomavirus (HPV) testing and digital health will shift health systems towards stronger public health and primary care networks and away from expensive hospital-based care investments. While COVID-19 will change health systems priorities in LMICs in ways that may de-prioritize cervical cancer screening, there are significant opportunities for integration into longer-term trends towards universal health coverage, self-care and digital health.","Woo, Yin Ling; Gravitt, Patti; Khor, Swee Kheng; Ng, Chiu Wan; Saville, Marion",Prev Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33678225/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091743520303182; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0091743520303182; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ypmed.2020.106294,360

Following intracerebral injection of a neurovirululent strain of influenza A virus into mice, the virus was found to be particularly localized in neurons of the substantia nigra and hippocampus. Although efforts to detect virus particles in the brains, or antibodies in the serum or CSF of patients with PD have been generally unsuccessful, recent immunohistochemical work has revealed the presence of complement proteins and the interferon-induced MxA in association with Lewy bodies and swollen neuronal processes. Although a viral etiology for PD is not now widely accepted, we proposed such an hypothesis. Neurovirulent influenza A virus is a candidate, but some other viruses or complex infection of these viruses may be responsible for the formation of Lewy bodies and the later death of nigral neurons.","Yamada, Tatsuo",Parkinsonism & Related Disorders,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/1353802096000065; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18591027/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/1353802096000065,360

Drug repositioning is one of the strategies that has the potential to deliver therapeutics relatively quickly. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has shown that integrating critical data resources to drive drug-repositioning studies, involving host-host, host-pathogen and drug-target interactions, remains a time-consuming effort that translates to a delay in the development and delivery of a life-saving therapy. RESULTS: Here, we describe a workflow we designed for a semi-automated integration of rapidly emerging datasets that can be generally adopted in a broad network pharmacology research setting. The workflow was used to construct a COVID-19 focused multimodal network that integrates 487 host-pathogen, 74,805 host-host protein and 1,265 drug-target interactions. The resultant Neo4j graph database named “Neo4COVID19” is accessible via a web interface and via API calls based on the Bolt protocol.

Bronchiectasis is now again increasingly diagnosed, and its renewed interest has resulted in further in-depth studies in children and adults. However, diagnostic labeling of childhood bronchiectasis by radiology using adult-derived criteria has substantial limitations. Thus, pediatric-derived criteria are advocated. A paradigm presenting a spectrum related to airway bacteria, with associated degradation and inflammation products causing airway damage if untreated, entails PBB (at the mild end) to irreversible airway dilatation with cystic formation as determined by chest computed tomography (CT) scan (at the severe end of the spectrum). Increasing evidence suggest that progression of airway damage can be limited by intensive treatment, even in those predestined to have bronchiectasis (e.g., immune deficiency). Treatment is aimed at achieving a cure in those at the milder end of the spectrum to limiting further deterioration in those with severe “irreversible” radiological bronchiectasis.

During the lockdown, the general population delayed sleep timing and spent more time in bed; however, little is known on the effects of COVID‐19 restriction on children and adolescents suffering type 1 narcolepsy. In the last months of 2019, we performed follow‐up actigraphy in 18 type 1 narcolepsy children and adolescents under stable pharmacological treatment with sodium oxybate. We contacted these patients for a follow‐up actigraphy during the first Italian lockdown. Actigraphs and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale for children and adolescents (ESS‐CHAD) have been sent to participants’ homes. Differences in motor activity were analysed through functional linear modelling. During lockdown, type 1 narcolepsy children and adolescents went to bed and woke up later, slept more during the daytime and napped more frequently. No difference emerged in time in bed, estimated total sleep time and nocturnal sleep quality. Similarly, no difference emerged in ESS‐CHAD and body mass index. The time‐series analysis of motor activity documented reduced activity during the early morning and in the evening during the lockdown period compared with pre‐lockdown.

Aim: To analyze effect of socioeconomic variables and the influence of public oral health services availability on the frequency of new hospitalized cases and mortality of oral cancer in Brazil. Materials and Methods: This observational study analyzed all Brazilian cities with at least one hospitalized case of oral cancer in the National Cancer Institute database (2002–2017). For each city were collected: population size, Municipal Human Development Index (MHDI), Gini Coefficient, oral health coverage in primary care, number of Dental Specialized Centers (DSC) and absolute frequency of deaths after one year of the first treatment. The risk ratio was determined by COX regression, and the effect of the predictor variables on the incidence of cases was verified by the Hazard Ratio measure. Poisson regression was used to determine factors associated with higher mortality frequency. Results: Cities above 50,000 inhabitants, with high or very high MHDI, more unequal (Gini > 0.4), with less oral health coverage in primary care (<50%) and without DSC had a greater accumulated risk of having 1 or more cases (p < 0.001). Higher frequency of deaths was also associated with higher population size, higher MHDI, higher Gini and lower oral health coverage in primary care (p < 0.001). Conclusions: The number hospitalization and deaths due to oral cancer in Brazil was influenced by the cities’ population size, the population’s socioeconomic status and the availability of public dental services.","Freire, Aldelany R.; Freire, Deborah E.

Co-infection of M. tuberculosis and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), emergence of drug resistant M. tuberculosis, and failure to develop highly effective TB vaccines have limited control of the TB epidemic. Trained immunity is an enhanced innate immune response which functions independently of the adaptive/acquired immune system and responds non-specifically to reinfection with invading agents. Recently, several studies have found trained immunity has the capability to control and eliminate M. tuberculosis infection. Over the past decades, however, the consensus was adaptive immunity is the only protective mechanism by which hosts inhibit M. tuberculosis growth. Furthermore, autophagy plays an essential role in the development of trained immunity. Further investigation of trained immunity, M. tuberculosis infection, and the role of autophagy in this process provide new possibilities for vaccine development. In this review, we present the general characteristics of trained immunity and autophagy.

They rely on bidirectional neural interfaces, which represent the communication bridge between nervous system and neuroprosthetic device by controlling its movements and evoking sensory feedback. Compared to extraneural electrodes (i.e., epineural and perineural implants), intraneural electrodes, implanted within peripheral nerves, have higher selectivity and specificity of neural signal recording and nerve stimulation. However, being implanted in the nerve, their main limitation is represented by the significant inflammatory response that the body mounts around the probe, known as Foreign Body Reaction (FBR), which may hinder their rapid clinical translation. Furthermore, the mechanical mismatch between the consistency of the device and the surrounding neural tissue may contribute to exacerbate the inflammatory state. The FBR is a non-specific reaction of the host immune system to a foreign material. It is characterized by an early inflammatory phase eventually leading to the formation of a fibrotic capsule around intraneural interfaces, which increases the electrical impedance over time and reduces the chronic interface biocompatibility and functionality. Thus, the future in the reduction and control of the FBR relies on innovative biomedical strategies for the fabrication of next-generation neural interfaces, such as the development of more suitable designs of the device with smaller size, appropriate stiffness and novel conductive and biomimetic coatings for improving their long-term stability and performance.

677402,The concept of an e-platform cooperation model in the field of 3D printing during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021-12-31,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) are caused by two closely related beta-coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, respectively. The envelopes surrounding these viruses are decorated with spike proteins, whose receptor binding domains (RBDs) initiate invasion by binding to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Subtle changes at the interface with ACE2 seem to be responsible for the enhanced affinity for the receptor of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD compared to SARS-CoV RBD. Here, we use Elastic Network Models (ENMs) to study the response of the viral RBDs and ACE2 upon dissassembly of the complexes. We identify a dominant detachment mode, in which the RBD rotates away from the surface of ACE2, while the receptor undergoes a conformational transition which stretches the active-site cleft. Using the Structural Perturbation Method, we determine the network of residues, referred to as the Allostery Wiring Diagram (AWD), which drives the large-scale motion activated by the detachment of the complex. The AWD for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are remarkably similar, showing a network that spans the interface of the complex and reaches the active site of ACE2, thus establishing an allosteric connection between RBD binding and receptor catalytic function. Informed in part by the AWD, we used Molecular Dynamics simulations to probe the effect of interfacial mutations in which SARS-CoV-2 residues are replaced by their SARS-CoV counterparts. We focused on a conserved glycine (G502 in SARS-CoV-2, G488 in SARS-CoV) because it belongs to a region that initiates the dissociation of the complex along the dominant detachment mode, and is prominent in the AWD. Molecular Dynamics simulations of SARS-CoV-2 wild-type and G502P mutant show that the affinity for the human receptor of the mutant is drastically diminished. Our results suggest that in addition to residues that are in direct contact with the interface those involved in long range allosteric communication are also a determinant of the stability of the RBD-ACE2 complex.","Mugnai, Mauro L.; Templeton, Clark; Elber, Ron; Thirumalai, D.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.30.405340; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33299995/,360

Our goal is to increase the radiologist’s knowledge of myositis and other urgent muscle disorders encountered in the emergent or urgent setting. We review the clinical presentation, the MRI appearance, and the complications that can be associated with these entities. Since myositis can affect multiple muscle compartments, we review how to differentiate the compartments of the appendicular skeletal in order to generate reports that relay important anatomic information to the treating physician. Given the poor sensitivity and positive predictive value of the clinical signs and symptoms used to diagnosing acute compartment syndrome, we discuss the potential use of MRI in cases of suspected but clinically equivocal compartment syndrome in the future.","Wasserman, Paul L.; Way, Ashley; Baig, Saif; Gopireddy, Dheeraj Reddy",Emerg Radiol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10140-020-01866-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33169179/,360

679996,Soft Law Governance in Times of Coronavirus in Spain,2021-02-09,"Many studies address the effect of the COVID-19 restrictions on food consumption and health, focusing on one or two measurements. Whether or not any effects are permanent or change over a longer period of restrictions has not been assessed in such studies. This study presented a survey containing questions on food consumption, exercise and self-assessed physical and mental health, repeatedly for six times over a 20-week period (July to November 2020) to a representative sample of 258 Dutch consumers. The majority of consumers reported no change in food consumption compared to before the COVID-19 restrictions, two smaller groups report a change to a more, or a less, healthy choice. This trend appears stable over the course of the measurements. The ‘healthy changers’ seem to couple a healthy and more diverse diet to healthy exercise habits, in contrast to the ‘unhealthy changers’. No change was observed in self-assessed physical health over the measurements. Overall a decline in time spent exercising showed, as well as a decline in self-assessed mental health. Clearly a lockdown situation affects food choice, exercise habits and (self-assessed) mental health. The fact that habits are able to suddenly change, for better or for worse, and that a decrease in mental health was reported, suggests that such insights need to be further explored to help individual consumers retain a healthy diet and lifestyle, and governments devise effective public health recommendations.","Dijksterhuis, Garmt B.; van Bergen, Geertje; de Wijk, René A.; Zandstra, Elizabeth H.; Kaneko, Daisuke; Vingerhoeds, Monique",Appetite,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195666321006279?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0195666321006279; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2021.105720; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34597741/,360

The SARS CoV‐2 is transmitted more rapidly and readily than SARS CoV. Both, SARS CoV and SARS CoV‐2 via their glycosylated spike proteins recognize the human angiotensin converting enzyme‐2 (ACE‐2) receptor. We generated multiple sequence alignments and phylogenetic trees for representative spike proteins of SARS CoV and SARS CoV‐2 from various host sources in order to analyze the specificity in SARS CoV‐2 spike proteins required for causing infection in humans. Our results show that among the genomes analysed, two sequence regions in the N‐terminal domain (NTD); ""MESEFR"" and ""SYLTPG"" are specific to human SARS CoV‐2. In the receptor binding domain (RBD), two sequence regions; ""VGGNY"" and ""EIYQAGSTPCNGV"" and a disulfide bridge connecting 480C and 488C in the extended loop are structural determinants for the recognition of human ACE‐2 receptor. The complete genome analysis of representative SARS CoVs from bat, civet, human host sources and human SARS CoV‐2 identified the bat genome (GenBank code: MN996532.1) as closest to the recent novel human SARS CoV‐2 genomes. The bat SARS CoV genomes (GenBank codes: MG772933 and MG772934) are evolutionary intermediates in the mutagenesis progression towards becoming human SARS CoV‐2.

681585,Resolution of the major poliovirus capsid polypeptides into doublets,1978-05-15,"CONTEXT: No information is available on oncology patients’ level of stress and symptom burden during the COVID-19 pandemic. We evaluated for differences in demographic and clinical characteristics, levels of social isolation and loneliness, and the occurrence and severity of common symptoms between oncology patients with low versus high levels of COVID-19 and cancer-related stress. In addition, we determined which of these characteristics were associated with membership in the high stressed group. METHODS: – Patients were >18 years of age; had a diagnosis of cancer; and were able to complete an online survey. RESULTS: Of the 187 patients in this study, 31.6% were categorized in the stressed group (Impact of Event Scale –Revised (IES-R score of >24)). Stressed group’s IES-R score exceeds previous benchmarks in oncology patients and equates with probable PTSD. In this stressed group, patients reported occurrence rates for depression (71.2%), anxiety (78.0%), sleep disturbance (78.0%), evening fatigue (55.9%), cognitive impairment (91.5%), and pain (75.9%). Symptom severity scores equate with clinically meaningful levels for each symptom. CONCLUSIONS: – We identified alarmingly high rates of stress and an extraordinarily high symptom burden among cancer patients, exceeding those previously benchmarked in this population and on par with non-cancer patients with PTSD. Given that the COVID19 pandemic will likely impact cancer care for an indefinite period of time, clinicians must exhibit increased vigilance in their assessments of patients’ level of stress and symptom burden. Moreover, an increase in referrals to appropriate supportive care resources must be prioritized for high risk patients.","Miaskowski, Christine; Paul, Steven M.; Snowberg, Karin; Abbott, Maura; Borno, Hala; Chang, Susan; Chen, Lee May; Cohen, Bevin; Hammer, Marilyn J.; Kenfield, Stacey A.; Kober, Kord M.; Levine, Jon D.; Pozzar, Rachel; Rhoads, Kim F.; Van Blarigan, Erin L.; Van Loon, Katherine",J Pain Symptom Manage,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0885392420307247; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0885392420307247?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32889039/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2020.08.037,360

The objectives of the study were to evaluate the incidence, risk factors and impact of AKI in subjects hospitalized for COVID-19 in two third- level hospitals in Cordoba, Argentina. A retrospective cohort study was conducted. 448 adults who were consecutively hospitalized for COVID-19 between March and the end of October 2020 at Hospital Privado Universitario de Cordoba and Hospital Raul Angel Ferreyra were included. The incidence of AKI was 19% (n=85). 50.6% presented AKI stage 1 (n=43), 20% stage 2 (n=17) and 29.4% stage 3 (n=25, of which 18 required renal replacement therapy). In the multivariate analysis, the variables that were independently associated with AKI were: age (adjusted Odd ratio -aOR- =1.30, 95%CI=1.04-1.63, p=0.022), history of chronic kidney disease (aOR=9.92, 95%CI=4.52-21.77, p<0.001), blood neutrophil count at admission (aOR=1.09, 95%CI=1.01-1.18, p=0.037) and requirement for mechanical ventilation (MV) (aOR=6.69, 95%CI=2.24-19.9, p=0.001).

685961,Coronavirus pandemic and spirituality in southwest Nigeria: A sociological analysis,2021-03-15,"BACKGROUND: Young adults are overrepresented in terms of adverse mental health problems related to COVID-19. Emerging work has identified worry about the consequences and trajectory of COVID-19 and loneliness as important factors in mental health during the pandemic. However, the main and interactive effects of worry about COVID-19 and loneliness have not been explored in one overarching model in relation to mental health problems among young adults. METHODS: The present study therefore evaluated loneliness and COVID-19 related worry in terms of anxiety, stress, and depression among young adults (209 college students, 76.1% female, M(age) = 22.99 years, SD = 5.25) recruited to participate in an online survey study. RESULTS: Results indicated a significant interaction between COVID-19 worry and loneliness for each criterion variable (depression: b = .01, SE = .003, t = 2.86, p = .01; anxiety: b = .01, SE = .002, t = 2.36, p = .02; stress: b = .01, SE = .003, t = 2.54, p = .01), such that worry was more strongly related to each mental health outcome among those that endorsed higher levels of loneliness. CONCLUSION: The current findings suggest loneliness is related to negative mental health symptoms among young adults experiencing COVID-19 related worry. The current findings provide initial empirical evidence for the impact of COVID-19 worry on mental health among young adults experiencing loneliness.

687567,Topic detection and sentiment analysis in Twitter content related to COVID-19 from Brazil and the USA,2020-12-26,"SARS-CoV2 infects respiratory epithelial cells via its cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, causing a viral pneumonia with pronounced inflammation resulting in significant damage to the lungs and other organ systems, including the kidneys, though symptoms and disease severity are quite variable depending on the intensity of exposure and presence of underlying conditions that may affect the immune response. The resulting disease, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), can cause multi-organ system dysfunction in patients requiring hospitalisation and intensive care treatment. Serious infections like COVID-19 often negatively affect nutritional status, and the resulting nutritional deficiencies may increase disease severity and impair recovery. One example is the viral infection measles, where associated vitamin A (VA) deficiency increases disease severity and appropriately timed supplementation during recovery reduces mortality and hastens recovery. VA may play a similar role in COVID-19. First, VA is important in maintaining innate and adaptive immunity to promote clearance of a primary infection as well as minimise risks from secondary infections. Second, VA plays a unique role in the respiratory tract, minimising damaging inflammation, supporting repair of respiratory epithelium and preventing fibrosis. Third, VA deficiency may develop during COVID-19 due to specific effects on lung and liver stores caused by inflammation and impaired kidney function, suggesting that supplements may be needed to restore adequate status. Fourth, VA supplementation may counteract adverse effects of SARS-CoV2 on the angiotensin system as well as minimises adverse effects of some COVID-19 therapies. Evaluating interactions of SARS-CoV2 infection with VA metabolism may thus provide improved COVID-19 therapy.","Stephensen, C.

Cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2 depends on the binding of its spike protein to a cellular receptor named angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and the subsequent spike protein-priming by host cell proteases, including transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2). Thus, high expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are considered to enhance the invading capacity of SARS-CoV-2. Methods To elucidate the underlying histological mechanisms of the aerodigestive disorders caused by SARS-CoV-2, we investigated the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 proteins in the aerodigestive tracts of the tongue, hard palate with partial nasal tissue, larynx with hypopharynx, trachea, esophagus, lung, and kidney of rats through immunohistochemistry. Results Strong co-expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 proteins was observed in the nasal respiratory epithelium, trachea, bronchioles, alveoli, kidney, and taste buds of the tongue. Remarkably, TMPRSS2 expression was much stronger in the peripheral alveoli than in the central alveoli. These results coincide with the reported clinical symptoms of COVID-19, such as the loss of taste, loss of olfaction, respiratory dysfunction, and acute nephropathy. Conclusions A wide range of organs have been speculated to be affected by SARS-CoV-2 depending on the expression levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2. Differential distribution of TMPRSS2 in the lung indicated the COVID-19 symptoms to possibly be exacerbated by TMPRSS2 expression. This study might provide potential clues for further investigation of the pathogenesis of COVID-19.

Patients with hematologic malignancies typically are known to have higher levels of immunosuppression and may develop more severe respiratory viral infections than patients with solid tumors. Data on COVID-19 in patients with hematologic malignancies are limited. Here we characterize disease severity and mortality and evaluate potential prognostic factors for mortality. METHODS: In this population-based registry study, we collected de-identified data on clinical characteristics, treatment and outcomes in adult patients with hematologic malignancies and confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection within the Madrid region of Spain. Our case series included all patients admitted to 22 regional health service hospitals and 5 private healthcare centers between February 28 and May 25, 2020. The primary study outcome was all-cause mortality. We assessed the association between mortality and potential prognostic factors using Cox regression analyses adjusted for age, sex, comorbidities, hematologic malignancy and recent active cancer therapy. RESULTS: Of 833 patients reported, 697 were included in the analyses. Median age was 72 years (IQR 60–79), 413 (60%) patients were male and 479 (69%) and 218 (31%) had lymphoid and myeloid malignancies, respectively. Clinical severity of COVID-19 was severe/critical in 429 (62%) patients. At data cutoff, 230 (33%) patients had died. Age ≥ 60 years (hazard ratios 3.17–10.1 vs < 50 years), > 2 comorbidities (1.41 vs ≤ 2), acute myeloid leukemia (2.22 vs non-Hodgkin lymphoma) and active antineoplastic treatment with monoclonal antibodies (2·02) were associated with increased mortality; conventional chemotherapy showed borderline significance (1.50 vs no active therapy). Conversely, Ph-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (0.33) and active treatment with hypomethylating agents (0.47) were associated with lower mortality. Overall, 574 (82%) patients received antiviral therapy. Mortality with severe/critical COVID-19 was higher with no therapy vs any antiviral combination therapy (2.20). CONCLUSIONS: In this series of patients with hematologic malignancies and COVID-19, mortality was associated with higher age, more comorbidities, type of hematological malignancy and type of antineoplastic therapy.

In this study, we aimed to assess the pandemic’s effect on women’s COVID-19-related publishing over the first year of the pandemic. METHODS AND RESULTS: We compared the gender distribution of first authorships for 42 898 publications on COVID-19 from 1 February 2020 to 31 January 2021 to 483 232 publications appearing in the same journals during the same period the year prior. We found that the gender gap—the percentage of articles on which men versus women were first authors—widened by 14 percentage points during the COVID-19 pandemic, despite many pertinent research fields showing near equal proportions of men and women first authors publishing in the same fields before the pandemic. Longitudinal analyses revealed that the significant initial expansions of the gender gap began to trend backwards to expected values over time in many fields. As women may have been differentially affected depending on their geography, we also assessed the gender distribution of first authorships grouped by countries and geographical areas. While we observed a significant reduction of the shares of women first authors in almost all countries, longitudinal analyses confirmed a resolving trend over time. CONCLUSION: The reduction in women’s COVID-19-related research output appears particularly concerning as many disciplines informing the response to the pandemic had near equal gender shares of first authorship in the year prior to the pandemic. The acute productivity drain with the onset of the pandemic magnifies deep-rooted obstacles on the way to gender equity in scientific contribution.","Lerchenmüller, Carolin; Schmallenbach, Leo; Jena, Anupam B; Lerchenmueller, Marc J",BMJ Open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-045176; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33820790/,360
