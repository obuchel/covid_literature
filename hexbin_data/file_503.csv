Large number of plants has been shown to be active in vitro against a variety of human pathogenic viruses or their near congeners. In several cases the active compounds have been isolated and characterized. Very few of them, however, have been investigated in detail in vivo or taken to the clinic. Pure compounds like andrographolide, curcumin and glycyrrhizic acid as well as extracts of Azadirachta indica have shown activity against several viruses and should be investigated further for their therapeutic potential. An analysis of available data from several hundred species indicates that antiviral activity is more likely to be found in plants belonging to certain families.

Research in word processing has used acronyms as a tool to answer fundamental questions such as the nature of the word superiority effect (WSE) or which is the best way to account for word-reading processes. In this study, acronym naming was assessed by looking at the influence that a number of variables known to affect mainstream word processing has had in acronym naming. The nature of the effect of these factors on acronym naming was examined using a multilevel regression analysis. First, 146 acronyms were described in terms of their age of acquisition, bigram and trigram frequencies, imageability, number of orthographic neighbors, frequency, orthographic and phonological length, print-to-pronunciation patterns, and voicing characteristics. Naming times were influenced by lexical and sublexical factors, indicating that acronym naming is a complex process affected by more variables than those previously considered.","Izura, Cristina; Playfoot, David",Behav Res Methods,503,22

Noninvasive oxygenation strategies such as high-flow nasal cannula, standard oxygen therapy, and noninvasive ventilation (delivered by either face mask or helmet interface) are widely available interventions applied in these patients. It remains unclear which of these interventions are more effective in decreasing rates of invasive mechanical ventilation and mortality. The primary objective of this network meta-analysis is to summarize the evidence and compare the effect of noninvasive oxygenation strategies on mortality and need for invasive mechanical ventilation in patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. METHODS: We will search key databases for randomized controlled trials assessing the effect of noninvasive oxygenation strategies in adult patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. We will exclude studies in which the primary focus is either acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cardiogenic pulmonary edema. The primary outcome will be all-cause mortality (longest available up to 90 days). The secondary outcomes will be receipt of invasive mechanical ventilation (longest available up to 30 days). We will assess the risk of bias for each of the outcomes using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. Bayesian network meta-analyses will be conducted to obtain pooled estimates of head-to-head comparisons. We will report pairwise and network meta-analysis treatment effect estimates as risk ratios and 95% credible intervals. Subgroup analyses will be conducted examining key populations including immunocompromised hosts. Sensitivity analyses will be conducted by excluding those studies with high risk of bias and different etiologies of acute respiratory failure. We will assess certainty in effect estimates using GRADE methodology. DISCUSSION: This study will help to guide clinical decision-making when caring for adult patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and improve our understanding of the limitations of the available literature assessing noninvasive oxygenation strategies in acute hypoxemic respiratory failure.

All surgically treated patients with CDE or Bochdalek type CDH between 2000 and 2016 were included in this retrospective analysis. Demographics, CDH-characteristics, treatment, and clinical outcome were evaluated. In total, 200 patients were included. Patients with an eventration or hernia sac had no significant differences and were compared as patients without a true defect to patients with a true defect. The 1-year survival of patients with a true defect was significantly lower than patients with no true defect (76% versus 97%, p = 0.001). CDH with no true defect had significantly better short-term outcomes than CDH with true defect requiring patch repair. However, at 30 days, they more often required oxygen supplementation (46% versus 26%, p = 0.03) and had a higher recurrence rate (8% versus 0%, p = 0.006) (three eventration and two hernia sac patients). Conclusion: Patients without a true defect seem to have a more similar clinical outcome than CDH patients with a true defect, with a better survival. However, the recurrence rate and duration of oxygen supplementation at 30 days are higher than CDH patients with a true defect.","Heiwegen, Kim; van Heijst, Arno FJ; Daniels-Scharbatke, Horst; van Peperstraten, Michelle CP; de Blaauw, Ivo; Botden, Sanne MBI",Eur J Pediatr,503,22

Achieving universal health coverage (UHC) requires universal access to essential health information. While it was recently recognised by the World Medical Association, universal access to essential health information is not yet reflected in official monitoring of progress on UHC for the sustainable development goals (SDGs). In this paper, we outline key features that characterise universal access to essential health information and indicate how it is increasingly achievable. We highlight the growing evidence of the impact of wider access to practical and actionable information on health for the public, carers and frontline health workers and provide illustrative, evidence-based, examples of how increasing access to essential health information can accelerate the achievement of UHC and other health targets of the SDGs. The paper ends with an assessment of reasons why universal access to essential health information has not yet been achieved, and an associated call to action to key stakeholders—such as governments, multilaterals, funding bodies, policy-makers, health professionals and knowledge intermediaries—to explicitly recognise the foundational role of universal access to essential health information for achieving UHC and the rest of the health SDGs, to include it in the relevant SDG target and associated monitoring indicators, and to incorporate actions in their own policies and programmes to promote and enable this access.","Royston, Geoff; Pakenham-Walsh, Neil; Zielinski, Chris",BMJ Glob Health,503,22

The expression of light chain 3B (LC3B) and CD8(+)/CD39(+) was found to be significantly lower in HSCC tissues than in adjacent non-tumor mucosa tissue samples; LC3B expression was positively correlated with the infiltration rate of CD8(+)/CD39(+) in HSCC. Further studies revealed that the ratio of CD8(+)/CD39(+) immune cells was negatively correlated with tumor lymph node metastasis and TNM classification, while the ratio of CD8(+)/CD163(+) immune cells was negatively correlated with TNM classification. Moreover, the expression of LC3B was analyzed and the patients were grouped according to their immune infiltration characteristics. The 5-year cumulative survival rates of LC3B(+), CD8(+)/CD39(+), and CD8(+)/CD163(+) patients were significantly higher than those of other group patients. Collectively, our studies indicated that the expression of LC3B in HSCC was correlated with the infiltration ratio of immune cells, and a change in autophagy activity may affect the cellular immunity in HSCC.

Current approaches focus on objective measures, such as nurses per occupied bed or patient classification. However, staff numbers do not tell the whole staffing story. The subjective measure of nurses’ perceived adequacy of staffing (PAS) has the potential to enhance nurse staffing methods in a way that goes beyond traditional workload measurement or workforce planning methods. OBJECTIVES: To detect outcomes associated with nurses’ PAS and the factors that influence PAS and to review the psychometric properties of instruments used to measure PAS in a hospital setting. DESIGN AND METHODS: A scoping review was performed to identify outcomes associated with PAS, factors influencing PAS and instruments measuring PAS. A search of PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Business Source Complete and Embase databases identified 2609 potentially relevant articles. Data were independently extracted, analysed and synthesised. The quality of studies describing influencing factors or outcomes of PAS and psychometric properties of instruments measuring PAS were assessed following the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence quality appraisal checklist and the COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments guidelines. RESULTS: Sixty-three studies were included, describing 60 outcomes of PAS, 79 factors influencing PAS and 21 instruments measuring PAS. In general, positive PAS was related to positive outcomes for the patient, nurse and organisation, supporting the relevance of PAS as a staffing measure. We identified a variety of factors that influence PAS, including demand for care, nurse supply and organisation of care delivery. Associations between these factors and PAS were inconsistent. The quality of studies investigating the development and evaluation of instruments measuring PAS was moderate. CONCLUSIONS: Measuring the PAS may enhance nurse staffing methods in a hospital setting.

Even though the application of machine learning (ML) in disease diagnosis is a very common and well-established field of research, its application in diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DSPN) diagnosis using composite scoring techniques like Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrumentation (MNSI), is very limited in the existing literature. Method: In this study, the MNSI data were collected from the Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications (EDIC) clinical trials. Two different datasets with different MNSI variable combinations based on the results from the eXtreme Gradient Boosting feature ranking technique were used to analyze the performance of eight different conventional ML algorithms. Results: The random forest (RF) classifier outperformed other ML models for both datasets. However, all ML models showed almost perfect reliability based on Kappa statistics and a high correlation between the predicted output and actual class of the EDIC patients when all six MNSI variables were considered as inputs. Conclusions: This study suggests that the RF algorithm-based classifier using all MNSI variables can help to predict the DSPN severity which will help to enhance the medical facilities for diabetic patients.","Haque, Fahmida; Bin Ibne Reaz, Mamun; Chowdhury, Muhammad Enamul Hoque; Srivastava, Geetika; Hamid Md Ali, Sawal; Bakar, Ahmad Ashrif A.; Bhuiyan, Mohammad Arif Sobhan",Diagnostics (Basel),503,22

The passive immunization of immune sera conferred protection in mice, as indicated by their potent parasite-specific antibody response, lessened brain cyst counts, lower bodyweight loss, and enhanced survival. In order to confirm that the immune sera of the VLP-immunized mice were truly protective, the antibody responses and other immunological parameters were measured in the VLP-immunized mice. We found that VLP immunization induced higher levels of parasite-specific IgG, IgG subclass, and IgM antibody responses in the sera and intestines than in the controls. Enhanced Th1 and Th2-associated cytokines in the spleen, diminished brain cyst counts, and lessened body weight loss were found following T. gondii ME49 challenge infection.

Physical health was measured by a self-rated health assessment. The results from an IV-ordered probit model show that the awareness of work value has a statistically significant impact on the self-rated physical health of rural-to-urban migrant workers. The results also show that the impacts of work value awareness on rural-to-urban migrant workers’ physical health are heterogeneous to genders and ages. Mental health plays a mediating role between the awareness of work value and the physical health of rural-to-urban migrant workers.

This study aimed to assess the capacity of dynamic flat-panel detector (FPD) imaging without the use of contrast media to estimate cardiovascular parameters based on image parameters of a porcine model under fluid loading. Three domestic pigs were intubated, and mechanical ventilation was provided using a ventilator under anesthesia. A porcine model involving circulatory changes induced by fluid loading (fluid infusion/blood removal) was developed. Sequential chest radiographs of the pigs were obtained using a dynamic FPD system within the first 5 min after fluid loading. Image parameters such as the size of the heart shadow and mean pixel values in the lungs were measured, and correlations between fluid loading and cardiovascular parameters (blood pressure [BP], cardiac output [CO], central venous pressure [CVP], and pulmonary arterial pressure [PAP]) were analyzed based on freedom-adjusted coefficients of determination (R(f)(2)). Fluid loading was correlated with radiographic lung density and the size of the heart shadow. Radiographic lung density was correlated with the left and right heart system-related parameters BP, CO, CVP, and PAP. The size of the heart shadow correlated with the left heart system-related parameters CO and BP.

The expansion of inosine-containing tRNAs in eukaryotes followed the transformation of the homodimeric bacterial enzyme TadA, which generates I34 in tRNA(Arg) and tRNA(Leu), into the heterodimeric eukaryotic enzyme ADAT, which modifies up to eight different tRNAs. The emergence of ADAT and its larger set of substrates, strongly influenced the tRNA composition and codon usage of eukaryotic genomes. However, the selective advantages that drove the expansion of I34-tRNAs remain unknown. Here we investigate the functional relevance of I34-tRNAs in human cells and show that a full complement of these tRNAs is necessary for the translation of low-complexity protein domains enriched in amino acids cognate for I34-tRNAs. The coding sequences for these domains require codons translated by I34-tRNAs, in detriment of synonymous codons that use other tRNAs. I34-tRNA-dependent low-complexity proteins are enriched in functional categories related to cell adhesion, and depletion in I34-tRNAs leads to cellular phenotypes consistent with these roles. We show that the distribution of these low-complexity proteins mirrors the distribution of I34-tRNAs in the phylogenetic tree.","Torres, Adrian Gabriel; Rodríguez-Escribà, Marta; Marcet-Houben, Marina; Santos Vieira, Helaine Graziele; Camacho, Noelia; Catena, Helena; Murillo Recio, Marina; Rafels-Ybern, Àlbert; Reina, Oscar; Torres, Francisco Miguel; Pardo-Saganta, Ana; Gabaldón, Toni; Novoa, Eva Maria; Ribas de Pouplana, Lluís",Nucleic Acids Res,503,22

To better characterize the multifaceted nature of IE management, we aimed to describe the occurrence and significance of pulmonary complications in IE, including among persons with IE related to drug use. METHODS: Hospitalizations of adult (≥18 years old) patients diagnosed with IE were identified in the 2016 National Inpatient Sample using ICD-10 codes. Multivariable logistic and linear regression were used to compare IE patient outcomes between those with and without pulmonary complications and to identify predictors of pulmonary complications. Interaction terms were used to assess the impact of drug-use IE (DU-IE) and pulmonary complications on inpatient outcomes. RESULTS: In 2016, there were an estimated 88,995 hospitalizations of patients diagnosed with IE. Of these hospitalizations,15,490 (17%) were drug-use related. Drug-use IE (DU-IE) had the highest odds of pulmonary complications (OR 2.97, 95% CI 2.50, 3.45). At least one pulmonary complication was identified in 6,580 (7%) of IE patients. DU-IE hospitalizations were more likely to have a diagnosis of pyothorax (3% vs. 1%, p<0.001), lung abscess (3% vs. <1%, p<0.001), and septic pulmonary embolism (27% vs. 2%, p<0.001). Pulmonary complications were associated with longer average lengths of stay (CIE 7.22 days 95% CI 6.11, 8.32), higher hospital charges (CIE 78.51 thousand dollars 95% CI 57.44, 99.57), more frequent post-discharge transfers (acute care: OR 1.37, 95% CI 1.09, 1.71; long-term care: OR 2.19, 95% CI 1.83, 2.61), and increased odds of inpatient mortality (OR 1.81 95% CI 1.39, 2.35). CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: IE with pulmonary complications is associated with worse outcomes. Patients with DU-IE have a particularly high prevalence of pulmonary complications that may require timely thoracic surgical intervention, likely owing to right-sided valve involvement. More research is needed to determine optimal management strategies for complications to improve patient outcomes.","Bui, Jenny T.; Schranz, Asher J.; Strassle, Paula D.; Agala, Chris B.; Mody, Gita N.; Ikonomidis, John S.; Long, Jason M.",PLoS One,503,22

METHODS: A mixed-method phased approach was conducted using document analysis and an online survey. Phase 1 examined 114 NIHR applicant feedback documents comprised written feedback from funding committees and external peer-reviewers and a conceptual framework of the key components of feedback was developed using content analysis. Phase 2 was an online survey completed by 113 NIHR applicants. Frequencies of responses to closed questions were calculated. Perceptions of quality and value of feedback were identified using content analysis of open-text responses. RESULTS: In phase 1, a conceptual framework was developed with seven overarching categories: ‘Study structure and quality’; ‘Team and infrastructure’; ‘Acceptability to patients and professionals’; ‘Study justification and design’; ‘Risks and contingencies’; ‘Outputs’; ‘Value for money’. A higher frequency of feedback was provided at stage 2 and for successful applications across the majority of components. In phase 2, frequency data showed that opinion on feedback was dependent on funding outcome. Content analysis revealed four main themes: ‘Committee transparency’; ‘Content validity and reliability’; ‘Additional support’; Recognition of effort and constraints’. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides key insights and understanding into the quality, content and value of feedback provided to NIHR applicants. The study identified key areas for improvement that can arise in NIHR funding applications, as well as in the feedback given to applicants that are applicable to other funding organisations. These findings could be used to inform funding application guidance documents to help researchers strengthen their applications and used more widely by other funders to inform their feedback processes.","Fackrell, Kathryn; Meadmore, Katie; Recio-Saucedo, Alejandra; Bull, Abby; Fraser, Simon; Blatch-Jones, Amanda",BMJ Open,503,22

Through mutations and gene reassortment, some strains of avian influenza viruses establish stable lineages in poultry species, pigs, horses, and humans. The first zoonotic influenza pandemic of the twenty-first century, the swine H1N1 pandemic of 2009, originated from Mexico, and fortunately the virus was only of modest virulence. However, lessons have been learned on the shortcomings of the global preparedness for influenza pandemic, and this should be considered as a valuable experience for the preparation of the next major outbreak. Of more concern is the emergence of the highly pathogenic avian influenza A [H5N1], ongoing since 1996, and the low pathogenic avian influenza A [H7N9], since 2013, which have crossed the species barrier to humans in China. Risks of a H5N1 pandemic appear to be receding with declining human cases, and the H7N9 influenza virus is now the leading candidate as the next pandemic influenza virus. However, influenza pandemics are unpredictable in their timing, specific strain of virus, and origin. Most experts predict that the next influenza pandemic will arise from Asia, especially China, and will be directly of avian origin. Continued influenza surveillance in animals and humans globally with prompt reporting to the WHO and the World Animal Health Organization with sharing of data promptly between countries is essential. Long-term solutions to prevent cross-species transmission of zoonotic influenza viruses to humans and development of more effective, longer-lasting vaccines against emerging avian influenza viruses are needed. Currently there is no evidence of an impending zoonotic or avian influenza pandemic, and the viruses of interest, H5N1 and H7N9 avian influenza A viruses, have not mutated to allow for easy transmission to humans nor human to human.","Fong, I.

By destabilizing the relationship between plant and human, Wyndham and Christopher open up a space to reconsider the vegetal as a distinct life form itself, beyond its instrumental use-value, or as an anthropomorphized reflection of human thought. Although plant life is traditionally defined by its inability to move or to speak, both writers suggest that communication bound to the visual or oral is highly limited (for instance, human sight is confined to a limited spectrum). In Wyndham’s The Day of the Triffids (1951) plants become mobile and seemingly sentient, in the process becoming an invasive presence that exposes and challenges the limits of anthropocentric thought. By contrast, in Christopher’s The Death of Grass (1956), the absence of the vegetal renders manifest the subaltern status of plant life, while suggesting that plants are able to communicate through their materiality and posture. Both texts signal that what is conventionally understood as Other is actually a blank repository that ventriloquizes humans’ unconscious desire. Following the population’s sudden loss of sight in The Day of the Triffids, the characters begin to project their own thoughts and emotions onto the triffids, which highlights the indeterminate limits of anthropomorphic representation. The Death of Grass demonstrates that such anthropocentrism constitutes an act of metaphysical violence that, at the same time, under-imagines plant life and installs specialist terminology and botanical classification as a substitute. Presenting the relationship between plant life and human life as a contested space, these texts manifest the problem of anthropocentric certainties and the absolute alterity of plant-thought.","Matthews, Graham J.",Plant Horror,503,1

While global air travel data represent the volume of travel between airports, identifying which airport an infected individual might use, or where a disease might spread after an infected passenger deplanes, remains a largely unexplored area of research and public health practice. This gap can be addressed by estimating airport catchment areas. This research aims to determine how existing market area delineation techniques estimate airport catchments differently, and which techniques are best suited to anticipate where infectious diseases may spread. Multiple techniques were tested for airports in the Province of Ontario, Canada: circular buffers, drive-time buffers, Thiessen polygons, and the Huff model, with multiple variations tested for some techniques. The results were compared qualitatively and quantitatively based on spatial patterns as well as area and population of each catchment area. There were notable differences, specifically between deterministic and probabilistic approaches. Deterministic techniques may only be suitable if all airports in a study area are similar in terms of attractiveness. The probabilistic Huff model appeared to produce more realistic results because it accounted for variation in airport attractiveness. Additionally, the Huff model requires few inputs and therefore would be efficient to execute in situations where time, resources, and data are limited.","Huber, Carmen; Rinner, Claus",Geospatial Technologies for Local and Regional Development,503,1

As previously discussed, infectious diseases of wild mammal populations can have significant economic impact, may threaten human and livestock health (Artois et al. 2001), and can affect the welfare and conservation of game (Gortazar et al. 2006) and species of high conservation value (Cleaveland et al. 2002). Wild mammals are also implicated as sources of emerging diseases (Daszak et al. 2000a; Cleaveland 2003; Cunningham 2005). Comprehensive epidemiological investigations and disease surveillance of wild mammal populations will enhance our capaCity to detect and control infectious diseases that may emerge in the future in human and domestic animal populations. Given that the majority of diseases that have emerged in the last couple of decades had a wildlife origin (see Chapter 1), surveillance for wildlife diseases may be seen as an essential tool for the protection of human health. For these reasons, the development of effective programmes for the surveillance of disease in wildlife populations is becoming increasingly important. Epidemiological investigations in wildlife are similar in many respects in terms of their objectives, concepts and methodology to those undertaken for domestic animal health surveillance and monitoring. However, there are also substantial differences, owing to the zoological, behavioural and ecological characteristics of wildlife populations. Consequently, definitions, methods and procedures must often be adapted to suit the unique conditions of wildlife disease surveillance.","Artois, Marc; Bengis, Roy; Delahay, Richard J.; Duchêne, Marie-José; Duff, J.

Anticonvulsants such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, lamotrigine, and phenobarbital as well as allopurinol and sulfonamides, are the most common causes of DIDMOHS. Impaired drug detoxification and herpes virus reactivation play a key role in DIDMOHS pathogenesis. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) haplotypes also contribute. Early cutaneous findings generally include a morbilliform eruption characterized by diffuse, erythematous, pruritic macules across the face, upper trunk, and upper extremities with later extension to the lower extremities. Rapid confluence and progression are characteristic. DIDMOHS frequently involves the lymphatic, hematologic, and hepatic systems. Renal, pulmonary, and cardiac dysfunction may also ensue. Early recognition and diagnosis with prompt withdrawal of the culprit drug is paramount. Corticosteroid therapy is widely accepted as the cornerstone of DIDMOHS management. Moving forward, haplotyping and assays such as the lymphocyte transformation test (LTT) will aid in the primary prevention and diagnosis of DIDMOHS.

Viral infections have been transmitted via tissue allografts such as bone, skin, cornea, and heart valves. Bone allografts have transmitted hepatitis C, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1), and human T-cell leukaemia virus. Corneas have transmitted rabies, hepatitis B virus, cytomegalovirus (CMV), and herpes simplex virus. Heart valves have been implicated in transmitting hepatitis B. HIV-1 and CMV have been transmitted by skin allografts. Use of comprehensive donor eligibility criteria; excluding potential donors with behaviours risky for HIV-1 and hepatitis infection, and donor blood testing have greatly reduced the risk. Recent reports of HIV transmitted from a seronegative donors prompts the addition of viral nucleic acid testing of the donor. During tissue processing, many allografts are exposed to disinfectants and sterilisation steps such as gamma irradiation, which further reduce or remove the risk of transmitted disease. Some viruses are fairly resistant to gamma irradiation and the high doses needed may be harmful to the tissue allografts. Because the effectiveness of some tissue grafts depends on cellular viability, not all can be subjected to sterilisation steps, and, therefore, the risk of infectious disease transmission remains. For these, preventing the transmission of viral infection relies mostly on careful donor selection and viral testing, but processing with mild disinfectant can be useful. To further assure safety in the use of allografts, the physician and hospital should select tissue banks that follow national professional standards as their source for allografts.","Eastlund, Ted",Sterilisation of Tissues Using Ionising Radiations,503,22

Trump’s management style, as described in his Art of the Deal, combines a fetishizing of entrepreneurial risk as a “lifestyle” with the insistence that it is not the entrepreneur but his targets who are ultimately exposed to risk. This suggests that we might understand the elevation of “deal-making” to a lifestyle as a characteristic of modernity that, with neoliberalism, is increasingly coming to the fore. Such a critique of modernity, I further argue, is anticipated by Fichte’s Closed Commercial State with its intriguing dialectic of risk. I conclude by arguing that Trump’s politics marks the rise of a new, specifically American style of Fascism—one that demands identification not with the state as supra-individual collective, but with an impersonal system governing over individual lives and rendering them precarious.","Adler, Anthony Curtis",Fudan J,503,22

Two algorithms were proposed in literature to compute granular counting: exact granular counting, with quadratic time complexity, and approximate granular counting, with linear time complexity. This paper extends approximate granular counting by computing bounds for exact granular count. In this way, the efficiency of approximate granular count is combined with certified bounds whose width can be adjusted in accordance to user needs.","Mencar, Corrado",Information Processing and Management of Uncertainty in Knowledge-Based Systems,503,22

A particular emphasis is put on several architectural aspects accounted for and object class hierarchies defined during the development of the tool. Next one of the main modules composing the tool under development is further described. Finally, as a means of illustration, the use of the FEM based tool for simulating two-dimensional laminar flows is discussed. More specifically, canonical configurations widely studied in the past are firstly accounted for. A more practical application involving the simulation of a mineral-slurry handling device is then studied using the power-law rheological model. The results from the simulations carried out highlight the usefulness of the tool for realistically predicting the associated flow behavior.

The field is attracting ever-increasing attention from both academic and private sectors, as testified by the recent demonstration of quantum supremacy in practice. However, the intrinsic restriction to linear operations significantly limits the range of relevant use cases for the application of Quantum Computing. In this work, we introduce a novel variational algorithm for quantum Single Layer Perceptron. Thanks to the universal approximation theorem, and given that the number of hidden neurons scales exponentially with the number of qubits, our framework opens to the possibility of approximating any function on quantum computers. Thus, the proposed approach produces a model with substantial descriptive power, and widens the horizon of potential applications already in the NISQ era, especially the ones related to Quantum Artificial Intelligence. In particular, we design a quantum circuit to perform linear combinations in superposition and discuss adaptations to classification and regression tasks. After this theoretical investigation, we also provide practical implementations using various simulation environments.

Understanding patients' hematologic findings in SARS-CoV-2 infection is essential to doing their prognosis, so adjusting care and improving outcomes. Objective: In this review, we aim at summarizing changes in the hematopoietic system and hemostasis that occur in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Findings: COVID-19 infection is often associated with laboratory hematologic features that can have important clinical implications. Careful revision of baseline hematologic data at diagnosis can predict the severity of illness and help clinicians tailoring the approach and management of patients whose condition can be guarded or critical. The levels of hematologic markers like D-dimer, procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, viral load, inflammatory cytokines, differential blood cell count, and peripheral smear are fundamental for the prognosis. Studies have also shown an association between some of these markers and severe COVID-19 infection requiring admission to the intensive care unit or complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Since, so far, a vaccine is not available, prevention of the infection is based on the avoiding people affected and the spreading of the virus; the treatment, in the absence of an effective antiviral agent, is symptomatic, and, in addition to oxygen support, finds in the anti-inflammatory drugs and anticoagulation fundamental therapeutic lines. According to the American Society of Hematology (ASH), all hospitalized patients with COVID-19 should receive pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis with LMWH.","Kreidieh, Firas; Temraz, Sally",Mediterr J Hematol Infect Dis,503,8

To overcome this limitation, a recently validated psychophysical self-administered test was used, which can be performed remotely in the assessment of early-stage coronavirus disease 2019 patients. METHODS: Olfactory and gustatory functions were objectively assessed in 300 patients in the first 7 days from coronavirus disease 2019 symptom onset. RESULTS: Seventy per cent of the patients presented olfactory and/or gustatory disorders. The dysfunctions detected were mainly complete anosmia (47 per cent) or ageusia (38 per cent). A significant correlation was found between taste dysfunction and female gender (odds ratio = 1.936, p = 0.014) and fever (odds ratio = 2.132, p = 0.003).

We compared these with data of patients from the same period in 2018 and 2019. Also we made an analysis of those characteristics in each month in 2020. RESULTS: There was 51.4% decrease of STEMI patients admitted to hospital during the peak period of COVID-19 epidemic. The ratio of no reperfusion of STEMI patients is more than 10% higher in 2020 than 2018, 2019. The percentage of STEMI patients received fibrinolysis in 2020 was 2 to 3 times higher than that in 2018, 2019, while the volume of PPCI dropped by more than half. The mortality rate of whole cohort and perioperative was the highest in February 2020.

Primary outcomes were hospitalization and critical illness (intensive care, mechanical ventilation, hospice and/or death). We conducted multivariable logistic regression to identify risk factors for adverse outcomes, and maximum information gain decision tree classifications to identify key splitters. Results: Among 4,103 Covid-19 patients, 1,999 (48.7%) were hospitalized, of whom 981/1,999 (49.1%) have been discharged home, and 292/1,999 (14.6%) have died or were discharged to hospice. Of 445 patients requiring mechanical ventilation, 162/445 (36.4%) have died. Strongest hospitalization risks were age [≥]75 years (OR 66.8, 95% CI, 44.7-102.6), age 65-74 (OR 10.9, 95% CI, 8.35-14.34), BMI>40 (OR 6.2, 95% CI, 4.2-9.3), and heart failure (OR 4.3 95% CI, 1.9-11.2).

Here, we present the first observational data supporting natural hybridization between the critically endangered purple-faced langur (Semnopithecus vetulus philbricki) and the threatened tufted gray langur (Semnopithecus priam thersites) in Kaludiyapokuna Forest Reserve in Sri Lanka. In one case study, we observed a long-term (> 1 year) mixed-species group consisting of one adult tufted gray langur male coexisting with seven adult purple-faced females. Although copulations were not observed, two infants were conceived during the male’s tenure, and the coat color of one of these infants transitioned into that intermediate between those of the two langur species. The tufted gray langur male was also aggressive toward extra-group males of both species, as well as towards purple-faced juveniles within his group. However, we never witnessed the male exhibiting aggression towards the infants conceived during his tenure. In a second case study, a female purple-faced langur visited and sexually solicited a tufted gray langur male in a known study group of this species over the course of 2 days, in what resembled a sexual consortship. Taken together, the observed mixed-species association and attempted interspecific mating suggest that hybridization is very likely in these sympatric species. Genetic data are needed to confirm and determine the extent of hybridization in the dry zone of Sri Lanka where purple-faced langurs live in sympatry with tufted gray langurs.","Lu, Amy; Sirimanna, Don Geethal Ramyanath; Wijayathunga, Lasanthi; Vandercone, Rajnish; Salmi, Roberta",Primates,503,5

Though quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) is the method of choice for COVID-19 diagnostics, the resource-intensive and time-consuming nature of the technique impairs its wide applicability in resource-constrained settings and calls for novel strategies to meet the ever-growing demand for more testing. In this context, a pooled sample testing strategy was evaluated in the setting of emerging disease outbreak in 3 central Indian districts to assess if the cost of the test and turn-around time could be reduced without compromising its diagnostic characteristics and thus lead to early containment of the outbreak. From 545 nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal samples received from the three emerging districts, a total of 109 pools were created with 5 consecutive samples in each pool. The diagnostic performance of qRT-PCR on pooled sample was compared with that of individual samples in a blinded manner. While pooling reduced the cost of diagnosis by 68% and the laboratory processing time by 66%, 5 of the 109 pools showed discordant results when compared with induvial samples. Four pools which tested negative contained 1 positive sample and 1 pool which was positive did not show any positive sample on deconvolution. Presence of a single infected sample with Ct value of 34 or higher, in a pool of 5, was likely to be missed in pooled sample analysis. At the reported point prevalence of 4.8% in this study, the negative predictive value of qRT-PCR on pooled samples was around 96% suggesting that the adoption of this strategy as an effective screening tool for COVID-19 needs to be carefully evaluated.","Singh, Anirudh K.; Nema, Ram Kumar; Joshi, Ankur; Shankar, Prem; Nema, Shashwati; Raghuwanshi, Arun; Patankar, Chitra; Mathew, Bijina J.; Shrivas, Arti; Pandey, Ritu; Tripathi, Ranu; Biswas, Debasis; Singh, Sarman",PLoS One,503,1

Their lengths range from 27,317 nt for HCoV-229E to 31,357 nt for the murine hepatitis virus-A59, establishing the coronavirus genome as the largest known among RNA viruses. The basic organization of the coronavirus genome is shared with other members of the Nidovirus order (the torovirus genus, also in the family Coronaviridae, and members of the family Arteriviridae) in that the nonstructural proteins involved in proteolytic processing, genome replication, and subgenomic mRNA synthesis (transcription) (an estimated 14–16 end products for coronaviruses) are encoded within the 5′-proximal two-thirds of the genome on gene 1 and the (mostly) structural proteins are encoded within the 3′-proximal one-third of the genome (8–9 genes for coronaviruses). Genes for the major structural proteins in all coronaviruses occur in the 5′ to 3′ order as S, E, M, and N. The precise strategy used by coronaviruses for genome replication is not yet known, but many features have been established. This chapter focuses on some of the known features and presents some current questions regarding genome replication strategy, the cis-acting elements necessary for genome replication [as inferred from defective interfering (DI) RNA molecules], the minimum sequence requirements for autonomous replication of an RNA replicon, and the importance of gene order in genome replication.","Brian, D.

In this work, we aimed to identify and analyze the scientific literature on Twitter use in context of health by utilizing a bibliometric approach, in order to obtain quantitative information on dominant research topics, trending themes, key publications, scientific institutions, and prolific researchers who contributed to this scientific area. Methods: Web of Science electronic database was searched to identify relevant papers on Twitter and health. Basic bibliographic data was obtained utilizing the “Analyze” function of the database. Full records and cited references were exported to VOSviewer, a dedicated bibliometric software, for further analysis. A term map and a keyword map were synthesized to visualize recurring words within titles, abstracts and keywords. Results: The analysis was based on the data from 2,582 papers. The first papers were published in 2009, and the publication count increased rapidly since 2015. Original articles and reviews were published in a ratio of 10.6:1. The Journal of Medical Internet Research was the top journal, and the United States had contributions to over half (52%) of these publications, being the home-country of eight of the top ten most productive institutions. Keyword analysis identified six topically defined clusters, with professional education in healthcare being the top theme cluster (consisting of 66 keywords). The identified papers often investigated Twitter together with other social media, such as YouTube and Facebook. Conclusions: A great diversity of themes was found in the identified papers, including: professional education in healthcare, big data and sentiment analysis, social marketing and substance use, physical and emotional well-being of young adults, and public health and health communication.

This study examined the association between locus of control and negative cognitive styles in adolescence and probable depression in young adulthood and whether parenthood moderated these associations. Using a UK prospective population-based birth cohort study: the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), we examined the association between external locus of control and negative cognitive styles in adolescence with odds of depression in 4,301 young adults using logistic regression models unadjusted and adjusted for potential confounding factors. Interaction terms were employed to examine whether parenthood (i.e., having become a parent or not) moderated these associations. Over 20% of young adults in our sample were at or above the clinical threshold indicating probable depression. For each standard deviation (SD) increase in external locus of control in adolescence, there was a 19% (95% CI: 8–32%) higher odds of having probable depression in young adulthood, after adjusting for various confounding factors including baseline mood and different demographic and life events variables. Similarly, for each SD increase in negative cognitive styles in adolescence, there was a 29% (95% CI: 16–44%) higher odds of having probable depression in the adjusted model. We found little evidence that parenthood status moderated the relationship between external locus of control or negative cognitive styles in adolescence and probable depression following adjustment for confounding factors. Effect estimates were comparable when performed in the complete case dataset. These findings suggest that having an external locus of control and holding negative cognitive styles in mid- to late adolescence is associated with an increased likelihood of probable depression in young adulthood.","Costantini, Ilaria; Kwong, Alex S.

METHODS: This narrative review discusses one of the primary mechanisms to initiate acute respiratory distress syndrome, uncontrolled systemic inflammation in COVID-19, and presents a potential candidate for adjuvant treatment. Blocking the S protein binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) and the 3C-like protease (3CL (pro)) is an effective strategy against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. RESULTS: Host proteases such as FURIN, trypsin, and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS) act in S protein activation. Tamarind trypsin inhibitor (TTI) shows several beneficial effects on the reduction of inflammatory markers (tumor necrosis factor α [TNF-α], leptin) and biochemical parameters (fasting glycemia, triglycerides, and very low-density lipoprotein [VLDL]), in addition to improving pancreatic function and mucosal integrity in an obesity model. TTI may inhibit the action of proteases that collaborate with SARS-CoV-2 infection and the neutrophil activity characteristic of lung injury promoted by the virus. CONCLUSION: Thus, TTI may contribute to combating two severe overlapping problems with high cost and social complex implications, obesity and COVID-19.","Morais, Ana H. de A.; de Medeiros, Amanda F.; Medeiros, Isaiane; de Lima, Vanessa C.

We numerically simulate the models for about five months period considering three critical parameters of COVID transmission mainly in the Sri Lankan context; efficacy of control measures, rate of overseas imported cases and time to introduce social distancing measures by the respective authorities.","Wickramaarachchi, Tharindu; Perera, Sanjeewa; Jayasinghe, Saroj",,503,16
