Dermatomyositis (DM) can be associated with glomerulonephritis due to the disease per se. We report a case of a 40-year-old male patient with DM who presented with acute kidney injury, and was initially pulsed with methylprednisolone for 3 days, followed by dexamethasone equivalent to 1 mg/kg/day prednisolone. He was subsequently found to have SAGN on kidney biopsy along with staphylococcus bacteraemia and left knee septic arthritis. With proof of definitive infection, intravenous immunoglobulin 2 g/kg over 2 days was given and steroids were reduced. He was treated with intravenous vancomycin. With treatment, the general condition of the patient improved. On day 38, he developed infective endocarditis and died of congestive heart failure subsequently. Undiagnosed staphylococcal sepsis complicating a rheumatological disease course can lead to complications like SAGN, infective endocarditis and contribute to increased morbidity and mortality, as is exemplified by our case.","Sahoo, Rasmi Ranjan; Pradhan, Sourav; Goel, Akhil Pawan; Wakhlu, Anupam",BMJ Case Rep,651,1
