2021,2021,2021,Assessing the Capacity of the US Health Care System to Use Additional Mechanical Ventilators During a Large-Scale Public Health Emergency,21.466175,1.0684692,2015-10-09,"OBJECTIVE: A large-scale public health emergency, such as a severe influenza pandemic, can generate large numbers of critically ill patients in a short time. We modeled the number of mechanical ventilators that could be used in addition to the number of hospital-based ventilators currently in use. METHODS: We identified key components of the health care system needed to deliver ventilation therapy, quantified the maximum number of additional ventilators that each key component could support at various capacity levels (ie, conventional, contingency, and crisis), and determined the constraining key component at each capacity level. RESULTS: Our study results showed that US hospitals could absorb between 26,200 and 56,300 additional ventilators at the peak of a national influenza pandemic outbreak with robust pre-pandemic planning. CONCLUSIONS: The current US health care system may have limited capacity to use additional mechanical ventilators during a large-scale public health emergency. Emergency planners need to understand their health care systems’ capability to absorb additional resources and expand care. This methodology could be adapted by emergency planners to determine stockpiling goals for critical resources or to identify alternatives to manage overwhelming critical care need.

3037,3037,3037,Revision of clinical case definitions: influenza-like illness and severe acute respiratory infection,21.71212,1.1468638,2018-02-01,"The formulation of accurate clinical case definitions is an integral part of an effective process of public health surveillance. Although such definitions should, ideally, be based on a standardized and fixed collection of defining criteria, they often require revision to reflect new knowledge of the condition involved and improvements in diagnostic testing. Optimal case definitions also need to have a balance of sensitivity and specificity that reflects their intended use. After the 2009–2010 H1N1 influenza pandemic, the World Health Organization (WHO) initiated a technical consultation on global influenza surveillance. This prompted improvements in the sensitivity and specificity of the case definition for influenza – i.e. a respiratory disease that lacks uniquely defining symptomology. The revision process not only modified the definition of influenza-like illness, to include a simplified list of the criteria shown to be most predictive of influenza infection, but also clarified the language used for the definition, to enhance interpretability. To capture severe cases of influenza that required hospitalization, a new case definition was also developed for severe acute respiratory infection in all age groups. The new definitions have been found to capture more cases without compromising specificity. Despite the challenge still posed in the clinical separation of influenza from other respiratory infections, the global use of the new WHO case definitions should help determine global trends in the characteristics and transmission of influenza viruses and the associated disease burden.","Fitzner, Julia; Qasmieh, Saba; Mounts, Anthony Wayne; Alexander, Burmaa; Besselaar, Terry; Briand, Sylvie; Brown, Caroline; Clark, Seth; Dueger, Erica; Gross, Diane; Hauge, Siri; Hirve, Siddhivinayak; Jorgensen, Pernille; Katz, Mark A; Mafi, Ali; Malik, Mamunur; McCarron, Margaret; Meerhoff, Tamara; Mori, Yuichiro; Mott, Joshua; Olivera, Maria Teresa da Costa; Ortiz, Justin R; Palekar, Rakhee; Rebelo-de-Andrade, Helena; Soetens, Loes; Yahaya, Ali Ahmed; Zhang, Wenqing; Vandemaele, Katelijn",Bull World Health Organ,334,9

However, a lack of understanding of the mechanism of action for these molecules limits further their development as anti-filoviral agents. Here we provide evidence that toremifene and other small molecule entry inhibitors have at least three distinctive mechanisms of action and lay the groundwork for future development of anti-filoviral agents. The three mechanisms identified here include: (1) direct binding to the internal fusion loop region of Ebola virus glycoprotein (GP); (2) the HR2 domain is likely the main binding site for Marburg virus GP inhibitors and a secondary binding site for some EBOV GP inhibitors; (3) lysosome trapping of GP inhibitors increases drug exposure in the lysosome and further improves the viral inhibition. Importantly, small molecules targeting different domains on GP are synergistic in inhibiting EBOV entry suggesting these two mechanisms of action are distinct. Our findings provide important mechanistic insights into filovirus entry and rational drug design for future antiviral development.","Schafer, Adam; Xiong, Rui; Cooper, Laura; Nowar, Raghad; Lee, Hyun; Li, Yangfeng; Ramirez, Benjamin E.; Peet, Norton P.; Caffrey, Michael; Thatcher, Gregory R.

This study aimed to identify the associations among BMSM between recent police harassment and psychosocial vulnerability, psychological distress, and depression measured six months later. Data come from the HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN) 061 Study, a cohort study of BMSM recruited in 6 U.S. cities (Atlanta, GA, Boston, MA, Los Angeles, CA, New York, NY, San Francisco, CA, and Washington DC). Participants completed baseline, 6-month follow-up, and 12-month follow-up interviews. A convenience sample of 1553 BMSM was recruited between July 2009 and October 2010 of whom 1155 returned for a follow-up interview 12 months later. Accounting for previous police interaction, poverty, psychopathology, drug use, and alcohol use, we estimated associations between recent police harassment reported at the 6 month follow-up interview and 12 month outcomes including psychosocial vulnerability (elevated racial/sexual identity incongruence), psychological distress (being distressed by experiences of racism and/or homophobia), and depression. About 60% of men reported experiencing police harassment between the baseline and 6-month interview due to their race and/or sexuality. Adjusted analyses suggested police harassment was independently associated with a 10.81 (95% CI: 7.97, 13.66) point increase and 8.68 (95% CI: 6.06, 11.30) point increase in distress due to experienced racism and distress due to experienced homophobia scores, respectively. Police harassment perceived to be dually motivated predicted disproportionate levels of distress. Police harassment is prevalent and associated with negative influences on psychosocial vulnerability and psychological distress among BMSM. Reducing exposure to police harassment may improve the psychosocial health of BMSM.","Remch, Molly; Duncan, Dustin T.; Geller, Amanda; Turpin, Rodman; Dyer, Typhanye; Scheidell, Joy D.; Cleland, Charles M.; Kaufman, Jay S.; Brewer, Russell; Hucks-Ortiz, Christopher; van der Mei, Willem; Mayer, Kenneth H.; Khan, Maria R.",SSM Popul Health,334,5

Factors Influencing Efficiency of Disaster Rescue.,21.839272,1.4680357,2018,"The structure of sodium saccharinate 1.875-hydrate is presented in three- and (3+1)-dimensional space. The present model is more accurate than previously published superstructures, due to an excellent data set collected up to a high resolution of 0.89 Å-1. The present study confirms the unusual complexity of the structure comprising a very large primitive unit cell with Z' = 16. A much smaller degree of correlated disorder of parts of the unit cell is found than is present in the previously published models. As a result of pseudo-symmetry, the structure can be described in a higher-dimensional space. The X-ray diffraction data clearly indicate a (3+1)-dimensional periodic structure with stronger main reflections and weaker superstructure reflections. Furthermore, the structure is established as being commensurate. The structure description in superspace results in a four times smaller unit cell with an additional base centring of the lattice, resulting in an eightfold substructure (Z' = 2) of the 3D superstructure. Therefore, such a superspace approach is desirable to work out this high-Z' structure. The displacement and occupational modulation of the saccharinate anions have been studied, as well as their conformational variation along the fourth dimension.","Rekis, Toms; Schönleber, Andreas; van Smaalen, Sander","Acta crystallographica Section B, Structural science, crystal engineering and materials",334,16

However, the design and use of multi-facial helix mimetics remains in its infancy. Here we describe the synthesis and application of novel bilaterally substituted p-terphenyl compounds containing positively-charged aminoalkyl groups in relative 1,4 positions across the aromatic scaffold. These compounds were specifically designed to mimic all faces of the arginine-rich α-helix of the HIV-1 protein Rev, which forms deeply embedded RNA complexes and plays key roles in the virus replication cycle. Two of these molecules recognized the Rev site in the viral RNA and inhibited the formation of the RRE-Rev ribonucleoprotein complex, a currently unexploited target in HIV chemotherapy. Cellular assays revealed that the most active compounds blocked HIV-1 replication with little toxicity, and likely exerted this effect through a multi-target mechanism involving inhibition of viral LTR promoter-dependent transcription and Rev function. Further development of this scaffold may open new avenues for targeting nucleic acids and may complement current HIV therapies, none of which involve inhibitors interfering with the gene regulation processes of the virus.","Medina-Trillo, Cristina; Sedgwick, Daniel M; Herrera, Lidia; Beltrán, Manuela; Moreno, Ángela; Barrio, Pablo; Bedoya, Luis M; Alcamí, José; Fustero, Santos; Gallego, José",Scientific reports,334,16

It is unclear what motivates solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients to participate and whether the games serve as an incentive for SOT recipients to increase their physical activity (PA) levels. OBJECTIVES 1. To describe the characteristics of participants from past games and their motivation for attending and 2. to determine whether there was an interest in participating in goal-based, pre-games exercise training programs. METHODS A web-based questionnaire was sent to adult SOT recipients who were members of the Canadian Transplant Association. The survey included questions about why participants attended, their PA levels, and their interest in a pre-games training program. RESULTS Of the 157 participants, more were male than female; the 35-54-year-old age group was the most common; and 62% of respondents received a liver or kidney transplant. The most common reasons for participating in the games were to showcase health post-transplant, promote awareness of organ donation, sports competition, and social reasons. Sixty-five percent of respondents reported that they would be interested in an exercise program to be more physically prepared for the competition. CONCLUSION Pre-games training programs could be developed to motivate participation and help participants achieve higher training intensities and foster social interaction. Directing resources to individuals who do not attend the games and to those who are not physically active should be considered.","D'Ambrosio, Andrea; Toulouse, Caroline; Bélanger-Marceau, Samuel; Savary, Simone; Mathur, Sunita; Segatto, Bianca; Hartell, David; Janaudis-Ferreira, Tania",Transplantation proceedings,334,9

In particular, disciplines related to perioperative medicine-including anaesthesia and critical care-currently hold the highest rankings in terms of retracted papers for research misconduct. The dominance of this dubious achievement is attributable to a limited number of researchers who have repeatedly committed scientific fraud. In the last three decades, six researchers have authored 303 of the 375 papers retracted in perioperative medicine. This narrative review reports on six cases of forged publication in perioperative that resulted in the paper's retraction. The process that led to unveil the fraud, the impact on clinical practice and changes in regulatory mechanisms of scientific companies and governmental agencies' policies will also be presented. Fraud in medical publications is a growing concern that affects perioperative medicine requiring a substantial number of papers to be retracted. The continuous control elicited by readers, by local institutional review boards, scientific journal reviewers, scientific societies and government agencies can play an important role in preserving the 'pact of trust' between the authors, professionals and ultimately the relationship between doctors and patients.","Nato, Consolato Gianluca; Tabacco, Leonardo; Bilotta, Federico",Journal of medical ethics,334,1

Factors influencing these parenting practices have not been examined in IPV-exposed Latinas. The aim of this study is to understand the factors that affect maternal involvement and spanking by Latinas to contribute to culturally-informed intervention development and refinement. A total of 93 Spanish-speaking Latinas who had experienced IPV completed standardized measures of maternal involvement, spanking, IPV, depression, and posttraumatic stress (PTS) and provided demographic information. Slightly over half of the women participated in an intervention program. Longitudinal multilevel modeling (MLM) demonstrated that higher levels of maternal depression predicted lower levels of involvement over time. PTS reexperiencing symptoms were positively related to involvement, such that mothers with higher levels of reexperiencing reported higher levels of involvement. An independent longitudinal MLM revealed that higher amounts of IPV exposure and higher levels of PTS arousal symptoms were associated with higher levels of spanking, while maternal employment was associated with lower levels of this same parenting behavior. Maternal involvement increased over time, where there was no significant change in spanking over time, and no effect of the intervention program on either parenting practice. Results suggest clinical interventions should target reductions in depression and specific PTS symptom subdomains as pathways to improving parenting in IPV-exposed Latinas. Continued study is needed to understand the relationship between reexperiencing and maternal involvement.","Stein, Sara F; Prakken, Kaitlin; Grogan-Kaylor, Andrew C; Galano, Maria M; Clark, Hannah M; Graham-Bermann, Sandra A",Journal of interpersonal violence,334,24

This paper is intended to provide a broad overview of current knowledge of these issues. Information on changes in the status of species, size of populations, and extent and condition of habitats is patchy, with little data available for many of the taxa, regions and habitats of greatest importance to the delivery of ecosystem services. However, what we do know strongly suggests that, while exceptions exist, the changes currently underway are for the most part negative, anthropogenic in origin, ominously large and accelerating. The impacts of these changes on human society are idiosyncratic and patchily understood, but for the most part also appear to be negative and substantial. Forecasting future changes is limited by our poor understanding of the cascading impacts of change within communities, of threshold effects, of interactions between the drivers of change, and of linkages between the state of nature and human well-being. In assessing future science needs, we not only see a strong role for ecological data and theory, but also believe that much closer collaboration with social and earth system scientists is essential if ecology is to have a strong bearing on policy makers.","Balmford, Andrew; Bond, William",Ecology letters,334,5

Methods: We included all randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and not-RCTs concerning the treatment of patients with СSFAOD after S/TH and RSFAE without duration. Results: Twenty-nine items (1990-2017) were discovered; 27 articles on the levels of evidence were included in qualitative synthesis; 9 studies (meta-analysis) were included in quantitative synthesis. The results of 2762 patients' treatment were summed up in our analysis (1422 patients S/TH; 1340 patients RSFAE). All included reports were at low risk of bias. According to the criterion ""frequency of PrO"" during one-year follow-up, the pooled Hazard Ratios indicate significant favours of S/TH if compared it with RSFAE (HR= 0.66 (0.57 to 0.76, P < 0.00001), I2 = 9%). Conclusion: Our study showed that S/TH with the SpiderFX device (distal embolic protection) are safe and effective treatment option for short lesion (<15 cm) in patients with СSFAOD. The usage of S/TH methods significantly reduced number of PrO if compared it with RSFAE. In long-segment lesion (>15 cm) in patients with СSFAOD, RSFAE may be considered better than an endovascular procedure. But still it is necessary to conduct well-planned randomized studies to determine effectiveness and safety of the compared methods (S/TH and RSFAE) in patients with long-segment lesion (>15 cm).","Starodubtsev, Vladimir; Karpenko, Andrey; Lenko, Evgeniy; Ignatenko, Pavel",Journal of cardiovascular and thoracic research,334,31

DESIGN Cross-sectional study design. Adults of the general population were invited to a voluntary online health survey. METHODS Hierarchical multiple regressions were used to examine diverse psycho-social and stressful contextual factors associated with symptoms of psychopathology. RESULTS Results indicated that females reported higher symptoms of depression, anxiety and circadian rhythm dysregulation, than males. Age and the capacity to adapt to a new environment and to cope with illness were negatively associated with all symptoms of psychopathology. Conversely, engaging in verbally aggressive behaviours and having experienced stressful events related to COVID-19 were positively related to psychopathological symptoms. Finally, social support was negatively associated with depressive symptoms, and substance use during the past months was related to circadian rhythm dysregulation. CONCLUSIONS The findings of this study raise particular concern about psychological well-being considering the negative associations between stressful events during the COVID-19 pandemic, symptoms of psychological distress, and perceived social support.

We investigated the risk of COVID-19 infection and subsequent hospitalisation and death in splenectomized patients. METHODS We conducted a case-control study of all individuals with a microbiologically verified COVID-19 infection in Denmark through December 31, 2020. To each case, we matched three controls on age, sex, and region of residence. We examined the association between previous splenectomy and the risk of COVID-19 infection, hospitalisation, and death using a logistic regression model. RESULTS We identified 165,623 individuals with a positive COVID-19 test and 493,300 matched controls. Mean age was 38 years. 130 and 422 splenectomies were performed in the COVID-19 positive individuals and controls, respectively. Splenectomized patients did not have a higher risk of COVID-19 infection than non-splenectomized patients (adjusted OR: 0.89; 95% CI: 0.73-1.08).

This study investigates the effects of such delays in the delivery of cross-linking services in patients with keratoconus progression. METHODS Retrospective observational study of 46 patients with keratoconus progression, whose cross-linking was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Demographic and clinical details were obtained from assessments on the day of listing, and subsequent review on the day of the procedure. Topographic indices included keratometry of the posterior and anterior corneal surface, maximum keratometry (Kmax), thinnest corneal thickness, ABCD progression and progression based on standard criteria recommendations (1.5 D Kmax & 20 microns thinning). RESULTS A total of 46 eyes were analysed with an average time between being listed for CXL and having the procedure done was 182 ± 65 days. The delay due to COVID-19 was of 3 months. In this time period they had a significant worsening of all keratometric indices and lost almost one line of visual acuity (0.19 ± 0.19 to 0.26 ± 0.18 LogMAR, p: 0.03). Thirty two eyes (70%) demonstrated progression in accordance with the ABCD progression criteria, while 18 eyes (39%) showed either an increase in Kmax of more than 1.5D or a thinning in corneal thickness of at least 20 μm. CONCLUSIONS The treatment delay for the keratoconus patients caused further progression and vision worsening. We recommend that corneal collagen crosslinking needs to be considered as a high priority intervention.","Shah, Haider; Pagano, Luca; Vakharia, Anuj; Coco, Giulia; Gadhvi, Kunal A; Kaye, Stephen B; Romano, Vito",European journal of ophthalmology,334,10

Recently, a practice-based instrument addressing biopsychosocial aspects of functioning, the Social Medical Work Capacity instrument (SMWC), was developed. Our aim was to examine the content validity of the SMWC using ICF core sets. METHODS First, we conducted a systematic search to identify relevant ICF core sets for the working age population. Second the content of these core sets were mapped to assess the relevance and comprehensiveness of the SMWC. Next, we compared the content of the SMWC with the ICF-core sets. RESULTS Two work-related core sets and 31 disease-specific core sets were identified. The SMWC and the two work-related core sets overlap on 47 categories. Compared to the work-related core sets, the Body Functions and Activities and Participation are well represented in the new instrument, while the component Environmental factors is under-represented. Compared to the disease-specific core sets, items related to the social and domestic environmental factors are under-represented, while the SMWC included work-related factors complementary to the ICF. CONCLUSION The SMWC content seems relevant, but could be more comprehensive for the purpose of individual work capacity assessments. To improve assessing relevant biopsychosocial aspects, it is recommended to extend the instrument by adding personal and environmental (work- and social-related) factors as well as a more tailored use of the SMWC for assessing work capacity of persons with specific diseases or underlying illness.","Sengers, Johan H; Abma, Femke I; Wilming, Loes; Roelofs, Pepijn D D M; Heerkens, Yvonne F; Brouwer, Sandra",Journal of occupational rehabilitation,334,26

We, therefore, conducted a randomized controlled trial to clarify the efficacy of the originally developed local infusion analgesia technique in total knee arthroplasty. METHODS Forty patients were randomly allocated to the local infusion analgesia or control group. Patients in the local infusion analgesia group received intermittent bolus intra-articular injection of analgesics consisting of ropivacaine, dexamethasone, and isepamicin until postoperative 48 h. Primary outcome was pain severity at rest using 100-mm visual analogue scale. RESULTS Pain severity in patients of the local infusion analgesia group was lower than control group, and there were significant differences between groups at POD1 (p = 0.025) and POD3 (p = 0.007). Reduction of postoperative pain was associated with a decrease in C-reactive protein level and earlier achievement of straight leg raise. In addition, postoperative drain volume was reduced in the local infusion analgesia group. CONCLUSION Although larger studies are needed to examine its safety, the local infusion analgesia alone provided clinically significant analgesic effects and rapid recovery in total knee arthroplasty.","Ikeuchi, Masahiko; Kamimoto, Yuko; Izumi, Masashi; Sugimura, Natsuki; Takemura, Mizue; Fukunaga, Kayo; Yokoyama, Masataka; Tani, Toshikazu","Knee surgery, sports traumatology, arthroscopy : official journal of the ESSKA",334,17

Investigations were performed with controlled and natural wind conditions. Test results confirmed that the passive opened top-end pipe can be used as an alternative solution for indoor radon concentration mitigation at low additional construction cost. However, the extracted air velocity and negative pressure were found to fluctuate when tested under natural wind conditions. This fluctuation would reduce the effectiveness of the performance of the passive pipe. To reduce this fluctuation, a novel static ventilator has been developed and can be added on the top-end of the pipe.","Hung, Le Chi; Goggins, Jamie; Meier, Patrick; Monahan, Eugene; Foley, Mark",The Science of the total environment,334,32

With the promulgation of plastic bans in many countries, the global plastic waste trade will undergo tremendous change. In order to explore the future evolutionary trend of the global plastic waste trade network, this paper focuses on the analysis of the import and export of plastic waste from major trading countries around the world. Based on the bilateral trade volume of plastic waste from 1990 to 2019, a global plastic waste trade network is constructed, and the structure and characteristics of the network are studied. The results show that the global plastic waste trade network has shifted its center of gravity, and the import center has gradually shifted from China to Southeast Asia. The global plastic waste trade network presents a sparse state. Moreover, the dependence of related countries on plastic waste trade decreases, whilst the closeness of trade links also decreases. Sudden factors such as plastic waste import bans have a disruptive impact on plastic waste management.","Zhao, Changping Liu Mengru Du Huanzheng Gong Yu",Sustainability,334,19

Hu et al., J. Virol. 66:1528-1534, 1992). The stalk region of the Newcastle disease virus (NDV) HN protein has been implicated in both fusion promotion and virus specificity of that activity. The NDV F protein contains two heptad repeat motifs which have been shown by site-directed mutagenesis to be critical for fusion (R. Buckland et al., J. Gen. Virol. 73:1703-1707, 1992; T. Sergel-Germano et al., J. Virol. 68:7654-7658, 1994; J. Reitter et al., J. Virol. 69:5995-6004, 1995). Heptad repeat motifs mediate protein-protein interactions by enabling the formation of coiled coils. Upon analysis of the stalk region of the NDV HN protein, we identified two heptad repeats. Secondary structure analysis of these repeats suggested the potential for these regions to form alpha helices. To investigate the importance of this sequence motif for fusion promotion, we mutated the hydrophobic a-position amino acids of each heptad repeat to alanine or methionine. In addition, hydrophobic amino acids in other positions were also changed to alanine. Every mutant protein retained levels of attachment activity that was greater than or equal to the wild-type protein activity and bound to conformation-specific monoclonal as well as polyclonal antisera. Neuraminidase activity was variably affected. Every mutation, however, showed a dramatic decrease in fusion promotion activity. The phenotypes of these mutant proteins indicate that individual amino acids within the heptad repeat region of the stalk domain of the HN protein are important for the fusion promotion activity of the protein. These data are consistent with the idea that the HN protein associates with the F protein via specific interactions between the heptad repeat regions of both proteins.","Stone-Hulslander, J; Morrison, T G",Journal of virology,334,24

In contrast to the alcohol-ether celloidin used in histology the use of the acetone solution of celloidin, suggested by us, preserved to a larger extent the viruses of different structure and composition, and, therefore, was shown to be more suitable in immunofluorescent investigations. The method was employed for the cytologic and the immunofluorescent identification of newly isolated virus agents. It was also used in the controlled replication of noncytopathogenic and slightly cytopathogenic strains of bovine rotaviruses, corona viruses, respiratory-syncytial virus, pestivirus, and others that required roller cultivation.

The benefits of measuring PCT in the Emergency Department (ED) are not yet fully characterised.PCT is widely used in the intensive care setting to guide antimicrobial prescribing. What this adds? Measurement of PCT as a routine in the emergency department for all patients treated for possible sepsis identifies a high-risk cohort. Key improvement in patient care A PCT measurement of >0.2ug/L in the Emergency Department identifies a patient at increased risk of deterioration and of in-hospital death. Background Early recognition and management of sepsis in the Emergency Department (ED) is a clinical challenge. Our aim was to determine if measuring the biomarker PCT in patients with suspected sepsis enables the identification of patients at increased risk of deterioration or in-hospital death in the ED setting of a district general hospital in the United Kingdom. Methods A prospective observational study was conducted on all patients aged 18 and over presenting to ED fulfilling NICE criteria for moderate to high risk of sepsis admitted to hospital. Patients had a PCT test alongside the sepsis six protocol. PCT was measured using Brahms's chemiluminescent micro particle assay (CMIA) for the quantitative determination of PCT in human serum and plasma on the Abbott Alinity I analytical platform. The cost per test was approximately 13 GBP.The analysis was performed on patients having a PCT in ED over a 7-month period, with in-depth scrutiny of an appropriate subgroup. A high level quality improvement (QI) approach was used in the study. Results A total of 1242 patients were included in the study. Mean/median age was 67.9/72, (range 18-102). 88.7% of deaths occurred in patients over 65 years of age. 42.4% (n=532) had a PCT level in ED of >0.2 ug/L. This identified a high risk group with a 2.4 fold increase in mortality rate (7.7%:18.2% p value <0.001). The median length of stay (LOS) was 5 (IQR 9) and 8 days (IQR 11) in patients with a first PCT of ≤0.2 ug/L versus >0.2 ug/L respectively. Conclusion An immediate PCT on patients presenting to ED with signs of sepsis in a non-specialised acute trust identifies those patients at an increased risk of deterioration and in hospital death.","Lucas, Georgia; Bartolf, Angela; Kroll, Nicholas; De Thabrew, Agampodi-Umanda; Murtaza, Zoya; Kumar, Siddarth; Gani, Abrar; Annoni, Andrea; Parsons, Marie; Pardoe, Helen",EJIFCC,334,28

We used map-based cloning to identify the MOF1 locus and confirmed our identification by complementation and by generating new mof1 alleles using CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing. MOF1 encodes a MYB domain protein with the typical ethylene response factor-associated amphiphilic repression (EAR) motifs, is expressed in all organs and tissues, and has a strong repression effect. MOF1 localizes to the nucleus and interacts with TOPLESS-RELATED PROTEINs (TPRs) to possibly repress the expression of downstream target genes. Taken together, our results reveal that MOF1 plays an important role in the regulation of organ identity and spikelet determinacy in rice.","Ren, Deyong; Rao, Yuchun; Yu, Haiping; Xu, Qiankun; Cui, Yuanjiang; Xia, Saisai; Yu, Xiaoqi; Liu, He; Hu, Haitao; Xue, Dawei; Zeng, Dali; Hu, Jiang; Zhang, Guangheng; Gao, Zhenyu; Zhu, Li; Zhang, Qiang; Shen, Lan; Guo, Longbiao; Qian, Qian",Plant physiol,334,30

We compared self-reported HRQoL and hospital quality of care among perinatal women with and without COVID-19. METHODS: This is a prospective cohort study of perinatal women attending a tertiary maternity unit during the pandemic. Eighteen women who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and 20 SARS-CoV-2-negative women were recruited. Participants completed the Short Form Health Survey (SF-12), Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation-Outcome Measure, and Quality from the Patient's Perspective questionnaires. Mean scores were compared. RESULTS: Of the Non-COVID-19 cohort, 95% (n = 19) were Caucasian, whereas 67% (n = 12) of the COVID-19 cohort were not Caucasian (&#967;2 = 16.01, P < 0.001). The mean SF-12 for physical health in the COVID-19 cohort had significantly lower scores (P < 0.002). There was no difference in mental health and well-being between cohorts. The quality of care experienced was notably similar and very positive. CONCLUSION: There was a significantly greater burden on physical health among pregnant women with COVID-19. Mental health and psychological status were similar in both groups. High quality of care during a pandemic is possible to deliver in a maternity setting, irrespective of COVID-19 status.","Alaya, Fátimah; Worrall, Amy P; O039,; Toole, Fiona; Doyle, Jillian; Duffy, Richard M; Geary, Michael P",Int. j. gynaecol. obstet,334,20

Because of heterogeneous symptoms and a subset of patients even being asymptomatic at presentation, fast identification of infected patients remains challenging. Objective: The goal of this study is the evaluation of different patient groups with a focus on symptoms and pre-existing illness at admission, as this is important for initial assessment and adequate emergency care. Methods: COVID-19 positive patients at the University Hospital Heidelberg were retrospectively analyzed for disease history and symptoms at the initial presentation as well as mortality. The authors obtained institutional review board (IRB) approval by the Ethics Committee (Medical Faculty of Heidelberg University) prior to commencing the study. Results: Dyspnea was more common in patients admitted to intermediate care/intensive care units (48 vs 13%, P<0.001) and showed a significantly higher percentage in the deceased (91 vs 48%, P=0.004). The symptoms of all presenting patients were highly variable, and many manifestations commonly associated with COVID-19 like cough, fever, and sore throat were only detected in a subset of patients, 60%, 43%, and 33%, respectively. Conclusion: Dyspnea was present significantly more often in patients dying of COVID-19 compared to all patients admitted to the IMC/ICU, necessitating adequate observation and monitoring. In all presenting patients, initial symptoms showed large variation; therefore, COVID should be considered as a main differential diagnosis at every patient presentation, and patients with high pre-test probability should, if possible, be isolated until testing results are known.","Korell, Felix; Giannitsis, Evangelos; Merle, Uta; Kihm, Lars Philipp",Open Access Emerg Med,334,6

Data were retrospectively collected from seven males (age 37-61 years) who were referred for inpatient rehabilitation following the stay in the ICU (14-22 days). On admission, six patients were still supported by mechanical ventilation. All patients were first placed in isolation in a special COVID unit for 6-22 days. Patients attended 11-24 treatment sessions for the duration of rehabilitation stay (13-27 days), including 6-20 sessions in the COVID unit. The treatment included pulmonary and physical rehabilitation. The initially nonventilated patient was discharged prematurely due to gallbladder problems, whereas all six mechanically ventilated patients were successfully weaned off before transfer to a COVID-free unit where they stayed for 7-19 days. At discharge, all patients increased limb muscle strength and thigh circumference, reduced activity-related dyspnea, regained functional independence and reported better quality of life. Rehabilitation plays a vital role in the recovery of seriously ill post-COVID-19 patients.

To investigate how team culture and team productivity may also have been affected, we conducted two surveys at a large software company. The first, an exploratory survey during the early months of the pandemic with 2,265 developer responses, revealed that many developers faced challenges reaching milestones and that their team productivity had changed. We also found through qualitative analysis that important team culture factors such as communication and social connection had been affected. For example, the simple phrase""How was your weekend?""had become a subtle way to show peer support. In our second survey, we conducted a quantitative analysis of the team cultural factors that emerged from our first survey to understand the prevalence of the reported changes. From 608 developer responses, we found that 74% of these respondents missed social interactions with colleagues and 51% reported a decrease in their communication ease with colleagues. We used data from the second survey to build a regression model to identify important team culture factors for modeling team productivity. We found that the ability to brainstorm with colleagues, difficulty communicating with colleagues, and satisfaction with interactions from social activities are important factors that are associated with how developers report their software development team's productivity. Our findings inform how managers and leaders in large software companies can support sustained team productivity during times of crisis and beyond.","Miller, Courtney; Rodeghero, Paige; Storey, Margaret-Anne; Ford, Denae; Zimmermann, Thomas",,334,16

A novel three-dimensional (3D) convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture was proposed and referred to as DSD-UNET. The dataset of 91 patients received CT-based BT of cervical cancer was used to train and test DSD-UNET model for auto-segmentation of high-risk clinical target volume (HR-CTV) and organs at risk (OARs). Automatic applicator reconstruction was achieved with DSD-UNET-based segmentation of applicator components followed by 3D skeletonization and polynomial curve fitting. Digitization of the channel paths for tandem and ovoid applicator in the planning CT was evaluated utilizing the data from 32 patients. Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), Jaccard Index (JI), and Hausdorff distance (HD) were used to quantitatively evaluate the accuracy. The segmentation performance of DSD-UNET was compared with that of 3D U-Net. Results showed that DSD-UNET method outperformed 3D U-Net on segmentations of all the structures. The mean DSC values of DSD-UNET method were 86.9%, 82.9%, and 82.1% for bladder, HR-CTV, and rectum, respectively. For the performance of automatic applicator reconstruction, outstanding segmentation accuracy was first achieved for the intrauterine and ovoid tubes (average DSC value of 92.1%, average HD value of 2.3 mm). Finally, HDs between the channel paths determined automatically and manually were 0.88 ± 0.12 mm, 0.95 ± 0.16 mm, and 0.96 ± 0.15 mm for the intrauterine, left ovoid, and right ovoid tubes, respectively. The proposed DSD-UNET method outperformed the 3D U-Net and could segment HR-CTV, bladder, and rectum with relatively good accuracy.

Also, 120 controls were matched by age, parity, fetus number, and presence of chronic disease. T-tests, Chi-square tests, Wilcoxon signed-rank tests, and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to compare data from the blood tests and liver function indices among the selected groups. Results: Between January 24 and March 14, 2020, 60 pregnant COVID-19 patients delivered at the Maternal and Child Health Hospital of Hubei Province. The average maternal age of pregnant COVID-19 patients was 30.97 years and the mean gestational period was 37.87 weeks. 71.67% (43/60) of pregnant COVID-19 patients gave birth by cesarean delivery. In total, 21.67% (13/60) were diagnosed with diabetes and 18.33% (11/60) were diagnosed with hypertension during pregnancy. Compared to controls, pregnant COVID-19 patients showed significantly lower numbers of blood lymphocytes and higher numbers of neutrophils, as well as higher levels of C-reactive protein and total bilirubin. Among the three groups, pregnant COVID-19 patients with diabetes had significantly higher levels of neutrophils and lower levels of total protein. Aspartate transaminase levels were higher in pregnant COVID-19 patients with hypertension than in pregnant COVID-19 patients with no comorbidities and controls with hypertension.

BACKGROUND: Insomnia is an important factor that can affect the health and work quality of nurses. However, there is a lack of big-sample studies exploring factors that affect the insomnia of nurses fighting against COVID-19. METHOD: This cross-sectional study using the Ascension Insomnia Scale, Fatigue Scale-14 and Perceived Stress Scale took place in March 2020. Participants were 1,794 front-line nurses from four tertiary-level general hospitals. RESULTS: The prevalence of insomnia among participants was 52.8%. Insomnia was predicted by gender, working experience, chronic diseases, midday nap duration, direct participation in the rescue of patients with COVID-19, frequency of night shifts, professional psychological assistance during the pandemic, negative experiences (such as family, friends or colleagues being seriously ill or dying due to COVID-19), the degree of fear of COVID-19, fatigue and perceived stress. CONCLUSION: The level of insomnia among participants was higher than the normal level. Interventions based on influencing factors should be implemented to ensure nurses' sleep quality. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: An in-depth understanding of the influencing factors of insomnia among front-line nurses can help nurse managers develop solutions to improve front-line nurses' sleep quality, which will enhance the physical and mental conditions of nurses and promote the quality of care.","Zhan, Yuxin; Liu, Yunfang; Liu, Huan; Li, Mei; Shen, Yue; Gui, Lingli; Zhang, Jun; Luo, Zhihua; Tao, Xiubin; Yu, Jiaohua",J Nurs Manag,334,24

Machine learning models have been proposed to accurately predict COVID-19 disease severity. Previous studies have typically tested only one machine learning algorithm and limited performance evaluation to area under the curve analysis. To obtain the best results possible, it may be important to test different machine learning algorithms to find the best prediction model. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to use automated machine learning (autoML) to train various machine learning algorithms. We selected the model that best predicted patients' chances of surviving a SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, we identified which variables (ie, vital signs, biomarkers, comorbidities, etc) were the most influential in generating an accurate model. METHODS: Data were retrospectively collected from all patients who tested positive for COVID-19 at our institution between March 1 and July 3, 2020. We collected 48 variables from each patient within 36 hours before or after the index time (ie, real-time polymerase chain reaction positivity). Patients were followed for 30 days or until death. Patients' data were used to build 20 machine learning models with various algorithms via autoML. The performance of machine learning models was measured by analyzing the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPCR). Subsequently, we established model interpretability via Shapley additive explanation and partial dependence plots to identify and rank variables that drove model predictions. Afterward, we conducted dimensionality reduction to extract the 10 most influential variables. AutoML models were retrained by only using these 10 variables, and the output models were evaluated against the model that used 48 variables. RESULTS: Data from 4313 patients were used to develop the models. The best model that was generated by using autoML and 48 variables was the stacked ensemble model (AUPRC=0.807). The two best independent models were the gradient boost machine and extreme gradient boost models, which had an AUPRC of 0.803 and 0.793, respectively. The deep learning model (AUPRC=0.73) was substantially inferior to the other models. The 10 most influential variables for generating high-performing models were systolic and diastolic blood pressure, age, pulse oximetry level, blood urea nitrogen level, lactate dehydrogenase level, D-dimer level, troponin level, respiratory rate, and Charlson comorbidity score. After the autoML models were retrained with these 10 variables, the stacked ensemble model still had the best performance (AUPRC=0.791). CONCLUSIONS: We used autoML to develop high-performing models that predicted the survival of patients with COVID-19. In addition, we identified important variables that correlated with mortality. This is proof of concept that autoML is an efficient, effective, and informative method for generating machine learning-based clinical decision support tools.","Ikemura, Kenji; Bellin, Eran; Yagi, Yukako; Billett, Henny; Saada, Mahmoud; Simone, Katelyn; Stahl, Lindsay; Szymanski, James; Goldstein, D Y; Reyes Gil, Morayma",J Med Internet Res,334,10

Investigating the public's response to various pandemic restrictions can provide a more balanced assessment of current views, allowing policymakers to craft better public health messages in anticipation of poor reactions to controversial restrictions. OBJECTIVE: Using data from social media, this study aims to understand the changes in public opinion associated with the implementation of COVID-19 restrictions (e.g. business and school closure, regional lockdown differences, additional public health restrictions such as social distancing and masking). METHODS: COVID-related tweets in Ontario (n=1,150,362) were collected based on keywords between March 12 to Oct 31 2020. Sentiment scores were calculated using the VADER algorithm for each tweet to represent its negative to positive emotion. Public health restrictions were identified using government and news media websites, and dynamic regression models with ARIMA errors were used to examine the association between public health restrictions and changes in public opinion over time (i.e. collective attention, aggregate positive sentiment, and level of disagreement) controlling for the effects of confounders (i.e. daily COVID-19 case counts, holidays, COVID-related official updates). RESULTS: In addition to expected direct effects (e.g. business closure led to decreased positive sentiment and increased disagreements), the impact of restriction on public opinion is contextually driven. For example, the negative sentiment associated with business closures was reduced with higher COVID-19 case counts. While school closure and other restrictions (e.g. masking, social distancing, and travel restrictions) generated increased collective attention, they did not have an effect on aggregate sentiment or the level of disagreement (i.e. sentiment polarization). Partial (region-targeted) lockdowns were associated with better public response (i.e. higher number of tweets with net positive sentiment and lower levels of disagreement) compared to province-wide lockdowns. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates the feasibility of a rapid and flexible method of evaluating the public response to pandemic restrictions using near real-time social media data. This information can help public health practitioners and policymakers anticipate public response to future pandemic restrictions, and ensure adequate resources are dedicated to addressing increases in negative sentiment and levels of disagreement in the face of scientifically informed, but controversial, restrictions.","Chum, Antony; Nielsen, Andrew; Bellows, Zachary; Farrell, Eddie; Durette, Pierre-Nicolas; Banda, Juan M; Cupchik, Gerald",J. med. internet res,334,7

In recent years, the Full Matrix Capture (FMC) technique has been implemented to extract the signals for post-processing to form an image. The inherent anisotropy and the layering of the structure pose challenges for the interpretation of this FMC data. To overcome this challenge, modeling techniques are required that take into account the diffraction caused by finite-size transducers and the response of the structure to these bounded beams. Existing models either homogenize the entire structure, use computationally expensive finite difference time domain (FDTD) methods, or do not consider the shape of the bounded beam, which is used to test such structures. This paper proposes a modeling technique based on combining the Multi-Gaussian beam model with the recursive stiffness matrix method to simulate the FMC signals for layered anisotropic media. The paper provides the steps required for the modeling technique, the extraction of the system efficiency factor, and validation of the model with experimentally determined signals for aluminum as an isotropic material such as aluminum and Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastic (CFRP) laminate as a layered material. The proposed method is computationally inexpensive, shows good agreement with the experimentally determined FMC data, and enables us to understand the effects of various transducer and material parameters on the extracted FMC signals.","Anand, Chirag; Groves, Roger; Benedictus, Rinze",,334,16

There is a growing body of research on mental health as it relates to the pandemic. The objective of this study is to use bibliometric analyses to assess the mental health research output related to the COVID-19 pandemic and compare it to that of the West Africa Ebola and H1N1 outbreaks. METHODOLOGY: We performed comprehensive searches in Embase, PubMed, and Scopus databases, and included all types of documents related to the three outbreaks published since the respective beginnings up to August 26, 2020. RESULTS: Despite the shorter time since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, relative to Ebola and H1N1, we found a much greater number of mental health documents related to COVID-19 (n = 3070) compared to the two other outbreaks (127 for Ebola and 327 for H1N1). The proportion of documents in the top 10% journals was 31% for COVID-19, 24% for Ebola, and 40% for H1N1. Authors affiliated with institutions located in high-income countries published or contributed to 79% of all documents followed by authors from upper-middle-income countries (23%), lower-middle-income countries (10%), and low-income countries (2%).

Asthma may limit imaging for PE due to either worsened ventilation defects on ventilation/perfusion scan (VQ) or increased motion artifact on CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA). Methods: We identified adults evaluated for PE with VQ or CTPA from 2012-2016. Patients with chronic lung disease (other than asthma) were excluded. Studies were classified as negative, positive, or non-diagnostic. Follow-up of negative cases were reviewed to determine rate of repeat exam (within one week) and false-negative rate (defined as diagnosis of venous thromboembolism within 90 days). Results: We reviewed 19,412 adults (age 52 ±18 years, 70% women) evaluated for PE (60% with VQ, 40% with CTPA); 23% had history of asthma. Non-diagnostic results were comparable for those with and without asthma for both VQ (asthma 3.3%; non-asthma 3.8%; P = 0.223) and CTPA (asthma 1.6%; non-asthma 1.5%; P = 0.891). History of asthma was not associated with higher repeat exam after negative imaging for VQ (asthma 1.9%; non-asthma 2.1%; P = 0.547) or CTPA (asthma 0.6%; non-asthma 0.6%; P = 0.796), nor was history of asthma associated with higher false negative rate for VQ (asthma 0.4%; non-asthma 0.9%; P = 0.015) or CTPA (asthma 1.9%; non-asthma 1.5%; P = 0.347). Conclusion: History of asthma in the preceding ten years was not associated with impaired diagnostic performance of PE imaging for either VQ or CTPA.","Lazarus, Matthew; Kim, Yoel; Mathai, Bertin; Levsky, Jeffrey M; Freeman, Leonard M; Haramati, Linda B; Moadel, Renee M",J. nucl. med,334,24

We used genetic risk scores to model how susceptibility to severe COVID-19 correlates with baseline levels of 35 inflammatory markers, by testing their impact in a SARS-CoV-2-negative population cohort. Because of the established effects of age and body mass index on severe COVID-19 risk, we further considered how these variables interacted with genetic risk to affect inflammatory marker levels. Methods We accessed data on 406 SARS-CoV-2-negative individuals as part of a UK population study. Multiplex electrochemiluminescence methods were applied to blood serum, and 35 inflammatory markers were assayed. Corresponding genotype data, alongside results from a large genome-wide association study of severe COVID-19, allowed us to construct genetic risk scores and to test their impact on inflammatory protein levels. Results Our results revealed that a higher genetic risk for severe COVID-19 was associated with lower blood levels of interferon gamma (IFN-?), vascular endothelial growth factor D (VEGF-D) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α). Inflammatory profiles of those with high genetic risk increasingly diverge from the norm in association with age and obesity. Conclusion Our results support the theory that individuals at risk of severe COVID-19 have a deficient innate immunity marked by reduced levels of inflammatory markers at baseline, including IFN-?, VEGF-D and TNF-α. We hypothesise that a secondary overactive adaptive immune response may subsequently explain the high levels of cytokines observed in SARS-CoV-2-positive COVID-19 patients.","Powell, Timothy R.; Hotopf, Matthew Hatch Stephani L.; Breen, Gerome Duarte Rodrigo R.

On the other hand, it can contain specific antibodies that could modulate a possible newborn infection by SARS-CoV-2. MAIN ISSUE: A 32-year-old pregnant woman, gestational age 37 and 3/7 weeks, was admitted with a flu-like syndrome caused by COVID-19. The female newborn was appropriate for gestational age, with a birth weight of 2,890 g, length 48 cm, and head circumference 34 cm. MANAGEMENT: The mother–infant dyad remained in the rooming-in unit during hospitalization, exclusively breastfeeding and following World Health Organization recommendations for contact and airway precautions. On the 3rd day after delivery, two mother’s milk samples (3 and 5 mL) were collected by hand expression. The samples were centrifuged for 10 min twice consecutively to separate fat, which was removed, and the remaining material was transferred to another tube to determine anti-SARS-CoV-2 Immunoglobulin A and Immunoglobulin G (ELISA, Kit EUROIMMUN AG, Luebeck, Germany). Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Immunoglobulin A was detected in the two samples evaluated, whose values were 2.5 and 1.9, respectively. No anti-SARSCoV-2 immunoglobulin G was detected. The exclusively-breastfed infant remained well through 45 days of age. CONCLUSION: The presence of SARS-CoV-2 Immunoglobulin A in the milk of mothers infected with COVID-19 may be related to protection against the transmission and severity of the disease in their infants.","Lebrão, Cibele Wolf; Cruz, Manuela Navarro; da Silva, Mariliza Henrique; Dutra, Letícia Veríssimo; Cristiani, Camila; Affonso Fonseca, Fernando Luiz; Suano-Souza, Fabíola Isabel",J Hum Lact,334,14

In this paper, interruption-recovery models and regression discontinuity design were developed to characterize air pollution interruption-recovery patterns and analyze environmental impacts of the COVID-19 lockdown, using air pollution data from four Chinese metropolises (i.e., Shanghai, Wuhan, Tianjin, and Guangzhou). The results revealed the air pollutant interruption-recovery curve represented by the three lockdown response periods (Level I, Level II and Level III) during COVID-19. The curve decreased during Level I (A 25.3%–48.8% drop in the concentration of NO(2) has been observed in the four metropolises compared with the same period in 2018–2019.), then recovered around reopening, but decreased again during Level III. Moreover, the interruption-recovery curve of the year-on-year air pollution difference suggests a process of first decreasing during Level I and gradually recovering to a new equilibrium during Level III (e.g., the unit cumulative difference of NO(2) mass concentrations in Shanghai was 21.7, 22.5, 11.3 (μg/m(3)) during Level I, II, and III and other metropolises shared similar results). Our findings reveal general trends in the air quality externality of different lockdown policies, hence could provide valuable insights into air pollutant interruption-recovery patterns and clear scientific guides for policymakers to estimate the effect of different lockdown policies on urban air quality.","Cai, Wan-Jin; Wang, Hong-Wei; Wu, Cui-Lin; Lu, Kai-Fa; Peng, Zhong-Ren; He, Hong-Di",Build Environ,334,24

Hence, the development of effective vaccines or therapeutic interventions is the current global priority in order to reduce disease severity, frequent outbreaks, and to prevent future infections. Vaccine development for newly emerging pathogens takes a long time, which hinders rapid immunization programs. The concept of plant-based pharmaceuticals can be readily applied to meet the recombinant protein demand by means of transient expression. Plants are evolved as an expression platform, and they bring a combination of unique interests in terms of rapid scalability, flexibility, and economy for industrial-scale production of effective vaccines, diagnostic reagents, and other biopharmaceuticals. Plants offer safe biologics to fulfill emergency demands, especially during pandemic situations or outbreaks caused by emerging strains.

METHODS: we analyzed in this study, the demographic features, clinical presentations, laboratory data and radiologic findings of the COVID-19 patients in comparison to those with other respiratory infections or diseases. RESULTS: the mean age of all patients was 38.04 years; 35 patients were later confirmed to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The most common symptoms reported by both groups included nonproductive cough and myalgia. Two of the non-COVID-19 patients were having below 92% oxygen saturation and low systolic blood pressure. The patients shared relatively similar laboratory findings except 3% of the non-COVID-19 patients who had lympho-neutropenia and 22.6% had high levels of C-reactive protein. Pulmonary tuberculosis and autoimmune disease respiratory disorder were suspected in 2 of the non-COVID-19 patients respectively.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative pathogen for the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic. The authorities worldwide use clinical science to identify infected people, but this approach is not able to track all symptomatic and asymptomatic cases due to limited sampling capacity of the testing laboratories. This drawback is eliminated by the Wastewater-Based Epidemiology (WBE) approach. In this review, we summarized the peer-reviewed published literature (available as of 28(th) September 2020), in the field of WBE. The commonly used steps (sampling, storage, concentration, isolation, detection) of the analytical protocols were identified. The potential limitations of each stage of the protocols and good practices were discussed. Finally, new methods for the efficient detection of SARS-CoV-2 were proposed.","Alygizakis, Nikiforos; Markou, Athina N.; Rousis, Nikolaos I.; Galani, Aikaterini; Avgeris, Margaritis; Adamopoulos, Panagiotis G.; Scorilas, Andreas; Lianidou, Evi S.; Paraskevis, Dimitrios; Tsiodras, Soritios; Tsakris, Athanassios; Dimopoulos, Meletios-Athanasios; Thomaidis, Nikolaos S.",Trends Analyt Chem,334,16

We applied a “next-generation” parallel sequencing platform for viral detection in nasopharyngeal and fecal samples collected during seasonal influenza virus (Flu) infections and norovirus outbreaks from 2005 to 2007 in Osaka, Japan. Random RT-PCR was performed to amplify RNA extracted from 0.1–0.25 ml of nasopharyngeal aspirates (N = 3) and fecal specimens (N = 5), and more than 10 µg of cDNA was synthesized. Unbiased high-throughput sequencing of these 8 samples yielded 15,298–32,335 (average 24,738) reads in a single 7.5 h run. In nasopharyngeal samples, although whole genome analysis was not available because the majority (>90%) of reads were host genome–derived, 20–460 Flu-reads were detected, which was sufficient for subtype identification. In fecal samples, bacteria and host cells were removed by centrifugation, resulting in gain of 484–15,260 reads of norovirus sequence (78–98% of the whole genome was covered), except for one specimen that was under-detectable by RT-PCR. These results suggest that our unbiased high-throughput sequencing approach is useful for directly detecting pathogenic viruses without advance genetic information. Although its cost and technological availability make it unlikely that this system will very soon be the diagnostic standard worldwide, this system could be useful for the earlier discovery of novel emerging viruses and bioterrorism, which are difficult to detect with conventional procedures.","Nakamura, Shota; Yang, Cheng-Song; Sakon, Naomi; Ueda, Mayo; Tougan, Takahiro; Yamashita, Akifumi; Goto, Naohisa; Takahashi, Kazuo; Yasunaga, Teruo; Ikuta, Kazuyoshi; Mizutani, Tetsuya; Okamoto, Yoshiko; Tagami, Michihira; Morita, Ryoji; Maeda, Norihiro; Kawai, Jun; Hayashizaki, Yoshihide; Nagai, Yoshiyuki; Horii, Toshihiro; Iida, Tetsuya; Nakaya, Takaaki",PLoS One,334,1

Malawi adopted the Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR) strategy to develop its national surveillance system since 2002 and revised its guideline to fulfill the International Health Regulation (IHR) requirements in 2014. This study aimed to understand the state of IDSR implementation and differences between guideline and practice for future disease surveillance system strengthening. This was a mixed-method observational study. Quantitative data were to analyze completeness and timeliness of surveillance system performance from national District Health Information System 2 (DHIS2). Qualitative data were collected through interviews with 29 frontline health service providers from the selected district and key informants of the IDSR system implementation and administration at district and national levels. The current IDSR system showed relatively good completeness (76.4%) but poor timeliness (41.5%) of total expected monthly reports nationwide and zero weekly reports. The challenges of IDSR implementation revealed through qualitative data included lack of supervision, inadequate resources for training and difficulty to implement weekly report due to overwhelming paperwork at frontline health services. The differences between IDSR technical guideline and actual practice were huge. The developing information technology infrastructure in Malawi and emerging mobile health (mHealth) technology can be opportunities for the country to overcome these challenges and improve surveillance system to have better timeliness for the outbreaks and unusual events detection.","Wu, Tsung-Shu Joseph; Kagoli, Matthew; Kaasbøll, Jens Johan; Bjune, Gunnar Aksel",bioRxiv,334,28

Several cohorts reported that people treated by tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and emtricitabine are less likely to develop SARS CoV-2 infection and related severe COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a pilot randomized, open-label, controlled, phase 2 trial at two hospitals in France. Eligible patients were consecutive outpatients (aged ≥18 years) with RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and an interval from symptom onset to enrolment of 7 days or less. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive oral tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and emtricitabine (2 pills on day 1 followed by 1 pill per day on days 2–7) or the standard of care. The primary and secondary endpoints were SARS-CoV-2 viral clearance from baseline assessed by cycle threshold (Ct) RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal swab collected at day 4 and day 7, respectively. A higher Ct corresponds to a lower SARS CoV-2 viral burden. Other endpoints were the time to recovery and the number of adverse events. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04685512. FINDINGS: From November, 20(th) 2020 to March, 19(th) 2021, 60 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to a treatment group (30 to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and emtricitabine and 30 to standard of care). The median number of days from symptom onset to inclusion was 4 days (IQR 3–5) in both groups. Amongst patients who received tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, the difference from standard of care in the increase in Ct RT-PCR from baseline was 2.3 (95% confidence interval [-0.6 to 5.2], p = 0.13) at day 4 and 2.9 (95% CI [0.1 to 5.2], p = 0.044) at day 7. At day 7, 6/30 in the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and emtricitabine group and 3/30 in the standard of care group reported no COVID-related symptoms. Adverse events included 11 cases of gastrointestinal side effects (grade ≤ 2), three of which leaded to drug discontinuation. Three patients had COVID-19 related hospitalisation, no participant died. INTERPRETATION: In this pilot study of outpatients adult with recent non-severe COVID-19, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate plus emtricitabine appeared to accelerate the natural clearance of nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 viral burden. These findings support the conduct of larger trials of tenofovir-based therapies for the prevention and early treatment of COVID-19.

The aim of this study was to investigate how to effectively reduce the transmission of dengue fever at construction sites and the neighboring communities. METHODS: The Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious/Asymptomatic-Recovered (SEIAR) model of human and SEI model of mosquitoes were developed to estimate the transmission of dengue virus between humans and mosquitoes within the construction site and within a neighboring community, as well between each of these. With the calibrated model, we further estimated the effectiveness of different intervention scenarios targeting at reducing the transmissibility at different locations (i.e. construction sites and community) with the total attack rate (TAR) and the duration of the outbreak (DO). RESULTS: A total of 102 construction site-related and 131 community-related cases of dengue fever were reported in our area of study. Without intervention, the number of cases related to the construction site and the community rose to 156 (TAR: 31.25%) and 10,796 (TAR: 21.59%), respectively. When the transmission route from mosquitoes to humans in the community was cut off, the number of community cases decreased to a minimum of 33 compared with other simulated scenarios (TAR: 0.068%, DO: 60 days). If the transmission route from infectious mosquitoes in the community and that from the construction site to susceptible people on the site were cut off at the same time, the number of cases on the construction site dropped to a minimum of 74 (TAR: 14.88%, DO: 66 days). CONCLUSIONS: To control the outbreak of dengue fever effectively on both the construction site and in the community, interventions needed to be made both within the community and from the community to the construction site. If interventions only took place within the construction site, the number of cases on the construction site would not be reduced. Also, interventions implemented only within the construction site or between the construction site and the community would not lead to a reduction in the number of cases in the community.

CASE PRESENTATION: A 57-year-old woman developed cough and fever after returning to Changsha from Wuhan on January 9, 2020. She tested positive for COVID-19 infection, a diagnosis which was supported by chest CT. The patient was treated with lopinavir and ritonavir tablets and interferon alfa-2b injection. A low dose of glucocorticoids was used for a short period to control bilateral lung immune response, and this patient avoided being crushed by cytokine storms that might have occurred. The clinical condition of this patient improved, and a COVID-19 assay conducted on January 25, 2020 generated negative results. This patient recovered and was discharged on January 30, 2020.

We have developed an experimental SARS vaccine for direct immunisation of the respiratory tract, the major site of SARS-coronavirus transmission and disease. METHODS: We expressed the complete SARS coronavirus envelope spike (S) protein from a recombinant attenuated parainfluenza virus (BHPIV3) that is being developed as a live attenuated, intranasal paediatric vaccine against human parainfluenza virus type 3 (HPIV3). We immunised eight African green monkeys, four with a single dose of BHPIV3/SARS-S and four with a control, BHPIV3/Ctrl, administered via the respiratory tract. A SARS-coronavirus challenge was given to all monkeys 28 days after immunisation. FINDINGS: Immunisation of animals with BHPIV3/SARS-S induced the production of SARS-coronavirus-neutralising serum antibodies, indicating that a systemic immune response resulted from mucosal immunisation. After challenge with SARS coronavirus, all monkeys in the control group shed SARS coronavirus, with shedding lasting 5–8 days. No viral shedding occurred in the group immunised with BHPIV3/SARS-S.

What might initially be conceived as a simplified donor–recipient process, the intricacies of donor plasma, IV immunoglobulins, and monoclonal antibody modality applications are becoming more apparent. Key targets of such treatment have largely focused on virus neutralization and the specific viral components of the attachment Spike protein and its constituents (e.g., receptor binding domain, N-terminal domain). The cumulative laboratory and clinical experience suggests that beneficial protective and treatment outcomes are possible. Both a dose- and a time-dependency emerge. Lesser understood are the concepts of bioavailability and distribution. Apart from direct antigen binding from protective immunoglobulins, antibody effector functions have potential roles in outcome. In attempting to mimic the natural but variable response to infection or vaccination, a strong functional polyclonal approach attracts the potential benefits of attacking antigen diversity, high antibody avidity, antibody persistence, and protection against escape viral mutation. The availability and ease of administration for any passive immunotherapy product must be considered in the current climate of need. There is never a perfect product, but yet there is considerable room for improving patient outcomes. Given the variability of human genetics, immunity, and disease, and given the nuances of the virus and its potential for change, passive immunotherapy can be developed that will be effective for some but not all patients. An understanding of such patient variability and limitations is just as important as the understanding of the direct interactions between immunotherapy and virus.","Cimolai, Nevio",Clin Hematol Int,334,5

Quantification of blood nitrite and nitrate, two relatively stable metabolites of NO (generally as NO(x)), has been acknowledged representing NO bioactivity partially. Dysregulation of NO(x) had been reported in SARS-CoV-2 infected populations, but whether patients recovered from COVID-19 disease present with restored NO(x) is unknown. In this study, serum NO(2)(−) and NO(3)(−) were quantified and analyzed among 109 recovered adults in comparison to a control group of 166 uninfected adults. Nitrite or nitrate levels were not significantly different among mild-, common-, severe- and critical-type patients. However, these recovered patients had dramatically lower NO(2)(−) and NO(2)(−)/NO(3)(−) than the uninfected group (p < 0.0001), with significantly higher NO(3)(−) levels (p = 0.0023) than the uninfected group. Nitrate and nitrite/nitrate were positively and negatively correlated with patient age, respectively, with age 65 being a turning point among recovered patients. These results indicate that low NO(2)(−), low NO(2)(−)/NO(3)(−) and high NO(3)(−) may be a potential biomarker of long-term poor or irreversible outcomes after SARS-CoV-2 infection.

We analyzed the plasma metabolome of 55 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and 45 controls by LC-HRMS at the time of viral diagnosis (D0). We first evaluated the ability to predict the diagnosis from the metabotype at D0 in an independent population. Next, we assessed the feasibility of predicting the disease evolution at the 7th and 15th day. Plasma metabolome allowed us to generate a discriminant multivariate model to predict the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 in an independent population (accuracy > 74%, sensitivity, specificity > 75%).

Here, we present the first metabolomic study in SARS-CoV-2 patients which showed a high reliable prediction of early diagnosis. We have highlighted the role of the tryptophan-nicotinamide pathway clearly linked to inflammatory signals and microbiota, and the involvement of cytosine, previously described as a coordinator of cell metabolism in SARS-CoV-2.

Its major manifestation is in the respiratory tract, and the general extent of organ involvement and the microscopic changes in the lungs remain insufficiently characterised. Autopsies are essential to elucidate COVID‐19‐associated organ alterations. METHODS AND RESULTS: This article reports the autopsy findings of 21 COVID‐19 patients hospitalised at the University Hospital Basel and at the Cantonal Hospital Baselland, Switzerland. An in‐corpore technique was performed to ensure optimal staff safety. The primary cause of death was respiratory failure with exudative diffuse alveolar damage and massive capillary congestion, often accompanied by microthrombi despite anticoagulation. Ten cases showed superimposed bronchopneumonia. Further findings included pulmonary embolism (n = 4), alveolar haemorrhage (n = 3), and vasculitis (n = 1). Pathologies in other organ systems were predominantly attributable to shock; three patients showed signs of generalised and five of pulmonary thrombotic microangiopathy. Six patients were diagnosed with senile cardiac amyloidosis upon autopsy. Most patients suffered from one or more comorbidities (hypertension, obesity, cardiovascular diseases, and diabetes mellitus). Additionally, there was an overall predominance of males and individuals with blood group A (81% and 65%, respectively). All relevant histological slides are linked as open‐source scans in supplementary files. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides an overview of postmortem findings in COVID‐19 cases, implying that hypertensive, elderly, obese, male individuals with severe cardiovascular comorbidities as well as those with blood group A may have a lower threshold of tolerance for COVID‐19. This provides a pathophysiological explanation for higher mortality rates among these patients.","Menter, Thomas; Haslbauer, Jasmin D; Nienhold, Ronny; Savic, Spasenija; Hopfer, Helmut; Deigendesch, Nikolaus; Frank, Stephan; Turek, Daniel; Willi, Niels; Pargger, Hans; Bassetti, Stefano; Leuppi, Joerg D; Cathomas, Gieri; Tolnay, Markus; Mertz, Kirsten D; Tzankov, Alexandar",Histopathology,334,16

More specifically, the past five years were covered, with the latest UK and Dutch guidelines for eating disorders as a starting benchmark, and with special consideration of the past 18 months. RECENT FINDINGS: The new research can be divided into findings that have: (1) reinforced our existing understanding of CBT-ED's models and impact; (2) advanced our understanding and the utility of CBT-ED, including its application for the ‘new’ disorder Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID); (3) suggested new directions, which require further exploration in clinical and research terms. These include learning from the circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic. SUMMARY: CBT-ED has developed substantially in the past 5 years, with consolidation of its existing evidence base, further support for real-life implementation, extension of methods used, and the development of new approaches for working with younger people – particularly in the form of treatments for ARFID. Over the past 18 months, even more promising changes in delivery occurred in response to the COVID19 pandemic, showing that we can adapt our methods in order to work effectively via remote means. Challenges remain regarding poor outcomes for anorexia nervosa.","Mulkens, Sandra; Waller, Glenn",Curr Opin Psychiatry,334,21

The Virus Outbreak Data Network (VODAN)‐Africa studied the possibility of increasing the production of clinical data, finding concerns about data ownership, and the limited use of health data for quality treatment at point of care. To address this, VODAN Africa developed an architecture to record clinical health data and research data collected on the incidence of COVID‐19, producing these as human‐ and machine‐readable data objects in a distributed architecture of locally governed, linked, human‐ and machine‐readable data. This architecture supports analytics at the point of care and—through data visiting, across facilities—for generic analytics. An algorithm was run across FAIR Data Points to visit the distributed data and produce aggregate findings. The FAIR data architecture is deployed in Uganda, Ethiopia, Liberia, Nigeria, Kenya, Somalia, Tanzania, Zimbabwe, and Tunisia.","van Reisen, Mirjam; Oladipo, Francisca; Stokmans, Mia; Mpezamihgo, Mouhamed; Folorunso, Sakinat; Schultes, Erik; Basajja, Mariam; Aktau, Aliya; Amare, Samson Yohannes; Taye, Getu Tadele; Purnama Jati, Putu Hadi; Chindoza, Kudakwashe; Wirtz, Morgane; Ghardallou, Meriem; van Stam, Gertjan; Ayele, Wondimu; Nalugala, Reginald; Abdullahi, Ibrahim; Osigwe, Obinna; Graybeal, John; Medhanyie, Araya Abrha; Kawu, Abdullahi Abubakar; Liu, Fenghong; Wolstencroft, Katy; Flikkenschild, Erik; Lin, Yi; Stocker, Joëlle; Musen, Mark A.",Adv Genet (Hoboken),334,29

We hypothesized that IL-6 trans-signaling in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) leads to endotheliopathy (a proinflammatory and procoagulant state) and liver injury in COVID-19. METHODS: Coagulopathy, endotheliopathy, and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were retrospectively analyzed in a subset (n = 68), followed by a larger cohort (n = 3,780) of patients with COVID-19. Liver histology from 43 patients with COVID-19 was analyzed for endotheliopathy and its relationship to liver injury. Primary human LSECs were used to establish the IL-6 trans-signaling mechanism. RESULTS: Factor VIII, fibrinogen, D-dimer, von Willebrand factor (vWF) activity/antigen (biomarkers of coagulopathy/endotheliopathy) were significantly elevated in patients with COVID-19 and liver injury (elevated ALT). IL-6 positively correlated with vWF antigen (p = 0.02), factor VIII activity (p = 0.02), and D-dimer (p <0.0001). On liver histology, patients with COVID-19 and elevated ALT had significantly increased vWF and platelet staining, supporting a link between liver injury, coagulopathy, and endotheliopathy. Intralobular neutrophils positively correlated with platelet (p <0.0001) and vWF (p <0.01) staining, and IL-6 levels positively correlated with vWF staining (p <0.01). IL-6 trans-signaling leads to increased expression of procoagulant (factor VIII, vWF) and proinflammatory factors, increased cell surface vWF (p <0.01), and increased platelet attachment in LSECs. These effects were blocked by soluble glycoprotein 130 (IL-6 trans-signaling inhibitor), the JAK inhibitor ruxolitinib, and STAT1/3 small-interfering RNA knockdown. Hepatocyte fibrinogen expression was increased by the supernatant of LSECs subjected to IL-6 trans-signaling. CONCLUSION: IL-6 trans-signaling drives the coagulopathy and hepatic endotheliopathy associated with COVID-19 and could be a possible mechanism behind liver injury in these patients. LAY SUMMARY: Patients with SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) infection often have liver injury, but why this occurs remains unknown. High levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and its circulating receptor, which form a complex to induce inflammatory signals, have been observed in patients with COVID-19. This paper demonstrates that the IL-6 signaling complex causes harmful changes to liver sinusoidal endothelial cells and may promote blood clotting and contribute to liver injury.","McConnell, Matthew J.; Kawaguchi, Nao; Kondo, Reiichiro; Sonzogni, Aurelio; Licini, Lisa; Valle, Clarissa; Bonaffini, Pietro A.; Sironi, Sandro; Alessio, Maria Grazia; Previtali, Giulia; Seghezzi, Michela; Zhang, Xuchen; Lee, Alfred I.; Pine, Alexander B.; Chun, Hyung J.; Zhang, Xinbo; Fernandez-Hernando, Carlos; Qing, Hua; Wang, Andrew; Price, Christina; Sun, Zhaoli; Utsumi, Teruo; Hwa, John; Strazzabosco, Mario; Iwakiri, Yasuko",J Hepatol,334,1

Underlying cardiovascular disease has been recognized as a risk factor for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related morbidity and mortality since the early days of the pandemic. In addition, evidence demonstrates cardiac and endothelial damage in somewhere between one-third and three-quarters of individuals with COVID-19, regardless of symptom severity. This damage is thought to be mediated by direct viral infection, immunopathology and hypoxemia with the additional possibility of exacerbation via medication-induced cardiotoxicity. Clinically, the cardiovascular consequences of COVID-19 may present as myocarditis with or without arrhythmia, endothelial dysfunction and thrombosis, acute coronary syndromes and heart failure. Presentation can vary widely and may or may not be typical of the condition in an individual without COVID-19. There is evidence to support the prognostic utility of cardiac biomarkers (e.g., cardiac troponin) and imaging studies (e.g., echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging) in the context of COVID-19 and building evidence suggests that cardiovascular screening may be warranted even among those with asymptomatic or mild infection and those without traditional cardiovascular risk factors. In addition, evidence suggests the potential for long-term cardiovascular consequences for those who recover from COVID-19 with implications for the field of cardiology long into the future. Even among those without COVID-19, disruption of infrastructure and changes in human behavior as a result of the pandemic also have an upstream role in cardiovascular outcomes, which have already been documented in multiple locations. This review summarizes what is currently known regarding the pathogenic mechanisms of COVID-19-related cardiovascular injury and describes clinical cardiovascular presentations, prognostic indicators, recommendations for screening and treatment, and long-term cardiovascular consequences of infection. Ultimately, medical personnel must be vigilant in their attention to possible cardiovascular symptoms, take appropriate steps for clinical diagnosis and be prepared for long-term ramifications of myocardial injury sustained as a result of COVID-19.","Umbrajkar, Sidhant; Stankowski, Rachel V.; Rezkalla, Shereif; Kloner, Robert A.",Cardiol Res,334,24

Experimental infection was conducted in 90-day-old chickens, embryonated eggs and bioassays in dogs. In the first experiment, poults were randomly divided into four groups. Groups I and II were provided feed with coccidiostat, whereas groups III and IV received feed without coccidiostat. When the poults from groups I and III reached 90 days of age, they received a subcutaneous inoculation of N. caninum. Once the hens entered their egg-laying period, during the following 30 days, the eggs were collected, identified, weighed and placed in an incubator. On the 70th day after inoculation, all animals, including the chicks, were euthanized. Tissue samples from the adult poultry and chicks were collected for histopathology, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and PCR. Brain tissue and pectoral muscle samples from infected birds were fed to two dogs. Notably, the average weight of the group III eggs was lower than that of the group IV eggs (p < 0.05). No changes consistent with infection in adult poultry or chicks were detected by histopathology or IHC; moreover, no amplified parasite DNA was detected in the birds’ tissues or dogs’ feces. No dog eliminated oocysts. In the second experiment, the embryonated chicken eggs were inoculated with 1 × 10(2)N. caninum tachyzoites, on the 10th day of incubation, and chicks born from these eggs were housed in boxes suitable for the species and received commercial feed and distilled water ad libitum. On the 30th day after infection (DAI), the poultry were euthanized, and their organs were processed as described in experiment I. The amplification of parasite DNA was observed in the spleen and pectoral muscles of one of the birds. The ingestion of bird tissues by dogs did not result in oocyst elimination. These results indicate that the parasite may have been eliminated by the host and that the use of tachyzoites to induce chronic disease might be a poor source for hens.","Munhoz, Alexandre Dias; Amaral, Tatiane Fernanda do; Gonçalves, Luiz Ricardo; Moraes, Vera Maria Barbosa de; Machado, Rosangela Zacarias",Vet Parasitol,334,3

The idea is to decrease and/or delay the peak of an epidemic wave so as not to strain or exceed the capacity of healthcare systems. There has been an increasing number of policy recommendations across the globe that favor the use of nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to flatten the curve. NPIs encompass containment, suppression, and mitigation measures such as quarantine, travel restrictions, and business closures. This paper provides perspectives on the impact of containment, suppression, and mitigation measures on interdependent workforce sectors. Reflections on the trade-offs between flattening the curve versus personal liberty and socioeconomic disparities are also presented in this paper.","Santos, Joost",Environ Syst Decis,334,16
