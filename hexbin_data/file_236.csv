774,Successful treatment of Chlamydophila pneumoniae acute respiratory distress syndrome with extracorporeal membrane oxygenator: a case report and diagnostic review,2012-01-17,"INTRODUCTION: Chlamydophila pneumoniae is a respiratory pathogen known to infect the upper and lower respiratory tracts. Infection severity can range from sub-clinical pulmonary infection to acute respiratory distress syndrome. CASE PRESENTATION: A previously healthy 62-year-old Caucasian man was admitted to our hospital for acute respiratory failure. Serum samples obtained every week starting from the day of admission showed clear-cut seroconversion for C. pneumoniae antibodies. All other cultures obtained during the first days of hospitalization were negative. Despite maximal ventilatory support (high positive end expiratory pressure, fraction of inspired oxygen of 1.0, nitric oxide inhalation, neuromuscular blocking agents and prone positioning), our patient remained severely hypoxemic, which led us to initiate an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation treatment. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and hemodiafiltration were withdrawn on day 12. Our patient was extubated on day 18 and discharged from our Intensive Care Unit on day 20. He went home a month later. CONCLUSION: We describe the first published case of acute respiratory distress syndrome due to C. pneumoniae infection successfully treated by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, a very useful tool in this syndrome. A quick and specific method for the definite diagnosis of Chlamydophila infection should be developed.","De Bels, David; Gottignies, Philippe; Reynders, Marijke; Roques, Sébastien; Wilmin, Stephan; Deyi, Véronique-Yvette Miendje; Jamart, Sophie; Devriendt, Jacques",J Med Case Reports,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3292808/,236
4587,Management of Respiratory Distress Syndrome in Preterm Infants In Wales: A Full Audit Cycle of a Quality Improvement Project,2020-02-26,"BACKGROUND: The effect of alternative spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) techniques on extubation success and other clinically important outcomes is uncertain. A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to clarify the preferable SBT (T-piece or pressure support ventilation [PSV]). METHODS: We searched the PubMed, Cochrane, and Embase databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) from inception to the 31st of July 2019. We included RCTs involving adult patients (> 18 years) who underwent at least two different SBT methods. All authors reported our primary outcome of successful extubation rate and clearly compared PS versus T-piece with clinically relevant secondary outcomes (rate of reintubation, ICU and hospital length of stay, and ICU and hospital mortality). Results were expressed as odds ratio (OR) and mean difference (MD) with accompanying 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: Ten RCTs including 3165 patients were included. The results of this meta-analysis showed that there was no significant difference in the successful extubation rate between the T-piece group and PS group (odds ratio [OR] = 0.91; 95% CI, 0.78–1.07; P = 0.27; I(2) = 79%). In addition, compared with the PS group, the T-piece group showed no significant difference in the rate of reintubation (odds ratio [OR] = 0.99; 95% CI, 0.78–1.26; P = 0.95; I(2) = 5%), ICU mortality (odds ratio [OR] = 1.22; 95% CI, 0.83–1.80; P = 0.30; I(2) = 0%), hospital mortality (odds ratio [OR] = 1.36; 95% CI, 0.99–1.87; P = 0.06; I(2) = 19%), ICU length of stay (mean difference = − 0.10; 95% CI, − 0.59 to 0.39; P = 0.69; I(2) = 13%), and hospital length of stay (mean difference = − 0.82;95% CI, − 2.2 to 0.55; P = 0.24; I(2) = 0%). CONCLUSIONS: T-piece and PSV as SBTs are considered to have comparable predictive power of successful extubation in critically ill patients. The analysis of secondary outcomes also shows no significant difference in the rate of reintubation, ICU and hospital length of stay, and ICU and hospital mortality between the two groups. Further randomized controlled studies of SBTs are still required.","Li, Yuting; Li, Hongxiang; Zhang, Dong",Crit Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7045460/,236

20121,An assessment of esophageal balloon use for the titration of airway pressure release ventilation and controlled mechanical ventilation in a patient with extrapulmonary acute respiratory distress syndrome: a case report,2021-08-17,"Segmentation of cardiac fibrosis and scars is essential for clinical diagnosis and can provide invaluable guidance for the treatment of cardiac diseases. Late Gadolinium enhancement (LGE) cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) has been successful in guiding the clinical diagnosis and treatment reliably. For LGE CMR, many methods have demonstrated success in accurately segmenting scarring regions. Co-registration with other non-contrast-agent (non-CA) modalities [e.g., balanced steady-state free precession (bSSFP) cine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)] can further enhance the efficacy of automated segmentation of cardiac anatomies. Many conventional methods have been proposed to provide automated or semi-automated segmentation of scars. With the development of deep learning in recent years, we can also see more advanced methods that are more efficient in providing more accurate segmentations. This paper conducts a state-of-the-art review of conventional and current state-of-the-art approaches utilizing different modalities for accurate cardiac fibrosis and scar segmentation.","Wu, Yinzhe; Tang, Zeyu; Li, Binghuan; Firmin, David; Yang, Guang",Front Physiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8369509/,236
21124,Acute respiratory distress syndrome caused by carbon monoxide poisoning and inhalation injury recovered after extracorporeal membrane oxygenation along with direct hemoperfusion with polymyxin B-immobilized fiber column: a case report,2021-09-15,"The consensus recommendations in 2018 from The Chinese Society of Hematology (CSH) on indications, conditioning regimens and donor selection for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) facilitated the standardization of clinical practices of allo-HSCT in China and progressive integration with the world. There have been new developments since the initial publication. To integrate recent developments and further improve the consensus, a panel of experts from the CSH recently updated the consensus recommendations, which are summarized as follows: (1) there is a new algorithm for selecting appropriate donors for allo-HSCT candidates. Haploidentical donors (HIDs) are the preferred donor choice over matched sibling donors (MSDs) for patients with high-risk leukemia or elderly patients with young offspring donors in experienced centers. This replaces the previous algorithm for donor selection, which favored MSDs over HIDs. (2) Patients with refractory/relapsed lymphoblastic malignancies are now encouraged to undergo salvage treatment with novel immunotherapies prior to HSCT. (3) The consensus has been updated to reflect additional evidence for the application of allo-HSCT in specific groups of patients with hematological malignancies (intermediate-risk acute myeloid leukemia (AML), favorable-risk AML with positive minimal residual disease, and standard-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia). (4) The consensus has been updated to reflect additional evidence for the application of HSCT in patients with nonmalignant diseases, such as severe aplastic anemia and inherited diseases. (5) The consensus has been updated to reflect additional evidence for the administration of anti-thymocyte globulin, granulocyte colony-stimulating factors and post-transplantation cyclophosphamide in HID-HSCT.","Zhang, Xiao-hui; Chen, Jing; Han, Ming-Zhe; Huang, He; Jiang, Er-lie; Jiang, Ming; Lai, Yong-rong; Liu, Dai-hong; Liu, Qi-Fa; Liu, Ting; Ren, Han-yun; Song, Yong-Ping; Sun, Zi-min; Tang, Xiao-wen; Wang, Jian-min; Wu, De-pei; Xu, Lan-ping; Zhang, Xi; Zhou, Dao-bin; Huang, Xiao-jun",J Hematol Oncol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8441240/,236
21284,Utilizing machine learning to improve clinical trial design for acute respiratory distress syndrome,2021-09-09,"A promising technique of discovering disease biomarkers is to measure the relative protein abundance in multiple biofluid samples through liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) based quantitative proteomics. The key step involves peptide feature detection in the LC-MS map, along with its charge and intensity. Existing heuristic algorithms suffer from inaccurate parameters and human errors. As a solution, we propose PointIso, the first point cloud based arbitrary-precision deep learning network to address this problem. It consists of attention based scanning step for segmenting the multi-isotopic pattern of 3D peptide features along with the charge, and a sequence classification step for grouping those isotopes into potential peptide features. PointIso achieves 98% detection of high-quality MS/MS identified peptide features in a benchmark dataset. Next, the model is adapted for handling the additional ‘ion mobility’ dimension and achieves 4% higher detection than existing algorithms on the human proteome dataset. Besides contributing to the proteomics study, our novel segmentation technique should serve the general object detection domain as well.","Zohora, Fatema Tuz; Rahman, M.

We investigated whether frailty and multimorbidity were associated with risk of hospitalisation with COVID-19 in the UK Biobank. 502,640 participants aged 40-69 years at baseline (54-79 years at COVID-19 testing) were recruited across UK 2006-10. A modified assessment of frailty using Fried’s classification was generated from baseline data. COVID-19 test results (England) were available 16/03/2020-01/06/2020, mostly taken in hospital settings. Logistic regression was used to discern associations between frailty, multimorbidity and COVID-19 diagnoses, adjusting for sex, age, BMI, ethnicity, education, smoking and number of comorbidity groupings, comparing COVID-19 positive, COVID-19 negative and non-tested groups. 4,510 participants were tested for COVID-19 (positive=1,326, negative=3,184). 497,996 participants were not tested. Compared to the non-tested group, after adjustment, COVID-19 positive participants were more likely to be frail (OR=1.4 [95%CI=1.1, 1.8]), report slow walking speed (OR=1.3 [1.1, 1.6]), report two or more falls in the past year (OR=1.3 [1.0, 1.5]) and be multimorbid (≥4 comorbidity groupings vs 0-1: OR=1.9 [1.5, 2.3]). However, similar strength of associations were apparent when comparing COVID-19 negative and non-tested groups. Furthermore, frailty and multimorbidity were not associated with COVID-19 diagnoses, when comparing COVID-19 positive and COVID-19 negative participants. In conclusion, frailty and multimorbidity do not appear to aid risk stratification, in terms of a positive versus negative results of COVID-19 testing. Investigation of the prognostic value of these markers for adverse clinical sequelae following COVID-19 disease is urgently needed.","Woolford, Stephen; D’Angelo, Stefania; Curtis, Elizabeth; Parsons, Camille; Dennison, Elaine; Patel, Harnish; Cooper, Cyrus; Harvey, Nicholas",Innov Aging,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7741804/,236

55186,Outcomes of Critically Ill Very Old Patients With Community-Acquired Pneumonia and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome,2021-06-18,"SARS‐CoV‐2 is a highly infectious virus that is responsible for the COVID‐19 global pandemic that swept the world in 2020. Disease outcomes range from asymptomatic to fatal. The virus initiates entry into host cells by the binding of its spike protein to the ACE2 receptor. Entry is finalized by the activation of spike glycoprotein by proteases including transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and FURIN which cleave the spike protein of the virus. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in TMPRSS2 may lead to functional changes which could underlie differences in disease severity. TMPRSS2 is also known to activate different respiratory illnesses including coronaviruses and influenza A (Shen et al., 2020). Previous studies have shown that knockout TMPRSS2 mice appeared healthy, experienced a decrease in viral spread within the respiratory system, and had a less severe immune response when infected with SARS‐CoV and MERS‐CoV (Baughn et al., 2020). Thus, we asked whether genetic variations in TMPRSS2 in humans lead to differences in infection rates or severity of disease symptoms of SARS‐CoV‐2. We examined the NCBI dbSNP database to identify SNPs in the TMPRSS2 gene. As of 10 December 2020, we found there were 11,023 intron variants, 393 missense variants, 186 synonymous variants, 3 in‐frame insertion variants, 2 in‐frame deletion variants, and 1 initiator codon variant reported. To narrow these down to 23 SNPs of interest, we first searched the ClinVar database to identify SNPs with general clinical significance, followed by searching the literature to determine SNPs specifically related to SARS‐CoV‐2 severity. One missense variant, rs12329760, results in an amino acid substitution, V160M, which has been predicted to alter TMPRSS2 function. A subset of these SNPs show differences in frequency in world populations, and we wondered if these SNPs had structural and functional consequences for the protein. A crystal structure of TMPRSS2 is not currently available. To visualize the structural consequences of amino acid substitutions, we performed homology modeling on TMPRSS2 (UniProt O15393) using the structure prediction software HHPred, RaptorX, and SwissModel based on the ~30% similarity to hepsin. The predicted structures of TMPRSS2 with various amino acid substitutions were then docked to the SARS‐CoV‐2 spike protein using I‐TASSER and Haddock 2.4 to observe differences in binding interactions and therefore determine which sequence changes are predicted to alter binding interactions, potentially contributing to the wide variation of symptoms caused by COVID‐19.

76783,[Expert consensus on principal of clinical management of patients with severe emergent cardiovascular diseases during the epidemic period of COVID-19].,2020-03-24,"A series of cases with rare thromboembolic incidents including cerebral sinus vein thrombosis (some of them fatal) and concomitant thrombocytopenia occurring shortly after vaccination with the COVID-19 vaccine AZD1222 (Vaxzevria) has caused significant concern and led to its temporary suspension in many countries. Immediate laboratory efforts in four of these patients have identified a tentative pathomechanism underlying this syndrome termed vaccine-induced prothrombotic immune thrombocytopenia (VIPIT) or vaccine-induced thrombosis with thrombocytopenia (VITT), which encompasses the presence of platelet-activating antibodies to platelet-factor 4/heparin complexes, possibly emulated by polyanionic constituents of AZD1222, and thus resembles heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Because these immune complexes bind and activate platelets via Fcγ-receptor IIA (FcγRIIA), high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin G has been suggested for treatment of VIPIT in addition to non-heparin anticoagulants. Here we propose inhibitors of Bruton tyrosine kinase (Btk) approved for B-cell malignancies (e.g. ibrutinib) as another therapeutic option in VIPIT, as they are expected to pleiotropically target multiple pathways downstream of FcγRIIA-mediated Btk activation, e.g. as demonstrated for the effective inhibition of platelet aggregation, dense granule secretion, P-selectin expression and platelet-neutrophil aggregate formation stimulated by FcγRIIA cross-linking. Moreover, CLEC-2- and GPIb-mediated platelet activation, the interactions and activation of monocytes and the release of neutrophil extracellular traps, as encountered in HIT, could be attenuated by Btk inhibitors. As a paradigm for emergency repurposing of approved drugs in COVID-19, off-label use of Btk inhibitors in a low dose range not affecting haemostatic functions could thus be considered as a sufficiently safe option to treat VIPIT.","von Hundelshausen, Philipp; Lorenz, Reinhard; Siess, Wolfgang; Weber, Christian",Thrombosis and haemostasis,https://doi.org/10.1055/a-1481-3039; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33851389/,236

This inclination can become especially striking when citizens reject notions that scientists would consider ""facts"" in the light of overwhelming scientific evidence and consensus. The resulting polarization over science has reached alarming levels in recent years. This theoretical review conceptualizes political polarization over science and argues that it is driven by two interrelated processes. Through psychological science rejection, people can implicitly disregard scientific facts that are inconsistent with their political identity. Alternatively, citizens can engage in ideological science rejection by adhering to a political ideology that explicitly contests science. This contestation can in turn be subdivided into four levels of generalization: An ideology can dispute either specific scientific claims, distinct research fields, science in general, or the entire political system and elite.

113878,[Drug interaction monitoring of lopinavir / ritonavir in COVID-19 patients with cancer].,2020-03-01,"BACKGROUND Primary dysmenorrhea, or painful menstruation in the absence of pelvic pathology, is a common, and often debilitating, gynecological condition that affects between 45 and 95% of menstruating women. Despite the high prevalence, dysmenorrhea is often poorly treated, and even disregarded, by health professionals, pain researchers, and the women themselves, who may accept it as a normal part of the menstrual cycle. This review reports on current knowledge, particularly with regards to the impact and consequences of recurrent menstrual pain on pain sensitivity, mood, quality of life and sleep in women with primary dysmenorrhea. METHODS Comprehensive literature searches on primary dysmenorrhea were performed using the electronic databases PubMed, Google Scholar and the Cochrane Library. Full-text manuscripts published between the years 1944 and 2015 were reviewed for relevancy and reference lists were cross-checked for additional relevant studies. In combination with the word 'dysmenorrhea' one or more of the following search terms were used to obtain articles published in peer-reviewed journals only: pain, risk factors, etiology, experimental pain, clinical pain, adenomyosis, chronic pain, women, menstrual cycle, hyperalgesia, pain threshold, pain tolerance, pain sensitivity, pain reactivity, pain perception, central sensitization, quality of life, sleep, treatment, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. RESULTS Women with dysmenorrhea, compared with women without dysmenorrhea, have greater sensitivity to experimental pain both within and outside areas of referred menstrual pain. Importantly, the enhanced pain sensitivity is evident even in phases of the menstrual cycle when women are not experiencing menstrual pain, illustrating that long-term differences in pain perception extend outside of the painful menstruation phase. This enhanced pain sensitivity may increase susceptibility to other chronic pain conditions in later life; dysmenorrhea is a risk factor for fibromyalgia. Further, dysmenorrheic pain has an immediate negative impact on quality of life, for up to a few days every month. Women with primary dysmenorrhea have a significantly reduced quality of life, poorer mood and poorer sleep quality during menstruation compared with their pain-free follicular phase, and compared with the menstruation phase of pain-free control women. The prescribed first-line therapy for menstrual pain remains non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, which are effective in relieving daytime and night-time pain. CONCLUSION Further study is needed to determine whether effectively blocking dysmenorrheic pain ameliorates risk for the development of chronic pain disorders and to explore whether it is possible to prevent the development-and not just treat-severe dysmenorrheic pain in adolescent girls. In conclusion, we demonstrate the extensive multi-factorial impact of dysmenorrhea and we encourage and direct researchers to necessary future studies.","Iacovides, Stella; Avidon, Ingrid; Baker, Fiona C",Human reproduction update,https://doi.org/10.1093/humupd/dmv039; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26346058/,236

Early outcomes and integrity of laparoscopic SG (LSG) against leak using a technique incorporating gastric transection-line reinforcement were studied. METHODS Between 2003 and 2009, 121 patients underwent LSG (16, two-stage; 105, primary). Of the patients, 66% were women, mean age 38.8 ± 10.9 (15.0-64.0), and body mass index (BMI, kg/m(2)) 48.7 ± 9.3 (33.7-74.8). Bovine pericardium (Peri-Strips Dry [PSD]) was used to reinforce the staple line. Parametric and nonparametric tests were used, as appropriate. The paired t test was used to assess change from baseline; bivariate analyses and logistic regression were used to identify preoperative patient characteristics predictive of suboptimal weight loss. RESULTS Mean operative time was 105 min (95-180), and mean hospitalization was 5.6 days (1-14). There was no mortality. There were 6 (5.0%) complications: 1 intraoperative leak, 1 stricture, 1 trocar-site bleed, 1 renal failure, and 2 wound infections. There were no postoperative staple-line leaks. Following 15 concomitant hiatal hernia operations, 3 (20%) recurred: 1 revised to RYGB and 2 in standby. Two post-LSG hiatal hernias of the two-stage series required revisions because of symptoms. BMI decreased 24.7% at 6 months (n = 55) to 37.5 ± 9.3 (22.2-58.1); %EWL was 48.1 ± 19.3 (15.5-98.9). Twelve-month BMI (n = 41) was 38.4 ± 10.5 (19.3-62.3); %EWL was 51.7 ± 25.0 (8.9-123.3).

OBJECTIVES To evaluate the effects of long-term testosterone therapy in A1C levels in men with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and hypogonadism, controlling for BMI, pre-treatment A1C, and age among different testosterone therapy adherence groups. MATERIALS AND METHODS We performed a retrospective analysis of 1737 men with diabetes and hypogonadism on testosterone therapy for 5 years of data from 2008-2018, isolating A1C, lipid panels, and BMI results for analysis. Subjects were categorized into adherence groups based on quartiles of the proportion of days covered (> 75% of days, 51-75% of days, 26-50% of days and 0-25% of days), with >75% of days covered considered adherent to therapy. RESULTS Pre-treatment median A1C was 6.8%. Post-treatment median A1C was 7.1%. The adherent group, >75%, was the only group notable for a decrease in A1C, with a median decrease of -0.2 (p=0.0022). BMI improvement was associated with improved post-treatment A1C (p= 0.007). When controlling for BMI, age, and pre-treatment A1C, the > 75% adherence group was associated with improved post-treatment A1C (p < 0.001). DISCUSSION When controlling for all studied variables, testosterone adherence was associated with improved post-treatment A1C. The higher the initial A1C at the initiation of therapy, the higher the potential for lowering the patient's A1C with >75% adherence. Further, all groups showed some reduction in BMI, which may indicate that testosterone therapy may affect A1C independent of weight loss. CONCLUSION Even when controlling for improved BMI, pre-treatment A1C, and age, testosterone positively impacted glycemic control in diabetes patients with hypogonadism, with the most benefit noted in those most adherent to therapy (>75%).","Jenkins, Craig R; Rittel, Alex; Sturdivant, Rodney X; Wan, Jen; Clerc, Philip G; Manning, Evan; Jenkins, Lydia M; Wardian, Jana L; Graybill, Sky D",Andrology,https://doi.org/10.1111/andr.12990; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33606360/,236

OBJECTIVES To compare long-term disease-specific survival (DSS) and outcomes between sMTC and hMTC groups. DESIGN Retrospective analysis. SETTING German tertiary referral center. PATIENTS 673 patients with MTC that underwent surgery from January 1974 to July 2019. INTERVENTION None (observational study). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Differences between sMTC and hMTC in long-term, stage-dependent survival and outcomes. RESULTS Surgery was performed at median ages of 49 years for sMTC (n=477, 44% male) and 29 years for hMTC (n=196, 43% male; p<0.0001). The mean follow-up times were 9.2±8.0 (sMTC) and 14.6±10.3 years (hMTC). Age and tumor stage at diagnosis were significantly different between the two groups (p<0.0001). The sMTC and hMTC groups had different overall DSS (log rank, p=0.0183), but similar stage-dependent DSS (log rank, p=0.1242 to 0.8981). In a multivariate analysis, sMTC and hMTC did not differ in DSS (HR=1.56, 95%CI=0.94-2.57), but in both groups, a worse DSS was significantly associated with age at diagnosis (HR=1.04, 95%CI=1.02-1.05), male sex (HR=0.49, 95%CI=0.32-0.76), and stages III and IV at diagnosis (HR=20.00, 95%CI=2.74-145.91 and HR=97.47, 95%CI=13.07-726.67, respectively). The groups had significantly different (p<0.0001) outcomes (i.e., cured, minimal residual disease, structural detectable disease, and death), but similar stage-dependent outcomes (p=0.9449 to 0.0511), except for stage III (p=0.0489). CONCLUSION Patients with sMTC and hMTC had different ages of onset, but similar stagedependent DSS and outcomes after the MTC diagnosis. This finding suggested that tumor behavior was similar in sMTC and hMTC. PRÉCIS This observational study of 673 patients with sporadic (n=477) and hereditary MTC (n=196) revealed similar disease-specific survival rates and outcomes, which suggested similar tumor behavior.","Raue, Friedhelm; Bruckner, Thomas; Frank-Raue, Karin",The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,https://doi.org/10.1210/clinem/dgab326; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33974051/,236

METHODS Electronic databases were searched up until July 2021 for meta-analyses of cohort studies and/or randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Summary effect sizes from a random-effects model, between-study heterogeneity, 95% prediction interval, small-study effect, excess significance, and credibility ceilings were devised to classify the credibility of evidence from meta-analyses of cohort studies, whereas the GRADE approach was used for meta-analyses of RCTs. RESULTS In meta-analyses of cohort studies, 52 of the 91 examined associations were statistically significant (P ≤ 0.05). Convincing evidence emerged from main analysis for the association between PPI use and risk of all-site fracture and chronic kidney disease (CKD) in the elderly population. However, none of these associations remained supported by convincing evidence after sensitivity analyses. The use of PPI is also associated with an increased risk of mortality due to COVID-19 infection and other related adverse outcomes, but the quality of evidence was weak. In meta-analyses of RCTs, 38 of the 63 examined associations were statistically significant. However, no associations were supported by high or moderate-quality evidence. CONCLUSION This study's findings imply that most putative adverse outcomes associated with PPI use may not be supported by high-quality evidence and are likely to have been affected by underlying confounding factors. Future research is needed to confirm the causal association between PPI use and risk of fracture and CKD.","K Veettil, Sajesh; Sadoyu, Saranrat; Mary Bald, Elizabeth; Chandran, Viji P; Anh Tuan Khuu, Scott; Pitak, Panitan; Lee, Yeong Yeh; Balakrishnan Nair, Athira; T Antony, Paul; C Ford, Alexander; Chaiyakunapruk, Nathorn",British journal of clinical pharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1111/bcp.15103; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34622475/,236

162591,Dynamic sampling bias and overdispersion induced by skewed offspring distributions,2021-03-24,"BACKGROUND Hypoglycemia is an increasingly recognized complication of bariatric surgery. Mechanisms contributing to glucose lowering remain incompletely understood. We aimed to identify differentially abundant plasma proteins in patients with post-bariatric hypoglycemia (PBH) after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), compared to asymptomatic post-RYGB. METHODS Proteomic analysis of blood samples collected after overnight fast and mixed meal challenge in individuals with PBH, asymptomatic RYGB, severe obesity, or overweight recruited from outpatient hypoglycemia or bariatric clinics. RESULTS The top-ranking differentially abundant protein at 120 min after mixed meal was fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF-19), an intestinally derived hormone regulated by bile acid-FXR signaling; levels were 2.4-fold higher in PBH vs. asymptomatic post-RYGB (mean + SEM, 1094 ± 141 vs. 428 ± 45, P < 0.001, FDR < 0.01). FGF-19 ELISA confirmed 3.5-fold higher concentrations in PBH versus asymptomatic (360 ± 70 vs. 103 ± 18, P = 0.025). To explore potential links between increased FGF-19 and GLP-1, residual samples from other human studies in which GLP-1 was modulated were assayed. FGF-19 levels did not change in response to infusion of GLP-1 and PYY in overweight/obese individuals. Infusion of the GLP-1 receptor antagonist exendin 9-39 in recently operated asymptomatic post-RYGB did not alter FGF-19 levels after mixed meal. By contrast, GLP-1 receptor antagonist infusion yielded a significant increase in FGF-19 levels after oral glucose in individuals with PBH. While plasma bile acids did not differ between PBH and asymptomatic post-RYGB, these data suggest unique interrelationships between GLP-1 and FGF-19 in PBH. CONCLUSIONS Taken together, these data support FGF-19 as a potential contributor to insulin-independent pathways driving postprandial hypoglycemia in PBH.","Mulla, Christopher M; Goldfine, Allison B; Dreyfuss, Jonathan M; Houten, Sander; Pan, Hui; Pober, David M; Wewer Albrechtsen, Nicolai J; Svane, Maria S; Schmidt, Julie B; Holst, Jens Juul; Craig, Colleen M; McLaughlin, Tracey L; Patti, Mary-Elizabeth",Obesity surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-019-03845-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30976983/,236

The clinical appearance and histopathology of avridine-induced arthritis show great similarity to other arthritis models such as collagen-induced arthritis. In LEW and DA rats the avridine-induced arthritis is severe and long lasting. To investigate a possible genetic influence on the disease we compared LEW, DA and E3 rats, which are of different genetic origins, for their ability to develop arthritis after injection of a low dose of avridine (1.5 mg/rat). The E3 rat was shown to be resistant, whereas all of the DA rats developed arthritis. Recombinant inbred strains derived from DA and E3 parentals varied in susceptibility to avridine. Only strains sharing RT1av1 with DA developed arthritis, indicating a role for the MHC genes. The MHC association was further analysed in a series of Lewis congenic strains using the 1.5 mg avridine dose. All strains developed arthritis. LEW.1C and LEW.1W developed only acute arthritis, whereas LEW.1A, LEW, LEW.1D, LEW.1N and LEW.1F developed chronic arthritis. In particular, the LEW.1F rats developed a chronic severe arthritis of high incidence. The chronic arthritis showed an active, erosive joint inflammation several months after induction. Nude rats are resistant to avridine-induced arthritis, indicating a T cell dependence of the disease which supports the importance of MHC. However, non-MHC genes are also crucial to arthritis development. Recombinants between DA and E3, sharing RT1av1 with DA, showed either a lower incidence or a lower severity of disease than the DA rats. The E3 rat and the recombinants with RT1u were completely resistant, whereas LEW.1W, also RT1u, were highly susceptible.","Vingsbo, C; Jonsson, R; Holmdahl, R",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1534209/,236

Appropriate management of cerebral oxygenation is thus one of the primary goals of anesthetic management during such procedures. The present report describes the case of a 65-year-old male patient, in which both bispectral index (BIS) and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) were used to monitor cerebral oxygenation. During the positioning, we observed an increased suppression ratio (SR) while BIS and regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO2) were at adequate level. In view of the difference in blood pressure between the heart and the base of the brain, blood pressure was maintained to ensure adequate cerebral perfusion. Although intraoperative rSO2 was at or around the cut-off point (a 12% relative decrease from baseline), no marked decrease in BIS or further increase in the SR was observed. Monitoring of cerebral perfusion using combined BIS and NIRS optimized anesthetic management during the performance of arthroscopic shoulder surgery in the beach chair position.","Kawano, Hiroaki; Matsumoto, Tomomi",Middle East journal of anaesthesiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25669007/,236

Second, to explore the influence of therapeutic orientations on therapeutic interventions in in-person versus remote psychotherapy. METHOD: Psychotherapists (N = 217) from Austria were recruited, who in turn recruited their patients (N = 133). The therapeutic orientation of the therapists was psychodynamic (22.6%), humanistic (46.1%), systemic (20.7%) or behavioural (10.6%). All the data were collected remotely via online surveys. Therapists and patients completed two versions of the 'Multitheoretical List of Therapeutic Interventions' (MULTI-30) (version 1: in-person; version 2: remote) to investigate differences between in-person and remote psychotherapy in the following therapeutic interventions: psychodynamic, common factors, person-centred, process-experiential, interpersonal, cognitive, behavioural and dialectical-behavioural. RESULTS: Therapists rated all examined therapeutic interventions as more typical for in-person than for remote psychotherapy. For patients, three therapeutic interventions (psychodynamic, process-experiential, cognitive interventions) were more typical for in-person than for remote psychotherapy after correcting for multiple testing. For two therapeutic interventions (behavioural, dialectical-behavioural), differences between the four therapeutic orientations were more consistent for in-person than for remote psychotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Therapeutic interventions differed between in-person and remote psychotherapy and differences between therapeutic orientations in behavioural-oriented interventions become indistinct in remote psychotherapy.","Probst, Thomas; Haid, Barbara; Schimböck, Wolfgang; Reisinger, Andrea; Gasser, Marion; Eichberger-Heckmann, Heidrun; Stippl, Peter; Jesser, Andrea; Humer, Elke; Korecka, Nicole; Pieh, Christoph",,,236

Within the context of the new coronavirus pandemic, these patients are highly vulnerable to infection by COVID-19, which might increase the care demands and burden of family caregivers. AIM: This study aimed to explore the subjective experiences of family caregivers of non-COVID-19 patients with end-stage renal disease undergoing in-centre haemodialysis during the COVID-19 lockdown. STUDY DESIGN: A qualitative study was performed with a purposive sample. METHODS: Semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with 19 family caregivers (50.7 ± 14 years old) of patients undergoing in-centre haemodialysis in April 2020. FINDINGS: Four major themes were identified: (1) emotional distress; (2) changes in caregiving responsibilities; (3) educational and supportive needs; and (4) coping strategies to deal with the outbreak and with the lockdown. DISCUSSION: The findings suggest that family caregivers of patients undergoing in-centre haemodialysis have to manage several additional care responsibilities due to COVID-19 lockdown. The dialysis team should consider the development of educational and supportive interventions to meet family caregivers' needs, mitigate emotional distress, fears and concerns, and prevent caregiver burden during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Sousa, Helena; Frontini, Roberta; Ribeiro, Oscar; Paúl, Constança; Costa, Elísio; Amado, Leonilde; Miranda, Vasco; Ribeiro, Fernando; Figueiredo, Daniela",Scand. j. caring sci,,236

Nine (56.3%) of the seropositive HCWs reported neither symptoms nor unprotected contact with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases in the previous months. A decline in the IgG index was observed at a median time of 86.5 days (range:84â128 days) after symptom onset or RT-PCR testing. Further studies are necessary to elucidate the duration of persistence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, as well as the correlation between seropositivity and protective immunity against reinfection. Regardless of the persistence of antibodies and their protective properties, such low prevalence indicates that this population is vulnerable to a second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Kasztelewicz, Beata; Janiszewska, Katarzyna; Burzynska, Julia; Szydlowska, Emilia; Migdal, Marek; Dzierzanowska-Fangrat, Katarzyna",PLoS One,,236

213149,First Case of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in Childhood Leukemia in China,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To describe the semiology of pain and its associated features in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and headache presenting to the emergency department who do not require urgent services. BACKGROUND: Headache is one of the most frequent neurological symptoms reported in case series, epidemiological studies, and meta-analyses of COVID-19, with a prevalence ranging from 8 to 71.1%. Studies addressing the semiology of these headaches are lacking. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study in the emergency department of a tertiary hospital. Patients classified according to the Manchester Triage System as standard and non-urgent and those fulfilling the criteria for probable or confirmed COVID-19 according to World Health Organization guidelines who presented with headache were included. A standardized questionnaire was used for data collection. RESULTS: Of the 145 confirmed and probable COVID-19 patients, 99 (68.3%) reported headache. A total of 54/99 (54.5%) were classified with probable COVID-19 and 45/99 (45.5%) with confirmed COVID-19. The mean age (44.7 ± 11.8 vs 40.4 ± 10.7, P = .061), sex distribution (35/54 [64.8%] vs 28/45 [62.2%] female, P = .768), and headache comorbidity (19/54 [35.2%] vs 17/45 [37.8%], P = .789) were similar between the probable and confirmed COVID-19 groups, along with other medical comorbidities and laboratory data. Patients with confirmed COVID-19 showed a higher incidence of anosmia (21/54 [38.9%] vs 28/45 [62.2%], P = .021) and pneumonia (10/54 [18.5%] vs 18/45 [40%], P = .018), headache at onset (32/54 [59.3%] vs 39/45 [86.7%], P = .002), and hospital admission (0/54 [0%] vs 2/45 [11.1%], P = .017). In most cases, the headache appeared simultaneously with other COVID-19 symptoms (57/99, 57.6%). It was bilateral (86/99, 86.9%), frontal or holocranial (34/99, 34.3% each) in location and intense (60/99, 60.6%, reported a visual analog scale [VAS] score &#8805;7). A total of 39/99 (39.4%) identified triggers, most commonly fever. The most frequent aggravating factors were physical activity (45/99, 45.5%) and coughing (43/99, 43.4%). Patients showed a propensity toward prostration (41/99, 41.4%), photophobia (29/99, 29.3%), and phonophobia (27/99, 27.3%). Partial (53/99, 53.5%) or total (26/99, 26.3%) responses to first-step analgesics were reported. A total of 25/99 (25.3%) patients had a prior history of migraine, presenting with headache different from the usual in 23/25 (92.0%) patients. Individuals with migraine were more likely to have earlier (headache at onset of the respiratory symptoms in 24/25 [96.0%] vs 57/74 [77.0%], P = .023 [95% CI: 0.067, 0.313]), longer (>24 hours of pain in 20/25 [80%] vs 25/74 [33.8%], P < .001 [95% CI: 0.272, 0.652]), and more intense (VAS score &#8805;5 in 25/25 [100%] vs 63/74 [85.1%], P = .043 [95% CI: 0.057, 0.213]) headaches than patients without migraine. CONCLUSIONS: Headache is a very prevalent COVID-19 symptom among patients presenting to the emergency room, most frequently presenting as holocranial or bifrontal moderate to severe, and pressing quality headache. Individuals with migraine tend to present with earlier, longer, and more intense headaches.","Membrilla, Javier A; de Lorenzo, Íñigo; Sastre, María; Díaz de Terán, Javier",Headache,,236

215877,Neuronal and Cerebrovascular Complications in Coronavirus Disease 2019,2020,"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) rapidly reached pandemic proportions. Given that the main target of SARS-CoV-2 are lungs leading to severe pneumonia with hyperactivation of the inflammatory cascade, we conducted a prospective study to assess alveolar inflammatory status in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19. METHODS: Diagnostic bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed in 33 adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection by real-time PCR on nasopharyngeal swab admitted to the Intensive care unit (ICU) (n = 28) and to the Intermediate Medicine Ward (IMW) (n = 5). We analyze the differential cell count, ultrastructure of cells and Interleukin (IL)6, 8 and 10 levels. RESULTS: ICU patients showed a marked increase in neutrophils (1.24 × 105 ml- 1, 0.85-2.07), lower lymphocyte (0.97 × 105 ml- 1, 0.024-0.34) and macrophages fractions (0.43 × 105 ml- 1, 0.34-1.62) compared to IMW patients (0.095 × 105 ml- 1, 0.05-0.73; 0.47 × 105 ml- 1, 0.28-1.01 and 2.14 × 105 ml- 1, 1.17-3.01, respectively) (p < 0.01). Study of ICU patients BAL by electron transmission microscopy showed viral particles inside mononuclear cells confirmed by immunostaining with anti-viral capsid and spike antibodies. IL6 and IL8 were significantly higher in ICU patients than in IMW (IL6 p < 0.01, IL8 p < 0.0001), and also in patients who did not survive (IL6 p < 0.05, IL8 p = 0.05 vs. survivors). IL10 did not show a significant variation between groups. Dividing patients by treatment received, lower BAL concentrations of IL6 were found in patients treated with steroids as compared to those treated with tocilizumab (p < 0.1) or antivirals (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Alveolitis, associated with COVID-19, is mainly sustained by innate effectors which showed features of extensive activation. The burden of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL6 and IL8 in the broncho-alveolar environment is associated with clinical outcome.","Pandolfi, Laura; Fossali, Tommaso; Frangipane, Vanessa; Bozzini, Sara; Morosini, Monica; D039,; Amato, Maura; Lettieri, Sara; Urtis, Mario; Di Toro, Alessandro; Saracino, Laura; Percivalle, Elena; Tomaselli, Stefano; Cavagna, Lorenzo; Cova, Emanuela; Mojoli, Francesco; Bergomi, Paola; Ottolina, Davide; Lilleri, Daniele; Corsico, Angelo Guido; Arbustini, Eloisa; Colombo, Riccardo; Meloni, Federica",BMC Pulm Med,,236

219576,Hyperglycemia and Correlated High Levels of Inflammation Have a Positive Relationship with the Severity of Coronavirus Disease 2019,2021,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has made unprecedented impact on the psychological health of university students, a population vulnerable to distress and mental health disorders. This study investigated psychiatric symptoms (anxiety, depression, and traumatic stress) during state-enforced quarantine among university students in China (N = 1912) through a cross-sectional survey during March and April 2020. RESULTS: Psychiatric symptoms were alarmingly prevalent: 67.05% reported traumatic stress, 46.55% had depressive symptoms, and 34.73% reported anxiety symptoms. Further, 19.56% endorsed suicidal ideation. We explored risk and protective factors of psychological health, including demographic variables, two known protective factors for mental health (mindfulness, perceived social support), four COVID-specific factors (COVID-19 related efficacy, perceived COVID-19 threat, perceived COVID-19 societal stigma, COVID-19 prosocial behavior) and screen media usage. Across symptom domains, mindfulness was associated with lower symptom severity, while COVID-19 related financial stress, perceived COVID-19 societal stigma, and perceived COVID-19 threat were associated with higher symptom severity. COVID-19 threat and COVID-19 stigma showed main and interactive effects in predicting all mental health outcomes, with their combination associated with highest symptom severity. Screen media device usage was positively associated with depression. Female gender and COVID-19 prosocial behavior were associated with higher anxiety, while COVID-19 self-efficacy associated with lower anxiety symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest high need for psychological health promotion among university students during the COVID-19 pandemic and inform an ecological perspective on the detrimental role of stigma during an emerging infectious disease outbreak. Interventions targeting multi-level factors, such as promoting mindfulness and social support at individual and interpersonal levels while reducing public stigma about COVID-19, may be particularly promising. Attending to the needs of disadvantaged groups including those financially impacted by COVID-19 is needed.","Sun, Shufang; Goldberg, Simon B; Lin, Danhua; Qiao, Shan; Operario, Don",Global Health,,236

228694,Pulmonary Artery Thrombosis in a Newborn With Severe Coronavirus Disease 2019,2021,"Background: Laparoscopic gynaecological surgery is commonly performed under general anaesthesia with endotracheal intubation. In general surgery, locoregional anaesthesia was applied to laparoscopic procedures, increasing minimally invasive surgery advantages. Aims: To assess and compare postoperative pain after laparoscopic adnexal procedures for benign conditions under spinal anaesthesia (SA) versus general anaesthesia (GA). Furthermore, anaesthesiologic, surgical and clinical data were evaluated in both groups. Materials and Methods: This is a prospective cohort study performed in a tertiary level referral centre for minimally invasive gynaecological surgery (Gynaecology and Human Reproduction Physiopathology, University of Bologna). Women scheduled for adnexal laparoscopic surgery for benign conditions between February and May 2019 were assigned to receive either SA or GA with endotracheal intubation. A sample size of 13 women per group was needed to detect a 2-point difference in pain scores. Main findings: 13 women were enrolled in the SA arm, 15 in the GA arm. In the SA cohort, the most common intraoperative adverse event was shoulder pain, reported by 3/12 women. At 1, 8, 12, 24 and 48 h after surgery pain was significantly lower in the SA arm (p < .05). Patients submitted to SA experienced no need for opioid drugs administration, unlike those receiving GA. Patients' mobilization and return of bowel function were noted significantly earlier in the SA group (p < .05). Conclusions: SA is a feasible, safe and effective anaesthesiologic technique for laparoscopic gynaecological procedures for benign conditions, allowing a better control of postoperative pain. Women undergoing SA achieve earlier mobilization and bowel canalization. During the Covid-19 pandemics, SA could be useful in reducing the need for invasive procedures on respiratory tract.","Raimondo, Diego; Borghese, Giulia; Mastronardi, Manuela; Mabrouk, Mohamed; Salucci, Paolo; Lambertini, Agnese; Casadio, Paolo; Tonini, Claudia; Meriggiola, Maria Cristina; Arena, Alessandro; Tarozzi, Giulia; Seracchioli, Renato",J Gynecol Obstet Hum Reprod,,236
228695,Pulmonary Artery Thrombosis in a Newborn With Severe Coronavirus Disease 2019,2021,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic amplified traditional access barriers for patients. However, responses to the pandemic have also seen attempts to avoid negative health consequences with improved access. Appropriate and well-understood access is a threshold condition for timely diagnosis and adherence but must be supported by both regulatory and reimbursement decisions. Americans often delay medical care due to inconvenience and out-of-pocket expense, particularly as many are responsible for growing out-of-pocket medical expenses under high-deductible employer plans. Non-adherence has been estimated to cost billions annually in the US alone. Patients who received health literacy interventions have shown a higher rate of treatment adherence than did those who did not, suggesting that millions of US adults with low health literacy could be assisted to better adherence with improved health literacy. Objective: We review the trends in access related to COVID-19 and contextualize, provisionally, how these changes may continue to improve access after the pandemic. Developments: Government and private insurers responded by expanding access with lower out-of-pocket costs and greater leveraging of technologies for more convenient care. These technologies, like telemedicine and remote monitoring in trials, can enhance the evidence available for regulatory and reimbursement policy decisions, including data on relevant subpopulations. Access to COVID-19 related care was enhanced with lower OOPs, and chronic conditions advantageously reclassified as preventative medicine. Coverage expanded for telemedicine and mail order and home delivery. Physicians conducting video chats increased by 159% and telemedicine by 106% in March compared to a year ago. Conclusion: Access has been improved and there has been greater utilization of digital technologies that can enhance both outcomes and evidence. However, the level of health literacy with respect to these changes remains an open question.","Cook, J.",Value in Health,,236

Self-collection of capillary blood at home can facilitate the monitoring of patients with chronic disease to support virtual clinics while mitigating the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the comparability of whole blood capillary and plasma venous samples for 15 routinely used biochemical analytes and to develop and pilot a user-friendly home-collection kit to support virtual outpatient clinical services. METHODS: To investigate the comparability of whole blood capillary and plasma venous samples for 15 routinely requested biochemical analytes, simultaneous samples of venous and capillary blood were collected in EDTA and lithium-heparin plasma separation tubes that were of 4-6 mL and 400-600 µL draw volume, respectively. Venous samples were analysed within 4 h of collection while capillary samples were kept at ambient temperature for three days until centrifugation and analysis. Analyte results that were comparable between the matrices were then piloted in a feasibility study in three outpatient clinical services. RESULTS: HbA1c, lipid profile and liver function tests were considered comparable and piloted in the patient feasibility study. The home-collect kit demonstrated good patient usability. CONCLUSION: Home collection of capillary blood could be a clinically-useful tool to deliver virtual care to patients with chronic disease.","Ansari, Saleem; Abdel-Malek, Mariana; Kenkre, Julia; Choudhury, Sirazum M; Barnes, Sophie; Misra, Shivani; Tan, Tricia; Cegla, Jaimini",Ann Clin Biochem,,236
232706,Correlation of Krebs von den Lungen-6 and fibronectin with pulmonary fibrosis in coronavirus disease 2019,2021,"As of early 2020, almost all countries are fighting the coronavirus pandemic by implementing the rigorous restrictions recommended by the World Health Organisation to help reduce the number of infections as much as possible. The restrictions also apply to members of the academic community. The universities have suspended all teaching activities - except online. Most universities have introduced solutions for distance learning. However, organisation of distance education requires appropriate technological infrastructure. Providing the right IT infrastructure is not an easy challenge, because network devices and network servers note record-breaking peak loads during this time. It seems that there are potentially many possibilities of using artificial intelligence to improve the performance of distance learning platforms, information systems and network infrastructure in this difficult and demanding period. Examples of such use of artificial intelligence applications are presented in this article. The paper shows that the use of artificial intelligence to improve the operation of distance learning servers is potentially possible in many areas. It is also worth noting that the application of artificial neural networks and LSTM neural networks for this purpose seems very promising. The presentation of sample experiments and obtained results in this article seems to confirm this thesis.","Klosowski, P.; Ieee,","2020 Signal Processing - Algorithms, Architectures, Arrangements, and Applications",,236

244464,One Hundred Days of Coronavirus Disease 2019 Prevention and Control in China,2021,"BACKGROUND: Acute lung injury (ALI) or its most advanced form, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a severe inflammatory pulmonary process triggered by a variety of insults including sepsis, viral or bacterial pneumonia, and mechanical ventilator-induced trauma. Currently, there are no effective therapies available for ARDS. We have recently reported that a novel small molecule AVR-25 derived from chitin molecule (a long-chain polymer of N-acetylglucosamine) showed anti-inflammatory effects in the lungs. The goal of this study was to determine the efficacy of two chitin-derived compounds, AVR-25 and AVR-48, in multiple mouse models of ALI/ARDS. We further determined the safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of the lead compound AVR-48 in rats. METHODS: ALI in mice was induced by intratracheal instillation of a single dose of lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 100 µg) for 24 h or exposed to hyperoxia (100% oxygen) for 48 h or undergoing cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) procedure and observation for 10 days. RESULTS: Both chitin derivatives, AVR-25 and AVR-48, showed decreased neutrophil recruitment and reduced inflammation in the lungs of ALI mice. Further, AVR-25 and AVR-48 mediated diminished lung inflammation was associated with reduced expression of lung adhesion molecules with improvement in pulmonary endothelial barrier function, pulmonary edema, and lung injury. Consistent with these results, CLP-induced sepsis mice treated with AVR-48 showed a significant increase in survival of the mice (80%) and improved lung histopathology in the treated CLP group. AVR-48, the lead chitin derivative compound, demonstrated a good safety profile.

251524,Systematic review on the clinical presentation and management of the COVID-19 associated multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C),2021,"Background: The current COVID-19 pandemic requires sustainable behavior change to mitigate the impact of the virus. A phenomenon which has arisen in parallel with this pandemic is an infodemic-an over-abundance of information, of which some is accurate and some is not, making it hard for people to find trustworthy and reliable guidance to make informed decisions. This infodemic has also been found to create distress and increase risks for mental health disorders, such as depression and anxiety. Aim: To propose practical guidelines for public health and risk communication that will enhance current recommendations and will cut through the infodemic, supporting accessible, reliable, actionable, and inclusive communication. The guidelines aim to support basic human psychological needs of autonomy, competence, and relatedness to support well-being and sustainable behavior change. Method: We applied the Self-Determination Theory (SDT) and concepts from psychology, philosophy and human computer interaction to better understand human behaviors and motivations and propose practical guidelines for public health communication focusing on well-being and sustainable behavior change. We then systematically searched the literature for research on health communication strategies during COVID-19 to discuss our proposed guidelines in light of the emerging literature. We illustrate the guidelines in a communication case study: wearing face-coverings. Findings: We propose five practical guidelines for public health and risk communication that will cut through the infodemic and support well-being and sustainable behavior change: (1) create an autonomy-supportive health care climate; (2) provide choice; (3) apply a bottom-up approach to communication; (4) create solidarity; (5) be transparent and acknowledge uncertainty. Conclusion: Health communication that starts by fostering well-being and basic human psychological needs has the potential to cut through the infodemic and promote effective and sustainable behavior change during such pandemics. Our guidelines provide a starting point for developing a concrete public health communication strategy.","Porat, Talya; Nyrup, Rune; Calvo, Rafael A; Paudyal, Priya; Ford, Elizabeth",Front Public Health,,236
252002,Olfactory Dysfunction in Coronavirus Disease 2019 Patients: Observational Cohort Study and Systematic Review,2020,"Cell-based therapies hold promise to substantially curb complications from extreme preterm birth, the main cause of death in children below the age of 5 years. Exciting preclinical studies in experimental neonatal lung injury have provided the impetus for the initiation of early phase clinical trials in extreme preterm infants at risk of developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Clinical translation of promising therapies, however, is slow and often fails. In the adult population, results of clinical trials so far have not matched the enticing preclinical data. The neonatal field has experienced many hard-earned lessons with the implementation of oxygen therapy or postnatal steroids. Here we briefly summarize the preclinical data that have permitted the initiation of early phase clinical trials of cell-based therapies in extreme preterm infants and describe the INCuBAToR concept (Innovative Neonatal Cellular Therapy for Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia: Accelerating Translation of Research), an evidence-based approach to mitigate the risk of translating advanced therapies into this vulnerable patient population. The INCuBAToR addresses several of the shortcomings at the preclinical and the clinical stage that usually contribute to the failure of clinical translation through (a) systematic reviews of preclinical and clinical studies, (b) integrated knowledge transfer through engaging important stakeholders early on, (c) early economic evaluation to determine if a novel therapy is viable, and (d) retrospective and prospective studies to define and test ideal eligibility criteria to optimize clinical trial design. The INCuBAToR concept can be applied to any novel therapy in order to enhance the likelihood of success of clinical translation in a timely, transparent, rigorous, and evidence-based fashion.","Thébaud, Bernard; Lalu, Manoj; Renesme, Laurent; van Katwyk, Sasha; Presseau, Justin; Thavorn, Kednapa; Cobey, Kelly D; Hutton, Brian; Moher, David; Soll, Roger F; Fergusson, Dean",Stem Cells Transl Med,,236

254113,Early Differences in Cytokine Production by Severity of Coronavirus Disease 2019,2021,"Against the background of the pandemic caused by infection with the SARS-CoV-2, the German Society for Pneumology and Respiratory Medicine (DGP e.V.), in cooperation with other associations, has designated a team of experts in order to answer the currently pressing questions about therapy strategies in dealing with COVID-19 patients suffering from acute respiratory insufficiency (ARI).The position paper is based on the current knowledge that is evolving daily. Many of the published and cited studies require further review, also because many of them did not undergo standard review processes.Therefore, this position paper is also subject to a continuous review process and will be further developed in cooperation with the other professional societies.This position paper is structured into the following five topics:1. Pathophysiology of acute respiratory insufficiency in patients without immunity infected with SARS-CoV-22. Temporal course and prognosis of acute respiratory insufficiency during the course of the disease3. Oxygen insufflation, high-flow oxygen, non-invasive ventilation and invasive ventilation with special consideration of infectious aerosol formation4. Non-invasive ventilation in ARI5. Supply continuum for the treatment of ARIKey points have been highlighted as core statements and significant observations. Regarding the pathophysiological aspects of acute respiratory insufficiency (ARI), the pulmonary infection with SARS-CoV-2 COVID-19 runs through three phases: early infection, pulmonary manifestation and severe hyperinflammatory phase.There are differences between advanced COVID-19-induced lung damage and those changes seen in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndromes (ARDS) as defined by the Berlin criteria. In a pathophysiologically plausible - but currently not yet histopathologically substantiated - model, two types (L-type and H-type) are distinguished, which correspond to an early and late phase. This distinction can be taken into consideration in the differential instrumentation in the therapy of ARI.The assessment of the extent of ARI should be carried out by an arterial or capillary blood gas analysis under room air conditions and must include the calculation of the oxygen supply (measured from the variables of oxygen saturation, the Hb value, the corrected values of the Hüfner number and the cardiac output). In principle, aerosols can cause transmission of infectious viral particles. Open systems or leakage systems (so-called vented masks) can prevent the release of respirable particles. Procedures in which the invasive ventilation system must be opened, and endotracheal intubation must be carried out are associated with an increased risk of infection.The protection of personnel with personal protective equipment should have very high priority because fear of contagion must not be a primary reason for intubation. If the specifications for protective equipment (eye protection, FFP2 or FFP-3 mask, gown) are adhered to, inhalation therapy, nasal high-flow (NHF) therapy, CPAP therapy or NIV can be carried out according to the current state of knowledge without increased risk of infection to the staff. A significant proportion of patients with respiratory failure presents with relevant hypoxemia, often also caused by a high inspiratory oxygen fraction (FiO2) including NHF, and this hypoxemia cannot be not completely corrected. In this situation, CPAP/NIV therapy can be administered under use of a mouth and nose mask or a respiratory helmet as therapy escalation, as long as the criteria for endotracheal intubation are not fulfilled.In acute hypoxemic respiratory insufficiency, NIV should be performed in an intensive care unit or in a comparable unit by personnel with appropriate expertise. Under CPAP/NIV, a patient can deteriorate rapidly. For this reason, continuous monitoring with readiness to carry out intubation must be ensured at all times. If CPAP/NIV leads to further progression of ARI, intubation and subsequent invasive ventilation should be carried out without delay if no DNI order is in place.In the case of patients in whom invasive ventilation, after exhausting all guideline-based measures, is not sufficient, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation procedure (ECMO) should be considered to ensure sufficient oxygen supply and to remove CO2.","Pfeifer, M; Ewig, S; Voshaar, T; Randerath, W; Bauer, T; Geiseler, J; Dellweg, D; Westhoff, M; Windisch, W; Schönhofer, B; Kluge, S; Lepper, P M",Pneumologie,,236

254966,Additional Concerns Regarding Children With Coronavirus Disease 2019-Reply,2020,"PURPOSE: To analyze the central macular thickness (CMT), retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (RNFLT), ganglion cell layer thickness (GCLT), and choroidal thickness (ChT) measurements in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: The study was conducted cross-sectionally 4 weeks after the completed treatment of COVID-19. The diagnosis of COVID-19 was based on the polymerase chain reaction test and/or clinical and radiological findings. The patients with treated COVID-19 were enrolled in the COVID-19 group; age- and sex-matched healthy participants served as the control group. All patients in the COVID-19 group were hospitalized and treated with favipiravir, moxifloxacin, and heparin without the requirement for intubation. The measurements of CMT, RNFLT (in four quadrants), GCLT (in six sectors of two different boundaries), and ChT (in five locations) were performed by swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT). RESULTS: Similar visual acuity (p = 0.582) and intraocular pressure (p = 0.766) values were observed between the COVID-19 and control groups. Regarding SS-OCT measurements, all mean CMT, RNFLT (in four quadrants), GCLT (in six sectors of two different boundaries), and ChT (in five locations) values were similar in the COVID-19 and control groups (p > 0.05 for all). In the COVID-19 group, a statistically significant negative correlation was noted between the mean ferritin level and temporal RNFLT (r = - 0.378, p = 0.014) and a positive correlation was observed between the mean ferritin level and nasal RNFLT (r = + 0.371, p = 0.016). CONCLUSION: SS-OCT measurements showed no retinal neurodegenerative and choroidal thickness alterations in COVID-19 patients. Nonsignificant results might be due to the examination of the patients in the early period of the COVID-19 after the treatment. Therefore, late period OCT measurements should be reviewed with new studies in the future.","Cetinkaya, Tugba; Kurt, Muhammed M; Akpolat, Cetin",,,236
256083,"Near-term pregnant women's attitude toward, concern about and knowledge of the COVID-19 pandemic",2020,"Many accessibility features available on mobile platforms require applications (apps) to provide complete and accurate metadata describing user interface (UI) components. Unfortunately, many apps do not provide sufficient metadata for accessibility features to work as expected. In this paper, we explore inferring accessibility metadata for mobile apps from their pixels, as the visual interfaces often best reflect an app's full functionality. We trained a robust, fast, memory-efficient, on-device model to detect UI elements using a dataset of 77,637 screens (from 4,068 iPhone apps) that we collected and annotated. To further improve UI detections and add semantic information, we introduced heuristics (e.g., UI grouping and ordering) and additional models (e.g., recognize UI content, state, interactivity). We built Screen Recognition to generate accessibility metadata to augment iOS VoiceOver. In a study with 9 screen reader users, we validated that our approach improves the accessibility of existing mobile apps, enabling even previously inaccessible apps to be used.","Zhang, Xiaoyi; Greef, Lilian de; Swearngin, Amanda; White, Samuel; Murray, Kyle; Yu, Lisa; Shan, Qi; Nichols, Jeffrey; Wu, Jason; Fleizach, Chris; Everitt, Aaron; Bigham, Jeffrey P.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.04893v1.pdf,236
258098,Evaluating the Efficacy of Therapies in Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic has had unprecedented social and economic consequences in the United States. Therefore, accurately predicting the dynamics of the pandemic can be very beneficial. Two main elements required for developing reliable predictions include: (1) a predictive model and (2) an indicator of the current condition and status of the pandemic. As a pandemic indicator, we used the effective reproduction number (Rt), which is defined as the number of new infections transmitted by a single contagious individual in a population that may no longer be fully susceptible. To bring the pandemic under control, Rt must be less than one. To eliminate the pandemic, Rt should be close to zero. Therefore, this value may serve as a strong indicator of the current status of the pandemic. For a predictive model, we used graph neural networks (GNNs), a method that combines graphical analysis with the structure of neural networks. We developed two types of GNN models, including: (1) graph-theory-based neural networks (GTNN) and (2) neighborhood-based neural networks (NGNN). The nodes in both graphs indicated individual states in the United States. While the GTNN model's edges document functional connectivity between states, those in the NGNN model link neighboring states to one another. We trained both models with Rt numbers collected over the previous four days and asked them to predict the following day for all states in the United States. The performance of these models was evaluated with the datasets that included Rt values reflecting conditions from 22 January through 26 November 2020 (before the start of COVID-19 vaccination in the United States). To determine the efficiency, we compared the results of two models with each other and with those generated by a baseline Long short-term memory (LSTM) model. The results indicated that the GTNN model outperformed both the NGNN and LSTM models for predicting Rt.","Davahli, Mohammad Reza; Fiok, Krzysztof; Karwowski, Waldemar; Aljuaid, Awad M; Taiar, Redha",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,236

So far, little is known about the role of an internet approach in COVID-19 participatory surveillance. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to investigate whether an online survey can provide population-level information for observing prevalence trends during the early phase of an outbreak and identifying potential risk factors of COVID-19 infection. METHODS: A 10-item online questionnaire was developed according to medical guidelines and relevant publications. It was distributed between January 24 and February 17, 2020. The characteristics of respondents and temporal changes of various questionnaire-derived indicators were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 18,161 questionnaires were returned, including 6.45% (n=1171) from Wuhan City. Geographical distributions of the respondents were consistent with the population per province (R2=0.61, P<.001). History of contact significantly decreased with time, both outside Wuhan City (R2=0.35, P=.002) and outside Hubei Province (R2=0.42, P<.001). The percentage of respondents reporting a fever peaked around February 8 (R2=0.57, P<.001) and increased with a history of contact in the areas outside Wuhan City (risk ratio 1.31, 95% CI 1.13-1.52, P<.001). Male sex, advanced age, and lung diseases were associated with a higher risk of fever in the general population with a history of contact. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows the usefulness of an online questionnaire for the surveillance of outbreaks like COVID-19 by providing information about trends of the disease and aiding the identification of potential risk factors.","Luo, Hongxing; Lie, Yongchan; Prinzen, Frits W",JMIR Public Health Surveill,,236

VTE developed at a median of 21 days (interquartile range 13.25-31) since onset. Independent factors for VTE were advancing age, cancer, longer interval from symptom onset to admission, lower fibrinogen and higher D-dimer on admission, and D-dimer increment (DI) &#8805;1.5-fold; of these, DI &#8805;1.5-fold had the most significant association (OR 14.18, 95% CI 6.25-32.18, p = 2.23 × 10-10 ). A novel model consisting of three simple coagulation variables (fibrinogen and D-dimer levels on admission, and DI &#8805;1.5-fold) showed good prediction for symptomatic VTE (area under the curve 0.865, 95% CI 0.822-0.907, sensitivity 0.930, specificity 0.710). CONCLUSIONS: There is an excess risk of VTE in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. This novel model can aid early identification of patients who are at high risk for VTE.","Li, Jun-Ying; Wang, Hong-Fei; Yin, Ping; Li, Di; Wang, Di-Le; Peng, Peng; Wang, Wei-Hua; Wang, Lan; Yuan, Xiao-Wei; Xie, Jin-Yuan; Zhou, Fan; Xiong, Nian; Shao, Feng; Wang, Chun-Xiu; Tong, Xiang; Ye, Hao; Wan, Wen-Jun; Liu, Ben-De; Li, Wen-Zhu; Li, Qian; Tang, Liang V; Hu, Yu; Lip, Gregory Y H",J Thromb Haemost,,236

292582,Clinical value analysis of IgM and IgG antibodies detected by nucleic acid in patients with COVID-19,2021,"Heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) system is favourable for regulating indoor temperature, relative humidity, airflow pattern and air quality. However, HVAC systems may turn out to be the culprit of microbial contamination in enclosed spaces and deteriorate the environment due to inappropriate design and operation. In the context of COVID-19, significant transformations and new requirements are occurring in HVAC systems. Recently, several updated operational guidelines for HVAC systems have been issued by various institutions to control the airborne transmission and mitigate infection risks in enclosed environments. Challenges and innovations emerge in response to operational variations of HVAC systems. To efficiently prevent the spread of the pandemic and reduce infection risks, it is essential to have an overall understanding of impacts caused by COVID-19 on HVAC systems. Therefore, the objectives of this article are to: (a) provide a comprehensive review of the airborne transmission characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 in enclosed spaces and a theoretical basis for HVAC operation guideline revision;(b) investigate HVAC-related guidelines to clarify the operational variations of HVAC systems during the pandemic;(c) analyse how operational variations of HVAC systems affect energy consumption;and (d) identify the innovations and research trends concerning future HVAC systems. Furthermore, this paper compares the energy consumption of HVAC system operation during the normal times versus pandemic period, based on a case study in China, providing a reference for other countries around the world. Results of this paper offer comprehensive insights into how to keep indoor environments safe while maintaining energy-efficient operation of HVAC systems.","Zheng, Wandong Hu Jingfan Wang Zhaoying Li Jinbo Fu Zheng Li Han Jurasz Jakub Chou S.

Rates of opioid use and opioid agonist maintenance treatment have increased substantially in recent years, particularly among women. Trends and outcomes of opioids use on fertility, pregnancy and breastfeeding, and longer-term child developmental outcomes have not been well-described. Here, we review the existing literature on the health effects of opioid use on female fertility, pregnancy, breastmilk and the exposed infant. We find that the current literature is primarily concentrated on the impact of opioid use in pregnancy and neonatal outcomes, with little exploration of effects on fertility. Studies are limited in number, some with small sample sizes, and many are hampered by methodological challenges related to confounding and other potential biases. Opioid use is becoming more prevalent due to environmental pressures such as COVID-19. More research is needed to better elucidate its effects on reproductive health among younger women and support the development of evidence-based recommendations for safe prescription practices and public health messaging.","Corsi, Daniel J; Murphy, Malia S Q",Basic Clin Pharmacol Toxicol,,236

305321,New fever and acute heart failure weeks after COVID-19 – red flags for multisystem inflammatory syndrome in adults,2021,"Background: Social isolation and loneliness are associated with morbidity and mortality and are highly prevalent in older adults. Older adults are a high-risk group for developing serious complications from COVID-19 and as a result were asked to shelter-in-place. This limitation on their activities and physical interactions may impact social isolation and loneliness. We aimed to determine the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on social isolation and loneliness among older adults who participated in the Leveraging Exercise to Age in Place (LEAP) Study. Methods: We conducted a pre-post analysis using paired t-tests of cognitively intact, community-dwelling older adults in Los Angeles, California previously enrolled in in-person exercise classes as part of the LEAP study prior to March 19th, 2020 when California started shelter-in-place. Participants (n=59) &gt;50 years, had social connectedness, loneliness, and demographic data collected pre-and post-COVID shelter-in-place. Participants' social connectedness was measured via the 11-question Duke Social Support Index (DSSI) and loneliness via the 3-question UCLA Loneliness Scale (UCLA 3). Results: Participants had an average (±SD) baseline DSSI of 27.2 (± 3.5) and UCLA 3 of 4.8 (± 1.7) and were an average of 76.6 ± 9.2 years, 81% female, 63% white, 29% widowed, 42% living alone, 27% acting as caregivers, and 44% were diagnosed with 3 or more chronic health conditions. We completed post-assessments on average 61 ± 29 days after the start of shelter-in-place. Results of the paired t-tests indicated no statistically significant difference in social connectedness and loneliness pre-and post-shelter-in-place. Conclusions: Following the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, changes in social isolation and loneliness were not statistically significant. Reasons for the lack of observed change include: the limitations of a small sample size, possible protective factors from prior enrollment in the LEAP program, or insufficient time at post-assessment to develop changes in loneliness and social isolation. However, given the lasting effects on morbidity and mortality and the early timing of assessments, changes should continue to be monitored via repeat assessments.","Reddy, M.

Therefore, understanding dog ownership on a fine scale is critical. The main objectives of this study were to explore dog management in rural localities from central Chile focusing on modeling owner-related variables associated with dog confinement and characterize confined and FRDs populations. Interviews (170) were carried out in Paine municipality, reporting a human:dog ratio of 1.5:1, and dogs in most households (85.9%, 146/170). Thirty-seven percent (54/146) of those households did not confine their dog(s) to some degree, and 41% (196/472) of surveyed dogs were FRD. Based on multivariable logistic regression models, non-confinement was decreased by (i) negative opinion of owners toward roaming behavior of their dogs, (ii) negative opinion toward FRDs, among others. Dog confinement increased along with owners' concerns about the impacts of their dogs on others. Owned-FRDs tended to have poorer general care than confined dogs. Our findings represent a contribution to the understanding of the human dimensions behind FRDs and provide critical quantitative elements to consider when planning effective control strategies.","Astorga, Francisca; Poo-Muñoz, Daniela Alejandra; Organ, John; Medina-Vogel, Gonzalo",J Appl Anim Welf Sci,,236

OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to utilize a large, nationally representative dataset of critically ill adults with COVID-19 to determine which factors explain mortality variability. METHODS: In this multicenter cohort study, we examined adults hospitalized in intensive care units with COVID-19 at 70 United States hospitals between March and June 2020. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. We examined patient-level and hospital-level variables. Mixed-effects logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with interhospital variation. The median odds ratio (OR) was calculated to compare outcomes in higher- vs. lower-mortality hospitals. A gradient boosted machine algorithm was developed for individual-level mortality models. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A total of 4,019 patients were included, 1537 (38%) of whom died by 28 days. Mortality varied considerably across hospitals (0-82%). After adjustment for patient- and hospital-level domains, interhospital variation was attenuated (OR decline from 2.06 [95% CI, 1.73-2.37] to 1.22 [95% CI, 1.00-1.38]), with the greatest changes occurring with adjustment for acute physiology, socioeconomic status, and strain. For individual patients, the relative contribution of each domain to mortality risk was: acute physiology (49%), demographics and comorbidities (20%), socioeconomic status (12%), strain (9%), hospital quality (8%), and treatments (3%). CONCLUSION: There is considerable interhospital variation in mortality for critically ill patients with COVID-19, which is mostly explained by hospital-level socioeconomic status, strain, and acute physiologic differences. Individual mortality is driven mostly by patient-level factors.

Thirty such samples (taken as cases) showing detectable CT of > 35 cycle in E-gene which were negative for other target genes of SARS-CoV-2 and 30 samples with undetectable fluorescence in E-gene were taken as controls for investigation. An in-vitro diagnostic approved commercial qRT-PCR multiplex kit detecting 33 respiratory pathogens which can also detect Haemophilus influenzae was used for screening the samples. It was observed that out of the 30 samples showing detectable CT> 35 in E-gene, 11 samples were positive for Haemophilus influenzae whereas in the controls only three samples were positive for H. influenzae (p-value: 0.03) which was statistically significant. Further, the probes and primers were screened against H. influenzae for matches in the genome. It was observed that all primers and probes for the E-gene of SARS-CoV-2 had over 13 bp long sequences matching 100% with multiple sites across the H. influenzae genome. This qRT-PCR primer & probes are being used extensively across India, and laboratories using them should be aware of the cross-reactivity of primers & probes with the H. influenzae genome. Further, the authors observed that 95.9% (5415/5642) of COVID-19 positive cases detected in their laboratory were asymptomatic at the time of collection of samples.

To address the significance of CMOS image 'sensors' usage in disease diagnosis systems, this paper focuses on the CIS incorporated disease diagnosis systems related to vital organs of the human body like the heart, lungs, brain, eyes, intestines, bones, skin, blood, and bacteria cells causing diseases. This literature survey's main objective is to evaluate the 'systems' capabilities and highlight the most potent ones with advantages, disadvantages, and accuracy, that are used in disease diagnosis. This systematic review used PRISMA workflow for study selection methodology, and the parameter-based evaluation is performed on disease diagnosis systems related to the human body's organs. The corresponding CIS models used in systems are mapped organ-wise, and the data collected over the last decade are tabulated.","Sukhavasi, Suparshya Babu; Sukhavasi, Susrutha Babu; Elleithy, Khaled; Abuzneid, Shakour; Elleithy, Abdelrahman",Sensors (Basel),,236
321649,Impact of the Coronavirus disease 2019 Pandemic on Outpatient Antibiotic Prescriptions in the United States,2020,"In the absence of definitive therapy for coronavirus disease (COVID-19), convalescent plasma therapy (CPT) may be a critical therapeutic option. This review was conducted to evaluate the impact of CPT in COVID-19 patients based on the publications reported to date. A robust screening of electronic databases was conducted up to 10th July 2020. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), cohort studies, and case series with a control group evaluating the effectiveness and safety of CPT in patients with COVID-19 are included for the meta-analyses. Our search retrieved seven studies, including two RCTs and five cohort studies, with a total of 5444 patients. In patients with COVID-19, the use of CPT reduces mortality (odd's ratio [OR] 0.44; 95% CI, 0.25-0.77), increases viral clearance (OR, 11.29; 95% CI, 4.9-25.9) and improves clinically (OR, 2.06; 95% CI, 0.8 to 4.9). However, the evidence is of low quality (mortality reduction, and viral clearance), and very low quality (clinical improvement). CPT may be beneficial for reducing mortality, viral shedding and improving clinical conditions in COVID-19 patients. However, further randomized control trials (RCT) are required to substantiate the safety margin, initiation, optimal dosage, titre and duration of CPT.","Sarkar, Soumya; Soni, Kapil D; Khanna, Puneet",J. med. virol,,236

Patients with underlying cardiovascular conditions are at high risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection, and COVID-19 patients have high incidence of cardiovascular complications such as acute cardiac injury, arrhythmias, heart failure, and thromboembolism. The disease has no approved proven effective therapy and hence repurposing of existing approved drugs has been considered as the fastest treatment approach. Statins have been shown to exhibit lipid lowering dependent and independent cardiovascular protective effects as well as favorable effects in various other pathophysiological states. These beneficial properties of statins are a result of their multiple pleotropic effects that include, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, antithrombotic and antimicrobial properties. In this review, we provide a comprehensive description of the mechanisms of the pleotropic effects of statins, the relevant pre-clinical and clinical data pertinent to their role in infections and acute lung injury, the possible cardiovascular benefits of statins in COVID-19, and the implications of the therapeutic potential of statins in COVID-19 disease.

Understanding the impact of coronaviruses (CoVs) on host cells is very important for disease treatment. The SARS-CoV-2 envelope (E) protein is a small structural protein involved in many aspects of the viral life cycle. The E protein promotes the packaging and reproduction of the virus, and deletion of this protein weakens or even abolishes the virulence. This review aims to establish new knowledge by combining recent advances in the study of the SARS-CoV-2 E protein and by comparing it with the SARS-CoV E protein. The E protein amino acid sequence, structure, self-assembly characteristics, viroporin mechanisms and inhibitors are summarized and analyzed herein. Although the mechanisms of the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV E proteins are similar in many respects, specific studies on the SARS-CoV-2 E protein, for both monomers and oligomers, are still lacking. A comprehensive understanding of this protein should prompt further studies on the design and characterization of effective targeted therapeutic measures.","Cao, Yipeng; Yang, Rui; Lee, Imshik; Zhang, Wenwen; Sun, Jiana; Wang, Wei; Meng, Xiangfei",Protein Sci,,236

Although measures were taken to restrict hospital visits, traditional paper-based registration is insufficient to screen and monitor the numbers of visitors to a large hospital. METHODS: Throughout March 2020, during the coronavirus disease 2019 crisis, a computer system was deployed in the 2800-bed Taipei Veterans General Hospital (Taipei, Taiwan) to register, screen, and monitor inpatient visitors. This system comprised three parts: online registration form, entrance check-in interface, and registration database. The early utilization of this newly deployed system was then analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 22,336 visits were recorded between March 11, 2020, and March 31, 2020, with 1064 a day on average. Out of these visits, 18.1% (n = 4049) had made online reservations within 48 hours. On the other hand, of all 4941 online reservations, 18.1% (n = 892) were no-shows. In the last 12 days of the study period, eight prospective visitors were identified as ineligible by the computer system, and so their visits were denied. CONCLUSION: Using a computer system, the hospital was able to enforce restrictions on hospital visits. Although the online registration system had not been fully used yet in the early phase of adoption, its superiority from the standpoint of disease control should enable hospital managers to consider abolishing on-site visitor registration.","Hsu, Chia-An; Yuan, Eunice J; Fen, Jun-Jeng; Lee, Chung-Yuan; Ming, Jin-Lain; Chen, Tzeng-Ji; Lee, Wui-Chiang; Chen, Shih-Ann",J Chin Med Assoc,,236

This paper presented a navigation system that makes feasible the delivery of parcels with autonomous drones. The system generates a path between a start and a final point and controls the drone to follow this path based on its localization obtained through GPS, 9DoF IMU, and barometer. In the landing phase, information of poses estimated by a marker (ArUco) detection technique using a camera, ultrawideband (UWB) devices, and the drone’s software estimation are merged by utilizing an extended Kalman filter algorithm to improve the landing precision. A vector field-based method controls the drone to follow the desired path smoothly, reducing vibrations or harsh movements that could harm the transported parcel. Real experiments validate the delivery strategy and allow the evaluation of the performance of the adopted techniques. Preliminary results state the viability of our proposal for autonomous drone delivery.","Miranda, Victor R. F.; Rezende, Adriano M. C.; Rocha, Thiago L.; Azpúrua, Héctor Pimenta Luciano C.

The extent to which countries are prepared to identify and respond to these risks adequately is a critical factor. We therefore construct an index of epidemiological susceptibility risk (ESR), which we use to predict business performance around the world. The index captures the role of infrastructure, demographics, economic activity and institutional governance. It proves a significant predictor of corporate sales growth. It also fares well in explaining business performance during the Covid-19 pandemic. The results remain robust to various sensitivity and endogeneity tests and after controlling for different non-economic and institutional factors.

The results of this study parallel many of the headlines in the popular press at the time. We found that about three-quarters of respondents were simply buying the food they could get due to out of stock situations and about half the participants bought more food than usual. As a result of foodservice closures, consumers indicated purchasing more groceries than normal. Consumers attempted to avoid shopping in stores, relying heavily on grocery delivery and pick-up services during the beginning of the pandemic when no clear rules were in place. Results show a 255% increase in the number of households that use grocery pickup as a shopping method and a 158% increase in households that utilize grocery delivery services. The spike in pickup and delivery program participation can be explained by consumers fearing COVID-19 and feeling unsafe. Food consumption patterns for major food groups seemed to stay the same for the majority of participants, but a large share indicated that they had been snacking more since the beginning of the pandemic which was offset by a sharp decline in fast food consumption.","Chenarides, Lauren; Grebitus, Carola; Lusk, Jayson L; Printezis, Iryna",,,236

In addition to the progression of the disease, these symptoms are aggravated by physical inactivity. Therefore, home confinement due to COVID-19 pandemic restrictions could further worsen these symptoms. This study aims to analyze the effect of home confinement on objective and subjective sleep quality, cardiac autonomic control based on heart rate variability (HRV), and health-related quality of life in people with MS. METHODS: Actigraphic and subjective sleep quality (Karolinska Sleep Diary, KSD), HRV (Polar-H7), and quality of life (Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life-54) were measured before and after 2 months of home confinement in 17 people with MS (7:10 men/women; age: 43.41±10.88 years; body mass index: 24.87±3.31â¯kg/m2; Expanded Disability Status Scale: 2.85±1.34 a.u.). RESULTS: Actigraphic sleep quality (sleep efficiency: ES=1.27, pâ¯=â¯0.01, sleep time: ES=0.81, pâ¯=â¯0.01) and subjective sleep quality (sleep quality: ES=-0.34, pâ¯=â¯0.05), sleep comfort: ES=0.60; pâ¯=â¯0.03, ease of falling asleep: ES=0.70; pâ¯=â¯0.01, ease of waking up: ES=0.87, p<0.01, and having enough sleep: ES=0.87, p<0.01) significantly decreased after home confinement. No differences were observed in HRV or quality of life variables (pâ¯&#8805;â¯0.13). CONCLUSIONS: Home confinement has worsened the sleep quality, but not in cardiac autonomic control or quality of life, in people with MS. These data highlight the importance of implementing home physical training programs in this population when situations similar to home confinement occur, thus minimizing the negative effects of physical inactivity and their associated comorbidities.","Andreu-Caravaca, Luis; Ramos-Campo, Domingo; Manonelles, Pedro; Abellán-Aynés, Oriol; Chung, Linda H; Rubio-Arias, Jacobo Á",Physiol Behav,,236

356215,Viewpoint of a WHO Advisory Group Tasked to Consider Establishing a Closely-monitored Challenge Model of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Healthy Volunteers,2021,"Online-learning is a feasible alternative to in-person attendance during COVID-19 pandemic. In this period, information technologies have allowed sharing experiences, but have also highlighted some limitations compared to traditional learning. Learning is strongly supported by some qualities of consciousness such as flow (intended as the optimal state of absorption and engagement activity) and sense of presence (feeling of exerting control, interacting with and getting immersed into real/virtual environments), behavioral, emotional, and cognitive engagement, together with the need for social interaction. During online learning, feelings of disconnection, social isolation, distractions, boredom, and lack of control exert a detrimental effect on the ability to reach the state of flow, the feeling of presence, the feeling of social involvement. Since online environments could prevent the rising of these learning-supporting variables, this article aims at describing the role of flow, presence, engagement, and social interactions during online sessions and at characterizing multisensory stimulations as a driver to cope with these issues. We argue that the use of augmented, mixed, or virtual reality can support the above-mentioned domains, and thus counteract the detrimental effects of physical distance. Such support could be further increased by enhancing multisensory stimulation modalities within augmented and virtual environments.","Cesari, V.; Galgani, B.; Gemignani, A.; Menicucci, D.",Behavioral sciences,,236
356503,Will Coronavirus Disease 2019 Become Seasonal?,2020,"The outbreak of a global pandemic called coronavirus has created unprecedented circumstances resulting into a large number of deaths and risk of community spreading throughout the world. Desperate times have called for desperate measures to detect the disease at an early stage via various medically proven methods like chest computed tomography (CT) scan, chest X-Ray, etc., in order to prevent the virus from spreading across the community. Developing deep learning models for analysing these kinds of radiological images is a well-known methodology in the domain of computer based medical image analysis. However, doing the same by mimicking the biological models and leveraging the newly developed neuromorphic computing chips might be more economical. These chips have been shown to be more powerful and are more efficient than conventional central and graphics processing units. Additionally, these chips facilitate the implementation of spiking neural networks (SNNs) in real-world scenarios. To this end, in this work, we have tried to simulate the SNNs using various deep learning libraries. We have applied them for the classification of chest CT scan images into COVID and non-COVID classes. Our approach has achieved very high F1 score of 0.99 for the potential-based model and outperforms many state-of-the-art models.

357454,Comparison Between Hospitalized Patients Affected or Not Affected by Coronavirus Disease 2019,2021,"BACKGROUND/AIM: The aim of the study was to examine the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on glaucoma surgical practices within the UK. METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey was distributed to all consultant glaucoma specialists who are on the UK and Eire Glaucoma Society contact list. Participants were asked specific questions regarding preferences in glaucoma surgical practices and whether these had changed subsequent to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Trabeculectomy was the procedure of choice for 61 (87%) glaucoma specialists. A total of 51 (73%) respondents reported performing minimally invasive glaucoma surgery (MIGS) procedures before the COVID-19 pandemic. The most commonly performed MIGS procedure was the iStent inject (51%), followed by XEN 45 (36%) and Preserflo (17%). Forty-three (61%) respondents reported modifying their glaucoma surgery practice subsequent to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Of the glaucoma specialists who modified their surgical practices, 21 (43%) specifically reduced the number of trabeculectomies performed. In combination, diode laser (both micropulse and conventional trans-scleral cyclodiode) was the most common alternative procedure. Glaucoma drainage devices, deep sclerectomy and Preserflo were also commonly chosen alternatives. CONCLUSION: Although trabeculectomy remains the most commonly performed established glaucoma surgery, it is being performed with reduced frequency during the COVID-19 pandemic due to the number of postoperative visits and procedures required. Alternatives such as conventional and micropulse diode laser, glaucoma drainage devices, deep sclerectomy and Preserflo appear to be the favoured alternative procedures.","Holland, Lee Joseph; Kirwan, James F; Mercieca, Karl J",Br. j. ophthalmol,,236

361843,Association between renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockers and outcome in coronavirus disease 2019: analysing in-hospital exposure generates a biased seemingly protective effect of treatment,2020,"Introduction: The current COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has impacted the delivery of dental care globally and has led to re-evaluation of infection control standards. However, lack of clarity around what is known and unknown regarding droplet and aerosol generation in dentistry (including oral surgery and extractions), and their relative risk to patients and the dental team, necessitates a review of evidence relating to specific dental procedures. This review is part of a wider body of research exploring the evidence on bioaerosols in dentistry and involves detailed consideration of the risk of contamination in relation to oral surgery. Methods: A comprehensive search of Medline (OVID), Embase (OVID), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Scopus, Web of Science, LILACS and ClinicalTrials.Gov was conducted using key terms and MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) words relating to the review questions. Methodological quality including sensitivity was assessed using a schema developed to measure quality aspects of studies using a traffic light system to allow inter- and intra-study overview and comparison. A narrative synthesis was conducted for assessment of the included studies and for the synthesis of results. Results: Eleven studies on oral surgery (including extractions) were included in the review. They explored microbiological (bacterial and fungal) and blood (visible and/or imperceptible) contamination at the person level (patients, operators and assistants) and/or at a wider environmental level, using settle plates, chemiluminescence reagents or air samplers; all within 1 m of the surgical site. Studies were of generally low to medium quality and highlighted an overall risk of contaminated aerosol, droplet and splatter generation during oral surgery procedures, most notably during removal of impacted teeth using rotatory handpieces. Risk of contamination and spread was increased by factors, including proximity to the operatory site, longer duration of treatment, higher procedural complexity, non-use of an extraoral evacuator and areas involving more frequent contact during treatment. Conclusion: A risk of contamination (microbiological, visible and imperceptible blood) to patients, dental team members and the clinical environment is present during oral surgery procedures, including routine extractions. However, the extent of contamination has not been explored fully in relation to time and distance. Variability across studies with regards to the analysis methods used and outcome measures makes it difficult to draw robust conclusions. Further studies with improved methodologies, including higher test sensitivity and consideration of viruses, are required to validate these findings.","Gallagher, Jennifer E; K C, Sukriti; Johnson, Ilona G; Al-Yaseen, Waraf; Jones, Rhiannon; McGregor, Scott; Robertson, Mark; Harris, Rebecca; Innes, Nicola; Wade, William G",BDJ Open,,236

Here, we have developed a simple mass spectrometry assay for SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal swab samples using common laboratory reagents. The method employs high sensitivity and selectivity targeted mass spectrometry detection, monitoring nine constitutive peptides representative of the three main viral proteins and a straightforward pellet digestion protocol for convenient routine applications. Absolute quantification of N, M, and S proteins was achieved by addition of isotope-labeled versions of best peptides. Limit of detection, recovery, precision, and linearity were thoroughly evaluated in four representative viral transport media (VTM) containing distinct total protein content. The protocol was sensitive in all swab media with limit of detection determined at 2 × 103 pfu/mL, corresponding to as low as 30 pfu injected into the LC-MS/MS system. When tested on VTM-stored nasopharyngeal swab samples from positive and control patients, sensitivity was similar to or better than rapid immunoassay dipsticks, revealing a corresponding RT-PCR detection threshold at Ct â¼ 24. The study represents the first thorough evaluation of sensitivity and robustness of targeted mass spectrometry in nasal swabs, constituting a promising SARS-CoV-2 antigen assay for the first-line diagnosis of COVID-19 and compatible with the constraints of clinical settings.

In two studies, we replicated recent research demonstrating that conservatives report lower support for social distancing compared to liberals. However, in Study 1 we found support for a moderating role of trust in science, such that conservatives reported stronger intentions to socially distance when they had high trust in science. In Study 2, we enhanced trust in messaging about social distancing – and in turn, social distancing intentions among conservatives – by having the messages come from a Republican (vs. unidentified) government official.

Prevention and control strategies require an improved understanding of SARS-CoV-2 dynamics. We did a rapid review of the literature on SARS-CoV-2 viral dynamics with a focus on infective dose. We sought comparisons of SARS-CoV-2 with other respiratory viruses including SARS-CoV-1 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. We examined laboratory animal and human studies. The literature on infective dose, transmission and routes of exposure was limited specially in humans, and varying endpoints were used for measurement of infection. Despite variability in animal studies, there was some evidence that increased dose at exposure correlated with higher viral load clinically, and severe symptoms. Higher viral load measures did not reflect coronavirus disease 2019 severity. Aerosol transmission seemed to raise the risk of more severe respiratory complications in animals. An accurate quantitative estimate of the infective dose of SARS-CoV-2 in humans is not currently feasible and needs further research. Our review suggests that it is small, perhaps about 100 particles. Further work is also required on the relationship between routes of transmission, infective dose, co-infection and outcomes.","Karimzadeh, Sedighe; Bhopal, Raj; Nguyen Tien, Huy",Epidemiol Infect,,236

Because of the large number of cultivars, it is necessary to prioritize extracts before proceeding to clinical trials. Purpose: To compare extracts of two unique cannabis cultivars (CT-921, CT-928) for treatment of neuropathic pain induced by constriction of sciatic nerve in mice and to illustrate the use of this animal model to set priority for future trials. Methods: Pain severity was measured by threshold force causing paw withdrawal. Dose-response relationships and time course were determined for intravenously injected extracts of cultivars and vehicle. The doses for allodynia relief were correlated with decreased respiratory rate, temperature and behavioral changes. Results: Effective analgesic dose for 50 and 95% (ED50An and ED95An) was 15, and 29 mg/kg for CT-921 and 0.9 and 4.7 for CT-928. At ED50An, for both extracts, the duration was 120 min. At ED95An, administration of CT-928 significantly decreased respiratory rate while CT-921 did not. CT-928 decreased temperature more than CT-921. CT-928 produced frantic hyperactivity not seen with CT-921. At equivalent analgesic doses, THC was much less in CT-921 than in CT-928 suggesting interactions with components other than THC influenced the analgesia. At equivalent analgesic doses, efficacy-to-adverse effect profile for CT-928 was worse than for CT-921. Conclusion: Both extracts relieved neuropathic pain; however, CT-921 had a better efficacy-to-adverse effect profile, a rational basis for prioritizing cultivars for future clinical evaluation.","Rouhollahi, Elham; MacLeod, Bernard A; Barr, Alasdair M; Puil, Ernest",Drug Des Devel Ther,,236

389832,A Case of Guillain-Barré Syndrome Associated With COVID-19,2020,"Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), an infectious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been associated with acute kidney injury, presumably due to acute tubular injury. However, this does not explain proteinuria, sometimes severe, and hematuria often observed. We present 2 African American patients with glomerulopathy demonstrated by kidney biopsy in the setting of acute kidney injury and COVID-19 infection. Kidney biopsy specimens showed a collapsing variant of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis in addition to acute tubular injury. Both patients were homozygous for apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1). COVID-19 infection likely caused the interferon surge as a second hit causing podocyte injury leading to collapsing focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. APOL1 testing should be strongly considered in African American patients with nephrotic-range proteinuria. More data from future kidney biopsies will further elucidate the pathology of kidney injury and glomerular involvement from COVID-19 infections.","Magoon, Sandeep; Bichu, Prasad; Malhotra, Varun; Alhashimi, Fatema; Hu, Yanglin; Khanna, Siddharth; Berhanu, Kabaye",Kidney Med.,,236

METHODS: From December 14, 2020, to February 28, 2021, we used data from the ""v-safe after vaccination health checker"" surveillance system, the v-safe pregnancy registry, and the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) to characterize the initial safety of mRNA Covid-19 vaccines in pregnant persons. RESULTS: A total of 35,691 v-safe participants 16 to 54 years of age identified as pregnant. Injection-site pain was reported more frequently among pregnant persons than among nonpregnant women, whereas headache, myalgia, chills, and fever were reported less frequently. Among 3958 participants enrolled in the v-safe pregnancy registry, 827 had a completed pregnancy, of which 115 (13.9%) resulted in a pregnancy loss and 712 (86.1%) resulted in a live birth (mostly among participants with vaccination in the third trimester). Adverse neonatal outcomes included preterm birth (in 9.4%) and small size for gestational age (in 3.2%); no neonatal deaths were reported. Although not directly comparable, calculated proportions of adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes in persons vaccinated against Covid-19 who had a completed pregnancy were similar to incidences reported in studies involving pregnant women that were conducted before the Covid-19 pandemic. Among 221 pregnancy-related adverse events reported to the VAERS, the most frequently reported event was spontaneous abortion (46 cases). CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary findings did not show obvious safety signals among pregnant persons who received mRNA Covid-19 vaccines. However, more longitudinal follow-up, including follow-up of large numbers of women vaccinated earlier in pregnancy, is necessary to inform maternal, pregnancy, and infant outcomes.","Shimabukuro, Tom T; Kim, Shin Y; Myers, Tanya R; Moro, Pedro L; Oduyebo, Titilope; Panagiotakopoulos, Lakshmi; Marquez, Paige L; Olson, Christine K; Liu, Ruiling; Chang, Karen T; Ellington, Sascha R; Burkel, Veronica K; Smoots, Ashley N; Green, Caitlin J; Licata, Charles; Zhang, Bicheng C; Alimchandani, Meghna; Mba-Jonas, Adamma; Martin, Stacey W; Gee, Julianne M; Meaney-Delman, Dana M",N Engl J Med,,236

Early epidemiological comparisons with two previous coronaviruses, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), also made it easier to predict COVID-19's likely spread and lethality. This article assesses whether academic interest in prior coronavirus research has translated into interest in the primary source material, using Mendeley reader counts for early academic impact evidence. The results confirm that SARS and MERS research 2008-2017 experienced anomalously high increases in Mendeley readers in April-May 2020. Nevertheless, studies learning COVID-19 lessons from SARS and MERS or using them as a benchmark for COVID-19 have generated much more academic interest than primary studies of SARS or MERS. Thus, research that interprets prior relevant research for new diseases when they are discovered seems to be particularly important to help researchers to understand its implications in the new context.","Thelwall, Mike",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.03901v1.pdf,236

400204,Covid-19: Cases of inflammatory syndrome in children surge after urgent alert,2020,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate how the COVID-19 pandemic affected the number of people aged 50+ years presenting to primary care with features that could potentially indicate cancer, and to explore how reporting differed by patient characteristics and in face-to-face vs remote consultations. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A retrospective cohort study of general practitioner (GP), nurse and paramedic primary care consultations in 21 practices in South-West England covering 123 947 patients. The models compared potential cancer indicators reported in April-July 2019 with April-July 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Potential indicators of cancer were identified using code lists for symptoms, signs, test results and diagnoses listed in the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence suspected cancer referral guidance (NG12). RESULTS: During April-July 2019, 17% of registered patients aged 50+ years reported a potential cancer indicator in a consultation with a GP or nurse. During April-July 2020, this reduced to 11% (incidence rate ratio (IRR) 0.64, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.67, p<0.001). Reductions in potential cancer indicators were stable across age group, sex, ethnicity, index of multiple deprivation quintile and shielding status, but less marked in patients with mental health conditions than without (IRR 0.75, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.79, interaction p<0.001). Proportions of GP consultations with potential indicators of cancer reduced between 2019 and 2020 for face-to-face consultations (IRR 0.84, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.92, p<0.001) and increased for remote consultations (IRR 1.17, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.29, p=0.001), although it remained lower in remote consulting than face-to-face in April-July 2020. This difference was greater for nurse/paramedic consultations (face-to-face: IRR 0.61, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.83, p=0.002; remote: IRR 1.60, 95% CI 1.10 to 2.333, p=0.014). CONCLUSION: The number of patients consulting with presentations that could potentially indicate cancer reduced during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Patients should be encouraged to continue contacting primary care for persistent signs and symptoms, and GPs and nurses should be encouraged to probe patients for further information during remote consulting, in the absence of non-verbal cues.","Scott, Lauren J; Murphy, Mairead; Price, Sarah; Lewis, Rhys; Denholm, Rachel; Horwood, Jeremy; Palmer, Tom; Salisbury, Chris",BMJ Open,,236

Three months before, the patient was scheduled for transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), which was postponed owing to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. Owing to COVID-19 suspicion, he underwent nasopharyngeal swab and was temporarily isolated. However, the rapid deterioration of clinical and haemodynamic conditions prompted us to perform balloon aortic valvuloplasty (BAV) as bridge to TAVI. The patient's haemodynamics improved; and the next day, the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction for COVID-19 was negative. At Day 5, he underwent TAVI procedure. Subsequent clinical course was uneventful.

However, fewer than 1% of patients in the PARADIGM-HF study had New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class IV symptoms. Accordingly, data that informed the use of S/V among patients with advanced HF were limited. The LIFE (LCZ696 in Hospitalized Advanced Heart Failure) study was a 24-week prospective, multicenter, double-blinded, double-dummy, active comparator trial that compared the safety, efficacy, and tolerability of S/V with those of valsartan in patients with advanced HFrEF. The trial planned to randomize 400 patients &#8805;18 years of age with advanced HF, defined as an EF &#8804;35%, New York Heart Association functional class IV symptoms, elevated natriuretic peptide concentration (B-type natriuretic peptide [BNP] &#8805;250 pg/ml or N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide [NT-proBNP] &#8805;800 pg/ml), and &#8805;1 objective finding of advanced HF. Following a 3- to 7-day open label run-in period with S/V (24 mg/26 mg twice daily), patients were randomized 1:1 to S/V titrated to 97 mg/103 mg twice daily versus 160 mg of V twice daily. The primary endpoint was the proportional change from baseline in the area under the curve for NT-proBNP levels measured through week 24. Secondary and tertiary endpoints included clinical outcomes and safety and tolerability. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, enrollment in the LIFE trial was stopped prematurely to ensure patient safety and data integrity.

This study aimed to determine whether the number of exposure calls related to household disinfectants (HD) received between January 30, 2020 to May 18, 2020 varied from the same time period in the previous year. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review of the poison control center database from the Fondazione Universitario Policlinico Agostino Gemelli IRCCS, Rome, Italy, was conducted. Calls from Italian citizens, hospitals, and general practitioners received during the same time period in 2019 and 2020 were compared. RESULTS: The center received 1972 exposure calls during the study period. A 5% increase in calls regarding exposure to HDs was noted from 2019 to 2020 (9.8% to 15.2%, p<0.001). The majority of enquiries regarded bleach-containing products, hand sanitizers, ethanol, and hydrogen peroxide. Most calls were received from patients in their homes (n, 259; prevalence, 86%; increase, 107%) and concerned accidental exposure (n, 280; prevalence, 93%; increase, 76%), while cases of intentional exposure decreased (n, 14; prevalence, 5%; decrease, 33%). The main route of exposure was ingestion (n, 170; prevalence, 57%; increase, 45%), but the highest increase was observed in inhalation cases (n, 82; prevalence, 27%; increase, 122%). CONCLUSIONS: As the incidence of enquiries regarding products that can represent an important health hazard, when improperly used, increased in 2020 suggests that the COVID-19 public health messaging on the proper use of HDs should be improved.","Soave, P M; Grassi, S; Oliva, A; Romanò, B; Di Stasio, E; Dominici, L; Pascali, V; Antonelli, M",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,,236

Although treatment strategies for CM are continually being developed, the mortality rate is still high. Therefore, we need to explore more therapeutic strategies that are aimed at hindering its pathogenic mechanism. In the field of CM, several studies have observed rapid iron accumulation and lipid peroxidation within the brain, all of which are hallmarks of ferroptosis, which is a type of programmed cell death that is characterized by iron dependence and lipid peroxidation. In recent years, many studies have confirmed the involvement of ferroptosis in many diseases, including infectious diseases such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection and coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). Furthermore, ferroptosis is considered as immunogenic and pro-inflammatory as the ferroptotic cells release damage-associated molecular pattern molecules (DAMPs) and alarmin, both of which regulate immunity and pro-inflammatory activity. Hence, we hypothesize that there might be a relationship between this unique cell death modality and CM. Herein, we review the evidence of ferroptosis in CM and consider the hypothesis that ferroptotic cell death may be involved in the cell death of CM.","Xu, Xianbin; Lin, Danfeng; Tu, Sheng; Gao, Shiqi; Shao, Anwen; Sheng, Jifang",Front Immunol,,236
461457,Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (mis-c) associated with COVID-19 infection presenting with steven johson syndrome,2021,"Bats are a host and reservoir for a large number of viruses, many of which are zoonotic. In North America, the big brown bat (Eptesicus fuscus) is widely distributed and common. Big brown bats are a known reservoir for rabies virus, which, combined with their propensity to roost in human structures, necessitates testing for rabies virus following human exposure. The current pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, likely of bat origin, illustrates the need for continued surveillance of wildlife and bats for potentially emerging zoonotic viruses. Viral metagenomic sequencing was performed on 39 big brown bats and one hoary bat submitted for rabies testing due to human exposure in South Dakota. A new genotype of American bat vesiculovirus was identified in seven of 17 (41%) heart and lung homogenates at high levels in addition to two of 23 viscera pools. A second rhabdovirus, Sodak rhabdovirus 1 (SDRV1), was identified in four of 23 (17%) viscera pools. Phylogenetic analysis placed SDRV1 in the genus Alphanemrhavirus, which includes two recognized species that were identified in nematodes. Finally, a highly divergent rhabdovirus, Sodak rhabdovirus 2 (SDRV2), was identified in two of 23 (8.7%) big brown bats. Phylogenetic analysis placed SDRV2 as ancestral to the dimarhabdovirus supergroup and Lyssavirus. Intracranial inoculation of mouse pups with rhabdovirus-positive tissue homogenates failed to elicit clinical disease. Further research is needed to determine the zoonotic potential of these non-rabies rhabdoviruses.","Hause, Ben M; Nelson, Eric; Christopher-Hennings, Jane",Viruses,,236

This is unexpected, especially in young infants, who are vulnerable to severe disease caused by other respiratory viruses. We evaluate convalescent immune responses in four infants under 3 months old with confirmed COVID-19 who presented with mild febrile illness, alongside their parents, and adult controls recovered from confirmed COVID-19. Although not statistically significant, compared to seropositive adults, infants have high serum levels of IgG and IgA to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with corresponding functional ability to block SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry. Infants also exhibit robust saliva anti-spike IgG and IgA responses. Spike-specific IFN-Î³ production by infant peripheral blood mononuclear cells appears restrained, but the frequency of spike-specific IFN-Î³ and/or TNF-É producing T cells is comparable between infants and adults. On principal component analysis, infant immune responses appear distinct from their parents. Robust functional antibody responses alongside restrained IFN-Î³ production may help protect infants from severe COVID-19.","Goenka, Anu; Halliday, Alice; Gregorova, Michaela; Milodowski, Emily; Thomas, Amy; Williamson, Maia Kavanagh; Baum, Holly; Oliver, Elizabeth; Long, Anna E; Knezevic, Lea; Williams, Alistair Jk; Lampasona, Vito; Piemonti, Lorenzo; Gupta, Kapil; Di Bartolo, Natalie; Berger, Imre; Toye, Ashley M; Vipond, Barry; Muir, Peter; Bernatoniene, Jolanta; Bailey, Mick; Gillespie, Kathleen M; Davidson, Andrew D; Wooldridge, Linda; Rivino, Laura; Finn, Adam",Cell Rep Med,,236

An ""Environmental Protection Interview (EPI)"" is one of the campaign-style environmental governance methods that target local officials. In this paper, the causal relationship between the implementation of EPI and pollutant emission reduction was confirmed using the method of Time-Varying Difference-in-difference (Time-Varying DID) to compensate for endogeneity problem and ensure that the results are still valid after several robustness checks. Our regional heterogeneous analysis shows that the policy effects of EPI decrease from east to west in China and that they have different emission reduction effects on various types of pollutants. Unfortunately, the results also suggest that policy implementation only temporarily affects pollutant emission reduction, which could be attributed to the governance approaches of campaign-style enforcement according to the impact mechanism analysis. This paper implies that the EPI should be continued to be implemented in the future with some improvements on pollutant reduction mechanisms to ensure effective adoption.","Zhao, Yihang; Zhang, Xinlong; Wang, Yu",,,236

469730,Laboratory predictors of severe Coronavirus Disease 2019 and lung function in followed-up,2021,"BackgroundIn healthcare settings in low- and middle-income countries, which frequently rely upon natural ventilation, the risk of aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2 remains poorly understood. We aimed to evaluate the risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in naturally-ventilated hospital settings by measuring parameters of ventilation and comparing these findings with results of bioaerosol sampling. MethodsWe measured outdoor and room CO2 to estimate absolute ventilation (liters per second [L/s]) from 9 hospitals in Bangladesh during October 2020 - February 2021. We estimated infectious risk across different spaces using a modified Wells-Riley equation. We collected air samples from these same spaces at 12.5 L/min over 30 minutes and performed RT-qPCR to detect SARS-CoV-2 N-gene. We used multivariable linear regression and calculated elasticity to identify characteristics associated with ventilation. ResultsBased on ventilation of 86 patient care areas and COVID-19 case numbers, we found that over a 40-hour exposure period, outpatient departments posed the highest median risk for infection (5.4%), followed by COVID intensive care units (1.8%). We detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA in 18.6% (16/86) of air samples. Ceiling height and total open area of doors and windows were found to have the greatest impact on ventilation. ConclusionOur findings provide evidence that naturally-ventilated healthcare settings may pose a high risk for exposure to SARS-CoV-2, particularly among non-COVID designated spaces, but improving parameters of ventilation can mitigate this risk.","Styczynski, Ashley; Hemlock, Caitlin; Hoque, Kazi Injamamul; Verma, Renu; LeBoa, Chris; Bhuiyan, Md.

METHODS: From March 16th 2020, all face-to-face consultations were cancelled in France, except for emergencies. Teleconsultation was started immediately by five senior urologists in two academic hospitals. All patients received an email survey including the validated Teleconsultation Satisfaction Questionnaire (TSQ) and demographic questions. Data were collected prospectively. Physicians also responded to the TSQ. Patient satisfaction was measured objectively with the validated 14-item TSQ. Each item was scored on a 5-point Likert scale. Factors associated with positive satisfaction with teleconsultation were assessed by multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: Overall, 105 patients replied to the survey (91.3%). Median age was 66 years (IQR: 55â71) and 95 were men (90.5%). Median overall TSQ score was 67 (IQR: 60â69); teleconsultation was judged to be a good experience by 88 patients (83.8%) and four physicians (80%). Patients who met their surgeon for the first time were more likely to have a good experience (OR = 1.2 [95% CI 1.1â1.5], p = 0.03). CONCLUSION: Introduced rapidly during the COVID-19 lockdown, urology teleconsultation attained a high level of satisfaction among both patients and physicians. A major change in telemedicine use is foreseen in the post COVID-19 era.","Pinar, Ugo; Anract, Julien; Perrot, Ophélie; Tabourin, Thomas; Chartier-Kastler, Emmanuel; Parra, Jerome; Vaessen, Christophe; de La Taille, Alexandre; Roupret, Morgan",World j. urol,,236

In this study, several 2-((indol-3-yl)thio)-N-benzyl-acetamides were identified as SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) inhibitors. After a two-round optimization, a new series of 2-((indol-3-yl)thio)-N-benzyl-acetamides was designed, synthesized, and evaluated for SARS-CoV-2 RdRp inhibitory effect. Compounds 6b2, 6b5, 6c9, 6d2, and 6d5 were identified as potent inhibitors with IC50 values of 3.35 ± 0.21 µM, 4.55 ± 0.2 µM, 1.65 ± 0.05 µM, 3.76 ± 0.79 µM, and 1.11 ± 0.05 µM, respectively; the IC50 of remdesivir (control) was measured as 1.19 ± 0.36 µM. All of the compounds inhibited RNA synthesis by SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. The most potent compound 6d5, which showed a stronger inhibitory activity against the human coronavirus HCoV-OC43 than remdesivir, is a promising candidate for further investigation.","Zhang, Guo-Ning; Zhao, Jianyuan; Li, Quanjie; Wang, Minghua; Zhu, Mei; Wang, Juxian; Cen, Shan; Wang, Yucheng",Eur J Med Chem,,236

The primary aim was to establish if follow-up at one week in place of the 72-hour British Orthopaedic Association Standards for Trauma & Orthopaedics (BOAST) guidance was safe following manipulation under anaesthetic. A parallel adaptation during lockdown was the non-expectation of Bier's block. The secondary aim was to compare clinical outcomes with respect to block type. METHODS: Overall, 90 patients were assessed in a cross-sectional cohort study using a mixed, retrospective-prospective approach. Consecutive sampling of 30 patients pre-lockdown (P1), 30 during lockdown (P2), and 30 during post-lockdown (P3) was applied. Type of block, operative status, follow-up, and complications were extracted. Primary endpoints were early complications (&lt;= one week). Secondary endpoints were later complications including malunion, delayed union or osteotomy. RESULTS: In P1, 86.6% of patients were seen between days one to three, 26.7% in P2, and 56.7% in P3. There were no documented complications from days one to three. Operative rate was 35.5%, which did not vary significantly (p= 0.712). Primary endpoints occurred between day four to seven, and included one patient each period treated for plaster cast pain. Secondary endpoints in P1 included delayed union (one patient). During P2, this included malunion (one patient), a pressure sore (one patient) and ulnar cutaneous nerve symptoms (two patients). In P3, malunion was identified in one patient. Mean follow-up was six months (4 to 9) with union rate 96%. Change in block practice varied significantly (p =&lt;0.05). The risk ratio of complications using regional block (Bier's) over haematoma block was 0.65. CONCLUSION: Follow-up adaptations during lockdown did not adversely affect patient outcomes.

476066,Effect of coronavirus disease 2019 on co 2emission in the world,2020,"OBJECTIVES, PURPOSES, OR AIM: To identify design strategies utilized in airborne infection isolation and biocontainment patient rooms that improve infection control potential in an alternative care environment. BACKGROUND: As SARS-CoV-2 spreads and health care facilities near or exceed capacity, facilities may implement alternative care sites (ACSs). With COVID-19 surges predicted, developing additional capacity in alternative facilities, including hotels and convention centers, into patient care environments requires early careful consideration of the existing space constraints, infrastructure, and modifications needed for patient care and infection control. Design-based strategies utilizing engineering solutions have the greatest impact, followed by medical and operational strategies. METHODS: This article evaluates infection control and environmental strategies in inpatient units and proposes system modifications to ACS surge facilities to reduce infection risk and improve care environments. RESULTS: Although adequate for an acute infectious disease outbreak, existing capacity in U.S. biocontainment units and airborne infection isolation rooms is not sufficient for widespread infection control and isolation during a pandemic. To improve patients' outcomes and decrease infection transmission risk in the alternative care facility, hospital planners, administrators, and clinicians can take cues from evidence-based strategies implemented in biocontainment units and standard inpatient rooms. CONCLUSIONS: Innovative technologies, including optimized air-handling systems with ultraviolet and particle filters, can be an essential part of an infection control strategy. For flexible surge capacity in future ACS and hospital projects, interdisciplinary design and management teams should apply strategies optimizing the treatment of both infectious patients and minimizing the risk to health care workers.","Gordon, David; Ward, Jane; Yao, Christopher J; Lee, Joyce",HERD,,236

480730,Management of mothers and neonates in low resources setting during covid-19 pandemia,2020,"Falling film techniques are widely used in various chemical industrial devices because of their high heat and mass transfer coefficients. Since the coverage of a liquid film plays an important role in the heat and mass transfer, the liquid film coverage on different surfaces, including hydrophilic, ribbed, and untreated plates, had been investigated experimentally in this paper. Air flowed over the liquid surface, perpendicular to the direction of the liquid flow. The film coverage and flow patterns were analyzed through the infrared photo capture by an infrared camera. The effects of the mass flow rate, inlet air velocity, and heat flux were discussed. According to the experimental results, the specific water flow rate plays the most important role, while the inlet air velocity has little effect on the film coverage. When heated, the ribbed plate performs better because the ribs can stop the dry patches from spreading further. Moreover, the empirical correlation of the local water film coverage in the fully developed region and the nominal film coverage of the entire plate was developed.","Wei, J.; Xu, X.; Zhang, J.; Liu, J.",Israel Medical Association Journal,,236

During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, routine SARS-CoV-2 testing in long-term care facilities in the Province of Salzburg and centralized hospitalization in the COVID-19 unit of the Paracelsus Medical University Salzburg (Austria) irrespective of symptoms was implemented. Baseline characteristics and the course of COVID-19 disease were assessed among hospitalized long-term care facility residents within the COVID-19 Registry of the Austrian Group Medical Tumor Therapy (AGMT; NCT04351529). Between the 24th of March and the 20th of April 2020, 50 COVID-19-positive residents were hospitalized. The median age was 84.5 years (range: 79-88) and the median number of comorbidities and baseline medication classes was 6 (IQR: 4-7) and 5 (IQR: 3-6), respectively. At admission, 31 residents (62%) were symptomatic, nine residents (18%) pre-symptomatic whereas ten residents (20%) remained asymptomatic. The 30-day mortality rate from hospitalization was 32% and significantly higher in symptomatic residents at admission when compared to asymptomatic residents including pre-symptomatic residents (48% [95% CI: 27-63%] versus 5% [95% CI: 0-15%], p=0.006). The Early Warning Score (EWS) at admission was associated with 30-day mortality: high risk: 100%, intermediate risk: 50% (95% CI: 0-78%), and low risk: 21% (95% CI: 7-32%) (p<0.001). In light of comparably low mortality rates between asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic hospitalized COVID-19-positive residents, we suggest the supply of comparable intensity and quality of monitoring and care in long-term care facilities as an alternative to immediate hospitalization upon a positive COVID-19 test in asymptomatic residents.","Huemer, Florian; Rinnerthaler, Gabriel; Jörg, Benedikt; Morre, Patrick; Stegbuchner, Birgit; Proksch, Elisabeth; Fleimisch, Stefanie; Oberkofler, Hannes; Kremser, Iris; Greil, Richard; Egle, Alexander",Geroscience,,236
486626,Why Contact Tracing Efforts Have Failed to Curb Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Transmission in Much of the United States,2021,"Autoantibodies to interferon(IFN)-&#945; and IFN-&#969; (type I IFNs) were recently reported as causative for severe COVID-19 in the general population. Autoantibodies against IFN-&#945; and IFN-&#969; are present in almost all patients with Autoimmune-Polyendocrine-Syndrome Type 1 (APS-1) caused by biallelic deleterious or heterozygous dominant mutations in AIRE. We therefore hypothesized that autoantibodies against type I IFNs also predispose patients with APS-1 to severe COVID-19. We prospectively studied six patients with APS-1 between April 1st, 2020 and April 1st, 2021. Biobanked pre-COVID-19 sera of APS-1 subjects were tested for neutralizing autoantibodies to IFN-&#945;and IFN-&#969;.

Methods: To estimate the overall risk of specific public health events, probability, and impact at the country-level were evaluated using available information. To determine the probability of particular public health events, the risk of importation and risk of transmission were taken into consideration. KCDC used 5 levels (“very low,” “low,” “moderate,” “high,” and “very high”) for each category and overall risk was eventually decided. Results: A total of 8 risk assessments were performed on 8 separate occasions between January 8thto February 28th, 2020, depending on the detection and report of COVID-19 cases in other countries. The overall risk of the situation in each assessment increased in severity over this period: “low” (first), “moderate” (second), “high” (third), “high” (fourth), “high” (fifth), “high” (sixth), “high” (seventh), and “very high” (eighth). Conclusion: The KCDC's 8 risk assessments were utilized to activate national emergency response mechanisms and eventually prepare for the pandemic to ensure the containment and mitigation of COVID-19 with non-pharmaceutical public health measures.","Kim, Inho; Lee, Jia; Lee, Jihee; Shin, Eensuk; Chu, Chaeshin; Lee, Seon Kui",Osong Public Health Res.

Trying to disassemble the trimeric structure of COVID-19 spike glycoprotein, we analyzed single protomer surfaces searching for concave moieties that are located at the three protomer-protomer interfaces. The presence of some druggable pockets at these interfaces suggested that some of the available drugs in Drug Bank could destabilize the quaternary spike glycoprotein formation by binding to these pockets, therefore interfering with COVID-19 life cycle. The approach we propose here can be an additional strategy to fight against the deadly virus.

Multidrug-resistant Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus represents a major problem in Egyptian hospitals. The over-expression of efflux pumps is a main cause of multidrug resistance. The discovery of efflux pump inhibitors may help fight multidrug resistance by sensitizing bacteria to antibiotics. This study aimed to investigate the role of efflux pumps in multidrug resistance. Methods: Twenty multidrug resistant S. aureus isolates were selected. Efflux pumps were screened by ethidium bromide agar cartwheel method and polymerase chain reaction. The efflux pump inhibition by seven agents was tested by ethidium bromide agar cartwheel method and the effect on sensitivity to selected antimicrobials was investigated by broth microdilution method. Results: Seventy percent of isolates showed strong efflux activity, while 30% showed intermediate activity. The efflux genes mdeA, norB, norC, norA and sepA were found to play the major role in efflux, while genes mepA, smr and qacA/B had a minor role. Verapamil and metformin showed significant efflux inhibition and increased the sensitivity to tested antimicrobials, while vildagliptin, atorvastatin, domperidone, mebeverine and nifuroxazide showed no effect. Conclusion: Efflux pumps are involved in multidrug resistance in Staphylococcus aureus. Efflux pump inhibitors could increase the sensitivity to antimicrobials.","Baiomy, Amr A; Shaker, Ghada H; Abbas, Hisham A",Afr Health Sci,,236

Cellulose also offers key functionalities that can be valued in filtration applications using approaches such as nanofiltration, membrane technologies, and composite structures, either through the use of nanocellulose or the design of functional composite filters. This paper presents a review of the structures and compositions of N95 respirators and medical face masks, their properties, and regulatory standards. It also reviews the use of cellulose and nanocellulose materials for mask manufacturing, along with other (nano)materials and composites that can add antimicrobial functionality to the material. A discussion of the most recent technologies providing antimicrobial properties to protective masks (by the introduction of natural bioactive compounds, metal-containing materials, metal-organic frameworks, inorganic salts, synthetic polymers, and carbon-based 2D nanomaterials) is presented. This review demonstrates that cellulose can be a solution for producing biodegradable masks from local resources in response to the high demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic and for producing antimicrobial filters to provide greater protection to the wearer and the environment, reducing cross-contamination risks during use and handling, and environmental concerns regarding disposal after use.","Garcia, R.

The aim of this study was to describe clinical, laboratory, and radiologic characteristics and determinants of mortality in a large group of MHD patients hospitalized for COVID-19. METHODS: This multicenter, retrospective, observational study collected data from 47 nephrology clinics in Turkey. Baseline clinical, laboratory and radiological characteristics, and COVID-19 treatments during hospitalization, need for intensive care and mechanical ventilation were recorded. The main study outcome was in-hospital mortality and the determinants were analyzed by Cox regression survival analysis. RESULTS: Of 567 MHD patients, 93 (16.3%) patients died, 134 (23.6%) patients admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) and 91 of the ones in ICU (67.9%) needed mechanical ventilation. Patients who died were older (median age, 66 [57-74] vs. 63 [52-71] years, p = 0.019), had more congestive heart failure (34.9% versus 20.7%, p = 0.004) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (23.6% versus 12.7%, p = 0.008) compared to the discharged patients. Most patients (89.6%) had radiological manifestations compatible with COVID-19 pulmonary involvement. Median platelet (166 × 103 per mm3 versus 192 × 103 per mm3, p = 0.011) and lymphocyte (800 per mm3 versus 1000 per mm3, p < 0.001) counts and albumin levels (median, 3.2 g/dl versus 3.5 g/dl, p = 0.001) on admission were lower in patients who died. Age (HR: 1.022 [95% CI, 1.003-1.041], p = 0.025), severe-critical disease clinical presentation at the time of diagnosis (HR: 6.223 [95% CI, 2.168-17.863], p < 0.001), presence of congestive heart failure (HR: 2.247 [95% CI, 1.228-4.111], p = 0.009), ferritin levels on admission (HR; 1.057 [95% CI, 1.006-1.111], p = 0.028), elevation of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (HR; 3.909 [95% CI, 2.143-7.132], p < 0.001) and low platelet count (< 150 × 103 per mm3) during hospitalization (HR; 1.864 [95% CI, 1.025-3.390], p = 0.041) were risk factors for mortality. CONCLUSION: Hospitalized MHD patients with COVID-19 had a high mortality rate. Older age, presence of heart failure, clinical severity of the disease at presentation, ferritin level on admission, decrease in platelet count and increase in AST level during hospitalization may be used to predict the mortality risk of these patients.","Turgutalp, Kenan; Ozturk, Savas; Arici, Mustafa; Eren, Necmi; Gorgulu, Numan; Islam, Mahmut; Uzun, Sami; Sakaci, Tamer; Aydin, Zeki; Sengul, Erkan; Demirelli, Bulent; Ayar, Yavuz; Altiparmak, Mehmet Riza; Sipahi, Savas; Mentes, Ilay Berke; Ozler, Tuba Elif; Oguz, Ebru Gok; Huddam, Bulent; Hur, Ender; Kazancioglu, Rumeyza; Gungor, Ozkan; Tokgoz, Bulent; Tonbul, Halil Zeki; Yildiz, Alaattin; Sezer, Siren; Odabas, Ali Riza; Ates, Kenan",BMC Nephrol,,236

METHODS: A retrospective observational trial was done on 186 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-infected individuals hospitalized from March 1, 2020, to April 7, 2020, with combined chest computed tomography (CT) and 25(OH)D measurement on admission. Multivariate regression analysis was performed to study if vitamin D deficiency (25(OH)D <20 ng/mL) correlates with survival independently of confounding comorbidities. RESULTS: Of the patients with COVID-19, 59% were vitamin D deficient on admission: 47% of females and 67% of males. In particular, male patients with COVID-19 showed progressively lower 25(OH)D with advancing radiologic stage, with deficiency rates increasing from 55% in stage 1 to 74% in stage 3. Vitamin D deficiency on admission was not confounded by age, ethnicity, chronic lung disease, coronary artery disease/hypertension, or diabetes and was associated with mortality (odds ratio [OR], 3.87; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.30-11.55), independent of age (OR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.03-1.14), chronic lung disease (OR, 3.61; 95% CI, 1.18-11.09), and extent of lung damage expressed by chest CT severity score (OR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.01-1.25). CONCLUSIONS: Low 25(OH)D levels on admission are associated with COVID-19 disease stage and mortality.","De Smet, Dieter; De Smet, Kristof; Herroelen, Pauline; Gryspeerdt, Stefaan; Martens, Geert A",Am. j. clin. pathol,,236
514752,Post COVID 19 multisystem inflammatory syndrome in an older adult,2021,"BACKGROUND: Pregnant and lactating women were excluded from initial coronavirus disease 2019 vaccine trials; thus, data to guide vaccine decision making are lacking. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the immunogenicity and reactogenicity of coronavirus disease 2019 messenger RNA vaccination in pregnant and lactating women compared with: (1) nonpregnant controls and (2) natural coronavirus disease 2019 infection in pregnancy. STUDY DESIGN: A total of 131 reproductive-age vaccine recipients (84 pregnant, 31 lactating, and 16 nonpregnant women) were enrolled in a prospective cohort study at 2 academic medical centers. Titers of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 spike and receptor-binding domain immunoglobulin G, immunoglobulin A, and immunoglobulin M were quantified in participant sera (n=131) and breastmilk (n=31) at baseline, at the second vaccine dose, at 2 to 6 weeks after the second vaccine, and at delivery by Luminex. Umbilical cord sera (n=10) titers were assessed at delivery. Titers were compared with those of pregnant women 4 to 12 weeks from the natural infection (n=37) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. A pseudovirus neutralization assay was used to quantify neutralizing antibody titers for the subset of women who delivered during the study period. Postvaccination symptoms were assessed via questionnaire. Kruskal-Wallis tests and a mixed-effects model, with correction for multiple comparisons, were used to assess differences among groups. RESULTS: Vaccine-induced antibody titers were equivalent in pregnant and lactating compared with nonpregnant women (pregnant, median, 5.59; interquartile range, 4.68-5.89; lactating, median, 5.74; interquartile range, 5.06-6.22; nonpregnant, median, 5.62; interquartile range, 4.77-5.98, P=.24). All titers were significantly higher than those induced by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection during pregnancy (P<.0001). Vaccine-generated antibodies were present in all umbilical cord blood and breastmilk samples. Neutralizing antibody titers were lower in umbilical cord than maternal sera, although this finding did not achieve statistical significance (maternal sera, median, 104.7; interquartile range, 61.2-188.2; cord sera, median, 52.3; interquartile range, 11.7-69.6; P=.05). The second vaccine dose (boost dose) increased severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2-specific immunoglobulin G, but not immunoglobulin A, in maternal blood and breastmilk. No differences were noted in reactogenicity across the groups. CONCLUSION: Coronavirus disease 2019 messenger RNA vaccines generated robust humoral immunity in pregnant and lactating women, with immunogenicity and reactogenicity similar to that observed in nonpregnant women. Vaccine-induced immune responses were statistically significantly greater than the response to natural infection. Immune transfer to neonates occurred via placenta and breastmilk.","Gray, Kathryn J; Bordt, Evan A; Atyeo, Caroline; Deriso, Elizabeth; Akinwunmi, Babatunde; Young, Nicola; Baez, Aranxta Medina; Shook, Lydia L; Cvrk, Dana; James, Kaitlyn; De Guzman, Rose; Brigida, Sara; Diouf, Khady; Goldfarb, Ilona; Bebell, Lisa M; Yonker, Lael M; Fasano, Alessio; Rabi, S Alireza; Elovitz, Michal A; Alter, Galit; Edlow, Andrea G",Am. j. obstet. gynecol,,236

The Israeli defense force deployed further means to contain the disease, including putting units in quarantine, physical distancing and using masks, gowns and disinfectants when in contact with suspected patients. METHODS: We used reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rt-PCR) tests to screen for patients among asymptomatic soldiers within units participating in civilian aid or in close contact with known patients, using personal protective equipment. Positive results were repeated and followed with serological testing to verify the nature of results. RESULTS: Between April and May 2020, we screened a total of 1,453 soldiers in 13 different units. We found 11 false positive results, leading to unnecessary measures until resolution, and three true positive results (0.2%). All true positive results had unreported symptoms concomitant with SARS-CoV-2 disease. These results led to the resolution of this screening policy. CONCLUSION: Screening asymptomatic army personnel in this setting with rt-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 is not warranted and leads to unnecessary false positive results.

METHODS In the prospective multicentre DAWN-plasma trial, adult patients hospitalised with COVID-19 were randomised to 4 units of open-label convalescent plasma combined with standard of care (intervention group) or standard of care alone (control group). Plasma from donors with neutralising-antibody-titres (NT50) ≥1/320 was the product of choice for the study. RESULTS Between May 2nd, 2020 and January 26th, 2021, 320 patients were randomised to convalescent plasma and 163 patients to the control group according to a 2:1 allocation scheme. A median volume of 884 mL convalescent plasma (IQR 806-906 mL) was administered, and 80.68% of the units came from donors with neutralising-antibody-titres (NT50) ≥1/320. Median time from onset of symptoms to randomisation was 7 days. The proportion of patients alive and free of mechanical ventilation on Day 15 was not different between both groups (convalescent plasma: 83.74% (n=267) versus control: 84.05% (n=137) - Odds ratio 0.99 (0.59-1.66) - p-value=0.9772). The intervention did not change the natural course of antibody titres. The number of serious or severe adverse events was similar in both study arms, and transfusion-related side effects were reported in 19/320 patients in the intervention group (5.94%). CONCLUSIONS Transfusion of 4 units of convalescent plasma with high neutralising-antibody-titres early in hospitalised COVID-19 patients did not result in a significant improvement of the clinical status, or a reduced mortality.","Devos, Timothy; Van Thillo, Quentin; Compernolle, Veerle; Najdovski, Tomé; Romano, Marta; Dauby, Nicolas; Jadot, Laurent; Leys, Mathias; Maillart, Evelyne; Loof, Sarah; Seyler, Lucie; Moonen, Martial; Moutschen, Michel; Van Regenmortel, Niels; Ariën, Kevin K; Barbezange, Cyril; Betrains, Albrecht; Garigliany, Mutien; Engelen, Matthias M; Gyselinck, Iwein; Maes, Piet; Schauwvlieghe, Alexander; Liesenborghs, Laurens; Belmans, Ann; Verhamme, Peter; Meyfroidt, Geert",The European respiratory journal,https://doi.org/10.1183/13993003.01724-2021; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34446469/,236

The performance of a magnetic force-assisted electrochemical immunoassay-based test, namely the MARK-B COVID-19 Ag test (BBB, Sungnam, Republic of Korea), was evaluated using 170 nasopharyngeal swab specimens and compared to that of RT-PCR and commercial rapid Ag test (STANDARD Q COVID-19 Ag Test, SD Biosensor, Suwon-si, Republic of Korea). The overall sensitivity and specificity of the MARK-B test were 90.0% (95% CI 79.4%–96.2%) and 99.0% (95% CI 95.0%–99.9%), respectively, with a kappa coefficient of 0.908. The correlations between the electrical current values of MARK-B and the Ct values of RT-PCR were −0.898 (E gene, 95% CI −0.938 to −0.834) and −0.914 (RdRp gene, 95% CI −0.948 to −0.860), respectively. The limit of detection of the MARK-B was measured using the viral culture reference samples and found to be 1 x 10(2) pfu/mL. The magnetic force-assisted electrochemical immunoassay-based Ag test can be used to rapidly detect SARS-CoV-2 infections, and the corresponding fully automated portable device can provide easy readability and semi-quantitative results.","Jo, Sung Jin; Shin, Sang-hyun; Kim, Jungrok; Lee, Seungok; Lee, Jehoon",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34618868/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0258394,236

598184,A Rapid Fatal Evolution of Coronavirus Disease-19 in a Patient With Advanced Lung Cancer With a Long-Time Response to Nivolumab,2020-03-31,"Mannose binding lectin (MBL) is a liver derived protein which plays an important role in innate immunity. Mannose binding lectin gene 2 (MBL2) polymorphisms are reported to be associated with various diseases. In spite of being exhaustively studied molecule, no attempt has been made till date to comprehensively and systematically analyze the SNPs of MBL2 gene. The present study was carried out to identify and prioritize the SNPs of MBL2 gene for further genotyping and functional studies. To predict the possible impact of SNPs on MBL structure and function SNP data obtained from dbSNP database were analyzed using various bioinformatics tools. Out of total 661 SNPs, only 37 validated SNPs having minor allele frequency ≥0.10 were considered for the present study. These 37 SNPs includes one in 3′ near gene, nine in 3′ UTR, one non-synonymous SNP (nsSNP), thirteen intronic SNPs and thirteen in 5′ near gene. From these 37 SNPs, 11 non-coding SNPs were identified to be of functional significance and evolutionary conserved. Out of these, 4 SNPs from 3′ UTR were found to play role in miRNA binding, 7 SNPs from 5′ near and intronic region were predicted to involve in transcription factor binding and expression of MBL2 gene. One nsSNP Gly54Asp (rs1800450) was found to be deleterious and damaging by both SIFT and Polyphen-2 servers and thus affecting MBL2 protein stability and expression. Protein structural analysis with this amino acid variant was performed by using I-TASSER, RAMPAGE, Swiss-PdbViewer, Chimera and I-mutant. Information regarding solvent accessibility, molecular dynamics and energy minimization calculations showed that this variant causes clashes with neighboring amino acids residues that must interfere in the normal triple helix formation of trimeric subunit and further with the normal assembly of MBL oligomeric form, hence decrease in stability. Thus, findings of the present study indicated 12 SNPs of MBL2 gene to be functionally important. Exploration of these variants may provide novel remedial markers for various diseases.","Kalia, Namarta; Sharma, Aarti; Kaur, Manpreet; Kamboj, Sukhdev Singh; Singh, Jatinder",Springerplus,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40064-016-2543-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27390651/,236

A plausible mechanism is androgen-induced expression of TMPRSS2 and/or ACE2 in pulmonary tissues that may increase susceptibility or severity in males. This hypothesis is the subject of several clinical trials of anti-androgen therapies around the world. Here, we investigated the sex-associated TMPRSS2 and ACE2 expression in human and mouse lungs and interrogated the possibility of pharmacologic modification of their expression with anti-androgens. We found no evidence for increased TMPRSS2 expression in the lungs of males compared to females in humans or mice. Furthermore, in male mice, treatment with the androgen receptor antagonist enzalutamide did not decrease pulmonary TMPRSS2. On the other hand, ACE2 and AR expression was sexually dimorphic and higher in males than females. ACE2 was moderately suppressible with enzalutamide therapy. Our work suggests that sex differences in COVID-19 outcomes attributable to viral entry are independent of TMPRSS2. Modest changes in ACE2 could account for some of the sex discordance.","Baratchian, Mehdi; McManus, Jeffrey M.; Berk, Mike; Nakamura, Fumihiko; Mukhopadhyay, Sanjay; Xu, Weiling; Erzurum, Serpil; Drazba, Judy; Peterson, John; Klein, Eric A.; Gaston, Ben; Sharifi, Nima",bioRxiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33083800/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.21.051201,236

Next, the overexpression of truncated pRb was shown to inhibit the PRRSV replication and silencing the pRb gene could facilitate the PRRSV replication in MARC-145 cells. Finally, the pRb level was confirmed to be down-regulated in PRRSV-infected MARC-145 cells, and Nsp9 was shown to promote the pRb degradation by proteasome pathway.

Although no licensed vaccine is currently available, an engineered version of the metastable RSV fusion (F) surface glycoprotein—stabilized in the pre-fusion (pre-F) conformation by “DS-Cav1” mutations—elicits high titer RSV-neutralizing responses. Moreover, pre-F-specific antibodies, often against the neutralization-sensitive antigenic site Ø in the membrane-distal head region of trimeric F glycoprotein, comprise a substantial portion of the human response to natural RSV infection. To focus the vaccine-elicited response to antigenic site Ø, we designed a series of RSV F immunogens that comprised the membrane-distal head of the F glycoprotein in its pre-F conformation. These “head-only” immunogens formed monomers, dimers, and trimers. Antigenic analysis revealed that a majority of the 70 engineered head-only immunogens displayed reactivity to site Ø-targeting antibodies, which was similar to that of the parent RSV F DS-Cav1 trimers, often with increased thermostability. We evaluated four of these head-only immunogens in detail, probing their recognition by antibodies, their physical stability, structure, and immunogenicity. When tested in naïve mice, a head-only trimer, half the size of the parent RSV F trimer, induced RSV titers, which were statistically comparable to those induced by DS-Cav1. When used to boost DS-Cav1-primed mice, two head-only RSV F immunogens, a dimer and a trimer, boosted RSV-neutralizing titers to levels that were comparable to those boosted by DS-Cav1, although with higher site Ø-directed responses. Our results provide proof-of-concept for the ability of the smaller head-only RSV F immunogens to focus the vaccine-elicited response to antigenic site Ø. Decent primary immunogenicity, enhanced physical stability, potential ease of manufacture, and potent immunogenicity upon boosting suggest these head-only RSV F immunogens, engineered to retain the pre-fusion conformation, may have advantages as candidate RSV vaccines.","Boyington, Jeffrey C.; Joyce, M.

Versatile optimization methods found their application in scientific studies related to COVID-19 pandemic. Differential Evolution (DE) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) are two metaheuristics that for over two decades have been widely researched and used in various fields of science. In this paper a survey of DE and PSO applications for problems related with COVID-19 pandemic that were rapidly published in 2020 is presented from two different points of view: 1. practitioners seeking the appropriate method to solve particular problem, 2. experts in metaheuristics that are interested in methodological details, inter comparisons between different methods, and the ways for improvement. The effectiveness and popularity of DE and PSO is analyzed in the context of other metaheuristics used against COVID-19. It is found that in COVID-19 related studies: 1. DE and PSO are most frequently used for calibration of epidemiological models and image-based classification of patients or symptoms, but applications are versatile, even interconnecting the pandemic and humanities; 2. reporting on DE or PSO methodological details is often scarce, and the choices made are not necessarily appropriate for the particular algorithm or problem; 3. mainly the basic variants of DE and PSO that were proposed in the late XX century are applied, and research performed in recent two decades is rather ignored; 4. the number of citations and the availability of codes in various programming languages seems to be the main factors for choosing metaheuristics that are finally used.","Piotrowski, Adam P.; Piotrowska, Agnieszka E.",Artif Intell Rev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34426713/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10462-021-10052-w,236

Here we report our experience of using convalescent plasma at a tertiary care center in a mid-size, midwestern city that did not experience an overwhelming patient surge. METHODS: Hospitalized COVID-19 patients categorized as having Severe or Life-Threatening disease according to the Mayo Clinic Emergency Access Protocol were screened, consented, and treated with convalescent plasma collected from local donors recovered from COVID-19 infection. Clinical data and outcomes were collected retrospectively. RESULTS: 31 patients were treated, 16 severe patients and 15 life-threatened patients. Overall mortality was 27% (4/31) but only patients with life-threatening disease died. 94% of transfused patients with severe disease avoided escalation to ICU care and mechanical ventilation. 67% of patients with life-threatening disease were able to be extubated. Most transfused patients had a rapid decrease in their respiratory support requirements on or about day 7 following convalescent plasma transfusion. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that convalescent plasma is associated with reducing ventilatory requirements in patients with both severe and life-threatening disease, but appears to be most beneficial when administered early in the course of disease when patients meet the criteria for severe illness.","Hartman, William R.; Hess, Aaron S.; Connor, Joseph P.",Transl Med Commun,https://doi.org/10.1186/s41231-020-00068-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33072871/,236

Although SDH awareness rose with COVID, questions remain regarding best practices for SDH screening in pediatric settings. METHOD: We assessed pediatric providers' perspectives on integrating SDH screening into patient care. Semistructured interviews were conducted with providers (n = 13) from 10 clinics. Interviews were transcribed, and themes were analyzed using the constant comparative method. RESULTS: Themes highlighted providers' awareness of structural limitations to address social needs identified by screening; implementation concerns; the unique role of pediatric providers for child health and well-being; provider comfort with assessing patients' social needs; patient considerations; the importance of relational health between pediatric providers and families, and between providers and community supports for effective screening; and unintended consequences. DISCUSSION: Pediatric providers endorse the need for SDH screening, but barriers in pediatric settings may hamper the process and reduce efficacy.","Sokol, Rebeccah L; Ammer, Julia; Stein, Sara F; Trout, Phoebe; Mohammed, Layla; Miller, Alison L",J. pediatr. health care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34521572/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pedhc.2021.08.004,236

A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and gout presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure and was diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia with progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome. His hospital course was complicated by a large pericardial effusion; an emergent bedside transthoracic echocardiography was concerning for cardiac tamponade, so pericardiocentesis was performed. A workup with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging showed changes consistent with a diagnosis of CP. Viral and idiopathic aetiologies are the most common cause of CP in the developed world, with COVID-19 now a proposed predisposing viral illness. The virus induces systemic inflammation and pericardial changes that can lead to CP physiology.

618803,Acute respiratory distress syndrome in a case of diabetic ketoacidosis requiring ECMO support,2021-06-15,"AIM: To investigate the mean platelet volume (MPV) in asymptomatic children infected with COVID‐19. METHODS: The study included 55 children infected with COVID‐19 and 60 healthy children for the comparison of leukocyte and thrombocyte count, MPV and serum C‐reactive protein (CRP) levels. Demographic data and clinical findings of all the participants were recorded, including age, gender, weight, temperature, cough, shortness of breath and contact history. RESULTS: The MPV values were determined to be statistically significantly high (P < .001) and the lymphocyte values were significantly low (p:0.002) in the asymptomatic children infected with COVID‐19 compared with the healthy control children. No difference was determined between the groups in respect of CRP level, leukocyte and thrombocyte counts (P > .05). The optimal cutoff point for MPV was determined as 8.74 fl (Area under the curve—AUC:0.932) with 81.82% sensitivity and 95% specificity for the determination of children infected with COVID‐19. A cutoff value of <2.12/mm(3) for lymphocytes (AUC:0.670) was determined with 49.09% sensitivity and 86.67% specificity for the prediction of COVID‐19. Based on the ROC analysis, the sensitivity and specificity of MPV were determined to be higher than that of lymphocyte levels. CONCLUSION: The results of this study indicate that MPV levels are significantly high in asymptomatic children infected with COVID‐19 demonstrate that this is an important predictive value and has better predictive capacity than lymphocyte values. The evaluation of MPV and lymphocyte levels together could increase diagnostic success in asymptomatic COVID‐19 patients.","Gumus, Huseyin; Demir, Abit; Yükkaldıran, Ahmet",Int J Clin Pract,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33280213/; https://doi.org/10.1111/ijcp.13892,236
621118,Right Atrial Thrombus in Transient in a COVID-19 Patient: Clinical Echocardiographic Features—Case Report and Literature Review,2020-10-08,"This study aims to evaluate the antiviral role of nucleic acid-based agonists for the activation of toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathways, and its protective role in respiratory influenza A virus infections. TLR-3 is expressed on myeloid dendritic cells, respiratory epithelium, and macrophages, and appears to play a central role in mediating both the antiviral and inflammatory responses of the innate immunity in combating viral infections. Influenza viruses can effectively inhibit the host's ability to produce interferons, and thereby suppress the immune system's antiviral defence mechanisms. Poly ICLC is a synthetic double stranded RNA comprising of polyriboinosinic-poly ribocytidylic acid (Poly IC) stabilized with l-lysine (L) and carboxymethylcellulose (C). Poly ICLC and liposome-encapsulated Poly ICLC (LE Poly ICLC) are TLR-3 agonists and are potent inducer of interferons and natural killer cells. Intranasal pre-treatment of mice with Poly ICLC and LE Poly ICLC provided high level of protection against lethal challenge with a highly lethal avian H5N1 influenza (HPAI) strain (A/H5N1/chicken/Henan clade 2), and against lethal seasonal influenza A/PR/8/34 [H1N1] and A/Aichi/2 [H3N2] virus strains. The duration of protective antiviral immunity to multiple lethal doses of influenza virus A/PR/8/34 virus had been previously found to persist for up to 3 weeks in mice for LE Poly ICLC and 2 weeks for Poly ICLC. Similarly, pre-treatment of mice with CpG oligonucleotides (TLR-9 agonist) was also found to provide complete protection against influenza A/PR/8/34 infection in mice. RT-PCR analysis of lung tissues of mice treated with Poly ICLC and LE Poly ICLC revealed upregulation of TLR-3 mRNAs gene expression. Taken together, these results do support the potential role of TLR-3 and TLR-9 agonists such as Poly ICLC and LE Poly ICLC in protection against lethal seasonal and HPAI virus infection.","Wong, J.P.; Christopher, M.E.; Viswanathan, S.; Karpoff, N.; Dai, X.; Das, D.; Sun, L.Q.; Wang, M.; Salazar, A.M.",Vaccine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2009.01.048; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X09001261; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19200852/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X09001261,236

It was once a major epidemic in South America and puts millions of people in Argentina at risk. Here, we aimed to develop horse antibodies or antibody fragments against JUNV. Before preparing the horse antibodies, a strategy to efficiently generate horse antisera was established based on comparisons among immunogens and immunization methods in both mice and horses. Antisera against JUNV were finally obtained by vaccinating horses with vesicular stomatitis virus pseudotypes bearing JUNV GP. The horse antibodies IgG and F(ab’)(2) were subsequently demonstrated to effectively neutralize vesicular stomatitis virus pseudotypes bearing JUNV GP and to show some cross-neutralization against pathogenic New World arenaviruses. Further research revealed that Asp123 on GP1 is an important site for the binding of antibodies targeting mainly JUNV GP1 for neutralization. Collectively, this study presents an efficient strategy to develop horse antisera against JUNV and provides GP1-specific horse antibodies as potential therapeutics for AHF.","Pan, Xiaoyan; Wu, Yan; Wang, Wei; Zhang, Leike; Xiao, Gengfu",Antiviral Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31760108/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354219304012; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354219304012; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2019.104666,236

The chemical modifications and delivery vehicles of synthetic mRNAs are the two key factors for their in vivo therapeutic applications. Chemical modifications like nucleoside methylation endow the synthetic mRNAs with high stability and reduced stimulation of innate immunity. The development of scalable production of synthetic mRNA and efficient mRNA formulation and delivery strategies in recent years have remarkably advanced the field. It is worth noticing that we had limited knowledge on the roles of mRNA modifications in the past. However, the last decade has witnessed not only new discoveries of several naturally occurring mRNA modifications but also substantial advances in understanding their roles on regulating gene expression. It is highly necessary to reconsider the therapeutic system made by synthetic modified mRNAs and delivery vectors. In this review, we will mainly discuss the roles of various chemical modifications on synthetic mRNAs, briefly summarize the progresses of mRNA delivery strategies, and highlight some latest mRNA therapeutics applications including infectious disease vaccines, cancer immunotherapy, mRNA-based genetic reprogramming and protein replacement, mRNA-based gene editing.","Gao, Minsong; Zhang, Qingyi; Feng, Xin-Hua; Liu, Jianzhao",Acta Biomater,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actbio.2021.06.020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34133982/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1742706121003949?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1742706121003949,236

Statins, which are known to have anti-inflammatory and antithrombotic properties, have been studied in the setting of other viral infections and ARDS, but their benefit has not been assessed in COVID-19. Thus, we sought to determine whether antecedent statin use is associated with lower in-hospital mortality in patients hospitalized for COVID-19. This is a retrospective analysis of patients admitted with COVID-19 from February 1 (st) through May 12 (th) , 2020 with study period ending on June 11 (th) , 2020. Antecedent statin use was assessed using medication information available in the electronic medical record. We constructed a multivariable logistic regression model to predict the propensity of receiving statins, adjusting for baseline socio-demographic and clinical characteristics, and outpatient medications. The primary endpoint included in-hospital mortality within 30 days. A total of 2626 patients were admitted during the study period, of whom 951 (36.2%) were antecedent statin users. Among 1296 patients (648 statin users, 648 non-statin users) identified with 1:1 propensity-score matching, demographic, baseline, and outpatient medication information were well balanced. Statin use was significantly associated with lower odds of the primary endpoint in the propensity-matched cohort (OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.36 â€“ 0.64, p<0.001). We conclude that antecedent statin use in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 was associated with lower inpatient mortality. Randomized clinical trials evaluating the utility of statin therapy in patients with COVID-19 are needed.","Gupta, Aakriti; Madhavan, Mahesh V.; Poterucha, Timothy J.; DeFilippis, Ersilia M.; Hennessey, Jessica A.; Redfors, Bjorn; Eckhardt, Christina; Bikdeli, Behnood; Platt, Jonathan; Nalbandian, Ani; Elias, Pierre; Cummings, Matthew J.; Nouri, Shayan N.; Lawlor, Matthew; Ranard, Lauren S.; Li, Jianhua; Boyle, Claudia; Givens, Raymond; Brodie, Daniel; Krumholz, Harlan M.; Stone, Gregg W.; Sethi, Sanjum S.; Burkhoff, Daniel; Uriel, Nir; Schwartz, Allan; Leon, Martin B.; Kirtane, Ajay J.; Wan, Elaine Y.; Parikh, Sahil A.",Res Sq,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32818209/; https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-56210/v1,236

There is increasing evidence of the surgical and anaesthetic benefits of RA. National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines advise using either but highlight a lack of data comparing outcomes of RA and GA for these procedures. We conducted a service evaluation, prospectively analysing elective orthopaedic cases performed at the Nuffield Orthopaedic Centre, Oxford, UK from 19/11/2018 to 03/04/2019. We aimed to compare data on anaesthetic assessment, intra-operative parameters and patient satisfaction for RA and GA cases. Methods We selected elective patients, aged above 18, undergoing total hip, total knee or unilateral knee arthroplasties. Prospective quantitative and qualitative data were collected using two forms. Firstly, anaesthetists completed a case report recording demographic data, intra-operative details and reason for anaesthetic choice. Secondly a questionnaire gathered patient satisfaction data. This was analysed using descriptive statistics and presented in tables. Results Data for 132 patients were collected over the service evaluation period. After exclusion, 99 patients were included for final analysis; 59 underwent GA and 40 had RA. GA was used predominantly due to patient preference (74.6%). RA was used primarily due to anaesthetic preference (75%); most commonly due to speed of list and duration of operation. Overall patients had low pain scores (0.3/10) and high pre-operative anxiety levels (4.6/10) regardless of anaesthetic. Conclusion Our results show high patient satisfaction with GA and RA for lower limb arthroplasty; however, pre-operative anxiety was common for both. Patient preference and comfort influenced choice of anaesthesia, highlighting the importance of pre-operative counselling and education to facilitate shared decision making, leading to favourable post-operative outcomes.","Neal-Smith, Gregory; Hopley, Erin; Gourbault, Lysander; Watts, Daniel T; Abrahams, Harry; Wilson, Katy; Athanassoglou, Vassilis",Cureus,https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.17024; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34522505/,236

More than 50% of Italian cases occurred in the northern region of Lombardy, where the saturation of health services between March and April 2020 forced hospitals to allocate patients according to available resources. Eighteen severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients were admitted to our hospital needing intensive support. Given the disease fatality, we investigated the patients' characteristics to identify mortality predictors. We counted seven deaths from multiple organ failure, two from septic shock, and two from collapsed lungs. The maximum case fatality was observed in patients who contracted SARS-CoV-2 in hospitals. The fatal outcome was associated with the following baseline characteristics: polymorbidity (OR 2.519, p = 0.048), low body mass index (OR 2.288, p = 0.031), low hemoglobin (OR 3.012, p = 0.046), and antithrombin III (OR 1.172, p = 0.048), along with a worsening of PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio in the first 72 h after admission (OR 1.067, p = 0.031).

We hypothesized that radiation departments would adjust their work patterns and RT protocols in response to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An electronic survey was sent during April 2020 to an international sample of radiation oncologists. The survey explored various aspects of departmental preparedness, and changes to their institutional RT protocols. RESULTS: A total of 68 radiation oncologists from 13 countries answered the survey. Healthcare systems were at least moderately affected in 76%. Most institutes appeared well prepared for the outbreak: regarding the availability of personal protective equipment, tests, and telemedicine/videoconference facilities. Screening for SARS-CoV-2 was applied in 59% of responders. Modification of RT protocols were minor in 66%, significant in 19% and no changes made in 15%. The extent to which protocols were modified correlated with overall healthcare disruption (p = 0.028). Normal fractionation was recommended to continue in 83% and 85% of head & neck, and cervical cancers vs. 64% of lung cancers (p = 0.001). In case the pandemic worsens, there was strong agreement to prioritize RT for aggressive cancers (80%), delay RT for slow-growing tumors (78%) and change to evidance-based hypofractionations protocols (79.4%). The option of delayed/omitted adjuvant RT (not site specific) was selected in 47%. CONCLUSION: This international survey concludes that, by making significant organizational adjustments and minor protocol modifications, RT may be safely continued during this pandemic. If the crisis worsens, there was strong agreement to continue the treatment of aggressive tumors and utilize evidence-based hypofractionated protocols.","Appel, Sarit; Lawrence, Yaacov Richard; Symon, Zvi; Kaidar-Person, Orit",Rep Pract Oncol Radiother,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33948298/; https://doi.org/10.5603/rpor.a2021.0003,236

METHODS: Due to time constraints and the acute nature of the pandemic, we searched only PubMed/MEDLINE from inception until January 28, 2021. We analyzed the level of evidence and risk of bias in each category and made suggestions accordingly. RESULTS: The virus was traced from its potential origin via possible ways of transmission to the last host. Symptomatic human-to-human transmission remains the driver of the epidemic, but asymptomatic transmission can potentially contribute in a substantial manner. Feces and fomites have both been found to contain viable virus; even though transmission through these routes has not been documented, their contribution cannot be ruled out. Finally, transmission from pregnant women to their children has been found to be low (up to 3%). CONCLUSION: Even though robust outcomes cannot be easily assessed, medical personnel must maintain awareness of the main routes of transmission (via droplets and aerosols from even asymptomatic patients).

To bolster the case for such reform, Part 2 of this paper analyses 2017–2019 data trends from the OECD Global Recalls Portal for Australia compared with several comparable economies, especially in the Asia-Pacific region where Australia now has most of its trade and investment links. The analysis finds a persistently high per capita recall rate for Australia, compared with several jurisdictions including Korea, Japan, and especially the USA. However, the analysis identifies various legal and other factors across the jurisdictions that impact on interpreting such data. Part 3 therefore begins by highlighting some more specific patterns uncovered from an ongoing joint research project comparing child product safety trends particularly in Australia and the USA. It highlights various concerns regarding recalls in Australia, as well as weaknesses in Australia’s ACL regime (in addition to the lack of a GSP), in coordinating with sector-specific regulation, and in private law mechanisms that could more indirectly promote consumer product safety. Some estimated economic costs from current levels of reported injuries, as well as of many recalls, further reinforce the case for adding a GSP. Part 4 concludes that this improvement to the ACL could be combined with some of the other reform options outlined by the Australian government’s Consultation Regulatory Impact Statement, as well as the introduction of a novel “product safety substantiation order” power. The conclusions and analysis should be helpful for other jurisdictions considering product safety law reforms in an increasingly globalized and digital economy, and draw already on comparisons with regulatory regimes and issues particularly in the Asia-Pacific region.","Nottage, L.",J Consum Policy (Dordr),https://doi.org/10.1007/s10603-020-09459-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32836589/,236

These programs do not offer maternal mental health support services, despite maternal mental health playing a significant role in the nutritional status of children. Additionally, the burden of maternal Common Mental Disorders (CMDs) is poorly described among mothers of children attending these programs. This study thus determined the burden and risk factors for maternal CMDs among children attending out-patient malnutrition clinics in rural North-western Nigeria. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study among 204 mothers of children with severe acute malnutrition who attending eight out-patient malnutrition clinics in Jigawa, North-western Nigeria. We used the World Health Organization Self-Reporting Questionnaire-20 (WHO SRQ-20) screening tool, a recognised and validated proxy measure for CMDs to identify mothers with CMDs. The prevalence of maternal CMDs was determined by identifying the proportion of mothers with SRQ scores of ≥8. Risk factors for CMD were determined using multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: Maternal CMD prevalence in children attending these facilities was high at 40.7%. Non-receipt of oral polio vaccine (OPV) (AOR 6.23, 95%CI 1.85 to 20.92) increased the odds for CMD. While spousal age above 40 (AOR 0.95, 95%CI 0.90 to 0.99) and long years spent married (AOR 0.92, 95%CI 0.85 to 0.98) decreased the odds for CMD. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate maternal CMD burden is high in out-patient malnutrition clinics in North-western Nigeria. Maternal mental health services would need to be integrated into the community management of acute malnutrition programs to provide more holistic care, and possibly improve long-term outcomes after discharge from these programs.","Abdullahi, Aminu T.; Farouk, Zubaida L.; Imam, Abdulazeez",BMC Public Health,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-10227-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33478451/,236

Design: Prospective observational cohort study with in-hospital mortality as the primary outcome. Setting: Five acute care hospitals within a single academic medical system in New York City. Participants: 3,086 hospital inpatients with COVID-19 admitted on or before April 13, 2020 and followed through June 2, 2020. Follow-up till discharge or death was complete for 99.3% of the cohort. Results: The majority of the cohort was male (59.6%). Men were younger (median 64 vs. 70, p<0.001) and less likely to have comorbidities such as hypertension (32.5% vs. 39.9%, p<0.001), diabetes (22.6% vs. 26%, p=0.03), and obesity (6.9% vs. 9.8%, p=0.004) compared to women. Women had lower median values of laboratory markers associated with inflammation compared to men: white blood cells (5.95 vs. 6.8 K/uL, p<0.001), procalcitonin (0.14 vs 0.21 ng/mL, p<0.001), lactate dehydrogenase (375 vs. 428 U/L, p<0.001), C-reactive protein (87.7 vs. 123.2 mg/L, p<0.001). Unadjusted mortality was similar between men and women (28.8% vs. 28.5%, p=0.84), but more men required intensive care than women (25.2% vs. 19%, p<0.001). Male sex was an independent risk factor for mortality (OR 1.26, 95% 1.04-1.51) after adjustment for demographics, comorbidities, and baseline hypoxia. There were significant interactions between sex and coronary artery disease (p=0.038), obesity (p=0.01), baseline hypoxia (p<0.001), ferritin (p=0.002), lactate dehydrogenase (p=0.003), and procalcitonin (p=0.03). Except for procalcitonin, which had the opposite association, each of these factors was associated with disproportionately higher mortality among women. Conclusions: Male sex was an independent predictor of mortality, consistent with prior studies. Notably, there were significant sex-specific interactions which indicated a disproportionate increase in mortality among women with coronary artery disease, obesity, and hypoxia. These new findings highlight patient subgroups for further study and help explain the recognized sex differences in COVID-19 outcomes.","Jun, Tomi; Nirenberg, Sharon; Kovatch, Patricia; Huang, Kuan-lin",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.29.20164640; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.07.29.20164640v1?rss=1,236

In contrast, areas of naturally high biodiversity may serve as a source pool for new pathogens. Overall, despite many remaining questions, current evidence indicates that preserving intact ecosystems and their endemic biodiversity should generally reduce the prevalence of infectious diseases.

The new pandemic model has two parameters (i.e., transmission rate gamma and social distancing d) to be calibrated to the data from the pandemic regions in the early stage of the outbreak while the social distancing is put in place. The model is capable to make early predictions about the spreading trajectory in the communities of any size (countries, states, counties and cities) including the total infections, the date of peak daily infections and the date of the infections reaching a plateau if the testing is sufficient.

However, until now, there is no vaccine or specific drug to prevent or treat COVID-19. OBJECTIVES: To find out the effective treatment as an antiviral agent for COVID-19, to determine the correlation between sociodemography with clinical outcomes and duration of treatment, and to determine the relationship between comorbidities with clinical outcomes and duration of treatment for COVID-19 patients. METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted in this study. This study included only confirmed COVID-19 patients who were admitted to the hospital during April-May 2020. Convenience sampling was used to select 103 patients, but only 72 patients were suitable for inclusion. RESULTS: The survival analysis for COVID-19 patients using the Kaplan Meier method showed that patients receiving Oseltamivir + Hydroxychloroquine had an average survival rate of about 83% after undergoing treatment of about ten days. Gender (p = 0.450) and age (p = 0.226) did not have a significant correlation with the duration of treatment for COVID-19 patients. Gender (p = 0.174) and age (p = 0.065) also did not have a significant correlation with clinical outcome of COVID-19 patients. Comorbidities showed a significant correlation with duration of treatment (p = 0.002) and clinical outcome (p = 0.014) of COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSION: The most effective antiviral agent in this study based on treatment duration was the combination of Oseltamivir + Hydroxychloroquine. The higher the patient’s average treatment duration is, the lower the average survival rate for COVID-19 patients.","Ramatillah, Diana Laila; Isnaini, Suri",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0250147; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33861777/,236
668846,A Unique Case of Spontaneous Pneumomediastinum in a Patient With COVID-19 and Influenza Coinfection,2021-05-12,"PURPOSE: The precise diagnostic testing is of high importance in fighting the coronavirus pandemic. While nasopharyngeal (NP) swab testing is currently the gold standard, the SARS-CoV-2 virus could be also detected in some other body fluids. In this study, we aimed to compare the SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection results, obtained using saliva samples and NP swab samples, collected from infected patients and healthy volunteers. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 111 individuals were enrolled in this study: 53 healthy volunteers, participating in routine testing and 58 COVID-19 patients. Diagnosis for both groups was confirmed using a set of diagnostic CE-IVD labeled RT-qPCR kits. Most of the saliva samples were collected within 48 hours after the NP swabs were taken. RNA was purified from saliva samples and analyzed using a laboratory-developed kit (Diagnolita). Detection results for both sample types were compared and analyzed in terms of result agreement, Ct variation, and quantity of internal control, as well as population analysis. RESULTS: We found a good concordance between the NP swab and saliva samples. The positive percent agreement was 98.28% (CI 90.76–99.96%) and negative percent agreement was 98.11% (CI 89.93–99.95%). Additionally, we observed a statistically significant (p<0.05) and moderately strong (R = 0.53) correlation between Ct values in saliva and NP swab samples. The saliva collection method is more robust since the Ct variation of internal control ribonuclease P mRNA detection is lower in saliva samples. CONCLUSION: Saliva sample testing is a robust and reliable non-invasive alternative to the NP swab method for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection, as well as a promising tool for COVID-19 screening.","Palikša, Sigitas; Lopeta, Mantvydas; Belevičius, Jonas; Kurmauskaitė, Vaida; Ašmenavičiūtė, Ieva; Pereckaitė, Laura; Vitkauskienė, Astra; Baliūtytė, Ieva; Valentaitė, Monika; Mickienė, Auksė; Gagilas, Julius",Infect Drug Resist,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34349529/; https://doi.org/10.2147/idr.s314491,236

This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the influence of vitamin C supplementation on lipid profile in patients with T2DM. Studies examining the effects of vitamin C supplementation on lipid profile in patients with T2DM, published up to November 2020, were identified through PubMed, SCOPUS, and Embase databases. 15 studies, including 872 participants, were included and analyzed using a random-effects model to calculate weighted mean differences (WMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Findings from 15 studies indicated that vitamin C supplementation significantly decreased Triglyceride (TG) (WMD: -16.48mg/dl, 95% CI (-31.89, -1.08), P <0.001) and total cholesterol (TC) (WMD: -13.00mg/dl, 95% CI (-23.10, -2.91), P <0.001) in patients with T2DM. However, vitamin C supplementation failed to improve LDL and HDL. The meta-regression analysis suggested that lipid profile improvement was affected by duration of vitamin C treatment. Dose-response analysis showed that vitamin C supplementation changed LDL significantly based on vitamin C dose. According to our findings, vitamin C supplementation significantly improved lipid profile via decreases in TG and TC. However, vitamin C failed to affect LDL and HDL in diabetic populations. It appears that vitamin C supplementation is more beneficial to lipid profile in long-term vs. short term interventions.","Namkhah, Zahra; Ashtary-Larky, Damoon; Naeini, Fatemeh; Clark, Cain C T; Asbaghi, Omid",Pharmacological research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.phrs.2021.105665; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33984490/,236

Comparing computer simulations of protein variants with different biochemical properties is an increasingly powerful means to drive progress. However, success often hinges on dimensionality reduction algorithms for simplifying the complex ensemble of structures each variant adopts. Unfortunately, common algorithms rely on potentially misleading assumptions about what structural features are important, such as emphasizing larger geometric changes over smaller ones. Here we present DiffNets, self-supervised autoencoders that avoid such assumptions, and automatically identify the relevant features, by requiring that the low-dimensional representations they learn are sufficient to predict the biochemical differences between protein variants. For example, DiffNets automatically identify subtle structural signatures that predict the relative stabilities of β-lactamase variants and duty ratios of myosin isoforms. DiffNets should also be applicable to understanding other perturbations, such as ligand binding.","Ward, Michael D.; Zimmerman, Maxwell I.; Meller, Artur; Chung, Moses; Swamidass, S.

As prescribing habits and locally available medications vary considerably between countries, guides tailored to the needs of specific regions may be required. We aimed to report the results of the international Delphi validation study for the Turkish Inappropriate Medication use in the Elderly (TIME) criteria set, which aims to detect inappropriate prescribing in older adults in Eastern Europe. METHODS: The study was conducted between June 2019 and March 2020. Delphi rounds were conducted by the TIME international working group, which included 11 internationally recognized experts in geriatric pharmacotherapy as Delphi panelists. They were asked to indicate to what extent they agreed or disagreed with each TIME criterion, taking into account both the available evidence and their own experience. We used a five-point Likert scale from 1 (strongly agree) to 5 (strongly disagree) and an online software program (SurveyMonkey(®)) to grade the level of agreement. Criteria with a median value of 1 or 2 and a 75th centile value of 1 or 2 were accepted, and criteria with a median value > 2 were rejected. Those with a median value of 1 or 2 but a 75th centile value > 2 were retained, to be assessed in the following round. The initial list of Delphi criteria comprised 153 TIME items. RESULTS: After three Delphi rounds, 134 criteria were accepted and seven criteria were rejected, while 12 criteria did not achieve consensus, and so were not included in the final validated set of TIME criteria. CONCLUSION: We developed the internationally validated TIME criteria set based on a Delphi process involving international experts. The validation study suggests that the TIME criteria set can be applied in both central and Eastern European settings. Further studies are needed to assess the utility and benefit of the TIME criteria in reducing inappropriate drug use and improving clinical outcomes.

Although the phylogeny of PEDV has been investigated extensively at the molecular level, there was no time-calibrated phylogenomic study on the virus. To improve insight into this topic, we analyzed 138 published genome sequences using the Bayesian coalescent analyses as well as Bayesian inferences and maximum likelihood methods. All of the global PEDV isolates were divided into six groups, except for one unclassified isolate. Of the six groups, Groups 1–5 comprised pandemic viruses while the remaining Group 6 contained classical isolates. Interestingly, the two clades, both pandemic and classical, consisted of clade-specific amino acid sequences in five genes: ORF1a, ORF1b, S, ORF3, and N. Within the pandemic clade, Group 1 and Group 2 originated from North America, whereas Group 3–Group 5 were derived from Asia. In Group 2, there was a common origin of S INDEL isolates. Within each group, there was no apparent association between temporal or geographic origin and heterogeneity of PEDVs. Our findings also showed that the PEDV virus evolved at a rate of 3.38 × 10(−4) substitutions/site/year, and the most recent common ancestor of the virus emerged 75.9 years ago.
