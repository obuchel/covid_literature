Following the application of these wastes to land the potential exists for environmental contamination. Plants, soil and ultimately water courses which may subsequently be used as catchments for public water supplies may all be affected. Research attention is now being focused on this possibility, especially in the case of protozoan pathogens which may be the most important as they are often resistant to current methods used in public water treatment. In this review we highlight some of the many factors that are likely to influence the degree of pollution by their effect on both the vertical and horizontal transport of microorganisms through soil. Soil pH, temperature, the presence of plants, microbial surface properties, type of waste, soil type and soil water content and flow may all affect the rate and extent of vertical transport, with the latter two generally considered to be the most important. Lateral movement is a particular problem in soils with impermeable substrata or in waterlogged conditions and in these cases the major factors affecting movement include rainfall rate, topography of the land and the rate at which microorganisms partition into the runoff.","Mawdsley, Jane L.; Bardgett, Richard D.; Merry, Roger J.; Pain, Brian F.; Theodorou, Michael K.",Appl Soil Ecol,580,1

This is primarily due to a lack of data set that are suitable to train ranking algorithms. In this paper, we tackle the lack of data by leveraging pre-trained multilingual language models to transfer a retrieval system trained on English collections to non-English queries and documents. Our model is evaluated in a zero-shot setting, meaning that we use them to predict relevance scores for query-document pairs in languages never seen during training. Our results show that the proposed approach can significantly outperform unsupervised retrieval techniques for Arabic, Chinese Mandarin, and Spanish. We also show that augmenting the English training collection with some examples from the target language can sometimes improve performance.","MacAvaney, Sean; Soldaini, Luca; Goharian, Nazli",Advances in Information Retrieval,580,1

Nowadays, the information needs of the users can be directly satisfied through entity-oriented search, by taking into account the entities that better relate to the query, as opposed to relying exclusively on the best matching terms. Evolving from keyword-based to entity-oriented search poses several challenges, not only regarding the understanding of natural language queries, which are more familiar to the end-user, but also regarding the integration of unstructured documents and structured information sources such as knowledge bases. One opportunity that remains open is the research of unified frameworks for the representation and retrieval of heterogeneous information sources. The doctoral work we present here proposes graph-based models to promote the cooperation between different units of information, in order to maximize the amount of available leads that help the user satisfy an information need.","Devezas, José",Advances in Information Retrieval,580,1

Application of acaricides constitutes the major control method but is often accompanied by serious drawbacks, including environmental contamination and an increase in acaricide resistance by ticks. The recent development of anti-tick vaccines has provided positive results in the post-genomic era, owing to the rise of reverse vaccinological and bioinformatics approaches to analyze and identify candidate protective antigens for use against ticks. The ATAQ protein is considered a novel antigen for the control of the cattle tick R. microplus; it is expressed in midguts and Malpighian tubules of all ticks from the Rhipicephalus genus. However, genetic diversity studies are required. Here, the ATAQ gene was sequenced of seven R. microplus tick isolates from different regions in Mexico to understand the genetic diversity. The results showed that sequence identity among the Mexican isolates ranged between 98 and 100% and 97.8–100% at the nucleotide and protein levels, respectively. Alignments of deduced amino acid sequences from different R. microplus ATAQ isolates in Mexico revealed a high degree of conservation. However, the Mexican isolates differed from the R. microplus “Mozambique” strain, at 20 amino acid residues. Finally, the analysis of more R. microplus isolates, and possibly of other Rhipicephalus species, to determine the genetic diversity in the ATAQ locus is essential to suggest this antigen as a vaccine candidate that might control tick infestations.","Lugo-Caro del Castillo, Sarah Melissa; Hernández-Ortiz, Rubén; Gómez-Romero, Ninnet; Martínez-Velázquez, Moisés; Castro-Saines, Edgar; Lagunes-Quintanilla, Rodolfo",Parasitol Res,580,30

Thus, it is important to determine the correct placement of the tube to prevent misplacement in the airways. Accordingly, the aim of this study was to compare the epigastric auscultation and capnography in assessing the accuracy of NG tube insertion in ICU patients. METHODS: In this descriptive comparative study, 60 patients were selected trough convenience sampling. After insertion of the NG tube in a standard method, the accuracy of placement of the tube with both epigastric auscultation and capnography was investigated. The NG tube insertion accuracy was then confirmed via radiography. Data analysis was performed using statistical software SPSS version 23. RESULTS: The result showed that capnography had a sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 100, 92.5, and 95% respectively, but epigastric auscultation had 90, 80, and 83.4% respectively. The Kappa agreement coefficient between two methods was − 0.759. CONCLUSION: The results revealed that the use of the capnography is preferable over the epigastric auscultation to confirm the correct insertion of the NG tube. It is recommended that more than one method be applied to detect and confirm the correct insertion of the NG tube.","Heidarzadi, Elahe; Jalali, Rostam; Hemmatpoor, Behzad; Salari, Nader",BMC Gastroenterol,580,13

The symptoms can range from minimal discomfort to permanent involuntary muscular movements. The aims of the study were to examine the incidence of drug-induced extrapyramidal symptoms (di-EPS), associated risk factors, and clinical characteristics. METHODS: This is a retrospective, observational study of di-EPS conducted in outpatient clinics of Jordan using the longitudinal health database (Hakeem(®)) for data collection. Patients who received drugs with the risk of EPS during the period 2010-2020 were included and followed. Patients with any of the known underlying conditions that may cause EPS or were currently taking drugs that may mask the symptoms were excluded. Gender and age-matched control subjects were included in the study. The Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS(®)) version 26 was used for data analysis. RESULTS: The final dataset included 34898 exposed patients and 69796 matched controls. The incidence of di-EPS ranged from 9.8% [Amitriptyline 25mg] to 28.9% (Imipramine 25mg). Baseline factors associated with a significantly higher risk of developing di-EPS were age {HR: 1.1 [95%CI: 0.8-1.2, p=0.003], smoking {HR: 1.7 (95%CI: 1.3-2.2), p=0.02}, tremor history {HR: 7.4 (95%CI: 5.9-8.3), p=.002} and history of taking antipsychotics {HR: 3.9, (95% CI: 2.5-4.6), p=0.001}. Patients taking paroxetine {HR: 8.6 [95%CI: 7.4-9.8], p=.0002},imipramine {HR: 8.3, [7.1-10.5], p=0.01}, or fluoxetine {HR: 8.2 (95%CI: 6.8-9.3), p=.006} had a significantly higher risk of developing di-EPS compared to patients taking citalopram. Myoclonus, blepharospasm, symptoms of the basal ganglia dysfunction, and organic writers' cramp were reported among participants. CONCLUSION: Patients treated with paroxetine, imipramine, fluoxetine, or clomipramine had a higher risk of developing di-EPS than patients treated with citalopram. The difference in gender was not significantly related to di-EPS development. Whereas age, smoking, and history of taking antipsychotics were significantly associated with di-EPS development. KEY FINDINGS: • High incidence of drug-induced extrapyramidal symptoms (di-EPS) was reported • Age, smoking, tremor history, and history of taking antipsychotics were risk factors of drug-induced extrapyramidal symptoms. • Patients taking paroxetine, imipramine or fluoxetine had a significantly higher risk of developing di-EPS compared to patients taking citalopram","Abu-Naser, Dania; Gharaibeh, Sara; Al Meslamani, Ahmad Z.; Alefan, Qais; Abunaser, Renad",Clin Pract Epidemiol Ment Health,580,16

During this period, China’s fiscal policy framework has been substantially reformed. The objective of this paper is to better understand the key features of the Chinese fiscal system and their impact on China’s economic growth. The study performs empirical analysis to identify the relationship between fiscal policy variables and economic growth. Its evidence suggests that local expenditures growth has a larger impact on output growth than central expenditures growth. The results also reveal that the response of output growth to anticipated changes in taxation was impeded by liquidity constraints. During the initial stages of market-oriented reform, growth of public investment in manufacturing sector contributed the most to output growth. During more recent periods, public investment in R&D made a substantial contribution. In addition, evidence indicates that long-term debt has a significant influence on China’s fiscal system, especially on government revenues.","Kim, Jungsuk; Wang, Mengxi; Park, Donghyun; Petalcorin, Cynthia Castillejos",Rev World Econ,580,1

Uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) accounts for a significant proportion of UTI, but a large number of other species can infect the urinary tract, each of which will have unique host-pathogen interactions with the bladder environment. Given the substantial economic burden of UTI and its increasing antibiotic resistance, there is an urgent need to better understand UTI pathophysiology – especially its tendency to relapse and recur. Most models developed to date use murine infection; few human-relevant models exist. Of these, the majority of in vitro UTI models have utilized cells in static culture, but UTI needs to be studied in the context of the unique aspects of the bladder’s biophysical environment (e.g., tissue architecture, urine, fluid flow, and stretch). In this review, we summarize the complexities of recurrent UTI, critically assess current infection models and discuss potential improvements. More advanced human cell-based in vitro models have the potential to enable a better understanding of the etiology of UTI disease and to provide a complementary platform alongside animals for drug screening and the search for better treatments.","Murray, Benjamin O.; Flores, Carlos; Williams, Corin; Flusberg, Deborah A.; Marr, Elizabeth E.; Kwiatkowska, Karolina M.; Charest, Joseph L.; Isenberg, Brett C.; Rohn, Jennifer L.",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,580,20

Usually geriatric patients will have multiple co morbidities because of which poly pharmacy results. This can adversely affect medication compliance. The purpose of our study is to identify various factors responsible for low medication compliance. Elderly people are usually affected with chronic illnesses like Hypertension, Diabates Mellitus, Dyslipidemia, Coronary artery diseases, Osteoarthritis, etc., All these diseases require long-term treatment. So, medication compliance is a very important factor which increases therapeutic outcome. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study subjects were assessed by using 15 item structured questionnaires as per indigenously modified Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS). RESULTS: A total of 100 patients of geriatric age group were assessed for the level of compliance for long term medication. The compliance level was assessed by providing a 15-item structured questionnaire as per indigenously modified MMAS. The level of compliance was high in 82%, medium in 16% and low in 2% in the first visit. The level of compliance was again assessed during next review visit. The level of score during review visit was high in 74%, medium in 25% and low in 1%. CONCLUSION: The compliance to medication is adversely affected by complicated regimes, ignorance about the disease and complications, physical and economic problems. Geriatric patients especially have a tendency to stop taking drugs off their own when they consider their symptoms have been ameliorated.

METHODS We used the TriNetX platform to analyze 20 health care institutions that have relevant, up-to-date encounter data. Using this COVID and Cancer Research Network (CCRN), we compared cancer cohorts identified by querying encounter data pre-COVID (January 2019-April 2019) and current (January 2020-April 2020). Cohorts were generated for all patients with neoplasms (malignant, benign, in situ, and of unspecified behavior), with new incidence neoplasms (first encounter), with exclusively malignant neoplasms, and with new incidence malignant neoplasms. Data from a UK institution were similarly analyzed. Additional analyses were performed on patients with selected cancers, as well as on those having had cancer screening. RESULTS Clear trends were identified that suggest a significant decline in all current cohorts explored, with April 2020 displaying the largest decrease in the number of patients with cancer having encounters. Of the cancer types analyzed, lung, colorectal, and hematologic cancer cohorts exhibited smaller decreases in size in April 2020 versus 2019 (-39.1%, -39.9%, -39.1%, respectively) compared with cohort size decreases for breast cancer, prostate cancer, and melanoma (-47.7%, -49.1%, -51.8%, respectively). In addition, cancer screenings declined drastically, with breast cancer screenings dropping by -89.2% and colorectal cancer screenings by -84.5%. CONCLUSION Trends seen in the CCRN clearly suggest a significant decrease in all cancer-related patient encounters as a result of the pandemic. The steep decreases in cancer screening and patients with a new incidence of cancer suggest the possibility of a future increase in patients with later-stage cancer being seen initially as well as an increased demand for cancer screening procedures as delayed tests are rescheduled.","London, Jack W; Fazio-Eynullayeva, Elnara; Palchuk, Matvey B; Sankey, Peter; McNair, Christopher",JCO clinical cancer informatics,580,1

RECENT FINDINGS In asthma, COPD, and PPF, increased MMP-12 levels have been associated with inflammation and/or structural changes within the lungs and negatively correlated with functional parameters. Increased pulmonary MMP-12 levels and MMP-12 gene expression have been related to disease severity in asthma and COPD. Targeting MMP-12 showed potential in animal models of pulmonary diseases but human data are still very scarce.

The natural history of flow-diversion treatment failure resulting in aneurysm remnants is not well-defined. We aimed to delineate the clinical and angiographic features of this entity. MATERIALS AND METHODS Review of a prospectively maintained Pipeline Embolization Device data base from inception to October 2017 was performed for aneurysms that demonstrated residual filling on follow-up imaging. Procedural and follow-up clinical details were recorded. Independent, blinded, angiographic assessment of occlusion was performed on the basis of the O'Kelly-Marotta scale. Aggregated outcomes were analyzed using the Fisher exact and Mann-Whitney U tests for categoric and continuous variables, respectively (statistical significance, α = .05). RESULTS During the study period, 283 sequential patients were treated; 87% (246/283) were women. The median patient age was 55 years (interquartile range, 47-65 years). Six-month follow-up imaging was available in 83.7% (237/283) of patients, which showed 62.4% (148/237) complete occlusion (class D, O'Kelly-Marotta grading scale). Adjunctive coiling (P = .06), on-label Pipeline Embolization Device use (P = .04), and multiple device constructs (P = .02) had higher rates of complete occlusion at 6 months. Aneurysm remnants were identified in 25 cases on long-term follow-up imaging (median, 16 months; interquartile range, 12-24 months). No patient with an aneurysm remnant after flow diversion presented with delayed rupture or other clinical sequelae, with a median clinical follow-up of 31 months (interquartile range, 23-33 months). CONCLUSIONS Aneurysm remnants after flow diversion are infrequent with minimal clinical impact. When appropriate, the presence of overlapping devices and possibly adjunctive coiling may result in higher rates of complete occlusion.","Madaelil, T P; Grossberg, J A; Howard, B M; Cawley, C M; Dion, J; Nogueira, R G; Haussen, D C; Tong, F C",AJNR.

While laboratory measurements of activated partial thromboplasin time (aPTT) and Anti-Xa activity (AXA) accurately describe heparin effect, their availability is limited. HYPOTHESIS Sonoclot analysis would be as sensitive as AXA and aPTT to monitor effects of unfractionated heparin (UFH) in healthy adult dogs. ANIMALS Six adult mixed-breed dogs. METHODS A prospective study design was employed. On day 1, baseline samples were collected (CBC, PT, aPTT, and Sonoclot), and UFH (300 U/kg SC) was administered to 6 dogs following an IV loading dose of 50 U/kg. Sonoclot and aPTT were performed hourly for 12 hours. AXA was assayed at hours 3, 6, 9, and 12. UFH (300 U/kg q8 h SC) was administered at 12 hours, and subsequently (q8 h) for 2 additional days. On day 4, a final dose of UFH was administered, and a sampling protocol identical to day 1 was performed. RESULTS Sonoclot activated clotting time (ACT) and clot rate (CR) correlated with AXA (R = 0.69, R = 0.65, respectively, P < .001), although to a lesser degree than aPTT (R = 0.75, P < .001). Linear regression using ACT and CR as covariates indicated a stronger correlation with AXA (R = 0.73, P < .001). ACT values strongly correlated with aPTT (R = 0.87, P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE Administration of UFH to healthy dogs results in progressive changes in Sonoclot values. AXA was correlated with a combination of ACT and CR and with aPTT. Sonoclot may play a role in monitoring UFH therapy; however, prospective studies evaluating its utility in clinical cases are warranted.","Babski, D M; Brainard, B M; Ralph, A G; Pittman, J R; Koenig, A",Journal of veterinary internal medicine,580,24

N/OFQ and its receptor, NOP, are enriched in dopaminergic pathways, and intra-ventricular agonist delivery decreases dopamine levels in the dorsal striatum, nucleus accumbens (NAc), and ventral tegmental area (VTA). We used whole cell electrophysiology in acute rat midbrain slices to investigate synaptic actions of N/OFQ. N/OFQ was primarily inhibitory, causing outward currents in both immunocytochemically identified dopaminergic (tyrosine hydroxylase positive (TH(+)) and non-dopaminergic (TH(−)) VTA neurons (effect at 1 μM: 20 ± 4 pA). Surprisingly, this effect was mediated by augmentation of postsynaptic GABAAR currents, unlike the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc), where the N/OFQ induced outward currents were K+ channel dependent. A smaller population, 19% of all VTA neurons, responded to low concentrations N/OFQ with inward currents (10 nM: −11 ± 2 pA). Following 100 nM N/OFQ, the response to a second N/OFQ application was markedly diminished in VTA neurons (14 ± 10% of first response), but not in SNc neurons (90 ± 20% of first response). N/OFQ generated outward currents in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)-projecting VTA neurons, but inward currents in a subset of posterior anterior cingulate cortex-projecting VTA neurons. While N/OFQ inhibited NAc-projecting VTA cell bodies, it had little effect on electrically or optogenetically evoked terminal dopamine release in the NAc measured ex vivo with fast scan cyclic voltammetry. These results extend our understanding of the N/OFQ system in brainstem circuits implicated in many neurobehavioral disorders. Significance statement The neuropeptide nociceptin/orphanin FQ (N/OFQ) and its receptor (NOP) are engaged under conditions of stress and are associated with reward processing disorders. Both peptide and receptor are highly enriched in ventral tegmental area (VTA) pathways underlying motivation and reward. Using whole cell electrophysiology in rat midbrain slices we found: 1) NOPs are functional on both dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic VTA neurons; 2) N/OFQ differentially regulates VTA neurons based on neuroanatomical projection target; and 3) repeated application of N/OFQ produces evidence of receptor desensitization in the VTA but not the SNc. These results reveal candidate mechanisms by which the NOP system regulates motivation and emotion.","Driscoll, Joseph R.; Wallace, Tanya L.; Mansourian, Kasra A.; Martin, William J.; Margolis, Elyssa B.",bioRxiv,580,33

Methods: We carried out a case-control study on 57 SSc patients, according to the ACR/EULAR 2013 criteria, and on 57 healthy subjects as control group (HC), matched by sex and age. At T0 (March-April) and T1 (June-July) both populations received the “Impact of Event Scale Revised” questionnaire (IES-R) by e-mail, with a cut-off of ≥ 33 defining probable diagnosis of PTSD5. A multivariate analysis of possible factors influencing IES-R score, such as age, number of cohabitating people and weekly outings count, was performed in SSc patients at both times of the survey. Results: At T0 we found a significantly greater number of SSc patients with IES-R score ≥ 33 compared to HC (26/45.6% vs 13/22.8%;median value [quartiles] 31 [19.5;42.5] vs 24 [15.5;32];p-value 0.046). At T1, we obtained data from 44 SSc patients and 35 HC but no significant difference was noticed (18 / 40.9% vs 8 / 23.5%;26 [15.25;38] vs 26.5 [20.75;32.5];p≥ 0.05). SSc patients also had significantly fewer weekly outings than HC, both at T0 (p <0.001) and T1 (p <0.001) (Table 1). The multivariate analysis performed at T0 on SSc patients showed a significant association of IES-R ≥33 score with age (p 0.025) and with a lower count of weekly outings (p 0.002). The latter data negatively correlated with an IES-R ≥33 score in SSc patients (r -0.267, p 0.004). Conclusion: We found a significantly higher prevalence of PTSD in SSc patients compared to HC at the strictest lockdown time, turning into comparable when government measures were less restrictive, due to the minimum RT index values recorded in Italy. Older age and lower count of weekly outings were associated with PTSD in SSc patients during the lockdown, whereas the count of weekly outings was lower than in HC during both the examined periods. The results of this study indicate that COVID-19 lockdown had a worse impact in SSc patients, where the fewer weekly outings may depend on their clinical condition and on a greater concern about their health6. These findings strengthen the World Scleroderma Foundation recommendations regarding care to the psychological frailty of SSc patients7.","Reza Beigi, D.

Children are predominantly affected. A plethora of viral and bacterial pathogens and a number of vaccinations have been associated with ADEM. Experimental animal studies indicate that both primary and secondary autoimmune responses contribute to central nervous system inflammation and subsequent demyelination. The clinical diagnosis of ADEM is strongly suggested by a close temporal relationship between an infectious incident or an immunization and the onset of leukoencephalopathic neurological symptoms. Paraclinical tests may support the diagnosis. Particularly helpful are acute signs of newly developed extensive, multifocal, subcortical white matter abnormalities on magnetic resonance images of the brain. The cerebrospinal fluid may disclose a mild lymphocytic pleocytosis and elevated albumin levels. Oligoclonal bands are not always present in ADEM and, if so, may be transient. The major differential diagnosis of ADEM is multiple sclerosis. Treatment options for ADEM consist of anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive agents. In general, the disease is self-limiting and the prognostic outcome favorable. In the absence of widely accepted clinical or paraclinical diagnostic guidelines, a number of recently conducted observational case series have substantially broadened our understanding about the clinical phenotype, diagnosis, and prognosis of ADEM.","Menge, Til; Hemmer, Bernhard; Nessler, Stefan; Wiendl, Heinz; Neuhaus, Oliver; Hartung, Hans-Peter; Kieseier, Bernd C; Stüve, Olaf",Archives of neurology,580,28

Radiofrequency treatment is a new method to reduce KOA-related pain and partially improve knee joint dysfunction without adverse effect. OBJECTIVE The present study aimed to assess the treatment efficacy of radiofrequency thermocoagulation on the genicular nerve (RFTGN) and intraarticular pulsed radiofrequency (IAPRF) for KOA. STUDY DESIGN Retrospective comparative study design. SETTING This study took place at Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University. METHOD KOA patients were randomly assigned to the RFTGN, IAPRF, and intraarticular steroid injection (IAS) groups. All procedures were performed under the guidance of computed tomography (CT). The observation indicators of this study were the numeric rating scale (NRS), Oxford knee scale (OKS), and perceived global effect (GPE). The time points for the assessment were 1-week, 1-month, 3-months, and 6-months after the treatment. RESULTS The postoperative NRS scores in the 3 groups decreased significantly at all the observation time points as compared to the pretreatment scores (P < 0.05). For the patients in the IAS group, the analgesic effect was in a rebound trend, which was the best at 1-week posttreatment, and was close to the preoperative level at 6-months posttreatment. The short-term (1 week or 1 month) analgesic effect of the RFTGN group was better than that of the IAPRF group, and was similar in the long-term (3 or 6 months). The long-term analgesic effect of RFTGN and IAPRF groups was better than that of IAS group. The results of the OKS score were similar to the NRS score. The RFTGN group showed markedly improved knee function in the long-term than the IAPRF and IAS groups. The short-term treatment satisfaction was similar in each group, and some differences were detected between the groups with respect to long-term treatment satisfaction. LIMITATION This study was a single-center retrospective study with a relatively small sample cohort and short follow-up periodCONCLUSION: Both RFTGN and IAPRF could alleviate the knee joint pain and improve the knee joint dysfunction; however, the treatment efficacy of RFTGN was better than that of IAPRF.","Yao, Peng; Hong, Tao; Li, Guangxiao; Han, Zhenkai; Wang, Shimeng; Ding, Yuanyuan",Pain physician,580,31

BACKGROUND DGHAL is a treatment option for symptomatic HD; existing studies report limited risk and satisfactory outcomes. DGHAL has never before been compared with SH in a large-scale multi-institutional randomized clinical trial. METHODS Three hundred ninety-three grade II/III HD patients recruited in 22 centers from 2010 to 2013 were randomized to DGHAL (n = 197) or SH (n = 196). The primary endpoint was operative-related morbidity at 3 months (D.90) based on the Clavien-Dindo surgical complications grading. Total cost, cost-effectiveness, and clinical outcome were assessed at 1 year. RESULTS At D.90, operative-related adverse events occurred after DGHAL and SH, respectively, in 47 (24%) and 50 (26%) patients (P = 0.70). DGHAL resulted in longer mean operating time (44±16 vs 30±14 min; P < 0.001), less pain (postoperative and at 2 wks visual analogic scale: 2.2 vs 2.8; 1.3 vs 1.9; P = 0.03; P = 0.013) and shorter sick leave (12.3 vs 14.8 d; P = 0.045). At 1 year, DGHAL led to more residual grade III HD (15% vs 5%) and a higher reoperation rate (8% vs 4%). Patient satisfaction was >90% for both procedures. Total cost at 1 year was greater for DGHAL [&OV0556;2806 (&OV0556;2670; 2967) vs &OV0556;2538 (&OV0556;2386; 2737)]. The D.90, incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was &OV0556;7192 per averted complication. At 1 year DGHAL strategy was dominated. CONCLUSIONS DGHAL and SH are viable options in grade II/III HD with no significant difference in operative-related risk. Although resulting in less postoperative pain and shorter sick leave, DGHAL was more expensive, took longer, and provided a possible inferior anatomical correction suggesting an increased risk of recurrence.","Lehur, Paul A; Didnée, Anne S; Faucheron, Jean-Luc; Meurette, Guillaume; Zerbib, Philippe; Siproudhis, Laurent; Vinson-Bonnet, Béatrice; Dubois, Anne; Casa, Christine; Hardouin, Jean-Benoit; Durand-Zaleski, Isabelle",Annals of surgery,580,7

METHODS This 24-week, multicentre, double-blind, randomized, active-controlled study compared vildagliptin (100 mg daily, given as equally divided doses, n = 295) and pioglitazone (30 mg daily, given as a single q.d. dose, n = 281) in patients with inadequate glycaemic control (A1C 7.5-11%) while receiving a stable metformin dose (> or =1500 mg daily). The adjusted mean changes from baseline to study endpoint (AMDelta) in A1C, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), fasting lipids and body weight were compared by analysis of covariance. RESULTS When added to a stable dose of metformin (mean dose at baseline >2000 mg/day), both vildagliptin and pioglitazone decreased A1C (AMDelta = -0.9 +/- 0.1% and -1.0 +/- 0.1%, respectively) from identical baseline values (8.4 +/- 0.1%). The between-group difference in AMDelta A1C was 0.1 +/- 0.1%, and non-inferiority of vildagliptin to pioglitazone was established at both 0.4 and 0.3% margins for upper limit of the 95% confidence intervals. Pioglitazone decreased FPG (AMDelta = -2.1 +/- 0.1 mmol/l) to a greater extent than vildagliptin (AMDelta = -1.4 +/- 0.1 mmol/l), but only pioglitazone increased body weight (AMDelta = +1.9 +/- 0.2 kg: between-group difference = -1.6 +/- 0.3 kg, p < 0.001). Adverse events (AEs) were reported by 60% of vildagliptin-treated patients and by 56.4% of pioglitazone-treated patients; serious AEs were reported by 2.0 and 4.6% of patients receiving vildagliptin and pioglitazone respectively. Mild hypoglycaemia was reported by one patient (0.3%) in the vildagliptin group and by no patients receiving pioglitazone. CONCLUSIONS When added to metformin, the efficacy of vildagliptin is non-inferior to that of pioglitazone.

Efficacy trials based on the Bispectral Index® (BIS) monitor (Covidien, Boulder, CO) and anesthetic concentrations have focused on high-risk patients, but there are no effectiveness data applicable to an unselected surgical population. METHODS We conducted a randomized controlled trial of unselected surgical patients at three hospitals of a tertiary academic medical center. Surgical cases were randomized to alerting algorithms based on either BIS values or anesthetic concentrations. The primary outcome was the incidence of definite intraoperative awareness; prespecified secondary outcomes included postanesthetic recovery variables. RESULTS The study was terminated because of futility. At interim analysis the incidence of definite awareness was 0.12% (11/9,376) (95% CI: 0.07-0.21%) in the anesthetic concentration group and 0.08% (8/9,460) (95% CI: 0.04-0.16%) in the BIS group (P = 0.48). There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of meeting criteria for recovery room discharge or incidence of nausea and vomiting. By post hoc secondary analysis, the BIS protocol was associated with a 4.7-fold reduction in definite or possible awareness events compared with a cohort receiving no intervention (P = 0.001; 95% CI: 1.7-13.1). CONCLUSION This negative trial could not detect a difference in the incidence of definite awareness or recovery variables between monitoring protocols based on either BIS values or anesthetic concentration. By post hoc analysis, a protocol based on BIS monitoring reduced the incidence of definite or possible intraoperative awareness compared with routine care.","Mashour, George A; Shanks, Amy; Tremper, Kevin K; Kheterpal, Sachin; Turner, Christopher R; Ramachandran, Satya Krishna; Picton, Paul; Schueller, Christa; Morris, Michelle; Vandervest, John C; Lin, Nan; Avidan, Michael S",Anesthesiology,580,13

Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) polymorphism is one of the genetic factors that might have an impact on the outcome of the disease. This study explored the association between the HLA genotype and the severity of COVID-19 among patients from South Asia. Blood samples from 95 Asians (Bangladeshis, Indians, and Pakistanis) with COVID-19 were collected. The patients were divided according to the severity of their infection: mild (N = 64), severe (N = 31), and fatal (N = 20). DNA was extracted from all samples, and HLA genotyping was performed for both class I (A, B, and C) and class II (DRB1, DQA1, and DQB1) using the PCR-rSSO (polymerase chain reaction-reverse sequence-specific oligonucleotide) molecular method. The frequency of HLA-B*51 was significantly higher among patients in the fatal group than among those in the mild infection group (15% vs. 4.7%, p = 0.027). Additionally, the frequency of HLA-B*35 was significantly higher in the mild infection group than in the fatal group (21.1% vs. 7.5%, p = 0.050 [a borderline p-value]). In terms of HLA class II, DRB1*13 was significantly observed in the fatal group than in the mild infection group (17.5% vs. 11.3%, p = 0.049). However, the p-value for all alleles became insignificant after a statistical correction for the p-values (pc = 0.216, pc = 0.4, and pc = 0.49, respectively). Compared with all published data, this study highlights that the association between the HLA system and the COVID-19 outcome might be ethnic-dependent.

Mindfulness training, which helps individuals attend to the present moment with a nonjudgmental attitude, improves sleep and reduces stress during regular times. Mindfulness training may also be relevant to the mitigation of harmful health consequences during acute crises. However, certain restrictions may necessitate the web-based delivery of mindfulness training (ie, rather than in-person group training settings). OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to examine the effects of mindfulness interventions during the COVID-19 pandemic and to evaluate the effectiveness of web-based interventions. METHODS: Data from an ongoing study were used for this retrospective equivalence analysis. Recruited participants were enrollees from mindfulness courses at a local charity organization that promoted mental wellness. This study had no exclusion criteria. We created three groups; two groups received their training during the COVID-19 pandemic (in-person training group: n=36; videoconferencing group: n=38), and a second control group included participants who were trained before the pandemic (n=86). Our primary outcomes were self-reported stress and sleep quality. Baseline levels and changes in these variables due to mindfulness training were compared among the groups via an analysis of covariance test and two one-tailed t tests. RESULTS: Baseline perceived stress (P=.50) and sleep quality (P=.22) did not differ significantly among the three groups. Mindfulness training significantly reduced stress in all three groups (P<.001), and this effect was statistically significant when comparing videoconferencing to in-person training (P=.002). Sleep quality improved significantly in the prepandemic training group (P<.001). However, sleep quality did not improve in the groups that received training during the pandemic. Participants reported that they required shorter times to initiate sleep following prepandemic mindfulness training (P<.001), but this was not true for those who received training during the pandemic. Course attendance was high and equivalent across the videoconferencing and comparison groups (P=.02), and participants in the videoconferencing group engaged in marginally more daily practice than the in-person training group. CONCLUSIONS: Web-based mindfulness training via videoconferencing may be a useful intervention for reducing stress during times when traditional, in-person training is not feasible. However, it may not be useful for improving sleep quality.","Lim, Julian; Leow, Zaven; Ong, Jason; Pang, Ly-Shan; Lim, Eric",JMIR Ment Health,580,1

Molecular modeling suggest that the mAbs bind to epitopes present on the exterior surface of the nucleocapsid, making them suitable for detecting SARS-CoV-2 in clinical samples. We further select the optimal pair of anti-SARS-CoV-2 NP mAbs using ELISA, and then use this mAb pair to develop immunochromatographic assay augmented with silver amplification technology.

We aimed to assess the relationship between severity of inflammatory response/coagulation abnormalities and hsTnT in Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). We then explored the relevance of these pathways in defining mortality and complications risk and the potential effects of the treatments to attenuate such risk. In this single-center, prospective, observational study we enrolled 266 consecutive patients hospitalized for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Primary endpoint was in-hospital COVID-19 mortality. hsTnT, even after adjustment for confounders, was associated with mortality. D-dimer and CRP presented stronger associations with hsTnT than PaO2. Changes of hsTnT, D-dimer and CRP were related; but only D-dimer was associated with mortality. Moreover, low molecular weight heparin showed attenuation of the mortality in the whole population, particularly in subjects with higher hsTnT. D-dimer possessed a strong relationship with hsTnT and mortality. Anticoagulation treatment showed greater benefits with regard to mortality. These findings suggest a major role of SARS-CoV-2 coagulopathy in hsTnT elevation and its related mortality in COVID-19.

However, measurements of N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) in the peripheral blood may not adequately reflect early-stage decompensated heart failure (HF). Given that right heart catheterization (RHC) can facilitate measurements of intracardiac NT-proBNP, in this study our aim was to evaluate the predictive role of right ventricular (RV) NT-proBNP measurements in patients with PAH. METHODS AND RESULTS: We prospectively collected intracardiac blood samples for NT-proBNP measurements from patients diagnosed with World Health Organization Group I PAH during RHC. Clinical information including the aetiology of PAH (idiopathic, connective tissue disease, or congenital heart disease) and REVEAL scores were recorded. The primary endpoint was hospitalization for decompensated HF; median duration of follow-up was 28 months. Among the 62 patients evaluated, 12 reached the designated endpoint. REVEAL risk scores were higher among patients hospitalized for HF. We detected no significant differences in plasma NT-proBNP levels in peripheral circulation, in the right atrium, or in pulmonary arterial blood; however, significantly higher levels of NT-proBNP were detected in the RV in patients diagnosed with PAH. RV NT-proBNP was a sensitive predictor (cut-off value 1500 pg/mL) of subsequent hospitalization for HF. Our findings indicate that RV NT-proBNP levels add predictive value to REVEAL scores with respect to future hospitalization due to HF. CONCLUSIONS: Right ventricular NT-proBNP levels combined with REVEAL 2.0 could predict the development of subsequent HF in patients with PAH and may be a potential biomarker.","Chang, Wei-Ting; Shih, Jhih-Yuan; Hong, Chon-Seng; Lin, Yu-Wen; Chen, Yi-Chen; Ho, Chung-Han; Chen, Zhih-Cherng; Roan, Jun-Neng; Hsu, Chih-Hsin",ESC Heart Fail,580,24

Seropositivity was 13.3% (95% CI=13.1-13.6%) and was independently associated with sex, age, nationality, clinical-care encounter type, and testing date. Median optical density (antibody titer) among antibody-positive persons was 27.0 (range=1.0-150.0), with higher values associated with age, nationality, clinical-care encounter type, and testing date. Seropositivity by nationality was positively-correlated with the likelihood of having higher antibody titers (Pearson correlation coefficient=0.85; 95% CI=0.47-0.96). Less than two in every 10 individuals in Qatar's urban population had detectable antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, suggesting this population is still far from herd immunity and at risk of subsequent infection waves.

EL is an unusual neurological illness that causes profound sleep disorders, devastating neurological sequalae and, in many cases, death. Though uncommon, EL is still occasionally diagnosed today when a patient presents with an acute or subacute encephalitic illness, where all other known causes of encephalitis have been excluded and criteria for EL are met. However, it is impossible to know whether recent cases of EL-like syndromes result from the same disease that caused the epidemic. After more than 100 years of research into potential pathogen triggers and the role of autoimmune processes, the aetiology of EL remains unknown. The epidemic approximately coincided with the 1918 H1N1 influenza pandemic but the evidence of a causal link is inconclusive. This article reviews the literature on the causes of EL with a focus on autoimmune mechanisms. In light of the current pandemic, we also consider the parallels between the EL epidemic and neurological manifestations of COVID-19. Understanding how pathogens and autoimmune processes can affect the brain may well help us understand the conundrum of EL and, more importantly, will guide the treatment of patients with suspected COVID-19-related neurological disease, as well as prepare us for any future epidemic of a neurological illness.","Bond, Molly; Bechter, Karl; Müller, Norbert; Tebartz van Elst, Ludger; Meier, Ute-Christiane",Prog Neuropsychopharmacol Biol Psychiatry,580,2

Its impact and frightening mortality rate are in large part attributable to the fact that there is a lack of available treatments. It has been shown that in patients who are severely ill, SARS-CoV-2 can lead to an inflammatory response known as cytokine storm, which involves activation and release of inflammatory cytokines in a positive feedback loop of pathogen-triggered inflammation. Currently, cytokine storm is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in SARS-CoV-2, but there is no proven treatment to combat this systemic response. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper is to study the cytokine storm response in SARS-CoV-2 and to explore the early treatment options for patients who are critically ill with the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the early stages of the pandemic by reviewing the literature. METHODS: A literature review was performed from December 1, 2000, to April 4, 2020, to explore and compare therapies that target cytokine storm among SARS-CoV-2 and prior coronavirus cases. RESULTS: A total of 38 eligible studies including 24 systematic reviews, 5 meta-analyses, 5 experimental model studies, 7 cohort studies, and 4 case reports matched the criteria. CONCLUSIONS: The severity of the cytokine storm, measured by elevated levels of interleukin-1B, interferon-Î³, interferon-inducible protein 10, and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, was associated with COVID-19 disease severity. Many treatment options with different targets have been proposed during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, ranging from targeting the virus itself to managing the systemic inflammation caused by the virus and the excessive cytokine response. Among the different agents to manage cytokine storm in patients with COVID-19, there is developing support for convalescent plasma therapy particularly for patients who are critically ill or mechanically ventilated and resistant to antivirals and supportive care. Treatment options that were proposed in the beginning phases of the pandemic were multidimensional, and further research is needed to develop a more established treatment guideline.","Quirch, Miguel; Lee, Jeannie; Rehman, Shabnam",J Med Internet Res,580,20

Because renin-angiotensin system blockers increase levels of ACE2, a protein that facilitates coronavirus entry into cells, there is concern that these drugs could increase the risk of developing a severe and fatal form of COVID-19. The impact of discontinuing ACEI and ARBs in patients with COVID-19 remains uncertain. DESIGN: BRACE CORONA is a pragmatic, multicenter, randomized, phase IV, clinical trial that aims to enroll around 500 participants at 34 sites in Brazil. Participants will be identified from an ongoing national registry of suspected and confirmed cases of COVID-19. Eligible patients using renin-angiotensin system blockers (ACEI/ARBs) with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 will be randomized to a strategy of continued ACEI/ARB treatment versus temporary discontinuation for 30 days. The primary outcome is the median days alive and out of the hospital at 30 days. Secondary outcomes include progression of COVID-19 disease, all-cause mortality, death from cardiovascular causes, myocardial infarction, stroke, transient ischemic attack, new or worsening heart failure, myocarditis, pericarditis, arrhythmias, thromboembolic events, hypertensive crisis, respiratory failure, hemodynamic decompensation, sepsis, renal failure, and troponin, B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), N-terminal-proBNP, and D-dimer levels.

Convalescent plasma is an adjunct treatment used in emerging infectious diseases in past epidemics. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to determine the outcome and clinical course of COVID-19 patients who received convalescent plasma (CP) transfusion at Cardinal Santos Medical Center. METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort analytical study of 75 patients who received convalescent plasma. RESULTS: Median time from admission to CP transfusion was 3 days. Majority of patients received additional therapies including dexamethasone (100%), antibiotics (100%), remdesivir (95%), hemoperfusion (88%), tocilizumab (65%), or combinations of these. Among the survivors, the median length of stay (LOS) was 15 days while non-survivors had a median LOS of 6 days. One patient (1.33%) had a mild transfusion reaction. Four patients (5.33%) developed deep vein thrombosis despite anticoagulation. There was improvement in the inflammatory markers (LDH p value 0.04, CRP p value 0.00, Ferritin p value 0.0001). There was improvement in the pulmonary parameters-increase in mean PaO2, mean SaO2, and mean PFR;and decrease in mean FiO2 and mean RR post-treatment. Median LOS is 14 days for the CP group vs 11 days for the non-CP group. Mortality rate among the CP group was 25.33% while the non-CP group was 26.67%. LOS and mortality rate did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: There was no significant difference in mortality and length of hospital stay in patients given CP vs controls. CP when combined with other treatment modalities might have a role in the improvement of inflammatory markers and pulmonary status.","Mesina, F. Z.; Mangahas, C. G.; Gatchalian, E.

To enhance drug or gene delivery to the brain, investigators have proposed the use of nanoparticulate delivery vectors to improve pharmacokinetics and pharmacodistribution. Once blood-brain barrier crossing is achieved, it has been assumed that nanoparticles would have a relatively prolonged residence time in the central nervous system, long enough for the payload to reach the target cells of interest. Indeed, earlier pharmacokinetic studies with inorganic nanoparticles, such as iron oxide, supported this assumption of prolonged brain residence times of nanoparticulate agents. Recently, Gu et al. studied the residence time in the brain of organic, biodegradable nanoparticles that are more typically used for drug delivery. They found that nanoparticles composed of either lipoproteins or polymers cleared fairly rapidly from the mouse brain following direct intraparenchymal injection, with a clearance half-life of only a few hours. Moreover, they found that this clearance was mediated, for the most part, by the glymphatic system—a recently described mechanism by which the brain's interstitial fluid clears into the lymphatic system of the body via paravascular channels—with the resident immune cells of the brain playing a pivotal role. From a drug delivery perspective, this implies that bioengineers must not assume that delivery of a nanoparticle past the blood-brain barrier will be sufficient and instead consider that the glymphatic system could clear the nanoparticle nearly as fast as it is being delivered. Additionally, this implies that nanoparticles may be uniquely suited for studying how the glymphatic system clears different types of materials from the brain, as well as the role of immune cells in this process. Furthermore, given that they are selectively cleared by immune cells into the glymphatic system, this suggests that nanoparticles could be uniquely suited to treating neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative disorders. Certainly, although these data are compelling, future studies will need to verify that these results translate to larger animals that better predict the human situation. Additionally, they will need to be realized in realistic models of the diseases the nanoparticles are intended to treat. Overall, this study underlines the importance of explicitly verifying the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodistribution of drug delivery technologies.","Airan, Raag",Sci. Transl. Med.,580,26

Natural agents with immune-promoting potentials such as bee products are being explored as possible treatments. Bee honey and propolis are rich in bioactive compounds that express strong antimicrobial, bactericidal, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and antioxidant activities. This review examined the literature for the anti-COVID-19 effects of bee honey and propolis, with the aim of optimizing the use of these handy products as prophylactic or adjuvant treatments for people infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Molecular simulations show that flavonoids in propolis and honey (e.g., rutin, naringin, caffeic acid phenyl ester, luteolin, and artepillin C) may inhibit viral spike fusion in host cells, viral-host interactions that trigger the cytokine storm, and viral replication. Similar to the potent antiviral drug remdesivir, rutin, propolis ethanolic extract, and propolis liposomes inhibited non-structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, and these compounds along with naringin inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection in Vero E6 cells. Propolis extracts delivered by nanocarriers exhibit better antiviral effects against SARS-CoV-2 than ethanolic extracts. In line, hospitalized COVID-19 patients receiving green Brazilian propolis or a combination of honey and Nigella sativa exhibited earlier viral clearance, symptom recovery, discharge from the hospital as well as less mortality than counterparts receiving standard care alone.

Each additional month spent on the waiting list was independently associated with a decrease in quality of life (EQ-5D: -0.0135, p = 0.004). There were 117 (13.9%) patients who wished to defer their surgery and the main reason for this was health concerns for themselves and or their family (99.1%, n = 116/117). CONCLUSION: Over one-third of patients waiting for THA and nearly one-quarter waiting for a KA were in a state WTD, which was approaching double that observed prior to the pandemic. Increasing length of time on the waiting list was associated with decreasing quality of life.

This review outlines the current evidence about the role of mucosal immune responses in the clearance of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, as well as potential mucosal mechanisms of protection against (re-)infection. RECENT FINDINGS: The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 cellular entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2 is most highly expressed in the upper respiratory tract and most SARS-CoV-2 shedding occurs from the upper respiratory tract. Viral shedding peaks early during infection around the onset of symptoms, before dropping rapidly in most individuals within 7âdays of symptom onset, suggesting mucosal inhibition of viral infection. Serum and mucosal immunoglobulin G and immunoglobulin M responses were found to be strongly correlated in infected patients, whereas correlations were much weaker for immunoglobulin A (IgA). Mucosal IgA responses have been detected in infected cases in the absence of serum antibody responses, with mucosal antibody levels correlating strongly with virus neutralization. Bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of nasopharyngeal swabs and bronchoalveolar lavage samples of COVID-19 patients revealed the induction of mucosal chemokine and cytokine genes, complement pathways, Janus Kinase/Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription signaling and cytotoxic T cells. SUMMARY: Although most clinical studies focus on antibodies and cellular immunity in peripheral blood, mucosal immune responses in the respiratory tract play a key role in the early restriction of viral replication and the clearance of SARS-CoV-2. Identification of mucosal biomarkers associated with viral clearance will allow monitoring of infection-induced immunity. Further studies are needed to understand how the systemic immunological endpoints measured in vaccination studies translate to mucosal protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Fröberg, Janeri; Diavatopoulos, Dimitri A",Curr Opin Infect Dis,580,18

The infected patients presented with fever, respiratory symptoms, sometimes with digestive and other systemic manifestations, and some progressed with a severe acute respiratory syndrome or even death. Associated digestive symptoms were frequently observed in the patients, with an unknown significance and mechanism. ACE2, as the major known functional receptor of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) attracted our attention. We collected the clinical data of the 2019-nCoV-infected patients from published studies and extracted the data about the incidence of gastrointestinal symptoms. Furthermore, we used online datasets to analyze ACE2 expression in different human organs, especially in the small intestine, to explore the relationship between ACE2 expression patterns and clinical symptoms. We found that diarrhea accounted for a notable proportion of COVID-19 patients, ranging from 8.0% to 12.9%. The results reveal that ACE2 mRNA and protein are highly expressed in the small intestinal enterocytes but not in the goblet cells or intestinal immune cells. High expression of ACE2 on the surface cells in the digestive tract may lead to gastrointestinal symptoms and inflammation susceptibility. Overall, digestive symptoms were common in the COVID-19 patients. ACE2 expression on surface cells of the small intestine may mediate the invasion and amplification of the virus and activation of gastrointestinal inflammation. It is a possible mechanism of digestive symptoms in the COVID-19 patients and explains the presence of the virus in patients' stool samples. The study also highlights the necessity of taking stool samples for suspected patients to help in early diagnosis and assessment of disease status.","Zhang, Hui; Li, Hong-Bao; Lyu, Jian-Rui; Lei, Xiao-Ming; Li, Wei; Wu, Gang; Lyu, Jun; Dai, Zhi-Ming",Int J Infect Dis,580,29

Methods: cohort involving children under the age of 19 underwent cancer treatment during April to July 2020. During the pandemic, real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay (RT-PCR) for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS -CoV-2) in nasal / oropharyngeal swab were collected in symptomatic patients or before hospitalization. Those with detectable results were included in this cohort study. The outcomes were delayed on cancer treatment and death. Descriptive analysis was performed and presented in preliminary results. Results: 48 children participated in the cohort, mostly with hematological neoplasms (66.6%.),69% were male, median age was 5.5 years. The most frequent symptoms were fever (58.3%) and coughing (27.7%);72.9% required hospitalization, 20% had support in ICU and 10.5% on invasive ventilatory assistance.66.6% of the patients had their oncological treatment postponed, 16.6% died within 60 days after confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Conclusions: COVID-19 led a delay in the oncological treatment for children with cancer and a higher mortality frequency when compared to the historical series of the service. It would be important to analyze the risk factors to determine the survival impact.","Lima, Ana Luiza Magalhães de Andrade; Borborema, Maria do Céu Diniz; Matos, Ana Paula Rodrigues; Oliveira, Kaline Maria Maciel de; Mello, Maria Júlia Gonçalves; Lins, Mecneide Mendes",Rev.

is transmitted through the air Many clinically important airborne diseases are caused by a variety of pathogens including bacteria, viruses, and fungi These organisms may be transmitted through sneezing, coughing, spraying of liquids, spread of dust, talking, or any activity that results in the generation of aerosolized particles It is important to be aware that airborne diseases, in general, do not include disorders caused by air pollution, poisons, smog, and dust According to the World Health Organization, “Airborne transmission of infectious agents refers to the transmission of disease caused by dissemination of droplet nuclei that remain infectious when suspended in air over long distance and time ” Airborne transmission can be characterized as obligate or preferential depending on whether it is only transmitted via droplet nuclei or if it has multiple other routes of transmission The microorganisms transmitted by an airborne route may be spread via fine mist, dust, aerosols, or liquids The aerosolized particles are generated from a source of infection such as an infected patient or animal In addition, aerosols may be generated from biological waste products that accumulate in garbage cans, caves, and dry arid containers In aerosolization, the microorganisms that are less than 5 micrometers in size float in the air These microorganisms, contained in droplets, are then dispersed via air currents to varying distances and can be inhaled by susceptible hosts Although a majority of the particles will drop off within the vicinity, the infected aerosolized particles often remain suspended in air and may even travel considerable distances, As the distance between the source and susceptible individuals increases, the rate of transmission decreases Airborne transmission necessitates the use of available interventions in healthcare facilities to break the transmission of airborne particles from patient to patient and patient to healthcare workers Airborne particles are considered highly infectious as they often remain suspended in the air and travel by air currents to different parts of the hospital where there is a potential of them being inhaled by others In some cases where there is inadequate ventilation, the airborne particle may remain in the hospital room for extended periods and may even be inhaled by a newly admitted patient The control and prevention of airborne transmission of infections is not simple;it requires the control of airflow with the use of specially designed ventilation systems, the practice of antiseptic techniques, wearing personalized protective equipment (PPE), and performing basic infection prevention measures like hand washing Airborne Organisms In almost all cases, airborne pathogens cause an inflammatory reaction of the upper airways affecting the nose, sinuses, throat, and lungs The involvement of these structures may result in sinus congestion, sore throat, and lower respiratory tract symptoms Any coughing or sneezing activity may then generate aerosolized particles leading to airborne transmission Some of the common pathogens that may spread via airborne transmission are: Anthrax Aspergillosis Blastomycosis Chickenpox Adenovirus Enteroviruses Rotavirus Influenza Rhinovirus Neisseria meningitidis Streptococcus pneumoniae Legionellosis Measles Mumps Smallpox Cryptococcosis Tuberculosis Bordetella pertussis Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) This is a non-exhaustive list that only encompasses some of the common diseases that have been implicated in airborne transmission A special note to be made is regarding COVID-19, the 21st century pandemic which is thought to spread through airborne routes (among other routes) Active measures to prevent airborne transmission has shown to curb its spread Airborne diseases are not exclusive to humans and can also infect animals A notable example is of poultry that is often affected by an avian disorder (Newcastle disease), that is also transmitted via an airborne route However, it is important to understand that exposure to an animal or a patient with an airborne disease does not automatically ensure disease transmission The infection also depends on the host immunity, the amount of exposure, and the duration of exposure to the infected patient Airborne Particles Generated from Medical Equipment Besides patients, several medical and surgical procedures may also generate aerosolized infectious particles In most cases, these airborne particles are generated during the manipulation of the lung airways These include: Manual ventilation with a bag and mask Intubation Open endotracheal suctioning Bronchoscopy Cardiopulmonary resuscitation Sputum induction Chest physiotherapy Lung surgery Nebulizer therapy and steam inhalation Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (BIPAP, CPAP) An autopsy of the lungs Care must be taken while performing the above medical procedures on patients known to have diseases with high transmissibility through airborne routes","Ather, B.; Mirza, T.

As an alternative, we propose to apply direct block sequential simulation to model the spatial distribution of the COVID-19 infection risk in mainland Portugal. Given the daily number of infection data provided by the Portuguese Directorate-General for Health, the daily updates of infection rates are calculated by municipality and used as experimental data in the geostatistical simulation. The model considers the uncertainty/error associated with the size of each municipality's population. The calculation of daily updates of the infection risk maps results from the median model of one ensemble of 100 geostatistical realizations of daily updates of the infection risk. The ensemble of geostatistical realizations is also used to calculate the associated spatial uncertainty of the spatial prediction using the interquartile distance. The risk maps are updated daily and show the regions with greater risks of infection and the critical dynamics related to its development over time.","Azevedo, Leonardo; Pereira, Maria João; Ribeiro, Manuel C; Soares, Amílcar",Int J Health Geogr,580,14

The latter being isolated, and the large number of staff members that had come into contact with COVID-19 being quarantined from work, placed further strain on the healthcare services. The staff mass screening strategy was a policy decision made by the hospital in response to infection among HCWs, and it aimed to reduce in-hospital transmission (particularly among asymptomatic staff), mitigate workforce depletion due to unnecessary quarantining, and protect the healthcare workforce. In this study, we assessed the detection rate of COVID-19 infection from staff mass testing over a five-week period, and described our experience of adopting this surveillance screening strategy alongside ongoing contact tracing and symptomatic screening strategies. Although it was thought that such periodic staff surveillance might be helpful in protecting the healthcare workforce within a short period, the long-term implications, especially in settings with limited resources, is significant and therefore explored in this paper. Our findings might provide an evidence-based reference for the future planning of an optimal strategy with the least compromise in care for a larger proportion of non-COVID-19 patients amid efforts against COVID-19 in a large non-COVID-designated hospital with hybrid status.","Foo, Diana Hui Ping; King, Teck Long; Lee, Huey Chun; Santhramogan, Priyadarvena; Ganasan, Vijay; Fong, Alan Yean Yip; Ngian, Hie Ung",Hospital practice (1995),580,20

Such a crisis calls for an urgent need to develop a risk stratification tool. The present chapter aimed to identify laboratory and clinical correlates of adverse outcomes in patients with COVID-19. To this end, we conducted a systematic evaluation of studies that investigated laboratory abnormalities in patients with COVID-19 and compared i. patients with a severe form of disease and patients with a non-severe form of the disease, ii. patients who were in critical condition and patients who were not in critical condition, and iii. patients who survived and patients who died. We included 54 studies in the data synthesis. Compared to patients with a non-severe form of COVID-19, patients who had a severe form of disease revealed higher values for white blood cells (WBC), polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN), total bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), creatinine, troponin, procalcitonin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and D-dimer. By contrast, platelet count, lymphocyte count, and albumin levels were decreased in patients with a severe form of COVID-19. Also, patients with a severe phenotype of disease were more likely to have diabetes, chronic heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cerebrovascular disease, hypertension, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and malignancy. Compared to patients who survived, patients who died had higher WBC, PMN, total bilirubin, ALT, procalcitonin, IL-6, creatinine, PT, lymphocyte count, platelet count, and albumin. Also, non-survivors revealed a higher prevalence of diabetes, chronic heart disease, COPD, cerebrovascular disease, and CKD. Meta-analyses identified several laboratory parameters that might help the prediction of severe, critical, and lethal phenotypes of COVID-19. These parameters correlate with the immune system function, inflammation, coagulation, and liver and kidney function.","Gholami, Bahareh; Gholami, Samira; Loghman, Amir Hossein; Khodaei, Behzad; Seyedpour, Simin; Seyedpour, Nasrin; Saghazadeh, Amene; Rezaei, Nima",Adv Exp Med Biol,580,30

During the infection process, the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein plays a crucial role in the receptor recognition and cell membrane fusion process by interacting with the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) receptor. However, new variants of these spike proteins emerge as the virus passes through the disease reservoir. This poses a major challenge for designing a potent antigen for an effective immune response against the spike protein. Through a normal mode analysis (NMA) we identified the highly flexible region in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2, starting from residue 475 up to residue 485. Structurally, the position S477 shows the highest flexibility among them. At the same time, S477 is hitherto the most frequently exchanged amino acid residue in the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 mutants. Therefore, using MD simulations, we have investigated the role of S477 and its two frequent mutations (S477G and S477N) at the RBD during the binding to hACE2. We found that the amino acid exchanges S477G and S477N strengthen the binding of the SARS-COV-2 spike with the hACE2 receptor.","Singh, Amit; Steinkellner, Georg; Köchl, Katharina; Gruber, Karl; Gruber, Christian C",Sci Rep,580,30

Since the beginning of year 2020, COVID-19 has represented a potential harm for cancer patients and has often hindered oncology care. The Collegio Italiano dei Primari Oncologi Medici (CIPOMO) is an Italian association of head physicians in oncology departments, which promotes working and research activities in oncology on a national basis. During the second wave of COVID-19 pandemic, the CIPOMO promoted a national survey aiming to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on oncologists' clinical activity and what changes have been made compared with the Italian situation during the first wave of the pandemic. Overall, 138 heads of medical oncology departments participated in this survey: 75 (54%) from the North, 24 (17%) from the Centre and 39 (28%) from the South of Italy and islands. This survey provides an overview of Italian oncologists facing the second wave of COVID-19 pandemic. The lesson learned during the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic has led to a better organisation of clinical activities, and regular testing among healthcare practitioners, with better chances to grant patients' protection. However, the lack of standardised informatic platforms results in serious challenges in replacing frontal visits, often making a concrete reduction of patients' hospital accesses unfeasible. Oncologists need to keep preserving the continuum of care of patients. Standardisation of safety measures, together with the implementation of informatic platforms, can significantly improve oncology pathways during this second wave of COVID-19 pandemic.","Indini, Alice; Pinotti, Graziella; Artioli, Fabrizio; Aschele, Carlo; Bernardi, Daniele; Butera, Alfredo; Defraia, Efisio; Fasola, Gianpiero; Gamucci, Teresa; Giordano, Monica; Iaria, Antonino; Leo, Silvana; Ribecco, Angela S; Rossetti, Riccardo; Savastano, Clementina; Schena, Marina; Silva, Rosa R; Grossi, Francesco; Blasi, Livio",Eur J Cancer,580,0

Planning for large scientific experiments two decades ahead may no longer be the most sensible approach. I develop the argument that large science experiments are becoming comparable to terrestrial civil infrastructures in terms of cost. As a result, these should incorporate plans for a return on investment (or impact, not necessarily economic), require a different approach for inter-division coordination within the European Space Agency(ESA), and a broader participation of all society stakeholders (civil society representatives, and the broader public). Defining which experiments will be relevant two decades ahead adds rigidity and quenches creativity to the development of cutting edge science and technology. This is likely to discourage both senior and earlier career professionals into supporting such long-term (and often precarious) plans. A more sensible strategy would be increasing the rate of smaller well understood experiments, engage more society sectors in the development of a truly space-bound infrastructure, and formulate a strategy more in tune with the challenges faced by our society and planet. We argue that such strategy would lead to equally large -- even larger -- scale experiments in the same time-scale, while providing economic returns and a common sense of purpose.

Multiple predisposing factors (for example, pre-existing cognitive impairment) and precipitating factors (for example, urinary tract infection) for delirium have been described, with most patients having both types. Because multiple factors are implicated in the aetiology of delirium, there are likely several neurobiological processes that contribute to delirium pathogenesis, including neuroinflammation, brain vascular dysfunction, altered brain metabolism, neurotransmitter imbalance and impaired neuronal network connectivity. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (DSM-5) is the most commonly used diagnostic system upon which a reference standard diagnosis is made, although many other delirium screening tools have been developed given the impracticality of using the DSM-5 in many settings. Pharmacological treatments for delirium (such as antipsychotic drugs) are not effective, reflecting substantial gaps in our understanding of its pathophysiology. Currently, the best management strategies are multidomain interventions that focus on treating precipitating conditions, medication review, managing distress, mitigating complications and maintaining engagement to environmental issues.

We present our experience of a successful rapid adaptation to telemedicine paradigm as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic during a time of marked restriction of access to ambulatory hospital services for pediatric and adult chronic pain patients. This narrative review covers current scientific evidence for the use of telehealth for chronic pain management and describes in detail the challenges to implement telemedicine in ambulatory clinics from different perspectives. Best practices for telehealth use are recommended. A proposal for remote physical examination of pain patients is made, based on available evidence in the fields of musculoskeletal medicine and neurology comparing in-person vs remote physical examination. As an internal quality control process, an informal online survey was conducted to assess thoughts and experiences among patients and caregivers using telemedicine consultation services at the pediatric pain clinic. Providing chronic pain management services through telehealth is a viable option for many patients and health care professionals. This is reliant on the availability of appropriate materials and training, with guidelines for both patients and health care workers.

AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To determine the stress, anxiety, depression, and insomnia levels of intensive care nurses during the pandemic with a structural equation model. DESIGN: A multi-site survey study. METHODS: The study was performed with 194 nurses working in the intensive care units of five hospitals in Istanbul in July 2020. Data were collected using the Depression Anxiety Stress-21 Scale and Insomnia Severity Index electronically. The data were evaluated with descriptive statistics in SPSS package program. In order to test the structural model and hypotheses of the research, path analysis was performed with LISREL statistical software program. A validation study for the suitability of these scales to the study sample was done by the researchers using the confirmatory factor analysis method. The study conforms to the TREND checklist. RESULTS: In this study, the majority of the intensive care nurses had moderate to extremely severe depression (65.5%), anxiety (58.3%) and stress (72.3%) scores; in addition, 39.7% of the nurses experienced moderate or severe insomnia. Within the framework of a structural model; the effects of stress, anxiety and insomnia on depression, which is the dependent variable, were found to be statistically significant (p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: It was found that the majority of the intensive care nurses fighting COVID-19 on the front-line experienced stress, anxiety, depression and insomnia at levels ranging from moderate to extremely severe; in addition, it was determined that there is a positive relationship between stress, anxiety, insomnia and depression.

METHODOLOGY: The multi-center retrospective analysis consisted of 1053 COVID-19 positive patients from March to August 2020. A trend of bradycardia was noted in the study population. Absolute bradycardia and profound bradycardia was defined as a sustained heart rate < 60 BPM and < 50 BPM, respectively, on two separate occasions, a minimum of 4 h apart during hospitalization. Each bradycardic event was confirmed by two physicians and exclusion criteria included: less than 18 years old, end of life bradycardia, left AMA, or taking AV Nodal blockers. Data was fetched using a SQL program through the EMR and data was analyzed using SPSS 27.0. A logistic regression was done to study the effect of bradycardia, age, gender, and BMI on mortality in the study group. RESULTS: 24.9% patients had absolute bradycardia while 13.0% had profound bradycardia. Patients with absolute bradycardia had an odds ratio of 6.59 (95% CI [2.83-15.36]) for mortality compared with individuals with a normal HR response.

The purpose of this study was to examine survival characteristics in patients suffering torso trauma with no recorded vital signs (VS) in the emergency department (ED). METHODS: The National Trauma Data Bank was analyzed from 2007 to 2015. Inclusion criteria were patients with blunt and penetrating torso trauma without VS in the ED. Patients with head injuries, transfers from other hospitals, or those with missing values were excluded. The characteristics of survivors were evaluated, and statistical analyses performed. RESULTS: A total of 24,191 torso trauma patients without VS were evaluated in the ED and 96.6% were declared dead upon arrival. There were 246 survivors (1%), and 73 (0.3%) were eventually discharged home. Of patients who responded to resuscitation (812), the survival rate was 30.3%. Injury severity score (ISS), penetrating mechanism (odds ratio [OR] 1.99), definitive chest (OR 1.59) and abdominal surgery (OR 1.49) were associated with improved survival. Discharge to home (or police custody) was associated with lower ISS (OR 0.975) and shorter ED time (OR 0.99). CONCLUSION: Over a recent nine-year period in the United States, nearly 25,000 trauma patients were treated at trauma centers despite lack of VS. Of these patients, only 73 were discharged home. A trauma center would have to attempt over one hundred resuscitations of traumatic arrests to save one patient, confirming previous reports that highlight a grave prognosis.

Hence, it is necessary to rapidly find the drug-candidates that can be used to treat the infection. Since the main protease (Mpro) is the key protein in the virus's life cycle, Mpro is served as one of the critical targets of antiviral treatment. We employed virtual screening tools to search for new inhibitors to accelerate the drug discovery process. The hit compounds were subsequently docked into the active site of SARS-CoV-2 main protease and ranked by their binding energy. Furthermore, in-silico ADME studies were performed to probe for adoption with the standard ranges. Finally, molecular dynamics simulations were applied to study the protein-drug complex's fluctuation over time in an aqueous medium. This study indicates that the interaction energy of the top ten retrieved compounds with COVID-19 main protease is much higher than the interaction energy of some currently in use protease drugs such as ML188, nelfinavir, lopinavir, ritonavir, and &#945;-ketoamide. Among the discovered compounds, Pubchem44326934 showed druglike properties and was further analyzed by MD and MM/PBSA approaches.

Italy's hospitals have been among the most severely overwhelmed, and as a result, Italian healthcare workers' (HCWs) well-being has been at risk. The aim of this study is to explore the relationships between dimensions of burnout and various psychological features among Italian healthcare workers (HCWs) during the COVID-19 emergency. A group of 267 HCWs from a hospital in the Lazio Region completed self-administered questionnaires online through Google Forms, including the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI), Resilience Scale, and Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale Short Form (IU). Cluster analysis highlighted two opposite burnout risk profiles: low burnout and high-risk burnout. The high-risk group had lower resilience and greater difficulties in tolerating the uncertainty than the low-burnout group. A set of general linear models confirmed that both IU subscales, prospective and inhibition, moderated the relationship between resilience and burnout (specifically in the depersonalization dimension). In conclusion, the results showed that individual levels of resilience and one's ability to tolerate uncertainty have been significant factors in determining the impact of the COVID-19 emergency on HCWs. The use of emotional strategies that allow individuals to stay in a critical situation without the need to control it appears to protect against burnout in these circumstances.","Di Trani, M.; Mariani, R.; Ferri, R.; De Berardinis, D.; Frigo, M.

During this period, there was a significant increase in supermarket expenditure. It has been shown that stress, anxiety and boredom are triggers for unhealthy eating habits. Fat consumption is a risk factor for both the development of gallstones and, additionally, the development of acute calculous cholecystitis. The aim of this study was to assess the incidence of acute calculous cholecystitis during the nationwide lockdown and compare it to the same period one year prior. METHODS: A retrospective review of all emergency abdominal imaging performed during the first 5 weeks of the lockdown was completed using the hospital PACS (picture archiving and communication system). All cases of acute calculous cholecystitis were identified and compared with the same period 1 year prior. RESULTS: Eighteen cases of acute calculous cholecystitis were identified from 24 March to 27 April 2020. Eleven cases were identified during the same period in 2019. This represented an increase of 63%. Non-COVID-19-related emergency presentations decreased during this period, and imaging of emergency presentations decreased by 24%. The rate of scans positive for acute cholecystitis more than doubled (p < 0.037). CONCLUSION: A statistically significant increase in cases of acute calculous cholecystitis was observed during a nationwide lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is hypothesised that this is due to increased consumption of fatty foods during this period due to stress, anxiety and boredom.","Murphy, Mark C; Dempsey, Philip J; Gillespie, Ciara D; Murphy, Alexandra N; McNicholas, Michelle M J",Ir. j. med. sci,580,11

COVID-19 is associated with notable increases in morbidity and death worldwide. Preexisting conditions, like cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes, hypertension, and obesity, are correlated with higher severity and a significant increase in the fatality rate of COVID-19. COVID-19 induces multiple cardiovascular complexities, such as cardiac arrest, myocarditis, acute myocardial injury, stress-induced cardiomyopathy, cardiogenic shock, arrhythmias and, subsequently, heart failure (HF). The precise mechanisms of how SARS-CoV-2 may cause myocardial complications are not clearly understood. The proposed mechanisms of myocardial injury based on current knowledge are the direct viral entry of the virus and damage to the myocardium, systemic inflammation, hypoxia, cytokine storm, interferon-mediated immune response, and plaque destabilization. The virus enters the cell through the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor and plays a central function in the virus's pathogenesis. A systematic understanding of cardiovascular effects of SARS-CoV2 is needed to develop novel therapeutic tools to target the virus-induced cardiac damage as a potential strategy to minimize permanent damage to the cardiovascular system and reduce the morbidity.

Hospital workers are at high risk of mental illness, such as anxiety and depression. Furthermore, they also face many social stresses, such as deterioration of human relations and income reduction. Apart from mental illness, these social stresses can reduce motivation and lead to voluntary absenteeism, which contribute to a collapse of medical systems. Thus, for maintaining medical systems, it is crucial to clarify risk factors for both mental illness and increased social stress among hospital workers. However, little attention has been paid to factors affecting social stress, and thus, we aimed to address this gap. METHODS: In this cross-sectional survey of 588 hospital workers, the levels of anxiety, depression, and social stress were assessed using the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7), 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), and Tokyo Metropolitan Distress Scale for Pandemic (TMDP). Multiple regression analyses were conducted to identify the demographic variables affecting these problems. RESULTS: Older age and female sex were common risk factors for anxiety, depression, and social stress.

Hospital workers are at high risk of mental illness, such as anxiety and depression. Furthermore, they also face many social stresses, such as deterioration of human relations and income reduction. Apart from mental illness, these social stresses can reduce motivation and lead to voluntary absenteeism, which contribute to a collapse of medical systems. Thus, for maintaining medical systems, it is crucial to clarify risk factors for both mental illness and increased social stress among hospital workers. However, little attention has been paid to factors affecting social stress, and thus, we aimed to address this gap. METHODS: In this cross-sectional survey of 588 hospital workers, the levels of anxiety, depression, and social stress were assessed using the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7), 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), and Tokyo Metropolitan Distress Scale for Pandemic (TMDP). Multiple regression analyses were conducted to identify the demographic variables affecting these problems. RESULTS: Older age and female sex were common risk factors for anxiety, depression, and social stress. Moreover, occupational exposure to COVID-19 and hospital staff other than doctors/fewer non-work days were risk factors for increased anxiety and depression, respectively. Furthermore, living with families/others was a risk factor for increased social stress during this pandemic.

The COVID-19 pandemic has no contrast from previous outbreaks like SARS and MERS regarding their ensuing worries and boosted anxiety levels. This article seeks to examine the unique psychological changes that occur in students who have been quarantined inside a university campus and assess sociodemographic factors associated with certain psychological factors. Methodology: The data was collected from students in an Agricultural Campus. In the first phase, the factor structure of the modified National Index Psychological Wellness (NIPW) was acceptable, and to establish statistical parameters for validation an exploratory factor analysis was done. In the second phase, Independent T-tests, ANOVA, and Hierarchical Multiple regression were performed. Data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 26.0. Result/Discussion: A total of 46 male and 76 female students enrolled in this study. The Bartlett's test of sphericity was significant (p &lt; 0.001) and the Kaiser-Mayer-Olkin measure of sampling adequacy for the AUDIT-M was 0.901. The Cronbach's alpha of the entire modified NIPW was 0.657 which suggests reasonable internal consistency and subscales between 0.913 and 0.924. Raw scores of 12 positive items were higher for the quarantined group except for ""I can do daily routines,"" ""I understand what happens,"" and ""I understand the action that is performed is fair."" Raw mean scores of eight negative scoring items were higher in the quarantined group, except for ""I feel angry"" (2.88 vs. 2.89 for non-quarantined group). There were statistically significant differences between year groups for the questions ""I understand what happens,"" ""I understand the action that is performed is fair,"" and ""I think everyone is good."" Conclusion: Movement control orders or compulsory quarantine orders can be distressing and may cause understandable psychological sequelae. Holistic management of a quarantine center that addresses the needs and health of an individual student will give a positive impact on psychological wellness. Quarantining facilities can be a place of positivity, allowing people to live a shared experience together, provide peer support for each other, and give each other hope.","Muhamad, A. B.; Pang, N.

Therefore, we aimed to assess the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic among Chinese pregnant women from February 2020 until March 2020. METHODS: Our study was conducted using a modified validated online questionnaire comprising of sociodemographic, the Impact of Event Scale (IES), attitude and mental health-related questions towards COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of 560 women were included. The overall mean age and IES of women was 25.8 ± 2.7 years and 31.4 ± 13.7. Moreover, 67.1% of them had IES ⩾26. Psychological impact seemed to be more severe in women in second trimester of pregnancy (the highest IES) (p = .016). There was a significant association between trimesters of pregnancy and some indicators of negative health impacts (including increased stress from work, increased stress from home, feeling apprehensive and helpless during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic) (all p < .05).

A number of SCCD affected families have been reported in the world since 1924, when it was first described. In 2007, the molecular basis of SCCD was demonstrated to be associated with a tumor suppressor, UbiA prenyltransferase domain-containing 1 (UBIAD1), which was isolated from the bladder mucosa and demonstrated to be involved in vitamin K(2) and CoQ10 biosynthesis. This sterol triggers the binding of UBIAD1 to 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) at endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes, which is regulated by an intracellular geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGpp) molecule. The inability of SCCD-associated UBIAD1 to bind GGpp results in the consistent binding of UBIAD1 to HMGCR at ER membranes. This binding leads to HMGCRs being redundant. Therefore, they cannot be degraded through ER-associated degradation to synthesize abundant cholesterol in tissue cells. Excess corneal cholesterol accumulation thus leads to SCCD disease. After decades, the efforts of numerous ophthalmologists and scientists have helped clarify the molecular basis and pathogenesis of SCCD, which has guided the effective diagnosis and treatment of this genetic disorder. However, more studies need to be conducted to understand the pathogenesis of SCCD disease from a genetic basis by studying the defective gene, UBIAD1. Results would guide effective diagnosis and treatment of the inherited eye disease.","Xie, Jumin; Li, Lingxing",Mol Med Rep,580,20

Methods: In this phase 3, global, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, 1525 hospitalized adults with COVID-19 receiving standard of care (SOC) were randomly assigned (1:1) to once-daily baricitinib 4-mg (N=764) or placebo (N=761) for up to 14 days. SOC included systemic corticosteroids in ~79% of participants (dexamethasone ~90%). The primary endpoint was the proportion who progressed to high-flow oxygen, non-invasive ventilation, invasive mechanical ventilation, or death by day 28. A key secondary endpoint was all-cause mortality by day 28. Results: Overall, 27.8% of participants receiving baricitinib vs 30.5% receiving placebo progressed (primary endpoint, odds ratio 0.85, 95% CI 0.67-1.08; p=0.18). The 28-day all-cause mortality was 8.1% for baricitinib and 13.1% for placebo, corresponding to a 38.2% reduction in mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 0.57, 95% CI 0.41-0.78; nominal p=0.002); 1 additional death was prevented per 20 baricitinib-treated participants. Reduction in mortality was seen for all pre-specified subgroups of baseline severity (most pronounced for participants on high-flow oxygen/non-invasive ventilation at baseline [17.5%, baricitinib vs 29.4%, placebo; HR 0.52, 95% CI 0.33-0.80; nominal p=0.007]). The frequency of adverse events, serious adverse events, serious infections, and venous thromboembolic events was similar between groups. Conclusions: While reduction of disease progression did not achieve statistical significance, treatment with baricitinib in addition to SOC (predominantly dexamethasone) significantly reduced mortality with a similar safety profile between groups of hospitalized COVID-19 participants.","Marconi, V.

One of the most important pathologies, is hypercoagulation and microclots in the lungs of patients. Here we study the effect of isolated SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1 subunit as potential inflammagen sui generis. Using scanning electron and fluorescence microscopy as well as mass spectrometry, we investigate the potential of this inflammagen to interact with platelets and fibrin(ogen) directly to cause blood hypercoagulation. Using platelet poor plasma (PPP), we show that spike protein may interfere with blood flow. Mass spectrometry also showed that when spike protein S1 is added to healthy PPP, it results in structural changes to {beta} and {gamma} fibrin(ogen), complement 3, and prothrombin. These proteins were substantially resistant to trypsinization, in the presence of spike protein S1. Here we suggest that, in part, the presence of spike protein in circulation may contribute to the hypercoagulation in COVID-19 positive patients and may cause substantial impairment of fibrinolysis. Such lytic impairment may result in the persistent large microclots we have noted here and previously in plasma samples of COVID-19 patients. This observation may have important clinical relevance in the treatment of hypercoagulability in COVID-19 patients.","Grobbelaar, L. M.; Venter, C.; Vlok, M.; Ngoepe, M.; Laubscher, G.

In the central nervous system (CNS), EVs are important in both homeostasis and pathology. Through receptor–ligand interactions, direct fusion, or endocytosis, EVs interact with their target cells. Accumulating evidence indicates that EVs play crucial roles in the pathogenesis of many neurodegenerative disorders (NDs), including Parkinson′s disease (PD). PD is the second most common ND, characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic (DAergic) neurons within the Substantia Nigra pars compacta (SNpc). In PD, EVs are secreted by both neurons and glial cells, with either beneficial or detrimental effects, via a complex program of cell-to-cell communication. The functions of EVs in PD range from their etiopathogenetic relevance to their use as diagnostic tools and innovative carriers of therapeutics. Because they can cross the blood–brain barrier, EVs can be engineered to deliver bioactive molecules (e.g., small interfering RNAs, catalase) within the CNS.

These include ~18 different viral-induced encephalopathies for which data are available, at least ~10 known prion diseases (PrD) of animals and humans, Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other sporadic and progressive age-related neurological disorders. Despite the apparent lack of nucleic acids in prions, both DNA- and RNA-containing viruses along with prions significantly induce miRNA-146a in the infected host, but whether this represents part of the host’s adaptive immunity, innate-immune response or a mechanism to enable the invading prion or virus a successful infection is not well understood. Current findings suggest an early and highly interactive role for miRNA-146a: (i) as a major small noncoding RNA (sncRNA) regulator of innate-immune responses and inflammatory signaling in cells of the human brain and CNS; (ii) as a critical component of the complement system and immune-related neurological dysfunction; (iii) as an inducible sncRNA of the brain and CNS that lies at a critical intersection of several important neurobiological adaptive immune response processes with highly interactive associations involving complement factor H (CFH), Toll-like receptor pathways, the innate-immunity, cytokine production, apoptosis and neural cell decline; and (iv) as a potential biomarker for viral infection, TSE and AD and other neurological diseases in both animals and humans. In this report, we review the recent data supporting the idea that miRNA-146a may represent a novel and unique sncRNA-based biomarker for inflammatory neurodegeneration in multiple species. This paper further reviews the current state of knowledge regarding the nature and mechanism of miRNA-146a in viral and prion infection of the human brain and CNS with reference to AD wherever possible.","Pogue, Aileen I.; Lukiw, Walter J.",Int J Mol Sci,580,18

Emission reduction alone induces PM(2.5) decrease by 16.3 μg m(−3) and O(3) increase by 10.2 ppbv during COVID‐19 lockdown. The ARF enhances PM(2.5) decrease by 2.7 μg m(−3) (16.6%) and O(3) increase by 0.8 ppbv (7.8%). The ARF‐induced enhancement of PM(2.5) decline is mostly attributed to aerosol chemistry process, while enhancement of O(3) rise is ascribed to physical advection and vertical mixing processes. A set of sensitivity experiments with emission reductions in different degrees indicate that the ARF‐induced enhancements of PM(2.5) declines (O(3) rises) follow a robust linear relationship with the emission‐reduction‐induced PM(2.5) decreases.

METHODS: Country-specific data for COVID-19 cases and deaths, demographic details, BCG coverage and policy, age-specific TB incidence and income level were obtained. The crude COVID-19 cases and deaths per 100,000 population were calculated and assessed against the parameters indicating immunity from BCG using linear regression analysis. RESULTS: Univariate analysis identified higher income level of a country to be significantly associated with COVID-19 cases (p < 0.0001) and deaths (p < 0.0001) but not with its case fatality rate. The association between COVID-19 and TB was strongest for TB incidence in patients > 65-years (Cases (r(s) = − 0.785,p = 0.0001)) and deaths (r(s) = − 0.647,p = 0.0001). Multivariate analysis identified the higher income level of a country and not having a universal BCG vaccination policy to affect the COVID-19 cases. The deaths were inversely affected by the presence of BCG vaccination policy and coverage; and positively by the TB incidence in patients > 65-years. CONCLUSION: Significant inverse correlations observed between cases and deaths of COVID-19 and BCG related parameters highlights immunity from BCG as a likely explanation for the variation in COVID-19 across countries.","Wickramasinghe, Dakshitha; Wickramasinghe, Nilanka; Kamburugamuwa, Sohan Anjana; Arambepola, Carukshi; Samarasekera, Dharmabandhu N.",Trop Dis Travel Med Vaccines,580,10

METHODS: This is a single‐center retrospective analysis of 242 patients with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) admitted to both intensive care and non‐intensive care settings. Bacterial coinfection was determined by the presence of characteristic clinical features and positive culture results. Multivariable logistic regression was used to analyze the association of concomitant bacterial infection with inpatient death after adjusting for demographic factors and comorbidities. Antibiotic use pattern was also determined. RESULTS: Bacterial coinfection was detected in 46 (19%) patients. Genitourinary source was the most frequent, representing 57% of all coinfections. The overall mortality rate was 21%. Concomitant bacterial infections were independently associated with increased inpatient mortality (OR: 5.838; 95% CI: 2.647‐12.876). Patients with bacterial coinfection were relatively older (71.35±11.20 vs. 64.78±15.23; p 0.006%). 67% of patients received antibiotic therapy, yet 72% did not have an obvious source of bacterial infection. There was a significantly higher rate of inpatient mortality in patients who received antibiotics compared to those who did not (30% vs. 5%; p<0.0001).

This article describes developments of the CSAVR tool to more flexibly model diagnosis rates over time, estimate incidence patterns by sex and age group and by key population group. METHODS: We modelled HIV diagnosis rate trends as a mixture of three factors, including temporal and opportunistic infection components. The tool was expanded to estimate incidence rate ratios by sex and age for countries with disaggregated reporting of new HIV diagnoses and AIDS deaths, and to account for information on key populations such as men who have sex with men (MSM), males who inject drugs (MWID), female sex workers (FSW) and females who inject drugs (FWID). We used a Bayesian framework to calibrate the tool in 71 high‐income or low‐HIV burden countries. RESULTS: Across countries, an estimated median 89% (interquartile range [IQR]: 78%–96%) of HIV‐positive adults knew their status in 2019. Mean CD4 counts at diagnosis were stable over time, with a median of 456 cells/μl (IQR: 391–508) across countries in 2019. In European countries reporting new HIV diagnoses among key populations, median estimated proportions of males that are MSM and MWID was 1.3% (IQR: 0.9%–2.0%) and 0.56% (IQR: 0.51%–0.64%), respectively. The median estimated proportions of females that are FSW and FWID were 0.36% (IQR: 0.27%–0.45%) and 0.14 (IQR: 0.13%–0.15%), respectively. HIV incidence per 100 person‐years increased among MSM, with median estimates reaching 0.43 (IQR: 0.29–1.73) in 2019, but remained stable in MWID, FSW and FWID, at around 0.12 (IQR: 0.04–1.9), 0.09 (IQR: 0.06–0.69) and 0.13% (IQR: 0.08%–0.91%) in 2019, respectively. Knowledge of HIV status among HIV‐positive adults gradually increased since the early 1990s to exceed 75% in more than 75% of countries in 2019 among each key population. CONCLUSIONS: CSAVR offers an approach to using routine surveillance and vital registration data to estimate and project trends in both HIV incidence and knowledge of HIV status.","Mahiane, Severin G.; Eaton, Jeffrey W.; Glaubius, Robert; Case, Kelsey K.; Sabin, Keith M.; Marsh, Kimberly",J Int AIDS Soc,580,23

However, the data on anxiety among the admitted COVID-19 patients are lacking in India and elsewhere. Hence, the study was conducted among the admitted patient of COVID-19 to describe their anxiety status. METHODS: The study was conducted as a cross-sectional study in a designated COVID-19 hospital in Delhi. The data were collected from October 22, 2020, to November 21, 2020. All patients who were admitted to the hospital for more than 72 h were eligible for participation. The data collection was done using a questionnaire. The questionnaire consists of two parts. One part was sociodemographic variables, and the other part was the Anxiety Scale. The anxiety score was collected on the Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale. RESULTS: A total of 132 eligible patients were admitted during the period. The questionnaire was answered by 122 (92.4%) patients. All patients were male. The patients' mean age was 33.5 years (standard deviation = 8.9 years), with a range of 21 years–65 years. The mean score of the Zung Self-Rating Scale was 29.5 (7.2), with an interquartile range of 24–33. There were only five patients (4.4%; 95% confidence interval: 1.3%–9.3%) whose scores were 45 or more, indicating mild-to-moderate anxiety. There was no statistically significant association between any sociodemographic variable and Anxiety Rating Scale. CONCLUSION: The anxiety level in the specialized population was low due to social security. The level of anxiety among health-care workers may be further explored.","Yadav, Arun Kumar; Yadav, Gaurav; Ravi, D.; Sagar, Ram; Srivastava, Kalpana; Yadav, Jyoti; Mukherjee, Reema",Ind Psychiatry J,580,4

METHODS: The database of the Turkish Ministry of Health was searched in order to identify all consecutive gynecologic cancer patients undergoing major surgery between March 11, 2020 and April 30, 2020 for this retrospective, nationwide, cohort study. The inclusion criteria were strictly founded on a final histopathological diagnosis of a malignant gynecologic tumor. COVID-19 cases were diagnosed by reverse transcriptase- polymerase chain reaction testing for SARS-CoV-2. The rate of perioperative SARS-CoV-2 infection and the 30-day mortality rate of COVID-19 patients were investigated. RESULTS: During the study period, 688 women with gynecologic cancer undergoing major surgery were identified nationwide. The median age of the patients was 59 years. Most of the surgeries were open (634/688, 92.2%). There were 410 (59.6%) women with endometrial cancer, 195 (28.3%) with ovarian cancer, 66 (9.6%) with cervical cancer, 14 (2.0%) with vulvar cancer and 3 (0.4%) with uterine sarcoma. The rate of SARS-CoV-2 infections confirmed within 7 days before or 30 days after surgery was 46/688 (6.7%). All but one woman was diagnosed postoperatively (45/46, 97.8%). The rates of intensive care unit admission and invasive mechanical ventilation were 4/46 (8.7%) and 2/46 (4.3%), respectively. The 30-day mortality rate was 0%.

This study aimed to investigate and compare predictive capacity of main pulmonary artery diameter (MPA), ascending aorta diameter (AAo), and MPA‐to‐AAo ratio to determine in‐hospital mortality in COVID‐19 patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study included 255 hospitalized severe or critical COVID‐19 patients. MPA was measured at the level of pulmonary artery bifurcation perpendicular to the direction of the vessel through transverse axial images and AAo was measured by using the same CT slice at its maximal diameter. MPA‐to‐AAo ratio was calculated by division of MPA to AAo. RESULTS: Multivariate logistic regression model yielded MPA ≥29.15 mm (OR: 4.95, 95% CI: 2.01–12.2, p = 0.001), MPA (OR: 1.28, 95% CI: 1.13–1.46, p < 0.001), AAo (OR: .90, 95% CI: .81–.99, p = 0.040), and MPA‐to‐AAo ratio ≥.82 (OR: 4.67, 95% CI: 1.86–11.7, p = 0.001) as independent predictors of in‐hospital mortality. Time‐dependent multivariate Cox‐proportion regression model demonstrated MPA ≥29.15 mm (HR: 1.96, 95% CI: 1.03–3.90, p = 0.047) and MPA (HR: 1.08, 95% CI: 1.01–1.17, p = 0.048) as independent predictors of in‐hospital mortality, whereas AAo and MPA‐to‐AAo ratio did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSION: Pulmonary artery enlargement strongly predicts in‐hospital mortality in hospitalized COVID‐19 patients.
