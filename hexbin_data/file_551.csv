It is publicly available and the underlying code is open source. Since our last update two years ago, we have had 10 releases to maintain and continuously improve evidence for target–disease relationships from 20 different data sources. In addition, we have integrated new evidence from key datasets, including prioritised targets identified from genome-wide CRISPR knockout screens in 300 cancer models (Project Score), and GWAS/UK BioBank statistical genetic analysis evidence from the Open Targets Genetics Portal. We have evolved our evidence scoring framework to improve target identification. To aid the prioritisation of targets and inform on the potential impact of modulating a given target, we have added evaluation of post-marketing adverse drug reactions and new curated information on target tractability and safety. We have also developed the user interface and backend technologies to improve performance and usability. In this article, we describe the latest enhancements to the Platform, to address the fundamental challenge that developing effective and safe drugs is difficult and expensive.","Ochoa, David; Hercules, Andrew; Carmona, Miguel; Suveges, Daniel; Gonzalez-Uriarte, Asier; Malangone, Cinzia; Miranda, Alfredo; Fumis, Luca; Carvalho-Silva, Denise; Spitzer, Michaela; Baker, Jarrod; Ferrer, Javier; Raies, Arwa; Razuvayevskaya, Olesya; Faulconbridge, Adam; Petsalaki, Eirini; Mutowo, Prudence; Machlitt-Northen, Sandra; Peat, Gareth; McAuley, Elaine; Ong, Chuang Kee; Mountjoy, Edward; Ghoussaini, Maya; Pierleoni, Andrea; Papa, Eliseo; Pignatelli, Miguel; Koscielny, Gautier; Karim, Mohd; Schwartzentruber, Jeremy; Hulcoop, David G; Dunham, Ian; McDonagh, Ellen M",Nucleic Acids Res,551,1

Although acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has in principle been shown to be a T cell-sensitive disease by the graft-versus-leukemia activity of allogeneic stem cell transplantation, T cell therapy has so far failed in this setting. This is largely due to the lack of target structures both sufficiently selective and uniformly expressed on AML, causing unacceptable myeloid cell toxicity. To address this, we developed a modular and controllable MHC-unrestricted adoptive T cell therapy platform tailored to AML. This platform combines synthetic agonistic receptor (SAR) -transduced T cells with AML-targeting tandem single chain variable fragment (scFv) constructs. Construct exchange allows SAR T cells to be redirected toward alternative targets, a process enabled by the short half-life and controllability of these antibody fragments. Combining SAR-transduced T cells with the scFv constructs resulted in selective killing of CD33(+) and CD123(+) AML cell lines, as well as of patient-derived AML blasts. Durable responses and persistence of SAR-transduced T cells could also be demonstrated in AML xenograft models. Together these results warrant further translation of this novel platform for AML treatment.","Benmebarek, Mohamed-Reda; Cadilha, Bruno L.; Herrmann, Monika; Lesch, Stefanie; Schmitt, Saskia; Stoiber, Stefan; Darwich, Abbass; Augsberger, Christian; Brauchle, Bettina; Rohrbacher, Lisa; Oner, Arman; Seifert, Matthias; Schwerdtfeger, Melanie; Gottschlich, Adrian; Rataj, Felicitas; Fenn, Nadja C.; Klein, Christian; Subklewe, Marion; Endres, Stefan; Hopfner, Karl-Peter; Kobold, Sebastian",Leukemia,551,17

METHODS: Patients undergoing major spinal deformity surgeries involving ≥ 6 levels of fusion and expected blood loss ≥ 750 ml between September 2017 and August 2018 were included in the study. The patients were randomized into two groups: FWBG and CG, receiving fresh whole blood and component transfusions, respectively. RESULTS: A total of 65 patients with spinal deformities of different etiologies were included. The mean age was 14.0 and 14.9 years in FWB and CG, respectively. All other preoperative parameters were comparable. The mean fusion levels and surgical time were 11.1 and 221.20 min in FWB, as compared with 10.70 and 208.74minutes in CG, respectively. Intraoperative blood losses were 929 ml (FWBG) and 847 ml(CG), and the mean volumes of transfusion were 1.90 (FWBG) and 1.65 units (CG). FWBG was significantly superior to CG in the following clinical and laboratory parameters: duration of oxygen dependence [36.43 (FWBG) vs. 43.45 h (CG); P = 0.0256], mean arterial pH [7.442 (FWBG) vs. 7.394 (CG); p < 0.001], interleukin-6 [30.04 (FWBG) vs. 35.10 (CG); p < 0.019], mean duration of HDU stay [40.6 hours (FWBG) vs 46.51 hours (CG); p = 0.0234] and postoperative facial puffiness [7/30 in FWBG vs. 18/35 (CG) (P < 0.02)]. CONCLUSION: FWB transfusion can potentially improve the immediate postoperative outcome in patients undergoing major spinal deformity surgeries by reducing the duration of intensive care unit stay and oxygen dependence. The other potential benefits of this practice, based on our study, include a reduced inflammatory response (reduced lactate and IL-6) and postoperative facial puffiness. However, further large-scale validation studies in future are necessary to precisely determine the role of FWB in spine surgeries. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE II: Diagnostic: individual cross-sectional studies with the consistently applied reference standard and blinding.","Vasan, P.

AIM: We explored the relationship between premorbid adjustment and childhood trauma, timing of childhood trauma’s moderating role as well as the association of clinical and treatment-related confounders with premorbid adjustment. SETTING: We conducted a secondary analysis in 111 patients with first-episode schizophrenia (FES) disorders that formed part of two parent studies, EONKCS study (n =73) and the Shared Roots study (n =38). METHODS: Type of childhood trauma was assessed with the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, short-form and premorbid adjustment using the Premorbid Adjustment Scale. Timing of childhood trauma was assessed using the Life Events Checklist and life events timeline. Linear regression analyses were used to assess the moderating effect of timing of childhood trauma. Clinical and treatment-related confounders were entered into sequential hierarchical regression models to identify independent predictors of premorbid adjustment across key life stages. RESULTS: Childhood physical neglect was associated with poorer premorbid academic functioning during childhood and early adolescence, and poorer premorbid social functioning during early and late adolescence. By hierarchical regression modelling (r(2) = 0.13), higher physical neglect subscale scores (p = 0.011) independently predicted poorer premorbid social adjustment during early adolescence. Timing of childhood trauma did not moderate the relationship between childhood trauma and premorbid functioning. CONCLUSION: In patients with FES, childhood physical neglect may contribute to poorer premorbid social functioning during early adolescence. This may provide us with an opportunity to identify and treat at-risk individuals earlier.","Smit, Anna M.; Kilian, Sanja; Emsley, Robin A.; Luckhoff, Hilmar K.; Swartz, Leslie; Seedat, Soraya; Asmal, Laila",S Afr J Psychiatr,551,1

In Germany this technology is controversially discussed and used very differently. Therefore, a survey was carried out on the availability, indications, contraindications, and future significance of EES. METHODS: A questionnaire with 20 questions was sent to 141 German university and central departments of otorhinolaryngology, head and neck surgery. The results are discussed on the basis of current literature retrieved in a search of PubMed and Google Scholar. RESULTS: The response rate was 32% (45 clinics). Of these respondents, 27 clinics (60%) stated that EES was usually carried out as an accompanying measure. Only one clinic performed ear surgery endoscopically alone. In cases of intraoperative bleeding, mastoid drilling, or if bimanual work was required, the surgeons switched to microscopic ear surgery (MES). The most common indications for EES were tympanoscopy, cholesteatoma, retraction pockets, and interventions on the tympanic membrane and external auditory canal. The necessary resources for EES were estimated to be higher than for MES in 49–50% of the responding clinics. Tragus cartilage dominated as the graft material for reconstruction in EES clinics, at 78%. Only 4 of 45 responding clinics rated the future significance of ESS in Germany as high. CONCLUSION: Although EES is used in Germany, only few ENT clinics use it extensively. Reservations relate to one-handed working, drilling, management of bleeding, and the expected high resource demand. Thus, EES in Germany is often performed as an accompanying procedure, with switching between EES and MES.","Agha-Mir-Salim, Parwis; Kropp, Miriam; Müller, Alexander",HNO,551,1

It is vital, therefore, that stringent measures are taken to counter acts of unlawful interference with civil aviation. Following a diplomatic conference, held in Beijing from 30 August to 10 September 2010 under the auspices of the International Civil Aviation Organization, representatives from more than 80 States adopted two international air law instruments for the suppression of unlawful acts relating to civil aviation. The two instruments are the Convention on the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Relating to International Civil Aviation and the Protocol Supplementary to the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft. The Beijing Convention serves international civil aviation well, by requiring parties to criminalize a number of new and emerging threats to the safety of civil aviation, including using aircraft as a weapon and organizing, directing and financing acts of terrorism. These new treaties reflect the international community’s shared effort to prevent acts of terrorism against civil aviation and to prosecute and punish those who would commit them. The treaties promote cooperation between States while emphasizing the human rights and fair treatment of terrorist suspects. The Convention also obligates States to criminalize the transport of biological, chemical, nuclear weapons and related material. However, many provisions of the Convention, which is a new comer to aviation security in the context of some new provisions it introduces, need interpretation.

In this context, most of recent approaches exploit similarity learning through comparing spatial-temporal patterns between normal and irregular records. However, they are limited in utilizing passenger-level information. First, all passenger transits are fused in a certain region at a timestamp whereas each passenger has own repetitive stops and time slots. Second, these differences in passenger profile result in high intra-class variance of normal records and blur the decision boundaries. To tackle these problems, we propose a modelling framework to extract passenger-level spatial-temporal profile and present a personalised similarity learning for irregular behavior detection. Specifically, a route-to-stop embedding is proposed to extract spatial correlations between transit stops and routes. Then attentive fusion is adopted to uncover spatial repetitive and time invariant patterns. Finally, a personalised similarity function is learned to evaluate the historical and recent mobility patterns. Experimental results on a large-scale dataset demonstrate that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on recall, F1 score and accuracy. Raw features and the extracted patterns are visualized and illustrate the learned deviation between the normal and the irregular records.","Wang, Xuesong; Yao, Lina; Liu, Wei; Li, Can; Bai, Lei; Waller, S.

Instead of a single solution, a level set offers a range of solutions each meeting the goal and thus provides useful knowledge in tolerance for industrial product design. The proposed warping scheme increases performance of existing level set estimation algorithms - in particular the ambiguity acquisition function. This is done by constructing a complex covariance function to warp the Gaussian Process. The covariance function is designed to expand regions deemed to have a high potential for being at the desired level whilst contracting others. Subsequently, Bayesian optimisation using this covariance function ensures that the level set is sampled more thoroughly. Experimental results demonstrate increased efficiency of level set discovery using the warping scheme. Theoretical analysis concerning warping the covariance function, maximum information gain and bounds on the cumulative regret are provided.","Senadeera, Manisha; Rana, Santu; Gupta, Sunil; Venkatesh, Svetha",Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,551,29

One area which seems to receive less attention is that of inducing a class taxonomy from such graphs. Ontologies, which provide the axiomatic foundation on which knowledge graphs are built, are often governed by a set of class subsumption axioms. These class subsumptions form a class taxonomy which hierarchically organizes the type classes present in the knowledge graph. Manually creating and curating these class taxonomies oftentimes requires expert knowledge and is time costly, especially in large-scale knowledge graphs. Thus, methods capable of inducing the class taxonomy from the knowledge graph data automatically are an appealing solution to the problem. In this paper, we propose a simple method for inducing class taxonomies from knowledge graphs that is scalable to large datasets. Our method borrows ideas from tag hierarchy induction methods, relying on class frequencies and co-occurrences, such that it requires no information outside the knowledge graph’s triple representation. We demonstrate the use of our method on three real-world datasets and compare our results with existing tag hierarchy induction methods. We show that our proposed method outperforms existing tag hierarchy induction methods, although both perform well when applied to knowledge graphs.","Pietrasik, Marcin; Reformat, Marek",The Semantic Web,551,16

In this paper, we want to extend fCM by an exception handling approach. Thereby, existing exception patterns for workflow systems are used and extended by the fragment-level for handling unknown events. In order to enable direct integration and avoid a duplication of semantics, precise rules are specified in order to clarify how to extend which pattern in detail.

Sixty-eight institutions declared to have capacities with a broad distribution across Germany and its federal states. Overall, 1094 “beds” for prolonged weaning (and neurorehabilitation) were reported, 871 together with further information regarding their identification and hence regional location. These units had on average 16.1 beds for prolonged weaning (95% confidence interval 12.6 to 19.6) with a range from 2 to 68 beds per organization.

Even if our security proof is not complete, we think that it is convincing and that the technical tools considered in this paper are interesting by themselves. Moreover, the factoring assumption is just needed to ensure that solving nonlinear equations or finding non-null polynomials with many roots is difficult. Consequently, the ideas behind our construction could be re-used in rings satisfying these properties. As motivating perspectives, we then propose to develop a simple multiplicative operator.

Then, we analyze the content posted in social media by pastors and churches of the Brazilian diaspora in the United States and other church leaders to ascertain their position regarding the responses to the COVID-19 crisis. Results show the churches responded to the pandemic in three primary ways: they adhered to authorities’ guidelines, provided sermons with apocalyptic undertones, and organized food pantries and donations for members in need.","Serrão, Rodrigo; Chaves, João",Int J Lat Am Relig,551,1

Dietary patterns are different based on cultural, environmental, technological, and economic factors. Nutritional deficiencies of energy, protein, and specific micronutrients have been shown to contribute to depressed immune function and increased susceptibility to infections. We aimed to explore the relation of dietary factors with global infection and mortality rates of COVID-19 in this study. DESIGN: In the current ecological study, the countries that had national dietary data from the Global Dietary Databases of the United Nations and Coronavirus disease statistics from the World Health Organization (WHO) were included. The countries that had Coronavirus disease statistics from the WHO were consecutively checked for the recent data of the dietary factors. SETTING: World. PARTICIPANTS: 158 countries across the world. MEASUREMENTS: infection and mortality rates of COVID-19; dietary factors. RESULTS: The median crude infection and mortality rates by COVID-19 were 87.78 (IQR: 468.03) and 0.0015 (IQR: 0.0059), respectively. The two highest percentage of the crude infection rate were between 0 and 500 (75.9%) and 500–1000 (8.9%) per one million persons. The regression analysis showed that the crude infection rate has been increased by raising consuming fruits (Beta: 0.237; P=0.006) and calcium (Beta: 0.286; P=0.007) and was decreased with rising consuming beans and legumes (Beta: −0.145; P=0.038). The analysis showed that the crude mortality rate was increased by raising consuming sugar-sweetened beverages (Beta: 0.340; P<0.001). Whereas, the crude mortality rate by COVID-19 has been decreased by increasing fruits consuming (Beta: −0.226; P=0.047) and beans and legumes (Beta: −0.176; P=0.046). CONCLUSION: The present study showed the higher intake of fruits and sugar-sweetened beverages had a positive effect on infection and mortally rates by COVID-19, respectively. In contrast, the higher intake of beans and legumes had a negative effect on both increasing infection and mortality rates.","Abdulah, Deldar Morad; Hassan, A. B.",J Nutr Health Aging,551,1

CadF protein of Campylobacter jejuni is one of the important factors in the pathogenesis of this bacterium. The purpose of this work was to perform a bioinformatics study to identify an epitope-based CadF vaccine, as a subunit vaccine. Full protein sequences of CadF were extracted from the NCBI and UniProt databases and subjected to in silico evaluations, including sequence analysis, allergenicity, antigenicity, epitope conservancy, and molecular docking assessments done by different servers. RESULTS: The results showed that CadF was a highly conserved protein belonging to the outer member proteins superfamily. Among the evaluated epitopes, LSDSLALRL was identified as an antigenic and non-allergenic peptide with a suitable structure for vaccine development. It was also able to stimulate both T and B cells. This 9-mer peptide was located in 136–144 segment of CadF protein and interacted with both HLA-A 0101 and HLA-DRB1 0101 alleles. Overall, the obtained theoretical results showed that CadF protein could be used for designing and evaluating a new effective vaccine against C. jejuni.","Moballegh Naseri, Mona; Shams, Saeed; Moballegh Naseri, Mohammad; Bakhshi, Bita",BMC Res Notes,551,16

While society has been affected by this virus, it has also been documented in the mainstream news that this pandemic has disproportionately affected non-white minority groups, and that access to testing for vulnerable populations have been limited. Similarly, previously published epidemiological data by Zuvekas et al. show that populations with health insurance, higher socioeconomic class, and white in race have received significantly better access to private health care resources. As veterans represent a vulnerable population, as part of quality assurance, testing data was reviewed to verify that this trend was not also affecting the VAMC. METHODS: As part of a quality assurance/quality improvement project, a retrospective manual review of all SARS-CoV- 2 RT-PCR tests performed at the VAMC from March 11th, 2020 to April 13th, 2020. These tests were reviewed within the computerized medical record system to determine the age, gender, and ethnicity of the patients. The demographic data from this search was compared with the population statistics of the major metropolitan city that the VAMC is located in. RESULTS: Out of 571 patients who were tested for SARS-CoV-2, 264 (46%) had an ethnic African-Americans background, 135 (24%) had an ethnic Caucasian or white background, 8 had an ethnic Hispanic background, 3 had an ethnic native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander background, 2 had an ethnic Asian background (0.4%), and 1 had an ethnic American Indian or Alaskan Native background. The rest had left ethnicity unanswered or was unknown/declined to state. The majority of those tested were males (392 or 69%). Ages of patients tested ranged from 24 to 98 years of age. The ethnic distribution of those tested was like the ethnic distribution within the city where the VAMC was located. CONCLUSION: Quality healthcare to the entire population also means that healthcare should be accessible to all members who require it. The VAMC offers broad access for testing to all its patients of all ethnicities. This demonstrates, in the changing healthcare landscape, one of the many advantages of the Veteran Affairs system.","Petersen, J M; Dalal, S; Jhala, D",Am J Clin Pathol,551,16

The literature on diaphragm function assessment during the weaning process in the intriguing subpopulation of critically ill neuromuscular disease patients is lacking. METHODS: Patients with neuromuscular diseases, on mechanical ventilation for more than 7 days, and who were ready for weaning were studied. During multiple T-piece trials over days, diaphragm function using ultrasound and diaphragm electrical activity (Edi peaks using NAVA catheter) was measured every 30 min till a successful 2 h weaning. RESULTS: A total of 18 patients were screened for eligibility over 5-month period and eight patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Sixty-three data points in these 8 subjects were available for analysis. A successful breathing trial was predicted by Edi reduction (1.22 μV for every 30 min increase in weaning duration; 0.69 μV for every day of weaning) and increase in diaphragm excursion (2.81 mm for every 30 min increase in weaning duration; 2.18 mm for every day of weaning). CONCLUSION: The Edi and diaphragm excursion changes can be used as additional objective tools in the decision-making of the weaning trials in neuromuscular disease.

The aim was to establish a model with linear, associative, and predictive relations, to identify needs and make proposals for therapeutic intervention in different student profiles. A population of 1,126 undergraduate students with different student profiles gave their informed, written consent, and completed validated questionnaires (CD-RISC Scale; Positivity; Coping Strategies of Stress; Engagement, and Burnout). An ex post-facto design involved bivariate association analyses, multiple regression and structural predictions. The results offered evidence of associations and predictive relationships between resilience factors, positivity, coping strategies and engagement-burnout. The factors of resilience and positivity had significant differential associations (positive and negative) with factors of coping strategies. Their negative relationship to burnout factors, and positive relation to engagement factors, is especially important. Results of structural analysis showed an acceptable model of relationships between variables.

Most centrally, it is utterly perplexing that no single argument is mounted in the report to wave aside accusations that it depicts a totalitarian world governed by a digipsy‐complex. As it seems to presage the COVID crisis in its assertion that digital mental health care will and should be the future, this paper takes the pandemic as its point of departure. However, it does not set out not from the apparent digitalisation of psy‐care under COVID‐conditions, but rather, from the psychologisation of the COVID crisis itself; that is, individualising and pathologising the discontents and socio‐subjective sufferings under COVID. The aim is to tackle from here the intertwining of the psychological and the digital, of psychologisation and digitalisation. This article engages in a close ‘symptomatic reading’ of the report and makes two points. The first concerns how digitalisation as such is closely connected to the neurobiologisation of subjectivity. The second point is about how digitalisation is also closely connected to the commodification of all things subjective and social.

Several studies have demonstrated different associations between human behaviour and numerous genetic variants. In particular, allelic variants in SLC6A4, MAOA, DRD4, and DRD2 showed statistical associations with major depressive disorder, antisocial behaviour, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder; BDNF polymorphic variants were associated with depressive, bipolar, and schizophrenia diseases, and TPH2 variants were found both in people with unipolar depression and in children with attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Independent studies have failed to confirm polymorphic variants associated with criminal and aggressive behaviour. In the present study, a set of genetic variants involved in serotoninergic, dopaminergic, and neurobiological pathways were selected from those previously associated with criminal behaviour. The distribution of these genetic variants was compared across worldwide populations. While data on single polymorphic variants showed differential distribution across populations, these differences failed to be significant when a comprehensive analysis was conducted on the total number of published variants. The lack of reproducibility of the genetic association data published to date, the weakness of statistical associations, the heterogeneity of the phenotype, and the massive influence of the environment on human behaviour do not allow us to consider these genetic variants as undoubtedly associated with antisocial behaviour. Moreover, these data confirm the absence of ethnic predisposition to aggressive and criminal behaviour.","Zampatti, Stefania; Ragazzo, Michele; Fabrizio, Carlo; Termine, Andrea; Campoli, Giulia; Caputo, Valerio; Strafella, Claudia; Cascella, Raffaella; Caltagirone, Carlo; Giardina, Emiliano",J Pers Med,551,1

However, it is important to note that telemedicine has not yet proven a reduction in time and effort for medical staff and impact on personnel costs.","von Sengbusch, Simone; Frielitz, Fabian S.; Braune, Katarina; Boss, Karina; Raile, Klemens",Diabetologe,551,29

There are many forms of leukemia, and the best course of therapy and the chance of a patient’s survival depend on the type of leukemic disease. Different forms of drugs have been used to treat leukemia. Due to the adverse effects associated with such therapies and drug resistance, the search for safer and more effective drugs remains one of the most challenging areas of research. Thus, new therapeutic approaches are important to improving outcomes. Almost half of the drugs utilized nowadays in treating cancer are from natural products and their derivatives. Medicinal plants have proven to be an effective natural source of anti-leukemic drugs. The cytotoxicity and the mechanisms underlying the toxicity of these plants to leukemic cells and their isolated compounds were investigated. Effort has been made throughout this comprehensive review to highlight the recent developments and milestones achieved in leukemia therapies using plant-derived compounds and the crude extracts from various medicinal plants. Furthermore, the mechanisms of action of these plants are discussed.","Maher, Tahani; Ahmad Raus, Raha; Daddiouaissa, Djabir; Ahmad, Farah; Adzhar, Noor Suhana; Latif, Elda Surhaida; Abdulhafiz, Ferid; Mohammed, Arifullah",Molecules,551,1

It has also been used as the first-line treatment in patients with nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC), through repeated intravesical applications. Numerous studies have shown that BCG induces off-target immune effects in various pathologies. Accumulating data argue for the critical role of the immune system in the course of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD). In this study, we tested whether repeated exposure to BCG during the treatment of NMIBC is associated with the risk of developing AD and PD. We presented a multi-center retrospective cohort study with patient data collected between 2000 and 2019 that included 12,185 bladder cancer (BC) patients, of which 2301 BCG-treated patients met all inclusion criteria, with a follow-up of 3.5 to 7 years. We considered the diagnosis date of AD and nonvascular dementia cases for BC patients. The BC patients were partitioned into those who underwent a transurethral resection of the bladder tumor followed by BCG therapy, and a disjoint group that had not received such treatment. By applying Cox proportional hazards (PH) regression and competing for risk analyses, we found that BCG treatment was associated with a significantly reduced risk of developing AD, especially in the population aged 75 years or older. The older population (≥75 years, 1578 BCG treated, and 5147 controls) showed a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.726 (95% CI: 0.529–0.996; p-value = 0.0473). While in a hospital-based cohort, BCG treatment resulted in an HR of 0.416 (95% CI: 0.203–0.853; p-value = 0.017), indicating a 58% lower risk of developing AD. The risk of developing PD showed the same trend with a 28% reduction in BCG-treated patients, while no BCG beneficial effect was observed for other age-related events such as Type 2 diabetes (T2D) and stroke. We attributed BCG’s beneficial effect on neurodegenerative diseases to a possible activation of long-term nonspecific immune effects. We proposed a prospective study in elderly people for testing intradermic BCG inoculation as a potential protective agent against AD and PD.","Klinger, Danielle; Hill, Brian L.; Barda, Noam; Halperin, Eran; Gofrit, Ofer N.; Greenblatt, Charles L.; Rappoport, Nadav; Linial, Michal; Bercovier, Hervé",Vaccines (Basel),551,3

Most of the recently launched financial inclusion initiatives in Egypt, especially those aligned with the 2030 sustainability strategy, have targeted marginalized and excluded individuals. Only a few have addressed the financial inclusion of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Accordingly, this paper aims to identify the main pillars of financial inclusion for SMEs. In keeping up with the mainstream literature, it introduces a number of financial inclusion determinants designed to attract SMEs. They include supply-side determinants such as access to financial services and marketing awareness campaigns, which act as tools to segment financial services and market their benefits to SMEs, and demand-side determinants, which involve the use of financial services. Finally, there is an assessment of the macroeconomic risks to investors and SMEs. The researchers’ methodology was based on first deriving a novel dataset from responses to a questionnaire addressing bankers who manage SME portfolios, second analyzing the dataset through descriptive and inferential statistics and third undertaking a twofold econometric estimation. The econometric estimations started with principal component analysis (PCA) and proceeded to a logistic regression to determine the significant variables pertinent to increasing the financial inclusion of SMEs. The PCA suggested three main pillars determining financial inclusion. They are integrated marketing tools, which increase SMEs’ awareness of and access to the most sophisticated banking services, usage of banking services, and assessment of the macroeconomic risks that would prevent SMEs from gaining access to financial services. As well, the interaction term between the variables derived from the three pillars accounts for a variability of 86.6% in the level of financial inclusion of Egypt’s SMEs.","ElDeeb, Mohamed Samy; Halim, Yasser Tawfik; Kamel, Esmat Mostafa",Futur Bus J,551,16

The answer they propose is that a 21st-century approach to the politics of care must aim at unmaking racial capitalism, cisheteropatriarchy, the carceral state, and the colonial present. The politics of care is an approach to political thought and action that moves beyond the liberal approach which situates care as a finite resource to be distributed among autonomous individuals, or as a necessarily feminine virtue. Instead, those elucidating the politics of care for the contemporary era draw on rich interdisciplinary traditions and social movements to theorize and practice care as an inherently interdependent survival strategy, a foundation for political organizing, and a prefigurative politics for building a world in which all people can live and thrive.","Woodly, Deva; Brown, Rachel H.; Marin, Mara; Threadcraft, Shatema; Harris, Christopher Paul; Syedullah, Jasmine; Ticktin, Miriam",Contemp Polit Theory,551,32

The intracellular cycle of the bacterium Francisella tularensis is characterized by rapid phagosomal escape followed by extensive proliferation in the macrophage cytoplasm. Cytosolic replication, but not phagosomal escape, requires the locus FTT0369c, which encodes the dipA gene (deficient in intracellular replication A). Here, we show that a replication-deficient, ∆dipA mutant of the prototypical SchuS4 strain is eventually captured from the cytosol of murine and human macrophages into double-membrane vacuoles displaying the late endosomal marker, LAMP1, and the autophagy-associated protein, LC3, coinciding with a reduction in viable intracellular bacteria. Capture of SchuS4ΔdipA was not dipA-specific as other replication-deficient bacteria, such as chloramphenicol-treated SchuS4 and a purine auxotroph mutant SchuS4ΔpurMCD, were similarly targeted to autophagic vacuoles. Vacuoles containing replication-deficient bacteria were labeled with ubiquitin and the autophagy receptors SQSTM1/p62 and NBR1, and their formation was decreased in macrophages from either ATG5-, LC3B- or SQSTM1-deficient mice, indicating recognition by the ubiquitin-SQSTM1-LC3 pathway. While a fraction of both the wild-type and the replication-impaired strains were ubiquitinated and recruited SQSTM1, only the replication-defective strains progressed to autophagic capture, suggesting that wild-type Francisella interferes with the autophagic cascade. Survival of replication-deficient strains was not restored in autophagy-deficient macrophages, as these bacteria died in the cytosol prior to autophagic capture. Collectively, our results demonstrate that replication-impaired strains of Francisella are cleared by autophagy, while replication-competent bacteria seem to interfere with autophagic recognition, therefore ensuring survival and proliferation.","Chong, Audrey; Wehrly, Tara D; Child, Robert; Hansen, Bryan; Hwang, Seungmin; Virgin, Herbert W; Celli, Jean",Autophagy,551,1

PATIENTS AND METHODS The neurointerventional database of our institution was retrospectively reviewed from June 2010 to February 2013. Patients who underwent endovascular treatment of fusiform intracranial vertebral artery aneurysms using reconstructive techniques were included in the analysis. Clinical presentation, size, reconstructive technique used, procedural complication, and clinical and angiographic follow-ups were included in the analysis. RESULTS Nine patients, aged 41-76 years (mean 54.8 years), were included. Mean angiographic diameter of unruptured aneurysms was 8.4 mm (range 4-14) while ruptured aneurysms averaged 6 mm (range 5-7 ). Two patients (two women) presented with acute subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). One patient with a large partially thrombosed aneurysm was treated with stent reconstruction requiring deployment of two stents (no coiling). There was one asymptomatic procedural complication (non-flow limiting cervical vertebral dissection). All patients had good clinical outcomes (modified Rankin Scale score of 0 or ≤1) including the two patients that presented with SAH (Hunt and Hess grades 2 and 3). There were no late hemorrhages at a mean clinical follow-up of 12 months (6-24 months). Eight patients had angiographic follow-up (6-18 months, mean 10.5 months) and six demonstrated aneurysm occlusion with complete vessel reconstruction at the angiographic follow-up. CONCLUSIONS The use of reconstructive techniques in the endovascular treatment of unruptured fusiform intracranial vertebral artery aneurysms is feasible, safe, and effective in the mid term. In patients presenting with SAH, however, the safety and effectiveness of these techniques remain unclear.","Dabus, Guilherme; Lin, Eugene; Linfante, Italo",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,551,23

Examining specific infectious exposures would be useful in describing their current trends as well as guidance with appropriate protective measures an emergency medical services (EMS) system should consider. OBJECTIVE To describe the types of infectious occupational health exposures and associated outcomes reported at an urban EMS system. METHODS A retrospective review of all reported exposures was performed for a three-year period from January 1, 2007, to December 31, 2009. Descriptive analysis was performed on data such as provider demographics, types of exposures reported, confirmation of exposure based on patient follow-up information, and outcomes. RESULTS Three hundred ninety-seven exposure reports were filed with the designated infection control officer (ICO), resulting in an overall exposure rate of 1.2 per 1,000 EMS incidents. The most common exposure was to possible meningitis (n = 131, 32.9%), followed by tuberculosis (TB) (n = 68, 17.1%), viral respiratory infections (VRIs) such as influenza or H1N1 (n = 61, 15.4%), and body fluid splashes to skin or mucous membranes (n = 56, 14.1%). Body fluid splashes involving the eyes accounted for 41 cases (10.3%). Only six cases (1.5%) of needlestick injuries were reported. Three hundred thirty-two of all cases (83.6%) were considered true exposures to an infectious hazard, of which 177 (53.3%) were actually confirmed. Half of all exposures required only follow-up with the ICO (52.6%). One hundred twenty-seven cases (31.9%) required follow-up at a designated occupational health services or emergency department. Of these, only 23 cases (18.1%) required treatment. There was a significant trend of increasing incidence of VRI exposures from 2008 to 2009 (6.3% vs. 26.8%, p < 0.001), while a significant decrease in TB exposures was experienced during the same year (22.9% vs. 8.2%, p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS Trends in our data suggest increasing exposures to viral respiratory illnesses, whereas exposures to needlestick injuries were relatively infrequent. Efforts should continue to focus on proper respiratory protection to include eye protection in order to mitigate these exposure risks.","El Sayed, Mazen; Kue, Ricky; McNeil, Claire; Dyer, K Sophia",Prehospital emergency care : official journal of the National Association of EMS Physicians and the National Association of State EMS Directors,551,24

METHODS Between 2002 and 2011, a total of 398 metastases were ablated in 122 patients (87 male, median age 68 years, range 29-90 years) at 256 procedures. Percutaneous CT-guided cool-tip radiofrequency ablation was performed under sedation/general anesthesia. Maximum tumor size, number of tumors ablated, number of procedures, concurrent/prior liver ablation, previous liver or lung resection, systemic chemotherapy, disease-free interval from primary resection to lung metastasis, and survival from first ablation were recorded prospectively. Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed, and factors were compared by log rank test. RESULTS The initial number of metastases ablated was 2.3 (range 1-8); the total number was 3.3 (range 1-15). The maximum tumor diameter was 1.7 (range 0.5-4) cm, and the number of procedures was 2 (range 1-10). The major complication rate was 3.9 %. Overall median and 3-year survival rate were 41 months and 57 %. Survival was better in patients with smaller tumors-a median of 51 months, with 3-year survival of 64 % for tumors 2 cm or smaller versus 31 months and 44 % for tumors 2.1-4 cm (p = 0.08). The number of metastases ablated and whether the tumors were unilateral or bilateral did not affect survival. The presence of treated liver metastases, systemic chemotherapy, or prior lung resection did not affect survival. CONCLUSION Three-year survival of 57 % in patients with inoperable colorectal lung metastases is better than would be expected with chemotherapy alone. Patients with inoperable but small-volume colorectal lung metastases should be referred for ablation.","Gillams, Alice; Khan, Zahid; Osborn, Peter; Lees, William",Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,551,19

Whereas in the late eighties there were only a couple of different devices available, today we have to choose among some hundreds, with lots of minor and major variations in polymer and structure. As most of the minor variations may not lead to significant change in clinical outcome and may be regarded as less relevant, we should focus on major differences. Eventually, this is used to structure the world of mesh by forming groups of textile devices with distinct biological response. Many experimental and some clinical studies have underlined the outstanding importance of porosity, which fortunately, in contrast to other biomechanical quanlities, is widely unaffected by the anisotropy of meshes. METHODS In accordance with the major manufacturers of meshes, a classification of meshes was derived from a huge pool of textile data based briefly on the following: (1) large pores, (2) small pores, (3) additional features, (4) no pores, (5) 3D structure and (6) biological origin. At 1,000 explanted meshes the value of this classification was evaluated by group-specific assessment of inflammatory and connective tissue reaction. RESULTS Application of this classification to common products has proved feasable, and each of the six different classes includes devices that in clinical trials failed to show relevant differences in patients' outcome when comparing products within the same group. Furthermore, histological analysis confirmed significant differences in tissue reactions between but not within the different classes. CONCLUSIONS Classifying implants according to a similar response enables grouping patients into comparable cohorts despite implantation of different devices. Furthermore, it enables the examination of the impact of mesh classes for the various indications even from heterogenous data of registries. Finally and not the least, any grouping supports the surgeon to select the best device to meet the individual need and to tailor patients therapy.","Klinge, U; Klosterhalfen, B",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,551,16

To meet these challenges we recommend that AL providers incorporate digital technology to maintain family-resident communication. We also recommend that states adopt protocols that limit the number of AL communities visited by home health care workers in a 14-day period, appeal to the federal government for hazard pay for direct care workers, and to extend the personal care attendant program to AL. It is further recommended that states work with AL communities to implement COVID-19 comprehensive emergency management plans that are well-coordinated with local emergency operation centers to assist with transfers to COVID-19 specific locations and to assist in rural areas with hospital transfers. Together, these recommendations to AL providers and state and federal agencies address the unique structure and needs of AL and would enable AL communities to be better prepared to care for and reduce those infected with COVID-19.","Dobbs, Debra; Peterson, Lindsay; Hyer, Kathryn",Journal of aging & social policy,551,1

Hence, the purpose of this study was to examine the association between neighborhood SED, weight status, and fat mass in a diverse sample of youth, before and after controlling for physical activity and diet. (2) Methods: The sample included 828 youth from the Transitions and Activity Changes in Kids study. Neighborhood SED was expressed as an index score at the census tract of residence. Height, weight, and body composition were measured and used to calculate fat mass index (FMI) and weight status. Moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and sedentary behavior (min/h) were measured via accelerometry. Diet quality was assessed via the Block Food Screener for Kids. Multilevel regression models were employed to examine these relationships. (3) Results: Neighborhood SED was significantly associated with FMI and weight status before and after controlling for MVPA, sedentary behavior, and diet. Notably, youth residing in the most deprived neighborhoods had significantly higher FMI and were 30% more likely to be overweight/obese (OR = 1.30; 95% CI = 1.03-1.65). (4) Conclusions: Greater neighborhood SED was consistently and significantly associated with higher fat mass index and increased likelihood of overweight/obesity among youth.","Clennin, Morgan; Brown, Asia; Lian, Min; Dowda, Marsha; Colabianchi, Natalie; Pate, Russell R",International journal of environmental research and public health,551,33

Over time, the senior author (P.G.C.) has developed modifications in his technique for oncologic midface reconstruction to minimize complications and maximize outcomes. METHODS Over a 15-year period (1992 to 2006), 100 flaps for midface oncologic reconstruction were performed at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. The first 50 flaps were performed from 1992 to 2000, and the second 50 flaps were performed from 2001 to 2006. Over time, technical improvements were made in the following areas: palate, dental implants and prosthesis, orbital floor, eyelid, nasal sidewall, lips, cranial base and dura, and pedicle anastomosis. Using a prospectively maintained database, the authors compared the functional and aesthetic outcomes of the first 50 flaps and the second 50 flaps. RESULTS Improvements in palatal reconstruction increased the proportion of patients who achieved normal speech from 38.9 percent in the first half of the series (1992 to 2000) to 50 percent in the second half of the series (2001 to 2006). The percentage of patients who were able to tolerate an unrestricted diet increased from 44.4 to 52 percent. The use of new methods to reconstruct the orbital floor also lowered the ectropion rate from 71.4 to 47.6 percent. The percentage of patients whose aesthetic results were judged as ""excellent"" increased from 12 to 58.6 percent. CONCLUSIONS Over the last 15 years, the senior author has refined methods of midface reconstruction that have improved functional and aesthetic outcomes.

To determine whether a worker is at risk of suffering some type of pathology, observation techniques are usually used by qualified technical personnel. In order to define from quantitative data if there is a risk of suffering a pathology due to movements and repetitive efforts in the upper limb, a prototype of a movement measurement system has been designed and manufactured. This system interferes minimally with the activity studied, maintaining a reduced cost of manufacture and use. The system allows the study of the movements made by the subject in the work environment by determining the origin of the Musculoskeletal Disorder (MSD) from the movements of the elbow and wrist, collecting data on the position and accelerations of the arm, forearm and hand, and taking into account the risk factors established for suffering from an MSD: high repetition of movements, the use of a high force in a repetitive manner, or the adoption of forced positions. The data obtained with this system can be analyzed by qualified personnel from tables, graphs, and 3D animations at the time of execution, or stored for later analysis.","Parras-Burgos, Dolores; Gea-Martínez, Alfonso; Roca-Nieto, Lucas; Fernández-Pacheco, Daniel G; Cañavate, Francisco J F",Sensors,551,1

Heavy and regular alcohol consumption has been positively correlated with increasing body weight, although it is unclear whether this is due to alcohol consumption per se or to additional energy intake from food. This review explores the effects of alcohol consumption on food energy intake in healthy adults. CINAHL Plus, EMBASE, Medline and PsycINFO were searched through February 2018 for crossover and randomised controlled trials where an alcohol dose was compared with a non-alcohol condition. Study quality was assessed using the Effective Public Health Practice Project tool. A total of twenty-two studies involving 701 participants were included from the 18 427 papers retrieved. Studies consistently demonstrated no compensation for alcoholic beverage energy intake, with dietary energy intake not decreasing due to alcoholic beverage ingestion. Meta-analyses using the random-effects model were conducted on twelve studies and demonstrated that alcoholic beverage consumption significantly increased food energy intake and total energy intake compared with a non-alcoholic comparator by weighted mean differences of 343 (95 % CI 161, 525) and 1072 (95 % CI 820, 1323) kJ, respectively. Generalisability is limited to younger adults (18-37 years), and meta-analyses for some outcomes had substantial statistical heterogeneity or evidence of small-study effects. This review suggests that adults do not compensate appropriately for alcohol energy by eating less, and a relatively modest alcohol dose may lead to an increase in food consumption.","Kwok, Alastair; Dordevic, Aimee L; Paton, Gemma; Page, Matthew J; Truby, Helen",The British journal of nutrition,551,7

They were followed up two months later through telephone, and a total of 322 participants were interviewed (excluding 63 non-responders and five deceased) regarding the persistence of disturbances in sleep through a structured questionnaire. Patient demographic, clinical, and epidemiological data including history regarding in-hospital sleep disturbance were retrieved from hospital treatment sheets.

ACP is a dynamic communication process involving patients, families and healthcare providers, which serves to discuss and document wishes and goals for future care. Currently, ACP practice is often suboptimal. This implies that important decisions about care and treatment may need to be made acutely in crises. Many factors contribute to suboptimal ACP practice. One such factor is ambiguity regarding roles and responsibilities of different disciplines in the ACP-process. The perception that having ACP conversations is primarily a physician's task is a misconception. Specific skills that could contribute to a holistic and person-centered ACP-process are largely lacking in nursing curricula and therefore, may be insufficient and under-utilized. For instance, nursing staff could involve persons in conversations about meaning, quality of life, loss and grief as a part of ACP. Moreover, they may communicate a patient's wishes to other healthcare providers including physicians. Acknowledgement of this potential role, by physicians as well as by nursing staff themselves, is needed for ACP to become a truly interprofessional process.","Bolt, Sascha R; van der Steen, J T; Schols, Jos M G A; Zwakhalen, Sandra M G; Janssen, D J A; Meijers, J M M",Tijdschrift voor gerontologie en geriatrie,551,1

Norway implemented extensive COVID-19 measures, such as school closures and lockdowns, whereas Sweden did not. Aims: To compare mortality in Norway and Sweden, two similar countries with very different mitigation measures against COVID-19. Methods: Using real-world data from national registries, we compared all-cause and COVID-19-related mortality rates with 95% confidence intervals (CI) per 100,000 person-weeks and mortality rate ratios (MRR) comparing the five preceding years (2015-2019) with the pandemic year (2020) in Norway and Sweden. Results: In Norway, all-cause mortality was stable from 2015 to 2019 (mortality rate 14.6-15.1 per 100,000 person-weeks; mean mortality rate 14.9) and was lower in 2020 than from 2015 to 2019 (mortality rate 14.4; MRR 0.97; 95% CI 0.96-0.98). In Sweden, all-cause mortality was stable from 2015 to 2018 (mortality rate 17.0-17.8; mean mortality rate 17.1) and similar to that in 2020 (mortality rate 17.6), but lower in 2019 (mortality rate 16.2). Compared with the years 2015-2019, all-cause mortality in the pandemic year was 3% higher due to the lower rate in 2019 (MRR 1.03; 95% CI 1.02-1.04). Excess mortality was confined to people aged ⩾70 years in Sweden compared with previous years. The COVID-19-associated mortality rates per 100,000 person-weeks during the first wave of the pandemic were 0.3 in Norway and 2.9 in Sweden. Conclusions: All-cause mortality in 2020 decreased in Norway and increased in Sweden compared with previous years. The observed excess deaths in Sweden during the pandemic may, in part, be explained by mortality displacement due to the low all-cause mortality in the previous year.","Juul, Frederik E; Jodal, Henriette C; Barua, Ishita; Refsum, Erle; Olsvik, Ørjan; Helsingen, Lise M; Løberg, Magnus; Bretthauer, Michael; Kalager, Mette; Emilsson, Louise",Scandinavian journal of public health,551,24

The poultry industry uses Salmonella prevalence as an indicator of food safety. However, Salmonella prevalence is only one of several factors that determine risk of salmonellosis. Consequently, a model for predicting risk of salmonellosis from individual lots of ground turkey as a function of Salmonella prevalence and other risk factors was developed. Data for Salmonella contamination (prevalence, number, and serotype) of ground turkey were collected at meal preparation. Scenario analysis was used to evaluate effects of model variables on risk of salmonellosis. Epidemiological data were used to simulate Salmonella serotype virulence in a dose-response model that was based on human outbreak and feeding trial data. Salmonella prevalence was 26% (n = 100) per 25 g of ground turkey, whereas Salmonella number ranged from 0 to 1.603 with a median of 0.185 log per 25 g. Risk of salmonellosis (total arbitrary units (AU) per lot) was affected (p ≤ 0.05) by Salmonella prevalence, number, and virulence, by incidence and extent of undercooking, and by food consumption behavior and host resistance but was not (p > 0.05) affected by serving size, serving size distribution, or total bacterial load of ground turkey when all other risk factors were held constant. When other risk factors were not held constant, Salmonella prevalence was not correlated (r = -0.39; p = 0.21) with risk of salmonellosis. Thus, Salmonella prevalence alone was not a good indicator of poultry food safety because other factors were found to alter risk of salmonellosis. In conclusion, a more holistic approach to poultry food safety, such as the process risk model developed in the present study, is needed to better protect public health from foodborne pathogens like Salmonella.","Oscar, Thomas",Risk analysis : an official publication of the Society for Risk Analysis,551,12

Despite high importance of macrophytes in shallow permafrost thaw lakes for control of major and trace nutrients in lake water, the trace element (TE) partitioning between macrophytes and lake water and sediments in the permafrost regions remains virtually unknown. Here we sampled dominant macrophytes in thermokarst lakes of discontinuous and continuous permafrost zones in the Western Siberia Lowland (WSL) and measured major and trace elements in plant biomass, lake water, lake sediments and sediment porewater. All six plant species (Hippuris vulgaris L., Glyceria maxima (Hartm.) Holmb., Comarum palustre L., Ranunculus spitzbergensis Hadac, Carex aquatilis Wahlenb s. str., Menyanthes trifoliata L.) sizably accumulated macronutrients (Na, Mg, Ca), micronutrients (B, Mo, Nu, Cu, Zn, Co) and toxicants (As, Cd). Accumulation of other trace elements, including rare earth elements (REE), in macrophytes relative to pore waters and sediments was highly variable among species. Using miltiparametric statistics, we described the behavior of ТЕ across two permafrost zones and identified several group of elements depending on their sources in the lake ecosystems and their affinity to sediments and macrophytes. Under future climate warming and shifting the permafrost border to the north, we anticipate an increasing uptake of heavy metals and lithogenic low mobile elements such as Ti, Al, Cr, As, Cu, Fe, Ni, Ga, Zr, and REEs by macrophytes in the discontinuous permafrost zone and Ba, Zn, Pb and Cd in the continuous permafrost zone. This may eventually diminish transport of metal micronutrients and geochemical tracers from soils to lakes and rivers and further to the Arctic Ocean.","Manasypov, Rinat M; Pokrovsky, Oleg S; Shirokova, Liudmila S; Auda, Yves; Zinner, Nadezhda S; Vorobyev, Sergey N; Kirpotin, Sergey N",The Science of the total environment,551,1

Cownose rays had a significantly shorter time to spiral colon filling and complete gastric emptying compared with bamboo sharks (P < 0.05). Whitespotted bamboo sharks (n = 8) were administered metoclopramide (0.4 mg/kg orally once daily for 10 days) and the barium series was repeated. Complete gastric emptying time was significantly shorter in treated sharks compared with control (P < 0.05), suggesting that metoclopramide may be a useful therapeutic for GI motility disorders in elasmobranchs.","Joblon, Melissa J; Flower, Jennifer E; Thompson, Laura A; Bray, Rebecca L; Tuttle, Allison D",Journal of zoo and wildlife medicine : official publication of the American Association of Zoo Veterinarians,551,1

In the context of a changing food and health policy environment, we undertook a systematic review (PROSPERO registration number: CRD42020177174) and a meta-analysis of the prevalence of adult hypertension, and its awareness and control in Ghana. METHODS We searched major databases including PubMed, Embase as well as Google Scholar and online digital collections of public universities of Ghana to locate relevant published and unpublished community-based articles up till April 2020. FINDINGS Eighty-five articles involving 82,045 apparently-healthy subjects aged 15-100 years were analyzed. In individual studies, the prevalence of hypertension, defined in most cases as blood pressure ≥ 140/90 mmHg, ranged from 2.8% to 67.5%. The pooled prevalence from the meta-analysis was 27.0% (95% CI 24.0%-30.0%), being twice as high in the coastal (28%, 95% CI: 24.0%-31.0%) and middle geo-ecological belts (29%, 95% CI: 25.0%-33.0%) as in the northern belt (13%, 95% CI: 7.0%-21.0%). The prevalence was similar by sex, urban-rural residence or peer-review status of the included studies. It did not appear to vary over the study year period 1976-2019. Of the subjects with hypertension, only 35% (95% CI: 29.0%-41.0%) were aware of it, 22% (95% CI: 16.0%-29.0%) were on treatment and 6.0% (95% CI: 3.0%-10.0%) had their blood pressure controlled. Sensitivity analyses corroborated the robust estimates. There was, however, high heterogeneity (I2 = 98.7%) across the studies which was partly explained by prevalent obesity in the subjects. CONCLUSION More than one in four adults in Ghana have hypertension. This high prevalence has persisted for decades and is similar in rural and urban populations. With the low awareness and poor control of hypertension, greater investments in cardiovascular health are required if Ghana is to meet the global target for hypertension.","Bosu, William Kofi; Bosu, Dary Kojo",PloS one,551,1

METHODS Twenty prospective patients with primary breast cancer due for NAC underwent volumetric helical perfusion CT to derive whole tumour regional blood flow (BF), blood volume (BV) and flow extraction product (FE) by deconvolution analysis. A pCR was achieved if no residual invasive cancer was detectable on pathological examination. Relationships between baseline BF, BV, FE, tumour size and volume, and pCR were examined using the Mann-Whitney U test. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to assess the parameter best able to predict response. Intra- and inter-observer variability was assessed using Bland-Altman statistics. RESULTS Seventeen out of 20 patients completed NAC with four achieving a pCR. Baseline BF and FE were higher in patients who achieved a pCR compared with those who did not (P = 0.032); tumour size and volume were not significantly different (P > 0.05). ROC analysis revealed that BF and FE were able to identify responders effectively (AUC = 0.87; P = 0.03). There was good intra- and inter-observer agreement. CONCLUSIONS Primary breast cancers which exhibited higher levels of perfusion before treatment were more likely to achieve a pCR to NAC.","Li, Sonia P; Makris, Andreas; Gogbashian, Andrew; Simcock, Ian C; Stirling, J James; Goh, Vicky",European radiology,551,19

METHODS This cross-sectional study was conducted May 5-25, 2020, among 347 hospital staff (nursing and other hospital staff, with the exception of doctors). Depression, anxiety, and insomnia were measured using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire, the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale, and the Insomnia Severity Index, respectively. RESULTS Of respondents, 16.4% reported clinically significant depression, 13.8% reported clinically significant anxiety, and 13.3% reported insomnia. Among the nursing staff, 20.9% reported clinically significant depression, 15.9% reported clinically significant anxiety, and 17.0% reported insomnia. There was significantly higher depression (P = .000), anxiety (P = .002), and insomnia (P = .007) among nursing staff compared with other hospital staff in 2-tailed t tests. There was a significantly higher prevalence of insomnia among females (χ2 = 5.85, df = 2, P = .05). CONCLUSIONS Study results show that more than 1 in 10 hospital staff suffer from mental health conditions, even during the beginning of the pandemic, and there is a need for active psychiatric support for the hospital staff during this pandemic. Depression, anxiety, and insomnia are significantly higher among nurses compared to other hospital staff. The results of this research suggest that comprehensive support measures should be implemented to protect and maintain mental health of hospital staff, especially nurses, while fighting the COVID-19 pandemic.","Uvais, N A; Nalakath, Mohammed Jezeel; Jose, Kurian",The primary care companion for CNS disorders,551,16

However, traditional adjuvants have some limitations, such as lack of controllability and induction of systemic toxicity, which restrict their broad application. Here, we present a light-activable immunological adjuvant (LIA), which is composed of a hypoxia-responsive amphiphilic dendrimer nanoparticle loaded with chlorin e6. Under irradiation with near-infrared light, the LIA not only induces tumour cell lysis and tumour antigen release, but also promotes the structural transformation of 2-nitroimidazole containing dendrimer to 2-aminoimidazole containing dendrimer which can activate dendritic cells via the Toll-like receptor 7-mediated signaling pathway. The LIA efficiently inhibits both primary and abscopal tumour growth and induces strong antigen-specific immune memory effect to prevent tumour metastasis and recurrence in vivo. Furthermore, LIA localizes the immunological adjuvant effect at the tumour site. We demonstrate this light-activable immunological adjuvant offers a safe and potent platform for in situ cancer vaccination.","Wang, Yongchao; Gong, Ningqiang; Ma, Chi; Zhang, Yuxuan; Tan, Hong; Qing, Guangchao; Zhang, Jimei; Wang, Yufei; Wang, Jinjin; Chen, Shizhu; Li, Xianlei; Ni, Qiankun; Yuan, Yuan; Gan, Yaling; Chen, Junge; Li, Fangzhou; Zhang, Jinchao; Ou, Caiwen; Zhao, Yongxiang; Liu, Xiaoxuan; Liang, Xing-Jie",Nature communications,551,1

This systematic review focuses on sedentary behaviour resulting from this quarantine period which may elevate the cardiovascular disease risk, obesity, hypertension, cancer and mental health illness. METHODS Evidence of breaking sedentary behaviour and global recommendations were investigated. Potential unanswered questions regarding sedentary behaviour and physical activity during lockdown were explored. RESULTS Five systematic reviews and six prospective trials explored the effect of sedentarism affecting chronic disease through potential pathophysiological mechanisms. Sedentary behaviour especially prolonged sitting is found to be a pleiotropic risk factor with altered energy expenditure, adipogenic signalling, immunomodulation, autonomic stability and hormonal dysregulation perpetuating underlying chronic diseases such as obesity, cardiovascular disease, cancer and mental health disorders.

Innovative technologies have the potential to address the challenges associated with the manufacture of personalized drug delivery systems, biosensors, and medical devices during a pandemic. 3D-Printing, microfluidics, and Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) can provide an important part on this fight, as are cheap, easy to be operated, capable to provide rapid detection and monitoring of a disease, and deliver medicines. AREAS COVERED This manuscript answers the question of how these emerging technologies can save lives during a pandemic by avoiding supply chain delays and also by providing rapid diagnostics, disease monitoring, or by offering personalized treatments. The manuscript covers recent approaches in the topic with a focus in manuscripts published in the last year and by emphasising recent regulatory considerations by regulatory agencies in the manufacturing of 3DP systems or other medical devices during COVID. EXPERT OPINION New manufacturing techniques are emerging with the ability to address the challenges associated with the development of medical devices or diagnostics, during a pandemic.

A midwife's practice can be influenced by education and cultural practices but ultimately it should be informed by up-to-date scientific evidence. We conducted a systematic review of the literature to retrieve evidence that supports high quality intrapartum care during the second stage of labour. A systematic literature search was performed to September 2019 in collaboration with a medical information specialist. Bibliographic databases searched included: PubMed, EMBASE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), PsycINFO, Maternity and Infant Care Database and The Cochrane Library, resulting in 6,382 references to be screened after duplicates were removed. Articles were then assessed for quality by two independent researchers and data extracted. 17 studies focusing on midwives' practices during physiological second stage of labour were included. Two studies surveyed midwives regarding their practice and one study utilising focus groups explored how midwives facilitate women's birthing positions, while another focus group study explored expert midwives' views of their practice of preserving an intact perineum during physiological birth. The remainder of the included studies were primarily intervention studies, highlighting aspects of midwifery practice during the second stage of labour. The empirical findings were synthesised into four main themes namely: birthing positions, non-pharmacological pain relief, pushing techniques and optimising perineal outcomes; the results were outlined and discussed. By implementing this evidence midwives may enable women during the second stage of labour to optimise physiological processes to give birth. There is, however, a dearth of evidence relating to midwives' practice, which provides a positive experience for women during the second stage of labour. Perhaps this is because not all midwives' practices during the second stage of labour are researched and documented. This systematic review provides a valuable insight of the empirical evidence relating to midwifery practice during the physiological second stage of labour, which can also inform education and future research. The majority of the authors were members of the EU COST Action IS1405: Building Intrapartum Research Through Health (BIRTH).

As these therapies lose patent protection, biosimilar versions of the originator products are being developed, such as the infliximab biosimilar CT-P13; however, some uncertainty exists regarding their pharmacology in IBD. AIM To review the literature on anti-TNF biosimilars focusing on pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamic properties and comparative effectiveness, related to their use in IBD. METHODS A PubMed literature search was performed using the following terms individually or in combination: 'biosimilars,' 'CT-P13,' 'Crohn's disease,' 'inflammatory bowel disease,' 'ulcerative colitis,' 'anti-TNFα therapy,' 'infliximab,' 'adalimumab,' 'pharmacokinetics,' 'immunogenicity.' RESULTS Bioequivalence of CT-P13 and infliximab was shown in ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and therapeutic equivalence in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Preliminary results of CT-P13 in IBD come from small post-marketing registries and case series with a relatively short-term follow-up period and suggest comparable efficacy and safety to infliximab. Inter- and intra-individual differences in exposure and response are well known for the original molecules but dosing regimens and concomitant medications are different for RA compared to IBD, limiting the ability to translate some of the pharmacology data in RA to IBD. Uncertainty exists about cross-reactivity of anti-drug antibodies and whether similar exposure-response relationships will be observed for biosimilars and efficacy thresholds for therapeutic drug monitoring can be used interchangeably. CONCLUSIONS It is likely that biosimilars will be widely used for the treatment of IBD due to their cost savings and comparable efficacy. Nevertheless, robust post-marketing studies and pharmacovigilance are warranted in the coming years.","Papamichael, K; Van Stappen, T; Jairath, V; Gecse, K; Khanna, R; D'Haens, G; Vermeire, S; Gils, A; Feagan, B G; Levesque, B G; Vande Casteele, N",Alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics,551,33

Standardized criteria of the structural valve deterioration (SVD) and bioprosthetic valve failure (BVF) have recently been defined. Limited studies have evaluated the long-term durability of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) according to these new definitions. We aim to analyze the durability of TAVI beyond 5 years and to report the frequency of SVD and BVF. METHODS A total of 89 patients who had undergone TAVI and had theoretically completed at least 5 years after the procedure were included. Either a Medtronic CoreValve or an Edwards SAPIEN XT valve were implanted in the patients. New standardized definitions were used to evaluate SVD and BVF. RESULTS The mean age of the patients was 78.70±6.95 years. SVD occured in 4 (4.5%) patients during 6 years of follow-up. Severe SVD was observed in 2 patients (2.2%), and these patients had the New York Heart Association class II symptoms. Both patients with severe SVD also met the criteria of BVF. Moderate SVD was observed in 2 patients (2.2%), and these patients had no valve-related symptoms. Of the 4 SVD cases, 2 were associated with increased mean transaortic gradients, whereas the remaining 2 cases were associated with intraprosthetic aortic regurgitation. All patients with SVD are still alive, and none of them have required aortic valve reintervention. CONCLUSION Although first-generation TAVI devices were used, we determined the low rate of SVD and BVF at the 6-year follow-up. It may be suggested that there is no major concern associated with TAVI even with first-generation devices regarding long-term durability.","Şentürk, Bihter; Dursun, Hüseyin; Çöllüoğlu, Tuğçe; Özdamar, Hatice; Ekin, Tuba; Tanrıverdi, Zülkif; Kaya, Dayimi",Anatolian journal of cardiology,551,23

METHODS Complication rates observed during the first week after surgery were compared between groups with and without use of classic nasal packing over a large sample of 534 patients, who had undergone either a closed or open procedure, with bilateral turbinoplasty, and with or without osteotomies. Complications listed include epistaxis, haematoma, impetiginization, septal perforation, hyperalgesia, and dyspnoea. RESULTS No significant difference was observed between the group with and without packing regarding the immediate post-operative complications of epistaxis (4.4% of the cases with nasal packing versus 3% without, p = 0.918) and impetiginization (3% of the cases with nasal packing versus 4.2% without, p = 0.478). The technique used, as well as any osteotomies performed, had no impact on the results. CONCLUSION Non-use of nasal packing after a (rhino)septoplasty is a safe alternative to classic post-operative methods. Provided that there is a rigorous surgical technique and strict clinical control, it should be used as a principal technique in any routine practice due to its safety for patients immediately post-surgery.","Seghers, Nancy; Ledeghen, Stéphane; Collet, Stéphanie; Degols, Jean-Christophe",European archives of oto-rhino-laryngology : official journal of the European Federation of Oto-Rhino-Laryngological Societies (EUFOS) : affiliated with the German Society for Oto-Rhino-Laryngology - Head and Neck Surgery,551,1

Nonetheless, acute abdominal surgical emergencies are major causes for nontrauma-related hospital admissions and their incidences were expected to remain unchanged. Surprisingly, a significant decrease in volume and a higher proportion of complicated cases are being observed worldwide. METHODS The present study assesses the local impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the emergency presentation of acute appendicitis in a Brazilian hospital. A retrospective analysis was conducted on patients undergoing emergency surgery for the clinically suspected diagnosis of acute appendicitis during the 2-month period of March and April 2020 and the same time interval in the previous year. Data on demographics, timing of symptom onset and hospital presentation, intraoperative details, postoperative complications, hospital length of stay, and histological examination of the specimen were retrieved from individual registries. RESULTS The number of appendectomies during the pandemic was 36, which represents a 56% reduction compared to the 82 patients operated during the same period in 2019. The average time of symptom onset to hospital arrival was significantly higher in 2020 (40.6 vs. 28.2 hours, P = .02). The classification of appendicitis revealed a significant higher proportion of complicated cases than the previous year (33.3% vs. 15.2%, P = .04). The rate of postoperative complications and the average length of stay were not statistically different between the groups.

There is increasing interest in developing complement regulatory and inhibitory agents to treat complement dysfunction. In this study, we describe the nanobody hC3Nb3, which is specific for the C-terminal C345c domain of human and mouse complement component C3/C3b/C3c and potently inhibits C3 cleavage by the alternative pathway. A high-resolution structure of the hC3Nb3-C345c complex explains how the nanobody blocks proconvertase assembly. Surprisingly, although the nanobody does not affect classical pathway-mediated C3 cleavage, hC3Nb3 inhibits classical pathway-driven hemolysis, suggesting that the C-terminal domain of C3b has an important function in classical pathway C5 convertase activity. The hC3Nb3 nanobody binds C3 with low nanomolar affinity in an SDS-resistant complex, and the nanobody is demonstrated to be a powerful reagent for C3 detection in immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry. Overall, the hC3Nb3 nanobody represents a potent inhibitor of both the alternative pathway and the terminal pathway, with possible applications in complement research, diagnostics, and therapeutics.","Pedersen, Henrik; Jensen, Rasmus K; Jensen, Jens Magnus B; Fox, Rachel; Pedersen, Dennis V; Olesen, Heidi G; Hansen, Annette G; Christiansen, Dorte; Mazarakis, Sofia M M; Lojek, Neal; Hansen, Pernille; Gadeberg, Trine A F; Zarantonello, Alessandra; Laursen, Nick S; Mollnes, Tom Eirik; Johnson, Matthew B; Stevens, Beth; Thiel, Steffen; Andersen, Gregers R",Journal of immunology,551,19

Therefore, our study investigated seven heavy metal-contaminated mangroves (Beihai, Fangchenggang, Hainan, Hongkong, Shenzhen, Yunxiao, and Zhanjiang) in southern China, and found that they were particularly polluted with Zn and Pb. These heavy metals were mainly distributed in the surface sediments of the mangroves. Among these seven mangroves, the Shenzhen mangrove was the most polluted site, whereas the Beihai mangrove was the least polluted. Moreover, the bacterial communities in the mangroves were significantly associated with heavy metal contamination. For instance, Fusibacter was significantly correlated with Pb, Zn, Cu, Co, Ni, Cd, and Ag (P < 0.05, R = -0.47). Syntrophorhabdus was also significantly correlated with heavy metals (P < 0.05, R = 0.63). Furthermore, Geo-Chip analyses were conducted to demonstrate the involvement of many functional genes in heavy metal transport, particularly Ni transport. Our results also demonstrated that the heavy metals could be transported by various bacteria. For example, Pseudomonas and Burkholderia were involved in various heavy metal transportation mechanisms, particularly for Ni and Zn, suggesting that these bacteria could be used for heavy metal remediation. Therefore, our study provides insights into the interactions between bacterial communities and heavy metals, which could enable the development of novel mangrove protection strategies.","Meng, Shanshan; Peng, Tao; Pratush, Amit; Huang, Tongwang; Hu, Zhong",Marine pollution bulletin,551,1

The mechanisms of resistance to unrelated drugs share many common features, including up-regulation of detoxifying pathways, activation of pro-survival mechanisms, and ineffective induction of cell death. Oncolytic viruses (OVs) are promising biotherapeutics for cancer treatment that specifically replicate in and lyse cancer cells. In addition to direct viral lysis, the anti-tumor effects of OVs are mediated via innate and adaptive immune responses, and several adaptation mechanisms such as autophagy appear to contribute to their anti-tumor properties. Autophagy is a versatile pathway that plays a key role in cancer survival during stressful conditions such as starvation or cytotoxic drug challenges. Autophagy also plays a role in mediating innate and adaptive immune responses by contributing to antigen presentation and cytokine secretion. This role of autophagy in regulation of immune responses can be utilized to design therapeutic combinations using approaches that either stimulate or block autophagy to potentiate therapeutic efficacy of OVs. Additional studies are needed to determine optimal multimodal combination approaches that will facilitate future successful clinical implementation of OV-based therapies.","Beljanski, Vladimir; Chiang, Cindy; Hiscott, John",Biological chemistry,551,33

However, how a single gene integrates both ROS and SA pathways remains poorly understood. Here, we show that Arabidopsis WRKY55 transcription factor positively regulates ROS and SA accumulation and thus leaf senescence and resistance against the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae WRKY55 is predominantly expressed in senescent leaves and encodes a transcriptional activator localized to nuclei. Both inducible and constitutive overexpression of WRKY55 accelerates leaf senescence, while mutants delay it. A transcriptomic sequencing identified 1,448 differentially expressed gens (DEGs), of which 1,157 genes are up-regulated by WRKY55 expression. Accordingly, the ROS and SA contents in WRKY55-overexpression plants are higher than that in the control, while mutants showed a contrast change. Moreover, WRKY55 positively regulates defense against Pseudomonas syringae Finally we show that WRKY55 activates the expression of RbohD, ICS1, PBS3 and SAG13 through directly binding to the W-box-containing fragments. Taken together, our work has identified a novel WRKY transcription factor that integrates both ROS and SA pathways to regulate leaf senescence and pathogen resistance.","Wang, Yiqiao; Cui, Xing; Yang, Bo; Xu, Shutao; Wei, Xiangyan; Zhao, Peiyu; Niu, Fangfang; Sun, Mengting; Wang, Chen; Cheng, Hao; Jiang, Yuan-Qing",Development,551,1

A cautionary tale in advanced diagnostics.,16.368767,5.321268,2020-07-25,"BACKGROUND Central pancreatectomy is a definitive treatment for low-grade tumors of the pancreatic neck that preserves pancreatic and splenic function at the potential expense of postoperative pancreatic fistula. We analyzed outcomes after robot-assisted central pancreatectomy (RACP) to reexamine the risk-benefit profile in the era of minimally invasive surgery. METHODS Retrospective analysis of nine RACP performed between August 2009 through June 2010 at a single institution. RESULTS The average age of the cohort was 64 (range 18-75 years) with six women (67 %). Indications for surgery included: five benign cystic neoplasm and four pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor. Median operative time was 425 min (range 305-506 min) with 190 ml median blood loss (range 50-350 ml) and one conversion to open due to poor visualization. Median tumor size was 3.0 cm (range 1.9-6.0 cm); all patients achieved R0 status. Pancreaticogastrostomy was performed in seven cases and pancreaticojejunostomy in two. The median length of hospital stay was 10 days (range 7-19). Two clinically significant pancreatic fistulae occurred with one requiring percutaneous drainage. No patients exhibited worsening diabetes or exocrine insufficiency at the 30-day postoperative visit. CONCLUSIONS RACP can be performed with safety and oncologic outcomes equivalent to published open series. Although the rate of pancreatic fistula was high, only 22 % had clinically significant events, and none developed worsening pancreatic endocrine or exocrine dysfunction.","Abood, Gerard J; Can, M Fatih; Daouadi, Mustapha; Huss, Harold T; Steve, Jennifer Y; Ramalingam, Lekshmi; Stang, Michael; Bartlett, David L; Zeh, Herbert J; Moser, A James",Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract,551,1

The purpose of this review is to discuss the most recent and significant advances regarding self-management interventions in pediatric asthma. RECENT FINDINGS Recent evidence supports school-based programs including asthma self-management skills for children to significantly improve asthma control. A defined theoretical intervention framework, parent involvement, child satisfaction, and running the intervention outside the child's own free time are suggested drivers of successful implementation. Real-time telemedically delivered asthma education may also improve asthma-related outcomes in children. Moreover, mobile applications supporting self-management are generally welcomed by children and parents. Current evidence supports the use of models of health behaviors change in mobile application design and content development; self-monitoring alone is ineffective but useful when coupled with decision support for proactive care. SUMMARY School-based and e-health interventions are potential facilitators for the implementation of successful self-management asthma programs, providing access to large numbers of children with asthma. This supports the healthcare practitioners to work together with researchers to promote these interventions, while following current recommendations for the effective transition of children into competent and confident adults to continue to successfully self-manage their asthma.","Pité, Helena; Carvalho, Sara; Morais-Almeida, Mário",Current opinion in allergy and clinical immunology,551,27

Patients can be asymptomatic or present respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms, and even multiple-organ failure which can lead to death. The balance between an effective antiviral response and dysregulated immune response is the key factor determining the severity of COVID-19 progression. A systematic review was performed using the NCBI-PubMed database to find the articles related to COVID-19 immunity and inflammatory response published from 1 December 2019 to 15 April 2020. Haematological, immunological and biochemical parameters were extracted and correlated with disease severity, age and presence of comorbidities. Twelve articles were analysed comprising a total of 1042 hospitalized patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and 95 different parameters. Total lymphocyte count and levels of CD3+ and CD4+ T cells were decreased in severe and critical cases. Neutrophilia was found in patients who progressed to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Interleukin-six (IL-6) was high in mild and severe patients regardless of comorbidities. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and count and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were increased regardless of disease severity or presence of comorbidities. High levels of D-dimer and lactate dehydrogenase were present in diabetic patients and patients who developed ARDS. Procalcitonin levels were elevated to varying degrees in severe and critical patients. We conclude that the total lymphocyte count, CD3+ and CD4+ T cells are low, especially in severe and critical COVID-19 patients; ESR, CRP and IL-6 were elevated, independent of the severity of disease. Understanding the inflammatory response of COVID-19 patients is essential for the development of better therapeutic and management strategies.","Iwamura, Ana Paula D; Tavares da Silva, Marielen R; Hümmelgen, Ana Luísa; Soeiro Pereira, Paulo V; Falcai, Angela; Grumach, Anete Sevciovic; Goudouris, Ekaterini; Neto, Antônio Condino; Prando, Carolina",Reviews in medical virology,551,1

It is intended to inform national and global accreditation standards, planning and action at the institutional level as well as highlight the role of individuals in transforming health professions education. Many countries have agreed to 'rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes' to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 45% within 10 years and achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, including in healthcare. Currently, however, health professions graduates are not prepared for their roles in achieving these changes. Thus, to reduce emissions and meet the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), health professions education must equip undergraduates, and those already qualified, with the knowledge, skills, values, competence and confidence they need to sustainably promote the health, human rights and well-being of current and future generations, while protecting the health of the planet. The current imperative for action on environmental issues such as climate change requires health professionals to mobilize politically as they have before, becoming strong advocates for major environmental, social and economic change. A truly ethical relationship with people and the planet that we inhabit so precariously, and to guarantee a future for the generations which follow, demands nothing less of all health professionals. This Consensus Statement outlines the changes required in health professions education, approaches to achieve these changes and a timeline for action linked to the internationally agreed SDGs. It represents the collective vision of health professionals, educators and students from various health professions, geographic locations and cultures. 'Consensus' implies broad agreement amongst all individuals engaged in discussion on a specific issue, which in this instance, is agreement by all signatories of this Statement developed under the auspices of the Association for Medical Education in Europe (AMEE). To ensure a shared understanding and to accurately convey information, we outline key terms in a glossary which accompanies this Consensus Statement (Supplementary Appendix 1). We acknowledge, however, that terms evolve and that different terms resonate variably depending on factors such as setting and audience. We define education for sustainable healthcare as the process of equipping current and future health professionals with the knowledge, values, confidence and capacity to provide environmentally sustainable services through health professions education. We define a health professional as a person who has gained a professional qualification for work in the health system, whether in healthcare delivery, public health or a management or supporting role and education as 'the system comprising structures, curricula, faculty and activities contributing to a learning process'. This Statement is relevant to the full continuum of training - from undergraduate to postgraduate and continuing professional development.","Shaw, Emily; Walpole, Sarah; McLean, Michelle; Alvarez-Nieto, Carmen; Barna, Stefi; Bazin, Kate; Behrens, Georgia; Chase, Hannah; Duane, Brett; El Omrani, Omnia; Elf, Marie; Faerron Guzmán, Carlos A; Falceto de Barros, Enrique; Gibbs, Trevor J; Groome, Jonny; Hackett, Finola; Harden, Jeni; Hothersall, Eleanor J; Hourihane, Maca; Huss, Norma May; Ikiugu, Moses; Joury, Easter; Leedham-Green, Kathleen; MacKenzie-Shalders, Kristin; Madden, Diana Lynne; McKimm, Judy; Nayna Schwerdtle, Patricia; Peters, Sarah; Redvers, Nicole; Sheffield, Perry; Singleton, Judith; Tun, SanYuMay; Woollard, Robert",Medical teacher,551,1

The identification of the mechanisms driving lineage conversion represents a crucial step toward the development of new and more efficient regenerative strategies. To this aim, here we show that pre-treatment with the Bmi1 inhibitor PTC-209 is sufficient to increase the efficiency of Chemical-induced Direct Cardiac Reprogramming both in mouse embryonic fibroblasts and adult cardiac fibroblasts. PTC-209 induces an overall increase of spontaneously beating iCM at end-stage of reprogramming, expressing high levels of late cardiac markers Troponin T and myosin muscle light chain-2v. The inhibition of Bmi1 expression occurring upon PTC-209 pre-treatment was maintained throughout the reprogramming protocol, contributing to a significant gene expression de-regulation. RNA profiling revealed that, upon Bmi1 inhibition a significant down-regulation of genes associated with immune and inflammatory signalling pathways occurred, with repression of different genes involved in interleukin, cytokine and chemokine pathways. Accordingly, we observed the down-regulation of both JAK/STAT3 and MAPK/ERK1-2 pathway activation, highlighting the crucial role of these pathways as a barrier for cardiac reprogramming. These findings have significant implications for the development of new cardiac regenerative therapies.","Testa, Gianluca; Russo, Michele; Di Benedetto, Giorgia; Barbato, Matteo; Parisi, Silvia; Pirozzi, Flora; Tocchetti, Carlo Gabriele; Abete, Pasquale; Bonaduce, Domenico; Russo, Tommaso; Passaro, Fabiana",Scientific reports,551,24

Despite the frequency of laparoscopic appendectomy, consensus does not exist on the best way to perform each procedural step. We identified literature on key intraoperative steps to inform best technical practice during laparoscopic appendectomy. Methods Research questions were framed using the population, indication, comparison, outcome (PICO) format for 6 key operative steps of laparoscopic appendectomy: abdominal entry, placement of laparoscopic ports, division of mesoappendix, division of appendix, removal of appendix, and fascial closure. These questions were used to build literature queries in PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library databases. Evidence quality and certainty was assessed using Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) definitions. Results Recommendations were rendered for 6 PICO questions based on 28 full length articles. Low quality evidence favors direct trocar insertion for abdominal entry and establishment of pneumoperitoneum. Single port appendectomy results in improved cosmesis with unclear clinical implications. There was insufficient data to determine the optimal method of appendiceal stump closure, but use of a specimen extraction bag reduces rates of superficial surgical site infection and intra-abdominal abscess. Port sites made with radially dilating trocars are less likely to necessitate closure and are less likely to result in port site hernia. When port sites are closed, a closure device should be used. Conclusion Key operative steps of laparoscopic appendectomy have sufficient data to encourage standardized practice.","Bessoff, Kovi E; Choi, Jeff; Wolff, Christopher J; Kashikar, Aditi; Carlos, Garrison M; Caddell, Luke; Khan, Rida I; Stave, Christopher D; Spain, David A; Forrester, Joseph D",Surgery open science,551,5

Epidemiological evidence suggests sleep duration in both children and adults has been decreasing over the past half-century, while at the same time rates of overweight and obesity have been increasing. Short sleep duration along with other dimensions of poor sleep has been associated with obesity both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. These data suggest a potential causal relationship between poor sleep and greater rates of weight gain that may be related to effects of sleep on dietary intake or physical activity. However, there is also potential for reverse causation as obesity leads to many co-morbidities including sleep apnea that can disrupt sleep.

Several immunogenic regions, mainly located within the S1 subunit, have been identified. Nonetheless, these immune-dominant regions were defined using selected monoclonal antibodies or using a short peptide approach that involves only certain limited regions of the S protein. In addition, some immune-dominant regions are located in hypervariable regions (HVRs) which are not present in all serotypes. Hence, the aim of this study was to determine a broader range of antigenic regions that have strong antibody eliciting ability; these could then be applied for development of an IBV-diagnostic tool. Initially, the S1 and part of the S2 subunit protein (24-567 amino acids) were expressed as five fragments in prokaryotic system. The antigenicity was confirmed using IBV immunized sera. Performance of the S subfragments was evaluated by ELISA using a panel of field chicken sera with known IBV titres determined by a commercial kit. This indicated that, among the five antigenic recombinant proteins, the region S-E showed the highest specificity and sensitivity, namely 95.38 % and 96.29 %, respectively. The κ value for the in-house ELISA using the S-E fragment compared to a commercial kit was 0.9172, indicating a high agreement between these two methods.

While these studies can expedite the drug approval process, researchers must carefully design and analyze such studies in order to perform rigorous science that is reproducible and credible. This article focuses on several key design and analysis considerations that can improve the scientific rigor of non-randomized studies of off-label drugs. Areas covered The aim of this article is to provide an overview of best approaches that should be considered for non-randomized studies on off-label drugs. In this article, we discuss these approaches in detail and use a non-randomized study by Rivera et al. in Cancer Discovery, which analyzed factors associated with off-label treatments for COVID-19 and their potential impact on 30-day all-cause mortality among cancer and SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, as an example of methods that have been undertaken for COVID-19. Expert Opinion While non-randomized studies are inherently biased, they may be unavoidable in situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic, where researchers need to find an effective treatment quickly. We believe that a well-formed experimental design, high quality data collection, and a well-thought-out statistical and data analysis plan are sufficient to produce rigorous and credible results for making an optimal decision.","Shyr, Derek; Shyr, Yu",Expert opinion on investigational drugs,551,1

Bowel preparation prior to VCE may improve visualization, transit time, and diagnostic yield. We aimed to evaluate the ""real-life"" experience comparing two different preparation protocols in patients undergoing SB VCE. METHODS We performed a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data from SB VCE procedures, performed in two tertiary care medical centers in Israel. VCE procedures performed at ""Sheba Medical Center"" used a 2-L polyethylene glycol (PEG) bowel preparation (n=360) while VCEs performed at ""Rambam Health Care campus"" used a clear liquid diet plus 12-h fast protocol (n=500). A dichotomous preparation scale (adequate, inadequate) was used to classify cleansing quality. Data collection included patient and procedural details. The proportion of VCE procedures with adequate bowel preparation and the overall positive SB findings in the two different bowel preparation protocols were evaluated. RESULTS SB completion rates were higher in the PEG protocol (96% vs. 83%, P<0.001) and SB passage time was significantly faster in the PEG protocol (mean 217±73 vs. 238±77 min, P<0.001). Bowel preparation quality was similar between groups (8% vs. 7% inadequate preparation, P=0.591).

Our previous evaluation of Canadian centers helped to identify several weaknesses in disaster responsiveness. In this analysis, we determined the current state of MCI readiness across Canada and how this has changed over time. A multinational cross-sectional survey-based study on MCI preparedness was performed, including 24 Canadian trauma centers. Surveys were completed anonymously online by representatives of each facility. Responses from Canadian centers were examined and compared to previous findings to assess temporal changes in institutional capacity. Fifteen (63%) trauma centers responded, 100% of which had a disaster committee. Sixty percent had a single all-hazards emergency plan, and 71% performed a practice drill in the last two years. Sixty-two percent had communications systems designed to function during an MCI. Ninety-two percent had a triage system in place, and 54% of centers could monitor surge capacity. Half (54%) reported back-up systems for survival essentials, but the capability for prolonged operation during a disaster was limited. A minority (15%) had a database denoting staff with emergency training, although half (54%) had disaster training programs. Comparison to past data showed an increased prevalence of committees dedicated to disaster preparedness and disaster drills but worsened external stakeholder representation and poor ability to provide a prolonged response to crises. Our results demonstrate that MCI preparedness is a growing focus of Canadian trauma centers, but that there are deficiencies that remain unaddressed. Future efforts should focus on these vulnerabilities to ensure the provision of a robust disaster response.

We review a single-center experience with EVAR explants to identify patterns of presentation and understand operative outcomes that may alter clinical management. METHODS A retrospective analysis of EVARs requiring late explants, >1 month after implant, was performed. Patient demographics, type of graft, duration of implant, reason for removal, operative technique, length of stay, complications, and in-hospital and late mortality were reviewed. RESULTS During 1999 to 2012, 100 patients (91% men) required EVAR explant, of which 61 were placed at another institution. The average age was 75 years (range, 50-93 years). The median length of time since implantation was 41 months (range, 1-144 months). Explanted grafts included 25 AneuRx (Medtronic, Minneapolis, Minn), 25 Excluder (W. L. Gore & Associates, Flagstaff, Ariz), 17 Zenith (Cook Medical, Bloomington, Ind), 15 Talent (Medtronic), 10 Ancure (Guidant, Indianapolis, Ind), 4 Powerlink (Endologix, Irvine, Calif), 1 Endurant (Medtronic), 1 Quantum LP (Cordis, Miami Lakes, Fla), 1 Aorta Uni Iliac Rupture Graft (Cook Medical, Bloomington, Ind), and 1 homemade tube graft. Overall 30-day mortality was 17%, with an elective case mortality of 9.9%, nonelective case mortality of 37%, and 56% mortality for ruptures. Endoleak was the most common indication for explant, with one or more endoleaks present in 82% (type I, 40%; II, 30%; III, 22%; endotension, 6%; multiple, 16%). Other reasons for explant included infection (13%), acute thrombosis (4%), and claudication (1%). In the first 12 months, 23 patients required explants, with type I endoleak (48%) and infection (35%) the most frequent indication. Conversely, 22 patients required explants after 5 years, with type I (36%) and type III (32%) endoleak responsible for most indications. CONCLUSIONS The rate of EVAR late explants has increased during the past decade at our institution. Survival is higher when the explant is done electively compared with emergent repair. Difficulty in obtaining a seal at the initial EVAR often leads to failure ≤1 year, whereas progression of aneurysmal disease is the primary reason for failure >5 years.","Turney, Eric J; Steenberge, Sean P; Lyden, Sean P; Eagleton, Matthew J; Srivastava, Sunita D; Sarac, Timur P; Kelso, Rebecca L; Clair, Daniel G",Journal of vascular surgery,551,1

Twelve months after surgery, the increase in range of active finger motion after adding active flexion was insignificant compared with that with the modified Kleinert regime. According to the Strickland criteria, 20 out of 29 fingers had excellent or good recovery after adding active flexion, as did 28 out of 34 fingers with the modified Kleinert regime; we could not detect significant improvement of the good and excellent rate. At 6 months, the pinch strength was significantly higher with the addition of active flexion.

We identified and assessed 78 patients who underwent 2- and 3-dimensional echocardiography-guided mini-invasive per-atrial closure of pmVSD in the cardiac surgery department of our institution, from February 2016 to August 2018, and 76 patients who underwent transcatheter closure of VSD guided by fluoroscopy at the pediatric department (percutaneous control group). All the patients underwent echocardiography. Their clinical data were retrospectively reviewed and analyzed. All patients were followed up using transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) for a maximum of 24 months after the closure. All patients underwent successful device implantation. Echocardiography showed that the major immediate complications included residual shunt, pericardial effusion, and tricuspid regurgitation in the per-atrial group. During the mid-term follow-up period, TTE revealed that the most common complication was tricuspid regurgitation (non-preexisting). There were no cases of VSD recurrence, device displacement, valvular injury, malignant arrhythmias, hemolysis, or death. Moreover, according to the TTE data, the intracardiac structure of the patients were improved. Compared to the control group, the intracardiac manipulation time was shorter and the number of patients with residual shunts, redeployment of devices, or immediate new tricuspid regurgitations was fewer when using 2- and 3-dimensional echocardiography. However, the procedure time in the per-atrial group was slightly longer than that in the control group. Two- and 3-dimensional echocardiography are feasible monitoring tools during mini-invasive per-atrial VSD closure. The short- and mid-term follow-up showed satisfactory results compared to fluoroscopy.","Guo, Zhenwei; Zhang, Shuo; Zhu, Mei; Jiang, Xin; Guo, Wenbin; Feng, Juan; Liang, Decai; Liang, Hao; Wang, Ximing",The international journal of cardiovascular imaging,551,1

A high level of IL-33 and its soluble decoy receptor sST2 in the acute phase of systemic vasculitis has been demonstrated. Methods The serum level of IL-33 and sST2 in 50 TAO patients, 20 age- and smoking habit-matched controls and 19 age-matched non-smoker controls was evaluated. Results The mean level of IL-33 in TAO, smokers and non-smokers was 370.2±61.7ng/mL,132.14±2.6ng/mL and 11.3±0.38ng/mL, respectively. The IL-33 was significantly higher in the TAO than in either control groups (p < 0.001). The IL-33 in the acute phase of TAO was significantly higher than in the patients in the quiescent phase of the disease (p = 0.019). Also, IL-33 in the patients with gangrene was significantly higher than in the patients with non-healing ulcers (p = 0.021). The sST2 in the TAO patients was 49.3±5.58ng/mL, and in smoker and non-smoker controls, it was 45.3±6.3ng/mL and 4.11±0.17ng/mL, respectively. No significant difference was found between the patients and smoker control groups (p = 0.87). The mean ratio of IL-33/sST2 was 27.89±10.44 in the TAO group and, in smokers and non-smokers, it was 2.85±0.48 and 2.84±0.14, respectively. A significantly high level of IL-33/sST2 ratio was observed in TAO patients in both the active and quiescent phases of the disease in comparison to both control groups (p<0.001). Conclusion The regulation pattern of IL-33/sST2 was different in TAO in comparison to autoimmune vasculitis.","Sharebiani, Hiva; Mohareri, Mehran; Mirhosseini, Ali; Fazeli, Bahare",Journal of inflammation research,551,20

Methods A total of 20 cases with consolidation-type pulmonary cryptococcosis confirmed by pathological examinations were studied.Each patient underwent breath-hold multislice spiral CT,and 10 patients underwent contrast enhanced CT.The data including lesion number,lesion distribution,lesion density,performance of enhanced CT scan,accompanying signs,and prognosis were analyzed. Results The occurrence rates of single and multiple lesions were 80.0%(n=16)and 20.0%(n=4),respectively.In all the 16 multiple-lesion patients,the occurrence rate of unilateral lobar distribution was 56.0%(n=9).The 76 measurable lesions mainly presented subpleural distribution(71.1%,n=54)and lower pulmonary distribution(75.0%,n=57).A total of 39 lesions were detected in the 10 patients received contrast enhanced CT,in which 31 lesions(79.5%)showed homogeneous enhancement,34 lesions(87.2%)showed moderate enhancement,and all the lesions manifested angiogram sign.Consolidation lesions were accompanied by many CT signs,of which air bronchogram sign had the occurrence rate of 63.2%(n=48),including types Ⅲ(n =37)and Ⅳ(n=11).Other signs included halo signs(43/76,56.6%),vacuoles or cavities(9/76,11.8%),pleural thickening(14/20,70.0%),and pleural effusion(2/20,10.0%).After treatment,the lesions of 7 patients were basically absorbed and eventually existed in the form of fibrosis. Conclusions The lesions in the immunocompetent patients with consolidation type of pulmonary cryptococcosis usually occur in the lower lobe and close to the pleura,mainly presenting unilateral distribution.The CT angiogram signs,proximal air bronchogram signs,and halo signs are the main features of this disease,which contribute to the diagnosis.","Lu, Xing Qi; Li, Yue Xing; Ding, Jian Ping; Deng, Kai Lin",Zhongguo yi xue ke xue yuan xue bao.

METHODS Study participants included 953 adult patients with type 2 diabetes enrolled in a diabetes education program between July 1, 2016, and June 30, 2017. Participants were asked to choose either a new technology-based diabetes education tool with a touch-screen device or a traditional face-to-face education method. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was applied to identify factors associated with adopting the computerized diabetes education tool among the patients. RESULTS When comparing technology-based tool adopters and nonadopters, several demographic and health-related factors differentiated technology use in bivariate analyses. The multivariate logistic regression model showed that Hispanic patients were less likely to choose a technology-based tool. Patients who perceived their health status as excellent/good were more likely to adopt the technologic education method than those with fair/poor perceived health status. A1C level was negatively associated with self-selection of technology. CONCLUSIONS Specific demographic and health-related characteristics are significant contributing factors to patients' adoption of a technology-based diabetes education tool. Health care providers can utilize these findings to target and refer specific patients to a computerized diabetes education tool for more effective diabetes care and to optimize technology adoption success.","Baek, Juha; Lin, Sherry; Bolin, Jane N; Ory, Marcia; Flores, Starr; Kash, Bita A",The science of diabetes self-management and care,551,31

Single-incision laparoscopic (SIL) resection is an alternative approach. However, there is limited experience with this modality in ovarian mass resection. METHODS We reviewed SIL ovarian mass resections performed by our group from 2010 to 2012. We evaluated patient demographics, surgery statistics, and hospital course. RESULTS Six patients were identified with mean age of 14 years. Imaging studies showed cystic masses ranging 4-6 cm in five patients, and 20 cm in one patient. One patient presented with recurrent teratoma. Pathology revealed four benign teratomas, one benign cyst, and one serous cystadenoma. Average operating time was 75 min. All patients had an ovarian-preserving resection. Three patients had cyst spillage, including the one who presented with recurrence (this was the only patient with a subsequent recurrence). Hospital stay averaged 37 h. Narcotic use averaged 9.9 mg of morphine daily. All patients had excellent cosmetic results, and no postoperative complications. CONCLUSIONS Ovarian cystic mass excision using the SIL approach carries a higher risk of tumor spillage. Although the incidence of malignancy is low, they cannot be conclusively excluded with our current preoperative evaluations. At this time, we recommend SIL resection only for simple cysts with low malignant potential; however, further experience with this procedure will likely improve the risk of tumor spillage in the future.","Pontarelli, Elizabeth M; Emami, Claudia; Nguyen, Nam X; Torres, Manuel; Anselmo, Dean M",Pediatric surgery international,551,1

We used data on the number notified cases accumulated per district by May 18, 2020. The spatial dependence of the spatially smoothed incidence rate was investigated through the analysis of univariate local spatial autocorrelation using Moran's I. To evaluate the spatial association between the INC_EBS and the determinants SAL, POP>60Y and SLUMS, we used the local bivariate Moran's I. The results showed that the spatially smoothed incidence rate for COVID-19 presented significant spatial autocorrelation (I = 0.333; P<0.05), indicating that the cases were concentrated in clusters of neighbouring districts. The INC_EBS showed a negative spatial association with SAL (I = -0.253, P<0.05) and POP>60Y (I = -0.398, P<0.05).

We aimed to assess the accuracy of API in locating infarct core within large vessel occlusion (LVO) acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients. Approach: Data were retrospectively collected for 25 LVO AIS patients who achieved successful recanalization. DSA data from lateral and anteroposterior (AP) views were loaded into API software to generate hemodynamic parameter maps. Relative differences in hemispherical regions for each API parameter were calculated. Ground truth infarct core locations were obtained using 24-h follow-up fluid-attenuation inversion recovery (FLAIR) MRI imaging. FLAIR MRI infarct locations were registered with DSA images to determine infarct regions in API parameter maps. Relative differences across hemispheres for each API parameter were plotted against each other. A support vector machine was used to determine the optimal hyperplane for classifying regions as infarct or healthy tissue. Results: For the lateral and AP views, respectively, the most accurate classification of infarct regions came from plotting mean transit time (MTT) versus peak height (PH) [ accuracy = 0.8125 ± 0.0012 (95%)], the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve ( AUROC ) = 0.8946 ± 0.0000 (95%), and plotting MTT versus the area under the curve (AUC) [ accuracy = 0.7957 ± 0.0011 (95%), AUROC = 0.8759 ± 0.0000 (95%)]. Conclusions: API provides accurate assessment of locating ischemic core in AIS LVO patients and has the potential for clinical benefit by determining infarct core location and growth in real time for intraoperative decision making.","Rava, Ryan A; Mokin, Maxim; Snyder, Kenneth V; Waqas, Muhammad; Siddiqui, Adnan H; Davies, Jason M; Levy, Elad I; Ionita, Ciprian N",Journal of medical imaging,551,17

Within these, 20 studies evaluated plantar tissue thickness, 19 studies evaluated plantar tissue stiffness, 9 studies evaluated Achilles tendon thickness and 5 studies evaluated Achilles tendon stiffness outcomes. No significant differences in plantar tissue thickness were found between people with and without diabetes in 55% of studies (11/20), while significantly increased plantar tissue stiffness was found in people with diabetes in 47% of studies (9/19). Significantly increased Achilles tendon thickness was found in people with diabetes in 44% of studies (4/9), while no significant differences in Achilles tendon stiffness were found between people with and without diabetes in 60% of studies (3/5). CONCLUSIONS This systematic review found some evidence of soft tissue structural differences between people with and without diabetes. However, uncertainty remains whether these differences independently contribute to diabetes-related foot ulcerations. The heterogeneity of methodological approaches made it difficult to compare across studies and methodological quality was generally inadequate. High-quality studies using standardised and validated assessment techniques in well-defined populations are required to determine more fully the role of structural tissue properties in the pathogenesis of diabetes-related foot ulcerations.","Khor, Benedictine Yen Chen; Woodburn, James; Newcombe, Lisa; Barn, Ruth",Journal of foot and ankle research,551,13

Information about the differences between COVID-19 patients with and without hypertension is limited. To explore the characteristics and outcomes differences between COVID-19 patients with and without hypertension, the medical records and cardiac biomarkers of 414 patients were analyzed. A total of 149 patients had a history of hypertension, while 265 patients did not have hypertension, and the groups were compared based on their clinical characteristics and laboratory findings as well as the hazard risk for composite outcomes, including intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation, or death. The results are as follows. On admission, 22.1% of patients in hypertension group had elevated high sensitivity troponin I (hs-TNI > 26 pg/mL), which was higher than the proportion in the nonhypertension group (6.4%). Median NT-proBNP levels in patients with hypertension (141.9 pg/mL) were higher than those in patients without hypertension (77.3 pg/mL). Patients in the hypertension group had a higher risk for in-hospital death [HR: 2.57, 95% CI (1.46~4.51)]. However, the impact of hypertension on the prognosis was not significant after adjusting for age and sex. Multivariate Cox hazard regression confirmed that NT-proBNP levels in the highest tertile (upper 75 % of patients with hypertension) was an independent risk factor for in-hospital death in all COVID-19 patients. Taken together, hypertension per se had a modest impact on the prognosis in COVID-19 patients. In COVID-19 patients with and without hypertension, NT-proBNP may be a better predictor of prognosis than hs-TNI.","Yao, Qi; Ni, Jian; Hu, Tong-Tong; Cai, Zhu-Lan; Zhao, Jin-Hua; Xie, Qing-Wen; Liu, Chen; Wu, Qing-Qing",Reviews in cardiovascular medicine,551,16

The aim was to evaluate work participation up to 10 years after colon or rectal cancer diagnosis compared between diagnosis and to a matched cancer-free population. METHODS In this national register-based cohort study, all first-time CRC patients in the period 2000-2015 with no previous cancer, between 20 and 60 years, were identified in the Danish Cancer Registry. A control group with no previous cancer was matched on gender, age, education, and income. For each year a mean Work Participation Score (WPS) was calculated (a percentage of weeks working) for individuals part of the labour market. RESULTS A total of 5625 colon cancer patients and 3856 rectal cancer patients and 25,341 and 17,256 matched controls were included in the study, respectively. The WPS increased for colon cancer patients from 45.69% after 1 year to 83.94% after 4 years, while rectal cancer patients had a score of 38.07% after 1 year and 80.07% after 4 years. The WPS was lower for cancer patients compared with controls, but the difference decreased after 4 years. CONCLUSION CRC patients had a lower work participation up to 10 years after diagnosis compared with controls, while rectal cancer patients had a lower participation the first 7 years after diagnosis compared with colon cancer patients. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS Work-related issues should be considered in the early stage of rehabilitation to increase work participation and thereby improve quality of life.","Pedersen, Pernille; Laurberg, Søren; Andersen, Niels Trolle; Steenstra, Ivan; Nielsen, Claus Vinther; Maribo, Thomas; Juul, Therese",Journal of cancer survivorship : research and practice,551,1

It aids individuals in reducing uncertainty about the knowledge of the environment and helps them in acquiring an adaptive behaviour at a lower cost than by learning it by themselves. Among the copying strategies, conformity, which is the copying of behavioural decisions presented by the majority, has been well studied and reported in many animals, including humans. The previous study showed that dogs did not conform to their multiple conspecific individuals; however, dogs have evolved to increase their adaptability while living with humans, and it is plausible that dogs have selected appropriate behaviour according to the behaviour of humans. Therefore, we investigated which factors influenced the choice of dogs in a situation where they have to choose one of two numerically unbalanced human groups. The results showed that the dogs followed the human majority group under certain conditions, depending on the familiarity with the human demonstrators. These results are important in considering the significance of groups for dogs and the factors of group formation, and will also provide a clue as to how dogs have penetrated into human society.","Nagasawa, Miho; Mogi, Kazutaka; Ohtsuki, Hisashi; Kikusui, Takefumi",Scientific reports,551,1

METHODS Eight hundred and thirty-eight workers supporting adults with intellectual disabilities completed an online survey about their work during COVID-19 and their mental health in July 2020. RESULTS One in four workers reported moderate to severe emotional distress. Being older and more experienced, having counselling services available through one's agency, and engaging in regular exercise or hobbies outside work were associated with less distress. Workers who reported increased stress in the workplace, stigma towards their families because of their job, personal fears about spreading COVID-19, and receipt of medications for mental health conditions or therapy reported greater distress.

In recent years, a series of new technologies have evolved. It is to assume that significant changes have also occurred in clinical practice. We conducted a nationwide survey to evaluate the current status of care and to compare it with earlier reports. METHODS A standard questionnaire was sent to 1875 institutions to assess the clinical practice of bronchoscopy in Germany with respect to general issues, education, sedation/anaesthesia and technical aspects. RESULTS The returned questionnaires cover 301,965 bronchoscopies, performed by 2158 physicians over 12 months, making it the largest survey to date. The proportion of rigid bronchoscopies has decreased and amounts to 7.3% at present. Atropine as a premedication is hardly used any more. Sedation is routinely applied in 88% of flexible bronchoscopies, for which a combination of propofol and midazolam is preferred by most institutions (41.3%), followed by propofol monotherapy (28.3%). 74.4% of institutions accept aspirin for transbronchial biopsy, 8.1% dual platelet inhibition. 62.4% of all institutions perform airway recanalisation, favouring cryotherapy and argon plasma coagulation. 9.1% of bronchoscopies are supported by endobronchial ultrasound. CONCLUSION Compared to preceding surveys, the experience of bronchoscopists, especially regarding interventional procedures, has increased. Endobronchial ultrasound has become a standard of care, as has patient sedation with propofol.","Hautmann, H; Hetzel, J; Eberhardt, R; Stanzel, F; Wagner, M; Schneider, A; Dirschinger, R; Poszler, A",Pneumologie,551,1

In a retrospective study, single-port access TLH (SPA-TLH) with the OCTO Port was performed on 34 patients with benign gynaecological indications from July 2013 to May 2014 by two surgeons (Ahmet Kale and Hasan Terzi). All patients were divided into two groups. The first 15 patients who underwent SPA-TLH were classified as Group 1, and the second 19 patients who underwent SPA-TLH were classified as Group 2. Patient data were analyzed for age, body mass index (BMI, kg/m(2)), weight of uterus, vaginal cuff suturation time, estimated blood loss, operation time, hysterectomy indications and operative outcomes. The median time needed for the surgery was 75 min in both groups. The duration of suturing of the vaginal cuff was shorter in Group 2 compared with that in Group 1. The estimated blood loss was less in Group 2 compared with Group 1: Four patients in Group 1 required blood transfusion while none of the patients in Group 2 required blood transfusion. The OCTO Port has soft and flexible instrumental movements, which can reduce crowding of instruments during surgery, and the cap rotates 360 degrees. The OCTO Port might facilitate the learning curve of single-port laparoscopic hysterectomy surgery.","Kale, A; Terzi, H; Yavuz, A; Kale, E",Journal of obstetrics and gynaecology : the journal of the Institute of Obstetrics and Gynaecology,551,7

Quercetin conjugates have been detected in plasma and in urine, but their presence in the small intestine has not been assessed. This study aimed to investigate the intestinal metabolism and metabolite excretion of quercetin by the human small intestinal wall after oral dosing. METHODS Six healthy volunteers were given a capsule of 500 mg of quercetin with 240 ml of water. Duodenal fluids were collected using the intraluminal sampling technique for 4 h and analysed by LC-MS/MS. KEY FINDINGS Phase-II metabolites of quercetin were detected and quantified in aspirated intestinal fluids. Metabolites appeared almost immediately after administration, indicating an intestinal metabolism and apical excretion into the lumen. Quercetin-3'-O-glucuronide was found to be the main intestinal metabolite. Our results could not conclude on the enterohepatic recycling of quercetin or its metabolites, although several individual profiles showed distinctive peaks. CONCLUSIONS This study highlights the intestinal metabolism and excretion of quercetin and its conjugates in humans and gives insights into the relevant concentrations which should be used to investigate potential food-drug interactions in vitro.","Chalet, Clément; Rubbens, Jari; Tack, Jan; Duchateau, Guus S; Augustijns, Patrick",The Journal of pharmacy and pharmacology,551,1

Methods: We enrolled 891 COVID-19 patients admitted to the Affiliated Hospital of Jianghan University from December 2019 to February 2020, including 427 men and 464 women. Of the 891 cases, 582 were severe or critical, including 423(73%)severe and 159 (27%) critical cases. We compared the demographics, laboratory findings, clinical characteristics, treatments and prognosis data of the 582 severe patients. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to explore the risk factors associated with death in COVID-19 patients. Results: The 582 severe patients included 293 males and 289 females, with a median age of 64(range 24 to 106). Sixty-three patients died, including 45 males and 18 females, with a median age of 71(range 37 to 90). The average onset time of the 582 patients was 8 days, of whom 461 (79%) had fever, 358 (62%) dry cough, 274 (47%) fatigue. There were 206 cases with shortness of breath (35%), 155 cases with expectoration (27%), 83 cases with muscle pain or joint pain (14%), 71 cases with diarrhea (12%), and 29 cases with headache (4%). Underlying diseases were present in 267 (46%) patients, most commonly hypertension (194, 33%), followed by diabetes (69, 12%), coronary atherosclerotic heart disease (37, 6%), tumor (18, 3%), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (5, 1%). Chest CT showed bilateral lung involvement in 505 patients (87%). Upon admission, the median lymphocyte count of the 582 patients was 0.8(IQR, 0.6-1.1)×10(9)/L, the median D-dimer was 0.5 (IQR, 0.4- 0.8) mg/L, the median N-terminal brain natriuretic peptide precursor (NT-proBNP) was 433 (IQR, 141- 806) pg/L, and the median creatinine was 70.3 (IQR, 56.9-87.9) μmol/L. The death group had a median lymphocyte count of 0.5 (0.4-0.8)×10(9)/L, D-dimer 1.1 (0.7-10.0)mg/L, N-terminal brain natriuretic peptide precursor 1479(893-5 087) pg/ml, and creatinine 89.9(67.1-125.3) μmol/L. Multivariate logistic analysis showed that increased D-dimer (OR: 1.095, 95% CI: 1.045-1.148, P<0.001), increased NT-proBNP (OR: 4.759, 95% CI: 2.437-9.291, P<0.001), and decreased lymphocyte count (OR: 0.180, 95% CI: 0.059-0.550, P=0.003) were the risk factors of death in COVID-19 patients. Conclusions: The average onset time of severe COVID-19 was 8 days, and the most common symptoms were fever, dry cough and fatigue. Comorbidities such as hypertension were common and mostly accompanied by impaired organ functions on admission. Higher D-dimer, higher NT-proBNP, and lower lymphocyte count were the independent risk factors of death in COVID-19 patients.","Qin, W; Hu, B Z; Zhang, Z; Chen, S; Li, F J; Zhu, Z Y; Wang, X J; Liu, M; Li, C H",Zhonghua jie he he hu xi za zhi = Zhonghua jiehe he huxi zazhi = Chinese journal of tuberculosis and respiratory diseases,551,1

There is a great need to incorporate asymptomatic transmissions into traditional modeling of infectious diseases and to study how asymptomatic transmissions shift epidemic dynamics. In this work, we propose a compartmental model with asymptomatic transmissions for waterborne infectious diseases. We conduct a detailed analysis and numerical study with shigellosis data. Two parameters, the proportion $p$ of asymptomatic infected individuals and the proportion $k$ of asymptomatic infectious individuals who can asymptomatically transmit diseases, play major rules in the epidemic dynamics. The basic reproduction number $\mathscr{R}_{0}$ is a decreasing function of parameter $p$ when parameter $k$ is smaller than a critical value while $\mathscr{R}_{0}$ is an increasing function of $p$ when $k$ is greater than the critical value. $\mathscr{R}_{0}$ is an increasing function of $k$ for any value of $p$. When $\mathscr{R}_{0}$ passes through 1 as $p$ or $k$ varies, the dynamics of epidemics is shifted. If asymptomatic transmissions are not counted, $\mathscr{R}_{0}$ will be underestimated while the final size may be overestimated or underestimated. Our study provides a theoretical example for investigating other asymptomatic transmissions and useful information for public health measurements in waterborne infectious diseases.","Lv, Jinlong; Guo, Songbai; Cui, Jing-An; Tian, Jianjun Paul",Mathematical biosciences and engineering : MBE,551,1

Comparison with the H-passivated Si nanocrystal shows that the bromine coating, despite having less electronegativity, affects the electronic structure and transition rates more than the chlorine one due to the stronger structural perturbations caused by the greater surface atoms. Certain electron-hole asymmetry in both of the considered multi-carrier processes is revealed for the Br-coated silicon nanocrystal: the processes become faster if initiated by holes and slower (or invariable on the whole) if initiated by electrons.

Many patients reportedly have active lesions in the small intestine even in patients in clinical remission. This study was performed to compare findings of magnetic resonance enterography (MRE) and ileocolonoscopy. METHODS A single-center retrospective study was conducted in 50 patients (60 imaging series) with CD, for whom MRE was additionally performed during the bowel preparation for subsequent ileocolonoscopy. Endoscopic remission was defined as a Simple Endoscopic Score for CD (SES-CD) of <5. MRE remission was defined as a Magnetic Resonance Index of Activity (MaRIA) score of <50. The time to treatment escalation was assessed by the log-rank test. RESULTS Importantly, 7 of 29 patients (24.1%) with endoscopic remission had a MaRIA score of ≥50. Both SES-CD and MaRIA correlated with the need for treatment escalation (P = 0.025, P = 0.009, respectively). MRE predicted the need for treatment escalation even in patients with endoscopic remission. Although no correlation was present between SES-CD and MaRIA score in patients with structuring/penetrating disease, or insufficient ileal insertion (<10cm), a high MaRIA score still correlated with the need for treatment escalation in stricturing or penetrating disease (P = 0.0306). CONCLUSIONS The MaRIA score predicts the need for treatment escalation even in patients with endoscopic remission, indicating that addition of MRE to conventional ileocolonoscopy alone can be a useful, noninvasive tool for monitoring CD especially in stricturing or penetrating disease.","Sagami, Shintaro; Kobayashi, Taku; Kikkawa, Nao; Umeda, Satoko; Nakano, Masaru; Toyonaga, Takahiko; Okabayashi, Shinji; Ozaki, Ryo; Hibi, Toshifumi",PloS one,551,2

METHODS A web-based survey was administered by SCAI and the ACC Interventional Council to cardiac catheterization laboratory (CCL) directors and interventional cardiologists across the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS Among 414 total responses, 48 states and 360 unique cardiac catheterization laboratories were represented, with mean inpatient COVID-19 burden 16.4+21.9%. There was a spectrum of deferral by procedure type, varying by both severity of COVID-19 burden and procedural urgency (p<0.001). Percutaneous coronary intervention volumes dropped by 55% (p<0.0001) and transcatheter aortic valve replacement volumes dropped by 64%, (p=0.004), with cardiologists reporting an increase in late presenting ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarctions and deaths among patients waiting for transcatheter aortic valve replacement. Almost 1/3 of catheterization laboratories had at least one interventionalist testing positive for COVID-19. Salary reductions did not influence procedural deferral or speed of reinstituting normal volumes. Pandemic preparedness improved significantly over time, with the most pressing current problems focused on inadequate testing and staff health risks. CONCLUSIONS During the COVID-19 pandemic, cardiac procedural deferrals were associated with procedural urgency and severity of hospital COVID-19 burden. Yet patients did not appear to be similarly influenced, with cardiologists reporting increases in late presenting ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarctions independent of local COVID-19 burden. The safety and importance of seeking healthcare during this pandemic deserves emphasis. This article is protected by copyright.

Unlike standard epidemiologic methods that rely on complete data, modeling is needed when there are gaps in data. By combining diverse data sources, models can fill gaps when critical decisions must be made using incomplete or limited information. They can be used to assess the effect and feasibility of different scenarios and provide insight into the emergence, spread, and control of disease. During the past decade, models have been used to predict the likelihood and magnitude of infectious disease outbreaks, inform emergency response activities in real time (1), and develop plans and preparedness strategies for future events, the latter of which proved invaluable during outbreaks such as severe acute respiratory syndrome and pandemic influenza (2-6). Ideally, modeling is a multistep process that involves communication between modelers and decision-makers, allowing them to gain a mutual understanding of the problem to be addressed, the type of estimates that can be reliably generated, and the limitations of the data. As models become more detailed and relevant to real-time threats, the importance of modeling in public health decision-making continues to grow.","Fischer, Leah S; Santibanez, Scott; Hatchett, Richard J; Jernigan, Daniel B; Meyers, Lauren Ancel; Thorpe, Phoebe G; Meltzer, Martin I",MMWR.

While there are presently a few case reports/series on COVID-19 amongst solid organ transplant (SOT) patients, there is no official guideline for the management of SOT patients. AREAS COVERED The authors discuss the pharmacotherapeutic management of SOT patients during the COVID-19 outbreak and provide their expert perspectives. EXPERT OPINION Prophylactic reduction of immunosuppression because of fear of COVID-19 is not suggested in SOT patients. With maintenance immunosuppressive regimens, corticosteroids can be continued during COVID-19. Continuing other immunosuppressive drugs with lowest effective dose/blood concentration is suggested for patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. Discontinuation of antimetabolites and perhaps inhibitors of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is suggested in moderate to severe COVID-19. Calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) may be continued or substituted for mTOR inhibitors with lowest therapeutic concentrations in moderate to severe COVID-19. If continued in patients with COVID-19, therapeutic drug monitoring of CNIs/mTOR inhibitors and appropriate dose reduction is recommended in co-administration with protease inhibitors, hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine, or interleukin (IL)-1/IL-6 receptor antagonists. Complete blood count monitoring is recommended in patients who continue taking antimetabolites or mTOR inhibitors. Dose modification/avoidance should be considered for chloroquine, atazanavir, oseltamivir, ribavirin, anakinra, and Janus associated kinase inhibitors in patients with organ function impairment.","Dashti-Khavidaki, Simin; Mohammadi, Keyhan; Khalili, Hossein; Abdollahi, Azin",Expert opinion on pharmacotherapy,551,16

So, it is important for diabetic patients affected by COVID-19 to eat a healthy balanced diet to maintain stable blood glucose levels and enhance their immune functions.

METHODS We retrospectively analyzed data of patients who had undergone either 4-port LC or 2-port LC for benign gallbladder diseases between March 2007 and March 2013. Two incisions of 2-port LC were composed of an umbilical incision as the manner of single-port laparoscopic surgery and a 5-mm epigastric incision. These two incisions were utilized for comfortable bimanual manipulation under the liver-elevated vision provided by a liver retractor. RESULTS During the study period, 766 patients underwent LC; 263 (34.3%) started with 4-port LC, and 503 (65.7%) started with 2-port LC. Of patients started with 2-port LC, 486 patients (96.6%) was ended up with 2-port without open conversion or addition of port(s). The two groups had similar operative time, open conversion rate, incidence of complications, analgesic requirement, and length of postoperative hospital stay. Multivariate analyses revealed that the independent factors related to prolonged operative time (≥ 90 th percentile) in 2-port LC were the presence of cholecystitis (odds ratio [OR] 2.412, 95% CI 1.246-4.668, p = 0.009) and admission through the emergency department (OR 2.132, 95% CI 1.135-4.004, p = 0.019). CONCLUSION This study suggests that 2-port LC for benign gallbladder diseases is as safe and feasible as 4-port LC when it is performed by surgeons trained in conventional laparoscopic techniques.","Lee, Sang Chul; Choi, Byeong-Jo; Kim, Say-June",International journal of surgery,551,27

Our objective was to characterize the duration of the suicidal process and its relation to possible determinants: time judgment and cognitive impulsivity. In four groups of adults of both sexes including recent suicide attempters (n = 57), suicidal ideators (n = 131), non-suicidal depressed controls (n = 51) and healthy controls (n = 48) we examined time estimation and production, impulsivity and other cognitive variables. Duration of the suicidal process was recorded in suicide attempters. The suicide process duration, suicide contemplation and action intervals, had a bimodal distribution, ∼40% of attempters took less than 5 min from decision to attempt. Time slowing correlated negatively with the suicidal action interval (time from the decision to kill oneself to suicide attempt) (p = .003). Individuals with suicide contemplation interval shorter than three hours showed increased time slowing, measured as shorter time production at 35 s (p = .011) and 43 s (p = .036). Delay discounting for rewards correlated with time estimation at 25 min (p = .02) and 90 s (p = .01). Time slowing correlated positively with suicidal ideation severity, independently of depression severity (p < .001). Perception of time slowing may influence both the intensity and the duration of the suicidal process. Time slowing may initially be triggered by intense psychological pain, then worsen the perception of inescapability in suicidal patients.","Cáceda, Ricardo; Carbajal, Jessica M; Salomon, Ronald M; Moore, Jordan E; Perlman, Greg; Padala, Prasad R; Hasan, Abdullah; Delgado, Pedro L",European neuropsychopharmacology : the journal of the European College of Neuropsychopharmacology,551,24

There is currently no approved therapeutic for highly pathogenic coronaviruses, even as MERS-CoV is spreading throughout the Middle East. We previously screened a library of FDA-approved drugs for inhibitors of coronavirus replication in which we identified Abelson (Abl) kinase inhibitors, including the anticancer drug imatinib, as inhibitors of both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in vitro Here we show that the anti-CoV activity of imatinib occurs at the early stages of infection, after internalization and endosomal trafficking, by inhibiting fusion of the virions at the endosomal membrane. We specifically identified the imatinib target, Abelson tyrosine-protein kinase 2 (Abl2), as required for efficient SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV replication in vitro These data demonstrate that specific approved drugs can be characterized in vitro for their anticoronavirus activity and used to identify host proteins required for coronavirus replication. This type of study is an important step in the repurposing of approved drugs for treatment of emerging coronaviruses. IMPORTANCE Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are zoonotic infections, with bats as the primary source. The 2003 SARS-CoV outbreak began in Guangdong Province in China and spread to humans via civet cats and raccoon dogs in the wet markets before spreading to 37 countries. The virus caused 8,096 confirmed cases of SARS and 774 deaths (a case fatality rate of ∼10%). The MERS-CoV outbreak began in Saudi Arabia and has spread to 27 countries. MERS-CoV is believed to have emerged from bats and passed into humans via camels. The ongoing outbreak of MERS-CoV has resulted in 1,791 cases of MERS and 640 deaths (a case fatality rate of 36%). The emergence of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV provides evidence that coronaviruses are currently spreading from zoonotic sources and can be highly pathogenic, causing serious morbidity and mortality in humans. Treatment of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection is limited to providing supportive therapy consistent with any serious lung disease, as no specific drugs have been approved as therapeutics. Highly pathogenic coronaviruses are rare and appear to emerge and disappear within just a few years. Currently, MERS-CoV is still spreading, as new infections continue to be reported. The outbreaks of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and the continuing diagnosis of new MERS cases highlight the need for finding therapeutics for these diseases and potential future coronavirus outbreaks. Screening FDA-approved drugs streamlines the pipeline for this process, as these drugs have already been tested for safety in humans.","Coleman, Christopher M; Sisk, Jeanne M; Mingo, Rebecca M; Nelson, Elizabeth A; White, Judith M; Frieman, Matthew B",Journal of virology,551,12

However, challenging lesions, such as severely calcified, remain difficult to treat with DCB alone. Vessel preparation with directional atherectomy (DA) potentially improves outcomes of DCB. METHODS AND RESULTS DEFINITIVE AR study (Directional Atherectomy Followed by a Paclitaxel-Coated Balloon to Inhibit Restenosis and Maintain Vessel Patency-A Pilot Study of Anti-Restenosis Treatment) was a multicenter randomized trial designed to estimate the effect of DA before DCB to facilitate the development of future end point-driven randomized studies. One hundred two patients with claudication or rest pain were randomly assigned 1:1 to DA+DCB (n=48) or DCB alone (n=54), and 19 additional patients with severely calcified lesions were treated with DA+DCB. Mean lesion length was 11.2±4.0 cm for DA+DCB and 9.7±4.1 cm for DCB (P=0.05). Predilation rate was 16.7% for DA+DCB versus 74.1% for DCB; postdilation rate was 6.3% for DA+DCB versus 33.3% for DCB. Technical success was superior for DA+DCB (89.6% versus 64.2%; P=0.004). Overall bail-out stenting rate was 3.7%, and rate of flow-limiting dissections was 19% for DCB and 2% for DA+DCB (P=0.01). One-year primary outcome of angiographic percent diameter stenosis was 33.6±17.7% for DA+DCB versus 36.4±17.6% for DCB (P=0.48), and clinically driven target lesion revascularization was 7.3% for DA+DCB and 8.0% for DCB (P=0.90). Duplex ultrasound patency was 84.6% for DA+DCB, 81.3% for DCB (P=0.78), and 68.8% for calcified lesions. Freedom from major adverse events at 1 year was 89.3% for DA+DCB and 90.0% for DCB (P=0.86). CONCLUSIONS DA+DCB treatment was effective and safe, but the study was not powered to show significant differences between the 2 methods of revascularization in 1-year follow-up.

We sought to analyze the feasibility of this procedure for sigmoid colon and rectal cancers and to estimate its difficulty. METHODS We analyzed prospectively collected data from 63 consecutive patients with sigmoid colon or rectal cancers who underwent single-port laparoscopic surgery at our institution from June 2009 to December 2011. Patient and tumor characteristics, including patients' pelvic anatomy which was assessed on CT scan imaging, were evaluated to elucidate what factors would affect the difficulty of the procedure and the necessity of using an additional trocar. RESULTS Overall, the median operative duration was 190 min and blood loss was 20 ml, with no postoperative complications. The median number of lymph nodes harvested was 17 and the distal margin was 58 mm. The tumor was located significantly closer to the anus in cases in which an additional trocar was required in the right lower quadrant (9.5 vs 18 cm, p < 0.0001). Procedural difficulty was significantly increased in cases in which the sacral promontory protruded ventrally (odds ratio 0.779 [95% confidence interval 0.613 to 0.945], p = 0.0236). CONCLUSIONS Depending on tumor location and sacral promontory shape, the introduction of an additional trocar might render single-port laparoscopic surgery feasible for sigmoid colon and rectal cancer resection.","Hamabe, Atsushi; Takemasa, Ichiro; Uemura, Mamoru; Nishimura, Junichi; Mizushima, Tsunekazu; Ikeda, Masataka; Yamamoto, Hirofumi; Sekimoto, Mitsugu; Doki, Yuichiro; Mori, Masaki",Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract,551,1

METHODS A monocentric prospective series of 103 bariatric surgery patients managed with the ER pathway (group ER) was compared with a retrospective and immediately previous series of 103 patients managed with standard care (group CS). The aim of the present study was to assess and compare the differences in terms of mean postoperative length of stay (LOS), costs for surgery and recovery, and the differences in terms of complications, readmission, and reoperation rate in the short term between the ER and CS groups. RESULTS The mean LOS was 4.18 days in group CS and 1.79 days in group ER (p < 0.0001). The mean operative time (OT) per patient was 190.20 min in the group CS and 133.54 min in the group ER, resulting in an average cost of 7272.57€ per patient in group CS and 5424.09€ per patient in group ER. The average recovery cost was 1809.94€ for the group CS series and 775.07 for the group ER one. Overall complications (Clavien-Dindo up to II) occurred in 6 patients (5.8 %) in group CS and in 2 patients (1.9 %) in group ER (p = 0.149) and specific complications (Clavien-Dindo IIIb) occurred for 9 patients (8.7 %) in Group CS and for 14 patients (13.5 %) in group ER (p = 0.268) after hospital discharge within 1-month of follow-up. Twelve patients (11.5 %) in group CS and 13 (12.5 %) in group ER were readmitted after discharge (p = 0.831) within 1-month of follow-up; 8 patients (7.7 %) in group CS versus 9 patients (8.8 %) in group ER needed to be reoperated (p = 0.800) within 1-month follow-up. CONCLUSIONS Enhanced recovery pathway reduces significantly LOS in bariatric surgical patients and shortens the mean OT of the procedure, with no significant differences in terms of surgical outcomes. Furthermore, recovery charges were lower and operative time was shorter allowing for procedural cost reduction.","Simonelli, Vincenzo; Goergen, Martine; Orlando, Gennaro G; Arru, Luca; Zolotas, Charalampos A; Geeroms, Maxim; Poulain, Virginie; Azagra, Juan S",Obesity surgery,551,1

The neural mechanisms underlying these effects remain largely unknown. At the upper limb, mounting evidence suggests that pain-induced reduction in corticospinal excitability is involved. No equivalent data is currently available at the lower limb. The present study therefore examined the effect of thermal pain on the corticospinal drive to tibialis anterior (TA) at rest and during an isometric submaximal dorsiflexion. Transcranial magnetic stimulation was used to induce motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) in the TA at rest and during contraction in the presence or absence of cutaneous heat pain induced by a thermode positioned above the TA (51°C during 1 s). With similar pain ratings between conditions (3.9/10 at rest and 3.6/10 during contraction), results indicate significant decreases in MEP amplitude during both rest (-9%) and active conditions (-13%) (main effect of pain, p = 0.02). These results therefore suggest that cutaneous heat pain can reduce corticospinal excitability in the TA muscle and that such reduction in corticospinal excitability could contribute to the interference of pain on motor control/motor learning.","Billot, Maxime; Neige, Cécilia; Gagné, Martin; Mercier, Catherine; Bouyer, Laurent J",Neural plasticity,551,29

The feasibility of NOTES transrectal approach has increased its clinical applicability. This report describes a first series of minilaparoscopy-assisted transrectal low anterior resection with double purse-string end-to-end circular stapler anastomoses. METHODS Between March and April 2012 three selected patients underwent transrectal minilaparoscopy-assisted natural orifice surgery total mesorectal excision for rectal cancer. All the oncologic principles of open/laparoscopic low anterior resection for rectal cancer were strictly fulfilled. Two patients underwent neoadjuvant treatment. Laparoscopic visualization and assistance was provided through one 10-mm umbilical port and two ports, one of which was used as stoma site (5 mm) and the other as a drain site (2 mm needle port). The specimen was transected transanally followed by the confection of double purse-string lateral/end-to-end anastomoses. There were no intraoperative complications. RESULTS Mean operative time was 143 min. Oral intake was initiated on the second postoperative day. Patients were discharged home by day 5. The pathology unit confirmed that distal and circumferential margins were free of tumor invasion, and quality of mesorectum resection was reported satisfactory. One patient had to be readmitted because of severe dehydration due to increased ileostomy output. The patient was discharged at the third day after the readmission without renal failure. CONCLUSIONS In this preliminary report, transrectal minilaparoscopy-assisted low anterior resection was feasible and safe. Lateral/end-to-end anastomoses can be considered an interesting alternative to the double-stapling technique. However, it is necessary to further study and develop these procedures, along with careful patient selection, before transrectal low anterior resection may be considered for routine clinical use.","Lacy, Antonio M; Adelsdorfer, Cedric; Delgado, Salvadora; Sylla, Patricia; Rattner, David W",Surgical endoscopy,551,28

Methods A literature search was performed by querying MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane computerized databases for relevant articles that reported clinical outcomes in pediatric patients undergoing ACL reconstruction. Studies that were nonclinical, that reported on patients older than 19 years, that were not available in English, or that included fewer than 10 patients were excluded. Outcome measures of all eligible studies were recorded. Results We identified 77 studies published between 1986 and 2018 in 20 peer-reviewed journals. The mean age of the patients was 13.9 years. The ACL rerupture rate was reported in 60% of studies; 32 studies (42%) reported a rate of return to preinjury activity or sports. The use of adult-validated patient-reported outcome measures were reported in 63 (82%) articles. The Lysholm (64%), International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) (56%) and Tegner (37%) scores were the most commonly reported. Two patient-reported outcome measures designed for pediatric patients (the Pedi-IKDC and Hospital for Special Surgery Pediatric Functional Activity Brief Scale (Pedi-FABS) were employed in 5 (6%) recent studies. Conclusions There is variability across studies in the metrics used to assess clinical outcomes following ACL reconstruction in children and adolescents. Validated pediatric-specific instruments were used infrequently. Clinical Relevance A large body of existing pediatric ACL-reconstruction literature relies on a variable set of outcome measures that have not been developed or validated for children and adolescents. More recently, contemporary studies have begun to employ pediatric- and adolescent-specific validated measures, yet their use remains uncommon.","Fabricant, Peter D; Brusalis, Christopher M; Schachne, Jonathan M; Matava, Matthew J","Arthroscopy, sports medicine, and rehabilitation",551,31

Treatment options for CoVs are largely lacking. Here we show that clofazimine, an anti-leprosy drug with a favourable safety profile3, possesses pan-coronaviral inhibitory activity, and can antagonize SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV replication in multiple in vitro systems. The FDA-approved molecule was found to inhibit viral spike-mediated cell fusion and viral helicase activity. In a hamster model of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, prophylactic or therapeutic administration of clofazimine significantly reduced viral load in the lung and faecal viral shedding, and also mitigated inflammation associated with viral infection. Combinatorial application of clofazimine and remdesivir exhibited antiviral synergy in vitro and in vivo, and restricted upper respiratory tract viral shedding. Since clofazimine is orally bioavailable and has a comparatively low manufacturing cost, it is an attractive clinical candidate for outpatient treatment and remdesivir-based combinatorial therapy for hospitalized COVID-19 patients, particularly in developing countries. Taken together, our data provide evidence that clofazimine may have a role in the control of the current pandemic SARS-CoV-2, and, possibly most importantly, emerging CoVs of the future.","Yuan, Shuofeng; Yin, Xin; Meng, Xiangzhi; Chan, Jasper Fuk-Woo; Ye, Zi-Wei; Riva, Laura; Pache, Lars; Chan, Chris Chun-Yiu; Lai, Pok-Man; Chan, Chris Chung-Sing; Poon, Vincent Kwok-Man; Lee, Andrew Chak-Yiu; Matsunaga, Naoko; Pu, Yuan; Yuen, Chun-Kit; Cao, Jianli; Liang, Ronghui; Tang, Kaiming; Sheng, Li; Du, Yushen; Xu, Wan; Lau, Chit-Ying; Sit, Ko-Yung; Au, Wing-Kuk; Wang, Runming; Zhang, Yu-Yuan; Tang, Yan-Dong; Clausen, Thomas Mandel; Pihl, Jessica; Oh, Juntaek; Sze, Kong-Hung; Zhang, Anna Jinxia; Chu, Hin; Kok, Kin-Hang; Wang, Dong; Cai, Xue-Hui; Esko, Jeffrey D; Hung, Ivan Fan-Ngai; Li, Ronald Adolphus; Chen, Honglin; Sun, Hongzhe; Jin, Dong-Yan; Sun, Ren; Chanda, Sumit K; Yuen, Kwok-Yung",Nature,551,27

Here, we examine the effects of age and self-rated hearing on subjective measures of speech understanding via a survey accessed by adults residing in the United States. Method Responses to an online survey were obtained from adults (21 years of age and older) during the summer and fall of 2020. The survey included questions about hearing and speech understanding in a variety of scenarios and different listening conditions, including when communicating with people using face masks in quiet and noisy environments and when using videoconferencing. Results Data from 1,703 surveys were analyzed. In general, the use of face masks led to the perception of poorer speech understanding and greater need for concentration, especially in noisy environments. When responses from all participants were considered, poorer self-rated communication ability was noted as age increased. However, among people who categorized their overall hearing as ""Excellent"" or ""Good,"" younger adults rated their speech understanding ability in noisy situations as poorer than middle-age or older adults. Among people who rated their overall hearing as ""Fair"" or ""Poor,"" middle-age adults indicated having more difficulty communicating with people using face masks, as compared with older adults. Examination of open-ended responses suggested that the strategies individuals use when communicating with people wearing face masks vary by age and self-rated hearing. Notably, middle-age and older adults were more likely to report using strategies that could put them at risk (e.g., asking others to remove their face masks). Conclusions Even younger adults with self-perceived good hearing are not immune to communication challenges brought about by face masks. Among individuals with similar degrees of self-rated hearing, the expected increase in communication difficulty with age was not noted among our respondents.

Its success is mainly hampered by tube tip impingement of laryngeal structures. Advancing the tracheal tube along its normal curvature via a tube exchanger catheter has a high risk of tube tip impingement mainly of right laryngeal structures. The authors achieved successful clinical experience by rotating the tracheal tube 90° anticlockwise (ventral tube tip position) before railroading the tube via a tube exchanger catheter or a fiber optic bronchoscope through the larynx. AIM The aim of the study was to investigate the influence of the tracheal tube tip position while intubating an airway trainer over a tube exchange catheter. MATERIAL AND METHODS Volunteer anesthetists with varying years of professional experience were asked to intubate an intubation mannequin (Laerdal Airway Management Trainer) using the orotracheal route with an established tube exchange catheter (Cook Airway Exchange Catheter, 11F). Two different brands of tracheal tubes (Rüsch and Covidien, ID 7.0 mm) were used in a randomized order, each with the tracheal tube tip at first positioned right (90°), then ventrally (0°), left (270°) and finally dorsally (180°), resulting in eight intubation attempts for each participant. To ensure the correct tube tip position the tube was withdrawn before every intubation attempt until the tube tip position was visualized. The oropharnyx, larynx, trachea and tube were sufficiently lubricated with silicon spray (Rüsch Silikospray). The tube and airway exchange catheter size selection were made according to the clinical trial of Loudermilk et al. Successful endotracheal intubation without resistance was recorded for each tube tip position and tracheal tube brand. RESULTS In total 20 anesthetists (13 consultants and 7 residents) with a median of 9.5 years (range 3-37 years) of professional experience participated in the study. Overall 160 intubation attempts were performed, 2 participants showed no successful intubation attempts at all and 38 out of 160 intubation attempts (23.8 %) were successful. Intubation success with the tracheal tube tip placed ventrally (0°) was 60 % followed by the left (270°) and right (90°) tracheal tube tip positions with 27.5 % and 7.5 % intubation success, respectively. With the tube tip placed dorsally (180°) none of the 40 intubation attempts were successful. Intubation attempts with the Rüsch tube were more successful (28.8 %) than those with the Covidien tube (18.8 %). Placing the tracheal tube tip ventrally, the Rüsch tube was twice as successful as the Covidien tube with 16 (80 %) versus 8 attempts (40 %, p = 0.011). There was no correlation between professional experience and intubation success (p = 0.362). CONCLUSION Tube insertion via an airway exchange catheter or a fiberoptic bronchoscope is a basic technique in anesthesia. Knowledge about the difficulties and their prevention are essential for every anesthetist. The gap between the airway exchange catheter, the fiber bronchoscope and the tube diameters is one of the major reasons for tube tip impingement. This investigation showed that intubation success via a tube exchange catheter, as investigated in an intubation mannequin, is considerably influenced by the tracheal tube tip position. A 90° anticlockwise rotation, placing the tracheal tube tip ventrally, considerably increased intubation success. This is of particular importance if an anesthesia department has no appropriately sized tube exchange catheters or fiber bronchoscope for every age group of patients.","Kemper, M; Haas, T; Imach, S; Weiss, M",Der Anaesthesist,551,16

Supplementary data were obtained from the Medicare Benefit Schedule (MBS) to compare health services activity data provided by different health professionals before and after COVID-19 (from January 2019 to June 2020).ResultsThere was variation in access to different health services by patients with chronic conditions during COVID-19. The introduction of telehealth facilitated continuity of general practitioner (GP) services, with a high level of satisfaction among patients. Changes in medicines regulation, including the home delivery of medications, enabled timely access to medications for patients. The use of telehealth was less common for specialist and particularly allied health services. Dental check-ups that are important for the management of some chronic conditions were disrupted the most during COVID-19.ConclusionThe findings of this study suggest that the policy measures introduced in Australia provided an opportunity to maintain multidisciplinary care for patients with chronic diseases during COVID-19. GPs, as core members of the primary healthcare team, as well as pharmacy and pathology services, were highly accessible. Telehealth was less accessed for chronic care services provided by specialists and allied health professionals.What is known about the topic?Access to multidisciplinary care is critical to ensure continuity and quality of care for patients with chronic health conditions. Evidence suggests disruptions in health services can occur during pandemics. To continue access to routine care, the Australian Government introduced several policy initiatives during COVID-19 to enhance access to multidisciplinary care.What does this paper add?Telehealth policy was particularly effective in facilitating patients' access to general practice services during COVID-19 particularly those services that did not need physical examinations. This policy complemented changes in medicines regulations that enabled timely and convenient access to medications for patients with chronic conditions. Allied health services, as important elements of multidisciplinary care, were more likely to be disrupted during COVID-19.What are the implications for practitioners?Continuation of telehealth services is likely to enhance access to general practice services.

RSV vaccines are currently unavailable, and children suffering from multiple reinfections by the same viral strain fail to develop protective responses. Although RSV-specific antibodies can be detected upon infection, these have limited neutralizing capacity. Follicular helper T (Tfh) cells are specialized in providing signals to B cells and help the production and affinity maturation of antibodies, mainly via IL-21 secretion. In this study, we asked if RSV could inhibit Tfh responses. We observed that Tfh cells fail to upregulate IL-21 production upon RSV infection. In the lungs, RSV infection downregulated the expression of IL-21/IL-21R in Tfh cells and upregulated PD-L1 expression in DCs and B cells. PD-L1 blockade during infection recovered IL-21R expression in Tfh cells and increased the secretion of IL-21 in a DC-dependent manner. IL-21 treatment decreased RSV viral load and lung inflammation, inducing the formation of tertiary lymphoid organs (TLOs) in the lung. It also decreased regulatory follicular T cells (Tfr), and increased Tfh cells, B cells, antibody avidity, and neutralization capacity, leading to an overall improved anti-RSV humoral response in infected mice. Passive immunization with purified IgG from IL-21 treated RSV-infected mice protected against RSV infection. Our results unveil a pathway by which RSV affects Tfh cells by increasing PD-L1 expression on antigen-presenting cells (APCs), highlighting the importance of an IL-21/ PD-L1 axis for the generation of protective responses to RSV infection.","Benedetti Gassen, Rodrigo; Fazolo, Tiago; de Freitas, Deise Nascimento; Borges, Thiago J; Lima, Karina; Antunes, Géssica L; Maito, Fábio; Bueno Mendes, Daniel Ag; Báfica, André; Rodrigues, Luiz Carlos; Stein, Renato; de Souza, Ana Paula Duarte; Bonorino, Cristina",Immunology and cell biology,551,31

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare the effectiveness of mesh fixation versus no fixation in laparoscopic TEP repair for primary inguinal hernia. MATERIALS AND METHODS PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases were searched for relevant articles from January 1992 until May 2020. All trials that compared fixation versus no fixation in TEP repairs for inguinal herniae were included. Recurrent and femoral herniae were excluded from the current analysis. The primary outcome measure was recurrence while secondary outcomes included postoperative pain at 24 h, mean operative time, urinary retention, and seroma rates. Random effects models were used to calculate pooled effect size estimates. Sensitivity analyses were also carried out. RESULTS Eight randomized controlled trials were included capturing 557 patients and 715 inguinal herniae. On random effects analysis, there were no significant differences between fixation and no fixation with respect to recurrence (RD 0.00, 95% CI = - 0.01 to 0.01, p = 1.00), operative time (MD 1.58 min, 95% CI = - 0.22 to 3.37, p = 0.09), seroma (OR = 0.70, 95% CI = 0.28 to 1.74, p = 0.44), or urinary retention (RD 0.09, 95% CI = - 0.18 to 0.36, p = 0.53). However, fixation was associated with more pain at 24 h (MD 0.93, 95% CI = 0.20 to 1.66, p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS Mesh fixation in laparoscopic TEP repair for primary inguinal herniae is associated with increased postoperative pain at 24 h but similar recurrence, seroma, and urinary retention.

We report the case of a 66-year-old man who presented an abdominal dehiscence after multiple laparotomies for a sigmoid-rectal adenocarcinoma that infiltrated into the abdominal wall, subsequently complicated by peritonitis and enteric fistula. A cutaneous dehiscence and an incontinent abdominal wall resulted after the last surgery. The abdominal wall was reconstructed using a biological porcine cross-linked mesh Permacol (Covidien Inc., Norwalk, CT). Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (NPWT), instead, was used on the mesh in order to reduce wound dimensions, promote granulation tissue formation, and obtain secondary closure of cutaneous dehiscence which was finally achieved with a split-thickness skin graft. Biological mesh behaved like a scaffold for the granulation tissue that was stimulated by the negative pressure. The biological mesh was rapidly integrated in the abdominal wall restoring abdominal wall continence, while the small dehiscence, still present in the central area, was subsequently covered with a split-thickness skin graft. The combination of these different procedures led us to solve this complicated case obtaining complete wound closure after less than 2 months.","Caviggioli, Fabio; Klinger, Francesco Maria; Lisa, Andrea; Maione, Luca; Forcellini, Davide; Vinci, Valeriano; Codolini, Luca; Klinger, Marco",Case reports in medicine,551,1

There is concern however, that this new paradigm may lead to over-saturation or burnout. METHODS A 12-question survey investigating resident experiences with educational videoconferences was distributed to University of Washington plastic surgery residents. A modified Maslach Burnout Inventory was used to assess resident burnout from virtual conferences. Conference attendance and reasons for missing conferences were compared using paired two-tailed t-tests. RESULTS A total of 24 residents were given the survey with 100% response rate. There was a significant decrease in the total number of weekly attended videoconferences (p<0.01) and in the number of attended educational videoconferences (p<0.01) over time. Reasons for absences included clinical duties (92% of respondents) followed by symptoms of burnout, including forgetfulness (67%) and feeling fatigued by videoconferencing lectures (54%), and to a lesser extent the belief that the lecture was not educational (25%). 79% of residents reported at least occasionally feeling emotionally drained from videoconferencing and 88% reported at least occasionally feeling burned out due to the number of videoconferencing activities. Despite declining attendance and burnout, 96% believe that videoconferences should continue after the end of quarantine but in a limited quantity. CONCLUSION Videoconferences have become a valued means of resident education. The data suggests however that attendance has waned, largely due to what can be perceived as burnout. Residents remain interested in continuing educational videoconferences, although prioritizing quality over quantity will remain essential to prevent emotional fatigue and burnout.","Yu, Jenny L; Cho, Daniel Y; DeSanti, Rebecca L; Kneib, Cameron J; Friedrich, Jeffrey B; Colohan, Shannon M","Journal of plastic, reconstructive & aesthetic surgery : JPRAS",551,16

Open or laparoscopic surgery is usually used for their resection. Laparoendoscopic single-site surgery has been recently applied in several surgical procedures. This report describes two cases of vesicourachal diverticulum treated by resection using laparoendoscopic single-site surgery. MATERIALS AND SURGICAL TECHNIQUE In each case, laparoendoscopic single-site surgery was performed transperitoneally via one port at a subumbilical semicircular incision. Except for a flexible camera and SILS Port, traditional, non-flexible laparoscopic instruments were used. After the induction of general anesthesia, the patient was placed in a supine position (or lithotomy position). A 2.0-cm incision was made semicircumferentially following the natural subumbilical folds. After the umbilical ligament was cut under direct vision, a SILS Port was placed at the incision. The urachus was liberated distally down to the roof of the urinary bladder using 0° 5-mm flexible camera. Vesicourachal diverticulum with a bladder cuff was completely excised under the supporting view of cystoscopy. Both patients' perioperative days were uneventful. DISCUSSION Our findings suggest that the laparoendoscopic single-site surgery procedure is safe, minimally invasive and cosmetically acceptable. Therefore, this procedure is an excellent option for the radical resection of urachal remnants.","Iida, T; Kawa, G; Takizawa, N; Kawabata, T; Komai, Y; Kinoshita, H; Matsuda, T",Asian journal of endoscopic surgery,551,1

DESIGN A multicentre randomised controlled trial was performed in 29 centres in The Netherlands and the UK. Adult patients with Crohn's disease of the terminal ileum who failed >3 months of conventional immunomodulators or steroids without signs of critical strictures were randomised to laparoscopic ileocaecal resection or infliximab. Outcome measures included quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) based on the EuroQol (EQ) 5D-3L Questionnaire and the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ). Costs were measured from a societal perspective. Analyses were performed according to the intention-to-treat principle. Missing cost and effect data were imputed using multiple imputation. Cost-effectiveness planes and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves were estimated to show uncertainty. RESULTS In total, 143 patients were randomised. Mean Crohn's disease total direct healthcare costs per patient at 1 year were lower in the resection group compared with the infliximab group (mean difference €-8931; 95% CI €-12 087 to €-5097). Total societal costs in the resection group were lower than in the infliximab group, however not statistically significant (mean difference €-5729, 95% CI €-10 606 to €172). The probability of resection being cost-effective compared with infliximab was 0.96 at a willingness to pay (WTP) of €0 per QALY gained and per point improvement in IBDQ Score. This probability increased to 0.98 at a WTP of €20 000/QALY gained and 0.99 at a WTP of €500/point of improvement in IBDQ Score. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic ileocaecal resection is a cost-effective treatment option compared with infliximab.

However, modifications are often made to PCIT, and it is not known whether these impact effectiveness. OBJECTIVE To systematically review and meta-analyze the effects of PCIT on child externalizing behaviors, considering modifications, study design, and bias. DATA SOURCES We searched PubMed, PsycINFO, Education Resources Information Center, Sociological Abstracts, and A+ Education. STUDY SELECTION We selected randomized controlled or quasi-experimental trials. DATA EXTRACTION We analyzed child externalizing and internalizing behaviors, parent stress, parent-child interactions, PCIT format, and study design and/or characteristics. RESULTS We included 23 studies (1144 participants). PCIT was superior to control for reducing child externalizing (standardized mean difference [SMD]: -0.87, 95% confidence interval [CI]:-1.17 to -0.58). PCIT studies that required skill mastery had significantly greater reductions in externalizing behavior than those that did not (Mastery: SMD: -1.09, 95% CI: -1.44 to -0.73; Nonmastery: SMD: -0.51,95% CI: -0.85 to -0.17, P = .02). Compared with controls, PCIT significantly reduced parent-related stress (mean difference [MD]: -6.98, 95% CI: -11.69 to -2.27) and child-related stress (MD: -9.87, 95% CI: -13.64 to -6.09). Children in PCIT were observed to be more compliant to parent requests (SMD: 0.89, 95% CI: 0.50 to 1.28) compared with controls. PCIT effectiveness did not differ depending on session length, location (academic versus community settings), or child problems (disruptive behaviors only compared with disruptive behavior and other problems). LIMITATIONS Results for parent-child observations were inconsistently reported, reducing the ability to pool important data. CONCLUSIONS PCIT has robust positive outcomes across multiple parent-reported and observed parent-child interaction measures, and modifications may not be required even when implemented in diverse populations.","Thomas, Rae; Abell, Bridget; Webb, Haley J; Avdagic, Elbina; Zimmer-Gembeck, Melanie J",Pediatrics,551,24

We recorded the BIS, electromyograph (EMG) activity on a BIS monitor (EMG_BIS), PLE, and EMG activity on a PLE monitor (EMG_PLE) in 40 patients receiving general anesthesia. During the awake state, we analyzed the changes in parameters before and 2 min after the eyes were closed. During sedation, we compared the changes in the parameters before and at 4 min after injecting rocuronium (group R) or normal saline (group C) between the two groups. During anesthesia, we compared the changes in parameters before and at 4 min after injecting sugammadex (group B) or normal saline (group D) between the two groups. During the awake state, the BIS, EMG_BIS, and EMG_PLE, but not PLE, decreased significantly with closed eyes. An effect of EMG on the BIS was evident, but not on PLE. During sedation, the BIS decreased with the decrease in EMG_BIS regardless of NMB caused by rocuronium, but NMB decreased PLE, although the degree of the decrease in EMG_PLE after NMB was similar to that after placebo. To determine the effect of NMB on electroencephalograms (EEGs) in groups R and C, we plotted the power spectra before and at 4 min after injecting rocuronium or normal saline. Changes in slow and delta frequency bands were observed at 4 min after injecting rocuronium relative to before injecting rocuronium. There was no effect of EMG on either the BIS or PLE during anesthesia. In conclusion, the effect of electromyograph activity and/or neuromuscular blockade on BIS or PLE depends on the level of consciousness.","Jin, Sohee; Baik, Hee Jung; Cho, Sooyoung; Chung, Rack Kyung; Kong, Kyoung Ae; Kim, Youn Jin",PloS one,551,1

Nasal airway obstruction and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) are closely related. The aim of this study was to use the 3D imaging software, ITK-SNAP as a platform to define a gold standard for anatomically accurate boundaries of the nasal airway in 3D CBCT and to create a more reliable and precise 3D CBCT segmentation of the nasal airway for assisting diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of nasal airway obstruction and OSAS. METHOD AND MATERIALS After review of the literature to identify established parameters using CBCT and CT technology for the segmentation of the nasal airway, and the existing drawbacks, a gold standard for locating the anatomical boundaries of the nasal airway using CBCT is proposed. This new method aims at standardization of segmentation and quantification, allowing for more reliable comparison between studies. ITK-SNAP software was used to segment three CBCT samples of healthy patients aged 21 to 59 years, who were patients of record, with CBCT obtained for either orthodontic, endodontic, or prosthodontic treatment planning purposes. RESULTS The literature search identified 11 studies describing nasal airway parameters utilizing CBCT and CT. A great variation was detected on where the anatomical boundaries for the nasal airway were selected. A new standard in the identification of anatomical boundaries of the nasal airway is proposed for consistent segmentation and quantification using 3D CBCT by using the following landmarks: the inferior ANS-PNS border, the anterior nares border, the posterior sella-PNS border, and superiorly the border in alignment with the base of the skull (excluding the ostia, frontal, ethmoidal, and sphenoidal air cells). The three segmented samples were volumetrically measured, and statistically analyzed. The mean average Hounsfield unit intensity using the CBCT samples in this study was 629 with a standard deviation of 190. CONCLUSION The literature indicates a lack of a gold standard using CBCT technology for the segmentation of the nasal airway. With the proposed standard in this study, it is possible to quantify the nasal airway volume and thereby its reduction. For the general dental practitioner, this is an important aspect during the evaluation of overall airway assessment. This information can be useful in the diagnosis and treatment of airway compromised dental patients.","Mupparapu, Mel; Shi, Katherine J; Lo, Angela D; Setzer, Frank C",Quintessence international,551,7

However, it is challenging to properly evaluate device performance and train medical personnel for device deployment without the aid of functionally relevant models. Current in vitro aneurysm models suffer from a lack of key functional and morphological features of brain vasculature that limit their applicability for these purposes. These features include the physiologically relevant mechanical properties and the dynamic cellular environment of blood vessels subjected to constant fluid flow. Herein, we developed three dimensionally (3D) printed aneurysm-bearing vascularized tissue structures using gelatin-fibrin hydrogel of which the inner vessel walls were seeded with human cerebral microvascular endothelial cells (hCMECs). The hCMECs readily exhibited cellular attachment, spreading, and confluency all around the vessel walls, including the aneurysm walls. Additionally, the in vitro devices were directly amenable to flow measurements via particle image velocimetry, enabling the direct assessment of the vascular flow dynamics for comparison to a 3D computational hydrodynamics model. Detachable coils were delivered into the printed aneurysm sac through the vessel using a microcatheter and static blood plasma clotting was monitored inside the aneurysm sac and around the coils. This biomimetic aneurysm in vitro model is a promising method for examining the biocompatibility and hemostatic efficiency of embolization devices and for providing hemodynamic information which would aid in predicting aneurysm rupture or healing response after treatment.","Jang, Lindy; Alvarado, Javier; Pepona, Marianna; Wasson, Elisa; Nash, Landon; Ortega, Jason; Randles, Amanda; Maitland, Duncan; Moya, Monica; Hynes, William Frederick",Biofabrication,551,1

There is limited data on the long-term effectiveness of the device. This study sought to determine the safety and long-term efficacy of this device. METHODS A retrospective review of a prospectively maintained database was performed to identify all patients treated with a p64 between March 2015 and November 2018 at University Hospital St. Ivan Rilski. Anatomical features, intraprocedural complications, clinical, and angiographic outcomes were also taken into account and reviewed. RESULTS A total of 72 patients with 72 aneurysms who met the inclusion criteria were identified. Device placement was successful in all patients. Follow-up angiographic imaging at 6 months showed complete occlusion (O'Kelly-Marotta scale [OKM] D) in 55 (76.3%) patients, subtotal aneurysmal filling (OKM B) in 10 (13.8%) patients, and neck remnant (OKM C) in 7 (9.7%) patients. Catheter angiography at 12 months was available for 70 patients (97.2%) and of these patients 91.4% of the aneurysms were completely occluded (OKM D) (64/72). Delayed angiography at 24 months was available for 68 patients (94.4%) and of these 98.5% (67/68) had completely occluded aneurysms. A 36-month angiography was available for 61 patients (84.4%) by which point all aneurysms had been completely occluded (100%). Permanent morbidity due to delayed aneurysmal rupture occurred in one patient (1.38%). The mortality rate was 0%. Self-limiting mild intimal hyperplasia was seen in 2 patients (2.72%).

They remain, however, impacted by far-reaching public health interventions. One crucial question often posed is whether children generally transmit SARS-CoV-2 effectively. METHODS We assessed the components of transmission and the different study designs and considerations necessary for valid assessment of transmission dynamics. We searched for published evidence about transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by children employing a narrative review methodology through 25 June, 2020. RESULTS Transmission dynamics must be studied in repre - sentative pediatric populations with a combination of study designs including rigorous epidemiological studies (e.g. in households, schools, daycares, clinical settings) and laboratory studies while taking into account the social and socio-economic contexts. Viral load (VL) estimates from representative pediatric samples of infected children are missing so far. Currently available evidence suggests that the secondary attack rate stratified by age of the infector is lower for children, however this age pattern needs to be better quantified and understood.

However, when a similar virus spread globally triggering the COVID-19 pandemic, we were harshly reminded that several other neglected diseases might also be waiting for the perfect opportunity to become mainstream. As climate change drives urbanization, natural selection of pathogens and their intermediate vectors and reservoirs, the risk of neglected diseases emerging within a larger susceptible pool becomes an even greater threat. Availability of a vaccine for COVID-19 is widely considered the only way to end this pandemic. Similarly, vaccines are also seen as the best tools available to control the spread of neglected (sometimes referred to as emerging or re-emerging) diseases, until the water, hygiene and sanitation infrastructure is improved in areas of their prevalence. Vaccine production is usually cost and labour intensive and thus minimal funding is directed towards controlling and eliminating neglected diseases (NDs).

We set out to start a VATS lobectomy programme against financial and time constraints to meet cancer waiting times. We present clinical outcomes of patients undergoing VATS major pulmonary resections (VMPRs) with emphasis on postoperative events. METHODS Patients were deemed suitable for VMPR if on computed tomography (CT)/positron emission tomography (PET); the lesion was suspected to represent lung cancer T1-2, N0-1 and M0. VMPR involved individual hilar structures dissection without rib spreading. Systematic mediastinal nodal dissection was added in the last 64 cases. RESULTS Between April 2005 and December 2009, 165 patients were considered suitable for first-time VMPR. Seventy were males and 95 were females. Mean age was 67.5 ± 10.1 (range 34.9-85.5 years) years. Nine patients were not suitable after initial videoscopic assessment and 156 proceeded to VMPR: 150 lobectomies, four bilobectomies, one pneumonectomy and one patient with poor lung function who underwent segmentectomy. There were 23 (14.7%) conversions to thoracotomy. The median operative time for VATS lobectomy was 03:20 ± 00:56 (hh:mm). The median length of hospital stay was 4.0 ± 4.0 days (range 1-25 days, mode 3 days). There were no in-hospital deaths and three (1.9%) out-of-hospital <30 days' mortality. Complications included protracted air leak >3 days in 18 (11.5%) cases, intensive care unit (ICU) admission in 18 (11.5%), pneumothorax in 24 (15.4%) respiratory complications in 14 (9%), bronchial complications in six (3.8%) and bleeding requiring exploration in one (0.6%). The median follow-up was 13.6 months (range 0.1-54.4 months). The actuarial survival at 1, 2 and 3 years for all stages was 85.0 ± 3.8%, 82.2 ± 4.2% and 73.5 ± 7.0%, respectively. CONCLUSION High postoperative events are to be expected when starting a VATS lobectomy programme. Nevertheless, VATS major pulmonary resections are safe and long-term results are not compromised. They should be considered the first choice for T1-2, N0-1 and M0 lung lesions. An aggressive approach to postoperative complications reduced the length of hospital stay to a median of 4 days. Air leak remains the most important cause for prolonged hospital stay.","Amer, Khalid; Khan, Ali-Zamir; Vohra, Hunaid A",European journal of cardio-thoracic surgery : official journal of the European Association for Cardio-thoracic Surgery,551,1

This living systematic review presents the most current and seminal information coming from the scientific literature. It is the monthly update of the second edition of the rapid living systematic review 2020 conducted by Cochrane Rehabilitation REH-COVER Action Steering Committee. OBJECTIVE The aim of this review is to update the monthly COVID-19 and rehabilitation literature research up to September 30th, 2020. METHODS Methodology described in the second edition of the rapid living systematic review 2020 conducted by Cochrane Rehabilitation REH-COVER Action was applied. The most important medical databases were searched, and papers related to COVID19 and rehabilitation were retrieved and summarized descriptively. RESULTS The database search retrieved 2526 publications. Duplicates were removed, and 1150 unique records were screened for inclusion. After screening titles, abstracts and full-texts, 37 papers were included in the present review. According to OCEBM 2011 Levels of Evidence Table, most studies (78.4%) fall within the level of evidence 4 category, while the remainder (22.6%) are categorized as level of evidence 3. Most studies described patients in acute (51.4%) or subacute (35.0%) phase, while no studies described the chronic consequences of COVID-19. Just one study dealt with rehabilitation interventions regarding COVID-19, and two discussed reorganization of rehabilitative services. CONCLUSIONS The most recently published COVID-19 research focuses more on describing the clinical presentations and the natural history of the pathology, rather than rehabilitation interventions or service delivery. Studies with high levels of evidence regarding the efficacy of interventions, longterm monitoring, or new organization models remain lacking.","Andrenelli, Elisa; Negrini, Francesco; De Sire, Alessandro; Patrini, Michele; Lazzarini, Stefano G; Ceravolo, Maria Gabriella",European journal of physical and rehabilitation medicine,551,20

As the causative agent of PED, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) results in acute diarrhea and dehydration with high mortality rates in swine. Dendritic cells (DCs) are highly effective antigen-presenting cells to uptake and present viral antigens to T cells, which then initiate a distinct immune response. In this study, our results show that the expression of Mo-DCs surface markers such as SWC3a(+)CD1a(+), SWC3a(+)CD80/86(+) and SWC3a(+)SLA-II-DR(+) is increased after incubation with UV-PEDV for 24h. Mo-DCs incubated with UV-PEDV produce higher levels of IL-12 and INF-γ compared to mock-infected Mo-DCs. Interactions between Mo-DCs and UV-PEDV significantly stimulate T-cell proliferation in vitro. Consistent with these results, there is an enhancement in the ability of porcine intestinal DCs to activate T-cell proliferation in vivo. We conclude that UV-PEDV may be a useful and safe vaccine to trigger adaptive immunity.","Gao, Qi; Zhao, Shanshan; Qin, Tao; Yin, Yinyan; Yu, Qinghua; Yang, Qian",Research in veterinary science,551,28

Humans consume CQAs in mg-to-gram quantities through dietary consumption of plant products. CQAs are considered beneficial for human health, mainly due to their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Recently, new biosynthetic pathways via a peroxidase-type p-coumaric acid 3-hydroxylase enzyme were discovered. More recently, a new GDSL lipase-like enzyme able to transform mono-caffeoylquinic acids into di-caffeoylquinic acid was identified in Ipomoea batatas. CQAs were recently linked to memory improvement; they seem to be strong indirect antioxidants via Nrf2 activation. However, there is a prevalent confusion in the designation and nomenclature of different CQAs isomers. Such inconsistencies are critical and complicate bioactivity assessment since different isomers differ in bioactivity and potency. A detailed explanation regarding the origin of such confusion is provided, and a recommendation to unify nomenclature is suggested. Furthermore, for studies on CQA bioactivity, plant-based laboratory animal diets contain CQAs, which makes it difficult to include proper control groups for comparison. Therefore, a synthetic diet free of CQAs is advised to avoid interferences since some CQAs may produce bioactivity even at nanomolar levels. Biotransformation of CQAs by gut microbiota, the discovery of new enzymatic biosynthetic and metabolic pathways, dietary assessment, and assessment of biological properties with potential for drug development are areas of active, ongoing research. This review is focused on the chemistry, biosynthesis, occurrence, analytical challenges, and bioactivity recently reported for mono, di, tri, and tetracaffeoylquinic acids.","Alcazar Magana, Armando; Kamimura, Naofumi; Soumyanath, Amala; Stevens, Jan F; Maier, Claudia S",The Plant journal : for cell and molecular biology,551,1

Use of Mobile health for vaccine safety surveillance enables a consumer-centred approach to reporting. The Stimulated Telephone Assisted Rapid Safety Surveillance (STARSS) a randomised control trial (RCT) sought to evaluate the efficacy and acceptability of SMS for AEFI surveillance. METHODS Multi-centre RCT, participants were adult vaccinees or parents of children receiving any vaccine at a trial site. At enrolment randomisation occurred to one of two SMS groups or a control group. Prompts on days 2, 7 and 14 post-immunisation, were sent to the SMS group, to ascertain if a medical event following immunisation (MEFI) had occurred. No SMS's were sent to the control participants. Those in the SMS who notified an MEFI were pre-randomised to complete a computer assisted telephone interview or a web based report to determine if an AEFI had occurred whilst an AEFI in the controls was determined by a search for passive reports. The primary outcome was the AEFI detection rate in the SMS group compared to controls. RESULTS We enrolled 6,338 participants, who were equally distributed across groups and who received 11,675 vaccines. The SMS group (4,225) received 12,675 surveillance prompts with 9.8% being non-compliant and not responding. In those that responded 90% indicated that no MEFI had been experienced and 184 had a verified AEFI. 6 control subjects had a reported AEFI. The AEFI detection rate was 13 fold greater in the SMS group when compared with controls (4.3 vs 0.3%). CONCLUSION We have demonstrated that the STARSS methodology improves AEFI detection. Our findings should inform the wider use of SMS-based surveillance which is particularly relevant since establishing robust and novel pharmacovigilance systems is critical to monitoring novel vaccines which includes potential COVID vaccines.","Gold, M S; Lincoln, G; Cashman, P; Braunack-Mayer, A; Stocks, N",Vaccine,551,1

We utilized nasal wipes made from cotton gauze and multiple, polyester or mixed polyester fabrics to compare performance in the molecular detection and isolation of IAV. In vitro experiments revealed that no polyester or mixed polyester fabric was superior to cotton gauze for molecular IAV detection; however, 3 polyester or mixed polyester fabrics yielded significantly more viable IAV than cotton. In a field trial, both cotton gauze and the polyester or mixed polyester fabric yielded similar proportions of IAV isolates from swine. The results indicate that cotton gauze remains a practical and useful material for swine nasal wipes.","Nelson, Sarah W; Hammons, Christie T; Bliss, Nola T; Lauterbach, Sarah E; Zentkovich, Michele M; Lorbach, Joshua N; Nolting, Jacqueline M; Bowman, Andrew S","Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc",551,1

ICP can be evaluated by measuring the sonographic optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD). We investigated the effect of the isolated Trendelenburg position on ONSD in patients undergoing robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy. Additionally, we evaluated the effect of the Trendelenburg position combined with pneumoperitoneum on ONSD. METHODS Twenty-one patients scheduled for robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy were enrolled. Sonographic ONSDs and hemodynamic parameters were measured at specific time points: in the supine position after induction of anesthesia, 3 min after the steep Trendelenburg position (35° incline), 3 min after the steep Trendelenburg position combined with pneumoperitoneum, and in the supine position after desufflation of the pneumoperitoneum. RESULTS The ONSD 3 min after the steep Trendelenburg position was significantly higher than that of the supine position after induction of anesthesia (5.1 ± 0.3 mm vs. 4.5 ± 0.4 mm). In addition, the ONSD 3 min after the steep Trendelenburg position combined with pneumoperitoneum was higher than that of the supine position after induction of anesthesia (4.9 ± 0.4 mm vs. 4.5 ± 0.4 mm). The ONSD in the supine position after desufflation of the pneumoperitoneum was similar to that in the supine position after induction of anesthesia. CONCLUSIONS Use of the isolated steep Trendelenburg position, for even a short duration, increased the sonographic ONSD, providing a better understanding of the effect of only a transient steep Trendelenburg position on ONSD as a surrogate measure for ICP.","Chin, Ji-Hyun; Seo, Hyungseok; Lee, Eun-Ho; Lee, Joohyun; Hong, Jun Hyuk; Hwang, Jai-Hyun; Kim, Young-Kug",BMC anesthesiology,551,31

Likewise, at waste disposal facilities around the world, human inspectors are often challenged to gauge the composition of waste bulks to determine admissibility and chargeable levy. Manual approaches are laborious, hazardous, and prone to carelessness and fatigue, making unattended gauging of construction waste composition using simple surface information highly desired. This research attempts to contribute to automated waste composition gauging by harnessing a valuable dataset from Hong Kong. Firstly, visual features, called visual inert probability (VIP), characterizing inert and non-inert materials are extracted from 1127 photos of waste bulks using a fine-tuned convolutional neural network (CNN). Then, these visual features together with easy-to-obtain physical features (e.g., weight and depth) are fed to a tailor-made support vector machine (SVM) model to determine waste composition as measured by the proportions of inert and non-inert materials. The visual-physical feature hybrid model achieved a waste composition gauging accuracy of 94% in the experiments. This high performance implies that the model, with proper adaption and integration, could replace human inspectors to smooth the operation of the waste disposal facilities.","Chen, Junjie; Lu, Weisheng; Xue, Fan",Journal of environmental management,551,1

AIMS The aim was to evaluate the performance of the SD Biosensor nCoV real-time detection kit with the real-time PCR kit provided by the Indian Council of Medical Research-National Institute of Virology (ICMR-NIV), Pune (NIV Protocol). SUBJECTS AND METHODS A total of 253 pairs of nasopharyngeal-oropharyngeal swabs combined in a single viral transport medium were tested for viral RNA by both the protocols. The sensitivity and specificity of the SD Biosensor were calculated considering the ICMR-NIV kit as the gold standard. Matched pairs of recorded cycle threshold values (Ct values) were compared by Pearson's correlation coefficient. RESULTS Concordant COVID-19 negative and positive PCR results were reported for 113 and 77 samples, respectively. The SD Biosensor kit additionally detected 62 cases, which were found negative by the NIV protocol. In all discordant positive results by the SD Biosensor kit, the average Ct values were higher than the concordant positive results.

The growth patterns of limb bones and their relationship with the ontogeny of locomotion are critical to our understanding of variation in morphological, physiological and life-history traits within and among species. Unfortunately, the ontogenetic development of limb bones has not been well explored, especially in altricial birds. In this study, we sampled the entire measurements of the pigeon (Columba livia) of individual skeletons, to investigate the ontogenetic allometry of limb bones by reduced major axis regression. The ulna and humerus were found to be positively allometric in relation to body mass, with the ulna growing more rapidly than the humerus. Together with previous data, this suggests that strong positive allometric growth in forelimb bones could be a common trend among diverse Carinatae groups. Hindlimb was dominated by positive allometry, but was variable in the growth of the tarsometatarsus which included three allometric patterns. A greater dorsoventral diameter in the midsection of the humerus and ulna confers superior bending resistance and is ideal for flapping/gliding flight. Shape variation in the midsection of different hindlimb components reflects different mechanical loading, and the markedly inverse trend between the tibiotarsus and tarsometatarsus before 28 days of age also suggests loading change before fledging. Before fledging, the growth of the leg bones was prior to that of the wing bones. This kind of asynchronous development of the fore- and hindlimbs was associated with the establishment and improvement of different functions, and with shifts in the importance of different functions over time.","Yan, Jianjian; Zhang, Zihui",Veterinary medicine and science,551,7

This research further requires careful review for documenting the safety of exercise training in multiple sclerosis, as clarity on safety represents a major hurdle in the clinical prescription of exercise behaviour. OBJECTIVES To enhance understanding of the feasibility of exercise in multiple sclerosis, we (1) provide a protocol of a systematic review and meta-analysis that summarises rates and risks of clinical relapse, adverse events (i.e., an unfavourable outcome that occurs during the intervention delivery time period), and serious adverse events (i.e., an untoward occurrence that results in death or is life threatening, requires hospitalisation, or results in disability during the intervention delivery time period), as well as retention, adherence, and compliance, from randomised controlled trials of exercise training in persons with multiple sclerosis; and (2) identify moderators of relapse, adverse events, and serious adverse event rates. METHODS Eight field-relevant databases will be searched electronically. Studies that involve a randomised controlled trial of exercise training (with non-exercise, non-pharmacological, comparator), report on safety outcomes, and include adults with multiple sclerosis will be included. Rates and relative risks of the three primary outcomes (relapse, adverse event, and serious adverse event) will be calculated and reported each with standard error and 95% confidence interval. Random-effects meta-analysis will estimate mean population relative risk for outcomes. Potential sources of variability, including participant characteristics, features of the exercise stimulus, and comparison condition, will be examined with random-effects meta-regression with maximum likelihood estimation. DISCUSSION The results from this systematic review and meta-analysis will inform and guide healthcare practitioners, researchers, and policymakers on the safety of exercise training in persons with multiple sclerosis. Where possible, we will identify the impact of exercise type, exercise delivery style, participant disability level, and the prescription of exercise guidelines, on the safety of exercise training. The result will identify critical information on the safety of exercise in persons with multiple sclerosis, while also identifying gaps in research and setting priorities for future enquiries.

RESULTS In total, 6291 citations were retrieved, and 44 studies were included across 61.2 million pregnancies. Depression and/or anxiety were associated with HDP [RR = 1.39; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.25-1.54]. CONCLUSIONS When measurement of anxiety or depression preceded diagnosis of hypertension, the association remained (RR = 1.27; 95% CI 1.07-1.50). Women experiencing depression or anxiety in pregnancy have an increased prevalence of HDP compared to their non-depressed or non-anxious counterparts.","Shay, Matthew; MacKinnon, Anna L; Metcalfe, Amy; Giesbrecht, Gerald; Campbell, Tavis; Nerenberg, Kara; Tough, Suzanne; Tomfohr-Madsen, Lianne",Psychological medicine,551,10

These measures would be valuable to support strategic and operational decision making and allocation of resources. Although vulnerability is well defined for natural hazards, for public health threats the concept remains undetermined. Here, we develop new methodologies to: (i) quantify the impact of zoonotic diseases and the capacity of countries to cope with these diseases, and (ii) combine these two measures (impact and capacity) into one overall vulnerability indicator. The adaptive capacity is calculated from estimations of disease mortality, although the method can be adapted for diseases with no or low mortality but high morbidity. As an example, we focused on the vulnerability of Nigeria and Sierra Leone to Lassa Fever and Ebola. We develop a simple analytical form that can be used to estimate vulnerability scores for different spatial units of interest, e.g. countries or regions. We show how some populations can be highly vulnerable despite low impact threats. We finally outline future research to more comprehensively inform vulnerability with the incorporation of relevant factors depicting local heterogeneities (e.g. bio-physical and socio-economic factors).

Objective We conducted a systematic review to identify curricular and educational interventions to build competency among psychiatry residents and fellows in addiction psychiatry. Methods We followed the PRISMA guidelines, searching five databases from inception to August 2020 for relevant evaluation-type studies exploring addiction psychiatry competency among psychiatry residents and fellows. We appraised study quality using the Joanna Briggs Institute's risk of bias tool for observational designs. Results From 1600 records, 17 studies met inclusion criteria. Addiction psychiatry competencies spanned themes involving core knowledge development; attitudinal, communication and leadership skills; screening, assessment, diagnosis; management; and special populations. Examples of effective educational interventions to enhance addiction competency include specific modules for substance use disorders and integrated clinical rotations that simultaneously combine multiple types of skills. Lived experience improved trainee attitudes towards addiction psychiatry. Conclusions While there is current evidence supporting strategies for developing competency in addiction psychiatry, the lack of studies measuring sustained competence over a longer-term follow-up period and the absence of randomized controlled trials limit the overall strength of evidence in this review. Current psychiatry entrustable professional activities (EPAs) involving addiction only partly overlap with curriculum training guidelines and studies identified in this review. These EPAs need to be better identified for training programs, competence in those EPAs better delineated for residents and preceptors, and evaluations should be done to ensure that adequate competence in addictions is attained and sustained.","Bahji, Anees; Smith, Joshua; Danilewitz, Marlon; Crockford, David; El-Guebaly, Nady; Stuart, Heather",Canadian medical education journal,551,1

We aimed to evaluate the effect of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic on obstetrical emergency attendance in a low-risk population and the corresponding perinatal outcomes. STUDY DESIGN This is a single center retrospective cohort study of all singleton births between February 21 and April 30. Prenatal emergency labor ward admission numbers and obstetric outcomes during the peak of the first COVID-19 pandemic of 2020 in Israel were compared with the combined corresponding periods for the years 2017 to 2019. RESULTS During the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, the mean number of prenatal emergency labor ward admissions was lower, both by daily count and per woman, in comparison to the combined matching periods in 2017, 2018, and 2019 (48.6 ± 12.2 vs. 57.8 ± 14.4, p < 0.0001 and 1.74 ± 1.1 vs. 1.92 ± 1.2, p < 0.0001, respectively). A significantly (p = 0.0370) higher rate of stillbirth was noted in the study group (0.4%) compared with the control group (0.1%). All study group patients were negative for COVID-19. Gestational age at delivery, rates of premature delivery at <28, 34, and 37 weeks, pregnancy complications, postdate delivery at >40 and 41 weeks, mode of delivery, and numbers of emergency cesarean deliveries were similar in both groups. There was no difference in the intrapartum fetal death rate between the groups. CONCLUSION The COVID-19 pandemic stay-at-home policy combined with patient fear of contracting the disease in hospital could explain the associated higher rate of stillbirth. This collateral perinatal damage follows a decreased in prenatal emergency labor ward admissions during the first wave of COVID-19 in Israel.

A Look at the Evidence.,16.147701,5.529842,2020-09-17,"Graphite felt is a widely used electrode material for vanadium redox flow batteries. Electrode activation leads to the functionalization of the graphite surface with epoxy, OH, C=O, and COOH oxygenic groups and changes the carbon surface morphology and electronic structure; thus, improving the electrode's electroactivity relative to the untreated graphite. In this study, we conduct density functional theory (DFT) calculations to evaluate functionalization's role towards the positive half-cell reaction of the vanadium redox flow battery. The DFT calculations show that oxygenic groups improve the graphite felt's affinity towards the VO2+/VO2+ redox couple in the following order: C=O > COOH > OH > basal plane. Projected density of states (PDOS) calculations show that these groups increase the electrode's sp3 hybridization in the same order. We conclude that the increase in the sp3 hybridization is responsible for the improved electroactivity, while the oxygenic groups' presence is responsible for this sp3 increment. These insights can help in the better selection of activation processes and optimization of their parameters.","Hassan, Ali; Haile, Asnake Sahele; Tzedakis, Theodore; Hansen, Heine Anton; de Silva, Piotr",ChemSusChem,551,1

While several topical hemostats are currently on the market, most have caveats that limit their use in certain clinical scenarios such as pulsatile arterial bleeding. The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness and safety of Veriset™ hemostatic patch in treating cardiovascular bleeding. Methods Patients (N=90) scheduled for cardiac or vascular surgery at 12 European institutions were randomized 1:1 to treatment with either Veriset™ hemostatic patch (investigational device) or TachoSil® (control). After application of the hemostat, according to manufacturer instructions for use, time to hemostasis was monitored. Follow-up occurred up to 90 days post-surgery. Results Median time to hemostasis was 1.5 min with Veriset™ hemostatic patch, compared to 3.0 min with TachoSil® (p<0.0001). Serious adverse events within 30 days post-surgery were experienced by 12/44 (27.3%) patients treated with Veriset™ hemostatic patch and 10/45 (22.2%) in the TachoSil® group (p=0.6295). None of these adverse events were device-related, and no reoperations for bleeding were required within 5 days post-surgery in either treatment group. Conclusion This study reinforces the difference in minimum recommended application time between Veriset™ hemostatic patch and TachoSil® (30 s versus 3 min respectively). When compared directly at 3 min, Veriset™ displayed no significant difference, showing similar hemostasis and safety profiles on the cardiovascular bleeding sites included in this study.","Glineur, David; Hendrikx, Marc; Krievins, Dainis; Stradins, Peteris; Voss, Bernhard; Waldow, Thomas; Haenen, Luc; Oberhoffer, Martin; Ritchie, Caroline M",Medical devices,551,16

However, endoscopic removal still may be possible using combined endoscopic and laparoscopic surgery (CELS). The CELS procedure allows for intra- and extraluminal manipulation of the bowel wall to facilitate polyp removal, thereby avoiding bowel resection. This study evaluated the authors' institutional experience with CELS in this patient population. METHODS Between August 2008 and October 2012, all patients referred to undergo surgery for a benign colon polyp were retrospectively reviewed for operative characteristics, pathology, and postoperative outcomes. Of 14 patients, five were considered candidates for CELS and were compared with nine patients who underwent resection. RESULTS The average patient age was similar between the two groups (CELS, 64.9 years vs. resection, 68.3 years). The mean polyp size was 2.3 cm in the CELS group and 2.9 cm in the resection group. In the CELS group, polyps were successfully removed in all cases. The mean operating room time was 159 min in the CELS group and 205 min in the resection group. The median hospital stay was 1 day in the CELS group and 5 days in the resection group. No complications occurred in the CELS group. Two patients in the resection group (22 %) experienced a wound infection. One patient had a postoperative ileus (11 %). Four patients in the CELS group had a benign adenoma. One patient had a benign frozen section evaluation, but the final pathology showed adenocarcinoma requiring a subsequent colectomy. In the resection group, six patients had a benign adenoma, and three patients had a T1N0 cancer. In the CELS group, repeat endoscopy was performed an average of 9.9 months after CELS. Two patients had a residual polyp, and two patients had new polyps in a different location. All were successfully removed. CONCLUSION For benign-appearing polyps not amenable to endoscopic techniques alone, CELS may be an alternative to formal bowel resection for carefully selected patients. The CELS procedure can be performed safely with minimal morbidity and with outcomes that compare favorably with those of formal colectomy.","Lee, Minna K; Chen, Formosa; Esrailian, Eric; Russell, Marcia McGory; Sack, Jonathan; Lin, Anne Y; Yoo, James",Surgical endoscopy,551,1

Protein kinases are key regulators of many cellular functions, and the systematic knockdown of their expression should provide a broad perspective on factors and pathways promoting or antagonizing coronavirus replication. In addition to 40 proteins that promote SARS-CoV replication, our study identified 90 factors exhibiting an antiviral effect. Pathway analysis grouped subsets of these factors in specific cellular processes, including the innate immune response and the metabolism of complex lipids, which appear to play a role in SARS-CoV infection. Several factors were selected for in-depth validation in follow-up experiments. In cells depleted for the β2 subunit of the coatomer protein complex (COPB2), the strongest proviral hit, we observed reduced SARS-CoV protein expression and a >2-log reduction in virus yield. Knockdown of the COPB2-related proteins COPB1 and Golgi-specific brefeldin A-resistant guanine nucleotide exchange factor 1 (GBF1) also suggested that COPI-coated vesicles and/or the early secretory pathway are important for SARS-CoV replication. Depletion of the antiviral double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase (PKR) enhanced virus replication in the primary screen, and validation experiments confirmed increased SARS-CoV protein expression and virus production upon PKR depletion. In addition, cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (CDK6) was identified as a novel antiviral host factor in SARS-CoV replication. The inventory of pro- and antiviral host factors and pathways described here substantiates and expands our understanding of SARS-CoV replication and may contribute to the identification of novel targets for antiviral therapy. IMPORTANCE Replication of all viruses, including SARS-CoV, depends on and is influenced by cellular pathways. Although substantial progress has been made in dissecting the coronavirus replicative cycle, our understanding of the host factors that stimulate (proviral factors) or restrict (antiviral factors) infection remains far from complete. To study the role of host proteins in SARS-CoV infection, we set out to systematically identify kinase-regulated processes that influence virus replication. Protein kinases are key regulators in signal transduction, controlling a wide variety of cellular processes, and many of them are targets of approved drugs and other compounds. Our screen identified a variety of hits and will form the basis for more detailed follow-up studies that should contribute to a better understanding of SARS-CoV replication and coronavirus-host interactions in general. The identified factors could be interesting targets for the development of host-directed antiviral therapy to treat infections with SARS-CoV or other pathogenic coronaviruses.","de Wilde, Adriaan H; Wannee, Kazimier F; Scholte, Florine E M; Goeman, Jelle J; Ten Dijke, Peter; Snijder, Eric J; Kikkert, Marjolein; van Hemert, Martijn J",Journal of virology,551,16

However, the timing of drain removal remains debatable. Meanwhile, prolonged drain placement might increase the risk of postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF), with a prevalence of 5-40%. Therefore, we examined the effect of removing the drain within postoperative day (POD) 3 on the risk of POPF development. PATIENTS AND METHODS A total of 108 consecutive patients who underwent DP between April 2015 and March 2020 were examined and divided into two groups according to the day of drain removal; hence, for some patients, the drain was removed on POD 1 (POD 1 group) and for others on POD 3 (POD 3 group). Furthermore, risk factors, including drain fluid amylase (DFA) levels, for developing POPF were investigated.

In response to survey fatigue and suboptimal feedback from online evaluations, this postlecture group debrief was adapted to emergency medicine residency didactics, with a goal of collecting timely, specific, and balanced feedback for presenters. Other aims include encouraging participants to think critically about educational methods and providing presenters with formal feedback for a portfolio or promotion packet. It was hypothesized that EA provides more specific and actionable feedback than traditional online evaluations deployed individually to conference attendees. Methods The authors analyzed 4 months of evaluations pre- and postimplementation of EA. Rate of completion, presence of comments, and types of comments were compared. Comments were coded as specific, nonspecific, and unrelated/unclear. Specific comments were further categorized as about audiovisual presentation design, speaker presentation style, and educational methods of the session. Results A total of 46 of 65 (71%) preimplementation presentations eligible for evaluation received comments through traditional online evaluations. A total of 44 of 75 (59%) eligible postimplementation presentations generated comments via EA. Among presentations that received comments, none received nonspecific comments via EA, compared to 46% of lectures through traditional evaluations.

Multiple studies have demonstrated efficacy nearing that of extirpative surgery for certain urologic conditions. There are technical limitations to their speed and safety profile because of the physical limits of thermal diffusion. RECENT FINDINGS Recently, there has been a desire to investigate other forms of energy in an effort to circumvent the limitations of cryoblation and radiofrequency ablation. This review will focus on three relatively new energy applications as they pertain to tissue ablation: microwave, irreversible electroporation, and water vapor. High-intensity-focused ultrasound nor interstitial lasers are discussed, as there have been no recently published updates. SUMMARY Needle and probe-based ablative treatments will continue to play an important role. As three-dimensional imaging workstations move from the advanced radiologic interventional suite to the operating room, surgeons will likely still play a pivotal role in the +-application of these probe ablative devices. It is essential that the surgeon understands the fundamentals of these devices in order to optimize their application.","Leveillee, Raymond J; Pease, Karli; Salas, Nelson",Current opinion in urology,551,19

DESIGN A single-centre, prospective observational study. SETTING Amiens University Hospital, France. PATIENTS All adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery were considered eligible for participation. Patients who had undergone pulmonary or tricuspid valve surgery, repeat surgery or who underwent immediate postoperative renal replacement therapy were excluded. Data from 74 patients were analysed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Left ventricular and right ventricular function were assessed before surgery and on admission to ICU by transthoracic echocardiography (TTE): left ventricular and right ventricular ejection fractions (LVEF/RVEF), tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE), tricuspid annular systolic velocity (Sr(t)) and right ventricular dilatation. RVd was defined as values in the lowest quartile of at least two echocardiographic variables. Renal dysfunction was defined as an increase in serum creatinine concentration (sCr) on postoperative day 1. RESULTS All right ventricular TTE variables decreased (P < 0.05) after surgery: RVEF from 50% (49 to 60) to 40% (35 to 50); TAPSE from 22.3 mm (19.4 to 25.3) to 12.2 mm (8.8 to 14.8); and Sr(t) from 15.0 cm s(-1) (12.0 to 18.0) to 8.1 cm s(-1) (6.3 to 9.2). Fourteen (19%) patients had right ventricular dilatation and RVd was present in 23 (31%) patients. Forty patients had a positive variation in sCr. In multivariate analysis, patients with RVd had an odds ratio (OR) of 12.7 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 2.6 to 63.4, P = 0.02] for development of renal dysfunction. Renal dysfunction was associated with increased central venous pressure but was not associated with cardiac index (CI). CONCLUSION These results suggest that early postoperative RVd is associated with a subsequent increase of sCr and that the mechanism involved is congestion (vena cava dilatation/elevated CVP) rather than decreased CI.","Guinot, Pierre Grégoire; Abou-Arab, Osama; Longrois, Dan; Dupont, Herve",European journal of anaesthesiology,551,24

We aimed at describing COVID-19 infections in the French cohort of lung transplant (LT) patients. METHODS Multicenter nationwide cohort study of all LT recipients with COVID-19 diagnosed from March 1 to May 19, 2020. Recipient main characteristics and their management were retrieved. Hospitalization characteristics, occurrence of complications and survival were analyzed. RESULTS Thirty-five LT patients with a COVID-19 infection were included. Median age was 50.4 [40.6-62.9] years, 16 (45.7%) were female, and 80% were double-LT recipients. Infection was community-acquired in 25 (71.4%). Thirty-one (88.6%) required hospitalization, including 13 (41.9%) in the intensive care unit. The main symptoms of COVID-19 were fever, cough, and diarrhea, present in 71.4%, 54.3%, and 31.4% of cases, respectively. Extension of pneumonia on chest CT was moderate to severe in 51.4% of cases. Among the 13 critically ill patients, 7 (53.9%) received invasive mechanical ventilation. Thrombotic events occurred in 4 patients. Overall survival rate was 85.7% after a median follow-up of 50 days [41.0-56.5]. Four of 5 nonsurvivors had had bronchial complications or intensification of immunosuppression in the previous weeks. On univariate analysis, overweight was significantly associated with risk of death (odds ratio 16.0 [95% confidence interval1.5-170.6], p=0.02).

Laparoscopic choledochal cyst excision and Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy are challenging and sophisticated surgeries because of the difficult anastomosis. Recent advances in robotic surgery have enabled more delicate and precise movements, and Endowrist instruments allow for securing sutures during anastomosis. This study aimed to compare surgical outcomes of laparoscopic and robotic hepaticojejunostomy in choledochal cyst excision. Methods Sixty-seven patients who underwent laparoscopic or robotic-hybrid choledochal cyst excision from 2004 to 2016 were retrospectively analyzed and compared. In robotic surgery, dissection was performed laparoscopically, and hepaticojejunostomy was performed using a robotic platform. Results The mean operative time was significantly longer in robotic surgery than in laparoscopic surgery (247.94 ± 54.14 minutes vs. 181.31 ± 43.06 minutes, P < 0.05). The mean estimated blood loss (108.71 ± 15.53 mL vs. 172.78 ± 117.46 mL, respectively, P = 0.097) and postoperative hospital stay (7.33 ± 2.96 days vs. 6.22 ± 1.06 days, P = 0.128) were comparable between procedures. Compared to the laparoscopic approaches, robotic surgery had significantly less short-term complications (22.4% vs. 0%, P = 0.029). There were more biliary leakage (n = 7, 14.3%) observed during the first 30 days after surgery in laparoscopy while none were observed in the robotic method. Conclusion Robotic surgery allow for more precise and secure sutures during anastomosis thereby reducing biliary complications. With expanding knowledge and expertise, robotic surgery may offer more advantages over laparoscopy in the era of minimally invasive surgery.","Lee, Hongeun; Kwon, Wooil; Han, Youngmin; Kim, Jae Ri; Kim, Sun-Whe; Jang, Jin-Young",Annals of surgical treatment and research,551,27

However, a number of important obstacles remain before its wide introduction into clinical practice can be envisaged. One of the biggest bottlenecks is the lack of efficient and safe delivery technologies, particularly, for in vivo distribution. Above and beyond standard requirements for carriers, the delivery systems for gene therapy ideally use a hit-and-run principle (to minimize off-target effect and display of immunogenic moieties). None of the currently used viral vectors fulfills all of these requirements. Therefore, the growing variety of non-viral delivery platforms represents a promising alternative. Areas covered: This review summarizes the Layer-by-Layer (LbL) approaches that can be effectively used for the gene delivery, considering various examples with the transfer of pDNA, mRNA, siRNA as well as genome-editing tools. Ex vivo gene modification of clinically relevant cells and clinical aspects for possible application of LbL systems in gene therapy are also underlined. Expert opinion: The LbL technique provides broad opportunities for the delivery of genetic material for various purposes and offers promise for future clinical application in gene therapy.","Linnik, Dmitrii S; Tarakanchikova, Yana V; Zyuzin, Mikhail V; Lepik, Kirill V; Aerts, Joeri L; Sukhorukov, Gleb; Timin, Alexander S",Expert opinion on drug delivery,551,17

METHODS Simulated closed-loop extracorporeal membrane oxygenation circuits (1/4 and 3/8 inch) were prepared with a Quadrox-i pediatric and Quadrox-i adult oxygenator and blood primed. In addition, 1/4- and 3/8-inch circuits were also prepared without an oxygenator in series. A one-time dose of voriconazole was administered into the circuits, and serial pre- and post-oxygenator concentrations were obtained at 5 minutes, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 24 hour time points. Voriconazole was also maintained in a glass vial and samples were taken from the vial at the same time periods for control purposes to assess for spontaneous drug degradation. RESULTS For the 1/4-inch circuit, there was an approximate mean of 64-67% voriconazole loss with the oxygenator in series and mean of 15-20% voriconazole loss without an oxygenator in series at 24 hours. For the 3/8-inch circuit, there was an approximate mean of 44-51% voriconazole loss with the oxygenator in series and a mean of 8-12% voriconazole loss without an oxygenator in series at 24 hours. The reference voriconazole concentrations remained relatively constant during the entire study period demonstrating that the drug loss in each size of the extracorporeal membrane oxygenation circuit with or without an oxygenator was not a result of spontaneous drug degradation. CONCLUSION This ex vivo investigation demonstrated substantial voriconazole loss within an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation circuit with an oxygenator in series with both sizes of the Quadrox-i oxygenator at 24 hours and no significant voriconazole loss in the absence of an oxygenator. Further evaluations with multiple dose in vitro and in vivo investigations are needed before specific voriconazole dosing recommendations can be made for clinical application with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.","Cies, Jeffrey J; Moore, Wayne S; Giliam, Nadji; Low, Tracy; Marino, Daniel; Deacon, Jillian; Enache, Adela; Chopra, Arun",Perfusion,551,25

BCV is active against double-stranded DNA viruses including BK and JC virus. Here, we validated procedures for quantifying BCV and its pharmacologically active moiety cidofovir diphosphate (CDV-PP) in mouse kidney, brain, and spleen tissue homogenates. Following homogenization, BCV and CDV-PP were extracted from the tissues by protein precipitation with their stable, isotopically labeled internal standards, BCV-d6 and 13 C3 15 N2 -CDV-PP. Then, samples were analyzed for BCV by reverse phase chromatography on a Waters Xterra MS C18 (50 x 2.1mm, 3.5μm particle size) column while CDV-PP was analyzed on a Thermo BioBasic AX (50 x 2.1 mm, 5μm particle size) column using anion exchange chromatography. Detection was achieved by electrospray ionization in positive ion mode on an AB Sciex API-5000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. The calibration curves were linear over a range of 1.00 - 1000 ng/mL homogenate and 0.050 - 50.0 ng/mL homogenate for BCV and CDV-PP, respectively. These methods were validated according to FDA guidance for industry and may be used to characterize the tissue pharmacology of both analytes to advance its preclinical development.","Guzman, Bryan B; Schauer, Amanda P; Dunn, John A; Cottrell, Mackenzie L; Sykes, Craig",Biomedical chromatography : BMC,551,31

However, it is now appreciated that transcriptional control of protein coding genes resides within these noncoding regions. Thousands of genes encoding long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs) have been recently identified throughout the genome, which positively or negatively regulate transcription of neighboring target genes. Both TMEVPG1 and its mouse ortholog encode lincRNAs and are positioned near the IFN-γ gene (IFNG). In this study, we show that transcription of both mouse and human TMEVPG1 genes is Th1 selective and dependent on Stat4 and T-bet, transcription factors that drive the Th1 differentiation program. Ifng expression is partially restored in Stat4-/-Tbx21-/- cells through coexpression of T-bet and Tmevpg1, and Tmevpg1 expression contributes to, but alone is not sufficient to, drive Th1-dependent Ifng expression. Our results suggest that TMEVPG1 belongs to the general class of lincRNAs that positively regulate gene transcription.","Collier, Sarah P; Collins, Patrick L; Williams, Christopher L; Boothby, Mark R; Aune, Thomas M",Journal of immunology,551,24

We also assessed the relationship between the change of rSO2 and the changes of mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO2), arterial oxygen tension (PaO2), or arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2). METHODS Forty-one adult patients who underwent a robotic assisted endoscopic prostatic surgery under propofol and remifentanil anesthesia were involved in this study. During the surgery, a pneumoperitoneum was established using carbon dioxide. Measurements of rSO2, MAP, HR, PaCO2, PaO2, and SaO2 were performed before the pneumoperitoneum (baseline), every 5 min after the onset of pneumoperitoneum, before the Trendelenburg position. After the onset of the Trendelenburg position, rSO2, MAP, HR were recorded at 5, 10, 20, 30, 45, and 60 min, and PaCO2, PaO2, and SaO2 were measured at 10, 30, and 60 min. RESULTS Before the pneumoperitoneum, left and right rSO2 were 67.9 ± 6.3% and 68.5 ± 7.0%. Ten minutes after the onset of pneumoperitoneum, significant increase in the rSO2 was observed (left: 69.6 ± 5.9%, right: 70.6 ± 7.4%). During the Trendelenburg position, the rSO2 increased initially and peaked at 5 min (left: 72.2 ± 6.5%, right: 73.1 ± 7.6%), then decreased. Multiple regression analysis showed that change of rSO2 correlated with MAP and PaCO2. CONCLUSIONS Pneumoperitoneum and the Trendelenburg position in robotic-assisted endoscopic prostatic surgery did not worsen cerebral oxygenation. Arterial blood pressure is the critical factor in cerebral oxygenation.

METHOD AND MATERIALS Sixty healthy volunteers who had a first or second mandibular molar diagnosed with irreversible pulpitis participated in the present study. This study was composed of three arms for the first molar and three arms for the second molar. Subjects in test arm A received two IANB injections (3.6 mL). Subjects in test arm B received 1.8 mL IANB injection plus 1.8 mL buccal infiltration. Subjects in test arm C received 1.8 mL IANB injection plus 1.8 mL lingual infiltration. Articaine (4%) with 1:100,000 epinephrine was used for all injections. The subject's pain during access preparation and pulp extirpation was recorded on the Heft-Parker visual analog scale. Success was defined as ""none"" or ""mild"" pain during treatment. Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare pain categories in three groups of interventions for each mandibular molar. RESULTS IANB with a supplemented buccal infiltration provided more success than IANB alone or IANB plus lingual infiltration, in first molars (P = .019). There were no significant differences between ﻿the three injection techniques in second molars (P = .795).

However, the findings are highly heterogeneous, reporting partly conflicting results following a broad spectrum of methodological approaches to answer the question ""who benefits most"" from working memory training. Objective: The present systematic review aimed to systematically investigate prognostic factors and models for working memory training responsiveness in healthy older adults. Method: Four online databases were searched up to October 2019 (MEDLINE Ovid, Web of Science, CENTRAL, and PsycINFO). The inclusion criteria for full texts were publication in a peer-reviewed journal in English/German, inclusion of healthy older individuals aged ≥55 years without any neurological and/or psychiatric diseases including cognitive impairment, and the investigation of prognostic factors and/or models for training responsiveness after targeted working memory training in terms of direct training effects, near-transfer effects to verbal and visuospatial working memory as well as far-transfer effects to other cognitive domains and behavioral variables. The study design was not limited to randomized controlled trials. Results: A total of 16 studies including n = 675 healthy older individuals with a mean age of 63.0-86.8 years were included in this review. Within these studies, five prognostic model approaches and 18 factor finding approaches were reported. Risk of bias was assessed using the Quality in Prognosis Studies checklist, indicating that important information, especially regarding the domains study attrition, study confounding, and statistical analysis and reporting, was lacking throughout many of the investigated studies. Age, education, intelligence, and baseline performance in working memory or other cognitive domains were frequently investigated predictors across studies. Conclusions: Given the methodological shortcomings of the included studies, no clear conclusions can be drawn, and emerging patterns of prognostic effects will have to survive sound methodological replication in future attempts to promote precision medicine approaches in the context of working memory training. Methodological considerations are discussed, and our findings are embedded to the cognitive aging literature, considering, for example, the cognitive reserve framework and the compensation vs. magnification account. The need for personalized cognitive prevention and intervention methods to counteract cognitive decline in the aging population is high and the potential enormous.

However, critical care faces an additional challenge in that it has often been deemed too costly or complicated for resource-poor settings. This lack of prioritization is not justified. Hospital care for the sickest patients affects overall mortality, and public health interventions depend on community confidence in healthcare to ensure participation and adherence. Some of the most effective critical care interventions, including rapid fluid resuscitation, early antibiotics, and patient monitoring, are relatively inexpensive. Although cost-effectiveness studies on critical care in resource-poor settings have not been done, evidence from the surgical literature suggests that even resource-intensive interventions can be cost effective in comparison to immunizations and human immunodeficiency virus care. In the developing world, where many critically ill patients are younger and have fewer comorbidities, critical care presents a remarkable opportunity to provide significant incremental benefit, arguably much more so than in the developed world. ESSENTIAL CONSIDERATIONS Key areas of consideration in developing critical care in resource-poor settings include: Personnel and training, equipment and support services, ethics, and research. Strategies for training and retaining skilled labor include tying education to service commitment and developing protocols for even complex processes. Equipment and support services need to focus on technologies that are affordable and sustainable. Ethical decision making must be based on data when possible and on transparent articulated policies always. Research should be performed in resource-poor settings and focus on needs assessment, prognostication, and cost effectiveness. FUTURE DIRECTIONS The development of critical care in resource-poor settings will rely on the stepwise introduction of service improvements, leveraging human resources through training, a focus on sustainable technology, ongoing analysis of cost effectiveness, and the sharing of context-specific best practices. Although prevention, public health, and disease-specific agendas dominate many current conversations in global health, this is nonetheless a time ripe for the development of critical care. Leaders in global health funding hope to improve quality and length of life. Critical care is an integral part of the continuum of care necessary to make that possible.","Riviello, Elisabeth D; Letchford, Stephen; Achieng, Loice; Newton, Mark W",Critical care medicine,551,1

This temporal difference was established from early birthdating studies based on DRG soma cell size. However, distinctions in birthdates between molecular subtypes of sensory neurons, particularly nociceptors, is unknown. Here, we assess the birthdate of lumbar DRG neurons in mice using a thymidine analog, EdU, to label developing neurons exiting mitosis combined with co-labeling of known sensory neuron markers. We find that different nociceptor subtypes are born on similar timescales, with continuous births between E9.5 to E13.5, and peak births from E10.5 to E11.5. Notably, we find that thinly myelinated Aδ-fiber nociceptors and peptidergic C-fibers are born more broadly between E10.5 and E11.5 than previously thought and that non-peptidergic C-fibers and C-LTMRs are born with a peak birth date of E11.5. Moreover, we find that the percentages of nociceptor subtypes born at a particular timepoint are the same for any given nociceptor cell type marker, indicating that intrinsic or extrinsic influences on cell type diversity are occurring similarly across developmental time. Overall, the patterns of birth still fit within the classical ""two wave"" description, as touch and proprioceptive fibers are born primarily at E10.5, but suggest that nociceptors have a slightly broader wave of birthdates with different nociceptor subtypes continually differentiating throughout sensory neurogenesis irrespective of myelination.","Landy, Mark A; Goyal, Megan; Lai, Helen C",Developmental biology,551,16

METHODS We have examined the magnitude and duration of antiviral antibody immunity conferred by smallpox vaccination in 246 participants of the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. Of this population, 209 subjects were vaccinated one or more times 13 to 88 years before this evaluation, and stored serum samples were available at various intervals after vaccination. An additional 8 subjects who had documented childhood smallpox infection and 29 subjects with no history of infection or vaccination were included. We quantified the total vaccinia IgG and neutralizing antibody titers in each of these subgroups of participants over time. RESULTS Vaccinated participants maintained antivaccinia IgG and neutralizing antibody titers above 3 natural logs essentially indefinitely. The absolute titer of antivaccinia antibody was only slightly higher after multiple vaccinations. In 97% of the participants, no decrease in vaccinia-specific antibody titers was noted with age over a follow-up period of up to 88 years. Moreover, Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging participants who survived active smallpox infections in their youth retained antivaccinia antibody titers that were similar to the levels detected in vaccinated subjects. CONCLUSION These data suggest that multiple or recent vaccinations are not essential to maintain vaccinia-specific antibody responses in human subjects. Scarce vaccine supplies should be applied first to individuals who have not previously been vaccinated.","Taub, Dennis D; Ershler, William B; Janowski, Mark; Artz, Andrew; Key, Michael L; McKelvey, Julie; Muller, Denis; Moss, Bernard; Ferrucci, Luigi; Duffey, Patricia L; Longo, Dan L",The American journal of medicine,551,1

It begins by tracing two rival competing positions in the sociology of art, derived from Becker and Bourdieu, before taking a closer look at how Hogarth's work conjures up a new vision of the world, providing shape and meaning to the nation's changing understandings of morality, society, and the city. A fundamental transformation in the field of representation appears halfway through the eighteenth century and the interweaving of art theory, national identity, and systems of patronage are at the centre of this dynamic period. It is no accident that in Hogarth's world the main targets are those who seek to transgress their stations in life and cross class barriers. By combining two different sociological approaches to art the study builds a more nuanced picture of the artist and his work.","Carrabine, Eamonn",The British journal of sociology,551,1

METHODS Secondary data were collected from different government organizations, 120 primary surveys were conducted for calculating weights, and results were validated through 12 key people's interviews. Pairwise comparison matrixes were calculated for 9 factors and subfactors. The analytic hierarchy process used for calculating the susceptibility index and map was prepared based on the results. RESULTS According to the results, multiple causal factors might be responsible for COVID-19 spreading in Bangladesh. Dhaka might be vulnerable to COVID-19 due to a higher population, population density, and international collaboration. According to the pairwise comparison matrix, the consistency ratio for subfactors and factors was in the permissible limit (ie, less than 0.10). The highest factor weight of 0.2907 was found for the factors type of port. The maximum value for the susceptibility index was 0.435219362 for Chittagong, and the minimum value was 0.076174 for Naogaon.

This is likely because of increases in fragility across biological repair systems and a weakened immune system, including loss of the cardiorenal protective arm of the renin--angiotensin system (RAS), composed of angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2)/angiotensin-(1--7) [Ang-(1--7)] and its actions through the Mas receptor. The purpose of this review is to explore how cardiac ACE2 changes with age, cardiac diseases, comorbid conditions and pharmaceutical regimens in order to shed light on a potential hormonal unbalance facilitating SARs-CoV-2 vulnerabilities in older adults. RECENT FINDINGS Increased ACE2 gene expression has been reported in human hearts with myocardial infarction, cardiac remodeling and heart failure. We also found ACE2 mRNA in atrial appendage tissue from cardiac surgical patients to be positively associated with age, elevated by certain comorbid conditions (e.g. COPD and previous stroke) and increased in conjunction with patients' chronic use of antithrombotic agents and thiazide diuretics but not drugs that block the renin--angiotensin system. SUMMARY Cardiac ACE2 may have bifunctional roles in COVID-19 as ACE2 not only mediates cellular susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection but also protects the heart via the ACE2/Ang-(1--7) pathway. Linking tissue ACE2 from cardiac surgery patients to their comorbid conditions and medical regimens provides a unique latform to address the influence that altered expression of the ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas receptor axis might have on SARs-CoV-2 vulnerability in older adults.","Wang, Hao; Saha, Amit K; Sun, Xuming; Kon, Neal D; Ferrario, Carlos M; Groban, Leanne",Current opinion in anaesthesiology,551,16

METHOD Data from Optum Clinformatics® Data Mart (2013-2016) were used for this retrospective cohort study. Diagnostic codes were used to identify adults (≥18y) with CP, incident cases of MAD, and covariates (other neurodevelopmental conditions, sleep disorders, arthritis). Pain (any type, location) was identified between 1st October 2014 and 30th September 2015. The pain group was divided into new or consistent pain if they had a history of pain (i.e. consistent) in the 12 months before their first pain claim date. Crude incidence rates of MAD (expressed per 100 person-years) were estimated. Cox regression was used to estimate hazard ratio (95% confidence interval [CI]) of MAD after adjusting for covariates. RESULTS Adults that had new pain (n=859; incidence rate=15.5) or consistent pain (n=1303; incidence rate=17.9) had greater crude incidence rate of MAD compared to adults without pain (n=3726; incidence rate=5.9). The elevated rate of MAD remained after adjusting for covariates, for new pain (hazard ratio=2.4; 95% CI=1.9-3.0) and consistent pain (hazard ratio=2.1; 95% CI=1.7-2.7). INTERPRETATION Pain is associated with greater incidence of MAD in adults with CP. This association remained after accounting for potential confounding factors. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS What this paper adds Pain was associated with higher 12-month incidence of mood affective disorders (MAD). The 12-month MAD incidence was similar between new and consistent pain groups.

This was previously referred to as post-intensive care syndrome-family. We systematically review randomized controlled trials for post-intensive care syndrome-family. DATA SOURCES Systematic research in databases (Pubmed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINHAL for articles published between January 2000 and October 2019). STUDY SELECTION Interventions in randomized controlled trials for post-intensive care syndrome-family in relatives of adult ICU patients. DATA EXTRACTION Review, quality assessment, and risk assessment for bias of eligible publications were performed along recommended guidelines for each investigation. Quality assessment graded studies into ""strong"" (n = 5), ""moderate"" (n = 4), and ""weak"" (n = 2). DATA SYNTHESIS Out of 2,399 publications, 11 investigations were found eligible (3,183 relatives of ICU patients). Studies addressed interventions during ICU stay (n = 6), during the post-ICU period (n = 4), or both (n = 1). Two studies included relatives of dying/deceased patients. One study implemented end-of-life conferences and showed reduced prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (45% vs 69%; p = 0.01), anxiety (45% vs 67%; p = 0.02), and depression (29% vs 56%; p = 0.003). Family conferences with a physician and proactive participation of a nurse reduced anxiety-scores (p = 0.01) without reducing anxiety prevalence (33.3% vs 52.3%; p = 0.08). Other studies failed to improve symptoms or reduce prevalence of post-intensive care syndrome-family. Interestingly, condolence letters may even increase prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (52.4% vs 37.1%; p = 0.03). Meetings without the presence of ICU physicians were shown to increase Impact of Event Scale-Revised scores (25.9 vs 21.3; p = 0.0495). CONCLUSIONS Only few data are available on interventions for post-intensive care syndrome-family. It appears that proactive communication and provision of information seems pivotal for post-intensive care syndrome-family treatment. Interestingly, some interventions may even worsen post-intensive care syndrome-family. In the light of the relevance of post-intensive care syndrome-family in daily ICU care, more high-quality data seems urgently needed.","Zante, Bjoern; Camenisch, Sabine A; Schefold, Joerg C",Critical care medicine,551,1

High-stakes clinical examinations, using live hands-on simulation scenarios and standardized patients (SPs) or other human role players, are accepted teaching and evaluation tools for NP students. Providing objective, valid, and reliable feedback to students during high-stakes clinical examinations is of considerable value for ongoing skill development. The study examined opportunities to improve the quality of student evaluation in simulation testing modes. A purposive sample of 17 video recordings of health students' comprehensive examination of an SP or physical examination teaching associate (PETA) from a nursing graduate level health assessment course was evaluated. Using a standardized rubric, students were scored live and after a comprehensive examination of a SP/PETA and via a secure web-based video platform by the faculty and an independent reviewer. Evaluator group examination score comparisons revealed that distributions of examination scores within evaluator groups were not similar. Median examination scores were significantly different between groups; faculty median examination scores significantly higher than SPs/PETAs. Efficiency of student evaluation may be increased by improving reviewer training, reducing checklist length, and adopting electronic scoring. Development of an exemplary teaching video providing explanation and detail for expected student skill performance will allow reviewers to practice and improve competence in reliable scoring, reduce time and effort of scorers, and increase accuracy of scoring.","Keiffer, Melanie; Anderson, Mindi; Eckhoff, Dawn O; Blackwell, Christopher W; Talbert, Steven; Parker, Ann Marie",Journal of the American Association of Nurse Practitioners,551,16

They also may cause simple and complicated lower respiratory infections, otitis media, asthma exacerbations, gastroenteritis, and a few systemic complications. These viruses are usually seasonal (with winter dominance) and affect nearly all age groups. The seasonal and annual variation in virus prevalence has implications for understanding the concept of acquired immunity and its persistence or diminution. Coronaviruses generally have outbreak potential in susceptible populations of any age, particularly in patients with comorbidities, who tend to have increased clinical disease. These 4 coronaviruses are often found in the context of what appears to be coinfection with other pathogens, but especially other viruses. If coronaviruses are not specifically tested for, the sole detection of a viral copathogen would suggest the pathogen is the causative agent, when a coronavirus may be culpable, or both. The detection of these viruses in circumstances where respiratory viruses are generally sought in clinical samples is, therefore, justified. These pathogens can be chronically shed from the respiratory tract, which is more likely to occur among immunocompromised and complicated patients. These viruses share the potential for genetic drift. The genome is among the largest of RNA viruses, and the capability of these viruses to further change is likely underestimated. Given the potential disease among humans, it is justified to search for effective antiviral chemotherapy for these viruses and to consider uses in niche situations should effective therapy be defined. Whereas SARS-CoV-2 may follow the epidemiological pattern of SARS-CoV and extinguish slowly over time, there is yet concern that SARS-CoV-2 may establish itself as an endemic human respiratory coronavirus similar to OC43, 2299E, NL63, and HKU1. Until sufficient data are acquired to better understand the potential of SARS-CoV-2, continued work on antiviral therapy and vaccination is imperative.","Cimolai, Nevio",Health security,551,16

Privatization, cutbacks in public-sector services and institutions, and public subsidization of private profit-making through transfer of tax revenues into private insurance corporations have worsened under neoliberal policies. Financialization of capitalist economies includes the increasingly oligopolistic and financialized character of health insurance, both public and private. Those struggling for just and accessible health systems now need to confront the shifting social class position of health professionals. Due to loss of control over the work process and a reduced ability to generate high incomes compared to other professional workers, the medical profession has become proletarianized.

Thus, despite the defective IL-2 environment in B/W F1 mice, generation of CTL and B cell depletion is feasible in NZB → F1 mice. The surprising increase in survival for NZW → F1 mice despite defective B cell elimination suggests that NZW splenocytes may contain a beneficial down regulatory cell.","Soloviova, Kateryna; Puliaeva, Irina; Puliaiev, Maksym; Puliaev, Roman; Via, Charles S",Cellular immunology,551,8

The objective of this study was to explore their perception on didactics and clinical training.Materials and Methods:A pretested and validated 26-item online survey that addressed COVID-19?s impact on didactic components and clinical management was sent to postgraduate students in the Indian subcontinent. The survey was available for 3 days, and the responses were collected and analyzed.Results:Overall, 165 out of 244 (67.62%) orthodontic postgraduate students completed the survey. Of them, 88.48% noted that orthodontic education and patient management are at stake because of the ensuing crisis. The majority (66.28%) acknowledged that Internet-based education will become the significant part of postgraduate coursework. With regard to patient care, 80% felt that 2-way communication channels and a guarded approach with strict infection control protocols may be the way forward during the crisis. Many preferred attending patients with space closure stage at the follow-up (51.23%) and to postpone new case start-ups until normalcy returns. About 55% of the respondents felt that clear aligners could transform into a popular orthodontic practice regimen if the crisis continues.Conclusions:Orthodontic postgraduate students were concerned that the crisis would go on and affect their education. They perceived transition of face-to-face didactic learning and summative assessments to online settings as a viable approach during the COVID-19 crisis. They felt that orthodontic clinical training would benefit from teleorthodontic approaches and prioritization of care and its alignment with crowd control.","Arunachalam, Sivakumar Gvd Harsha Sharan Jitendra Ghandikota Alekhya Ram Rsvm Raghu Praveen Gadde",Journal of Indian Orthodontic Society,551,33

The clinical laboratory staff have always played an important role in the laboratory diagnosis of patients. Currently, there are many research studies on the mental health of the first-line doctors or nurses managing the COVID-19 outbreak, both domestically and overseas, but data of the mental health and associated factors among the clinical laboratory staff who handle the blood or biological samples of confirmed cases and are consequently exposed to COVID-19 are limited. Methods: This cross-sectional survey-based study was performed via an online survey in a single designated hospital from April 20 to April 23, 2020 in Yiwu,China. The online survey included questions on sociodemographic and clinical variables. Totally, 45 clinical laboratory staff and 20 nonmedical health workers participated. Mental health variables were assessed via 4 Chinese versions of validated measurement tools : Zungs Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS), Zung's Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQ). Results: Significant differences were observed in the SDS and SAS scores, between the clinical laboratory staff and the nonmedical health workers (P &lt; .001, P &lt; .003, respectively). The scores for exposure risk and neuroticism of participants were the main factors influencing both the SDS scores of the clinical laboratory staff (P = .002, P = .005, respectively), and also their SAS scores (P = .003 P = .006, respectively). Conclusions: The results showed that a significant proportion of clinical laboratory staff experienced anxiety and depression symptoms. Their scores for mental health problems, exposure risk, and neuroticism were associated with severe symptoms of depression and anxiety. Therefore, the high-risk group of the clinical laboratory staff and those individuals with higher neuroticism scores may need special attention.","Cheng, C.; Rao, Y. B.; Lu, Y.

In this paper, we study the real-time cash replenishment planning problem under outflow uncertainty where the fee of the security companies grows if the replenishment ends up falling on a weekends/holidays. Our model is based by the Double Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm which combines popular Q-learning with a deep neural network. The proposed method is used to control replenishment operation in order to minimize replenishment cost where the cash demand changes dynamically at each day.

Variation in immune responses influence SARS-CoV-2 transmission and mortality, and factors shaping this variation at the country level, in addition to other socio-ecological drivers, may be important. Here, we construct spatially explicit Bayesian models that combine data on prevalence of endemic diseases and other socio-ecological characteristics to quantify patterns of confirmed deaths and cases across the globe before mass vaccination. We find that the prevalence of parasitic worms, human immunodeficiency virus and malaria play a surprisingly important role in predicting country-level SARS-CoV-2 patterns. When combined with factors such as population density, our models predict 63% (56-67) and 76% (69-81) of confirmed cases and deaths among countries, respectively. While our findings at this macro-scale are necessarily associative, they highlight a need for studies to consider factors, such as infection by other pathogens, on global SARS-CoV-2 dynamics. These relationships are vital for developing countries that already have the highest burden of endemic disease and are becoming the most affected by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","Fountain-Jones, N.

We explore the potential impacts of the pandemic on SDGs for Nepal. We followed a knowledge co-creation process with experts from various professional backgrounds, involving five steps: online survey, online workshop, assessment of expert's opinions, review and validation, and revision and synthesis. The pandemic has negatively impacted most SDGs in the short term. Particularly, the targets of SDG 1, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 13 have and will continue to have weakly to moderately restricting impacts. However, a few targets of SDG 2, 3, 6, and 11 could also have weakly promoting impacts. The negative impacts have resulted from impeding factors linked to the pandemic. Many of the negative impacts may subside in the medium and long terms. The key five impeding factors are lockdowns, underemployment and unemployment, closure of institutions and facilities, diluted focus and funds for non-COVID-19-related issues, and anticipated reduction in support from development partners. The pandemic has also opened a window of opportunity for sustainable transformation, which is short-lived and narrow. These opportunities are lessons learned for planning and action, socio-economic recovery plan, use of information and communication technologies and the digital economy, reverse migration and 'brain gain,' and local governments' exercising authorities.","Pradhan, Prajal Subedi Daya Raj Khatiwada Dilip Joshi Kirti Kusum Kafle Sagar Chhetri Raju Pandit Dhakal Shobhakar Gautam Ambika Prasad Khatiwada Padma Prasad Mainaly Jony Onta Sharad Pandey Vishnu Prasad Parajuly Keshav Pokharel Sijal Satyal Poshendra Singh Devendra Raj Talchabhadel Rocky Tha Rupesh Thapa Bhesh Raj Adhikari Kamal Adhikari Shankar Chandra Bastakoti Ram Bhandari Pitambar Bharati Saraswoti Bhusal Yub Raj Bahadur Bk Man Bogati Ramji Kafle Simrin Khadka Manohara Khatiwada Nawa Raj Chandra Lal Ajay Neupane Dinesh Neupane Kaustuv Raj Ojha Rajit Regmi Narayan Prasad Rupakheti Maheswar Sapkota Alka Sapkota Rupak Sharma Mahashram Shrestha Gitta Shrestha Indira Shrestha Khadga Bahadur Tandukar Sarmila Upadhyaya Shyam Kropp Jürgen P.; Bhuju, Dinesh Raj",Earth&#039;s Future,551,33

Exploiting emotional information has the potential to improve recommendation performances. However, conventional studies identified emotion as discrete representations, and could not predict users’ emotional states at time points when no user activity data exists, let alone the awareness of the influences posed by social events. In this study, we proposed an emotion-aware music recommendation method using deep neural networks (emoMR). We modeled a representation of music emotion using low-level audio features and music metadata, model the users’ emotion states using an artificial emotion generation model with endogenous factors exogenous factors capable of expressing the influences posed by events on emotions. The two models were trained using a designed deep neural network architecture (emoDNN) to predict the music emotions for the music and the music emotion preferences for the users in a continuous form. Based on the models, we proposed a hybrid approach of combining content-based and collaborative filtering for generating emotion-aware music recommendations. Experiment results show that emoMR performs better in the metrics of Precision, Recall, F1, and HitRate than the other baseline algorithms. We also tested the performance of emoMR on two major events (the death of Yuan Longping and the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases in Zhejiang).

Respondents were required to report their clinical activity during the three phases of the various Movement Control Order (MCO) imposed by the Malaysian government: namely the MCO, Conditional-MCO and the Recovery-MCO. Data was analysed with SPSS using descriptive and Chi-square tests. A total of 1548 dentists completed the survey. Five dentists reported being tested positive for COVID-19 test while 48 had one/more symptoms related to the disease. The majority perceived a real risk of COVID-19 transmission to dentists and more than 80% limited their clinical services to emergency/selective care during the MCO and C-MCO. About 17% of the dentists suspended face-to-face clinical activities during the MCO period but this figure dropped to 3.4% during the R-MCO. Clinical activities were limited mainly due to closure of workplaces (88.6%). Precautionary measures adopted at dental clinics included recording body temperature (54.2%), physical distancing in waiting rooms (84.6%) and hand washing prior to and after dental procedures (77.5%). The findings demonstrate that most dentists limited their clinical services during the MCO and resumed work once restrictions were lifted during the C-MCO and R-MCO.

This study describes variation in vaccination coverage by sociodemographic characteristics between December 2020 and August 2021. Methods: Using population-level administrative records linked to the 2011 Census, we estimated monthly first dose vaccination rates by age group and sociodemographic characteristics amongst adults aged 18 years or over in England. We also present a tool to display the results interactively. Findings: Our study population included 35,223,466 adults. A lower percentage of males than females were vaccinated in the young and middle age groups (18-59 years) but not in the older age groups. Vaccination rates were highest among individuals of White British and Indian ethnic backgrounds and lowest among Black Africans (aged [≥]80 years) and Black Caribbeans (18-79 years). Differences by ethnic group emerged as soon as vaccination roll-out commenced and widened over time. Vaccination rates were also lower among individuals who identified as Muslim, lived in more deprived areas, reported having a disability, did not speak English as their main language, lived in rented housing, belonged to a lower socio-economic group, and had fewer qualifications. Interpretation: We found inequalities in COVID-19 vaccination rates by sex, ethnicity, religion, area deprivation, disability status, English language proficiency, socio-economic position, and educational attainment, but some of these differences varied by age group. Research is urgently needed to understand why these inequalities exist and how they can be addressed.","Dolby, T.; Finning, K.; Baker, A.; Dowd, L.; Khunti, K.; Razieh, C.; Yates, T.; Nafilyan, V.",,551,14

Methods: In this longitudinal observational study, women who took part in the All Our Families pregnancy cohort in Canada were invited to complete a COVID-19 impact survey between May 20 and July 15, 2020. Women who had not agreed to additional research, had discontinued, were lost to follow-up, or who were not contactable via email were excluded. Maternal depression and anxiety symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic were compared with three previous estimates collected at 3, 5, and 8-year timepoints (between April, 2012, and October, 2019). Depression symptoms were assessed using the 10-item Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale and anxiety symptoms were assessed using the short form of the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Repeated cross-sectional analyses were done to assess temporal trends and fixed-effects regression models were fitted to assess within-person change over time. Findings: Of the 3387 women included in the All Our Families study, 2445 women were eligible and were invited to participate in the COVID-19 impact study, of whom 1333 consented to participate, and 1301 were included in the longitudinal analysis. At the COVID-19 impact survey timepoint, a higher proportion of mothers had clinically significant depression (35.21%, 95% CI 32.48-38.04) and anxiety symptoms (31.39%, 28.76-34.15) than at all previous data collection timepoints. The mean depression score (8.31, 95% CI 7.97-8.65) and anxiety score (11.90, 11.66-12.13) at the COVID-19 pandemic timepoint were higher than previous data collection waves at the 3-year timepoint (mean depression score 5.05, 4.85-5.25;mean anxiety score 9.51, 9.35-9.66), 5-year timepoint (mean depression score 5.43, 5.20-5.66;mean anxiety score 9.49, 9.33-9.65), and 8-year timepoint (mean depression score 5.79, 5.55-6.02;mean anxiety score 10.26, 10.10-10.42). For the within-person comparisons, depression scores were a mean of 2.30 points (95% CI 1.95-2.65) higher and anxiety scores were a mean of 1.04 points (0.65-1.43) higher at the COVID-19 pandemic timepoint, after controlling for time trends. Larger increases in depression and anxiety symptoms were observed for women who had income disruptions, difficulty balancing home schooling with work responsibilities, and those with difficulty obtaining childcare. White mothers had greater increases in anxiety scores than non-white mothers and health-care workers had smaller increases in depressive symptoms than non-health-care workers. Interpretation: Compared with previous estimates, the prevalence of maternal depression and anxiety among mothers in a Canadian cohort increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. Financial support, childcare provision, and avoiding the closure of schools, might be key priorities for preventing future increases in maternal psychological distress.

The country of 1.4 billion has passed 30.5 million COVID-19 infections and over 402,000 deaths. Even government figures are likely underestimated due to problems with testing and reporting in the country. Reasonable estimates due to under reporting and lack of testing put these figures at three times higher. The new cases and deaths are predicted to rise by September 2021. The situation is bad in the main cities, but also that it is worse in the poorer and rural areas where lack of healthcare resources has made those populations most vulnerable to the disease. There is an urgent need for rapid tests for quantification of infectiousness to triage patients. In traumatised India, saving lives has become the highest priority to be achieved by vaccinating 70 per cent of the adult population. Over 200 million population have been vaccinated. India's monthly COVID vaccine manufacturing capacity is about 60 - 65 million doses against the final requirement of 1.45 billion doses to cover 70 per cent adults. Even though the second surge is on a decline in most of the states, mucormycosis continues to be a public health concern. There are 41,000 mucormycosis cases reported during the second wave. Daily increase in Delta plus variant cases should alert the Policy-makers. It has a very high transmissibility. Genomic testing & surveillance of mutations to limit fresh twist of pandemic is a necessity. Only a few drugs have emerged as approved COVID-19 treatments. Where are we with drug treatment? Over 30 billion USD have been spent on vaccine development because it has a market. Very little is spent on research on drug discovery. There has not been any significant antibiotic molecule for the last two decades. Politics has played and continues to play a big part in the spread of the virus but it is a situation that needs a global approach.

The very logic of political, economic and cultural processes is changing under the influence of digital technologies. The main categories of culture are undergoing transformation as a result of the rapid rearrangement of the entire way of life. In some societies, the technological component has already begun modifying the civilizational values. Various digital products acquire subjective characteristics and, among other things, influence certain cultural categories overcoming their own ""natural"" boundaries (in the sense of being within the framework of traditional concepts of human nature), and embrace the entire space of the technosphere. The challenges in communication and cooperation, rivalry and competition between humans and artificial subjects of various kind, be they androids or operating systems, proceed from the field of sci-fi predictions to the social and cultural spheres, turning them into the subject of legal regulation. Thus, human nature is changing: humans integrate technologies into the methods of communication, living their own corporeity and turning themselves from Homo sapiens into ""inforgs"" and cyborgs. At the same time, the sociocultural space is rapidly expanding primarily in two directions: firstly, spreading into a virtual, digital area and, secondly, integrating artificial subjects into human culture. Such convergence causes tectonic changes in society, even without so much as prospects for a literal, physical expansion of horizons, which should soon be disclosed to humanity in connection with a new round of global plans for outer space exploration. However, so far, the multilevel deployment of the Ecumene does not effectively contribute to solution of global problems. Instead, these problems multiply, acquire an even larger scale and superimpose on one another, posing challenges to humanity, the price of which is the survival of civilization and human beings themselves. Is it possible that its essence lies in a parasitic nature destructive to everything around it? Will human beings, thanks to new opportunities, be able to preserve the best of themselves, getting rid of their own toxic origin? Or is the destructive charge so strong that the cumulative effect, enhanced by technologies, will destroy humanity and its dreams? Nowadays, the minds of politicians and scientists, artists, writers and filmmakers are occupied with these questions. The following article analyzes the ideas, expressed by great thinkers and supported by examples from modern movies and TV series, on the scenarios of the human future in terms of our ambiguous nature.","Gurov, O.

Another important feature of the sample preservative is that it inactivates all classes of pathogens, enabling safe transportation globally. Given the unique set of convenience, low cost, safety, and technical performance, this saliva metatranscriptomic test can be integrated into longitudinal, global scale, systems biology studies that will lead to an accelerated development of precision medicine diagnostic and therapeutic tools.

Upon binding dsDNA in the cytoplasm, cGAS and dsDNA form phase-separated aggregates in which cGAS catalyzes synthesis of 2’3’-cyclic GMP-AMP that subsequently triggers a STING-dependent, type I IFN response. Here, we showed that cytoplasmic RNAs, especially tRNAs, regulate cGAS activity. We discovered that RNAs did not activate cGAS but rather promoted phase separation in vitro. In cells, cGAS colocalized with RNAs and formed phase-separated granules even in the absence of cytoplasmic dsDNA. An Opti-prep gradient analysis of cell lysates showed that the endogenous cGAS was associated with cytoplasmic RNAs in an aggregative form. Further in vitro assays showed that RNAs compete for binding of cGAS with dsDNA and inhibit cGAS activity when the dsDNA concentration is high and promote the formation of phase separations and enhance cGAS activity when the dsDNA concentration is low. Thus, cytoplasmic RNAs regulate cGAS activity by interfering with formation of cGAS-containing aggregates.","Chen, Silian; Rong, Miao; Lv, Yun; Zhu, Deyu; Xiang, Ye",bioRxiv,551,8

Both the direct contact of the virus with the developing brain and the strong maternal immune response originated by viral infections can impair proper neurodevelopment. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the highly-infectious severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is currently responsible for a large global outbreak and is a major public health issue. While initial studies focused on the viral impact on the respiratory system, increasing evidence suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infects other organs and tissues including the mature brain. While studies continue to determine the neuropathology associated to COVID-19, the consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection to the developing brain remain largely unexplored. The present review discusses evidence suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 infection may have persistent effects on the course of pregnancy and on brain development. Studies have shown that several proinflammatory mediators which are increased in the SARS-CoV-2-associated cytokine storm, are also modified in other viral infections known to increase the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders. In this sense, further studies should assess the genuine effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy and delivery along with an extended follow-up of the offspring, including neurocognitive, neuroimaging, and electrophysiological examination. It also remains to be determined whether and by which mechanisms SARS-CoV-2 intrauterine and early life infection could lead to an increased risk of developing neuropsychiatric disorders, such as autism (ASD) and schizophrenia (SZ), in the offspring.","Figueiredo, Claudia P.; Fontes-Dantas, Fabrícia L.; da Poian, Andrea T.; Clarke, Julia R.",,551,1

After that, it set the relevant parameters of the basic SEIR model and the modified one and worked out the relevant differential equations and iterative equations. According to the feature of the epidemic situation and the changes in the number of contacts in different units of time, the epidemic data were substituted into the iterative equations for data fitting with an R Package. Then, analysis was performed on the epidemiological features such as the transmission time and epidemic peak and the epidemic trend was evaluated. Finally, sensitivity analysis was conducted on the parameters (government control and recovery rate), and the results showed that measures such as government restrictions on travel (reducing the contacts between virus carriers and susceptible persons) can effectively control the scale of the outbreak.

Evidence retrieved was focused on the risk of respiratory, cardiovascular, infective, hemostatic, and consciousness alterations related to the use of psychotropic medications. Furthermore, drug-drug interactions between psychotropic and medical treatments used in people with COVID-19 was reviewed and critically discussed by the working group.ResultsThe analysis of available evidence, although indirect, showed that all classes of psychotropic medications might carry relevant safety risks for people with COVID-19. The working group produced a set of 12 recommendations to support clinicians in the assessment of the anticipated risk of psychotropic-related unfavourable events, and how to practically manage this risk, including when it is appropriate to avoid, withdraw, switch, or adjust the dose of the medication.ConclusionsThe present evidence-based recommendations will improve the quality of psychiatric care in people with COVID-19, allowing an appropriate management of the medical condition without worsening the psychiatric condition and vice versa.DisclosureNo significant relationships.","Ostuzzi, G.; Papola, D.; Gastaldon, C.; Barbui, C.",European Psychiatry,551,16

However, there are barriers to these programs which limit their utilization, for both patients and HCW, specifically infectious disease concerns. The aim of the research project is to identify barriers and facilitators to AAI program use for healthcare worker benefit, and determine knowledge, beliefs, and practices regarding infectious disease risk and control policies, in order to understand the contextual parameters of program implementation. Methods: We collected perceptions of key stakeholders involved with hospital AAI programs (HCW and AAI workers) through semi-structured in-depth interviews. We used framework analysis to guide thematic coding, completed independently by three researchers. Results: We interviewed 37 participants. We divided our themes into two topic areas: program use for HCW and perceived infectious disease risk. Use for healthcare workers included perspectives on the benefits for HCW and program barriers and facilitators (specifically collaboration and leadership). Perceived risk included opinions on infection concerns with AAI, thoughts on control measures to reduce this risk, and responsibility for safety during these programs. Conclusions: While significant benefits were reported for HCW, they were limited by administrative barriers and hazard concerns. Facilitators to surmount these barriers are best implemented with collaboration across the hospital and appropriate leadership roles to direct safe program implementation. By addressing these barriers through targeted facilitators in the form of evidence-backed guidelines, AAI programs can be used to benefit both patients and HCW.","Dalton, K.

B-cell epitope identification with the help of an accurate prediction method can lead to an overall faster and cheaper vaccine design process, a crucial necessity in the covid-19 era. Consequently, several B-cell epitope prediction methods have been developed over the past few decades, but without significant success. In this study, we review the current performance and methodology of some of the most widely used linear B-cell epitope predictors which are available via a command-line interface, namely BcePred, BepiPred, ABCpred, COBEpro, SVMTriP, LBtope, and LBEEP. Additionally, we attempted to remedy performance issues of the individual methods by developing a consensus classifier, which combines the separate predictions of these methods into a single output, accelerating the epitope-based vaccine design. While the method comparison was performed with some necessary caveats and individual methods might perform much better for specialized datasets, we hope that this update in performance can aid researchers towards the choice of a predictor, for the development of biomedical applications such as designed vaccines, diagnostic kits, immunotherapeutics, immunodiagnostic tests, antibody production, and disease diagnosis and therapy.","Galanis, Kosmas A.; Nastou, Katerina C.; Papandreou, Nikos C.; Petichakis, Georgios N.; Pigis, Diomidis G.; Iconomidou, Vassiliki A.",bioRxiv,551,16

The researchers chose health cases related to Covid-19 instead of political issues (e.g. elections) to prove that this political polarization has spread to many areas. The research also wants to see the relationship between this political polarization and selective exposure. Theories applied in this study are polarization, filter bubble, and selective exposure. The study applied two methods: social media network analysis and content analysis. The network analysis included 82,156 posts, while the content analysis was carried out on 4,050 social media accounts. The research outcome proves the occurrence of political polarization. Social media users were divided into two major groups, namely pro-Jokowi and anti-Jokowi. Each group interacted with fellow users who had the same political choices and shared the same message content. Users with certain political choices tend to receive the same information as their political choices, and ignore information from other political parties. Another interesting finding from this study is how this polarization was sharpened by the use of hashtags. Each party (supporters and oppositions of Jokowi) uses hashtags to create solidarity and mobilization from each supporter. Research also proves the validity of the selective exposure and filter bubble hypothesis in the Indonesian context. © 2021 Complex Issues of Cardiovascular Diseases. All rights reserved.","Ali, D.

Whether COVID19 from Delta infection differs to infection with other variants in children is unknown. Methods Through the prospective COVID Symptom Study, 109,626 UK school-aged children were proxy-reported between December 28, 2020 and July 8, 2021. We selected all symptomatic children who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and were proxy-reported at least weekly, within two timeframes: December 28, 2020 to May 6, 2021 (Alpha (B.1.1.7) the main UK circulating variant); and May 26 to July 8, 2021 (Delta the main UK circulating variant). We assessed illness profiles (symptom prevalence, duration, and burden), hospital presentation, and presence of long (>28 day) illness; and calculated odds ratios for symptoms presenting within the first 28 days of illness. Findings 694 (276 younger [5 11 years], 418 older [12 17 years]) symptomatic children tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 with Alpha infection and 706 (227 younger and 479 older) children with Delta infection. Median illness duration was short with either variant (overall cohort: 5 days (IQR 2 9.75) with Alpha, 5 days (IQR 2 9) with Delta). The seven most prevalent symptoms were common to both variants. Symptom burden over the first 28 days was slightly greater with Delta compared with Alpha infection (in younger children, 3 (IQR 2 5) with Alpha, 4 (IQR 2 7) with Delta; in older children 5 (IQR 3 8) with Alpha and 6 (IQR 3 9) with Delta infection in older children). The odds of several symptoms were higher with Delta than Alpha infection, including headache and fever. Few children presented to hospital, and long illness duration was uncommon, with either variant. Interpretation COVID-19 in UK school-aged children due to SARSCoV2 Delta strain B.1.617.2 resembles illness due to the Alpha variant B.1.1.7., with short duration and similar symptom burden.","Molteni, E.; Sudre, C.

The virulent phage JD419 exhibits an elongated capsid and was able to infect and lyse 83 of all 129 tested clinical strains (64.3%) of multi-drug resistant S. aureus including MRSA. To evaluate the potential as a therapeutic phage, we tested the ability of phage JD419 to remain infectious after treatment exceeding physiological pH or temperature. The lytic activity of the phage was retained at pH values of 6.0-8.0 and at temperatures below 50°C. As phages sometimes contain virulence genes, we sequenced the complete genome of JD419. The 45509 bp genome contains a predicted 65 ORFs, none of which show homology to any known virulence or antibiotic resistance genes.

Methods: Public health officials in all 50 states, Washington, DC, and 8 territories, and a stratified, random sample of 822 local health departments (LHDs) were surveyed in 2019. Results: The response rates for the states/territories and LHDs were 75% (44/59) and 25% (206/822), respectively. About two-thirds to three-fourths of the state/territorial respondents stated that the feasibility and acceptability of implementing the NPIs were high, except for K-12 school closures lasting up to 6 weeks or 6 months. The LHD respondents also indicated that feasibility and acceptability were lowest for prolonged school closures. Compared to LHD respondents in suburban or urban areas, those in rural areas expressed lower feasibility and acceptability.

This is despite the fact that Turkey has a long history in Islamic civilisation. The legacy of strong Islamic law, the majority Muslim population, and the strategic location of the country have failed to serve as a catalyst to boost the market share of participatory banking in the country. The present study aims to explore problems, solutions, and strategies for developing PBs in Turkey. This research also captures the condition of PBs in facing the Covid-19 pandemic. The study adopts a qualitative method that uses library research benefitting from various sources of literature, namely books, journals, and other sources. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with experts including practitioners, regulators, and academicians who have direct involvement in PB. The findings are presented in the form of Strength-Weakness-Opportunity-Threat (SWOT) of PBs in Turkey. Interestingly, the preliminary finding shows that the problems of PBs in Turkey stem from both internal and external factors. Lack of understanding and skills, and lack of good Sharjah governance practices are the main internal factors. Lack of regulatory support, lack of public literacy, lack of academic research and educational institutions, and a regulatory system are the primary external factors. The study suggests two main solutions, namely internal and external solutions, as well as strategies to address the problems. This study could serve as a reference point for the regulator in formulating appropriate policy strategies to increase the market share of PB in Turkey.","Hassan, R.; Zulfahmi, Z.",Turkish Journal of Islamic Economics-Tujise,551,24

These included a national 'initial' lockdown (March-May), and 'ongoing' lockdown (July-November) for metropolitan Victorian residents only. Australia's experience offers an opportunity to assess impacts of lockdown on families with children, in the relative absence of disease morbidity and mortality. This study (1) described the experience of initial lockdown and (2) evaluated the impact of ongoing lockdown, on family finances and mental health. Methods: Data were drawn from the June and September 2020 Royal Children's Hospital National Child Health Polls. Caregivers of children from the states of Victoria and New South Wales reported on job/income loss; material deprivation (inability to pay for essential items); income-poverty; mental health (Kessler-6); impact on caregiver/child mental health; and caregiver/child coping. Data from N=1207/902 caregivers in June/September were analyzed; Aim (1) with weighted descriptives; Aim (2) with Difference-in-Difference adjusted linear regression models (New South Wales provided the comparator). Results: Following initial lockdown, one-quarter of families reported job/income loss; one-third reported material deprivation. Negative impacts on mental health were reported for half the caregivers and one-third of children. Few caregivers or children had difficulties coping. During Victoria's ongoing lockdown, job/income loss increased by 11% (95%CI: 3-18%); Kessler-6 poor mental health by 6% (95%CI: 0.3-12%) and negative mental health impacts by 12% for caregivers (95%CI: 6-23%) and 14% for children (95%CI: 4-20%). Female (versus male) caregivers, metropolitan (versus regional/rural) families, and families with elementary school-aged children (versus pre-/high-school) were most affected. Conclusions: Ongoing lockdown had negative impacts on mental health, employment, and income, but not deprivation or poverty, likely because of the government income supplements introduced early in the pandemic. Balancing the benefits and harms of lockdown requires planned responses to outbreaks, and evidence-informed financial and mental health supports.","Price, A.; Contreras-Suarez, D.; Zhu, A.; Schreurs, N.; Measey, M.-A.; Woolfenden, S.; Burley, J.; Bryson, H.; Efron, D.; Rhodes, A.; Goldfeld, S.",,551,13

Design: Prospective cohort Setting: Indiana University Bloomington (IUB), a public university of 34,660 students in southern Indiana. Participants: At the beginning of the fall 2020 semester, we randomly sampled N=1,267 IU undergraduate students, aged 18 years or older and residing in Monroe County, IN. Measurements: Primary exposure was high-risk alcohol consumption measured with the AUDIT questionnaire. We used an AUDIT score of 8 or more as the cut-off score when detecting high-risk alcohol consumption. Primary outcome was SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion, assessed with two SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests, at baseline and endline. Secondary outcomes were a) self-reported new SARS-CoV-2 infection at the study endline, and b) self-reported symptomatic COVID-19 at baseline. Findings: Prevalence of high-risk alcohol consumption was 34%. We found that students with high-risk alcohol consumption status had 2.34 [95% CI: (1.29, 4.24)] times the risk of SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion and 1.89 [95% CI: (1.08, 3.32)] times the risk of self-reporting a positive SARS-CoV-2 infection, compared to students with no such risk. Moreover, students with high-risk alcohol consumption were 18% more likely to develop symptomatic COVID-19, though this association was not statistically significant. Similar results were found after adjusting for sex at birth, race, and year in school. Findings from sensitivity analyses corroborated these results and suggested potential for a dose-response relationship. Conclusions: In this sample of American college students, high-risk alcohol consumption was associated with higher risk for SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion/infection. These findings could have implications for colleges' reopening planning in fall 2021.","Kianersi, S.; Ludema, C.; Macy, J. T.; Chen, C.; Rosenberg, M.",,551,24

Globally, no therapy such as vaccines and specific therapeutic agents is available so far despite some protease inhibitors and antiviral agents. Introduction: Due to no therapeutic drug or vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 so far, phytomedicine may be developed as therapeutic agents in the prevention and treatment of current COVID-19 disease. Thus, the aim of this study was to find out a suitable therapeutic agent from selected 17 dietary molecules, which could target SARS-CoV-2 encoded proteins. Materials and Methods: In this study, 3D structures of selected dietary molecules were obtained from the PubChem database, which have previously been reported for their antiviral and anti-inflammatory effects. Then, molecular docking analysis by using AutoDoc4 and AutoDockVina software was conducted to evaluate their anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. Lipinski's rule of five and drug-likeness properties were also discussed with the help of Molinspiration and the OSIRIS property explorer methods. Results: Our results revealed that, among all, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) (7) is a lead compound that could fit well into the binding sites of docked proteins of SARS-CoV-2. EGCG showed very strong molecular interactions with the free enzyme of main protease (6y2e), chimeric receptorbinding domain complexed with human ACE2 (6vw1), and NSP15 endoribonuclease (6vww) encoded proteins of SARS-CoV-2, by showing binding energies -9.30, -8.66, and -8.38, kcal/mole, respectively. Conclusion: In the present study, EGCG (7) is more active than two standard drugs that are currently being used in COVID 19, namely remdesivir and nafamostat. Therefore, EGCG (7), as per our results, might be explored as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of COVID-19.","Khan, M. F.; Khan, M. A.; Khan, Z. A.; Ahamad, T.; Ansari, W.

The skin is also the primary route of infection for a myriad of vector-borne diseases; thus cutaneous immune cells play a major role in modulating transmission for such infectious diseases. Several human pathogens that target the skin as a major route of infection are unable to infect traditional rodent models or recapitulate the pathogenesis in humans. It is well established that differences exist in human skin and immune cell biology compared to rodent models. Therefore, rodent (mouse and rat) models that incorporate human skin and immune cells would addressed the above discussed technical gap, and enable in vivo mechanistic studies of human host-skin pathogen interactions, and support the development of novel therapeutics. Here, we introduce the novel human Skin and Immune System (hSIS)-humanized NOD-scid IL2Rgnull (NSG) mouse and Sprague-Dawley-Rag2tm2hera Il2rgtm1hera (SRG) rat models, co-engrafted with full-thickness human fetal skin, autologous fetal lymphoid tissues, and fetal liver-derived hematopoietic stem cells. hSIS-humanized rodents support the development of adult-like, full-thickness human skin and human lymphoid tissues, and support human immune cell development. Furthermore, the engrafted human skin supports Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection, demonstrating the utility of these humanized rodent models in studying human disease.","Agarwal, Yash; Beatty, Cole; Ho, Sara; Thurlow, Lance; Das, Antu; Kelly, Samantha; Castronova, Isabella; Salunke, Rajeev; Biradar, Shivkumar; Yeshi, Tseten; Richardson, Anthony; Bility, Moses",bioRxiv,551,19

Among the available deep-sequencing technologies, nanopore-sequencing could be an important cornerstone, since it is mobile, scalable and acquisition investments are comparably low. Therefore, streamlined and efficient nanopore-sequencing protocols need to be developed and optimized for SARS-CoV-2 variants identification, in particular for smaller hospital laboratories with lower throughput. Results: We adapted and simplified existing workflows using the midnight 1,200 bp amplicon split primer sets for PCR, which produce tiled overlapping amplicons covering almost all of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Subsequently, we applied the Oxford Nanopore Rapid barcoding protocol and the portable MinION Mk1C sequencer in combination with the ARTIC bioinformatics pipeline. We tested the simplified and less time-consuming workflow on confirmed SARS-CoV-2-positive specimens from clinical routine and identified pre-analytical parameters, which may help to decrease the rate of sequencing failures. Duration of the complete pipeline was approx. 7 hrs for one specimen and approx. 11 hrs for 12 multiplexed barcoded specimens. Conclusions: The adapted protocol contains less processing steps. Diagnostic CT values are the principal criteria for specimen selection. Subsequent to diagnostic qRT-PCR, multiplex library preparation, quality controls, nanopore sequencing and the bioinformatic pipeline can be completely conducted within one working-day.","Pembaur, A.; Sallard, E.; Weil, P.

The frequency and function of NK cells were examined in generation 8 of pigs genetically selected for high (H), low (L), and control (C) antibody (Ab) and cell-mediated immune response (CMIR). The NK phenotype was identified using a pan-species NK-specific murine monoclonal antibody (5C6) and both binding and lysis of the NK target, K562. Vaccination with modified live transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) had no effect on blood leucocyte NK cell frequency. In interactions with K562 targets, NK cells of H and C pigs responded similarly in frequency of conjugate formation and lytic activity, while L pigs had very little or no response. Therefore, in pigs selected for high Ab and CMIR, there was no correlated enhancement of NK-cell-related traits following vaccination with TGEV, while selection for low immune response was associated with reduced NK response in pigs. This may suggest that low immune response can reflect reduced contribution of NK cells in pigs.","Raymond, C; Wilkie, B N",Natural immunity,551,1

Because the pulmonary pathology of porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) in pigs resembles SARS, we used PRCV as a model to clarify the effects of the corticosteroid dexamethasone (DEX) on coronavirus (CoV)-induced pneumonia. Conventional weaned pigs (n = 130) in one of four groups (PRCV/phosphate-buffered saline [PBS] [n = 41], PRCV/DEX [n = 41], mock/PBS [n = 23], and mock/DEX [n = 25]) were inoculated intranasally and intratracheally with the ISU-1 strain of PRCV (1 x 10(7) PFU) or cell culture medium. DEX was administered (once daily, 2 mg/kg of body weight/day, intramuscularly) from postinoculation day (PID) 1 to 6. In PRCV/DEX pigs, significantly milder pneumonia, fewer PRCV-positive cells, and lower viral RNA titers were present in lungs early at PID 2; however, at PID 4, 10, and 21, severe bronchointerstitial pneumonia, significantly higher numbers of PRCV-positive cells, and higher viral RNA titers were observed compared to results for PRCV/PBS pigs. Significantly lower numbers of CD2(+), CD3(+), CD4(+), and CD8(+) T cells were also observed in lungs of PRCV/DEX pigs than in those of PRCV/PBS pigs at PID 8 and 10, coincident with fewer gamma interferon (IFN-gamma)-secreting cells in the tracheobronchial lymph nodes as determined by enzyme-linked immunospot assay. Our results confirm that DEX treatment alleviates PRCV pneumonia early (PID 2) in the infection but continued use through PID 6 exacerbates later stages of infection (PID 4, 10, and 21), possibly by decreasing cellular immune responses in the lungs (IFN-gamma-secreting T cells), thereby creating an environment for more-extensive viral replication. These data have potential implications for corticosteroid use with SARS-CoV patients and suggest a precaution against prolonged use based on their unproven efficacy in humans, including possible detrimental secondary effects.","Jung, Kwonil; Alekseev, Konstantin P; Zhang, Xinsheng; Cheon, Doo-Sung; Vlasova, Anastasia N; Saif, Linda J",Journal of virology,551,28

Biomarkers are needed to effectively translate these promising therapies to clinical trials. Our objective was to investigate electrophysiological biomarkers of compound muscle action potential (CMAP), motor unit number estimation (MUNE) and electromyography (EMG) using an SMA mouse model. METHODS Sciatic CMAP, MUNE, and EMG were obtained in SMNΔ7 mice at ages 3-13 days and at 21 days in mice with SMN selectively reduced in motor neurons (ChATCre ). To investigate these measures as biomarkers of treatment response, measurements were obtained in SMNΔ7 mice treated with antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) or gene therapy. RESULTS CMAP was significantly reduced in SMNΔ7 mice at days 6-13 (p<0.01), and MUNE was reduced at days 7-13 (p<0.01). Fibrillations were present on EMG in SMNΔ7 mice but not controls (p=0.02). Similar findings were seen at 21 days in ChATCre mice. MUNE in ASO-treated SMNΔ7 mice were similar to controls at day 12 and 30. CMAP reduction persisted in ASO-treated SMNΔ7 mice at day 12 but was corrected at day 30. Similarly, CMAP and MUNE responses were corrected with gene therapy to restore SMN. INTERPRETATION These studies confirm features of preserved neuromuscular function in the early postnatal period and subsequent motor unit loss in SMNΔ7 mice. SMN restoring therapies result in preserved MUNE and gradual repair of CMAP responses. This provides preclinical evidence for the utilization of CMAP and MUNE as biomarkers in future SMA clinical trials.","Arnold, W David; Porensky, Paul N; McGovern, Vicki L; Iyer, Chitra C; Duque, Sandra; Li, Xiaobai; Meyer, Kathrin; Schmelzer, Leah; Kaspar, Brian K; Kolb, Stephen J; Kissel, John T; Burghes, Arthur H M",Annals of clinical and translational neurology,551,17

Although many infected persons traveled on commercial aircraft, the risk, if any, of in-flight transmission is unknown. METHODS We attempted to interview passengers and crew members at least 10 days after they had taken one of three flights that transported a patient or patients with SARS. All index patients met the criteria of the World Health Organization for a probable case of SARS, and index or secondary cases were confirmed to be positive for SARS-CoV on reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction or serologic testing. RESULTS After one flight carrying a symptomatic person and 119 other persons, laboratory-confirmed SARS developed in 16 persons, 2 others were given diagnoses of probable SARS, and 4 were reported to have SARS but could not be interviewed. Among the 22 persons with illness, the mean time from the flight to the onset of symptoms was four days (range, two to eight), and there were no recognized exposures to patients with SARS before or after the flight. Illness in passengers was related to the physical proximity to the index patient, with illness reported in 8 of the 23 persons who were seated in the three rows in front of the index patient, as compared with 10 of the 88 persons who were seated elsewhere (relative risk, 3.1; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.4 to 6.9). In contrast, another flight carrying four symptomatic persons resulted in transmission to at most one other person, and no illness was documented in passengers on the flight that carried a person who had presymptomatic SARS. CONCLUSIONS Transmission of SARS may occur on an aircraft when infected persons fly during the symptomatic phase of illness.

Inactivated vaccines, viral and bacterial vector vaccines, recombinant protein vaccines, subunit vaccines, DNA vaccines, and live-attenuated virus vaccines have been studied in different animal models. Although different animal models are used in vaccine studies, the most appropriate model for studying SARS is ferret since it develops the typical clinical signs, viral replication patterns and lung pathology compatible with that of SARS pathogenesis in humans. While there is much evidence that various vaccine strategies against SARS are safe and immunogenic, vaccinated animals still display significant disease upon challenge.

The first part of this review concentrates on known clinical and pathogenetic features of these infections. SIV is a primary respiratory pathogen; PRCV and PRRSV, on the contrary, tend to cause subclinical infections if uncomplicated but they appear to be important contributors to multifactorial respiratory diseases. The exact mechanisms whereby these viruses cause symptoms and pathology, however, remain unresolved. Classical studies of pathogenesis have revealed different lung cell tropisms and replication kinetics for each of these viruses and they suggest the involvement of different lung inflammatory responses or mediators. The proinflammatory cytokines interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha), tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-1 (IL-1) have been shown to play key roles in several respiratory disease conditions. The biological effects of these cytokines and their involvement in human viral respiratory disease are discussed in the second part of this review. The third part summarises studies that were recently undertaken in the authors' laboratory to investigate the relationship between respiratory disease in pigs and bioactive lung lavage levels of IFN-alpha, TNF-alpha and IL-1 during single and combined infections with the above viruses. In single SIV infections, typical signs of swine ""flu"" were tightly correlated with an excessive and coordinate production of the 3 cytokines examined. PRCV or PRRSV infections, in contrast, were subclinical and did not induce production of all 3 cytokines. Combined infections with these 2 subclinical respiratory viruses failed to potentiate disease or cytokine production. After combined inoculation with PRCV followed by bacterial lipopolysaccharide, both clinical respiratory disease and TNF-alpha/IL-1 production were markedly more severe than those associated with the respective single inoculations. Taken together, these data are the first to demonstrate that proinflammatory cytokines can be important mediators of viral respiratory diseases in pigs.","van Reeth, K; Nauwynck, H",Veterinary research,551,9

With an increased focus on online and virtual programming, there has been an uptick in social media usage by orthopaedics residencies as a means of communicating with applicants. This study investigated the growth in utilization of social media platforms by residency programs since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Instagram and Twitter were queried for each orthopaedic surgery residency program. It was determined if each program with a corresponding social media account was created before or after March 1, 2020. The number of posts per month were tabulated for accounts that existed prior to March 1, 2020. Results 187 orthopaedic surgery residency programs were identified using the AAMC ERAS database. Of these programs, 74 (41.6%) were found to have an Instagram profile, and 50 (26.7%) were found to have a Twitter page. Of the 74 Instagram profiles, 45 were created after March 1, 2020, representing a 155% increase. Of the 50 Twitter pages, 15 were created after March 1, 2020, representing a 43% increase. Instagram accounts that were active before the pandemic had a 96% increase in the number of posts per month, on average, after March 1, 2020. Conclusion Over one-third of programs are utilizing social media for recruitment purposes. There has been an 155% increase in Instagram and 43% increase in Twitter usage by residency programs since March 1, 2020. Instagram accounts created prior to the pandemic also demonstrated a near doubling of increased utilization after March. This represents a new, cost-effective way to connect with applicants in a time when in-person interactions are limited.Level of Evidence: III.","LeDuc, Ryan; Lyons, Madeline M; Riopelle, David; Wu, Karen; Schiff, Adam",The Iowa orthopaedic journal,551,1

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus type 3 (PIV3), and rhinovirus (RV) 14 were potent stimulators while cytomegalovirus and adenovirus only weakly stimulated and herpes simplex virus type 2 and bacteria did not stimulate IL-11 elaboration. IL-11 was not detected or barely detected in nasal aspirates from children without, but was detected in aspirates from children with viral upper respiratory tract infections. The levels of IL-11 were highest in patients with clinically detectable wheezing. IL-11 also caused nonspecific airways hyperresponsiveness in BALB/c mice. These studies demonstrate that three major causes of viral-induced asthma, RSV, RV, and PIV, in contrast to other viruses and bacteria, share the ability to induce stromal cell IL-11 production. They also demonstrate that IL-11 can be detected in vivo during viral respiratory infections, that the presence of IL-11 correlates with clinical bronchospasm and that IL-11 is a potent inducer of airways hyperresponsiveness. IL-11 may be an important mediator in viral airways disorders.","Einarsson, O; Geba, G P; Zhu, Z; Landry, M; Elias, J A",The Journal of clinical investigation,551,24

Community-acquired pneumonia is one of the more prevalent infections. RECENT FINDINGS The acquisition of infections in the tropics, including community-acquired pneumonias, has been described for several centuries. During recent decades some microorganisms have been disclosed as causative of the disease (Legionella pneumophila in 1976 and hantavirus in 1990); other microorganisms are real new pathogens that were not previously demonstrated to have a pathogenic role in humans (e.g. severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus producing an outbreak in 2003 and H5N1 avian influenza virus producing an increasing number of human cases over the last few years). SUMMARY A number of microorganisms may produce pneumonia in people who live or have traveled to tropical zones. History, including geography and epidemiology, physical exam and complementary workout are precious tools for the diagnosis, therapy and prevention. Exposure to microorganisms in tropical areas may show different patterns. A high index of suspicion, detailed investigation of travel, exposure history of the patient, and a basic understanding of the incubation periods and distribution of the various potential pathogens are imperative for the diagnosis.","Scrimini, Sergio; Junemann, Andrea; Luna, Carlos M",Current opinion in pulmonary medicine,551,7

Little information is available on SARS-CoV papain-like protease 2 (PLP2), and development of inhibitors against PLP2 is attractive for antiviral therapy. Here, we report the characterization of SARS-CoV PLP2 (from residues 1414 to 1858) purified from baculovirus-infected insect cells. We demonstrate that SARS-CoV PLP2 by itself differentially cleaves between the amino acids Gly180 and Ala181, Gly818 and Ala819, and Gly2740 and Lys2741 of the viral polypeptide pp1a, as determined by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography analysis coupled with mass spectrometry. This protease is especially selective for the P1, P4, and P6 sites of the substrate. The study demonstrates, for the first time among coronaviral PLPs, that the reaction mechanism of SARS-CoV PLP2 is characteristic of papain and compatible with the involvement of the catalytic dyad (Cys)-S(-)/(His)-Im(+)H ion pair. With a fluorogenic inhibitor-screening platform, we show that zinc ion and its conjugates potently inhibit the enzymatic activity of SARS-CoV PLP2. In addition, we provided evidence for evolutionary reclassification of SARS-CoV. The results provide important insights into the biochemical properties of the coronaviral PLP family and a promising therapeutic way to fight SARS-CoV.","Han, Yu-San; Chang, Gu-Gang; Juo, Chiun-Gung; Lee, Hong-Jen; Yeh, Shiou-Hwei; Hsu, John Tsu-An; Chen, Xin",Biochemistry,551,16

Cultures containing CNS cells were infected with mouse hepatitis virus-JHM, which causes fatal encephalitis in mice. Immunostaining indicated that viral infection had a limited effect on culture characteristics, overall cell survival, or cell morphology at the early postinfection times studied. Results from Affymetrix gene array analysis, assessed on RNA isolated from virally and sham-infected cultures, were compared with parallel protein assays for cytokine, chemokine, and cell surface markers. Of the 126 transcripts found to be differentially expressed between viral and sham infections, the majority were related to immunological responses. Virally induced increases in interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha mRNA and protein expression correlated with the genomic induction of acute-phase proteins. Genomic and protein analysis indicated that viral infection resulted in prominent expression of neutrophil and macrophage chemotactic proteins. In addition, mRNA expression of nonclassical class I molecules H2-T10, -T17, -M2, and -Q10, were enhanced three- to fivefold in virus-infected cells compared to sham-infected cells. Thus, upon infection, resident brain cells induced a breadth of innate immune responses that could be vital in directing the outcome of the infection and, in vivo, would provide signals which would summon the peripheral immune system to respond to the infection. Further understanding of how these innate responses participate in immune protection or immunopathology in the CNS will be critical in efforts to intervene in severe encephalitis.","Rempel, J D; Quina, L A; Blakely-Gonzales, P K; Buchmeier, M J; Gruol, D L",Journal of virology,551,24

In order to plan proper portfolio diversification in international financial markets, researchers must examine COVID-19 anxiety in relation to stock market volatility. The stock market volatility connected with the COVID-19 pandemic was measured using AR(1)-GARCH(1,1). COVID-19 fear, according to our research, is the ultimate driver of public attention and stock market volatility. The findings show that throughout the pandemic, stock market performance and GDP growth both declined significantly due to average increases. Furthermore, a 1% increase in COVID-19 causes a 0.8% and 0.56% decline in stock return and GDP, respectively. The stock market, on the other hand, showed a slight movement in GDP growth. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic reported cases index, death index, and global panic index all influenced public perceptions of purchasing and selling. As a result, rather than investing in stocks, it is recommended that you invest in gold. The research also makes policy recommendations for important stakeholders. We look to examine how stock returns respond dynamically to unanticipated changes in the COVID-19 scenarios, as well as the uncertainty that comes with a pandemic. Using daily data from Canada and the USA, we conclude that a spike in COVID-19 instances has a negative impact on the stock market in general. Furthermore, in both the increase and decline scenarios in Canada, the stock return reactions are asymmetric. The disparity is due to the unfavorable impact of the pandemic's unpredictability. We also discovered that uncertainty had a negative impact on the US stock market.

The current study aimed to describe changes in family rules and routines during the first year of pediatric cancer treatment, and to explore associations with demographics, illness factors, and caregiver distress. METHODS: This exploratory mixed-methods, cross-sectional study examined 44 primary caregivers of youth in treatment for a new cancer diagnosis in 2019 and 2020, before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Caregivers completed validated questionnaires assessing demographic and child illness characteristics, psychosocial distress, and cancer-related stressors, and participated in a semi-structured interview about family rules and routines. RESULTS: Caregivers reported changes in bedtime, mealtime, and school routines, relaxed behavioral expectations and rules around screen time, and new rules and routines around treatment, medications, and infection control. Caregivers with elevated levels of psychosocial distress reported more changed routines than caregivers with low levels of psychosocial distress. Caregivers who endorsed more cancer-related stressors reported more new rules and routines than those who reported fewer cancer-related stressors. Demographic and illness factors were not significantly associated with the number of changed, new, or stable family rules and routines. CONCLUSIONS: Families may relax rules and routines during the first several months of diagnosis, and this may be related to side effects of treatment and limited caregiver capacity. The long-term impact of changes in family rules and routines during cancer treatment warrants further study given that accommodating parenting strategies have been associated with adverse short- and long-term child health and behavior outcomes.","Bates, Carolyn R; Pallotto, Isabella K; Moore, Rachel M; Fornander, Mirae J; Covitz, Lynne M; Dreyer Gillette, Meredith L",Psycho-oncol.

Thus, pharmaceutical formulators are constantly looking for new, biologically acceptable, and low-cost armamentarium for parenteral formulation development. Cyclodextrins (CDs) are enabling pharmaceutical excipients that can temporarily camouflage undesirable physiochemical drug properties such as low aqueous solubility through formation of drug/CD inclusion complexes. CDs are cyclic oligosaccharides that have similar physiological and biological properties like linear saccharides of comparable molecular weight. Due to their very favorable toxicological and pharmacokinetic profiles their usage in parenteral drug formulations is frequently preferred over other solubilizing techniques. Here the physiochemical and biological properties of CDs are reviewed as well as their pharmacokinetics after intravenous administration. Their regulatory status is briefly reviewed and their tendency to self-assemble to form clusters or aggregates discussed. Finally, some examples are given of how CDs are applied in aqueous parenteral formulations, how their solubilizing effect has been enhanced and how their target concentration is determined.","Loftsson, Thorsteinn",J. pharm. sci,551,16

Unexpectedly, we documented improvement of respiratory performance and lung high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) showed significant regression of the diffuse pulmonary ground-glass opacity. The hypothetical mechanism is that iloprost can enhance perfusion preferentially to well-ventilated lung regions, reduce pressures of peripheral pulmonary vessels and induce reduction of lung interstitial edema. In addition, iloprost antithrombotic effect, endothelial damage repairing and neo-angiogenesis activity could play a relevant role.","Filippini, Alida; Bnà, Claudio; Bellosta, Raffaello; Bazzani, Roberto; Luzzani, Luca; Pegorer, Matteo Alberto; Zandalasini, Matteo; Baldon, Michela; Codazzi, Manuela; Sabatini, Tony",Respir Med Case Rep,551,1

Objective: Here we describe the differences between rRT-PCR results for SARS-CoV-2 infection in normal and diluted samples, simulating the need for dilution due to the presence of amplification inhibitors. Material and method: Viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) from samples of nasopharyngeal swabs from 20 patients previously detected as ""Negative"" and 21 patients detected as ""Positive"" for SARS-CoV-2 was performed with the EasyExtract DNA-RNA kit (Interprise®). The rRT-PCR was performed with the OneStep/COVID-19 kit (IBMP), with normal and diluted (80 µl of H2O RNAse free) samples, totaling 82 tests. Results: The results indicate that there is an average variation (a &lt; 0.05) delaying the Cq between the results of amplification of the internal control (IC), N gene (NG), and ORF1ab (OF), 1.811 Cq, 3.840 Cq, and 3.842 Cq, respectively. Discussion: The extraction kit does not completely purify the inhibitor compounds; therefore, no amplified product result may occur. In this study, we obtained a 19.04% false-negative diagnosis after sample dilution; this process reduces the efficiency of rRT-PCR to 29.8% in detecting SARS-CoV-2. Conclusion: Knowing the rRT-PCR standards of diluted samples can assist in the identification of false-negative cases and, consequently, avoid incorrect diagnosis.","Fruehwirth, Marcelo; Rivas, Açucena V.; Fitz, Andressa F.

BACKGROUND: COVID-19 placed nurses at the forefront of battling this pandemic in the intensive care unit (ICU). Emerging international evidence suggests nurses experience psychological and physical symptoms as a result of caring for these patients. METHODS: A qualitative descriptive design was used. Using purposive sampling, 11 nurses from one ICU participated in semi-structured interviews. Interviews were recorded and coded; data were analyzed using content analysis. An audit trail was maintained and member checking was employed. RESULTS: The experiences among critical care nurses caring for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were categorized into five themes and subthemes. Emotions experienced was subcategorized into anxiety/stress, fear, helplessness, worry, and empathy. Physical symptoms was subcategorized into sleep disturbances, headaches, discomfort, exhaustion, and breathlessness. Care environment challenges was subcategorized into nurse as surrogate, inability to provide human comforting connection, patients dying, personal protective equipment (PPE), isolation, care delay, changing practice guidelines, and language barrier. Social effects was subcategorized into stigma, divergent healthcare hero perception, additional responsibilities, strained interactions with others, and isolation/loneliness. Short term coping strategies was subcategorized into co-worker support, family support, distractions, mind/body wellness, and spiritualty/faith. CONCLUSION: ICU nurses are experiencing intense psychological and physical effects as a result of caring for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in a challenging care environment. Outside of work, nurses faced pandemic-induced societal changes and divergent public perceptions of them.","Gordon, Jacqueline M; Magbee, Terry; Yoder, Linda H",Appl Nurs Res,551,1

Our aim is to investigate the prevalence of anxiety in medical students during this pandemic. This systematic review and mini meta-analysis has been conducted following the PRISMA guidelines. Two researchers independently searched PubMed on 26 August 2020 for cross-sectional studies on medical students during the COVID-19 outbreak, with no language restrictions applied. We then performed a manual search to detect other potentially eligible investigations. To the 1361 records retrieved in the initial search, 4 more were added by manual search on medRxiv. Finally, eight studies were finally included for qualitative and quantitative analysis, which yielded an estimated prevalence of anxiety of 28% (95% CI: 22-34%), with significant heterogeneity between studies. The prevalence of anxiety in medical students is similar to that prior to the pandemic but correlates with several specific COVID-related stressors. While some preventive and risk factors have been previously identified in a non-pandemic context, knowledge and cognitions on COVID-19 transmission, treatment, prognosis and prevention negatively correlate with anxiety, emerging as a key preventive factor that may provide a rationale for why the levels of anxiety have remained stable in medical students during the pandemic while increasing in their non-medical peers and the general population. Other reasons for the invariability of anxiety rates in this population are discussed. A major limitation of our review is that Chinese students comprised 89% the total sample, which could compromise the external validity of our work.","Lasheras, Isabel; Gracia-García, Patricia; Lipnicki, Darren M; Bueno-Notivol, Juan; López-Antón, Raúl; de la Cámara, Concepción; Lobo, Antonio; Santabárbara, Javier",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),551,16

To perform this analysis, we use two methods, one based on cross-correlation of the strain channels in the two nearly aligned LIGO detectors, and one that looks for excess power in the strain channels of the LIGO and Virgo detectors. The excess power method optimizes the Fourier Transform coherence time as a function of frequency, to account for the expected signal width due to Doppler modulations. We do not find any evidence of dark photon dark matter with a mass between $m_{\rm A} \sim 10^{-14}-10^{-11}$ eV/$c^2$, which corresponds to frequencies between 10-2000 Hz, and therefore provide upper limits on the square of the minimum coupling of dark photons to baryons, i.e. $U(1)_{\rm B}$ dark matter. For the cross-correlation method, the best median constraint on the squared coupling is $\sim1.31\times10^{-47}$ at $m_{\rm A}\sim4.2\times10^{-13}$ eV/$c^2$; for the other analysis, the best constraint is $\sim 1.2\times 10^{-47}$ at $m_{\rm A}\sim 5.7\times 10^{-13}$ eV/$c^2$. These limits improve upon those obtained in direct dark matter detection experiments by a factor of $\sim100$ for $m_{\rm A}\sim [2-4]\times 10^{-13}$ eV/$c^2$.","Collaboration, The LIGO Scientific; Collaboration, the Virgo; Abbott, the KAGRA Collaboration R.; Abbott, T.

We believe that our example, as first and hardest hit country, might be a warning and aid not only for those who have been hit later, but also for a second fearful wave of contagion. In addition, we want to offer an insight on modifiable risk factors for HWs-related infection. METHODS: Demographic, lifestyle, work-related and comorbidities data of 1447 HCWs, which underwent a nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2, were retrospectively collected. For the 164 HCWs positive for SARS-CoV-2, data about safety in the workplace, symptoms and clinical course of COVID-19 were also collected. Cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was estimated. Risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection were assessed using a multivariable Poisson regression. RESULTS: The cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among the screened HCWs was 11.33% (9.72-13.21). Working in a COVID-19 ward, being a former smoker (versus being a person who never smoked) and BMI was positively associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, whereas being a current smoker was negatively associated with this variable. CONCLUSIONS: Assuming an equal accessibility and proper use of personal protective equipment of all the HCWs of our Hospital, the great and more prolonged contact with COVID-19 patients remains the crucial risk factor for SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, increased and particular care needs to be focused specifically on the most exposed HCWs groups, which should be safeguarded. Furthermore, in order to limit the risk of asymptomatic spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the HCWs mild symptoms of COVID-19 should be considered when evaluating the potential benefits of universal staff testing.","Colaneri, Marta; Novelli, Viola; Cutti, Sara; Muzzi, Alba; Resani, Guido; Monti, Maria Cristina; Rona, Claudia; Grugnetti, Anna Maria; Rettani, Marco; Rovida, Francesca; Zuccaro, Valentina; Triarico, Antonio; Marena, Carlo",J. public health (Oxf),551,20

211224,211224,211224,Advocating for Patients at End of Life During COVID-19,16.430834,5.6397204,2021,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted people's lives at unprecedented speed and scale, including how they eat and work, what they are concerned about, how much they move, and how much they can earn. Traditional surveys in the area of public health can be expensive and time-consuming, and they can rapidly become outdated. The analysis of big data sets (such as electronic patient records and surveillance systems) is very complex. Google Trends is an alternative approach that has been used in the past to analyze health behaviors; however, most existing studies on COVID-19 using these data examine a single issue or a limited geographic area. This paper explores Google Trends as a proxy for what people are thinking, needing, and planning in real time across the United States. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to use Google Trends to provide both insights into and potential indicators of important changes in information-seeking patterns during pandemics such as COVID-19. We asked four questions: (1) How has information seeking changed over time? (2) How does information seeking vary between regions and states? (3) Do states have particular and distinct patterns in information seeking? (4) Do search data correlate with-or precede-real-life events? METHODS: We analyzed searches on 38 terms related to COVID-19, falling into six themes: social and travel; care seeking; government programs; health programs; news and influence; and outlook and concerns. We generated data sets at the national level (covering January 1, 2016, to April 15, 2020) and state level (covering January 1 to April 15, 2020). Methods used include trend analysis of US search data; geographic analyses of the differences in search popularity across US states from March 1 to April 15, 2020; and principal component analysis to extract search patterns across states. RESULTS: The data showed high demand for information, corresponding with increasing searches for coronavirus linked to news sources regardless of the ideological leaning of the news source. Changes in information seeking often occurred well in advance of action by the federal government. The popularity of searches for unemployment claims predicted the actual spike in weekly claims. The increase in searches for information on COVID-19 care was paralleled by a decrease in searches related to other health behaviors, such as urgent care, doctor's appointments, health insurance, Medicare, and Medicaid. Finally, concerns varied across the country; some search terms were more popular in some regions than in others. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 is unlikely to be the last pandemic faced by the United States. Our research holds important lessons for both state and federal governments in a fast-evolving situation that requires a finger on the pulse of public sentiment. We suggest strategic shifts for policy makers to improve the precision and effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions and recommend the development of a real-time dashboard as a decision-making tool.","Mangono, Tichakunda; Smittenaar, Peter; Caplan, Yael; Huang, Vincent S; Sutermaster, Staci; Kemp, Hannah; Sgaier, Sema K",J Med Internet Res,551,16

To understand the impact of autophagy modulation on a rainbow trout gill cell line, RTgill-W1, treatments including reduced nutrition (2% fetal bovine serum compared with 10% control), rapamycin, 3-methyladenine, deoxynivalenol, and chloroquine were tested. Western blot and immunofluorescence were used to detect microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain protein and quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to detect the expression of 10 autophagy-related genes. At 3-d post-treatment, reduced nutrition significantly (p < 0.05) increased autophagy while deoxynivalenol significantly (p < 0.01) suppressed it compared to controls. These phenomena were confirmed by using immunofluorescence to detect the number of autophagosomes in RTgill-W1. Chloroquine is critical to allow observation of microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain protein in this model. The commonly used autophagy-modulating chemicals rapamycin and 3-methyladenine either activated or suppressed microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain protein, respectively, as expected from the literature, but did not act in a consistently significant manner. Expression of five of the 10 Atg genes, including lc3, gabarap, atg4, atg7, and atg12, were altered in a similar pattern to microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain protein. The consistent trend of autophagy-related gene upregulation including becn1, lc3, gabarap, and atg9 following treatment with 3-methyladenine and chloroquine is suggestive of a novel feedback regulation in the autophagy machinery.","Liu, Juan-Ting; Balmori-Cedeno, Jaramar; Misk, Ehab; Lumsden, John S","In vitr. cel. dev. biol., Anim",551,12

Our diet contains many natural antioxidants which along with providing support for proper growth and functioning of the body, pose additional health benefits. Present in-silico analysis depicted that natural antioxidants like sesamin, ellagic acid, capsaisin, and epicatechin along with galangin, exhibited significant binding at the catalytic site of the Mpro enzyme. They interacted with excellent efficiency with the chief active site residue Cys145 and thus seem to possess the remarkable potential to act as drug candidates for the treatment of Covid-19. Such dietary compounds can be easily administered orally with least toxicity related concern and thus yell for urgent exhaustive research to develop into efficient therapies.

The authors demonstrate how a cancer center in the largest city in Brazil has managed outpatient appointments during the COVID-19 pandemic. This is a retrospective study of patients who had their appointments through telemedicine at the AC Camargo Cancer Center between June 2020 and October 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Of the 77 patients who had telemedicine appointments, 36 (46.8%) accounted for breast cancer follow-up, 20 (26%) for breast cancer screening, 10 (13%) for benign breast disease evaluation, 7 (9%) for a second opinion, and 4 (5.2%) for general orientations. Routine surveillance/follow-up exams were requested for 45 (58.4%) patients and breast image exams and a request to return for a personal appointment for 30 (39%) patients. Two (2.6%) patients were requested to schedule a personal appointment immediately for a physical exam. In conclusion, telemedicine may be a feasible alternative to reduce personal outpatient appointments for cancer follow-up and breast cancer screening during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Sonagli, Marina; Cagnacci Neto, Renato; Leite, Fernanda Perez Magnani; Makdissi, Fabiana Baroni Alves",J. surg. oncol,551,1

The coronavirus S protein mediates viral entry into target cells employing the host cellular serine protease TMPRSS2 for S-protein priming. The TMPRSS2 gene expression is responsive to androgen stimulation and it could partially explain sex differences. We hypothesized that men chronically exposed to 5-alpha reductase inhibitors (5ARIs) for benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) have a lower risk of hospitalization for COVID-19. METHODS: This is a population-based case-control study on consecutive patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 virus who required hospitalization for COVID-19 (cases), age-matched to beneficiaries of the Lombardy Regional Health Service (controls). Data were collected by two high-volume COVID-19 regional centers of Lombardy (Italy). The primary outcome was to compare the prevalence of patients chronically exposed to 5ARIs, who required hospitalization for COVID-19, with the one of controls. RESULTS: Overall, 943 males were enrolled; 45 (4.77%) were exposed to 5ARI. COVID-19 patients aged >55 years under 5ARI treatment were significantly less than expected on the basis of the prevalence of 5ARI treatment among age-matched controls (5.57 vs. 8.14%; p=0.0083, 95%CI=0.75-3.97%). This disproportion was higher for men aged >65 (7.14 vs. 12.31%; p=0.0001, 95%CI=2.83-6.97%). Eighteen 5ARIs-patients died; the mean age of men who died was higher than those who did not: 75.98±9.29 vs. 64.78±13.57 (p<0.001).

The pandemic and its fallout have laid bare deep-seated social and economic inequalities with marginalised groups being at greater risk of infection and being disproportionately affected by containment measures and their socioeconomic consequences. Stigma is a central element to such inequalities but remains largely overlooked in the debate on the response to COVID-19, including in LMICs. Yet we know from experiences with other infectious diseases such as HIV/AIDS and Ebola that disease-related stigma is detrimental to halting and controlling pandemics and achieving equitable development. Emerging evidence suggests that stigma associated with COVID-19 is already taking hold. This paper assesses potential driving factors of COVID-19-related stigma, and how this intersects with existing stigma fault lines and explores mechanisms through which COVID-19-related stigma may be counteracted, with a focus on LMICs.","Roelen, Keetie; Ackley, Caroline; Boyce, Paul; Farina, Nicolas; Ripoll, Santiago",Eur J Dev Res,551,14

It is postulated to investigate the factors limiting the development of the indicated adverse effects. One of the psychological resources that may have a significant, pro-health character in relation to mental functioning is ego-resiliency (ER). It is described as a personality trait associated with a high ability to adequately regulate self-control, depending on the conditions. There are studies providing information about the prohealth, adaptive nature of ER during the COVID­19 period. The aim of the study was to assess the relationships between ER and anxiety, the tendency to use alcohol and aggression in the group of Polish people in the initial lockdown period in Poland. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Overall, 538 adult Polish people participated in the study. The Ego-Resiliency Scale referred to as ER89-R12, according to Block's concept, was used to measure ER. The other scales used were the General Anxiety Disorder Scale, the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test, and the Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire. Statistical analyses were performed using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient, the multiple regression procedure, the Mann-Whitney U test and the Kruskal-Wallis rank ANOVA. Cronbach's &#945; coefficients were also assessed. RESULTS: Statistically significant negative relationships between ER and the severity of anxiety symptoms and generalized aggression were found. There was a weak positive relationship between ER and the tendency to use alcohol. Among the surveyed Polish people, higher ER was characteristic of the older respondents (aged >29 years) and people with higher education. CONCLUSIONS: Ego-resiliency in the times of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic can counteract the development of anxiety and aggression. Optimal regulation seems to play an important role in this relationship. The relationship between resiliency and the tendency to use alcohol requires further observation.

These patients are restricted in performing daily activities due to angina pectoris. Spinal cord stimulation is a last resort treatment option. A number of this patient population also has an indication for a cardiac implanted electronic device (CIED) (pacemaker or implantable cardiac defibrillator). Manufacturers of spinal cord stimulators have stated a warning that interference can occur between the spinal cord stimulator and the CIED. Consequently, only a limited number of patients with RAP and a CIED have received a spinal cord stimulator. The aim of this retrospective cohort study is to determine whether spinal cord stimulation can be safely used in patients with RAP and a CIED. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All patients with RAP referred to our center were screened and included if 1) the patient received a spinal cord stimulator as treatment for RAP and if 2) the patient received a CIED either prior to or after spinal cord stimulator implantation. A transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) treadmill test was used as screening tool to determine whether the patient was eligible for implantation of a spinal cord stimulator. Interference between the spinal cord stimulator and CIED was checked 1) after TENS treadmill test, 2) during implantation of spinal cord stimulator or CIED, 3) during mode switches of the SCS, and 4) during regular out-patient follow-up. RESULTS: In total, 22 patients had both a spinal cord stimulator and a CIED with an average follow-up duration of 44.5 months. No interference between the spinal cord stimulator and CIED was found. CONCLUSION: Spinal cord stimulation can be safely applied in patients with a CIED provided that the CIED is checked for interference during implantation, if mode switches of the SCS occurred and once yearly after implantation according to routine follow-up.","Vervaat, Fabienne E; van Suijlekom, Hans; Wijnbergen, Inge",Neuromodulation,551,24

The second outbreak started in July, was associated with North Africa, and involved travelers and an outbreak on passenger ships. This suggested the involvement of a new viral variant. METHODS: We sequenced the genomes from 916 SARS-CoV-2 strains from COVID-19 patients in our institute. The patients' demographic and clinical features were compared according to the infecting viral variant. RESULTS: From June 26th to August 14th, we identified a new viral variant (Marseille-1). Based on genome sequences (n = 89) or specific qPCR (n = 53), 142 patients infected with this variant were detected. It is characterized by a combination of 10 mutations located in the nsp2, nsp3, nsp12, S, ORF3a, ORF8 and N/ORF14 genes. We identified Senegal and Gambia, where the virus had been transferred from China and Europe in February-April as the sources of the Marseille-1 variant, which then most likely reached Marseille through Maghreb when French borders reopened. In France, this variant apparently remained almost limited to Marseille. In addition, it was significantly associated with a milder disease compared to clade 20A ancestor strains, in univariate analysis. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 can genetically diversify rapidly, its variants can diffuse internationally and cause successive outbreaks.","Colson, Philippe; Levasseur, Anthony; Gautret, Philippe; Fenollar, Florence; Thuan Hoang, Van; Delerce, Jeremy; Bitam, Idir; Saile, Rachid; Maaloum, Mossaab; Padane, Abdou; Bedotto, Marielle; Brechard, Ludivine; Bossi, Vincent; Ben Khedher, Mariem; Chaudet, Hervé; Million, Matthieu; Tissot-Dupont, Hervé; Lagier, Jean-Christophe; Mboup, Souleymane; Fournier, Pierre-Edouard; Raoult, Didier",Travel Med Infect Dis,551,24

METHODS: An electronic survey including closed and open-ended questions was distributed to physical therapists employed in a range of health care settings across the United States. RESULTS: Physical therapy use and process of care varied across settings. Feasibility of performing an assessment was the main driver for selection of outcome measures. Interventions were mainly geared toward improving respiratory function and deconditioning. Prone patient positioning, now commonplace, was used infrequently by therapists in acute care prior to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Similarly, outpatient and home care settings noted an increase in the use of respiratory-driven interventions such as incentive spirometry and breathing exercises. Qualitative data analysis revealed both physical barriers (personal protective equipment [PPE]) and social barriers to care. Therapists noted challenges in discharge planning and patient/family education due to the impact of social isolation. They also noted difficulty maintaining productivity standards because of additional time spent in changing PPE and following safety measures. Participants dealt with rapid changes in their role, changing productivity standards, and needing to increase their knowledge in a short amount of time. CONCLUSION: Physical therapy use varied widely across settings. Despite some concern for personal health, respondents felt that the COVID-19 pandemic increased a sense of togetherness among team members and promoted greater appreciation for life and work. IMPACT: This exploration of the process of care and current clinical practices across settings provides important knowledge about the role of physical therapists and physical therapist assistants in the care of patients with COVID-19. Gaining an understanding of the psychosocial impact of the pandemic among therapists could assist in creating solutions to better support clinicians' well-being.","Tiwari, Devashish; Naidoo, Keshrie; Chatiwala, Naseem; Bartlo, Pamela L; Triola, Allison; Ong, Brandon; Gore, Shweta",Phys. ther,551,16

Lactate is considered an important substrate for mitochondria in muscles, heart, and brain during exercise, and is the main gluconeogenetic precursor in the liver and kidneys. In this light, we review the (patho)physiology of lactate metabolism in sepsis and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). What advances does it highlight? Elevated blood lactate is strongly associated with mortality in septic patients. Lactate seems unrelated to tissue hypoxia, but likely reflects mitochondrial dysfunction and high adrenergic stimulation. Patients with severe COVID-19 exhibit near-normal blood lactate, indicating preserved mitochondrial function, despite a systemic hyperinflammatory similar to sepsis. ABSTRACT: In critically ill patients, elevated plasma lactate is often interpreted as a sign of organ hypoperfusion and/or tissue hypoxia. This view on lactate is likely influenced by the pioneering exercise physiologists around 1920. August Krogh identified an oxygen deficit at the onset of exercise that was later related to an oxygen ""debt"" and lactate accumulation by AV Hill. Lactate is considered the main gluconeogenetic precursor in the liver and kidneys during submaximal exercise, but the hepatic elimination is attenuated by splanchnic vasoconstriction at high-intensity exercise causing an exponential increase in blood lactate. With the development of stable isotope tracers, lactate has become established as an important energy source for muscle, brain, and heart tissue where it is utilised for mitochondrial respiration. Plasma lactate > 4 mM is strongly associated with mortality in septic shock, with no direct link between lactate release and tissue hypoxia. Herein, we provide evidence for mitochondrial dysfunction and adrenergic stimulation as explanations for the sepsis-induced hyperlactatemia. Despite profound hypoxaemia and intense work of breathing, patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) rarely exhibit hyperlactatemia (> 2.5 mM), while presenting a systemic hyperinflammatory state much like sepsis. However, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), which controls the formation of lactate, is markedly elevated in plasma, and strongly associated with mortality in severe COVID-19. We briefly review the potential mechanisms of the LDH elevation in COVID-19 and its relationship to lactate metabolism based on mechanisms established in contracting skeletal muscle and the acute respiratory distress syndrome.

In conflict with this process is the ability that many viruses have to mutate their antigens to escape infection- or vaccine-induced antibody memory responses. Mutable viruses such as dengue virus, influenza virus and of course coronavirus have a major global health impact, exacerbated by this ability to evade immune responses through mutation. There have been several outstanding recent studies on B-cell memory that also shed light on the potential and limitations of antibody memory to protect against viral antigen variation, and so promise to inform new strategies for vaccine design. For the purposes of this review, the current understanding of the different memory B-cell (MBC) populations, and their potential to recognize mutant antigens, will be described prior to some examples from antibody responses against the highly mutable RNA based flaviviruses, influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2.","White, Harry N",Viruses,551,21

However, no published works discussed about the risk factors of COVID-19 related AKI. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study, recruiting COVID-19 inpatients from the Sino-French branch of Tongji Hospital. Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data were collected and compared. We used univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods to identify the risk factors of COVID-19-related AKI. Results: Of the 116 patients in our study, 12 (10.3%) were recognized as AKI, including 5 (4.3%) in-hospital AKI.

Methods: Using a non-profit database, the 40 shoulder units that performed the most arthroscopic rotator cuff repairs in Germany in 2018 were identified. Following a standardized protocol, the webpages of these units were screened and their strategy for elective procedures during the COVID19- pandemic was analyzed. Special emphasis was put on the use of new digital technologies. Results: At the time of the study, no unit had stopped scheduling appointments for elective shoulder patients due to the pandemic. Almost all units (97.5%) offered explicit information about COVID19 and their strategies towards it. The possibilities of visiting patients in shoulder units varied due to local restrictions. Two units (5%) offered digital consultations. Conclusion: At the time of the study, elective shoulder procedures could be planned and carried out at the largest centers in Germany. Local restrictions had a great influence on the organization of the procedure and hospital stay during the COVID19-pandemic.

Treatment of CPTP has been a clinical challenge and the underlying mechanisms of CPTP remain elusive. Recently, sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling has been shown to be associated with various pain states but its role in the pathogenesis of CPTP is still unclear. Methods: CPTP was induced in rats by thoracotomy. Rats were divided into CPTP group and non-CPTP group based on the mechanical withdrawal threshold (MWT). Rats were administered with Shh signaling inhibitor cyclopamine and activator smoothened agonist (SAG), and then evaluated by MWT and cold allodynia testing. The expressions of Shh signaling (Shh ligand, patched and smoothened receptor, Gli transcription factors), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), tropomyosin-related kinase receptor B (Trk-B), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and protein kinase B (Akt) in rat T4-5 spinal cord dorsal horn (SDH) were detected by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Results: The expression of Shh signaling significantly increased and the BDNF/TrkB pathway was activated in T4-5 SDH of CPTP rats. Cyclopamine attenuated hyperalgesia and down-regulated the expressions of Gil1, BDNF, p-TrkB, p-PI3K and p-Akt in CPTP rats. SAG induced hyperalgesia in non-CPTP rats and elevated the expressions of Gil1, BDNF, p-TrkB, p-PI3K and p-Akt. Conclusion: Shh signaling may contribute to CPTP via activating BDNF/TrkB signaling pathway, and inhibition of Shh signaling may effectively alleviate CPTP.","Yang, Yitian; Wang, Xiaoyan; Zhang, Xuan; You, Shaohua; Feng, Long; Zhang, Yunliang; Shi, Yizheng; Xu, Yuhai; Zhang, Hong",J Pain Res,551,16

Cellular immune profiles and cytokine responses of all children are similar to their parents at all timepoints. All family members have salivary anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies detected, predominantly IgA, that coincide with symptom resolution in 3 of 4 symptomatic members. Plasma from both parents and one child have IgG antibody against the S1 protein and virus-neutralizing activity detected. Using a systems serology approach, we demonstrate higher levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody features of these family members compared to healthy controls. These data indicate that children can mount an immune response to SARS-CoV-2 without virological confirmation of infection, raising the possibility that immunity in children can prevent the establishment of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of Zilucoplan in improving oxygenation and short- and long-term outcome of COVID-19 patients with acute hypoxic respiratory failure. TRIAL DESIGN: This is a phase 2 academic, prospective, 2:1 randomized, open-label, multi-center interventional study. PARTICIPANTS: Adult patients (&#8805;18y old) will be recruited at specialized COVID-19 units and ICUs at 9 Belgian hospitals. The main eligibility criteria are as follows: 1) Inclusion criteria: a. Recent (&#8805;6 days and &#8804;16 days) SARS-CoV-2 infection. b. Chest CT scan showing bilateral infiltrates within the last 2 days prior to randomisation. c. Acute hypoxia (defined as PaO2/FiO2 below 350 mmHg or SpO2 below 93% on minimal 2 L/min supplemental oxygen). d. Signs of cytokine release syndrome characterized by either high serum ferritin, or high D-dimers, or high LDH or deep lymphopenia or a combination of those. 2) Exclusion criteria: e. Mechanical ventilation for more than 24 hours prior to randomisation. f. Active bacterial or fungal infection. g. History of meningococcal disease (due to the known high predisposition to invasive, often recurrent meningococcal infections of individuals deficient in components of the alternative and terminal complement pathways). INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Patients in the experimental arm will receive daily 32,4 mg Zilucoplan subcutaneously and a daily IV infusion of 2g of the antibiotic ceftriaxone for 14 days (or until hospital discharge, whichever comes first) in addition to standard of care. These patients will receive additional prophylactic antibiotics until 14 days after the last Zilucoplan dose: hospitalized patients will receive a daily IV infusion of 2g of ceftriaxone, discharged patients will switch to daily 500 mg of oral ciprofloxacin. The control group will receive standard of care and a daily IV infusion of 2g of ceftriaxone for 1 week (or until hospital discharge, whichever comes first), to control for the effects of antibiotics on the clinical course of COVID-19. MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary endpoint is the improvement of oxygenation as measured by mean and/or median change from pre-treatment (day 1) to post-treatment (day 6 and 15 or at discharge, whichever comes first) in PaO2/FiO2 ratio, P(A-a)O2 gradient and a/A PO2 ratio. (PAO2= Partial alveolar pressure of oxygen, PaO2=partial arterial pressure of oxygen, FiO2=Fraction of inspired oxygen). RANDOMISATION: Patients will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio (Zilucoplan: control). Randomization will be done using an Interactive Web Response System (REDCap). BLINDING (MASKING): In this open-label trial neither participants, caregivers, nor those assessing the outcomes will be blinded to group assignment. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): A total of 81 patients will be enrolled: 54 patients will be randomized to the experimental arm and 27 patients to the control arm.

Classical epidemic model can reproduce the quantum entanglement emerging in the case of electrostatically coupled qubits described by von-Neumann entropy both in non-dissipative and dissipative case. The obtained results shows that quantum mechanical phenomena might be almost entirely simulated by classical statistical model. It includes the quantum like entanglement and superposition of states. Therefore coupled epidemic models expressed by classical systems in terms of classical physics can be the base for possible incorporation of quantum technologies and in particular for quantum like computation and quantum like communication. The classical density matrix is derived and described by the equation of motion in terms of anticommutator. Existence of Rabi like oscillations is pointed in classical epidemic model. Furthermore the existence of Aharonov-Bohm effect in quantum systems can also be reproduced by the classical epidemic model. Every quantum system made from quantum dots and described by simplistic tight-binding model by use of position-based qubits can be effectively described by classical model with very specific structure of S matrix that has twice bigger size as it is the case of quantum matrix Hamiltonian. Obtained results partly question fundamental and unique character of quantum mechanics and are placing ontology of quantum mechanics much in the framework of classical statistical physics what can bring motivation for emergence of other fundamental theories bringing suggestion that quantum mechanical is only effective and phenomenological but not fundamental picture of reality.,"Pomorski, Krzysztof",,551,20

Many organs and biological systems are involved in SARS-Cov-2 infection, either due to direct virus-induced damage or to indirect effects that can have systemic consequences. Endocrine system is not only an exception but its involvement in COVID-19 is so relevant that an ""endocrine phenotype"" of COVID-19 has progressively acquired clinical relevance. AIM: We have been appointed by the European Society of Endocrinology (ESE) to update with the current statement ESE members and the whole endocrine community on the emerging endocrine phenotype of COVID-19 and its implication for the prevention and management of the disease. CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes has a major role in this phenotype since it is one of the most frequent comorbidities associated with severity and mortality of COVID-19. Careful management including treatment modifications may be required for protecting our patients rather with known diabetes from the most dangerous consequences of COVID-19 or hospitalized with COVID-19, but also in patients with SARS-CoV-2 induced newly onset diabetes. Obesity increases susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 and the risk for COVID-19 adverse outcome. Adequate nutritional management needs to be granted to patients with obesity or undernourishment in order to limit their increased susceptibility and severity of COVID-19 infection. Lack of vitamin D, hypocalcemia and vertebral fractures have also emerged as frequent findings in the hospitalized COVID-19 population and may negatively impact on the outcome of such patients. Also, in patients with adrenal insufficiency prompt adaptation of glucocorticoid doses may be needed. Moreover, in this updated statement role of sex hormones as well as peculiar pituitary and thyroid aspects of COVID-19 have been included. Finally, in view of the mass vaccination, potential implications for endocrine patients should be considered.","Puig-Domingo, M; Marazuela, M; Yildiz, B O; Giustina, A",Endocrine,551,22

Methods: A retrospective nursing method was implemented. A total of 280 cases of patients were diagnosed with coronavirus pneumonia in the isolation ward of our hospital. The 280 cases of newly diagnosed pneumonia were divided into two groups: The nursing crisis management system group (n=150, the nursing crisis management was given) and the non-nursing crisis management system (n=130, routine nursing management was given). The psychological status (profile of mood states (POMS) score) of nursing staff before and after the implementation of the nursing crisis management, the psychological status of patients after the implementation of nursing crisis management (POMS score), emotion, cognition, behavior severity, patients' satisfaction with nursing, treatment compliance (Morisky Medication Compliance Scale (MMAS) score) of patients, the rate of cure of patients and the infection rate of nursing staff were compared. Results: Compared with the non-nursing crisis management system group, the POMS scores of patients and nurses in the nursing crisis management system group decreased (all P&lt;0.05). Compared with the non-nursing crisis management system group, the emotional, cognitive and behavioral scores of patients in the nursing crisis management system group were lower, while the MMAS score, satisfaction with nursing and cure rate were significantly increased (all P&lt;0.05). The 142 nursing staff did not catch coronavirus. Conclusion: During the novel coronavirus pneumonia outbreak and the current normal epidemic prevention and control periods, our crisis management mode was introduced into nursing work. The construction of the nursing crisis management mode under the epidemic situation can improve the psychological state and improve the management efficiency of the patients and nurses. The patients' satisfaction is high and the treatment compliance is good.","Yu, Y.; Wu, L.; Yan, H.; Luo, J.; Zhang, L.; Fan, G.; Cui, L.; Chen, S.; Xu, J.; Zhu, C.; Bi, D.; Sun, M.",American Journal of Translational Research,551,16

Two drugs from the group of ITNFα – infliximab and adalimumab – are currently being considered as possible options. The safety issues of ITNFα treatment in patients with immunophaling rheumatic diseases and COVID-19 are discussed. The review also provides current data on vaccination against COVID-19, in particular on the vaccines currently available in Russia, which are at different stages of clinical trials. We conclude that randomized clinical trials of the effectiveness and safety of ITNF-α in patients with the new coronavirus infection are needed.

Here, we report that murine hepatitis coronavirus initially seeded on FFR filter material is inactivated (6 order of magnitude reduction as measured by median tissue culture infective dose, TCID50) after dry heating at 75°C for 30 min. We also find that the quantitative fit of FFRs after heat treatment at this temperature, under dry conditions or at 90% relative humidity, is not affected by single or 10 heating cycles. Previous studies have reported that the filtration efficiency of FFRs is not negatively impacted by these heating conditions. These results suggest that thermal inactivation of coronaviruses is a potentially rapid and widely deployable method to reuse N95 FFRs in emergency situations where reusing FFRs is a necessity and broad-spectrum sterilization is unavailable. However, we also observe that a radiative heat source (e.g. an exposed heating element) results in rapid qualitative degradation of the FFR. Finally, we discuss differences in the results reported here and other recent studies investigating heat as a means to recycle FFRs. These differences suggest that while our repeated decontamination cycles do not affect FFR fit, overall wear time and the number of donning/doffing cycles are important factors that likely degrade FFR fit and must be investigated further.","Massey, Travis L; Borucki, Monica K; Paik, Samuel Y; Fuhrer, Kyle W; Bora, Mihail; Kane, Staci R; Haque, Razi-Ul M; Baxamusa, Salmaan H",Ann.

METHODS: Data on baseline characteristics, stroke subtype, initial National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score, the time between last known well (LKW) to emergency department (ED) arrival, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) administration, the involvement of large vessel occlusion (LVO), and whether mechanical thrombectomy (MT) was pursued in patients with acute stroke were extracted from 24 March to 23 April 2020 (the time period of a stay-at-home order was placed due to the COVID-19 pandemic as the study group) at a tertiary care hospital in West Michigan, USA, compared with data from 24 March to 23 April 2019 (control group). RESULTS: Our study demonstrated a reduction in cases of acute ischemic stroke (AIS), although this did not reach statistical significance. However, there was an increase in hemorrhagic stroke (7.5% controls vs. 19.2% study group). The age of stroke patients was significantly younger during the period of the stay-at-home order compared to the control group. We identified a significant overall delay of ED arrivals from LKW in the study group. Additionally, an increased number of AIS patients with LVO in the study group (34.8%) was found compared to the control group (17.5%). A significantly increased number of patients received MT in the study group. Additionally, 11 patients were COVID-19 PCR-positive in the study group, 10 with AIS and only 1 with hemorrhagic stroke. Patients with COVID-19 had a high incidence of atrial fibrillation and hyperlipidemia. One AIS patient with COVID-19 rapidly developed cytotoxic edema with corresponding elevated inflammatory biomarkers. No statistical significance was noted when stroke subtype, LVO, and MT groups were compared. CONCLUSIONS: There was a trend of decreasing AIS admissions during the COVID-19 pandemic. There was also a significantly increased number of AIS patients with LVO who received MT, especially those with COVID-19. We conclude that cytokine storm resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection might play a role in AIS patients with COVID-19.","Rameez, Fnu; McCarthy, Philip; Cheng, Yao; Packard, Laurel M; Davis, Alan T; Wees, Nabil; Khan, Nadeem; Singer, Justin; Khan, Muhib; Min, Jiangyong",Cerebrovasc Dis Extra,551,15

There was an urgent need of a high-throughput molecular test for screening the COVID-19 patients in the community. The Luminex NxTAG CoV extended panel is a high-throughput FDA emergency use-authorized molecular diagnostic assay for SARS-CoV-2 detection. This system targets three genes (ORF1ab, N, and E genes) of SARS-CoV-2, the ORF1ab region of SARS-CoV, and the ORF5 region of MERS-CoV. In this study, we evaluated the diagnostic performance of this system with nasopharyngeal swab specimens of 214 suspected COVID-19 patients in Hong Kong. The results were compared with our routine COVID-19 reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) protocol with a LightMix SarbecoV E-gene kit and an in-house RdRp/Hel RT-PCR assay. The NxTAG CoV extended panel demonstrated 97.8% sensitivity and 100% specificity to SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal specimens. On low-viral load specimens, the sensitivity of the NxTAG panel could still maintain at 85.71%. Strong agreement was observed between the NxTAG panel and the routine COVID-19 RT-PCR protocol (kappa value = 0.98). Overall, the E gene target of the NxTAG panel demonstrated the highest sensitivity among the three SARS-CoV-2 targets, while the N gene targets demonstrated the least. In conclusion, the NxTAG CoV extended panel is simple to use, and it has high diagnostic sensitivity and specificity to SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal specimens. We recommend this diagnostic system for high-throughput COVID-19 screening in the community.","Chen, Jonathan Hon-Kwan; Yip, Cyril Chik-Yan; Chan, Jasper Fuk-Woo; Poon, Rosana Wing-Shan; To, Kelvin Kai-Wang; Chan, Kwok-Hung; Cheng, Vincent Chi-Chung; Yuen, Kwok-Yung",J. clin. microbiol,551,25

Prevention behaviors are critical to minimizing transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the U.S., to ultimately reduce the health, social, and economic burdens of COVID-19. Yet, health behavior decision-making is complex, and uptake of preventative behaviors has been variable. Women may provide pro-prevention behavior modeling to their networks, facilitating uptake diffusion. The COPE Study enrolled 491 women residing in the United States from May to June of 2020; women completed an online survey of COVID-19 experiences and prevention behaviors. We employed binary logistic modeling to identify factors predicting women's practice of (1) staying home except for essential activities, (2) physical distancing in public, and (3) wearing a face mask in public. Findings demonstrate that women's prevention behaviors are influenced by multilevel factors. Women living in urban environments, having minimal formal education, or having a household annual income of USD 30,000-50,000 are less likely to practice prevention behaviors. Cultural context may be an important factor in the decision-making process. Results aid in the identification what interventional ""levers"" may warrant consideration to promote uptake of such behaviors, and whom to engage. Because women are modelers of behavior, it is critical to engage them in prevention behavior interventions.","Anderson, Katherine M; Stockman, Jamila K",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),551,32

According to Philip Strong, the founder of the sociological study of epidemic infectious diseases, not only is an epidemic biological; there is also the potential for three psycho-social epidemics: of fear, moralization, and action. This work empirically tests Strong's model at scale by studying the use of language of 122M tweets related to the COVID-19 pandemic posted in the U.S. during the whole year of 2020. On Twitter, we identified three distinct phases. Each of them is characterized by different regimes of the three psycho-social epidemics. In the refusal phase, users refused to accept reality despite the increasing number of deaths in other countries. In the anger phase (started after the announcement of the first death in the country), users' fear translated into anger about the looming feeling that things were about to change. Finally, in the acceptance phase, which began after the authorities imposed physical-distancing measures, users settled into a""new normal""for their daily activities. Overall, refusal of accepting reality gradually died off as the year went on, while acceptance increasingly took hold. During 2020, as cases surged in waves, so did anger, re-emerging cyclically at each wave. Our real-time operationalization of Strong's model is designed in a way that makes it possible to embed epidemic psychology into real-time models (e.g., epidemiological and mobility models).","Aiello, Luca Maria; Quercia, Daniele; Zhou, Ke; Constantinides, Marios; vS'cepanovi'c, Sanja; Joglekar, Sagar",,551,30

Emergency medical services (EMS) operating duration differs from normal services due to equipment preparation, number of personnel, and on-board ambulance procedures. Notably, there have been no studies examining EMS duration regarding COVID-19 patients. AIM: The aim of this study was to compare the EMS time for COVID-19 patients and routine services. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted in a tertiary university hospital in Khon Kaen, Thailand. Information gathering was carried out by employing the Srinagarind Hospital EMS database throughout January 1, 2020, and February 10, 2021. RESULTS: A total of 2420 EMS operations were examined, of which five tested positive for COVID-19 (0.21%). The mean age of the COVID-19 patients was 35.6 ± 7.2 years, with the activation interval for COVID-19 and routine services at 64.20 ± 10.14 and 1.42 ± 0.42 min, respectively (p &lt; 0.001). The on-scene time for COVID-19 and routine services was 3.20 ± 0.44 and 5.20 ± 2.20 min, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: EMS operating time amid the activation interval for COVID-19 patients was significantly longer than in the normal group. However, on-scene time for COVID-19 patients was less time than in normal operations.","Apiratwarakul, K.; Suzuki, T.; Celebi, I.; Ienghong, K.; Tangpaisarn, T.; Tiamkao, S.; Bhudhisawasdi, V.",Open Access Macedonian Journal of Medical Sciences,551,16

While spreadsheets are widely used yet are challenging to interact with, especially on mobile devices, using them in VR has not been explored in depth. A special uniqueness of the domain is the contrast between the immersive and large display space afforded by VR, contrasted by the very limited interaction space that may be afforded for the information worker on the go, such as an airplane seat or a small work-space. To close this gap, we present a tool-set for enhancing spreadsheet interaction on tablets using immersive VR headsets and pen-based input. This combination opens up many possibilities for enhancing the productivity for spreadsheet interaction. We propose to use the space around and in front of the tablet for enhanced visualization of spreadsheet data and meta-data. For example, extending sheet display beyond the bounds of the physical screen, or easier debugging by uncovering hidden dependencies between sheet's cells. Combining the precise on-screen input of a pen with spatial sensing around the tablet, we propose tools for the efficient creation and editing of spreadsheets functions such as off-the-screen layered menus, visualization of sheets dependencies, and gaze-and-touch-based switching between spreadsheet tabs. We study the feasibility of the proposed tool-set using a video-based online survey and an expert-based assessment of indicative human performance potential.","Gesslein, Travis; Biener, Verena; Gagel, Philipp; Schneider, Daniel; Kristensson, Per Ola; Ofek, Eyal; Pahud, Michel; Grubert, Jens",,551,4

After an initial time period in which it was unclear how to battle the virus, social distancing has been recognised globally as an effective method to mitigate the disease spread.This called for technological tools such as Mobile Contact Tracing Applications (MCTA), which are used to digitally trace contacts among people, and in case a positive case is found, people with the application installed which had been in contact will be notified. De-centralised MCTA may suffer from a novel kind of privacy attack, based on the memory of the human beings, which upon notification of the application can identify who is the positive individual responsible for the notification.Our results show that it is indeed possible to identify positive people among the group of contacts of a human being, and this is even easier when the sociability of the positive individual is low. In practice, identification can be made with an accuracy of more than 90% depending on the scenario.

METHODS: A search strategy was designed to retrieve all articles published from 1 December 2019 to 12 May 2020, by combining the terms 'coronavirus' OR 'covid' OR 'SARS-CoV-2') AND ('neonat*' OR 'newborn') in the following electronic databases: MEDLINE/Pubmed, Scopus, Web of Science, MedRxiv, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Review and the WHO COVID-19 database, with no language restrictions. Quality of studies was evaluated by using a specific tool for assessment of case reports and/or case series. RESULTS: Twenty-six observational studies (18 case reports and 8 case series) with 44 newborns with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were included in the final analysis. Studies were mainly from China and Italy. Half of neonates had a documented contact with the infected mother and one out of three infected neonates was admitted from home. Median age at diagnosis was 5 days. One out of four neonates was asymptomatic, and the remaining showed mild symptoms typical of acute respiratory infections and/or gastrointestinal symptoms. The majority of neonates were left in spontaneous breathing (room air) and had good prognosis after a median duration of hospitalisation of 10 days. CONCLUSIONS: Most neonates with SARS-CoV-2 infection were asymptomatic or presented mild symptoms, generally were left in spontaneous breathing and had a good prognosis after median 10 days of hospitalisation. Large epidemiological and clinical cohort studies, as well as the implementation of collaborative networks, are needed to improve the understanding of the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection in neonates.","Trevisanuto, Daniele; Cavallin, Francesco; Cavicchiolo, Maria Elena; Borellini, Martina; Calgaro, Serena; Baraldi, Eugenio",Arch. dis. child. fetal neonatal ed,551,24

Existing 3D reconstruction systems inevitably make trade-offs between three conflicting goals: the efficiency of reconstruction (e.g., time and memory requirements), the visual quality of the constructed scene, and the rendering speed on the VR device. This paper proposes a reconstruction system that simultaneously meets all three goals. The key idea is to avoid the resource-demanding process of reconstructing a high-polygon mesh altogether. Instead, we propose to directly transfer details from the original point cloud to a low polygon mesh, which significantly reduces the reconstruction time and cost, preserves the scene details, and enables real-time rendering on mobile VR devices. While our technique is general, we demonstrate it in reconstructing cultural heritage sites. We for the first time digitally reconstruct the Elmina Castle, a UNESCO world heritage site at Ghana, from billions of laser-scanned points. The reconstruction process executes on low-end desktop systems without requiring high processing power, making it accessible to the broad community. The reconstructed scenes render on Oculus Go in 60 FPS, providing a real-time VR experience with high visual quality.

Older adults subjects > 60 years of age account for > 95% of the over one million fatal cases reported to date. It is unclear why in this age group SARS-CoV-2 infection causes more severe disease than in young adults. We hypothesized that differences in SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive cellular immunity induced after infection with human coronaviruses (HCoVs), like OC43 and NL63, were at the basis of the differential mortality (and morbidity) observed after SARS-CoV-2 infection, because a small proportion of HCoV-specific T cells cross-react with SARS-CoV-2. Our data demonstrate that pre-existing T cell immunity induced by circulating human alpha- and beta-HCoVs is present in young adult individuals, but virtually absent in older adult subjects. Consequently, the frequency of cross-reactive T cells directed to the novel pandemic SARS-CoV-2 was minimal in most older adults. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the presence of cross-reactive T cells to SARS-CoV-2 is compared in young and older adults. Our findings provide at least a partial explanation for the more severe clinical outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection observed in the elderly. Moreover, this information could help to design efficacious vaccines for this age group, aiming at the induction of cell-mediated immunity.","Saletti, Giulietta; Gerlach, Thomas; Jansen, Janina M; Molle, Antonia; Elbahesh, Husni; Ludlow, Martin; Li, Wentao; Bosch, Berend-Jan; Osterhaus, Albert D M E; Rimmelzwaan, Guus F",Sci Rep,551,20

In this study, we examined suicide rates among welfare support workers and compared them to other occupations in Australia. METHODS: We used data from the National Coroners Information System to obtain suicide deaths between the years 2001 and 2016. Using the Australian standard population from 2001 and Census data from 2006, 2011 and 2016, we calculated age-standardised suicide rates and rate ratios to compare suicide rates across different occupational groups. RESULTS: Overall, the age-standardised suicide rate of welfare support workers was 8.6 per 100 000 people. The gender-stratified results show that male welfare support workers have a high suicide rate (23.8 per 100 000 people) which is similar to male social workers and nurses (25.4 per 100 000). After adjusting for age and year of death, both males (rate ratio 1.48, 95% CI 1.23 to 1.78) and female welfare support workers (rate ratio 1.49, 95% CI 1.20 to 1.86) have higher suicide rate ratios compared with the reference group (excluding occupations from the comparison groups). CONCLUSION: The age-standardised suicide rates of male welfare support workers are comparable to occupations which have been identified as high-risk occupations for suicide.

However, little is known about the kinetics of the systemic immune response and its association with survival in SARS-CoV-2+ patients admitted in ICU. We aimed to compare the immuno-inflammatory features according to organ failure severity and in-ICU mortality. METHODS: Six-week multicentre study (N = 3) including SARS-CoV-2+ patients admitted in ICU. Analysis of plasma biomarkers at days 0 and 3-4 according to organ failure worsening (increase in SOFA score) and 60-day mortality. RESULTS: 101 patients were included. Patients had severe respiratory diseases with PaO2/FiO2 of 155 [111-251] mmHg), SAPS II of 37 [31-45] and SOFA score of 4 [3-7]. Eighty-three patients (83%) required endotracheal intubation/mechanical ventilation and among them, 64% were treated with prone position. IL-1ß was barely detectable. Baseline IL-6 levels positively correlated with organ failure severity. Baseline IL-6 and CRP levels were significantly higher in patients in the worsening group than in the non-worsening group (278 [70-622] vs. 71 [29-153] pg/mL, P < 0.01; and 178 [100-295] vs. 100 [37-213] mg/L, P < 0.05, respectively). Baseline IL-6 and CRP levels were significantly higher in non-survivors compared to survivors but fibrinogen levels and lymphocyte counts were not different between groups. After adjustment on SOFA score and time from symptom onset to first dosage, IL-6 and CRP remained significantly associated with mortality. IL-6 changes between Day 0 and Day 3-4 were not different according to the outcome. A contrario, kinetics of CRP and lymphocyte count were different between survivors and non-survivors. CONCLUSIONS: In SARS-CoV-2+ patients admitted in ICU, a systemic pro-inflammatory signature was associated with clinical worsening and 60-day mortality.","Lavillegrand, Jean-Rémi; Garnier, Marc; Spaeth, Agathe; Mario, Nathalie; Hariri, Geoffroy; Pilon, Antoine; Berti, Enora; Fieux, Fabienne; Thietart, Sara; Urbina, Tomas; Turpin, Matthieu; Darrivière, Lucie; Fartoukh, Muriel; Verdonk, Franck; Dumas, Guillaume; Tedgui, Alain; Guidet, Bertrand; Maury, Eric; Chantran, Yannick; Voiriot, Guillaume; Ait-Oufella, Hafid",Ann Intensive Care,551,16

Built from phosphoserine, an immune-signaling molecule in nature, this zwitterionic polymer exhibits both nonfouling and immunomodulatory properties. Its conjugation to uricase is shown to proactively eradicate all unwanted immune response, outperforming the zwitterionic polymers. On the other hand, this polymer could significantly prolong the half-life of protein drugs in vivo, overcoming the innate drawback of phosphoserine in inducing accelerated clearance. Our demonstration of a nonfouling zwitterionic material with built-in immunomodulatory functionality provides new insights into the fundamental design of biomaterials, as well as far-reaching implications for broad applications such as drug delivery, implants, and cell therapy.","Li, Bowen; Yuan, Zhefan; Jain, Priyesh; Hung, Hsiang-Chieh; He, Yuwei; Lin, Xiaojie; McMullen, Patrick; Jiang, Shaoyi",Sci.

The anti-retroviral therapy failure rate and the risk of HIV vertical transmission to infants from women with failed treatment during pregnancy also largely remains unevaluated. METHODS: This is a prospective, observational and follow-up study of 18 months to determine the association of ART failure in pregnant women and the subsequent risk of HIV transmission to their infants. A total of 81 mothers were evaluated for ART success/failure by analysing their viral loads. RESULTS: Analyses revealed that a high percentage (19.75%) of women on ART had high viral loads, while the overall HIV transmission rate to the infants was 8.64%. The rate of transmission from women with high viral load was significantly high compared to women with low viral load (37.5% vs. 1.54%; p = 0.0015). CD4 level was not associated with HIV transmission. However, CD4 levels in women, who had successful or failed ART, were significantly different (p = 0.0031). Factors such as mother's age, baby's sex and weight as well as delivery mode were not associated with HIV transmission, however, breastfeeding and viral loads were found to be independently associated with HIV transmission to the neonates. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights that a significant proportion of women on ART had impaired viral load control. The rate of HIV transmission to infants was also significantly high among these women. This warrants viral load monitoring of HIV infected women to reduce the overall transmission to the infants.","Bardeskar, Nikhil S; Ahir-Bist, Swati P; Mehta, Preeti R; Samant-Mavani, Padmaja; Nanavati, Ruchi; Mania-Pramanik, Jayanti",Arch. gynecol. obstet,551,5

However, recent research has serious limitations, such as non-guideline definition of myocardial injury, heterogenicity of troponin sampling or very short-term follow-up. Using data from a large European cohort, we aimed to overcome these pitfalls and adequately characterize myocardial damage in COVID-19. METHODS: Consecutive patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and available high-sensitive troponin I (hs-TnI), from March 1st to April 20th, 2020 who completed at least 1-month follow-up or died, were studied. RESULTS: A total of 918 patients (mean age 63.2±15.5 years, 60.1% male) with a median follow-up of 57 (49-63) days were included. Of these, 190 (20.7%) fulfilled strict criteria for myocardial injury (21.1% chronic, 76.8% acute non-ischemic, 2.1% acute ischemic). Time from onset of symptoms to maximum hs-TnI was 11 (7-18) days. Thrombotic and bleeding events, arrhythmias, heart failure, need for mechanical ventilation and death were significantly more prevalent in patients with higher hs-TnI concentrations, even without fulfilling criteria for myocardial injury. hs-TnI was identified as an independent predictor of mortality [HR 2.52 (1.57-4.04) per 5-logarithmic units increment] after adjusting for multiple relevant covariates. CONCLUSION: Elevated hs-TnI is highly prevalent among patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Even mild elevations well below the 99th URL were significantly associated with higher rates of cardiac and non-cardiac complications, and higher mortality. Future research should address the role of serial hs-TnI assessment to improve COVID-19 prognostic stratification and clinical outcomes.","Caro-Codón, Juan; Rey, Juan R; Buño, Antonio; Iniesta, Angel M; Rosillo, Sandra O; Castrejon-Castrejon, Sergio; Merino, Carlos; Marco, Irene; Martinez, Luis A; Garcia-Veas, Jose M; Martin-Polo, Lorena; Rodriguez-Sotelo, Laura; Martinez-Cossiani, Marcel; Gonzalez-Valle, Luis; Herrero, Alicia; López-de-Sá, Esteban; Merino, Jose L",Med. clin (Ed. impr.),551,1

Design/methodology/approach: This paper is a conceptual one based on a review of literature relating to the acquisiting and use of secondary residences or “second homes”. Findings: This paper observes that the secondary residence is often the object of a material over-investment that is symbolic and mental. The owners never quite leave their main place of residence when in the secondary one. The result is not two complementary spaces, but a hybrid space made up of the interlocking of the two. This paper also concludes that digitalization has made it easier to rent a secondary residence for a short period of time, using for instance the Airbnb platform, thus making it more an object of trade than a second home. From a sustainability perspective, the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to bring to the relatively rapid growth of short-term renting a halt. Further, it may encourage owners to be more psychologically and physically invested in their secondary residence, thereby contributing more to the local economy.

Tocilizumab has shown promising results in retrospective studies in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia with a good safety profile. Objective: To evaluate the effect of early tocilizumab administration vs standard therapy in preventing clinical worsening in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia. Design, Setting, and Participants: Prospective, open-label, randomized clinical trial that randomized patients hospitalized between March 31 and June 11, 2020, with COVID-19 pneumonia to receive tocilizumab or standard of care in 24 hospitals in Italy. Cases of COVID-19 were confirmed by polymerase chain reaction method with nasopharyngeal swab. Eligibility criteria included COVID-19 pneumonia documented by radiologic imaging, partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen (Pao2/Fio2) ratio between 200 and 300 mm Hg, and an inflammatory phenotype defined by fever and elevated C-reactive protein. Interventions: Patients in the experimental arm received intravenous tocilizumab within 8 hours from randomization (8 mg/kg up to a maximum of 800 mg), followed by a second dose after 12 hours. Patients in the control arm received supportive care following the protocols of each clinical center until clinical worsening and then could receive tocilizumab as a rescue therapy. Main Outcome and Measures: The primary composite outcome was defined as entry into the intensive care unit with invasive mechanical ventilation, death from all causes, or clinical aggravation documented by the finding of a Pao2/Fio2 ratio less than 150 mm Hg, whichever came first. Results: A total of 126 patients were randomized (60 to the tocilizumab group; 66 to the control group). The median (interquartile range) age was 60.0 (53.0-72.0) years, and the majority of patients were male (77 of 126, 61.1%). Three patients withdrew from the study, leaving 123 patients available for the intention-to-treat analyses. Seventeen patients of 60 (28.3%) in the tocilizumab arm and 17 of 63 (27.0%) in the standard care group showed clinical worsening within 14 days since randomization (rate ratio, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.59-1.86). Two patients in the experimental group and 1 in the control group died before 30 days from randomization, and 6 and 5 patients were intubated in the 2 groups, respectively. The trial was prematurely interrupted after an interim analysis for futility. Conclusions and Relevance: In this randomized clinical trial of hospitalized adult patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and Pao2/Fio2 ratio between 200 and 300 mm Hg who received tocilizumab, no benefit on disease progression was observed compared with standard care. Further blinded, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials are needed to confirm the results and to evaluate possible applications of tocilizumab in different stages of the disease.

To this date, no specific drugs or vaccines are available to treat SARS-CoV-2 despite its close relation to the SARS-CoV virus that caused a similar epidemic in 2003. Thus, there remains an urgent need for the identification and development of specific antiviral therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2.

In order to find novel inhibitors, we computationally screened a compound library of over 606 million compounds for binding at the recently solved crystal structure of the main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2. A screening of such a vast chemical space for SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors has not been reported before. After shape screening, two docking protocols were applied followed by the determination of molecular descriptors relevant for pharmacokinetics to narrow down the number of initial hits. Next, molecular dynamics simulations were conducted to validate the stability of docked binding modes and comprehensively quantify ligand binding energies. After evaluation of potential off-target binding, we report a list of 12 purchasable compounds, with binding affinity to the target protease that is predicted to be more favorable than that of the cocrystallized peptidomimetic compound. In order to quickly advise ongoing therapeutic intervention for patients, we evaluated approved antiviral drugs and other protease inhibitors to provide a list of nine compounds for drug repurposing. Furthermore, we identified the natural compounds (-)-taxifolin and rhamnetin as potential inhibitors of Mpro. Rhamnetin is already commercially available in pharmacies.","Fischer, André; Sellner, Manuel; Neranjan, Santhosh; Smiesko, Martin; Lill, Markus A",,551,29

METHODS: We investigated staff reports regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in its early weeks on mental health care and mental health service users in the UK using a mixed methods online survey. Recruitment channels included professional associations and networks, charities, and social media. Quantitative findings were reported with descriptive statistics, and content analysis conducted for qualitative data. RESULTS: 2,180 staff from a range of sectors, professions, and specialties participated. Immediate infection control concerns were highly salient for inpatient staff, new ways of working for community staff. Multiple rapid adaptations and innovations in response to the crisis were described, especially remote working. This was cautiously welcomed but found successful in only some clinical situations. Staff had specific concerns about many groups of service users, including people whose conditions are exacerbated by pandemic anxieties and social disruptions; people experiencing loneliness, domestic abuse and family conflict; those unable to understand and follow social distancing requirements; and those who cannot engage with remote care. CONCLUSION: This overview of staff concerns and experiences in the early COVID-19 pandemic suggests directions for further research and service development: we suggest that how to combine infection control and a therapeutic environment in hospital, and how to achieve effective and targeted tele-health implementation in the community, should be priorities. The limitations of our convenience sample must be noted.","Johnson, Sonia; Dalton-Locke, Christian; Vera San Juan, Norha; Foye, Una; Oram, Sian; Papamichail, Alexandra; Landau, Sabine; Rowan Olive, Rachel; Jeynes, Tamar; Shah, Prisha; Sheridan Rains, Luke; Lloyd-Evans, Brynmor; Carr, Sarah; Killaspy, Helen; Gillard, Steve; Simpson, Alan",Soc. psychiatr. psychiatr. epidemiol,551,16

The clinical records of dogs receiving intra or postoperative labetalol infusion were retrospectively reviewed. Invasive systolic (SAP), mean (MAP) and diastolic (DAP) arterial pressure and heart rate (HR) before labetalol infusion (T0) and 15, 30, 45 and 60 min (T1, T2, T3 and T4 respectively) after infusion were retrieved. The dose rate of labetalol infusion and use of concurrently administered drugs that could have potentially affected ABP and/or HR were also recorded. ANOVA for repeated measures and Dunnett's multiple comparison test were used to determine the effect of labetalol on ABP and HR. Differences were considered significant when p < 0.05. RESULTS: A total of 20 dogs met the inclusion criteria, and hypertension was documented after craniotomy (12/20), adrenalectomy (4/20) and other procedures (4/20). Five dogs received labetalol intraoperatively, 14 postoperatively, and 1 during the surgical procedure and recovery. Median infusion duration and rate were 463 (60-2120) minutes and 1.1 (0.2-3.4) mg/kg/h respectively. Median loading dose was 0.2 (0.2-0.4) mg/kg. Labetalol produced a significant decrease in SAP and DAP at all time points compared to T0 (p < 0.05), while the effect was not significant at T1 for MAP (p = 0.0519). Median maximum MAP decrease was 31 (20-90) mmHg. Heart rate did not increase significantly during treatment (p = 0.2454). Acepromazine given before or during labetalol treatment did not reduce significantly ABP (p = 0.735).

Hormones are considered the significant pillars of sex differences responsible for the discrepancy in immune response exhibited by males and females. Females appear to be better equipped to counter invading respiratory viral pathogens, including the novel SARS-CoV-2, than males.

Although the value and effectiveness of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in severe respiratory illness from COVID-19 remains unclear at this time, there is emerging evidence suggesting that it could be utilized as an ultimate treatment in appropriately selected patients not responding to conventional care. We present a case of a 32-year-old COVID-19 positive male with a history of diabetes mellitus who was intubated for severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's hypoxemia failed to improve despite positive pressure ventilation, prone positioning, and use of neuromuscular blockade for ventilator asynchrony. He was evaluated by a multidisciplinary team for considering ECMO for refractory ARDS. He was initiated on venovenous ECMO via dual-site cannulation performed at the bedside. Although his ECMO course was complicated by bleeding, he showed a remarkable improvement in his lung function. ECMO was successfully decannulated after 17 days of initiation. The patient was discharged home after 47 days of hospitalization without any supplemental oxygen and was able to undergo active physical rehabilitation. A multidisciplinary approach is imperative in the initiation and management of ECMO in COVID-19 patients with severe ARDS. While ECMO is labor-intensive, using it in the right phenotype and in specialized centers may lead to positive results. Patients who are young, with fewer comorbidities and single organ dysfunction portray a better prognosis for patients in which ECMO is utilized.","Rajdev, Kartikeya; Farr, Lyndie A; Saeed, Muhammad Ahsan; Hooten, Rorak; Baus, Joseph; Boer, Brian",J Investig Med High Impact Case Rep,551,4

Due to the sudden imposition of isolation and concrete needs, Berardi suggests that death has re-entered contemporary discourse. As a consequence, he speculates that the capitalist postponement of joy may be replaced by time as enjoyment. This text critically accompanies Berardi in imagining the possible outcome of the pandemic by suggesting that it is not death but mortality that offers a pivotal use of time and enjoyment. Mortality, as Hannah Arendt defines it, extends beyond the temporality of survivalist labour and into durable works that contribute to the construction of a human world. Here it is argued that this world and its work is held together by love, in a robust philosophical sense, that is embodied by amateur practice, primarily developed in relation to the work of Bernard Stiegler. Through the work of Stiegler, Donna Haraway and Byung-Chul Han, this paper argues that, masked by professionalism and marketing, amateurism lurks in the possible ruins of pre-COVID life, ready to emerge in the key areas identified by Berardi’s texts.

Design/methodology/approach: Based on data-gathering techniques in interpretive research this study collected primary data via semi-structured interviews, interviewing informants from selected LSPs that operate on a global scale. Findings: The results show that LSPs have built their reactions and actions to the COVID-19 outbreak around five main themes: “create revenue streams,” “enhance operational transport flexibility,” “enforce digitalization and data management,” “optimize logistics infrastructure” and “optimize personnel capacity.” These pillars build the foundation to LSP resilience that enables supply chains to stay resilient during an external shock of high impact and low probability. Originality/value: The results of this study provide insights into how LSPs have managed the downsides and found innovative ways to overcome operational and financial challenges during the COVID-19 outbreak. As one of the first studies that specially focuses on the role of LSPs during the COVID-19 pandemic, this study categorizes the LSPs’ reactions and provides a “lessons learned” framework from a managerial perspective. From a theoretical perspective, this paper discusses the strategic role of LSPs in supply chain management and thereby extends current supply chain literature with a focus on LSP resilience. © 2021, David M.

However, there have been few investigations to clarify the compounds in ZZX for the treatment of anxiety. AIM OF THE STUDY: Our previous study has identified five anti-anxiety components, including hesperidin, isochlorogenic acid A, isochlorogenic acid B and isochlorogenic acid C and chlorogenic acid, from extract of ZZX. In order to find the optimal combination and the underlying mechanism of these five components in the treatment of anxiety disorder, researches were designed based on uniform design method and proteomic technology. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The samples with different proportion and content of the five active components were arranged by uniform design method. Then a mathematical model was formulated using partial least square method and stepwise regression analysis. Moreover, the empty bottle stress-induced anxiety rat model was established, and the anti-anxiety effect was recorded by the unconditioned reflex elevated maze test and the open field test. In addition, the isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) technique, along with the multidimensional liquid chromatography and high-resolution mass spectrometry were applied in proteomic study. At last, the result of proteomic analysis was further confirmed by Western blot. RESULTS: The optimal combination of the components from the extract of ZZX was 1.153 mg/kg hesperidin, 2.197 mg/kg Isochlorogenic acid A, 0.699 mg/kg Isochlorogenic acid B and 1.249 mg/kg Chlorogenic acid. Total 6818 proteins were identified using proteomic analysis and 80 differentially expressed proteins were used for further bioinformatic analysis. These proteins were involved in the neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, protein digestion and absorption, cholesterol metabolism, Chagas disease, and AGE/RAGE signaling pathway. CONCLUSIONS: The composition and proportion of anti-anxiety components in extract of ZZX was disclosed, and there was an anti-anxiety effect for the combined components of flavonoids and phenolic acids. Through proteomic analysis and Western blot, it was found that the effective components of extract of ZZX can exert synergistic anti-anxiety effects via the regulation of multi-signaling pathways.

COVID-19 has a stronger transmission capacity by inhalation of infectious aerosols and after an incubation time of 3-14 days, it may be responsible for diseases ranging from the asymptomatic to fatal consequences. COVID-19 has emerged as a multifaceted, multisystem, multi-organ disorder, which produces its pathogenic effects through a quite ubiquitous target at the level of multiple organs and in which oxidative stress and inflammatory process play relevant roles. Thus, besides the development of a pharmacological therapy, in the field of alternative and coadjutant therapeutic, the use of dietary supplements or nutraceuticals for the prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection may be a useful strategy. Herein, we specifically comment on some literature evidences, which link the food-derived antioxidants and metal-chelating agents with treatment and prevention of oxidative stress and inflammation that play a key role in the progression of COVID-19. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Oxidative stress and inflammation are key factors increasing COVID-19 severity especially in the presence of chronic diseases associated with the antioxidant system fragility. These evidences support the recommendation of antioxidants supplementation as useful strategies against COVID-19. In light with these observations, herein, a comment which describes the major antioxidants and metal-chelating agents from food sources that might be useful for the treatment and prevention of oxidative stress and inflammation during COVID-19.","Lammi, Carmen; Arnoldi, Anna",J Food Biochem,551,1

USA Procedure Reimbursement Fees (PRF) included billings in NON FAC PAR, NON FAC NON PAR, NON FAC LC, FAC PAR, FAC NON PAR and FAC LC categories. However, NON FAC PAR fees were utilized as a US Standard baseline for comparison with Ontario and Brazil. Brazilian private PRF were obtained from a single institution. Canadian billings were obtained from a single institution in Ontario (OHIP Database). Equivalency factor for standardization of PRF included the pre-COVID cost of living adjusted income (using proportionate household disposable income as a basis) and pre-COVID foreign exchange rate for each country (February 2020), relative to USA. All currency values were presented in US dollar equivalent. Results: 32 of 45 procedures met inclusion criteria with PRF present for each country. Procedures with fees not available in 1 or more countries were excluded. Brazil-USA: 19 (59%) procedures demonstrated an average of 66% lower fees in Brazil as compared to USA. Some of these procedures include varicocele embolization, portal vein embolization, uterine fibroid embolization, Gastrojejunostomy tube placement and IVC filter placement. Only 12 (37%) procedures demonstrated an average of 219% higher fees in Brazil as compared to USA. Canada-USA: 22 (69%) procedures were underpaid in Ontario (-95% to -19%). Some of these procedures include biliary stent insertion, CT-guided visceral biopsy, port insertion, cholecystostomy tube, carotid stenting, hepatic radiofrequency ablation, thoracocentesis, mesenteric stenting and suprapubic catheter insertion. 1 (3%) procedure was similar in PRF (variance within ±5%). Conclusions: Variable PRF across nations has resulted in relatively low reimbursement fees in Brazil and Canada. Based on cost-of-living adjusted income and foreign exchange rate, a PRF reform is needed, in order to standardize IRP fees in Brazil, Canada and USA.","Badar, Z.; Huang, J.",Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology,551,20

The study's objective was to introduce a methodology to assess COVID-19 home deaths by analysing the French national out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) registry (RéAC). METHODS: We performed a retrospective multicentre cohort study based on data recorded in the RéAC by 20 mobile medical teams (MMTs) between March 1st and April 15th, 2020. The participating MMTs covered 10.1% of the French population. OHCA patients were classified as probable or confirmed COVID-19 cases or as non-COVID-19 cases. To achieve our primary objective, we computed the incidence and survival at hospital admission of cases of COVID-19 OHCA occurring at home. Cardiac arrests that occurred in retirement homes or public places were excluded. Hence, we estimated the number of at-home COVID-19-related deaths that were not accounted for in the French national statistics. RESULTS: We included 670 patients with OHCA. The extrapolated annual incidence of OHCA per 100,000 inhabitants was 91.9 overall and 17.6 for COVID-19 OHCA occurring at home. In the latter group, the survival rate after being taken to the hospital after an OHCA was 10.9%. We estimated that 1322 deaths were not accounted in the French national statistics on April 15, 2020. CONCLUSIONS: The ratio of COVID-19 out-of-hospital deaths to in-hospital deaths was 12.4%, and so the national statistics underestimated the death rate.","Hubert, Hervé; Baert, Valentine; Beuscart, Jean-Baptiste; Chazard, Emmanuel",BMC Med Res Methodol,551,20

METHODS: A prospective, randomized, controlled trial was conducted among patients with post COVID-19 anosmia. One hundred patients were randomly assigned to two groups; group I included 50 patients received mometasone furoate nasal spray in an appropriate dose of 2 puff (100 µg) once daily in each nostril for 3 weeks with olfactory training, group II included 50 patients were advised to keep on olfactory training only. The assessment of smell was done using (Visual Analog Scale from 0 to 10). All patients were initially evaluated after their recovery from COVID-19 and followed up for 3 weeks. The smell scores were recorded weekly and the duration of smell loss was recorded from the onset of anosmia till the full recovery. RESULTS: In both groups, the smell scores significantly improved by the end of the third week (P < 0.001). By comparing smell scores between both groups after 1 week, 2 weeks, and 3 weeks of treatment, there were no statistically significant differences between both groups. In group I, (62%) of patients completely recovered their sense of smell after 3 weeks of treatment, compared to (52%) of patients in group II (P = 0.31). CONCLUSION: The results suggested that using mometasone furoate nasal spray as a topical corticosteroid in the treatment of post COVID-19 anosmia offers no superiority benefits over the olfactory training, regarding smell scores, duration of anosmia, and recovery rates.

The Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle is a management tool for continuous improvement of a business's products or processes. It can be applied to standardize nursing management and thus improve the nursing quality and increase the survival rate of patients. This study assessed the value of the PDCA cycle in standardizing nursing management in an intensive care unit (ICU) for patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: The status quo of the ICU was analyzed, and the relevant issues and countermeasures were proposed. The PDCA cycle was applied to standardize the nursing management in the ICU. RESULTS: Nine measures were proposed and applied to improve the management of the COVID-19 ICU: defining the clean or contaminated areas, use of self-designed shoe storage cabinets, defining staff roles and responsibilities, establishing the staffing structure, staff training, placing items at fixed locations, improving shift handover, use of bulletin boards for listing key points, and use of reserved drugs cabinets. The virus contamination awareness, professional skills, awareness of duties and responsibilities, and quality and performance of nursing were remarkably improved 2 weeks after the implementation of the above countermeasures. CONCLUSIONS: The PDCA cycle helps to standardize nursing management in COVID-19 ICU by developing and applying effective nursing management approaches.","Chen, Yihong; Zheng, Jili; Wu, Dingyun; Zhang, Yuxia; Lin, Ying",Ann Palliat Med,551,2

During this time, even if physical health is theoretically unaffected, keeping calm and sane can be challenging. The aim of this research was to evaluate whether exposure to COVID-19 information available in the digital space has a different impact on the mental condition of Romanian medical staff, compared with the general population, particularly searching for depression and anxiety symptoms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An online survey was conducted from April 6 to 16, 2020 within the Romanian users of Social Media platforms. The questionnaire assessed depression with the WHO-Five Well-Being Index, anxiety with the Generalised Anxiety Disorder Scale and Social Media exposure by asking how often the respondents saw COVID-19 related information on the most popular Social Media channels in Romania. Information about: gender, age, educational level, occupation, area of living and risk category was also collected. The risk categories were defined as no risk, medium risk and medical staff. RESULTS: Almost 90% of the 402 participants received daily through at least one Social Media channel information related to the COVID-19 outbreak. Social Media Exposure significantly associated with the risk group only for Facebook and LinkedIn. However, exposure to information regarding COVID-19 was neither associated with anxiety nor depression. No significant association was identified neither between age class and self-assessed anxiety nor self-assessed depression. The self-assessment of depression was significantly more frequent as compared with the self-assessment of anxiety. CONCLUSION: The results of this research are opposite to most of the already published literature. Depression and anxiety could not be correlated with the context of lockdown and excessive COVID-19-related information.","CordoÈ, Ariana-Anamaria; Bolboaca, Sorana D",Int J Clin Pract,551,16

COVID-19 features a state of hyperinflammation resulting in a ""cytokine storm"", which leads to severe complications, such as the development of micro-thrombosis and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Despite isolation measures, the number of affected patients is growing daily: as of June 12th, over 7.5 million cases have been confirmed worldwide, with more than 420,000 global deaths. Over 3.5 million patients have recovered from COVID-19; although this number is increasing by the day, great attention should be directed towards the possible long-term outcomes of the disease. Despite being a trivial matter for patients in intensive care units (ICUs), erectile dysfunction (ED) is a likely consequence of COVID-19 for survivors, and considering the high transmissibility of the infection and the higher contagion rates among elderly men, a worrying phenomenon for a large part of affected patients. METHODS: A literature research on the possible mechanisms involved in the development of ED in COVID-19 survivors was performed. RESULTS: Endothelial dysfunction, subclinical hypogonadism, psychological distress and impaired pulmonary hemodynamics all contribute to the potential onset of ED. Additionally, COVID-19 might exacerbate cardiovascular conditions; therefore, further increasing the risk of ED. Testicular function in COVID-19 patients requires careful investigation for the unclear association with testosterone deficiency and the possible consequences for reproductive health. Treatment with phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) inhibitors might be beneficial for both COVID-19 and ED. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 survivors might develop sexual and reproductive health issues. Andrological assessment and tailored treatments should be considered in the follow-up.","Sansone, A; Mollaioli, D; Ciocca, G; Limoncin, E; Colonnello, E; Vena, W; Jannini, E A",J. endocrinol. invest,551,24

After analysing nine weeks' news reports of Xinwen Lianbo, one of China's mainstream media, we discovered that the metaphorical war frame dominated throughout the corpus but it did not remain the same. Some of its semantic concepts like the type of war evolved over time. There are also several minor metaphors such as race, challenge, chess and combination blow metaphors, which are not as dominant as the war metaphor but should by no means be neglected. The race and challenge metaphors are complementary with the war metaphor to frame COVID-19, while the chess and combination blow metaphors are culturally loaded. What's more, literal frames like responsibility and collaboration were also found in the corpus. All frames, whether metaphorical or literal, work together to shape what COVID-19 was, what roles people should play and what people could do.

Severity of symptoms revealed that ophthalmologists above 40 years of age with more than 10 years' experienced severe stress (p = .005). Comprehensive ophthalmologists presented with severe stress and ophthalmologists practicing speciality with severe anxiety. Pearson's correlation analysis showed positive correlation between total DASS-21 score with each of the three subscales scores (DASS D, r-0.88: p < .001; DASS-A, r = 0.96: p = <0.001; DASS-S, r = 0.95: p < .001). Conclusion: Screening by Dass-21 scale has brought noticeable transient mental health issue among ophthalmologist to the fore. Few with high risk may require professional mental care to alleviate it.","Grover, Rohini; Dua, Pratham; Juneja, Supreet; Chauhan, Lokesh; Agarwal, Pradeep; Khurana, Ashi",Ophthalmic Epidemiol,551,20

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to determine the factors associated with COVID-19-related concerns, precautionary behaviors, and willingness to return to activity. METHODS: National survey data were obtained from the Democracy Fund + UCLA Nationscape Project, an ongoing cross-sectional weekly survey. The sample was provided by Lucid, a web-based market research platform. Three outcomes were evaluated: (1) COVID-19-related concerns, (2) precautionary behaviors, and (3) willingness to return to activity. Key independent variables included age, gender, race or ethnicity, education, household income, political party support, religion, news consumption, number of medication prescriptions, perceived COVID-19 status, and timing of peak COVID-19 infections by state. RESULTS: The data included 125,508 responses from web-based surveys conducted over 20 consecutive weeks during the COVID-19 pandemic (comprising approximately 6250 adults per week), between March 19 and August 5, 2020, approved by the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Institutional Review Board for analysis. A substantial number of participants were not willing to return to activity even after the restrictions were lifted. Weighted multivariate logistic regressions indicated the following groups had different outcomes (all P<.001): individuals aged &#8805;65 years (COVID-19-related concerns: OR 2.05, 95% CI 1.93-2.18; precautionary behaviors: OR 2.38, 95% CI 2.02-2.80; return to activity: OR 0.41, 95% CI 0.37-0.46 vs 18-40 years); men (COVID-19-related concerns: OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.70-0.75; precautionary behaviors: OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.67-0.81; return to activity: OR 2.00, 95% CI 1.88-2.12 vs women); taking &#8805;4 medications (COVID-19-related concerns: OR 1.47, 95% CI 1.40-1.54; precautionary behaviors: OR 1.36, 95% CI 1.20-1.555; return to activity: OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.69-0.81 vs <3 medications); Republicans (COVID-19-related concerns: OR 0.40, 95% CI 0.38-0.42; precautionary behaviors: OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.40-0.50; return to activity: OR 2.22, 95% CI 2.09-2.36 vs Democrats); and adults who reported having COVID-19 (COVID-19-related concerns: OR 1.24, 95% CI 1.12-1.39; precautionary behaviors: OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.52-0.81; return to activity: OR 3.99, 95% CI 3.48-4.58 vs those who did not). CONCLUSIONS: Participants' age, party affiliation, and perceived COVID-19 status were strongly associated with their COVID-19-related concerns, precautionary behaviors, and willingness to return to activity. Future studies need to develop and test targeted messaging approaches and consider political partisanship to encourage preventative behaviors and willingness to return to activities.","Naeim, Arash; Baxter-King, Ryan; Wenger, Neil; Stanton, Annette L; Sepucha, Karen; Vavreck, Lynn",JMIR Public Health Surveill,551,16

We use a dataset consisting of blood samples of 375 patients admitted to a hospital in the region of Wuhan, China. There are 201 patients who survived hospitalisation and 174 patients who died whilst in hospital. The focus of the paper is not only on seeing which Machine Learning model is able to obtain the absolute highest accuracy but more on the interpretation of what the Machine Learning models provides. We find that age, days in hospital, Lymphocyte and Neutrophils are important and robust predictors when predicting a patients mortality. Furthermore, the algorithms we use allows us to observe the marginal impact of each variable on a case-by-case patient level, which might help practicioneers to easily detect anomalous patterns.

The healthcare system suffered from a shortage of ICU beds and oxygenation support devices. In our Institution, most patients received chest CT at admission, only interpreted visually. Given the proven value of quantitative CT analysis (QCT) in the setting of ARDS, we tested QCT as an outcome predictor for COVID-19. METHODS: We performed a single-centre retrospective study on COVID-19 patients hospitalised from January 25, 2020, to April 28, 2020, who received CT at admission prompted by respiratory symptoms such as dyspnea or desaturation. QCT was performed using a semi-automated method (3D Slicer). Lungs were divided by Hounsfield unit intervals. Compromised lung (%CL) volume was the sum of poorly and non-aerated volumes (- 500, 100 HU). We collected patient's clinical data including oxygenation support throughout hospitalisation. RESULTS: Two hundred twenty-two patients (163 males, median age 66, IQR 54-6) were included; 75% received oxygenation support (20% intubation rate). Compromised lung volume was the most accurate outcome predictor (logistic regression, p < 0.001). %CL values in the 6-23% range increased risk of oxygenation support; values above 23% were at risk for intubation. %CL showed a negative correlation with PaO2/FiO2 ratio (p < 0.001) and was a risk factor for in-hospital mortality (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: QCT provides new metrics of COVID-19.

Nous avons comparé la proportion de souches d’E. coli producteur de bêta-lactamase à spectre étendu (E. coli-BLSE) dans les prélèvements cliniques réalisés en soins communautaires et en Ehpad en France avant et après le confinement lors de la 1re vague de COVID-19. Matériels et méthodes Les antibiogrammes d’E. coli réalisés sur les prélèvements cliniques analysés par les laboratoires privés de 11 régions françaises participant au réseau de surveillance ont été inclus entre le 01/01/2019 et le 31/12/2020. Les données démographiques des patients ont également été comparées. Le taux de BLSE a été calculé en divisant le nombre d’E. coli-BLSE par le nombre total de souche d’E. coli. Les taux avant et après la phase de confinement ont été comparés par analyse univariée après stratification par sexe, âge, type de prélèvement et localisation géographique. Une analyse de série chronologique interrompue a été effectuée pour évaluer les modifications de tendance de taux d’E. coli-BLSE avant, pendant et après le confinement général de la population en mars 2020 en France. Résultats Les laboratoires participants ont transmis 535 843 antibiogrammes d’E. coli, dont 18 901 réalisés en Ehpad. Les souches analysées provenaient à 99,3% de prélèvements urinaires. En soins primaires, la proportion de E.coli-BLSE était de 3,2% (mini-maxi mensuels: 2,9 %–3,4 %) avant mars 2020 et 3,0 % (2 %–3,2 %) à partir de mai 2010 (p&lt;0,001). Avant mars 2020, le taux de E. coli-BLSE progressait lentement (augmentation de 0,0005 %/mois). Une diminution significative du nombre de prélèvements positifs à E.coli était observé pendant le confinement comparativement à la même période en 2019 (−15,2%, p&lt;0,001). À partir du 11 mai 2020, le taux d’E. coli-BLSE diminuait de 0,03 %/mois. Cette décroissance amorcée après le confinement s’est maintenue jusqu’à la fin de l’année. Des différences significatives entre les deux périodes étaient par ailleurs constatées chez les femmes (2,7 % vs 2,5 %, p&lt;0,01), chez les 40–64 ans (2,7 % vs 2,5 %, p&lt;0,01) et dans l’Est de la France (3,1 % vs 2,7 %, p=0,02). En Ehpad, la proportion d’E. coli-BLSE était de 10 % (mini-maxi mensuels : 8,2 %–12,0 %) avant mars 2020 et de 8,9 % (7,6 %–9,7 %) après mai 2020 (p&lt;0,001). Avant mars 2020, le taux d’E. coli-BLSE évoluait à la baisse (−0,08%/mois). Ce taux de décroissance ralentissait à–0,04 %/mois à partir du mois de mai 2020. Dans cette population, il était constaté des différences significatives entre les deux périodes pour les individus de la tranche d’âge 85–94 ans (10,0 % vs 8,7%, p=0,03) et dans la région Ouest (7,5 % vs 5,4 %, p&lt;0,01). Conclusion Ces résultats suggèrent de potentiels impacts de la pandémie de COVID-19 sur l’épidémiologie des E. coli-BLSE en France. Des modifications de comportement de prescription d’antibiotiques, de brassage de population et de maîtrise des infections pourraient expliquer ces modifications observées et nécessitent d’être explorés.","Lemenand, O.; Coeffic, T.; Thibaut, S.; Caillon, J.; Birgand, G.",Infectious Diseases Now,551,12

In doing so we should build on each of our strengths and expertise, and try to provide new insights rather than becoming yet another voice commenting on the same set of questions with limited evidence.","Edwards, Jessie K; Lessler, Justin",Am. j. epidemiol,551,12

The world was slow to react to the developing crisis, but once the contours of the impending calamity became evident, the different state and non-state actors have raced to put their act together. The COVID-19 pandemic has blatantly exposed the shortcomings of our healthcare system and the limitations of medical science, despite considerable advances in recent years. To effectively tackle the current pandemic, almost unprecedented in the modern age, there is an urgent need for a concerted, sustained, and coordinated effort towards the development of new diagnostics, therapeutic and vaccines, and the ramping up of the healthcare infrastructure, especially in the poorer underprivileged nations. Towards this end, researchers around the world are working tirelessly to develop new diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics. Efforts to develop a vaccine against COVID-19 are presently underway in several countries around the world, but a new vaccine is expected only by the end of the year-at the earliest. New drug development against COVID-19 and its approval may take even longer. Under such circumstances, drug repurposing has emerged as a realistic and effective strategy to counter the current menace, and several antiviral and antimalarial medicines are currently in different stages of clinical trials. Researchers are also experimenting with nutrients, vitamins, monoclonal antibodies, and convalescent plasma as immunity boosters against the SARS-CoV-2. This report presents a critical analysis of the global clinical trial landscape for COVID-19 with an emphasis on the therapeutic agents and vaccines currently being tested at pandemic speed.","Ahamad, Shakir; Branch, Scotty; Harrelson, Shea; Hussain, Mohd Kamil; Saquib, Mohammad; Khan, Saeed",Eur J Med Chem,551,24

Does the same theory also explain variation in phenotypic error rates and in abundance of error mitigation mechanisms? Translational read-through provides a model to investigate both issues as it is common, mostly non-adaptive, and has good proxy for rate (TAA being the least leaky stop codon) and potential error mitigation via ""fail-safe"" 3' additional stop codons (ASCs). Prior theory of translational read-through has suggested that when population sizes are high, weak selection for local mitigation can be effective thus predicting a positive correlation between ASC enrichment and Ne. Contra to prediction, we find that ASC enrichment is not correlated with Ne. ASC enrichment, while highly phylogenetically patchy, is, however, more common both in unicellular species and in genes expressed in unicellular modes in multicellular species. By contrast, Ne does positively correlate with TAA enrichment. These results imply that local phenotypic error rates, not local mitigation rates, are consistent with a drift barrier/nearly-neutral model.","Ho, Alexander T; Hurst, Laurence D",Mol. biol. evol,551,29

Iran is one of the top 10 most affected countries. Search engines provide useful data from populations, and these data might be useful to analyze epidemics. Utilizing data mining methods on electronic resources' data might provide a better insight into the COVID-19 outbreak to manage the health crisis in each country and worldwide. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to predict the incidence of COVID-19 in Iran. METHODS: Data were obtained from the Google Trends website. Linear regression and long short-term memory (LSTM) models were used to estimate the number of positive COVID-19 cases. All models were evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation, and root mean square error (RMSE) was used as the performance metric. RESULTS: The linear regression model predicted the incidence with an RMSE of 7.562 (SD 6.492). The most effective factors besides previous day incidence included the search frequency of handwashing, hand sanitizer, and antiseptic topics. The RMSE of the LSTM model was 27.187 (SD 20.705). CONCLUSIONS: Data mining algorithms can be employed to predict trends of outbreaks. This prediction might support policymakers and health care managers to plan and allocate health care resources accordingly.","Ayyoubzadeh, Seyed Mohammad; Ayyoubzadeh, Seyed Mehdi; Zahedi, Hoda; Ahmadi, Mahnaz; R Niakan Kalhori, Sharareh",JMIR Public Health Surveill,551,16

Because it has only been studied for just over three months, our understanding of this disease is still incomplete, particularly regarding its sequelae and long-term outcomes. Moreover, very little has been written about the rehabilitation needs of patients with COVID-19 after discharge from acute care. The objective of this report is to answer the question ""What rehabilitation services do survivors of COVID-19 require?"" The question was asked within the context of a subacute hospital delivering geriatric inpatient and outpatient rehabilitation services. Three areas relevant to rehabilitation after COVID-19 were identified. First, details of how patients may present have been summarized, including comorbidities, complications from an intensive care unit stay with or without intubation, and the effects of the virus on multiple body systems, including those pertaining to cardiac, neurological, cognitive, and mental health. Second, I have suggested procedures regarding the design of inpatient rehabilitation units for COVID-19 survivors, staffing issues, and considerations for outpatient rehabilitation. Third, guidelines for rehabilitation (physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech-language pathology) following COVID-19 have been proposed with respect to recovery of the respiratory system as well as recovery of mobility and function. A thorough assessment and an individualized, progressive treatment plan which focuses on function, disability, and return to participation in society will help each patient to maximize their function and quality of life. Careful consideration of the rehabilitation environment will ensure that all patients recover as completely as possible.","Sheehy, Lisa Mary",JMIR Public Health Surveill,551,23

We employ an epidemic model SIPHERD in which three categories of infection carriers, symptomatic, purely asymptomatic, and exposed are considered with different transmission rates that are taken dependent on the social distancing conditions, and the detection rate of the infected carriers is taken dependent on the tests done per day. The model is first validated for Germany and South Korea and then applied for prediction of the total number of confirmed, active and dead, and daily new positive cases in the United States. Our study predicts the possible outcomes of the infection if social distancing conditions are relaxed or kept stringent. We estimate that around 30.1 million people are already infected, and in the absence of any vaccine, 66.2 million (range: 64.3-68.0) people, or 20% (range: 19.4-20.5) of the population will be infected by mid-February 21 if social distancing conditions are not made stringent.

Since February 2020, multiple, consecutive ED closures have occurred due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) crisis in Daegu. However, sudden ED closures are in contravention of laws for the provision of emergency medical care that enable the public to avail prompt, appropriate, and 24-hour emergency medical care. Therefore, this study ascertained the vulnerability of the ED at tertiary hospitals in Daegu with regard to the current standards. A revised triage and surveillance protocol has been proposed to tackle the current crisis. METHODS: This study was retrospectively conducted at 6 level 1 or 2 EDs in a metropolitan city where ED closure due to COVID-19 occurred from February 18 to March 26, 2020. The present status of ED closure and patient characteristics and findings from chest radiography and laboratory investigations were assessed. Based on the experience from repeated ED closures and the modified systems that are currently used in EDs, revised triage and surveillance protocols have been developed and proposed. RESULTS: During the study period, 6 level 1 or 2 emergency rooms included in the study were shut down 27 times for 769 hours. Thirty-one confirmed COVID-19 cases, of whom 7 died, were associated with the incidence of ED closure. Typical patient presentation with respiratory symptoms of COVID-19 was seen in less than 50% of patients, whereas abnormal findings on chest imaging investigations were detected in 93.5% of the study population. The chest radiography facility, resuscitation rooms, and triage area were moved to locations outside the ED, and a new surveillance protocol was applied to determine the factors warranting quarantine, including symptoms, chest radiographic findings, and exposure to a source of infection. The incidence of ED closures decreased after the implementation of the revised triage and surveillance protocols. CONCLUSION: Triage screening by emergency physicians and surveillance protocols with an externally located chest imaging facility were effective in the early isolation of COVID-19 patients. In future outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases, efforts should be focused toward the provision of continued ED treatment with the implementation of revised triage and surveillance protocols.","Chung, Han Sol; Lee, Dong Eun; Kim, Jong Kun; Yeo, In Hwan; Kim, Changho; Park, Jungbae; Seo, Kang Suk; Park, Sin Yul; Kim, Jung Ho; Kim, Gyunmoo; Lee, Suk Hee; Cheon, Jeon Jae; Kim, Yang Hun",J Korean Med Sci,551,24

They are all highly contagious and have severe pulmonary complications. Clinically, patients with COVID-19 run a rapidly progressive course of an acute respiratory tract infection with fever, sore throat, cough, headache and fatigue, complicated by severe pneumonia often leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The infection also involves other organs throughout the body. In all three viral illnesses, the fibrinolytic system plays an active role in each phase of the pathogenesis. During transmission, the renin-aldosterone-angiotensin-system (RAAS) is involved with the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, attaching to its natural receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE 2) in host cells. Both tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) are closely linked to the RAAS. In lesions in the lung, kidney and other organs, the two plasminogen activators urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), along with their inhibitor, plasminogen activator 1 (PAI-1), are involved. The altered fibrinolytic balance enables the development of a hypercoagulable state. In this article, evidence for the central role of fibrinolysis is reviewed, and the possible drug targets at multiple sites in the fibrinolytic pathways are discussed.","Kwaan, Hau C; Lindholm, Paul F",Int. j. mol. sci.

SARS-CoV-2 nsp12, its RNA polymerase, shares homology in the nucleotide uptake channel with the HCV orthologue enzyme NS5B. Besides, HCV enzyme NS5A has pleiotropic activities, such as RNA binding, that are shared with various SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Thus, anti-HCV NS5B and NS5A inhibitors, like sofosbuvir and daclatasvir, respectively, could be endowed with anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. METHODS: SARS-CoV-2-infected Vero cells, HuH-7 cells, Calu-3 cells, neural stem cells and monocytes were used to investigate the effects of daclatasvir and sofosbuvir. In silico and cell-free based assays were performed with SARS-CoV-2 RNA and nsp12 to better comprehend the mechanism of inhibition of the investigated compounds. A physiologically based pharmacokinetic model was generated to estimate daclatasvir's dose and schedule to maximize the probability of success for COVID-19. RESULTS: Daclatasvir inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero, HuH-7 and Calu-3 cells, with potencies of 0.8, 0.6 and 1.1 µM, respectively. Although less potent than daclatasvir, sofosbuvir alone and combined with daclatasvir inhibited replication in Calu-3 cells. Sofosbuvir and daclatasvir prevented virus-induced neuronal apoptosis and release of cytokine storm-related inflammatory mediators, respectively. Sofosbuvir inhibited RNA synthesis by chain termination and daclatasvir targeted the folding of secondary RNA structures in the SARS-CoV-2 genome.

It offers some new theoretical concepts to make sense of emerging contemporary public leadership practices, namely: leaders-hip hop;charismatic followership;and digital fabrication of charisma (digital charisma). Design/methodology/approach The paper is based on a single case study, and it relies on qualitative data coming from multiple sources and collected at different points of time, specifically interviews, participant and non-participant observations from an ethnography conducted in 2009;interviews conducted between 2019 and 2020, and an analysis of the posts made within one Facebook group between February and May 2016. Findings The paper focuses on three stories of local political leadership at three different points in time which describe three leadership practices: political managerialism;charismatic followership;and hands-on relational leadership. It highlights the importance of hands-on relational leadership through popular acts of leadership which are performed face to face and/or on social media and the shift in the dominant technologies of local political leadership from the logic of managerialism toward the logic of social media. Research limitations/implications The paper is focused on a limited temporal (2009-2019) and sociocultural context (North Italy). Findings are presented as three stories, although other ways of showing qualitative data could have been used. Practical implications Practical implications deal with the attempt to enable a reflexive view of local governance and public leadership attentive to soft and sociocultural variables. It is important to consider these implications for the purposes of training and learning. Originality/value The paper introduces new concepts to understand contemporary public leadership practices;it combines insights from a decentered theory of governance and collective theories of leadership;and it makes use of storytelling as a method for analyzing and reporting the findings.","Sancino, A.",International Journal of Public Leadership,551,16

At the onset, coronavirus disease 2019 can present as any other acute febrile undifferentiated illness. In tropical regions, clinicians are increasingly challenged to differentiate these febrile illnesses without the use of diagnostics. With this pandemic, many of these tropical diseases are neglected and go underreported. Dengue is holoendemic in the Maldives, and dengue viruses circulate throughout the year. Reports about coinfections with dengue virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 are scarce, and the outcome and the dynamics of the disease may be altered in the presence of coinfection. We have described the clinical manifestation and serial laboratory profile, and highlighted the atypical findings uncommon in dengue infection. CASE PRESENTATION: Case 1 was a 39-year old Asian male, presented on day 6 of dengue infection with warning signs. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 that was done as per hospital protocol was found to be positive. Case 2 was a 38-year old Asian male, was admitted on day 5 of illness with symptoms of acute respiratory infection with positive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Evaluation of progressive leukopenia and thrombocytopenia showed positive dengue serology. CONCLUSION: Clinicians must be conscientious when working on the differential diagnosis of possible tropical diseases in cases of coronavirus disease 2019, specifically, when patients develop hemoconcentration, thrombocytopenia, and transaminitis with elevated expression of aspartate higher than alanine transaminase, which is frequently observed in dengue infection. Caution must be taken during the administration of intravenous fluids when treating patients with coronavirus disease 2019 and dengue coinfection, as coronavirus disease 2019 patients are more prone to develop pulmonary edema. Timely diagnosis and appropriate management are essential to avoid the devastating complications of severe forms of dengue infection. It is important to repeat and reconfirm the dengue serology in coronavirus disease 2019 patients to avoid false positivity. Diligence and care must be taken not to neglect other endemic tropical diseases in the region during the present pandemic.","Hilmy, Abdullah Isneen; Dey, Rajib Kumar; Imad, Hisham Ahmed; Yoosuf, Abdul Azeez; Nazeem, Ali; Latheef, Ali Abdulla",J Med Case Rep,551,1

We conducted a descriptive analysis using public health data to describe age- and sex-specific acute care use, length of stay (LOS) and mortality associated with COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a descriptive analysis using Ontario's Case and Contact Management Plus database of individuals who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Ontario from Mar. 1 to Sept. 30, 2020, to determine age- and sex-specific hospital admissions, intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, use of invasive mechanical ventilation, LOS and mortality. We stratified analyses by month of infection to study temporal trends and conducted subgroup analyses by long-term care residency. RESULTS: During the observation period, 56 476 individuals testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 were reported; 41 049 (72.7%) of these were younger than 60 years, and 29 196 (51.7%) were female. Proportion of cases shifted from older populations (> 60 yr) to younger populations (10-39 yr) over time. Overall, 5383 (9.5%) of individuals were admitted to hospital; of these, 1183 (22.0%) were admitted to the ICU, and 712 (60.2%) of these received invasive mechanical ventilation. Mean LOS for individuals in the ward, ICU without invasive mechanical ventilation and ICU with invasive mechanical ventilation was 12.8 (standard deviation [SD] 15.4), 8.5 (SD 7.8) and 20.5 (SD 18.1) days, respectively. Among patients receiving care in the ward, ICU without invasive mechanical ventilation and ICU with invasive mechanical ventilation, 911/3834 (23.8%), 124/418 (29.7%) and 287/635 (45.2%) died, respectively. All outcomes varied by age and decreased over time, overall and within age groups. INTERPRETATION: This descriptive study shows use of acute care and mortality varying by age and decreasing between March and September 2020 in Ontario. Improvements in clinical practice and changing risk distributions among those infected may contribute to fewer severe outcomes.","Mac, Stephen; Barrett, Kali; Khan, Yasin A; Naimark, David M J; Rosella, Laura; Ximenes, Raphael; Sander, Beate",CMAJ Open,551,1

First and foremost, the spread of cross-border infectious disease arouses a great deal of media and public interest, just as it drives research priorities of faculty and academic programmes. At the same time, Global Health has become a major area of philanthropic action. Despite the importance it has acquired over the last two decades, the complex collective term ""Global Health"" still lacks a uniform use today. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this paper is to present the existing definitions of Global Health, and analyse their meaning and implications. The paper emphasises that the term ""Global Health"" goes beyond the territorial meaning of ""global"", connects local and global, and refers to an explicitly political concept. Global Health regards health as a rights-based, universal good; it takes into account social inequalities, power asymmetries, the uneven distribution of resources and governance challenges. Thus, it represents the necessary continuance of Public Health in the face of diverse and ubiquitous global challenges. A growing number of international players, however, focus on public-private partnerships and privatisation and tend to promote biomedical reductionism through predominantly technological solutions. Moreover, the predominant Global Health concept reflects the inherited hegemony of the Global North. It takes insufficient account of the global burden of disease, which is mainly characterised by non-communicable conditions, and the underlying social determinants of health. CONCLUSIONS: Beyond resilience and epidemiological preparedness for preventing cross-border disease threats, Global Health must focus on the social, economic and political determinants of health. Biomedical and technocratic reductionism might be justified in times of acute health crises but entails the risk of selective access to health care. Consistent health-in-all policies are required for ensuring Health for All and sustainably reducing health inequalities within and among countries. Global Health must first and foremost pursue the enforcement of the universal right to health and contribute to overcoming global hegemony.","Holst, Jens",Global Health,551,1

Beyond that, new experimental mouthwashes were investigated in terms of a possible positive immune modulation, which might offer an additional opportunity for a positive pharmaceutical effect. METHODS: The effectivity of the mouth washing solution was determined on 34 hospitalized COVID-19 patients by measuring the viral load by RT-qPCR in pharyngeal swabs, which were taken before and after rinsing. The inflammatory modulation thru the experimental solutions was assayed in an in vitro model of virus infected nasopharyngeal epithelium cells. RESULTS: The clinical pilot study demonstrated that the mouth rinsing solution was able to reduce the viral load by about 90% in the saliva of most patients. This reduction was determined to persist for about 6 h. In the experimental solutions, the ingredients dexpanthenol and zinc were able to reduce the expression of proinflammatory cytokines in the cell culture model, while the antiviral response was not altered significantly. CONCLUSION: We recommend the application of mouth wash solutions to COVID-19 patients, since our results indicate a reduction in infectivity and might govern the protection of health care professionals. Further improvement to the over the counter formulation can be made by utilizing zinc and dexpanthenol, as they which might be beneficial for the patients' health.","Schürmann, Matthias; Aljubeh, Mohamed; Tiemann, Carsten; Sudhoff, Holger",Eur. arch. oto-rhino-laryngol,551,16

Zeina Durra, 2020) and Monsoon (Hong Khaou, 2020). Taking liminality as the embodiment of transitional periods, defined by questions and possibility rather than by answers that provide closure, Qureshi explores the quiet revelations of these two films, both of which follow protagonists who find themselves adrift between cultures, and between the past, present, and future. While reminiscent of the cinematic travelogue and films of flânerie, both Luxor and Monsoon expand these concepts—historically, the privileged domain of the white, male wanderer—while avoiding overt identity politics in the service of timeless, universal themes of loss, healing, and transition.","Qureshi, Bilal",Film Quarterly,551,21

Although PPE is mandated for all healthcare workers, variability exists in choice and availability. The purpose of this study was to determine patient perception of physician attire during the COVID-19 pandemic in an outpatient setting. METHODS: Three hundred sixty-eight patients who presented to our outpatient orthopaedic clinics completed an anonymous survey. In addition to demographic characteristics, patient preferences for attire, PPE, and social distancing were obtained. RESULTS: Scrubs (81%, 298/368) were found to be the most acceptable physician attire. Eye protection (34.2%, 126/368) and gloves (32.6%, 120/368), however, were deemed much less acceptable;93.5% (344/368) of patients reported that no mask was unacceptable, with 41.0% (151/368) preferring a surgical mask. Predilection for a surgical mask and N95 rose with increasing patient education level. Interestingly, 55.2% (203/368) responded that physicians should stop wearing PPE only when the Center for Disease Control recommends. CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, most of the patients found scrubs to be the most acceptable attire in an office-based outpatient setting. Patients also found physician mask-wearing to be important but are less accepting of providers wearing eye and hand protection.","Omari, A. M.; Sodha, S.; Koerner, J. D.; Alberta, F. G.; Levine, H.

This approach is limited by the shortage of radiology experts who can provide a timely interpretation of these images. Motivated by this challenge, our paper proposes a novel learning architecture, called Detail-Oriented Capsule Networks (DECAPS), for the automatic diagnosis of COVID-19 from Computed Tomography (CT) scans. Our network combines the strength of Capsule Networks with several architecture improvements meant to boost classification accuracies. First, DECAPS uses an Inverted Dynamic Routing mechanism which increases model stability by preventing the passage of information from non-descriptive regions. Second, DECAPS employs a Peekaboo training procedure which uses a two-stage patch crop and drop strategy to encourage the network to generate activation maps for every target concept. The network then uses the activation maps to focus on regions of interest and combines both coarse and fine-grained representations of the data. Finally, we use a data augmentation method based on conditional generative adversarial networks to deal with the issue of data scarcity. Our model achieves 84.3% precision, 91.5% recall, and 96.1% area under the ROC curve, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods. We compare the performance of the DECAPS model with three experienced, well-trained thoracic radiologists and show that the architecture significantly outperforms them. While further studies on larger datasets are required to confirm this finding, our results imply that architectures like DECAPS can be used to assist radiologists in the CT scan mediated diagnosis of COVID-19.","Mobiny, Aryan; Cicalese, Pietro Antonio; Zare, Samira; Yuan, Pengyu; Abavisani, Mohammadsajad; Wu, Carol C.; Ahuja, Jitesh; Groot, Patricia M. de; Nguyen, Hien Van",,551,21

Although the treatment of BPPV is relatively successful, many patients suffer recurrence after treatment. Therefore, identifying potential risk factors for BPPV recurrence may help improve treatment outcome and patient prognosis. However, some related risk factors for BPPV recurrence are relatively controversial and poorly studied. This meta-analysis aims to identify potential risk factors associated with BPPV recurrence, thereby reducing the recurrence rate of BPPV and improving the prognosis of patients. METHODS: This meta-analysis was conducted through systematically searching PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library for eligible English original studies published up to June 2020. All search results were reviewed based on our inclusion and exclusion criteria. We calculated the pooled odds ratios (ORs) or the mean differences (MDs) with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to evaluate the effects of included risk factors on BPPV recurrence. RESULTS: A total of 14 studies involving 3060 BPPV patients published between 2010 and 2019 were finally included, including six prospective studies and eight retrospective studies, with a NOS score ranged from 6 to 9. Our pooled results of this meta-analysis suggested that the recurrence of BPPV was closely related to female gender (OR = 1.42; 95% CI 1.17-1.74; P = 0.0004), hypertension (OR = 2.61; 95% CI 1.22-5.59; P = 0.01), diabetes mellitus (OR = 2.62; 95% CI 1.25-5.48; P = 0.01), hyperlipidemia (OR = 1.60; 95% CI 1.23-2.09; P = 0.0006), osteoporosis (OR = 1.72; 95% CI 1.03-2.88; P = 0.04) and vitamin D deficiency (MD = - 3.29; 95% CI - 5.32 to - 1.26; P = 0.001). CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis indicated that female gender, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, osteoporosis, and vitamin D deficiency were risk factors for BPPV recurrence. However, the effects of other potential risk factors including advanced age, migraine, head trauma, and Menière's disease on BPPV recurrence need further investigations. Furthermore, most studies included in this meta-analysis were performed in Asia, so our results cannot easily be extended to the whole world population. Therefore, more large-scale prospective studies in different countries are required to further investigate these risk factors.","Chen, Jinbao; Zhang, Senlin; Cui, Kai; Liu, Chuxuan",J. neurol,551,6

Accordingly, the current study aimed to summarize the magnitudes and determinants of the psychological impact of coronavirus among health care professionals. Methods: The studies from Medline via PubMed, Science Direct, and Google Scholar were searched from 5 September to 19 October 2020. The review was conducted as per PRISMA-2009 (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses). Result: Initially, 6316 articles were searched from three databases (PubMed, Science Direct, and Google Scholar). Finally, 20 articles were filtered to be included in our review. Among different types of psychological impact, stress was reported that lies within the range from 5.2% to 100%, anxiety was reported from 11.1% to 100%, depression was from 10.6% to 58%, and insomnia was from 28.75% to 34%. Several factors were related to the negative psychological state of health care workers due to coronavirus disease-19 like educational level, occupation, gender, age, working environment, work experience, legal status, ethnicity, psychological comorbidity, social support, personal/family exposure, and feeling of health care providers. Conclusion: The most common psychological impacts among health care workers were anxiety and stress. Besides different sociodemographic factors that determine the psychological impacts, front-line health care workers and participants having psychological comorbidity have a high risk of negative psychological state impacts as compared to their counterparts. Therefore, special attention should tend to health care workers directly involved in the prevention and management of coronavirus disease-19 and having a different risk of mental health condition.","Bekele, F.; Hajure, M.",SAGE Open Medicine,551,1

They add further distress to the lives of people in Syria, who have already endured 9 years of war. This study evaluates distress and the major causes of concerns related to COVID-19 during the full lockdown. Methods: Online questionnaires were distributed using SPTSS, K10, and MSPSS which were used with other demographic, war- and COVID-19-related questions that were taken from The (CRISIS) V0.1 Adult Self-Report Baseline Form. Results: Our sample included 5,588 with the mean age of 26.84 ± 7.815 years. Of those, only one case of COVID-19 was confirmed. Over 42.7% had two or more positive PTSD symptoms, 42.6% had moderate or severe mental disorder, but only 14.9% had low social support. Higher PTSD and K10 scores overall were seen in female participants and with most of war variables (P < 0.05). Relationships with the partner being negatively affected and distress from a decline in ability to work and provide food were the most prominent. Conclusions: The indirect effects of COVID-19 are far more than that of the pathogen itself. A reduced ability to earn and to provide food were the main concerns indicated in this study. Relationships deteriorated in participants with high K10 and PTSD scores who also had more symptoms and used more hypnotics in the last four weeks. Smoking patterns were not related to K10 and PTSD. Social support played a role in reducing stress, but when relationships were affected, lower support was observed.","Kakaje, Ameer; Fadel, Ammar; Makki, Leen; Ghareeb, Ayham; Al Zohbi, Ragheed",Front Public Health,551,20

METHODS: In this study, explanatory variables (n = 46) including climatic, topographic, socio-economic, and demographic factors were compiled at the county level across the continental US. Machine learning algorithms - logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), gradient boosting decision trees (GBDT), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and support vector machine (SVM) - were used to predict the presence/absence of hotspots (P < 0.05) for elevated age-adjusted LRI mortality rates in a geographic information system framework. RESULTS: Overall, there was a historical shift in hotspots away from the western United States into the southeastern parts of the country and they were highly localized in a few counties. The two decision tree methods (RF and GBDT) outperformed the other algorithms (accuracies: 0.92; F1-scores: 0.85 and 0.84; area under the precision-recall curve: 0.84 and 0.83, respectively). Moreover, the results of the RF and GBDT indicated that higher spring minimum temperature, increased winter precipitation, and higher annual median household income were among the most substantial factors in predicting the hotspots.

Currently the reference diagnostic technique for virus determination is Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) real time analysis that requires specialized equipment, reagents and facilities and typically 3-4 h to perform. Thus, the realization of simple, low-cost, small-size, rapid and point-of-care diagnostics tests has become a global priority. In response to the current need for quick, highly sensitive and on-site detection of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in several aqueous solutions, a specific molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) receptor has been designed, realized, and combined with an optical sensor. More specifically, the proof of concept of a SARS-CoV-2 sensor has been demonstrated by exploiting a plasmonic plastic optical fiber sensor coupled with a novel kind of synthetic MIP nano-layer, especially designed for the specific recognition of Subunit 1 of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. First, we have tested the effectiveness of the developed MIP receptor to bind the Subunit 1 of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, then the results of preliminary tests on SARS-CoV-2 virions, performed on samples of nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs in universal transport medium (UTM) and physiological solution (0.9% NaCl), were compared with those obtained with RT-PCR. According to these preliminary results, the sensitivity of the proposed optical-chemical sensor proved to be higher than the RT-PCR one.

Multilevel logistic regression models were used to estimate the association between the census block-level predictors and COVID-19 infection, independently of age, sex, country of birth, and preexisting health conditions. All the variables were significantly associated with the outcome, with different effects before and after the lockdown and according to the province of residence. This suggests a pattern of socioeconomic inequalities in the outbreak, which should be taken into account in the eventuality of future epidemics to contain their spread and its related disparities.","Consolazio, David; Murtas, Rossella; Tunesi, Sara; Gervasi, Federico; Benassi, David; Russo, Antonio Giampiero",Int J Health Serv,551,24

Challenges and tips for radiologists in follow-up of a novel patient cohort,16.376614,5.557933,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been a serious obstacle in front of public health. Interferon-beta 1a (IFN-ß 1a) has been used to treat patients with COVID-19. We aimed to compare the effectiveness of high-dose IFN-ß 1a compared to low dose IFN-ß 1a in severe COVID-19 cases. METHODS: In this randomized, controlled, and clinical trial, eligible patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections were randomly assigned to receive one of the two following therapeutic regimens: The intervention group was treated with high-dose IFN-ß 1a (Recigen) (Subcutaneous injections of 88 µg (24 million IU) on days 1, 3, 6) + lopinavir /ritonavir (Kaletra) (400 mg/100 mg twice a day for 10 days, orally) and the control group was treated with low-dose IFN-ß 1a (Recigen) (Subcutaneous injections of 44 µg (12 million IU) on days 1, 3, 6) + lopinavir /ritonavir (Kaletra) (400 mg/100 mg twice a day for 10 days, orally). RESULT: A total of 168 COVID- 19 confirmed patients underwent randomization; 83 were assigned to the intervention group and 85 were assigned to the control group. Median Time To Clinical Improvement (TTIC) for cases treated with low-dose IFN-ß1a was shorter than that for cases treated with high-dose IFN-ß1a (6 vs 10 days; P = 0.018). The mortality rates in intervention and control group were 41% and 36.5%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The use of high-dose IFN-ß 1a did not improve TTCI in hospitalized patients with moderate to severe COVID-19. Also, it did not have any significant effect on mortality reduction compared with treating with low-dose IFN-ß 1a.

Fine particles are, in fact, those most capable of penetrating in depth into the respiratory system. People spend most of their time indoors where concentrations of some pollutants are sometimes higher than outdoors. Therefore, there is the need to ensure a healthy indoor environment and for this purpose the use of an air purifier can be a valuable aid especially now since it was demonstrated that indoor air quality has a high impact on spreading of viral infections such as that due to SARS-COVID19. In this study, we tested a commercial system that can be used as an air purifier. In particular it was verified its efficiency in reducing concentrations of PM10 (particles with aerodynamic diameter less than 10 µm), PM2.5 (particles with aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 µm), PM1 (particles with aerodynamic diameter less than 1 µm), and particles number in the range 0.3 µm-10 µm. Furthermore, its capacity in reducing VOCs concentration was also checked. PM measurements were carried out by means of a portable optical particle counter (OPC) instrument simulating the working conditions typical of a household environment. In particular we showed that the tested air purifier significantly reduced both PM10 and PM2.5 by 16.8 and 7.25 times respectively that corresponds to a reduction of about 90% and 80%. A clear reduction of VOCs concentrations was also observed since a decrease of over 50% of these gaseous substances was achieved.","Fermo, Paola; Artíñano, Begoña; De Gennaro, Gianluigi; Pantaleo, Antonio Marco; Parente, Alessandro; Battaglia, Fiorella; Colicino, Elena; Di Tanna, Gianluca; Goncalves da Silva Junior, Andouglas; Pereira, Igor Gadelha; Garcia, Gabriel Santos; Garcia Goncalves, Luiz Marcos; Comite, Valeria; Miani, Alessandro",Environ Res,551,1

Our 2020 edition of this review showed thoracic (chest) imaging to be sensitive and moderately specific in the diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In this update, we include new relevant studies, and have removed studies with case-control designs, and those not intended to be diagnostic test accuracy studies. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of thoracic imaging (computed tomography (CT), X-ray and ultrasound) in people with suspected COVID-19. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the COVID-19 Living Evidence Database from the University of Bern, the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, The Stephen B. Thacker CDC Library, and repositories of COVID-19 publications through to 30 September 2020. We did not apply any language restrictions. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included studies of all designs, except for case-control, that recruited participants of any age group suspected to have COVID-19 and that reported estimates of test accuracy or provided data from which we could compute estimates. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The review authors independently and in duplicate screened articles, extracted data and assessed risk of bias and applicability concerns using the QUADAS-2 domain-list. We presented the results of estimated sensitivity and specificity using paired forest plots, and we summarised pooled estimates in tables. We used a bivariate meta-analysis model where appropriate. We presented the uncertainty of accuracy estimates using 95% confidence intervals (CIs). MAIN RESULTS: We included 51 studies with 19,775 participants suspected of having COVID-19, of whom 10,155 (51%) had a final diagnosis of COVID-19. Forty-seven studies evaluated one imaging modality each, and four studies evaluated two imaging modalities each. All studies used RT-PCR as the reference standard for the diagnosis of COVID-19, with 47 studies using only RT-PCR and four studies using a combination of RT-PCR and other criteria (such as clinical signs, imaging tests, positive contacts, and follow-up phone calls) as the reference standard. Studies were conducted in Europe (33), Asia (13), North America (3) and South America (2); including only adults (26), all ages (21), children only (1), adults over 70 years (1), and unclear (2); in inpatients (2), outpatients (32), and setting unclear (17). Risk of bias was high or unclear in thirty-two (63%) studies with respect to participant selection, 40 (78%) studies with respect to reference standard, 30 (59%) studies with respect to index test, and 24 (47%) studies with respect to participant flow. For chest CT (41 studies, 16,133 participants, 8110 (50%) cases), the sensitivity ranged from 56.3% to 100%, and specificity ranged from 25.4% to 97.4%. The pooled sensitivity of chest CT was 87.9% (95% CI 84.6 to 90.6) and the pooled specificity was 80.0% (95% CI 74.9 to 84.3). There was no statistical evidence indicating that reference standard conduct and definition for index test positivity were sources of heterogeneity for CT studies. Nine chest CT studies (2807 participants, 1139 (41%) cases) used the COVID-19 Reporting and Data System (CO-RADS) scoring system, which has five thresholds to define index test positivity. At a CO-RADS threshold of 5 (7 studies), the sensitivity ranged from 41.5% to 77.9% and the pooled sensitivity was 67.0% (95% CI 56.4 to 76.2); the specificity ranged from 83.5% to 96.2%; and the pooled specificity was 91.3% (95% CI 87.6 to 94.0). At a CO-RADS threshold of 4 (7 studies), the sensitivity ranged from 56.3% to 92.9% and the pooled sensitivity was 83.5% (95% CI 74.4 to 89.7); the specificity ranged from 77.2% to 90.4% and the pooled specificity was 83.6% (95% CI 80.5 to 86.4). For chest X-ray (9 studies, 3694 participants, 2111 (57%) cases) the sensitivity ranged from 51.9% to 94.4% and specificity ranged from 40.4% to 88.9%. The pooled sensitivity of chest X-ray was 80.6% (95% CI 69.1 to 88.6) and the pooled specificity was 71.5% (95% CI 59.8 to 80.8). For ultrasound of the lungs (5 studies, 446 participants, 211 (47%) cases) the sensitivity ranged from 68.2% to 96.8% and specificity ranged from 21.3% to 78.9%. The pooled sensitivity of ultrasound was 86.4% (95% CI 72.7 to 93.9) and the pooled specificity was 54.6% (95% CI 35.3 to 72.6). Based on an indirect comparison using all included studies, chest CT had a higher specificity than ultrasound. For indirect comparisons of chest CT and chest X-ray, or chest X-ray and ultrasound, the data did not show differences in specificity or sensitivity. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that chest CT is sensitive and moderately specific for the diagnosis of COVID-19. Chest X-ray is moderately sensitive and moderately specific for the diagnosis of COVID-19. Ultrasound is sensitive but not specific for the diagnosis of COVID-19. Thus, chest CT and ultrasound may have more utility for excluding COVID-19 than for differentiating SARS-CoV-2 infection from other causes of respiratory illness. Future diagnostic accuracy studies should pre-define positive imaging findings, include direct comparisons of the various modalities of interest in the same participant population, and implement improved reporting practices.","Islam, Nayaar; Ebrahimzadeh, Sanam; Salameh, Jean-Paul; Kazi, Sakib; Fabiano, Nicholas; Treanor, Lee; Absi, Marissa; Hallgrimson, Zachary; Leeflang, Mariska Mg; Hooft, Lotty; van der Pol, Christian B; Prager, Ross; Hare, Samanjit S; Dennie, Carole; Spijker, René; Deeks, Jonathan J; Dinnes, Jacqueline; Jenniskens, Kevin; Korevaar, Daniël A; Cohen, Jérémie F; Van den Bruel, Ann; Takwoingi, Yemisi; van de Wijgert, Janneke; Damen, Johanna Aag; Wang, Junfeng; McInnes, Matthew Df",Cochrane Database Syst Rev,551,1

We first assessed anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G levels with an immunoassay, followed by confirmatory testing of borderline and positive test results with a recombinant spike-based immunofluorescence assay and a plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). Those with a borderline or positive immunoassay result were retested after 4 to 5 months. At baseline, 4771 persons participated (88% response rate). Between April 24th and June 30th, 2020, seroprevalence was 0.97% (95% CI: 0.72-1.30) by immunoassay and 0.36% (95% CI: 0.21-0.61) when considering only those with two additional positive confirmatory tests. Importantly, about 20% of PRNT+ individuals lost their neutralizing antibodies within five months. Here, we show that neutralizing antibodies are detectable in only one third of those with a positive immunoassay result, and wane relatively quickly.","Aziz, N Ahmad; Corman, Victor M; Echterhoff, Antje K C; Müller, Marcel A; Richter, Anja; Schmandke, Antonio; Schmidt, Marie Luisa; Schmidt, Thomas H; de Vries, Folgerdiena M; Drosten, Christian; Breteler, Monique M B",Nat Commun,551,30

Methods: This cross-national survey was conducted between April 1 and October 15, 2020 and utilized a self-administered questionnaire to collect data (Typeform TM) from people living with hemophilia in Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia and Slovenia. The questionnaire included 22 questions regarding difficulties in daily life and preferences for receiving hemophilia-related information. Respondents were stratified into two main groups, people with hemophilia (PwH) or their caregivers (CPwH). Results were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Results: Of the 364 respondents, 232 were PwH (63.7%) and 132 were CPwH (36.3%). In total, 70.3% of hemophilia patients/caregivers responded that they are kept sufficiently informed about life with hemophilia, with 68.0%, 59.1% and 56.3% of respondents obtaining information from their physicians, patient associations and via digital media (internet and social media), respectively. However, 97.8% of respondents expressed an interest in additional information, particularly new hemophilia treatment options (62.1%), which in contrast to other topics was indicated most frequently by both patients and caregivers in all six countries. Most frequent difficulties in everyday life with hemophilia were identified as mobility problems (41.8%), unexpected bleeding (38.5%), pain (35.4%), and uncertainty with what they can or cannot do (25.0%). During the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, 52.5% of respondents reported that they did not experience any major change in daily living with hemophilia. Conclusion: Based on our Central European survey, hemophilia mostly affects peoples' lives by causing mobility difficulties, unexpected bleeding, pain and uncertainty in daily activities. Although the majority of respondents reported being educated about hemophilia, most PwH and CPwH respondents sought additional information, highlighting the need for continuous personalized patient education to cope with present challenges.","Banchev, A.; Batorova, A.; Faganel Kotnik, B.; Kiss, C.; Puras, G.; Zapotocka, E.; Zupancic-Salek, S.; Patient Advocacy, Group",Patient preference &amp; adherence,551,24

OBJECTIVE: To unravel the most challenging aspects of COVID-19 in a nonclinical adult population and identify predictors of lost balance and consequent allostatic overload (AO). We examined the role of regular, moderate-intensity formula aerobic exercise (312 meridian exercise) in preventing allostatic overload through increasing well-being. METHODS: An online survey was conducted to measure CO-VID-related allostatic overload according to clinimetric criteria. The Psychosocial Index (PSI), Kellner's Symptom Questionnaire (KSQ), short Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21), Public Health Surveillance Well-Being Scale -(PHS-WB), and Whiteley-7 were used to explore mental health characteristics. Univariate statistics logistic regression analysis and a general linear model were used. RESULTS: According to 442 valid answers, 217 adults practiced physical exercise (PE) frequently (fPE, 3-5 times/every day) while 120 did it less regularly (1-2 times/week), and 105 did not exercise/practiced irregularly (controls). Restriction-related stressors were most challenging, resulting in AO in 29% (n = 128) of the sample. The main predictors were additional stressors (p = 0.005) and anxiety symptoms (p < 0.001). The prevalence of AO was lower (p = 0.018) in the fPE group when compared to controls. KSQ distress symptoms were also lower in fPE (p < 0.0001), while total well-being was increased (p < 0.001) after adjusting for sex, age, and number of chronic diseases. According to the PHS-WB, both physical and mental well-being were higher (p = 0.003 and p = 0.004, respectively) in fPE. CONCLUSIONS: Frequent moderate exercise is associated with better mental and physical well-being and a lower prevalence of AO.","Eöry, Ajandek; Békési, Dora; Eöry, Ajandok; Rózsa, Sandor",Psychother Psychosom,551,1

METHODS: Using prospective method, the 43 cases of confirmed COVID-19 patients in Nanning Fourth People's Hospital from January 22nd to February 15th in 2020 were enrolled and divided into routine treatment group (n = 25) and artesunate treatment group (n = 18) by odd-even rule after admission. According to the guidelines, the routine treatment group was recommended to receive lopinavir/ritonavir 500 mg + &#945;-aerosolized interferon 500×104 U, twice daily; the artesunate treatment group was given artesunate 60 mg, twice daily besides the routine treatment, for 10 days in both groups. During the treatment period, the pharynx swab test of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) nucleic acid was carried out every 2 days, and the routine blood test, liver and kidney functions, blood coagulation function and myocardial enzymes were re-examined. Chest CT was checked every 3 days after the treatment, and re-examined every 5 days after the condition was improved. The routine blood test and biochemical results of two groups were observed, and the efficacy evaluation was performed by monitoring the time for significant improvement of symptoms, negative conversion time of throat swab virus nucleic acid, lung lesion absorption time, adverse drug reactions and the length of hospital stay of the two groups. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of gender, age, body weight, routine blood test and biochemical results before treatment. In artesunate treatment group, the time for significant improvement of symptoms (days: 3.33±1.91 vs. 4.84±2.19), negative conversion time of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid (days: 4.72±2.16 vs. 6.68±3.76), lung lesion absorption starting time (days: 5.39±2.36 vs. 7.48±3.78), lung lesion absorption greater than 70% time (days: 14.11±4.16 vs. 17.04±4.42) and the length of hospital stay (days: 16.56±3.71 vs. 18.04±3.97) were significantly shorter than those in routine treatment group, with significant differences (all P < 0.05). The incidence of adverse drug reactions in two groups had no significant difference (72.2% vs. 80.0%, P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Artesunate can shorten the treatment time of COVID-19, improve prognosis and eliminate pathogens, with fewer adverse reactions and a good application prospect.","Lin, Yanrong; Wu, Fengyao; Xie, Zhouhua; Song, Xiaoling; Zhu, Qingdong; Wei, Jing; Tan, Shiji; Liang, Lianshao; Gong, Beibei",Zhonghua Wei Zhong Bing Ji Jiu Yi Xue,551,6

DESIGN: Responses to HCAHPS surveys were used in a partial correlation analysis to ascertain those HCAHPS composite measures that most relate to overall hospital ratings. The linear mean scores for the composite measures and individual and global items were analyzed with descriptive analysis and correlation analysis via JMP and SPSS statistical software. SETTING: HCAHPS is a patient satisfaction survey required by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) for hospitals in the United States. The Survey is for adult inpatients, excluding psychiatric patients. PARTICIPANTS: 3,382 US hospitals. INTERVENTION: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Pearson correlation coefficients for the six composite measures and overall hospital rating. RESULTS: The partial correlations for overall hospital rating and three composite measures are positive and moderately strong for care transition (0.445) and nurse communication (0.369) and weak for doctor communication (0.066). CONCLUSIONS: From a health policy standpoint, it is imperative that hospital administrators stress open and clear communication between providers and patients to avoid problems ranging from misdiagnosis to incorrect treatment. Additional research is needed to determine how COVID-19 pandemic influences patients' perceptions of quality and willingness to recommend hospitals at a time when nurses and physicians show symptoms of burnout due to heavy workloads and inadequate PPEs.","Belasen, Alan T; Hertelendy, Attila J; Belasen, Ariel R; Oppenlander, Jane",Int. j. qual. health care,551,16

In this interim, the accessibility to the Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) may mitigate the pandemic impact in some countries and the BCG vaccine offers significant advantages and flexibility in the way clinical vaccines are administered. BCG vaccination is a highly cost-effective intervention against tuberculosis (TB) and many low-and lower-middle-income countries would likely have the infrastructure, and health care personnel sufficiently familiar with the conventional TB vaccine to mount full-scale efforts to administer novel BCG-based vaccine for COVID-19. This suggests the potential for BCG to overcome future barriers to vaccine roll-out in the countries where health systems are fragile and where the effects of this new coronavirus could be catastrophic. Many studies have reported cross-protective effects of the BCG vaccine toward non-tuberculosis related diseases. Mechanistically, this cross-protective effect of the BCG vaccine can be explained, in part, by trained immunity, a recently discovered program of innate immune memory, which is characterized by non-permanent epigenetic reprogramming of macrophages that leads to increased inflammatory cytokine production and consequently potent immune responses. In this review, we summarize recent work highlighting the potential use of BCG for the treatment respiratory infectious diseases and ongoing SARS-CoV-2 clinical trials. In situations where no other specific prophylactic tools are available, the BCG vaccine could be used as a potential adjuvant, to decrease sickness of SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or to mitigate the effects of concurrent respiratory infections.","Gonzalez-Perez, Maria; Sanchez-Tarjuelo, Rodrigo; Shor, Boris; Nistal-Villan, Estanislao; Ochando, Jordi",Front Immunol,551,13

DESIGN: Observational study with retrospective analysis. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 2272 patients from the Singapore National Eye Centre (SNEC) whose visits were rescheduled over lockdown (April 13-June 1, 2020) were offered participation in a self-monitoring initiative administered by SNEC with the Alleye application (Switzerland) as the testing instrument. METHODS: This was an observational study with retrospective analysis. Demographics and characteristics were compared between those who signed up and those who did not. Similar comparisons were made between patients who complied with the initiative versus those who did not. Outcomes were tracked for 6 months starting from the commencement of lockdown. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Participation and compliance rates and characteristics of patients who were more likely to participate and comply with the initiative. RESULTS: Seven hundred thirty-two patients (32%) participated in this self-monitoring initiative. Those who participated were younger (62 years of age vs. 68 years of age; P < 0.001), men, and living with family. Patients not receiving treatment and those with poorer vision in the worse-seeing eye were more likely to participate. When grouped according to diagnosis, the proportion who participated was highest for diabetic macular edema (52%), nonneovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD; 42%), diabetic retinopathy (35%), retinal vein occlusions (18%), and neovascular AMD (15%; P < 0.001). Testing compliance rate was 43% (315/732). Patients who complied with the initiative were older, were receiving treatment, and had poorer vision in the worse-seeing eye. Trigger events occurred in 33 patients, with 5 patients having clinically verified disease progression (1.6%). CONCLUSIONS: We provide clinical data on characteristics of patients with stable retinal diseases who were offered, participated in, and complied with a self-monitoring program. The lower participation rate compared with standardized clinical studies reflects the difficulties in implementation for such initiatives in clinical settings. Despite this, self-monitoring continues to show promise in relieving clinic resources, suggesting the feasibility of scaling such programs beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.","Teo, Kelvin Yi Chong; Bachmann, Lucas M; Sim, Dawn; Lee, Shu Yen; Tan, Anna; Wong, Tien Y; Cheung, Chui Ming Gemmy; Wei Tan, Gavin Siew",,551,16
271271,271271,271271,"Prior COVID-19 significantly reduces the risk of subsequent infection, but reinfections are seen after eight months",16.409101,5.484911,2021,"BACKGROUND: As many countries fear and even experience the emergence of a second wave of COVID-19, reminding health care workers (HCWs) and other hospital employees of the critical role they play in preventing SARS-CoV-2 transmission is more important than ever. Building and strengthening the intrinsic motivation of HCWs to apply infection prevention and control (IPC) guidelines to avoid contaminating their colleagues, patients, friends, and relatives is a goal that must be energetically pursued. A high rate of nosocomial infections during the first COVID-19 wave was detected by IPC specialists and further cemented their belief in the need for an engaging intervention that could improve compliance with COVID-19 safe behaviors. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to develop a serious game that would promote IPC practices with a specific focus on COVID-19 among HCWs and other hospital employees. METHODS: The first 3 stages of the SERES framework were used to develop this serious game. A brainswarming session between developers and IPC specialists was used to identify the target audience and acquisition objectives. Nicholson's RECIPE mnemonic (reflection, engagement, choice, information, play, exposition) for meaningful gamification was used to guide the general design. A common and simple terminology was used to suit the broad target audience. The game was tested on various platforms (smartphones, tablets, laptops, desktop computers) by different users during each development loop and before its final release. RESULTS: The game was designed to target all hospital staff who could be in direct contact with patients within the Geneva University Hospitals. In total, 10 acquisition objectives were defined by IPC specialists and implemented into the game according to the principles of meaningful gamification. A simple storyboard was first created using Microsoft PowerPoint and was progressively refined through multiple iteration loops. Articulate Storyline was then used to create two successive versions of the actual game. In the final version, a unique graphic atmosphere was created with help from a professional graphic designer. Feedback mechanisms were used extensively throughout the game to strengthen key IPC messages.

The objectives of this study were to identify clinical, laboratory and imaging parameters that could differentiate between influenza and COVID-19 and to assess the frequency and impact of early bacterial co-infection. A prospective observational cohort study was performed between February 2019 and April 2020. A retrospective cohort was studied early in the COVID-19 pandemic. Patients suspected of sepsis with PCR-confirmed influenza or SARS-CoV-2 were included. A multivariable logistic regression model was built to differentiate COVID-19 from influenza. In total, 103 patients tested positive for influenza and 110 patients for SARS-CoV-2, respectively. Hypertension (OR 6.550), both unilateral (OR 4.764) and bilateral (OR 7.916), chest X-ray abnormalities, lower temperature (OR 0.535), lower absolute leukocyte count (OR 0.857), lower AST levels (OR 0.946), higher LDH (OR 1.008), higher ALT (OR 1.044) and higher ferritin (OR 1.001) were predictive of COVID-19. Early bacterial co-infection was more frequent in patients with influenza (10.7% vs. 2.7%). Empiric antibiotic usage was high (76.7% vs. 84.5%). Several factors determined at presentation to the hospital can differentiate between influenza and COVID-19. In the future, this could help in triage, diagnosis and early management.

However, the precise fate of a liquid droplet expelled from a respiratory puff as dictated by its surroundings and the puff itself has not yet been fully quantified. From the view of airborne disease transmission, such as SARS-CoV-2, knowledge of such dependencies are critical. Here we employ direct numerical simulations (DNS) of a turbulent respiratory vapour puff and account for the mass and temperature exchange with respiratory droplets and aerosols. In particular, we investigate how droplets respond to different ambient temperatures and relative humidity (RH) by tracking their Lagrangian statistics. We reveal and quantify that in cold and humid environments, as there the respiratory puff is supersaturated, expelled droplets can first experience significant growth, and only later followed by shrinkage, in contrast to the monotonic shrinkage of droplets as expected from the classical view by William F. Wells (1934). Indeed, cold and humid environments diminish the ability of air to hold water vapour, thus causing the respiratory vapour puff to super-saturate. Consequently, the super-saturated vapour field drives the growth of droplets that are caught and transported within the humid puff. To analytically predict the likelihood for droplet growth, we propose a model for the axial RH based on the assumption of a quasi-stationary jet. Our model correctly predicts super-saturated RH conditions and is in good quantitative agreement with our DNS. Our results culminate in a temperature-RH map that can be employed as an indicator for droplet growth or shrinkage.","Ng, Chong Shen; Chong, Kai Leong; Yang, Rui; Li, Mogeng; Verzicco, Roberto; Lohse, Detlef",,551,23

Despite its primary effect on the respiratory system, the virus does not solely impact those with underlying lung conditions as initially predicted. Indeed, prognosis is worsened (often fatal) in patients with pre-existing hyperinflammatory responses (e.g., hypertension, obesity and diabetes), yet the mechanisms by which this occurs are unknown. A number of psychological conditions are associated with inflammation, suggesting that these may also be significant risk factors for negative outcomes of COVID-19. In this review, we evaluate preclinical and clinical literature suggesting that chronic stress-induced hyperinflammation interacts synergistically with COVID-19-related inflammation, contributing to a potentially fatal cytokine storm syndrome. In particular, we hypothesize that both chronic stress and COVID-19-related hyperinflammation are a product of glucocorticoid insufficiency. We discuss the devastating effects of SARS-CoV-2 on structural and functional aspects of the biological stress response and how these induce exaggerated inflammatory responses, particularly interleukin (IL)-6 hypersecretion. We postulate that chronic stress should be considered a significant risk factor for adverse COVID-19-related health outcomes, given overlapping peripheral and central immune dysregulation in both conditions. We conclude by discussing how people with a history of chronic stress could mitigate their risk for COVID-19 complications, identifying specific strategies that can be implemented during self-isolation.","Lamontagne, Steven J; Pizzagalli, Diego A; Olmstead, Mary C",Stress health (Online),551,9

Both exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses are used in a step-wise manner for scale development. Reliability and validity are evaluated. A nomological model is theorized and tested to evaluate nomological validity. For the first time, our study frames SCV as a novel and distinct construct. The findings show that SCV is a hierarchical and multidimensional construct, reflected in organizational structures, organizational resources, dynamic design capabilities, and operational aspects. The findings reveal that a central characteristic of SCV is the dynamic reconfiguration of SC structures in an adaptive manner to ensure survival in the long-term perspective.

VVAM permits detailed visualisation of the location and quantity of vacancy, including Greyspace, a form of hitherto undetectable vacancy. To test VVAM, this paper reports its application to a population of office buildings (n=118) in Adelaide, an Australian city reporting high office building vacancy. VVAM revealed the vacancy distribution did not lend itself to whole building adaptive reuse, despite the universal advocacy for greater adaptive reuse globally. This finding implies whole building adaptive reuse may not be appropriate to address vacancy in all cities.

However, GBSs in the setting of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) remains poorly characterized, whilst GBSs prevalence amongst COVID-19 patients has not been previously systematically evaluated using a meta-analytical approach. METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis of observational cohort and case series studies reporting on the occurrence, clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with COVID-19-associated GBSs was performed. A random-effects model was used to calculate pooled estimates and odds ratios (ORs) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs), compared to non-COVID-19, contemporary or historical GBSs patients. RESULTS: Eighteen eligible studies (11 cohorts, seven case series) were identified including a total of 136,746 COVID-19 patients. Amongst COVID-19 patients, including hospitalized and non-hospitalized cases, the pooled GBSs prevalence was 0.15 (95% CI 0%-0.49; I2 = 96%). Compared with non-infected contemporary or historical controls, patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection had increased odds for demyelinating GBSs subtypes (OR 3.27, 95% CI 1.32%-8.09%; I2 = 0%). In SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, olfactory or concomitant cranial nerve involvement was noted in 41.4% (95% CI 3.5%-60.4%; I2 = 46%) and 42.8% (95% CI 32.8%-53%; I2 = 0%) of the patients, respectively. Clinical outcomes including in-hospital mortality were comparable between COVID-19 GBSs patients and non-infected contemporary or historical GBSs controls. CONCLUSION: GBSs prevalence was estimated at 15 cases per 100,000 SARS-CoV-2 infections.

We aimed to compare COVID-19 seroprevalence among asymptomatic blood donors from healthcare and non-healthcare setting to analyse the difference in exposure level of each group as well as the risk of acquiring infection during the process of blood donation. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Analysis of whole blood donors tested for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies was carried out after categorizing them into healthcare workers (HCW) and non-healthcare workers (NHCW). NHCW were further categorized into residents of containment and non-containment zones and seroprevalence analyzed. Seroprevalence among different ABO blood groups was also analyzed. RESULTS: 1191 blood donors were tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with 9.5 % seropositivity. Significantly lower seropositivity of 3.2 % (p < 0.001) was observed among HCW as compared to 10.9 % seropositivity in NHCW. Among NHCW no difference in seropositivity was observed based on residence in containment or non-containment zone. Significantly higher (p = 0.012) seroprevalence was observed among A blood group donors (12.5 %) as compared to O blood group donors (6.8 %). CONCLUSION: Results suggests that a blood donor, in a hospital setting is less likely to be exposed to COVID-19 disease than when participating in activities of daily living. It is postulated that the lower seroprevalence among HCW as compared to NHCW reflects differences in knowledge and practice of preventive measures among these groups. The findings should instil confidence among blood donors and motivate them to donate blood without fear.","Pandey, Hem Chandra; Dhiman, Yashaswi; C S, Chippy; Coshic, Poonam; Jain, Pankaj",Transfus Apher Sci,551,16

Despite these reports, the mechanism of COVID-19 nervous system injury is not well understood. We report the case of a COVID-19 patient with diffuse microhemorrhages on brain MRI, positive anticardiolipin antibodies, and purpuric rash with biopsy showing a thrombotic vasculopathy, all features suggestive of secondary microangiopathy. CASE REPORT: A 69-year-old male with history of hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and hypothyroidism presented with one week of dyspnea, cough, diarrhea, and fevers. Chest x-ray demonstrated bibasilar consolidations and nasopharyngeal reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. He had subsequent respiratory decline requiring intubation the day after admission. He developed a truncal morbilliform rash and diffuse purpura, a biopsy of which showed small dermal blood vessels with intraluminal microthrombi consistent with thrombotic vasculopathy. He was found to have elevated aCL IgM and IgG and equivocal lupus anticoagulant study. Brain MRI obtained for persistent encephalopathy showed innumerable areas of susceptibility weighted imaging changes throughout the bilateral juxtacortical white matter, corpus callosum, basal ganglia, and brainstem, as well as multiple small areas of FLAIR hyperintensities, consistent with microhemorrhage DISCUSSION: While there have been several reported cases of neurologic manifestations of COVID-19, the pathophysiology may not be related to neurotropism of the virus itself. The new development of antiphospholipid antibodies and thrombotic vasculopathy in dermal blood vessels in this patient suggest a secondary microangiopathy potentially related to a virally-induced inflammatory state.","Shoskes, Aaron; Migdady, Ibrahim; Fernandez, Anthony; Ruggieri, Paul; Rae-Grant, Alexander",J Stroke Cerebrovasc Dis,551,16

In this review, based on current knowledge, we will discuss the likely dental and oral consequences of COVID-19. In this article, we review currently available data associated with vertical transmission of COVID-19 and odontogenesis, oral manifestations, and the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on a diagnosis of oral diseases. Owing to the severity of the pandemic, the population's anxiety and fear of becoming infected with COVID-19 may underestimate the signs and symptoms of serious illnesses, besides discourage patients from seeking health, medical or dental services to determine the diagnosis of oral lesions. Thus, the COVID-19 pandemic could be an additional and aggravating factor for the delay of serious illness diagnosis, such as oral squamous cell carcinoma resulting in higher morbidity and worse prognosis. Several changes and oral lesions have been described as oral manifestations of COVID-19, such as dysgeusia, oral ulcers, petechiae, reddish macules, desquamative gingivitis, among others. Besides, it can cause major systemic changes and predispose opportunistic infections. As with other viral infections, oral manifestations, including dental anomalies, can occur as a direct result of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, further studies are needed to guide and clarify possible oral changes.","Maciel, Panmella Pereira; Júnior, Hercílio Martelli; Martelli, Daniella Reis Barbosa; Machado, Renato Assis; de Andrade, Priscila Victor; Perez, Danyel Elias da Cruz; Bonan, Paulo Rogério Ferreti",Pesqui.

To date, however, the effectiveness of teaching ear anatomy using 3-D holographic technology has not been studied. The present study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of learning ear anatomy using a holographic (HG) anatomic model in comparison to didactic lecture (DL) and a computer module (CM). METHODS: A 3-D anatomic model of the middle and inner ear was created and displayed using presentation slides in a lecture, computer module, or via the Microsoft HoloLens. Twenty-nine medical students were randomized to one of the three interventions. All participants underwent assessment of baseline knowledge of ear anatomy. Immediately following each intervention, testing was repeated along with completion of a satisfaction survey. RESULTS: Baseline test scores did not differ across intervention groups. All groups showed an improvement in anatomic knowledge post-intervention (p < 0.001); the improvement was equal across all interventions (p = 0.06). Participants rated the interventions equally for delivery of factual content (p = 0.96), but rated the HG higher than the DL and CM for overall effectiveness, ability to convey spatial relationships, and for learner engagement and motivation (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that 3-D holographic technology is an effective method of teaching ear anatomy as compared to DLs and CMs. Furthermore, it is better at engaging and motivating learners compared to traditional methods, meriting its inclusion as a tool in undergraduate medical education curriculum.","Gnanasegaram, Joshua J; Leung, Regina; Beyea, Jason A",J Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,551,32

Après un suivi médian de 6 mois [3-9], 2 épisodes infectieux sévères ont été observés (une pneumopathie non documentée et une pneumopathie COVID19). En excluant les patients ayant reçu des immunoglobulines intraveineuses avant le dosage, une hypogammaglobulinémie (gammaglobulines &lt; 6 g/L) était observée chez 5/6 patients. La concentration médiane de gammaglobulines étaient de 7,1 g/L [4,8-16,2] avant traitement, contre 4,2 g/L [3,5-7,6] à 3 mois, et 6,1 g/L [6-15,5] à 9 mois. Parmi les 5 patients avec un PTI réfractaire (plaquettes médiane 11 G/L [0-21]), une RC a été observée chez 2 patients, après respectivement 3 et 4 perfusions de daratumumab. Un autre patient initialement non-répondeur après 4 injections et corticodépendant a pu maintenir une RC sans autre traitement après une augmentation transitoire de la corticothérapie suivie d'un sevrage, suggérant une réponse retardée. Concernant les patients avec AHAI, une patiente avait une RC durant 9 mois après 4 perfusions, tandis que l'autre était en échec du traitement avec toutefois un espacement des transfusions après 3 mois de traitement. Le daratumumab n'avait pas d'efficacité clinique chez la patiente avec un syndrome de Glanzmann acquis, mais en revanche on notait une disparition des anticorps anti-β2GP1 et de l'anticoagulant circulant chez le patient avec un SAPL. Ces premières données observationnelles suggèrent que le daratumumab pourrait être efficace chez certains patients avec une cytopénie autoimmune réfractaire et en situation d'impasse thérapeutique avec les traitements habituels. La tolérance clinique semble acceptable dans ces situations thérapeutiques complexes, vec cependant un risque d'hypogammaglobulinémie profonde, qui doit être pris en compte dans l'évaluation du rapport bénéfices/risques. Des essais prospectifs sont nécessaires pour confirmer ces données préliminaires.

The decision whether or not to get vaccinated has so far been left to the individual citizens. However, there are good reasons, both in theory as well as in practice, to believe that the willingness to get vaccinated might not be sufficiently high to achieve herd immunity. A policy of mandatory vaccination could ensure high levels of vaccination coverage, but its legitimacy is doubtful. We investigate the willingness to get vaccinated and the reasons for an acceptance (or rejection) of a policy of mandatory vaccination against COVID-19 in June and July 2020 in Germany based on a representative real time survey, a random sub-sample (SOEP-CoV) of the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP). Our results show that about 70 percent of adults in Germany would voluntarily get vaccinated against the coronavirus if a vaccine without side effects was available. About half of residents of Germany are in favor, and half against, a policy of mandatory vaccination. The approval rate for mandatory vaccination is significantly higher among those who would get vaccinated voluntarily (around 60 percent) than among those who would not get vaccinated voluntarily (27 percent). The individual willingness to get vaccinated and acceptance of a policy of mandatory vaccination correlates systematically with socio-demographic and psychological characteristics of the respondents. We conclude that as far as people's declared intentions are concerned, herd immunity could be reached without a policy of mandatory vaccination, but that such a policy might be found acceptable too, were it to become necessary.","Graeber, Daniel; Schmidt-Petri, Christoph; Schröder, Carsten",PLoS One,551,1

Given prior quality concerns about antibiotic management for children during telemedicine visits outside of primary care, we sought to examine acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI) visit volume and antibiotic management for children via telemedicine integrated within pediatric primary care. METHODS: Using electronic health record data from 47 practices within a large pediatric primary care network, we identified visits for ARTI from April to September 2020. For these visits, we categorized antibiotic management consistent with clinical guidelines as guideline concordant. We compared telemedicine and in-person visit guideline-concordant antibiotic management, diagnoses, and antibiotic prescribing using chi-square tests and examined trends over time using descriptive statistics. Antibiotic stewardship during the study period included learning collaborative videoconferences and sharing of clinic and clinician-level metrics through an interactive dashboard. RESULTS: During the 6-month period, 8332 ARTI visits were identified, with 3003 (36%) via telemedicine. Guideline-concordant antibiotic management occurred in 92.5% of telemedicine visits compared to 90.7% of in-person office visits (P = .004). Telemedicine ARTI visits receiving diagnoses of acute otitis media or streptococcal pharyngitis declined from peak of 52% (May) to 7% (September). Guideline-concordant antibiotic management of sinusitis and viral ARTI during telemedicine visits increased from 88% (April) to 97% (September). CONCLUSION: With active antibiotic stewardship, pediatricians practicing within certified medical homes consistently delivered highly guideline-concordant care for ARTIs to their patient population via telemedicine integrated into primary care.","Ray, Kristin N; Martin, Judith M; Wolfson, David; Schweiberger, Kelsey; Schoemer, Pam; Cepullio, Christine; Iagnemma, Jennifer; Hoberman, Alejandro",,551,7

The aim was to determine the maximum daily number of COVID-19 cases requiring intensive care from 11 April through 30 June 2020. METHODS: We assumed three non-exponential scenarios for the development of the cumulative case numbers up to 30 June 2020 (linear, slow quadratic, and fast quadratic). We assumed that 3-10% of of patients would require intensive care, that 8 days would elapse from a positive test to the need for intensive care, and that intensive care would be necessary for 14 or 20 days. RESULTS: Extrapolation of the maximum registered daily COVID-19 cases reveals a range of 4133 to 12 233 cases. Assuming that 3-10% of newly detected COVID-19 cases become intensive care patients and the average length of ICU stay is between 14 and 20 days, we arrive at a maximum daily number of ICU cases between 1989 (linear extrapolation, 3% ICU, 14 days in ICU) and 20 966 (fast quadratic extrapolation, 10% ICU, 20 days in ICU). CONCLUSION: Our results give no rise for concern that triage of COVID-19 patients may become necessary in Germany. However, the occupancy of ICU beds should be managed centrally to ensure optimal use of bed capacity. If, contrary to expectations, an exponential increase in case numbers should occur after all, our results will become invalid.","Stang, Andreas; Stang, Maximilian; Jöckel, Karl-Heinz",Dtsch Arztebl Int,551,1

With supportive care as the current mainstay of treatment, the fatality rate of COVID-19 is 6.9%. There are currently several trials assessing the efficacy of different antivirals as treatment. Of these, chloroquine (CQ) and its derivative hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have garnered the most attention. METHODS: In this study, the literature currently available on CQ and HCQ as treatment of COVID-19 was surveyed using EMBASE, PubMed, Cochrane Library, MedRxiv, and one clinical trial registry. Upon gathering published and preprint trials, risk of bias was assessed using Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool 2.0. RESULTS: There are currently seven completed clinical trials and 29 registered clinical trials focusing on HCQ or CQ as a therapeutic avenue for COVID-19. Of these, five of seven trials have shown favorable outcomes for patients using CQ or HCQ and two of seven have shown no change compared to control. However, all seven trials carried varying degrees of bias and poor study design. CONCLUSION: There are currently not enough data available to support the routine use of HCQ and CQ as therapies for COVID-19. Pending further results from more extensive studies with more stringent study parameters, clinicians should defer from routine use of HCQ and CQ. There are several clinical trials currently under way with results expected soon.","Chowdhury, Md Sadakat; Rathod, Jay; Gernsheimer, Joel",Acad Emerg Med,551,16

A significant problem with this virus is its high transmission power. Asymptomatic patients can transmit the virus. The aim of this review is to examine orthodontic emergencies and the necessary strategies and measures for emergency and nonemergency treatment during the coronavirus pandemic. METHODS: The following databases were comprehensively searched: PubMed, MEDLINE, Scopus, and Google Scholar. Up-to-date data released by major health organizations such as the World Health Organization and major orthodontic associations involved in the pandemic were also evaluated. RESULTS: Few studies were conducted on managing orthodontic offices or clinics during the pandemic, and most are not of high quality. Appropriate communication is the most important issue in managing orthodontic patients, particularly virtual counseling. Many orthodontic emergencies can be managed in this way by patients themselves. Most studies recommend using the filtering facepiece 2 masks, equivalent to N95 masks for non-COVID-19 patients undergoing aerosol-generating procedures and all suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients in orthodontic visits. CONCLUSIONS: At this time, there are no definitive clinical protocols supported by robust evidence for orthodontic practice during the COVID-19 pandemic. Orthodontists should not rush to return to routine orthodontic work and should follow state guidelines. Nonemergency orthodontic visits should be suspended during the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic in high-risk areas. Resuming orthodontic procedures during the pandemic requires paying special attention to screening, performing maximum efforts to reduce aerosol generation, using appropriate personal protective equipment, having proper ventilation, and fully adhering to sterilization and disinfection principles.","Malekshoar, Milad; Malekshoar, Mehrdad; Javanshir, Bahareh",Am J Orthod Dentofacial Orthop,551,16

One of the current questions in the field of environmental science is to explain how air pollution can affect the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on public health. The research here focuses on a case study of Italy. Results suggest that the diffusion of COVID-19 in cities with high levels of air pollution is generating higher numbers of COVID-19 related infected individuals and deaths. In particular, results reveal that the number of infected people was higher in cities with more than 100 days per year exceeding limits set for PM10 or ozone, cities located in hinterland zones (i.e. away from the coast), cities having a low average speed of wind and cities with a lower average temperature. In hinterland cities having a high level of air pollution, coupled with low wind speed, the average number of infected people in April 2020-during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic-is more than tripled compared to cities with low levels of air pollution. In addition, results show that more than 75% of infected individuals and about 81% of deaths of the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic in Italy are in industrialized regions with high levels of air pollution. Although these vital results of the first wave of the COVID-19 from February to August 2020, policymakers have had a low organizational capacity to plan effective policy responses for crisis management to cope with COVID-19 pandemic that is generating recurring waves with again negative effects, déjà vu, on public health and of course economic systems.","Coccia, Mario",,551,16

In this paper, we solved a time delay fractional COVID-19 SEIR epidemic model via Caputo fractional derivatives using a predictor-corrector method. We provided numerical simulations to show the nature of the diseases for different classes. We derived existence of unique global solutions to the given time delay fractional differential equations (DFDEs) under a mild Lipschitz condition using properties of a weighted norm, Mittag-Leffler functions and the Banach fixed point theorem. For the graphical simulations, we used real numerical data based on a case study of Wuhan, China, to show the nature of the projected model with respect to time variable. We performed various plots for different values of time delay and fractional order. We observed that the proposed scheme is highly emphatic and easy to implementation for the system of DFDEs.","Kumar, Pushpendra; Suat Erturk, Vedat",,551,15

The highest nonprimary attack rates (14.8%) were observed from a subsequent religious gathering in Brunei and in households of attendees (10.6%). Household attack rates from symptomatic case-patients were higher (14.4%) than from asymptomatic (4.4%) or presymptomatic (6.1%) case-patients. Workplace and social settings had attack rates of <1%. Our analyses highlight that transmission of SARS-CoV-2 varies depending on environmental, behavioral, and host factors. We identify red flags for potential superspreading events, specifically densely populated gatherings with prolonged exposure in enclosed settings, persons with recent travel history to areas with active SARS-CoV-2 infections, and group behaviors.

Previous studies have observed highly variable alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels in patients with COVID-19. However, circulating levels of the cholangiocyte injury biomarker Î³-glutamyltransferase (GGT) have yet to be reported in the existing COVID-19 case studies. Herein, we describe the relationship between GGT levels and clinical and biochemical characteristics of patients with COVID-19. Our study is a retrospective case series of 98 consecutive hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 at Wenzhou Central Hospital in Wenzhou, China, from January 17 to February 5, 2020. Clinical data were collected using a standardized case report form. Diagnosis of COVID-19 was assessed by symptomatology, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and computed tomography (CT) scan. The medical records of patients were analyzed by the research team. Of the 98 patients evaluated, elevated GGT levels were observed in 32.7%; increased C-reactive protein (CRP) and elevated ALT and AST levels were observed in 22.5%, 13.3%, and 20.4%, respectively; and elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and triglycerides (TGs) were found in 2% and 21.4%, respectively. Initially, in the 82 patients without chronic liver disease and alcohol history; age older than 40 years (P = 0.027); male gender (P = 0.0145); elevated CRP (P = 0.0366), ALT (P < 0.0001), and ALP (P = 0.0003); and increased TGs (P = 0.0002) were found to be associated with elevated GGT levels. Elevated GGT (P = 0.0086) and CRP (P = 0.0162) levels have a longer length of hospital stay. Conclusion: A sizable number of patients with COVID-19 infection had elevated serum GGT levels.

Two mental health measures (depression and anxiety) were regressed on social network variables relevant to the Covid-19 crisis (frequency of face-to-face contact and frequency of contact through electronic means), controlling for confounders. Interactions of age group and social networks were considered. Baseline mental health was controlled, focusing the analysis on post-outbreak mental health change. RESULTS: Face-to-face network contact significantly reduced negative mental health changes while electronic contact significantly increased them. The age interactions were insignificant. Country differences were observed. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that face-to-face social networks can moderate the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on important aspects of mental health.","Litwin, Howard; Levinsky, Michal",Aging Ment Health,551,24

Recently, van der Waals-layered materials have shown appealing properties for use in efficient SOT applications. On the one hand, transition-metal dichalcogenides, topological insulators, and graphene-based heterostructures possess appreciable SOC strength. This feature can efficiently converse the charge current into spin current and result in large SOT. On the other hand, the newly discovered layered magnetic materials provide ultra-thin and gate-tunable ferromagnetic candidates for high-performance SOT devices. In this review, the latest advancements of SOT research in various layered materials are summarized. First, a brief introduction of SOT is given.

The first and most draconian interventions have been implemented in Wuhan, China, and these countermeasures have been increasingly deployed by countries around the world. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine risk factors, including the use of social media, for probable anxiety and depression in the community and among health professionals in the epicenter, Wuhan, China. METHODS: We conducted an online survey via WeChat, the most widely used social media platform in China, which was administered to 1577 community-based adults and 214 health professionals in Wuhan. Probable anxiety and probable depression were assessed by the validated Generalized Anxiety Disorder-2 (cutoff &#8805;3) and Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (cutoff &#8805;3), respectively. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to examine factors associated with probable anxiety and probable depression. RESULTS: Of the 1577 community-based adults, about one-fifth of respondents reported probable anxiety (n=376, 23.84%, 95% CI 21.8-26.0) and probable depression (n=303, 19.21%, 95% CI 17.3-21.2). Similarly, of the 214 health professionals, about one-fifth of surveyed health professionals reported probable anxiety (n=47, 22.0%, 95% CI 16.6-28.1) or probable depression (n=41, 19.2%, 95% CI 14.1-25.1). Around one-third of community-based adults and health professionals spent &#8805;2 hours daily on COVID-19 news via social media. Close contact with individuals with COVID-19 and spending &#8805;2 hours daily on COVID-19 news via social media were associated with probable anxiety and depression in community-based adults. Social support was associated with less probable anxiety and depression in both health professionals and community-based adults. CONCLUSIONS: The internet could be harnessed for telemedicine and restoring daily routines, yet caution is warranted toward spending excessive time searching for COVID-19 news on social media given the infodemic and emotional contagion through online social networks. Online platforms may be used to monitor the toll of the pandemic on mental health.","Ni, Michael Y; Yang, Lin; Leung, Candi M C; Li, Na; Yao, Xiaoxin I; Wang, Yishan; Leung, Gabriel M; Cowling, Benjamin J; Liao, Qiuyan",JMIR Ment Health,551,1

Although well characterized in mammals, little documentation exists about the receptor in salmonid fishes. Here, we report the sequence and expression analysis of eight DC-SIGN-like genes in Salmo salar. Each receptor displays structural similarities to DC-SIGN molecules described in mammals, including internalization motifs, a neck region with heptad repeats, and a Ca+2-dependent carbohydrate recognition domain. The receptors are expressed in multiple tissues of fish, and fish cell lines, with differential expression upon infection with viral and bacterial pathogens. The identification of DC-SIGN-like receptors in Salmo salar provides new information regarding the structure of the immune system of salmon, potential markers for cell subsets, as well as insights into DC-SIGN conservation across species.","Ojeda, Nicolás; Salazar, Carolina; Cárdenas, Constanza; Marshall, Sergio H",Dev Comp Immunol,551,32

METHOD: This study was conducted between August and October 2020, we performed COVID-19 testing by RT-PCR on the samples from varying prevalence of rural population (non-hot spot) referred to COVID laboratory, in the first step, the samples were collated into pools of 5 or 10. These pools were tested by RT-PCR. Negative pools were reported as negative whereas positive pools of 5 and 10 were then de-convoluted and each sample was tested individually. RESULTS: In the present study, we tested 1580 samples in 158 pools of 10 and 17,515 samples in 3503 pools of 5. Among 10 samples pool, 11 (13%) pools flagged positive in the first step. In the second step, among 11 pools (110 samples) de-convoluted strategy was followed in which 10 individual samples came positive. Among 5 samples pool, 164 (13%) pools flagged positive in the first step. In the second step, among 164 pools (820 samples) de-convoluted strategy was followed in which 171 individual samples came positive. The pooled sample testing strategy saves substantial resources and time during surge testing and enhanced pandemic surveillance. This approach requires around 76%-93% fewer tests in low to moderate prevalence settings and group sizes up to 5-10 in a population, compared to individual testing. CONCLUSION: Pooled sample RT- PCR analysis strategies can save substantial resources and time for COVID-19 mass testing in comparison with individual testing without compromising the quality of outcome of the test. In particular, the pooled sample approach can facilitate mass screening in the early asymptomatic stages of COVID-19 infections.","Shukla, Surabhi; Upadhyay, Vandana; Maurya, Vinod Kumar",Indian j. med. microbiol,551,1

Materials and Methods: The expression levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in tumors and control samples were obtained from online databases. Survival prognosis and biological functions of these genes were investigated for each tumor type. Results: There was the overexpression of ACE2 in colon and stomach adenocarcinomas compared to controls, meanwhile colon and prostate adenocarcinomas showed a significantly higher expression of TMPRSS2. Additionally, survival prognosis analysis has demonstrated that upregulation of ACE2 in liver hepatocellular carcinoma was associated with higher overall survival (hazard ratio=0.65, p=0.016) and disease-free survival (hazard ratio=0.66, p=0.007), while overexpression of TMPRSS2 was associated with a 26% reduced risk of death in lung adenocarcinoma (p=0.047) but 50% increased risk of death in breast invasive carcinoma (p=0.015).

All the selected compounds were subjected to standard-precision (SP) and extra-precision (XP) mode of docking. Generated docked poses were carefully visualized for known interactions within the binding site. Molecular mechanics-generalized born surface area (MM-GBSA) calculations were performed to screen the best compounds based on docking scores and binding energy values. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were carried out on four selected compounds from the CHEMBL database to validate the stability and interactions. MD simulations were also performed on the PDB structure 6YF2F to understand the differences between screened molecules and co-crystallized ligand. We screened 300 potential compounds from various databases, and 66 potential compounds from FDA approved drugs. Cobicistat, ritonavir, lopinavir, and darunavir are in the top screened molecules from FDA approved drugs. The screened drugs and molecules may be helpful in fighting with SARS-CoV-2 after further studies.","Pant, Suyash; Singh, Meenakshi; Ravichandiran, V; Murty, U S N; Srivastava, Hemant Kumar",J Biomol Struct Dyn,551,1

MATERIAL AND METHOD: Recommendations based on the consensus conference model. RESULTS: In the case of a COVID-19 positive patient, surgical management should be postponed for at least 15 days. For cervical cancer, the place of surgery must be re-evaluated in relation to radiotherapy and Radio-Chemotherapy-Concomitant and the value of lymph node staging surgeries must be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. For advanced ovarian cancers, neo-adjuvant chemotherapy should be favored even if primary cytoreduction surgery could be envisaged. It is lawful not to offer hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy during a COVID-19 pandemic. In the case of patients who must undergo interval surgery, it is possible to continue the chemotherapy and to offer surgery after 6 cycles of chemotherapy. For early stage endometrial cancer, in case of low and intermediate preoperative ESMO risk, hysterectomy with bilateral annexectomy associated with a sentinel lymph node procedure should be favored. It is possible to consider postponing surgery for 1 to 2 months in low-risk endometrial cancers (FIGO Ia stage on MRI and grade 1-2 endometrioid cancer on endometrial biopsy). For high ESMO risk, it ispossible to favor the MSKCC algorithm (combining PET-CT and sentinel lymph node biopsy) in order to omit pelvic and lumbar-aortic lymphadenectomies. CONCLUSION: During COVID-19 pandemic, patients suffering from cancer should not lose life chance, while limiting the risks associated with the virus.","Akladios, C; Azais, H; Ballester, M; Bendifallah, S; Bolze, P-A; Bourdel, N; Bricou, A; Canlorbe, G; Carcopino, X; Chauvet, P; Collinet, P; Coutant, C; Dabi, Y; Dion, L; Gauthier, T; Graesslin, O; Huchon, C; Koskas, M; Kridelka, F; Lavoue, V; Lecointre, L; Mezzadri, M; Mimoun, C; Ouldamer, L; Raimond, E; Touboul, C",Gynecol Obstet Fertil Senol,551,20

Food systems are complex entities that affect diets, human health, and a range of other outcomes including economic growth, natural resource and environmental resiliency, and sociocultural factors. However, food systems contribute to and are vulnerable to ongoing climate and environmental changes that threaten their sustainability. Although there has been increased focus on this topic in recent years, many gaps in our knowledge persist on the relation between environmental factors, food systems, and nutritional outcomes. In this article, we summarize this emerging field and describe what innovative nutrition research is needed in order to bring about food policy changes in the era of climate disruption and environmental degradation.","Fanzo, Jessica; Bellows, Alexandra L; Spiker, Marie L; Thorne-Lyman, Andrew L; Bloem, Martin W",Am. j. clin. nutr,551,20

Medical data contains sensitive patient-related information and is therefore usually anonymized by removing patient identifiers, e.g., patient names before publication. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to show that a well-trained deep learning system is able to recover the patient identity from chest X-ray data. We demonstrate this using the publicly available large-scale ChestX-ray14 dataset, a collection of 112,120 frontal-view chest X-ray images from 30,805 unique patients. Our verification system is able to identify whether two frontal chest X-ray images are from the same person with an AUC of 0.9940 and a classification accuracy of 95.55%. We further highlight that the proposed system is able to reveal the same person even ten and more years after the initial scan. When pursuing a retrieval approach, we observe an mAP@R of 0.9748 and a precision@1 of 0.9963. Furthermore, we achieve an AUC of up to 0.9870 and a precision@1 of up to 0.9444 when evaluating our trained networks on CheXpert and the COVID-19 Image Data Collection. Based on this high identification rate, a potential attacker may leak patient-related information and additionally cross-reference images to obtain more information. Thus, there is a great risk of sensitive content falling into unauthorized hands or being disseminated against the will of the concerned patients. Especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, numerous chest X-ray datasets have been published to advance research. Therefore, such data may be vulnerable to potential attacks by deep learning-based re-identification algorithms.","Packhauser, Kai; Gundel, Sebastian; Munster, Nicolas; Syben, Christopher; Christlein, Vincent; Maier, Andreas",,551,1

Although early in the COVID-19 pandemic, several commentators called for a similar approach in resolving trade-offs between economic activity and reducing the burden of COVID-19, this has not occurred. The value of a QALY has not been used to deny all intervention, as the rule of rescue attests. Further, while there was no other way of managing the pandemic, there were other means available to mitigate the economic losses. Now that vaccine programs have commenced in several countries, it is interesting to consider whether economic evaluation should now be applied. However, the recognised complexities of the evaluation of vaccines, plus the challenge of measuring opportunity costs in the face of an economic recession and the severity of the consequences of an outbreak even though the probability of transmission is exceedingly low, mean its use will be restricted. COVID-19 has changed everything, even the way we should think about economic evaluation.","Hall, Jane; Viney, Rosalie",Aust Health Rev,551,16

Whilst a number of recent reports suggest that COVID-19 associated stroke tends to be severe, there is limited data on the effects of COVID-19 in prospective registries. MATERIAL AND METHODS: To determine how COVID-19 infection may affect cerebrovascular disease, we evaluated the ischemic stroke sub-types, clinical course and outcomes prior to and during the pandemic in Qatar. The Hamad General Hospital (HGH) stroke database was interrogated for stroke admissions during the last 4 months of 2019 and January-May 2020. RESULTS: In Qatar the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 increased from only 2 in February to 779 in March, 12,628 in April and 45,501 in May. Stroke admissions to HGH declined marginally from an average of 97/month for six pre-COVID months to 72/month in March-May. There were 32 strokes that were positive for COVID-19. When compared to non-COVID-19 stroke during the three months of the pandemic, COVID-19 patients were younger with significantly lower rates of hypertension, diabetes and dyslipidemia. COVID-19 positive patients had more cortical strokes (34.4% vs 5.6%; p = 0.001), severe disease (NIHSS >10: 34.4% vs 16.7%; p = 0.001) prolonged hospitalization and fewer with good recovery (mRS 0-2: 28.1% vs 51.9%; p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: When compared to six pre-COVID-19 months, the number of ischemic stroke admissions during the three months of the pandemic declined marginally. COVID-19 positive patients were more likely to have a large cortical stroke with severe symptoms and poor outcome.","Akhtar, Naveed; Abid, Fatma Ben; Kamran, Saadat; Singh, Rajvir; Imam, Yahia; AlJerdi, Salman; AlMaslamani, Muna; Shuaib, Ashfaq",J Stroke Cerebrovasc Dis,551,1

In routine circumstances, ICU triage is premised on the best interests of an individual patient; however, when increased demand exceeds capacity, as during an infectious disease outbreak, healthcare providers need to make difficult decisions to benefit the broader community while still respecting individual interests. We are currently living through an unprecedented period, with South Africa (SA) facing the challenges of the global COVID-19 pandemic. The Critical Care Society of Southern Africa (CCSSA) expedited the development of a triage guidance document to inform the appropriate and fair use of scarce ICU resources during this pandemic. Triage decision-making is based on the clinical odds of a positive ICU outcome, balanced against the risk of mortality and longer-term morbidity affecting quality of life. Factors such as age and comorbid conditions are considered for their potential impact on clinical outcome, but are never the sole criteria for denying ICU-level care. Arbitrary, unfair discrimination is never condoned. The CCSSA COVID-19 triage guideline is aligned with SA law and international ethical standards, and upholds respect for all persons. The Bill of Rights, however, does not mandate the level of care enshrined in the constitutional right to healthcare. ICU admission is not always appropriate, available or feasible for every person suffering critical illness or injury; however, everyone has the right to receive appropriate healthcare at another level. If ICU resources are used for people who do not stand to benefit, this effectively denies others access to potentially life-saving healthcare. Appropriate triaging can therefore be considered a constitutional imperative.","Morrow, B M; Gopalan, P D; Joubert, I; Paruk, F; Pope, A",S Afr Med J,551,12

Preferred due to their lower salaries, greater docility and the evasion of administrative and social security obligations, migrant workers are often treated less favourably than domestic workers in terms of employment rights, benefits and access to adequate housing. The agricultural sector of employment is particularly at risk of labour exploitation during harvest seasons and thus associated with atypical or informal forms of employment and precarious working conditions. The COVID-19 pandemic gave visibility to the new risks the seasonal workers are exposed to. In addition, it showed that in some cases such problems can lead to the further spreading of infectious diseases and increase the risk of COVID-19 clusters. The consequences of of the pandemic can be observed in Croatia too. This paper primarily covers the position of third-country nationals who enter and reside in Croatia for the purpose of agricultural seasonal work within the framework of the Seasonal Workers Directive (Directive 2014/36/EU). Significant challenges facing the Croatian labour market have been addressed by means of a comparative approach in order to present the current situation on the EU labour market and suggest potential legal solutions applicable in regard to the national circumstances.","Kotulovski, K.; Laleta, S.",Eu 2021 - the Future of the Eu in and after the Pandemic,551,26

Some people may turn to alcohol to cope with stress during the pandemic, which may put them at risk for heavy drinking and alcohol-related harms. Research is needed to identify factors that are relevant for coping-motivated drinking during these extraordinary circumstances to inform interventions. This study provides an empirical examination of coping motive pathways to alcohol problems during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Participants (N = 320; 54.7% male; mean age of 32 years) were Canadian adult drinkers who completed an online survey assessing work- and home-related factors, psychological factors, and alcohol-related outcomes over the past 30 days, covering a time period beginning within 1 month of the initiation of the COVID-19 emergency response. RESULTS: The results of a theory-informed path model showed that having at least 1 child under the age of 18, greater depression, and lower social connectedness each predicted unique variance in past 30-day coping motives, which in turn predicted increased past 30-day alcohol use (controlling for pre-COVID-19 alcohol use reported retrospectively). Income loss was associated with increased alcohol use, and living alone was associated with increased solitary drinking (controlling for pre-COVID-19 levels), but these associations were not mediated by coping motives. Increased alcohol use, increased solitary drinking, and greater coping motives for drinking were all independently associated with past 30-day alcohol problems, and indirect paths to alcohol problems from having children at home, depression, social connectedness, income loss, and living alone were all supported. CONCLUSIONS: Findings provide insight into coping-motivated drinking early in the COVID-19 pandemic and highlight the need for longitudinal research to establish longer term outcomes of drinking to cope during the pandemic.","Wardell, Jeffrey D; Kempe, Tyler; Rapinda, Karli K; Single, Alanna; Bilevicius, Elena; Frohlich, Jona R; Hendershot, Christian S; Keough, Matthew T",Alcohol. clin. exp. res,551,16

In an environment where visiting bans are applied to care partners/advocates, hospitals need to ensure care partners can continue to provide decision-making support. Health-care professionals can proactively engage care partners using videoconferencing technologies.

However, attaining the combination of high sensitivity and multiplexity with a short assay turnaround poses a formidable technological challenge. Here, the authors develop a rapid, accurate, and highly multiplexed microfluidic digital immunoassay by incorporating machine learning-based autonomous image analysis. The assay has achieved 12-plexed biomarker detection in sample volume <15 µL at concentrations < 5 pg/mL while only requiring a 5-min assay incubation, allowing for all processes from sampling to result to be completed within 40 min. The assay procedure applies both a spatial-spectral microfluidic encoding scheme and an image data analysis algorithm based on machine learning with a convolutional neural network (CNN) for pre-equilibrated single-molecule protein digital counting. This unique approach remarkably reduces errors facing the high-capacity multiplexing of digital immunoassay at low protein concentrations.

Given the higher probability of thrombotic complications related to COVID-19 and the availability of a dual-layer spectral computed tomography (CT) scanner, we have recently adopted the use of low-dose, non-gated, chest CT scans performed five minutes after contrast administration among patients admitted with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) undergoing cerebrovascular CT angiography. Dual-layer spectral CT comprises a single X-ray source and two-layer detector with different photon-absorption capabilities. In addition to conventional images, the two distinct energy datasets obtained enable multiparametric spectral analysis without need to change the original scanning protocol. The two spectral features that emerge as most useful for patients with AIS are virtual monoenergetic imaging and iodine-based results. Aside from the evaluation of lung parenchyma, this novel strategy enables ruling out cardioembolic sources and simultaneously providing evidence of pulmonary and myocardial injury in a single session and immediately after CT cerebrovascular angiography. Furthermore, it involves a noninvasive, seemingly accurate, unsophisticated, safer (very low radiation dose and no contrast administration), and cheaper tool for ruling out cardioembolic sources compared to transesophageal echocardiogram and cardiac CT. Accordingly, we sought to standardize the technical aspects and overview the usefulness of delayed-phase, lowdose chest spectral CT in patients admitted with AIS.","Rodriguez-Granillo, Gaston A; Cirio, Juan J; Ciardi, Celina; Caballero, Maria L; Diluca, Pablo; Castrillon, Ricardo; Ceron, Marcos; Scrivano, Esteban; Lylyk, Pedro",,551,3

The reports indicate the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to affect almost any organ due to the presence of a receptor known as angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) across the body. ACE2 receptor is majorly expressed in the brush border of gut enterocytes along with the ciliated cells and alveolar epithelial type II cells in the lungs. The amino acid transport function of ACE2 has been linked to gut microbial ecology in gastrointestinal (GI) tract, thereby suggesting that COVID-19 may, to some level, be linked to the enteric microbiota. The significant number of COVID-19 patients shows extra-pulmonary symptoms in the GI tract. Many subsequent studies revealed viral RNA of SARS-CoV-2 in fecal samples of COVID-19 patients. This presents a new challenge in the diagnosis and control of COVID-19 infection with a caution for proper sanitation and hygiene.

A new segmentation method, which integrates a three-dimensional (3D) V-Net with a shape deformation module implemented using a spatial transform network (STN), was proposed to segment pulmonary parenchyma in chest CT images. The 3D V-Net was adopted to perform an end-to-end lung extraction while the deformation module was utilized to restrict the V-Net output according to the prior shape knowledge. The proposed segmentation method was validated against the manual annotation generated by experienced operators. The radiomic features measured from our segmentation results were further analyzed by sophisticated statistical models with high interpretability to discover significant independent features and detect COVID-19 infection. Experimental results demonstrated that compared with the manual annotation, the proposed segmentation method achieved a Dice similarity coefficient of 0.9796, a sensitivity of 0.9840, a specificity of 0.9954, and a mean surface distance error of 0.0318 mm. Furthermore, our COVID-19 classification model achieved an area under curve (AUC) of 0.9470, a sensitivity of 0.9500, and a specificity of 0.9270 when discriminating lung infection with COVID-19 from community-acquired pneumonia and healthy controls using statistically significant radiomic features. The significant features measured from our segmentation results agreed well with those from the manual annotation.

La couverture médiatique omniprésente de la pandémie nous empêche souvent de prendre du recul. Les représentations schématiques, l’humour et les métaphores utilisées dans la bande dessinée pourraient faciliter la compréhension d’informations complexes et ainsi peut-être nous aider à favoriser l’attention du grand public. La bande dessinée est également accessible à un public plus large que les médias habituels, notamment grâce à leur diffusion sur les médias sociaux. Dans le domaine des pandecomics, la collaboration entre professionnels de santé et artistes (scénaristes et illustrateurs) revêt une importance particulière, et elle est ici illustrée par trois projets de bande dessinée menés pendant la pandémie de COVID-19. Matériels et méthodes « Faire Face » est un projet collaboratif entre des professionnels de santé hospitaliers et l’association TheInkLink, un réseau engagé de professionnels de la bande dessinée et du développement, travaillant souvent avec l’OMS. À partir de 22 témoignages de professionnels travaillant en CHU, 11 auteurs ont créé 10 histoires fictives qui racontent avec humour et gravité les initiatives des professionnels de santé pendant la pandémie. Ces témoignages ont donné naissance à un livre financé par le mécénat du CHU et une campagne de financement participatif. Résultats « Coronaaah, c’est quoi ? » est une bande dessinée de vulgarisation scientifique sur le COVID-19, créée par une médecin infectiologue et une autrice de bande dessinée, et soutenue par le Collège santé d’une université française. Le format de la bande dessinée a permis d’expliquer des informations scientifiques complexes de manière amusante au grand public. « Coco-le-virus » est une bande dessinée pour enfants, créée par Marguerite et Paul de Livron pour aider les familles et les professionnels de l’enfance pendant la pandémie, en abordant avec humour et tendresse plusieurs thèmes autour du COVID-19.

The mechanism for SARS-CoV-2 infection is the requisite binding of the virus to the membrane-bound form of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and internalization of the complex by the host cell. Recognition that ACE2 is the coreceptor for the coronavirus has prompted new therapeutic approaches to block the enzyme or reduce its expression to prevent the cellular entry and SARS-CoV-2 infection in tissues that express ACE2 including lung, heart, kidney, brain, and gut. ACE2, however, is a key enzymatic component of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS); ACE2 degrades ANG II, a peptide with multiple actions that promote CVD, and generates Ang-(1-7), which antagonizes the effects of ANG II. Moreover, experimental evidence suggests that RAAS blockade by ACE inhibitors, ANG II type 1 receptor antagonists, and mineralocorticoid antagonists, as well as statins, enhance ACE2 which, in part, contributes to the benefit of these regimens. In lieu of the fact that many older patients with hypertension or other CVDs are routinely treated with RAAS blockers and statins, new clinical concerns have developed regarding whether these patients are at greater risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection, whether RAAS and statin therapy should be discontinued, and the potential consequences of RAAS blockade to COVID-19-related pathologies such as acute and chronic respiratory disease. The current perspective critically examines the evidence for ACE2 regulation by RAAS blockade and statins, the cardiovascular benefits of ACE2, and whether ACE2 blockade is a viable approach to attenuate COVID-19.","South, Andrew M; Diz, Debra I; Chappell, Mark C",Am J Physiol Heart Circ Physiol,551,9

Further, it affects the financial and natural resource market simultaneously, as both are considered complementary goods. The volatility in the oil prices deteriorates the global financial market to substantiate the ""financial resource (oil) curse"" hypothesis primarily filled with earlier studies. In contrast, this study moved forward and extended the given relationship during the COVID-19 pandemic in a panel of 81 different countries. The study's main objective is to examine the volatility in the domestic credit provided to the private sector due to oil shocks and the COVID-19 pandemic across countries. The study is essential to assess the healthcare vulnerability in the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to the damage of financial stability, causing deterioration in the oil rents to affect the global sustainability agenda. The study employed statistical techniques to get sound inferences of the parameter estimates, including robust least squares regression, seemingly unrelated regression, and innovation accounting matrix to get a variable estimate at the level and inter-temporal framework. The results confirmed the U-shaped relationship between oil rents and financial development during the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, it verifies the ""financial resource (oil) curse"" hypothesis at the initial stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. Later down, it supports the capital market when economies are resuming their economic activities and maintaining the SOPs to restrain coronavirus at a global scale. The qualitative assessment confirmed the negative effect of financial development and oil shocks on environmental quality during the pandemic crisis. The innovation accounting matrix shows that the COVID-19 pandemic will primarily be the main factor that intervenes in the relationship between oil rents and financial development, which proceed towards the ""resource curse"" hypothesis during the following years' time period.

Here we use mice lacking the WD and linker domains of ATG16L1 to demonstrate that ATG16L1-dependent targeting of LC3 to single-membrane, non-autophagosome compartments - referred to as non-canonical autophagy - protects mice from lethal IAV infection. Mice with systemic loss of non-canonical autophagy are exquisitely sensitive to low-pathogenicity IAV where extensive viral replication throughout the lungs, coupled with cytokine amplification mediated by plasmacytoid dendritic cells, leads to fulminant pneumonia, lung inflammation and high mortality. IAV was controlled within epithelial barriers where non-canonical autophagy reduced IAV fusion with endosomes and activation of interferon signalling. Conditional mouse models and ex vivo analysis showed that protection against IAV infection of lung was independent of phagocytes and other leucocytes. This establishes non-canonical autophagy in airway epithelial cells as a novel innate defence that restricts IAV infection and lethal inflammation at respiratory surfaces.","Wang, Yingxue; Sharma, Parul; Jefferson, Matthew; Zhang, Weijiao; Bone, Ben; Kipar, Anja; Bitto, David; Coombes, Janine L; Pearson, Timothy; Man, Angela; Zhekova, Alex; Bao, Yongping; Tripp, Ralph A; Carding, Simon R; Yamauchi, Yohei; Mayer, Ulrike; Powell, Penny P; Stewart, James P; Wileman, Thomas",EMBO J,551,16

METHODS: This study applied a mathematical model to estimate the increase in the number of cases in São Paulo state, Brazil during four epidemic periods and the subsequent 300 days. We used different types of dynamic transmission models to measure the effects of social distancing interventions, based on local contact patterns. Specifically, we used a model that incorporated multiple transmission pathways and an environmental class that represented the pathogen concentration in the environmental reservoir and also considered the time that an individual may sustain a latent infection before becoming actively infectious. Thus, this model allowed us to show how the individual quarantine and active monitoring of contacts can influence the model parameters and change the rate of exposure of susceptible individuals to those who are infected. RESULTS: The estimated basic reproductive number, R o , was 3.59 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.48 - 3.72). The mathematical model data prediction coincided with the real data mainly when the social distancing measures were respected. However, a lack of social distancing measures caused a significant increase in the number of infected individuals. Thus, if social distancing measures are not respected, we estimated a difference of at least 100,000 cases over the next 300 days. CONCLUSIONS: Although the predictive capacity of this model was limited by the accuracy of the available data, our results showed that social distancing is currently the best non-pharmacological measure.","Cruz, Pedro Alexandre da; Crema-Cruz, Leandra Cristina; Campos, Fabrício Souza",Rev Soc Bras Med Trop,551,8

Fourteen patients received darunavir-cobicistat treatment, and 96 received other antiviral therapy (controls). Overall, the darunavir-cobicistat group comprised patients with milder illness, and the crude mortality rate of all patients in the darunavir-cobicistat group was lower than that in the controls [odds ratio (OR) 0.20, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.04-0.89, p=0.035]. After 1:2 propensity-score matching, there were 14 patients in the darunavir-cobicistat group, and 28 patients in the controls.

The unequal distribution of COVID-19 confirmed cases suggests that this is the case. Yet, evidence on the causal effect of the epidemic on mortality inequalities remains scarce. In this paper, we exploit exhaustive municipality-level data in France, one of the most severely hit country in the world, to identify a negative relationship between income and excess mortality within urban areas, that persists over COVID-19 waves. Over the year 2020, the poorest municipalities experienced a 30% higher increase in excess mortality. Our analyses can rule out an independent contribution of lockdown policies to this heterogeneous impact. Finally, we find evidence that both labour-market exposure and housing conditions are major determinants of the epidemic-induced effects of COVID-19 on mortality inequalities, but that their respective role depends on the state of the epidemic.","Brandily, Paul Brébion Clément Briole Simon Khoury Laura",European economic review,551,16

A total of 183 COVID-19 patients were recruited in Shenzhen Third People's Hospital from January 11 to February 16, 2020. According to the clinical classification criteria, they were divided into severe group (46 cases) and non-severe (137cases). T lymphocyte counts, lymphocyte subpopulation, IL-6 levels, and clinical outcomes were compared between the two groups. Compared with the non-severe group, the lymphocyte count, T lymphocyte count, T lymphocyte percentage, CD4+ T lymphocyte count, CD4+ T lymphocyte percentage, CD8+ T lymphocyte count, and CD8+ T lymphocyte percentage were lower in the severe group (p &lt; 0.05). Compared with the non-severe group, IL-6 were higher in the severe group (p &lt; 0.05). Compared with admission, the T lymphocyte count, CD4+ T lymphocyte count, and CD8+ T lymphocyte count were significantly increased upon discharge in severe patients, non-severe patients and all patients. Multivariate Logsitic regression analysis showed CD4+ T lymphocyte count (OR −0.011;95% CI −0.041 to −0.001;p = 0.011), CD8+ T lymphocyte count (OR −0.14;95% CI −0.048 to −0.003;p = 0.013) were closely correlated with the clinical severity in patients of COVID-19. Multivariate Logsitic regression analysis also showed CD4+ T lymphocyte count (OR −0.012;95% CI −3.177 to 0.261;p = 0.021), CD8+ T lymphocyte count (OR −0.019;95% CI −5.852 to 0.115;p = 0.004) were independent predictors of disease progressing to the composite endpoint. Subgroup analysis for critically ill patients: The T lymphocyte count, CD4+ T lymphocyte count, and CD8+ T lymphocyte count remained low in the death patients. The T lymphocyte count, CD4+ T lymphocyte count, and CD8+ T lymphocyte count recovered soon in the discharged patients. In the event of COVID-19 infection, the T-lymphoid system is the primary activated immune system. The T lymphocytes, CD4+ T lymphocytes, CD8+ T lymphocytes continued to be low may be significantly related to the deterioration of the disease, and may indicate a poor prognosis.

METHODS: This was a single-center, retrospective, observational study, carried out in a referral center for COVID-19 in central Italy. We reviewed the clinical records of patients consecutively admitted for confirmed COVID-19 over a 1-month period (1-31 March 2020). We excluded asymptomatic discharged patients. We identified risk factors for death, by a uni- and multivariate Cox regression analysis. To improve model fitting and hazard estimation, continuous parameters where dichotomized by using Youden's index. RESULTS: Overall, 69 patients, aged 80-98 years, met the inclusion criteria and were included in the study cohort. The median age was 84 years (82-89 years is interquartile range); 37 patients (53.6%) were men. Globally, 14 patients (20.3%) presented a mild, 30 (43.5%) a severe and 25 (36.2%) a critical COVID-19 disease. A total of 23 (33.3%) patients had died at 30 days' follow up. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that severe dementia, pO2 &#8804;90 at admission and lactate dehydrogenase >464 U/L were independent risk factors for death. CONCLUSIONS: The present data suggest that risk of death could be not age dependent in patients aged &#8805;80 years, whereas severe dementia emerged is a relevant risk factor in this population. Severe COVID-19, as expressed by elevated lactate dehydrogenase and low oxygen saturation at emergency department admission, is associated with a rapid progression to death in these patients.

Nurses who were likely to volunteer had the following characteristics: younger, unmarried, members of the Communist Party of China, with senior professional qualification, working in critical care departments, with support from their families, with adequate training and learning, with good health status and low levels of anxiety. The regression model could explain 31.1% of the variances of the willingness decision of nurses. CONCLUSIONS: A high proportion of nurses in China were willing to practice in Hubei during the coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic. Adequate training and psychological support would facilitate nurses to volunteer during the outbreak of an infectious disease. IMPACT: The study identified a high proportion of nurses in China were willing to practice in Hubei combating the coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic. The findings will provide valuable references for nurses and decision makers to formulate better plans for increasing nursing workforce during such kind of public health crisis.","Gan, Xiaoqing; Shi, Zeya; Chair, Sek Ying; Cao, Xi; Wang, Qun",J. adv. nurs,551,19

One possible option is the vaccination of autologous inactivated tumor cells. The primary indispensable principles of a cell-based melanoma vaccine include: i) Entire inactivation of melanoma cells; ii) retaining the immunogenicity of melanoma cells; and iii) adherence to laws and ethical guidelines. However, traditional methods for the production of the vaccine, such as ultrasonic, chemotherapeutics and freeze-thawing, have some juridical or therapeutic constraints. Therefore, the present study used high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) to inactivate malignant cells, and treated B16-F10 tumor cells with different pressures (&#8805;50 MPa) and different durations (&#8805;1 min). It was identified that tumor cells in vitro lost their proliferative ability, but retained their immunogenicity following treatment.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A web-based questionnaire was designed to differentiate the impact of the pandemic on inpatient and outpatient nuclear medicine operations and on public versus private health systems, respectively. Questions were addressing the following issues: impact on nuclear medicine diagnostics and therapy, use of recommendations, personal protective equipment, and organizational adaptations. The survey was available for 6 days and closed on April 20, 2020. RESULTS: 113 complete responses were recorded. Nearly all participants (97â%) report a decline of nuclear medicine diagnostic procedures. The mean reduction in the last three weeks for PET/CT, scintigraphies of bone, myocardium, lung thyroid, sentinel lymph-node are -14.4â%, -47.2â%, -47.5â%, -40.7â%, -58.4â%, and -25.2â% respectively. Furthermore, 76â% of the participants report a reduction in therapies especially for benign thyroid disease (-41.8â%) and radiosynoviorthesis (-53.8â%) while tumor therapies remained mainly stable. 48â% of the participants report a shortage of personal protective equipment. CONCLUSIONS: Nuclear medicine services are notably reduced 3 weeks after the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic reached Germany, Austria and Switzerland on a large scale. We must be aware that the current crisis will also have a significant economic impact on the healthcare system. As the survey cannot adapt to daily dynamic changes in priorities, it serves as a first snapshot requiring follow-up studies and comparisons with other countries and regions.","Freudenberg, Lutz S; Dittmer, Ulf; Herrmann, Ken",Nuklearmedizin,551,16

In this study, a greenhouse experiment was conducted to explore the tolerance capacities of B. papyrifera and its phytoremediation potential in the HM-contaminated soil. The results indicated that B. papyrifera could effectively decrease malondialdehyde (MDA) content by enhancing the antioxidant enzyme activities along with the cultivation in the HM-contaminated soil. Significant (p < 0.05) negative relationships were found between MDA content and superoxide dismutase (r = -0.620) and catalase activities (r = -0.702) in B. papyrifera leaves. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy analysis indicated that the main functional groups in B. papyrifera roots were slightly influenced by HMs, and organic acids, carbohydrates, protein, and amino acids might bind with HMs in plant roots to alleviate the adverse effect of HMs on plants growth. Meanwhile, B. papyrifera had great potential used for the phytoextraction of Cd and Zn in HM-contaminated soil. The maximum total Cd and Zn accumulation amount in B. papyrifera shoots could attach to 2.26 and 66.8 mg·pot-1, respectively. These observations suggested that B. papyrifera has large biomass and high tolerance to HMs, which can be regarded as a promising plant for the eco-remediation of HM-contaminated sites.Novelty statement In this study, a fast-growing woody plant, Broussonetia papyrifera, was used for heavy metal(loid) (HM)-contaminated soil remediation.

SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK: Of the 1,137 studies searched, 14 studies performed on 972 COVID-19 patients entered the systematic review final stage. The results showed that different CAM interventions (acupuncture, Traditional Chinese medicine [TCM], relaxation, Qigong) significantly improved various psychological symptoms (depression, anxiety, stress, sleep quality, negative emotions, quality of life) and physical symptoms (inflammatory factors, physical activity, chest pain, and respiratory function) in COVID-19 patients. The results showed that various CAM interventions have a positive effect on improving the various dimensions of coronavirus disease but since there are few studies in this regard, further studies using different CAM approaches are recommended.","Badakhsh, Mahin; Dastras, Majid; Sarchahi, Zohreh; Doostkami, Mahboobe; Mir, Adel; Bouya, Salehoddin",Rev. environ. health,551,16

Inosine pranobex (IP) has been previously demonstrated to be effective in treating acute viral respiratory infections. In three NH experiencing the SARS-CoV-2 virus epidemic, we started treatment with IP as soon as clients tested PCR+. In Litovel, CZ, the difference in case-fatality rate (CFR) for the PCR+ group using vs. not using IP was statistically significant, and the odds ratio (OR) was 7.2. When comparing all those taking IP in the three NH vs. the non-drug PCR+ group in Litovel, the odds ratio was lower for all three NH, but still significant at 2.9. The CFR in all three tested NHs, age range 75-84, compared to the CFR in all NHs in the Czech Republic, was significantly reduced (7.5% vs. 18%) (OR: 2.8); there was also a significant difference across all age groups (OR: 1.7). In our study with 301 residents, the CFR was significantly reduced (OR: 2.8) to 11.9% (17/142) in comparison to a study in Ireland with 27.6% (211/764). We think the effect of IP was significant in this reduction; nevertheless, these are preliminary results that need larger-scale trials on COVID-19 patients.","Beran, Jirí; Spajdel, Marian; Katzerová, Vera; Holousová, Alena; Malys, Jan; Finger Rousková, Jana; Slíva, Jirí",,551,16

Each infection surge leads to increased emergency department (ED) utilization and subsequent critical care admission for patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Not all COVID19 patients necessitate a ventilator and therefore can remain at home to minimize infection spread and manage hospital capacity concerns. Remote Bluetooth-enabled pulse-oximeter monitoring of moderate-to-severely ill COVID19 patients can be used to closely monitor symptoms and trigger necessary visits to the hospital. Our objective was to analyze remote pulse-oximeter monitoring cost-effectiveness to reduce facility burden and health expenditures. Methods: We analyzed home-monitoring with pulse-oximetry cost-utility using a Markov model over a 3-week time horizon in daily cycles from a US health sector perspective. Cost and outcome measures were derived from real-world evidence from University Hospitals. Pulse-oximetry monitoring was implemented for patients presenting at the ED with ARDS-like symptoms but not necessitating immediate care;patients were then remotely monitored by experts for up to 4-days until recovery or a second ED visit. Additional parameters were extracted from literature. Costs (2020 U.S. dollars) and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were used to determine the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) at a $100,000/QALY cost-effectiveness threshold. Model uncertainty was assessed using one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Results: Results demonstrated that pulse-oximetry monitoring dominated current standard care for COVID19 patients based on reduced costs and increased QALYs. Individuals with access to remote pulse-oximetry monitoring averaged $49,176 and 0.03 QALYs, whereas standard care increased costs to $113,792 and 0.02 QALYs. Resulting ICER was not sensitive to uncertainty ranges. Conclusions: Remote pulse-oximetry monitoring of symptomatic COVID19 patients increases the specificity of those requiring immediate follow-up. We recommend adoption of this technology across health systems to cost-effectively manage COVID19 volume surges, maintain patients’ comfort, reduce infection spread, and simultaneously monitor multiple patients.","Crawford, S.; Kelley, M.; Choy, B.; Miano, M.

Fever, cough, myalgia, fatigue associated to dyspnea represent most common clinical symptoms of the disease. The reference standard for diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection is real time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction test applied on respiratory tract specimens. Despite of lower specificity, chest computed tomography (CT), as reported in manifold scientific studies, showed high sensitivity, therefore it may help in the early detection, management and follow-up of COVID-19 pneumonia. Patients affected by COVID-19 pneumonia usually showed on chest CT some typical features, such as: Bilateral ground glass opacities characterized by multilobe involvement with posterior and peripheral distribution; parenchymal consolidations with or without air bronchogram; interlobular septal thickening; crazy paving pattern, represented by interlobular and intralobular septal thickening surrounded by ground-glass opacities; subsegmental pulmonary vessels enlargement (&gt; 3 mm). Halo sign, reversed halo sign, cavitation and pleural or pericardial effusion represent some of atypical findings of COVID-19 pneumonia. On the other hand lymphadenopathy's and bronchiectasis' frequency is unclear, indeed conflicting data emerged in literature. Radiologists play a key role in recognition of high suspicious findings of COVID-19 on chest CT, both typical and atypical ones.

Here, we aimed to assess whether asthma, the most common chronic disease in children, is associated with higher COVID-19 risk or severity in pediatric populations. METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search in three stages: first, we reviewed PubMed, EMBASE, and CINAHL for systematic reviews of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and COVID-19 in pediatric populations, and reviewed their primary articles; second, we searched PubMed for studies on COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2 and asthma/wheeze, and evaluated whether the resulting studies included pediatric populations; third, we repeated the second search in BioRxiv.org and MedRxiv.org to find pre-prints that may have information on pediatric asthma. RESULTS: In the first search, eight systematic reviews were found, of which five were done in pediatric populations; none of the 67 primary studies included data on pediatric asthma as a comorbidity for COVID-19. In the second search, we found 34 results in PubMed, of which five reported asthma in adults, but none included data on children. In the third search, 25 pre-prints in MedRxiv included data on asthma, but none on children. We found one report by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stating that 40/345 (~11.5%) children with data on chronic conditions had ""chronic lung diseases including asthma,"" and one from a tertiary hospital in New York that reported asthma in 11/46 (~23.9%) children hospitalized for COVID-19. CONCLUSION: There is scarcely any data on whether childhood asthma (or other pediatric respiratory diseases) constitute risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19 severity.

Mobile app developers check their users' reviews frequently to clarify the issues experienced by users or capture the new issues that are introduced due to a recent app update. App reviews have a dynamic nature and their discussed topics change over time. The changes in the topics among collected reviews for different versions of an app can reveal important issues about the app update. A main technique in this analysis is using topic modeling algorithms. However, app reviews are short texts and it is challenging to unveil their latent topics over time. Conventional topic models suffer from the sparsity of word co-occurrence patterns while inferring topics for short texts. Furthermore, these algorithms cannot capture topics over numerous consecutive time-slices. Online topic modeling algorithms speed up the inference of topic models for the texts collected in the latest time-slice by saving a fraction of data from the previous time-slice. But these algorithms do not analyze the statistical-data of all the previous time-slices, which can confer contributions to the topic distribution of the current time-slice. We propose Adaptive Online Biterm Topic Model (AOBTM) to model topics in short texts adaptively. AOBTM alleviates the sparsity problem in short-texts and considers the statistical-data for an optimal number of previous time-slices. We also propose parallel algorithms to automatically determine the optimal number of topics and the best number of previous versions that should be considered in topic inference phase. Automatic evaluation on collections of app reviews and real-world short text datasets confirm that AOBTM can find more coherent topics and outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines.","Hadi, Mohammad Abdul; Fard, Fatemeh H",,551,20

Confidence in COVID-19 vaccines produced in China and preference for domestically-made or foreign-made vaccines was also investigated. METHODS: A nationwide cross-sectional, self-administered online survey was conducted on 1-19 May 2020. The health belief model (HBM) was used as a theoretical framework for understanding COVID-19 vaccination intent and WTP. RESULTS: A total of 3,541 complete responses were received. The majority reported a probably yes intent (54.6%), followed by a definite yes intent (28.7%). The perception that vaccination decreases the chances of getting COVID-19 under the perceived benefit construct (OR = 3.14, 95% CI 2.05-4.83) and not being concerned about the efficacy of new COVID-19 vaccines under the perceived barriers construct (OR = 1.65, 95% CI 1.31-2.09) were found to have the highest significant odds of a definite intention to take the COVID-19 vaccine. The median (interquartile range [IQR]) of WTP for COVID-19 vaccine was CNY¥200/US$28 (IQR CNY¥100-500/USD$14-72). The highest marginal WTP for the vaccine was influenced by socio-economic factors. The majority were confident (48.7%) and completely confident (46.1%) in domestically-made COVID-19 vaccine. 64.2% reported a preference for a domestically-made over foreign-made COVID-19 vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: The findings demonstrate the utility of HBM constructs in understanding COVID-19 vaccination intent and WTP.

In February and March 2020, we explored the somatic symptoms and concerns regarding COVID-19 of 399 college and primary school students in Sichuan Province using the Somatic Self-rating Scale (SSS) and a novel questionnaire, respectively. Logistic regression analysis and non-parametric tests were used to analyze the data. The incidence of somatic symptoms among college students was 34.85 (mild, 26.26%; moderate, 8.59%). The incidence of somatic symptoms in primary school students was 2.39% (all mild). Among the entire cohort, concern regarding COVID-19 was positively correlated with the occurrence of somatic symptoms. Somatic symptoms were more likely among college students expressing greater concern regarding the threat to life and health posed by COVID-19, and the efficacy of prevention and control measures.

Digital media liberate memory from the spatial archive, but they also create a connective compulsion and dependency, a disconnect from the present moment and a loss of control over memory. The overwhelming abundance and immediacy of digital data breed a placelessness of the digital traces of ourselves, an algorithmic narrowing of information, knowledge and life. The COVID-19 pandemic has intensified this compulsion to record to such an extent that it may be considered a new memory boom, an obsessive desire to remember. Locative and mobile technology may seem to locate us in space more than ever before, but they do so in ways that are beyond our comprehension: our smartphones know more about our locatedness than we do, ushering in a ‘new grey’ in digital memory. Yet, it is critical to be aware of the variegated geography of connective memory – and of Memory Studies itself. © The Author(s) 2021.","Hoskins, A.; Halstead, H.",Memory Studies,551,16

This review explores what some of these complications are and how they evoke anti-Asian sentiment, introducing the different intentions of facemask usage such as hygiene, religion and criminality, and scrutiny of the uniqueness of the Asian immigrant position. Analyzing the mask-related cases against Asian immigrants in the contemporary US culture, the complex sociopolitical and cultural meanings of facemasks and their transformative functions in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic are explored. The facemask, as a symbol of power and control, re-fortifies itself to become another representation to escalate racial discriminations and violence against Asian immigrant groups. At the same time, it functions as a tool to protect us. Demonstrating these sociocultural complexities, this article asks us to give more attention to the current anti-Asian violence and the hidden struggles that Asian immigrants experience.","Choi, Hee An; Lee, Othelia EunKyoung",J Hum Rights Soc Work,551,26

The prevalence of diabetes patients hospitalized in intensive care units for COVID-19 is two- to threefold higher, and the mortality rate at least double, than that of non-diabetes patients. As the population with diabetes is highly heterogeneous, it is of major interest to determine the risk factors of progression to a more serious life-threatening COVID-19 infection. This brief review discusses the main findings of CORONADO, a prospective observational study in France that specifically addressed this issue as well as related observations from other countries, mainly China and the US. Some prognostic factors beyond old age have been identified: for example, an increased body mass index is a major risk factor for requiring respiratory assistance. Indeed, obesity combines several risk factors, including impaired respiratory mechanics, the presence of other comorbidities and inappropriate inflammatory responses, partly due to ectopic fat deposits. While previous diabetic microvascular (renal) and macrovascular complications also increase risk of death, the quality of past glucose control had no independent influence on hospitalized diabetes patient outcomes, but whether the quality of glucose control might modulate risk of COVID-19 in non-hospitalized diabetes patients is still unknown. In addition, no negative signs regarding the use of RAAS blockers and DPP-4 inhibitors and outcomes of COVID-19 could be identified. Hyperglycaemia at the time of hospital admission is associated with poor outcomes, but it may simply be considered a marker of severity of the infection. Thus, the impact of glucose control during hospitalization on outcomes related to COVID-19, which was not investigated in the CORONADO study, is certainly deserving of specific investigation.","Scheen, A J; Marre, M; Thivolet, C",Diabetes Metab,551,26

SARS-CoV-2 infection was diagnosed by serological and virological tests. Plasma neutralizing responses were assessed against replicative virus and pseudoviral particles. Multiple regression and non-parametric tests were used to analyze dependence of parameters. The magnitude of neutralizing titers significantly increased with disease severity. Hospitalized individuals developed higher titers compared to mild-symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, which together showed titers below the detection limit in 50% of cases. Longitudinal analysis confirmed the strong differences in neutralizing titers between non-hospitalized and hospitalized participants and showed rapid kinetics of appearance of neutralizing antibodies (50% and 80% of maximal activity reached after 11 and 17 days after symptoms onset, respectively) in hospitalized patients. No significant impact of age, gender or treatment on the neutralizing titers was observed in this limited cohort.

Prediction performances not only depend on the structure and features of the model, but also on its parametrization. Official databases are often biased due to lag in reporting of cases, changing testing policy or incompleteness of data. Moreover, model parametrization is time-dependent e.g. due to changing age-structures, new emerging virus variants, non-pharmaceutical interventions and ongoing vaccination programs. To cover these aspects, we develop a principled approach to parametrize SIR-type epidemiologic models of different complexities by embedding the model structure as a hidden layer into a general Input-Output Non-Linear Dynamical System (IO-NLDS). Non-explicitly modelled impacts on the system are imposed as inputs of the system. Observable data are coupled to hidden states of the model by appropriate data models considering possible biases of the data. We estimate model parameters including their time-dependence by a Bayesian knowledge synthesis process considering parameter ranges derived from external studies as prior information. We applied this approach on a SIR-type model and data of Germany and Saxony demonstrating good prediction performances. By our approach, we can estimate and compare for example the relative effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions and can provide scenarios of the future course of the epidemic under specified conditions. Our method of parameter estimation can be translated to other data sets, i.e. other countries and other SIR-type models even for other disease contexts.","Kheifetz, Yuri; Kirsten, Holger; Scholz, Markus",,551,1

The Guidance Supplement is intended to provide aesthetic medicine physicians and their staffs with a practical guide to safety considerations to support clinic preparedness for patients seeking non-surgical aesthetic treatments and procedures following the return-to-work phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, once such activity is permitted by applicable law. Many federal, state and local governmental authorities, public health agencies and professional medical societies have promulgated COVID-19 orders and advisories applicable to health care practitioners. The Guidance Supplement is intended to provide aesthetic physicians and their staffs with an additional set of practical considerations for delivering aesthetic care safely and generally conducting business responsibly in the new world of COVID-19. Aesthetic providers will face new and unique challenges as government stay-at-home orders and related commercial limitations are eased, and the U.S. economy reopens and healthcare systems transition from providing only urgent and other essential treatment to resuming routine care and elective procedures and services. The medical aesthetic specialties will therefore wish to resume practice in order to ensure high quality, expert care is available, and importantly to help promote patients' positive self-image and sense of well-being following a lengthy and stressful period of quarantine. In a number of areas, this Guidance Supplement exceeds traditional aesthetic office safety precautions, recognizing reduced tolerance in an elective treatment environment for any risk associated with COVID-19's highly variable presentation and unpredictable course.

Accordingly, the Guidance Supplement seeks to establish an elevated safety profile for providing patient care while reducing, to the greatest extent reasonably possible, the risk of infectious processes to both patients and providers. While the Guidance Supplement cannot foreclose the risk of infection, nor serve to establish or modify any standards of care, it does offer actionable risk-mitigation considerations for general office comportment and for certain non-surgical procedures typically performed in aesthetic medical settings. It is axiomatic that all such considerations are necessarily subject to the ultimate judgment of each individual healthcare professional based on patient situation, procedure details, office environment, staffing constraints, equipment and testing availability, and local legal status and public health conditions.","Dover, Jeffrey S; Moran, Mary Lynn; Figueroa, Jose F; Furnas, Heather; Vyas, Jatin M; Wiviott, Lory D; Karchmer, Adolf W",,551,21

Our framework condenses these summary statistics into PRSs using various approaches such as linkage disequilibrium pruning/p value thresholding (fixed or data-adaptively optimized thresholds) and penalized, genome-wide effect size weighting. We evaluated the PRSs in two biobanks: the Michigan Genomics Initiative (MGI), a longitudinal biorepository effort at Michigan Medicine, and the population-based UK Biobank (UKB). For each PRS construct, we provide measures on predictive performance and discrimination. Besides PRS evaluation, the Cancer-PRSweb platform features construct downloads and phenome-wide PRS association study results (PRS-PheWAS) for predictive PRSs. We expect this integrated platform to accelerate PRS-related cancer research.","Fritsche, Lars G; Patil, Snehal; Beesley, Lauren J; VandeHaar, Peter; Salvatore, Maxwell; Ma, Ying; Peng, Robert B; Taliun, Daniel; Zhou, Xiang; Mukherjee, Bhramar",Am. j. hum. genet,551,16

The impact of telehealth on patient satisfaction during the current pandemic is yet to be fully understood. Objective: This study aimed to identify patient perspectives and behaviors toward virtual primary care appointments at a telehealth-naïve institution during the COVID-19 pandemic and establish the rate of missed appointments to help guide future implementation of telehealth services. Methods: Patients at a primary and specialty care clinic, seen between March and May 2020, completed a survey analyzing nine commonly used satisfaction metrics. The rate of missed appointments was recorded and compared with analogous cohorts of in-person office visits. Results: The no-show rate of telehealth visits during the COVID-19 pandemic was 7.5% (14/186), lower than both the no-show rate of 36.1% for in-office visits (56/155) (p < 0.0001) and a pre-pandemic in-office no-show rate of 29.8% (129/433) (p < 0.0001). Surveyed patients who experienced telehealth visits (n = 65) had similar satisfaction compared with those surveyed who attended in-office visits (n = 36) in seven of nine metrics. No statistically significant differences were identified in the satisfaction metrics with telehealth visits performed on video (n = 26) versus the phone-only format (n = 38). Patients aged 65 years or over were less likely to have a video component to their virtual visit (1/12, 8.3%) than those under age 65 (25/44, 56.8%) (p = 0.0031).

Among these measures, enhancing the knowledge, positive attitudes, and proper practices of prevention measures about the disease is a basic strategy to control it. However, community compliance to control measures is largely dependent on their knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) towards COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: To assess the current level of KAP towards COVID-19 pandemic and predictors among the rural dwellers in Sidama regional state, Southern Ethiopia; 2020. METHODS: This community-based prospective cross-sectional study was carried out from May 1-30, 2020 on a sample of 1,278 adult populations in Sidama regional state, Southern Ethiopia. A multi-stage sampling technique was used to choice the study participants. The data were collected using a structured interviewer-administered questionnaire. We have entered data using Epi data version 3.1 and all analyses were done using SPSS version 25. KAPs scores of study participants based on their independent variables were compared using Chi-square test, t-test or one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) as required. Bi-variable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to identify factors associated with KAP. The important assumptions of the logistic regression model were checked to be satisfied. Adjusted odds ratios (AOR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated to assess the existence and strength of associations. RESULTS: From a total of 1,214 study participants, the overall attained knowledge, attitude and practice score about COVID-19 were 90%, 82.4% and 65%, respectively. Among these, 43.9%, 37.5%, and 24.4% of the study participants had demonstrated good knowledge, high attitude and proper practice, respectively. The mean knowledge scores were significantly different between sex, categories of marital status, educational levels, main occupation, and the monthly income quintiles of the study participants (p<0.05). Similarly, the mean attitude scores significantly varied across educational levels, main occupations and marital status (p<0.05). Based on multivariable logistic regression analysis, main occupation of the government employees, education level of diploma and above, highest and second highest wealth rank were positively associated with COVID-19 prevention and control practice. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of study participants had showed good knowledge and optimistic attitude toward COVID-19. But, the level of practice lower than that expected to maximize effective control measures. Further public education interventions and community sensitization campaigns are required for rural adult population in the Sidama regional state, Ethiopia.","Yoseph, Amanuel; Tamiso, Alemu; Ejeso, Amanuel",PLoS One,551,24

The neurological symptoms associated with COVID-19 include headache, dizziness, depression, anosmia, encephalitis, stroke, epileptic seizures, and Guillain-Barre syndrome along with many others. The involvement of the CNS may be related with poor prognosis and disease worsening.

We prioritize the 332 human targets of SARS-CoV-2 according to their association with brain-related disease and identified 73 candidate genes. We prioritize these 73 genes according to their spatio-temporal expression in the different regions of brain and also through evolutionary intolerance analysis. The prioritized genes could be considered potential indicators of COVID-19-associated neurological symptoms and thus act as a possible therapeutic target for the prevention and treatment of CNS manifestations associated with COVID-19 patients.","Khatoon, Fatima; Prasad, Kartikay; Kumar, Vijay",J Neurovirol,551,25

We examine the magnitude of the critical parameters that might imply negative net benefits, including the value of statistical life and the discount rate. A key unknown factor is the speed of economic recovery with and without social distancing measures in place.

We examined early and midterm outcomes, the need for reoperation, postoperative residual AV valve regurgitation, and other risk factors after various CAVSD repairs. METHODS: Between 2014 and 2018, we have performed 89 isolated CAVSD repairs. We retrospectively reviewed the patients' medical records. Patients were divided into three groups according to their repair techniques modified one patch repair (MP) (n = 16); two patch repair (TP) (n = 49); and left anterior leaflet augmentation (ALA) technique (n = 24). RESULTS: Eighty patients (89.8%) survived hospital discharge. Early mortality rates were three (18.8%) in the group MP, five (10.2%) in the group TP, and one (4.2%) in the group ALA. Thirteen patients died during the follow-up period. Late mortality rates were three (18.8%) in the group MP, four (16.6%) in the group ALA, and six (12.2%) in the group TP. The mean follow-up time was 35.9 ± 22.97 months (range: 0.3-77 months). The morbidity and mortality results were similar between-group TP and ALA but worse in the MP group. Low body weight (<4 kg) and younger age at surgery (<4 months) were found to be risk factors on mortality by univariate and multivariate analysis. Surgical technic was not found to be an independent risk factor. CONCLUSION: In our series, TP and ALA techniques had satisfactory results in early and midterm periods. Younger age and small bodyweight might increase early mortality and the need for reoperation.","Basgoze, Serdar; Yildiz, Okan; Ozturk, Erkut; Onan, Ismihan Selen",J. card. surg,551,16

We reviewed the impacts of Big Events with relevance to the COVID-19 pandemic on drug-related risk and harms and access to drug treatment and harm reduction services. METHODS: We conducted a rapid review of quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods literature relating to the following Big Events: respiratory infection pandemics, natural disasters, financial crises, and heroin shortages. Included studies reported data on changes to risks, harms, and/or service provisioning for people who use illicit drugs (other than cannabis) in the context of these Big Events. Searches were conducted in PubMed in May 2020, and two reviewers screened studies for inclusion. Peer-reviewed studies published in English or French were included. We used a narrative synthesis approach and mapped risk pathways identified in the literature. RESULTS: No studies reporting on respiratory infection pandemics were identified. Twelve studies reporting on natural disaster outcomes noted marked disruption to drug markets, increased violence and risk of drug-related harm, and significant barriers to service provision caused by infrastructure damage. Five studies of the 2008 global financial crisis indicated increases in the frequency of drug use and associated harms as incomes and service funding declined. Finally, 17 studies of heroin shortages noted increases in heroin price and adulteration, potentiating drug substitutions and risk behaviors, as well as growing demand for drug treatment. CONCLUSION: Current evidence reveals numerous risk pathways and service impacts emanating from Big Events. Risk pathway maps derived from this literature provide groundwork for future research and policy analyses, including in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. In light of the findings, we recommend responding to the pandemic with legislative and financial support for the flexible delivery of harm reduction services, opioid agonist treatment, and mental health care.","Zolopa, Camille; Hoj, Stine; Bruneau, Julie; Meeson, Julie-Soleil; Minoyan, Nanor; Raynault, Marie-France; Makarenko, Iuliia; Larney, Sarah",Int J Drug Policy,551,22

This manuscript aimed to provide brief guidance for respiratory management of COVID-19 patients before, during, and after mechanical ventilation, based on the recent literature and on our direct experience with this population. We identify that chest CT patterns in COVID-19 may be divided into three main phenotypes: 1) multiple, focal, possibly overperfused ground-glass opacities; 2) inhomogeneously distributed atelectasis; and 3) a patchy, ARDS-like pattern. Each phenotype can benefit from different treatments and ventilator settings. Also, peripheral macro- and microemboli are common, and attention should be paid to the risk of pulmonary embolism. We suggest use of personalized mechanical ventilation strategies based on respiratory mechanics and chest CT patterns.

KIM-1 and suPAR levels were significantly higher in COVID-19 patients compared to the control group (p = 0.001 for all). KIM-1 level was higher in severe patients compared to moderate patients (p = 0.001), while suPAR level was lower (p = 0.001).

SuPAR may have a role in defense mechanism and fibrinolysis, and low levels in severe patients may be associated with poor prognosis in the early period.","Kerget, Bugra; Kerget, Ferhan; Aksakal, Alperen; Askin, Seda; Uçar, Elif Yilmazel; Saglam, Leyla",J. med. virol,551,29

Computed tomography (CT) is a significant screening tool for COVID-19 infection, and automated segmentation of lung infection in COVID-19 CT images will greatly assist diagnosis and health care of patients. However, accurate and automatic segmentation of COVID-19 lung infections remains to be challenging. In this paper we propose a dilated dual attention U-Net (D2A U-Net) for COVID-19 lesion segmentation in CT slices based on dilated convolution and a novel dual attention mechanism to address the issues above. We introduce a dilated convolution module in model decoder to achieve large receptive field, which refines decoding process and contributes to segmentation accuracy. Also, we present a dual attention mechanism composed of two attention modules which are inserted to skip connection and model decoder respectively. The dual attention mechanism is utilized to refine feature maps and reduce semantic gap between different levels of the model. The proposed method has been evaluated on open-source dataset and outperforms cutting edges methods in semantic segmentation. Our proposed D2A U-Net with pretrained encoder achieves a Dice score of 0.7298 and recall score of 0.7071. Besides, we also build a simplified D2A U-Net without pretrained encoder to provide a fair comparison with other models trained from scratch, which still outperforms popular U-Net family models with a Dice score of 0.7047 and recall score of 0.6626. Our experiment results have shown that by introducing dilated convolution and dual attention mechanism, the number of false positives is significantly reduced, which improves sensitivity to COVID-19 lesions and subsequently brings significant increase to Dice score.","Zhao, Xiangyu; Zhang, Peng; Song, Fan; Fan, Guangda; Sun, Yangyang; Wang, Yujia; Tian, Zheyuan; Zhang, Luqi; Zhang, Guanglei",,551,32

So far, the evidence regarding the risk factors that predict the outcomes of COVID-19 patients is limited. In this study, we identified several risk factors that are associated with increased mortality in COVID-19 patients. Methods: We performed a retrospective review of electronic medical records of the patients admitted with an initial diagnosis of COVID-19. We extracted several patient variables (including demographics, lab results, and pre-existing conditions) and examined for their association with increased mortality. Results: Of the 487 people included in the study, 340 survived and 147 expired. Significant differences existed in demographics and underlying comorbidities between the two groups. A higher proportion of patients were age 65 and older (87.76% vs 53.24%, p < 0.001), and were predominantly male (63.27% vs 52.94%, p = 0.0351). Multivariate analysis showed five variables to be the predictors for mortality: age &#8805;65 [OR = 3.87, 95% CI (2.01, 7.46), p < 0.001], initial presentation with dyspnea [OR = 1.71, 95% CI (1.03, 2.82), p = 0.037], history of cardiomyopathy [OR = 3.33, 95% CI (1.07, 10.41), p < 0.038], positive initial chest imaging findings [OR = 2.24, CI (1.26, 3.97), p = 0.006], and acute kidney injury (AKI) [OR = 3.33 CI (2.10, 5.28), P < 0.001].

Yet, the stagnant progress in recruiting, retaining, and supporting racial/ethnic minority trainees and faculty at medical training institutions is well documented and reflects unaddressed systemic racism along the academic pipeline. In this article, the authors draw upon their experiences as early-career physicians of color who have led and supported antiracism efforts within their institutions to highlight key barriers to achieving meaningful progress. They describe common pitfalls of diversity and inclusion initiatives and call for an antiracist approach to systems change.

However, the prognosis and long-term outcome remains poor. METHODS AND RESULTS: We investigated 309 patients with ischaemic cardiomyopathy (ICM) and non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy (NICM) (186 ICM, 123 NICM; 271 males; mean age 64.1 ± 12 years; ejection fraction 34 ± 13%) after &#8805;1 VT ablations over a mean follow-up period of 34 ± 28 months.

During follow-up, 132 patients (43%) experienced VT recurrence and 97 (31%) died. Ischaemic cardiomyopathy and NICM patients showed comparable results, regarding procedural endpoints, complications, VT recurrence and survival. The Cox-regression analysis for all-cause mortality revealed that the presence of higher left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDV; P < 0.001), male gender (P = 0.018), atrial fibrillation (AF; P < 0.001), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD; P = 0.001), antiarrhythmic drugs during the follow-up (P < 0.001), polymorphic VTs (P = 0.028), and periprocedural complications (P = 0.001) were independent predictors of mortality. CONCLUSION: Ischaemic cardiomyopathy and NICM patients undergoing VT ablation had comparable results regarding procedural endpoints, complications, VT recurrence and 3-year mortality. Higher LVEDV, male gender, COPD, AF, polymorphic VTs, use of antiarrhythmics, and periprocedural complications are strong and independent predictors for increased mortality.

Pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics and toxicological profiles of the compounds were also examined using the pkCSM server. All the phytochemicals showed good binding affinity to the binding pocket of PDB ID 6LU7. It was observed that veronicoside A exhibited the highest binding affinity when compared to remdesivir, hydroxy-vernolide, vernodalin, vernodalol, and vernolide.

323412,323412,323412,Does COVID-19 affect male fertility?,16.20749,5.328044,2020,"BACKGROUND: This review is one of a series of rapid reviews that Cochrane contributors have prepared to inform the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. When new respiratory infectious diseases become widespread, such as during the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare workers' adherence to infection prevention and control (IPC) guidelines becomes even more important. Strategies in these guidelines include the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) such as masks, face shields, gloves and gowns; the separation of patients with respiratory infections from others; and stricter cleaning routines. These strategies can be difficult and time-consuming to adhere to in practice. Authorities and healthcare facilities therefore need to consider how best to support healthcare workers to implement them. OBJECTIVES: To identify barriers and facilitators to healthcare workers' adherence to IPC guidelines for respiratory infectious diseases. SEARCH METHODS: We searched OVID MEDLINE on 26 March 2020. As we searched only one database due to time constraints, we also undertook a rigorous and comprehensive scoping exercise and search of the reference lists of key papers. We did not apply any date limit or language limits. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included qualitative and mixed-methods studies (with a distinct qualitative component) that focused on the experiences and perceptions of healthcare workers towards factors that impact on their ability to adhere to IPC guidelines for respiratory infectious diseases. We included studies of any type of healthcare worker with responsibility for patient care. We included studies that focused on IPC guidelines (local, national or international) for respiratory infectious diseases in any healthcare setting. These selection criteria were framed by an understanding of the needs of health workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Four review authors independently assessed the titles, abstracts and full texts identified by our search. We used a prespecified sampling frame to sample from the eligible studies, aiming to capture a range of respiratory infectious disease types, geographical spread and data-rich studies. We extracted data using a data extraction form designed for this synthesis. We assessed methodological limitations using an adapted version of the Critical Skills Appraisal Programme (CASP) tool. We used a 'best fit framework approach' to analyse and synthesise the evidence. This provided upfront analytical categories, with scope for further thematic analysis. We used the GRADE-CERQual (Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative research) approach to assess our confidence in each finding. We examined each review finding to identify factors that may influence intervention implementation and developed implications for practice. MAIN RESULTS: We found 36 relevant studies and sampled 20 of these studies for our analysis. Ten of these studies were from Asia, four from Africa, four from Central and North America and two from Australia. The studies explored the views and experiences of nurses, doctors and other healthcare workers when dealing with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), H1N1, MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome), tuberculosis (TB), or seasonal influenza. Most of these healthcare workers worked in hospitals; others worked in primary and community care settings. Our review points to several barriers and facilitators that influenced healthcare workers' ability to adhere to IPC guidelines. The following factors are based on findings assessed as of moderate to high confidence. Healthcare workers felt unsure as to how to adhere to local guidelines when they were long and ambiguous or did not reflect national or international guidelines. They could feel overwhelmed because local guidelines were constantly changing. They also described how IPC strategies led to increased workloads and fatigue, for instance because they had to use PPE and take on additional cleaning. Healthcare workers described how their responses to IPC guidelines were influenced by the level of support they felt that they received from their management team. Clear communication about IPC guidelines was seen as vital. But healthcare workers pointed to a lack of training about the infection itself and about how to use PPE. They also thought it was a problem when training was not mandatory. Sufficient space to isolate patients was also seen as vital. A lack of isolation rooms, anterooms and shower facilities was a problem. Other important practical measures described by healthcare workers included minimising overcrowding, fast-tracking infected patients, restricting visitors, and providing easy access to handwashing facilities. A lack of PPE, and equipment that was of poor quality, was a serious concern for healthcare workers and managers. They also pointed to the need to adjust the volume of supplies as infection outbreaks continued. Healthcare workers believed that they followed IPC guidance more closely when they saw the value of it. Some healthcare workers felt motivated to follow the guidance because of fear of infecting themselves or their families, or because they felt responsible for their patients. Some healthcare workers found it difficult to use masks and other equipment when it made patients feel isolated, frightened or stigmatised. Healthcare workers also found masks and other equipment uncomfortable to use. The workplace culture could also influence whether healthcare workers followed IPC guidelines or not. Across many of the findings, healthcare workers pointed to the importance of including all staff, including cleaning staff, porters, kitchen staff and other support staff when implementing IPC guidelines. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare workers point to several factors that influence their ability and willingness to follow IPC guidelines when managing respiratory infectious diseases. These include factors tied to the guideline itself and how it is communicated, support from managers, workplace culture, training, physical space, access to and trust in personal protective equipment, and a desire to deliver good patient care. The review also highlights the importance of including all facility staff, including support staff, when implementing IPC guidelines.","Houghton, Catherine; Meskell, Pauline; Delaney, Hannah; Smalle, Mike; Glenton, Claire; Booth, Andrew; Chan, Xin Hui S; Devane, Declan; Biesty, Linda M",Cochrane Database Syst Rev,551,16

COVID-19 was first diagnosed and confirmed in a couple of cases with unknown pneumonia; the patients lived in, or travelled to, Wuhan, the capital of China's Hubei province. People now face a complex challenge that deserves urgent intervention by all involved in medical healthcare globally. Conventional antiviral therapies or vaccines are the most referred means of tackling the virus, but we think establishing these ideal management strategies is presently far-fetched. In-house isolation or quarantine of suspected cases to keep hospital admissions manageable and prevent in-hospital spread of the virus, and promoting general awareness about transmission routes are the practical strategies used to tackle the spread of COVID-19. Cases with weakened or compromised immune systems-for example, elderly individuals, young children, and those with pre-existing conditions such as diabetes, cancer, hypertension, and chronic respiratory diseases-are particularly more susceptible to COVID-19. Hopefully, cumulative data using whole-genome sequencing of the SARS-CoV-2 genome in parallel with mathematical modeling will help the molecular biologists to understand unknown features of the pathogenesis and epidemiology of COVID-19.","Rahimi, Farid; Talebi Bezmin Abadi, Amin",Arch Med Res,551,16

However, to reap the maximum benefits out of this service, a consistent and effective promotion approach using various online platforms is indispensable. Objective To identify what online information the general public can find about which pharmacies across NZ provide vaccination services. Methods Every pharmacy in NZ was reviewed online to determine what vaccination information they advertised, then a sample of pharmacies were randomly selected from six District Health Boards (DHBs) to be called and confirm if the information they stated online was accurate. Results Whilst the majority (more than 70%) of pharmacies did provide information about their services online, only 31% of the pharmacies had vaccination information on their websites, 20% on Healthpoint, and 13% had the information on social media. The telephonic survey revealed various information discrepancies in more than a quarter of the sample. Conclusions A lack of online presence across multiple pharmacies is a pressing issue. Also, currently, NZ pharmacies do not have a very high online presence advertising vaccination services. Improving the amount and quality of this information is pertinent at this time as when COVID-19 vaccination drive may commence anytime, and the pharmacy sector will be well placed to conduct vaccinations on a large scale.","Bell, Georgia Ikhtiari Shekiba Johns Ashley Teoh Devin Webber Shane Napier Patti Anwar Mudassir",Exploratory Research in Clinical and Social Pharmacy,551,20

We developed a generative model we call BETS for four key epidemiological events---Beginning of exposure, End of exposure, time of Transmission, and time of Symptom onset (BETS)---and derived explicit formulas to correct for the sample selection. We gave a detailed illustration of why some early and highly influential analyses of the COVID-19 pandemic were severely biased.

We sought to identify prevalence and characteristics associated with exchange sex among District of Columbia (DC) high school students. METHODS: We used the 2017 DC Youth Risk Behavior Survey, a cross-sectional survey of students in grades 9-12 (n = 8,578). We performed multivariable logistic regression to examine associations between exchange sex and demographic, home environment, and substance use measures. RESULTS: In 2017, a total of 7.4% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 6.6-8.2) of students reported ever having engaged in exchange sex. Odds of exchange sex were higher among males (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 2.5; 95% CI: 1.6-4.0) and students who had sexual contact with partners of both sexes (AOR: 2.4; 95% CI: 1.2-4.9), compared with students having sexual contact with partners of opposite sex only. Exchange sex was also associated with having been kicked out, run away, or abandoned during the past 30 days (AOR: 10.7; 95% CI: 7.0-16.3]); going hungry during the past 30 days (AOR: 2.2; 95% CI: 1.1-4.5); and ever using synthetic marijuana (AOR: 2.6; 95% CI: 1.3-5.0) or cocaine, heroin, methamphetamines, or ecstasy (AOR: 2.9; 95% CI: 1.6-5.3]), compared with those who had not. CONCLUSIONS: Approximately one in 14 DC high school students engaged in exchange sex. Programs providing services to youth with unstable housing, food insecurity, or who use drugs should incorporate sexual health services to address exchange sex practices.","Head, Sara K; Eaton, Danice; Lloyd, Patricia C; McLaughlin, Aimee; Davies-Cole, John",J. adolesc. health,551,24

Furthermore, chemical characterization of the resulting solid outputs (glass, cell, ribbons and residues) was performed in order to assess their further processing options. Additionally, the effect of removing the backsheet as a pre-treatment before the actual delamination process was investigated in relation to the aforementioned aspects of treatment duration and output quality. Results show that increased temperatures reduce the necessary treatment duration (65 minutes at 500°C, 33 minutes at 600°C) while generating the same output quality. The backsheet removal leads to an additional duration decrease of more than 45% at each considered temperature, while also having positive effects relating to fewer solid residues and easier flue gas handling. In regard to the main output specifications no significant influence of the pre-treatment is observed. Overall thermal delamination can be seen as a feasible method in order to obtain high value secondary raw materials from c-Si PV modules, while backsheet removal as pre-treatment should be considered as advantageous from multiple standpoints.","Dobra, Tudor; Vollprecht, Daniel; Pomberger, Roland",Waste Manag Res,551,16

Timely gathering of information on this topic can provide valuable insight and improve the handling of the ongoing and future pandemic outbreaks. Methods and Results A survey instrument developed by the authors was disseminated via e-mail, text messaging, WhatsApp, and social media to interventional cardiologists between April 6, 2020, and April 11, 2020. A total of 509 responses were collected from 18 countries, mainly from the United States (51%) and Italy (36%). Operators reported significant decline in coronary, structural heart, and endovascular procedure volumes. Personal protective equipment was available to 95% of respondents; however FIT-tested N95 or equivalent masks were available to only 70%, and 74% indicated absence of coronavirus disease 2019 pretesting. Most (83%) operators expressed concern when asked to perform cardiac catheterization on a suspected or confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 patient, primarily because of fear of viral transmission (88%). Although the survey demonstrated significant compliance with social distancing, high use of telemedicine (69%), and online education platforms (80%), there was concern over impending financial loss. Conclusions Our survey indicates significant reduction in invasive procedure volumes and concern for viral transmission. There is near universal adoption of personal protective equipment; however, coronavirus disease 2019 pretesting and access to FIT-tested N95 masks is suboptimal. Although there is concern over impending financial loss, substantial engagement in telemedicine and online education is reported.","Banerjee, Subhash; Tarantini, Giuseppe; Abu-Fadel, Mazen; Banerjee, Avantika; Little, Bertis B; Sorajja, Paul; Shishehbor, Mehdi H; Brilakis, Emmanouil S",J Am Heart Assoc,551,16

Therefore, early evaluation and monitoring of both liver and kidney functions, as well as hematologic parameters, are pivotal to forecast the progression of COVID-19. Objectives: In this study, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the association between several complications, including acute kidney injury (AKI), acute liver injury (ALI), and coagulopathy, with poor outcomes in COVID-19. Design: Systematic review and meta-analysis Setting: Observational studies reporting AKI, ALI, and coagulopathy along with the outcomes of clinically validated death, severe COVID-19, or intensive care unit (ICU) care were included in this study. The exclusion criteria were abstract-only publications, review articles, commentaries, letters, case reports, non-English language articles, and studies that did not report key exposures or outcomes of interest. Patients: Adult patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Measurements: Data extracted included author, year, study design, age, sex, cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, respiratory comorbidities, chronic kidney disease, mortality, severe COVID-19, and need for ICU care. Methods: We performed a systematic literature search from PubMed, SCOPUS, EuropePMC, and the Cochrane Central Database. AKI and ALI follow the definition of the included studies. Coagulopathy refers to the coagulopathy or disseminated intravascular coagulation defined in the included studies. The outcome of interest was a composite of mortality, need for ICU care, and severe COVID-19. We used random-effects models regardless of heterogeneity to calculate risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous variables. Heterogeneity was assessed using I2. Random effects meta-regression was conducted for comorbidities and the analysis was performed for one covariate at a time. Results: There were 3615 patients from 15 studies. The mean Newcastle-Ottawa scale of the included studies was 7.3 ± 1.2. The AKI was associated with an increased the composite outcome (RR: 10.55 [7.68, 14.50], P &lt;.001; I2: 0%). Subgroup analysis showed that AKI was associated with increased mortality (RR: 13.38 [8.15, 21.95], P &lt;.001; I2: 24%), severe COVID-19 (RR: 8.12 [4.43, 14.86], P &lt;.001; I2: 0%), and the need for ICU care (RR: 5.90 [1.32, 26.35], P =.02; I2: 0%). The ALI was associated with increased mortality (RR: 4.02 [1.51, 10.68], P =.005; I2: 88%) in COVID-19. Mortality was higher in COVID-19 with coagulopathy (RR: 7.55 [3.24, 17.59], P &lt;.001; I2: 69%). The AKI was associated with the composite outcome and was not influenced by age (P =.182), sex (P =.104), hypertension (P =.788), cardiovascular diseases (P =.068), diabetes (P =.097), respiratory comorbidity (P =.762), and chronic kidney disease (P =.77). Limitations: There are several limitations of this study. Many of these studies did not define the extent of AKI (grade), which may affect the outcome. Acute liver injury and coagulopathy were not defined in most of the studies. The definition of severe COVID-19 differed across studies. Several articles included in the study were published at preprint servers and are not yet peer-reviewed. Most of the studies were from China; thus, some patients might overlap across the reports. Most of the included studies were retrospective in design. Conclusions: This meta-analysis showed that the presence of AKI, ALI, and coagulopathy was associated with poor outcomes in patients with COVID-19.","Lim, Michael Anthonius; Pranata, Raymond; Huang, Ian; Yonas, Emir; Soeroto, Arto Yuwono; Supriyadi, Rudi",Can.

The aim of this study is to describe the COVID-19 orthopedic trauma patients characteristics and management in a dedicated Orthopedic and Traumatology Hospital in Italy during the first pandemic period. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A cohort of 25 consecutive patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection were retrospectively analyzed. Health system rearrangement, patients' clinical presentation, diagnostic tools role, laboratory finding, treatment and outcomes were evaluated. RESULTS: Health system rearrangement was fast. There was no clear prevalence of comorbidity or surgery type between confirmed and suspected COVID-19 cases. Nine positive swabs tests and 14 cases with only suspected CT scan findings were recorded. Several laboratory changes have been reported since the onset of symptoms: anemia, leukocytosis, lymphopenia, coagulation abnormalities, alkaline phosphatase, liver enzymes and C-reactive protein alterations. Nineteen patients were treated by oxygen supplement, three patients were administered antivirals, eight antibiotic therapy, and nine hydroxychloroquine. The number of discharges reported in this study was greater than 52% and the number of deaths reached 20%. CONCLUSION: To our experience, the development of patient management algorithms allows the differentiation of the clinical pathways of negative and suspected/positive patients, reducing exposure, and virus spreading. The execution of swabs on all patients allows an early diagnosis and a more adequate management. Considering the different therapy patterns used, there were no significant differences, but anti-thromboembolic prophylaxis administered to all the orthopedic patients may have contributed to complications and mortality rates reduction.","Faldini, C; Mazzotti, A; Arceri, A; Broccoli, E; Barbagli, E; Di Martino, A",Musculoskelet. surg.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our large (>12 000 000 tests/y) academic hospital laboratory is the Belgian National Reference Center for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) testing. We have performed a moving total of >25 000 SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction tests in parallel to standard routine testing since the start of the outbreak. A LIS implementation team dedicated to develop tools to remove the bottlenecks, primarily situated in the pre- and postanalytical phases, was established early in the crisis. RESULTS: We outline the design, implementation, and requirements of LIS functionality related to managing increased test demand during the COVID-19 crisis, including tools for test ordering, standardized order sets integrated into a computerized provider order entry module, notifications on shipping requirements, automated triaging based on digital metadata forms, and the establishment of databases with contact details of other laboratories and primary care physicians to enable automated reporting. We also describe our approach to data mining and reporting of actionable daily summary statistics to governing bodies and other policymakers. CONCLUSIONS: Rapidly developed, agile extendable LIS functionality and its meaningful use alleviates the administrative burden on laboratory personnel and improves turnaround time of SARS-CoV-2 testing.

The objective of this study was to examine the changes in emergency department (ED) admissions for sexual assault and domestic violence since the COVID-19 pandemic was declared. METHODS: Observational ED admissions data from The Ottawa Hospital were analyzed from March 4 to May 5 (62 days) in 2020 (COVID-19 period) and compared to the same period in 2018 (pre-COVID-19). Total and mean weekly admissions were calculated for all-cause ED admissions and for sexual and domestic violence cases. A Poisson regression (without offset term) was used to calculate the weekly case count ratio and 95% confidence intervals (CI) between the two time periods. Case characteristics were compared using chi-square tests, and percent differences were calculated. RESULTS: Compared to pre-COVID-19, total ED admissions dropped by 1111.22 cases per week (32.9% reduction), and the Sexual Assault and Domestic Violence Program cases dropped 4.66 cases per week. The weekly case count ratio for sexual assault cases was 0.47 (95% CI 0.79-0.27), equivalent of 53.49% reduction in cases, and 0.52 (95% CI 0.93-0.29), equivalent to a 48.45% reduction in physical assault cases. The characteristics of presenting cases were similar by age (median 25 years), sex (88.57% female), assault type (57.14% sexual assault, 48.57% physical assault), and location (31.43% patient's home, 40.00% assailant's home). There was a significant increase in psychological abuse (11.69% vs 28.57%) and assaults occurring outdoors (5.19% vs 22.86%). CONCLUSION: This study found a decrease in ED admissions for sexual assault and domestic violence during COVID-19, despite societal conditions that elevate risk of violence. Trends in care-seeking and assault patterns will require ongoing monitoring to inform the provision of optimal support for individuals experiencing violence, particularly as countries begin to re-open or lock-down again.","Muldoon, Katherine A; Denize, Kathryn M; Talarico, Robert; Fell, Deshayne B; Sobiesiak, Agnes; Heimerl, Melissa; Sampsel, Kari",BMC Med,551,16

Using mobile phone data from 1.2 million devices in Austria (15% of the population) across the first phase of the COVID-19 crisis, we quantify gender-specific patterns of communication intensity, mobility, and circadian rhythms. We show the resilience of behavioral patterns with respect to the shock imposed by a strict nation-wide lock-down that Austria experienced in the beginning of the crisis with severe implications on public and private life. We find drastic differences in gender-specific responses during the different phases of the pandemic. After the lock-down gender differences in mobility and communication patterns increased massively, while sleeping patterns and circadian rhythms tend to synchronize. In particular, women had fewer but longer phone calls than men during the lock-down. Mobility declined massively for both genders, however, women tend to restrict their movement stronger than men. Women showed a stronger tendency to avoid shopping centers and more men frequented recreational areas. After the lock-down, males returned back to normal quicker than women; young age-cohorts return much quicker. Differences are driven by the young and adolescent population. An age stratification highlights the role of retirement on behavioral differences. We find that the length of a day of men and women is reduced by one hour. We discuss the findings in the light of gender-specific coping strategies in response to stress and crisis.","Reisch, Tobias; Heiler, Georg; Hurt, Jan; Klimek, Peter; Hanbury, Allan; Thurner, Stefan",,551,16

To further understand the disease, we compared its clinical characteristics, symptoms, and outcomes by gender. In an analysis of public surveillance data of Taiwan from January 21 to April 18, 2020, a total of 398 patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 by the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in pharynx swabs. We divided the patients into two groups: men and women. The associated data were collected, and multivariate comparisons of radiographic infiltration were conducted to analyze the gender-based differences. The mean incubation period was 5.4±5 days, and the incubation period in men was 3.2 days longer than that in women (8±8.1 vs. 4.8±3, p=0.05). The male patients with COVID-19 with infiltration in chest X-rays (CXR) were 12 years older than their female counterparts. The mortality rate in the male patients with COVID-19 was 6.4-fold higher than that in the female patients (3.2% vs. 0.5%, p<0.05). The patients with co-morbidities of diabetes mellitus and hypertension were vulnerable to infiltration in CXR, and the patients with COVID-19 who had infiltration in CXR easily ended up with intubation, intensive care unit admission, and mortality. Moreover, female patients with COVID-19 who had fever, cough, and dyspnea were susceptible to infiltration in CXR. Irrespective of whether the cases were imported female from Europe, America, or Asia, indigenous male, the factors associated with death in patients with severe COVID-19 were male sex, elderly, female with fever, cough, dyspnea and DM.","Su, Yu-Jang; Kuo, Kuan-Chih; Wang, Ta-Wei; Chang, Chen-Wang",New Microbes New Infect,551,24

This work first aimed to assess in in vitro studies to see whether the death of astrocyte cells promoted by Aß1-42 could be prevented. Second, our work investigated the ability of the M4 compound to inhibit amyloidogenesis using an in vivo model after scopolamine administration. The results showed that M4 possesses a moderate protective effect in astrocytes against Aß1-42 due to a reduction in the TNF-&#945; and free radicals observed in cell cultures. In the in vivo studies, however, no significant effect of M4 was observed in comparison with a galantamine model employed in rats, in which case this outcome was attributed to the bioavailability of M4 in the brain of the rats.","Camarillo-López, Raúl Horacio; Hernández Rodríguez, Maricarmen; Torres-Ramos, Mónica Adriana; Arciniega-Martínez, Ivonne Maciel; García-Marín, Iohanan Daniel; Correa Basurto, José; Méndez Méndez, Juan Vicente; Rosales-Hernández, Martha Cecilia",Molecules (Basel),551,33

METHODS: Patients with COVID-19 confirmed by next-generation sequencing or RT-PCR who had undergone more than 4 serial chest CT procedures were retrospectively enrolled. RESULTS: This study included 361 patients - 192 men and 169 women. On initial chest CT, more lesions were identified as multiple bilateral lungs lesions and localised in the peripheral lung. The predominant patterns of abnormality were ground-glass opacities (GGO) (28.5%), consolidation (13.0%), nodule (23.0%), fibrous stripes (5.3%) and mixed (30.2%).

METHODS: A total of 1260 participants completed the Self-Rating Scale of Sleep (SRSS), the Generalized Anxiety Scale (GAD-7), and the 9-item patient health questionnaire (PHQ-9) via the online questionnaires, and their related experiences with COVID-19 were collected. RESULTS: The average SRSS score of all participants (25.13 ± 6.41) indicated a mild sleep problem, and the factors that influenced their sleep were the respondent's gender, whether they had patients who died under their care, their history of psychosis and whether their family members were infected with COVID-19. The average GAD-7 score of all participants (12.37 ± 4.89) indicated a moderate anxiety level.

Three double-blind placebo trials more than 6000 participants proved that DP acts as a prophylactic for influenza and viral acute respiratory diseases. Experimental evidence proved that the IFN-inducing activity of DP is due to its capacity to inhibit cAMP phosphodiesterase. Additionally, DP demonstrates a marked inhibitory effect on the replication of a broad spectrum of viruses. It was established that DP-induced IFN production in humans is strongly dependent of compound pharmacokinetics.

Using a population-based stroke registry, we investigated the impact of the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in stroke admissions in Joinville, Brazil. METHODS: Patients admitted after the onset of COVID-19 restrictions in the city (defined as March 17, 2020) were compared with those admitted in 2019. We analyzed differences between stroke incidence, types, severity, reperfusion therapies, and time from stroke onset to admission. Statistical tests were also performed to compare the 30 days before and after COVID-19 to the same period in 2019. RESULTS: We observed a decrease in total stroke admissions from an average of 12.9/100 000 per month in 2019 to 8.3 after COVID-19 (P=0.0029). When compared with the same period in 2019, there was a 36.4% reduction in stroke admissions. There was no difference in admissions for severe stroke (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score >8), intraparenchymal hemorrhage, and subarachnoid hemorrhage. CONCLUSIONS: The onset of COVID-19 was correlated with a reduction in admissions for transient, mild, and moderate strokes. Given the need to prevent the worsening of symptoms and the occurrence of medical complications in these groups, a reorganization of the stroke-care networks is necessary to reduce collateral damage caused by COVID-19.","Diegoli, Henrique; Magalhães, Pedro S C; Martins, Sheila C O; Moro, Carla H C; França, Paulo H C; Safanelli, Juliana; Nagel, Vivian; Venancio, Vanessa G; Liberato, Rafaela B; Longo, Alexandre L",Stroke,551,1

METHODS: A UK-wide online and telephone survey was conducted with older adults, people with dementia, and carers between April and May 2020. The survey captured demographic and postcode data, social support service usage before and after COVID-19 public health measures, current quality of life, depression, and anxiety. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to explore the relationship between social support service variations and anxiety and well-being. RESULTS: Five hundred and sixty-nine participants completed the survey (61 people with dementia, 285 unpaid carers, and 223 older adults). Paired samples t-tests and X2 -tests showed that the mean hour of weekly social support service usage and the number of people having accessed various services was significantly reduced post COVID-19. Multiple regression analyses showed that higher variations in social support service hours significantly predicted increased levels of anxiety in people with dementia and older adults, and lower levels of mental well-being in unpaid carers and older adults. CONCLUSIONS: Being unable to access social support services due to COVID contributed to worse quality of life and anxiety in those affected by dementia and older adults across the UK. Social support services need to be enabled to continue providing support in adapted formats, especially in light of continued public health restrictions for the foreseeable future.","Giebel, Clarissa; Lord, Kathryn; Cooper, Claudia; Shenton, Justine; Cannon, Jacqueline; Pulford, Daniel; Shaw, Lisa; Gaughan, Anna; Tetlow, Hilary; Butchard, Sarah; Limbert, Stan; Callaghan, Steve; Whittington, Rosie; Rogers, Carol; Komuravelli, Aravind; Rajagopal, Manoj; Eley, Ruth; Watkins, Caroline; Downs, Murna; Reilly, Siobhan; Ward, Kym; Corcoran, Rhiannon; Bennett, Kate; Gabbay, Mark",Int. j. geriatr. psychiatry,551,10

FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: 3.0 Tesla with normocapnic arterial spin labeling (ASL) and blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) imaging acquired during an interleaved hypercapnic (3 minutes) and normocapnic (3 minutes) respiratory stimulus. ASSESSMENT: CBF, maximum CVR, and time-to-maximum CVR (i.e., CVRDELAY ) were calculated. Laterality indices (difference between infarcted and contralesional hemispheres divided by sum of absolute values) of metrics at enrollment were contrasted between participants with vs. without new infarcts on follow-up. STATISTICAL TESTS: Laterality indices were compared using non-parametric Wilcoxon tests (significance: two-sided P < 0.05) and effect sizes as Cohen's d. Continuous variables are presented as mean ± SD. RESULTS: New infarcts were observed on follow-up in 15.0% of participants. The laterality index of the CVRDELAY was elevated (P = 0.01) in participants with atherosclerosis with new infarcts (index = 0.13) compared to participants without new infarcts (index = 0.05).

Methods Data were derived from a prospective online cohort study of 1448 full-time employees in Japan. Participants were surveyed at baseline from 19-22 March 2020 (T1) and at follow-up from 22-26 May 2020 (T2). A self-administered online questionnaire was used to assess participants' fear and worry of COVID-19, psychological distress, and physical symptoms at T1 and T2. A series of generalized linear models were created to assess changes in outcomes between healthcare and non-healthcare workers. Demographic variables (ie, sex, age, marital status, child[ren], education, and residential area) were included in the models as covariates. Results A total of 1032 participants completed the follow-up questionnaire at T2 (follow-up rate, 72.6%). After excluding unemployed respondents (N=17), the final sample comprised 1015 full-time employees (111 healthcare and 904 non-healthcare workers). After adjusting for the covariates, psychological distress (and subscales of fatigue, anxiety, and depression) as well as fear and worry of COVID-19 increased statistically significantly more among healthcare than non-healthcare workers from T1 to T2. Conclusions Psychological distress, together with fear and worry of COVID-19, increased more among healthcare compared to non-healthcare workers during the COVID-19 outbreak. The study confirmed that healthcare workers are an important target for mental healthcare during the COVID-19 outbreak.","Sasaki, Natsu; Kuroda, Reiko; Tsuno, Kanami; Kawakami, Norito",Scand J Work Environ Health,551,24

We aimed to explore the efficacy and safety of Mycobacterium vaccae nebulization in the treatment of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods: In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, we included 31 adult patients with moderate COVID-19 who were admitted to the Fourth People's Hospital of Nanning (Nanning, China) between January 22, 2020 and February 17, 2020. Patients were randomly divided into two groups: group A (standard care group) and group B (M. vaccae in combination with standard care group). The primary outcome was the time interval from admission to viral RNA negative conversion (oropharyngeal swabs were used in this study). Secondary outcomes included chest computed tomography (CT), mortality, length of hospital stay, complications during treatment, and so on. Patients were followed up to 4 weeks after discharge (reexamination of viral RNA, chest CT, etc.). Results: Nucleic acid test negative conversion time in group B was shorter than that in group A (2.9 days [2.7-8.7] vs. 6.8 days [3.3-13.8]; p = 0.045). No death and no conversion to severe or critical cases were observed in both groups. Two weeks after discharge, neither ""relapse"" nor ""return to positive"" cases were found. Four weeks after discharge, it was found that there was no case of "" relapse "" or ""return to positive"" in group B, and 1 patient in group A showed ""return to positive"", but there was no clinical manifestation and imaging progression. No adverse reactions related to M. vaccae were found during observation period. Conclusion: M. vaccae treatment might shorten the time interval from admission to viral RNA negative conversion, which might be beneficial to the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.

In this study, multi-gene genetic programming (MGGP), as one of the artificial intelligence models, has been proposed for the first time for predicting the COVID-19 outbreak. Although this is a challenging task due to significant fluctuations of daily confirmed cases, the results achieved by MGGP are promising. To be more specific, the predicted confirmed cases are acceptably close to the observed values for seven countries considered in this study. Thus, MGGP is suggested for developing estimation models of COVID-19. Furthermore, similarities and differences between the proposed prediction models are presented. Finally, it is discussed why a country-based prediction model is recommended.","Niazkar, Majid; Niazkar, Hamid Reza",Electro. J. Gen. Med.,551,30

BTB and CNC homology1 (Bach1) is a regulator of oxidative stress and participates in the pathogenesis of multiple lung diseases. Thus, this study aimed to determine the effect of Bach1 knockdown on fibrosis and inflammation in pulmonary fibrosis (PF) mice and cell models. METHODS: Bleomycin induced PF mice were constructed and treated with Bach1 siRNA adenovirus (BLM + Bach1 siRNA group), control siRNA adenovirus (BLM + Control siRNA group) or normal saline (BLM group), then lung tissues were collected for Bach1 expression detection, H&E staining and Masson's trichrome staining. Afterwards, collagen type I alpha 1 chain (COL1A1) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) expressions in serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were examined. Subsequently, mouse lung fibroblasts (MLFs) were collected from PF mice and treated with TGF-ß1 to construct PF cell model, which was treated with Bach1 siRNA adenovirus (TGF-ß1 + Bach1 siRNA group) and MAP kinase (ERK) inhibitor U0126 alone (TGF-ß1 + U0126 group) or in combination (TGF-ß1 + U0126 + Bach1 siRNA group), then alpha-smooth muscle actin (&#945;-SMA), fibronectin 1 (Fn1), COL1A1, IL-6 expressions and cell viability were detected. RESULTS: Lung tissue Bach1 mRNA and protein expressions were upregulated in PF mice compared to control mice. Bach1 knockdown reduced lung fibrosis (displayed by Masson's trichrome staining) and inflammation (displayed by H&E staining), then downregulated serum and BALF expressions of COL1A1 and IL-6 in PF mice. Subsequently, in PF cell model, Bach1 knockdown blocked ERK pathway, but did not affect Smads, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) or thymoma viral proto-oncogene 1 (Akt) pathways. Further experiments revealed that Bach1 knockdown repressed cell viability, &#945;-SMA, Fn1, IL-6 and COL1A1 expressions in PF cell model, then ERK inhibition by U0126 enhanced these effects. CONCLUSIONS: Bach1 is involved in the PF pathogenesis via modulating ERK signaling pathway.","Liu, Yuan; Wang, Yongfu; Lu, Fuai; Wang, Le; Miao, Liu; Wang, Xiaoyuan",Exp Lung Res,551,16

In this paper, we summarize the current evidence to answer the common questions raised by clinicians about this new aerosol delivery route and best practices of administration. Benefits of trans-nasal aerosol delivery include increased comfort, ability to speak, eat, and drink for patients while meeting a range of oxygen requirements, particularly for those who need to inhale aerosolized medication for long periods. Aerosol administration via HFNC has been shown to be well tolerated by children and adults, with comparable or better delivery efficacy than other interfaces, ranging from 2-20%. In vitro and in vivo scintigraphy studies among pediatric and adult populations reported that the inhaled dose delivered via a vibrating mesh nebulizer is 2 to 3 fold greater than that via a jet nebulizer. For adults, placement of nebulizer at the inlet of humidifier increases inhaled dose while reducing rainout obstructing nasal prongs. When HFNC gas flow is set below patient inspiratory flow, aerosol deposition is higher than when the gas flow exceeds patient inspiratory flow;thus, if tolerated, titrating down HFNC gas flow during trans-nasal aerosol delivery, with close monitoring and the use of unit dose with high concentration are recommended. Trans-nasal pulmonary aerosol delivery has not been shown to increase bioaerosols generated by patients, but gas flow may disperse aerosols. Placement of a surgical or procedure mask over HFNC might reduce aerosol dispersion.","Li, J.; Fink, J. B.",Annals of Translational Medicine,551,24

Lumen formation requires that cells coordinately orient their polarity axis so that the basolateral domain is on the outside and apical domain inside epithelial structures. Here we show that the transmembrane aminopeptidase, CD13, is a key determinant of epithelial polarity orientation. CD13 localizes to the apical membrane and associates with an apical complex with Par6. CD13-deficient cells display inverted polarity in which apical proteins are retained on the outer cell periphery and fail to accumulate at an intercellular apical initiation site. Here we show that CD13 is required to couple apical protein cargo to Rab11-endosomes and for capture of endosomes at the apical initiation site. This role in polarity utilizes the short intracellular domain but is independent of CD13 peptidase activity.","Wang, Li-Ting; Rajah, Abira; Brown, Claire M; McCaffrey, Luke",Nat Commun,551,20

Many routine laboratory tests, such as ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase, and D-dimer, were increased in severe and extremely severe patients. The absolute numbers of CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and B cells were gradually decreased with increased severity of illness. The activation markers such as HLA-DR and CD45RO expressed on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were increased in severe and extremely severe patients compared with mild patients. The costimulatory molecule CD28 had opposite results. The percentage of natural Tregs was decreased in extremely severe patients.

The percentage of IFN-Î³-producing CD4+ T cells was increased in extremely severe patients. IL-2R, IL-6, and IL-10 were all increased in extremely severe patients. The activation of DC and B cells was decreased in extremely severe patients.CONCLUSIONThe number and function of T cells are inconsistent in COVID-19 patients. The hyperfunction of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells is associated with the pathogenesis of extremely severe SARS-CoV-2 infection.FUNDINGThis work was funded by the National Mega Project on Major Infectious Disease Prevention (2017ZX10103005-007) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (2019kfyRCPY098).","Wang, Feng; Hou, Hongyan; Luo, Ying; Tang, Guoxing; Wu, Shiji; Huang, Min; Liu, Weiyong; Zhu, Yaowu; Lin, Qun; Mao, Liyan; Fang, Minghao; Zhang, Huilan; Sun, Ziyong",JCI insight,551,26

METHODS: A network pharmacology-based method was utilized. First candidate compounds, targets of GX II were collected using PharmMapper, BATMAN-TCM, DrugBank and SwissTargetPrediction, and targets on CHD were mined from GeneCards, DisGenet, DrugBank and GEO. Afterwards, the big hub compounds and targets were chosen in the candidate compounds-direct therapeutic targets on the CHD (C-T) network and the direct therapeutic targets on the CHD (T-D) network. Furthermore, the Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis were performed to identify the enriched terms. Finally, a molecular docking simulation strategy was adopted to verify the binding capacity between the big hub compounds and big hub targets on CHD. RESULTS: First, 114 candidate compounds were selected with the following criteria: OBâ©¾30%, DLâ©¾0.18, and HL â©¾4 h. Then, 1,035 targets of GX II were gathered, while 928 targets on CHD were collected. Afterwards, 196 common targets of compound targets and therapeutic targets on CHD were defined as direct therapeutic targets acting on CHD. In addition, the contribution index (CI) in the C-T network was calculated, and 4 centrality properties, including degree, betweenness, closeness and coreness, in the T-D network, 4 big hub compounds, and 6 big hub targets were eventually chosen. Furthermore, the GO and KEGG analysis indicated that GX II acted on CHD by regulating the reactive oxygen species metabolism, steroid metabolism, lipid metabolism, inflammatory response, proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. The docking results manifested excellent binding capacity between the 4 big hub compounds and 6 big hub targets on CHD. CONCLUSION: This network pharmacology-based exploration revealed that GX II might prevent and inhibit the primary pathological processes of CHD.","Sheng, Song; Yang, Zhi-Xu; Xu, Feng-Qin; Huang, Ye",Chinese Journal of Integrative Medicine,551,10

International guidance suggests direct droplet transmission is likely and airborne transmission occurs only with aerosol-generating procedures. Recommendations determining infection control measures to ensure healthcare worker safety follow these presumptions. Three mechanisms have been described for the production of smaller sized respiratory particles ('aerosols') that, if inhaled, can deposit in the distal airways. These include: laryngeal activity such as talking and coughing; high velocity gas flow; and cyclical opening and closure of terminal airways. Sneezing and coughing are effective aerosol generators, but all forms of expiration produce particles across a range of sizes. The 5-µm diameter threshold used to differentiate droplet from airborne is an over-simplification of multiple complex, poorly understood biological and physical variables. The evidence defining aerosol-generating procedures comes largely from low-quality case and cohort studies where the exact mode of transmission is unknown as aerosol production was never quantified. We propose that transmission is associated with time in proximity to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-1 patients with respiratory symptoms, rather than the procedures per se. There is no proven relation between any aerosol-generating procedure with airborne viral content with the exception of bronchoscopy and suctioning. The mechanism for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 transmission is unknown but the evidence suggestive of airborne spread is growing. We speculate that infected patients who cough, have high work of breathing, increased closing capacity and altered respiratory tract lining fluid will be significant producers of pathogenic aerosols. We suggest several aerosol-generating procedures may in fact result in less pathogen aerosolisation than a dyspnoeic and coughing patient. Healthcare workers should appraise the current evidence regarding transmission and apply this to the local infection prevalence. Measures to mitigate airborne transmission should be employed at times of risk. However, the mechanisms and risk factors for transmission are largely unconfirmed. Whilst awaiting robust evidence, a precautionary approach should be considered to assure healthcare worker safety.","Wilson, N M; Norton, A; Young, F P; Collins, D W",Anaesthesia,551,22

However, there are not many published articles on the pathological findings in the liver of COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We collected the clinical data from 17 autopsy cases of COVID-19 patients including age, sex, BMI, liver function test (ALT, AST, ALP, direct bilirubin and total bilirubin), D-dimer and anticoagulation treatment. We examined histopathologic findings in postmortem hepatic tissue, immunohistochemical (IHC) staining with antibody against COVID spike protein, CD68 and CD61, and electron microscopy. We counted the number of megakaryocytes in liver sections from these COVID-19 positive cases. RESULTS: Abnormal liver-associated enzymes were observed in 12/17 cases of COVID-19 infection. With the exception of three cases that had not been tested for D-dimer, all 14 patients' D-dimer levels were increased, including the cases that received varied doses of anticoagulation treatment. Microscopically, the major findings were widespread platelet-fibrin microthrombi, steatosis, histiocytic hyperplasia in the portal tract, mild lobular inflammation, ischemic-type hepatic necrosis and zone 3 hemorrhage. Rare megakaryocytes were found in sinusoids. COVID IHC demonstrates positive staining of the histiocytes in the portal tract. Under electron microscopy, histiocyte proliferation is present in the portal tract containing lipid droplets, lysosomes, dilated ribosomal endoplasmic reticulum (RER), micro-vesicular bodies and coronavirus. CONCLUSIONS: The characteristic findings in COVID-19 patients' liver include numerous amounts of platelet-fibrin microthrombi as well as various degrees of steatosis and histiocytic hyperplasia in the portal tract. Possible mechanisms are also discussed.","Zhao, Chaohui Lisa; Rapkiewicz, Amy; Maghsoodi-Deerwester, Mona; Gupta, Mala; Cao, Wenqing; Palaia, Thomas; Zhou, Jianhong; Ram, Bebu; Vo, Duc; Rafiee, Behnam; Hossein-Zadeh, Zarrin; Dabiri, Bahram; Hanna, Iman",Hum. pathol,551,16

Patients with cancer are at increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and have worse outcomes than patients with COVID-19 who do not have cancer. Virtual care has been introduced quickly and extemporaneously in cancer treatment centers worldwide to maintain COVID-19-free zones. The outbreak of COVID-19 in a cancer center could have devastating consequences. The virtual care intervention that was first used in our cancer center, as well as many others, was a landline telephone in an office or clinic that connected a clinician with a patient. There is a lack of virtual care evaluation from the perspectives of patients and oncology health care providers. A number of factors for assessing oncology care delivered through a virtual care intervention have been described, including patient rapport, frailty, delicate conversations, team-based care, resident education, patient safety, technical effectiveness, privacy, operational effectiveness, and resource utilization. These factors are organized according to the National Quality Forum framework for the assessment of telehealth in oncology. This includes the following 4 domains of assessing outcomes: experience, access to care, effectiveness, and financial impact or cost. In terms of virtual care and oncology, the pandemic has opened the door to change. The lessons learned during the initial period of the pandemic have given rise to opportunities for the evolution of long-term virtual care. The opportunity to evaluate and improve virtual care should be seized upon.","Levine, Oren Hannun; McGillion, Michael; Levine, Mark",JMIR Cancer,551,24

The various candidates employ a range of vaccine strategies including some novel approaches. Currently, the goal is to prove that they are safe and immunogenic in humans (phase 1/2 studies) with several now advancing into phase 2 and 3 trials to demonstrate efficacy and gather comprehensive data on safety. It is highly likely that many vaccines will be shown to stimulate antibody and T cell responses in healthy individuals and have an acceptable safety profile, but the key will be to confirm that they protect against COVID-19. There is much hope that SARS-CoV-2 vaccines will be rolled out to the entire world to contain the pandemic and avert its most damaging impacts. However, in all likelihood this will initially require a targeted approach toward key vulnerable groups. Collaborative efforts are underway to ensure manufacturing can occur at the unprecedented scale and speed required to immunize billions of people. Ensuring deployment also occurs equitably across the globe will be critical.

DDX3 is a RNA helicase with tumor suppressor and oncogenic potential that was described as a prognosticator in FBC and can be targeted by small molecule inhibitors of DDX3. The aim of this study was to evaluate if DDX3 is a useful prognosticator for MBC patients. Nuclear as well as cytoplasmic DDX3 expression was studied by immunohistochemistry in a Dutch retrospective cohort of 106 MBC patients. Differences in 10-year survival by DDX3 expression were analyzed using log-rank test. The association between clinicopathologic variables, DDX3 expression, and survival was tested in uni- and multivariate Cox-regression analysis. High cytoplasmic DDX3 was associated with high androgen receptor (AR) expression while low nuclear DDX3 was associated with negative lymph node status. Nuclear and cytoplasmic DDX3 were not associated with each other. In a univariate analysis, high cytoplasmic DDX3 (p = 0.045) was significantly associated with better 10-year overall survival. In multivariate analyses, cytoplasmic DDX3 had independent prognostic value (p = 0.017). In conclusion, cytoplasmic DDX3 expression seems to be a useful prognosticator in MBC, as high cytoplasmic DDX3 indicated better 10-year survival.","van der Pol, Carmen C; Moelans, Cathy B; Manson, Quirine F; Batenburg, Marilot C T; van der Wall, Elsken; Borel Rinkes, Inne; Verkooijen, Lenny; Raman, Venu; van Diest, Paul J",Virchows arch,551,1

In this regard, digitalization, which offers the so called remote models of social communications, is becoming the most topical issue not only among the expert community of politicians, economists, scientists and public figures, but also among ordinary people. The global pandemic has determined both the speed and the global networked nature of the spread of the digital environment in national sociocultural contexts. This determines the special relevance of the problems of professional assessment of the digital environment in the mass consciousness of the Russians. The imperative digitalization of basic social institutions, such as medicine and education, requires the consumer to activate adaptive-compensatory reserves, master new forms of communication and interaction as well as a reflexive response. Basing on the carried out sociological empirical studies (mass surveys of the population), the article presents the results which allow us to see the current state of public reflection on digitalization against the background of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, to objectively describe the subjective assessments of the spread of the DT culture thinking patterns and practices in the socio-cultural environment of Russia. As a result, it has been revealed that in all institutional practices, except for family ones, the respondents agree with the need to promote the implementation of digital technologies. The respondents did not demonstrate a high level of negativity or put forward proposals to significantly limit digitalization for all the questionnaire items.

Reports on the prevalence and prognosis of thrombotic complications are still emerging. OBJECTIVE: To describe the rate of TEE complications and its influence in the prognosis of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 after a cross-sectional study. METHODS: We evaluated the prevalence of TEE and its relationship with in-hospital death among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who were admitted between 1st March to 20th April 2020 in a multicentric network of sixteen Hospitals in Spain. TEE was defined by the occurrence of venous thromboembolism (VTE), acute ischemic stroke (AIS), systemic arterial embolism or myocardial infarction (MI). RESULTS: We studied 1737 patients with proven COVID-19 infection of whom 276 died (15.9%). TEE were presented in 64 (3.7%) patients: 49 (76.6%) patients had a VTE, 8 (12.5%) patients had MI, 6 (9.4%%) patients had AIS, and one (1.5%) patient a thrombosis of portal vein.

OBJECTIVE: (1) To quantify skin damage with increased usage frequency of ABHS by consumers and (2) To evaluate Virgin Coconut Oil (VCO) as natural prophylactic agent to counter the adverse effects. METHODS: In-home usage study was carried out with 60 volunteers for a 15-day intervention-Control Group: 6 applications per day of ABHS and Test Group: Overnight VCO use (6-8 drops) followed by 6× usage per day of ABHS. This leg included dermatological evaluation and WHO Self-Assessment Scale for skin health. Another leg of measurement included non-invasive instrumental study (Moisture & TEWL Probes, Tape Strip for protein content and IR spectroscopy for protein & lipid content) on forearm of 12 subjects (25-60 years age) with and without VCO application and repeated alcohol exposure. RESULTS: In-home usage study established consumer experiencing skin protective effect of VCO in the context of ABHS onslaught. 25% increase in perceived moisture content was recorded for VCO users, using WHO Self-Assessment Scale. Instrumental studies confirmed an increase in TEWL and decrease in lipids & protein content. Overnight VCO application resists the extraction which builds up with repeated application. CONCLUSIONS: Current work provides evidence of compromised hand skin barrier with ABHS daily usage. Overnight VCO application helps prepare the skin for next day alcohol use. Based on the findings, a regimen of overnight VCO application on hands as a natural prophylactic is recommended.","Saraogi, Punit; Kaushik, Vaibhav; Chogale, Ritesh; Chavan, Sneha; Gode, Vaishali; Mhaskar, Sudhakar",J Cosmet Dermatol,551,5

BACKGROUND: With the absence of specific treatment/vaccines for the coronavirus COVID-19, the most appropriate approach to control this infection is to quarantine people and isolate symptomatic people and suspected or infected cases. Although real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay is considered the first tool to make a definitive diagnosis of COVID-19 disease, the high false negative rate, low sensitivity, limited supplies and strict requirements for laboratory settings might delay accurate diagnosis. Computed tomography (CT) has been reported as an important tool to identify and investigate suspected patients with COVID-19 disease at early stage. KEY FINDINGS: RT-PCR shows low sensitivity (60-71%) in diagnosing patients with COVID-19 infection compared to the CT chest. Several studies reported that chest CT scans show typical imaging features in all patients with COVID-19. This high sensitivity and initial presentation in CT chest can be helpful in rectifying false negative results obtained from RT-PCR. As COVID-19 has similar manifestations to other pneumonia diseases, artificial intelligence (AI) might help radiologists to differentiate COVID-19 from other pneumonia diseases. CONCLUSION: Although CT scan is a powerful tool in COVID-19 diagnosis, it is not sufficient to detect COVID-19 alone due to the low specificity (25%), and challenges that radiologists might face in differentiating COVID-19 from other viral pneumonia on chest CT scans. AI might help radiologists to differentiate COVID-19 from other pneumonia diseases. IMPLICATION FOR PRACTICE: Both RT-PCR and CT tests together would increase sensitivity and improve quarantine efficacy, an impact neither could achieve alone.","Alsharif, W; Qurashi, A",,551,1

Several theories about the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 have recently been proposed. Although Betacoronavirus found in Rhinolophus bats from China have been broadly implicated, their genetic dissimilarity to SARS-CoV-2 is so high that they are highly unlikely to be its direct ancestors. Thus, an intermediary host is suspected to link bat to human coronaviruses. Based on genomic CpG dinucleotide patterns in different coronaviruses from different hosts, it was suggested that SARS-CoV-2 might have evolved in a canid gastrointestinal tract prior to transmission to humans. However, similar CpG patterns are now reported in coronaviruses from other hosts, including bats themselves and pangolins. Therefore, reduced genomic CpG alone is not a highly predictive biomarker, suggesting a need for additional biomarkers to reveal intermediate hosts or tissues. The hunt for the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 continues.","Leitner, Thomas; Kumar, Sudhir",Mol Biol Evol,551,0

Furthermore, the levels of both serum cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) decrease with Covid-19 severity, with normal levels resuming once the infection has passed. Here we demonstrate that the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein interferes with the function of lipoproteins, and that this is dependent on cholesterol. In particular, the ability of HDL to exchange lipids from model cellular membranes is altered when co-incubated with the spike protein. Additionally, the S protein removes lipids and cholesterol from model membranes.

In this line, Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak caused by the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, has caused a huge impact on our environment, and has exposed healthcare workers to an unprecedented threat. In this study, we try to assess sleep quality and the development of sleep disorders in health personnel directly dedicated to the care of COVID-19 patients at the height of the pandemic, compared to the general population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional, anonymized, self-reported questionnaire survey was carried out at the ""12 de Octubre"" Hospital, in Madrid, Spain, during the outbreak of COVID-19, from March 1st to April 30th 2020. We compared two groups, healthcare workers who have treated directly COVID-19 patients versus non-healthcare workers. The questionnaire included demographic data, sleep related aspects, Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and 17-items Hamilton Rating Scale (HRS). RESULTS: In total 170 participants completed the questionnaire successfully, 100 healthcare workers and 70 non-healthcare workers. Self-reported insomnia, nightmares, sleepwalking, sleep terrors and PSQI>6 were more frequent in the healthcare group (p < 0,05). Shift work was associated to greater risk when performing multiple logistic regression analysis. CONCLUSIONS: We observed that, during the outbreak of COVID-19, healthcare workers on the front line developed more sleep disturbances than non-healthcare professionals, and they had worse quality of sleep. Special attention should be paid to shift workers.

Based on the Italian COVID-19 death surveillance, which collects data from all the hospitals throughout the country, we aimed to describe clinical features and care pathway of patients dying with COVID-19 and a preceding diagnosis of a PD. Methods: in this cross-sectional study, the characteristics of a representative sample of patients, who have died with COVID-19 in Italian hospitals between February 21st and August 3rd 2020, were drawn from medical charts, described and analysed by multinomial logistic regression according to the recorded psychiatric diagnosis: no PD, severe PD (SPD) (i.e. schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, bipolar and related disorders), common mental disorder (CMD) (i.e. depression without psychotic features, anxiety disorders). Findings: the 4020 COVID-19 deaths included in the study took place in 365 hospitals across Italy. Out of the 4020 deceased patients, 84 (2â¢1%) had a previous SPD, 177 (4.4%) a CMD. The mean age at death was 78.0 (95%CI 77.6-78.3) years among patients without a PD, 71.8 (95%CI 69.3-72.0) among those with an SPD, 79.5 (95%CI 78.0-81.1) in individuals with a CMD. 2253 (61.2%) patients without a PD, 62 (73.8%) with an SPD, and 136 (78.2%) with a CMD were diagnosed with three or more non-psychiatric comorbidities.When we adjusted for clinically relevant variables, including hospital of death, we found that SPD patients died at a younger age than those without a PD (adjusted OR per 1 year increment 0.96; 95% CI 0.94-0.98). Women were significantly more represented among CMD patients compared to patients without previous psychiatric history (aOR 1.56; 95% CI 1.05-2.32). Hospital admission from long-term care facilities (LTCFs) was strongly associated with having an SPD (aOR 9.02; 95% CI 4.99-16.3) or a CMD (aOR 2.09; 95% CI 1.19-3.66). Comorbidity burden, fever, admission to intensive care and time from symptoms' onset to nasopharyngeal swab did not result significantly associated with an SPD or with a CMD in comparison to those without any PD. Interpretation: even where equal treatment is in place, the vulnerability of patients with a PD may reduce their chance of recovering from COVID-19. The promotion of personalised therapeutic projects aimed at including people with PD in the community rather than in non-psychiatric LTCFs should be prioritised.","Lega, Ilaria; Nisticò, Lorenza; Palmieri, Luigi; Caroppo, Emanuele; Lo Noce, Cinzia; Donfrancesco, Chiara; Vanacore, Nicola; Scattoni, Maria Luisa; Picardi, Angelo; Gigantesco, Antonella; Brusaferro, Silvio; Onder, Graziano",EClinicalMedicine,551,1

Although vaccines aroused great expectations, their side effects on Japanese people and the antibody titer transition after vaccination are unclear. METHODS: The side effects of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine in participants who received vaccination at our center were investigated. Some participants were also surveyed for the antibody titer transition. RESULTS: In this study, 983 and 798 Japanese participants responded to the first and second doses, respectively. Side effects occurred in 757 (77.0%) and 715 participants (90.0%) after the first and second doses, respectively. No Grade 4 side effects occurred. The second dose had significantly more side effects than the first dose (p < 0.001). Side effects occurred after the second dose in 571 female (92.1%) and 178 male participants (80.1%). Female participants had a higher incidence of side effects than the male participants (p < 0.001). A comparison among the age groups showed significant differences (p = 0.018), and the frequency of side effects decreased with age. Twenty-three individuals participated in the survey of antibody titer transition. After the second vaccine dose, the median antibody titers for IgG and IgM were 3.76 and 0.07 AU/mL, respectively. Both IgG and IgM titers showed a significant increase over the study period (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine might be safe for Japanese people, and the antibody titer increased with two doses of vaccination. Larger nationwide studies are warranted to verify these findings.","Izumo, Takehiro; Kuse, Naoyuki; Awano, Nobuyasu; Tone, Mari; Sakamoto, Keita; Takada, Kohei; Muto, Yutaka; Fujimoto, Kazushi; Saiki, Ayae; Ito, Yu; Matsumoto, Haruko; Inomata, Minoru",Respiratory investigation (Online),551,25

In addition, tetraspanin CD81 regulates HIV reverse transcription through its association with the dNTP hydrolase SAMHD1. Here we aimed at analysing the role of CD81 in Herpes simplex virus 1 infectivity using a neuroblastoma cell model. For this purpose, we generated a CD81 KO cell line using the CRISPR/Cas9 technology. Despite being CD81 a plasma membrane protein, CD81 KO cells showed no defects in viral entry nor in the expression of early protein markers. In contrast, glycoprotein B and C, which require viral DNA replication for their expression, were significantly reduced in CD81 KO infected cells. Indeed, HSV-1 DNA replication and the formation of new infectious particles were severely compromised in CD81 KO cells. We could not detect significant changes in SAMHD1 total expression levels, but a relocalization into endosomal structures was observed in CD81 KO cells. In summary, CD81 KO cells showed impaired viral DNA replication and produced greatly diminished viral titers.","Benayas, Beatriz; Sastre, Isabel; López-Martín, Soraya; Oo, Adrian; Kim, Baek; Bullido, Maria J; Aldudo, Jesús; Yáñez-Mó, María",Med Microbiol Immunol,551,16

CASE REPORT: We report the case of a 42-year-old healthy Caucasian male anesthetist who had treated COVID-19 patients during the previous 5 weeks and suddenly presented with a temporal relative scotoma in his left eye. Best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 for the left eye, and no discromatopsy or afferent pupillary defect was present. Visual field test was performed, with no significant findings associated with the focal loss of sensitivity described by the patient. The anterior segment was unremarkable on slit lamp examination in both eyes. Fundus examination of the left eye showed no significant findings. A placoid, hyperreflective band at the level of the GCL and IPL was visible in OCT which spared the outer retina, at the time of diagnosis and 1 month later. An oropharyngeal swab test was performed for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) ribonucleic acid (RNA), immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) determination. Real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was negative. ELISA testing and a third rapid antibody detection test performed 7 days after the onset of symptoms were positive. CONCLUSIONS: Ocular signs and symptoms in COVID-19 cases are rarely reported, but may be underestimated, especially those that affect the retina and occur in asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic cases.

We compared the rates of mortality and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) after renal transplantation in patients with and without pre-transplant diabetes. Furthermore, we investigated whether transplant era and recipient age affected the association between diabetes status and adverse events. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included 691 patients who underwent renal transplantation between 1994 and 2016 at a single tertiary center. We compared the incidences of post-transplant mortality and four-point MACE in patients with and without pre-transplant diabetes using Kaplan-Meier analysis and the Cox proportional hazard model, and assessed the interactions between diabetes status and transplant era and recipient age. RESULTS: Of 691 kidney recipients, 143 (20.7%) had pre-transplant diabetes. The mean follow-up duration was 94.5 months. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that patients with pre-transplant diabetes had higher incidences of post-transplant mortality and four-point MACE compared with those without pre-transplant diabetes (log rank test, p < 0.001 for both). After adjusting for potential confounding factors, pre-transplant diabetes was associated with an increased risk of post-transplant mortality and four-point MACE (hazard ratio [HR], 1.90; confidence interval [CI], 1.05-3.44; p = 0.034; and HR, 1.75; CI, 1.02-3.00; p = 0.043, respectively). The associations between pre-transplant diabetes status and all-cause mortality and four-point MACE were not affected by transplant era or recipient age. CONCLUSIONS: Pre-transplant diabetes remains a significant risk factor for mortality and four-point MACE in kidney transplant recipients.","Jeon, Ja Young; Kim, Soo Jung; Ha, Kyoung Hwa; Park, Ji Hyun; Park, Bumhee; Oh, Chang-Kwon; Han, Seung Jin",J. diabetes investig.

However, due to limited resources, re-assessment of treatment paradigms in the wake of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is urgently required. In this rapid review, we described contemporary oncological outcomes for OSCC using non-surgical modalities. METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted for articles published between January 1, 2010 and April 1, 2020 on MEDLINE and Cochrane CENTRAL. Studies were included if they contained patients with OSCC treated with either neoadjuvant, induction, or definitive radiotherapy, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or combination thereof, and an outcome of overall survival. RESULTS: In total, 36 articles were included. Definitive radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy were the focus of 18 articles and neoadjuvant chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy were the focus of the other 18 articles. In early stage OSCC, definitive radiotherapy, with or without concurrent chemotherapy, was associated with a significantly increased hazard of death compared to definitive surgery (HR: 2.39, 95% CI: 1.56-3.67, I2: 63%). The hazard of death was non-significantly increased with definitive chemoradiotherapy in studies excluding early disease (HR: 1.98, 95% CI: 0.85-4.64, I2: 84%). Two recent randomized control trials have been conducted, demonstrating no survival advantage to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: This review suggests that primary radiotherapy and chemoradiotherapy are inferior to surgical management for OSCC. Strategies for surgical delay warranting consideration are sparse, but may include several neoadjuvant regimens, recognizing these regimens may not offer a survival benefit over definitive surgery alone.","Forner, David; Noel, Christopher W; Wu, Vincent; Parmar, Ambica; Chan, Kelvin K W; de Almeida, John R; Husain, Zain; Eskander, Antoine",Oral Oncol,551,20

We aimed to isolate seasonal CoVs in Yamagata, Japan to obtain infective virions useful for further research and to accelerate fundamental studies on HCoVs and SARS-CoV-2. Using modified air-liquid interface (ALI) culture of the normal human airway epithelium from earlier studies, we isolated 29 HCoVs (80.6%: 16, 6, 6, and 1 isolates of HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-229E, respectively) from 36 cryopreserved nasopharyngeal specimens. In ALI cultures of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-NL63, the harvested medium contained more than 1×104 genome copies/µL at every tested time point during the more than 100 days of culture. Four isolates of HCoV-NL63 were further subcultured and successfully propagated in an LLC-MK2 cell line. Our results suggest that ALI culture is useful for isolating seasonal CoVs and sustainably obtaining HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-NL63 virions. Furthermore, the LLC-MK2 cell line in combination with ALI cultures can be used for the large-scale culturing of HCoV-NL63. Further investigations are necessary to develop methods for culturing difficult-to-culture seasonal CoVs in cell lines.","Komabayashi, Kenichi; Matoba, Yohei; Seto, Junji; Ikeda, Yoko; Tanaka, Waka; Aoki, Yoko; Ikeda, Tatsuya; Matsuzaki, Yoko; Itagaki, Tsutomu; Shirato, Kazuya; Mizuta, Katsumi",Jpn. j. infect. dis,551,1

This is the question that has occupied ophthalmologists since the beginning of the outbreak. In order to infect a certain type of tissue specific receptors for each virus and sometimes also coreceptors or other proteins must be present. The aim of this review was to summarize and reflect the current state of research with the help of the currently available literature as of 28 May 2020. At the time of the research, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was clearly identified as the receptor and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) as the necessary protease to enable the infection of human cells with SARS-CoV­2. In the eye both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are expressed, although sometimes very weakly and with varying degrees in different tissues. It is noteworthy that very different results were obtained with different methods. Several reasons can account for this effect: Firstly, the method of detection or preservation of the tissue, secondly, the possibly different expression of the tested tissue samples and thirdly, a possibly rapid loss of receptor expression post-mortem. Therefore, an infection of the eye seems possible, which has already been reported in various publications. The amount of virus or receptor expression necessary to cause an infection is not known. According to current state of knowledge the eye is not considered to be a high-risk tissue due to the low ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression. Nevertheless, appropriate protective measures are necessary for both medical personnel and patients. In cases of corneal transplantation an infection of the donor tissue with SARS-CoV­2 must be excluded.","Schnichels, Sven; Rohrbach, Jens Martin; Bayyoud, Tarek; Thaler, Sebastian; Ziemssen, Focke; Hurst, José",Ophthalmologe,551,1

Design/methodology/approach: Using an extensive micro-level data set of personal and job-related attributes containing all unemployed individuals in the Portuguese tourism and hospitality industry, a logit model with 56,142 observations is estimated to assess how each characteristic contributed to the unemployment odds during the COVID-19 crisis (until the end-July 2020), relatively to the pre-COVID period. Findings: The most vulnerable workers to COVID-19 unemployment seem to be older, less educated, less qualified, women and residents in regions with a higher concentration of people and tourism activity. Moreover, the COVID-19 crisis is generating a new type of unemployment by also affecting those who were never unemployed before, with more stable jobs and more motivated at work, while reducing voluntary disruptions. Practical implications: Public effort should be made not only to increase workforce education but especially to reinforce job-specific skills. The COVID-19 crisis has broken traditional protective measures against unemployment and separated workers from their desired occupations, which justifies new and exceptional job preservation measures. Policy recommendations are given aiming at strengthening worker resilience and industry competitiveness in the most affected sub-sectors and regions. Originality/value: This study extends the current understanding of worker vulnerability to economic downturns. Herein, this paper used a three-level approach (combining socio-demographic, work-related and regional factors), capturing the immediate effects of the COVID-19 crisis and focussing on the tourism and hospitality industry (the hardest-hit sector worldwide). © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Lopes, A.

It is a known fact that co-morbidities, including Diabetes Mellitus, pose a higher risk of infection by COVID-19. Additionally, the outcomes following infection are far worse than in people without such co-morbities.Factors contributing to the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have long been established, yet this disease still bestows a substantial global burden. The aim was to provide a comprehensive review of the burden of diabetes pre-COVID-19 and the additional impact sustained by the diabetes population and healthcare systems during the COVID-19 pandemic, while providing recommendations of how this burden can be subsided. Methodology: Literature searches were carried out on 'Google Scholar' and 'PubMed' to identify relevant articles for the scope of this review. Information was also collected from reliable sources such as the World Health Organisation and the International Diabetes Federation. Results: T2DM presented with economic, social and health burdens prior to COVID-19 with an significant 'Disability Adjusted Life Years' impact. Whilst people with diabetes are more susceptible to COVID-19, enforcing lockdown regulations set by the Public Health department to reduce risk of infection brought about its own challenges to T2DM management. Through recommendations and adapting to new methods of management such as telehealth, these challenges and potential consequences of mismanagement are kept to a minimum whilst safeguarding the healthcare system. Conclusion: By understanding the challenges and burdens faced by this population both evident pre-covid and during, targeted healthcare can be provided during the COVID-19 pandemic.

In the current study, a novel ""symptomics"" approach was employed to examine the association between acute transdiagnostic symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), major depressive disorder (MDD), and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and burnout and work and relationship difficulties in FHCWs at an urban tertiary care hospital in New York City. METHODS: Symptoms of COVID-19-related PTSD (4-item PTSD Checklist-5), MDD (Patient Health Questionnaire-8), GAD (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7), burnout (Single-Item Mini-Z Burnout Assessment), and functional difficulties (Brief Inventory of Psychosocial Functioning) were assessed. Relative importance analyses were conducted to identify PTSD, MDD, and GAD symptoms associated with burnout and functional difficulties. RESULTS: The total number of eligible participants included 6,026 presumed FHCWs, of which 3,360 (55.8%) completed the survey and 2,579 (76.8%) of whom endorsed directly treating patients with COVID-19 and provided sufficient responses to our outcome variables for analysis. Feeling tired/having little energy, being easily annoyed or irritable, and feeling nervous, anxious, or on edge were most strongly associated with burnout; feeling tired/having little energy accounted for the greatest amount of explained variance (> 15%). Negative expectations of oneself or the world, trouble concentrating, and feeling easily annoyed or irritable were most strongly associated with work difficulties; negative expectations of oneself or the world accounted for the greatest amount of explained variance (> 9%). Feeling easily annoyed or irritable, negative expectations about oneself or the world, and feeling bad about oneself were most strongly associated with relationship difficulties; feeling easily annoyed or irritable accounted for the greatest amount of explained variance (> 10%). CONCLUSIONS: Results of this study underscore the importance of a transdiagnostic, symptom-based approach when examining associations between acute psychopathology and burnout and functional difficulties in FHCWs. Further work is needed to determine if early interventions aimed at ameliorating specific psychiatric symptoms may help mitigate risk for peri- and posttraumatic burnout and functional difficulties in this population.","Kachadourian, Lorig K; Feder, Adriana; Murrough, James W; Feingold, Jordyn H; Kaye-Kauderer, Halley; Charney, Dennis; Southwick, Steven M; Peccoralo, Lauren; Ripp, Jonathan; Pietrzak, Robert H",J. clin. psychiatr,551,24

Existing approaches for learning representations in this domain handle such issues by either aggregation or imputation of values, which in-turn suppresses the fine-grained information and adds undesirable noise/overhead into the machine learning model. To tackle this challenge, we propose STraTS (Self-supervised Transformer for TimeSeries) model which bypasses these pitfalls by treating time-series as a set of observation triplets instead of using the traditional dense matrix representation. It employs a novel Continuous Value Embedding (CVE) technique to encode continuous time and variable values without the need for discretization. It is composed of a Transformer component with Multi-head attention layers which enables it to learn contextual triplet embeddings while avoiding problems of recurrence and vanishing gradients that occur in recurrent architectures. Many healthcare datasets also suffer from the limited availability of labeled data. Our model utilizes self-supervision by leveraging unlabeled data to learn better representations by performing time-series forecasting as a self-supervision task. Experiments on real-world multivariate clinical time-series benchmark datasets show that STraTS shows better prediction performance than state-of-the-art methods for mortality prediction, especially when labeled data is limited. Finally, we also present an interpretable version of STraTS which can identify important measurements in the time-series data.","Tipirneni, Sindhu; Reddy, Chandan K.",,551,20

The primary aim of this retrospective study is to analyze weight loss outcome after revision of failed LGCP into laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG). Patients and Methods: Patients who experienced failure (insufficient weight loss/weight regain) after LGCP performed in our center from 2009 to 2012 were included. LSG was performed for all patients. Results: Among 127 who underwent LGCP, 42 patients (33%) underwent revision. Mean body mass index (BMI) at time of LGCP was 44 ± 6 kg/m2. The highest % total weight loss (%TWL) after LGCP ranged from 11% to 34% (24.1 ± 5) (corresponding to % excess weight loss [%EWL] of 12%-47% [33.5 ± 12]). The time interval between LGCP and LSG ranged from 12 to 25 months (15.4 ± 3.8). After conversion, 2 patients (5%) experienced acute leakage managed by endoscopic stenting. After LSG, mean BMI (kg/m2) was 38, 32, 30, 28, 29, 30.2, and 30.4, while mean %TWL reached 9%, 19%, 24%, 29%, 25%, 25%, and 24% and mean %EWL reached 15%, 51%, 69%, 77%, 68%, 66%, and 64% at 1 month, 6 months, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years, respectively. Except for results at 1 month, all results showed statistical significance (P &#8804; .05). After LSG, the incidence of diabetes mellitus and hypertension dropped from 15 (35%) and 13 (30%) to 2 (5%) and 3 (7%) patients, respectively. No follow-up data (0%) were missed.

What are the perceptions formed during the period? And what are the challenges and opportunities? Design/methodology/approach: This is an interpretivist qualitative study informed by disaster management theories The study involved the content analysis of existing literature with a focus on COVID-19 and higher education, particularly LISE, in conjunction with an open-ended email questionnaire that was sent to selected LIS educators/faculty/staff from major LIS Schools from eight sub-Saharan African countries The author used personal experiences and observation to supplement the data and the interpretation Findings: Results show more similarities than differences in how the COVID-19 pandemic is experienced and perceived, as well as the challenges and opportunities that it brings to the sector As a whole, political factors are most pronounced, meaning that administration and decision-making need more attention in the sector Also notable is that opportunities are mostly linked to technological factors, which will determine the “new normal” for LISE in the future Almost all the narratives focused on the middle level of (during) the disaster life cycle, which is understandable as the complete cycle of the disaster is yet to come, likely when COVID-19 ceases to be a threat Research limitations/implications: The sample was small, as related studies focus more on COVID-19 and higher education, with hardly any focusing on LISE The COVID-19 pandemic has not ended, so the disaster management life cycle cannot be fully exploited Furthermore, the author’s categorization of responses within PEST was largely judgmental Practical implications: New research, teaching and learning developmental paths have been created for LISE The study provides practical reflection on the effects of COVID-19 on the sector and HEIs that can inform discourse and responses to the pandemic Originality/value: The study explores a new research domain in LISE and due to limited research in the domain brings together important voices/narratives – based on their experiences – of LIS educators in Africa on the research area Further, it proposes the future of LISE under COVID-19 within the 4IR framework © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited","Ocholla, D.

Diagnostic laboratories are expected to provide appropriate testing with maximum accuracy. Real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) is the diagnostic standard. However, only a handful of studies have reviewed their performance in clinical settings. The aim of this study was to compare the performance of the overall analytical matrix including the extraction kit (BD MAX, Promega, Qiagen), the PCR instrument (Agilent Mx3005 P, BD MAX, Qiagen Rotor-Gene, Roche Cobas z 480) and the RT-PCR assay (Altona Diagnostics, CerTest Biotec, R-Biopharm AG) using predefined samples from proficiency testing organizers. The greatest difference of the cycle threshold values between the matrices was nine cycles. One borderline sample could not be detected by three out of twelve analytical matrices and yielded a false negative result. We therefore conclude that diagnostic laboratories should take the complete analytical matrix in addition to the performance values published by the manufacturer for a respective RT-PCR kit into account. With limited resources laboratories have to validate a wide range of kits to determine appropriate analytical matrices for detecting SARS-CoV-2 reliably. The interpretation of clinical results has to be adapted accordingly.","Malecki, Monika; Luesebrink, Jessica; Wendel, Andreas F; Mattner, Frauke",J Virol Methods,551,16

Notably, ACE2 is also expressed in the cardiovascular system and there are multiple cardiovascular implications of COVID-19. Cardiovascular risk factors and cardiovascular disease have been associated with severe manifestations and poor prognosis in patients with COVID-19. Importantly, patients with COVID-19 may have thrombotic and coagulation abnormalities promoting a hypercoagulable state, resulting in an increased rate of thrombotic and thromboembolic events.

However, little is known about a serious health-risk-behavior named ""food and alcohol disturbance"" (FAD), characterized by engaging in dysfunctional eating on days of planned alcohol consumption. The aim of the present study was to investigate potential factors that may have put young adults at risk or protected against FAD during the COVID-19 lockdown. METHODS: A sample of 447 young adults (280 females, 167 males; range 18-26) completed an online survey during the country's nationwide lockdown composed of self-reported measures assessing FAD behaviors, alcohol consumption, compensatory behaviors, eating and weight concerns, social support, emotion regulation strategies, and living arrangement. RESULTS: Our findings showed that FAD was significantly and positively correlated to alcohol consumption, use of laxatives, self-induced vomiting, eating and weight concerns, and expressive suppression, and negatively correlated to social support and living with family. Hierarchical regression analysis revealed that alcohol consumption, eating concern, and expression suppression positively predicted FAD, while social support and living with family were negative predictors. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that during the COVID-19 lockdown, preoccupation with eating and the use of expressive suppression may have increased vulnerability to FAD; conversely, perceived social support and living with family may have been a source of protection against this dysfunctional behavior.

TRIAL DESIGN: A two-arm (1:1 ratio) cluster randomised controlled trial implementing Germ Defence via GP practices compared with usual care. PARTICIPANTS: Setting: All Primary care GP practices in England. PARTICIPANTS: All patients aged 16 years and over who were granted access by participating GP practices. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Intervention: We will ask staff at GP practices randomised to the intervention arm to share the weblink to Germ Defence with all adult patients registered at their practice during the 4-month trial implementation period and care will otherwise follow current standard management. Germ Defence is an interactive website ( http://GermDefence.org/ ) employing behaviour change techniques and practical advice on how to reduce the spread of infection in the home. The coronavirus version of Germ Defence helps people understand what measures to take and when to take them to avoid infection. This includes hand washing, avoiding sharing rooms and surfaces, dealing with deliveries and ventilating rooms. Using behaviour change techniques, it helps users think through and adopt better home hygiene habits and find ways to solve any barriers, providing personalised goal setting and tailored advice that fits users' personal circumstances and problem solving to overcome barriers. Comparator: Patients at GP practices randomised to the usual care arm will receive current standard management for the 4-month trial period after which we will ask staff to share the link to Germ Defence with all adult patients registered at their practice. MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary outcome is the effects of implementing Germ Defence on prevalence of all respiratory tract infection diagnoses during the 4-month trial implementation period. The secondary outcomes are: 1) incidence of COVID-19 diagnoses 2) incidence of COVID-19 symptom presentation 3) incidence of gastrointestinal infections 4) number of primary care consultations 5) antibiotic usage 6) hospital admissions 7) uptake of GP practices disseminating Germ Defence to their patients 8) usage of the Germ Defence website by individuals who were granted access by their GP practice RANDOMISATION: GP practices will be randomised on a 1:1 basis by the independent Bristol Randomised Trials Collaboration (BRTC). Clinical Commission Groups (CCGs) in England will be divided into blocks according to region, and equal numbers in each block will be randomly allocated to intervention or usual care. The randomisation schedule will be generated in Stata statistical software by a statistician not otherwise involved in the enrolment of general practices into the study. BLINDING (MASKING): The principal investigators, the statistician and study collaborators will remain blinded from the identity of randomised practices until the end of the study. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): To detect planned effect size (based on PRIMIT trial, Little et al, 2015): 11.1 million respondents from 6822 active GP practices. Assuming 25% of these GP practices will engage, we will contact all GP practices in England spread across 135 Clinical Commissioning Groups. TRIAL STATUS: Protocol version 2.0, dated 13 January 2021.

In this hypothesis we highlight the CPExo instead of convalescent plasma (CP), perhaps to dispense of exosomes are gratified and it's more effectively acquired immune response conferral through antibodies. COVID-19 convalescent plasma has billions of exosomes and it has aptitudes to carry molecular constituents like proteins, lipids, RNA and DNA, etc. Moreover, exosomes are capable of recognizing antigens with adequate sensitivity and specificity. Many of these derivatives could trigger an immune modulation into the cells and act as an epigenetic inheritor response to target pathogens through RNAs. COIVID-19 resistance activated plasma-derived exosomes are either responsible for the effects of plasma beyond the contained immune antibodies or could be inhibitory. The proposed hypothesis suggests that preselecting the plasma-derived antibodies and RNAs merged exosomes would be an optimized therapeutic tactic for COVID-19 patients.

This paper deals with the transmission mechanism by some affected parameters in the problem. The said study is carried out by the consideration of a fractional-order epidemic model describing the dynamics of COVID-19 under a non-singular kernel type of derivative. The concerned model examine via non-singular fractional-order derivative known as Atangana-Baleanu derivative in Caputo sense (ABC). The problem analyzes for qualitative analysis and determines at least one solution by applying the approach of fixed point theory. The uniqueness of the solution is derived by the Banach contraction theorem. For iterative solution, the technique of iterative fractional-order Adams-Bashforth scheme is applied. Numerical simulation for the proposed scheme is performed at various fractional-order lying between 0, 1 and for integer-order 1. We also compare the compartmental quantities of the said model at two different effective contact rates of β. All the compartments show convergence and stability with growing time. The simulation of the iterative techniques is also compared with the Laplace Adomian decomposition method (LADM). Good comparative results for the whole density have been achieved by different fractional orders and obtain the stability faster at the low fractional orders while slowly at higher-order.","Alzaid, Sara Salem T.

Rapid detection is crucial to reduce their spread and prevent infections and outbreaks. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate a lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) (called NG-Test VanA) for the rapid and reliable detection of VanA-producing VRE (VanA-VRE) from colonies and broth. METHODS: NG-Test VanA was validated on 135 well-characterized enterococcal isolates grown on Mueller-Hinton (MH) agar (including 40 VanA-VRE). Different agar plates and culture broths widely used in routine laboratories for culture of enterococci were tested. RESULTS: All 40 VanA-VRE clinical isolates were correctly detected in less than 15 min irrespective of the species expressing the VanA ligase and the medium used for bacterial growth. No cross-reaction was observed with any other clinically relevant ligases (VanB, C1, C2, D, E, G, L, M and N). Overall, the sensitivity and specificity of the assay were 100% for VanA-VRE grown on MH agar plates. NG-Test VanA accurately detects VanA-VRE irrespective of the culture medium (agar and broth). Band intensity was increased when using bacteria grown on vancomycin-containing culture media or on MH close to the vancomycin disc as a consequence of VanA induction. The limit of detection of the assay was 6.3â×â106 cfu per test with bacteria grown on MH plates and 4.9â×â105 cfu per test with bacteria grown on ChromID® VRE plates. CONCLUSIONS: NG-Test VanA is efficient, rapid and easy to implement in the routine workflow of a clinical microbiology laboratory for the confirmation of VanA-VRE.","Oueslati, Saoussen; Volland, Hervé; Cattoir, Vincent; Bernabeu, Sandrine; Girlich, Delphine; Dulac, Ducan; Plaisance, Marc; Laroche, Maxime; Dortet, Laurent; Simon, Stéphanie; Naas, Thierry",J Antimicrob Chemother,551,24

369162,369162,369162,Nutritional Support in Coronavirus 2019 Disease,16.13714,9.43276,2020,"BACKGROUND: Currently, the identification of infectious disease re-emergence is performed without describing specific quantitative criteria that can be used to identify re-emergence events consistently. This practice may lead to ineffective mitigation. In addition, identification of factors contributing to local disease re-emergence and assessment of global disease re-emergence require access to data about disease incidence and a large number of factors at the local level for the entire world. This paper presents Re-emerging Disease Alert (RED Alert), a web-based tool designed to help public health officials detect and understand infectious disease re-emergence. OBJECTIVE: Our objective is to bring together a variety of disease-related data and analytics needed to help public health analysts answer the following 3 primary questions for detecting and understanding disease re-emergence: Is there a potential disease re-emergence at the local (country) level? What are the potential contributing factors for this re-emergence? Is there a potential for global re-emergence? METHODS: We collected and cleaned disease-related data (eg, case counts, vaccination rates, and indicators related to disease transmission) from several data sources including the World Health Organization (WHO), Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), World Bank, and Gideon. We combined these data with machine learning and visual analytics into a tool called RED Alert to detect re-emergence for the following 4 diseases: measles, cholera, dengue, and yellow fever. We evaluated the performance of the machine learning models for re-emergence detection and reviewed the output of the tool through a number of case studies. RESULTS: Our supervised learning models were able to identify 82%-90% of the local re-emergence events, although with 18%-31% (except 46% for dengue) false positives. This is consistent with our goal of identifying all possible re-emergences while allowing some false positives. The review of the web-based tool through case studies showed that local re-emergence detection was possible and that the tool provided actionable information about potential factors contributing to the local disease re-emergence and trends in global disease re-emergence. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first tool that focuses specifically on disease re-emergence and addresses the important challenges mentioned above.","Parikh, Nidhi; Daughton, Ashlynn R; Rosenberger, William Earl; Aberle, Derek Jacob; Chitanvis, Maneesha Elizabeth; Altherr, Forest Michael; Velappan, Nileena; Fairchild, Geoffrey; Deshpande, Alina",JMIR Public Health Surveill,551,20

We hypothesized that endothelial damage may lead to substantially increased concentrations of von Willebrand factor with subsequent relative deficiency of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13 (ADAMTS13). DESIGN: Prospective controlled cross-over trial. SETTING: Blood samples of patients with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 and healthy controls were obtained in three German hospitals and analyzed in a German hemostaseologic laboratory. PATIENTS: Seventy-five patients with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 of mild to critical severity and 30 healthy controls. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: von Willebrand factor antigen, ADAMTS13, and von Willebrand factor multimer formation were analyzed. von Willebrand factor antigen was 4.1 times higher in COVID-19 patients compared with healthy controls (p < 0.0001), whereas ADAMTS13 activities were not significantly different (p = 0.18). The ADAMTS13/von Willebrand factor antigen ratio was significantly lower in COVID-19 than in the control group (24.4 ± 20.5 vs 82.0 ± 30.7; p < 0.0001). Fourteen patients (18.7%) undercut a critical ratio of 10 as described in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Gel analysis of multimers resembled a thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura pattern with loss of the largest multimers in 75% and a smeary triplet pattern in 39% of the patients. The ADAMTS13/von Willebrand factor antigen ratio decreased continuously from mild to critical disease (analysis of variance p = 0.026). Furthermore, it differed significantly between surviving patients and those who died from COVID-19 (p = 0.001) yielding an area under the curve of 0.232 in receiver operating characteristic curve curve analysis. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 is associated with a substantial increase in von Willebrand factor levels, which can exceed the ADAMTS13 processing capacity resulting in the formation of large von Willebrand factor multimers indistinguishable from thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. The ADAMTS13/von Willebrand factor antigen ratio is an independent predictor of severity of disease and mortality. These findings provide a rationale to consider plasma exchange as a therapeutic option in COVID-19 and to include von Willebrand factor and ADAMTS13 in the diagnostic workup.","Doevelaar, Adrian A N; Bachmann, Martin; Hölzer, Bodo; Seibert, Felix S; Rohn, Benjamin J; Bauer, Frederic; Witzke, Oliver; Dittmer, Ulf; Bachmann, Michael; Yilmaz, Serap; Dittmer, Rita; Schneppenheim, Sonja; Babel, Nina; Budde, Ulrich; Westhoff, Timm H",Crit Care Med,551,24

The Mediterranean diet (MedDiet), Okinawa diet (OkD) and Nordic diet, derived from very different regions of the world and culinary traditions, have a large whole plant food component and are associated with reduced disease risk. This review focuses on polyphenolâ:âmicrobiome interactions as one possible common mechanistic driver linking the protective effects whole plant foods against metabolic disease across healthy dietary patterns irrespective of geography. RECENT FINDINGS: Although mechanistic evidence in humans is still scarce, animal studies suggest that polyphenol or polyphenol rich foods induce changes within the gut microbiota and its metabolic output of trimethylamine N-oxide, short-chain fatty acids, bile acids and small phenolic acids. These cross-kingdom signaling molecules regulate mammalian lipid and glucose homeostasis, inflammation and energy storage or thermogenesis, physiological processes determining obesity-related metabolic and cardiovascular disease risk. However, it appears that where in the intestine metabolites are produced, the microbiota communities involved, and interactions between the metabolites themselves, can all influence physiological responses, highlighting the need for a greater understanding of the kinetics and site of production of microbial metabolites within the gut. SUMMARY: Interactions between polyphenols and metabolites produced by the gut microbiota are emerging as a possible unifying protective mechanism underpinning diverse healthy dietary patterns signaling across culinary traditions, across geography and across domains of life.","Diotallevi, Camilla; Fava, Francesca; Gobbetti, Marco; Tuohy, Kieran",Curr Opin Clin Nutr Metab Care,551,8

To support HCWs, the Center for Pediatric Traumatic Stress created the Toolkit for Emotional Coping for Healthcare Staff (TECHS), a free, online, evidence-supported program. TECHS offers self-assessment tools for traumatic stress reactions and three coping tools that are rooted in cognitive behavioral and family therapy principles. TECHS, which comes in the form of a slide set and a pre-recorded webinar, can be implemented flexibly (e.g., small or large groups, individually, one one-hour administration or multiple shorter sections of time). Ideally, small groups of HCWs engage in TECHS together to help support team resilience. In implementing TECHS in a group, it is important to ensure participation is optional and to review expectations for confidentiality. The purpose of TECHS is to address the emotional needs of HCWs related to the pandemic and to offer a long overdue evidence-informed program that addresses the fourth aim of healthcare, improving the work life of HCWs. Sustaining emotional support programs such as TECHS is critical to maintain a functioning, effective, and healthy workforce across our healthcare institutions. © 2020, Delaware Academy of Medicine.

While capitalism demands constant growth, acceleration and efficiency, the outbreak urges societies to reduce, slow down and be patient. This article provides a sociological comment on the pandemic that focuses on the role of time and temporality. It explores the multiple ways in which the required responses to Covid-19 are at odds with the temporal order of capitalism. In the midst of crisis, the specific features, contradictions and weaknesses of the time regime governing modern societies become even more apparent ? and make sociological scrutiny more necessary than ever. While this comment relates to the insights provided by the sociology of time, it uses a children?s book to illustrate its argument. Drawing on Michael Ende?s story of the orphan girl Momo and the grey gentlemen who steal people?s time, I recapture the main features of capitalism as a time regime: measurement and commodification of time, temporal expansion, acceleration, appropriation of the future, and unequal temporal autonomy. The current pandemic challenges both individual and collective temporalities that are governed by these temporal imperatives of capitalism. I conclude with reflections on the feasibility of a more sustainable temporal order that Michael Ende?s novel hints at and suggest how sociological research could support such an endeavour in the current crisis.","Suckert, Lisa",The Sociological Review,551,23

OBJECTIVE: To assess the nurse-patient ratio required by COVID-19 patients and to identify the factors that influence nursing in this context. DESIGN: This study was a retrospective observational study that evaluated the ratio using the Nursing Activities Score (NAS). SETTING: Three Belgian French-speaking hospitals, including five ICUs. Patients included COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The study included 95 COVID-19 patients and 1604 non-COVID-19 patients (control group) resulting in 905 and 5453 NAS measures, respectively. The NAS was significantly higher among the COVID-19 patients than in the control group (p = <0.0001). In the COVID-19 group, these higher scores were also observed per shift and uniformly across the three hospitals. COVID-19 patients required more time in the activities of monitoring and titration (&#967;2 = 457.60, p = <0.0001), mobilisation (&#967;2 = 161.21, p = <0.0001), and hygiene (&#967;2 = 557.77, p = <0.0001). Factors influencing nursing time measured by NAS in the COVID-19 patients were age <65 years old (p = 0.23), the use of continuous venovenous hemofiltration (p = 0.002), a high APACHE II score (p = 0.006) and patient death (p = 0.002). A COVID-19 diagnosis was independently associated with an increase in nursing time (OR = 4.8, 95% CI:3.6-6.4). CONCLUSIONS: Patients hospitalised in the ICU due to COVID-19 require significantly more nursing time and need an average ratio of almost 1:1.","Bruyneel, Arnaud; Gallani, Maria-Cécillia; Tack, Jérôme; d039,; Hondt, Alain; Canipel, Sebastien; Franck, Stéphane; Reper, Pascal; Pirson, Magali",Intensive Crit Care Nurs,551,1

WHO then announced the condition as a pandemic that quickly spread throughout the world. The rapid spread of Coronavirus Pandemic (COVID-19) also occurred in Indonesia, as well as in West Kalimantan. In a spatial-temporal perspective, the spread of infectious diseases can be supported by the interconnectivity or interaction between areas, populations, and transportation facilities that facilitate community mobility. This research aims to describe the interactions between regions in West Kalimantan and the relation to the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. The method used centrality measurement and cluster analysis, where the results of these calculations are then described in line with the distribution of the COVID-19 case in West Kalimantan. From the justification, areas with high centrality in the network configuration tend to have the most confirmed cases compared to other areas. The character of these areas tends to be the main entrance (air/port), the provincial capital, and the hub area in West Kalimantan, which is also included as the same cluster. Another interesting finding is that areas with low centrality, and included in the same cluster, have a number of people under surveillance which is quite large compared to the previous cluster. These areas tend to have a dense population and are directly related to the Provincial Capital and neighboring countries (border).","Muazir, Syaiful; Lestari, Lestari; Alhamdani, Muhammad Ridha; Nurhamsyah, Muhammad; id,",Jurnal Wilayah Dan Lingkungan,551,10

Aim: This systematic review summarizes the current scientific evidence regarding the clinical presentation of COVID-19 in hospitalized children based on available case series from China. In addition, first data from a nationwide pediatric hospital survey conducted by the German Society for Pediatric Infectious Diseases (DGPI) are presented. Methods: This study evaluated 12 case series from China with 6-2143 children infected with SARS-CoV­2, which were identified by a literature search in PubMed up to 31 March 2020. The database of the German nationwide DGPI COVID-19 survey was accessed on 6 April 2020. Results: The median patient age in the case series was between 2 and 7 years and 18-45% were infants <1 year of age. The duration of hospital stay was 5-20 days. Most commonly reported symptoms were fever and cough; in 40-100% of cases involvement of the lower respiratory tract was reported, usually confirmed by computed tomography (CT). Severe and critical courses of disease were reported in up to 8% of the children including 2 fatalities. So far the German DGPI COVID-19 survey reported 33 hospitalized children up to 6 April 2020, mostly with upper airway infections. Of these children, 45% were infants and 32% had an underlying medical condition. So far 3 children (9%) needed admission to an intensive care unit. Conclusion: COVID-19 in hospitalized children usually presented as an uncomplicated febrile upper airway infection or mild pneumonia. Severe cases or fatalities rarely occurred in children. Information on neonates and children with underlying chronic conditions as well as on therapeutic and preventive measures are urgently needed.","Streng, A; Hartmann, K; Armann, J; Berner, R; Liese, J G",Monatsschr Kinderheilkd,551,22

Second, it proposes a set-point adaptation algorithm that uses sensor measurements of a flow meter to automatically adapt the controller to the setup at hand. Third, it experimentally shows that such an adaptive solution improves the performance of the ventilator for various setups. One objective of this paper is to increase awareness of the need for feedback control using sensor measurements in low-cost ventilator solutions in order to automatically adapt to the specific scenario.","Hewing, Lukas; Menner, Marcel; Tachatos, Nikolaos; Daners, Marianne Schmid; Pasquier, Cosima du; Lumpe, Thomas S.; Shea, Kristina; Carron, Andrea; Zeilinger, Melanie N.",,551,22

METHODS: We developed a compartment queue model to describe the process from case confirmation, home-based isolation, hospitalization, ICU, recovery, and death. By using public assessed data in Lombardy, Italy, we estimated two congestion indices for isolation wards and ICU. The excess ICU needs were estimated in Lombardy, Italy, and other countries when data were available, including France, Spain, Belgium, New York State in the USA, South Korea, and Japan. RESULTS: In Lombardy, Italy, the congestion of isolation beds had increased from 2.2 to the peak of 6.0 in March and started to decline to 3.9 as of 9th May, whereas the demand for ICU during the same period has not decreased yet with an increasing trend from 2.9 to 8.0. The results showed the unmet ICU need from the second week in March as of 9th May. The same situation was shown in France, Spain, Belgium, and New York State, USA but not for South Korea and Japan. The results with data until December 2020 for Lombardy, Italy were also estimated to reflect the demand for hospitalization and ICU after the occurrence of viral variants.

Although we observe considerable noise in the data and initial volatility in the use of the different reporting mechanisms, the self-reported syndromic data exhibits a strong association with lab-confirmed cases at a local scale. Moreover, the syndromic data also suggests an earlier spread of the outbreak across Bangladesh than is evident from the confirmed case counts, consistent with predicted spread of the outbreak based on population mobility data.

This represents genetic signatures of coronaviruses that are related to bat-to-human transmission. To further trace the early human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in North America, a geographically stratified genome-wide association study (North American isolates and the remaining isolates) and a retrospective study were conducted. We determined that the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) 1,059.C > T and 25,563.G > T were significantly associated with approximately half of the North American SARS-CoV-2 isolates that accumulated largely during March 2020. Retrospectively tracing isolates with these two SNPs was used to reconstruct the early, reliable transmission history of North American SARS-CoV-2, and European isolates (February 26, 2020) showed transmission 3 days earlier than North American isolates and 17 days earlier than Asian isolates.

METHODS: Retrospective, single-center study enrolling all patients who underwent vitrectomy for RRD between June 2015 and June 2018. After core vitrectomy and the necessary additional procedures, endodiathermy was activated near the edge of the peripheral vitreous. This created a heat-induced bubble stream and the bubbles were entangled in the vitreous base and anterior hyaloid. As a result, the vitreous base and anterior hyaloid were visualized and removed. RESULTS: Between June 2015 and June 2018, a total of 210 cases of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment were treated with vitrectomy. Endodiathermy assisted vitreous base shaving and anterior hyaloid removal was used in those cases with a very low incidence of iatrogenic peripheral retinal breaks during vitreous base shaving (2%), and with no case of lens injury related to the technique. We achieved a final anatomical success of 95.2% in the study period after mean number of operations of 1.3 ± 0.2.

Beta-adrenergic blockers may decrease the SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry by decreasing ACE2 receptors expression and cluster of differentiation 147 (CD147) in various cells in the body. Beta-adrenergic blockers may decrease the morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 patients by preventing or reducing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and other complications. Retrospective and prospective clinical trials should be conducted to check the validity of the hypothesis.

States of mindfulness and being in the moment can prevent anxiety and fear associated with the lockdown and alleviate ruminative and automatic negative thinking. This longitudinal study investigated the role of mindfulness before and during the COVID-19 lockdown in protecting a sample of emerging adults from experiencing cognitive failures, intrusive thoughts and rumination and examined how lockdown-related variables-emotions, socio-economic status and housing conditions-influenced this mindfulness profile. The results showed overall more cognitive failures and rumination during lockdown, especially in participants whose mindfulness status diminished. However, these signs of cognitive distress remained stable or decreased among participants who reported improved changes in mindfulness. Financial difficulties and a reduced sense of privacy associated with the lockdown predicted lower stability in mindfulness profiles. The state of being fully aware of what is happening in the present moment may be helpful in reducing cognitive discomfort and psychological maladjustment, especially during stressful times such as lockdowns.","Lopez, Antonella; Caffò, Alessandro Oronzo; Tinella, Luigi; Di Masi, Manuela Nicoletta; Bosco, Andrea",Applied psychology.

In addition, it is also suggested that dysregulations related to Ca2+signaling could link these diseases, in addition to 3'-5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) signaling pathways. Thus, revealing this interplay between diabetes and inflammatory diseases may provide novel insights into the pathogenesis of these diseases. Publications involving signaling pathways related to Ca2+ and cAMP, inflammation, diabetes, dementia, cancer, and hypertension (alone or combined) were collected by searching PubMed and EMBASE. Both signaling pathways, Ca2+ and cAMP signaling, control the release of neurotransmitters and hormones, in addition to neurodegeneration, and tumor growth. Furthermore, there is a clear relationship between Ca2+ signaling, e.g., increased Ca2+ signals, and inflammatory responses. cAMP also regulates pro- and anti-inflammatory responses. Due to the experience of our group in this field, this article discusses the role of Ca2+ and cAMP signaling in the correlation between diabetes and inflammatory diseases, including its pharmacological implications. As a novelty, this article also includes: (1) A timeline of the major events in Ca2+/cAMP signaling;and (2) As coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging and rapidly evolving situation, this article also discusses recent reports on the role of Ca2+ channel blockers for preventing Ca2+ signaling disruption due to COVID-19, including the correlation between COVID-19 and diabetes.","Bergantin, L.

Here, we identified six SARS-CoV RBD-specific neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (nAbs) that cross-reacted with SARS-CoV-2 RBD, two of which, 18F3 and 7B11, neutralized SARS-CoV-2 infection. 18F3 recognized conserved epitopes on SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 RBDs, whereas 7B11 recognized epitopes on SARS-CoV RBD not fully conserved in SARS-CoV-2 RBD. The 18F3-recognizing epitopes on RBD did not overlap with the ACE2-binding sites, whereas those recognized by 7B11 were close to the ACE2-binding sites, explaining why 7B11 could, but 18F3 could not, block SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 RBD binding to ACE2 receptor.

In the absence of neither an effective treatment or vaccine and with an incomplete understanding of the epidemiological cycle, predictive mathematical models can help exploring of both COVID-19 transmission and control. In this present study, we consider a new mathematical model on COVID-19 transmission that incorporate lock-down effect and variability in transmission between symptomatic and asymptomatic populations with former being a fast spreader of the disease. Using daily COVID-19 notified cases from three states (Maharashtra, Delhi, and Telangana) and overall India, we assess the effect of current 21 days lock-down in terms of reduction cases and deaths. Lock-down effect is studied with different lock-down success rate. Our result suggest that 21 days lock-down will have no impact in Maharashtra and overall India. Furthermore, the presence of a higher percentage of COVID-19 super-spreaders will further deteriorate the situation in Maharashtra. However, for Tamil Nadu and Delhi there is some ray of hope as our prediction shows that lock-down will reduce a significant number of cases and deaths. in these two locations. Further extension of lock-down may place Delhi and Tamil Nadu in a comfort zone. Comparing estimated parameter samples for the mentioned four locations, we find a correlation between effect of lockdown and percentage of symptomatic infected in a region. Our result suggests that a higher percentage of symptomatic infected in a region leads to a large number of reduction in notified cases and deaths due to different lock-down scenario.

It was suggested that the COVID-19 pandemic may have impacted on attendances for reduced fetal movements. Thus, we sought to ascertain the impact of the pandemic on attendances for reduced fetal movements (RFM) in our unit, ultrasound provision for reduced fetal movements, and the stillbirth rate. METHODS: This was a single site retrospective cohort study involving all women complaining of a 1st episode of reduced fetal movements between 01/03/2020-30/04/2020 (COVID) to 01/03/2019-30/04/2019 (Pre-COVID). Data were retrieved from computerised hospital records and statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism and SPSS. RESULTS: 22% (179/810) of women presented with a 1st episode of reduced fetal movements Pre-COVID compared to 18% (145/803) during COVID (p = 0.047). Primiparous women were significantly over-represented in this population with a 1.4-fold increase in attendances during COVID (67% vs 48%, p = 0.0005).

Two important determinants of variant spread are how frequently they arise within individuals and how likely they are to be transmitted. To characterize within-host diversity and transmission, we deep-sequenced 1313 clinical samples from the United Kingdom. SARS-CoV-2 infections are characterized by low levels of within-host diversity when viral loads are high and by a narrow bottleneck at transmission. Most variants are either lost or occasionally fixed at the point of transmission, with minimal persistence of shared diversity, patterns that are readily observable on the phylogenetic tree. Our results suggest that transmission-enhancing and/or immune-escape SARS-CoV-2 variants are likely to arise infrequently but could spread rapidly if successfully transmitted.","Lythgoe, Katrina A; Hall, Matthew; Ferretti, Luca; de Cesare, Mariateresa; MacIntyre-Cockett, George; Trebes, Amy; Andersson, Monique; Otecko, Newton; Wise, Emma L; Moore, Nathan; Lynch, Jessica; Kidd, Stephen; Cortes, Nicholas; Mori, Matilde; Williams, Rebecca; Vernet, Gabrielle; Justice, Anita; Green, Angie; Nicholls, Samuel M; Ansari, M Azim; Abeler-Dörner, Lucie; Moore, Catrin E; Peto, Timothy E A; Eyre, David W; Shaw, Robert; Simmonds, Peter; Buck, David; Todd, John A; Connor, Thomas R; Ashraf, Shirin; da Silva Filipe, Ana; Shepherd, James; Thomson, Emma C; Bonsall, David; Fraser, Christophe; Golubchik, Tanya","Sci.

Célkituzés: Az elso veszélyhelyzeti periódus második felében, 2020. április 22. és 2020. május 5. között mértük fel az epilepsziaellátásban részt vevo orvosok véleményét, hogy milyen mértékben változott a betegek ellátása, és hogyan élték meg a változásokat személyesen. Módszer: Internetes kérdoíves véleményfelmérés történt, a Magyar Epilepszia Liga 2020. április 16-17-re tervezett, de a COVID-19-járvány miatt elhalasztott XV. kongresszusára regisztrált neurológusok között. Kilenc egyszeres vagy többszörös feleletválasztós kérdés és 'szabad kommentár' mezok álltak rendelkezésre. Eredmények: A megkeresett 116 neurológus közül 33-an válaszoltak (28%), összesen 30 kommentár került rögzítésre. 73%-uk szerint a változások komoly nehézséget okoztak, 15%-uk gondolta, hogy ennek súlyos következményei lesznek. Új betegek fogadása 53%-ban leállt, 25%-ban nagy nehézségekbe ütközött. A gondozott betegek problémáit 49%-ban a távvizit lehetoségeivel élve meg tudták oldani, de 24%-ban ez nem sikerült. A beteg távollétében lebonyolított vizitek 68%-a dokumentált telefonbeszélgetések formájában zajlott. Az orvosok kétharmada veszélyeztetve érezte magát, hogy elkapja a vírust, ebbol 40% úgy érezte, nem kap elegendo védelmet, 6% (2 fo) kapta el a fertozést. Következtetés: A COVID-19-járvány a leginkább az új szakvélemények kiadását érintette, de a gondozási feladatokat sem mindig lehetett megfeleloen megoldani. A károkat jelentosen enyhítette az ellátószemélyzet rugalmassága. A telefonvizitek, szükség esetén, az epileptológiában pótolhatják a személyes orvos-beteg találkozásokat. A járvány visszatérésének veszélye miatt a távvizit-alkalmazások technikai fejlesztése és ezek dokumentálási kérdéseinek megoldása fontos.

INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 pandemic has transformed the operation of outpatient care worldwide for months. The new framework was set in Hungary by the health emergency regulations that existed from 11. 03. 2020 to 17. 06. 2020. OBJECTIVE: In the second half of the emergency period, between 22. 04. 2020 and 05. 05. 2020, we surveyed the opinion of physicians involved in epilepsy care about the extent to which patient care had changed and how they experienced the changes in person. METHOD: An internet questionnaire survey was conducted among neurologists registered for the annual congress of the Hungarian Chapter of the International League Against Epilepsy. Nine single- or multiple-choice questions and 'free comment' fields were available. RESULTS: Of 116 neurologists contacted, 33 responded (28%), and a total of 30 comments were recorded. 73% said the changes caused a serious difficulty, 15% thought it would have serious consequences. Reception of new patients was stopped in 53%, and 25% encountered great difficulties. In 49%, the problems of the cared patients could be solved using remote visits, but 24% could not solve them properly. 68% of outpatient visits took the form of documented telephone conversations. Two-thirds of doctors feared catching the virus, 40% of whom felt they were not getting enough protection. 6% caught the infection. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has mostly affected the issuance of new expert opinions, but care tasks have not always been adequately addressed. The damage was significantly mitigated by the flexibility of the care staff. Telephone visits, if necessary, can replace personal doctor-patient encounters in epileptology. The technical development of remote visit applications and their documentation issues are important. During the pandemic period, great care must be taken to protect staff in order to avoid infection and increase the sense of safety of doctors.

This paper revisited the collective efforts invested in PHEOC conceptualization and development, identified the opportunities and challenges in compliance with standards and framework, demonstrated the accountability of PHEOC network, thereby promoted best practice guidance for global public health emergency preparedness and response. This review will help navigate emergency response complexities leveraging PHEOC partnerships and advance the ability to detect and respond to public health emergencies in low resource settings. The review shows that the information on how to adapt best practice guidance to local circumstances could incentivize the full implementation of prevention, early detection and response to outbreaks. Identifying and correcting deficiencies in effectiveness evaluation will provide the basis for continuous PHEOC improvement. With the gradually reopening economies and public services in some countries, there is an urgent need to emphasize and validate the collective efforts undertaken by PHEOCs for tackling the COVID-19 pandemic.","Ma, Jiyan; Huang, Yangmu; Zheng, Zhijie",,551,20

A Perspective of Personalized Medicine,16.12732,5.5622,2021,"This work investigates the estimation biases of remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) methods for pulse rate measurement across diverse demographics. Advances in photoplethysmography (PPG) and rPPG methods have enabled the development of contact and noncontact approaches for continuous monitoring and collection of patient health data. The contagious nature of viruses such as COVID-19 warrants noncontact methods for physiological signal estimation. However, these approaches are subject to estimation biases due to variations in environmental conditions and subject demographics. The performance of contact-based wearable sensors has been evaluated, using off-the-shelf devices across demographics. However, the measurement uncertainty of rPPG methods that estimate pulse rate has not been sufficiently tested across diverse demographic populations or environments. Quantifying the efficacy of rPPG methods in real-world conditions is critical in determining their potential viability as health monitoring solutions. Currently, publicly available face datasets accompanied by physiological measurements are typically captured in controlled laboratory settings, lacking diversity in subject skin tones, age, and cultural artifacts (e.g, bindi worn by Indian women). In this study, we collect pulse rate and facial video data from human subjects in India and Sierra Leone, in order to quantify the uncertainty in noncontact pulse rate estimation methods. The video data are used to estimate pulse rate using state-of-the-art rPPG camera-based methods, and compared against ground truth measurements captured using an FDA-approved contact-based pulse rate measurement device. Our study reveals that rPPG methods exhibit similar biases when compared with a contact-based device across demographic groups and environmental conditions. The mean difference between pulse rates measured by rPPG methods and the ground truth is found to be ~2% (1 beats per minute (b.p.m.)), signifying agreement of rPPG methods with the ground truth. We also find that rPPG methods show pulse rate variability of ~15% (11 b.p.m.), as compared to the ground truth. We investigate factors impacting rPPG methods and discuss solutions aimed at mitigating variance.","Dasari, A.; Prakash, S. K. A.; Jeni, L. A.; Tucker, C. S.",npj Digital Medicine,551,1

With much focus on secondary and acute care at this time, there has been less communication and understanding about the impact on primary care. This discussion paper is based on the experience of one of the authors working as a general practitioner/family doctor during the pandemic and rapid changes are described during this time (April 2020). Two important themes emerged from this experience focusing on the importance of supporting one another and new roles and ways of working. It can be argued that the challenges presented by COVID-19 have expedited positive and potentially sustainable change in UK primary care that has been needed for some time. The authors discuss the implications for future working and make a series of recommendations for primary care relating to the importance of supporting the workforce, remote consultations and communication, regular team meetings, and development of integrated care. It is suggested that many of the challenges highlighted can be addressed by placing a greater emphasis on the use of interprofessional education (IPE) to underpin and support effective collaborative working.","Gray, Richard; Sanders, Chris",J Interprof Care,551,24

In recent years, deep learning-based approaches have shown impressive performance in myriad image recognition tasks. However, they usually require a large number of annotated data for training. Inspired by Ground Glass Opacity (GGO), a common finding in COIVD-19 patient's CT scans, we proposed in this paper a novel self-supervised pretraining method based on pseudo lesions generation and restoration for COVID-19 diagnosis. We used Perlin noise, a gradient noise based mathematical model, to generate lesion-like patterns, which were then randomly pasted to the lung regions of normal CT images to generate pseudo COVID-19 images. The pairs of normal and pseudo COVID-19 images were then used to train an encoder-decoder architecture based U-Net for image restoration, which does not require any labelled data. The pretrained encoder was then fine-tuned using labelled data for COVID-19 diagnosis task. Two public COVID-19 diagnosis datasets made up of CT images were employed for evaluation. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrated that the proposed self-supervised learning approach could extract better feature representation for COVID-19 diagnosis and the accuracy of the proposed method outperformed the supervised model pretrained on large scale images by 6.57% and 3.03% on SARS-CoV-2 dataset and Jinan COVID-19 dataset, respectively.","Li, Zhongliang; Jin, Zhihao; Li, Xuechen; Shen, Linlin",,551,1

We propose two types of case-control studies that can be carried out jointly in test settings for symptomatic persons. The first, the test-negative case-control design (TND) is the easiest to implement; it only requires collecting information about potential risk factors for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) from the tested symptomatic persons. The second, standard case-control studies with population controls, requires the collection of data on one or more population controls for each person who is tested in the test facilities, so that test-positives and test-negatives can each be compared with population controls. The TND will detect differences in risk factors between symptomatic persons who have COVID-19 (test-positives) and those who have other respiratory infections (test-negatives). However, risk factors with effect sizes of equal magnitude for both COVID-19 and other respiratory infections will not be identified by the TND. Therefore, we discuss how to add population controls to compare with the test-positives and the test-negatives, yielding two additional case-control studies. We describe two options for population control groups: one composed of accompanying persons to the test facilities, the other drawn from existing country-wide healthcare databases. We also describe other possibilities for population controls. Combining the TND with population controls yields a triangulation approach that distinguishes between exposures that are risk factors for both COVID-19 and other respiratory infections, and exposures that are risk factors for just COVID-19. This combined design can be applied to future epidemics, but also to study causes of nonepidemic disease.","Vandenbroucke, Jan P; Brickley, Elizabeth B; Vandenbroucke-Grauls, Christina M J E; Pearce, Neil",Epidemiology,551,24

OBJECTIVES: To understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mothers/parents across Nova Scotia who are caring for a child 0-12 months of age. DESIGN: This study utilized an online qualitative survey to collect data. Feminist poststructuralism and discourse analysis guided the analysis and discussion. SETTING: Nova Scotia, Canada PARTICIPANTS: : 68 participants were recruited from across the province of Nova Scotia. FINDINGS: Mental health and socialization were both major concerns for new mothers/parents, as many expressed feelings of worry, anxiety, loneliness, isolation, and stress. KEY CONCLUSIONS: Online support was sought by many new mothers/parents as a way of supporting their own mental health. Some found ways to make it meaningful for them, while others believed that it could not replace or offer the same benefits as in-person interaction and support. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Informal and formal support systems are both essential for new mothers. As public health systems and health care services learn to adapt to COVID-19, further research is required to examine how health services may best meet the needs of new mothers/parents.","Ollivier, Rachel; Aston, Dr Megan; Price, Dr Sheri; Sim, Dr Meaghan; Benoit, Dr Britney; Joy, Dr Phillip; Iduye, Damilola; Nassaji, Neda Akbari",Midwifery,551,13

We studied the prevalence and neighborhood distribution of patients who tested positive for COVID-19 after implementation of universal screening at an academic hospital providing obstetrical services to an underserved Chicago population. Study Design From April 16 to June 16, 2020, a total of 369 patients were screened for COVID-19 at University of Illinois at Chicago with either the Abbott Point-of-Care (POC, n = 266) or reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction test (RT-PCR, n = 101). Patient residential data mapped using ESRI ArcGIS Pro was integrated in ESRI's Living Atlas with the Neighborhood Socioeconomic Status Index (NSEI). Results Precisely, 7.9% (29/369) of screened patients tested positive; 69% (17/29) with the POC test and 31% (12/29) by RT-PCR. The prevalence of an outpatient RT-PCR positive result was 8.9% (9/101). All but one of the 29 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) positive patients were either Hispanic or Black, and the majority resided in disadvantaged neighborhoods. Conclusion The disproportionate hit of COVID-19 pandemic on the Hispanic and Black communities reflects in SARS-CoV-2 positivity rates in the obstetrical population.

Coupling the data of confirmed COVID-19 cases with the Google mobility data in Australia, we present a state-level empirical study to: (1) inspect the temporal variation of the COVID-19 spread and the change of human mobility adherent to social restriction policies; (2) examine the extent to which different types of mobility are associated with the COVID-19 spread in eight Australian states/territories; and (3) analyse the time lag effect of mobility restriction on the COVID-19 spread. We find that social restriction policies implemented in the early stage of the pandemic controlled the COVID-19 spread effectively; the restriction of human mobility has a time lag effect on the growth rates of COVID-19, and the strength of the mobility-spread correlation increases up to seven days after policy implementation but decreases afterwards. The association between human mobility and COVID-19 spread varies across space and time and is subject to the types of mobility. Thus, it is important for government to consider the degree to which lockdown conditions can be eased by accounting for this dynamic mobility-spread relationship.","Wang, Siqin; Liu, Yan; Hu, Tao",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),551,16

PURPOSE: Clinical pharmacist productivity assessment has long been challenging, as a standard definition does not exist. A multistep project was undertaken with the intent to develop, validate, and implement an acute care clinical pharmacist productivity model. The initial step of the project was designed to identify, define, prioritize, and weight a comprehensive list of daily pharmacist responsibilities stratified by relative time spent on each function via consensus. METHODS: Delphi methodology applied by a panel of experts was used to identify a comprehensive list of acute care pharmacist responsibilities ranked in order of time intensity. Twenty-three acute care clinical pharmacists participated in the process. The consensus list was validated by time observation studies. Each responsibility was assigned a weight and corresponding work outputs by a consensus panel. Weighting of each responsibility was assigned according to the relative time intensity and complexity of each task. RESULTS: The results of the Delphi consensus process included the top 20 time-intensive responsibilities identified by the acute care clinical pharmacists. Timed observations of acute care clinical pharmacists yielded results similar to those of the consensus process. Selection of corresponding work outputs and weights for each responsibility provided the final requirements for the productivity model. CONCLUSION: The development of an acute care clinical pharmacist productivity model first requires the selection of appropriate work outputs and weighting. The consensus process provided a newly identified comprehensive list of pharmacist responsibilities that will serve as the foundation of the clinical productivity model. Validated consensus methodology can be useful for engaging clinical pharmacists in decision-making and the development of a clinical productivity model.","Vest, Tyler A; Simmons, Adrienne; Morbitzer, Kathryn A; McLaughlin, Jacqueline E; Cicci, Jonathan; Clarke, Megan; Valgus, John M; Falato, Chris; Waldron, Kayla M",Am. j. health system pharm,551,16

In such groups, a greater consumption of information pertaining to the COVID-19 pandemic may increase anxiety. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we examine the association between online activity and Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7) scores in the United States. METHODS: We recruited participants for an online survey through advertisements on various platforms such as Google, Facebook, and Reddit. A total of 406 adult US participants with moderate to severe (&#8805;10) GAD-7 scores met the inclusion criteria and completed the survey. Anxiety levels measured using the GAD-7 scale formed our primary outcome. Our key independent variables were average daily time spent online and average daily time spent online searching about COVID-19 within the past 14 days. We used as controls potential confounders of the relation between our key independent variables and GAD-7 scores, namely, sleep quality, the COVID-19 Fear Inventory scale, binge drinking, substance use, prescription drug abuse, and sociodemographic attributes. RESULTS: Linear multivariate regression analyses showed that GAD-7 scores were higher among those who spent >4 hours online (per day) searching for information about COVID-19 (coefficient 1.29, P=.002), controlling for all other covariates. The total time spent online was not statistically associated with GAD-7 scores.

Many countries are facing a second wave of the COVID-19 outbreak. A pressing need is evident for the development of a potent vaccine to control the SARS-CoV-2. Institutions and companies in many countries have announced their vaccine research programs and progress against the COVID-19. While most vaccines go through the designation and preparation stages, some of them are under evaluation for efficacy among animal models and clinical trials, and three approved vaccine candidates have been introduced for limited exploitation in Russia and China. An effective vaccine must induce a protective response of both cell-mediated and humoral immunity and should meet the safety and efficacy criteria. Although the emergence of new technologies has accelerated the development of vaccines, there are several challenges on the way, such as limited knowledge about the pathophysiology of the virus, inducing humoral or cellular immunity, immune enhancement with animal coronavirus vaccines, and lack of an appropriate animal model.

The patient was a 27-year-old Japanese female healthcare worker who was scheduled to undergo pituitary surgery for Cushing's disease. She had been in close contact with an undiagnosed patient infected with COVID-19 and then developed COVID-19 pneumonia. Despite a lack of known risk factors associated with severe COVID-19 infection, the patient's dyspnea worsened and her respiratory condition deteriorated, as indicated by the need for 7 L/min oxygen supply by mask to maintain her oxygen saturation at >90%. Medical treatment was initiated to control hypercortisolism by the 'block and replace' regimen using steroidogenesis inhibitors and hydrocortisone. The COVID-19 pneumonia improved with multi-modal treatment including antiviral therapy. One month later, after a negative severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) test result and with appropriate protection against virus transmission to medical staff in the operating room and daily medical care nurses, trans-sphenoidal surgery was performed by our highly experienced pituitary surgeon. One month after the surgery, the patient's basal ACTH and cortisol levels and urinary free cortisol were all under the detection limit. Surgical remission was expected. Since hypercortisolism due to active Cushing's disease may worsen a COVID-19 infection, multi-disciplinary management that includes appropriate and prompt treatment strategies is mandatory in such cases.","Yuno, Akiko; Kenmotsu, Yoshiyuki; Takahashi, Yuka; Nomoto, Hiroshi; Kameda, Hiraku; Cho, Kyu Yong; Nakamura, Akinobu; Yamashita, Yu; Nakamura, Junichi; Nakakubo, Sho; Kamada, Keisuke; Suzuki, Masaru; Sugino, Hirokazu; Inoshita, Naoko; Konno, Satoshi; Miyoshi, Hideaki; Atsumi, Tatsuya; Sawamura, Yutaka; Shimatsu, Akira",Endocr J,551,26

Previous studies of infectious diseases showed that infectious diseases not only cause physical damage to infected individuals but also damage to the mental health of the public. Therefore this study aims to analyze the factors that affected depression in the public during the COVID-19 pandemic to provide evidence for COVID-19-related mental health policies and to emphasize the need to prepare for mental health issues related to potential infectious disease outbreaks in the future. RESULTS: This study performed the following statistical analyses to analyze the factors that influence depression in the public during the COVID-19 pandemic. First, to confirm the level of depression in the public in each country, the participants' depression was plotted on a Boxplot graph for analysis. Second, to confirm personal and national factors that influence depression in individuals, a multi-level analysis was conducted. As a result, the median Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) score for all participants was 6. The median was higher than the overall median for the Philippines, Indonesia, and Paraguay, suggesting a higher level of depression. In personal variables, depression was higher in females than in males, and higher in participants who had experienced discrimination due to COVID-19 than those who had not. In contrast, depression was lower in older participants, those with good subjective health, and those who practiced personal hygiene for prevention. In national variables, depression was higher when the Government Response Stringency Index score was higher, when life expectancy was higher, and when social capital was higher. In contrast, depression was lower when literacy rates were higher. CONCLUSIONS: Our study reveals that depression was higher in participants living in countries with higher stringency index scores than in participants living in other countries. Maintaining a high level of vigilance for safety cannot be criticized. However, in the current situation, where coexisting with COVID-19 has become inevitable, inflexible and stringent policies not only increase depression in the public, but may also decrease resilience to COVID-19 and compromise preparations for coexistence with COVID-19. Accordingly, when establishing policies such as social distancing and quarantine, each country should consider the context of their own country.","Lee, Ji Ho; Lee, Hocheol; Kim, Ji Eon; Moon, Seok Jun; Nam, Eun Woo",Global Health,551,16

As part of physical distancing measures, the CDC is recommending that schools who traditionally have had students eat in a cafeteria or common large space instead have children eat their lunch or other meals in the classroom at already physically distanced desks. This has sparked concern for the safety of food-allergic children attending school, and some question of how the new CDC recommendations can coexist with recommendations in the 2013 CDC Voluntary Guidelines on Managing Food Allergy in Schools as well as accommodations that students may be afforded through disability law that may have previously prohibited eating in the classroom. This expert consensus explores the issues related to evidence-based management of food allergy at school, the issues of managing the health of children attending school that are acutely posed by the constraints of an infectious pandemic, and how to harmonize these needs so that all children can attend school with minimal risk from both an infectious and allergic standpoint.","Greenhawt, Matthew; Shaker, Marcus; Stukus, David R; Fleischer, David M; Hourihane, Jonathan; Tang, Mimi; Abrams, Elissa M; Wang, Julie; Bingemann, Theresa A; Chan, Edmond S; Lieberman, Jay; Sampson, Hugh A; Bock, S Allan; Young, Michael C; Waserman, Susan; Mack, Douglas P",J.

Persons at risk of severe disease, for example, those receiving immunosuppressive therapies for chronic inflammatory cdiseases (CIDs), are prioritised for vaccination. However, data concerning generation of protective antibody titres in immunosuppressed patients are scarce. Additionally, mRNA vaccines represent a new vaccine technology leading to increased insecurity especially in patients with CID. OBJECTIVE: Here we present for the first time, data on the efficacy and safety of anti-SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines in a cohort of immunosuppressed patients as compared with healthy controls. METHODS: 42 healthy controls and 26 patients with CID were included in this study (mean age 37.5 vs 50.5 years). Immunisations were performed according to national guidelines with mRNA vaccines. Antibody titres were assessed by ELISA before initial vaccination and 7 days after secondary vaccination. Disease activity and side effects were assessed prior to and 7 days after both vaccinations. RESULTS: Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies as well as neutralising activity could be detected in all study participants. IgG titres were significantly lower in patients as compared with controls (2053 binding antibody units (BAU)/mL ±1218 vs 2685±1102). Side effects were comparable in both groups. No severe adverse effects were observed, and no patients experienced a disease flare. CONCLUSION: We show that SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines lead to development of antibodies in immunosuppressed patients without considerable side effects or induction of disease flares. Despite the small size of this cohort, we were able to demonstrate the efficiency and safety of mRNA vaccines in our cohort.","Geisen, Ulf M; Berner, Dennis K; Tran, Florian; Sümbül, Melike; Vullriede, Lena; Ciripoi, Maria; Reid, Hayley M; Schaffarzyk, Annika; Longardt, Ann C; Franzenburg, Jeanette; Hoff, Paula; Schirmer, Jan H; Zeuner, Rainald; Friedrichs, Anette; Steinbach, Andrea; Knies, Christine; Markewitz, Robert Dh; Morrison, Peter J; Gerdes, Sascha; Schreiber, Stefan; Hoyer, Bimba F",Ann. rheum. dis,551,16

The pandemic has spread rapidly causing widespread devastation globally. Purpose: This review provides a brief understanding of pathophysiology, clinical features, diagnosis and management of COVID-19 and highlights the current knowledge as well as best practices for orthopaedic surgeons. These are likely to change as knowledge and evidence is gained. Results: Orthopaedic surgeons, like other front-line workers, carry the risk of getting infected during their practice, which as such is already substantially affected. Implementation of infection prevention and control as well as other safety measures for health care workers assumes great importance. All patients/visitors and staff visiting the hospital should be screened. Conservative treatment should be the first line of treatment except for those requiring urgent/emergent care. During lockdown all elective surgeries are to be withheld. All attempts should be made to reduce hospital visits and telemedicine is to be encouraged. Inpatient management of COVID-19 patients requires approval from concerned authorities. All patients being admitted to the hospital in and around containment zones should be tested for COVID-19. There are special considerations for anaesthesia with preference for regional anaesthesia. A separate Operation room with specific workflow should be dedicated for COVID-19 positive cases.

This has meant a quick transformation of the curriculum and learning styles to a digital platform. Despite the dramatic change, there is a lack of understanding about what this means particularly for the community of entrepreneurship educators in the higher education sector that rely on practical and immersive training for learning requirements. Design/methodology/approach: This paper is a literature review that discusses how communities of entrepreneurship education practitioners can deal with the Covid-19 pandemic. A review of the current literature on Covid-19 and entrepreneurship education is conducted that highlights the need to incorporate a community approach. This enables a better understanding about how communities of educational stakeholders including teachers, students and institutions can facilitate a more proactive and positive attitude. Findings: The paper finds that managing the Covid-19 crisis is difficult for entrepreneurship educations due to the need for practical and real life examples. This means the use of augmented reality and artificial intelligence is needed to simulate the real environment. This will enable a more community orientated approach to the study and practice of entrepreneurship.

Our results indicate a strong positive relationship between livestock-processing plants and local community transmission of COVID-19, suggesting that these plants may act as transmission vectors into the surrounding population and accelerate the spread of the virus beyond what would be predicted solely by population risk characteristics. We estimate the total excess COVID-19 cases and deaths associated with proximity to livestock plants to be 236,000 to 310,000 (6 to 8% of all US cases) and 4,300 to 5,200 (3 to 4% of all US deaths), respectively, as of July 21, 2020, with the vast majority likely related to community spread outside these plants. The association is found primarily among large processing facilities and large meatpacking companies. In addition, we find evidence that plant closures attenuated county-wide cases and that plants that received permission from the US Department of Agriculture to increase their production-line speeds saw more county-wide cases. Ensuring both public health and robust essential supply chains may require an increase in meatpacking oversight and potentially a shift toward more decentralized, smaller-scale meat production.","Taylor, Charles A; Boulos, Christopher; Almond, Douglas",Proc.

In January 2020, a new coronavirus named SARS-CoV2 was isolated and, since that time, SARS-CoV2 related disease (COVID-19) rapidly spread all over the world becoming pandemic in March 2020. The COVID-19 outbreak dramatically affected the public-health and the health-care facilities organization. Bilio-pancreatic endoscopy is considered a high-risk procedure for cross-contamination and, even though it is not directly involved in COVID-19 diagnosis and management, its reorganization is crucial to guarantee high standards of care minimizing the risk of SARS-CoV2 transmission among patients and health-care providers. Bilio-pancreatic endoscopic procedures often require a short physical distance between the endoscopist and the patient for a long period of time, a frequent exchange of devices, the involvement of a large number of personnel, the use of complex endoscopes difficult to reprocess. On this basis, endoscopic units should take precautions with adjusted management of bilio-pancreatic endoscopy. The aim of this article is to discuss the approach to bilio-pancreatic endoscopy in the COVID-19 era with focus on diagnostic algorithms, indications, management of the endoscopic room, proper use of Personal Protective Equipment and correct reprocessing of instrumentation.","Bove, Vincenzo; Schepis, Tommaso; Boškoski, Ivo; Landi, Rosario; Orlandini, Beatrice; Pontecorvi, Valerio; Familiari, Pietro; Tringali, Andrea; Perri, Vincenzo; Costamagna, Guido",Ther.

Methods: We conducted a national survey of 1308 SOTRs and 1617 non-SOTRs between November 11 and December 2, 2020 through the network of the National Kidney Foundation. Results: Respondents were largely White (73.2%), female (61.1%), and college graduates (56.2%). Among SOTRs, half (49.5%) were unsure or would be unwilling to receive a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine once available. Major concerns included potential side effects (85.2%), lack of rigor in the testing and development process (69.7%), and fear of incompatibility with organ transplants (75.4%). Even after the announcement of the high efficacy of the mRNA-1273 vaccine (Moderna Inc.) at the time of survey distribution, likeliness to receive a vaccine only slightly increased (53.5% before announcement versus 57.8% after the announcement). However, 86.8% of SOTRs would accept a vaccine if recommended by a transplant provider. Conclusions: SOTRs reported skepticism in receiving a potential SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, even after announcements of high vaccine efficacy. Reassuringly, transplant providers may be the defining influence in vaccine acceptance and will likely have a critical role to play in promoting vaccine adherence.","Ou, M. T.; Boyarsky, B.

Illness perceptions toward COVID-19, psychological flexibility, prosociality, coping and mental health, socio-demographics, lockdown-related variables and COVID-19 status were assessed. Results showed that psychological flexibility was the only significant mediator in the relationship between illness perceptions toward COVID-19 and mental health across all regions (all ps = 0.001-0.021). Seeking social support was the significant mediator across subgroups (all ps range = <0.001-0.005) except from the Hong Kong sample (p = 0.06) and the North and South American sample (p = 0.53).

All were observational with low patient numbers and multiple confounding factors, but describe cases of acute respiratory infection transmission during chest compressions. One systematic review concluded that chest compressions were not an AGP. Two simulated studies (released as preprints) potentially demonstrate aerosol generation.

This study investigates the perceptions of residents who stayed at university residential halls during the pandemic. In-depth interviews were conducted with 77 staying residents from four public universities in Hong Kong. Through the sharing of their residential experience, it was found that these stayers were impacted greatly by the changes in the residential hall environment, particularly in terms of reduced interaction and emerging disciplinary concerns. Results reveal that stayers had undergone different negative mental states, namely stress, paranoia, loneliness and boredom. After identifying their conditions, some sustainable residential practices were proposed, such as maintaining minimum face-to-face contact for stayers, practicing transparent communication and arranging bulk purchases of living supplies. It is hoped that the results of this study can help to inform readers regarding the possible impacts on the stayers during a partial lockdown environment in university residential halls and how they can be better supported by universities.","Cheng, M.

METHODS: In an online survey, 299 mothers reported their sleep habits, experience of time, and psychological difficulties as well as those of their children (6-10 years old) during and, retrospectively, before the lockdown. RESULTS: During the lockdown, children showed a marked delay in sleep timing-that is, later bedtime and rise time-and a mild worsening in sleep quality. They were less prone to respect daily routines or to keep track of the passage of time. They showed increased emotional, conduct, and hyperactive symptoms, and the increase in these psychological difficulties was predicted by the change in sleep quality, boredom, and mothers' psychological difficulties. In addition, mothers showed a delayed sleep timing and worsening of sleep quality during the lockdown, in varying degrees depending on their working conditions. Mothers who kept working regularly outside their homes during lockdown reported more regular sleep patterns, whereas mothers who stopped working showed more emotional symptoms and relevant changes in their perception of time. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, given the evidence of the adverse behavioral and psychological impact of home confinement and social restrictions, effective measures needed to be in place to mitigate long-term effects on children and their mothers, especially those who have had to stop working during lockdown.","Cellini, Nicola; Di Giorgio, Elisa; Mioni, Giovanna; Di Riso, Daniela",J Pediatr Psychol,551,1

It acts as the master of the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) process in the lumen of the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER). SCOPE: Under the stress of unfolded proteins, GRP78 binds to the unfolded proteins to prevent misfolding, while under the load of the unfolded protein, it drives the cell to autophagy or apoptosis. Several attempts reported the overexpression of GRP78 on the cell membrane of cancer cells and cells infected with viruses or fungi. MAJOR CONCLUSIONS: Cell-surface GRP78 is used as a cancer cell target in previous studies. Additionally, GRP78 is used as a drug target to stop the progression of cancer cells by different compounds, including peptides, antibodies, and some natural compounds. Additionally, it can be used as a protein target to reduce the infectivity of different viruses, including the pandemic SARS-CoV-2. Besides, GRP78 targeting is used in diagnosis and imaging modalities using radionuclides. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: This review summarizes the various attempts that used GRP78 both in therapy (fighting cancer, viral and fungal infections) and diagnosis (imaging).","Elfiky, Abdo A; Baghdady, Ahmed M; Ali, Shehab A; Ahmed, Marwan I",Life Sci,551,23

Of 437 Americans and their travel companions on the ship, 114 (26%) tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). METHODS: We interviewed 229 American passengers and crew after disembarkation following a ship-based quarantine to identify risk factors for infection and characterize transmission onboard the ship. RESULTS: The attack rate for passengers in single-person cabins or without infected cabinmates was 18% (58/329), compared with 63% (27/43) for those sharing a cabin with an asymptomatic infected cabinmate, and 81% (25/31) for those with a symptomatic infected cabinmate. Whole genome sequences from specimens from passengers who shared cabins clustered together. Of 66 SARS-CoV-2-positive American travelers with complete symptom information, 14 (21%) were asymptomatic while on the ship. Among SARS-CoV-2-positive Americans, 10 (9%) required intensive care, of whom 7 were &#8805;70 years. CONCLUSION: Our findings highlight the high risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission on cruise ships. High rates of SARS-CoV-2 positivity in cabinmates of individuals with asymptomatic infections suggest that triage by symptom status in shared quarters is insufficient to halt transmission. A high rate of intensive care unit admission among older individuals complicates the prospect of future cruise travel during the pandemic, given typical cruise passenger demographics. The magnitude and severe outcomes of this outbreak were major factors contributing to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's decision to halt cruise ship travel in U.S. waters in March 2020.","Plucinski, Mateusz M; Wallace, Megan; Uehara, Anna; Kurbatova, Ekaterina V; Tobolowsky, Farrell A; Schneider, Zachary D; Ishizumi, Atsuyoshi; Bozio, Catherine H; Kobayashi, Miwako; Toda, Mitsuru; Stewart, Andrea; Wagner, Riley L; Moriarty, Leah F; Murray, Rachel; Queen, Krista; Tao, Ying; Paden, Clinton; Mauldin, Matthew R; Zhang, Jing; Li, Yan; Elkins, Christopher A; Lu, Xiaoyan; Herzig, Carolyn T A; Novak, Ryan; Bower, William; Medley, Alexandra M; Acosta, Anna M; Knust, Barbara; Cantey, Paul T; Pesik, Nicki T; Halsey, Eric S; Cetron, Martin S; Tong, Suxiang; Marston, Barbara J; Friedman, Cindy R",Clin Infect Dis,551,23

Background: Given the covid-19 pandemic, many jurisdictions, to spare resources, have limited access to operating rooms for elective surgical activity, including cancer, thus forcing deferral or cancellation of cancer surgeries. Surgery for hepatobiliary cancer is high-risk and particularly resource-intensive. Surgeons must critically appraise which patients will benefit most from surgery and which ones have other therapeutic options to delay surgery. Little guidance is currently available about potential delaying strategies for hepatobiliary cancers when surgery is not possible. Methods: An international multidisciplinary panel reviewed the available literature to summarize data relating to standard-of-care surgical management and possible mitigating strategies to be used as a bridge to surgery for colorectal liver metastases, hepatocellular carcinoma, gallbladder cancer, intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, and hilar cholangiocarcinoma. Results: Outcomes of surgery during the covid-19 pandemic are reviewed. Resource requirements are summarized, including logistics and adverse effects profiles for hepatectomy and delaying strategies using systemic, percutaneous and radiation ablative, and liver embolic therapies. For each cancer type, the long-term oncologic outcomes of hepatectomy and the clinical tools that can be used to prognosticate for individual patients are detailed. Conclusions: There are a variety of delaying strategies to consider if availability of operating rooms decreases. This review summarizes available data to provide guidance about possible delaying strategies depending on patient, resource, institution, and systems factors. Multidisciplinary team discussions should be leveraged to consider patient- and tumour-specific information for each individual case.","Bennett, S; Søreide, K; Gholami, S; Pessaux, P; Teh, C; Segelov, E; Kennecke, H; Prenen, H; Myrehaug, S; Callegaro, D; Hallet, J",Curr Oncol,551,18

We synthetically consider both the number of infected population and its changing rate as the switching condition to implement the curing measures. By using the properties of the Lambert W function, we convert the proposed switching condition to a threshold value related to the susceptible population. The classical epidemic model involving media coverage, linear functions describing injecting vaccine and treatment strategies is examined when the susceptible population exceeds the threshold value. In addition, we consider another SIR model accompanied with the vaccination and treatment strategies represented by saturation functions when the susceptible population is smaller than the threshold value. The dynamics of these two subsystems and the sliding domain are discussed in detail. Four types of local sliding bifurcation are investigated, including boundary focus, boundary node, boundary saddle and boundary saddle-node bifurcations. In the meantime, the global bifurcation involving the appearance of limit cycles is examined, including touching bifurcation, homoclinic bifurcation to the pseudo-saddle and crossing bifurcation. Furthermore, the influence of some key parameters related to the three treatment strategies is explored.

DESIGN: Data come from a cross-sectional online survey targeted at LGBTQ+ people, which collected data on mental health, experiences of discrimination and a number of other pandemic-related experiences. To examine the association between sexual orientation and gender and mental health and experiences of discrimination, we conducted regression analyses that adjusted for a range of sociodemographic variables. SETTING: A web-based survey was used to collect data between the end of April and mid July 2020. PARTICIPANTS: An analytical sample of 310 LGBTQ+ respondents aged 18 and above. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We assessed mental health with the 4-item Perceived Stress Scale and with the 10-item Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale (CES-D-10). We asked respondents about discriminatory experiences because of their LGBTQ+ identity during the coronavirus pandemic. RESULTS: Perceived stress scores among our LGBTQ+ sample were high (mean: 7.67; SD: 3.22). Based on a score of 10 or more on the CES-D-10, the majority of participants had high levels of depressive symptoms (72%). Around one-in-six respondents reported some form of discrimination since the start of the pandemic because they were LGBTQ+ (16.7%). The average score for perceived stress increased by 1.44 points (95% CI 0.517 to 2.354) for respondents who had experienced discrimination versus those who had not. Similarly, the odds of exhibiting significant depressive symptomology increased threefold among those who had experienced discrimination compared with those who had not (OR: 3.251; 95% CI 1.168 to 9.052). CONCLUSIONS: The LGBTQ+ community exhibited high levels of depression, stress and experienced discrimination during the coronavirus pandemic. High levels of poor mental health were partially explained by experiences of discrimination, which had a large, consistent and pernicious impact on mental health.","Kneale, Dylan; Bécares, Laia",BMJ Open,551,1

Lack of specialized treatments for the disease demands preventive measures based on statistical/mathematical models. The analysis of epidemiological curve fitting, on number of daily infections across affected countries, provides useful insights on the characteristics of the epidemic. A variety of phenomenological models are available to capture the dynamics of disease spread and growth. The number of daily new infections and cumulative number of infections in COVID-19 over four selected countries, namely, Sri Lanka, Italy, the United States, and Hebei province of China, from the first day of appearance of cases to 2nd July 2020 were used in the study. Gompertz, logistic, Weibull, and exponential growth curves were fitted on the cumulative number of infections across countries. AIC, BIC, RMSE, and R 2 were used to determine the best fitting curve for each country. Results revealed that the most appropriate growth curves for Sri Lanka, Italy, the United States, and China (Hebei) are the logistic, Gompertz, Weibull, and Gompertz curves, respectively. Country-wise, overall growth rate, final epidemic size, and short-term forecasts were evaluated using the selected model. Daily log incidences in each country were regressed before and after the identified peak time of the respective outbreak of epidemic. Hence, doubling time/halving time together with daily growth rates and predictions was estimated. Findings and relevant interpretations demonstrate that the outbreak seems to be extinct in Hebei, China, whereas further transmissions are possible in the United States. In Italy and Sri Lanka, current outbreaks transmit in a decreasing rate.","Attanayake, A M C H; Perera, S S N; Jayasinghe, S",Comput Math Methods Med,551,1

Since November 2020, the TaqPath COVID-19 assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific) has been used to identify viral strains of the new lineage B.1.1.7, since it fails to detect the S-gene with the &#8710;69/70 deletion. Here, we proposed S-gene mutations screening with the Allplex SARS-CoV-2 assay (Seegene), another widely used RT-PCR test that targets Sarbecovirus E, SARS-CoV-2 N, and RdRp/S genes. Accordingly, we evaluated the S gene amplification curve pattern compared to those of the other genes. Exploiting an Allplex assay-generated dataset, we screened 663 RT-PCR digital records, including all SARS-CoV-2 respiratory samples tested in our laboratory with the Allplex assay between January 1st and February 25th, 2021. This approach enabled us to detect 64 samples with peculiar non-sigmoidal amplification curves.

In Croatia, lockdown measures to curb virus spread lasted from March to May 2020, and all non-essential medical procedures and patients' visits have been cancelled. The study aimed to compare patients' flow and interventions in the surgical department before, during and after the lockdown period. Methods This cross-sectional study analysed the workload at the Maxillofacial and Oral Surgery Department (Department), Osijek University Hospital, during the COVID-19 pandemic (March-May 2020) and four subsequent months. The same period of 2019 was compared as a control. The data were subtracted from hospitals' electronic database. Results During COVID-19 lockdown from March to May 2020 the number of hospitalizations (306 vs. 138), surgical procedures (306 vs. 157), and scheduled outpatient visits (2009 vs. 804), dropped significantly as compared to 2019. The number of skin tumour removals was halved (from 155 in 2019 to 58 in 2019) (p<0.001), and the number of emergency patients was unchanged in the 3-month period. A significant decrease in outpatient visits and hospital admissions continued after the lockdown (p<0.001). Conclusion A decrease in the number of outpatient visits, hospitalizations, and tumour removals may result in larger proportions of patients with advanced cancers in the future. The second wave of COVID-19 pandemic is ongoing, and special effort must be paid to reduce the number of cancer patients receiving suboptimal treatment.","Kvolik Pavic, Ana; Zubcic, Vedran; Kvolik, Slavica",,551,16

Because ACE-2 may be modulated by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), there is concern that patients treated with ACEIs and ARBs are at higher risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia. AIM: This study sought to analyze the association of COVID-19 pneumonia with previous treatment with ACEIs and ARBs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 684 consecutive patients hospitalized for suspected COVID-19 pneumonia and tested by polymerase chain reaction assay. Patients were split into two groups, according to whether (group 1, n = 484) or not (group 2, n = 250) COVID-19 was confirmed. Multivariable adjusted comparisons included a propensity score analysis. RESULTS: The mean age was 63.6 ± 18.7 years, and 302 patients (44%) were female. Hypertension was present in 42.6% and 38.4% of patients in groups 1 and 2, respectively (P = 0.28). Treatment with ARBs was more frequent in group 1 than group 2 (20.7% vs. 12.0%, respectively; odds ratio [OR] 1.92, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.23-2.98; P = 0.004). No difference was found for treatment with ACEIs (12.7% vs. 15.7%, respectively; OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.52-1.26; P = 0.35). Propensity score-matched multivariable logistic regression confirmed a significant association between COVID-19 and previous treatment with ARBs (adjusted OR 2.36, 95% CI 1.38-4.04; P = 0.002). Significant interaction between ARBs and ACEIs for the risk of COVID-19 was observed in patients aged > 60 years, women, and hypertensive patients. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that ACEIs and ARBs are not similarly associated with COVID-19. In this retrospective series, patients with COVID-19 pneumonia more frequently had previous treatment with ARBs compared with patients without COVID-19.","Georges, Jean-Louis; Gilles, Floriane; Cochet, Hélène; Bertrand, Alisson; De Tournemire, Marie; Monguillon, Victorien; Pasqualini, Maeva; Prevot, Alix; Roger, Guillaume; Saba, Joseph; Soltani, Joséphine; Koukabi-Fradelizi, Mehrsa; Beressi, Jean-Paul; Laureana, Cécile; Prost, Jean-François; Livarek, Bernard",PLoS One,551,20

Immune checkpoint inhibition reactivates immunity against tumors that escaped immune surveillance in approximately 30% of cases. Recent studies demonstrated poorer response rates in female and younger patients. Although immune responses differ with sex and age, the role of MHC-based immune selection in this context is unknown. We find that tumors in younger and female individuals accumulate more poorly presented driver mutations than those in older and male patients, despite no differences in MHC genotype. Younger patients show the strongest effects of MHC-based driver mutation selection, with younger females showing compounded effects and nearly twice as much MHC-II based selection. This study presents evidence that strength of immune selection during tumor development varies with sex and age, and may influence the availability of mutant peptides capable of driving effective response to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy.","Castro, Andrea; Pyke, Rachel Marty; Zhang, Xinlian; Thompson, Wesley Kurt; Day, Chi-Ping; Alexandrov, Ludmil B; Zanetti, Maurizio; Carter, Hannah",Nat Commun,551,16

This retrospective observational analysis of EDSSS data aimed to describe changes in ED attendances during March-April 2020, and identify the attendance types with the largest impact. Type 1 ED attendances were selected from 109 EDs that reported data to EDSSS for the period 1 January 2019 to 26 April 2020. The daily numbers of attendances were plotted by age group and acuity of presentation. The 2020 'COVID-19' period (12 March 2020 to 26 April 2020) attendances were compared with the equivalent 2019 'pre-COVID-19' period (14 March 2019 to 28 April 2019): in total; by hour and day of the week; age group(<1, 1-4, 15-14, 15-44, 45-64 and 65+ years); gender; acuity; and for selected syndromic indicators(acute respiratory infection, gastroenteritis, myocardial ischaemia). Daily ED attendances up to 11 March 2020 showed regular trends, highest on a Monday and reduced in children during school holidays. From 12 March 2020 ED attendances decreased across all age groups, all acuity levels, on all days and times. Across age groups the greatest percentage reductions were seen in school age children (5-14 years). By acuity, the greatest reduction occurred in the less severe presentations. Syndromic indicators showed that the greatest reductions were in non-respiratory indicators, which fell by 44-67% during 2020 COVID-19, while acute respiratory infection was reduced by -4.4% (95% CI -9.5% to 0.6%). ED attendances in England have been particularly affected during the COVID-19 pandemic due to changes in healthcare seeking behaviour. EDSSS has enabled real-time daily monitoring of these changes, which are made publicly available to facilitate action. The EDSSS provides valuable surveillance of ED attendances in England. The flexibility of EDSSS allowed rapid development of new indicators (including COVID-19-like) and reporting methods.","Hughes, Helen E; Hughes, Thomas C; Morbey, Roger; Challen, Kirsty; Oliver, Isabel; Smith, Gillian E; Elliot, Alex J",Emerg Med J,551,1

During the phase I to phase III clinical trials, most of these vaccines have demonstrated both their safety and efficacy. Despite questions remain about the impact of virus variants and the duration of the immune response, messenger RNA (mRNA)-based and adenoviral vectored vaccines have demonstrated an overall efficacy from 70 to 95% in both phase III trials and real life.

OBJECTIVE: The scientific community, citizens, politicians, and mass media are expressing concerns regarding data suggesting that the number of COVID-19-related deaths in Italy is significantly higher than in the rest of the world. Moreover, Italian citizens have misleading perceptions related to the number of swab tests that have actually been performed. Citizens and mass media are denouncing the coverage of COVID-19 swab testing in Italy, claiming that it is not in line with that in other countries worldwide. METHODS: In this paper, we attempt to clarify the aspects of COVID-19 fatalities and testing in Italy by performing a set of statistical analyses that highlight the actual numbers in Italy and compare them with official worldwide data. RESULTS: The analysis clearly shows that the Italian COVID-19 fatality and mortality rates are in line with the official world scenario, as are the numbers of COVID-19 tests performed in Italy and in the Lombardy region.

This study is to summarize the clinical features, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation characteristics, and outcomes of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pneumonia received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. DESIGN: Descriptive study from two hospitals. SETTING: The ICUs from university hospitals. PATIENTS: Patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pneumonia received mechanical ventilation, including those underwent extracorporeal membrane oxygenation from Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital from January 8, 2020, to March 31, 2020. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Clinical records, laboratory results, ventilator parameters, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation-related data were abstracted from the medical records. One-hundred twenty-nine critically ill patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pneumonia were admitted to ICU of the two referral hospitals. Fifty-nine patients received mechanical ventilation and 21 of them received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support (fourteen from Zhongnan hospital and seven from Wuhan pulmonary hospital). Compared to mechanical ventilation patients without extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support, there was a tendency of decline in mortality but with no significant difference (no-extracorporeal membrane oxygenation group 24/38 [63.2%] vs extracorporeal membrane oxygenation group 12/21 [57.1%]; p = 0.782). For those patients with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, 12 patients died and nine survived by April 7, 2020. Among extracorporeal membrane oxygenation patients, the PaCO2 prior to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was lower (54.40 mm Hg [29.20-57.50 mm Hg] vs 63.20 mm Hg [55.40-72.12 mm Hg]; p = 0.006), and pH prior to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was higher (7.38 [7.28-7.48] vs 7.23 [7.16-7.33]; p = 0.023) in survivors than nonsurvivors. CONCLUSIONS: Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation might be an effective salvage treatment for patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pneumonia associated with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. Severe CO2 retention and acidosis prior to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation indicated a poor prognosis.","Yang, Xiao; Cai, Shuhan; Luo, Yun; Zhu, Fangfang; Hu, Ming; Zhao, Yan; Zheng, Ruiqiang; Li, Xuyan; Hu, Bo; Peng, Zhiyong",Crit. care med,551,18

However, substantial undocumented infections have obscured the true size of the currently infected population, which is arguably the most critical number for public health policy decisions. We developed a machine learning framework to estimate time courses of actual new COVID-19 cases and current infections in all 50 U.S. states and the 50 most infected countries from reported test results and deaths. Using published epidemiological parameters, our algorithm optimized slowly varying daily ascertainment rates and a time course of currently infected cases each day. Severe under-ascertainment of COVID-19 cases was found to be universal across U.S. states and countries worldwide. In 25 out of the 50 countries, actual cumulative cases were estimated to be 5-20 times greater than the confirmed cases. Our estimates of cumulative incidence were in line with the existing seroprevalence rates in 46 U.S. states. Our framework projected for countries like Belgium, Brazil, and the U.S. that ~10% of the population has been infected once. In the U.S. states like Louisiana, Georgia, and Florida, more than 4% of the population was estimated to be currently infected, as of September 3, 2020, while in New York this fraction is 0.12%. The estimation of the actual fraction of currently infected people is crucial for any definition of public health policies, which up to this point may have been misguided by the reliance on confirmed cases.","Noh, Jungsik; Danuser, Gaudenz",PLoS One,551,10

Leather industry being a major commodity-driven sector, its role in addressing the issues concerning the safe use of leather products has become inevitable for the sustainability of the industry. A significant number of researches have been conducted to fabricate bio-safe leather by incorporating different types of antimicrobial agents during leather manufacturing. Besides, the increasing diversity in the development of synthetic materials and the impact of COVID-19 outbreak on automotive industry may create more demand from customers for incorporating different functionalities in leather without losing its inherent properties. Some of the key functionalities discussed include resistance to microbial growth, self-cleaning through superhydrophobicity and photocatalysis, thermal regulation, flame retardance and scented leather. This review focusses on the fabrication of such advanced functional leather materials over the past decade with special emphasis on antimicrobial leather. Some of the key factors elaborated in the review include the state of art approaches for the preparation of functional materials, mode of incorporation of the same into the leather matrix, the mechanism behind with a perspective on the challenges involved in fabrication for real-world applications. A major outcome of this review is that even though several kinds of cutting edge researches are happening in the field of leather manufacturing, most of them were not validated for its practical applicability and sustainability of the proposed solution. This could be majorly attributed to the cost involved in fabrication of such materials, which forms a crucial factor when it comes to a mass production industry such as leather. Also, the researchers should concentrate on the toxicity of the fabricated materials which can impede the process of adopting such emerging and need of the hour technologies in the near future. Knowledge obtained from this review on fabrication of bio-safety leather against bacteria, mold and fungi would help further to integrate the antiviral property into the same which is a global need. Also, fabrication of functionalized leather would open new avenues for leather manufactures to venture into the development of advanced leather products such as flexible electronics, radiation shielding and fire fighting garments etc.","Ramesh, Renganath Rao Murali Sathish Jonnalagadda Raghava Rao",Journal of Cleaner Production,551,33

We aimed to evaluate the characteristics of a large population of pediatric patients with severe COVID-19 and compare them with patients with severe cases of influenza and other respiratory viruses (ORV). METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study of Brazilian data from the National Epidemiological Surveillance Information System, gathered from January 1st to July 14th, 2020. The sample included 4,784 patients (2,570 with confirmed COVID-19, 659 with influenza, 1,555 with ORV). Outcome measures included clinical features, preexisting comorbidities, pediatric intensive care unit admissions, need for ventilatory support, and death. RESULTS: Compared with the influenza and ORV groups, the COVID-19 group had a higher proportion of newborns and adolescents, as well as lower frequencies of fever, cough, dyspnea, respiratory distress, and desaturation. Although use of invasive ventilatory support was similar among groups, death rate was highest for COVID-19 (15.2% vs. 4.5% vs. 3.2%, p&lt;0.001), with death risk more than three times the other groups (adjusted OR=3.7 [95% CI 2.5-5.6]). The presence of two or more comorbidities further increased this risk (OR=4.8 [95% CI 3.5-6.6]). Preexisting comorbidities were reported in 986 patients with severe COVID-19 (38%). Mortality rate among COVID-19 patients was significantly higher for almost all comorbidities reported. CONCLUSION: Severe COVID-19 had a higher mortality rate than other viral respiratory illnesses, despite the lower frequency of fever, cough, dyspnea, respiratory distress, and desaturation. Death risk was strongly associated with preexisting comorbidities.","Sousa, Braian L.A.; Sampaio-Carneiro, Magda; de Carvalho, Werther B.; Silva, Clovis A.; Ferraro, Alexandre A.",Clinics,551,16

Treatment with IVIg does not increase the risk of contracting COVID-19, and the IVIg administration may have a protective role. However, infusions can expose patients to an increased risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 due to repeated access to Health Facilities. In this report we analyzed the short-term follow-up of CIDP patients who modified their chronic IVIg therapy during pandemic. About half of CIDP patients regularly treated with IVIg tried to stop treatment and about 10% shifted to SCIg. Forty-two percent of the patients who stopped the treatment reported a clinical deterioration after suspension and had to restart IVIg.

In December 2019, the coronavirus spread rapidly around the world, thought to be originated from Wuhan in China and is responsible for a large number of deaths. Earlier detection of the COVID-19 through accurate diagnosis, particularly for the cases with no obvious symptoms, may decrease the patient's death rate. Chest X-ray images are primarily used for the diagnosis of this disease. This research has proposed a machine vision approach to detect COVID-19 from the chest X-ray images. The features extracted by the histogram-oriented gradient (HOG) and convolutional neural network (CNN) from X-ray images were fused to develop the classification model through training by CNN (VGGNet). Modified anisotropic diffusion filtering (MADF) technique was employed for better edge preservation and reduced noise from the images. A watershed segmentation algorithm was used in order to mark the significant fracture region in the input X-ray images. The testing stage considered generalized data for performance evaluation of the model. Cross-validation analysis revealed that a 5-fold strategy could successfully impair the overfitting problem. This proposed feature fusion using the deep learning technique assured a satisfactory performance in terms of identifying COVID-19 compared to the immediate, relevant works with a testing accuracy of 99.49%, specificity of 95.7% and sensitivity of 93.65%. When compared to other classification techniques, such as ANN, KNN, and SVM, the CNN technique used in this study showed better classification performance. K-fold cross-validation demonstrated that the proposed feature fusion technique (98.36%) provided higher accuracy than the individual feature extraction methods, such as HOG (87.34%) or CNN (93.64%).","Alam, Nur-A-; Ahsan, Mominul; Based, Md Abdul; Haider, Julfikar; Kowalski, Marcin",Sensors (Basel),551,16

Previously we have shown that CAP generated with a flexible surface Dielectric Barrier Discharge (sDBD) is highly effective against bacteria in vitro and in ex vivo burn wound models. In the current paper, we determined the in vitro and in vivo safety and efficacy of CAP generated by this sDBD device. METHODS: The effect of CAP on DNA mutations of V79 fibroblasts was measured using a hypoxanthine-guanine-phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) assay. Furthermore, effects on cell proliferation, apoptosis and DNA damage in ex vivo burn wound models (BWMs) were assessed using immunohistochemistry. Next, 105 colony forming units (CFU) P. aeruginosa strain PAO1 were exposed to CAP in a 3D collagen-elastin matrix environment to determine the number of surviving bacteria in vitro. Finally, rat excision wounds were inoculated with 107 CFU PAO1 for 24 h. The wounds received a single CAP treatment, repeated treatments on 4 consecutive days with CAP, 100 µL of 1% (wt/wt) silver sulfadiazine or no treatment. Wound swabs and punch biopsies were taken to determine the number of surviving bacteria. RESULTS: Exposure of V79 fibroblasts to CAP did not increase the numbers of mutated colonies. Additionally, the number of proliferative, apoptotic and DNA damaged cells in the BWMs was comparable to that of the unexposed control. Exposure of PAO1 to CAP for 2 min resulted in the complete elimination of bacteria in vitro. Contrarily, CAP treatment for 6 min of rat wounds colonized with PAO1 did not effectively reduce the in vivo bacterial count. CONCLUSIONS: CAP treatment was safe but showed limited efficacy against PAO1 in our rat wound infection model.","Dijksteel, Gabrielle S; Ulrich, Magda M W; Vlig, Marcel; Sobota, Ana; Middelkoop, Esther; Boekema, Bouke K H L",Ann Clin Microbiol Antimicrob,551,20

METHODS: We bench-tested the functioning of the device with an added PEEP valve extensively, mimicking adult patients with various respiratory mechanics during controlled ventilation, spontaneous breathing, and prolonged unstable conditions where mechanics or breathing effort was changed at every breath. The device was further tested on a porcine model (4 animals) after inducing lung injury, and these results were compared with conventional ventilation modes. RESULTS: The device was stable and predictable, delivering a constant flow (30 L/min) and cycling automatically at the inspiratory pressure set (minimum of 20 cm H2O) above auto-PEEP. Changes in respiratory mechanics manifested as changes in respiratory timing, allowing prediction of tidal volumes from breathing frequency. Simulating lung injury resulted in relatively low tidal volumes (330 mL with compliance of 20 mL/cm H2O). In the porcine model, arterial oxygenation, CO2, and pH were comparable to conventional modes of ventilation. CONCLUSIONS: The Oxylator is a simple device that delivered stable ventilation with tidal volumes within a clinically acceptable range in bench and porcine lung models with low compliance. External monitoring of respiratory timing is advisable, allowing tidal volume estimation and recognition of changes in respiratory mechanics. The device can be an efficient, low-cost, and practical rescue solution for providing ventilatory support as a temporary bridge, but it requires a caregiver at the bedside.","Jonkman, Annemijn H; Katira, Bhushan H; Schreiber, Annia; Lu, Cong; Engelberts, Doreen; Vieira, Fernando; Marquez, Alexandra; Slutsky, Arthur S; Dorian, Paul; Brochard, Laurent J",Respir. care,551,16

Antibody testing, both at an individual level and of populations, has been widely viewed to be a key activity for guiding the options for treatment of high-risk individuals, as well as the implementation of safe control of infection measures. Ideally, the detection of a specific antibody should signify that all individuals tested have been infected by SARS-CoV-2 and that in the case of specific IgG that they are immune to further infection. This would enable SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals to be appropriately managed and healthcare workers shown to be immune to return to work where they would no longer pose a risk to their patients or be at risk themselves. Unfortunately, this is not the case for COVID-19, where it has been shown that immunity may not be protective, and seroconversion delayed or absent. The variability in antibody test performance, particularly that of lateral flow assays, has caused confusion for the public and healthcare professions alike. Many antibody test devices have been made available without independent evaluations and these may lack both adequate sensitivity and specificity. This review seeks to educate healthcare workers, particularly those working in oncology, of the current benefits and limitations of SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing.","Maple, P A C; Sikora, K",Clin Oncol (R Coll Radiol),551,17

D-dimer is an important prognostic tool, is often elevated in patients with severe coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) infection and in those who suffered death. In this systematic review, we aimed to investigate the prognostic role of D-dimer in COVID-19-infected patients. We searched PubMed, Medline, Embase, Ovid, and Cochrane for studies reporting admission D-dimer levels in COVID-19 patients and its effect on mortality. Eighteen studies (16 retrospective and two prospective) with a total of 3,682 patients met the inclusion criteria. The pooled weighted mean difference (WMD) demonstrated significantly elevated D-dimer levels in patients who died versus those who survived (WMD 6.13 mg/L, 95% confidence interval [CI] 4.16 - 8.11, p <0.001). Similarly, the pooled mean D-dimer levels were significantly elevated in patients with severe COVID-19 infection (WMD 0.54 mg/L, 95% CI 0.28 - 0.80, p< 0.001).

However, its impact on neurocognitive, psychiatric health and quality of life (QoL) in survivors after the acute phase is poorly understood. We aimed to evaluate neurocognitive function, psychiatric symptoms and QoL in COVID-19 survivors shortly after hospital discharge. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional analysis of a prospective study of hospitalized COVID-19 survivors followed up for 2 months after discharge. A battery of standardized instruments evaluating neurocognitive function, psychiatric morbidity and QoL (mental and physical components) was administered by telephone. RESULTS: Of the 229 screened patients, 179 were included in the final analysis. Amongst survivors, the prevalence of moderately impaired immediate verbal memory and learning was 38%, delayed verbal memory (11.8%), verbal fluency (34.6%) and working memory (executive function) (6.1%), respectively. Moreover, 58.7% of patients had neurocognitive impairment in at least one function. Rates of positive screening for anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder were 29.6%, 26.8% and 25.1%, respectively. In addition, 39.1% of the patients had psychiatric morbidity. Low QoL for physical and mental components was detected in 44.1% and 39.1% of patients respectively. Delirium and psychiatric morbidity were associated with neurocognitive impairment, and female gender was related with psychiatric morbidity. CONCLUSION: Hospitalized COVID-19 survivors showed a considerable prevalence of neurocognitive impairment, psychiatric morbidity and poor QoL in the short term. It is uncertain if these impacts persist over the long term.","Méndez, R; Balanzá-Martínez, V; Luperdi, S C; Estrada, I; Latorre, A; González-Jiménez, P; Feced, L; Bouzas, L; Yépez, K; Ferrando, A; Hervás, D; Zaldívar, E; Reyes, S; Berk, M; Menéndez, R",J. intern. med,551,16

EUT uses a theoretical device called von Neumann–Morgenstern utility function, where concepts of function and random variable are employed in their pre-set-theoretic senses. Any von Neumann–Morgenstern utility function thus derived is claimed to transform a non-degenerate random variable into its certainty equivalent. However, there can be no certainty equivalent for a non-degenerate random variable by the set-theoretic definition of a random variable, whilst the continuity axiom of EUT implies the existence of such a certainty equivalent. This paper also demonstrates that rational behaviour under utility theory is incompatible with scarcity of resources, making behaviour consistent with EUT irrational and justifying persistent external inconsistencies of EUT. A brief description of a new paradigm which can resolve the problems of the standard paradigm is presented. These include resolutions of such anomalies as instant endowment effect, asymmetric valuation of gains and losses, intransitivity of preferences, profit puzzle as well as the St. Petersburg paradox.","Falahati, Kazem",Journal of Risk and Financial Management,551,22

We quantified access to public parks and gardens in urban areas of England and Wales, and the potential for park crowdedness during periods of high use. We combined data from the Office for National Statistics and Ordnance Survey to quantify (i) the number of parks within 500 and 1,000 metres of urban postcodes (i.e., availability), (ii) the distance of postcodes to the nearest park (i.e., accessibility), and (iii) per-capita space in each park for people living within 1,000m. We examined variability by city and share of flats. Around 25.4 million people (~87%) can access public parks or gardens within a ten-minute walk, while 3.8 million residents (~13%) live farther away; of these 21% are children and 13% are elderly. Areas with a higher share of flats on average are closer to a park but people living in these areas visit parks that are potentially overcrowded during periods of high use. Such disparity in urban areas of England and Wales becomes particularly evident during COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown when local parks, the only available out-of-home space option, hinder social distancing requirements. Cities aiming to facilitate social distancing while keeping public green spaces safe might require implementing measures such as dedicated park times for different age groups or entry allocation systems that, combined with smartphone apps or drones, can monitor and manage the total number of people using the park.","Shoari, Niloofar; Ezzati, Majid; Baumgartner, Jill; Malacarne, Diego; Fecht, Daniela",PLoS One,551,0

METHODS: The clinical data of 187 patients with COVID-19 seen between January 20, 2020 and March 5, 2020 at the First Hospital of Changsha were retrospectively analyzed. The differences in the ABO blood group distribution between COVID-19 patients and the control group (1991 cases) were analyzed. The relationship between blood type and clinical characteristics was analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 187 patients with COVID-19, 69 had type A (36.90%), 63 had type B (33.69%), 41 had type O (21.92%), and 14 had type AB blood (7.49%). The proportion of patients with type A blood in the COVID-19 group was significantly higher than that in the control group (36.90% vs. 27.47%, P = 0.006), while the proportion of patients with type O blood in the COVID-19 group was significantly lower than that in the control group (21.92% vs. 30.19%, P = 0.018). The risk of COVID-19 was higher for individuals with blood group A than for those with blood group O (OR = 1.849, 95% CI = 1.228-2.768, P = 0.003). The risk of COVID-19 was higher for patients with blood group A than for those with a blood group other than A (OR = 1.544, 95% CI = 1.122-2.104, P = 0.006).

The ABO blood group distribution was related to COVID-19 status. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with blood group A had an increased risk for infection with SARS-CoV-2, whereas blood group O was associated with a decreased risk, indicating that certain ABO blood groups were correlated with SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility.

Here, we report the increase of specificity of isothermal amplification in the presence of poly (aspartic) acids (pAsp). We hypothesized that side reactions occur due to the binding of the phosphate backbone of synthesized DNA strands with surface amino groups of the polymerase, and weakly acidic polyelectrolytes could shield polymerase molecules from DNA and thereby inhibit nonspecific amplification. Suppression of nonspecific polymerase activity by pAsp was studied on multimerization as a model side reaction. It was found that a low concentration of pAsp (0.01%) provides successful amplification of specific DNA targets. The inhibitory effect of pAsp is due to its polymeric structure since aspartic acid did affect neither specific nor nonspecific amplification. Strongly acidic polyelectrolyte heparin does not possess the same selectivity since it suppresses any DNA synthesis. The applicability of pAsp to prevent nonspecific reactions and reliable detection of the specific target has been demonstrated on the genetic material of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus using Loop-mediated isothermal amplification.","Sakhabutdinova, Assol R; Kamalov, Marat I; Salakhieva, Diana V; Mavzyutov, Ayrat R; Garafutdinov, Ravil R",Anal Biochem,551,27

We hypothesized that patient preparedness would be equivalent after preoperative counseling phone calls versus preoperative counseling office visits before prolapse surgery. METHODS: This was an equivalence randomized controlled trial of women undergoing pelvic organ prolapse surgery. Participants were randomized to receive standardized counseling via a preoperative phone call or office visit. The primary outcome was patient preparedness measured on a 5-point Likert scale by the Patient Preparedness Questionnaire at the postoperative visit. A predetermined equivalence margin of 20% was used. Two 1-sided tests for equivalence were used for the primary outcome. RESULTS: We randomized 120 women. The study was concluded early because of COVID-19 and subsequent surgery cancellations. There were 85 participants with primary outcome data (43 offices, 42 phones). Mean age was 62.0 years (±1.0) and 64 (75.3%) had stage III or stage IV prolapse. The primary outcome, patient preparedness measured at the postoperative visit, was equivalent between groups (office, n = 43 [97.7%]; phone, n = 42 [97.6%], P < 0.001). Most women reported they would have preferred a phone call (n = 66, 65.5%) with more women in the phone group expressing this preference than the office group (office 40.5% vs phone 90.5%, P < 0.001). Ultimately, nearly all women (96.5%) were satisfied with their method of counseling. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative counseling phone calls were equivalent to office visits for patient preparedness for pelvic organ prolapse surgery. This study demonstrates patient acceptance of phone calls for preoperative counseling. Telehealth modalities should be considered as an option for preoperative patient counseling.","Sassani, Jessica C; Grosse, Philip J; Kunkle, Lauren; Baranski, Lindsey; Ackenbom, Mary F",Female pelvic med. reconstr. surg.

As cellular mechanisms of taste learning, long-term potentiation (LTP) at glutamatergic synapses is well studied. However, little is known about long-term changes of synaptic efficacy at GABAergic synapses in the insular cortex. Here, we examined the synaptic mechanisms of long-term plasticity at GABAergic synapses in layer V pyramidal neurons of the mouse insular cortex. In response to a prolonged high-frequency stimulation (HFS), GABAergic synapses displayed endocannabinod (eCB)-mediated long-term depression (LTDGABA). When cannabinoid 1 receptors (CB1Rs) were blocked by a CB1R antagonist, the same stimuli caused LTP at GABAergic synapses (LTPGABA) which was mediated by production of nitric oxide (NO) via activation of NMDA receptors. Intriguingly, NO signaling was necessary for the induction of LTDGABA. In the presence of leptin which blocks CB1 signaling, the prolonged HFS caused LTPGABA which was mediated by NO signaling. These results indicate that long-term plasticity at GABAergic synapses in the insular cortex can be modulated by combined effects of eCB and NO signaling. These forms of GABAergic synaptic plasticity in the insular cortex may be crucial synaptic mechanisms in taste learning.","Toyoda, Hiroki",Sci Rep,551,27

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients who visited the paediatric department clinic during the observed period were included in this study. The patient's demographic data, purpose of visit, and treatment type were evaluated retrospectively from patient examination records. The Pearson chi-square and t-tests were used for comprehensive statistical analysis. RESULTS: A total of 1454 patient files (1184/270 cases from non-pandemic/pandemic period) were assessed. A significant reduction was found in aggregated emergency/non-emergency visits during the pandemic period (p < 0.01). During the pandemic, average daily visits for emergency dental care were observed to have a decrease to half of the non-pandemic period. Non-emergency routine dental visits have also exhibited a drastic decline. Severe dental pain due to pulpal inflammation and abscess/swelling were the most frequently reported urgent dental complaints that patients applied to the paediatric dental clinic during the pandemic period. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 pandemic has a significant influence on patients' attendance to paediatric dental clinic. Therefore, concerning a potential post-pandemic increase in treatment demand, meticulous future planning and proper regulation of dental care should be provided for better oral health and children's quality of life. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This study's importance is the observation of dramatically reduced number of patient visits during the pandemic period which may yield increased number of oral health-related complications in the long run.","Üstün, Nilüfer; Akgöl, Beyza Balli; Bayram, Merve",Clin. oral investig,551,20

DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: During custody in France, a medical consultation is provided for any patient who requests it. In the Paris area, this consultation is carried out by a practitioner in forensic medicine, based in a general hospital. Usually, most medical consultations for patients in custody take place directly in police stations. With the COVID-19 outbreak, the authors chose to suspend this activity, asking law enforcement to bring patients directly to their hospitals. Patients presenting with severe infections or indicative symptoms of the severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 infection and a comorbidity are tested for COVID-19. Such patients remain hospitalized until results of the test are received. If the result is positive, they are hospitalized for the length of their custody. If sent to prison, they are transferred to a medical facility in detention. FINDINGS: From the onset of the outbreak, the authors observed increased pressure from law enforcement to obtain medical information.

We show that SARS-CoV-2 spike binds biliverdin and bilirubin, the tetrapyrrole products of heme metabolism, with nanomolar affinity. Using cryo-electron microscopy and x-ray crystallography, we mapped the tetrapyrrole interaction pocket to a deep cleft on the spike N-terminal domain (NTD). At physiological concentrations, biliverdin significantly dampened the reactivity of SARS-CoV-2 spike with immune sera and inhibited a subset of neutralizing antibodies. Access to the tetrapyrrole-sensitive epitope is gated by a flexible loop on the distal face of the NTD. Accompanied by profound conformational changes in the NTD, antibody binding requires relocation of the gating loop, which folds into the cleft vacated by the metabolite. Our results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 spike NTD harbors a dominant epitope, access to which can be controlled by an allosteric mechanism that is regulated through recruitment of a metabolite.","Rosa, Annachiara; Pye, Valerie E; Graham, Carl; Muir, Luke; Seow, Jeffrey; Ng, Kevin W; Cook, Nicola J; Rees-Spear, Chloe; Parker, Eleanor; Dos Santos, Mariana Silva; Rosadas, Carolina; Susana, Alberto; Rhys, Hefin; Nans, Andrea; Masino, Laura; Roustan, Chloe; Christodoulou, Evangelos; Ulferts, Rachel; Wrobel, Antoni G; Short, Charlotte-Eve; Fertleman, Michael; Sanders, Rogier W; Heaney, Judith; Spyer, Moira; Kjær, Svend; Riddell, Andy; Malim, Michael H; Beale, Rupert; MacRae, James I; Taylor, Graham P; Nastouli, Eleni; van Gils, Marit J; Rosenthal, Peter B; Pizzato, Massimo; McClure, Myra O; Tedder, Richard S; Kassiotis, George; McCoy, Laura E; Doores, Katie J; Cherepanov, Peter",Sci.

The questions we address are these: (1) Will the ICU capacity in Chicago be exceeded, and if so by how much? (2) Can strong mitigation strategies, such as lockdown or shelter in place order, prevent the overflow of capacity? (3) When should such strategies be implemented? Our answers are as follows: (1) The ICU capacity may be exceeded by a large amount, probably by a factor of ten. (2) Strong mitigation can avert this emergency situation potentially, but even that will not work if implemented too late. (3) If the strong mitigation precedes April 1st, then the growth of COVID-19 can be controlled and the ICU capacity could be adequate. The earlier the strong mitigation is implemented, the greater the probability that it will be successful. After around April 1 2020, any strong mitigation will not avert the emergency situation. In Italy, the lockdown occurred too late and the number of deaths is still doubling every 2.3 days. It is difficult to be sure about the precise dates for this window of opportunity, due to the inherent uncertainties in computer simulation. But there is high confidence in the main conclusion that it exists and will soon be closed. Our conclusion is that, being fully cognizant of the societal trade-offs, there is a rapidly closing window of opportunity to avert a worst-case scenario in Chicago, but only with strong mitigation/lockdown implemented in the next week at the latest. If this window is missed, the epidemic will get worse and then strong mitigation/lockdown will be required after all, but it will be too late.","Maslov, Sergei; Goldenfeld, Nigel",,551,18

Evidence prior to the COVID-19 pandemic suggested that, compared with conventional ventilation strategies, airway pressure release ventilation (APRV) can improve oxygenation and reduce mortality in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. We aimed to assess the association between APRV use and clinical outcomes among adult patients receiving mechanical ventilation for COVID-19 and hypothesized that APRV use would be associated with improved survival compared with conventional ventilation. Methods: A total of 25 patients with COVID-19 pneumonitis was admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) for invasive ventilation in Perth, Western Australia, between February and May 2020. Eleven of these patients received APRV. The primary outcome was survival to day 90. Secondary outcomes were ventilation-free survival days to day 90, mechanical complications from ventilation, and number of days ventilated. Results: Patients who received APRV had a lower probability of survival than did those on other forms of ventilation (hazard ratio, 0.17; 95% confidence interval, 0.03-0.89; P=0.036). This finding was independent of indices of severity of illness to predict the use of APRV. Patients who received APRV also had fewer ventilator-free survival days up to 90 days after initiation of ventilation compared to patients who did not receive APRV, and survivors who received APRV had fewer ventilator-free days than survivors who received other forms of ventilation. There were no differences in mechanical complications according to mode of ventilation. Conclusion: Based on the findings of this study, we urge caution with the use of APRV in COVID-19.","Zorbas, John S; Ho, Kwok M; Litton, Edward; Wibrow, Bradley; Fysh, Edward; Anstey, Matthew H",,551,16

While the landscape of diagnostics is rapidly evolving, PCR remains the gold-standard of nucleic acid-based diagnostic assays, in part due to its reliability, flexibility and wide deployment. To address a critical local shortage of testing capacity persisting during the COVID-19 outbreak, our hospital set up a molecular-based laboratory developed test (LDT) to accurately and safely diagnose SARS-CoV-2.

However, the lack of adequate scientific work on Covid-19 should prompt us to be even more cautious when handling potentially infected persons or materials. Before starting the post-mortem investigation a risk assessment should be carried out and the suitability of facilities, personnel and equipment should be evaluated. An autopsy room conforming to BSL 3 standards would be ideal but is not mandatory. For suspicious or approved cases however a number of procedural changes must be made concerning the body's removal, storage and inspection procedures.

CIN's aim was to examine important outcomes of hospitalisation at scale, identify and ultimately solve practical problems of service delivery, drive improvements in quality and test interventions. By including multiple routine settings in research, we aimed to promote generalisability of findings and demonstrate potential efficiencies derived from LHS. We illustrate the nature and range of research CIN has supported over the past 7 years as a form of LHS. Clinically, this has largely focused on common, serious paediatric illnesses such as pneumonia, malaria and diarrhoea with dehydration with recent extensions to neonatal illnesses. CIN also enables examination of the quality of care, for example that provided to children with severe malnutrition and the challenges encountered in routine settings in adopting simple technologies (pulse oximetry) and more advanced diagnostics (eg, Xpert MTB/RIF). Although regular feedback to hospitals has been associated with some improvements in quality data continue to highlight system challenges that undermine provision of basic, quality care (eg, poor access to blood glucose testing and routine microbiology). These challenges include those associated with increased mortality risk (eg, delays in blood transfusion). Using the same data the CIN platform has enabled conduct of randomised trials and supports malaria vaccine and most recently COVID-19 surveillance. Employing LHS principles has meant engaging front-line workers, clinical managers and national stakeholders throughout.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this review is to update the monthly COVID-19 and rehabilitation literature research up to September 30th, 2020. METHODS: Methodology described in the second edition of the rapid living systematic review 2020 conducted by Cochrane Rehabilitation REH-COVER Action was applied. The most important medical databases were searched, and papers related to COVID19 and rehabilitation were retrieved and summarized descriptively. RESULTS: The database search retrieved 2526 publications. Duplicates were removed, and 1150 unique records were screened for inclusion. After screening titles, abstracts and full-texts, 37 papers were included in the present review. According to OCEBM 2011 Levels of Evidence Table, most studies (78.4%) fall within the level of evidence 4 category, while the remainder (22.6%) are categorized as level of evidence 3. Most studies described patients in acute (51.4%) or subacute (35.0%) phase, while no studies described the chronic consequences of COVID-19. Just one study dealt with rehabilitation interventions regarding COVID-19, and two discussed reorganization of rehabilitative services. CONCLUSIONS: The most recently published COVID-19 research focuses more on describing the clinical presentations and the natural history of the pathology, rather than rehabilitation interventions or service delivery. Studies with high levels of evidence regarding the efficacy of interventions, longterm monitoring, or new organization models remain lacking.","Andrenelli, Elisa; Negrini, Francesco; De Sire, Alessandro; Patrini, Michele; Lazzarini, Stefano G; Ceravolo, Maria Gabriella",Eur. j. phys. rehabil. med.

Ubiquitination yields various products, including mono- and poly-ubiquitinated substrates, as well as unanchored poly-ubiquitin chains whose accumulation is considered toxic. We previously showed that transgenic, unanchored poly-ubiquitin is not problematic in Drosophila melanogaster. In the fruit fly, free chains exist in various lengths and topologies and are degraded by the proteasome; they are also conjugated onto other proteins as one unit, eliminating them from the free ubiquitin chain pool. Here, to further explore the notion of unanchored chain toxicity, we examined when free poly-ubiquitin might become problematic. We found that unanchored chains can be highly toxic if they resemble linear poly-ubiquitin that cannot be modified into other topologies. These species upregulate NF-&#954;B signaling, and modulation of the levels of NF-&#954;B components reduces toxicity. In additional studies, we show that toxicity from untethered, linear chains is regulated by isoleucine 44, which anchors a key interaction site for ubiquitin. We conclude that free ubiquitin chains can be toxic, but only in uncommon circumstances, such as when the ability of cells to modify and regulate them is markedly restricted.","Blount, Jessica R; Libohova, Kozeta; Silva, Gustavo M; Todi, Sokol V",,551,1

Additionally, the current COVID-19 pandemic has placed substantial limitations on surgical training worldwide. Contact free, remote, web-based, validated learning tools which are easily accessible and allows repeated, sustained practice are the need of the hour. Cognitive Task Analysis (CTA) have been used extensively to train pilots and military personnel and has shown excellent early results within orthopaedic training. We designed a femoral nailing CTA tool which showed objective benefits in the enhancement of cognitive knowledge in medical students. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of this CTA tool to enhance practical skills in orthopaedic trainees in a real time interactive simulation setting (Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS)). METHODS: This was a double blinded, randomized controlled trial. 14 junior orthopaedic residents who met the inclusion criteria were recruited in the study. They were randomized into two equal groups. The intervention group were given the CTA learning tool, the control group were given a standard operative technique manual used for antegrade femoral intramedullary nailing. The participants were assessed on a high-fidelity phantom femur model with actual femoral nailing instruments in a simulation mobile operating theatre where the candidate had a simulation patient, an acting anesthetist and a scrub nurse (DIS). They were assessed using the modified Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills (OSATS) rating scale which has been validated for orthopaedic trauma. RESULTS: The median OSATS score in the intervention group was 49 (±4.93, range 39-55) compared to 17 in the control group (±14.98, range 12-51). The median improvement was by 32 points (p = 0.02). The ICC between the two raters was 0.977. CONCLUSIONS: This study has demonstrated objective benefits of a novel femoral nailing CTA tool in the enhancement of practical skills for junior trainees in the DIS setting. This adds to the growing evidence supporting the use of CTA in orthopaedic training. This tool can be accessed remotely, is contact free and allows repeated sustained practice which is key in simulation training.","Bhattacharyya, Rahul; Al-Obaidi, Bilal; Sugand, Kapil; Bhattacharya, Rajarshi; Gupte, Chinmay M",Injury,551,13

Design/methodology/approach The study first explains the effects of COVID-19 on the supply chains of business entities. It then explains the role of accounting information in supply chain management, questions accounting information's ability to play such a role, and makes recommendations for better accounting disclosures and accounting research for supply chains of firms. To illustrate the salient points, a case study of Fisher and Paykel Healthcare is conducted. It identifies the risks and uncertainties of supply chains exposed by COVID-19 disruptions to businesses. Findings COVID-19 has affected Fisher and Paykel Healthcare from both the supply-side (upstream) and demand-side (downstream) perspectives. On the supply side, it has disrupted the supply of raw materials used in the manufacture of respiratory devices and the costs of importing such materials. On the demand side, it has disrupted market logistics and customer demand. This has subsequently affected production. Such disruptions can be overcome through the dissemination of appropriate accounting information for the different stages of the supply chain to the managers. Such accounting information can also be useful to external stakeholders for minimizing their risks. Originality/value The study attempts to create an awareness of the supply chain uncertainties faced by managers and stakeholders arising from exogenous shocks, such as a pandemic, and how these uncertainties can be mitigated by aligning accounting information flows with the supply chain activity flows. The observations made in this paper are at a conceptual level and, therefore, can be applied to any industry.","Velayutham, A.; Rahman, A.

The involved protective mechanisms include blood glucose-dependent and -independent mechanisms: SGLT2 inhibitors prevent both hyper- and hypoglycemia, with expectedly little net effect on HbA1C. Metabolic adaptations to induced urinary glucose loss include reduced fat mass and more ketone bodies as additional fuel. SGLT2 inhibitors lower glomerular capillary hypertension and hyperfiltration, thereby reducing the physical stress on the filtration barrier, albuminuria, and the oxygen demand for tubular reabsorption. This improves cortical oxygenation, which, together with lesser tubular gluco-toxicity, may preserve tubular function and glomerular filtration rate in the long term. SGLT2 inhibitors may mimic systemic hypoxia and stimulate erythropoiesis, which improves organ oxygen delivery.

Indeed, quality management is an especially important aspect and has achieved great milestones during the development of clinical laboratories. CURRENT STATUS: However, since the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues to be a threat worldwide, previous management mode inside the separate laboratory could not cater to the demand of the COVID-19 public health emergency. Among emerging new issues, the prominent challenges during the period of COVID-19 pandemic are rapid-launched laboratory-developed tests (LDTs) for urgent clinical application, rapid expansion of testing capabilities, laboratory medicine resources, and personnel shortages. These related issues are now impacting on clinical laboratory and need to be effectively addressed. CONCLUSION: Different from traditional views of laboratory medicine management that focus on separate laboratories, present clinical laboratory management must be multidimensional mode which should consider consolidation of the efficient network of regional clinical laboratories and reasonable planning of laboratories resources from the view of overall strategy. Based on relevant research and our experience, in this review, we retrospect the history trajectory of laboratory medicine management, and also, we provide existing and other feasible recommended management strategies for laboratory medicine in future.","Luo, YunTao; Wang, JingHua; Zhang, MinMin; Wang, QingZhong; Chen, Rong; Wang, XueLiang; Wang, HuaLiang",J Clin Lab Anal,551,5

Here we perform reverse transcription lesion-induced DNA amplification (RT-LIDA), an isothermal amplification method that only requires T4 DNA ligase. RT-LIDA involves the RNA-templated ligation of DNA primers to form complementary DNA (cDNA) followed by toehold-mediated strand displacement of the cDNA and its exponential amplification via our isothermal ligase chain reaction LIDA. Each step is tuned to proceed at 28 °C, which falls within the range of global room temperatures.

Rapidly escalated into a worldwide pandemic, it has caused an unprecedented and devastating situation on the global public health and society economy. The severity of recent coronavirus disease, abbreviated to COVID-19, seems to be mostly associated with the patients' immune response. In this vein, mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (MSCs) have been suggested as a worth-considering option against COVID-19 as their therapeutic properties are mainly displayed in immunomodulation and anti-inflammatory effects. Indeed, administration of MSCs can attenuate cytokine storm and enhance alveolar fluid clearance, endothelial recovery, and anti-fibrotic regeneration. Despite advantages attributed to MSCs application in lung injuries, there are still several issues __foremost probability of malignant transformation and incidence of MSCs-related coagulopathy__ which should be resolved for the successful application of MSC therapy in COVID-19. In the present study, we review the historical evidence of successful use of MSCs and MSC-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) in the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). We also take a look at MSCs mechanisms of action in the treatment of viral infections, and then through studying both the dark and bright sides of this approach, we provide a thorough discussion if MSC therapy might be a promising therapeutic approach in COVID-19 patients.","Moradinasab, Susan; Pourbagheri-Sigaroodi, Atieh; Zafari, Parisa; Ghaffari, Seyed H; Bashash, Davood",Int Immunopharmacol,551,26

This scoping review focused on answering key questions about the focus, quality and generalisability of the quantitative evidence on the determinants of adherence to social distancing measures in research during the first wave of COVID-19. METHODS: This scoping review is pre-registered with Open Science Framework, and the protocol has been published. Literature searches were conducted using online databases and grey literature sources. Screening, data extraction and quality appraisal was conducted by members of the research team, with discrepancies resolved by consensus discussion. Quality appraisal was conducted using the Cochrane's ROBINS-I tool, the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool, and the JBI Critical Appraisal Checklist. The potential determinants of adherence to social distancing measures examined in the included studies were coded to domains and constructs of the Theoretical Domains Framework. RESULTS: The review included 84 studies. The majority of included studies were conducted in Western Europe and the USA. Many lacked theoretical input, were at risk for bias, and few were experimental in design. The most commonly coded domains of the TDF in the included studies were 'Environmental Context and Resources' (388 codes across 76 studies), 'Beliefs about Consequences' (34 codes across 21 studies), 'Emotion' (28 codes across 12 studies), and 'Social Influences' (26 codes across 16 studies). The least frequently coded TDF domains included 'Optimism' (not coded), 'Intentions' (coded once), 'Goals' (2 codes across 2 studies), 'Reinforcement' (3 codes across 2 studies), and 'Behavioural Regulation' (3 codes across 3 studies). CONCLUSIONS: Examining the focus of the included studies identified few studies using experimental designs to test methods of increasing adherence to social distancing measures and a lack of studies on potentially important determinants of adherence such as reinforcement, goal setting and self-monitoring. The quality of the included studies was variable and their generalisablity was threatened by their reliance on convenience samples.","Noone, Chris; Warner, Nikolett Z; Byrne, Molly; Durand, Hannah; Lavoie, Kim L; McGuire, Brian E; McSharry, Jenny; Meade, Oonagh; Morrissey, Eimear; Molloy, Gerard J; O039,; Connor, Laura; Toomey, Elaine",Health Psychol Rev,551,24

A telegenetics platform is critical for those with limitations or vulnerabilities compromising their ability to attend clinic in-person, including individuals in rural areas. As the demand for remote genetics services increases, and amidst the COVID-19 pandemic with social distancing practices in place, we conducted a literature review to examine the benefits and limitations of telegenetics and explore the views of patients and health professionals utilizing telegenetics. Searches of the PubMed database identified 21 relevant primary studies for inclusion. The majority of studies found acceptability of telegenetics to be high among patients and health professionals and that telegenetics provided access to genetics services for underserved communities. The main benefits cited include cost-effectiveness and reduction in travel time for genetics services providing outreach clinics and patients who would otherwise travel long distances to access genetics. Patients appreciated the convenience of telegenetics including the reduced wait times, although a minority of patients reported their psychosocial needs were not adequately met. Eight studies compared outcomes between telegenetics and in-person services; findings suggested when comparing telegenetics patients to their in-person counterparts, telegenetics patients had a similar level of knowledge and understanding of genetics and similar psychological outcomes. Some studies reported challenges related to establishing rapport and reading and responding to verbal cues via telegenetics, while technical issues were not generally found to be a major limitation. Some service adaptations, for example, counseling strategies, may be required to successfully deliver telegenetics. Further research may be necessary to gather and examine data on how telegenetics outcomes compare to that of in-person genetic counseling and adapt services accordingly.","Gorrie, Anita; Gold, Judy; Cameron, Carolyn; Krause, Molly; Kincaid, Helen",J. genet. couns,551,16

However, there are limited prospectively-collected data on assay performance, and minimal clinical information to guide interpretation of discrepant results. METHODS: Over a 2-week period, 1080 consecutive plasma samples submitted for clinical SARS-CoV-2 IgG testing were tested in parallel for anti-nucleocapsid IgG (anti-N, Abbott) and anti-spike IgG (anti-S1, EUROIMMUN). Chart review was conducted for samples testing positive or borderline on either assay, and for an age/sex-matched cohort of samples negative by both assays. CDC surveillance case definitions were used to determine clinical sensitivity/specificity and conduct receiver operating characteristics curve analysis. RESULTS: There were 52 samples positive by both methods, 2 positive for anti-N only, 34 positive for anti-S1 only, and 27 borderline for anti-S1. Of the 34 individuals positive for anti-S1 alone, 8 (24%) had confirmed COVID-19. No anti-S1 borderline cases were positive for anti-N or had confirmed/probable COVID-19. The anti-N assay was less sensitive (84.2% [95% CI 72.1-92.5%] vs 94.7% [95% CI 85.4-98.9%]) but more specific (99.2% [95% CI 95.5-100%] vs 86.9% [95% CI 79.6-92.3%]) than anti-S1. Abbott anti-N sensitivity could be improved to 96.5% with minimal effect on specificity if the index threshold was lowered from 1.4 to 0.6. CONCLUSION: Real-world concordance between different serologic assays may be lower than previously described in retrospective studies. These findings have implications for the interpretation of SARS-CoV-2 IgG results, especially with the advent of spike antigen-targeted vaccination, as a subset of patients with true infection are anti-N negative and anti-S1 positive.","Wang, Hannah; Wiredja, Danica; Yang, Lu; Bulterys, Philip L; Costales, Cristina; Röltgen, Katharina; Manalac, Justin; Yee, Jennifer; Zehnder, James; Shi, Run Zhang; Boyd, Scott D; Pinsky, Benjamin A",Clin Chem,551,26

We aimed to determine whether clinical phenotypes of patients with COVID-19 can be derived from clinical data, to assess the reproducibility of these phenotypes and correlation with prognosis, and to derive and validate a simplified probabilistic model for phenotype assignment. Phenotype identification was not primarily intended as a predictive tool for mortality. METHODS: In this study, we used data from two cohorts: the COVID-19@Spain cohort, a retrospective cohort including 4035 consecutive adult patients admitted to 127 hospitals in Spain with COVID-19 between Feb 2 and March 17, 2020, and the COVID-19@HULP cohort, including 2226 consecutive adult patients admitted to a teaching hospital in Madrid between Feb 25 and April 19, 2020. The COVID-19@Spain cohort was divided into a derivation cohort, comprising 2667 randomly selected patients, and an internal validation cohort, comprising the remaining 1368 patients. The COVID-19@HULP cohort was used as an external validation cohort. A probabilistic model for phenotype assignment was derived in the derivation cohort using multinomial logistic regression and validated in the internal validation cohort. The model was also applied to the external validation cohort. 30-day mortality and other prognostic variables were assessed in the derived phenotypes and in the phenotypes assigned by the probabilistic model. FINDINGS: Three distinct phenotypes were derived in the derivation cohort (n=2667)-phenotype A (516 [19%] patients), phenotype B (1955 [73%]) and phenotype C (196 [7%])-and reproduced in the internal validation cohort (n=1368)-phenotype A (233 [17%] patients), phenotype B (1019 [74%]), and phenotype C (116 [8%]). Patients with phenotype A were younger, were less frequently male, had mild viral symptoms, and had normal inflammatory parameters. Patients with phenotype B included more patients with obesity, lymphocytopenia, and moderately elevated inflammatory parameters. Patients with phenotype C included older patients with more comorbidities and even higher inflammatory parameters than phenotype B. We developed a simplified probabilistic model (validated in the internal validation cohort) for phenotype assignment, including 16 variables. In the derivation cohort, 30-day mortality rates were 2·5% (95% CI 1·4-4·3) for patients with phenotype A, 30·5% (28·5-32·6) for patients with phenotype B, and 60·7% (53·7-67·2) for patients with phenotype C (log-rank test p<0·0001). The predicted phenotypes in the internal validation cohort and external validation cohort showed similar mortality rates to the assigned phenotypes (internal validation cohort: 5·3% [95% CI 3·4-8·1] for phenotype A, 31·3% [28·5-34·2] for phenotype B, and 59·5% [48·8-69·3] for phenotype C; external validation cohort: 3·7% [2·0-6·4] for phenotype A, 23·7% [21·8-25·7] for phenotype B, and 51·4% [41·9-60·7] for phenotype C). INTERPRETATION: Patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 can be classified into three phenotypes that correlate with mortality. We developed and validated a simplified tool for the probabilistic assignment of patients into phenotypes. These results might help to better classify patients for clinical management, but the pathophysiological mechanisms of the phenotypes must be investigated.

Analysis of these mutations is necessary for gaining knowledge regarding different aspects of therapeutic development. Previously, we have reported a Sanger method-based genome sequence of a viral isolate named SARS-CoV-2 NIB-1, circulating in Bangladesh. The genome has four novel non-synonymous mutations in V121D, V843F, A889V, and G1691C positions. RESULTS: Using different computational tools, we have found V121D substitution has the potential to destabilize the non-structural protein-1 (NSP-1). NSP-1 inactivates the type-1 interferon-induced antiviral system. Hence, this mutant could be a basis of attenuated vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. V843F, A889V, and G1691C are all located in nonstructural protein-3 (NSP-3). G1691C can decrease the flexibility of the protein. V843F and A889V might change the binding pattern and efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 papain-like protease (PLPro) inhibitor GRL0617. V843F substitution in PLPro was the most prevalent mutation in the clinical samples. This mutation showed a reduced affinity for interferon-stimulated gene-15 protein (ISG-15) and might have an impact on innate immunity and viral spread. However, V843F+A889V double mutant exhibited the same binding affinity as wild type PLPro. A possible reason behind this phenomenon can be that V843F is a conserved residue of PLPro which damaged the protease structure, but A889V, a less conserved residue, presumably neutralized that damage. CONCLUSIONS: Mutants of NSP-1 could provide attenuated vaccines against coronavirus. Also, these mutations of PLPro might be targeted to develop better anti-SARS therapeutics. We hope our study will help to get better insides during the development of attenuated vaccine and PLPro inhibitors.","Hossain, Mohammad Uzzal; Bhattacharjee, Arittra; Emon, Md Tabassum Hossain; Chowdhury, Zeshan Mahmud; Ahammad, Ishtiaque; Mosaib, Md Golam; Moniruzzaman, Md; Rahman, Md Hadisur; Islam, Md Nazrul; Ahmed, Irfan; Amin, Md Ruhul; Rashed, Asif; Das, Keshob Chandra; Keya, Chaman Ara; Salimullah, Md",J Genet Eng Biotechnol,551,28

Some of the elements to support the construction industry to move toward IR 4.0 are discussed in this paper including Building Information Modeling (BIM), the use of drone or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAE) to monitor construction site, virtual meeting among stakeholders and the use of prefabrication works such as Industrial Building System (IBS). Systematic and efficient construction works can be achieved by implementing the elements of IR 4.0 in construction industry. © 2021 American Institute of Physics Inc.. All rights reserved.","Lat, D.

The purpose of this study is to use the electronic tongue to design the additives of the 3D printed IDTs to improve palatability. METHODS: A binder jet 3D printer was used to prepare IDTs of levetiracetam. A texture analyzer and dissolution apparatus were used to predict the oral dispersion time and in vitro drug release of IDTs, respectively. The palatability of different formulations was investigated using the ASTREE electronic tongue in combination with the design of experiment and a model for masking bitter taste. Human gustatory sensation tests were conducted to further evaluate the credibility of the results. RESULTS: The 3D printed tablets exhibited rapid dispersion (<30 s) and drug release (2.5 min > 90%). The electronic tongue had an excellent ability of taste discrimination, and levetiracetam had a good linear sensing performance based on a partial least square regression analysis. The principal component analysis was used to analyze the signal intensities of different formulations and showed that 2% sucralose and 0.5% spearmint flavoring masked the bitterness well and resembled the taste of corresponding placebo. The results of human gustatory sensation test were consistent with the trend of the electronic tongue evaluation. CONCLUSIONS: Owing to its objectivity and reproducibility, this technique is suitable for the design and evaluation of palatability in 3D printed IDT development.","Wang, Zengming; Li, Jingru; Hong, Xiaoxuan; Han, Xiaolu; Liu, Boshi; Li, Xianfu; Zhang, Hui; Gao, Jing; Liu, Nan; Gao, Xiang; Zheng, Aiping",Pharm.

Therefore, the goal of this study is to analyze the effect of the COVID-19 outbreak on agricultural food and provide policy recommendations based on SWOT analysis to minimize risks. Data from the Food and Agriculture Organization and the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics were used for this study with a thorough literature review containing policy documents and scientific magazines in the related sector. There is enough evidence to demonstrate that the COVID-19 pandemic has had a massive influence on agricultural food supply, largely impacting food demand as well as food insecurity. The study uses SWOT analysis to identify the highest-priority policies that may remediate the current issues. Key strategies include developing new online resources such as digitized trade and providing a digital platform to strengthen the buyer?supplier collaboration and lower the risk of food wastage and insecurity. The government should invest in technology that contributes to the sustainable flow of agricultural products along the supply chain to prevent food crises during the pandemic.","Abid, Ali Jie Shang",Food Frontiers,551,26

However, the U.S. physician workforce has relatively few Black physicians. Blacks comprise approximately 13% of the U.S. population but only 5% of practicing physicians. In this Invited Commentary, the authors caution that the COVID-19 pandemic may erode the meager progress that has been made in increasing the number of Black physicians. This loss of Black physicians may happen because Black patients are overrepresented among cases of COVID-19, Black physicians care for relatively more Black patients often in settings with less access to SARS-CoV-2 testing and personal protective equipment, and Black physicians have more comorbid chronic conditions that increase their own susceptibility to mortality from COVID-19. All organizations in which physicians train and practice must redouble their efforts to recruit, train, and retain Black physicians. If nothing else, the COVID-19 pandemic must make academic health centers and health care systems recognize Black physicians as the precious resource they are and protect and reward them accordingly.","Filut, Amarette; Carnes, Molly",Acad Med,551,1

Social media is a popular source of information about health, including COVID-19 and testing information. One of the most popular communication channels used by adolescents and young adults who search for health information is TikTok-an emerging social media platform. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to describe TikTok videos related to COVID-19 testing. METHODS: The hashtag #covidtesting was searched, and the first 100 videos were included in the study sample. At the time the sample was drawn, these 100 videos garnered more than 50% of the views for all videos cataloged under the hashtag #covidtesting. The content characteristics that were coded included mentions, displays, or suggestions of anxiety, COVID-19 symptoms, quarantine, types of tests, results of test, and disgust/unpleasantness. Additional data that were coded included the number and percentage of views, likes, and comments and the use of music, dance, and humor. RESULTS: The 100 videos garnered more than 103 million views; 111,000 comments; and over 12.8 million likes. Even though only 44 videos mentioned or suggested disgust/unpleasantness and 44 mentioned or suggested anxiety, those that portrayed tests as disgusting/unpleasant garnered over 70% of the total cumulative number of views (73,479,400/103,071,900, 71.29%) and likes (9,354,691/12,872,505, 72.67%), and those that mentioned or suggested anxiety attracted about 60% of the total cumulative number of views (61,423,500/103,071,900, 59.59%) and more than 8 million likes (8,339,598/12,872,505, 64.79%). Independent one-tailed t tests (&#945;=.05) revealed that videos that mentioned or suggested that COVID-19 testing was disgusting/unpleasant were associated with receiving a higher number of views and likes. CONCLUSIONS: Our finding of an association between TikTok videos that mentioned or suggested that COVID-19 tests were disgusting/unpleasant and these videos' propensity to garner views and likes is of concern. There is a need for public health agencies to recognize and address connotations of COVID-19 testing on social media.","Basch, Corey H; Mohlman, Jan; Fera, Joseph; Tang, Hao; Pellicane, Alessia; Basch, Charles E",JMIR Public Health Surveill,551,1

COVID-19 is caused by SARS-CoV-2, a novel coronavirus that leads to a variety of symptoms in humans, including cough, fever and respiratory failure. SARS-CoV-2 infection can trigger extensive immune responses, including the production of antibodies. The detection of antibody response by serological testing provides a supplementary diagnostic tool to molecular tests. We hereby present a succinct yet comprehensive review on the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as molecular mechanisms behind the strengths and limitations of serological antibody tests. The presence of antibodies can be detected in patient sera within days post symptom onset. Serological tests demonstrate superior sensitivity to molecular tests in some periods of time during disease development. Compared with the molecular tests, serological tests can be used for point-of-care testing, providing faster results at a lower cost. Commercially available serological tests show variable sensitivity and specificity, and the molecular basis of these variabilities are analysed. We discuss assays of different complexities that are used to specifically quantitate neutralising antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, which has important implications for vaccine development and herd immunity. Furthermore, we discuss examples of successful applications of serological tests to contact tracing and community-level sero-surveying, which provide invaluable information for pandemic management and assessment.","Jiang, Jiayue-Clara; Zhang, Yan",Biochem.

To minimize the risk of health problems, visitors should be able to access information on the health care systems of the places they visit. Most short-term overseas visitors are young adults. Although they are not very likely to get sick from noncommunicable diseases, they are at high risk for injury and often experience stomach ailments, fever, or nausea when travelling. The objective of this study is to evaluate culturally and linguistically appropriate health information on preventive health behaviours and the health care system in Japan. We will examine the level of satisfaction of overseas visitors to Japan with health care-related educational materials using a five-minute digital game named Sa-Chan Japan. METHODS: Our study is a randomized controlled trial (RCT). We will assess both satisfaction and motivation before, during, and after the interventions and examine the changes over time. The intervention group will comprise overseas visitors who will view and answer questions in an animation named Sa-Chan Japan. The control group will comprise overseas visitors who will watch an English digital animation named Mari Info Japan. We will recruit 1002 participants through the Macromill Internet portal. We will contact overseas visitors who have either visited or wish to visit Japan from the United Kingdom, United States, and Australia. The participants will fill out a self-administered questionnaire online in the first quarter of 2021. We will determine the participants' levels of satisfaction with the CSQ-8 (8-item Client Satisfaction Questionnaire). We will analyse the median score of the overseas visitors with both the Wilcoxon rank-sum and the Wilcoxon signed-rank tests.

Anticoagulation has been proposed as therapy to decrease mortality, often adjusted for illness severity. OBJECTIVE: We wanted to investigate whether anticoagulation improves survival in COVID-19 and if this improvement in survival is associated with disease severity. METHODS: This is a cohort study simulating an intention-to-treat clinical trial, by analyzing the effect on mortality of anticoagulation therapy chosen in the first 48 hours of hospitalization. We analyzed 3,625 COVID-19+ inpatients, controlling for age, gender, glomerular filtration rate, oxygen saturation, ventilation requirement, intensive care unit admission, and time period, all determined during the first 48 hours. RESULTS: Adjusted logistic regression analyses demonstrated a significant decrease in mortality with prophylactic use of apixaban (odds ratio [OR] 0.46, p = 0.001) and enoxaparin (OR = 0.49, p = 0.001). Therapeutic apixaban was also associated with decreased mortality (OR 0.57, p = 0.006) but was not more beneficial than prophylactic use when analyzed over the entire cohort or within D-dimer stratified categories. Higher D-dimer levels were associated with increased mortality (p < 0.0001). When adjusted for these same comorbidities within D-dimer strata, patients with D-dimer levels < 1 µg/mL did not appear to benefit from anticoagulation while patients with D-dimer levels > 10 µg/mL derived the most benefit. There was no increase in transfusion requirement with any of the anticoagulants used. CONCLUSION: We conclude that COVID-19+ patients with moderate or severe illness benefit from anticoagulation and that apixaban has similar efficacy to enoxaparin in decreasing mortality in this disease.","Billett, Henny H; Reyes-Gil, Morayma; Szymanski, James; Ikemura, Kenji; Stahl, Lindsay R; Lo, Yungtai; Rahman, Shafia; Gonzalez-Lugo, Jesus D; Kushnir, Margarita; Barouqa, Mohammad; Golestaneh, Ladan; Bellin, Eran",Thromb. haemost,551,26

Studies that evaluate the outcome of this rapid teletherapy adoption and implementation are pertinent. OBJECTIVE: This single-arm, nonrandomized pilot study aimed to assess the feasibility and initial patient-level outcomes of a psychiatric transitional day program that switched from an in-person group to a video teletherapy group during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Patients with transdiagnostic conditions who were at risk of psychiatric hospitalization were referred to the Adult Transitions Program (ATP) at a large academic medical center in the United States. ATP was a 3-week intensive outpatient program that implemented group teletherapy guided by cognitive and behavioral principles delivered daily for 3 hours per day. Feasibility was assessed via retention, attendance rate, and rate of securing aftercare appointments prior to ATP discharge. Patients completed standardized patient-reported outcome measures at admission and discharge to assess the effectiveness of the program for improving quality of mental health, depression, anxiety, and suicide risk. RESULTS: Patients (N=76) started the program between March and August of 2020. Feasibility was established, with 70 of the 76 patients (92%) completing the program and a mean attendance of 14.43 days (SD 1.22); also, 71 patients (95%) scheduled at least one behavioral health aftercare service prior to ATP discharge. All patient-level reported outcomes demonstrated significant improvements in depression (95% CI -3.6 to -6.2; Cohen d=0.77; P<.001), anxiety (95% CI -3.0 to -4.9; Cohen d=0.74; P<.001), overall suicide risk (95% CI -0.5 to -0.1; Cohen d=0.41; P=.02), wish to live (95% CI 0.3 to 1.0; Cohen d=0.39; P<.001), wish to die (95% CI -0.2 to -1.4; Cohen d=0.52; P=.01), and overall mental health (95% CI 1.5 to 4.5; Cohen d=0.39; P<.001) from admission to discharge. CONCLUSIONS: Rapid adoption and implementation of a group-based teletherapy day program for adults at risk of psychiatric hospitalization appeared to be feasible and effective.

Best practice guidance on how to implement such programs is urgently needed. We describe the early experience in the City and County of San Francisco (CCSF), where the City's Department of Health expanded contact tracing capability in anticipation of changes in San Francisco's 'shelter in place' order between April and June 2020. Important prerequisites to successful scale-up included a rapid expansion of the COVID-19 response workforce, expansion of testing capability, and other containment resources. San Francisco's scale-up offers a model for how other jurisdictions can rapidly mobilize a workforce.

We aimed to evaluate the mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic using a mixed-methods design. METHODS: This longitudinal study drew from a preexisting sample of 957 adults living in Soweto, a major township near Johannesburg. Psychological assessments were administered across two waves between August 2019 and March 2020 and during the first 6 weeks of the lockdown (late March-early May 2020). Interviews on COVID-19 experiences were administered in the second wave. Multiple regression models examined relationships between perceived COVID-19 risk and depression. RESULTS: Full data on perceived COVID-19 risk, depression, and covariates were available in 221 adults. In total, 14.5% of adults were at risk for depression. Higher perceived COVID-19 risk predicted greater depressive symptoms (p < 0.001), particularly among adults with histories of childhood trauma, though this effect was marginally significant (p = 0.063). Adults were about two times more likely to experience significant depressive symptoms for every one unit increase in perceived COVID-19 risk (p = 0.021; 95% CI 1.10-3.39). Qualitative data identified potent experiences of anxiety, financial insecurity, fear of infection, and rumination. CONCLUSIONS: Higher perceived risk of COVID-19 infection is associated with greater depressive symptoms during the first 6 weeks of quarantine. High rates of severe mental illness and low availability of mental healthcare amidst COVID-19 emphasize the need for immediate and accessible psychological resources.","Kim, Andrew Wooyoung; Nyengerai, Tawanda; Mendenhall, Emily",Psychol Med,551,16

Challenges exist in patients accessing facial neuromuscular retraining (NMR), a therapy used to strengthen muscle and improve nerve function. Access to therapy could potentially be improved through the use of digital technology. However, there is limited research available on patients' and clinicians' views about the potential benefits of such telerehabilitation based on their lived experiences of treatment pathways. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to gather information about facial palsy treatment pathways in the United Kingdom, barriers to accessing NMR, factors influencing patient adherence, measures used to monitor recovery, and the potential value of emerging wearable digital technology. METHODS: Separate surveys of patients with facial palsy and facial therapy specialists were conducted. Questionnaires explored treatment pathways and views on telerehabilitation, were co-designed with users, and followed a similar format to enable cross-referencing of responses. A follow-up survey of national specialists investigated methods used to monitor recovery in greater detail. Analysis of quantitative data was conducted allowing for data distribution. Open-text responses were analyzed using thematic content analysis. RESULTS: A total of 216 patients with facial palsy and 25 specialist therapists completed the national surveys. Significant variations were observed in individual treatment pathways. Patients reported an average of 3.27 (SD 1.60) different treatments provided by various specialists, but multidisciplinary team reviews were rare. For patients diagnosed most recently, there was evidence of more rapid initial prescribing of corticosteroids (prednisolone) and earlier referral for NMR therapy. Barriers to NMR referral included difficulties accessing funding, shortage of specialist therapists, and limited awareness of NMR among general practitioners. Patients traveled long distances to reach an NMR specialist center; 9% (8/93) of adults reported traveling &#8805;115 miles. The thematic content analysis demonstrates positive attitudes to the introduction of digital technology, with similar incentives and barriers identified by both patients and clinicians. The follow-up survey of 28 specialists uncovered variations in the measures currently used to monitor recovery and no agreed definitions of a clinically significant change for any of these. The main barriers to NMR adherence identified by patients and therapists could all be addressed by using suitable real-time digital technology. CONCLUSIONS: The study findings provide valuable information on facial palsy treatment pathways and views on the future introduction of digital technology. Possible ways in which emerging sensor-based digital technology can improve rehabilitation and provide more rigorous evidence on effectiveness are described. It is suggested that one legacy of the COVID-19 pandemic will be lower organizational barriers to this introduction of digital technology to assist NMR delivery, especially if cost-effectiveness can be demonstrated.","Szczepura, Ala; Holliday, Nikki; Neville, Catriona; Johnson, Karen; Khan, Amir Jahan Khan; Oxford, Samuel W; Nduka, Charles",J Med Internet Res,551,22

Studies focusing on infiltrate localization often entail small cohorts, a mixture of HNSCC subsites, or focus on a single immune marker rather than the interaction between cells within the TME. Conclusions on the prognostic impact of specific immune cells in HNSCC are hampered by the use of heterogeneous or small cohorts. To move forward, the field should focus on deciphering the immune composition per HNSCC subsite, in powered cohorts and considering the molecular diversity in this disease.","Wondergem, Niels E; Nauta, Irene H; Muijlwijk, Tara; Leemans, C René; van de Ven, Rieneke",Curr Oncol Rep,551,16

Using data from the state health departments of Alabama and Louisiana aggregated to residential Census tracts, we assessed the relationship between social vulnerability and COVID-19 testing rates, test positivity, and incidence. Data were cumulative for the period of February 27, 2020 to October 7, 2020. We estimated the association of the 2018 Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) overall score and theme scores with COVID-19 tests, test positivity, and cases using multivariable negative binomial regressions. We adjusted for rurality with 2010 Rural-Urban Commuting Area codes. Regional effects were modeled as fixed effects of counties/parishes and state health department regions. The analytical sample included 1160 Alabama and 1105 Louisiana Census tracts. In both states, overall social vulnerability and vulnerability themes were significantly associated with increased COVID-19 case rates (RR 1.57, 95% CI 1.45-1.70 for Alabama; RR 1.36, 95% CI 1.26-1.46 for Louisiana). There was increased COVID-19 testing with higher overall vulnerability in Louisiana (RR 1.26, 95% CI 1.14-1.38), but not in Alabama (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.89-1.02). Consequently, test positivity in Alabama was significantly associated with social vulnerability (RR 1.66, 95% CI 1.57-1.75), whereas no such relationship was observed in Louisiana (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.98-1.12). Social vulnerability is a risk factor for COVID-19 infection, particularly among racial/ethnic minorities and those in disadvantaged housing conditions without transportation. Increased testing targeted to vulnerable communities may contribute to reduction in test positivity and overall COVID-19 disparities.","Oates, Gabriela R; Juarez, Lucia D; Horswell, Ronald; Chu, San; Miele, Lucio; Fouad, Mona N; Curry, William A; Fort, Daniel; Hillegass, William B; Danos, Denise M",J. community health,551,22

As telepsychiatry, video interviews using internet are suggested to be useful to evaluate and assist individuals with mental disorders. However, some patients especially with social phobia, depression, and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) hesitate to use even such face-to-face-like tools. Communication robots have been proposed as future assistant tools for such patients. Herein, we summarize recent advancements in robot psychiatry, and propose the benefits of communication robots in psychiatric evaluation. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies have suggested that communication robots are effective in assisting people with ASD. As a pilot trial, we herein conducted semi-structured interviews to evaluate depression and hikikomori, a form of pathological social withdrawal, using a communication robot and a psychiatrist, respectively. There was almost identical evaluation between the two. Interestingly, a person with hikikomori answered that the robot was easier to disclose. SUMMARY: Robots can reduce the burden of human resources and the infection risk in the COVID-19 era. Robot interview is expected to be implemented for future evaluation system in psychiatry.","Yoshikawa, Yuichiro; Kumazaki, Hirokazu; Kato, Takahiro A",Curr Opin Psychiatry,551,1

439942,439942,439942,COVID-19: When dust mites and lockdown create the perfect storm,16.451796,5.5538836,2020,"This paper aims to provide a perspective on data sharing practices in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The scientific community has made several important inroads in the fight against COVID-19, and there are over 2500 clinical trials registered globally. Within the context of the rapidly changing pandemic, we are seeing a large number of trials conducted without results being made available. It is likely that a plethora of trials have stopped early, not for statistical reasons but due to lack of feasibility. Trials stopped early for feasibility are, by definition, statistically underpowered and thereby prone to inconclusive findings. Statistical power is not necessarily linear with the total sample size, and even small reductions in patient numbers or events can have a substantial impact on the research outcomes. Given the profusion of clinical trials investigating identical or similar treatments across different geographical and clinical contexts, one must also consider that the likelihood of a substantial number of false-positive and false-negative trials, emerging with the increasing overall number of trials, adds to public perceptions of uncertainty. This issue is complicated further by the evolving nature of the pandemic, wherein baseline assumptions on control group risk factors used to develop sample size calculations are far more challenging than those in the case of well-documented diseases. The standard answer to these challenges during nonpandemic settings is to assess each trial for statistical power and risk-of-bias and then pool the reported aggregated results using meta-analytic approaches. This solution simply will not suffice for COVID-19. Even with random-effects meta-analysis models, it will be difficult to adjust for the heterogeneity of different trials with aggregated reported data alone, especially given the absence of common data standards and outcome measures. To date, several groups have proposed structures and partnerships for data sharing. As COVID-19 has forced reconsideration of policies, processes, and interests, this is the time to advance scientific cooperation and shift the clinical research enterprise toward a data-sharing culture to maximize our response in the service of public health.","Dron, Louis; Dillman, Alison; Zoratti, Michael J; Haggstrom, Jonas; Mills, Edward J; Park, Jay J H",J Med Internet Res,551,17

METHODS: From 29 January 2020 until 28 March 2020, we performed a longitudinal cohort study of COVID-19 inpatients at the Italian National Institute for Infectious Diseases, Rome, Italy. 9 CBC parameters were studied as continuous variables [neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, platelets, mean platelet volume, red blood cell count, haemoglobin concentration, mean red blood cell volume and red blood cell distribution width (RDW %)]. Model-based punctual estimates, as average of all patients' values, and differences between survivors and non-survivors, overall, and by co-morbidities, at specific times after symptoms, with relative 95% CI and P-values, were obtained by marginal prediction and ANOVA- style joint tests. All analyses were carried out by STATA 15 statistical package. MAIN FINDINGS: 379 COVID-19 patients [273 (72% were male; mean age was 61.67 (SD 15.60)] were enrolled and 1,805 measures per parameter were analysed. Neutrophils' counts were on average significantly higher in non-survivors than in survivors (P<0.001) and lymphocytes were on average higher in survivors (P<0.001). These differences were time dependent. Average platelets' counts (P<0.001) and median platelets' volume (P<0.001) were significantly different in survivors and non-survivors. The differences were time dependent and consistent with acute inflammation followed either by recovery or by death. Anaemia with anisocytosis was observed in the later phase of COVID-19 disease in non-survivors only. Mortality was significantly higher in patients with diabetes (OR = 3.28; 95%CI 1.51-7.13; p = 0.005), obesity (OR = 3.89; 95%CI 1.51-10.04; p = 0.010), chronic renal failure (OR = 9.23; 95%CI 3.49-24.36; p = 0.001), COPD (OR = 2.47; 95% IC 1.13-5.43; p = 0.033), cardiovascular diseases (OR = 4.46; 95%CI 2.25-8.86; p = 0.001), and those >60 years (OR = 4.21; 95%CI 1.82-9.77; p = 0.001). Age (OR = 2.59; 95%CI 1.04-6.45; p = 0.042), obesity (OR = 5.13; 95%CI 1.81-14.50; p = 0.002), renal chronic failure (OR = 5.20; 95%CI 1.80-14.97; p = 0.002) and cardiovascular diseases (OR 2.79; 95%CI 1.29-6.03; p = 0.009) were independently associated with poor clinical outcome at 30 days after symptoms' onset. INTERPRETATION: Increased neutrophil counts, reduced lymphocyte counts, increased median platelet volume and anaemia with anisocytosis, are poor prognostic indicators for COVID19, after adjusting for the confounding effect of obesity, chronic renal failure, COPD, cardiovascular diseases and age >60 years.","Lanini, Simone; Montaldo, Chiara; Nicastri, Emanuele; Vairo, Francesco; Agrati, Chiara; Petrosillo, Nicola; Scognamiglio, Paola; Antinori, Andrea; Puro, Vincenzo; Di Caro, Antonino; De Carli, Gabriella; Navarra, Assunta; Agresta, Alessandro; Cimaglia, Claudia; Palmieri, Fabrizio; D039,; Offizi, Gianpiero; Marchioni, Luisa; Kobinger, Gary Pignac; Maeurer, Markus; Girardi, Enrico; Capobianchi, Maria Rosaria; Zumla, Alimuddin; Locatelli, Franco; Ippolito, Giuseppe",PLoS One,551,20

Like most surgical specialties, urology has shifted towards an emergency mentality. Currently, the beginning of the de-escalation phase of the pandemic has been observed, which will certainly pose new challenges to the urological community. Material and methods: A non-systematic search was conducted through the Medline and Web of Science databases. The main keywords used in the search were: 'COVID-19', 'SARS-CoV-2', 'urology'. The search included articles without time and language limitation. Results: During the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic urological services had to focus on maintaining urgent-oncological and emergency-trauma procedures. First adapted recommendations were released at the end of March 2020. Primarily, they included information regarding the prioritization of surgical procedures. Currently, the beginning of the de-escalation phase in many countries has forced the necessity of establishing new degrees of priority for surgical interventions.During the COVID-19 pandemic, cancellations and rescheduling significantly extend the waiting time for outpatient appointments and surgical procedures. A network of expert high-volume centres, at every level of referentiality, should guarantee the continuity of oncological care, supported with telemedicine systems.The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a substantial decrease in clinical activity of urology residents. There also is huge potential for remote technology to address and improve education and training continuation in this field. Conclusions: Urological care has been severely impaired by the COVID-19 pandemic. Urologists must adapt to the dynamically changing reality, prioritizing the safety and well-being of their patients and their clinic workforce.","Nowak, Lukasz; Krajewski, Wojciech; Kielb, Pawel; Sliwa, Anna; Zdrojowy-Welna, Aleksandra; Zdrojowy, Romuald",Cent European J Urol,551,1

OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of cloth and medical masks for preventing SARS-CoV-2 transmission in community settings. METHODS: Two rapid reviews were conducted searching three electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library) and two clinical trials registries on 30 and 31 March 2020. RESULTS: We screened 821 records and assessed nine full-text articles for eligibility. One and seven RCTs were included for cloth and medical mask reviews, respectively. No SARS-CoV-2-specific RCTs and no cloth mask RCTs in community settings were identified. A single hospital-based RCT provided indirect evidence that, compared with medical masks, cloth masks probably increase clinical respiratory illnesses (relative risk (RR) 1.56; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.98 - 2.49) and laboratory-confirmed respiratory virus infections (RR 1.54; 95% CI 0.88 - 2.70). Evidence for influenza-like illnesses (ILI) was uncertain (RR 13.00; 95% CI 1.69 - 100.03). Two RCTs provide low-certainty evidence that medical masks may make little to no difference to ILI infection risk versus no masks (RR 0.98; 95% CI 0.81 - 1.19) in the community setting. Five RCTs provide low-certainty evidence that medical masks may slightly reduce infection risk v. no masks (RR 0.81; 95% CI 0.55 - 1.20) in the household setting. CONCLUSIONS: Direct evidence for cloth and medical mask efficacy and effectiveness in the community is limited. Decision-making for mask use may consider other factors such as feasibility and SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics; however, well-designed comparative effectiveness studies are required.","Chetty, T; Ramokolo, V; Rees, K; Kredo, T; Balakrishna, Y; Mathews, C; Siegfried, N",S Afr Med J,551,29

STUDY DESIGN: Beginning March 22, 2020, all pregnant women from one large obstetrical practice in New York City were contacted regularly to inquire about symptoms of COVID-19 (fever, cough, shortness of breath, malaise, anosmia), or sick contacts. A running log was kept of these patients, as well as all patients who underwent COVID-19 testing. For this report, we included every patient with suspected COVID-19 infection, which was defined as at least two symptoms, or a positive COVID-19 nasopharyngeal polymerase chain reaction test. RESULTS: From March 22, 2020 until April 30, 2020, 757 pregnant women in our practice were evaluated and 92 had known or suspected COVID-19 (12.2%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 10.0-14.7%). Of these 92 women, 33 (36%) had positive COVID-19 test results. Only one woman required hospital admission for 5 days due to COVID-19 (1.1%, 95% CI: 0.2-5.9%). One other woman received home oxygen. No women required mechanical ventilation and there were no maternal deaths. One woman had an unexplained fetal demise at 14 weeks' gestation around the time of her COVID-19 symptoms. Twenty one of the 92 women have delivered, and all were uncomplicated. CONCLUSIONS: Among 92 women with confirmed or presumed COVID-19, the overall morbidity was low. These preliminary results are encouraging for pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic. KEY POINTS: · Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is prevalent in New York City.. · In this case series, COVID-19 in pregnant women had a very low morbidity and no mortality.. · This preliminary data is reassuring for pregnant women at risk of COVID-19..","Fox, Nathan S; Melka, Stephanie",Am J Perinatol,551,4

Health care workers, as those on the frontline of the COVID-19 pandemic, are more susceptible to infection. Inadequate related knowledge and preventive behaviors among health care workers might lead to delayed treatment and result in the rapid spread of the infection. Therefore, this study evaluated the knowledge of health care workers with regard to COVID-19. A cross-sectional study was conducted from June 10-18, 2020. Participants were general practitioners, specialists, and nurses working at the forefront of the pandemic. Their knowledge, preventive behaviors, and risk perceptions concerning COVID-19 were evaluated using an online questionnaire created by our medical specialists. The questionnaire consisted of 29, 5, and 4 items about COVID-19 knowledge, preventive behaviors, and risk perceptions, respectively. A total of 251 health care workers completed the questionnaire. The mean age of the participants was 33.88±8.72 years old, and the sample consisted of 68 males (27.08%) and 183 females (72.91%). While there was no difference between the percentage of correct answers given by female and male participants to knowledge-based questions (p>0.05), the percentage of correct answers to the questions on preventive behaviors was significantly higher in female participants than in males (p<0.001). The overall average percentages of correct responses were 91.66% for knowledge-based questions and 85.96% for preventive behavior questions. The scores for knowledge-based questions were higher for medical specialists, whereas nurses scored higher on preventive behavior questions. Government hospital staff showed a significant difference in preventive behaviors compared to that of university hospitals (p<0.05). In addition, there was a positive correlation between knowledge scores and preventive behaviors. Although all the participants (100%) knew that contracting COVID-19 can lead to death, only 66.93% of them were willing to get vaccinated themselves. The knowledge level of health care workers concerning COVID-19 was above 90%, but the level of competence in terms of preventive behaviors was found to be low, especially in males.","Arslanca, Tufan; Fidan, Cihan; Daggez, Mine; Dursun, Polat",PLoS One,551,21

Our understanding of that question has been dictated by holism, as defined by the biopsychosocial model, since the late twentieth century. Unfortunately, holism was characterized at the start with confused definitions of 'dualism' and 'reductionism', and that problem has led to a deep, unrecognized conceptual split in the medical professions. Some insist that holism is a nonreductionist approach that aligns with some form of dualism, while others insist it's a reductionist view that sets out to eradicate dualism. It's important to consider each version. Nonreductive holism is philosophically consistent and clinically unproblematic. Reductive holism, however, is conceptually incoherent-yet it is the basis for the common idea that the boundary between medical and mental health disorders must be vague. When we trace that idea through to its implementation in medical practice, we find evidence that it compromises the safety of patient care in the large portion of cases where clinicians grapple with diagnosis at the boundary between psychiatry and medicine. Having established that medicine must embrace some form of nonreductionism, I argue that Chalmers' naturalistic dualism is a stronger prima facie candidate than the nonreductive alternatives. Regardless of which form of nonreductionism we prefer, some philosophical corrections are needed to give medicine a safe and coherent foundation.","O039,; Leary, Diane",Synthese,551,6

One group particuarly likely to be affected by this in the immediate future are the healthcare professionals working on the frontline of the NHS pandemic response. As members of a foundation cohort of these junior doctors we aimed to create a way to quanitfy the wellbeing of ourselves and our colleagues at this challeging time. We aimed to use a combination of numerous tools to monitor foundation doctors in Blackburn during this crisis. This would inform which measures would be best suited to be put in place to protect this cohort from early burnout and poor mental health in the future.MethodWe designed a survey of 25 questions which we invited our foundation colleagues to fill in anonymously during the first and second waves of the pandemic in response to times when foundation doctors were redeployed to aid the frontline. The survey has been based on the PHQ9, GAD7, Epworth Sleepiness scale, Physician wellbeing index, Medical students wellbeing index, Maslach burnout inventory BMA burnout questionnaire and the QOL scale.ResultFrom a cohort of around 140 foundation doctors we had 46 participants in our trial of this tool;46% had been redeployed and 54% not redeployed. Over 50% of survey respondents reported high stress, poor motivation and depersonalisation over the two weeks at the peak of the pandemic, key early signs of burnout. Lack of interest in their work, poor sleep and anhedonia were increased across both groups (redeployed and non redeployed). The interventions after the first wave data which repondents found beneficial included;financial reassurances during redeployments, protected non clinical areas for rest, a named individual senior staff member for wellbeing support.ConclusionKey issues the survey raised were fed back to foundation programme leads in monthly meetings. This allowed us with our foundation leads to make targeted changes in order to support foundation doctors at this time. Without the data from this tool which we tailored to the foundation experience we believe these rapidly worsening issues during the pandemic would not have been addressed so swiftly. We then resurveyed the foundation cohort to assess which of these interventions have been most widely used and appreciated.","Handa, Nikhita Pramanik Sanjeev",BJPsych Open,551,13

However, this has led to large numbers of missed school days. Therefore, we trialled daily testing of contacts as an alternative, to investigate if it would affect transmission in schools. MethodsWe performed an open-label cluster randomised controlled trial in students and staff from secondary schools and further education colleges in England (ISRCTN18100261). Schools were randomised to self-isolation of COVID-19 contacts for 10 days (control) or to voluntary daily lateral flow device (LFD) testing for school contacts with LFD-negative contacts remaining at school (intervention). Household contacts were excluded from participation. Co-primary outcomes in all students and staff were symptomatic COVID-19, adjusted for community case rates, to estimate within-school transmission (non-inferiority margin: <50% relative increase), and COVID-19-related school absence. Analyses were performed on an intention to treat (ITT) basis using quasi-Poisson regression, also estimating complier average causal effects (CACE). Secondary outcomes included participation rates, PCR results in contacts and performance characteristics of LFDs vs. PCR. FindingsOf 99 control and 102 intervention schools, 76 and 86 actively participated (19-April-2021 to 27-June-2021); additional national data allowed most non-participating schools to be included in the co-primary outcomes. 2432/5763(42.4%) intervention arm contacts participated. There were 657 symptomatic PCR-confirmed infections during 7,782,537 days-at-risk (59.1/100k/week) and 740 during 8,379,749 days-at-risk (61.8/100k/week) in the control and intervention arms respectively (ITT adjusted incidence rate ratio, aIRR=0.96 [95%CI 0.75-1.22;p=0.72]) (CACE-aIRR=0.86 [0.55-1.34]). There were 55,718 COVID-related absences during 3,092,515 person-school-days (1.8%) and 48,609 during 3,305,403 person-school-days(1.5%) in the control and intervention arms (ITT-aIRR=0.80 [95%CI 0.53-1.21;p=0.29]) (CACE-aIRR 0.61 [0.30-1.23]). 14/886(1.6%) control contacts providing an asymptomatic PCR sample tested positive compared to 44/2981(1.5%) intervention contacts (adjusted odds ratio, aOR=0.73 [95%CI 0.33-1.61;p=0.44]). Rates of symptomatic infection in contacts were 44/4665(0.9%) and 79/5955(1.3%), respectively (aOR=1.21 [0.82-1.79;p=0.34]). InterpretationDaily contact testing of school-based contacts was non-inferior to self-isolation for control of COVID-19 transmission. COVID-19 rates in school-based contacts in both intervention and control groups were <2%.

The unique clinical phenomena in severe COVID-19 can be perplexing, and they include disproportionately severe hypoxemia relative to lung alveolar-parenchymal pathology and rapid clinical deterioration, with poor response to O2 supplementation, despite preserved lung mechanics. Factors such as microvascular injury, thromboembolism, pulmonary hypertension, and alteration in hemoglobin structure and function could play important roles. Overwhelming immune response associated with ""cytokine storms"" could activate reactive oxygen species (ROS), which may result in consumption of nitric oxide (NO), a critical vasodilation regulator. In other inflammatory infections, activated neutrophils are known to release myeloperoxidase (MPO) in a natural immune response, which contributes to production of hypochlorous acid (HOCl). However, during overwhelming inflammation, HOCl competes with O2 at heme binding sites, decreasing O2 saturation. Moreover, HOCl contributes to several oxidative reactions, including hemoglobin-heme iron oxidation, heme destruction, and subsequent release of free iron, which mediates toxic tissue injury through additional generation of ROS and NO consumption. Connecting these reactions in a multi-hit model can explain generalized tissue damage, vasoconstriction, severe hypoxia, and precipitous clinical deterioration in critically ill COVID-19 patients. Understanding these mechanisms is critical to develop therapeutic strategies to combat COVID-19.","Goud, Pravin T; Bai, David; Abu-Soud, Husam M",Int J Biol Sci,551,16

It quickened the introduction of e-medicine, and changed the manner and number of services provided in the open medical setting. Aim: To assess variations in the consultation rate of patients in primary healthcare centers (PHCs) in consecutive months of the pandemic. Method: Data collected from two PHCs located in Olsztyn (Poland) were analyzed retrospectively. Collectively, these two centers provide care for approximately 20,000 inhabitants and perform approximately 100,000 medical services annually. The analysis was based on data covering the period April-July of the years 2010-2020, consisting in total of 337,510 medical services records. Results: A large, statistically significant decrease in the consultation rate (consultation rate understood as the number of individuals seeking consultation in relation to the number of people under care in a given time period) was revealed in each age group in the initial phase of the pandemic. In consecutive months, the approximated consultation rate achieved mean long-term values. Conclusions. The largest reduction in the consultation rate was revealed in the youngest age group, with the smallest occurring in the oldest. In the group of patients older than 65 years of age, the consultation rate after 3 months of the pandemic was the same as before the outbreak. Variations in the consultation rate were independent of the epidemiological situation. During the study, we observed an increased level of the administrative and paperwork activities carried out by PHC physicians.","Ochal, Michal; Romaszko, Malgorzata; Glinska-Lewczuk, Katarzyna; Gromadzinski, Leszek; Romaszko, Jerzy",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),551,9

This study attempts to quantify the age-specific transmissibility using a mathematical model. METHODS: An epidemiological model with five compartments (susceptible-exposed-symptomatic-asymptomatic-recovered/removed [SEIAR]) was developed based on observed transmission features. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases were divided into four age groups: group 1, those &#8804; 14 years old; group 2, those 15 to 44 years old; group 3, those 45 to 64 years old; and group 4, those &#8805; 65 years old. The model was initially based on cases (including imported cases and secondary cases) collected in Hunan Province from January 5 to February 19, 2020. Another dataset, from Jilin Province, was used to test the model. RESULTS: The age-specific SEIAR model fitted the data well in each age group (P < 0.001). In Hunan Province, the highest transmissibility was from age group 4 to 3 (median: ß43 = 7.71 × 10- 9; SAR43 = 3.86 × 10- 8), followed by group 3 to 4 (median: ß34 = 3.07 × 10- 9; SAR34 = 1.53 × 10- 8), group 2 to 2 (median: ß22 = 1.24 × 10- 9; SAR22 = 6.21 × 10- 9), and group 3 to 1 (median: ß31 = 4.10 × 10- 10; SAR31 = 2.08 × 10- 9). The lowest transmissibility was from age group 3 to 3 (median: ß33 = 1.64 × 10- 19; SAR33 = 8.19 × 10- 19), followed by group 4 to 4 (median: ß44 = 3.66 × 10- 17; SAR44 = 1.83 × 10- 16), group 3 to 2 (median: ß32 = 1.21 × 10- 16; SAR32 = 6.06 × 10- 16), and group 1 to 4 (median: ß14 = 7.20 × 10- 14; SAR14 = 3.60 × 10- 13). In Jilin Province, the highest transmissibility occurred from age group 4 to 4 (median: ß43 = 4.27 × 10- 8; SAR43 = 2.13 × 10- 7), followed by group 3 to 4 (median: ß34 = 1.81 × 10- 8; SAR34 = 9.03 × 10- 8). CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 exhibits high transmissibility between middle-aged (45 to 64 years old) and elderly (&#8805; 65 years old) people. Children (&#8804; 14 years old) have very low susceptibility to COVID-19.

Infection from airborne respiratory viruses including Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can occur in at least three modes; tiny and/or dried aerosols (typically < 1.0 µm) generated through multiple mechanisms including talking, breathing, singing, large droplets (> 0.5 µm) generated during coughing and sneezing, and macro drops transmitted via fomites. While there is a growing number of studies looking at the performance of household materials against some of these situations, to date, there has not been any systematic characterization of household materials against all three modes. METHODS: A three-step methodology was developed and used to characterize the performance of 21 different household materials with various material compositions (e.g. cotton, polyester, polypropylene, cellulose and blends) using submicron sodium chloride aerosols, water droplets, and mucous mimicking macro droplets over an aerosol-droplet size range of ~ 20 nm to 0.6 cm. RESULTS: Except for one thousand-thread-count cotton, most single-layered materials had filtration efficiencies < 20% for sub-micron solid aerosols. However, several of these materials stopped > 80% of larger droplets, even at sneeze-velocities of up to 1700 cm/s. Three or four layers of the same material, or combination materials, would be required to stop macro droplets from permeating out or into the face covering. Such materials can also be boiled for reuse. CONCLUSION: Four layers of loosely knit or woven fabrics independent of the composition (e.g. cotton, polyester, nylon or blends) are likely to be effective source controls. One layer of tightly woven fabrics combined with multiple layers of loosely knit or woven fabrics in addition to being source controls can have sub-micron filtration efficiencies > 40% and may offer some protection to the wearer. However, the pressure drop across such fabrics can be high (> 100 Pa).","Guha, Suvajyoti; Herman, Alexander; Carr, Ian A; Porter, Daniel; Natu, Rucha; Berman, Shayna; Myers, Matthew R",PLoS One,551,20

The existing inflammatory markers, like C-reactive protein, are not specific for infection, which introduces diagnostic uncertainty. Procalcitonin (PCT) is used to accurately diagnose bacterial sepsis and differentiate it from other conditions, which is now particularly important given the vulnerability to COVID-19 in pregnancy. There are few studies of PCT in pregnancy as the reference interval for pregnant women is unknown. This study aimed to define the pregnancy-specific reference interval for PCT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cross-sectional study of 323 healthy pregnant women, with longitudinal sampling in each trimester. RESULTS: The upper reference limit for PCT was 0.05 ng/mL and did not vary materially between any observed group of gestational age, body mass index, maternal age, mean arterial blood pressure or fetal sex. CONCLUSION: Our study has shown that levels of PCT are similar in pregnant and non-pregnant populations despite the physiological changes of normal pregnancy. Therefore, pregnancy should not preclude the use of PCT in pregnant women with suspected sepsis, or for guiding antibiotic therapy in women with a diagnosed bacterial infection at any stage of pregnancy.","Dockree, Samuel; Brook, Jennifer; James, Tim; Shine, Brian; Vatish, Manu",Clin. chim. acta,551,26

To assess the effects of COVID-19 on the outdoor recreation participation and subjective well-being of adolescents, as well as how participation in outdoor activities may mitigate declines in subjective well-being, we used a Qualtrics XM panel to conduct a nationally representative survey of youth ages 10-18 across the United States (n = 624) between 30 April and 15 June 2020. Survey questions focused on frequency of participation in outdoor activities before and during the pandemic, as well as changes in subjective well-being. Paired t-tests revealed decreases in both outdoor recreation participation (64% reported declines) and subjective well-being (52% reported declines). A regression model examining correlates of changes in subjective well-being (R2 = 0.42) revealed strong associations with changes in outdoor play (B = 0.44, p < 0.001) and nature-based (B = 0.21, p = 0.016) activities. Adolescents' from all backgrounds who participated in these activities during the pandemic reported smaller declines in subjective well-being. Results highlight the critical role that time outdoors and time in nature play in bolstering adolescents' resilience to stressors such as the COVID-19 pandemic and underscore the need to facilitate outdoor recreation opportunities for youth during times of crisis.","Jackson, S Brent; Stevenson, Kathryn T; Larson, Lincoln R; Peterson, M Nils; Seekamp, Erin",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),551,20

However, its effectiveness is severely limited by the lack of sufficient and diverse materials in current materials repositories such as the open quantum materials database (OQMD). Recent progress in deep learning have enabled generative strategies that learn implicit chemical rules for creating hypothetical materials with new compositions and structures. However, current materials generative models have difficulty in generating structurally diverse, chemically valid, and stable materials. Here we propose CubicGAN, a generative adversarial network (GAN) based deep neural network model for large scale generative design of novel cubic materials. When trained on 375 749 ternary materials from the OQMD database, the authors show that the model is able to not only rediscover most of the currently known cubic materials but also generate hypothetical materials of new structure prototypes. A total of 506 such materials have been verified by phonon dispersion calculation. Considering the importance of cubic materials in wide applications such as solar panels, the GAN model provides a promising approach to significantly expand existing materials repositories, enabling the discovery of new functional materials via screening.

The purpose of this study is to determine whether socio-economic factors are associated with acceptability of newborn screening to identify infants with sickle cell disease during the COVID-19 pandemic in Kisangani, DRC. Methods: we conducted an observational study of mothers sensitized to neonatal screening to detect sickle cell disease in their newborns with hemotypeSCTM (HT401RUO-USA). The study was carried out at the maternity wards in Kisangani from March 21st to June 30th 2020. Collected data were parity, educational level, age, socio-economic level, occupation, awareness and the reason for the denial of screening. Results: out of 55.5% (273/492) of sensitized mothers, 107 (39.19%) accepted and 166 (60.80%) refused neonatal screening to detect sickle cell disease in their newborn. The reasons for refusal were lack of information (67.5%; 95% CI [59.8-74.5]), lack of money due to confinement (66.3%; 95% CI [58.5-73.4]), blood test to develop a vaccine for protection against COVID-19 (63.2%; 95% CI = [55.4-70.6]).

This method has not been widely adopted. We piloted the use of trained community health workers (CHW) to investigate the extent of unreported maternal and infant deaths in Khayelitsha and explored requirements of such a programme and the role of CHWs in bridging gaps. METHODS: This was a mixed methods study, incorporating both qualitative and quantitative methods. Case identification and data collection were done by ten trained CHWs. Quantitative data were collected using a structured questionnaire. Qualitative data were collected using semi-structured interview guides for key informant interviews, focus group discussions and informal conversations. Qualitative data were analysed thematically using a content analysis approach. RESULTS: Although more than half of the infant deaths occurred in hospitals (n = 11/17), about a quarter that occurred at home (n = 4/17) were unreported. Main causes of deaths as perceived by family members of the deceased were related to uncertainty about the quality of care in the facilities, socio-cultural and economic contexts where people lived and individual factors. Most unreported deaths were further attributed to weak facility-community links and socio-cultural practices. Fragmented death reporting systems were perceived to influence the quality of the data and this impacted on the number of unreported deaths. Only two maternal deaths were identified in this pilot study. CONCLUSIONS: CHWs can conduct verbal and social autopsy for maternal and infant deaths to complement formal vital registration systems. Capacity development, stakeholder's engagement, supervision, and support are essential for a community-linked death review system. Policymakers and implementers should establish a functional relationship between community-linked reporting systems and the existing system as a starting point. There is a need for more studies to confirm or build on our pilot findings.","Igumbor, Jude; Adetokunboh, Olatunji; Muller, Jocelyn; Bosire, Edna N; Ajuwon, Ademola; Phetlhu, Rene; Mbule, Marjorie; Ronan, Agnes; Burtt, Fiona; Scheepers, Esca; Schmitz, Kathrin",BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,551,1

Comparison between 2019 and 2020,16.45172,5.4260054,2020,"OBJECTIVES: The emergence of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and subsequent pandemic has led to the most substantive large-scale, open, and public social discussion of epidemiology and science in recent history. In the United States (US), extensive debate has ensued as to the risk posed by the disease, whether the health system is prepared to manage a high volume of critical cases, whether any number of public health responses are necessary and appropriate, and the appropriate ways to prevent, manage, and treat the pandemic. I hypothesized that the interplay between scientists, policymakers, and the public in an open forum was associated with increased overall public trust in science and scientists, but that this was moderated by political orientation and/or religious commitment. In the context of a public health emergency, it is important to understand the degree to which science and scientists are trusted to produce information that can provide reassurance and also can explain the details of a highly complex event such as a viral pandemic while providing actionable recommendations. STUDY DESIGN: The study design was analytic cross-sectional. METHODS: Data were obtained on March 17-18, 2020, from a sample of 242 US-based Amazon Mechanical Turk users. Respondents completed a 49-question survey consisting of key sociodemographic variables, political affiliation, religious commitment, and two iterations of the Trust in Science and Scientist Inventory (one for March 2020, and one for December 2019 using retrospective recall). Changes in mean level of trust and interaction with political affiliation and/or religious commitment were assessed using mixed ANOVA via the general linear model. RESULTS: On a scale from 1 (low trust) to 5 (high trust), the mean level of trust in science and scientists was static; 3.82 in December 2019 and 3.81 in March 2020. Conservative political orientation and high religious commitment were associated with significantly less overall trust in science; the interaction effect suggested that liberal trust in science decreased slightly from December 2019 to March 2020, whereas conservative trust increased slightly. CONCLUSIONS: Counter to my expectations, the overall level of trust in science remained static after the first several months of COVID-19 in the US, although there is some evidence that political orientation was associated with magnitude and directionality of change in trust. Continued examination of these trends is important for understanding public response to epidemiologic recommendations.","Agley, Jon",Public Health,551,1

Life and/or environmental events, such as traumatic brain injury (TBI), high-fat diet (HFD), and chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH), are proposed exogenous risk factors for AD. BDNF/TrkB, an essential neurotrophic signaling for synaptic plasticity and neuronal survival, are reduced in the aged brain and in AD patients. Here, we show that environmental factors activate C/EBPß, an inflammatory transcription factor, which subsequently up-regulates Î´-secretase that simultaneously cleaves both APP and Tau, triggering AD neuropathological changes. These adverse effects are additively exacerbated in BDNF+/- or TrkB+/- mice. Strikingly, TBI provokes both senile plaque deposit and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) formation in TrkB+/- mice, associated with augmented neuroinflammation and extensive neuronal loss, leading to cognitive deficits. Depletion of C/EBPß inhibits TBI-induced AD-like pathologies in these mice. Remarkably, amyloid aggregates and NFT are tempospatially distributed in TrkB+/- mice brains after TBI, providing insight into their spreading in the progression of AD-like pathologies. Hence, our study revealed the roles of exogenous (TBI, HFD, and CCH) and endogenous (TrkB/BDNF) risk factors in the onset of AD-associated pathologies.","Wu, Zhourui; Chen, Chun; Kang, Seong Su; Liu, Xia; Gu, Xiaohuan; Yu, Shan Ping; Keene, C Dirk; Cheng, Liming; Ye, Keqiang",Proc.

However, conducting clinical research amidst a pandemic requires researchers to balance clinical and research demands. We seek to understand the values, experiences, and beliefs of physicians working at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in order to inform clinical research planning. We aim to understand whether pandemic settings affect physician comfort with research practices, and how physician experiences shape their understanding of research in a pandemic setting. METHODS: A survey tool was adapted to evaluate familiarity and comfort with research during a pandemic. A cross-sectional, online questionnaire was distributed across Canadian research networks early in the COVID-19 outbreak. The survey was administered between March 11th and 17th, 2020, during a time of local transmission but prior to the surge of cases. We aimed to recruit into the survey physicians in infectious disease and critical care research networks across Canada. RESULTS: Of the 133 physician respondents, 131 (98%) considered it important to conduct clinical research during the COVID-19 pandemic. Respondents were more accepting of adaptations to the research process in during a pandemic compared to in a non-pandemic setting, including conducting research with deferred consent (&#967;2 = 8.941, 95% CI: -0.264, -0.085, p = 0.003), using non-identifiable observational data with a waiver of consent with a median score of 97 out of 100 (IQR: 79.25-100) vs median 87 out of 100 (IQR: 63-79) (95% CI: -12.43, 0.054, p = 0.052). The majority felt that research quality is not compromised during pandemics. CONCLUSIONS: Physicians consider it important to conduct research during a pandemic, highlighting the need to expedite research activities in pandemic settings. Respondents were more accepting of adaptations to the research process for research conducted during a pandemic, compared to that conducted in its absence of a pandemic.","Silverberg, Sarah L; Puchalski Ritchie, Lisa M; Gobat, Nina; Nichol, Alistair; Murthy, Srinivas",PLoS One,551,16

In order to act appropriately in their environment, cells are dependent on the transduction of the incoming signal through tightly regulated and interconnected signaling pathways to the cell nucleus. In particular, cells implicated in the immune system greatly depend on such systems to respond in a flexible and dynamic manner to environmental challenges. One major group of intracellular proteins that are involved in these signaling pathways are adaptor proteins. Although adaptor proteins are essential for normal immune cell operation, the functional role of this group of signaling proteins remains to be fully appreciated. So far, research on adaptor proteins has revealed their unique potential in building transient complexes in a reversible, dynamic, and inducible manner. In this review, we explore the roles of adaptor proteins - in space and time of intracellular signaling - and their associations with human disease. Examples of adaptor proteins expressed in hematopoietic cells highlight their crucial role in the immune system. Lastly, we present challenges faced in elucidating roles of adaptor proteins, as illustrated by the T cell-specific adaptor (TSAd) protein encoded by the SH2D2A gene.","Borowicz, Pawel; Chan, Hanna; Hauge, Anette; Spurkland, Anne",Scand J Immunol,551,22

456689,456689,456689,Special Issue “COVID-19: Diagnostic Imaging and Beyond”,16.421074,5.3691545,2020,"BACKGROUND: The current COVID-19 pandemic is associated with extensive individual and societal challenges, including challenges to both physical and mental health. To date, the development of mental health problems such as depressive symptoms accompanying population-based federal distancing measures is largely unknown, and opportunities for rapid, effective, and valid monitoring are currently a relevant matter of investigation. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aim to investigate, first, the temporal progression of depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic and, second, the consistency of the results from tweets and survey-based self-reports of depressive symptoms within the same time period. METHODS: Based on a cross-sectional population survey of 9011 German adolescents and adults (n=4659, 51.7% female; age groups from 15 to 50 years and older) and a sample of 88,900 tweets (n=74,587, 83.9% female; age groups from 10 to 50 years and older), we investigated five depressive symptoms (eg, depressed mood and energy loss) using items from the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8) before, during, and after relaxation of the first German social contact ban from January to July 2020. RESULTS: On average, feelings of worthlessness were the least frequently reported symptom (survey: n=1011, 13.9%; Twitter: n=5103, 5.7%) and fatigue or loss of energy was the most frequently reported depressive symptom (survey: n=4472, 51.6%; Twitter: n=31,005, 34.9%) among both the survey and Twitter respondents. Young adult women and people living in federal districts with high COVID-19 infection rates were at an increased risk for depressive symptoms. The comparison of the survey and Twitter data before and after the first contact ban showed that German adolescents and adults had a significant decrease in feelings of fatigue and energy loss over time. The temporal progression of depressive symptoms showed high correspondence between both data sources (&#961;=0.76-0.93; P<.001), except for diminished interest and depressed mood, which showed a steady increase even after the relaxation of the contact ban among the Twitter respondents but not among the survey respondents. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the results indicate relatively small differences in depressive symptoms associated with social distancing measures during the COVID-19 pandemic and highlight the need to differentiate between positive (eg, energy level) and negative (eg, depressed mood) associations and variations over time. The results also underscore previous suggestions of Twitter data's potential to help identify hot spots of declining and improving public mental health and thereby help provide early intervention measures, especially for young and middle-aged adults. Further efforts are needed to investigate the long-term consequences of recurring lockdown phases and to address the limitations of social media data such as Twitter data to establish real-time public mental surveillance approaches.","Cohrdes, Caroline; Yenikent, Seren; Wu, Jiawen; Ghanem, Bilal; Franco-Salvador, Marc; Vogelgesang, Felicitas",JMIR Ment Health,551,20

DESIGN: the study introduces a SEIR compartmental model, taking into account the region-specific fraction of undetected cases, the effects of mobility restrictions, and the personal protective measures adopted, such as wearing a mask and washing hands frequently. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: the model is experimentally validated with data of all the Italian regions, some European countries, and the US. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: the accuracy of the model results is measured through the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and Lewis criteria; fitting parameters are in good agreement with previous literature. RESULTS: the epidemic curves for different countries and the amount of undetected and asymptomatic cases are estimated, which are likely to represent the main source of infections in the near future. The model is applied to the Hubei case study, which is the first place to relax mobility restrictions. Results show different possible scenarios. Mobility and the adoption of personal protective measures greatly influence the dynamics of the infection, determining either a huge and rapid secondary epidemic peak or a more delayed and manageable one. CONCLUSIONS: mathematical models can provide useful insights for healthcare decision makers to determine the best strategy in case of future outbreaks.","Picchiotti, Nicola; Salvioli, Monica; Zanardini, Elena; Missale, Francesco",Epidemiol Prev,551,1

DESIGN: Comparative observational study using data collected from routine care. SETTING: Four French tertiary care centres providing care to patients with covid-19 pneumonia between 12 March and 31 March 2020. PARTICIPANTS: 181 patients aged 18-80 years with documented severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pneumonia who required oxygen but not intensive care. INTERVENTIONS: Hydroxychloroquine at a dose of 600 mg/day within 48 hours of admission to hospital (treatment group) versus standard care without hydroxychloroquine (control group). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was survival without transfer to the intensive care unit at day 21. Secondary outcomes were overall survival, survival without acute respiratory distress syndrome, weaning from oxygen, and discharge from hospital to home or rehabilitation (all at day 21). Analyses were adjusted for confounding factors by inverse probability of treatment weighting. RESULTS: In the main analysis, 84 patients who received hydroxychloroquine within 48 hours of admission to hospital (treatment group) were compared with 89 patients who did not receive hydroxychloroquine (control group). Eight additional patients received hydroxychloroquine more than 48 hours after admission. In the weighted analyses, the survival rate without transfer to the intensive care unit at day 21 was 76% in the treatment group and 75% in the control group (weighted hazard ratio 0.9, 95% confidence interval 0.4 to 2.1). Overall survival at day 21 was 89% in the treatment group and 91% in the control group (1.2, 0.4 to 3.3). Survival without acute respiratory distress syndrome at day 21 was 69% in the treatment group compared with 74% in the control group (1.3, 0.7 to 2.6). At day 21, 82% of patients in the treatment group had been weaned from oxygen compared with 76% in the control group (weighted risk ratio 1.1, 95% confidence interval 0.9 to 1.3). Eight patients in the treatment group (10%) experienced electrocardiographic modifications that required discontinuation of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Hydroxychloroquine has received worldwide attention as a potential treatment for covid-19 because of positive results from small studies. However, the results of this study do not support its use in patients admitted to hospital with covid-19 who require oxygen.","Mahévas, Matthieu; Tran, Viet-Thi; Roumier, Mathilde; Chabrol, Amélie; Paule, Romain; Guillaud, Constance; Fois, Elena; Lepeule, Raphael; Szwebel, Tali-Anne; Lescure, François-Xavier; Schlemmer, Frédéric; Matignon, Marie; Khellaf, Mehdi; Crickx, Etienne; Terrier, Benjamin; Morbieu, Caroline; Legendre, Paul; Dang, Julien; Schoindre, Yoland; Pawlotsky, Jean-Michel; Michel, Marc; Perrodeau, Elodie; Carlier, Nicolas; Roche, Nicolas; de Lastours, Victoire; Ourghanlian, Clément; Kerneis, Solen; Ménager, Philippe; Mouthon, Luc; Audureau, Etienne; Ravaud, Philippe; Godeau, Bertrand; Gallien, Sébastien; Costedoat-Chalumeau, Nathalie",BMJ,551,6

Resilience might protect employees from the negative consequences of chronic stress. The aim of this study was to explore the mediating role of resilience in the relationship between depression and burnout (personal, work-related, and client-related). A cross-sectional study was performed using an online questionnaire distributed via social networks. A survey was conducted comprising standardized measures of resilience (Resilience Scale-25 items), depression (subscale of Depression Anxiety Stress Scales-21 items), and burnout (Copenhagen Burnout Inventory Scale-19 items). A total of 2008 subjects completed the survey, and a hierarchical regression model was estimated for each burnout dimension. The results revealed that depression had not only a directed effect on personal, work- and client-related burnout, but also an indirect small effect on it through resilience. Psychological resilience played a partial mediating role between depression and all burnout dimensions. This partial mediation suggests that there may be other possible variables (e.g., social connection, self-compassion, gratitude, sense of purpose) that further explain the associations.","Serrão, Carla; Duarte, Ivone; Castro, Luísa; Teixeira, Andreia",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),551,21

We present our standard practices around ECMO decision-making, retrieval, cannulation, ventilation, anticoagulation, tracheostomy, imaging and steroids. Methods: A retrospective cohort study using data from the hospital notes on all SARS-CoV-2 patients who required extracorporeal support at St Bartholomew's Hospital between 1 March 2020 and 31 July 2020. In total, this included 18 patients over this time period. Results: In total, 18 patients were managed with extracorporeal support and of these 14 survived (78%) with 4 deaths (22%). The mean duration from hospital admission to intubation was 4.1 ± 3.4 days, mean time from intubation to ECMO 2.3 ± 2 days and mean run on ECMO 17.7 ± 9.4 days. Survivor mean days from intubation to extubation was 20.6 ± 9.9 days and survivor mean days from intubation to tracheostomy decannulation 46.6 ± 15.3 days. Time from hospital admission to discharge in survivors was a mean of 57.2 ± 25.8 days. Of the patients requiring extracorporeal support, the initial mode was veno-venous (VV) in 15 (83%), veno-arterial (VA) in 2 (11%) and veno-venous-arterial (VVA) in 1 (6%). On VV extracorporeal support, 2 (11%) required additional VVA. Renal replacement therapy was required in 10 (56%) of the patients. Anticoagulation target anti-Xa of 0.2-0.4 was set, with 10 (56%) patients having a deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism detected and 2 (11%) patients suffering an intracranial haemorrhage. Tracheostomy was performed in 9 (50%) of the patients and high-dose methylprednisolone was given to 7 (39%) of the patients. Conclusion: In our cohort of patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 respiratory failure, a long period of invasive ventilation and extracorporeal support was required but achieving good outcomes despite this. There was a significant burden of thromboembolic disease and renal injury. A significant proportion of patients required tracheostomy and steroids to facilitate weaning.","Akhtar, Waqas; Olusanya, Olusegun; Baladia, Marta Montero; Young, Harriet; Shah, Sachin",Indian J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg,551,26

The purpose of our study was to explore the undergraduate nursing students' satisfaction and perceptions about simulated video consultations using the high-fidelity simulation methodology. A mixed-method was utilized with 93 undergraduate nursing students using a validated satisfaction questionnaire (quantitative data), which included an observations section (qualitative data). Of the total sample, 97.8% of the students expressed a high overall satisfaction with simulated video consultations, highlighting their practical utility and positive learning outcomes. From the students' comments, two main themes and their related categories emerged: advantages (satisfaction and enjoyment, learning, and calmness during simulated scenarios), and disadvantages (technical issues and technical skills development). Simulated video consultations may be considered as one more high-fidelity simulation teaching option. Nursing students should be trained in this modality of healthcare to face the challenge brought on by its increased use in healthcare services, beyond the specific adaptation of clinical simulation sessions due to the closure of universities during this pandemic.","Jiménez-Rodríguez, Diana; Arrogante, Oscar",,551,26

The chest X-ray (CXR) is one of the alternatives to achieve fast diagnosis, but the unavailability of large-scale annotated data makes the clinical implementation of machine learning-based COVID detection difficult. Another issue is the usage of ImageNet pre-trained networks which does not extract reliable feature representations from medical images. In this paper, we propose the use of hierarchical convolutional network (HCN) architecture to naturally augment the data along with diversified features. The HCN uses the first convolution layer from COVIDNet followed by the convolutional layers from well-known pre-trained networks to extract the features. The use of the convolution layer from COVIDNet ensures the extraction of representations relevant to the CXR modality. We also propose the use of ECOC for encoding multiclass problems to binary classification for improving the recognition performance. Experimental results show that HCN architecture is capable of achieving better results in comparison with the existing studies. The proposed method can accurately triage potential COVID-19 patients through CXR images for sharing the testing load and increasing the testing capacity.","Dev, Kapal; Khowaja, Sunder Ali; Bist, Ankur Singh; Saini, Vaibhav; Bhatia, Surbhi",Neural Comput Appl,551,26

Few studies have explored the possible physiological changes in the liver although patients often self-medicate with ginseng preparations, which may lead to exceeding the recommended dose for long-term administration. Here, we analyzed changes in the hepatic proteins of mouse livers using quantitative proteomics after sub-chronic administration of Korean red ginseng (KRG) extract (control group and 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 g/kg KRG) using tandem mass tag (TMT) 6-plex technology. The 1.0 and 2.0 g/kg KRG groups exhibited signs of liver injury, including increased levels of aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) in the serum. Furthermore, serum glucose levels were significantly higher following KRG administration compared with the control group. Based on the upregulated proteins found in the proteomic analysis, we found that increased cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine gamma-lyase (CSE) levels promoted greater hydrogen sulfide (H2S) synthesis in the liver. This investigation provides novel evidence that sub-chronic administration of KRG can elevate H2S production by increasing protein expression of CBS and CSE in the liver.","Na, Ann-Yae; Jo, Jung Jae; Kwon, Oh Kwang; Cho, Piljoung; Gao, Yan; Kim, Ju-Hyun; Kim, Kyu Min; Ki, Sung Hwan; Lee, Sangkyu",Sci Rep,551,20

However, widespread curricular changes focused on integration of subjects and clinical content resulted in minimal contact hours for anatomical sciences and increasing reliance on adjunct online resources. The COVID-19 pandemic further highlighted the need for quality online teaching materials. Despite the central role online resources play in anatomical sciences, most remain subject-specific with minimal integration of other disciplines;thus, the educational effect of integrated online resources is unclear. To that end, two versions of a head and neck gross anatomy tutorial were created;although the gross anatomy content was identical, the experimental tutorial also integrated embryology of the head and neck. In a Colorado Multiple Institutional Review Board (COMIRB) exempt #20-2175 randomized single blind study, the first (DS1) and the second year (DS2) dental students enrolled in a gross anatomy course were recruited. The DS1s had never been exposed to the content of the tutorial while the DS2s had learned the content in the prior year. All participants completed a pre-test. Then the participants were randomly assigned to access either the control or the experimental tutorial before completing a post-test and a survey. DS1s also completed a retention test one week after completing the post-test. Seventy-one DS1s, and 71 DS2s completed the study. Both cohorts scored statistically higher in the post-test compared to the pre-test (Tukey HSD, all p's &lt; 0.001). The post-test performance increase for DS2s was significantly higher than for DS1s (main cohort effect: F(1,2) = 4.88, p &lt; 0.05, partial h2 = 0.06, Tukey HSD, p &lt; 0.05). A two-way repeated-measures ANOVA revealed a significantly higher retention test score compared to the pre-test scores for DS1 (Tukey HSD: p &lt; 0.01). Thematic analytics of the survey comments were mostly positive and similar across the experimental conditions. Notably, the experimental group indicated a positive perception of integrated embryology content attributed to providing context for gross anatomy. These findings suggest that a digital tutorial on head and neck anatomy leads to significant learning and short-term retention, regardless of integrated embryology content presentation, but based on thematic analysis students perceive the integrated content to be contextually valuable. The post-test increase difference between DS1 andDS2 indicate that the digital tutorials yield better outcomes as a review resource as opposed to an introductory resource.","Bunker, Hailey Stratford Jennifer Hight Marissa Orr Caley Lee Lisa",The FASEB Journal,551,16

Lombardy has been the most affected region in Italy: the current mortality rate of COVID-19 patients is 18.3% (10 022 deaths; April 10th) with hospitals in Lombardy having to expand the total number of ICU beds from 724 to 1381 to accommodate infected patients. There has been a drastic decrease in liver donors. From February 23rd until April 10th, 17 LTs were performed in Lombardy. Mean donor age was 49 years (range 18-74) whereas mean recipient age was 55 (13-69); mean MELD score was 12 (6-24). All donors underwent screening for SARS-CoV-2 prior to LT. Two patients tested positive after LT, and one patient died for COVID on POD 30. Sixteen patients are alive after an average of 30 days post-LT (range 3-46). 10 patients have been discharged. This study has found no specific reason concerning the safety of recipients, to stop LT programs. Several key lessons from our experience are reported. However, due to the complex circumstances which surround the viral outbreak, the cessation or a reduction in LT activity is a pragmatic requirement.","Maggi, Umberto; De Carlis, Luciano; Yiu, Daniel; Colledan, Michele; Regalia, Enrico; Rossi, Giorgio; Angrisani, Marco; Consonni, Dario; Fornoni, Gianluca; Piccolo, Giuseppe; DeFeo, T Maria",Am J Transplant,551,16

METHODS: Ninety-two patients with mild-to-moderate COVID19-associated ARDS were allocated to the placebo (45-cases) or NAC groups (47-cases). Besides standard-of-care treatment, the patients received either intravenous NAC at a dose of 40 mg/kg/day or the placebo for three consecutive days. The efficacy outcomes were overall mortality over 28-day, clinical status on day 28, based on the WHO Master Protocol, the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation, changes in ARDS-severity (based on the PaO2/FiO2 ratio), and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores 48 and 96 h after intervention, RESULTS: No differences were found in the 28-day mortality rate between the two groups (25.5% vs. 31.1% in the NAC and placebo groups, respectively). Although the distribution of the clinical status at day 28 shifted towards better outcomes in the NAC-treated group, it did not reach a statistical significance level (p value = 0.83). Similar results were achieved in terms of the proportion of patients who required invasive ventilator support (38.3% vs. 44.4%), the number of ventilator-free days (17.4 vs. 16.6), and median time of ICU and hospital stay. Results regarding the change in PaO2/FiO2 ratio and SOFA scores also showed no significant differences between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our pilot study did not support the potential benefits of intravenous NAC in treating patients with COVID-19-associated ARDS. More studies are needed to determine which COVID-19 patients benefit from the NAC administration. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial was registered at Clinicaltrials.gov (identifier code: IRCT20120215009014N355).

We make choices concerning the systems and questions we study. Our research then amplifies these choices into factors that influence the directions of future research by shaping our hypotheses, data analyses, interpretation, publication venues, and dissemination via other methods. But our choices are shaped by more than objective curiosity-we are influenced by cultural paradigms reinforced by societal upbringing and scientific indoctrination during training. This extends to the systems and data that we consider to be ethically obtainable or available for study, and who is considered qualified to do research, ask questions, and communicate about research. It is also influenced by the profitability of concepts like open-access-a system designed to improve equity, but which enacts gatekeeping in unintended but foreseeable ways. Creating truly integrative biology programs will require more than intentionally developing departments or institutes that allow overlapping expertise in two or more subfields of biology. Interdisciplinary work requires the expertise of large and diverse teams of scientists working together-this is impossible without an authentic commitment to addressing, not denying, racism when practiced by individuals, institutions, and cultural aspects of academic science. We have identified starting points for remedying how our field has discouraged and caused harm, but we acknowledge there is a long path forward.

METHODS: This is a retrospective study comparing the outcome of the neurosurgical patients treated from the beginning of lockdown in India on 25 March 2020 to 30 November 2020 with that of same period in the previous year, 2019. RESULTS: We had a total of 687 admissions under neurosurgery this year during the study period as compared to 2550 admissions in 2019. The total number of surgeries done under neurosurgery also showed a similar trend with only 654 surgeries in 2020 compared to 3165 surgeries in 2019. During COVID-19 times, a total of 474 patients were operated including both trauma and non-trauma cases. Out of the 50 COVID-19 suspect/ indeterminate patients who were operated upon, 5 patients turned out to be positive for COVID-19. Significant differences were seen in the mortality (p<0.01) and morbidity (p<0.01) among trauma patients on comparing COVID and pre-COVID periods. Similarly, a significant difference was observed in the mortality (p<0.001) and morbidity (p<0.001) in non-trauma patients.

This dynamic and global approach to health control is necessary to deal with the new paradigm of living with an infectious disease, which disrupts our individual freedom and behaviors. The challenge for policymakers consists of defining methods of lockdown-lifting and follow-up (middle-term rules) that best meet the needs for resumption of economic activity, societal wellbeing, and containment of the outbreak. There is no simple and ready-to-use way to do this since it means considering several competing objectives at the same time and continuously adapting the strategy and rules, ideally at local scale. We propose a framework for creating a precision evidence-based health policy that simultaneously considers public health, economic, and societal dimensions while accounting for constraints and uncertainty. It is based on the four following principles: integrating multiple and heterogeneous information, accepting navigation with uncertainty, adjusting the strategy dynamically with feedback mechanisms, and managing clusters through a multi-scalar conception. The evidence-based policy intervention for COVID-19 obtained includes scientific background via epidemiological modeling and bio-economic modeling. A set of quantitative and qualitative indicators are used as feedback to precisely monitor the societal-economic-epidemiological dynamics, allowing tightening or loosening of measures before epidemic damage (re-)occurs. Altogether, this allows an evidence-based policy that steers the strategy with precision and avoids any political shock.","Raboisson, Didier; Lhermie, Guillaume",Front. Public Health,551,16

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Seventy-three community-dwelling adults &#8805;65 years of age admitted for post-acute care from 2 SNFs from March 15, 2020, to May 30, 2020. MEASURE(S): COVID-19 status was determined from chart review. Frailty was measured with a deficit accumulation frailty index (FI), categorized into nonfrail, mild frailty, and moderate-to-severe frailty. The primary outcome was community discharge. Secondary outcomes included change in functional status from SNF admission to discharge, based on modified Barthel index (mBI) and continuous functional scale scored by physical (PT) and occupational therapists (OT). RESULTS: Among 73 admissions (31 COVID-19 negative, 42 COVID-19 positive), mean [standard deviation (SD)] age was 83.5 (8.8) and 42 (57.5%) were female, with mean FI of 0.31 (0.01) with no differences by COVID-19 status. The mean length of SNF stay for rehabilitation was 21.2 days (SD 11.1) for COVID-19 negative with 20 (64.5%) patients discharged to community, compared to 23.0 (SD 12.2) and 31 (73.8%) among patients who tested positive for COVID-19. Among those discharged to the community, all groups improved in mBI, PT, and OT score. Those with moderate-to-severe frailty (FI >0.35) had lower mBI scores on discharge [92.0 (6.7) not frail, 81.0 (15.4) mild frailty, 48.6 (20.4) moderate-to-severe frailty; P = .002], lower PT scores on discharge [54.2 (3.9) nonfrail, 51.5 (8.0) mild frailty, 37.1 (9.7) moderate-to-severe frailty; P = .002], and lower OT score on discharge [52.9 (3.2) nonfrail, 45.8 (9.4) mild frailty, 32.4 (7.4) moderate or worse frailty; P = .001].

Various private and government sectors of different countries allocated funding for research in multiple capacities. A significant portion of efforts has been devoted to information technology and service infrastructure development, including research on developing intelligent models and techniques for alerts, monitoring, early diagnosis, prevention, and other relevant services. As a result, many information resources have been created globally and are available for use. However, a defined structure to organize these resources into categories based on the nature and origin of the data are lacking. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to organize COVID-19 information resources into a well-defined structure to facilitate the easy identification of a resource, tracking information workflows, and to provide a guide for a contextual dashboard design and development. METHODS: A sequence of action research was performed that involved a review of COVID-19 efforts and initiatives on a global scale during the year 2020. Data were collected according to the defined structure of primary, secondary, and tertiary categories. Various techniques for descriptive statistical analysis were employed to gain insights into the data to help develop a conceptual framework to organize resources and track interactions between different resources. RESULTS: Investigating diverse information at the primary, secondary, and tertiary levels enabled us to develop a conceptual framework for COVID-19-related efforts and initiatives. The framework of resource categorization provides a gateway to access global initiatives with enriched metadata, and assists users in tracking the workflow of tertiary, secondary, and primary resources with relationships between various fragments of information. The results demonstrated mapping initiatives at the tertiary level to secondary level and then to the primary level to reach firsthand data, research, and trials. CONCLUSIONS: Adopting the proposed three-level structure allows for a consistent organization and management of existing COVID-19 knowledge resources and provides a roadmap for classifying future resources. This study is one of the earliest studies to introduce an infrastructure for locating and placing the right information at the right place. By implementing the proposed framework according to the stated guidelines, this study allows for the development of applications such as interactive dashboards to facilitate the contextual identification and tracking of interdependent COVID-19 knowledge resources.","Afzal, Muhammad; Hussain, Maqbool; Hussain, Jamil; Bang, Jaehun; Lee, Sungyoung",J Med Internet Res,551,10

This paper evaluates COVID-19 vaccine prioritization strategies proposed to date, focusing on their stated goals; the mechanisms through which the selected allocations affect the course and burden of the pandemic; and the main epidemiological, economic, logistical, and political issues that arise when setting the prioritization strategy. The paper uses a simple, age-stratified susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered model to quantitatively assess the performance of alternative prioritization strategies with respect to avoided deaths, avoided infections, and life-years gained. We demonstrate that prioritizing essential workers is a viable strategy for reducing the number of cases and years of life lost, while the largest reduction in deaths is achieved by prioritizing older adults in most scenarios, even if the vaccine is effective at blocking viral transmission. Uncertainty regarding this property and potential delays in dose delivery reinforce the call for prioritizing older adults. Additionally, we investigate the strength of the equity motive that would support an allocation strategy attaching absolute priority to essential workers for a vaccine that reduces infection-fatality risk.","Ferranna, Maddalena; Cadarette, Daniel; Bloom, David E",,551,22

METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 63 individuals attending a clozapine clinic within the Galway-Roscommon Mental Health Services to determine the impact of COVID-19 restrictions on anxiety and depressive symptoms, social and occupational functioning and quality of life, by utilising Likert scale data. The Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) and Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) were additionally utilised to measure anxiety symptoms cross-sectionally. RESULTS: Anxiety symptoms were low with a median BAI score of 4.0 and HAM-A score of 4.0. Likert scale measurements recorded only a modest adverse impact of COVID-19 restrictions on anxiety and depressive symptoms, quality of life and occupational and social functioning. Free-text comments from patients (n = 55), were grouped into five themes: neutral impact (n = 22), negative psychological impact (n = 13), negative social impact (n = 11), positive psychological impact (n = 5) and media coverage inducing anxiety (n = 4). CONCLUSIONS: Three months into the COVID-19 pandemic and its restrictions, the impact on individuals with treatment-resistant psychotic disorders attending a clozapine clinic has been modest, with preliminary evidence demonstrating minimal increases in subjective symptoms of anxiety and reduced social functioning. Reduced social engagements and supports attainable both within the community and from mental health services were noted by some participants.","Fahy, Y; Dineen, B; McDonald, C; Hallahan, B",Ir J Psychol Med,551,16

The paper identifies modularity and speed as keys to successful scale-up. On that basis four types of scale-up are identified: Smart, dumb, forced, and fumbled. Smart scale-up combines modularity and speed. Dumb scale-up is bespoke and slow, and very common. The paper presents examples of each type of scale-up, explaining why they were successful or not. Whether you are a small startup or Elon Musk trying to grow Tesla and SpaceX or Jeff Bezos scaling up Amazon - or you are the US, UK, Chinese, or other government trying to increase power production, expand your infrastructure, or make your health, education, and social services work better - modularity and speed are the answer to effective delivery, or so the paper argues. How well you deal with modularity and speed decides whether your efforts succeed or fail. Most ventures, existing or planned, are neither fully smart nor fully dumb, but have elements of both. Successful organizations work to tip the balance towards smart by (a) introducing elements of smart scale-up into existing ventures and (b) starting new, fully smart-scaled ventures, to make themselves less dumb and ever smarter.","Flyvbjerg, Bent",,551,1

The novel coronavirus caused a pandemic search for information with broad dissemination of false or misleading health information. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the quality and readability of online information about the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which was a trending topic on the internet, using validated instruments and relating the quality of information to its readability. METHODS: The search was based on the term ""Wuhan Coronavirus"" on the Google website (February 6, 2020). At the search time, the terms ""COVID-19"" or ""SARS-CoV-2"" (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) did not exist. Critical analysis was performed on the first 110 hits using the Health on the Net Foundation Code of Conduct (HONcode), the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) benchmark, the DISCERN instrument, and Google ranking. RESULTS: The first 110 websites were critically analyzed, and only 1.8% (n=2) of the websites had the HONcode seal. The JAMA benchmark showed that 39.1% (n=43) of the websites did not have any of the categories required by this tool, and only 10.0% (11/110) of the websites had the four quality criteria required by JAMA. The DISCERN score showed that 70.0% (n=77) of the websites were evaluated as having a low score and none were rated as having a high score. CONCLUSIONS: Nonhealth personnel and the scientific community need to be aware about the quality of the information they read and produce, respectively. The Wuhan coronavirus health crisis misinformation was produced by the media, and the misinformation was obtained by users from the internet. The use of the internet has a risk to public health, and, in cases like this, the governments should be developing strategies to regulate health information on the internet without censuring the population.

We try to explain this excess by considering effective interactions between the sterile neutrinos and the SM particles. In this paper, we present an effective model based on one-particle-irreducible interaction vertices at low energies that are induced from the SM gauge symmetric four-fermion operators at high energies. The effective interaction strength is constrained by the SM precision measurements, astrophysical and cosmological observations. We introduce a novel effective electromagnetic interaction between sterile neutrinos and SM neutrinos, which can successfully explain the XENON1T event rate through inelastic scattering of the sterile neutrino dark matter from Xenon electrons. We find that sterile neutrinos with masses around $90$ keV and specific effective coupling can fit well with the XENON1T data where the best fit points preserving DM constraints and possibly describe the anomalies in other experiments.","Shakeri, Soroush; Hajkarim, Fazlollah; Xue, She-Sheng",,551,2

STUDY DESIGN: In a two-year cohort study of 1,700 publicly insured women who delivered at eight hospitals in Texas, we identified those who had an unmet demand for tubal ligation prior to discharge from the hospital. We classified unmet demand as explicit or prompted based on survey questions that included a prompt regarding whether the respondent would like to have had a tubal ligation at the time of delivery. We assessed persistence of demand for permanent contraception, contraceptive use, and repeat pregnancies among all study participants who wanted but did not get a postpartum procedure. RESULTS: Some 426 women desired a postpartum tubal ligation; 219 (51%) obtained one prior to discharge. Among the 207 participants with unmet demand, 62 (30%) expressed an explicit preference for the procedure, while 145 (70%) were identified from the prompt. Most with unmet demand still wanted permanent contraception three months after delivery (156/184), but only 23 had obtained interval procedures. By 18 months, the probability of a woman with unmet demand conceiving a pregnancy that she would likely carry to term was 12.5% (95% C.I.: 8.3% - 18.5%). CONCLUSION: The majority of unmet demand for postpartum tubal ligation among publicly insured women in Texas was uncovered via a prompt and would not have been evident in clinical records or from consent forms. Women unable to obtain a desired procedure had a substantial chance of pregnancy within 18 months after delivery.

Patients and Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed in 692 patients with FEV1≥ 80% predicted;normal neutrophils and chest high-resolution computed tomography;and recurrent dyspnea, cough, wheeze, and chest tightness. Results: Compared with subjects negative for AHR (n=522), subjects positive for AHR (n=170) showed increased FENO values, peripheral eosinophils (EOS), and R5-R20;decreased FEV1, FEV1/Forced vital capacity (FVC), and forced expiratory flow (FEFs) (P≤ .001 for all). Small-airway dysfunction was identified in 104 AHR+ patients (61.17%), and 132 AHR− patients (25.29%) (P&lt; 0.001). The areas under the curve (AUCs) of variables used singly for an AHR diagnosis were lower than 0.77. Using joint models of FEF50%, FEF75%, or FEF25%-75% with FENO increased the AUCs to 0.845, 0.824, and 0.844, respectively, significantly higher than univariate AUCs (P &lt; 0.001 for all). Patients who reported chest tightness (n=75) had lower FEFs than patients who did not (P&lt; 0.001 for all). In subjects with chest tightness, the combination of FEF50% or FEF25%-75% with EOS also increased the AUCs substantially, to 0.815 and 0.816, respectively (P &lt; 0.001 for all versus the univariate AUCs). Conclusion: FENO combined with FEF50% and FEF25%-75% predict AHR in patients with normal FEV1. FEF25%-75%, FEF50%, or FEF25%-75% together with EOS also can potentially suggest asthma in patients with chest tightness.","Bao, Wuping Zhang Xue Yin Junfeng Han Lei Huang Zhixuan Bao Luhong Lv Chengjian Hao Huijuan Xue Yishu Zhou Xin Zhang Min",Journal of Asthma and Allergy,551,1

On September 17, 2020, a Utah correctional facility (facility A) received a report of laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in a dental health care provider (DHCP) who had treated incarcerated persons at facility A on September 14, 2020 while asymptomatic. On September 21, 2020, the roommate of an incarcerated person who had received dental treatment experienced COVID-19-compatible symptoms*; both were housed in block 1 of facility A (one of 16 occupied blocks across eight residential units). Two days later, the roommate received a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result, becoming the first person with a known-associated case of COVID-19 at facility A. During September 23-24, 2020, screening of 10 incarcerated persons who had received treatment from the DHCP identified another two persons with COVID-19, prompting isolation of all three patients in an unoccupied block at the facility. Within block 1, group activities were stopped to limit interaction among staff members and incarcerated persons and prevent further spread. During September 14-24, 2020, six facility A staff members, one of whom had previous close contact with one of the patients, also reported symptoms. On September 27, 2020, an outbreak was confirmed after specimens from all remaining incarcerated persons in block 1 were tested; an additional 46 cases of COVID-19 were identified, which were reported to the Salt Lake County Health Department and the Utah Department of Health. On September 30, 2020, CDC, in collaboration with both health departments and the correctional facility, initiated an investigation to identify factors associated with the outbreak and implement control measures. As of January 31, 2021, a total of 1,368 cases among 2,632 incarcerated persons (attack rate = 52%) and 88 cases among 550 staff members (attack rate = 16%) were reported in facility A. Among 33 hospitalized incarcerated persons, 11 died.

Main symptoms were exhaustion and cough, exposition to other COVID-19-patients appeared frequently. BACKGROUND: There is urgent need for information on predictive parameters on immunity and infectivity in Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Our aim was to investigate distribution of novel Coronavirus 2019 (SARS-CoV-2) infections in a German General Practice and to learn about possible predictive parameters regarding infection and pathways of transmission. METHODS: In our cross-sectional study, we tested 347 patients of our General Practice using 2019-nCoV-2-IgG/IgM antibody test [2019-nCoV2 IgG/IgM Rapid Test Cassette (Ref.: INCP-402/INCP-402B; ACRO, BIOTECH, INC.)]. We asked for 13 specific symptoms and 4 questions to investigate patients' surroundings. RESULTS: A total of 107 of 347 patients were tested positive for antibodies (Immunoglobulin M-positive and/or Immunoglobulin G-positive). In antibody-positive group, body aches and rhinorrhea were seen more often and there were significantly less asymptomatic patients. Stay in area of risk was significantly more frequent in antibody-positive group as well as contact to infected persons. Distribution of other symptoms was not significantly different between both groups. Most adults or children with SARS-CoV-2 infection presented with mild flu-like symptoms. CONCLUSION: A total of 30% of patients had antibodies. It was not possible to identify one solid predictive symptom. Serological testing may be helpful for the diagnosis of suspected patients with negative RT-PCR results and for the identification of asymptomatic infections.","Paar, Moritz; Strumann, Christoph; Giesen, Heinz",Ir. j. med. sci,551,16

One negative consequence of the ongoing pandemic is anxiety brought about by uncertainty and the COVID-19 disease. Increased anxiety is a potential risk factor for wellbeing at work. This study investigated psychological, situational, and socio-demographic predictors of COVID-19 anxiety using longitudinal data. Methods: A nationally representative sample of Finnish workers (N = 1308) was collected before and during the COVID-19 crisis. Eighty percent of the participants responded to the follow-up study (N = 1044). COVID-19 anxiety was measured with a modified Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Psychological and situational predictors included perceived loneliness, psychological distress, technostress, personality, social support received from the work community, and remote working. A number of socio-demographic factors were also investigated. Results: Perceived loneliness, psychological distress, technostress, and neuroticism were identified as robust psychological predictors of COVID-19 anxiety. Increase in psychological distress and technostress during the COVID-19 crisis predicted higher COVID-19 anxiety. A recent change in their field of work and decreased social support from work communities predicted COVID-19 anxiety. Women and young people experienced higher anxiety. Conclusions: Different factors explain workers' COVID-19 anxiety. Increased anxiety can disrupt wellbeing at work, emphasizing the organizations' role in maintaining an inclusive and caring work culture and providing technical and psychological support to workers during crisis.","Savolainen, Iina; Oksa, Reetta; Savela, Nina; Celuch, Magdalena; Oksanen, Atte",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),551,20

Only 0.44% of advertisements mentioned COVID-19, mostly after WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic. No traders discussed the role of trade in spreading diseases; instead, posts stimulated the trade in wild species during lockdown. COVID-19 potentially offers persuasive arguments for reducing wildlife trade and consumption. This effect was not demonstrated by on-the-ground actors involved in this market.

Indeed, Lombardy and Emilia Romagna are Italian regions with both the highest level of virus lethality in the world and one of Europe's most polluted area. Based on this correlation, this paper analyzes the possible link between pollution and the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome and eventually death. We provide evidence that people living in an area with high levels of pollutant are more prone to develop chronic respiratory conditions and suitable to any infective agent. Moreover, a prolonged exposure to air pollution leads to a chronic inflammatory stimulus, even in young and healthy subjects. We conclude that the high level of pollution in Northern Italy should be considered an additional co-factor of the high level of lethality recorded in that area.","Conticini, Edoardo; Frediani, Bruno; Caro, Dario",Environ Pollut,551,2

FIP is often challenging to diagnose, affects highly adoptable kittens and young cats, and creates prognostic uncertainty for healthy siblings of affected cats. FCoV is an enteric pathogen of cats that is often endemic in shelters and other multi-cat environments. Infection with FCoV generally occurs through fecal-oronasal transmission, most commonly through shared litterboxes contaminated with the virus. In some cases, more virulent strains of FCoV result in more severe FECV-related disease or an increased likelihood of mutation to FIPV. In others, the stress or immune status of the host plays a role in both decreased immune response and increased levels of shedding.","Berliner, Elizabeth A.; Bou-Fakhredin, Rayan Daadaa Hisham Koussa Suzanne Abou Nasr Therese Noun Peter Taher Ali T.",Infectious Disease Management in Animal Shelters,551,16

To this end, we annotate 2.3k English and German tweets for (anti-)solidarity expressions, utilizing multiple human annotators and two annotation approaches (experts vs.\ crowds). We use these annotations to train a BERT model with multiple data augmentation strategies. Our augmented BERT model that combines both expert and crowd annotations outperforms the baseline BERT classifier trained with expert annotations only by over 25 points, from 58\% macro-F1 to almost 85\%. We use this high-quality model to automatically label over 270k tweets between September 2019 and December 2020. We then assess the automatically labeled data for how statements related to European (anti-)solidarity discourses developed over time and in relation to one another, before and during the COVID-19 crisis. Our results show that solidarity became increasingly salient and contested during the crisis. While the number of solidarity tweets remained on a higher level and dominated the discourse in the scrutinized time frame, anti-solidarity tweets initially spiked, then decreased to (almost) pre-COVID-19 values before rising to a stable higher level until the end of 2020.","Ils, Alexandra; Liu, Dan; Grunow, Daniela; Eger, Steffen",,551,24

The fear of painful needles is one of the primary reasons most people avoid getting vaccinated. Therefore, developing an alternative pain-free method of vaccination using microneedles has been a significant research area. Microneedles comprise arrays of micron-sized needles that offer a pain-free method of delivering actives across the skin. Apart from being pain-free, microneedles provide various advantages over conventional vaccination routes such as intramuscular and subcutaneous. Microneedle vaccines induce a robust immune response as the needles ranging from 50 to 900 μm in length can efficiently deliver the vaccine to the epidermis and the dermis region, which contains many Langerhans and dendritic cells. The microneedle array looks like band-aid patches and offers the advantages of avoiding cold-chain storage and self-administration flexibility. The slow release of vaccine antigens is an important advantage of using microneedles. The vaccine antigens in the microneedles can be in solution or suspension form, encapsulated in nano or microparticles, and nucleic acid-based. The use of microneedles to deliver particle-based vaccines is gaining importance because of the combined advantages of particulate vaccine and pain-free immunization. The future of microneedle-based vaccines looks promising however, addressing some limitations such as dosing inadequacy, stability and sterility will lead to successful use of microneedles for vaccine delivery. This review illustrates the recent research in the field of microneedle-based vaccination.","Menon, Ipshita Bagwe Priyal Keegan Braz Gomes Bajaj Lotika Gala Rikhav Uddin Mohammad N.; Martin, J.

We describe the trends of the age and gender stratified outcomes among hospitalized COVID-19 patients with moderate to severe illness at the largest dedicated tertiary care COVID-19 government hospital in New Delhi, India. A retrospective cohort study through secondary data analysis from in-patient hospital data of patients admitted from April 1 to November 15, 2020 was conducted. The data of 10,314 laboratory-confirmed patients with COVID-19 was analyzed, of which 8899 (86.28%) were discharged after recovery, and 1415 (13.72%) died. The mean (SD) age of the hospitalized patients was 46.43 (18.74) years (n = 10,309) including 6031 (58.50%) male and 4278 (41.50%) female patients (n = 10,309). On bivariate analysis, increasing age was associated with significantly higher odds of mortality in both gender (p < .001). The mortality rate in female patients was lower (11.92%) compared with male patients (15.75%) (p = .675). However, elderly women had the highest odds of mortality (p < .001), indicating the possible role of delayed health seeking behavior, secondary to familial, and social neglect. Mortality in the patients with COVID-19 also occurred early after admission suggesting rapid deterioration, delayed reporting by patients, or their late referral from other health facilities. However, the overall statewide recovery rate showed steady improvement since the onset of the pandemic. In contrast, the recovery rate among the moderate-severe cases that were hospitalized at this tertiary care center during the same period reflected a lower nonspecific zigzag pattern indicating limited effectiveness of the COVID-19 treatment regimens.","Malhotra, Vikas; Basu, Saurav; Sharma, Nandini; Kumar, Suresh; Garg, Sandeep; Dushyant, Kumar; Borle, Amod",J. med. virol,551,16

We aimed to explore the risk factors of 14-day and 28-day mortality and develop a model for predicting 14-day and 28-day survival probability among adult hospitalized patients with COVID-19. METHODS: In this multicenter, retrospective, cohort study, we examined 828 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 hospitalized in Wuhan Union Hospital and Central Hospital of Wuhan between January 12 and February 9, 2020. Among the 828 patients, 516 and 186 consecutive patients admitted in Wuhan Union Hospital were enrolled in the training cohort and the validation cohort, respectively. A total of 126 patients hospitalized in Central Hospital of Wuhan were enrolled in a second external validation cohort. Demographic, clinical, radiographic, and laboratory measures; treatment; proximate causes of death; and 14-day and 28-day mortality are described. Patients' data were collected by reviewing the medical records, and their 14-day and 28-day outcomes were followed up. RESULTS: Of the 828 patients, 146 deaths were recorded until May 18, 2020. In the training set, multivariate Cox regression indicated that older age, lactate dehydrogenase level over 360 U/L, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio higher than 8.0, and direct bilirubin higher than 5.0 µmol/L were independent predictors of 28-day mortality. Nomogram scoring systems for predicting the 14-day and 28-day survival probability of patients with COVID-19 were developed and exhibited strong discrimination and calibration power in the two external validation cohorts (C-index, 0.878 and 0.839). CONCLUSION: Older age, high lactate dehydrogenase level, evaluated neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, and high direct bilirubin level were independent predictors of 28-day mortality in adult hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19. The nomogram system based on the four factors revealed good discrimination and calibration, suggesting good clinical utility.","Zhang, Shuai; Guo, Mengfei; Duan, Limin; Wu, Feng; Hu, Guorong; Wang, Zhihui; Huang, Qi; Liao, Tingting; Xu, Juanjuan; Ma, Yanling; Lv, Zhilei; Xiao, Wenjing; Zhao, Zilin; Tan, Xueyun; Meng, Daquan; Zhang, Shujing; Zhou, E; Yin, Zhengrong; Geng, Wei; Wang, Xuan; Zhang, Jianchu; Chen, Jianguo; Zhang, Yu; Jin, Yang",Crit Care,551,23

Among these, coronavirus is identified as a prime culprit ranging from its involvement in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) to COVID-19. These infections involved in huge healthcare and economic cost incurred globally. Every time, coronavirus improved its infection ability and surprised the medical practitioners and researchers. Currently, COVID-19 is also causing numerous infections and stalled global activities. Global efforts are underway to identify potential viral targets for management of these outbreaks, but significant progress in prevention of these outbreaks is not yet achieved. We explored host-pathogen protein-protein interactions of MERS, SARS and COVID-19, and identified host targets common among all recent coronavirus outbreaks. Further, we tried to understand their potential for management of coronavirus. The common proteins involved in coronavirus host-pathogen interactions indicate their indispensable role in the pathogenesis and therefore targeting these proteins can give strategies to prevent current and future coronavirus outbreaks. Viral variability necessitates development of new therapeutic modalities for every outbreak, in contrast targeting necessary human proteins required by all coronaviruses can provide us a clue to prevent current and future coronavirus outbreaks. We found that targeting FURIN and TMPRSS2 can provide good results due to their common involvement in current and previous outbreaks. We also listed some known molecules against these two targets for their potential drug repurposing evaluation. Although, several recent studies undergoing with targeting these proteins for management of coronavirus, but safety evaluation and risk assessment must be given prime importance while targeting human proteins.","Khan, Abdul Arif; Khan, Zakir",Brief. bioinform,551,24

484408,484408,484408,Antimalarials widely used against COVID-19 heighten risk of cardiac arrest. How can doctors minimize the danger?,16.422781,5.70486,2020,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) death rates in the countries of the West exceed those in the countries of the East by factors ranging from 10-1 to 100-1. In this paper, we refer to the West as represented by United States plus the five most populous countries of Western Europe, and the East as the 15 countries of East Asia and Oceania that are members of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP). This paper argues that the currently available information points to the factors most responsible for this divide. Warnings by early January 2020 about an atypical viral pneumonia in Wuhan, China, prompted rapid responses in many jurisdictions in East Asia. Publication of the virus's genome on 10 January 2020 provided essential information for making diagnostic tests and launching vaccine development. China's lockdown of Wuhan on 23 January 2020 provided a final, decisive signal of the danger of the new disease. By late March 2020, China had fully controlled its epidemic, and many other RCEP countries had taken early and decisive measures that aborted serious outcomes. Delayed and halting responses in the United States and most other Western countries allowed the disease to take hold and spread. In both the East and the West, stringent population-wide non-pharmaceutical interventions were widely implemented at great cost to societies, economies, and school systems. Without these measures, the outcomes could have been even worse. Most countries in the East also implemented tightly focused policies to isolate infectious individuals. Even today, most countries in the West allow infectious individuals to mingle with their families, coworkers, and communities. Much of the East-West divide plausibly results from failure in the West to implement the basic public health policies of early action and the isolation of infectious individuals. Widespread immunization in high-income countries will soon attenuate their outbreaks, while the slow rollout of vaccines in lower income countries is replacing the East-West divide in outcomes with a North-South one. The South will then replace the West as the breeding ground for more contagious or pathogenic variants of the virus.","Jamison, Dean T; Wu, Kin Bing",,551,10

METHODS: Pediatric patients aged between 0 and 18 years old with confirmed diagnosis of TTFs who were treated at our center between April 2020 and May 2020 were included in the study. In addition to demographics, mechanism injury, treatment modalities, complications were also noted. RESULTS: Sixteen patients were included in the study. The mean age was 14.8 ± 0.9 years (range: 13-16 years). The mean BMI of patients was 26.3 ± 2.3 kg/m2 (range: 23.2-30.4 kg/m2). According to the BMI-for-age percentiles growth chart, eight patients (50%) were overweight, and eight patients (50%) were at a risk of being categorized as overweight. The most common cause for the injury was jumping due to basketball (50%). Twelve of 16 patients were treated operatively by open reduction and internal fixation. The remaining 4 patients were treated non-operatively with long leg cast. CONCLUSION: The incidence of TTFs was 16 cases over about two months during the pandemic isolation period. Our results demonstrated that all adolescent TTFs occurred during periods when outdoor activities were permitted. This finding may be explained by sudden athletic activity after prolonged immobilization. We observed that all of our patients were male and either overweight or at risk of being overweight.","Köksal, Alper; Öner, Ali; Çimen, Osman; Akgün, Hakan; Kocaoglu, Alptekin; Yapici, Furkan",J. orthop. sci,551,6

In this study, we aimed to investigate the COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and affecting factors in healthcare professionals. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional online survey conducted in 1574 healthcare professionals consisting of physicians, nurses, dentists, pharmacists, and healthcare personnel in Turkey in December 2020. Demographic, attitudinal, and Fear of COVID-19 Scale scores of healthcare professionals were investigated in this survey. RESULTS: About 84.6% of healthcare professionals declared willingness to accept the COVID-19 vaccine whenever possible. Most physicians (90.4%) stated to receive the COVID-19 vaccine, while 66.5% of nurses, 73.9% of healthcare personnel, also preferred to have it as soon as the vaccine was available. Factors affecting the willingness to accept the COVID-19 vaccine were found to be advanced age, male gender, working in a primary health care center, living with family, having a child, having a chronic disease, having high Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FC-19S) scores. While the group with the highest vaccine rejection rate was nurses with 33.5%, FC-19S scores were significantly higher in nurses who wanted to be vaccinated. In multivariate regression analyses, factors related to the acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine were identified as advanced age, routine adult vaccination, no history of COVID-19, and recommendation of the COVID-19 vaccine. CONCLUSION: A high proportion of healthcare professionals declared their willingness to accept the COVID-19 vaccine, and hence, this will play a leading role in optimizing the vaccination rate of the entire population while combating the pandemic.","Kaplan, Askin Keskin; Sahin, Mustafa Kursat; Parildar, Hulya; Adadan Guvenc, Isil",Int J Clin Pract,551,20

Modeling and simulation of such problems pose an additional challenge of continuously evolving training data in which the model parameters change over time depending upon external factors. Our main contribution is that in a scenario of continuously evolving training data, unlike typical deep learning techniques, this non-intrusive algorithm eliminates the need to retrain or rebuild the model from scratch every time a new training data set is received. After validating the model, we use it to study the impact of different strategies for epidemic control. Finally, we propose and simulate a strategy of controlled natural immunization through risk-based population compartmentalization (PC) wherein the population is divided in Low Risk (LR) and High Risk (HR) compartments based on risk factors (like comorbidities and age) and subjected to different disease transmission dynamics by isolating the HR compartment while allowing the LR compartment to develop natural immunity. Upon release from the preventive isolation, the HR compartment finds itself surrounded by enough number of immunized individuals to prevent the spread of infection and thus most of the deaths occurring in this group are avoided.","Farooq, Junaid; Bazaz, Mohammad Abid",Chaos Solitons Fractals,551,15

We aimed to confirm that GRP78 gene expression was increased in blood of SARS-CoV-2 (+) versus SARS-CoV-2 (−) pneumonia patients. In addition, we aimed to identify drugs that could be repurposed to inhibit GRP78, thus with potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. Gene expression studies were performed in 10 SARS-CoV-2 (−) and 24 SARS-CoV-2 (+) pneumonia patients. A structure-based virtual screen was performed with 10,761 small molecules retrieved from DrugBank, using the GRP78 nucleotide binding domain and substrate binding domain as molecular targets. Results indicated that GRP78 mRNA levels were approximately four times higher in the blood of SARS-CoV-2 (+) versus SARS-CoV-2 (−) pneumonia patients, further suggesting that GRP78 might be a good molecular target to treat Covid-19. In addition, a total of 409 compounds were identified with potential as GRP78 inhibitors. In conclusion, we found preliminary evidence that further proposes GRP78 as a possible molecular target to treat Covid-19 and that many clinically approved drugs bind GRP78 as an off-target effect. We suggest that further work should be urgently carried out to confirm if GRP78 is indeed a good molecular target and if some of those drugs have potential to be repurposed for SARS-CoV-2 antiviral activity.","Palmeira, Andreia; Sousa, Emília; Köseler, Aylin; Sabirli, Ramazan; Gören, Tarık; Türkçüer, İbrahim; Kurt, Özgür; Pinto, Madalena M.; Vasconcelos, M.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) results demonstrate the presence of enriched Ba2CoO4 phase at 400 °C and multiphase structures: BaCoO3, BaCoO3-Î´, and Co3O4 with a decrease in the amount of Ba2CoO4 at 500 °C. The prepared powders are characterized by a high specific surface area (SSA) values which are reflected to the mode of synthesis that leads to produce materials with massive active sites. The SSA of BC4 is higher than that of BC5 which can be correlated to the difference in the microstructure analysis of BC4 and BC5 as given from scanning electron microscope (SEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) studies. Electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy as an effective method for the characterization of vacancy-rich nanostructures indicates that the presence of oxygen vacancies is related mainly to BaCoO3, BaCoO3-Î´, and Co3O4 phases while the effective oxygen vacancies is in BaCoO3 and BaCoO3-Î´.

We find that high levels of overexposure can drive system dynamics towards a backward phenomenology and that increasing people awareness through balanced and aware information can be crucial to avoid dangerous dynamical transitions as hysteresis or transient oscillations before disease eradication. Investigations in the time dependent regimes are provided to support the results. Google Trends data in the context of Covid19 are also used to stress how low levels of awareness, combined with high overexposure, can be related to recent episodes of epidemic resurgence in Europe.

The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between serum interleukin 6 (IL-6) and surfactant protein D (SP-D) levels and the clinical course and prognosis of COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included a total of 108 individuals: 88 patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 by real-time PCR of nasopharyngeal swab samples and admitted to the Atatürk University Pulmonary Diseases and the Erzurum City Hospital Infectious Diseases department between March 24 and April 15, and 20 asymptomatic healthcare workers who had negative real-time PCR results during routine COVID-19 screening in our hospital. RESULTS: Patients who developed macrophage activation syndrome had significantly higher IL-6 and SP-D levels at the time of admission and on day 5 of treatment compared to the other patients (IL-6: p = 0.001 for both; SP-D: p = 0.02, p = 0.04). Patients who developed acute respiratory distress syndrome had significantly higher IL-6 and SP-D levels at both time points compared to those who did not (p = 0.001 for all). Both parameters at the time of admission were also significantly higher among nonsurvivors compared to survivors (IL-6: p = 0.001, SP-D: p = 0.03). CONCLUSION: In addition to IL-6, which has an important role in predicting course and planning treatment in COVID-19, SP-D may be a novel pneumoprotein that can be used in the clinical course, follow-up, and possibly in future treatments.","Kerget, Bugra; Kerget, Ferhan; Koçak, Abdullah Osman; Kiziltunç, Ahmet; Araz, Ömer; Uçar, Elif Yilmazel; Akgün, Metin",Lung,551,16

BACKGROUND: Workplace violence has emerged as a crucial determinant of turnover intention for health care workers. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among Chinese health care workers (N = 1,063) between 13 and 20 February 2020. Mediation effects were tested using structural equation modelling with weighted least squares mean and variance adjusted (WLSMV) estimator. RESULTS: Workplace violence had both direct and indirect effects on turnover intention among Chinese health care workers. Specifically, perceived social support, mental health and perceived social support together with mental health partially mediated the relationship between workplace violence and turnover intention. CONCLUSIONS: Chinese health care workers experiencing violence during the COVID-19 outbreak were more likely to report turnover intention. Enhancing social support and reducing mental health problems would be beneficial in decreasing the detrimental effects of workplace violence on turnover intention. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: Ensuring health care workers' health and safety is vital in reducing turnover intention, which in turn ascertains continuity of health care delivery. Health care managers should develop targeted interventions to improve social support and prevent post-violence mental health problems.","Yang, Yinmei; Wang, Peigang; Kelifa, Mohammedhamid Osman; Wang, Bo; Liu, Mingxiu; Lu, Lili; Wang, Wei",J. nurs. manag,551,3

METHODS: During the period of May 1-4, 2020, we administered an anonymous electronic survey to all neurology faculty and housestaff to assess the potential psychosocial impacts of COVID-19. The survey also addressed how our institution and department are responding to these challenges. This report outlines the psychosocial concerns of neurology faculty and housestaff and the multifaceted support services that our department and institution are offering in response. Faculty and housestaff cohorts were compared with regard to frequencies of binary responses (yes/ no) using the Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: Among 130 total survey respondents (91/191 faculty [48%] and 37/62 housestaff [60%]), substantial proportions of both groups self-reported having increased fear (79%), anxiety (83%) and depression (38%) during the COVID-19 pandemic. These proportions were not significantly different between the faculty and housestaff groups. Most respondents reported that the institution had provided adequate counseling and support services (91%) and that the department had rendered adequate emotional support (92%).

In this context, a possible vaccine is perhaps the most highly regarded prospect to combat the novel coronavirus and enable societies to lift COVID related restrictions. Governments and other institutions around the world have invested large amounts of resources into the development, testing, and production capacity for several different vaccines. When vaccines become available, public health authorities will need information about the concerns and decision-making considerations of constituents. We outline here the key findings from interviews with residents of Ontario, Canada, (n=40) in July and August of 2020 regarding their views, concerns, and intentions with respect to a prospective COVID-19 vaccine. In particular, participants expressed concern about the safety and efficacy of any prospective vaccine that is developed in a short timeframe, despite eagerness to eventually take it. Additionally, participants expressed considerations that, while not directly related to vaccines, nevertheless factored into their attitudes about accepting a possible COVID vaccination. These included how successful governments have managed COVID- 19 so far, existing relationships with healthcare providers, and how they have assessed their risk of contracting or becoming very ill from COVID-19. Trust in science, regulators, and governments will play a critical role in the successful deployment of a COVID-19 vaccine. Governments and public health institutions can take actions to earn trust. Implementing monitoring programs for long-term adverse effects would measure and potentially mitigate risk of unforeseen effects. Supports that provide financial and social stability during the wait for rigorously tested vaccines may increase trust in governments to act in the best interest of their constituents.","Vikse, J.; Nelson, V.; O039,; Doherty, K.",BMJ Open,551,1

It is estimated that 1-4% of these patients will die, up to 15% will have serious postoperative morbidity, and 5-15% will be readmitted within 30 days. An annual global mortality of around 8 million patients places major surgery comparable with the leading causes of death from cardiovascular disease and stroke, cancer and injury. If surgical complications were classified as a pandemic, like HIV/AIDS or coronavirus (COVID-19), developed countries would work together and devise an immediate action plan and allocate resources to address it. Seeking to reduce preventable deaths and post-surgical complications would save billions of dollars in healthcare costs. Part of the global problem resides in differences in institutional practice patterns in high- and low-income countries, and part from a lack of effective perioperative drug therapies to protect the patient from surgical stress. We briefly review the history of surgical stress and provide a path forward from a systems-based approach. Key to progress is recognizing that the anesthetized brain is still physiologically 'awake' and responsive to the sterile stressors of surgery. New intravenous drug therapies are urgently required after anesthesia and before the first incision to prevent the brain from switching to sympathetic overdrive and activating secondary injury progression such as hyperinflammation, coagulopathy, immune activation and metabolic dysfunction. A systems-based approach targeting central nervous system-mitochondrial coupling may help drive research to improve outcomes following major surgery in civilian and military medicine.","Dobson, Geoffrey P",Int J Surg,551,24

In this study, we aimed to identify whether loneliness and physical activity were associated with worse mental health during a period of mandatory social distancing in the UK. DESIGN: Population-based observational cohort study. SETTING: Mental health data collected online during COVID-19 from an existing sample of adults aged 50 and over taking part in a longitudinal study of aging. All had comparable annual data collected between 2015 and 2019. PARTICIPANTS: Three-thousand two-hundred and eighty-one participants aged 50 and over. MEASUREMENTS: Trajectories of depression (measured by PHQ-9) and anxiety (measured by GAD-7) between 2015 and 2020 were analyzed with respect to loneliness, physical activity levels, and a number of socioeconomic and demographic characteristics using zero-inflated negative binomial regression. RESULTS: In 2020, PHQ-9 score for loneliness, adjusted for covariates, was 3.23 (95% CI: 3.01-3.44), an increase of around 1 point on all previous years in this group and 2 points higher than people not rated lonely, whose score did not change in 2020 (1.22, 95% CI: 1.12-1.32). PHQ-9 was 2.60 (95% CI: 2.43-2.78) in people with decreased physical activity, an increase of .5 on previous years. In contrast, PHQ-9 in 2020 for people whose physical activity had not decreased was 1.66, 95% CI: 1.56-1.75, similar to previous years. A similar relationship was observed for GAD-7 though the absolute burden of symptoms lower. CONCLUSION: After accounting for pre-COVID-19 trends, we show that experiencing loneliness and decreased physical activity are risk factors for worsening mental health during the pandemic. Our findings highlight the need to examine policies which target these potentially modifiable risk factors.","Creese, Byron; Khan, Zunera; Henley, William; O039,; Dwyer, Siobhan; Corbett, Anne; Vasconcelos Da Silva, Miguel; Mills, Kathryn; Wright, Natalie; Testad, Ingelin; Aarsland, Dag; Ballard, Clive",Int Psychogeriatr,551,32

Participants in each experimental group (N95SUB, N95MAX; SURSUB, SURMAX; SUB, MAX) were assessed for their hemodynamic and hematologic function at baseline and during recovery after exercise. RESULTS: No significant differences were noted for either hemodynamic or hematologic function at post-exercise as compared to baseline with regard to mask modality (P > 0.05). Heart rate (HR) for maximal intensity were significantly greater at 1 min post-exercise in N95 as compared to SURGICAL (P < 0.05).

A separate, patient-reported study associated famotidine use with improvements in mild to moderate symptoms such as cough and shortness of breath. While a prospective, multi-center clinical study is ongoing, two parallel in silico studies have proposed one of the two SARS-CoV-2 proteases, 3CLpro or PLpro, as potential molecular targets of famotidine activity; however, this remains to be experimentally validated. In this report, we systematically analyzed the effect of famotidine on viral proteases and virus replication. Leveraging a series of biophysical and enzymatic assays, we show that famotidine neither binds with nor inhibits the functions of 3CLpro and PLpro. Similarly, no direct antiviral activity of famotidine was observed at concentrations of up to 200 µM, when tested against SARS-CoV-2 in two different cell lines, including a human cell line originating from lungs, a primary target of COVID-19.

The aim of the present study was to assess and understand the impact of four different lockdown phases (LD1, LD2, LD3 and LD4) on five air pollutants (particulate matter (PM) PM2.5, PM10, nitrogen oxide (NOx), sulfur dioxide (SO2) and ozone (O3)) compared to before lockdown (BLD) at 13 air monitoring stations in and around New Delhi. Methods: Secondary data on five criteria pollutants for 13 monitoring stations in and around New Delhi for the period 1 March to 31 May 2020 was accessed from the Central Pollution Control Bard, New Delhi. Data were statistically analyzed across lockdown phases, meteorological variables, and prevailing air sources around the monitoring stations. Results. Pollutant concentrations decreased during LD1 compared to BLD except for O3 at all stations. PM2.5 and PM10 remained either close to or higher than the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) due to prevailing high-speed winds. During lockdown phases, NO2 decreased, whereas O3 consistently increased at all stations. This was a paradoxical situation as O3 is formed via photochemical reactions among NOx and volatile organic compounds. Principal component analysis (PCA) extracted two principal components (PC1 and PC2) which explained up to 80% of cumulative variance in data. PM2.5, PM10 and NO2 were associated with PC1, whereas PC2 had loadings of either O3 only or O3 and SO2 depending upon monitoring station. Conclusions. The present study found that air pollutants decreased during lockdown phases, but these decreases were specific to the site(s) and pollutant(s). The decrease in pollutant concentrations during lockdown could not be attributed completely to lockdown conditions as the planetary boundary layer increased two-fold during lockdown compared to the BLD phase. Such restrictions could be applied in the future to control air pollution but should be approached with caution. Competing Interests. The authors declare no competing financial interests. © 2021.

Coronaviruses are categorized as major pathogenic viruses causing a variety of diseases in birds and mammals including humans (lethal respiratory dysfunctions). Nowadays, a new strain of coronaviruses is identified and named as SARS-CoV-2. Multiple cases of SARS-CoV-2 attacks are being reported all over the world. SARS-CoV-2 showed high death rate; however, no specific treatment is available against SARS-CoV-2. Methods: In the current study, immunoinformatics approaches were employed to predict the antigenic epitopes against SARS-CoV-2 for the development of the coronavirus vaccine. Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte and B-cell epitopes were predicted for SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus protein. Multiple sequence alignment of three genomes (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2) was used to conserved binding domain analysis. Results: The docking complexes of 4 CTL epitopes with antigenic sites were analyzed followed by binding affinity and binding interaction analyses of top-ranked predicted peptides with MHC-I HLA molecule. The molecular docking (Food and Drug Regulatory Authority library) was performed, and four compounds exhibiting least binding energy were identified. The designed epitopes lead to the molecular docking against MHC-I, and interactional analyses of the selected docked complexes were investigated. In conclusion, four CTL epitopes (GTDLEGNFY, TVNVLAWLY, GSVGFNIDY, and QTFSVLACY) and four FDA-scrutinized compounds exhibited potential targets as peptide vaccines and potential biomolecules against deadly SARS-CoV-2, respectively. A multiepitope vaccine was also designed from different epitopes of coronavirus proteins joined by linkers and led by an adjuvant. Conclusion: Our investigations predicted epitopes and the reported molecules that may have the potential to inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 virus. These findings can be a step towards the development of a peptide-based vaccine or natural compound drug target against SARS-CoV-2.","Waqas, Muhammad; Haider, Ali; Rehman, Abdur; Qasim, Muhammad; Umar, Ahitsham; Sufyan, Muhammad; Akram, Hafiza Nisha; Mir, Asif; Razzaq, Roha; Rasool, Danish; Tahir, Rana Adnan; Sehgal, Sheikh Arslan",Biomed Res Int,551,1

As a case study, we investigate cognitive networks tied to key concepts of computational thinking provided by: (i) 159 high school students enrolled in a science curriculum and (ii) 59 researchers in complex systems and simulations. Researchers' reconstructed forma mentis highlighted a positive mindset about scientific modelling, semantically framing data and simulations as ways of discovering nature. Students correctly identified different aspects of logic reasoning but perceived""computation""as a distressing, anxiety-eliciting task, framed with math jargon and lacking links to real-world discovery. Students' mindsets around""data"",""model""and""simulations""critically revealed no awareness of numerical modelling as a way for understanding the world. Our findings provide evidence of a crippled computational thinking mindset in students, who acquire mathematical skills that are not channelled toward real-world discovery through coding. This unlinked knowledge ends up being perceived as distressing number-crunching expertise with no relevant outcome. The virtuous mindset of researchers reported here indicates that computational thinking can be restored by training students specifically in coding, modelling and simulations in relation to discovering nature.

The samples were tested by specific real-time RT-PCRs targeting SARS-CoV-2, influenza viruses, and RSVs. Results: Of these NPSs, 31% tested positive for influenza viruses, 10% for SARS-CoV-2, and 7% for RSV. No coinfections were detected. Influenza viruses and RSVs circulated throughout the surveillance period until the end of February (week 9-2020), when they suddenly ceased to circulate seven weeks earlier than during the previous five influenza seasons.

It has been used as a recreational and performance drug in Southeast Asia, and is now increasingly used in Europe and the U.S. Case report: We describe the case of a 63-year-old man who presented for treatment after his long-term Kratom use failed as a self-management for persistent major depression (ICD 10: F33.2) and a generalized anxiety disorder (ICD-10: F41.1). The failure coincided with emerging stress at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. The patient suffered from childhood on from ruminative thinking and depressive mood, which was treated in several settings during his life. He started to use alcohol to control his depression, but developed an alcohol addiction. This was successfully treated and the patient remained abstinent for more than 25 years afterwards. About 7 years ago, he started to use Kratom 3–4 times daily on a regular, but constant rate. Kratom use worked efficiently as a self-management of his depression with no escalation of dosing. It was also very effective in reducing Morbus Menière symptoms of tinnitus and sudden hearing loss, which eventually allowed regular performance as a caregiver in a demanding job on shift-work. During recently increased stress load in the work environment and the COVID-19 pandemic, the established Kratom doses failed to control hyperarousal and mental nervousness. The patient was treatment seeking and subsequently detoxified from Kratom. Anxiety- and depression management was shifted to treatment attempts with Lorazepam, Venlafaxine, Opipramol, Mirtazapine and psychotherapy. Conclusion: Kratom instrumentalization for self-management of depression and anxiety may effectively work without causing escalation of drug use and addiction, but may be limited by a temporary increase in psychological stress load and a relapse into major depression and generalized anxiety disorder. © 2021 The Author(s)","Müller, E.; Hillemacher, T.; Müller, C.

Involuntary care disruption is defined as delayed or cancelled care that was not initiated by the patient. Results indicate that older age, being in fair or poor health, greater education, and having health insurance coverage were associated with greater likelihood of experiencing an involuntary delay in accessing medical care.

494869,494869,494869,COVID-19 Vaccines: A Primer for Clinicians,16.126585,5.3319645,2020,"BACKGROUND: Identified in December 2019 in the city of Wuhan, China, the outbreak of COVID-19 spread throughout the world and its impacts affect different populations differently, where countries with high levels of social and economic inequality such as Brazil gain prominence, for understanding of the vulnerability factors associated with the disease. Given this scenario, in the absence of a vaccine or safe and effective antiviral treatment for COVID-19, nonpharmacological measures are essential for prevention and control of the disease. However, many of these measures are not feasible for millions of individuals who live in territories with increased social vulnerability. The study aims to analyze the spatial distribution of COVID-19 incidence in Brazil's municipalities (counties) and investigate its association with sociodemographic determinants to better understand the social context and the epidemic's spread in the country. METHODS: This is an analytical ecological study using data from various sources. The study period was February 25 to September 26, 2020. Data analysis used global regression models: ordinary least squares (OLS), spatial autoregressive model (SAR), and conditional autoregressive model (CAR) and the local regression model called multiscale geographically weighted regression (MGWR). FINDINGS: The higher the GINI index, the higher the incidence of the disease at the municipal level. Likewise, the higher the nurse ratio per 1,000 inhabitants in the municipalities, the higher the COVID-19 incidence. Meanwhile, the proportional mortality ratio was inversely associated with incidence of the disease. DISCUSSION: Social inequality increased the risk of COVID-19 in the municipalities. Better social development of the municipalities was associated with lower risk of the disease. Greater access to health services improved the diagnosis and notification of the disease and was associated with more cases in the municipalities. Despite universal susceptibility to COVID-19, populations with increased social vulnerability were more exposed to risk of the illness.","Raymundo, Carlos Eduardo; Oliveira, Marcella Cini; Eleuterio, Tatiana de Araujo; André, Suzana Rosa; da Silva, Marcele Gonçalves; Queiroz, Eny Regina da Silva; Medronho, Roberto de Andrade",PLoS One,551,16

This is primarily due to the increased security and reliability level that comes with its non-intrusive nature. Non-intrusiveness became inevitable due to the pandemic of COVID-19. This paper introduces a unique and lightweight image enhancement method for person identification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). As pre-processing steps, Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) followed by gamma correction is applied. Afterward, the image is sharpened and then passed through the median filter. These steps are followed by applying power law and contrast adjustment. As a final step, CLAHE is used yet again to bring out the enhanced vascular structure. The method was appraised using the four different openly accessible databases. These are regarded as the most challenging available finger vein database-s by many researchers. For recognition purposes, CNN was used with transfer learning. Transfer learning is implemented by modifying the 13 convolutional layers of VGG-16. The proposed model architecture also includes five max-pooling layers, one ReLU, and one Softmax layer. It is observed that with transfer learning, the accuracy could have reached up to 99% on finger-vein recognition on the experimented dataset, thus proved to be a highly accurate approach for finger vein recognition.","Bilal, A.; Sun, G.

The first cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection were recorded in Ghana on March 12, 2020. Since then, the country has been combatting countrywide community spread. This report describes how the Virology Department, Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research (NMIMR) is supporting the Ghana Health Service (GHS) to diagnose infections with this virus in Ghana. Methods: The National Influenza Centre (NIC) in the Virology Department of the NMIMR, adopted real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (rRT-PCR) assays for the diagnosis of the SARS-CoV-2 in January 2020. Samples from suspected cases and contact tracing across Ghana were received and processed for SARS-CoV-2. Samples were 'pooled' to enable simultaneous batch testing of samples without reduced sensitivity. Outcomes: From February 3 to August 21, the NMIMR processed 283 946 (10%) samples. Highest number of cases were reported in June when the GHS embarked on targeted contact tracing which led to an increase in number of samples processed daily, peaking at over 7,000 samples daily. There were several issues to overcome including rapid consumption of reagents and consumables. Testing however continued successfully due to revised procedures, additional equipment and improved pipeline of laboratory supplies. Test results are now provided within 24 to 48 hours of sample submission enabling more effective response and containment. Conclusion: Following the identification of the first cases of SARS-CoV-2infection by the NMIMR, the Institute has trained other centres and supported the ramping up of molecular testing capacity in Ghana. This provides a blueprint to enable Ghana to mitigate further epidemics and pandemics. Funding: The laboratory work was supported with materials from the Ghana Health Service Ministry of Health, the US Naval Medical Research Unit #3, the World Health Organization, the Jack Ma Foundation and the University of Ghana Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research. Other research projects hosted by the Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research contributed reagents and laboratory consumables.

The causative agent of the disease was soon brought to focus by scientists as SARS-CoV-2 and later called a novel coronavirus by the general public. Due to the severity and rapid spread of the disease, WHO classifies the COVID-19 pandemic as the 6th public health emergency even after taking efforts like worldwide quarantine and restrictions. Since only symptomatic treatment is available, the best way to control the spread of the virus is by taking preventive measures. Various types of antigen/antibody detection kits and diagnostic methods are available for the diagnosis of COVID-19 patients. In recent years, various phytochemicals and repurposing drugs are showing a broad range of anti-viral activities with different modes of action have been identified. Repurposing drugs such as arbidol, hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, lopinavir, favipiravir, remdesivir, hexamethylene amiloride, and dexamethasone, tocilizumab, interferon-ß, neutralizing antibodies exhibit in vitro anti-coronaviral properties by inhibiting multiple processes in the virus life cycle. Various research groups are involved in drug trials and vaccine development. Plant-based anti-viral compounds such as baicalin, calanolides, curcumin, oxymatrine, matrine, and resveratrol exhibit different modes of action against a wide range of positive/negative sense-RNA/DNA virus, and future researches need to be conducted to ascertain their role, use in managing SARS-CoV-2. Thus, this article is an attempt to review the current understanding of COVID-19 acute respiratory disease and summarize its clinical features with their prospective control and various aspects of the therapeutic approach.","Rai, Pankaj Kumar; Mueed, Zeba; Chowdhury, Abhiroop; Deval, Ravi; Kumar, Dinesh; Kamal, Mohammad A; Negi, Yogeshwar Singh; Pareek, Shubhra; Poddar, Nitesh Kumar",Curr pharm. biotechnol,551,28

METHODS: The study included 142 COVID-19 patients hospitalized in Huoshenshan Hospital from February to March 2020. Nursing measures in the treatment (n = 111) and control (n = 31) groups included integrated management care and usual care. The integrated management model had eight components: WeChat group management, early Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) treatment, emotional nursing, music therapy, observation of tongue coating and pulse, vital Qi strengthening, preventing recurrence after recovery, and an individualized follow-up scheme. The endpoints included clinical outcome, recovery time of clinical symptoms and signs, days of hospital stay, and survival without intensive care unit (ICU) admission. RESULTS: Recovery time from clinical symptoms such as fever, cough, shortness of breath, muscle aches, and fatigue in the treatment group was shorter than that in the control group. Less time was required to show negative chest computed tomography findings in the treatment group than in the control group (13.0 ± 2.8 vs. 16.7 ± 3.9, p < .025). The lengths of hospital stay in the two groups were 16.4 ± 7.3 days (treatment group) and 24.4 ± 4.8 days (control group) (p < .001). Kaplan-Meier curves for survival without ICU transfer showed statistical difference between the two groups (&#967;2 = 5.427, p = .020). CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that the integrated management mode can relieve the symptoms of patients faster, shorten hospital stay and disease course, and reduce the rate of ICU transfers.","Chu, Lanfang; Zhang, Yongwen",Jpn J Nurs Sci,551,16

One of the controversies in this regard is the gold standard diagnostic method. Evidence suggests that polymerase chain reaction (RT–PCR) for Coronavirus nucleic acid has a low sensitivity and computed tomography (CT) has been suggested for more accurate diagnosis. Yet, CT has the disadvantage of radiation and is not safe in all patients. Here, we present a case series of 23 patients who underwent both RT–PCR and CT and report the outcome.

However, a number of studies have reported that adolescents are significantly less susceptible than older adults. Summer 2020 provided an opportunity to examine data on prevalence since after months of lockdowns, with the easing of restrictions, people were mingling, leading to surges in cases. METHODS: We examined data from Departments of Health websites in six U.S. states experiencing surges in cases to determine prevalence of COVID-19, and two prevalence-related measures, in adolescents and youth as compared to older adults. The two other measures related to prevalence were: (Percentage of cases observed in a given age group) ÷ (percentage of cases expected based on population demographics); and percentage deviation, or [(% observed-% expected)/ % expected] x 100. RESULTS: Prevalence of COVID-19 for adolescents and for youth was significantly greater than for older adults (p < .00001), as was percentage observed ÷ percentage expected (p < .005). The percentage deviation was significantly greater in adolescents/youth than in older adults (p < 0.00001) when there was an excess of observed cases over what was expected, and significantly less when observed cases were fewer than expected (p< 0.00001). CONCLUSIONS: Our results are contrary to previous findings that adolescents are less susceptible than older adults. Possible reasons for the findings are suggested, and we note that public health messaging targeting adolescents and youth might be helpful in curbing the pandemic. Also, the findings of the potential for high transmission among adolescents and youth, should be factored into decisions regarding school reopening.","Rumain, Barbara; Schneiderman, Moshe; Geliebter, Allan",PLoS One,551,2

This study sought to characterize the risk factors for and outcomes following COVID-19 infection in this population. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Maintenance dialysis patients in clinics with at least one patient with a positive test for SARS-CoV-2 from February to June 2020, treated by a mid-size national dialysis provider. PREDICTORS: Demographics, dialysis characteristics, residence in a congregate setting, comorbid conditions, measures of frailty, and use of selected medications. OUTCOMES: COVID-19 defined as having a positive SARS-CoV-2 test and all-cause mortality among those with COVID-19. ANALYTICAL APPROACH: Logistic regression analyses to identify clinical characteristics associated with COVID-19and risk factors associated with mortality among patients following COVID-19. RESULTS: 438/7948 (5.5%) maintenance dialysis patients developed COVID-19. Male sex, Black race, in-center dialysis (vs. home dialysis), treatment at an urban clinic, residence in a congregate setting, and greater comorbidity were associated with contracting COVID-19. Odds of COVID-19 was 17-fold higher for those residing in a congregate setting [OR = 17.10 (95% CI 13.51, 21.54)]. Of the 438 maintenance dialysis patients with COVID-19, 109 (24.9%) died. Older age, heart disease, and markers of frailty were associated with mortality. LIMITATIONS: No distinction between symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 positivity, with asymptomatic screening limited by testing capacity during this initial COVID-19 surge period. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 is common among patients receiving maintenance dialysis, particularly those residing in congregate settings. Among maintenance dialysis patients with COVID-19, mortality is high, exceeding 20%.","Hsu, Caroline M; Weiner, Daniel E; Aweh, Gideon; Miskulin, Dana C; Manley, Harold J; Stewart, Carol; Ladik, Vlad; Hosford, John; Lacson, Edward C; Johnson, Douglas S; Lacson, Eduardo",Am. j. kidney dis,551,16

Given that inflammatory immune cells may induce severe lung injury, the involvement of immunological factors in the pathogenesis of the disease cannot be overestimated. It has been demonstrated that coronaviruses have developed mechanisms of immune evasion, making themselves invisible to the immune system at an early stage of infection. The mechanism relies on inhibiting the antiviral response of type I interferons, which enhances uncontrolled viral replication in epithelial cells. There has been a growing body of evidence showing that fatal hyperinflammation (cytokine storm) responsible for the severe course of COVID­19 is a consequence of massive SARS­CoV­2 replication rather than inappropriate hyperresponsiveness of the immune system. Therefore, the suppressed antiviral innate immune response seems to be the primary cause of the delayed critical cascade of uncontrolled immune events leading to fulminant systemic inflammation. The occurrence of virus transmission even in asymptomatic individuals infected with SARS­CoV­2 clearly strengthens the evidence for the key role played by the sufficient immune control of viral replication in a subset of cases (eg, in children, a population with a highly effective innate immune response). Although administration of immunomodulatory drugs is recommended under certain conditions by the guidelines for COVID­19 management, controversies regarding treatment protocols in immunocompromised patients infected with SARS­CoV­2 still exist. Extending clinicians' knowledge on the dysregulated immune response, which is a driver of the COVID­19 outcome, may improve both therapeutic strategies and the prognosis of patients infected with SARS­CoV­2.","Kosmaczewska, Agata; Frydecka, Irena",Pol Arch Intern Med,551,20

Nowadays, a lot of people are suffering from COVID-19 and every country has its own limited testing capacity. Consequently, a system is required to help doctors analyze a patient’s blood structure including COVID-19. Therefore, in this paper, we extracted and selected blood features by proposing a new feature extraction and selection method named stepwise linear discriminant analysis (SWLDA). SWLDA emphasizes on picking confined features from blood structure images and discerning its class based on reversion value such as partial F value. SWLDA begins with picking an equivalence comprising the sole finest X variable and then puts in effort to add more Xs individually, providing the situations are adequate. The process of adding and picking is based on F value to determine which variable would be entered. Then, the picked or the default F-to-enter value is compared with the uppermost partial F value. After this step, the forward addition or backward removal begins and whether the partial test values for all the predictor variables already in the line are estimated is known. Then, the comparison is made between the lowermost partial test value (FL) and preselected or defaulting consequence levels such as F0 (i.e., if F0 &gt; FL, the variable ZL is removed, and the F test is started again;otherwise, the regression equation is adopted). Finally, the system is trained by employing support vector machine (SVM) to label the blood images.

The present study investigated psychosocial impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on a help-seeking sample of Canadian men, focusing on diverse aspects of their psychosocial well-being. Methods: A cross-sectional, open survey study design was used. Canadian adult men who were visiting an eHealth depression resource (HeadsUpGuys.org) were recruited to complete an online survey. Descriptive statistics, including means and standard deviations for continuous variables and frequency and percentages for categorical variables, were used to summarize survey responses. Regression analysis was utilized to identify factors associated with various mental health indicators (anxiety, depression, fear of COVID-19, suicidality). The Patient Health Questionnaire-4, Fear of COVID-19 Scale, and item 9 (suicidality item) from the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 were used to assess the mental health indicators. Results: A total of 434 men completed the study. Most respondents (79.3%; N = 344) indicated that their mental health was negatively affected by COVID-19, and two-thirds (65.5%; N = 284) conveyed that government-imposed physical distancing measures had negatively affected their mental health. Half the sample (51.2%; N = 222) reported at least moderate financial stress due to COVID-19. Nearly a third of respondents (31.1%; N = 135) reported that their current living situation has had a considerable or severe negative impact on their mental health since COVID-19. About two-fifths (37.7%; N = 94) of men felt that COVID-19 has had a negative impact on their relationship with their intimate partner. Nearly a third of respondents who were in a relationship (30.9%; N = 77) reported that they engaged in some type of abuse (primarily verbal abuse, 22.9%; N = 57) toward their intimate partner during COVID-19, and more than a quarter (27.3%; N = 68) reported being abused by their intimate partner (also primarily verbal abuse, 22.5%; N = 56). Just under half (42.2%; N = 183) of the respondents indicated experiencing suicidal ideation. Conclusion: These findings can help inform providers of health services to Canadian men, as well as policies that will be implemented during subsequent waves of COVID-19 or during future infectious outbreaks.","Ogrodniczuk, John S; Rice, Simon M; Kealy, David; Seidler, Zac E; Delara, Mahin; Oliffe, John L",Postgrad Med,551,24

SARS -CoV-2 has a faster rate of transmission than other coronaviruses such as SARS and MERS and until now there are no approved specific drugs or vaccines for treatment. Thus, early diagnosis is crucial to prevent the extensive spread of the disease. The reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the most routinely used method until now to detect SARS-CoV-2 infections. However, several other faster and accurate assays are being developed for the diagnosis of COVID-19 aiming to control the spread of infection through the identification of patients and immediate isolation.

It is hypothesized that the lipid bilayer that surrounds the SARS-CoV-2 virus improves its ability to remain stable on sebum-rich skin and serves as another possible route of contracting the virus. One possible aspect of these observations that has yet to be explored in detail is what role arthropods that have been associated with human skin infestation, such as Demodecidae or Pyemotidae species, play in viral transmission. It seems likely that arthropod-coronavirus interactions may take place through the molecular attraction forces between the chitin found on the exoskeleton of mites commonly found on human skin and the lipids present on the viral envelope of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. We believe this may mean that arthropods are a currently an overlooked cofactor in viral infection which may have some important biomedical implications for both prevention and treatment.

Many research studies on chest diseases rely on the strengths of deep learning techniques. Although some of these studies used state-of-the-art techniques and were able to deliver promising results, these techniques are not very useful if they can detect only one type of disease without detecting the others. OBJECTIVE: The main objective of this study was to achieve a fast and more accurate diagnosis of COVID-19. This study proposes a diagnostic technique that classifies COVID-19 x-ray images from normal x-ray images and those specific to 14 other chest diseases. METHODS: In this paper, we propose a novel, multilevel pipeline, based on deep learning models, to detect COVID-19 along with other chest diseases based on x-ray images. This pipeline reduces the burden of a single network to classify a large number of classes. The deep learning models used in this study were pretrained on the ImageNet dataset, and transfer learning was used for fast training. The lungs and heart were segmented from the whole x-ray images and passed onto the first classifier that checks whether the x-ray is normal, COVID-19 affected, or characteristic of another chest disease. If it is neither a COVID-19 x-ray image nor a normal one, then the second classifier comes into action and classifies the image as one of the other 14 diseases. RESULTS: We show how our model uses state-of-the-art deep neural networks to achieve classification accuracy for COVID-19 along with 14 other chest diseases and normal cases based on x-ray images, which is competitive with currently used state-of-the-art models. Due to the lack of data in some classes such as COVID-19, we applied 10-fold cross-validation through the ResNet50 model. Our classification technique thus achieved an average training accuracy of 96.04% and test accuracy of 92.52% for the first level of classification (ie, 3 classes). For the second level of classification (ie, 14 classes), our technique achieved a maximum training accuracy of 88.52% and test accuracy of 66.634% by using ResNet50. We also found that when all the 16 classes were classified at once, the overall accuracy for COVID-19 detection decreased, which in the case of ResNet50 was 88.92% for training data and 71.905% for test data. CONCLUSIONS: Our proposed pipeline can detect COVID-19 with a higher accuracy along with detecting 14 other chest diseases based on x-ray images. This is achieved by dividing the classification task into multiple steps rather than classifying them collectively.","Albahli, Saleh; Yar, Ghulam Nabi Ahmad Hassan",J Med Internet Res,551,12

Delivery services have grown as an alternative source of revenue for many people. Consumers generally perceive that delivery services are safer than going into a restaurant, because they reduce exposure to other people and their risk of SARS-CoV-2 contagion. There are no studies analyzing viral load or the burden of COID-19 within this population. This study aims to describe the presence of SARS-CoV-2 among food delivery riders in the city of Quito, Ecuador. STUDY DESIGN: From July and August 2020, bike and motorbike riders self-employed in two of the main online delivery services in Quito, Ecuador, were invited for RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 detection during the compulsory lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Center for Disease Control (CDC) 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) RT-qPCR Diagnostic Panel was used to identify the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal swabs. All samples were processed in the BSL2 certified molecular biology laboratory at Universidad de Las Americas. RESULTS: A total of 22 out of 145 delivery workers (15.2%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. The majority of workers were men (n = 138), the average age of male workers was 32 years-old (±7.3) and 38 years-old (± 10.6) for females. The presence of mild symptoms was reported in only 9 subjects (6%). The calculated viral load was higher among males with 1.31E+08 copies/mL vs 2.30E+06 in females, although this difference was not statistically significant (p value: 0.68, [CI: -53 to -79]). CONCLUSIONS: The self-employed food delivery riders have a high incidence rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection in relation to the national average. It is important to point out that this is the first study of its kind in Latin-American and probably one of the very few in the world. The results emphasize the need for policy makers to look at the pandemic from as many population's sub-groups as possible. Delivery riders are a highly moving population that offer their services to a wide range of clients, including vulnerable populations such as the elderly or those less likely to leave their house for basic needs stoking.","Ortiz-Prado, Esteban; Henriquez-Trujillo, Aquiles R; Rivera-Olivero, Ismar A; Lozada, Tannya; Garcia-Bereguiain, Miguel Angel",Sci Total Environ,551,16

STUDY DESIGN/SETTING Cross-sectional email survey, international. PATIENT SAMPLE Spine Surgeons. OUTCOME MEASURES Perspectives and practices of spine telemedicine. METHODS An anonymous, cross-sectional email survey was sent to the members of AO Spine. Survey questions covered provider experiences with and perceptions of telemedicine. Descriptive statistics were used to depict responses and responses were compared amongst regions. RESULTS A total of 485 spine providers responded to the survey. As of May 2020, telemedicine usage comprised &gt;39.0% of all visits — up from &lt;10.0% of visits pre-pandemic. A majority of providers (60.5%) performed at least 1 telemedicine visit. The format of “telemedicine” varied widely by region: African (45.2%) and European (50.0%) providers were more likely to use phone calls (no video), whereas North (66.7%) and South American (77.0%) surgeons more commonly used audio-visual telemedicine (p&lt;0.001). North American providers used telemedicine the most during COVID-19 (&gt;60.0% of all visits). There were 81.9% of all providers who “agreed/strongly agreed” telemedicine was easy to use. Respondents tended to “agree” that imaging review, the initial appointment, and postoperative care could be performed using telemedicine. Almost all (95.4%) surgeons preferred at least one in-person visit prior to the day of surgery. CONCLUSIONS Our study noted significant geographical differences in the rate of telemedicine usage and the platform of telemedicine utilized.

In addition to providing essential medical services during the pandemic, telemedicine has the potential to expand health care access to underserved populations by eliminating traditional barriers to care such as transportation needs, distance from specialty providers, and approved time off from work. However, the literature regarding telehealth accessibility for low-income, non-English-speaking, and minority patients remains limited. Through a cross-sectional analysis comparing 2019 clinic visits with 2020 telehealth visits at the UMass Memorial Medical Center, we demonstrate specialty-specific changes in patient demographics, including a younger population, fewer non-English-speaking patients, and a relative preservation of minority, Medicaid, and Medicare patients among telehealth visits in comparison to clinic visits. We also demonstrate that nonsurgical specialties had significantly lower no-show rates and the greatest number of telehealth visits. Overall, our findings highlight the potential shortcomings of telemedicine in servicing non-English-speaking patients, while maintaining that it is an important tool with the potential to improve access to health care, particularly in nonprocedural specialties.","Franciosi, Ellen B; Tan, Alice J; Kassamali, Bina; Leonard, Nicholas; Zhou, Guohai; Krueger, Steven; Rashighi, Mehdi; LaChance, Avery",Telemed. j. e. health,551,6

We use simple epidemiological models to explore estimates for the magnitude and timing of future COVID-19 cases, given different assumptions regarding the protective efficacy and duration of the adaptive immune response to SARS-CoV-2, as well as its interaction with vaccines and nonpharmaceutical interventions. We find that variations in the immune response to primary SARS-CoV-2 infections and a potential vaccine can lead to markedly different immune landscapes and burdens of critically severe cases, ranging from sustained epidemics to near elimination. Our findings illustrate likely complexities in future COVID-19 dynamics and highlight the importance of immunological characterization beyond the measurement of active infections for adequately projecting the immune landscape generated by SARS-CoV-2 infections.","Saad-Roy, Chadi M; Wagner, Caroline E; Baker, Rachel E; Morris, Sinead E; Farrar, Jeremy; Graham, Andrea L; Levin, Simon A; Mina, Michael J; Metcalf, C Jessica E; Grenfell, Bryan T",Science,551,16

Some countries have considered the use of immunity certification as a strategy to relax these measures for people who have recovered from the infection by issuing these individuals a document, commonly called an immunity passport. This document certifies them as having protective immunity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes COVID-19. The World Health Organization has advised against the implementation of immunity certification at present because of uncertainty about whether long-term immunity truly exists for those who have recovered from COVID-19 and concerns over the reliability of the proposed serological test method for determining immunity. Immunity certification can only be considered if scientific thresholds for assuring immunity are met, whether based on antibodies or other criteria. However, even if immunity certification became well supported by science, it has many ethical issues in terms of different restrictions on individual liberties and its implementation process. We examine the main considerations for the ethical acceptability of immunity certification to exempt individuals from restrictive measures during the COVID-19 pandemic. As well as needing to meet robust scientific criteria, the ethical acceptability of immunity certification depends on its uses and policy objectives and the measures in place to reduce potential harms, and prevent disproportionate burdens on non-certified individuals and violation of individual liberties and rights.","Voo, Teck Chuan; Reis, Andreas A; Thomé, Beatriz; Ho, Calvin Wl; Tam, Clarence C; Kelly-Cirino, Cassandra; Emanuel, Ezekiel; Beca, Juan P; Littler, Katherine; Smith, Maxwell J; Parker, Michael; Kass, Nancy; Gobat, Nina; Lei, Ruipeng; Upshur, Ross; Hurst, Samia; Munsaka, Sody",Bull World Health Organ,551,26

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic infection with high mortality in older patients due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The high number of vaccinations may be one of the reasons why children show a lower susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and milder severity when compared to adults. We have designed a study aimed at investigating whether the influenza vaccine may reduce the susceptibility and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We retrospectively enrolled 635 patients who accessed our Emergency Department from March 1st to June 30th, 2020, and were diagnosed with COVID-19 infection confirmed by an RT-PCR on an oropharyngeal swab. Clinical data, outcomes, and influenza vaccination status were collected from the electronic medical records of our Hospital. We also used data from the Italian Health Ministry to compare the prevalence of flu vaccination among the general population of the Lazio Region and our enrolled patients. We then compared clinical outcomes between vaccinated and non-vaccinated patients, by univariate and multivariate analysis. COVID-19-positive patients older than 65 years reported a lower prevalence of flu vaccination when compared to the general population residing in the Lazio (p = 0.004). After correction for gender, age, and comorbidities, we found a lower risk of death at 60 days in patients with flu vaccination than in not vaccinated patients (p = 0.001). Our study shows that flu vaccination could reduce the mortality of COVID-19. Prospective studies are needed to confirm this result.","Candelli, Marcello; Pignataro, Giulia; Torelli, Enrico; Gullì, Antonio; Nista, Enrico Celestino; Petrucci, Martina; Saviano, Angela; Marchesini, Debora; Covino, Marcello; Ojetti, Veronica; Antonelli, Massimo; Gasbarrini, Antonio; Franceschi, Francesco",Intern. emerg. med,551,20

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) plays a fundamental role in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis because it allows viral entry into host cells. Here we show that ACE2 nanodecoys derived from human lung spheroid cells (LSCs) can bind and neutralize SARS-CoV-2 and protect the host lung cells from infection. In mice, these LSC-nanodecoys were delivered via inhalation therapy and resided in the lungs for over 72 h post-delivery. Furthermore, inhalation of the LSC-nanodecoys accelerated clearance of SARS-CoV-2 mimics from the lungs, with no observed toxicity. In cynomolgus macaques challenged with live SARS-CoV-2, four doses of these nanodecoys delivered by inhalation promoted viral clearance and reduced lung injury. Our results suggest that LSC-nanodecoys can serve as a potential therapeutic agent for treating COVID-19.","Li, Zhenhua; Wang, Zhenzhen; Dinh, Phuong-Uyen C; Zhu, Dashuai; Popowski, Kristen D; Lutz, Halle; Hu, Shiqi; Lewis, Mark G; Cook, Anthony; Andersen, Hanne; Greenhouse, Jack; Pessaint, Laurent; Lobo, Leonard J; Cheng, Ke",Nat Nanotechnol,551,24

This report describes 3 cases of patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia who received intermittent adjunctive treatment with HFPV at a single center without requiring admission to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). CASE REPORT Case 1 was a 60-year-old woman admitted to the hospital 14 days after the onset of SARS-CoV-2 infection symptoms, and cases 2 and 3 were men aged 65 and 72 years who were admitted to the hospital 10 days after the onset of SARS-CoV-2 infection symptoms. All 3 patients presented with clinical deterioration accompanied by worsening lung lesions on computed tomography (CT) scans after 21 days from the onset of symptoms. SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed in all patients by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay from nasal swabs. All 3 patients had impending respiratory failure when non-invasive intermittent HFPV therapy was initiated. After therapy, the patients had significant clinical improvement and visibly decreased lung lesions on followup CT scans performed 4-6 days later. CONCLUSIONS The 3 cases described in this report showed that the use of intermittent adjunctive treatment with HFPV in patients with severe pneumonia due to infection with SARS-CoV-2 improved lung function and may have prevented clinical deterioration. However, recommendations on the use of intermittent HFPV as an adjunctive treatment in COVID-19 pneumonia requires large-scale controlled clinical studies. In the pandemic context, with a shortage of ICU beds, avoiding ICU admission by using adjunctive therapies on the ward is a useful option.","Marchenko, Sergey P; Scarlatescu, Ecaterina; Vogt, Paul Robert; Naumov, Alexey; Bognenko, Sergey",Am J Case Rep,551,16

The current global challenge of the pandemic caused by the novel severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 presents the greatest global public health crisis since the pandemic influenza outbreak of 1918. At the time this paper was written, the number of diagnosed COVID-19 cases around the world had reached more than 31 million. Since the pandemic started, there has been a rapid effort in different research communities to exploit a wide variety of technologies to combat this worldwide threat, and IoT technology is one of the pioneers in this area. In the context of COVID-19, IoT-enabled/linked devices/applications are utilized to lower the possible spread of COVID-19 to others by early diagnosis, monitoring patients, and practicing defined protocols after patient recovery. This paper surveys the role of IoT-based technologies in COVID-19 and reviews the state-of-the-art architectures, platforms, applications, and industrial IoT-based solutions combating COVID-19 in three main phases, including early diagnosis, quarantine time, and after recovery.","Nasajpour, Mohammad; Pouriyeh, Seyedamin; Parizi, Reza M; Dorodchi, Mohsen; Valero, Maria; Arabnia, Hamid R",J Healthc Inform Res,551,20

It manifests in some cases as increasing inflammation to even the onset of a cytokine storm and irreversible progression of acute respiratory syndrome, which is associated with the risk of death in patients. Thus, proactive anti-inflammatory therapy remains an open serious question in patients with COVID-19 and pneumonia, who still have signs of inflammation on days 7-9 of the disease: elevated C-reactive protein (CRP)&gt;60 mg/dL and at least two of the four clinical signs: fever &gt;37.5°C; persistent cough; dyspnea (RR &gt;20 brpm) and/or reduced oxygen blood saturation &lt;94% when breathing atmospheric air. We designed the randomized trial: COLchicine versus Ruxolitinib and Secukinumab in Open-label Prospective Randomized Trial in Patients with COVID-19 (COLORIT). We present here data comparing patients who received colchicine with those who did not receive specific anti-inflammatory therapy. Results of the comparison of colchicine, ruxolitinib, and secukinumab will be presented later.Objective Compare efficacy and safety of colchicine compared to the management of patients with COVID-19 without specific anti-inflammatory therapy.Material and Methods Initially, 20 people were expected to be randomized in the control group. However, enrollment to the control group was discontinued subsequently after the inclusion of 5 patients due to the risk of severe deterioration in the absence of anti-inflammatory treatment. Therefore, 17 patients, who had not received anti-inflammatory therapy when treated in the MSU Medical Research and Educational Center before the study, were also included in the control group. The effects were assessed on day 12 after the inclusion or at discharge if it occurred earlier than on day 12. The primary endpoint was the changes in the SHOCS-COVID score, which includes the assessment of the patient's clinical condition, CT score of the lung tissue damage, the severity of systemic inflammation (CRP changes), and the risk of thrombotic complications (D-dimer) [1].Results The median SHOCS score decreased from 8 to 2 (p = 0.017), i.e., from moderate to mild degree, in the colchicine group. The change in the SHOCS-COVID score was minimal and statistically insignificant in the control group. In patients with COVID-19 treated with colchicine, the CRP levels decreased rapidly and normalized (from 99.4 to 4.2 mg/dL, p&lt;0.001). In the control group, the CRP levels decreased moderately and statistically insignificantly and achieved 22.8 mg/dL by the end of the follow-up period, which was still more than four times higher than normal. The most informative criterion for inflammation lymphocyte-to-C-reactive protein ratio (LCR) increased in the colchicine group by 393 versus 54 in the control group (p = 0.003). After treatment, it was 60.8 in the control group, which was less than 100 considered safe in terms of systemic inflammation progression. The difference from 427 in the colchicine group was highly significant (p = 0.003).The marked and rapid decrease in the inflammation factors was accompanied in the colchicine group by the reduced need for oxygen support from 14 (66.7%) to 2 (9.5%). In the control group, the number of patients without anti-inflammatory therapy requiring oxygen support remained unchanged at 50%. There was a trend to shorter hospital stays in the group of specific anti-inflammatory therapy up to 13 days compared to 17.5 days in the control group (p = 0.079). Moreover, two patients died in the control group, and there were no fatal cases in the colchicine group. In the colchicine group, one patient had deep vein thrombosis with D-dimer elevated to 5.99 µg/mL, which resolved before discharge.Conclusions Colchicine 1 mg for 1-3 days followed by 0.5 mg/day for 14 days is effective as a proactive anti-inflammatory therapy in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and viral pneumonia. The management of such patients without proactive anti-inflammatory therapy is likely to be unreasonable and may worsen the course of COVID-19. However, the findings should be treated with caution, given the small size of the trial.","Mareev, V Yu; Orlova, Ya A; Plisyk, A G; Pavlikova, E P; Akopyan, Z A; Matskeplishvili, S T; Malakhov, P S; Krasnova, T N; Seredenina, E M; Potapenko, A V; Agapov, M A; Asratyan, D A; Dyachuk, L I; Samokhodskaya, L M; Mershina, Ð Ð; Sinitsyn, V E; Pakhomov, P V; Zhdanova, E A; Mareev, Yu V; Begrambekova, Yu L; Kamalov, Ð Ð",Kardiologiia,551,10

The 2-month measurements of the number size distribution of neutral particles and charged ions showed that during the lockdown (LCD) period, the number concentration of particles smaller than 100 nm decreased by approximately 40 % compared to the pre-LCD period in January. However, the accumulation mode particles increased by approximately 20 % as several polluted episodes contributed to secondary aerosol formation. In this study, new particle formation (NPF) events were found to be enhanced in the nucleation and growth processes during the LCD period, as indicated by the higher formation rate of 2 nm particles (J2) and the subsequent growth rate (GR). The relevant precursors, e.g., SO2 and NO2, showed a clear reduction, and O3 increased by 80 % during LCD period, as compared with pre-LCD. The volatile organic vapors showed different trends due to their sources. The proxy sulfuric acid during the LCD period increased by approximately 26 %, as compared with pre-LCD. The major oxidants (O3, OH, and NO3) of VOCs were also found to be elevated during LCD. That indicated higherJ2 and GR (especially below 5 nm) during the LCD period were favored by the increased concentration level of condensing vapors and decreased condensation sink. Several heavy haze episodes have been reported by other studies during the LCD period;however, the increase in nanoparticle number concentration should also be considered. Some typical NPF events produced a high number concentration of nanoparticles that intensified in the following days to create severe aerosol pollution under unfavorable meteorological conditions. Our study confirms a significant enhancement of the nucleation and growth process of nanoparticles during the COVID-19 LCD in Beijing and highlights the necessity of controlling nanoparticles in current and future air quality management.","Shen, Xiaojing Sun Junying Yu Fangqun Wang Ying Zhong Junting Zhang Yangmei Hu Xinyao Xia Can Zhang Sinan Zhang Xiaoye",Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,551,21

Findings: In this case series of 12 patients, all were women, younger than 60 years, and had symptom onset ranging from 6 to 15 days after vaccination requiring hospitalization. Of 11 patients with heparin-platelet factor 4 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) antibody test results, all were positive. At last follow-up, outcomes were death (n = 3), intensive care unit (ICU) care (n = 3), non-ICU hospitalization (n = 2), and discharge to home (n = 4). Meaning: This case series may inform clinical guidance and investigations into the potential relationship between the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine and CVST with thrombocytopenia. Importance: Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) with thrombocytopenia, a rare and serious condition, has been described in Europe following receipt of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine (Oxford/AstraZeneca), which uses a chimpanzee adenoviral vector. A mechanism similar to autoimmune heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) has been proposed. In the US, the Ad26.COV2.S COVID-19 vaccine (Janssen/Johnson & Johnson), which uses a human adenoviral vector, received Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) on February 27, 2021. By April 12, 2021, approximately 7 million Ad26.COV2.S vaccine doses had been given in the US, and 6 cases of CVST with thrombocytopenia had been identified among the recipients, resulting in a temporary national pause in vaccination with this product on April 13, 2021. Objective: To describe reports of CVST with thrombocytopenia following Ad26.COV2.S vaccine receipt. Design, Setting, and Participants: Case series of 12 US patients with CVST and thrombocytopenia following use of Ad26.COV2.S vaccine under EUA reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) from March 2 to April 21, 2021 (with follow-up reported through April 21, 2021). Exposures: Receipt of Ad26.COV2.S vaccine. Main Outcomes and Measures: Clinical course, imaging, laboratory tests, and outcomes after CVST diagnosis obtained from VAERS reports, medical record review, and discussion with clinicians. Results: Patients' ages ranged from 18 to younger than 60 years;all were White women, reported from 11 states. Seven patients had at least 1 CVST risk factor, including obesity (n = 6), hypothyroidism (n = 1), and oral contraceptive use (n = 1);none had documented prior heparin exposure. Time from Ad26.COV2.S vaccination to symptom onset ranged from 6 to 15 days. Eleven patients initially presented with headache;1 patient initially presented with back pain and later developed headache. Of the 12 patients with CVST, 7 also had intracerebral hemorrhage;8 had non-CVST thromboses. After diagnosis of CVST, 6 patients initially received heparin treatment. Platelet nadir ranged from 9 ×103/µL to 127 ×103/µL. All 11 patients tested for the heparin-platelet factor 4 HIT antibody by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) screening had positive results. All patients were hospitalized (10 in an intensive care unit [ICU]). As of April 21, 2021, outcomes were death (n = 3), continued ICU care (n = 3), continued non-ICU hospitalization (n = 2), and discharged home (n = 4). Conclusions and Relevance: The initial 12 US cases of CVST with thrombocytopenia after Ad26.COV2.S vaccination represent serious events. This case series may inform clinical guidance as Ad26.COV2.S vaccination resumes in the US as well as investigations into the potential relationship between Ad26.COV2.S vaccine and CVST with thrombocytopenia. This study describes the reported US cases of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) with thrombocytopenia following vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S, the COVID-19 vaccine produced by Janssen/Johnson & Johnson.

Materials and Methods: Multiple international datasets, including from Chinese disease-infected areas were included. We present a system that utilizes robust 2D and 3D deep learning models, modifying and adapting existing AI models and combining them with clinical understanding. We conducted multiple retrospective experiments to analyze the performance of the system in the detection of suspected COVID-19 thoracic CT features and to evaluate evolution of the disease in each patient over time using a 3D volume review, generating a Corona score. The study includes a testing set of 157 international patients (China and U.S). Results: Classification results for Coronavirus vs Non-coronavirus cases per thoracic CT studies were 0.996 AUC (95%CI: 0.989-1.00) ; on datasets of Chinese control and infected patients. Possible working point: 98.2% sensitivity, 92.2% specificity. For time analysis of Coronavirus patients, the system output enables quantitative measurements for smaller opacities (volume, diameter) and visualization of the larger opacities in a slice-based heat map or a 3D volume display. Our suggested Corona score measures the progression of disease over time. Conclusion: This initial study, which is currently being expanded to a larger population, demonstrated that rapidly developed AI-based image analysis can achieve high accuracy in detection of Coronavirus as well as quantification and tracking of disease burden.","Gozes, Ophir; Frid-Adar, Maayan; Greenspan, Hayit; Browning, Patrick D.; Zhang, Huangqi; Ji, Wenbin; Bernheim, Adam; Siegel, Eliot",,551,24

In this work, a multiplexed grating-coupled fluorescent plasmonics (GC-FP) biosensor platform was used to rapidly and accurately measure antibodies against COVID-19 in human blood serum and dried blood spot samples. The GC-FP platform measures antibody-antigen binding interactions for multiple targets in a single sample, and has 100% selectivity and sensitivity (n = 23) when measuring serum IgG levels against three COVID-19 antigens (spike S1, spike S1S2, and the nucleocapsid protein). The GC-FP platform yielded a quantitative, linear response for serum samples diluted to as low as 1:1600 dilution. Test results were highly correlated with two commercial COVID-19 antibody tests, including an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and a Luminex-based microsphere immunoassay. To demonstrate test efficacy with other sample matrices, dried blood spot samples (n = 63) were obtained and evaluated with GC-FP, yielding 100% selectivity and 86.7% sensitivity for diagnosing prior COVID-19 infection. The test was also evaluated for detection of multiple immunoglobulin isotypes, with successful detection of IgM, IgG and IgA antibody-antigen interactions. Last, a machine learning approach was developed to accurately score patient samples for prior COVID-19 infection, using antibody binding data for all three COVID-19 antigens used in the test.","Cady, Nathaniel C; Tokranova, Natalya; Minor, Armond; Nikvand, Nima; Strle, Klemen; Lee, William T; Page, William; Guignon, Ernest; Pilar, Arturo; Gibson, George N",Biosens Bioelectron,551,6

A conversion efficiency into radicals of 0.4 is routinely achieved throughout the pH range investigated (pH 2-pH 9), and the radical generation is completed within a few ns. No precursor other than the parent compound is needed, and the ionization by-products do not interfere with the further fate of the radicals. With this generation method, we have characterized the quercetin radicals and studied the kinetics of their repairs by co-antioxidants such as ascorbate and 4-aminophenol. Bell-shaped pH dependences of the observed rate constants reflect opposite trends in the availability of the reacting protonation forms of radical and co-antioxidant and even at their maxima mask the much higher true rate constants.

However, with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, circumstances have become anything but normal and predictable, thus putting employees' sense of occupational calling to the test. In this study, we investigate the possibility that occupational calling fluctuates across days during situations of crisis, and we identify antecedents and consequence of such fluctuations. To test our model, we conducted a daily diary study of 66 nurses working in intensive care units over 5 consecutive work days in a specialized Wuhan hospital that only admitted confirmed COVID-19 patients during the peak of the pandemic in China. We found that the daily number of code blue events (i.e., cardiopulmonary resuscitation efforts with the primary goal of patient revival) was positively related to daily occupational calling for nurses. Moreover, individual differences in prosocial motivation predicted the average level and variability of occupational calling over the 5 days, which subsequently related to the nurses' job performance. Our study sheds light on how occupational calling enables people with the needed occupational knowledge and skills to function effectively in crisis situations.

Faced up with the unprecedented nature of this situation, the liberal psychotherapist is led to rethink some aspects of the framework of his practice in order to preserve the thread of the transferential relationship. The authors develop a clinical reflection on the clinical setting in a pandemic period by exploring in particular the dynamics of telephone sessions. For telephone interviews, the question of the sound envelope is central, in particular regarding the psychic function of silence. We choose to illustrate our point with short vignettes than by relying on long-term clinical cases, more likely to represent the variety of new clinical situations encountered and the questions that accompany them. This article introduces his point by recounting the plague epidemic in ancient Greece to show the impact of the environment on humans and its collective fantasy implications. Being faced up with death, contamination, the invisible enemy brings out a palpable concern. It is indeed quite remarkable that these same reactions and concerns in front of death caused by the pandemic match whith what is related by Thucydides who survived the plague, which affected Athens during the Peloponnesian War. In another context, Winnicott highlights the place and importance of the therapeutic environment. It is both a question of adjusting the framework according to the context while maintaining certain intangible aspects representing the permanence of the link and its framework. A framework cannot exist without being kept, which is equivalent to thinking of the framework above all as an internal framework, questioning the clinician about what he values and what he makes sense in his practice. In the current context, these questions arise from the perspective of a certain flexibility, depending on the human context (child, adolescent, consultations, etc.) or external context (crisis linked to a virus, etc.) showing that it is more than never question of exercising on a case-by-case basis, taking into account changes in the environment. The initial observation during this period of confinement concerns the fact that some patients contact a therapist for the first time by telephone and wish to initiate psychotherapy (during this period) when they explain that such an initiative was not possible. despite the difficulties already encountered in the past. But there is also the opposite case: patients who have no intention of continuing the work already started during this time. Thus, faced up with the injunction of confinement, they show themselves in the psychic impossibility of following the treatment by other means such as, for example, telephone sessions. In this perspective, the silence on the phone takes on a different tone; silence reveals itself to be a source of greater anxiety than in presence: the presence of bodies, of its movements perceptible as imperceptible, of a gesture that carries or accompanies the senses, breathing, the visual context of the office and of its ""decor"", represent as many essential elements in the usual capacity of the frame; in the absence of these basic sensory elements, silence can be experienced as a void, or even a gap in the bond, opening Pandora's box of paranoid fantasies acting unconsciously. If silence is representative of the whole framework, it promotes in this context the partialization of the clinician's body reduced to one ear and not to a whole body. Here, it is the change of framework that mobilizes the difference, established by Mr. Klein, between the partial and total object; this circumstance neo-framework could therefore call for regressive movements, undoing the silence of its symbolic function when the bodies are present.","Houssier, Florian; Christaki, Angélique; Vlachopoulou, Xanthie",Ann. med.-psychol,551,26

During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, frontline healthcare professionals (HCP) may be at particular risk for infection. No longitudinal data on functional seroconversion in HCP in regions with low COVID-19 prevalence and low pre-test probability exist. METHODS: In a large German university hospital, we performed weekly questionnaire assessments and anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) immunoglobulin G (IgG) measurements with various commercial tests, a novel surrogate virus neutralisation test, and a neutralisation assay using live SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: From baseline to week 6, 1080 screening measurements for anti-SARS CoV-2 (S1) IgG from 217 frontline HCP (65% female) were performed. Overall, 75.6% of HCP reported at least one symptom of respiratory infection. Self-perceived infection probability declined over time (from mean 20.1% at baseline to 12.4% in week 6, p < 0.001). In sera of convalescent patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19, we measured high anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels, obtained highly concordant results from enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) using e.g. the spike 1 (S1) protein domain and the nucleocapsid protein (NCP) as targets, and confirmed antiviral neutralisation. However, in HCP the cumulative incidence for anti-SARS-CoV-2 (S1) IgG was 1.86% for positive and 0.93% for equivocal positive results over the study period of 6 weeks. Except for one HCP, none of the eight initial positive results were confirmed by alternative serology tests or showed in vitro neutralisation against live SARS-CoV-2. The only true seroconversion occurred without symptoms and mounted strong functional humoral immunity. Thus, the confirmed cumulative incidence for neutralizing anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG was 0.47%. CONCLUSION: When assessing anti-SARS-CoV-2 immune status in individuals with low pre-test probability, we suggest confirming positive results from single measurements by alternative serology tests or functional assays. Our data highlight the need for a methodical serology screening approach in regions with low SARS-CoV-2 infection rates.

The precise impact of COVID-19 scare and lockdown on emergency access for acute myocardial infarction (MI) is still subject to debate. METHODS: Data on all patients undergoing invasive coronary angiography at 9 hospitals in the greater area of Rome, Italy, between February 19, 2020 and March 29, 2020, 9, 2020, were retrospectively collected. Incidence of ST-elevation MI (STEMI), and non-ST-elevation MI (NSTEMI), as well as corresponding percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), was compared distinguishing two different 20-day time periods (before vs on or after March 10, 2020). RESULTS: During the study period, 1,068 patients underwent coronary angiography, 142 (13%) with STEMI and 169 (16%) with NSTEMI. The average daily number of STEMI decreased from 4.3 before the lockdown to 2.9 after the lockdown (p=0.021). Similarly, the average daily number of NSTEMI changed from 5.0 to 3.5 (p=0.028). The average daily number of primary PCI changed from 4.2 to 2.9 (p=0.030), while the average daily number of PCI for NSTEMI changed from 3.5 to 2.5 (p=0.087). For STEMI patients, the time from symptom onset to hospital arrival (onset-to-door time less than three hours) showed a significant increase after the lockdown (p=0.018), whereas door-to-balloon time did not change significantly from before to after the lockdown (p=0.609). CONCLUSIONS: The present study, originally reporting on the trends in STEMI and NSTEMI in the Rome area, highlights that significant decreases in the incidence of both acute coronary syndromes occurred between February 19, 2020 and March 29, 2020, together with increases in time from symptom onset to hospital arrival, luckily without changes in door-to-balloon time.","Gaspardone, Achille; Versaci, Francesco; Tomai, Fabrizio; Biondi-Zoccai, Giuseppe; Sgueglia, Gregory A; Gioffré, Gaetano; Romagnoli, Enrico; Mancone, Massimo; Calcagno, Simone; Proietti, Igino; Sciahbasi, Alessandro; DI Pietro, Riccardo; Tanzilli, Gaetano; Mariano, Enrica; Romeo, Francesco",,551,32

A total of 49 children (mean age 11.5 ± 5.12 years) confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled in the study, including 11 (22.4%) domestic cases and 38 (77.6%) imported cases. Nine (81.8%) local cases and 12 (31.6%) imported cases had a definitive epidemiological exposure. Twenty-eight (57.1%) were symptomatic and 21 (42.9%) were asymptomatic. Neither asymptomatic nor symptomatic cases progressed to severe diseases. The mean duration of viral shedding for SARS-CoV-2 in upper respiratory tract was 14.1 ± 6.4 days in asymptomatic cases and 14.8 ± 8.4 days in symptomatic cases (P > 0.05). Forty-five (91.8%) cases had viral RNA detected in stool. The mean duration of viral shedding in stool was 28.1 ± 13.3 days in asymptomatic cases and 30.8 ± 18.6 days in symptomatic participants (P > 0.05). Children < 7 years shed viral RNA in stool for a longer duration than school-aged children (P < 0.05). Forty-three (87.8%) cases had seropositivity for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 within 1-3 weeks after confirmation with infection. In conclusion, asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection may be common in children in the community during the COVID-19 pandemic wave. Asymptomatic cases shed viral RNA in a similar pattern as symptomatic cases do.

The frequency and nature of human-rat encounters may be altered by social distancing policies to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, restaurant closures may reduce food availability for rats and promote rat activity in nearby residential areas, thus increasing public health risks during a period of public health crisis. In this study, we aimed to identify factors associated with increased perceived exposure to rats during a stay-at-home order, describe residents' encounters with rats relevant to their health and well-being, and identify factors associated with increased use of rodent control. METHODS: Urban residents in Chicago, a large city with growing concerns about rats and health disparities, completed an online questionnaire including fixed response and open-ended questions during the spring 2020 stay-at-home order. Analyses included ordinal multivariate regression, spatial analysis, and thematic analysis for open-ended responses. RESULTS: Overall, 21% of respondents (n = 835) reported an increase in rat sightings around their homes during the stay-at-home order and increased rat sightings was positively associated with proximity to restaurants, low-rise apartment buildings, and rat feces in the home (p &#8804; 0.01). Many respondents described feeling unsafe using their patio or yard, and afraid of rats entering their home or spreading disease. Greater engagement with rodent control was associated with property ownership, information about rat control, and areas with lower incomes (p &#8804; 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: More frequent rat encounters may be an unanticipated public health concern during periods of social distancing, especially in restaurant-dense areas or in low-rise apartment buildings. Rat presence may also limit residents' ability to enjoy nearby outdoor spaces, which otherwise might buffer stress experienced during a stay-at-home order. Proactive rat control may be needed to mitigate rat-associated health risks during future stay-at-home orders.","Murray, Maureen H; Byers, Kaylee A; Buckley, Jacqueline; Magle, Seth B; Maffei, Dorothy; Waite, Preeya; German, Danielle",BMC Public Health,551,20

DESIGN: Matched cohort analysis (2014-2019) using the Royal College of General Practitioners Research and Surveillance Centre primary care database. Risk of common infections, viral infections and gastrointestinal infections (including a subset of culture-confirmed infections), and predictors of common infections, were evaluated using multivariable Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: 18 829 people with IBD were matched to 73 316 controls. People with IBD were more likely to present to primary care with a common infection over the study period (46% vs 37% of controls). Risks of common infections, viral infections and gastrointestinal infections (including stool culture-confirmed infections) were increased for people with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease compared with matched controls (HR range 1.12-1.83, all p<0.001). Treatment with oral glucocorticoid therapy, immunotherapies and biologic therapy, but not with aminosalicylates, was associated with increased infection risk in people with IBD. Despite mild lymphopenia and neutropenia being more common in people with IBD (18.4% and 1.9%, respectively) than in controls (6.5% and 1.5%, respectively), these factors were not associated with significantly increased infection risk in people with IBD. CONCLUSION: People with IBD are more likely to present with a wide range of common infections.

This would reduce the doctors' cognitive load and response time to patients by facilitating them in making faster decisions, thus improving the overall quality of online medical services. Three different word-level text highlighting methodologies are implemented and evaluated. The first method uses TF-IDF scores directly to highlight important parts of the text. The second method is a combination of TF-IDF scores and the application of Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations to classification models. The third method uses neural networks directly to make predictions on whether or not a word should be highlighted.

Both ARBs and ACEIs can facilitate COVID-19 entry into the host cell due to increase expression of ACE2 On the other hand, ARBs have a greater potential to reduce downstream pathogenicity of the SARS-CoV2 via different cell signaling pathways including free radical generation, up regulation of NF-κB pathway, toll-like receptors (TLRs) and pro-apoptotic protein by blocking the renin-angiotensin system more severely compared to the effect of ACEIs The current hypothesis is that ARBs can perform better therapeutically compared to ACEIs in respiratory disorders such as ARDS which is induced by viral infection especially since more than 40 % of angiotensin II can be synthesized by other enzymes such as chymase, cathepsin ARBs treatment can increase the levels of both angiotensin II (Ang II) and the ACE2 enzyme making Ang II a target substrate for hydrolysis by ACE2 into Ang 1-7 which in turn exerts anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic and anti-oxidant activities These effects are achieved by the binding of Ang 1-7 to both angiotensin-type 2 receptor (AT2) and receptor mas' axis (Mas) and also by its ability to block Ang II/AT1 receptor-induced TLR4/MyD88 signaling thereby highlighting the potential therapeutic use of ARB sin preventing injury induced by COVID-19 virus It is concluded that patients who are already on ARBs medications must continue to use them daily since ARBs have protective effects against COVID-19 virus Moreover, ARB sexert their beneficial effects via their anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, anti-oxidant and anti-fibrotic properties On the other hand, those patients who are on ACEIs medications must change to other safe drugs since ACEIs can facilitate an increase in COVID-19 virus entry into the body as well as reducing levels and protecting effect of Ang 1-7 © 2020 Ubiquity Press All rights reserved","Hassan, S.

Ensuring access to care, irrespective of COVID-19 status, in winter 2020-2021 is essential. METHODS: An integrated model of hospital capacity planning and epidemiological projections of COVID-19 patients is used to estimate the demand for and resultant spare capacity of ICU beds, staff and ventilators under different epidemic scenarios in France, Germany and Italy across the 2020-2021 winter period. The effect of implementing lockdowns triggered by different numbers of COVID-19 patients in ICUs under varying levels of effectiveness is examined, using a 'dual-demand' (COVID-19 and non-COVID-19) patient model. RESULTS: Without sufficient mitigation, we estimate that COVID-19 ICU patient numbers will exceed those seen in the first peak, resulting in substantial capacity deficits, with beds being consistently found to be the most constrained resource. Reactive lockdowns could lead to large improvements in ICU capacity during the winter season, with pressure being most effectively alleviated when lockdown is triggered early and sustained under a higher level of suppression. The success of such interventions also depends on baseline bed numbers and average non-COVID-19 patient occupancy. CONCLUSION: Reductions in capacity deficits under different scenarios must be weighed against the feasibility and drawbacks of further lockdowns.

SARS-CoV-2 encodes a small hydrophobic envelope (E) protein that mediates envelope formation, budding, replication, and release of progeny viruses from the host. Through this study, the SARS-CoV-2 E protein is studied for its open and closed state and focused in identifying antiviral herbs used in traditional medicine practices for COVID-19 infections. In this study using computational tools, we docked the shortlisted phytochemicals with the envelope protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the results hint that these compounds interact with the pore-lining residues. The molecular level understanding of the open state is considered and the active inhibitors from the phytochemicals of Ayurvedic medicinal plants from Withania somnifera. We have thus identified a potential phytochemical compound that directly binds with the pore region of the E protein and thereby blocks its channel activity. Blocking the ion channel activity of E protein is directly related to the inhibition of virus replication. The study shows encouraging results on the usage of these phytochemicals in the treatment/management of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Abdullah Alharbi, Raed",,551,16

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this observational longitudinal study was to identify nonoverlapping severity subgroups (ie, clusters) among patients with COVID-19, based exclusively on clinical data and standard laboratory tests obtained during patient assessment in the emergency department. METHODS: We applied unsupervised machine learning to a data set of 853 patients with COVID-19 from the HM group of hospitals (HM Hospitales) in Madrid, Spain. Age and sex were not considered while building the clusters, as these variables could introduce biases in machine learning algorithms and raise ethical implications or enable discrimination in triage protocols. RESULTS: From 850 clinical and laboratory variables, four tests-the serum levels of aspartate transaminase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), C-reactive protein (CRP), and the number of neutrophils-were enough to segregate the entire patient pool into three separate clusters. Further, the percentage of monocytes and lymphocytes and the levels of alanine transaminase (ALT) distinguished cluster 3 patients from the other two clusters. The highest proportion of deceased patients; the highest levels of AST, ALT, LDH, and CRP; the highest number of neutrophils; and the lowest percentages of monocytes and lymphocytes characterized cluster 1. Cluster 2 included a lower proportion of deceased patients and intermediate levels of the previous laboratory tests. The lowest proportion of deceased patients; the lowest levels of AST, ALT, LDH, and CRP; the lowest number of neutrophils; and the highest percentages of monocytes and lymphocytes characterized cluster 3. CONCLUSIONS: A few standard laboratory tests, deemed available in all emergency departments, have shown good discriminative power for the characterization of severity subgroups among patients with COVID-19.","Benito-León, Julián; Del Castillo, Mª Dolores; Estirado, Alberto; Ghosh, Ritwik; Dubey, Souvik; Serrano, J Ignacio",J Med Internet Res,551,5

METHODS: This was a cross-sectional time-series study of clinical virology results from children tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in Southern Connecticut and areas of New York and Rhode Island. Data collected include demographics, hospital admission, changes in percent positive tests over time, detection intervals in persistently positive children and cycle threshold values. The setting was the Yale New Haven Health System has 6 hospitals at 4 Connecticut locations, 1 hospital in Rhode Island and ambulatory locations in Connecticut, Rhode Island and New York. Participants included twenty-three-thousand one-hundred thirty-seven children &#8804; 18 years of age, tested for coronavirus disease 2019 at an ambulatory testing site, the emergency department or on an inpatient unit within the Yale New Haven Health System. RESULTS: Among all tests, 3.2% were positive. Older children consistently made up the larger portion of positive pediatric cases, regardless of community prevalence. Increased pediatric cases later in the pandemic when prevalence in adults was relatively low correlates with a higher number of tests performed in children and not with an increased positivity rate. No significant changes in trends of positivity were detected after the reopening of schools. Symptomatic and asymptomatic children had similar cycle threshold values regardless of age, and a subset of children demonstrated persistent viral detection, some for as long as 6 weeks. CONCLUSION: An increase in pediatric cases documented in the late summer was predominately due to increased access to testing for children. The percent positivity in children did not change in the first 3 weeks after school opened. A subset of children has detectable severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 RNA in the upper respiratory tract for weeks after the initial infection.","Peaper, David R; Murdzek, Christina; Oliveira, Carlos R; Murray, Thomas S",Pediatr Infect Dis J,551,20

For example, even when under strict stay-at-home orders, numerous jurisdictions granted exceptions and/or were in close proximity to locations with entirely different regulations in place. Here, we investigate the impact of such geographic inconsistencies in epidemic control policies by coupling search and mobility data to a simple mathematical model of SARS-COV2 transmission. Our results show that while stay-at-home orders decrease contacts in most areas of the US, some specific activities and venues often see an increase in attendance. Indeed, over the month of March 2020, between 10 and 30% of churches in the US saw increases in attendance; even as the total number of visits to churches declined nationally. This heterogeneity, where certain venues see substantial increases in attendance while others close, suggests that closure can cause individuals to find an open venue, even if that requires longer-distance travel. And, indeed, the average distance travelled to churches in the US rose by 13% over the same period. Strikingly, our model reveals that across a broad range of model parameters, partial measures can often be worse than none at all where individuals not complying with policies by traveling to neighboring areas can create epidemics when the outbreak would otherwise have been controlled. Taken together, our data analysis and modelling results highlight the potential unintended consequences of inconsistent epidemic control policies and stress the importance of balancing the societal needs of a population with the risk of an outbreak growing into a large epidemic.","Althouse, Benjamin M.; Wallace, Brendan; Case, Brendan; Scarpino, Samuel V.; Berdahl, Andrew M.; White, Easton R.; Hebert-Dufresne, Laurent",,551,16

(1) It has traditionally been described in intubated patients;however, in the COVID 19 pandemic proning has seen use in spontaneously breathing patients (2). In attempt to prevent progression to mechanical ventilation, we began a protocol of self-proning on any patient with documented COVID 19 infection meetingcriteria for ARDS using the Kigali modification of the Berlin criteria(3).Methods:Charts were reviewed from March 2020 to May 2020 for all admitted COVID-19 positive patients. Patients were divided into two cohorts, self-proning and non-self proning. Data points were time to mechanical ventilation in days, amount of respiratory support required, time at this maximal therapy in days, and number of deaths. Amount of respiratory support was defined as oxygen requirement, nasal canula, HFNC, NIPPV, and mechanical ventilation. Pregnant patients and second admissions were excluded.All statistical analyses were conducted using SYSTAT, version 13. Differences between proning and non-proning groups were tested normality using the Shapiro-Wilks test and for significance via independent samples t-tests, assuming separate variances;three variables (BMI, days to ventilation, days at maximum oxygen therapy) were log-transformed prior to analysis. Discrete variables were tested for significant differences between groups using chi-square tests of association.Results:Of the 117 patients encouraged to self-prone;26 (22.2%) did so, while 91 (77.8 %) did not. Three (3) of 26 (11.5%) patients in the proning group progressed to mechanical ventilation compared to 14 of 87 patients (16.1%) in the nonproning group. This difference was not significant (x2 = 0.32, df = 1, p = 0.572). There was no significant difference between patients in the proning vs. non-proning groups with respect to survival (x2 = 2.09, df = 1, p = 0.148)Conclusion:In our retrospective analysis of the effects of self proning, there was no statistically significant effect on progression to mechanical ventilation in the self proning vs non self proning patients. We feel our study limitations played a large role in this outcome due to the difference in the number of self-proning versus non-self proning, variability in management, and inability to document amount of time spent in the prone position. Ultimately, our study is a small sample size across both the self proning and non self proning groups. Showing self proning does not statistically effect progression to mechanical ventilation.","Meredith, S.; Bhat, P.; Ahmed, M.

RESULTS: The patient did not improve after being treated with lung protective ventilation, pulmonary surfactant replacement, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) for 30 days. However, his disease reversed 5 days after allogeneic UCB infusion, and he weaned from ECMO after 7 days of infusion. Bioinformatics confirmed that his Toll-like receptor (TLR) was abnormal before UCB infusion. However, after the infusion, his immune system was activated and repaired, and the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway was recovered. CONCLUSION: Allogenic UCB could treat ARDS by repairing the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway, thereby achieving stability of the immune system.","Liu, Shuang; Shen, Huili; Huang, Siyuan; Liu, Rong; Qu, Dong",Eur J Med Res,551,17

Data are lacking on the clinical features of and the prognostic criteria for this disorder. METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study involving patients with suspected VITT who presented to hospitals in the United Kingdom between March 22 and June 6, 2021. Data were collected with the use of an anonymized electronic form, and cases were identified as definite or probable VITT according to prespecified criteria. Baseline characteristics and clinicopathological features of the patients, risk factors, treatment, and markers of poor prognosis were determined. RESULTS: Among 294 patients who were evaluated, we identified 170 definite and 50 probable cases of VITT. All the patients had received the first dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine and presented 5 to 48 days (median, 14) after vaccination. The age range was 18 to 79 years (median, 48), with no sex preponderance and no identifiable medical risk factors. Overall mortality was 22%. The odds of death increased by a factor of 2.7 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4 to 5.2) among patients with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, by a factor of 1.7 (95% CI, 1.3 to 2.3) for every 50% decrease in the baseline platelet count, by a factor of 1.2 (95% CI, 1.0 to 1.3) for every increase of 10,000 fibrinogen-equivalent units in the baseline d-dimer level, and by a factor of 1.7 (95% CI, 1.1 to 2.5) for every 50% decrease in the baseline fibrinogen level. Multivariate analysis identified the baseline platelet count and the presence of intracranial hemorrhage as being independently associated with death; the observed mortality was 73% among patients with platelet counts below 30,000 per cubic millimeter and intracranial hemorrhage. CONCLUSIONS: The high mortality associated with VITT was highest among patients with a low platelet count and intracranial hemorrhage.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred and seventy-five providers underwent a 3 h simulation-based session focused on management of shock, mechanical ventilation, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and critical care ultrasound. All participants were sent surveys to assess their comfort with various aspects of critical care following return to their usual work environments. RESULTS: One hundred and eight providers of 175 (62%) completed the survey. Overall, 104/108 responders (96%) felt training either significantly or somewhat improved their knowledge in the management of ICU patients. Responders felt most comfortable in the management of hypoxemia in intubated patients and the management of ventilated patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (93% strongly agree or agree, and 86% strongly agree or agree, respectively). Fewer responders felt more comfortable using focused echocardiography (70% strongly agree or agree) and lung ultrasonography in following progression of COVID-19 (76% strongly agree or agree). CONCLUSIONS: Simulation-based training improved provider comfort in the management of critically ill patients with COVID-19.","Yuriditsky, Eugene; Horowitz, James M.; Nair, Sunil; Kaufman, Brian S.",J Crit Care,551,24

METHODS: Retrospective clinical data collection from MS patients followed at San Raffaele Hospital MS Centre (Milan, Italy). All patients treated with fingolimod or ocrelizumab who had received a complete anti-COVID-19 vaccination course, with no clinical history suggestive of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection and with an available post-vaccination serological assay obtained at least 14 days after vaccination completion were considered for the study. RESULTS: We collected data from 32 MS patients, 16 treated with fingolimod and 16 receiving ocrelizumab. Among the fingolimod group 10 patients (62.5%) had a positive serological response after vaccination and among ocrelizumab-treated patients a positive serological test was found in six cases (37.5%). No relation between serological response and clinical features (i.e., treatment duration, time between vaccination and last treatment dose, and white blood cells count) was identified. CONCLUSIONS: Our initial real-life experience suggests a variable antibody production in MS patients receiving these DMTs. At present, there are no sufficient data to do not recommend anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in these patients.","S., Guerrieri; S., Lazzarin; C., Zanetta; A., Nozzolillo; M., Filippi; L., Moiola",J Neurol,551,16

However, there is a paucity of data on vaccination safety and pregnancy outcomes because pregnant women were excluded from the initial phase III clinical trials. Our objective was to describe the maternal, neonatal, and obstetrical outcomes of women who received a messenger RNA (mRNA) COVID-19 vaccination while pregnant during the first 4 months of vaccine availability. STUDY DESIGN: This was an institutional review board-approved descriptive study of pregnant women at New York University Langone Health who received at least 1 dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccination approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna) from the time of the FDA Emergency Use Authorization to April 22, 2021. Eligible women were identified via search of the electronic medical record (EMR) system. Vaccine administration was ascertained via immunization records from the New York State Department of Health. Women were excluded if they were vaccinated before conception or during the postpartum period. Charts were reviewed for maternal demographics and pregnancy outcomes. Descriptive analyses were performed using the R software version 4.0.2 (The R Foundation, Boston, MA). RESULTS: We identified 424 pregnant women who received an mRNA vaccination. Of those, 348 (82.1%) received both doses and 76 (17.9%) received only 1 dose. The maternal characteristics and vaccination information are shown in Table 1. Of the included women, 4.9% had a history of a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis before vaccination. After vaccination, no patient in our cohort was diagnosed with COVID-19. In terms of the pregnancy outcomes, 9 women had spontaneous abortions, 3 terminated their pregnancies, and 327 have ongoing pregnancies. Of the women included, 85 delivered liveborn infants. There were no stillbirths in our population. Of the 9 spontaneous abortions, 8 occurred during the first trimester at a range of 6 to 13 weeks' gestation. There was 1 second trimester loss. The rate of spontaneous abortion among women vaccinated in the first trimester was 6.5%. The 327 women with ongoing pregnancies have been followed for a median of 4.6 weeks (range, 0-17 weeks) following their most recent dose. A total of 113 (34.6%) women, initiated vaccination during the first trimester, 178 (54.4%) initiated vaccination during the second trimester, and 36 (11.0%) during the third trimester. Following the vaccination, 2 fetuses (0.6%) developed intrauterine growth restriction, whereas 5 (1.5%) were diagnosed with anomalies. Outcomes for the 85 women who delivered are shown in Table 2. Of the women who delivered, 18.8% were diagnosed with a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy. The rate of preterm birth was 5.9%. One preterm delivery was medically indicated, whereas the remaining 3 were spontaneous. A total of 15.3% of neonates required admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Of the NICU admissions, 61.5% were because of hypoglycemia or an evaluation for sepsis. Other reasons for admission included prematurity, hypothermia, and transient tachypnea of the newborn. Of all the neonates, 12.2% were small for gestational age (SGA) per the World Health Organization standards. CONCLUSION: This series describes our experience with women who received an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine during pregnancy. In line with other published findings,2 we observed no concerning trends. There were no stillbirths. Our 6.5% rate of spontaneous abortion is within the expected rate of 10%,3 and our preterm birth rate of 5.9% is below the national average of 9.5%.4 Our rate of pregnancy-related hypertensive disorders is higher than our baseline institutional rate of 9.5%, however, this may be because of the underlying characteristics of our study population or skewing of our small sample size. Our 12.2% rate of SGA neonates is near the expected value based on the definition that 10% of neonates will be SGA at birth. The NICU admission rate is at par with our institutional rate of 12%. To date, most women in this series have had uncomplicated pregnancies and have delivered at-term. Strengths of this study include using the EMR system to identify subjects and gather data. We did not rely on self-enrollment and self-report, thereby reducing selection and recall bias. By performing manual chart reviews, we obtained detailed and reliable information about individual patients. One limitation of this study is the lack of a matched control group consisting of unvaccinated pregnant women and therefore direct conclusions could not be drawn about the relative risks of complications. In addition, our cohort is small and may not be generalizable. Finally, many women included are healthcare workers who had early access to vaccinations. As more pregnant women become eligible for the COVID-19 vaccinations, there is an urgent need to report on the maternal, neonatal, and obstetrical outcomes of COVID-19 vaccinations during pregnancy. The results of this study can be used to counsel and reassure pregnant patients facing this decision.","Trostle, Megan E.; Limaye, Meghana A.; Avtushka, Ms. Valeryia; Lighter, Jennifer L.; Penfield, Christina A.; Roman, Ashley S.",Am J Obstet Gynecol MFM,551,21

Through a realist analysis of a survey of health professionals, we have sought to identify the underlying mechanisms that have assisted Australian health services adapt to the physical separation between clinicians and patients. Methods: Using a critical realist ontology and epistemology, we undertook an online survey of health professionals subscribing to the Australian Telehealth Society newsletter. The survey had close- and open-ended questions, constructed to identify contextual changes in the operating environment for telehealth services, and assess the mechanisms which had contributed to these changes. We applied descriptive and McNemar's Chi-square analysis for the close-ended component of the survey, and a reflexive thematic analysis approach for the open-ended questions which were framed within the activity based funding system which had previously limited telehealth services to regional Australia. Results: Of the 91 respondents most (73%) reported a higher volume of telephone-based care since COVID and an increase in use of video consultations (60% of respondents). Respondents felt that the move to provide care using telehealth services had been a “forced adoption” where clinicians began to use telehealth services (often for the first time) to maintain health care. Respondents noted significant changes in managerial and medical culture which supported the legitimisation of telehealth services as a mode of access to care. The support of leaders and the use personal and organisational networks to facilitate the operation of telehealth service were felt to be particularly valuable. Access to, and reliability of, the technology were considered extremely important for services. Respondents also welcomed the increased availability of more human and financial resources. Conclusions: During the pandemic, mechanisms that legitimise practise, build confidence, support relationships and supply resources have fostered the use of telehealth. This ongoing interaction between telehealth services, contexts and mechanisms is complex. The adoption of telehealth access to enable physically separated care, may mark a “new context;” or it could be that once the pandemic passes, previous policies and practises will re-assert themselves and curb support for telehealth-enabled care.","Taylor, Alan; Caffery, Liam J.; Gesesew, Hailay Abrha; King, Alice; Bassal, Abdel-rahman; Ford, Kim; Kealey, Jane; Maeder, Anthony; McGuirk, Michelle; Parkes, Donna; Ward, Paul R.",Front Public Health,551,10

Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have been verified with significant improvement in the therapy of fibrosis diseases, but the mechanism is still unclear. We attempted to explore the new mechanism and therapeutic target of MSCs against renal fibrosis based on renal proteomics. METHODS: TIF model was induced by adenine gavage. Bone marrow-derived MSCs was injected by tail vein after modeling. Renal function and fibrosis related parameters were assessed by Masson, Sirius red, immunohistochemistry, and western blot. Renal proteomics was analyzed using iTRAQ-based mass spectrometry. Further possible mechanism was explored by transfected galectin-3 gene for knockdown (Gal-3 KD) and overexpression (Gal-3 OE) in HK-2 cells with lentiviral vector. RESULTS: MSCs treatment clearly decreased the expression of α-SMA, collagen type I, II, III, TGF-β1, Kim-1, p-Smad2/3, IL-6, IL-1β, and TNFα compared with model rats, while p38 MAPK increased. Proteomics showed that only 40 proteins exhibited significant differences (30 upregulated, 10 downregulated) compared MSCs group with the model group. Galectin-3 was downregulated significantly in renal tissues and TGF-β1-induced rat tubular epithelial cells and interstitial fibroblasts, consistent with the iTRAQ results. Gal-3 KD notably inhibited the expression of p-Akt, p-GSK3β and snail in TGF-β1-induced HK-2 cells fibrosis. On the contrary, Gal-3 OE obviously increased the expression of p-Akt, p-GSK3β and snail. CONCLUSION: The mechanism of MSCs anti-renal fibrosis was probably mediated by galectin-3/Akt/GSK3β/Snail signaling pathway. Galectin-3 may be a valuable target for treating renal fibrosis.","Tang, Huajun; Zhang, Peiyue; Zeng, Lianlin; Zhao, Yu; Xie, Libo; Chen, Bo",Stem Cell Res Ther,551,16

Obesity is a well-known predisposed chronic inflammatory condition. The dynamics of obesity and its impacts on immunity may change the disease severity of pneumonia, especially in acute respiratory distress syndrome, a primary cause of death from SARS-CoV-2 infection. The adipocytes of adipose tissue secret leptin in proportion to individuals’ body fat mass. An increase in circulating plasma leptin is a typical characteristic of obesity and correlates with a leptin-resistant state. Leptin is considered a pleiotropic molecule regulating appetite and immunity. In immunity, leptin functions as a cytokine and coordinates the host’s innate and adaptive responses by promoting the Th1 type of immune response. Leptin induced the proliferation and functions of antigen-presenting cells, monocytes, and T helper cells, subsequently influencing the pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion by these cells, such as TNF-α, IL-2, or IL-6. Leptin scarcity or resistance is linked with dysregulation of cytokine secretion leading to autoimmune disorders, inflammatory responses, and increased susceptibility towards infectious diseases. Therefore, leptin activity by leptin long-lasting super active antagonist’s dysregulation in patients with obesity might contribute to high mortality rates in these patients during SARS-CoV-2 infection. This review systematically discusses the interplay mechanism between leptin and inflammatory cytokines and their contribution to the fatal outcomes in COVID-19 patients with obesity.","Maurya, Radheshyam; Sebastian, Prince; Namdeo, Madhulika; Devender, Moodu; Gertler, Arieh",Front Immunol,551,20

Fuel stations have been a major concern for people and health experts due to the frequent use of common nozzles. This study was performed to identify the COVID-19 virus in the nozzles of fuel supply stations. In the current research, 25 fuel supply stations along the main street ways were investigated to recognize Coronavirus infection on the surfaces of the nozzles. For each fuel supply station, 4 nozzles were chosen (a total of 100 samples). The sampling was carried out at two periods of time, that is, before and after quarantine restrictions. Swapping was used for surface sampling, and Real-time PCR was used to determine the positive and negative results. The results showed that out of nine fuel supply stations (36 samples of nozzle surfaces), five were positive for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 on the nozzle surfaces before the corona restriction. The results showed that in the conditions after corona restriction, all samples were negative in terms of the presence of SARS-CoV-2 on the surfaces of the nozzles. In spite of the fact that gas stations can be one of the foremost inclined places for the transmission and spread of coronavirus due to the nearness and visit of individuals, but through the observance of health behaviors and implementing some procedures, cutting the transmission chain in gas stations can be facilitated.","Karami, Chiman; Normohammadi, Ali; Dargahi, Abdollah; Vosoughi, Mehdi; Zandian, Hamed; Jeddi, Farhad; Mokhtari, S.

To better understand the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and build up the host anti-viral immunity, we examined the levels of ACE2 expression on different types of immune cells including tissue macrophages. Flow cytometry demonstrated that there was little to no expression of ACE2 on most of the human peripheral blood-derived immune cells including CD4+ T, CD8+ T, activated CD4+ T, activated CD8+ T, CD4+CD25+CD127low/− regulatory T cells (Tregs), Th17 cells, NKT cells, B cells, NK cells, monocytes, dendritic cells (DCs), and granulocytes. Additionally, there was no ACE2 expression (< 1%) found on platelets. Compared with interleukin-4-treated type 2 macrophages (M2), the ACE2 expression was markedly increased on the activated type 1 macrophages (M1) after the stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that high expressions of ACE2 were colocalized with tissue macrophages, such as alveolar macrophages found within the lungs and Kupffer cells within livers of mice. Flow cytometry confirmed the very low level of ACE2 expression on human primary pulmonary alveolar epithelial cells. These data indicate that alveolar macrophages, as the frontline immune cells, may be directly targeted by the SARS-CoV-2 infection and therefore need to be considered for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.","Song, Xiang; Hu, Wei; Yu, Haibo; Zhao, Laura; Zhao, Yeqian; Zhao, Yong",bioRxiv,551,21

DESIGN: Retrospective case report of critically ill coronavirus disease 2019 patients treated with PLacental eXpanded (PLX)-PAD from March 26, 2020, to April 4, 2020, with follow-up through May 2, 2020. SETTING: Four hospitals in Israel (Rambam Health Care Campus, Bnai Zion Medical Center, and Samson Assuta Ashdod University Hospital), and Holy Name Medical Center in New Jersey. PATIENTS: Eight critically ill patients on invasive mechanical ventilation, suffering from acute respiratory distress syndrome due to coronavirus disease 2019. INTERVENTIONS: Intramuscular injection of PLacental eXpanded (PLX)-PAD (300 × 10(6) cells) given as one to two treatments. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Mortality, time to discharge, and changes in blood and respiratory variables were monitored during hospitalization to day 17 posttreatment. Of the eight patients treated (median age 55 yr, seven males and one female), five were discharged, two remained hospitalized, and one died. By day 3 postinjection, mean C-reactive protein fell 45% (240.3–131.3 mg/L; p = 0.0019) and fell to 77% by day 5 (56.0 mg/L; p < 0.0001). Pao(2)/Fio(2) improved in 5:8 patients after 24-hour posttreatment, with similar effects 48-hour posttreatment. A decrease in positive end-expiratory pressure and increase in pH were statistically significant between days 0 and 14 (p = 0.0032 and p = 0.00072, respectively). A decrease in hemoglobin was statistically significant for days 0–5 and 0–14 (p = 0.015 and p = 0.0028, respectively), whereas for creatinine, it was statistically significant between days 0 and 14 (p = 0.032). CONCLUSIONS: Improvement in several variables such as C-reactive protein, positive end-expiratory pressure, and Pao(2)/Fio(2) was observed following PLacental eXpanded (PLX)-PAD treatment, suggesting possible therapeutic effect. However, interpretation of the data is limited due to the small sample size, use of concomitant investigational therapies, and the uncontrolled study design.

The transmission rate is reported to be high for this novel strain of coronavirus, called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), as compared to its predecessors. Major strategies in terms of clinical trials of medicines and vaccines, social distancing, use of personal protective equipment (PPE), and so on are being implemented in order to control the spread. The current study concentrates on lockdown and social distancing policy followed by the Indian Government and evaluates its effectiveness using Bayesian probability model (BPM). The change point analysis (CPA) done through the above approach suggests that the states which implemented the lockdown before the exponential rise of cases are able to control the spread of the disease in a much better and efficient way. The analysis has been done for states of Maharashtra, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, and Delhi as union territory. The highest value of Δ (delta) is reported for Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh with a value of 9.6 weeks, while the lowest value is 4.7, evidently for Maharashtra which is the worst affected. All of the states indicate a significant correlation (p < 0.05, tstat > tcritical) for Δ, i.e., the difference in the time period of CPA and lockdown with cases per population (CPP) and cases per unit area (CPUA), while weak correlation (p < 0.1 and tstat < tcritical) is exhibited by delta and cases per unit population density (CPD). For both CPP and CPUA, tstat > tcritical indicating a significant correlation, while Pearson’s correlation indicates the direction to be negative. Further analysis in terms of identification of high-risk areas has been studied from the Voronoi approach of GIS based on the inputs from BPM. All the states follow the above pattern of high population, high case scenario, and the boundaries of risk zones can be identified by Thiessen polygon (TP) constructed therein.

This project assessed aggregate changes in the quality of the evidence supporting these schedules to establish a comprehensive evidence base for future reference and highlight aspects for future study. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Based on a systematic review of published recommendations related to dose fractionation during the COVID-19 pandemic, 20 expert panelists assigned to 14 disease groups named and graded the highest quality of evidence schedule(s) used routinely for each condition and also graded all COVID-era recommended schedules. The American Society for Radiation Oncology quality of evidence criteria were used to rank the schedules. Process-related statistics and changes in distributions of quality ratings of the highest-rated versus recommended COVID-19 era schedules were described by disease groups and for specific clinical scenarios. RESULTS: From January to May 2020 there were 54 relevant publications, including 233 recommended COVID-19–adapted dose fractionations. For site-specific curative and site-specific palliative schedules, there was a significant shift from established higher-quality evidence to lower-quality evidence and expert opinions for the recommended schedules (P = .022 and P < .001, respectively). For curative-intent schedules, the distribution of quality scores was essentially reversed (highest levels of evidence ""pre-COVID"" vs ""in-COVID"": high quality, 51.4% vs 4.8%; expert opinion, 5.6% vs 49.3%), although there was variation in the magnitude of shifts between disease sites and among specific indications. CONCLUSIONS: A large number of publications recommended hypofractionated radiation therapy schedules across numerous major disease sites during the COVID-19 pandemic, which were supported by a lower quality of evidence than the highest-quality routinely used dose fractionation schedules. This work provides an evidence-based assessment of these potentially practice-changing recommendations and informs individualized decision-making and counseling of patients. These data could also be used to support radiation therapy practices in the event of second waves or surges of the pandemic in new regions of the world.","Thomson, David J.; Yom, Sue S.; Saeed, Hina; El Naqa, Issam; Ballas, Leslie; Bentzen, Soren M.; Chao, Samuel T.; Choudhury, Ananya; Coles, Charlotte E.; Dover, Laura; Guadagnolo, B.

The use of this method revealed the existence of general rules for the cooperative oligomeric organization of a wide list of genomes. These rules are called hyperbolic because they are associated with hyperbolic sequences including the harmonic progression 1, 1/2, 1/3, .., 1/n. These rules are demonstrated by examples of quantitative analysis of many genomes from the human genome to the genomes of archaea and bacteria. The hyperbolic (harmonic) rules, speaking about the existence of algebraic invariants in full genomic sequences, are considered as candidates for the role of universal rules for the cooperative organization of genomes. The results concerns additionally the problem of the origin of life. The described phenomenological results were obtained as consequences of the previously published author's quantum-information model of long DNA sequences. The oligomer sums method was also applied to the analysis of long genes and viruses including the COVID-19 virus; this revealed, in characteristics of many of them, the phenomenon of such rhythmically repeating deviations from model hyperbolic sequences, which are associated with DNA triplets. In addition, an application of the oligomer sums method is shown to the analysis of amino acid sequences in long proteins like the protein Titin.

The prevalence of HAI and its associated factors are not well described in the context of Ethiopia. Currently, the nationwide prevalence of HAI and its corresponding associated factors have not been formally reported in Ethiopia. This review will provide an estimate of the prevalence of HAI and its associated factors. METHODS: Scholarly articles will be selected from the Embase, PubMed, Cochrane library, Hinary, Scopus, Web of Science and Google Scholar databases. Articles within the timeline of January 2000 to December 2020 will be included for review. Observational studies, randomised trials, surveys, surveillance reports, published and grey literature that reported the prevalence of HAI or factors associated with HAI reported as OR (95% CI) with no language restriction will be included in the analysis. Screening and selection of articles will be done using web-based Covidence software. The article's quality and risk of bias will be critically appraised using Johanna Briggs Institute quality appraisal checklist. Random effects model using the inverse variance method will be conducted to estimate the prevalence of HAI. To examine heterogeneity, the Q statistics and I2 statistics will be conducted. Publication bias will be investigated using Begg's correlation method and Egger's weighted regression test. All analyses will be performed with STATA (V.14) software. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval is not required for meta-analysis reviews as participants are not included. The review will be submitted for publication in peer-reviewed journals.","Gebregiorgis, Birhan Gebresillassie; Takele, Goitom Molalign; Ayenew, Kassahun Dires; Amare, Yosef Eshetie",BMJ Open,551,6

We aimed to further evaluate the influence of corticosteroids on mortality in adult patients with influenza pneumonia by comparing corticosteroid-treated and placebo-treated patients. METHODS: The PubMed, Embase, Medline, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and Information Sciences Institute (ISI) Web of Science databases were searched for all controlled studies that compared the effects of corticosteroids and placebo in adult patients with influenza pneumonia. The primary outcome was mortality, and the secondary outcomes were mechanical ventilation (MV) days, length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU LOS), and the rate of secondary infection. RESULTS: Ten trials involving 6548 patients were pooled in our final analysis. Significant heterogeneity was found in all outcome measures except for ICU LOS (I(2) = 38%, P = 0.21). Compared with placebo, corticosteroids were associated with higher mortality (risk ratio [RR] 1.75, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.30 ~ 2.36, Z = 3.71, P = 0.0002), longer ICU LOS (mean difference [MD] 2.14, 95% CI 1.17 ~ 3.10, Z = 4.35, P < 0.0001), and a higher rate of secondary infection (RR 1.98, 95% CI 1.04 ~ 3.78, Z = 2.08, P = 0.04) but not MV days (MD 0.81, 95% CI − 1.23 ~ 2.84, Z = 0.78, P = 0.44) in patients with influenza pneumonia.

It is a cultural masterplot: a story with which almost everyone is familiar, which can deeply and intrinsically shape the way we think about how we live. This article examines how people interact with the romance masterplot and how it affects their search for love on dating apps in Australia during the global pandemic in 2020. Using data drawn from interviews and focus groups, and combining sociological research and narrative theory, we explore the way the romance masterplot affects the way people approach romance in dating apps, and how this has been complicated by the pandemic. We propose that participants use of dating apps in this period was characterised by ‘jagged love’, which we have theorised in relation to Zygmunt Bauman’s notion of ‘liquid love’. This manifested cyclically, as participants turned to the apps seeking the security offered by the romance masterplot in a time of global uncertainty; swiped, matched, and messaged in large numbers, and lost faith in the apps ability to deliver on the romantic masterplot. While episodic behaviour on dating apps is not new, the pandemic heightened and accelerated the process as people desperately sought the certainty offered by the romance masterplot, quickly lost faith because of the limitations of the pandemic, and then returned again.","Portolan, Lisa; McAlister, Jodi",Sex Cult,551,16

Local residents rely on their CAHs as the only providers for many miles around. When the COVID-19 pandemic hit in early 2020, CAH leaders had to rethink operations and priorities, both internally with staffs and externally with community leaders and organizations. Few critical care beds were available when the need was greatest. Testing was problematic, and cultural barriers complicated care. Now, as virus variants strike where vaccination numbers are low, CAH leaders remain wary of financial hits to elective procedure income, limited resources, and added stress for their staffs. Working with community service organizations and larger regional healthcare centers is a crucial strategy for CAHs as they address care delivery issues and ensure that their caregivers can do their jobs now and in the future.","Schou, Patricia M",Front Health Serv Manage,551,21

METHODS: For this purpose, the data envelopment analysis approach was used to measure the efficiency, considering the number of personnel and vehicles and screened passengers as the input and output parameters, respectively. It was examined the efficiency of 10 IRCS’s branches given 17 d of screening operation. For the analysis, the DEA SolverPro software 15a version was used. RESULTS: The results show that only 1 branch had been fully efficient in using the resources, while 5 branches showed less than 50% efficiency. This study reveals that it is unnecessary to use a fixed number of volunteers at different stations with different passenger numbers. CONCLUSIONS: Using resources without efficient planning can lead to direct costs such as food, transportation, and maintenance, as well as indirect costs such as burnout, fatigue, and stress when responding to the COVID-19 pandemic. This analysis should support IRCS’s managers to move their valuable resources from inefficient to efficient centers to increase the screening rate and reduce the fatigue of aid workers for the next pandemic rounds.","Seddighi, Hamed; Baharmand, Hossein; Morovati Sharifabadi, Ali; Salmani, Ibrahim; Seddighi, Saeideh",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,551,16

Yet, the question regarding the possible role of these arthropods as SARS-CoV-2 passive/biological transmission vectors is still poorly explored. In this study, we performed in silico structural and binding energy calculations to assess the risks associated with possible ectoparasite transmission. We found sufficient similarity between ectoparasite ACE and human ACE2 protein sequences to build good quality 3D-models of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike:ACE complex to assess the impacts of ectoparasite mutations on complex stability. For several species (e.g., water flea, deer tick, body louse), our analyses showed no significant destabilisation of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike:ACE complex, suggesting these species would bind the viral Spike protein. Our structural analyses also provide structural rationale for interactions between the viral Spike and the ectoparasite ACE proteins. Although we do not have experimental evidence of infection in these ectoparasites, the predicted stability of the complex suggests this is possible, raising concerns of a possible role in passive transmission of the virus to their human hosts.","Lam, Su Datt; Ashford, Paul; Díaz-Sánchez, Sandra; Villar, Margarita; Gortázar, Christian; de la Fuente, José; Orengo, Christine",Viruses,551,5

The latter two are approved active pharmaceutical ingredients of anti-malarial drugs. Concentration–response antiviral treatment assays, based on immunostaining of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein, revealed that treatment with all studied extracts and compounds inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection of VeroE6 cells, human hepatoma Huh7.5 cells and human lung cancer A549-hACE2 cells, without obvious influence of the cell type on antiviral efficacy. In treatment assays, artesunate proved most potent (range of 50% effective concentrations (EC(50)) in different cell types: 7–12 µg/mL), followed by artemether (53–98 µg/mL), A. annua extracts (83–260 µg/mL) and artemisinin (151 to at least 208 µg/mL). The selectivity indices (SI), calculated based on treatment and cell viability assays, were mostly below 10 (range 2 to 54), suggesting a small therapeutic window. Time-of-addition experiments in A549-hACE2 cells revealed that artesunate targeted SARS-CoV-2 at the post-entry level.

In this preliminary report, we aim to describe the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, and outcomes of adult critically ill COVID-19 patients, requiring invasive mechanical ventilation (iMV), and receiving IL-6RA and steroids therapy over the last 11 months. MATERIALS AND METHODS: International, multicenter, cohort study derived from Viral Infection and Respiratory Illness University Study registry and conducted through Discovery Network, Society of Critical Care Medicine. Data were collected between March 01, 2020, and January 10, 2021. RESULTS: Of 860 patients who met eligibility criteria, 589 received steroids, 170 IL-6RAs, and 101 combinations. Patients who received IL-6RAs were younger (median age of 57.5 years vs. 61.1 and 61.8 years in the steroids and combination groups, respectively). The median C-reactive protein level was > 75 mg/L, indicating a hyperinflammatory phenotype. The median daily steroid dose was 7.5 mg dexamethasone or equivalent (interquartile range: 6–14 mg); 80.8% and 19.2% received low-dose and high-dose steroids, respectively. Of the patients who received IL-6RAs, the majority received one dose of tocilizumab and sarilumab (dose range of 600–800 mg for tocilizumab and 200–400 mg for sarilumab). Regarding the timing of administration, we observed that steroid and IL-6RA administration on day 0 of ICU admission was only 55.6% and 39.5%, respectively. By day 28, when compared with steroid use alone, IL-6RA use was associated with an adjusted incidence rate ratio (aIRR) of 1.12 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.88, 1.4) for ventilator-free days, while combination therapy was associated with an aIRR of 0.83 (95% CI 0.6, 1.14). IL-6RA use was associated with an adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of 0.68 (95% CI 0.44, 1.07) for the 28-day mortality rate, while combination therapy was associated with an aOR of 1.07 (95% CI 0.67, 1.70). Liver dysfunction was higher in IL-6RA group (p = 0.04), while the bacteremia rate did not differ among groups. CONCLUSIONS: Discordance was observed between the registry utilization patterns (i.e., timing of steroids and IL-6RA administration) and new evidence from the recent randomized controlled trials and guideline recommendations. These data will help us to identify areas of improvement in prescribing patterns and enhance our understanding of IL-6RA safety with different steroid regimens.

In this context, a strong synergy between the structural biophysics and molecular modeling and simulation communities has emerged, resolving at the atomistic level the crucial protein apparatus of the virus and revealing the dynamic aspects of key viral processes.

We developed a cell line with inducible ACE2 expression to confirm that D614G more efficiently enters cells with ACE2 levels spanning the different primary cells targeted by SARS-CoV-2. Using a new assay for crosslinking and directly extracting Spike trimers from the pseudovirus surface, we found an increase in trimerization efficiency and viral incorporation of D614G protomers.

It is well known that Kawasaki disease is one of the most common causes of acquired heart diseases in children in the developed countries. Many studies, have suggested that heterogeneous infectious agents, such as common viruses, may trigger Kawasaki disease in young children with genetic background. Nowadays we are facing a pandemic caused by a Novel Coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2. Consequently, it could be possible that once exposed to this new coronavirus, some children, genetically predisposed, may mount an exaggerated inflammatory response which clinically manifests as Kawasaki Disease. METHODS: from January to May 2020 a systematic search was performed on Pubmed for the following search terms: “COVID-19”, “children”, “SARS-CoV-2”, “complications”, “Kawasaki disease”, “cytokine storm”. RESULTS: Usually, infants and children present milder symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 disease with a better outcome than adults. At variance, some children may be genetically disposed to a more robust inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2, similar to Kawasaki disease. In fact, Kawasaki disease is the result of an abnormal immune response, in susceptible children, to an external trigger such as an infection. Thus, according to the pathogenesis of Kawasaki disease, paediatricians may expect an increase in cases of Kawasaki disease during the COVID-19 pandemic.

From previously published evidence, ACE2 and TMPRSS2, are both pivotal entry molecules that enable cellular infection by SARS-CoV-2. Meanwhile, increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, or a “cytokine storm,” is associated with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome that is often observed in critically ill patients. Methods We investigated the expression pattern of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in major organs in the human body, especially under specific disease conditions. Multiple sequence alignment of ACE2 in different species was used to explain animal susceptibility. Moreover, the cell-specific expression patterns of ACE2 and cytokine receptors in the urinary tract were assessed using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Additional biological relevance was determined through Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) using an ACE2 specific signature. Results Our results revealed that ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were highly expressed in genitourinary organs. ACE2 was highly and significantly expressed in the kidney among individuals with chronic kidney diseases or diabetic nephropathy. In single cells, ACE2 was primarily enriched in gametocytes in the testis, and renal proximal tubules. The receptors for pro-inflammatory cytokines, especially IL6ST, were remarkably concentrated in endothelial cells, macrophages, and spermatogonial stem cells in the testis, and renal endothelial cells, which suggested the occurrence of alternative damaging mechanisms via autoimmune attacks. Conclusions This study provided new insights into the pathogenicity mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 that underlie the clinical manifestations observed in the human testis and kidney. These observations might substantially facilitate the development of effective treatments for this rapidly spreading disease.","Ren, Xiaohan; Wei, Xiyi; Li, Guangyao; Ren, Shancheng; Chen, Xinglin; Zhang, Tongtong; Zhang, Xu; Lu, Zhongwen; You, Zebing; Wang, Shangqian; Qin, Chao; Song, Ninghong; Wang, Zengjun",bioRxiv,551,16

In the current study, we performed a multidimensional association analysis to explore the correlation between the GHS Index and COVID-19-associated morbidity, mortality, and disease increase rate (DIR) in 178 countries (regions). Methods GHS Index and COVID-19 epidemic data were extracted from online databases, including total cases per million (TCPM), total deaths per million (TDPM), and daily growth rate. We applied the Spearman correlation coefficient to describe the strength of the association between the GHS Index, sociological characteristics, and the epidemic situation of COVID-19. DIRs were compared, and the impact of the GHS Index on the DIR by the time of “lockdown” was visualized. Results The overall GHS Index was positively correlated with TCPM and TDPM, with coefficients of 0.34 and 0.41, respectively. Countries categorized into different GHS Index tiers had different DIRs before implementing “lockdown” measures. However, after implementing “lockdown” measures, no significant difference was observed between countries in the middle and upper tiers. The correlation between GHS Index and DIR was positive five days before “lockdown” measures were taken, but it became negative 13 days later. Conclusions The GHS Index has limited value in assessing a country's capacity to respond to a global pandemic. Nevertheless, it has potential value in determining the country’s ability to cope with a local epidemic situation.","Ji, Ye; Shao, Jun; Tao, Bilin; Song, Huan; Li, Zhongqi; Wang, Jianming",Int J Infect Dis,551,21

METHODS: Clinical data on COVID-19 inpatients in Zengdu Hospital from January 27 to March 11, 2020 were collected; this is a community hospital in an area surrounding Wuhan and supported by volunteer doctors. All hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were included in this study. The epidemiological findings, clinical features, laboratory findings, radiologic manifestations, and clinical outcomes of these patients were analyzed. The patients were followed up for clinical outcomes until March 22, 2020. Severe COVID-19 cases include severe and critical cases diagnosed according to the seventh edition of China’s COVID-19 diagnostic guidelines. Severe and critical COVID-19 cases were diagnosed according to the seventh edition of China’s COVID-19 diagnostic guidelines. RESULTS: All hospitalized COVID-19 patients, 276 (median age: 51.0 years), were enrolled, including 262 non-severe and 14 severe patients. The proportion of patients aged over 60 years was higher in the severe group (78.6%) than in the non-severe group (18.7%, p < 0.01). Approximately a quarter of the patients (24.6%) had at least one comorbidity, such as hypertension, diabetes, or cancer, and the proportion of patients with comorbidities was higher in the severe group (85.7%) than in the non-severe group (21.4%, p < 0.01). Common symptoms included fever (82.2% [227/276]) and cough (78.0% [218/276]). 38.4% (106/276) of the patients had a fever at the time of admission. Most patients (94.9% [204/276]) were cured and discharged; 3.6% (10/276) deteriorated to a critical condition and were transferred to another hospital. The median COVID-19 treatment duration and hospital stay were 14.0 and 18.0 days, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Most of the COVID-19 patients in Zengdu had mild disease. Older patients with underlying diseases were at a higher risk of progression to severe disease. The length of hospital-stay and antiviral treatment duration for COVID-19 were slightly longer than those in Wuhan. This work will contribute toward an understanding of COVID-19 characteristics in the areas around the core COVID-19 outbreak region and serve as a reference for decision-making for epidemic prevention and control in similar areas.","Wei, Yiping; Zeng, Weibiao; Huang, Xiangyun; Li, Junyu; Qiu, Xingting; Li, Huadong; Liu, Dinghua; He, Zhaofeng; Yao, Wenzhong; Huang, Ping; Li, Chao; Zhu, Min; Zhong, Chunlan; Zhu, Xingen; Liu, Jiansheng",BMC Infect Dis,551,32

We aimed to investigate efficacy, acceptability, and tolerability of NPI in households with influenza index patients. METHODS: We conducted a cluster randomized controlled trial during the pandemic season 2009/10 and the ensuing influenza season 2010/11. We included households with an influenza positive index case in the absence of further respiratory illness within the preceding 14 days. Study arms were wearing a facemask and practicing intensified hand hygiene (MH group), wearing facemasks only (M group) and none of the two (control group). Main outcome measure was laboratory confirmed influenza infection in a household contact. We used daily questionnaires to examine adherence and tolerability of the interventions. RESULTS: We recruited 84 households (30 control, 26 M and 28 MH households) with 82, 69 and 67 household contacts, respectively. In 2009/10 all 41 index cases had a influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 infection, in 2010/11 24 had an A (H1N1) pdm09 and 20 had a B infection. The total secondary attack rate was 16% (35/218). In intention-to-treat analysis there was no statistically significant effect of the M and MH interventions on secondary infections. When analysing only households where intervention was implemented within 36 h after symptom onset of the index case, secondary infection in the pooled M and MH groups was significantly lower compared to the control group (adjusted odds ratio 0.16, 95% CI, 0.03-0.92). In a per-protocol analysis odds ratios were significantly reduced among participants of the M group (adjusted odds ratio, 0.30, 95% CI, 0.10-0.94). With the exception of MH index cases in 2010/11 adherence was good for adults and children, contacts and index cases. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that household transmission of influenza can be reduced by the use of NPI, such as facemasks and intensified hand hygiene, when implemented early and used diligently. Concerns about acceptability and tolerability of the interventions should not be a reason against their recommendation.

Although each of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 mAbs was able to neutralize the spike-coated lentiviruses, IgM and IgA neutralized the viral particles at 225-fold and 125-fold lower concentrations, respectively, than that of IgG. Our finding that the neutralization ability of Igs with the same Fab domain was dramatically higher for IgM and IgA than IgG mAbs suggests a strategy for developing effective and affordable antibody therapies for COVID-19. The efficient neutralization conferred by IgM and IgA mAbs can be explained by their capacity to bind multiple virions. While several IgG mAbs have been approved as therapeutics by the FDA, there are currently no IgM or IgA mAbs available. We suggest that mAbs with multiple antigen-binding sites such as IgM and IgA could be developed as the new generation of therapy.","Pisil, Yalcin; Yazici, Zafer; Shida, Hisatoshi; Miura, Tomoyuki",Pathogens,551,1

These characteristics make HFOV conceptually attractive as an ideal lung-protective ventilatory mode for the management of ARDS, as the high mPaws prevent cyclical derecruitment of the lung and the small Vts limit alveolar overdistension. In this review, we will summarize the literature describing the use of HFOV in adult patients with ARDS. In addition, we will discuss recent experimental studies of HFOV that have advanced our understanding of its mechanical properties. We identified 2 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 12 case series evaluating HFOV in adults with ARDS. In these studies, HFOV appears to be safe and consistently improves oxygenation when used as a rescue mode of ventilation in patients with severe ARDS. The two RCTs comparing HFOV to conventional ventilation revealed encouraging results but failed to show a mortality benefit of HFOV over conventional ventilation. Further research is needed to identify optimal patient selection, technique, the actual Vt delivered, and the role of combining HFOV with other interventions, such as recruitment maneuvers, prone positioning, and nitric oxide.","Chan, Kenneth P.W.; Stewart, Thomas E.; Mehta, Sangeeta",Chest,551,16

This created significant organizational challenges including numerous non-specialist ICU caregivers who came to work in the ICU. In this context, pragmatic protocols were essential to simplify nutritional care. We aimed at providing a simple and easy-to-prescribe nutritional protocol and evaluated its usefulness with questionnaires sent to physicians involved in the care of ICU COVID-19 patients. METHODS: A simplified nutrition protocol was distributed to all physicians (n = 122) of the ICU medical team during COVID-19 pandemic. Clinical dieticians estimated energy targets for acute and post-acute phases at patient's admission and suggested adaptations of nutrition therapy. More complex situations were discussed with clinical nutrition doctors and, if required, a clinical evaluation was performed. To further facilitate the procedure, a chart with prescription aids was also distributed to the whole medical ICU team. At the end of the current pandemic wave, a 13-item questionnaire was emailed to the ICU medical team to obtain their opinion on the suggested nutritional therapy. RESULTS: Answers were received from 81/122 medical doctors (MDs) (66% response rate), from intensive care physicians (41%), anaesthesiologists (53%) and MDs from other specialties (6%). Thirty-two percent of MDs felt that their knowledge of nutrition management was insufficient and 45% of the physicians surveyed did not face nutrition management in their daily practice prior to the pandemic. The initially proposed nutritional protocol, the chart with prescription aids and the suggested nutritional proposals were considered as useful to very useful by the majority of physicians surveyed (89.9, 90.7 and 92.1% respectively). The protocol was followed by 92% of MDs, and almost all participants (95%) were convinced that adaptations of nutritional therapy had beneficial effects on patients’ outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Nutritional therapy in critically ill COVID-19 patients is a challenge and the implementation of this specific pandemic simplified nutritional protocol was assessed as useful by a great majority of physicians. Pragmatic and simplified protocols are useful for ensuring the quality of nutritional therapy and could be used in future studies to assess its actual impact on the clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients.","de Watteville, Aude; Genton, Laurence; Barcelos, Gleicy Keli; Pugin, Jérôme; Pichard, Claude; Heidegger, Claudia Paula",Clin Nutr ESPEN,551,16

To date, published studies describe SGTA as a protein that is potentially critical in a range of biological processes, including viral infection, cell division, mitosis, and cell cycle checkpoint activation. SGTA interacts with the molecular chaperones, heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) and HSP90, and with steroid receptor complexes, including those containing the androgen receptor. Steroid receptors are critical for maintaining cell growth and differentiation in hormonally regulated tissues, such as male and female reproductive tissues, and also play a role in disease states involving these tissues. There is growing evidence that, through its interactions with chaperones and steroid receptors, SGTA may be a key player in the pathogenesis of hormonally influenced disease states, including prostate cancer and polycystic ovary syndrome. Research into the function of SGTA has been conducted in several model organisms and cell types, with these studies showing that SGTA functionality is cell-specific and tissue-specific. However, very few studies have been replicated in multiple cell types or experimental systems. Although a broad range of functions have been attributed to SGTA, there is a serious lack of mechanistic information to describe how SGTA acts. In this review, published evidence linking SGTA with hormonally regulated disease states is summarized and discussed, highlighting the need for future research to more clearly define the biological function(s) of this potentially important co-chaperone.

Two processes make markets and other economic systems more malleable during times of crises: (1) as the stasis of the market system is interrupted, it forces the system “into movement” - and it requires less effort to nudge an already moving system in a specific direction; and (2) as deeply-rooted mental models are challenged during crises, any market-shaping initiative which promises a credible end to current instability with a new equilibrium will appeal to the natural human craving for stability. This malleability, in turn, creates multiple opportunities for firms to shape their markets and hence drive the market's development in favorable directions.

AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of this study was to evaluate the presence PTSD in parents of children with T1D during COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In the period between March and May 2020 we submitted the “Impact of Event Scale – Revised” (IES-R) questionnaire to the parents of 34 children with Type 1 Diabetes, asking them to express their emotions about the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. RESULTS: A total of thirty mothers (mean age 43.0 ± 4.2 years) and 25 fathers (mean age 45.6 ± 5.9 years) participated in the survey and completed the questionnaires. 29.1% of parents had a score that allows to define a clinically relevant level of PTSD; ten mothers and 6 fathers had a PTSD clinically relevant score, corresponding, respectively, to 28.4 and 24% of total mothers and fathers. Finally, mothers and fathers, both express PTSD symptoms mainly in the form of intrusion and hyperarousal. CONCLUSIONS: The present study confirms a high prevalence symptoms related to PTSD in mothers and fathers of children with Type 1 Diabetes.

In 2013–2014, the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) outbreak led to $900 million to $1.8 billion in annual losses to US swine producers. Passive lactogenic immunity remains the most promising and effective way to protect neonatal suckling piglets from enteric diseases like PEDV. Protecting suckling piglets through lactogenic immunity is dependent on trafficking of pathogen-specific IgA plasmablasts to the mammary gland and accumulation of secretory IgA (sIgA) antibodies in milk, defined as the gut-mammary-sIgA axis. Due to an impermeable placenta, piglets are born agammaglobulinic, and are highly susceptible to a plethora of infectious agents. They rely solely on colostrum and milk antibodies for maternal lactogenic immunity. Previous advances in the development of live and attenuated vaccines for another devastating diarrheal virus of pigs, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), provide insights into the mechanisms of maternal immunity and piglet protection. In this chapter, we will review previous research on TGEV-induced lactogenic immunity to provide a historical perspective on current efforts for PEDV control and vaccines in the swine industry. Identifying factors that influence lactogenic immunity and the gut-mammary-sIgA axis may lead to improved vaccine regimens for PEDV and other enteric pathogens in gestating swine and improved overall herd immunity, swine health and industry productivity.","Langel, Stephanie N.; Paim, Francine Chimelo; Lager, Kelly M.; Vlasova, Anastasia N.; Saif, Linda J.",Virus Res,551,16

Atopy predisposes to infections of the target organ, i.e. the site of the allergic reaction. As allergic inflammation prepares the terrain for these infections, it is particularly important to fight against allergic inflammation by eliminating allergens and irritants from the atopic subject's environment. In some cases, topical anti-inflammatory drugs, such as cromoglycate or corticosteroids spray or ointment, must be used. Reciprocally, infections of the target organ accentuate atopic diseases by superimposing their specific inflammatory phenomena onto those of the allergic reaction, by amplifying this reaction and by creating hyperreactivity of the target organ. The possible role of Chlamydia pneumoniae infections in the pathogenesis of certain severe forms of chronic asthma could attribute a place to macrolides in the treatment or even the prophylaxis of asthma.","Radermecker, M.",Revue Française d'Allergologie et d'Immunologie Clinique,551,22

Spatiotemporal dynamics of viral infection impact nearly all aspects of the progression of a viral infection, like the dependence of viral replication rates on the type of cell and pathogen, the strength of the immune response and localization of infection. Mathematical modeling is often used to describe respiratory viral infections and the immune response to them using ordinary differential equation (ODE) models. However, ODE models neglect spatially-resolved biophysical mechanisms like lesion shape and the details of viral transport, and so cannot model spatial effects of a viral infection and immune response. In this work, we develop a multiscale, multicellular spatiotemporal model of influenza infection and immune response by combining non-spatial ODE modeling and spatial, cell-based modeling. We employ cellularization, a recently developed method for generating spatial, cell-based, stochastic models from non-spatial ODE models, to generate much of our model from a calibrated ODE model that describes infection, death and recovery of susceptible cells and innate and adaptive responses during influenza infection, and develop models of cell migration and other mechanisms not explicitly described by the ODE model. We determine new model parameters to generate agreement between the spatial and original ODE models under certain conditions, where simulation replicas using our model serve as microconfigurations of the ODE model, and compare results between the models to investigate the nature of viral exposure and impact of heterogeneous infection on the time-evolution of the viral infection. We found that using spatially homogeneous initial exposure conditions consistently with those employed during calibration of the ODE model generates far less severe infection, and that local exposure to virus must be multiple orders of magnitude greater than a uniformly applied exposure to all available susceptible cells. This strongly suggests a prominent role of localization of exposure in influenza A infection. We propose that the particularities of the microenvironment to which a virus is introduced plays a dominant role in disease onset and progression, and that spatially resolved models like ours may be important to better understand and more reliably predict future health states based on susceptibility of potential lesion sites using spatially resolved patient data of the state of an infection. We can readily integrate the immune response components of our model into other modeling and simulation frameworks of viral infection dynamics that do detailed modeling of other mechanisms like viral internalization and intracellular viral replication dynamics, which are not explicitly represented in the ODE model. We can also combine our model with available experimental data and modeling of exposure scenarios and spatiotemporal aspects of mechanisms like mucociliary clearance that are only implicitly described by the ODE model, which would significantly improve the ability of our model to present spatially resolved predictions about the progression of influenza infection and immune response.","Sego, T.J.; Mochan, Ericka D.; Bard Ermentrout, G.; Glazier, James A.",J Theor Biol,551,16

The purpose of this study was to understand the cost and benefit of adopting TG-CXR in quantifiable terms. METHODS: Portable or bedside radiographs are typically performed by a team of two technologists. The TG-CXR method has the benefit of allowing one technologist to stay outside of the patient room while operating the portable radiography machine, reducing PPE use, decreasing the frequency of radiography machine sanitization and decreasing technologists’ exposures to potentially infectious patients. The cost of implementing this technique during the current COVID-19 pandemic was obtained from our department's operational database. The direct cost of routinely used PPE and sanitization materials and the cost of the time taken by the technologists to clean the machine was used to form a quantitative picture of the benefit associated with TG-CXR technique. RESULTS: Technologists were trained on the TG-CXR method during a 15 min shift change briefing. This translated to a one-time cost of $424.88 USD. There was an average reduction of portable radiography machine downtime of 4 min and 48 s per study. The benefit of adopting the TG-CXR technique was $9.87 USD per patient imaged. This will result in a projected net cost savings of $51,451.84 USD per annum. CONCLUSION: Adoption of the TG-CXR technique during the COVID-19 pandemic involved minimal one-time cost, but is projected to result in a net-benefit of over $51,000 USD per annum in our emergency department.","Liu, Tian Yang; Rai, Archana; Ditkofsky, Noah; Deva, Djeven P.; Dowdell, Timothy R.; Ackery, Alun Duncan; Mathur, Shobhit",J Med Imaging Radiat Sci,551,20

The etiological agent of COVID-19, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), exhibits neurotropism for central and peripheral nervous systems. Various infective mechanisms and paths can be exploited by the virus to reach the central nervous system, some of which bypass the blood–brain barrier; others alter its integrity. Numerous studies have established beyond doubt that the membrane-bound metalloprotease angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) performs the role of SARS-CoV-2 host-cell receptor. Histochemical studies and more recently transcriptomics of mRNA have dissected the cellular localization of the ACE2 enzyme in various tissues, including the central nervous system. Epithelial cells lining the nasal mucosae, the upper respiratory tract, and the oral cavity, bronchoalveolar cells type II in the pulmonary parenchyma, and intestinal enterocytes display ACE2 binding sites at their cell surfaces, making these epithelial mucosae the most likely viral entry points. Neuronal and glial cells and endothelial cells in the central nervous system also express ACE2. This short review analyzes the known entry points and routes followed by the SARS-CoV-2 to reach the central nervous system and postulates new hypothetical pathways stemming from the enterocytes lining the intestinal lumen.","Barrantes, Francisco J.",ACS Chem Neurosci,551,1

Therefore, it is imperative to develop novel, accurate, affordable, and easily accessible assays/sensors to diagnose and isolate COVID-19 cases. To address this unmet need, we utilized the catalytic potential of peroxidase-like DNAzyme and developed a simple visual detection assay for SARS-CoV-2 RNA using a conventional thermal cycler by the PCR-induced generation of DNAzyme sensor. The performance of RT-PCR DNAzyme-based sensor was comparable to that of real-time PCR. The pilot scale validation of RT-PCR DNAzyme-based sensor has shown ~100% sensitivity and specificity in clinical specimens (nasopharyngeal swab, n = 34), with a good correlation (Spearman r = 0.799) with the Ct-value of fluorescence probe-based real-time PCR.

According to the data of April 22nd, 2020, more than 4.6 million people have been screened, in which the infection has made more than 2.7 million people positive, in which 182,740 people have died due to infection. More than 80 countries have closed their borders from transitioning countries, ordered businesses to close, instructed their populations to self-quarantine, and closed schools to an estimated 1.5 billion children. The world’s top ten economies such as the United States, China, Japan, Germany, United Kingdom, France, India, Italy, Brazil, and Canada stand on the verge of complete collapse. In addition, stock markets around the world have been pounded, and tax revenue sources have fallen off a cliff. The epidemic due to infection is having a noticeable impact on global economic development. It is estimated that by now the virus could exceed global economic growth by more than 2.0% per month if the current situation persists. Global trade may also fall from 13 to 32% depending on the depth and extent of the global economic slowdown. The full impact will not be known until the effects of the epidemic occurred.

This review examines the current literature on COVID-19-induced myositis focusing on etiopathogenesis, clinical presentations, diagnostic practices, and therapeutic challenges with immunosuppression, and the difficulties experienced by rheumatologists in established myositis in the COVID-19 era. RECENT FINDINGS: COVID-19 is associated with a viral myositis attributable to direct myocyte invasion or induction of autoimmunity. COVID-19-induced myositis may be varied in presentation, from typical dermatomyositis to rhabdomyolysis, and a paraspinal affliction with back pain. It may or may not present with acute exponential elevations of enzyme markers such as creatine kinase (CK). Virus-mediated muscle inflammation is attributed to ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme) receptor–mediated direct entry and affliction of muscle fibers, leading on to innate and adaptive immune activation. A greater recognition of the stark similarity between anti-MDA5-positive myositis with COVID-19 has thrown researchers into the alley of exploration — finding common etiopathogenic basis as well as therapeutic strategies. For patients with established myositis, chronic care was disrupted during the pandemic with several logistic challenges and treatment dilemmas leading to high flare rates. Teleconsultation bridged the gap while ushering in an era of patient-led care with the digital transition to tools of remote disease assessment. SUMMARY: COVID-19 has brought along greater insight into unique manifestations of COVID-19-related myositis, ranging from direct virus-induced muscle disease to triggered autoimmunity and other etiopathogenic links to explore. A remarkable shift in the means of delivering chronic care has led patients and caregivers worldwide to embrace a virtual shift with teleconsultation and opened doorways to a new era of patient-led care.","Saud, Ahmad; Naveen, R; Aggarwal, Rohit; Gupta, Latika",Curr Rheumatol Rep,551,5

Alcohol is often used as a coping mechanism and there are public health concerns regarding excessive consumption due to the pandemic. We aimed to longitudinally assess drinking behaviors, and associated factors, during the first UK government-mandated lockdown. METHODS An online survey was distributed through social media (8th April 2020, onwards). Fortnightly follow up surveys were emailed to participants. The primary outcome measure was 'weekly unit consumption' and data was collected on a range of potentially related factors: demographics, factors relating to COVID-19 (e.g., health, work status), drinking motives, context of drinking, drinking intentions, mood, depression and anxiety. FINDINGS A total of 539 self-selected participants completed the baseline survey, with 186 completing at least 3 follow up surveys for multilevel modelling analysis. Personal coping motives, anxiety, drinking at home alone, and drinking at home with others were positively associated with alcohol consumption during lockdown. The following baseline measures also predicted increased consumption: male gender, lower education, and higher AUDIT scores (based on behavior prior to lockdown). Findings were consistent when utilizing an inverse probability weight to account for predictors of attrition (female, younger age, higher baseline AUDIT scores). CONCLUSIONS Those already drinking at hazardous levels were more likely to increase their consumption, as were those who were drinking to cope. As we recover from the pandemic, there is a need for widespread alcohol support, and certain groups may need targeted support.","Irizar, Patricia; Jones, Andrew; Christiansen, Paul; Goodwin, Laura; Gage, Suzanne; Roberts, Carl; Knibb, Graeme; Cooke, Richard; Rose, Abigail K",Drug and alcohol dependence,551,16

This study was carried out to early assess students' sources of information, perceived risk of infection, knowledge and preventive practices in order to resume academic activity. The impact of training and volunteer work was also assessed. METHODS A cross-sectional online survey was conducted in May 2020 among medical students enrolled in the School of Medicine and Surgery, Bologna University. RESULTS The analysis included 537 responses. On average students used seven sources of information on COVID-19. Scientific journals were considered the most trustworthy but they ranked only 6th in the frequency of use. Perceived risk of infection was higher for academic activities, especially in the hospital than daily living activities. Less than 50% of students reported being trained on biological risk and use of PPE. Training received was significantly associated with both perceived risk of infection and confidence in the use of PPE. Students engaged in volunteer work had higher confidence in PPE usage. INTERPRETATION Accessible scientific information and students' engagement in spreading correct knowledge play an important role in challenging misinformation during the pandemic crisis. Students showed suboptimal knowledge about PPE use, calling for additional training. We found a moderate-high perceived risk of infection that could be mitigated with specific educational programs and by promoting voluntary work. Students' engagement in public health emergencies (PHE) could potentially be beneficial for their training and as well as for the healthcare system.","Greco, M.; Maietti, E.; Savoia, E.; Trere, D.; Reno, C.; Rallo, F.; Fantini, M.

The experiences of 18 family medicine practices were explored and opportunities to improve ENDS cessation were co-created in this study. METHODS: Eighteen family medicine practices were enrolled into an implementation project to incorporate ENDS cessation into their practice. The participants’ experiences were explored throughout the project using an iterative qualitative approach. The research team provided technical assistance. Semi-structured group interviews and focus groups were held with participants at the beginning, middle, and end of the project to explore participants’ experiences. The collective knowledge and experiences of participants, expert consultants and the research team were fused together to co-create opportunities to improve ENDS cessation. RESULTS: Nine opportunities to improve ENDS cessation were identified in three larger categories. The first category was leading change. This included: creating a vision for change to establish buy-in from key stakeholders and educate health care professionals to improve their confidence to address ENDS. The second category was creating processes. This included: establishing criteria for screening and quality improvement for ENDS cessation; being specific when asking about ENDS; creating electronic health record systems to support incorporating ENDS cessation; using chart audits if electronic health records cannot support incorporating ENDS into tobacco cessation; and assigning roles and responsibilities to members of the clinical care team. The third category was assisting patients who use ENDS. This included: educating patients and their parents/caregivers about ENDS and their potential harms, avoiding dual use, and developing a plan to quit. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights challenges and opportunities for incorporating ENDS cessation into family medicine. The opportunities outlined here provide a practical approach which is rooted in the experiences of family physicians and their clinical care teams working to improve how they address ENDS and based on peer reviewed literature and expert input. Improving how ENDS are addressed in family medicine will require more than clinical expertise. It will also require leadership skills and the ability to create process improvements.

The purpose of this paper is to establish service industries as increasingly significant aspects of urban development within the Asia-Pacific, and to propose a conceptual and analytical framework for scholarly investigation within this important research domain. To this end the paper explores a sequence of related themes and issues, concerning the larger developmental implications of urban services growth (or tertiarization), the facets of urban transformation associated with tertiarization, and a preliminary typology of urban service functions which acknowledges the rich diversity of service vocations and stages of development within the Asia-Pacific. The paper concludes that “advanced services”—specialized, intermediate service industries, advanced-technology services, and creative service industries—will be quite crucial to the development of city-regions within the Asia-Pacific, with respect to employment growth and human capital formation, to the urban economic (or export) base, to the operation of flexible production systems, and to competitive advantage. The development of these urban service poles will require innovative policy commitments and regulatory adjustments, as will the multi-centred specialized urban service corridors which function as engines of regional economic growth, and which provide platforms for national modernization and responses to the pressures (and opportunities) of globalization. To date, urban and regional development strategies for service industries within the Asia-Pacific have privileged globalization, industrial restructuring, and modernization aims, but there is also an encouraging record of more progressive planning experimentation in some jurisdictions, incorporating principles of sustainability and co-operative development. There is also increasing interest in policies to support cultural and creative industries among Asia-Pacific city-regions, informed by some recent urban policy experimentation in this domain. These experiences can offer models for further policy and programmatic innovation in the 21st century, as service industries continue to play larger roles in urban and regional development within the Asia-Pacific.","Hutton, Thomas A",Prog Plann,551,14

These problems can lead to psychological problems. Therefore, the aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis to ascertain the present impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the prevalence of stress, anxiety, depression and sleep disturbance among nurses. METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted. The following databases were searched: PubMed, CHINAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, MedRxiv and Google Scholar, from January 2020 up to 26th October 2020. Prevalence rates were pooled with meta-analysis using a random-effects model. Heterogeneity was tested using I-squared (I(2)) statistics. RESULTS: A total of 93 studies (n = 93,112), published between January 2020 and September 2020, met the inclusion criteria. The overall prevalence of stress was assessed in 40 studies which accounted for 43% (95% CI 37–49). The pooled prevalence of anxiety was 37% (95% CI 32–41) in 73 studies. Depression was assessed in 62 studies, with a pooled prevalence of 35% (95% CI 31–39). Finally, 18 studies assessed sleep disturbance and the pooled prevalence was 43% (95% CI 36–50). CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis found that approximately one third of nurses working during the COVID-19 epidemic were suffering from psychological symptoms. This highlights the importance of providing comprehensive support strategies to reduce the psychological impact of the COVID-19 outbreak among nurses under pandemic conditions. Further longitudinal study is needed to distinguish of psychological symptoms during and after the infectious disease outbreaks.","Al Maqbali, Mohammed; Al Sinani, Mohammed; Al-Lenjawi, Badriya",J Psychosom Res,551,21

We aimed to collect information on psychologically distressing experiences of Italians living in quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: From 6 to 20 April 2020 participants filled out an online questionnaire. Demographic and physical symptoms data from the prior 14 days of quarantine were collected. Psychological impact of quarantine was assessed by the COVID-19 Peritraumatic Distress Index (CPDI). RESULTS: In all, 20,158 participants completed the online survey. Of these, 11,910 (59.1%) were from Lombardy, the region with 37.7% of positive cases identified during the survey period. 30.1% of responders were male. About half (55.9%) of responders were 18–50 years old, 54.3% had a tertiary level of education, 69.5% were workers, 84.1% were living in houses with ≥3 rooms, and 13.7% were living alone. 9.7% had had contact with COVID-19 positive people. Of all responders, 9978 (48.6%) reported a psychological impact, 8897 (43.4%) of whom reported mild or moderate and 1081 (5.2%) severe psychological impact. The multivariate analysis, after adjustments, showed that an increasing CPDI score was associated with gender (female), first-second educational level, being unemployed, living in a ≤2 room house, having had new health problems during the previous 14 days, and not having been out of the house in the previous week. Concerning the type of psychological distress, 2003 responders (9.9%) reported moderate to severe depressive symptoms, 1131 (5.5%) moderate to severe anxiety symptoms, and 802 (3.9%) moderate to severe physical symptoms. A positive correlation was found between responder rate (per 10.000 residents) and positive COVID-19 cases (per 10.000 residents) by region (r(s) = + 0.83, p = < 0.0001), and between responder rate and region latitude (r(s) = + 0.91, p = < 0.0001), with a greater response rate in the north. Considering Lombardy Region responders, a negative correlation between CPDI score and distance from place of residence to the red zone (Nembro-Alzano) was found. Higher prevalence of psychological distress was found up to 25 km away from the red zone and, in particular, severe distress up to 15 km. CONCLUSIONS: Policy makers and mental health professionals should be aware of quarantine’s adverse mental health consequences. Factors influencing the success of quarantine and infection control practices for both disease containment and community recovery should be identified and additional support to vulnerable persons at increased risk of adverse psychological and social consequences of quarantine should be guaranteed.

Many schizophrenic patients were infected with COVID-19 in Wuhan City, Hubei Province. This study took hospitalized schizophrenia patients with COVID-19 as the research subjects and observed the changes in psychopathology and stress of patients with COVID-19 and the accompanying social isolation. Methods: To sort and isolate potential COVID-19-infected patients, an isolated ward was set up from January 30, 2020, to March 30, 2020. Schizophrenia patients with COVID-19 were referred to this ward, and long-term hospitalized cases were included in this study. The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale and Perceived Stress Scale were used to evaluate the severity of mental symptoms and psychological stress in the early stage of the outbreak of COVID-19, after the diagnosis of COVID-19 and after recovery. At the time of diagnosis, we also extracted the patient's routine blood, biochemical and other indicators and asked the patient's perception of COVID-19. Results: 21 hospitalized schizophrenia patients with COVID-19 were recruited in this study. The changes in PANSS scores were not significant (p = 0.225 baseline vs. diagnosed, p = 0.399 cured vs. diagnosed). The CPSS scores increased significantly after diagnosis and transfer to the isolation ward (p < 0.001 baseline vs. diagnosed, p < 0.001 cured vs. diagnosed). The course of schizophrenia was a protective factor of stress levels to cases (t = −3.25, p = 0.006), and patients' perception of COVID-19 was a risk factor (t = 2.48, p = 0.038). The final multiple linear regression model was statistically significant (F = 8.16, p < 0.001). Conclusion: Hospitalized schizophrenia patients with COVID-19 had increased stress levels and negative symptoms but alleviated positive symptoms after medical isolated treatment. This reminds us that in the face of major epidemics, we must specifically alleviate the psychological burden at the peak of the epidemic and improve the prognosis of patients after the epidemic.","Ma, Jun; Jiang, Tao; Huang, Hanjun; Li, Ruihua; Zhang, Lin; Liu, Lianzhong; Liu, Xuebing",Front Psychiatry,551,5

Cell entry of SARS-CoV-2 mainly depends on binding of the viral spike (S) proteins to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on host cells. Therefore, repurposing of known drugs to inhibit S protein-ACE2 interaction could be a quick way to develop effective therapy for COVID-19. Using a high-throughput screening system to investigate the interaction between spike receptor binding domain (S-RBD) and ACE2 extracellular domain, we screened 3581 FDA-approved drugs and natural small molecules and identified ceftazidime as a potent compound to inhibit S-RBD–ACE2 interaction by binding to S-RBD. In addition to significantly inhibit S-RBD binding to HPAEpiC cells, ceftazidime efficiently prevented SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus to infect ACE2-expressing 293T cells. The inhibitory concentration (IC50) was 113.2 μM, which is far below the blood concentration (over 300 μM) of ceftazidime in patients when clinically treated with recommended dose. Notably, ceftazidime is a drug clinically used for the treatment of pneumonia with minimal side effects compared with other antiviral drugs. Thus, ceftazidime has both anti-bacterial and anti-SARS-CoV-2 effects, which should be the first-line antibiotics used for the clinical treatment of COVID-19.","Lin, ChangDong; Li, Yue; Yuan, MengYa; Huang, MengWen; Liu, Cui; Du, Hui; Pan, XingChao; Wen, YaTing; Xu, Xinyi; Xu, Chenqi; Chen, JianFeng",bioRxiv,551,26

Controlling the rapidly evolving disease requires highly sensitive and specific diagnostics. While RT-PCR is the most commonly used, it can take up to eight hours, and requires significant effort from healthcare professionals. As such, there is a critical need for a quick and automatic diagnostic system. Diagnosis from chest CT images is a promising direction. However, current studies are limited by the lack of sufficient training samples, as acquiring annotated CT images is time-consuming. To this end, we propose a new deep learning algorithm for the automated diagnosis of COVID-19, which only requires a few samples for training. Specifically, we use contrastive learning to train an encoder which can capture expressive feature representations on large and publicly available lung datasets and adopt the prototypical network for classification. We validate the efficacy of the proposed model in comparison with other competing methods on two publicly available and annotated COVID-19 CT datasets. Our results demonstrate the superior performance of our model for the accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 based on chest CT images.","Chen, Xiaocong; Yao, Lina; Zhou, Tao; Dong, Jinming; Zhang, Yu",Pattern Recognit,551,24

The swiftly rising of positive cases globally created panic, anxiety and depression among people. The effect of this deadly disease was found to be directly proportional to the physical and mental health of the population. As of 28 October 2020, more than 40 million people are tested positive and more than 1 million deaths have been recorded. The most dominant tool that disturbed human life during this time is social media. The tweets regarding COVID-19, whether it was a number of positive cases or deaths, induced a wave of fear and anxiety among people living in different parts of the world. Nobody can deny the truth that social media is everywhere and everybody is connected with it directly or indirectly. This offers an opportunity for researchers and data scientists to access the data for academic and research use. The social media data contains many data that relate to real-life events like COVID-19. In this paper, an analysis of Twitter data has been done through the R programming language. We have collected the Twitter data based on hashtag keywords, including COVID-19, coronavirus, deaths, new case, recovered. In this study, we have designed an algorithm called Hybrid Heterogeneous Support Vector Machine (H-SVM) and performed the sentiment classification and classified them positive, negative and neutral sentiment scores.

Limited progress has been made since the formulation of the World Health Organisation (WHO) Global Strategy in 2010. WHO is seeking to accelerate progress in implementing international efforts to reduce the harmful use of alcohol. The threat to global health posed by tobacco is well understood by policy communities and populations globally; by contrast alcohol is much less so, despite available evidence. THE COMPETITION FOR EPISTEMIC AUTHORITY: Global alcohol corporations have sought to become trusted sources of advice for policy makers and consumers, while continuing to grow their markets. Evidence-informed public health messaging faces formidable competition from transnational corporations as the worlds of corporate and political communications, social and mainstream media become increasingly linked, presenting new opportunities for corporate actors to shape global health governance. Alcohol messaging that uses means of persuasion tied to industry agendas does not tell a clear story about commercial determinants of health, and does not contribute to health improvement. On the contrary, the basic tenets of an evidence-informed population-based approach are denied and the policy measures supported by high quality evidence are being opposed, because they are inimical to commercial interests. A David and Goliath metaphor for this state of affairs, which seems to fit at first glance, may unwittingly reinforce the status quo. CONCLUSION: Public opinion on alcohol and policy issues varies across time and place and can be influenced by dedicated public health interventions. Alcohol marketing dominates people’s thinking about alcohol because we currently allow this to happen. Greater ambition is needed in developing countermarketing and other interventions to promote evidence-informed ideas with the public. Alcohol policies need to be further developed, and implemented more widely, in order to arrest the growing burden of alcohol harms across the world.","Madden, Mary; McCambridge, Jim",Global Health,551,12

Over the next two years as more approved vaccines are made available and supply meets or exceeds demand, medical and public health professionals will increasingly be faced with the challenge of vaccine hesitancy. There is an urgent need to create demand in groups that are either uninformed, vaccine hesitant, or actively resistant to COVID-19 vaccination. This study reviews theory, evidence, and practice recommendations to develop a vaccine demand creation strategy that has wide applicability. Specifically, we focus on key elements including supply side confidence, vaccine brand promotion strategy, service marketing as it relates to vaccine distribution, and competition strategy. We present evidence that these strategies can make a significant contribution to overcoming COVID-19 hesitancy in a high supply scenario. The paper also makes recommendations about factors that need to be considered in relation to vaccine delivery services and systems that, if done badly, may reduce uptake or result in the creation of more vaccine hesitancy. In summary, there is a need for well researched and tested demand creation strategies that integrate with brand strategy, supply side, and service delivery.","Evans, William Douglas; French, Jeff",Vaccines (Basel),551,23

METHODS: Patients who underwent emergency surgery between the pandemic period of March 14th to May 15th 2020 and within the same period from the previous year were reviewed retrospectively. COVID-19 incidence in patients and health professionals working in the general surgery department during these periods was questioned. RESULTS: Demographic data were similar between the two time periods. The number of patients who underwent surgery in the pandemic group (n = 103) was lower than the control group (n = 252). There was a 59.1% reduction in emergency surgeries. The biggest decreases were the admissions of incarcerated hernia, uncomplicated appendicitis and acute cholecystitis (92%, 81.3%, 47.3%, respectively). During the pandemic, an increase was of patient rates who underwent surgery for complicated appendicitis and AMIO (p = 0.001, p = 0.019, respectively). The rate of mortality was higher in patients who underwent emergency surgery during pandemic (p = 0.049). The results of COVID-19 screening were positive in 6 (6/103, 5.82%) patients undergoing emergency surgery. None of the doctors working in the ward were infected with COVID-19 infection (0/20). The screening tests were positive in only two nurses working on the ward (2/24, 8.33%). CONCLUSION: In this and similar pandemics, we suggest that a new algorithm is necessary to approach emergencies and the results of this study can contribute to that end.","Surek, Ahmet; Ferahman, Sina; Gemici, Eyup; Dural, Ahmet Cem; Donmez, Turgut; Karabulut, Mehmet",Eur J Trauma Emerg Surg,551,26

It is considered the training center for healthcare professions in the region, as the Jordanian healthcare sector has seen remarkable development. In 2017, the expenditure on health as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was estimated to be around 8%. The healthcare sector is divided into two main sectors; the public and the private sector with both including hospitals, primary care clinics and pharmacies. The Jordanian government has a strong commitment to health and educational programs; hence, an increase in the number of pharmacy schools and pharmacy graduates has occurred in the past few years. Health authorities, such as the Jordan Food and Drug Association (JFDA) and the Jordan Pharmaceutical Association (JPA) have played an important role in ensuring the availability and affordability of medications, and has influenced the practice of pharmacists. Protecting the pharmaceutical market and professional interests, preserving pharmacists’ rights, building needed cooperation with the internal federation, and maintaining professional ethics are some of the objectives for the JPA. Hence, the integration of community pharmacists into the primary healthcare system is considered vital to the different health authorities in Jordan, emphasizing the fact that community pharmacists are the most trusted, accessible, and affordable healthcare providers in the country.

The cytokine components of this environment may determine efficacy or otherwise of glucocorticoid therapy. The immunity modulators, the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and the nuclear NAD(+)-consuming enzyme poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP 1) may play a critical role in COVID-19 pathophysiology. The AhR is overexpressed in coronaviruses, including COVID-19 and, as it regulates PARP gene expression, the latter is likely to be activated in COVID-19. PARP 1 activation leads to cell death mainly by depletion of NAD(+) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), especially when availability of these energy mediators is compromised. PARP expression is enhanced in other lung conditions: the pneumovirus respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). I propose that PARP 1 activation is the terminal point in a sequence of events culminating in patient mortality and should be the focus of COVID-19 immunotherapy. Potent PARP 1 inhibitors are undergoing trials in cancer, but a readily available inhibitor, nicotinamide (NAM), which possesses a highly desirable biochemical and activity profile, merits exploration. It conserves NAD(+) and prevents ATP depletion by PARP 1 and Sirtuin 1 (silent mating type information regulation 2 homologue 1) inhibition, enhances NAD(+) synthesis, and hence that of NADP(+) which is a stronger PARP inhibitor, reverses lung injury caused by ischaemia/reperfusion, inhibits proinflammatory cytokines and is effective against HIV infection. These properties qualify NAM for therapeutic use initially in conjunction with standard clinical care or combined with other agents, and subsequently as an adjunct to stronger PARP 1 inhibitors or other drugs.","Badawy, Abdulla A.-B.",Biosci Rep,551,16

During her most recent inpatient admission, she was treated with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for catatonia. Our treatment team was hopeful that ECT was making a difference for this patient. However, she was only able to receive two sessions of treatment due to new hospital protocols related to the coronavirus pandemic. Although the patient was not suspected to have the coronavirus, she could no longer undergo ventilation with a bag and mask during the procedure. Bag–mask ventilation is known to aerosolise the coronavirus and other diseases and potentially put healthcare workers at risk. Although orotracheal intubation also aerosolises the coronavirus, this was the only means of airway management still allowed by anaesthesia providers at this time. Our psychiatry team estimated that the risks of intubation outweighed the benefits of treatment, and ECT was cancelled. Without additional ECT treatments, the patient again decompensated for several weeks before being stabilised on clozapine, haloperidol and lorazepam. Although she eventually had a positive treatment outcome, her hospital course was likely prolonged due to unforeseen events related to the novel coronavirus. We feel that the current medical climate is unprecedented and is interfering with necessary psychiatric treatment in an unanticipated way.

Results: We observed a marked increase in the incidence of type 1 diabetes in the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, with 16.9%, from 11.4/100,000 in 2019 to 13.3/100,000 in 2020, much higher compared to previous years (mean yearly increase was 5.1% in the period 1996–2015 and 0.8% in the interval 2015–2019). The proportion of newly diagnosed cases was significantly higher in the second half of 2020 compared to the second half of the previous years (57.8 vs. 51%, p < 0.0001). Conclusions: All these aspects suggest the role that SARS-CoV-2 could have in triggering pancreatic autoimmunity. To confirm this, however, collecting information from larger populations from different geographical regions, monitoring the incidence curves over a period of several years, and gathering background information on COVID-19 and/or data on COVID-19 specific antibodies are needed.","Vlad, Adrian; Serban, Viorel; Timar, Romulus; Sima, Alexandra; Botea, Veronica; Albai, Oana; Timar, Bogdan; Vlad, Mihaela",Medicina (Kaunas),551,16

This study is the first in the world about the psychological status of the medical team during the COVID-19 outbreak. Objective: To study the correlation between risk factors and general symptom index (GSI) score of medical team members who support Wuhan against COVID-19. Design: Cohort study. Setting: Population-based. Participants: Anhui Province sent a total of eight medical teams,including 1382 members,to support Hubei Province. We adopted a stratified sampling method and selected the fourth team sent by Anhui Provincial Hospital, with a total of 137 members as our subjects. Exposures: Four main exposures were collected, including basic information, preparations before going to Wuhan, life issues and working issues after going to Wuhan. Main Outcomes and Measures: The GSI score of SCL-90 scale was used to reflect the frequency and intensity of psychological symptoms. We made the hypothesis of this study before data collection. Results: 110(80.29%) members completed the questionnaire, of which, 77(70.00%) female and 33(30.00%) male. When adjusted age, gender and covariates, DC, LCWT had a positive correlations with GSI score(beta was 10.17, 95%CI was 3.30 to 17.04 for DC, P=0.00<0.05;beta was 11.55, 95%CI was 0.40 to 22.71 for LCWT, P =0.04<0.05;respectively), RBT had a negative positive correlation with GSI score (beta was -28.09, 95%CI was -45.79 to -10.40, P=0.00<0.05), AoBI did not had a correlation with GSI score (beta was 11.55, 95%CI was 0.40 to 22.71, P=0.16>0.05). When adjusted covariates, DC had a positive and RBT had a negative correlation with GSI score of female (beta was 13.20, 95%CI was 4.55 to 21.85, P=0.00<0.05; beta was -57.85, 95%CI was -94.52 to -21.18, P=0.00<0.05; respectively), but for male was not (P=0.59>0.05, P=0.08>0.05, respectively), LCWT and AoBI didn't had correlation with GSI score between genders (P>0.05). Conclusions and Relevance: Improving DC, RBT and decreasing LCWT can reduce the GSI score. AoBI didn't affect the psychological status; male members have a more stable mood than female. Whether other countries medical team has the same result still needs further research.","Cheng, W.; Zhaohui, L.; Jingquan, W.; Xiaolei, J.; Yunyun, F.; Yanlin, W.; Jinlong, Z.",,551,21

This study analyzed the COVID-19 deferrals of blood volunteers and compared the demographics, deferrals, and the donor status during the COVID-19 outbreak in 2019. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Data were collected from the integrated blood donor database between Feb-Apr 2019 and 2020. Deferral reasons of COVID-19 were categorized as: those who have symptoms or live with a symptomatic family member, have direct exposure with a confirmed case, have travelled from the outbreak affected areas, and have fully recovered from confirmed COVID-19. The z-test analysis was used, and 95 % confidence intervals were calculated to compare the sample proportions. RESULTS: The blood donations dropped to 26.09 % in 2020. The percent change of first-time blood donors, female donors, and donors within the age group of 45−54 years old was significantly greater in 2020 than the same time frame in 2019 (p < 0.05). The results showed that 0.58 % of volunteers were deferred from blood donation to avoid transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The rate of COVID-19 deferrals in all types except travelling to affected areas has increased in the second 30-day of the study (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The blood shortage that occurred during the COVID-19 outbreak was not due to increased deferral for COVID-19, but it was mostly due to a decrease in the number of volunteers who referred to BTCs.","Rafiee, Mohammad Hessam; Kafiabad, Sedigheh Amini; Maghsudlu, Mahtab",Transfus Apher Sci,551,18

METHODS: This is a prospective observational study involving pediatric patients with epilepsy with neurocognitive and emotional comorbidities. Included patients were admitted to our hospital between August 2019 and February 2020 for epilepsy and neuropsychiatric assessment, and Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) questionnaires were filled in by parents. Those patients and their families accepted to participate in a phone follow-up visit in April–May 2020 and to refill CBCL and Parenting Stress Index–Short Form (PSI-SF) questionnaires. Descriptive statistics for demographic and clinical data, CBCL questionnaire scores before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, and PSI-SF scores have been computed. Moreover, results of a short phone survey on the psychological burden during COVID lockdown have been reported. RESULTS: This study provides the parental-proxy report of emotional and behavioral profile changes of 23 pediatric patients with epilepsy and neurocognitive and emotional comorbidities during the COVID-19 pandemic. Concerns for therapy monitoring at the time of lockdown emerged in 43% of families, and 30% of patients showed worries for an altered contact with the referring medical team. Patients with neurocognitive comorbidities were more likely to exhibit behavioral problems, especially externalizing problems compared with patients with a diagnosis of anxiety/depression. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest the importance to monitor disease trajectory and behavior and affective symptoms with telehealth strategies to provide effective care to patients and their families.","Pasca, Ludovica; Zanaboni, Martina Paola; Grumi, Serena; Totaro, Martina; Ballante, Elena; Varesio, Costanza; De Giorgis, Valentina",Epilepsy Behav,551,12

Data on rifampicin resistance (RR), which is a surrogate marker for multidrug resistance, are limited among Ethiopian tuberculosis patients. This study aimed to determine the magnitude of rifampicin-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (RR-MTB) among presumptive tuberculosis patients attending St. Peter Tuberculosis Specialized Hospital, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted at St. Peter Tuberculosis Specialized Hospital from January 2016 to December 2018. After checking completeness of the necessary information, data of tuberculosis-presumptive cases who underwent Gene Xpert(®) testing were collected from medical records using a data-extraction format prepared for this study purpose. Data were double entered and analyzed using SPSS version 20 statistical software. RESULTS: A total of 12,685 presumptive tuberculosis patients were included; of whom 54.5% were males and the mean age of the study participants was 40.3±18.7 years. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) was detected in 1714 participants (13.5%). Of these MTB cases, 169 cases (9.8%) were confirmed to have RR-MTB. Prevalence of MTB was relatively higher among males (15.1%, P=0.78); whereas RR-MTB was higher among females (10.3%, P=0.81). The incidence of MTB and RR-MTB was significantly associated with treatment history (P=0.042 and P=0.025), respectively. HIV infection has significantly associated with incidence of RR-MTB (P=0.032), but not with MTB (P˃0.05). Prevalence of MTB and RR-MTB had a declining trend through time, being 16.7% and 12.9%, 12.8% and 9.1%, and 12.2% and 7.9% in 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively. CONCLUSION: This study showed a decreasing trend of both MTB and RR-MTB from 2016 to 2018 in an MTB, MDR-MTB, and TB/HIV co-infection high-burden setting, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Occurrence of MTB and RR-MTB was associated with treatment history. Therefore, improvement in treatment adherence of identified cases would be helpful to prevent emergence or re-emergence of MTB and RR-MTB cases.","Araya, Shambel; Negesso, Abebe Edao; Tamir, Zemenu",Infect Drug Resist,551,20

This study compared two versions—emergency remote teaching (ERT) and conventional face-to-face class (FFC)—of a course design based on the instructional design ARCS model for effectiveness and issues. The current study comprised 46 third-year nursing students who attended an FFC course in 2019, and 56 third-year students who took the ERT version in 2020. Students’ self-rated goal attainment and knowledge of genetics scores were compared before and after taking the courses. Scores between the two class types were compared using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. The students’ worksheets were evaluated using keyword frequency and content analyses. Both classes achieved their goals satisfactorily, and this study confirmed that for this course, ERT was as effective as FFC. A comparison of the increase in domain goal attainment scores per student showed that only the psychomotor domain item, “I can fully explain human diversity using genomic information”, was significantly different, as it was significantly higher for ERT (p = 0.003). This higher item in the ERT group suggests that ERT can pose a lack of practice caution in acquiring nursing skills.","Kawasaki, Hiromi; Yamasaki, Satoko; Masuoka, Yuko; Iwasa, Mika; Fukita, Susumu; Matsuyama, Ryota",Int J Environ Res Public Health,551,16

The purpose of this study was to understand patients’ perspectives on how the side effects of CIM are managed in routine clinical practice. METHODS: An online survey was conducted of participants with breast, lung, or colorectal cancer who had received chemotherapy treatment within the past 12 months, and had experienced at least one episode of myelosuppression in the past year. The survey was administered with predominantly close-ended questions, and lay definitions of key terms were provided to aid response selection. RESULTS: Of 301 participants who completed the online survey, 153 (51%) had breast cancer, 100 (33%) had lung cancer, and 48 (16%) had colorectal cancer. Anemia, neutropenia, lymphopenia, and thrombocytopenia were reported by 61%, 59%, 37%, and 34% of participants, respectively. Most participants (79%) reported having received treatment for CIM, and 64% of participants recalled chemotherapy dose modifications as a result of CIM. Although most participants believed their oncologist was aware of the side effects of CIM, and treated them quickly, 30% of participants felt their oncologists did not understand how uncomfortable they were due to the side effects of CIM. Overall, 88% of participants considered CIM to have a moderate or major impact on their lives. CONCLUSION: The data highlight that despite the various methods used to address CIM, and the patient-focused approach of oncologists, the real-world impact of CIM on patients is substantial. Improving communication between patients and health care providers may help improve patients’ understanding of CIM, and foster shared decision-making in terms of treatment. Additional insights from patients should be obtained to further elucidate the totality of life burden associated with CIM.","Epstein, Robert S.; Aapro, Matti S.; Basu Roy, Upal K.; Salimi, Tehseen; Krenitsky, JoAnn; Leone-Perkins, Megan L.; Girman, Cynthia; Schlusser, Courtney; Crawford, Jeffrey",Adv Ther,551,13

This study examined the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities of the extracts from the flower buds of these two species. The extracts were obtained by three extraction methods: water extraction, ethanol extraction, and supercritical-CO(2) fluid extraction (SFE). The antioxidant activities of dry LJ (dLJ) extracts were superior to those of LJv extracts. Water extracts possessed higher activities than that prepared by ethanol or SFE. The total polyphenols content, total flavonoids content, and the amount of chlorogenic acid and luteolin-7-O-glucoside were all higher in the water extracts compared to the other two. The SFE extracts of these two species all exhibited excellent anti-inflammatory activities. Although the water and ethanol extracts of dLJ extracts had higher anti-inflammatory activity than that of LJv extracts, the SFE extracts prepared from fresh LJv flower buds (fLJv) exhibited the highest activity among all extracts.

Maternal derived antibody-mediated immunity (AMI) and cell-mediated immunity (CMI) are critical immediate defenses for the neonate; however, MDI may interfere with the induction of active immunity in the neonate, i.e. passive interference. The effect of antigen-specific MDI on vaccine-induced AMI and CMI responses to Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae (M. hyopneumoniae) was assessed in neonatal piglets. To determine whether CMI and AMI responses could be induced in piglets with MDI, piglets with high and low levels of maternal M. hyopneumoniae-specific immunity were vaccinated against M. hyopneumoniae at 7 d of age. Piglet M. hyopneumoniae-specific antibody, lymphoproliferation, and delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) responses were measured 7 d and 14 d post vaccination. RESULTS: Piglets with M. hyopneumoniae-specific MDI failed to show vaccine-induced AMI responses; there was no rise in M. hyopneumoniae antibody levels following vaccination of piglets in the presence of M. hyopneumoniae-specific MDI. However, piglets with M. hyopneumoniae-specific MDI had primary (antigen-specific lymphoproliferation) and secondary (DTH) M. hyopneumoniae-specific CMI responses following vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: In this study neonatal M. hyopneumoniae-specific CMI was not subject to passive interference by MDI. Further, it appears that both maternal derived and endogenous CMI contribute to M. hyopneumoniae-specific CMI responses in piglets vaccinated in the face of MDI.","Bandrick, Meggan; Theis, Kara; Molitor, Thomas W",BMC Vet Res,551,16

A population of 870 patients from 12 countries were included. Median age was 63 years (54-74), most of patients were male (68.4%) and had comorbidities (87.2%). Acute kidney injury (AKI) was hospital-acquired in 64.7% and non-oliguric in 59.9%. Multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS) due to COVID-19 and volume depletion were the main causes of AKI (59.2% and 35.7% respectively). Kidney replacement therapy was started in 46.2%. Non-recovery of renal function was observed in 65.3%. 71.5% of patients were admitted to ICU and 72.2% underwent mechanical ventilation. Proteinuria at admission was present in 62.4% of patients and proteinuria during hospital-stay occurred in 37.5%. Those patients with proteinuria at admission had higher burden of comorbidities, higher baseline sCr, higher mortality and MODS was severe. On the other hand, patients with de novo proteinuria had lower burden of comorbidities and near normal sCr at admission, but showed adverse course of disease and higher in-mortality. COVID-19 MODS was the main cause of AKI in both groups. All-cause mortality was 57.4%, and it was associated to age, chronic cardiac disease, fluid depletion, COVID-19 MODS, non-recovery of renal function, ICU admission, vasopressors, in-hospital complications and hospital stay.

Although hzVSF inhibited HBV RNA production, it did not affect viral transcription from minicircle DNA mimicking covalently closed circular DNA. Additionally, hzVSF did not inhibit viral protein or DNA release from infected cells. Rather, hzVSF inhibited the cell entry of viral preS1 peptides, possibly by altering intracellular vimentin localization, which is important for HBV cell entry.

Whole-genome sequencing demonstrated that the loss of S gene detection was due to the appearance of a SARS-CoV-2 lineage (B.1.1.7) designated as Variant of concern (VOC) 202012/01. By the beginning of January 2021, the new SARS-CoV-2 VOC comprised 70% of daily positive samples tested at Alderley Park and ∼98% by the end of February 2021. INTERPRETATION: The timeline view identified the rapid spread of the new SARS-CoV-2 variant across England during the first three weeks of December. Coupling high-throughput diagnostics and molecular surveillance was pivotal to the early detection of the spread of this variant. The availability of real-time tracking of an emerging variant is an important new tool to inform decision-making authorities for risk mitigation. In a respiratory pandemic, a tool for the timely response to the emergence and spread of a novel variant is vital, even more so when a variant is associated with the enhanced transmission, as has occurred with VOC 202012/01.","Gravagnuolo, Alfredo Maria; Faqih, Layla; Cronshaw, Cara; Wynn, Jacquelyn; Klapper, Paul; Wigglesworth, Mark",EBioMedicine,551,20

For this purpose, ten exercises were developed to be downloaded by the students and the solutions returned to the course lecturer on a weekly basis. In addition, two students individually recorded via video one of eight doctor-patient exercise conversations, which were then evaluated by four other students and the respective lecturer. Methods: For evaluation, the students filled out an exercise and an effect-related questionnaire with 21 items. Results: The questionnaire was completed by n=203 (98%) students (59% female, 41% male). The video-based situation analyses (91%) helped most of them to become rather closely or very well acquainted with medical conversation practice. 76% rated the exercise “Enlightenment Conversation/SPIKES Protocol” as fairly helpful or very helpful in respect to the practicing concepts of medical conversation. When asked about the effects, most of them found the idea of patient orientation in medicine to be quite helpful or very helpful (83%). About a quarter of them (24%) stated that the online course could not, or only slightly, replace face-to-face teaching. This assessment was less pronounced among female students than among male students (Wilcoxon test p<.01). Conclusion: Our online course concept of physician-patient conversation found good overall response among pre-clinical medical students. However, the participants expressed different opinions about the extent to which the concept can replace face-to-face teaching.","Fischbeck, Sabine; Hardt, Jochen; Malkewitz, Camila; Petrowski, Katja",GMS J Med Educ,551,16

The underlying reason is the host's uncontrolled inflammatory response due to an infection led to multiple organ dysfunction/failure. Neutrophils, an innate immune cell, are forerunners to reach the site of infection/inflammation for clearing the infection and resolute the inflammation during sepsis. A relatively new neutrophil effector function, neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), have been demonstrated to kill the pathogens by releasing DNA decorated with histone and granular proteins. A growing number of pieces of shreds of evidence suggest that unregulated incidence of NETs have a significant influence on the pathogenesis of sepsis-induced multiple organ damage, including arterial hypotension, hypoxemia, coagulopathy, renal, neurological, and hepatic dysfunction. Thus, excessive production and improper resolution of NETs are of significant therapeutic value in combating sepsis-induced multiple organ failure. The purpose of this review is intended to highlight the role of NETs in sepsis-induced organ failure. Furthermore, the current status of therapeutic strategies to intersect the harmful effects of NETs to restore organ functions is discussed.","Kumar, Sanni; Payal, Nazrana; Srivastava, Vijay Kumar; Kaushik, Sanket; Saxena, Juhi; Jyoti, Anupam",Clin Chim Acta,551,20

Due to a lack of epidemiological data and clinical experience, it was feared that children with respiratory diseases were a risk group for particularly severe courses of COVID-19, as has been reported for adults. OBJECTIVE: The currently available (epidemiological) data on this patient group are presented as well as a description of our own experiences based on three selected cases. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A review of the literature was carried out and three selected case reports and a discussion of current recommendations are presented. RESULTS: The incidence of COVID-19 is significantly lower in children than in adults. Furthermore, the known risk factors in adults cannot be simply transferred to pediatric patients. In the majority of cases, children and adolescents with chronic lung diseases show a milder course of SARS-CoV‑2 infections. CONCLUSION: Although the hitherto available data show that children and adolescents have a lower risk for COVID-19 courses than adults, it should not be ignored that fatal outcomes have also been reported in pediatric patients. Moreover, late effects, such as the pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome (PIMS) can sometimes lead to a fatal outcome. Nevertheless, care must be taken that this vulnerable patient group does not suffer from avoidable negative side effects of restriction and isolation measures. As an example, the no-show behavior in outpatient departments during the lockdown might have led to a relevant undertreatment of underlying chronic health conditions.","Kiefer, A.; Kerzel, S.",Pneumologe (Berl),551,20

The patients developed severe symptoms and were admitted in intensive care unit (ICU) to receive invasive ventilation due to diagnosis of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). METHODS: A cross-sectional descriptive study composed of elderly (age ≥ 60 years) admitted to the ICU. Were collected demographic (sex, age), anthropometric data, presence of comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, lung, neurological and oncological diseases), severity score in ICU (SAPS III), PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio, analysis of C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum dosage of 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25 OHD) in the first day of hospitalization to identify elderly with hypovitaminosis D (low values < 30 ng/mL). The diagnosis of obesity in elderly was determined by calculating the body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m(2). RESULTS: A total of 176 elderly met the inclusion criteria. 54% were elderly men and mean age of 72.9 ± 9.1 years. The median BMI was 30.5 (28.1–33) kg/m(2) with 68.7% having a nutritional diagnosis of obesity and 15.3% had BMI ≥ 35 kg/m(2). The most prevalent comorbidities were hypertension (72.2%) and diabetes (40.9%). Prevalence of hypovitaminosis D with values of 25 OHD <30 ng/mL, < 20 ng/mL and <10 ng/mL was 93.8%, 65.9% and 21% respectively. The prevalence of hypovitaminosis D (<30 ng/mL) in obese elderly was 94.2%. There was a negative and significant bivariate correlation between BMI and levels of 25 OHD (r = - 0.15; p = 0.04). CONCLUSION: Hypovitaminosis D and obesity in elderly have a high prevalence in critically ill patients in ICU infected by the new coronavirus.

METHODS: The noncytotoxic antifungal concentration of baicalein was determined using CCK8, cell scratch assay, minimum inhibitory concentration, biofilm formation, scanning electron microscopy, propidium iodide uptake test and adherence assay in vitro and Draize test in vivo. In fungal keratitis (FK) mouse models, clinical score and plate count were used to evaluate FK severity, and myeloperoxidase assay and immunofluorescence staining were performed to examine neutrophil infiltration and activity. Real-time PCR, ELISA, and Western blot were performed to explore the anti-inflammatory activity of baicalein and the underlying mechanisms in vivo and in vitro. RESULTS: Baicalein at 0.25 mM (noncytotoxic) significantly inhibited A. fumigatus growth, biofilm formation, and adhesion in vitro. In A. fumigatus keratitis mice, baicalein mitigated FK severity, reduced fungal load, and inhibited neutrophil infiltration and activity. Baicalein not only suppressed mRNA and protein levels of proinflammatory factors IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α, but also inhibited the expression of thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) and TSLP receptor (TSLPR) in vivo and in vitro. In HCECs, mRNA and protein levels of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α were significantly lower in the TSLP siRNA–treated group, while higher in the rTSLP-treated group than in the corresponding control. Baicalein treatment significantly inhibited rTSLP induced the expression of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α. CONCLUSIONS: Baicalein plays a protective role in mouse A. fumigatus keratitis by inhibiting fungal growth, biofilm formation, and adhesion, and suppressing inflammatory response via downregulation of the TSLP/TSLPR pathway.","Zhu, Yunan; Peng, Xudong; Zhang, Yingxue; Lin, Jing; Zhao, Guiqiu",Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci,551,1

Rapid diagnostic tests with a high sensitivity for lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) could lead to improved patient care and reduce unnecessary antibiotic use and associated costs. Diagnostic yields, feasibility, and costs of real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab specimens in the routine diagnostic work-up for LRTI were determined. Methods. In a randomized controlled trial, nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab specimens from patients admitted for antibiotic treatment of LRTI were evaluated by means of real-time PCR for respiratory viruses and atypical pathogens, as well as by conventional diagnostic procedures. Real-time PCR results for patients in the intervention group were reported to the treating physician; results for patients in the control group were not made available. Results. A total of 107 patients (mean age [± standard deviation], 63.6 ± 16.3 years) were included, of whom 55 were allocated to the intervention group. The pathogens detected most frequently were influenza virus (14 patients), Streptococcus pneumoniae (8), coronavirus (6), Staphylococcus aureus (5), and rhinoviruses (5). Real-time PCR increased the diagnostic yield from 23 cases (21% of patients) to 47 cases (43% of patients), compared with conventional diagnostic tests. The detection of viral pathogens by PCR was associated with the winter season, less infiltrates on chest radiographs, lower C-reactive protein levels, and shorter duration of symptoms. Use of real-time PCR results resulted in partial or total cessation of antibiotic treatment for 6 patients (11%; 95% confidence interval, 2–19), but overall antibiotic use was comparable in the intervention group and the control group (median duration of treatment, 10.0 vs. 9.0 days; P = not significant). Use of real-time PCR increased treatment and diagnostic costs with €318.17 per patient. Conclusions.

The subjects were divided and compared as follows: HCW versus non-HCW groups and RT-PCR positive versus negative groups. RESULTS: A total of 140 had symptoms, 291 wanted to be tested, and 664 were asymptomatic but were screened. Seven subjects had positive results for COVID-19. Compared with the non-HCWs, the HCWs were younger and had a lower rate of underlying medical conditions. In addition, there were more women, individuals with exposure to confirmed cases, and individuals with symptoms or those who just wanted to be tested. The frequency of all symptoms was high among the HCWs. The results of the logistic regression analysis showed that the HCWs were significantly associated with the presence of symptoms, having an odds ratio of 23.317 (confidence interval, 15.142–35.907L; P < 0.001). The positive group had a high rate of exposure to patients with confirmed COVID-19 and had more subjects with symptoms or those who wanted to be tested. CONCLUSION: In-hospital screening stations are a relatively safe way to protect and support HCWs and to reduce and manage the spread of infection within the hospital effectively during an outbreak in the community.","Choi, Hye-In; Ko, Hae-Jin; Song, Ji-Eun; Park, Ji-Yeon; Kim, Jin-Hee",Risk Manag Healthc Policy,551,33

In particular, the focus is on mutations of Spike protein, which binds human ACE2 protein enabling SARS-CoV2 entry and infection. Here we present a rapid experimental method leveraging the speed and flexibility of Mircoscale Thermopheresis (MST) to characterize the interaction between Spike Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) and human ACE2 protein. The B.1.351 variant harboring three mutations, (E484K, N501Y, and K417N) binds the ACE2 at nearly five-fold greater affinity than the original SARS-COV-2 RBD. We also find that the B.1.1.7 variant, binds two-fold more tightly to ACE2 than the SARS-COV-2 RBD.","Ramanathan, Muthukumar; Ferguson, Ian D.; Miao, Weili; Khavari, Paul A.",bioRxiv,551,20

Nucleotide sequence comparisons revealed that the genome sequence of the new virus was 91-93 % identical to those of known murine hepatitis viruses (MHVs). The predicted open reading frame from the nucleotide sequence encoded all known proteins of MHVs. Analysis at the protein level showed that the virus was closely related to the highly virulent MHV-JHM strain. The virus strain was named MHV-MI. No type D retroviruses were found.

A major concern is methanol adulteration that caused more than 700 fatalities in Iran and U.S.A. (since February 2020). In response, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has restricted the methanol content in sanitizers to 0.063 vol% and blacklisted 212 products (as of November 20, 2020). Here, we present a low-cost, handheld, and smartphone-assisted device that detects methanol selectively in sanitizers between 0.01 and 100 vol% within two minutes. It features a nanoporous polymer column that separates methanol selectively from confounders by adsorption. A chemoresistive gas sensor detects the methanol. When tested on commercial sanitizers (total 76 samples), methanol was quantified in excellent (R(2) = 0.99) agreement to “gold standard” gas chromatography. Importantly, methanol quantification was hardly interfered by sanitizer composition and viscosity. This device meets an urgent need for on-site methanol screening by authorities, health professionals, and even laymen.","Güntner, Andreas T.; Magro, Leandro; van den Broek, Jan; Pratsinis, Sotiris E.",iScience,551,20

In addition, the popularity of decentralised decision making networks such as Bitcoin has seen a huge interest in making use of distributed ledger technology to store and securely disseminate end user identity credentials. In this paper we describe a mechanism that allows one to store the COVID-19 vaccination details of individuals on a publicly readable, decentralised, immutable blockchain, and makes use of a two-factor authentication system that employs biometric cryptographic hashing techniques to generate a unique identifier for each user. Our main contribution is the employment of a provably secure input-hiding, locality-sensitive hashing algorithm over an iris extraction technique, that can be used to authenticate users and anonymously locate vaccination records on the blockchain, without leaking any personally identifiable information to the blockchain.","Chaudhari, Sarang; Clear, Michael; Tewari, Hitesh","Computing Conference, 2021",551,11

However, because drug use was officially prohibited in these facilities, we observed people who use substances leaving isolation temporarily or prematurely. The initial Covid-19 surge magnified the need for harm reduction access for those who use substances to ensure their safety and well-being and that of their local communities. In this commentary, we argue that expanding harm reduction access is crucial for subsequent waves of SARS-CoV-2 infection and also for patients who use substances and are hospitalized for other reasons.","Kimmel, Simeon D.; Bazzi, Angela R.; Barocas, Joshua A.",J Subst Abuse Treat,551,26

This study reports the experience of Hong Kong students in higher education concerning the challenges they faced, the strategies they used and the support they needed in their online learning during the period. An online questionnaire was used to invite students to answer open-ended questions about these three aspects. 145 students from two higher education institutions completed the questionnaire and their comments were coded using thematic analysis. The study has discovered that socio-economic factors may have presented difficulties to students’ online learning concerning their study environment and access to equipment. Students were emotionally distressed by online learning, particularly by the quality of feedback and clarity of course arrangement, so support for these aspects should be given. Self-regulated learning strategies were found to have been deployed by students to facilitate their learning, in which the use of time management apps and lecture videos highlights the increasing importance of technology to self study. These socio-economic, technological and emotional factors will be further discussed and corresponding suggestions will be made to help teachers and university policy makers examine the conditions that can help improve and promote online learning for higher education students under COVID-19.","Yeung, Matthew W.

Assessing the effect of COVID-19 on liver injury is of great importance. A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to establish the characteristics of liver function tests in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: A systematic search of publications from December 2019 up to April 2020 in Web of Science, Scopus, and Medline (via PubMed) databases was performed. Both cross-sectional and case series studies reporting an association between liver injury and COVID-19 infection were included. The data were analyzed using the STATA software (version 11.0) and the random-effects model for I(2)>50% was used to pool the results. RESULTS: In this meta-analysis, 42 articles comprising a total of 6,557 COVID-19 patients were studied. The prevalence of increase in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels was 30% and 21% in non-severe patients and 38% and 48% in severe patients, respectively. Patients with severe COVID-19 infection were 4.22, 4.96, and 4.13 times more likely to have elevated AST, ALT, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, respectively. CONCLUSION: Elevation in liver function tests was higher in patients with severe than non-severe COVID-19 infection. Given the widespread use of drugs that increases the risk of hepatotoxicity, healthcare providers should be aware of changes in liver enzymes in COVID-19 patients. The inclusion of other studies from outside China could confirm the pattern of elevation in liver function tests in COVID-19 patients across the globe.

Severe asthma is more susceptible to virus-induced asthma exacerbations, especially in the presence of high IgE levels. In the course of immune responses to viruses, an initial activation of innate immunity typically occurs and the production of type I and III interferons is essential in the control of viral spread. However, the Th2 inflammatory environment still appears to be protective against viral infections in general and in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections as well. As for now, literature data, although extremely limited and preliminary, show that severe asthma patients treated with biologics don’t have an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection or progression to severe forms compared to the non-asthmatic population. Omalizumab, an anti-IgE monoclonal antibody, exerts a profound cellular effect, which can stabilize the effector cells, and is becoming much more efficient from the point of view of innate immunity in contrasting respiratory viral infections. In addition to the antiviral effect, clinical efficacy and safety of this biological allow a great improvement in the management of asthma.","Menzella, Francesco; Ghidoni, Giulia; Galeone, Carla; Capobelli, Silvia; Scelfo, Chiara; Facciolongo, Nicola Cosimo",Biomedicines,551,12

With the vaccine approval likely more than a year away and novel drugs in early clinical trials, repurposing of existing drugs takes the center stage. A potential drug discussed both in geopolitical and global scientific community is hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). We intend to systematically weigh and analyze the existing evidence of HCQ in the light of published and pre-print data available so far. Methods: PubMed Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, Google scholar databases and official clinical trial Registries of the United States, China, WHO ICTRP were electronically searched for studies for the use of HCQ in patients with COVID-19. Pre-proof article repositories like MedRxiv, BioRxiv, and ChemRxiv were also included in the search. The literature was critically appraised. Results: Total 71 articles were available as of 15 th April of which articles of relevance (three invitro studies, two open label non-randomized trials, two open label randomized control trials, one follow-up study, three reviews, ten short communications) and 88 clinical trials registered in three clinical trial registries were analyzed. HCQ seems to be efficient in inhibiting of SARS CoV-2 in in-vitro cell lines; there is lack of strong evidence from human studies. Conclusions: The in-vitro cell culture based data of viral inhibition does not suffice for the use of hydroxychloroquine in the patients with COVID-19. Currently literature shows inadequate, low level evidence in human studies. Scarcity of safety and efficacy data warrants medical communities, health care agencies and governments across the world against the widespread use of HCQ in COVID-19 prophylaxis and treatment, until robust evidence becomes available.

COVID-19: THERAPEUTICS UNDER REVIEW,16.257586,5.2595096,2020-07-28,"Human coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, are known to spread mainly via close contact and respiratory droplets. However, other potential means of transmission may be present. Fomite-mediated transmission occurs when viruses are deposited onto a surface and then transfer to a subsequent individual. Surfaces can become contaminated directly from respiratory droplets or from a contaminated hand. Due to mask mandates in many countries around the world, the former is less likely. Hands can become contaminated if respiratory droplets are deposited on them (i.e., coughing or sneezing) or through contact with fecal material where human coronaviruses (HCoVs) can be shed. The focus of this paper is on whether human coronaviruses can transfer efficiently from contaminated hands to food or food contact surfaces. The surfaces chosen were: stainless steel, plastic, cucumber and apple. Transfer was first tested with cellular maintenance media and three viruses: two human coronaviruses, 229E and OC43, and murine norovirus-1, as a surrogate for human norovirus. There was no transfer for either of the human coronaviruses to any of the surfaces. Murine norovirus-1 did transfer to stainless steel, cucumber and apple, with transfer efficiencies of 9.19%, 5.95% and 0.329%, respectively. Human coronavirus OC43 transfer was then tested in the presence of fecal material, and transfer was observed for stainless steel (0.52%), cucumber (19.82%) and apple (15.51%) but not plastic. This study indicates that human coronaviruses do not transfer effectively from contaminated hands to contact surfaces without the presence of fecal material.","Dallner, Matthew; Harlow, Jennifer; Nasheri, Neda",Viruses,551,20

We investigated how the dynamics of clinical progression changed along 4 pathways: recovery, improvement in respiratory therapy requirement, deterioration in respiratory therapy requirement, and death. METHODS: We analyzed trajectories of daily ordinal severity scores reflecting oxygen requirements of 1051 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 who participated in ACTT-1. We developed competing risks models that estimate the effect of remdesivir therapy on cumulative incidence of clinical improvement and deterioration, and multistate models that utilize the entirety of each patient’s clinical course to characterize the effect of remdesivir on progression along the 4 pathways above. RESULTS: Based on a competing risks analysis, remdesivir reduced clinical deterioration (hazard ratio [HR], 0.73; 95% confidence interval [CI]: .59–.91) and increased clinical improvement (HR, 1.22; 95% CI: 1.08, 1.39) relative to baseline. Our multistate models indicate that remdesivir inhibits worsening to ordinal scores of greater clinical severity among patients on room air or low-flow oxygen (HR, 0.74; 95% CI: .57–.94) and among patients receiving mechanical ventilation or high-flow oxygen/noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation (HR, 0.73; 95% CI: .53–1.00) at baseline. We also find that remdesivir reduces expected intensive care respiratory therapy utilization among patients not mechanically ventilated at baseline. CONCLUSIONS: Remdesivir speeds time to recovery by preventing worsening to clinical states that would extend the course of hospitalization and increase intensive respiratory support, thereby reducing the overall demand for hospital care.","Fintzi, Jonathan; Bonnett, Tyler; Sweeney, Daniel A; Huprikar, Nikhil A; Ganesan, Anuradha; Frank, Maria G; McLellan, Susan L F; Dodd, Lori E; Tebas, Pablo; Mehta, Aneesh K",Clin Infect Dis,551,28

METHODS: We extracted publicly available data from official websites, summarized the containment measures implemented in China and India, and assessed their effectiveness. RESULTS: China has responded to the COVID-19 outbreak with strict public health containment measures, including lockdown of Wuhan city, active case tracing, and large-scale testing, ultimately preventing a large increase in daily new cases and maintaining a low mortality rate per million population (as of May 5, 2021, daily new cases were 11 and mortality rate per million population was 3.37). India, although imposing a national lockdown to control the pandemic, has not implemented strict testing, tracking, and quarantine measures due to the overburdened healthcare system. Combined with massive lockdown, it has accelerated human mobility and exacerbated the epidemic, resulting in a rapid increase in daily new cases and a high mortality rate per million population (as of May 5, 2021, daily new cases were 412,431 and mortality rate per million population was 166.79). CONCLUSION: China and India implemented public health containment measures to contain the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic based on their national situations.

Data from previous coronavirus infections, such as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, as well as current clinical evidence from the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), support that SARS-CoV-2 infection may lead to PF, seriously impacting patient prognosis and quality of life. Therefore, effective prevention and treatment of PF will improve patient prognosis and reduce the overall social and economic burdens. Stem cells, especially mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have many great advantages, including migration to damaged lung tissue and secretion of various paracrine factors, thereby regulating the permeability of endothelial and epithelial cells, reducing inflammatory response, promoting tissue repair and inhibiting bacterial growth. Clinical trials of MSCs for the treatment of acute lung injury, PF and severe and critically ill COVID-19 are ongoing. The purpose of this study is to systematically review preclinical studies, explored the effectiveness of MSCs in the treatment of bleomycin (BLM)-induced pulmonary fibrosis and analyze the potential mechanism, combined with clinical trials of current MSCs for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and COVID-19, so as to provide support for clinical research and transformation of MSCs. Searching PubMed and Embase (− 2021.4) identified a total of 36 preclinical studies of MSCs as treatment of BLM-induced acute lung injury and PF in rodent models. Most of the studies showed the MSCs treatment to reduce BLM-induced lung tissue inflammatory response, inflammatory cell infiltration, inflammatory cytokine expression, extracellular matrix production and collagen deposition, and to improve Ashcroft score. The results of present studies indicate that MSCs may serve as a potential therapeutic modality for the treatment of PF, including viral-induced PF and IPF.","Zhao, Yunyu; Yan, Zhipeng; Liu, Ying; Zhang, Yue; Shi, Jie; Li, Jingtao; Ji, Fanpu",Stem Cell Res Ther,551,1

Furthermore, we investigated participants’ experiences with a community-based intervention [Individual Placement and Support (IPS)] to explore perspectives on mechanisms that may eliminate challenges in the transfer process. METHODS: The study was based on semi-structured interviews with participants with mental illness, from four different psychosocial interventions with and without peer support and across interventional settings. The material partly consists of secondary analyses of existing data sets of anonymised, transcribed interviews investigating participants' experience from two psychosocial interventions: Illness Management and Recovery (n = 15), and Individual Placement and Support (n = 12). Additionally, we conducted semi-structured interviews with persons who had participated in one of two peer-led programs: Turning Points and Learn How to Tackle Anxiety and Depression (n = 12). The analysis was guided by a hermeneutic-phenomenological approach to illuminate transfer processes and was based on the template method described by Nigel King. RESULTS: Applying a transfer perspective on rehabilitation interventions identified everyday life situations where capacities learned during the interventions were utilized and conditions were highlighted that promoted or hindered transfer. Experiential knowledge and peer-exchange made transferal pathways between the interventional context and everyday life. Illness intrusiveness and uncertainty, together with environmental obstacles, generated transferal gaps. Individualized support could partly address these gaps. CONCLUSION: Findings from this qualitative study illuminate how peer-support in group-based rehabilitation interventions increased social functioning and developed better self-care strategies that can be transferred to daily life. Interventions situated in mental health settings, e.g. outpatient clinics, had limited impact on participation in broader community life. Advancing rehabilitation services in mental health may benefit from tailoring services to address illness fluctuation and combining group sessions with individualized support together with acknowledging and overcoming environmental obstacles.","Bjørkedal, Siv Therese Bogevik; Eplov, Lene Falgaard; Møller, Tom",BMC Psychol,551,16

DESIGN: Online survey methodology. SETTING: UK. PARTICIPANTS: 1038 UK adults were recruited who were either identified by UK government as at high risk of severe illness from COVID-19 or self-identified as at high risk with acute or other chronic health conditions not included in the UK government list. Participants were recruited through social media advertisements, health charities and patient organisations. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: The awareness, attitudes and actions survey which explores the impact of COVID-19, on including access to healthcare, use of technology for health condition management, mental health, depression, well-being and lifestyle behaviours. RESULTS: Nearly half of the sample (44.5%) reported that their mental health had worsened during the COVID-19 lockdown. Management of health conditions changed including access to medications (28.5%) and delayed surgery (11.9%), with nearly half of the sample using telephone care (45.5%). Artificial Intelligence identified that participants in the negative cluster had higher neuroticism, insecurity and negative sentiment. Participants in this cluster reported more negative impacts on lifestyle behaviours, higher depression and lower well-being, alongside lower satisfaction with platforms to deliver healthcare.

This study set out to describe the clinical course and outcomes of these patients. Methods This single-center retrospective study was performed at Huoshenshan Hospital in Wuhan, China. Patients with confirmed COVID-19 who had pre-existing CVD (N=69) were identified. COVID-19 patients without CVD were randomly selected and matched by age and sex to the patients with CVD. Clinical data were analyzed and compared between the 2 groups. The composite endpoint included intensive care unit admission, use of mechanical ventilation, and death. Multivariable Cox regression analyses with control for medical comorbidities were used to examine the relationship between pre-existing CVD and clinical outcome of COVID-19. Results Compared with patients without CVD, patients with pre-existing CVD were more likely to present with unapparent symptoms at first; however, at admission, these patients tended to be in a severer condition than those without CVD, with more underlying hypertension and diabetes. The levels of interleukin-6, creative kinase MB, aspartate transaminase, and creatinine, as well as prothrombin time, were also markedly higher in patients with CVD. Patients with pre-existing CVD were more likely to develop multi-organ dysfunction, deteriorate to critical condition, and yield poorer clinical outcomes than patients without CVD. Concerning therapeutics, greater proportions of patients with pre-existing CVD required mechanical ventilation, higher-order anti-bacterials, and drugs targeting underlying diseases and complications. In the multivariable analysis, pre-existing CVD was significantly associated with a poor clinical outcome. Conclusions Patients with a history of CVD are more vulnerable to an over-activated inflammatory response and subsequent multi-organ dysfunction, resulting in a poor clinical outcome. Close monitoring is advisable for these patients.","Bai, Yang; Liang, Yong; Wang, Fang; Chen, Ligang; Zhao, Yulong; Zhao, Shoujie; Zhu, Yejing; Dong, Yushu; Liang, Guobiao; Chen, Dongfeng; Liu, Lei",Annals of translational medicine,551,16

They are involved in the regulation of important cellular processes, such as signalling, differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis, and in host-virus response, and for this, they are considered as promising therapeutic targets to slow tumour progression and viral pathogenesis. Although extensive work has been carried out with them, including their classification into six distinct phylogenetically clades, little is known on bacterial macrodomains, especially if these latter are able to remove poly(ADP-ribose) polymer (PAR) from PARylated proteins, activity that only has been confirmed in human TARG1 (C6orf130) protein. To extend this limited knowledge, we demonstrate, after a comprehensive bioinformatic and phylogenetic analysis, that Fusobacterium mortiferum ATCC 9817 TARG1 (FmTARG1) is the first bacterial macrodomain shown to have high catalytic efficiency towards O-acyl-ADP-ribose, even more than hTARG1, and towards mono- and poly(ADPribosyl)ated proteins. Surprisingly, FmTARG1 gene is also inserted into a unique operonic context, only shared by the distantly related Fusobacterium perfoetens ATCC 29250 macrodomain, which include an immunity protein 51 domain, typical of bacterial polymorphic toxin systems.","García-Saura, Antonio Ginés; Zapata-Pérez, Rubén; Hidalgo, José Francisco; Cabanes, Juana; Gil-Ortiz, Fernando; Sánchez-Ferrer, Álvaro",Sci Rep,551,1

Great efforts have been put into anti-COVID-19 vaccine generation in an effort to protect the world population and block SARS-CoV-2 spread. To validate the protective efficacy of the vaccination campaign and effectively control the pandemy, it is necessary to quantify the neutralizing antibodies induction by vaccination, since they have been established to be a correlate of protection. In this work a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus neutralization assay, based on a replication incompetent lentivirus expressing an adapted form of CoV-2 S protein and an ACE2/TMPRSS2 stably expressing cell line, have been minimized in term of protocol steps without loss of accuracy. The goal of the present simplified neutralization system is to improve SARS-CoV-2 vaccination campaign by means of an easy and accessible approach to be performed in any medical laboratory, maintaining the sensitivity and quantitative reliability of classical serum neutralization assays. Further this assay can be easily adapted to different coronaviruses variants by simply modifying the pseudotyping vector.","Donofrio, G.; Franceschi, V.; Macchi, F.; Russo, L.; Rocci, A.; Marchica, V.; Costa, F.; Giuliani, N.; Ferrari, C.; Missale, G.",,551,1

This virus can reach all organs and disturbs the immune system, leading to a cytokine storm in severe forms. We aimed to report cutaneous features among coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) hospitalized patients. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study on 1 given day among all patients hospitalized in acute care for COVID-19 and included all patients with cutaneous features. Follow-up 48 hours later was obtained. RESULTS: Among 59 adult patients hospitalized on the day of the study in an infectious diseases ward for SARS-CoV-2 infection who were confirmed by molecular assay and/or radiological findings (computed tomography scan), 40 were included. Several cutaneous manifestations were found: macular exanthema (80%), face edema (32%), livedo (13%), urticarial rash (8%), purpura (5%), oral lichenoid lesions (33%), and conjunctivitis (18%). Cutaneous biopsy was performed in 17 patients. Histological findings showed mast cell hyperplasia (100%), superficial perivascular infiltrate of lymphocytes (94%), and superficial edema (47%) consistent with capillary leak. CONCLUSIONS: Various dermatological signs can be encountered during COVID-19. A macular rash was the most frequent. All cutaneous features could be related to a vascular leak process.","Mascitti, Hélène; Bonsang, Benjamin; Dinh, Aurélien; Assan, Florence; Perronne, Véronique; Leblanc, Thibault; Duran, Clara; Bouchand, Frédérique; Matt, Morgan; Le Gal, Aurélie; N’guyen Van Thanh, Julia; Lanore, Aymeric; Jacob, Louis; Kiavue, Nicolas; Siméon, Soline; Bessis, Simon; de Truchis, Pierre; Landowski, Stéphanie; Davido, Benjamin; Moreau, Frédérique; Rameix-Welti, Marie-Anne; Gault, Elyanne; Gaillard, Jean-Louis; Roux, Anne-Laure; Sivadon-Tardy, Valérie; Salomon, Elsa; El Sayed, Faten; Carlier, Robert; Emile, Jean-François; Perronne, Christian; Bourgault-Villada, Isabelle",Open Forum Infect Dis,551,20

The HIV frameshift site consists of a heptanucleotide slippery sequence (UUUUUUA) followed by a spacer region and a downstream RNA stem–loop structure. Here we investigate the role of the RNA structure in promoting the −1 frameshift. The stem–loop was systematically altered to decouple the contributions of local and overall thermodynamic stability towards frameshift efficiency. No correlation between overall stability and frameshift efficiency is observed. In contrast, there is a strong correlation between frameshift efficiency and the local thermodynamic stability of the first 3–4 bp in the stem–loop, which are predicted to reside at the opening of the mRNA entrance channel when the ribosome is paused at the slippery site. Insertion or deletions in the spacer region appear to correspondingly change the identity of the base pairs encountered 8 nt downstream of the slippery site. Finally, the role of the surrounding genomic secondary structure was investigated and found to have a modest impact on frameshift efficiency, consistent with the hypothesis that the genomic secondary structure attenuates frameshifting by affecting the overall rate of translation.","Mouzakis, Kathryn D.; Lang, Andrew L.; Vander Meulen, Kirk A.; Easterday, Preston D.; Butcher, Samuel E.",Nucleic Acids Res,551,16

This situation can be hard to cope with due to separation from loved ones, prohibition of regular activities, fear of infection, loss of freedom, and so on. These negative impacts cause considerable psychological stress, and all the more so when the situation continues for an extended period, as was the case in Spain. The present study was aimed at investigating the effects of COVID-19 quarantine on the emotional functioning of confined Spanish individuals after 8 weeks of lockdown by means of a cross-sectional study. The possible associations between changes in emotional functioning and demographic variables (age and sex), health habits (physical exercise, following a routine, and smoking), social support, and resilience were also analyzed. METHODS: A total of 906 Spanish adults completed an online survey to gather information about their prevailing mood and affects (before and after 8 weeks of lockdown), using the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) (Watson et al., 1988), and other variables related to their habits and protective factors. FINDINGS: As expected, the data indicated an increase in negative affects (e.g., “upset,” “afraid,” “distressed”) and a decrease in positive affects after 8 weeks under lockdown, as well as a general decline in overall mood. The largest increases in negative affects were observed in young adults (18–35 years) and women. We did not find any differences between people who were or were not diagnosed with COVID-19. Adhering to a routine, maintaining the same weight, and moderate physical exercise were associated with fewer negative affects, which indicates they are important protective factors, as are perceived social support and resilience. CONCLUSION: In order to mitigate the psychological impact of confinement, it is important to develop psychoeducational measures that encourage subjects to adhere to health habits and promote social support and resilience as protective factors. A special preventive focus should be placed on the most vulnerable population groups, namely women and young adults. For a public health lockdown to succeed, its negative consequences must be minimized insofar as possible through adequate knowledge of the risk factors and protective factors, and by means of prevention-oriented organization.","Gismero-González, Elena; Bermejo-Toro, Laura; Cagigal, Virginia; Roldán, Angustias; Martínez-Beltrán, María Jesús; Halty, Lucía",Front Psychol,551,16

Infected individuals are able to travel to any country in the world within one day. In this study we combine these two insights to investigate the influence of climate change on pandemic spreading patterns of airborne infectious diseases, like influenza. Well-known recent examples for pandemics are severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS, 2002/2003) and H1N1 (Influenza A virus subtype, 2009), which have demonstrated the vulnerability of a strongly connected world. Methods Our study is based on a complex network approach including the following datasets: –global air traffic data (from openflights.org) with information on airports, direct flight connections, and airplane types; –global population grid [from Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center (SEDAC), NASA]; –WATCH-Forcing-Data-ERA-Interim (WFDEI) climate reanalysis data (1980–2015) and RCP6.0 climate projection data (2016–2040): temperature, specific humidity, surface air pressure, water vapour pressure. We use the dependency between water vapour pressure and influenza transmission rate to give every location around the globe a unique transmission rate time series from 1980 until 2040. Local disease development is simulated with a stochastic SEIR compartmental model. All individuals (including infectious ones) are able to migrate from location to location via air traffic to simulate global dissemination of the virus. Results Our results show which regions are most vulnerable to climate change in terms of influenza pandemics towards key target locations (defined by highest degree, highest population, highest betweenness centrality). Furthermore, we point out the influence of climate change on pandemics from 1980 until 2040. A significant trend in the pandemic rate of spreading can be seen on a global scale. Climate change causes an influenza pandemic to proceed 5 days slower (global average) in the year 2040 compared to the year 1980. This trend varies from country to country. For example, pandemics originating from Chad show an accelerated (6 days faster) spread. Conclusion The presented results focus on the effect that climate change has on spreading patterns of airborne infectious diseases. The change from 1980 until 2040 of important influencing variables like population distribution, varying air traffic, vaccine research, hygiene, and healthcare are neglected to separate the impact of climate change.","Brenner, F.; Marwan, N.",Revue d'Épidémiologie et de Santé Publique,551,24

However, point-of-care (POC) testing in places such as emergency units, outpatient clinics, airport security points or the entrance of any public building is a major challenge. The need for thermal cycling and nucleic acid isolation hampers the use of standard PCR-based methods for this purpose. Methods: To avoid these obstacles, we tested PCR-independent methods for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from primary material (nasopharyngeal swabs) including loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) and specific high-sensitivity enzymatic reporter unlocking (SHERLOCK). Results: Whilst specificity of standard LAMP assays appears to be satisfactory, sensitivity does not reach the current gold-standard quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assays yet. We describe a novel multiplexed LAMP approach and validate its sensitivity on primary samples. This approach allows for fast and reliable identification of infected individuals. Primer optimization and multiplexing helps to increase sensitivity significantly. In addition, we directly compare and combine our novel LAMP assays with SHERLOCK. Conclusion: In summary, this approach reveals one-step multiplexed LAMP assays as a prime-option for the development of easy and cheap POC test kits.","Schermer, Bernhard; Fabretti, Francesca; Damagnez, Maximilian; Cristanziano, Veronica Di; Heger, Eva; Arjune, Sita; Tanner, Nathan A; Imhof, Thomas; Koch, Manuel; Ladha, Alim; Joung, Julia; Gootenberg, Jonathan S.; Abudayyeh, Omar O.; Burst, Volker; Zhang, Feng; Klein, Florian; Benzing, Thomas; Mueller, Roman-Ulrich",,551,32

Using questionnaires, we aimed to determine the direct and/or indirect contacts of flying foxes in an Indonesian nature conservation area with domestic animals and humans living in the surrounding area. We surveyed 150 residents of 10 villages in West Java. Villages were classified into 3 groups: inside and/or within 1 km from the outer border of the conservation area and 1–5 km or 5–10 km away from the reserve’s outer border. Data were collected by direct interview using a structured questionnaire consisting of the respondent characteristics (age, sex and occupation); histories of contacts between flying foxes and humans, dogs and other domestic animals; and knowledge about infectious diseases, mainly rabies, in flying foxes. We found that flying foxes from the nature conservation area often enter residential areas at night to look for food, especially during the fruit season. In these residential areas, flying foxes had direct contacts with humans and a few contacts with domestic animals, especially dogs. People who encounter flying foxes seldom used personal protective equipment, such as leather gloves, goggles and caps.

Although pediatric cases are rare, the group age under 12 months has been in general more susceptible to develop severe forms of the disease compared with the patients in the age interval of 1 to 18 years. PATIENT CONCERNS: Three newborns have been tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. One of them presented bilateral decreased air entry, while the other 2 had no respiratory symptomatology. All 3 developed diaper erythema and oral candidiasis. DIAGNOSIS: For building up the report, newborns that were positive for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection were included in the case series. The chest X-ray of the symptomatic patient revealed a medium degree of hilar parenchymal infiltration and a slight infiltration of the visceral pleura. INTERVENTIONS: The patients were admitted in our isolated neonatology ward. All of them received antifungal treatment for the oral candidiasis and topic cream for diaper erythema. The symptomatic patient also received prophylactic antibiotherapy, human immunoglobulins, aminophylline, and parenteral nutrition. OUTCOMES: All 3 neonates were discharged after 2 consecutive negative tests for SARS-CoV-2. Patients 1 and 2 fully recovered, whereas the condition of patient 3 improved. LESSONS: Even if there are only a few reported cases of neonates infected with COVID-19 and most of them present mild manifestations, newborns need a more careful insight because of the nonspecific symptomatology.","Dima, Mirabela; Enatescu, Ileana; Craina, Marius; Petre, Izabella; Iacob, Emil Radu; Iacob, Daniela",Medicine (Baltimore),551,24

Although it is known since the 1950s, new epidemiological and clinical features reported during the recent outbreak in the Indian Ocean can be regarded as the emergence of a new disease. Numerous severe forms of the infection have been described that put emphasis on the lack of efficient antiviral therapy. Among the virus-encoded enzymes, nsP2 constitutes an attractive target for the development of antiviral drugs. It is a multifunctional protein of approximately 90 kDa with a helicase motif in the N-terminal portion of the protein while the papain-like protease activity resides in the C-terminal portion. The nsP2 proteinase is an essential enzyme whose proteolytic activity is critical for virus replication. In this work, a recombinant CHIKV nsP2pro and a C-terminally truncated variant were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by metal–chelate chromatography. The enzymatic properties of the proteinase were then determined using specific synthetic fluorogenic substrates. This study constitutes the first characterization of a recombinant CHIKV nsP2 cysteine protease, which may be useful for future drug screening.","Pastorino, Boris A.M.; Peyrefitte, Christophe N.; Almeras, Lionel; Grandadam, Marc; Rolland, Dominique; Tolou, Hugues J.; Bessaud, Maël",Virus Res,551,16

Studies in severely ill individuals have identified robust cellular and humoral immune responses against the virus. Asymptomatic infection with SARS-CoV-2 has also been described, but it is unknown whether this is sufficient to produce antibody responses. Methods We performed a cross-sectional study recruiting 554 health care workers from University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust who were at work and asymptomatic. Participants were tested for current infection with SARS-CoV-2 by nasopharyngeal swab for real-time polymerase chain reaction and for seroconversion by the measurement of anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein antibodies by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Results were interpreted in the context of previous, self-reported symptoms of illness consistent with COVID-19. Results The point prevalence of infection with SARS-CoV-2, determined by the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA on nasopharnygeal swab was 2.39% (n=13/544). Serum was available on 516 participants. The overall rate of seroconversion in the cohort was 24.4% (n=126/516). Individuals who had previously experienced a symptomatic illness consistent with COVID-19 had significantly greater seroconversion rates than those who had remained asymptomatic (37.5% vs 17.1%, {chi}2 =21.1034, p<0.0001). In the week preceding peak COVID-19-related mortality at UHBFT, seroconversion rates amongst those who were suffering from symptomatic illnesses peaked at 77.8%. Prior symptomatic illness generated quantitatively higher antibody responses than asymptomatic seroconversion. Seroconversion rates were highest amongst those working in housekeeping (34.5%), acute medicine (33.3%) and general internal medicine (30.3%) with lower rates observed in participants working in intensive care (14.8%) and emergency medicine (13.3%). Conclusions In a large cross-sectional seroprevalence study of health-care workers, we demonstrate that asymptomatic seroconversion occurs, however prior symptomatic illness is associated with quantitatively higher antibody responses. The identification that the potential for seroconversion in health-care workers can associate differentially with certain hospital departments may inform future infection control and occupational health practices.","Shields, A.

A review of research conducted in the Stroke Belt provides an opportunity to examine more closely traditional and non-traditional risk factors in an effort to consider strategies for change. RECENT FINDINGS: A diverse physician workforce has been offered as a way of improving care for our increasingly diverse populace. Given the expected increased prevalence of stroke in communities of color and the impact of stress from discrimination on health, proactive strategies to promote inclusion and equity to support diversity in perioperative neuroscience is warranted. SUMMARY: Public policy rooted in structural racism has left marginalized groups economically and educationally disadvantaged with less access to health care. Mistrust and fear from ongoing discrimination compels the neuroscience community to broaden their approach for developing a more reassuring and supportive educational environment for patients and trainees.","Theard, M.

The 3CL(pro) structure (refined to 1.94 Å) shows that the protein forms dimers. The monomers are comprised of N-terminal domains I and II, which adopt a chymotrypsin-like fold, and a C-terminal α-helical domain III. The catalytic Cys-His dyad is assisted by a complex network of interactions involving a water molecule that mediates polar contacts between the catalytic His and a conserved Asp located in the domain II-III junction and is suitably positioned to stabilize the developing positive charge of the catalytic His in the transition state during catalysis. The study also reveals the structural basis for the distinct P2 Asn-specific substrate-binding pocket of mesonivirus 3CL(pro)s.","Kanitz, Manuel; Blanck, Sandra; Heine, Andreas; Gulyaeva, Anastasia A.; Gorbalenya, Alexander E.; Ziebuhr, John; Diederich, Wibke E.",Virology,551,20

Clinical trials and ongoing vaccinations present with very high protection levels and varying degrees of side effects. However, the nature of the reported side effects remains poorly defined. Here we present evidence that LNPs used in many preclinical studies are highly inflammatory in mice. Intradermal injection of these LNPs led to rapid and robust inflammatory responses, characterized by massive neutrophil infiltration, activation of diverse inflammatory pathways, and production of various inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. The same dose of LNP delivered intranasally led to similar inflammatory responses in the lung and resulted in a high mortality rate. In summary, here we show that the LNPs used for many preclinical studies are highly inflammatory. Thus, their potent adjuvant activity and reported superiority comparing to other adjuvants in supporting the induction of adaptive immune responses could stem from their inflammatory nature. Furthermore, the preclinical LNPs are similar to the ones used for human vaccines, which could also explain the observed side effects in humans using this platform.","Ndeupen, Sonia; Qin, Zhen; Jacobsen, Sonya; Estanbouli, Henri; Bouteau, Aurélie; Igyártó, Botond Z.",bioRxiv,551,1

The COVID-19 pandemic has catalysed use of telepsychiatry and broken down barriers to use technology that existed until recently giving way to a 'can do' approach. The editorial rightly discusses accelerating use of information technology in psychiatry. This is a good time to collect global experience and this is a view from telepsychiatry use in metropolitan Melbourne, Australia. Whilst telepsychiatry has always been available, there was a notable reluctance to embrace it despite support from accrediting bodies such as the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists which endorsed the view that it can be an option when in person consults were not feasible. Like most public mental health services in Australia, our service also moved to tele psychiatry quickly after COVID-19 to provide safe consulting services. We collated some of our experiences by conducting a rapid survey, which was sent out to 40 people with 14 responses. 70% of the respondents reported the number of teleconsults had increased significantly during this time and a further 70% noted that there were fewer missed appointments and the work was generally more efficient following the transition to tele psychiatry. 79% were satisfied with the care they were able to provide. A few challenges were also encountered during this transition. Difficulty using new technology was experienced by 70% of the respondents. A plethora of platforms such as Zoom, Doxy, CoViu, etc., are available in Australia, each with their own benefits and concerns. There was lack of consensus about which platform to use and guidelines changed frequently requiring learning and relearning when switching between platforms, creating difficulty for some staff and patients alike. Other difficulties experienced by the team were maintaining therapeutic alliance. Effective communication of empathy and use of non-verbal gestures when doing teleconsults was also a challenge. Lack of data availability to do video consults for some disadvantaged patients was also noted. Training around effective use of information technology could be helpful and the survey revealed that only one out of fourteen respondents had sought such training. Suitability of patients for teleconsults is a key issue to consider. Often, the ones with anxiety and mood spectrum disorders were easier to engage compared to the psychotic or drug using patients who had limited insight. There are advantages of using video over telephone as someone who is teary or hypomanic cannot be readily identified over the latter. Another challenge was the absence of a seamless delivery method to ensure electronic prescription dispatch to the pharmacy. Faxing or emailing prescriptions not only increased the workload, but were also unreliable. We hope that adding the Australian experience with telepsychiatry during the COVID pandemic will help in planning better telepsychiatry services in the future- a future where integration of key clinical functions occur within telehealth platforms enabling delivery of accessible, seamless and safe care.

Co-morbid gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) makes asthma management more difficult due to increased symptoms. Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) drugs are effective at improving to GERD symptoms, however they have demonstrated only modest and variable effects on asthma control in the setting of co-morbid GERD. Importantly, PPI metabolism and efficacy depend on CYP2C19 genotype. The Genotype Tailored Treatment of Symptomatic Acid Reflux in Children with Uncontrolled Asthma (GenARA) study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to determine if genotype-tailored PPI dosing improves asthma symptoms among children with inadequately controlled asthma and GERD symptoms. This study has an innovative design to both assess the efficacy of genotype-tailored PPI dosing and perform pharmacokinetic modeling of the oral PPI Lansoprazole. Children ages 6-17 years old with clinician-diagnosed asthma and mild GERD symptoms will submit a saliva sample for CYP2C19 genotyping. Participants will undergo a two-step randomization to: (1) genotype-tailored versus conventional dosing of open-label oral lansoprazole for pharmacokinetic modeling, and (2) genotype-tailored lansoprazole daily versus placebo for 24 weeks to determine the effect of genotype-tailored PPI dosing on asthma control. Measures of asthma control, spirometry, and nasal washes during acute illnesses will be collected at 8-week intervals throughout the study. GenARA will better define the effects of CYP2C19 genotype on the dose response of lansoprazole in children and adolescents and assess if a novel dosing regimen improves GERD and asthma control.","Tang, Monica; Blake, Kathryn V.; Lima, John J.; Mougey, Edward B.; Franciosi, James; Schmidt, Stephan; Hossain, Md Jobayer; Cobbaert, Marjan; Fischer, Bernard M.; Lang, Jason E.",Contemporary Clinical Trials,551,0

Nevertheless, several control measures were established to control COVID-19 transmission on the campuses. To ensure compliance with these measures, a random observational survey, based on five barrier gestures, was implemented at the University of Liege (greetings without contact, hand sanitisation, following a one-way traffic flow, wearing a mask and physical distancing). Each barrier gesture was weighted, based on experts’ elicitation, and a scoring system was developed. The results were presented as a diagram (to identify the margin of improvement for each barrier gesture) and a risk management barometer. In total, 526 h of observations were performed. The study revealed that some possible improvements could be made in the management of facilities, in terms of room allocation, the functionality of hydro-alcoholic gel dispensers, floor markings and one-way traffic flow. Compliance with the barrier gestures reached an overall weighted score of 68.2 (between 0 and 100). Three barrier gestures presented a lower implementation rate and should be addressed: the use of hydro-alcoholic gel (particularly when exiting buildings), compliance with the traffic flow and the maintenance of a 1.5 m physical distance outside of the auditoriums. The methodology and tool developed in the present study can easily be applied to other settings. They were proven to be useful in managing COVID-19, as the barometer that was developed and the outcomes of this survey enabled an improved risk assessment on campuses, and identified the critical points to be addressed in any further public health communication or education messages.","Renault, Véronique; Humblet, Marie-France; Parisi, Gianni; Donneau, Anne-Françoise; Bureau, Fabrice; Gillet, Laurent; Fontaine, Sébastien; Saegerman, Claude",Int J Environ Res Public Health,551,16

This study estimated the total number of adult elective operations that would be cancelled worldwide during the 12 weeks of peak disruption due to COVID‐19. METHODS: A global expert‐response study was conducted to elicit projections for the proportion of elective surgery that would be cancelled or postponed during the 12 weeks of peak disruption. A Bayesian beta‐regression model was used to estimate 12‐week cancellation rates for 190 countries. Elective surgical case‐mix data, stratified by specialty and indication (cancer versus benign surgery), was determined. This case‐mix was applied to country‐level surgical volumes. The 12‐week cancellation rates were then applied to these figures to calculate total cancelled operations. RESULTS: The best estimate was that 28,404,603 operations would be cancelled or postponed during the peak 12 weeks of disruption due to COVID‐19 (2,367,050 operations per week). Most would be operations for benign disease (90.2%, 25,638,922/28,404,603). The overall 12‐week cancellation rate would be 72.3%. Globally, 81.7% (25,638,921/31,378,062) of benign surgery, 37.7% (2,324,069/6,162,311) of cancer surgery, and 25.4% (441,611/1,735,483) of elective Caesarean sections would be cancelled or postponed. If countries increase their normal surgical volume by 20% post‐pandemic, it would take a median 45 weeks to clear the backlog of operations resulting from COVID‐19 disruption. CONCLUSIONS: A very large number of operations will be cancelled or postponed due to disruption caused by COVID‐19. Governments should mitigate against this major burden on patients by developing recovery plans and implementing strategies to safely restore surgical activity. This article is protected by copyright.

Financial fragility was shown to be on average less influential for the well-being outcomes than financial control. Our results suggest that financial control plays a protective role for complete well-being. Less evidence in support of a harmful role of financial fragility for well-being is provided.

A point‐based scoring system of abnormal ECG findings was formed, in which 1 point each was assigned for the presence of axis deviation, arrhythmias, atrioventricular block, conduction tissue disease, QTc interval prolongation, pathological Q wave, ST‐segment change, and T‐wave change. The association between abnormal ECG scores and in‐hospital mortality was assessed in multivariable Cox regression models. RESULTS: A total of 306 patients (mean 62.84 ± 14.69 years old, 48.0% male) were included. T‐wave change (31.7%), QTc interval prolongation (30.1%), and arrhythmias (16.3%) were three most common found ECG abnormalities. 30 (9.80%) patients died during hospitalization. Abnormal ECG scores were significantly higher among non‐survivors (median 2 points vs 1 point, p < 0.001). The risk of in‐hospital death increased by a factor of 1.478 (HR 1.478, 95% CI 1.131–1.933, p = 0.004) after adjusted by age, comorbidities, cardiac injury and treatments. CONCLUSIONS: ECG abnormality was common in patients admitted for COVID‐19 and was associated with adverse in‐hospital outcome. In‐hospital mortality risk increased with increasing abnormal ECG scores.","Yang, Deyan; Li, Jing; Gao, Peng; Chen, Taibo; Cheng, Zhongwei; Cheng, Kangan; Deng, Hua; Fang, Quan; Yi, Chunfeng; Fan, Hongru; Wu, Yonghong; Li, Liwei; Fang, Yong; Tian, Guowei; Pan, Wan; Zhang, Fan",Clin Cardiol,551,16

In the following 70-day period, approximately 6000 new cases occurred, severely impacting the medical service system. This study investigated the crisis-impact on the local emergency transport system. Emergency medical service activity reports were retrospectively reviewed to determine patient demographics and initial vital signs. Delay in reaching the patient, transporting the patient to the hospital, and returning to the fire station were assessed and categorized based on patients’ initial vital signs. The study period was divided into 4 groups (1/1–2/18, 2/19–3/3, 3/4–3/31, and 4/1–04/30) and intergroup differences were analyzed. When compared to Period 1, the time-difference between the request to attend a scene and arrival at the scene was delayed in Periods 2, 3, and 4 by 4 minute 58 s, 3 minute 24 seconds, and 2 minute 20 seconds, respectively; that between arriving at the scene and at the hospital was delayed by 7 minute 43 seconds, 6 minutes 59 seconds, and 4 minutes 30 seconds, respectively; and that between arriving at the hospital and returning to the fire station was delayed by 29 minute 3 second, 25 minute 55 second, and 18 minute 44 second, respectively. In Period 2, for patients with symptoms of severe illness when compared to patients lacking such symptoms, the time-difference between the request to attend the scene and arrival at a hospital and between arrival at the hospital and returning to the fire station were 6 to 23 minute and 12 to 48 minute longer, respectively. Most of the delays impacted patients with a fever. In terms of condition, the statistical effect size for delay in transport time was from large to small: fever, hypoxia, abnormal respiratory rate, respiratory symptom, and hypotension. Outbreaks of infectious disease cause a paradoxical state in emergency medical transport systems, inducing delays in the transport of severely ill patients. Therefore, maintenance and improvement of the medical service system for both patients with infectious disease and those with other severe illnesses is required.","Kim, Hyun Soo; Jang, Tae Chang; Kim, Gyun Moo; Lee, Suk Hee; Ko, Seung Hyun; Seo, Young Woo",Medicine (Baltimore),551,20

While many countries reported increased DVA, the Netherlands did not. To understand this discrepancy and the overall impact of the lockdown on DVA support services, we interviewed DVA professionals about their experiences with DVA during the rise of COVID-19, the impact of the lockdown on clients and working conditions, and views on eHealth and online tools. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted among 16 DVA professionals with various specializations. This data was analyzed using open thematic coding and content analysis. RESULTS: Most professionals did not see an increase in DVA reports but they did notice more severe violence. They experienced less opportunities to detect DVA and worried about their clients’ wellbeing and the quality of (online) care. Furthermore, their working conditions rapidly changed, with working from home and online, and they expressed frustration, insecurity and loneliness. Professionals feel eHealth and online tools are not always suitable but they do see them as an opportunity to increase reach and maintain services when physical contact is not possible. CONCLUSION: This study suggests DVA was probably under-detected during the lockdown rather than not having increased. The Dutch system heavily relies on professionals to detect and report DVA, suggesting a need for critical evaluation of the accessibility of professional help. Professionals experienced significant challenges and should themselves be supported psychologically and in their changed work practices to maintain their ability to aid survivors.

There was a considerable variation in the number of rounded cells found in different colonies exposed to rhinovirus types 2 and 9 (RV2 and 9), human coronavirus 229 E (HCV), adenovirus type 3 (Ad3) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Smaller colonies had more rounded cells than larger colonies. Clones were established from 9 out of 11 colonies. They varied in their rate of growth and the pattern formed on a plastic surface. They varied also in their virus susceptibility particularly to “difficult” rhinoviruses such as RV9 and SF 1340. One cell clone (HL1/77 Clone 8), was highly susceptible to all these viruses. All cultures were more sensitive to RSV when maintained in F 12K medium than in MEM, whereas there was no difference for rhinoviruses. Influenza A and B and parainfluenza 3 viruses sometimes produced cytopathic effect, and always produced haemadsorption, but unlike the previous strains could not be passed serially and presumably produced little infections virus. All clones were rather insusceptible to Ad3; but the virus could be passed, whereas coxsackie virus B3 produced no CPE. Substantial yields of coronavirus and rhinovirus were obtained in gelatin sponge cultures. Two “very difficult” respiratory viruses which had just been adapted to tissue culture; namely, HS rhinovirus and JK coronavirus grew in 7 of 9 and in 6 of 9 clones respectively.","Tyrrell, D. A.

Here we present twelve complete autopsies, including two rapid autopsies of young patients where the cause of death was COVID-19 ARDS. The main virus induced pathology was in the lung parenchyma and not in the airways. Most coagulation events occurred in the intra-alveolar and not in the intra-vascular space and the few thrombi were mainly composed of aggregated thrombocytes. The dominant inflammatory response was the massive accumulation of CD163 + macrophages and the disappearance of T killer, NK and B-cells. The virus was replicating in the pneumocytes and macrophages but not in bronchial epithelium, endothelium, pericytes or stromal cells. The lung consolidations were produced by a massive regenerative response, stromal and epithelial proliferation and neovascularization.

B. multilineatus (Falkenström, 1922) is shown to be widely distributed in the Pyrenees, where it is the only species known to occur. The chromosomes of all five west European species are found to have, in addition their different numbers of chromosomes, differences in the number and locations of secondary constrictions, and in some cases, the number of chromosomes with clear centromeric C-bands. The level of differences between the chromosomes of the species is in stark contrast with the very slight genetic (DNA) differences between them and this suggests that chromosome differentiation may have been a driver of speciation. Two of the species, B. griseostriatus (De Geer, 1774) and B. multilineatus, have distributions extending northwards as far as Arctic Scandinavia. It is pointed out that, while these northern areas now constitute the major portions of their ranges, they must be of fairly recent origins as most of the area would have been covered by ice sheets and therefore not habitable during the glacial maximum of the Last Glaciation. This contrasts with the situation in the area of the Central European mountains where fossil faunas, including Boreonectes, are known.

However, there are few randomized control trials studying medical cannabis indicating expert guidance on how to dose and administer medical cannabis safely and effectively is needed. METHODS: Using a multistage modified Delphi process, twenty global experts across nine countries developed consensus-based recommendations on how to dose and administer medical cannabis in patients with chronic pain. RESULTS: There was consensus that medical cannabis may be considered for patients experiencing neuropathic, inflammatory, nociplastic, and mixed pain. Three treatment protocols were developed. A routine protocol where the clinician initiates the patient on a CBD-predominant variety at a dose of 5 mg CBD twice daily and titrates the CBD-predominant dose by 10 mg every 2 to 3 days until the patient reaches their goals, or up to 40 mg/day. At a CBD-predominant dose of 40 mg/day, clinicians may consider adding THC at 2.5 mg and titrate by 2.5 mg every 2 to 7 days until a maximum daily dose of 40 mg/day of THC. A conservative protocol where the clinician initiates the patient on a CBD-predominant variety at a dose of 5 mg once daily and titrates the CBD-predominant dose by 10 mg every 2 to 3 days until the patient reaches their goals, or up to 40 mg/day. At a CBD-predominant dose of 40 mg/day, clinicians may consider adding THC at 1 mg/day and titrate by 1 mg every 7 days until a maximum daily dose of 40 mg/day of THC. A rapid protocol where the clinician initiates the patient on a balanced THC:CBD variety at 2.5–5 mg of each cannabinoid once or twice daily and titrates by 2.5–5 mg of each cannabinoid every 2 to 3 days until the patient reaches his/her goals or to a maximum THC dose of 40 mg/day.

Such aspects as e-readiness, benefits and challenges of online education were well-researched under normal situations, but fully online language teaching on a large-scale in emergencies may tell a different story. A survey of 2310 non-English-major college students and 149 English teachers from three types of twelve higher education institutions in Wuhan was conducted to evaluate their readiness for online English education during the COVID-19 pandemic, to figure out challenges encountered by them and to draw implications for future online college English education. Quantitative statistics gathered using two readiness scales adapted from previous studies showed that both cohorts were slightly below the ready level for the unexpected online transition of college English education. The overall level of readiness for students was 3.68 out of a score of 5, and that for teachers was 3.70. Individual differences were explored and reported. An analysis of qualitative results summarized six categories of challenges encountered by the students, i.e. technical challenges, challenges concerning learning process, learning environment, self-control, efficiency and effectiveness, and health concern. Though the students reported the highest level of readiness in technology access, they were most troubled by technical problems during online study. For teachers, among three types of challenges, they were most frustrated by pedagogical ones, especially students’ disengagement in online class. The survey brought insights for online college English education development. Institutions should take the initiative and continue promoting the development of online college English education, because a majority of the respondents reported their willingness and intention to continue learning/teaching English in online or blended courses in the post-pandemic period. They are supposed to remove technical barriers for teachers and students, and assess the readiness levels of both cohorts before launching English courses online. Institutions should also arrange proper training for instructors involved, especially about pedagogical issues.

A formulation of niclosamide, a potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 agent and a broad-spectrum antiviral treatment candidate, optimized for inhalation and intranasal administration (UNI91104) was developed. METHODS: We conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, single-centre, dose-ascending Phase 1 trial to assess the safety of UNI91104 in Denmark (NCT04576312). Healthy volunteers were randomly assigned to a ascending single dose in cohort 1–4 and five doses over 2.5 days in cohort 5. Inclusion criteria included a minimum 80% of predicted lung function. Exclusion criteria included severe, clinically significant allergies and current acute or chronic condition especially airway diseases. Safety was evaluated through adverse events (AEs) and pulmonary function tests including forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) tests. The primary endpoints were defined as the frequency of reported AEs and the change of safety variables relative to pre-dose. Data from all enroled healthy volunteers receiving any amount of IMP was included in the primary analyses. The pharmacokinetics of UNI91104 was determined. FINDINGS: The trial was conducted between 29 June 2020 and 08 August 2020. Thirty-four healthy volunteers received UNI91104 and ten placebo. No serious AEs or discontinuation were reported. Mild irritation in the upper respiratory tract following inhalation of UNI91104 was reported as most frequent AE (45 events in 26 healthy volunteers, 59% of all healthy volunteers). Nasal application was well-tolerated. There was no evidence of difference in the change of mean levels of pulmonary function tests between active and placebo group across all cohorts. Five healthy volunteers (11.4%) (1 on placebo) had signs of increased transient FeNO and 4 on active (9.1%) experienced asymptomatic drops in FEV1, which resolved spontaneously or were reversible with a β2-agonist. Niclosamide exhibited dose-proportional pharmacokinetics following inhalation and intranasal administration. INTERPRETATION: UNI91104, a promising candidate for inhalation and intranasal therapy against COVID-19 and other viral respiratory tract infections is well-tolerated in healthy volunteers and warrants further testing in patient trials. FUNDING: The study was funded by Innovationsfonden Denmark and UNION therapeutics.","Backer, Vibeke; Sjöbring, Ulf; Sonne, Jesper; Weiss, Anne; Hostrup, Morten; Johansen, Helle Krogh; Becker, Victoria; Sonne, David P.; Balchen, Torben; Jellingsø, Mads; Sommer, Morten Otto Alexander",Lancet Reg Health Eur,551,7

The uncertainties surrounding the pandemic have also led to multifaceted mental health concerns, which can be exacerbated with precautionary measures such as social distancing and self-quarantining, as well as societal impacts such as economic downturn and job loss. Despite noting this as a “mental health tsunami”, the psychological effects of the COVID-19 crisis remain unexplored at scale. Consequently, public health stakeholders are currently limited in identifying ways to provide timely and tailored support during these circumstances. OBJECTIVE: Our study aims to provide insights regarding people’s psychosocial concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic by leveraging social media data. We aim to study the temporal and linguistic changes in symptomatic mental health and support expressions in the pandemic context. METHODS: We obtained about 60 million Twitter streaming posts originating from the United States from March 24 to May 24, 2020, and compared these with about 40 million posts from a comparable period in 2019 to attribute the effect of COVID-19 on people’s social media self-disclosure. Using these data sets, we studied people’s self-disclosure on social media in terms of symptomatic mental health concerns and expressions of support. We employed transfer learning classifiers that identified the social media language indicative of mental health outcomes (anxiety, depression, stress, and suicidal ideation) and support (emotional and informational support). We then examined the changes in psychosocial expressions over time and language, comparing the 2020 and 2019 data sets. RESULTS: We found that all of the examined psychosocial expressions have significantly increased during the COVID-19 crisis—mental health symptomatic expressions have increased by about 14%, and support expressions have increased by about 5%, both thematically related to COVID-19. We also observed a steady decline and eventual plateauing in these expressions during the COVID-19 pandemic, which may have been due to habituation or due to supportive policy measures enacted during this period. Our language analyses highlighted that people express concerns that are specific to and contextually related to the COVID-19 crisis. CONCLUSIONS: We studied the psychosocial effects of the COVID-19 crisis by using social media data from 2020, finding that people’s mental health symptomatic and support expressions significantly increased during the COVID-19 period as compared to similar data from 2019. However, this effect gradually lessened over time, suggesting that people adapted to the circumstances and their “new normal.” Our linguistic analyses revealed that people expressed mental health concerns regarding personal and professional challenges, health care and precautionary measures, and pandemic-related awareness. This study shows the potential to provide insights to mental health care and stakeholders and policy makers in planning and implementing measures to mitigate mental health risks amid the health crisis.","Saha, Koustuv; Torous, John; Caine, Eric D; De Choudhury, Munmun",J Med Internet Res,551,20

Traditionally, AMPK is a key energy regulator of cell growth and proliferation, host autophagy, stress responses, metabolic reprogramming, mitochondrial homeostasis, fatty acid β-oxidation and host immune function. In this review, we highlight the modulation of host AMPK by various viruses under physiological conditions. These intracellular pathogens trigger metabolic changes altering AMPK signaling activity that then facilitates or inhibits viral replication.

In addition to A. lancea monoculture (AL), five intercropping combinations were planted: Zea mays L. (ZM) + A. lancea, Tagetes erecta L. (TE) + A. lancea, Calendula officinalis L.

The survival and average rhizome weight of A. lancea was higher in the ZM, CO, and TE treatments than in the monoculture treatment, and the average plant height was higher in all intercropping treatments than in the monoculture. The volatile oil content of A. lancea from the ZM and CO treatments was significantly improved relative to that of monoculture plants. The volatile oil harvest was higher in the ZM, CO, and TE treatments than in the monoculture. We conclude that intercropping is an effective way to increase the survival and yield of A. lancea.

With limited treatments available, vaccination remains an effective strategy to counter transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2). Recent discussions concerning vaccination strategies have focused on identifying vaccine platforms, number of doses, route of administration, and time to reach peak immunity against SARS CoV-2. Here, we generated a single dose, fast-acting vesicular stomatitis virus-based vaccine derived from the licensed Ebola virus (EBOV) vaccine rVSV-ZEBOV, expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and the EBOV glycoprotein (VSV-SARS2-EBOV). Rhesus macaques vaccinated intramuscularly (IM) with a single dose of VSV-SARS2-EBOV were protected within 10 days and did not show signs of COVID-19 pneumonia. In contrast, intranasal (IN) vaccination resulted in limited immunogenicity and enhanced COVID-19 pneumonia compared to control animals. While IM and IN vaccination both induced neutralizing antibody titers, only IM vaccination resulted in a significant cellular immune response. RNA sequencing data bolstered these results by revealing robust activation of the innate and adaptive immune transcriptional signatures in the lungs of IM-vaccinated animals only. Overall, the data demonstrates that VSV-SARS2-EBOV is a potent single-dose COVID-19 vaccine candidate that offers rapid protection based on the protective efficacy observed in our study.","Furuyama, Wakako; Shifflett, Kyle; Pinski, Amanda N.; Griffin, Amanda J.; Feldmann, Friederike; Okumura, Atsushi; Gourdine, Tylisha; Jankeel, Allen; Lovaglio, Jamie; Hanley, Patrick W.; Thomas, Tina; Clancy, Chad S.; Messaoudi, Ilhem; O’Donnell, Kyle L.; Marzi, Andrea",bioRxiv,551,10

DESIGN: Technical step-by-step surgical video description (educative video) SETTING: University Tertiary Hospital. Institutional Review Board ruled that approval was not required for this study. Endometriosis affects the bowel in 3% to 37% of all cases, and in 90% of these cases, the rectum or sigmoid colon is also involved. Infiltration up to the rectal mucosa and invasion of >50% of the circumference have been suggested as an indication for bowel resection [1]. Apart from general risks (bleeding, infection, direct organ injuries) and bowel and bladder dysfunctions, anastomotic leakage is one of the most severe complications. In women with bowel and vaginal mucosa endometriosis involvement, there is a risk of rectovaginal fistula after concomitant rectum and vagina resections. Hence, for lower colorectal anastomosis, the use of temporary protective ileostomy is usually recommended to prevent these complications but carries on stoma-related risks, such as hernia, retraction, dehydration, prolapse, and necrosis. Ghost ileostomy is a specific technique, first described in 2010, that gives an easy and safe option to prevent anastomotic leakage with maximum preservation of the patient's quality of life [2]. In case of anastomotic leakage, the ghost (or virtual) ileostomy is converted, under local anesthesia, into a loop (real) ileostomy by extracting the isolated loop through an adequate abdominal wall opening. In principle, avoiding readmission for performing the closure of the ileostomy, with all the costs related, means a considerable saving for the hospital management. Also, applying a protective rectal tube in intestinal anastomosis may have a beneficial effect [3]. These options are performed by general surgeons in oncological scenarios, but their use in endometriosis has never been described. INTERVENTIONS: In a 32-year-old woman with intense dysmenorrhea, deep dyspareunia, dyschesia, and cyclic rectal bleeding, a complete laparoscopic approach was performed using blunt and sharp dissection with cold scissors, bipolar dissector and a 5-mm LigaSure Advance (Covidien, Valley lab, Norwalk, Connecticut). An extensive adhesiolysis restoring the pelvic anatomy and endometriosis excision was done. Afterward, the segmental bowel resection was performed using linear and circular endo-anal stapler technique with immediate end-to-end bowel anastomosis and transit reconstitution. Once anastomosis was done, the terminal ileal loop was identified, and a window was made in the adjacent mesentery. Then, an elastic tape (vessel loop) was passed around the ileal loop, brought out of the abdomen through the right iliac fossa 5-mm port site incision and, fixed to the abdominal wall using nonabsorbable stitches. Finally, a trans-anal tube was placed for 5 days. The patient was discharged on the fifth day postoperatively without any complications. The tape was removed 10 days after surgery, and the loop dropped back. Two months after the intervention, the patient remains asymptomatic. CONCLUSION: Ghost ileostomy is a simple, safe, and feasible technique available in the setting of lower colorectal anastomosis following bowel endometriosis resection.","Ferreira, Hélder; Smith, Andres Vigueras; Vilaça, Jaime",J Minim Invasive Gynecol,551,6

However, in programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting(2), a specific subversion of frame maintenance takes place, wherein the ribosome is forced to shift one nucleotide backwards into an overlapping reading frame and to translate an entirely new sequence of amino acids. This process is indispensable in the replication of numerous viral pathogens, including HIV and the coronavirus associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome(3), and is also exploited in the expression of several cellular genes(4). Frameshifting is promoted by an mRNA signal composed of two essential elements: a heptanucleotide ‘slippery’ sequence(5) and an adjacent mRNA secondary structure, most often an mRNA pseudoknot(6). How these components operate together to manipulate the ribosome is unknown. Here we describe the observation of a ribosome–mRNA pseudoknot complex that is stalled in the process of -1 frameshifting. Cryoelectron microscopic imaging of purified mammalian 80S ribosomes from rabbit reticulocytes paused at a coronavirus pseudoknot reveals an intermediate of the frameshifting process. From this it can be seen how the pseudoknot interacts with the ribosome to block the mRNA entrance channel, compromising the translocation process and leading to a spring-like deformation of the P-site transfer RNA. In addition, we identify movements of the likely eukaryotic ribosomal helicase and confirm a direct interaction between the translocase eEF2 and the P-site tRNA. Together, the structural changes provide a mechanical explanation of how the pseudoknot manipulates the ribosome into a different reading frame.

The critical components of SARS-CoV-2 are the spike protein (S-protein) and the main protease (M(pro)). M(pro) is required for the maturation of the various polyproteins involved in replication and transcription. S-protein helps the SARS-CoV-2 to enter the host cells through the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Since ACE2 is required for the binding of SARS-CoV-2 on the host cells, ACE2 inhibitors and blockers have got wider attention, in addition to S-protein and M(pro) modulators as potential therapeutics for COVID-19. So far, no specific drugs have shown promising therapeutic potential against COVID-19. The current study was undertaken to evaluate the therapeutic potential of traditional medicinal plants against COVID-19. The bioactives from the medicinal plants, along with standard drugs, were screened for their binding against S-protein, M(pro) and ACE2 targets using molecular docking followed by molecular dynamics. Based on the higher binding affinity compared with standard drugs, bioactives were selected and further analyzed for their pharmacological properties such as drug-likeness, ADME/T-test, biological activities using in silico tools. The binding energies of several bioactives analyzed with target proteins were relatively comparable and even better than the standard drugs. Based on Lipinski factors and lower binding energies, seven bioactives were further analyzed for their pharmacological and biological characteristics. The selected bioactives were found to have lower toxicity with a higher GI absorption rate and potent anti-inflammatory and anti-viral activities against targets of COVID-19. Therefore, the bioactives from these medicinal plants can be further developed as phytopharmaceuticals for the effective treatment of COVID-19.","Mondal, Priya; Natesh, Jagadish; Abdul Salam, Abdul Ajees; Thiyagarajan, Saravanamuthu; Meeran, Syed Musthapa",Journal of biomolecular structure & dynamics,551,20

Informed by classical principles of well-being and contemporary work theory, Eudaimonia integrates concerns for individual wellness and efficiency to create an environment that fosters productivity. This layout arranges a work environment into purposeful spaces, each hosting tasks of varying degrees of intensity. The improved design addresses the radiologist’s work requirements while also alleviating cognitive and physical stress, fatigue, and burnout. This new layout organizes the reading room into separate areas, each with a distinct purpose intended to support the range of radiologists’ work, from consultation with other health care providers to reading images without interruption.

One of the major complications of this disease is the rapid and dangerous pulmonary deterioration that can lead to critical pneumonia conditions, resulting in death. The current healthcare system around the world faces the potential problem of lacking resources to assist a large number of patients at the same time; then, the non-critical patients are mostly referred to perform self-isolation/quarantine at home. This pandemic has placed new demands on the health systems world, asking for novel, rapid and secure ways to monitor patients in order to detect and quickly report patient’s symptoms to the healthcare provider, even if they are not in the hospital. While tremendous efforts have been done to develop technologies to detect the virus, create the vaccine, and stop the spread of the disease, it is also important to develop IoT technologies that can help track and monitor diagnosed COVID-19 patients from their homes. In this paper, we explore the possibility of monitoring respiration rates (RR) of COVID-19 patients using a widely-available technology at home – WiFi. Using the at-home WiFi signals, we propose Wi-COVID, a non-invasive and non-wearable technology to monitor the patient and track RR for the healthcare provider. We first introduce the currently available applications that can be done using WiFi signals. Then, we propose the framework scheme for an end-to-end non-invasive monitoring platform of the COVID-19 patients using WiFi. Finally, we present some preliminary results of the proposed framework. We envision the proposed platform as a life-changing technology that leverages WiFi technology as a non-wearable and non-invasive way to monitor COVID-19 patients at home.","Li, Fangyu; Valero, Maria; Shahriar, Hossain; Khan, Rumi Ahmed; Ahamed, Sheikh Iqbal",Smart Health (Amst),551,28

Current annotation systems suffer from a high-resource utilization and poor scalability limiting real-world integration with CDS. A potential solution to mitigate these issues is to use the rule-based gazetteer developed at our institution. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Performance, resource utilization, and runtime of the rule-based gazetteer were compared with five annotation systems: BioMedICUS, cTAKES, MetaMap, CLAMP, and MedTagger. RESULTS: This rule-based gazetteer was the fastest, had a low resource footprint, and similar performance for weighted microaverage and macroaverage measures of precision, recall, and f1-score compared to other annotation systems. DISCUSSION: Opportunities to increase its performance include fine-tuning lexical rules for symptom identification. Additionally, it could run on multiple compute nodes for faster runtime. CONCLUSION: This rule-based gazetteer overcame key technical limitations facilitating real-time symptomatology identification for COVID-19 and integration of unstructured data elements into our CDS. It is ideal for large-scale deployment across a wide variety of healthcare settings for surveillance of acute COVID-19 symptoms for integration into prognostic modeling.

On the other hand, the indiscriminate use of antimicrobials leads to harms, many of which may be exaggerated in the critically ill population. The current method of diagnosing infection in the intensive care unit relies heavily on clinical gestalt; however, this approach is plagued by biases. Therefore, a reliable, independent biomarker holds promise in the accurate determination of infection. We discuss currently used host biomarkers used in the intensive care unit and review new and emerging approaches to biomarker discovery. RECENT FINDINGS: White cell count (including total white cell count, left shift, and the neutrophil-leucocyte ratio), C-reactive protein, and procalcitonin are the most common host diagnostic biomarkers for sepsis used in current clinical practice. However, their utility in the initial diagnosis of infection, and their role in the subsequent decision to commence treatment, remains limited. Novel approaches to biomarker discovery that are currently being investigated include combination biomarkers, host ‘sepsis signatures’ based on differential gene expression, site-specific biomarkers, biomechanical assays, and incorporation of new and pre-existing host biomarkers into machine learning algorithms. SUMMARY: To date, no single reliable independent biomarker of infection exists. Whilst new approaches to biomarker discovery hold promise, their clinical utility may be limited if previous mistakes that have afflicted sepsis biomarker research continue to be repeated.","Heffernan, Aaron J.; Denny, Kerina J.",Curr Infect Dis Rep,551,8

These effects were investigated against the background of the Health Belief Model (HBM). A convenience sample of N = 325 participants completed an online survey including an ad-hoc questionnaire measuring the HBM core factors: Perceived health threat (susceptibility and severity of getting infected), and perceived quarantine benefits and costs. Self-efficacy and perceived social pressure were also measured. Based on reviews regarding pandemic outbreaks, quarantine benefits were conceptualized as the perceived effectiveness and solidary contribution of self-isolating in line with the quarantine protocols. Quarantine “psychosocial” costs were conceptualized as a composite of perceived boredom, loneliness, and economic concerns. Findings revealed an asymmetrical pattern of results so that (i) people at higher risk were more distressed by the perceived severity of getting infected whereas people at lower risk were more distressed by the psychosocial costs. Moreover, (ii) resilience and optimism were more “protective” against distress within the lower and higher risk groups, respectively. In addition, (iii) quarantine benefits and self-efficacy promoted the intention to self-isolate within both groups. However, (iv) optimism hindered such intention. This finding is discussed in the light of links between dispositional optimism and optimistic bias; the underestimation of experiencing negative events, which can relax the perceived health risk. Based on these findings, communication campaigns should prioritize information about the effectiveness of the implemented preventive behaviors rather than the costs of not implementing them, and be cautionary in encouraging excessive optimism.","Cervera-Torres, Sergio; Ruiz-Fernández, Susana; Godbersen, Hendrik; Massó, Lena; Martínez-Rubio, David; Pintado-Cucarella, Sheila; Baños, Rosa M.",Front Psychol,551,6

Four themes arose from these interviews: (a) the commonality of sexual activity despite COVID-19 risk; (b) sexual motivations rooted in emotions such as desire, longing for connection, and the wish to live fully in the face of the pandemic; (c) varied perceptions regarding the possibility of preventing COVID-19 infection; and (d) risk assessment and management strategies that were similar to those used for HIV prevention. Assuming or calling for abstinence neglects questions of risk navigation and omits the experiences of large swaths of the population.

Early research found substantial economic savings for these technologies, but as the open source design paradigm has grown by orders of magnitude it is possible that the savings observed in the early work was isolated to special cases. Today there are examples of open source technology for science in the vast majority of disciplines and several resources dedicated specifically to publishing them. Do the tremendous economic savings observed earlier hold today? To answer that question, this study evaluates free and open source technologies in the two repositories compared to proprietary functionally-equivalent tools as a function of their use of Arduino-based electronics, RepRap-class 3-D printing, as well as the combination of the two. The results of the review find overwhelming evidence for a wide range of scientific tools, that open source technologies provide economic savings of 87% compared to equivalent or lesser proprietary tools. These economic savings increased slightly to 89% for those that used Arduino technology and even more to 92% for those that used RepRap-class 3-D printing. Combining both Arduino and 3-D printing the savings averaged 94% for free and open source tools over commercial equivalents. The results provide strong evidence for financial support of open source hardware and software development for the sciences. Given the overwhelming economic advantages of free and open source technologies, it appears financially responsible to divert funding of proprietary scientific tools and their development in favor of FOSH.

Overall test positivity rate was 0.9%; 2.6% of students tested positive. Uptake and acceptability of regular symptom and exposure surveys was high; 98% of students completed at least one survey, and average completion rate was 67% (Median: 74%, IQR: 39%) for daily reporting of symptoms and 68% (Median: 75%, IQR: 40%) for weekly reporting of exposures. Of symptom-triggered tests, 5% were PCR-positive; of exposure-triggered tests, 10% were PCR-positive. The integrated study database augmented traditional contact tracing during an outbreak; 17 potentially exposed students were contacted the following day and sent testing notifications. At study end, 81% of students selected their desire “to contribute to UC Berkeley’s response to COVID-19” as a reason for their participation in the Safe Campus study. CONCLUSIONS: Our results illustrate the synergy created by bringing together a student-friendly, harm reduction approach to COVID-19 testing with an integrated data system and analytics. We recommend the use of a confidential, consequence-free, incentive-based daily symptom and exposure reporting system, coupled with low-barrier, easy access, no stigma testing. Testing should be implemented alongside a system that integrates multiple data sources to effectively trigger testing notifications to those at higher risk of infection and encourages students to come in for low-barrier testing when needed.","Packel, Laura; Reingold, Arthur; Hunter, Lauren; Facente, Shelley; Li, Yi; Harte, Anna; Nicolette, Guy; Urnov, Fyodor D.; Lu, Michael; Petersen, Maya",PLoS One,551,1

The growing use of information and communication technologies (ICT), together with a new approach to work aimed at ensuring the safety of health care professionals and patients alike, has allowed us to maintain the quality of care while ensuring biosecurity. The application of ICT to health care (eHealth) aims to significantly improve the quality, access to, and effectiveness of medical care. In fact, the expanded use of ICT has been recognized as a key, cost-effective priority for health care by the World Health Organisation. The medical speciality of radiation oncology is closely linked to technology and as a consequence of coronavirus disease 2019, ICT has been widely employed by radiation oncologists worldwide, providing new opportunities for interaction among professionals, including telemedicine and e-learning, while also minimizing treatment interruptions. Future research should concentrate on this emerging paradigm, which offers new opportunities, including faster and more diverse exchange of scientific knowledge, organizational improvements, and more efficient workflows. Moreover, these efficiencies will allow professionals to dedicate more time to patient care, with a better work-life balance. In the present editorial, we discuss the opportunities provided by these digital tools, as well as barriers to their implementation, and a vision of the future.","Fernández, Castalia; Ruiz, Virginia; Couñago, Felipe",World J Clin Oncol,551,24

We developed a tool to estimate the volume of medicines and budget requirements to provide chemotherapy to children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). DESIGN: Development and application of an estimation tool. SETTING: Paediatric oncology hospital departments in Thailand. PARTICIPANTS: 318 children aged 0–14 years diagnosed with ALL and 215 children with undiagnosed ALL. INTERVENTIONS: Estimates of volume and budget requirements for administering a full course of chemotherapy for ALL and a further course for children who relapse, according to National Treatment Guidelines. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome measures were the volume (mg) and cost (US$) of medicines needed to treat children with ALL. For medicines whose main indication is paediatric ALL (asparaginase and 6-mercaptopurine), we estimated the difference between volume needed and actual sales in 2017 (secondary outcome). RESULTS: Ten anticancer medicines and four chemoprotective agents are needed for the treatment of paediatric ALL according to the Thai treatment guidelines. Of these 14 medicines, 13 are included in the WHO essential medicines list for children. All are available as generics. We estimated that essential chemotherapy and chemoprotective agents to treat all children diagnosed with ALL in Thailand in 2017 would cost US$ 814 952 (US$ 1 365 422 for diagnosed and undiagnosed children), which corresponds to 0.005% (0.008%) of the country’s total health expenditure. The volumes of asparaginase and 6-mercaptopurine available on the Thai market in 2017 were more than sufficient (2.3 and 1.5 times the amounts needed, respectively) to treat all children diagnosed with ALL. CONCLUSIONS: Procuring sufficient quantities of essential medicines to treat children with ALL requires relatively modest resources. Medicine cost should not be a major barrier to ALL treatment in similar settings.","Sruamsiri, Rosarin; Ferrario, Alessandra; Ross-Degnan, Dennis; Denburg, Avram E; Frazier, A Lindsay; Gupta, Sumit; Ward, Zachary J; Yeh, Jennifer M; Wagner, Anita Katharina",BMJ Open,551,5

To justify and target ongoing investment, quantification of impact and identification of remaining high-risk areas are needed. We aimed to assess regional progress towards these targets. METHODS: We did a continental-scale ecological analysis using a Bayesian space–time hierarchical model to estimate the effects of known environmental, socioeconomic, and control-related factors on the prevalence of soil-transmitted helminths, and we mapped the probability that implementation units had achieved moderate-to-heavy intensity infection prevalence of less than 2% among children aged 5–14 years between Jan 1, 2000, and Dec 31, 2018. FINDINGS: We incorporated data from 26 304 georeferenced surveys, spanning 3096 (60%) of the 5183 programmatic implementation units. Our findings suggest a reduction in the prevalence of soil-transmitted helminths in children aged 5–14 years in sub-Saharan Africa, from 44% in 2000 to 13% in 2018, driven by sustained delivery of preventive chemotherapy, improved sanitation, and economic development. Nevertheless, 1301 (25%) of 5183 implementation units still had an estimated prevalence of moderate-to-heavy intensity infection exceeding the 2% target threshold in 2018, largely concentrated in nine countries (in 1026 [79%] of 1301 implementation units): Nigeria, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Cameroon, Angola, Mozambique, Madagascar, Equatorial Guinea, and Gabon. INTERPRETATION: Our estimates highlight the areas to target and strengthen interventions, and the areas where data gaps remain. If elimination of soil-transmitted helminths as a public health problem is to be achieved in sub-Saharan Africa by 2030, continued investment in treatment and prevention activities are essential to ensure that no areas are left behind.

Healthy young adults are accurate in estimating their action boundaries and can flexibly update them to accommodate stable changes in their action capabilities. However, there are conditions in which motor abilities are subject to variability over time such as in Parkinson’s disease (PD). PD impairs the ability to perform actions and can lead to variability in perceptual-motor experience, but the effect on the perceptions of their action boundaries remains unknown. This study investigated the influence of altered perceptual-motor experience during PD, on the perceptions of action boundaries for reaching, grasping, and aperture passing. Thirty participants with mild-to-moderate idiopathic PD and 26 healthy older adults provided estimates of their reaching, grasping, and aperture-passing ability. Participants’ estimates were compared with their actual capabilities. There was no evidence that individuals with PD’s perceptions were less accurate than those of healthy controls. Furthermore, there was some evidence for more conservative estimates than seen in young healthy adults in reaching (both groups) and aperture passing (PD group). This suggests that the ability to judge action capabilities is preserved in mild to moderate PD.

The final vaccine construct comprises of an adjuvant at the N terminal, Cytotoxic T Lymphocyte and Helper T Lymphocyte epitopes. The construct showed potential antigenicity and was non-allergic. The molecular docking of the refined, validated tertiary structure model of the vaccine was performed with immune-stimulatory Toll Like Receptors (TLR), TLR-2,3,4. The study of binding energetics of the docked complexes revealed binding interactions of receptor with vaccine. The immune simulation of the vaccine even confirmed the initiation of elevated host immune responses. The efficient translation of the vaccine in an expression vector was confirmed with in silico cloning approach.

We aim to investigate the potential of deep transfer learning to predict COVID-19 infection using chest computed tomography (CT) and x-ray images. Approach: Regions of interest (ROI) corresponding to ground-glass opacities (GGO), consolidations, and pleural effusions were labeled in 100 axial lung CT images from 60 COVID-19-infected subjects. These segmented regions were then employed as an additional input to six deep convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures (AlexNet, DenseNet, GoogleNet, NASNet-Mobile, ResNet18, and DarkNet), pretrained on natural images, to differentiate between COVID-19 and normal CT images. We also explored the model’s ability to classify x-ray images as COVID-19, non-COVID-19 pneumonia, or normal. Performance on test images was measured with global accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Results: When using raw CT images as input to the tested models, the highest accuracy of 82% and AUC of 88.16% is achieved. Incorporating the three ROIs as an additional model inputs further boosts performance to an accuracy of 82.30% and an AUC of 90.10% (DarkNet). For x-ray images, we obtained an outstanding AUC of 97% for classifying COVID-19 versus normal versus other. Combing chest CT and x-ray images, DarkNet architecture achieves the highest accuracy of 99.09% and AUC of 99.89% in classifying COVID-19 from non-COVID-19. Our results confirm the ability of deep CNNs with transfer learning to predict COVID-19 in both chest CT and x-ray images.

Screen time, one of the most documented reasons for the obesogenic environment, enhances childhood obesity, since advertisements for unhealthy food products are still broadcast on channels for children. This is presently one of the main challenges for the government in Spain, since the current laws and obligations are not updated. This study aims to analyze food advertising aimed at children on Spanish television in 2013 and 2018 on children’s and general channels to test the effect of laws and obligations over time. In total, we viewed 512 h of the most viewed channels, two children’s and two general channels, during the week and on weekends during specific periods of 2013 and 2018. Food advertising was categorized as core, non-core, and other food advertisement (CFA, NCFA, and OFA, respectively) according to the nutritional profile. A total of 2935 adverts were analyzed, 1263 in 2013 and 1672 in 2018. A higher proportion of NCFAs were broadcast on children’s channels than in prior years, rising from 52.2% to 69.8% (p < 0.001). Nowadays, the risk of watching NCFAs on children’s channels compared to general channels turns out to be higher (Odds ratio > 2.5; p < 0.001), due to exposure to adverts for high-sugar and high-fat foods such as cakes, muffins, cookies, and fried and frozen meals rich in fat. In conclusion, the trends of nutritional profiles in food advertising on television are worsening over time, since the prevalence of NCFAs was higher in 2018 than in 2013. Currently, CFAs are not mainly broadcast on children’s channels, confirming high-risk exposure to non-core food advertising by watching them. Thus, food advertising laws and obligations should be adapted to increase compliance.","Campos, Daniel; Escudero-Marín, Mireia; Snitman, Camila M.; Torres-Espínola, Francisco J.; Azaryah, Hatim; Catena, Andrés; Campoy, Cristina",Children (Basel),551,1

There are ongoing research studies to develop effective therapeutics and vaccines against COVID-19 using various methods and many results have been published. The structure-based drug design of SARS-CoV-2-related proteins is promising, however, reliable information regarding the structural and intra- and intermolecular interactions is required. We have conducted studies based on the fragment molecular orbital (FMO) method for calculating the electronic structures of protein complexes and analyzing their quantitative molecular interactions. This enables us to extensively analyze the molecular interactions in residues or functional group units acting inside the protein complexes. Such precise interaction data are available in the FMO database (FMODB) (https://drugdesign.riken.jp/FMODB/). Since April 2020, we have performed several FMO calculations on the structures of SARS-CoV-2-related proteins registered in the Protein Data Bank.

While ecological studies show higher burdens of COVID-19 mortality in areas with higher rates of poverty, little is known about social determinants of COVID-19 mortality at the individual level. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We estimated the proportions of COVID-19 deaths by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and comorbid conditions using their reported univariate proportions among COVID-19 deaths and correlations among these variables in the general population from the 2017–2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). We used these proportions to randomly sample individuals from NHANES. We analyzed the distributions of COVID-19 deaths by race/ethnicity, income, education level, and veteran status. We analyzed the association of these characteristics with mortality by logistic regression. Summary demographics of deaths include mean age 71.6 years, 45.9% female, and 45.1% non-Hispanic white. We found that disproportionate deaths occurred among individuals with nonwhite race/ethnicity (54.8% of deaths, 95% CI 49.0%–59.6%, p < 0.001), individuals with income below the median (67.5%, 95% CI 63.4%–71.5%, p < 0.001), individuals with less than a high school level of education (25.6%, 95% CI 23.4% –27.9%, p < 0.001), and veterans (19.5%, 95% CI 15.8%–23.4%, p < 0.001). Except for veteran status, these characteristics are significantly associated with COVID-19 mortality in multiple logistic regression. Limitations include the lack of institutionalized people in the sample (e.g., nursing home residents and incarcerated persons), the need to use comorbidity data collected from outside the US, and the assumption of the same correlations among variables for the noninstitutionalized population and COVID-19 decedents. CONCLUSIONS: Substantial inequalities in COVID-19 mortality are likely, with disproportionate burdens falling on those who are of racial/ethnic minorities, are poor, have less education, and are veterans. Healthcare systems must ensure adequate access to these groups. Public health measures should specifically reach these groups, and data on social determinants should be systematically collected from people with COVID-19.","Seligman, Benjamin; Ferranna, Maddalena; Bloom, David E.",PLoS Med,551,20

Based on the unique affinity between dermatan sulfate and autoantigens, we identified 348 proteins from human lung A549 cells, of which 198 are known targets of autoantibodies. Comparison with current COVID data identified 291 proteins that are altered at protein or transcript level in SARS-CoV-2 infection, with 191 being known autoantigens. These known and putative autoantigens are significantly associated with viral replication and trafficking processes, including gene expression, ribonucleoprotein biogenesis, mRNA metabolism, translation, vesicle and vesicle-mediated transport, and apoptosis. They are also associated with cytoskeleton, platelet degranulation, IL-12 signaling, and smooth muscle contraction. Host proteins that interact with and that are perturbed by viral proteins are a major source of autoantigens. Orf3 induces the largest number of protein alterations, Orf9 affects the mitochondrial ribosome, and they and E, M, N, and Nsp proteins affect protein localization to membrane, immune responses, and apoptosis. Phosphorylation and ubiquitination alterations by viral infection define major molecular changes in autoantigen origination. This study provides a large list of autoantigens as well as new targets for future investigation, e.g., UBA1, UCHL1, USP7, CDK11A, PRKDC, PLD3, PSAT1, RAB1A, SLC2A1, platelet activating factor acetylhydrolase, and mitochondrial ribosomal proteins. This study illustrates how viral infection can modify host cellular proteins extensively, yield diverse autoantigens, and trigger a myriad of autoimmune sequelae.

RESULTS: Interviews with 16 participants (eight patients and eight caregivers) revealed four main themes. First, participants valued visiting their primary care provider after discharge to build upon their longitudinal relationship. Second, primary care providers played a key role in coordinating care. Third, there were mixed views on the ideal time for follow-up, with many participants expressing a desire to delay follow-up to stabilize following their acute hospitalization. Fourth, the link between the post-discharge visit and preventing hospital readmissions was unclear to participants, who often self-triaged based on their symptoms when deciding on the need for emergency care. CONCLUSIONS: Patients and caregivers valued in-person follow-up with their primary care provider following discharge from hospital because of the trust established through pre-existing longitudinal relationships. Our results suggest policy makers should focus on improving rates of primary care provider attachment and systems supporting informational continuity.

We aimed to determine the proportion of syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) among patients with CAP and HN. Moreover, we wished to investigate the relationship between HN and inflammatory markers, bacterial etiology and prognosis in hospitalized children with CAP. METHODS: We carried out a prospective, observational, multicentre, prospective cohort study. Eligible participants were children from 1 month to 17 years old hospitalized due to CAP from 2012 to 2015. RESULTS: A total of 150 children were analyzed. Forty-five (30%) patients had serum sodium levels of less than 135 mmol/L. Patients with HN had significantly higher concentrations of inflammatory biomarkers. They also had significantly lower osmolality and urine sodium. They also had longer hospitalizations and more days of fever. Only 16 out of the 45 (35%) patients with HN had confirmed calculated plasma osmolality (<275 mOsm/kg). Only 5 out of 37 (13%) patients with available measurements of plasma osmolality and urine sodium fulfilled the criteria for SIADH. Among the 16 patients with HN and hypo-osmolality, 15 had a fractional sodium excretion (EFNa) levels of less than 1%. We found a significant inverse linear correlation between serum sodium and C-reactive protein, as well as serum sodium and procalcitonin. We found a significant direct correlation between serum sodium and urine sodium. CONCLUSION: HN is a common finding in hospitalized children with CAP. True SIADH is a rare event. HN has a good correlation with inflammatory biomarkers.","Tagarro, Alfredo; Martín, María-Dolores; Del-Amo, Nazaret; Sanz-Rosa, David; Rodríguez MD PhD, Mario; Galán MD PhD, Juan-Carlos; Otheo, Enrique",Paediatrics & Child Health,551,20

Recent advances in digital adherence technologies (DATs) have renewed discussion on how to best address nonadherence, as well as offering important information on dose-by-dose adherence patterns and their variability between countries and settings. Previous studies have largely focussed on percentage thresholds to delineate sufficient adherence, but this is misleading and limited, given the complex and dynamic nature of adherence over the treatment course. Instead, we apply a standardised taxonomy – as adopted by the international adherence community – to dose-by-dose medication-taking data, which divides missed doses into 1) late/noninitiation (starting treatment later than expected/not starting), 2) discontinuation (ending treatment early), and 3) suboptimal implementation (intermittent missed doses). Using this taxonomy, we can consider the implications of different forms of nonadherence for intervention and regimen design. For example, can treatment regimens be adapted to increase the “forgiveness” of common patterns of suboptimal implementation to protect against treatment failure and the development of drug resistance? Is it reasonable to treat all missed doses of treatment as equally problematic and equally common when deploying DATs? Can DAT data be used to indicate the patients that need enhanced levels of support during their treatment course? Critically, we pinpoint key areas where knowledge regarding treatment adherence is sparse and impeding scientific progress.","Stagg, Helen R.; Flook, Mary; Martinecz, Antal; Kielmann, Karina; Abel Zur Wiesch, Pia; Karat, Aaron S.; Lipman, Marc C.I.; Sloan, Derek J.; Walker, Elizabeth F.; Fielding, Katherine L.",ERJ Open Res,551,4

Design Multicenter prospective cohort study Setting Ten institutions in the United States Patients Patients over the age of 18 years who underwent benign gynecologic surgery from July 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020 were included. All patients were followed from the time of surgery until 10 weeks post-operatively. Those with intra-uterine pregnancy or known gynecologic malignancy were excluded. Interventions Benign gynecologic surgery Measurements The primary outcome was the incidence of perioperative COVID-19 infections which was stratified as 1) prior COVID-19 infection, 2) pre-operative COVID-19 infection and 3) post-operative COVID-19 infection. Secondary outcomes included adverse events and mortality following surgery, as well as predictors for post-operative COVID-19 infection. If surgery was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the reason for postponement and any subsequent adverse event was recorded. Main Results Of 3423 patients included for final analysis, 189 (5.5%) postponed their gynecologic surgery during the pandemic. Forty-three patients (1.3% of total cases) were due to a history of COVID-19. The majority (182 [96.3%]) had no sequelae attributed to surgical postponement. Following hospital discharge to 10 weeks post-operatively, 39 (1.1%) patients became infected with SARS-CoV-2. The mean duration of time between hospital discharge and the follow-up positive COVID-19 test was 22.1 ± 12.3 days (range 4-50 days). Eleven (31.4% of post-operative COVID-19 infections, 0.3% of total cases) of the newly diagnosed COVID-19 infections occurred within 14 days of hospital discharge. On multivariable logistic regression, living in the Southwest (adjOR 6.8) and single-unit increase in age-adjusted Charlson co-morbidity index (adjOR 1.2) increased the odds of post-operative COVID-19 infection. Peri-operative complications were not significantly higher in patients with a history of prior positive COVID-19 compared to those without a history of COVID-19, though the mean duration of time between prior COVID-19 diagnosis and surgery was 97 days (14 weeks). Conclusion In this large multi-center prospective cohort study of benign gynecologic surgeries, only 1.1% of patients developed a post-operative COVID-19 infection, with 0.3% of infection in the immediate 14-days after surgery. The incidence of post-operative complications was not different in those with and without prior COVID-19 infections.","Kho, Rosanne M; Chang, Olivia H; Hare, Adam; Schaffer, Joseph; Hamner, Jen; Northington, Gina M; Metcalfe, Nina Durchfort; Iglesia, Cheryl B; Zelivianskaia, Anna S; Hur, Hye-Chun; Seaman, Sierra; Mueller, Margaret G; Milad, Magdy; Ascher-Walsh, Charles; Kossl, Kelsey; Rardin, Charles; Siddique, Moiuri; Murphy, Miles; Heit, Michael",J Minim Invasive Gynecol,551,26

Nevertheless, approximately 20-30% of cases progress to tumors or erythroderma, resulting in poor outcome. At present, factors contributing to this switch from indolent to aggressive disease are only insufficiently understood. METHODS In patients with advanced-stage MF, we compared patches with longstanding history to newly developed plaques and tumors by using single-cell RNA sequencing, and compared results with early-stage MF as well as nonlesional MF and healthy control skin. RESULTS Despite considerable inter-individual variability, lesion progression was uniformly associated with downregulation of the tissue residency markers CXCR4 and CD69, the heat shock protein HSPA1A, the tumor suppressors and immunoregulatory mediators ZFP36 and TXNIP, and the interleukin 7 receptor (IL7R) within the malignant clone, but not in benign T cells. This phenomenon was not only found in conventional TCR-αβ MF, but also in a case of TCR-γδ MF, suggesting a common mechanism across MF subtypes. Conversely, malignant cells in clinically unaffected skin from MF patients showed upregulation of these markers. CONCLUSIONS Our data reveal a specific panel of biomarkers that might be used for monitoring MF disease progression. Altered expression of these genes may underlie the switch in clinical phenotype observed in advanced-stage MF.","Rindler, Katharina; Jonak, Constanze; Alkon, Natalia; Thaler, Felix M; Kurz, Harald; Shaw, Lisa E; Stingl, Georg; Weninger, Wolfgang; Halbritter, Florian; Bauer, Wolfgang M; Farlik, Matthias; Brunner, Patrick M",Molecular cancer,551,26

We estimated IgG prevalence and used logistic regression to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for variables associated with IgG test status. RESULTS: Of the 13,343 participants with IgG test results, 78.6% were women, 70.6% were non-Hispanic White, 21.1% non-Hispanic Black, 2.9% Hispanic Americans and 5.4% belonged to other races. Overall, 7.99% (95% CI: 7.53-8.45%) of the participants tested IgG positive. In age-, sex- and body mass index (BMI)-adjusted analyses, non-Hispanic Blacks were 2.7-times more likely to test positive than non-Hispanic Whites (OR=2.72; 95% CI: 2.33-3.19).

Likewise, the effects of patients’ conditions such as age, gender, and comorbidity on prognosis will be analyzed. METHODS: The files were retrospectively scanned for all COVID-19 patients over the age of 18 years who were admitted to the ED and hospitalized between January 1, 2021, and March 15, 2021. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and the area under the curve (AUC) were used to assess each scoring system discriminatory for predicting in-hospital mortality and ICU admission. RESULTS: There were 464 patients included in this study. The mean age of the patients was 62.4 ± 16.7, of which 245 were men and 219 were women. The most common comorbidity in patients was hypertension (200; 43.1%), followed by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (174; 37.5%), and coronary artery disease (154; 33.2%). In terms of in-hospital mortality, the AUC of SI, and mSI were 0.719 and 0.739, respectively. In terms of an ICU requirement, the AUC of SI, and mSI were 0.704 and 0.729, respectively. CONCLUSION: In this study, it was concluded that SI and mSI are useful in predicting in-hospital mortality and ICU requirement in COVID-19 patients. In addition, another important result of the study is that advanced age, male gender, and hypertension may be associated with a poor prognosis.","Kurt, Erdem; Bahadirli, Suphi",Disaster medicine and public health preparedness,551,20

This study (1) examines factors that influence when individuals transition from a negative to positive test (acquisition) or a positive to negative test (loss) of rhinovirus (HRV) and other respiratory tract viruses in 26 households followed weekly for one year, (2) investigates evidence for intrahousehold and interhousehold transmission and the characteristics of individuals implicated in transmission, and (3) builds data-based simulation models to identify factors that most strongly affect patterns of prevalence. METHODS: We detected HRV, coronavirus, paramyxovirus, influenza and bocavirus with the FilmArray polymerase chain reaction (PCR) platform (BioFire Diagnostics, LLC). We used logistic regression to find covariates affecting acquisition or loss of HRV including demographic characteristics of individuals, their household, their current infection status, and prevalence within their household and across the population. We apply generalized linear mixed models to test robustness of results. RESULTS: Acquisition of HRV was less probable in older individuals and those infected with a coronavirus, and higher with a higher proportion of other household members infected. Loss of HRV is reduced with a higher proportion of other household members infected. Within households, only children and symptomatic individuals show evidence for transmission, while between households only a higher number of infected older children (ages 5-19) increases the probability of acquisition. Coronaviruses, paramyxoviruses and bocavirus also show evidence of intrahousehold transmission. Simulations show that age-dependent susceptibility and transmission have the largest effects on mean HRV prevalence. CONCLUSIONS: Children are most likely to acquire and most likely to transmit HRV both within and between households, with infectiousness concentrated in symptomatic children. Simulations predict that the spread of HRV and other respiratory tract viruses can be reduced but not eliminated by practices within the home.","Adler, Frederick R.; Stockmann, Chris; Ampofo, Krow; Pavia, Andrew T.; Byington, Carrie L.",PLoS One,551,20

Translation of these data into clinical interventions against COVID-19 remains to be accomplished. Exploring host response to COVID-19 in the upper respiratory tract can unveil prognostic markers and therapeutic targets. METHODS: We conducted a meta-analysis of published transcriptome and proteome profiles of respiratory samples of COVID-19 patients to shortlist high confidence upregulated host factors. Subsequently, mRNA overexpression of selected genes was validated in nasal swabs from a cohort of COVID-19 positive/negative, symptomatic/asymptomatic individuals. Guided by this analysis, we sought to check for potential drug targets. An FDA-approved drug, Auranofin, was tested against SARS-CoV-2 replication in cell culture and Syrian hamster challenge model. FINDINGS: The meta-analysis and validation in the COVID-19 cohort revealed S100 family genes (S100A6, S100A8, S100A9, and S100P) as prognostic markers of severe COVID-19. Furthermore, Thioredoxin (TXN) was found to be consistently upregulated. Auranofin, which targets Thioredoxin reductase, was found to mitigate SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro. Furthermore, oral administration of Auranofin in Syrian hamsters in therapeutic as well as prophylactic regimen reduced viral replication, IL-6 production, and inflammation in the lungs. INTERPRETATION: Elevated mRNA level of S100s in the nasal swabs indicate severe COVID-19 disease, and FDA-approved drug Auranofin mitigated SARS-CoV-2 replication in preclinical hamster model.

The SFTSV glycoproteins, Gn and Gc, facilitate viral entry into host cells. Gn and Gc are generated from a precursor protein, Gn/Gc, but it is currently unknown how the precursor is converted into the single proteins and whether this process is required for viral infectivity. Employing a rhabdoviral pseudotyping system, we demonstrate that a predicted signal sequence at the N-terminus of Gc is required for Gn/Gc processing and viral infectivity while potential proprotein convertase cleavage sites in Gc are dispensable. Moreover, we show that expression of Gn or Gc alone is not sufficient for host cell entry while particles bearing both proteins are infectious, and we provide evidence that Gn facilitates Golgi transport and virion incorporation of Gc. Collectively, these results suggest that signal peptidase liberates mature Gc from the Gn/Gc precursor and that this process is essential for viral infectivity and thus constitutes a potential target for antiviral intervention.","Plegge, Teresa; Hofmann-Winkler, Heike; Spiegel, Martin; Pöhlmann, Stefan",PLoS One,551,16

It is necessary to increase public knowledge on and influence attitudes towards periodontal diseases in order to prevent them. However, the effect of oral health education (OHE) as a primary preventive method in China is unsatisfactory. The aim of this study is to investigate the feasibility of extending an e-learning course regarding periodontal health by comparing the effects of oral health education regarding periodontal health (OHE-PH) on dental and non-dental students and the effects between a traditional course and an e-learning course among non-dental students at Sichuan University. METHODS: A quasi-experimental study with a pre-test and a post-test was performed. A total of 217 dental students and 134 non-dental students attended a traditional course; 69 non-dental students attended an e-learning course. Before- and after-course questionnaires about periodontal health knowledge, attitudes and behaviours were administered. RESULTS: After the traditional/e-learning course, the knowledge of both dental and non-dental students about periodontal diseases and self-reported behaviours for gingival bleeding and oral care improved. The non-dental students reached or surpassed the level of dental students before the course. The non-dental students taking the e-learning course performed better in some areas than those taking the traditional course. CONCLUSIONS: OHE-PH was effective for dental and non-dental students. The e-learning course on OHE-PH was sufficient for improving knowledge and self-reported behaviours among non-dental undergraduates and was even better than the traditional course in some areas. The e-learning course may be an effective method for periodontal health education and oral health promotion among undergraduates.","Wu, Zhiwu; Li, Mingming; Zhu, Fangzhi; Lei, Lei; Cheng, Ran; Hu, Tao",BMC Oral Health,551,1

The Ilizarov technique is popular, but is associated with long external fixator time and many complications. This retrospective study assessed outcomes of post-traumatic femoral defects managed by monorail external fixation over an intramedullary nail. METHODS: Eight patients were included from October 2015 to May 2019 with post-traumatic femoral defects that underwent treatment with monorail fixator-assisted intramedullary nailing. Primary outcome was time to bone union and bone results according to ASAMI classification. Secondary outcomes were lengthening index, consolidation time and index, external fixator index (EFI), time to partial weight bearing(PWB) and full weight bearing (FWB), and complications. Patient reported outcome measures including EQ-5D-5L, SF-36, Oxford knee scores (OKS), and Oxford hip scores (OHS) were recorded after recovery. RESULTS: Mean follow-up time was 227 weeks. Average bone defect size was 9.69 cm. Average consolidation time and index were 11.35 months and 1.24 months/cm, respectively. Mean lengthening and external fixator index were 20.2 days/cm and 23.88 days/cm, respectively. On average, patients achieved FWB and bone union 56.25 weeks and 68.83 weeks after bone transport initiation, respectively. Two patients had docking site non-union, five patients had pin site infections, and two patients had osteomyelitis. EQ-5D-5L and EQ-VAS scores were compared to UK population norms (p = 0.104, p = 0.238, respectively). Average OKS was 32.17 and OHS was 34.00. CONCLUSION: Monorail external fixation over an intramedullary nail is an effective option for post-traumatic femoral defects, reducing external fixator time and returning patients’ quality of life to a level comparable with the normal population.","Lu, Victor; Zhang, James; Zhou, Andrew; Krkovic, Matija",Eur J Orthop Surg Traumatol,551,29

OBJECTIVES: The study aimed to determine the mental health status and its associated factors among college students in China. METHODS: An online survey was conducted on 300 students selected through a cluster sampling strategy in a university in Hubei, China, tapping into sociodemographic characteristics of the participants, their mental health status measured by the modified Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90), and social support measured by the Social Support Rating Scale. Multivariate linear regression models were established to identify predictors of the SCL-90 scores. RESULTS: Mental health disorders were found in 8% of the respondents, with obsessive compulsive, interpersonal sensitivity and depression as the top three reported problems. Compared with the national population norms of university students in 2014, our study participants had higher scores in SCL-90. There were statistically significant difference in the Global Severity index (GSI) and all nine subscales scores (p<0.05). Poorer self-rated health, higher study pressure, and lower social support were significant predictors of higher SCL-90 scores (p<0.05) after adjustment for variations in other variables.

The routine detection and diagnosis of BCoV have been mainly dependent on assays with low sensitivity. The aim of the present study was to develop and evaluate a semi-nested PCR (SN-PCR) to amplify a 251 bp fragment of BCoV N gene from fresh (n = 25) and frozen (n = 25) diarrhoeic faecal samples of naturally infected calves. To improve detection of BCoV in faecal samples by the SN-PCR an internal control was developed, and the results were compared with a conventional RT-PCR assay. The rates of positive samples by SN-PCR and RT-PCR were 24% (12/50) and 8% (4/50), respectively (K = 0.43). Only fresh samples were positive in RT-PCR while the SN-PCR detected BCoV in both fresh and frozen faecal samples. The sensitivity of SN-PCR was determined by 10-fold serial dilutions of the BCoV Kakegawa strain (HA titre: 256) that was detected until 10(−7) dilution. The specificity of the amplicons was assessed by restriction fragment length polymorphism and sequence analysis. The inclusion of an internal control provides a way to detect assay inhibition in faecal samples and failure of nucleic acid extraction that allow reduction of the number of false-negative results.","Takiuchi, Elisabete; Stipp, Danilo T.; Alfieri, Alice F.; Alfieri, Amauri A.",J Virol Methods,551,26

This retrospective observational study assessed the volume of stroke cases managed in the Emergency Department (ED) and reperfusion therapies in an Italian stroke network with a high incidence of COVID-19, particularly to evaluate if the in-hospital rerouting and the switch from a drip-and-ship to a mothership model could assure an adequate volume of acute treatments. METHODS: We compared data from March 2020 with those from previous years and formulated five PICO questions regarding (1) incidence of stroke cases in the ED; (2) relation between stroke cases and COVID-19; (3) differences in the number of reperfusion therapies, (4) in the call-to-needle and door-to-needle times for intravenous thrombolysis, and (5) in the call-to-groin and door-to-groin times for thrombectomy. RESULTS: We found (1) a 28% decreased of confirmed stroke cases managed in the ED, (2) a negative correlation between stroke cases in ED and COVID-19 progression (r(s) = − .390, p = .030), and (3) a similar number of treatments in March 2020 and March 2019. The adoption of the mothership model (4) did not delay alteplase infusion (median call-to-needle p = .126, median door-to-needle p = .142) but led to (5) a significant reduction in median call-to-groin (p = .018) and door-to-groin times (p = .010). CONCLUSION: The “hospital avoidance” of stroke patients during the “stay-at-home” appeals needs to be considered for future public health campaigns.

Overseas-qualified dentists need to either pass a registration exam to be able to practise dentistry in the UK or, under certain circumstances, they can register through assessment. Additionally, temporary registration gives overseas-qualified dentists the opportunity to practise dentistry under supervision for up to five years. However, these routes are difficult and it could take a few years before a dentist is registered. These dentists have the academic route as well, but similar to the registration route, it is not easy and very competitive and expensive. Brexit and COVID-19 had their impact on the journey of these dentists and altered their plans to pursue their career in the UK. To sum up, the current system could probably be modified to be more in line with that of neighbouring countries.

We analysed the impact of filtering facepiece class 2 (FFP2) vs. surgical masks on the risk of SARS-CoV-2 acquisition among Swiss healthcare workers (HCW). Methods Our prospective multicentre cohort enrolled patient-facing HCWs from June to August 2020. Participants were asked about COVID-19 risk exposures/behaviours, including preferred mask type when caring for COVID-19 patients outside of aerosol-generating procedures (AGP). For those performing AGPs, we asked whether they used FFP2 irrespective of the patients COVID-19 status (i.e. universal use). The impact of FFP2 on i) self-reported SARS-CoV-2-positive nasopharyngeal PCR/rapid antigen tests captured during weekly surveys, and ii) SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion between baseline and January/February 2021 was assessed. Results We enrolled 3259 participants from nine healthcare institutions, whereof 716 (22%) preferentially used FFP2 respirators. Among these, 81/716 (11%) reported a SARS-CoV-2-positive swab, compared to 352/2543 (14%) surgical mask users (median follow-up 242 days); seroconversion was documented in 85/656 (13%) FFP2 and 426/2255 (19%) surgical mask users. Adjusted for baseline characteristics, COVID-19 exposure, and risk behaviour, FFP2 use was non-significantly associated with a decreased risk for SARS-CoV-2-positive swab (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 0.8, 95% CI 0.6-1.0, p=0.052) and seroconversion (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.7, 95% CI 0.5-1.0, p=0.053); household exposure was the strongest risk factor (aHR for positive swab 10.1, p<0.001; aOR for seroconversion 5.0, p<0.001). In subgroup analysis, FFP2 use was clearly protective among those with frequent (>20 patients) COVID-19 exposure (aHR 0.7, p<0.001; aOR 0.6, p=0.035). Universal FFP2 use during AGPs showed no protective effect (aHR 1.1, p=0.7; aOR 0.9, p=0.53).

Efficacy is observed against the six viral families causing most human respiratory viral disease, irrespective of strain, including both influenza (FLUV) and SARS-CoV-2, with cell culture EC50 at or below 100 nM. Survival benefit is demonstrated in pigs against another member of family Coronaviridae, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), and shown equally effective in mild and severe disease. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) titer is reduced by drug treatment in cotton rats. A substantial barrier to viral resistance is demonstrated for FLUV. Drug resin affinity chromatography (DRAC) reveals a novel drug target: a multi-protein complex (MPC) formed transiently, in an energy-dependent fashion, and composed of host proteins implicated in both viral lifecycles and manipulation of innate immunity. The protein composition of this host MPC is modified upon viral infection, with increase or decrease of some proteins and appearance or complete loss of others. Valosin-containing protein, also known as Transitional endoplasmatic reticulum ATPase (VCP/p97), is present in the target MPC of uninfected cells and significantly increased in both FLUV and CoV infection. SQSTM1/p62, a key regulator of the autophagy pathway of innate immunity whose dysfunction is implicated in cytokine storm, is i) found in the target MPC from uninfected cells, ii) diminished in DRAC eluates by infection, and iii) restored by drug treatment of infected cells. 14-3-3 is one of likely several proteins that comprise the drug-binding site. Advanced compounds with improved pharmacokinetic (PK) properties and lung exposure are approaching criteria for a Target Product Profile. We propose these novel drug targets to comprise a previously unappreciated molecular basis for homeostasis that is modified by viruses to allow exploitation for viral propagation and is restored by treatment with the therapeutic compounds presented. This discovery has transformative implications for treatment of respiratory viral-related disease, applicable to everything from seasonal FLUV to COVID-19 and future novel respiratory viruses, due to the pan-family nature of drug activity and barrier to resistance development.","Selvarajah, Suganya; Lingappa, Anuradha F.; Michon, Maya; Yu, Shao Feng; Macieik, Amanda; Mallesh, Suguna; Appaiah, Umesh; Crabtree, Jackelyn; Copeland, Kiel; Lin, Jim; Akintunde, Olayemi; Nichols, Christine; Petrouski, Emma; Moreira, A.

Materials and methods Interned-based survey of pediatrician practice owners as well as paper-based survey of non-physician healthcare professionals (assistant personnel) of practices in Saarland. Results In this survey, the percentage of participation was 85% of owners of the 53 practices as well as 81% of the assistant personnel. An increased risk of being absent from work existed for 71% of practice owners and 48% of assistant personnel, either because they belonged to a group at high risk of being infected or due to other care obligations. However, there were very few cases of care givers being actually absent. Although at the beginning of the pandemic, necessary safety equipment was available only for 32%, 85% considered the hygienic and occupational health and safety measure reasonable. During the pandemic, 89% of practices changed their practice and patient management.

To understand the immunological signature of SARS-CoV-2 infections and aid the search for treatments and vaccines, comprehensive characterization of adaptive immune responses towards SARS-CoV-2 is needed. We investigated the breadth and potency of antibody-, and T-cell immune responses, in 203 recovered SARS-CoV-2 infected patients who presented with asymptomatic to severe infections. We report very broad serological profiles with cross-reactivity to other human coronaviruses. Further, >99% had SARS-CoV-2 epitope specific antibodies, with SARS-CoV-2 neutralization and spike-ACE2 receptor interaction blocking observed in 95% of individuals. A significant positive correlation between spike-ACE2 blocking antibody titers and neutralization potency was observed. SARS-CoV-2 specific CD8+ T-cell responses were clear and quantifiable in 90% of HLA-A2+ individuals. The viral surface spike protein was identified as the dominant target for both neutralizing antibodies and CD8+ T cell responses. Overall, the majority of patients had robust adaptive immune responses, regardless of disease severity. Author summary SARS-CoV-2 can cause severe and deadly infections. However, the immunological understanding of this viral infection is limited. Currently, several vaccines are being developed to help limit transmission and prevent the current pandemic. However, basic understanding of the adaptive immune response developed during SARS-CoV-2 infections is needed to inform further vaccine development and to understand the protective properties of the developed immune response. We investigated, the adaptive immune response developed during SARS-CoV-2 infections in recovered patients experiencing a full spectrum of disease severity, from asymptomatic infections to severe cases requiring hospitalization. We used a novel multiplex serological platform, cell-based neutralization assays and dextramer flow cytometry assays to characterize a broad and robust humoral and cellular immune response towards SARS-CoV-2. We found that the vast majority of recovered individuals have clear detectable and functional SARS-CoV-2 spike specific adaptive immune responses, despite diverse disease severities. The detection of both a humoral and cellular functional spike specific immune response in the vast majority of the individuals, irrespective of asymptomatic manifestations, supports vaccine designs currently underway, and encourages further exploration of whether primary infections provide protection to reinfection.","Nielsen, Stine SF; Vibholm, Line K; Monrad, Ida; Olesen, Rikke; Frattari, Giacomo S; Pahus, Marie H; Højen, Jesper F; Gunst, Jesper D; Erikstrup, Christian; Holleufer, Andreas; Hartmann, Rune; Østergaard, Lars; Søgaard, Ole S; Schleimann, Mariane H; Tolstrup, Martin",bioRxiv,551,29

METHODS This was a two-group comparative longitudinal observational study of infants born to mothers with COVID-19 at the time of birth, between March 13-May 31, 2020 (the first wave of the pandemic) in Spain. Fourteen Spanish hospitals participated, five (35.7%) were Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative accredited. Type of feeding was assessed prospectively at discharge, 1, 3, and 6 months of age. A total of 248 newborns were included in the study. RESULTS A total of 117 (47.3%) newborns were born in Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI) accredited centers. These centers applied skin-to-skin contact with greater probability (OR = 1.9; 95% CI [1.18, 3.29]) and separated the newborns from their mothers less frequently (OR = 0.46; 95% CI [0.26, 0.81]) than non-accredited centers.

Chi-square test-for-trend was used to examine prevalence by month of enrollment. RESULTS: Most of 642 pHCWs enrolled were 31-40years, female and had no comorbidities. Half had children in their home, 49% had traveled, 42% reported an illness since January, 31% had a known COVID-19 exposure, and 8% had SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing. High COVID-19 pandemic anxiety was reported by 71%. Anti-SARS-CoV-2-IgG prevalence was 4.1%; 8.4% among ED versus 2.0% among non-ED pHCWs (p < 0.001). ED-work location and known COVID-19 exposure were independent risk factors. 31% of antibody-positive pHCWs reported no symptoms. Prevalence significantly (p < 0.001) increased from 3.0% in April-June to 12.7% in July-August. CONCLUSIONS: Anti-SARS-CoV-2-IgG prevalence was low in pHCWs but increased rapidly over time. Both working in the ED and exposure to a COVID-19-positive contact were associated with antibody-seropositivity. Ongoing universal PPE utilization is essential. These data may guide vaccination policies to protect front-line workers.","Morris, Claudia R.; Sullivan, Patrick; Mantus, Grace; Sanchez, Travis; Zlotorzynska, Maria; Hanberry, Bradley; Iyer, Srikant; Heilman, Stacy; Camacho-Gonzalez, Andres; Figueroa, Janet; Manoranjithan, Shaminy; Leake, Debra; Mendis, Reshika; Cleeton, Rebecca; Chen, Christie; Krieger, Rachel; Bush, Patricia; Hughes, Tiffany; Little, Wendalyn K.; Suthar, Mehul; Wrammert, Jens; Vos, Miriam B.",Int J Infect Dis,551,20

The healthcare personnel were no exception, their responsibilities as well as their risks being immense. Methods 4927 healthcare personnel all working in pediatric units at 32 hospitals from seven different regions of Turkey enrolled to the study to determine the seroprevalence of SARS Co-V-2 after the first peak wave. Point of care serologic lateral flow rapid test kit for IgM/IgG was used (Ecotest CE Assure Tech. Co. Ltd.). Seroprevalence and its association with demographic characteristics and possible risk factors were analyzed. Results Nearly 6.1% of healthcare personnel were found to be seropositive for SARS Co-V- 2. Seropositivity was more common among those who did not universally wear protective masks (10.6% vs 6.1%). Having a COVID-19 co-worker increased the likelihood of infection. The least and the most experienced personnel affected more. Most of the seropositive healthcare personnel (68%) did not have any suspicion that they had COVID-19 previously. Conclusions Health surveillance for healthcare personnel involving routine point-of-care nucleic acid testing as well as monitoring PPE adherence would be important strategies to protect healthcare personnel from COVID-19 and to reduce nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 transmission.","Oygar, Pembe Derin; Büyükçam, Ayşe; Bal, Zümrüt Şahbudak; Dalgıç, Nazan; Bozdemir, Şefika Elmas; Karbuz, Adem; Çetin, Benhur Şirvan; Kara, Yalçın; Çetin, Ceren; Hatipoğlu, Nevin; Uygun, Hatice; Aygün, Fatma Deniz; Törün, Selda Hançerli; Okur, Dicle Şener; Çiftdoğan, Dilek Yılmaz; Kara, Tuğçe Tural; Yahşi, Aysun; Özer, Arife; Demir, Sevliya Öcal; Akkoç, Gülşen; Turan, Cansu; Salı, Enes; Şen, Semra; Erdeniz, Emine Hafize; Kara, Soner Sertan; Emiroğlu, Melike; Erat, Tuğba; Aktürk, Hacer; Gürlevik, Sibel Laçinel; Sütçü, Murat; Aydın, Zeynep Gökçe Gayretli; Atikan, Başak Yıldız; Yeşil, Edanur; Güner, Gizem; Çelebi, Emel; Efe, Kadir; İşançlı, Didem Kızmaz; Durmuş, Habibe Selver; Tekeli, Seher; Karaaslan, Ayşe; Bülbül, Lida; Almış, Habip; Kaba, Özge; Keleş, Yıldız Ekemen; Yazıcıoğlu, Bahadır; Oğuz, Şerife Bahtiyar; Ovalı, Hüsnü Fahri; Doğan, Hazal Helin; Çelebi, Solmaz; Çakır, Deniz; Karasulu, Burcugül; Alkan, Gülsüm; Yenidoğan, İrem; Gül, Doruk; Küçükalioğlu, Burcu Parıltan; Avcu, Gülhadiye; Kukul, Musa Gürel; Bilen, Melis; Yaşar, Belma; Üstün, Tuğba; Kılıç, Ömer; Akın, Yasemin; Cebeci, Sinem Oral; Bucak, Ibrahim Hakan; Yanartaş, Mehpare Sarı; Şahin, Aslıhan; Arslanoğlu, Sertaç; Elevli, Murat; Çoban, Rabia; Öz, Şadiye Kübra Tüter; Hatipoğlu, Halil; Erkum, İlyas Tolga; Turgut, Mehmet; Demirbuğa, Asuman; Özçelik, Taha; Çiftçi, Diclehan; Sarı, Emine Ergül; Akkuş, Gökhan; Hatipoğlu, Sadık Sami; Dinleyici, Ener Çağrı; Hacımustafaoğlu, Mustafa; Özkınay, Ferda; Kurugöl, Zafer; Cengiz, Ali Bülent; Somer, Ayper; Tezer, Hasan; Kara, Ateş",Int J Infect Dis,551,5

METHODS: We compared a single dose of 100 mg/kg of IV magnesium sulfate vs placebo for acute bronchiolitis. Patients received bronchodilator therapy, nebulized hypertonic saline, and 5 days of dexamethasone if there was eczema and/or a family history of asthma. Time to medical readiness for discharge was the primary efficacy outcome. Bronchiolitis severity scores and need for infirmary or hospital admission and for clinic revisits within 2 weeks were secondary outcomes. Cardiorespiratory instability onset was the safety outcome. RESULTS: A total of 162 previously healthy infants diagnosed with bronchiolitis aged 22 days to 17.6 months (median, 3.7 months) were enrolled. Approximately one-half of patients had eczema and/or a family history of asthma; 86.4% had positive findings on nasopharyngeal virus swabs. Geometric mean time until medical readiness for discharge was 24.1 h (95% CI, 20.0-29.1) for the 78 magnesium-treated patients and 25.3 h (95% CI, 20.3-31.5) for the 82 patients receiving placebo (ratio, 0.95 [95% CI, 0.52-1.80]; P = .91). Mean bronchiolitis severity scores over time were similar for the two groups. The frequency of clinic visits in the subsequent 2 weeks (33.8% and 27.2%, respectively) was also similar. Fifteen magnesium recipients (19.5%) vs five placebo recipients (6.2%) were readmitted to the infirmary or hospital within 2 weeks (P = .016). No acute cardiorespiratory side effects were reported.

METHODS: The study included 142 COVID‐19 patients hospitalized in Huoshenshan Hospital from February to March 2020. Nursing measures in the treatment (n = 111) and control (n = 31) groups included integrated management care and usual care. The integrated management model had eight components: WeChat group management, early Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) treatment, emotional nursing, music therapy, observation of tongue coating and pulse, vital Qi strengthening, preventing recurrence after recovery, and an individualized follow‐up scheme. The endpoints included clinical outcome, recovery time of clinical symptoms and signs, days of hospital stay, and survival without intensive care unit (ICU) admission. RESULTS: Recovery time from clinical symptoms such as fever, cough, shortness of breath, muscle aches, and fatigue in the treatment group was shorter than that in the control group. Less time was required to show negative chest computed tomography findings in the treatment group than in the control group (13.0 ± 2.8 vs. 16.7 ± 3.9, p < .025). The lengths of hospital stay in the two groups were 16.4 ± 7.3 days (treatment group) and 24.4 ± 4.8 days (control group) (p < .001). Kaplan–Meier curves for survival without ICU transfer showed statistical difference between the two groups (χ(2) = 5.427, p = .020). CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that the integrated management mode can relieve the symptoms of patients faster, shorten hospital stay and disease course, and reduce the rate of ICU transfers.","Chu, Lanfang; Zhang, Yongwen",Jpn J Nurs Sci,551,8

Computational analyses were used to identify features common to class I viral fusion proteins (VFPs) in antennavirus glycoproteins, including an N-terminal fusion peptide, two extended alpha-helices, an intrahelical loop, and a carboxyl terminal transmembrane domain. Like mammarenavirus and hartmanivirus glycoproteins, the antennavirus glycoproteins have an intracellular zinc-binding domain and a long virion-associated stable signal peptide (SSP). The glycoproteins of reptarenaviruses are also class I VFPs, but do not contain zinc-binding domains nor do they encode SSPs.

Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) use has declined. We estimated the potential impact of COVID-19 on HIV incidence and mortality among US MSM. METHODS: We used a calibrated HIV transmission model for MSM in Baltimore, Maryland, and available data on COVID-19-related disruptions to predict impacts of data-driven reductions in sexual partners(0%,25%,50%), condom use(5%), HIV testing(20%), viral suppression(10%), PrEP initiations(72%), PrEP use(9%) and ART initiations(50%), exploring different disruption durations and magnitudes. We estimated the median (95% credible interval) change in cumulative new HIV infections and deaths among MSM over one and five years, compared with a scenario without COVID-19-related disruptions. FINDINGS: A six-month 25% reduction in sexual partners among Baltimore MSM, without HIV service changes, could reduce new HIV infections by 12·2%(11·7,12·8%) and 3·0%(2·6,3·4%) over one and five years, respectively. In the absence of changes in sexual behaviour, the six-month data-driven disruptions to condom use, testing, viral suppression, PrEP initiations, PrEP use and ART initiations combined were predicted to increase new HIV infections by 10·5%(5·8,16·5%) over one year, and by 3·5%(2·1,5·4%) over five years. A 25% reduction in partnerships offsets the negative impact of these combined service disruptions on new HIV infections (overall reduction 3·9%(−1·0,7·4%), 0·0%(−1·4,0·9%) over one, five years, respectively), but not on HIV deaths (corresponding increases 11·0%(6·2,17·7%), 2·6%(1·5,4·3%)). The predicted impacts of reductions in partnerships or viral suppression doubled if they lasted 12 months or if disruptions were twice as large. INTERPRETATION: Maintaining access to ART and adherence support is of the utmost importance to minimise excess HIV-related mortality due to COVID-19 restrictions in the US, even if accompanied by reductions in sexual partnerships.

A clinical service, COVID Oximetry @home (CO@h) was launched in November 2020 to support remote monitoring of COVID-19 patients in the community. Remote monitoring through CO@h aims to identify early patient deterioration and provide timely escalation for cases of silent hypoxia, while reducing the burden on secondary care. Methods: We conducted a retrospective service evaluation of COVID-19 patients onboarded to CO@h from November 2020 to March 2021 in the North Hampshire (UK) community led service (a collaboration of 15 GP practices, covering a population of 230,000 people). We have compared outcomes for patients admitted to Basingstoke & North Hampshire Hospital who were CO@h patients (COVID-19 patients with monitoring of SpO2 (n=137)), with non CO@h patients (those directly admitted without being monitored by CO@h (n=633)). Odds Ratio analysis was performed to contrast the likelihood of patient outcomes resulting in 30 day mortality, ICU admission and length of stay greater than 3, 7, 14, and 28 days. Results: Hospital length of stay was reduced by an average of 6.3 days for CO@h patients (6.9 95% CI [5.6 - 8.1]) in comparison to Non-CO@h (13.2 95% CI [12.2 - 14.1]). The most significant odds ratio effect was on mortality (0.23 95%CI [0.11 - 0.49]), followed by length of stay > 14 days (OR 0.23 95%CI [0.13 - 0.42]), length of stay > 28 days (OR 0.23 95%CI [0.08 - 0.65]), length of stay > 7 days (OR 0.35 95%CI [0.24 - 0.52]), and length of stay > 3 days (OR 0.52 95%CI [0.35 - 0.78]). Mortality and length of stay outcomes were statistically significant. Only 5/137 (3.6%) where admitted to ICU compared with 52/633 (8.2%) for Non-CO@h. Conclusions: CO@h has demonstrated considerably improved patient outcomes reducing the odds of longer length hospital stays and mortality.","Boniface, M.; Burns, D.; Duckworth, C.; Duruiheoma, F.; Armitage, H.; Ratcliffe, N.; Duffy, J.; O'Keeffe, C.; Inada-Kim, M.",,551,23

The cellular distribution of Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the critical enzyme for SARS-CoV-2 infection, in the human heart is unknown. We explore the underlying mechanism that leads to increased susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 in patients with cardiovascular diseases and patients of cardiac dysfunction have increased risk of multi-organ injury compared with patients of normal cardiac function. Methods and Results: We analyzed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data in both normal and failing hearts. The results demonstrated that ACE2 is present in cardiomyocytes (CMs) and non-CMs, while the number of ACE2-postive (ACE2+) CMs and ACE2 gene expression in these CMs are significantly increased in the failing hearts. Interestingly, both brain natriuretic peptides (BNP) and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) are significantly up-regulated in the ACE2+ CMs, which is consistent with other studies that ACE2, ANP, and BNP increased in HF patients. We found that genes related to virus entry, virus replication and suppression of interferon-gamma signaling are all up-regulated in failing CMs, and the increase was significantly higher in ACE2+ CMs, suggesting that these CMs may be more vulnerable to virus infection. As the level of expression of both ACE2 and BNP in CMs were up-regulated, we further performed retrospective analysis of the plasma BNP levels and clinical outcomes of 91 COVID-19 patients from a single-center. Patients with higher plasma BNP were associated with significantly higher mortality and expression levels of inflammatory and infective markers. Conclusion: In the failing heart, the upregulation of ACE2 and virus infection associated genes could potentially facilitate SARS-CoV-2 virus entry and replication in these vulnerable cardiomyocyte subsets. COVID-19 patients with higher plasma BNP levels had poorer clinical outcomes. These observations may allude to a potential regulatory association between ACE2 and BNP in mediating myocarditis associated with COVID-19.","Ma, Mengqiu; Xu, Yanhua; Su, Yang; Ong, Sang-Bing; Hu, Xingdong; Chai, Min; Zhao, Maojun; Li, Hong; Fan, Xiaojuan; Chen, Yingjie; Xu, Dachun; Xu, Xiaojiang",Front Cardiovasc Med,551,24

Specifically, coronaviruses induce the formation of double-membrane vesicles in infected cells. Although these double-membrane vesicles have been well characterized, the mechanism behind their formation remains unclear, including which viral proteins are responsible. Here, we use transfection of plasmid constructs encoding full-length versions of the three transmembrane-containing nonstructural proteins (nsps) of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus to examine the ability of each to induce double-membrane vesicles in tissue culture. nsp3 has membrane disordering and proliferation ability, both in its full-length form and in a C-terminal-truncated form. nsp3 and nsp4 working together have the ability to pair membranes. nsp6 has membrane proliferation ability as well, inducing perinuclear vesicles localized around the microtubule organizing center. Together, nsp3, nsp4, and nsp6 have the ability to induce double-membrane vesicles that are similar to those observed in SARS coronavirus-infected cells.

Avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis (IBV) has been adapted to embryonated chicken eggs, primary chicken kidney (CK) cells, monkey kidney cell line Vero, and other human and animal cells. Here we report that acquisition of the cell–cell fusion activity by amino acid mutations in the S protein determines the infectivity of IBV in cultured cells. Expression of S protein derived from Vero- and CK-adapted strains showed efficient induction of membrane fusion. However, expression of S protein cloned from the third passage of IBV in chicken embryo (EP3) did not show apparent syncytia formation. By construction of chimeric S constructs and site-directed mutagenesis, a point mutation (L857-F) at amino acid position 857 in the heptad repeat 1 region of S protein was shown to be responsible for its acquisition of the cell–cell fusion activity. Furthermore, a G405-D point mutation in the S1 domain, which was acquired during further propagation of Vero-adapted IBV in Vero cells, could enhance the cell–cell fusion activity of the protein. Re-introduction of L857 back to the S gene of Vero-adapted IBV allowed recovery of variants that contain the introduced L857. However, compensatory mutations in S1 and some distant regions of S2 were required for restoration of the cell–cell fusion activity of S protein carrying L857 and for the infectivity of the recovered variants in cultured cells. This study demonstrates that acquisition of the cell–cell fusion activity in S protein determines the selection and/or adaptation of a coronavirus from chicken embryo to cultured cells of human and animal origins.","Yamada, Yoshiyuki; Liu, Xiao Bo; Fang, Shou Guo; Tay, Felicia P.

Most common changes in SARS‐CoV‐2 are single or point nucleotide substitutions; meanwhile, insertions and deletions (indels) have been identified as a less frequent source of viral genetic variability. Here, we report the emergence of a 12‐nucleotide deletion in ORF7a, resulting in a 4‐amino acid in‐frame deletion. The Δ12 variant was identified in viruses from patients of a single outbreak and represents the first report of this deletion in South American isolates.

Distance teaching has been adopted during school closures to suspend classes without suspending learning. Scholars have claimed that distance teaching is more effective than face-to-face teaching and can replace face-to-face courses. However, further investigation is required to confirm whether distance learning is suitable for all types of courses and all students. Thanks to the effective containment of COVID-19 outbreaks in Taiwan, universities in Taiwan face a less problematic situation than do those in other countries; however, plans and preparations remain essential. The present study recruited 18,085 students from a technology university in Taiwan and used the baseline data of the past three academic years before COVID-19 (2016–2018) to explore the influences of course type and gender on distance learning performance. The results revealed that compulsory courses are more suitable for distance learning courses, whereas face-to-face teaching is more suitable for elective and general education courses. The learning performance of males and females is also different: face-to-face courses are more suitable for males, whereas no significant difference between teaching methods was observed in females. This result suggests that not all courses offered by the university are suitable for distance learning courses, and not all students are adept at distance learning. Based on these results, it is recommended that a new teaching model be established for the post-COVID-19 era.","Hsiao, Yu-Chen",Educ Inf Technol (Dordr),551,5

Maternity care disruptions have been surveyed, but not those related to vulnerable small newborns. We aimed to survey reported disruptions to small and sick newborn care worldwide and undertake thematic analysis of healthcare providers’ experiences and proposed mitigation strategies. METHODS: Using a widely disseminated online survey in three languages, we reached out to neonatal healthcare providers. We collected data on COVID-19 preparedness, effects on health personnel and on newborn care services, including kangaroo mother care (KMC), as well as disruptors and solutions. RESULTS: We analysed 1120 responses from 62 countries, mainly low and middle-income countries (LMICs). Preparedness for COVID-19 was suboptimal in terms of guidelines and availability of personal protective equipment. One-third reported routine testing of all pregnant women, but 13% had no testing capacity at all. More than 85% of health personnel feared for their own health and 89% had increased stress. Newborn care practices were disrupted both due to reduced care-seeking and a compromised workforce. More than half reported that evidence-based interventions such as KMC were discontinued or discouraged. Separation of the mother–baby dyad was reported for both COVID-positive mothers (50%) and those with unknown status (16%). Follow-up care was disrupted primarily due to families’ fear of visiting hospitals (~73%). CONCLUSION: Newborn care providers are stressed and there is lack clarity and guidelines regarding care of small newborns during the pandemic. There is an urgent need to protect life-saving interventions, such as KMC, threatened by the pandemic, and to be ready to recover and build back better.","Rao, Suman P N; Minckas, Nicole; Medvedev, Melissa M; Gathara, David; Y N, Prashantha; Seifu Estifanos, Abiy; Silitonga, Alfrida Camelia; Jadaun, Arun Singh; Adejuyigbe, Ebunoluwa A; Brotherton, Helen; Arya, Sugandha; Gera, Rani; Ezeaka, Chinyere V; Gai, Abdou; Gobezayehu, Abebe Gebremariam; Dube, Queen; Kumar, Aarti; Naburi, Helga; Chiume, Msandeni; Tumukunde, Victor; Medhanyie, Araya Abrha; Plange-Rhule, Gyikua; Shabini, Josephine; Ohuma, Eric O; Tadele, Henok; W/Gebriel, Fitsum; Hadgu, Amanuel; Alamineh, Lamesgin; Mehta, Rajesh; Molyneux, Elizabeth; Lawn, Joy E",BMJ Glob Health,551,29

We sought to evaluate SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD)-specific antibodies, their duration, and capacity for SARS-CoV-2 neutralization in volunteers while the pandemic spread within our community starting in March 2020. Those participants with the highest starting titers had the longest-lasting response, up to 12 months post-diagnosis. SARS-CoV-2 neutralization capacity was correlated with anti-RBD antibody levels. The majority of our participants with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis had very mild or asymptomatic infections. We also detected low and largely non-neutralizing anti-RBD IgG titers in a few participants with no known COVID-19 diagnosis. Finally, we found that antibody responses induced by vaccination were significantly higher than those induced by natural infection. Thus, our study suggests that vaccination is still critical even for those naturally infected or diagnosed with COVID-19.","Hedges, Jodi F.; Thompson, Macy A.; Snyder, Deann T.; Robison, Amanda; Taylor, Matthew P.; Jutila, Mark A.",Vaccines (Basel),551,1

Data regarding the safety of various models of delivery are limited. OBJECTIVES: To review outcomes of a nurse-led OPAT vancomycin monitoring service. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of consecutive patients referred to a nurse-led OPAT vancomycin clinic from December 2015 to March 2018. Patients were administered IV vancomycin in the home with active laboratory monitoring of vancomycin trough levels, renal function and complete blood count using an integrated electronic database linked with community laboratories (virtual vancomycin clinic, VVC). Monitoring was coordinated by nurses with physician approval of recommended dosing changes. Data were extracted from the electronic medical record. Demographics; clinical indication; microbial aetiology; culture source; antimicrobial regimen(s); serum creatinine and vancomycin trough values; initiation, discharge and completion dates; hospitalizations; adverse events; and outcomes were all evaluated. RESULTS: Two hundred and seventy-five patients underwent a total of 301 courses of OPAT with vancomycin; 285 courses were completed. The rate of treatment discontinuation due to adverse effects was 33/301 (11.0%), with 15/33 (45.5%) being due to renal adverse effects (15/301 [5.0%] of episodes). Two of 15 (18.2%) patients developed stage 2 acute kidney injury (AKI), and no patients had stage 3 AKI or required haemodialysis. Nine of 301 (3.0%) required readmission for treatment failure.

Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) is one such method, in common use for decontamination of hospital rooms. Practical technologies designed to monitor UVGI ensure the delivery of sufficient doses for germicidal efficacy. Existing UVGI dosimeters rely on intermittent measurements of intensity as the basis for a numerical integration scheme that approximates dose. Traditional devices are ineffective, particularly with pulsed UVGI lamps that emit pulses of light with durations shorter than the interval of measurement. Here, we present a compact, accumulation mode dosimeter (AMD) that detects continuously, as opposed to intermittently, at single or multiple UVGI wavelengths. The AMD utilizes an array of photodiodes and supercapacitors to passively transduce and capture photocurrent generated by UVGI without the use of external power. The accumulated voltage across the supercapacitors then serves as a measure of UVGI dose. A key result is that sampling intervals of AMD do not constrain measurement accuracy. When implemented with a wireless transponder, AMD supports a light-adaptive sampling scheme designed to adjust the sampling interval to the intensity and period of UVGI exposure. Compared to time-based sampling schemes adopted by conventional sensors, light-adaptive approaches autonomously optimize battery life by minimizing current consumption during periods of low or no UVGI. Benchtop studies of the use of this technology with pulsed Xenon lamps (pulse similar to 5 ms) sampled at long intervals (>1s) highlight the key features of operation. Demonstration of AMD during UVGI of E. Coli cultures represents an example in dose dependent effects on disinfection.","Heo, S. Y.; Kwon, K.; Chan, M. C.; Gutruf, P.; Burton, A.; Banks, T.; Duan, C.

This cross-sectional, multi-methods study examined differences in language used to describe personal experiences, and mental health, based on sleep quality during the early stages of the pandemic. N = 1745 participants (mean age 42.97 ± 14.46 years) from 63 countries responded to the survey. Sleep quality was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and mental health was examined using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, the State Trait Anxiety Inventory, the Perceived Stress Scale and the UCLA-Loneliness Scale. Quantitative analysis of qualitative, language content of personal experiences was conducted using free-text responses and comments to a question on the survey. Almost 50% of the participants reported poor sleep quality, which was linked to a more negative emotional tone and greater mentions of money or finance related words. Good sleepers reported more positive emotional tone in their experiences. Greater reports of clinical state anxiety, moderate depression and moderate stress were observed in poor sleepers, even after accounting for demographics and pandemic-related factors such as loneliness, financial concerns and risk of contracting COVID-19 disease. Results from this study highlight an urgent need for sleep-related public health interventions. Practitioner education, sleep screening for those with mental health conditions, and encouraging people to adopt digital tools may help to reduce the burden of poor sleep on mental health. While the pandemic itself is a stressful and uncertain time, improving sleep can support positive emotion regulation, improving mood and consequential action.","Varma, Prerna; Burge, Malisa; Meaklim, Hailey; Junge, Moira; Jackson, Melinda L.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,551,26

However this social restriction led to disturbed daily routine and lifestyle behaviour that is needed to be attended for proper therapeutic management of overall health during such crisis. The impact of lockdown on the most apparent behavioral changes viz. sleep-wake behaviour, major meal timings, and digital screen duration of Indians were investigated. In addition the effects of gender and age were explored. METHODS: After seeking permission from Ethical Institution, an online questionnaire based survey was circulated within India in the first week of May, 2020 for which total 1511 male and female (age ≥18 years) subjects participated. The sleep-wake behavior observed were sleep-wake timings, sleep duration, mid sleep time (MST) as function of lockdown, and social (lockdown) jetlag (SJL = MST before lockdown-MST during lockdown). RESULTS: The sleep onset-wakeup and meal times were significantly delayed during lockdown, which was more pronounced in younger age group. The sleep duration increased, specifically in young individuals during lockdown. Females showed more delayed sleep onset-waking times and first meal timing with longer sleep duration during lockdown. Increased digital media duration was observed in all age groups, primarily in males. The younger age group and specifically female reported higher SJL and delayed MST. A positive association was obtained between sleep duration & first meal time, and SJL & major meal timings/screen duration, and a significant negative relationship of sleep duration and SJL with age. CONCLUSION: The study shows delayed sleep-wake schedule, meal timings and increased digital media duration among Indians during COVID-19 lockdown compared to before lockdown. Also, gender and age emerged as important mediating factors for this alteration. The pandemic has given opportunity to sleep more and compensate for the sleep. In spite of that, the higher social jetlag in young age group and female showed the compromised sleep and maladaption with societal timing. These findings have applied implications in sleep health during longer social isolation conditions and for proper therapeutic management.

Here, we argue that cognitive modeling can be used to enhance the test-retest reliability of the behavioral measures by recovering individual-level parameters from behavioral data. We tested this empirically with the Probabilistic Stimulus Selection (PSS) task, which is used to measure a participant’s sensitivity to positive or negative reinforcement. An analysis of 400,000 simulations from an Adaptive Control of Thought-Rational (ACT-R) model of this task showed that the poor reliability of the task is due to the instability of the end-estimates: because of the way the task works, the same participants might sometimes end up having apparently opposite scores. To recover the underlying interpretable parameters and enhance reliability, we used a Bayesian Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) procedure. We were able to obtain reliable parameters across sessions (intraclass correlation coefficient ≈ 0.5). A follow-up study on a modified version of the task also found the same pattern of results, with very poor test-retest reliability in behavior but moderate reliability in recovered parameters (intraclass correlation coefficient ≈ 0.4). Collectively, these results imply that this approach can further be used to provide superior measures in terms of reliability, and bring greater insights into individual differences.","Xu, Yinan; Stocco, Andrea",Comput Brain Behav,551,10

Participants completed scales probing adaptation indicators: financial status, adherence to preventive measures, mental health, and COVID-19 related perceptions. Background measures, including the level of symptoms of ADHD, were collected. RESULTS: Adaptation indicators negatively correlated with the level of symptoms of ADHD. Financial decline explained a small portion of the link between ADHD and decreased mental health. Background risk-taking, anti-social, and pro-social behavior partially explained the link between ADHD and non-adherence to preventive measures. COVID-19 related perceptions also partially explained that link. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that people with ADHD are more vulnerable to the challenges created by the COVID-19 pandemic and therefore deserve special attention and care.","Pollak, Yehuda; Shoham, Rachel; Dayan, Haym; Gabrieli-Seri, Ortal; Berger, Itai",J Atten Disord,551,16

All sera tested contained Ab to cryptic FAH epitopes according with results from western-blot tests, whereas ELISA data indicated that some of these same sera did recognize native epitopes of the autoantigen (autoAg). Such differences were detected in individual sera from various mouse strains, and were ascribed to the fact that proteins insolubilized on solid supports expose a variety of conformational and cryptic antigenic determinants. On the other hand, whereas results from both experimental protocols showed that anti-MHV Ab did not cross-react with the soluble autoAg, the opposite situation did not show analogous results. Thus, binding of autoAb to insolubilized FAH could be inhibited by MHV depending on the mouse serum or the experimental protocol used. Additionally, a set of synthetic homologous peptides from mouse FAH and various viral proteins was employed to analyze the Ab repertoire of MHV-infected mice. Results indicated that two homologous peptides were recognized by most Ab: the N-terminal sequences (1–10) from FAH and the nucleocapside, both sharing 50% of identity, and sequence 2317–2326 of the RNA polymerase, a peptide showing 30% of identity with FAH 11–20. Results indicated that MHV-infection triggers at least three distinct Ab populations: anti-MHV, anti-FAH and cross-reacting Ab. This cross-reaction implies either sequential or conformational epitopes from both the viral proteins and the autoAg and may differ between individuals.","Mathieu, Patricia A.; Gómez, Karina A.; Coutelier, Jean-Paul; Retegui, Lilia A.",J Autoimmun,551,24

Thus, it is important to understand how global factors linked with the functioning of the Anthropocene are responsible for the COVID-19 outbreak. We tested hypotheses that the number of COVID-19 cases, number of deaths and growth rate of recorded infections: (1) are positively associated with population density as well as (2) proportion of the human population living in urban areas as a proxies of interpersonal contact rate, (3) age of the population in a given country as an indication of that population’s susceptibility to COVID-19; (4) net migration rate and (5) number of tourists as proxies of infection pressure, and negatively associated with (5) gross domestic product which is a proxy of health care quality. Data at the country level were compiled from publicly available databases and analysed with gradient boosting regression trees after controlling for confounding factors (e.g. geographic location). We found a positive association between the number of COVID-19 cases in a given country and gross domestic product, number of tourists, and geographic longitude. The number of deaths was positively associated with gross domestic product, number of tourists in a country, and geographic longitude. The effects of gross domestic product and number of tourists were non-linear, with clear thresholds above which the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths increased rapidly. The growth rate of COVID-19 cases was positively linked to the number of tourists and gross domestic product. The growth rate of COVID-19 cases was negatively associated with the mean age of the population and geographic longitude. Growth was slower in less urbanised countries. This study demonstrates that the characteristics of the human population and high mobility, but not population density, may help explain the global spread of the virus. In addition, geography, possibly via climate, may play a role in the pandemic. The unexpected positive and strong association between gross domestic product and number of cases, deaths, and growth rate suggests that COVID-19 may be a new civilisation disease affecting rich economies.","Skórka, Piotr; Grzywacz, Beata; Moroń, Dawid; Lenda, Magdalena",PLoS One,551,20

Methods: A self-administered online survey on monitoring adverse reactions post vaccination was conducted among the staff who worked at and were vaccinated in a tertiary hospital in Taizhou, China, from February 24 to 7 March 2021. A total of 1526 subjects responded to the questionnaire when they received an e-mail or an e-poster on WeChat. Results: The incidences of overall adverse reactions after the first and second injections were 15.6% (238/1526) and 14.6% (204/1397), respectively. The most common adverse reaction was localized pain at the injection site, with an incidence of 9.6% and 10.7% after each dose, accounting for 61.8% and 73.0% of adverse reactions, respectively. Fatigue, muscle pain, and headache were the most common systemic adverse reactions. Conclusions: These findings implied that the inactivated CoronaVac vaccine has an acceptable safety profile among healthcare workers due to the low incidence of self-reported adverse reactions. This may boost public confidence in nationwide mass vaccination campaigns.","Zhang, Mei-Xian; Zhang, Tong-Tong; Shi, Gui-Feng; Cheng, Feng-Min; Zheng, Yan-Ming; Tung, Tao-Hsin; Chen, Hai-Xiao",Expert review of vaccines,551,16

OBJECTIVE: The arrhythmic safety profile of HCQ monotherapy, which remains under investigation as a therapeutic and prophylactic agent in COVID-19, is less established and we sought to evaluate this. METHODS: In 245 consecutive patients with COVID-19 admitted to the University of Washington hospital system between March 9 and May 10, 2020, we identified 111 treated with HCQ monotherapy. Patients treated with HCQ underwent a systematic arrhythmia and QT interval surveillance protocol including serial electrocardiograms (ECG) (baseline, following second HCQ dose). The primary endpoint was in-hospital sustained ventricular arrhythmia or arrhythmic cardiac arrest. Secondary endpoints included clinically significant QTc prolongation. RESULTS: A total of 111 patients with COVID-19 underwent treatment with HCQ monotherapy (mean age 62±16 years, 44 women [39%], serum creatinine 0.9 [interquartile range 0.4] mg/dL). There were no instances of sustained ventricular arrythmia or arrhythmic cardiac arrest. In 75 patients with serial ECGs, clinically significant QTc prolongation was observed in a minority (N=5 [7%]). In patients with serial ECGs, there was no significant change in the QTc interval in pre-specified subgroups of interest, including those with prevalent cardiovascular disease or baseline use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis inhibitors. CONCLUSION: In the context of a systematic monitoring protocol, HCQ monotherapy in hospitalized COVID-19 patients was not associated with malignant ventricular arrhythmia.

Improving IHR compliance provides grounds for better health system strengthening, which is key to moving countries closer towards Universal Health Coverage. Multisectoral, collaborative working within and across sectors is fundamental to improving IHR (2005) compliance, and for that, governance is the best lever of the health system. This paper highlights the importance of the relationship between governance and IHR in the context of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) which follow the fundamental principle of interdependence; SDGs interlink with one another. We consider governance (SDG 16) and how it influences the IHR capacity of SDG 3 (health and well-being for all at all ages). This paper considers the successes of the Myanmar Ministry of Health and Sports thus far in improving IHR compliance and highlights that an even greater focus on health system governance would lead to more sustainable outcomes. Nurturing an institutional culture with enforced rules, which are conducive for improved accountability through inclusive participation would further improve Myanmar IHR strengthening efforts. Without those principles of good governance, the developed IHR capacities cannot be sustained or owned by Myanmar people.

Clinical data reveal that in severe COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 infects the lung, leading to a frequently lethal triad of respiratory insufficiency, acute cardiovascular failure, and coagulopathy. Physiologically, ACE2 plays a role in the regulation of three systems that could potentially be involved in the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19: the kinin-kallikrein system, resulting in acute lung inflammatory edema; the renin-angiotensin system, promoting cardiovascular instability; and the coagulation system, leading to thromboembolism. Here we analyzed ~130,000 human lung single-cell transcriptomes and show that key elements of the kinin-kallikrein, renin-angiotensin and coagulation systems are co-expressed with ACE2 in alveolar cells, which could explain how changes in ACE2 promoted by SARS-CoV-2 cell entry result in the development of the three most severe clinical components of COVID-19.","Sidarta-Oliveira, D.; Poblete Jara, C.; Ferruzzi, A.

In a subset of infected subjects, pneumonia, multi-organ failure, and eventually death can occur. Frail patients and those with comorbidities are believed to be at increased risk of severe manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Patients with light chain (AL) amyloidosis have a hematologic malignancy that causes multi-organ dysfunction and can be at higher risk of complications and death. The International Society of Amyloidosis (ISA) has issued a guidance (Kastritis et al. BJH 2020, https://cms.cws.net/content/isaamyloidosis.org/files/ISA%20recommendations%20Covid-19%20v_%203_3.pdf) for patients with amyloidosis during the pandemic and called for an international data collection in April 2020. Aim of this study is to report the preliminary data of the ongoing international survey regarding systemic AL amyloidosis and COVID-19. Methods: The survey was proposed by the ISA Board and approved by the coordinating institution's Ethics Committee. All members of the ISA were invited to participate by email and a link for participation is online on ISA website. RedCap software was used for the data collection. Results: Twelve Institutions requested the access to the data collection system from 7 countries. At the data lock of July 26, 2020, 29 patients with systemic amyloidoses were collected from 7 different Institutions. Systemic AL amyloidosis patients reported so far were 19: 12 from the Pavia Amyloidosis Research and Treatment Center (Italy), 3 from the Boston Medical Center (USA), and 1 patient each from the Columbia University Hospital (New York, USA), Hospital Clinic (Barcelona, Spain), Clinica Universitaria de Navarra (Navarra, Spain) and Amyloidosis Centrum (Heidelberg, Germany). Eleven (58%) had heart involvement, 8 (42%) had kidney and two or more organs were involved in 9 patients (47%). The most frequent comorbidities reported were history of hypertension in 7 (37%) and cardiovascular diseases in 3 (16%). Four (21%) patients were newly diagnosed and treatment-naïve at the time SARS-CoV-2 infection was documented. The remaining 15 patients had received a median number of 2 previous lines of therapy (range 1-3). Nine (47%) patients were on active chemotherapy at the time of COVID-19 infection. Five were receiving daratumumab combinations, and the 4 remaining patients were on cyclophosphamide, bortezomib and dexamethasone, oral melphalan and dexamethasone, lenalidomide and ixazomib. Relevant concomitant medications were anti-hypertensive drugs in 26% of cases and diuretics in 21%. One patient was on dialysis. COVID-19-related symptoms were fever 11 (58%), cough 8 (42%), anosmia and ageusia. Pneumonia was documented in 10 (53%) patients, 5 of whom had acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (26%). Four of them were treated with non-mechanical ventilation and one accessed intensive care support. Three of the 5 patients with severe COVID-19 had heart involvement, 2/5 had concomitant heart and kidney involved and 3 was infected while on active chemotherapy. Azytromicin was used in 6 (26%) cases, which was in combination with hydroxycloroquine in 4 of them. Three patients received steroids as treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection, while anticoagulant therapy was used only in two cases. Lopinavir, tocilizumab and sarilumab were used in one patient each. Four patients (21%) died in the whole cohort. Three had ARDS and one patient died few weeks after the recovery of COVID-19 infection. All deceased patients had heart involvement, 2 were on active therapy (daratumumab plus bortezomib and ixazomib plus dexamethasone). Two patients with kidney involvement at diagnosis, one with ARDS and one with a radiological documented pneumonia treated with non-mechanical ventilation recovered from COVID-19 but developed subsequent worsening of renal function, requiring dialysis in one case. Conclusions: The fatality rate and the proportion of patients with severe COVID-19 in this series is in the higher range of reports from the general population. Severe SARS-CoV-2 infection can result in renal failure in patients with renal AL amyloidosis.

A multi-national survey about such mental health information about COVID-19 was conducted in May 2020 across six Asian regions: Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand. Data were collected from a population representative sample of 11,895 adults on their stress symptoms and reactions to COVID-19 and the related public health measures. 59.1% of the respondents showed at least one substantial stress symptom. The situation was particularly worrying in South Korea, where 75% of the respondents reported substantial stress symptoms. Respondents who were young, educated, lived in an urban area, had a high socio-economic status, had a history of chronic illness or mental illness, or who lived with a pregnant woman, elderly or children were most vulnerable to stress during the pandemic. Stress reactions showed a positive relationship with the amount of time spent following news about the COVID-19 outbreak. Asian adults coped with their stress by preparing safety equipment and extra daily commodities (62.4%) and by following government-issued public health measures (60.1%). Most Asian (71%) also frequently checked on the safety of family members and friends to keep each other safe. The COVID-19 pandemic and the associated stringent public health measures have largely increased the prevalence of substantial stress symptoms across multiple Asian regions. Governments should prepare this mental health pandemic and the associated social repercussions.","Yue, Ricci P.H.; Cheng, Edmund W.; Or, Nick H.K.; Yuen, Samson W.H.",,551,20

RESULTS: An analysis of official data from all 22 countries and territories in the Middle East, North Africa, the Horn of Africa, and Central Asia K=22 (a total of 438,717 cases) was performed. The total number of cases, recovered cases were 438,717,228,986, and deaths was 11,290 in the EMR. Meta-analytic pooling of the point estimates of recovery rate per country in the EMR was 52.5% (95% CI 52.3% - 52.6%). The lowest recovery rates were in Somalia (4.3%), and the highest rates were in Tunisia (87.4%).

Such development is important, for example, in the fight against the SARS-CoV-2 virus, in which covalent inhibitors can provide a promising tool for blocking M(pro), the main protease of the virus. This work develops a reliable and practical protocol for evaluating the binding free energy of covalent inhibitors. Our protocol presents a major advance over other approaches that do not consider the chemical contribution of the binding free energy. Our strategy combines the empirical valence bond method for evaluating the reaction energy profile and the PDLD/S-LRA/β method for evaluating the noncovalent part of the binding process. This protocol has been used in the calculations of the binding free energy of an α-ketoamide inhibitor of M(pro). Encouragingly, our approach reproduces the observed binding free energy. Our study of covalent inhibitors of cysteine proteases indicates that in the choice of an effective warhead it is crucial to focus on the exothermicity of the point on the free energy surface of a peptide cleavage that connects the acylation and deacylation steps. Overall, we believe that our approach should provide a powerful and effective method for in silico design of covalent drugs.","Mondal, Dibyendu; Warshel, Arieh",Biochemistry,551,21

It adversely affects the routine health care delivery and health service uptake by patients. However, its impact on care-seeking behaviour is largely unknown in Ethiopia. ObjectiveThis study was to determine the impact of the pandemic on care-seeking behaviour of patients with chronic health condition at Tikur Anbessa Specialized hospital in Addis Ababa. MethodsA cross-sectional hospital-based survey conducted between May and July 2020 on patients whose appointment was between March to June 2020. Sample of 750 patients were approached using phone call and data collection was done using a pretested questionnaire. After cleaning, the data entered in to IBM SPSS software package for analysis. ResultsA total of 644 patients with a median age of 25 years, and M: F ratio of 1:1.01 was described with a response rate of 86%. A loss to follow up, missed medication and death occurred in 70%, 12%, and 1.3% of the patients respectively. In the multivariable logistic regression analysis, patients above 60 years old were more likely to miss follow-up (OR-23.28 (9.32-58.15), P<001). Patients who reported fear of COVID-19 at the hospital were 19 times more likely to miss follow-up (adjusted OR=19.32, 95% CI:10.73-34.79, P<0.001), while patients who reported transportation problems were 6.5 times more likely to miss follow-up (adjusted OR=6.11, 95% CI:3.06-12.17, P<0.001). ConclusionsCOVID-19 pandemic affected the care-seeking behaviour of patients with chronic medical condition adversely and the impact was more pronounced among patients with severe disease, fear of COVID19 and with transportation problems. Education on preventive measures of COVID-19, use of phone clinic and improving chronic illness services at the local health institutions may reduce loss to follow-up among these patients.

The TARGET (Treatments Against RA and Effect on 18‐Fluorodeoxyglucose [(18)F‐FDG] Positron Emission Tomography [PET]/Computed Tomography [CT]) trial (NCT02374021) will enroll 150 patients with RA with active disease and an inadequate response to methotrexate. Participants will be randomized to add either a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor (etanercept or adalimumab) or sulfasalazine and hydroxychloroquine to their background methotrexate. Participants will undergo full‐body (18)F‐FDG–labelled PET scanning at baseline and after 6 months.

Despite evidence supporting its effectiveness and cost-effectiveness, uptake of the OBOT model has been relatively slow. One important barrier to faster diffusion of OBOT may be the financial challenges facing clinics that could adopt it. METHODS: We review key features and variants of the OBOT model, then discuss different approaches that have been used to fund it, and the findings from previous economic analyses of OBOT’s impact on organizational finances. We conclude by discussing the implications of these analyses for the financial sustainability of the OBOT delivery model. RESULTS: Like other novel services, OBOT poses challenges for providers due to its reliance on services which are ‘non-billable’ in a fee-for-service environment. A variety of approaches exist for covering the non-billable costs, but which approaches are feasible depends on local payer policies. The scale of the challenges varies with clinic size, organizational affiliations and the policies of the state where the clinic operates. Small clinics in a purely fee-for-service environment may be particularly challenged in pursuing OBOT, given the need to fund a dedicated staff and extra administrative work. The current pandemic may pose both opportunities and challenges for the sustainability of OBOT, with expanded access to telemedicine, but also uncertainty about the durability of the expansion. CONCLUSION: The reimbursement environment for OBOT delivery varies widely around the US, and is evolving as Medicare (and possibly other payers) introduce alternative payment approaches.

Systemic corticosteroid has been sometimes administered to severe infectious diseases combined with the specific treatment. However, as lack of the specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug, systemic steroid treatment has not been recommended for COVID-19. We report here three cases of the COVID-19 pneumonia successfully treated with ciclesonide inhalation. Rationale of the treatment is to mitigate the local inflammation with inhaled steroid that stays in the lung and to inhibit proliferation of the virus by antiviral activity. Larger and further studies are warranted to confirm the result of these cases.","Iwabuchi, Keisuke; Yoshie, Koichiro; Kurakami, Yuichi; Takahashi, Kota; Kato, Yoshio; Morishima, Tsuneo",J Infect Chemother,551,28

The aim of this selective scoping review was to investigate the influence of gross income on accessing local green spaces to engage in PA and the associated health benefits. Methods: A scoping review was conducted of international literature to facilitate the clarification of the research question. Findings: 15 papers were critically appraised under two themes: (1) environments and well-being and (2) PA and income/socioeconomic status and impact on the frequency, duration and opportunity to engage in PA. Interpretation: Income is related to differential use of green and blue spaces for PA, due mainly to access issues. People who live in lower socioeconomic areas tend to be more sedentary and there are also gender differences related to PA in built environments. Conclusion: There is an effect of income in using green spaces for PA, but the relationship is non-linear, and there is still a lack of knowledge about what kind of green spaces are best for health benefits. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the importance of accessing green local spaces to engage in physical exercise to improve well-being among the public.","Spencer, Llinos Haf; Lynch, Mary; Lawrence, Catherine L.; Edwards, Rhiannon Tudor",Int J Environ Res Public Health,551,16

MATERIAL AND METHODS: In a case-control study, 14 patients with severe bilateral COVID-19 pneumonia (positive RT-PCR), treated with SOC and rectal ozone, were evaluated before-and-after treatment and compared with SOC (14 patients) in a 10-day follow-up period. Ozone protocol consisted of 8 sessions (1 session/day) of intra-rectal ozone (150 mL volume, 35 μg/mL concentration [5.25mg total dose]). The SOC protocol included O(2) supply, antivirals (Remdesivir), corticosteroids (Dexamethasone/Metilprednisolone), monoclonal antibodies (Anakinra/Tocilizumab), antibiotics (Azytromicine), and anticoagulants (Enoxaparine). Primary outcome variables were the following: (a) clinical (O(2) saturation and O(2) supply); (b) biochemical (lymphocyte count, fibrinogen, D-dimer, urea, ferritin, LDH, IL-6, and CRP); (c) radiological Taylor’s scale. Secondary outcome variables were the following: (a) hospitalization length of stay, (b) mortality rate. RESULTS: At baseline, ozone/SOC groups were not different on age, comorbidities, O(2) saturation, and O(2) supply. Patients in the ozone group improved O(2) saturation and decrease O(2) supply. SOC maintained O(2) saturation and required more O(2) supply. Lymphocyte count improved only in the ozone group and with statistical difference (p<0.05). Biomarkers of inflammation (fibrinogen, D-dimer, urea, LDH, CRP, and IL-6) decreased in both groups, but only significantly in favor of the ozone group (p<0.05). Ferritin showed a significant decrease in the ozone group but an increase on the SOC group. Radiological pneumonitis decreased on both groups but the decrease was only significant in the ozone group (p<0.0001). Mortality and length of stay, although not significant, were inferior in the ozone group. CONCLUSION: Compassionate use of rectal ozone improved O(2) saturation, reduced O(2) supply, decreased inflammation biomarkers, and improved Taylor’s radiological scale significantly when compared to the SOC group. Mortality and length of stay were inferior in the ozone group, but this difference was not significant.","Fernández-Cuadros, Marcos Edgar; Albaladejo-Florín, María Jesús; Álava-Rabasa, Sandra; Gallego-Galiana, Juan; Pérez-Cruz, Gerardo Fabiel; Usandizaga-Elio, Isabel; Pacios, Enrique; Torres-García, David E.; Peña-Lora, Daiana; Casique-Bocanegra, Luz; López-Muñoz, María Jesús; Rodríguez-de-Cía, Javier; Pérez-Moro, Olga Susana",SN Compr Clin Med,551,22

But while these experiments provide rich, detailed fitness data, theory is mostly used as a conceptual heuristic. Here, we evaluate how kin and multilevel selection theory perform as quantitative analysis tools. We reanalyse published microbial datasets and show that the canonical fitness models of both theories are almost always poor fits because they use statistical regressions misspecified for the strong selection and non-additive effects we show are widespread in microbial systems. We identify analytical practices in empirical research that suggest how theory might be improved, and show that analysing both individual and group fitness outcomes helps clarify the biology of selection. A data-driven approach to theory thus shows how kin and multilevel selection both have untapped potential as tools for quantitative understanding of social evolution in all branches of life.","Smith, Jeff; Inglis, R.

We analyzed case-data from the United States to investigate effects of temperature, precipitation, and UV Light on community transmission of SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: Daily reported cases of SARS-CoV-2 across the United States from 01/22/2020 to 04/03/2020 were analyzed. We used negative binomial regression modelling to investigate whether daily maximum temperature, precipitation, UV Index and the incidence 5 days later were related. We performed sensitivity analyses at 3 days, 7 days and 9 days to assess transmission lags. RESULTS: A maximum temperature greater than 52°F on a given day was associated with a lower rate of new cases at 5 days[IRR: 0.85(0.76,0.96)p=0.009]. Among observations with daily temperatures below 52°F, there was a significant inverse association between the maximum daily temperature and the rate of cases at 5 days [IRR 0.98(0.97,0.99)p=0.001]. The rate of new cases was predicted to be lower for theoretical states that maintained a stable maximum daily temperature above 52°F with a predicted 23-fewer cases per-million per-day by 25 days of the epidemic. A 1-unit higher UV index was associated with a lower rate at 5 days [IRR 0.97(0.95,0.99)p=0.004]. Precipitation was not associated with a greater rate of cases at 5 days [IRR 0.98(0.89,1.08)p=0.65]. CONCLUSION: The incidence of disease declines with increasing temperature up until 52°F and is lower at warmer versus cooler temperatures. However, the association between temperature and transmission is small and transmission is likely to remain high at warmer temperatures.","Sehra, Shiv T; Salciccioli, Justin D; Wiebe, Douglas J; Fundin, Shelby; Baker, Joshua F",Clin Infect Dis,551,33

The onset of infection is associated with loss of smell sensation and blurred vision, headache with bronchopulmonary symptoms. The clinical observations of neurological abnormalities lead us to address the question, does the virus enter into brain and what is the underlying mechanism of brain infection? The working hypothesis is, SARS-COV-2 Spike epitopes modify blood brain barrier and infect glial cells to induce brain inflammation in genetically diverse human population. The hypothesis is tested by determining binding or interacting ability of virus Spike epitope peptides M1Lys60 and Ala240Glu300 with human toll-like receptor 8 (TLR 8),brain targeted Vascular Cell adhesion Molecules (VCAM1) proteins, Zonula Occludens (ZO), glial cell specific protein NDRG2 and Apo- S100B. The molecular dynamic experiments are performed, and root mean square deviation (RMSD) values are determined for interactions between the Spike peptides and selected proteins. The observations demonstrate formation of heterodimeric complex between the epitope peptides and selected protein structures. The viral epitopes have ability to bind with HLA-DRB1 15:01, 07:01 or 03.01 alleles thus found immunogenic in nature. The observations altogether suggest entry of these Spike protein epitopes into human brain cause inflammation.","Dasgupta, Subhajit; Bandyopadhyay, Mausumi",Med Hypotheses,551,1

In this context, how to accurately predict the turning point, duration and final scale of the epidemic in different countries, regions or cities is key to enabling decision makers and public health departments to formulate intervention measures and deploy resources. METHODS: Based on COVID-19 surveillance data and human mobility data, this study predicts the epidemic trends of national and state regional administrative units in the United States from July 27, 2020, to January 22, 2021, by constructing a SIRD model considering the factors of “lockdown” and “riot”. RESULTS: (1) The spread of the epidemic in the USA has the characteristics of geographical proximity. (2) During the lockdown period, there was a strong correlation between the number of COVID-19 infected cases and residents’ activities in recreational areas such as parks. (3) The turning point (the point of time in which active infected cases peak) of the early epidemic in the USA was predicted to occur in September. (4) Among the 10 states experiencing the most severe epidemic, New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Texas, Illinois, Pennsylvania and California are all predicted to meet the turning point in a concentrated period from July to September, while the turning point in Georgia is forecast to occur in December. No turning points in Florida and Arizona were foreseen for the forecast period, with the number of infected cases still set to be growing rapidly. CONCLUSIONS: The model was found accurately to predict the future trend of the epidemic and can be applied to other countries. It is worth noting that in the early stage there is no vaccine or approved pharmaceutical intervention for this disease, making the fight against the pandemic reliant on non-pharmaceutical interventions. Therefore, reducing mobility, focusing on personal protection and increasing social distance remain still the most effective measures to date.","Zheng, Zhicheng; Xie, Zhixiang; Qin, Yaochen; Wang, Kun; Yu, Yan; Fu, Pinde",BMC Public Health,551,11

In the UK, a public health driven policy of population ‘lockdown’ has had enormous personal and economic impact. METHODS: We compare UK response and outcomes with European countries of similar income and healthcare resources. We calibrate estimates of the economic costs as different % loss in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) against possible benefits of avoiding life years lost, for different scenarios where current COVID‐19 mortality and comorbidity rates were used to calculate the loss in life expectancy and adjusted for their levels of poor health and quality of life. We then apply a quality‐adjusted life years (QALY) value of £30,000 (maximum under national guidelines). RESULTS: There was a rapid spread of cases and significant variation both in severity and timing of both implementation and subsequent reductions in social restrictions. There was less variation in the trajectory of mortality rates and excess deaths, which have fallen across all countries during May/June 2020. The average age at death and life expectancy loss for non‐COVID‐19 was 79.1 and 11.4 years respectively while COVID‐19 were 80.4 and 10.1 years; including adjustments for life‐shortening comorbidities and quality of life plausibly reduces this to around 5 QALY lost for each COVID‐19 death. The lowest estimate for lockdown costs incurred was 40% higher than highest benefits from avoiding the worst mortality case scenario at full life expectancy tariff and in more realistic estimations they were over 5 times higher. Future scenarios showed in the best case a QALY value of £220k (7xNICE guideline) and in the worst‐case £3.7m (125xNICE guideline) was needed to justify the continuation of lockdown. CONCLUSION: This suggests that the costs of continuing severe restrictions are so great relative to likely benefits in lives saved that a rapid easing in restrictions is now warranted.","Miles, David; Stedman, Mike; Heald, Adrian H",Int J Clin Pract,551,24

However, previous innovation research has concentrated primarily on the organizational level. In contrast, this study focuses on innovation by individual employees. The specific aim is to examine factors with potential impact on individual employee innovation in hospital organizations. Thus, the study significantly deepens and broadens previous research on innovation in the domain of health services. METHODS: A conceptual model was developed and tested on a sample of hospital employees (n = 1008). Partial least-squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) was used to analyse the data with SmartPLS 3 software in two steps involving a measurement model and a structural model. Mediation analysis was used to test the proposed indirect effects. RESULTS: Hospital employees’ individual innovative behaviour is directly and positively associated with individual creativity (β = 0.440), psychological capital (β = 0.34) and leadership autonomy support (β = 0.07). The relationships between leadership autonomy support, psychological capital and individual innovative behaviour are all mediated by employees’ creativity. Psychological capital mediates the relationship between leadership autonomy support and individual innovative behaviour. Overall, the proposed model explains 50% of the variance in hospital employees’ innovative behaviour. CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals a complex pattern of links between innovative behaviour and leadership autonomy support, employees’ creativity and employees’ psychological capital.

Several therapeutic interventions are suggested, from the implementation of breastfeeding to the glucose intravenous administration. Oral dextrose gel massaged into the infant’s inner cheek is a recent treatment option of asymptomatic hypoglycemia, after which oral feeding is encouraged. This approach seems to reduce the admission of infants to neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) so favouring maternal bonding and breastfeeding success at discharge. METHODS: In our ward, we prospectively compared a group of near-term neonates, (Gr2, n = 308) at risk for hypoglycemia, treated with an innovative protocol based on the addition of 40% oral dextrose gel (Destrogel, Orsana®,Italy) administered by massaging gums and cheek with historical matching newborns (Gr1, n = 389) treated with a formerly used protocol, as control group. The primary outcome was occurrence of NICU admission and the requirement of intravenous glucose administration; while discharge with full breastfeeding was the secondary outcome. RESULTS: In Gr1, 39/389 (10%) infants presented with asymptomatic hypoglycemia, 19/39 were transferred to the NICU, and 14/39 required intravenous glucose treatment. In Gr2, among the 30/308 infants with asymptomatic hypoglycemia managed according to the new protocol, 3/30 were transferred to the NICU and received intravenous glucose infusion. The mean duration of hospitalization respectively was 6.43 (± 6.36) and 3.73 ± 1.53 days (p < 0.001). At discharge, 7.7% of the infants in Gr1 and 30% of the infants in Gr2 were exclusively breastfed (p = 0.02). Considering Gr1 vs Gr2, the number of patients that were transferred to NICU was 19 (48.7%) vs 3 (10%) (p = 0.001) and the number of infants that needed intravenous glucose infusion was 14 (35.9%) vs 3 (10%) (p = 0.01), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In our population of near term infants, the introduction of 40% oral dextrose gel to the protocol, helped in the safe management of asymptomatic hypoglycemia and, at the same time, implemented breastfeeding.","Meneghin, Fabio; Manzalini, Martina; Acunzo, Miriam; Daniele, Irene; Bastrenta, Petrina; Castoldi, Francesca; Cavigioli, Francesco; Zuccotti, Gian Vincenzo; Lista, Gianluca",Ital J Pediatr,551,20

While highly conserved, SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV PLpro have contrasting Ub/Ubl substrate preferences. Using a combination of structural analyses and functional assays, we identify a molecular sensor within the S1 Ub-binding site of PLpro that serves as a key determinant of substrate specificity. Variations within the S1 sensor specifically alter cleavage of Ub substrates but not of the Ubl interferon-stimulated gene 15 protein (ISG15). Significantly, a variant of concern associated with immune evasion carries a mutation in the S1 sensor that enhances PLpro activity on Ub substrates. Collectively, our data identify the S1 sensor region as a potential hotspot of variability that could dramatically alter host antiviral immune responses to newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 lineages.","Patchett, Stephanie; Lv, Zongyang; Rut, Wioletta; Bekes, Miklos; Drag, Marcin; Olsen, Shaun K.; Huang, Tony T.",Cell Rep,551,1

Rigorous determination of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity is very difficult owing to the continuous evolution of the virus, with its single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variants and many lineages. However, it is urgently necessary to study the virus in depth, to understand the mechanism of its pathogenicity and virulence, and to develop effective therapeutic strategies. The present contribution summarizes in a succinct way the current knowledge on the evolutionary and structural features of the virus, with the aim of clarifying its mutational pattern and its possible role in the ongoing pandemic.","Giovanetti, Marta; Benedetti, Francesca; Campisi, Giovanni; Ciccozzi, Alessandra; Fabris, Silvia; Ceccarelli, Giancarlo; Tambone, Vittoradolfo; Caruso, Arnaldo; Angeletti, Silvia; Zella, Davide; Ciccozzi, Massimo",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,551,24

Experiments suggest that structural rearrangements dramatically enhance CoV2019 activity. We identify a new first stage of infection that precedes structural rearrangements by using biomolecular evolutionary theory to identify sequence differences enhancing viral attachment rates. We find a small cluster of mutations which show that CoV-2 has a new feature that promotes much stronger viral attachment and enhances contagiousness. The extremely dangerous dynamics of human coronavirus infection is a dramatic example of evolutionary approach of self-organized networks to criticality. It may favor a very successful vaccine. The identified mutations can be used to test the present theory experimentally.,"Phillips, J.C.",Physica A,551,16

METHODS: Two cross-sectional web surveys were conducted during lockdown (April 15-May 15, 2020) and seven months later (November 16-December 16, 2020). Lifestyle behaviors were self-reported by a multidimensional scale (SMILE-C). Two separate samples of respondents were analyzed. A multivariate regression model was performed to evaluate the association of SMILE-C scores with demographic and clinical variables. RESULTS: The sample comprised, 3412 participants from the first survey (S1) and in the S1 and 3635 from the second (S2). SMILE-C score decreased across surveys (p < 0.001). The rates of positive screenings for depression and anxiety were similar between the surveys, whereas those for alcohol abuse decreased (p < 0.001). Most participants in S2 reported that their lifestyle had not changed compared to those before the pandemic. Variables independently associated with an unhealthier lifestyle were working as an essential worker, lower educational level, previous mental disease, worse self-rated health, totally/moderate changes on diet, sleep or social support, as well as positive screenings for alcohol abuse, anxiety and depression. LIMITATIONS: The cross-sectional design and recruitment by non-probabilistic methods limit inferring causality and the external validity of the results. CONCLUSIONS: Overall lifestyle worsened seven months after the lockdown in Spain. Several demographic and clinical factors were associated with lifestyle scores. The contribution of common mental disorders to unhealthier lifestyles should be considered in order to prevent the negative impact of the pandemic.","Cervera-Martínez, Jose; Atienza-Carbonell, Beatriz; Mota, Jurema C.; Bobes-Bascarán, Teresa; Crespo-Facorro, Benedicto; Esteban, Cristina; García-Portilla, María Paz; Gomes-da-Costa, Susana; González-Pinto, Ana; Jaén-Moreno, M.

As a prelude to clinical application of the multicapillary column–ion mobility spectrometry for the evaluation of aldehyde exhalation, we, therefore: (1) identified the most abundant volatile aliphatic aldehydes originating from in vitro oxidation of various polyunsaturated fatty acids; (2) evaluated emittance of aldehydes from plastic parts of the breathing circuit; (3) conducted a pilot study for in vivo quantification of exhaled aldehydes in mechanically ventilated patients. Pentanal, hexanal, heptanal, and nonanal were quantifiable in the headspace of oxidizing polyunsaturated fatty acids, with pentanal and hexanal predominating. Plastic parts of the breathing circuit emitted hexanal, octanal, nonanal, and decanal, whereby nonanal and decanal were ubiquitous and pentanal or heptanal not being detected. Only pentanal was quantifiable in breath of mechanically ventilated surgical patients with a mean exhaled concentration of 13 ± 5 ppb. An explorative analysis suggested that pentanal exhalation is associated with mechanical power—a measure for the invasiveness of mechanical ventilation. In conclusion, exhaled pentanal is a promising non-invasive biomarker for lipid peroxidation inducing pathologies, and should be evaluated in future clinical studies, particularly for detection of lung injury.","Müller-Wirtz, Lukas Martin; Kiefer, Daniel; Ruffing, Sven; Brausch, Timo; Hüppe, Tobias; Sessler, Daniel I.; Volk, Thomas; Fink, Tobias; Kreuer, Sascha; Maurer, Felix",Molecules,551,20

Given its continued development, limiting the spread of COVID-19 in the population remains a challenging task. Currently, multiple therapies are being tried around the world to deal with SARS-CoV-2 infection, and a variety of studies have shown that natural products have a significant effect on COVID-19 patients. The combination of SARS-CoV-2 S protein with Angiotensin converting enzyme II(ACE2) of host cell to promote membrane fusion is an initial critical step for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, screening natural products that inhibit the binding of SARS-CoV-2 S protein and ACE2 also provides a feasible strategy for the treatment of COVID-19. Establishment of high throughput screening model is an important basis and key technology for screening S protein-ACE2 blockers. Based on this, the molecular structures of SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 and their processes in the life cycle of SARS-CoV-2 and host cell infection were firstly reviewed in this paper, with emphasis on the methods and techniques of screening S protein-ACE2 blockers, including Virtual Screening (VS), Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR), Biochromatography, Biotin-avidin with Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent assay and Gene Chip Technology. Furthermore, the technical principle, advantages and disadvantages and application scope were further elaborated. Combined with the application of the above screening technologies in S protein-ACE2 blockers, a variety of natural products, such as flavonoids, terpenoids, phenols, alkaloids, were summarized, which could be used as S protein-ACE2 blockers, in order to provide ideas for the efficient discovery of S protein-ACE2 blockers from natural sources and contribute to the development of broad-spectrum anti coronavirus drugs.","Ma, Le-le; Liu, Hui-min; Liu, Xue-mei; Yuan, Xiao-yu; Xu, Chao; Wang, Fang; Lin, Jun-zhi; Xu, Run-chun; Zhang, Ding-kun",Eur J Med Chem,551,16

However, consistency between the reported number of COVID-19 deaths and excess all-cause deaths was limited across prefectures, suggesting the necessity of distinguishing the direct and indirect consequences of COVID-19 by cause-specific analysis. To examine whether deaths from road injuries decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan, consistent with a possible reduction of road transport activity connected to Japan’s state of emergency declaration, we estimated the exiguous deaths from road injuries in each week from January to September 2020 by 47 prefectures. METHODS: To estimate the expected weekly number of deaths from road injuries, a quasi-Poisson regression was applied to daily traffic fatalities data obtained from Traffic Accident Research and Data Analysis, Japan. We set two thresholds, point estimate and lower bound of the two-sided 95% prediction interval, for exiguous deaths, and report the range of differences between the observed number of deaths and each of these thresholds as exiguous deaths. RESULTS: Since January 2020, in a few weeks the observed deaths from road injuries fell below the 95% lower bound, such as April 6–12 (exiguous deaths 5–21, percent deficit 2.82–38.14), May 4–10 (8–23, 21.05–43.01), July 20–26 (12–29, 30.77–51.53), and August 3–9 (3–20, 7.32–34.41). However, those less than the 95% lower bound were also observed in weeks in the previous years. CONCLUSIONS: The number of road traffic fatalities during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan has decreased slightly, but not significantly, in several weeks compared with the average year. This suggests that the relatively small changes in excess all-cause mortality observed in Japan during the COVID-19 pandemic could not be explained simply by an offsetting reduction in traffic deaths. Considering a variety of other indirect effects, evaluating an independent, unbiased measure of COVID-19-related mortality burden could provide insight into the design of future broad-based infectious disease counter-measures and offer lessons to other countries.

METHODS: Studies were identified through searches of Medline, EMBASE, PsychINFO, and CINAHL databases using a structured search strategy. The inclusion criteria (1) examined the feasibility, acceptability, and/or efficacy of an online intervention aiming to provide supportive care for people living with and beyond lung cancer; (2) delivered an intervention in a single arm or RCT study pre/post design; (3) if a mixed sample, presented independent lung cancer data. RESULTS: Eight studies were included; two randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Included studies reported on the following outcomes: feasibility and acceptability of an online, supportive care intervention, and/or changes in quality of life, emotional functioning, physical functioning, and/or symptom distress. CONCLUSION: Preliminary evidence suggests that online supportive care among individuals LWBLC is feasible and acceptable, although there is little high-level evidence. Most were small pilot and feasibility studies, suggesting that online supportive care in this group is in its infancy. The integration of online supportive care into the cancer pathway may improve quality of life, physical and emotional functioning, and reduce symptom distress.

However, the spread of COVID-19 has differed in the African setting compared to countries on other continents. To predict the spread of COVID-19 in Africa and within each country on the continent, we applied a Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered mathematical model. Here, our results show that, overall, Africa is currently (May 29, 2020) at the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, after which we predict the number of cases would begin to fall in June 2020. Furthermore, we predict that the ending phase of the pandemic would be in Mid-August 2020 and that decreasing cases of COVID-19 infections would be detected until around December 2020 and January 2021. Our results also reveal that of the 51 countries with reported COVID-19 cases, only nine, including South Africa, Egypt and Ethiopia, are likely to report higher monthly COVID-19 cases in June 2020 than those reported in the previous months. Overall, at the end of this pandemic, we predict that approximately 279,000 (about 154,000 future cases) individuals in Africa would have been infected with the COVID-19 virus. Here, our predictions are data-driven and based on the previously observed trends in the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Shifts in the population dynamics and/or changes in the infectiousness of the COVID-19 virus may require new forecasts of the disease spread.","Sinkala, M.; Nkhoma, P.; Zulu, M.; Kafita, D.; Tembo, R.; Daka, V.",,551,21

The mean body mass index (BMI) of males was relatively higher compared to females (p < 0.001). The proportion of male patients with coronary heart disease (CHD), nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), history of smoking and drinking was higher than females. Male patients developed more clinical symptoms, obtained more abnormal laboratory test results, while they were less aware of care‐seeking than female patients.

A good understanding of the current status and issues of indoor environmental quality (IEQ) in naturally ventilated urban buildings and the association with urban microclimate is fundamental for improving their IEQ. This paper reviews past studies on (a) the microclimate in urban street canyons, (b) the potential influence of such microclimate on IEQ of nearby naturally ventilated buildings, and (c) the real-life IEQ status in these buildings. The review focuses mainly on studies conducted by on-site measurements. The microclimate in urban street canyons is characterized by low wind speed, high surface temperature difference, high pollutant concentration, and high noise level. Insufficient ventilation rates and excessive penetration of outdoor pollutants are two key risks involved in naturally ventilated urban buildings. Existing knowledge suggests that reasonable urban planning and careful building envelope design are the primary methods to ensure acceptable IEQ and maximize the utilization of natural ventilation. However, quantitative studies of both microclimate in street canyons and IEQ in buildings are still highly insufficient in many aspects, which make cross comparison and influencing factors analysis currently impossible. Based on the limitations of previous studies and the current issues of naturally ventilated urban buildings, suggestions are made for future studies to better understand and improve IEQ in naturally ventilated urban buildings.","Ai, Z.T.; Mak, C.M.",Build Environ,551,2

Few interventions, however, have been developed specifically for this age group. OBJECTIVE: In this randomized trial, we will provide a mobile app (SweetGoals) to all participants as a “core” intervention. The app prompts participants to upload data from their diabetes devices weekly to a device-agnostic uploader (Glooko), automatically retrieves uploaded data, assesses daily and weekly self-management goals, and generates feedback messages about goal attainment. Further, the trial will test two unique intervention components: (1) incentives to promote consistent daily adherence to goals, and (2) web health coaching to teach effective problem solving focused on personalized barriers to self-management. We will use a novel digital direct-to-patient recruitment method and intervention delivery model that transcends the clinic. METHODS: A 2x2 factorial randomized trial will be conducted with 300 young adults ages 19-25 with type 1 diabetes and (Hb)A(1c) ≥ 8.0%. All participants will receive the SweetGoals app that tracks and provides feedback about two adherence targets: (a) daily glucose monitoring; and (b) mealtime behaviors. Participants will be randomized to the factorial combination of incentives and health coaching. The intervention will last 6 months. The primary outcome will be reduction in A(1c). Secondary outcomes include self-regulation mechanisms in longitudinal mediation models and engagement metrics as a predictor of outcomes. Participants will complete 6- and 12-month follow-up assessments. We hypothesize greater sustained A(1c) improvements in participants who receive coaching and who receive incentives compared to those who do not receive those components. RESULTS: Data collection is expected to be complete by February 2025. Analyses of primary and secondary outcomes are expected by December 2025. CONCLUSIONS: Successful completion of these aims will support dissemination and effectiveness studies of this intervention that seeks to improve glycemic control in this high-risk and understudied population of young adults with T1D.

Main Outcome Measures: Willingness to work through difficult scenarios created by an influenza epidemic. RESULTS: The corrected response rate was 22%. The most physicians who responded were willing to continue working through some scenarios caused by a pandemic, but in other circumstances less than 50% would continue. Men were more willing to continue working than women. In some situations South African and British trained physicians were more willing to continue working than other groups. CONCLUSIONS: Although many physicians intend to maintain their practices in the event of a pandemic, in some circumstances fewer are willing to work.
