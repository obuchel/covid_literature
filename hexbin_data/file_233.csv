764,764,764,Isothermal Amplification Using a Chemical Heating Device for Point-of-Care Detection of HIV-1,11.333534,9.377323,2012-02-23,"BACKGROUND: To date, the use of traditional nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) for detection of HIV-1 DNA or RNA has been restricted to laboratory settings due to time, equipment, and technical expertise requirements. The availability of a rapid NAAT with applicability for resource-limited or point-of-care (POC) settings would fill a great need in HIV diagnostics, allowing for timely diagnosis or confirmation of infection status, as well as facilitating the diagnosis of acute infection, screening and evaluation of infants born to HIV-infected mothers. Isothermal amplification methods, such as reverse-transcription, loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP), exhibit characteristics that are ideal for POC settings, since they are typically quicker, easier to perform, and allow for integration into low-tech, portable heating devices. METHODOLOGY/SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS: In this study, we evaluated the HIV-1 RT-LAMP assay using portable, non-instrumented nucleic acid amplification (NINA) heating devices that generate heat from the exothermic reaction of calcium oxide and water. The NINA heating devices exhibited stable temperatures throughout the amplification reaction and consistent amplification results between three separate devices and a thermalcycler. The performance of the NINA heaters was validated using whole blood specimens from HIV-1 infected patients. CONCLUSION: The RT-LAMP isothermal amplification method used in conjunction with a chemical heating device provides a portable, rapid and robust NAAT platform that has the potential to facilitate HIV-1 testing in resource-limited settings and POC.","Curtis, Kelly A.; Rudolph, Donna L.; Nejad, Irene; Singleton, Jered; Beddoe, Andy; Weigl, Bernhard; LaBarre, Paul; Owen, S.

893,893,893,Evaluation of Four Different Systems for Extraction of RNA from Stool Suspensions Using MS-2 Coliphage as an Exogenous Control for RT-PCR Inhibition,11.178376,9.257036,2012-07-16,"Knowing when, and to what extent co-extracted inhibitors interfere with molecular RNA diagnostic assays is of utmost importance. The QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (A); MagNA Pure LC2.0 Automatic extractor (B); KingFisher (C); and NucliSENS EasyMag (D) RNA extraction systems were evaluated for extraction efficiency and co-purification of inhibitors from stool suspensions. Real-Time Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (rRT-PCR) of MS-2 coliphage spiked into each system’s lysis buffer served as an external control for both. Cycle thresholds (Cts) of the MS2 were determined for RNA extracted from stool suspensions containing unknown (n = 93) or varying amounts of inhibitors (n = 92). Stool suspensions from the latter group were also used to determine whether MS-2 and enterovirus rRT-PCR inhibitions were correlated. Specifically 23 RNA extracts from stool suspensions were spiked with enterovirus RNA after extraction and 13 of these stool suspension were spiked with intact enterovirus before extraction. MS2 rRT-PCR inhibition varied for RNAs extracted by the different systems. Inhibition was noted in 12 (13.0%), 26 (28.3%), 7 (7.6%), and 7 (7.6%) of the first 93 RNA extracts, and 58 (63.0%), 55 (59.8%), 37 (40.2%) and 30 (32.6%) of the second 92 extracts for A, B, C, and D, respectively. Furthermore, enterovirus rRT-PCR inhibition correlated with MS2 rRT-PCR inhibition for added enterovirus RNA or virus particles. In conclusion, rRT-PCR for MS-2 RNA is a good predictor of inhibition of enterovirus RNA extracted from stool suspensions. EasyMag performed the best, however all four extraction methods were suitable provided that external controls identified problematic samples.","Shulman, Lester M.; Hindiyeh, Musa; Muhsen, Khitam; Cohen, Dani; Mendelson, Ella; Sofer, Danit",PLoS One,233,1
1118,1118,1118,The Development and Application of the Two Real-Time RT-PCR Assays to Detect the Pathogen of HFMD,11.348378,9.135199,2013-04-18,"Large-scale Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease (HFMD) outbreaks have frequently occurred in China since 2008, affecting more than one million children and causing several hundred children deaths every year. The pathogens of HFMD are mainly human enteroviruses (HEVs). Among them, human enterovirus 71 (HEV71) and coxsackievirus A16 (CVA16) are the most common pathogens of HFMD. However, other HEVs could also cause HFMD. To rapidly detect HEV71 and CVA16, and ensure detection of all HEVs causing HFMD, two real-time hybridization probe-based RT-PCR assays were developed in this study. One is a multiplex real-time RT-PCR assay, which was developed to detect and differentiate HEV71 specifically from CVA16 directly from clinical specimens within 1–2 h, and the other is a broad-spectrum real-time RT-PCR assay, which targeted almost all HEVs. The experiments confirmed that the two assays have high sensitivity and specificity, and the sensitivity was up to 0.1 TCID(50)/ml for detection of HEVs, HEV71, and CVA16, respectively. A total of 213 clinical specimens were simultaneously detected by three kinds of assays, including the two real-time RT-PCR assays, direct conventional RT-PCR assay, and virus isolation assay on human rhabdomyosarcoma cells (RD cells). The total positive rate of both HEV71 and CVA16 was 69.48% with real-time RT-PCR assay, 47.42% with RT-PCR assay, and 34.58% with virus isolation assay. One HFMD clinical specimen was positive for HEV, but negative for HEV71 or CVA16, which was identified as Echovirus 11 (Echo11) by virus isolation, RT-PCR, and sequencing for the VP1 gene. The two real-time RT-PCR assays had been applied in 31 provincial HFMD labs to detect the pathogens of HFMD, which has contributed to the rapid identification of the pathogens in the early stages of HFMD outbreaks, and helped to clarify the etiologic agents of HFMD in China.","Cui, Aili; Xu, Changping; Tan, Xiaojuan; Zhang, Yan; Zhu, Zhen; Mao, Naiying; Lu, Yiyu; Xu, Wenbo",PLoS One,233,1
1550,1550,1550,Simultaneous Detection and Differentiation of Highly Virulent and Classical Chinese-Type Isolation of PRRSV by Real-Time RT-PCR,11.114816,9.075889,2014-06-12,"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is a leading disease in pig industry worldwide and can result in serious economic losses each year. The PRRS epidemic situation in China has been very complicated since the unprecedented large-scale highly pathogenic PRRS (HP-PRRS) outbreaks in 2006. And now the HP-PRRS virus (HP-PRRSV) and classical North American type PRRSV strains have coexisted in China. Rapid differential detection of the two strains of PRRSV is very important for effective PRRS control. The real-time RT-PCR for simultaneous detection and differentiation of HP-PRRSV and PRRSV by using both SYBR Green and TaqMan probes was developed and validated. Both assays can be used for rapid detection and strain-specific identification of HP-PRRSV and PRRSV. However, the TaqMan probe method had the highest detection rate whereas the conventional RT-PCR was the lowest. The real-time RT-PCR developed based on SYBR Green and TaqMan probe could be used for simultaneous detection and differentiation of HP-PRRSV and PRRSV in China, which will benefit much the PRRS control and research.","Xiao, Shuqi; Chen, Yaosheng; Wang, Liangliang; Gao, Jintao; Mo, Delin; He, Zuyong; Liu, Xiaohong",J Immunol Res,233,1

We compared laboratory developed real-time PCR assays for detection of Mycoplasma hominis and for detection and differentiation of Ureaplasma urealyticum and parvum to culture using genitourinary specimens submitted for M. hominis and Ureaplasma culture. Methods. 283 genitourinary specimens received in the clinical bacteriology laboratory for M. hominis and Ureaplasma species culture were evaluated. Nucleic acids were extracted using the Total Nucleic Acid Kit on the MagNA Pure 2.0. 5 μL of the extracts were combined with 15 μL of each of the two master mixes. Assays were performed on the LightCycler 480 II system. Culture was performed using routine methods. Results. M. hominis PCR detected 38/42 M. hominis culture-positive specimens, as well as 2 that were culture negative (sensitivity, 90.5%; specificity, 99.2%). Ureaplasma PCR detected 139/144 Ureaplasma culture-positive specimens, as well as 9 that were culture negative (sensitivity, 96.5%; specificity, 93.6%). Of the specimens that tested positive for Ureaplasma species, U. urealyticum alone was detected in 33, U. parvum alone in 109, and both in 6. Conclusion. The described PCR assays are rapid alternatives to culture for detection of M. hominis and Ureaplasma species, and, unlike culture, the Ureaplasma assay easily distinguishes U. urealyticum from parvum.","Cunningham, Scott A.; Mandrekar, Jayawant N.; Rosenblatt, Jon E.; Patel, Robin",Int J Bacteriol,233,1

We provide some examples in which rodents have been suboptimal as models for human biology and discuss confounders which influence experiments and may explain some of the misleading results. Infections of rodents with protozoan parasites are no exception in requiring close consideration upon model choice. We focus on the significant differences between inbred, outbred and wild animals, and the importance of factors such as microbiota, which are gaining attention as crucial variables in infection experiments. Frequently, mouse or rat models are chosen for convenience, e.g., availability in the institution rather than on an unbiased evaluation of whether they provide the answer to a given question. Apart from a general discussion on translational success or failure, we provide examples where infections with single-celled parasites in a chosen lab rodent gave contradictory or misleading results, and when possible discuss the reason for this. We present emerging alternatives to traditional rodent models, such as humanized mice and organoid primary cell cultures. So-called recombinant inbred strains such as the Collaborative Cross collection are also a potential solution for certain challenges. In addition, we emphasize the advantages of using wild rodents for certain immunological, ecological, and/or behavioral questions. The experimental challenges (e.g., availability of species-specific reagents) that come with the use of such non-model systems are also discussed. Our intention is to foster critical judgment of both traditional and newly available translational rodent models for research on parasitic protozoa that can complement the existing mouse and rat models.","Ehret, Totta; Torelli, Francesca; Klotz, Christian; Pedersen, Amy B.; Seeber, Frank",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,233,8

Non-human primates (NHP) remain the gold standard for modeling filovirus disease, but they are not conducive to screening large numbers of experimental compounds and should only be used to test the most promising candidates. Therefore, other smaller animal models are a valuable asset. We have recently developed a guinea-pig adapted SUDV virus that is lethal in guinea pigs. In our current study, we show that ferrets are susceptible to wild-type SUDV, providing a small animal model to directly study clinical isolates, screen experimental anti-SUDV compounds and potentially study viral transmission.","Kroeker, Andrea; He, Shihua; de La Vega, Marc-Antoine; Wong, Gary; Embury-Hyatt, Carissa; Qiu, Xiangguo",Oncotarget,233,1

In the study, Bid genes from grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idellus) and rare minnow (Gobiocypris rarus), named CiBid and GrBid, were cloned and analyzed. Bid was constitutively expressed in all examined tissues of grass carp, but the expression level varied in different tissues. Following grass carp reovirus (GCRV) stimulation in vivo, Bid and apoptosis related genes Caspase-9 and Caspase-3 was up-regulated significantly at the late stage of infection. Moreover, we generated a Bid-deficient rare minnow (Bid(-/-)) to investigate the possible role of Bid in GCRV-triggered apoptosis. We found that the survival time of Bid(-/-) rare minnow after GCRV infection was extended when compared with wild-type fish, the relative copy number of GCRV in Bid(-/-) rare minnow was lower than that in wild-type fish, and the expression level of Caspase-9 and Caspase-3 in Bid(-/-) rare minnow were significantly lower than that in the wild-type fish. Collectively, the current data revealed the important role of Bid during virus-induced apoptosis in teleost fish. Our study would provide new insight into understanding the GCRV induced apoptosis and may provide a target gene for virus-resistant breeding in grass carp.","He, Libo; Wang, Hao; Luo, Lifei; Li, Yongming; Huang, Rong; Liao, Lanjie; Zhu, Zuoyan; Wang, Yaping",Oncotarget,233,1

A data set of 183 active pharmaceutical ingredients was additionally used for the external validation of the best models. The best classification models for antibiotic and antitumor activities were used to screen a data set of marine and microbial natural products from the AntiMarin database—25 and four lead compounds for antibiotic and antitumor drug design were proposed, respectively. The present work enables the presentation of a new set of possible lead like bioactive compounds and corroborates the results of our previous investigations. By other side it is shown the usefulness of quantum-chemical descriptors in the discrimination of biologically active and inactive compounds. None of the compounds suggested by our approach have assigned non-antibiotic and non-antitumor activities in the AntiMarin database and almost all were lately reported as being active in the literature.","Pereira, Florbela; Latino, Diogo A.

CD8(+) T cell immunity largely correlates with enhanced survival, whereas inflammation is associated with poor prognosis. Previous studies have shown polystyrene nanoparticles (PSNPs) are biocompatible, do not induce inflammation and when used as vaccine carriers for model peptides induce CD8(+) T cell responses. Herein we test the immunogenicity of 24 different peptides, from three leading vaccine target proteins in gynecological cancers: the E7 protein of human papilloma virus (HPV); Wilms Tumor antigen 1 (WT1) and survivin (SV), in PSNP conjugate vaccines. Of relevance to vaccine development was the finding that a minimal CD8(+) T cell peptide epitope from HPV was not able to induce HLA-A2.1 specific CD8(+) T cell responses in transgenic humanized mice using conventional adjuvants such as CpG, but was nevertheless able to generate strong immunity when delivered as part of a specific longer peptide conjugated to PSNPs vaccines. Conversely, in most cases, when the minimal CD8(+) T cell epitopes were able to induce immune responses (with WT1 or SV super agonists) in CpG, they also induced responses when conjugated to PSNPs. In this case, extending the sequence around the CD8(+) T cell epitope, using the natural protein context, or engineering linker sequences proposed to enhance antigen processing, had minimal effects in enhancing or changing the cross-reactivity pattern induced by the super agonists. Nanoparticle approaches, such as PSNPs, therefore may offer an alternative vaccination strategy when conventional adjuvants are unable to elicit the desired CD8(+) T cell specificity. The findings herein also offer sequence specific insights into peptide vaccine design for nanoparticle-based vaccine carriers.","Xiang, Sue D.; Wilson, Kirsty L.; Goubier, Anne; Heyerick, Arne; Plebanski, Magdalena",Front Immunol,233,8
3716,3716,3716,An RT-PCR panel for rapid serotyping of dengue virus serotypes 1 to 4 in human serum and mosquito on a field-deployable PCR system,11.523964,8.894042,2019-03-25,"BACKGROUND: Dengue fever, a mosquito-borne disease, is caused by dengue virus (DENV) which includes four major serotypes (DENV-1, -2, -3, and -4). Some serotypes cause more severe diseases than the other; severe dengue is associated with secondary infections by a different serotype. Timely serotyping can provide early warning of dengue epidemics to improve management of patients and outbreaks. A mobile insulated isothermal PCR (iiPCR) system is available to allow molecular detection of pathogens near points of need. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPLE FINDINGS: In this study, side-by-side comparison with the CDC DENV-1-4 Real Time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed to evaluate the performance of four singleplex DENV-1–4 serotyping reverse transcription-iiPCR (RT-iiPCR) reagents for DENV subtyping on the mobile PCR system. The four RT-iiPCRs did not react with Zika virus and chikungunya virus; tests with serial dilutions of the four DENV serotypes made in human serum showed they had detection endpoints comparable to those of the reference method, indicating great analytical sensitivity and specificity. Clinical performance of the RT-iiPCR reagents was evaluated by testing 40 serum samples each (around 20 target serotype-positive and 20 DENV-negative); all four reagents had high agreement (97.5–100%) with the reference qRT-PCR. Moreover, testing of mosquitoes separately infected experimentally with each serotype showed that the four reagents detected specifically their target DENV serotypes in mosquito. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: With analytical and clinical performance comparable to the reference qRT-PCR assay, the four index RT-iiPCR reagents on the field-deployable PCR system can serve as a useful tool for DENV detection near points of needs.","Tsai, Jih-Jin; Liu, Wei-Liang; Lin, Ping-Chang; Huang, Bo-Yi; Tsai, Ching-Yi; Chou, Pin-Hsing; Lee, Fu-Chun; Ping, Chia-Fong; Lee, Pei-Yu Alison; Liu, Li-Teh; Chen, Chun-Hong",PLoS One,233,11

TRPV6 mutations have recently been associated with an antenatally severe under-mineralising skeletal dysplasia accompanied by postnatal biochemical abnormalities. This is the first post-mortem report in a patient with TRPV6 skeletal dysplasia. CASE PRESENTATION: The female infant had severe antenatal and postnatal skeletal abnormalities by 20 weeks gestation and was ventilator-dependent from birth. These skeletal abnormalities were apparent at an earlier gestational age than in previous reported cases and a more severe clinical course ensued. Biochemical and skeletal abnormalities, including bone density, improved postnatally but cardiac arrest at 4 months of age led to withdrawal of intensive care. Compound heterozygous TRPV6 variants (c.1978G > C p.(Gly660Arg) and c.1528C > T p.(Arg510Ter)) were identified on exome sequencing. Post-mortem identified skeletal abnormalities but no specific abnormalities in other organ systems. No placental pathology was found, multi-organ histological features reflected prolonged intensive care only. Post-mortem macroscopic examination indicated reduced thoracic size and short, pale and pliable ribs. Histological examination identified reduced number of trabeculae in the diaphyses (away from the growth plates), whereas metaphyses showed adequate mineralisation and normal number of trabeculae, but with slightly enlarged reactive chondrocytes, indicating post-natal skeletal growth recovery. Post-mortem radiological findings demonstrated improved bone density, improved rib width, healed fractures, although ribs were still shorter than normal. Long bones (especially humerus and femur) had improved from initial poorly defined metaphyses and reduced bone density to sharply defined metaphyses, prominent growth restart lines in distal diaphyses and bone-in-bone appearance along diaphyses. CONCLUSIONS: This case provide bone histological confirmation that human skeletal development is compromised in the presence of TRPV6 pathogenic variants. Post-mortem findings were consistent with abnormal in utero skeletal mineralisation due to severe calcium deficit from compromised placental calcium transfer, followed by subsequent phenotypic improvement with adequate postnatal calcium availability. Significant skeletal recovery occurs in the early weeks of postnatal life in TRPV6 skeletal dysplasia.","Mason, Anna E.; Grier, David; Smithson, Sarah F.; Burren, Christine P.; Gradhand, Elise",BMC Med Genet,233,1

Current evidence strongly supports an immune-mediated basis for myelin breakdown, with an effector role proposed for TMEV-specific, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II-restricted delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) responses in which lymphokine-activated macrophages mediate bystander demyelination. The present study examined the possibility that concomitant or later-appearing neuroantigen-specific autoimmune T cell responses, such as those demonstrated in chronic-relapsing experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (R-EAE), may contribute to the demyelinating process following TMEV infection. T cell responses against intact, purified major myelin proteins (myelin basic protein (MBP) and proteolipid protein (PLP), and against altered myelin constituents were readily demonstrable in SJL/J mice with R-EAE, but were not detectable in SJL/J mice with TMEV-induced demyelinating disease. TMEV-infected mice also did not display T cell responses against the peptide fragments of MBP(91–104) and PLP(139–151) recently shown to be encephalitogenic in SJL/J mice. In addition, induction of neuroantigen-specific tolerance to a heterogeneous mixture of CNS antigens, via the i.v. injection of syngeneic SJL/J splenocytes covalently coupled with mouse spinal cord homogenate, resulted in significant suppression of clinical and histologic signs of R-EAE and the accompanying MBP- and PLP-specific DTH responses. In contrast, neuroantigen-specific tolerance failed to alter the development of clinical and histologic signs of TMEV-induced demyelinating disease or the accompanying virus-specific DTH and humoral immune responses. These findings demonstrate that TMEV-induced demyelinating disease can occur in the apparent absence of neuroantigen-specific autoimmune responses. The relationship of the present results to the immunopathology of multiple sclerosis is discussed.","Miller, Stephen D.; Gerety, Sheila J.; Kennedy, Mary K.; Peterson, Jeffrey D.; Trotter, John L.; Tuohy, Vincent K.; Waltenbaugh, Carl; Dal Canto, Mauro C.; Lipton, Howard L.",J Neuroimmunol,233,8

An unusual feature of the lesions in the CNS was the presence of pyknotic cells within myelin sheaths. A sequence of observations indicated that such cells were lymphocytes which had insinuated themselves into the myelin sheath by passage along the interperiod line. The presence of lymphocytes within myelin sheaths, a process which did not lead to demyelination, was considered to represent a change which reflects the specificity of the immune response in this disease. The detection of this change in other CNS autoimmune diseases, notably those associated with virus infections, may be important as an indicator of pathogenetically relevant lymphocyte-myelin interactions.","Blakemore, W.F.; Summers, B.A.; Sedgwick, J.",J Neuroimmunol,233,33

Which functional traits best distinguish the weed communities of more and less extensively managed fields? Can the same traits predict the rarity of individual weed species? LOCATION: Hungary. METHODS: Using relevé data from 60 cereal and 70 stubble fields, together with weed trait data, we characterized community responses to arable intensification using functional trait analyses based on trait‐convergence and trait‐divergence assembly patterns. We also examined how well the broad‐scale rarity status of species predicts their occurrence along intensification gradients, and how it maps onto our functional classifications describing intensification responses. RESULTS: The response of weeds to intensification in cereal fields was best described by a functional classification based on species' flowering duration, maximum height and seed weight: weeds of extensively managed fields have short flowering seasons (2–5 mo) and particularly large or small seeds. The highest proportions of rare species also happen to be found in these groups. The rarest weeds among these species tend to be late‐winter and early‐summer annuals, while the rare species of stubble fields tend to be broad‐leaved with low nitrogen requirements, small seeds and short height. Stubble fields showed a decline in weed cover with increasing application of fertilizer and distance from the field edge, but we could detect no strong associations of management factors with trait composition, perhaps because the intensification gradient across these fields was shorter. CONCLUSIONS: Many rare Hungarian weeds are associated with traditional extensive farming practices. They are particularly characterized by short, midsummer flowering periods and by preference for low nitrogen levels, but a range of trait syndromes must be considered to understand their ecology and conservation. Analyses based on trait‐divergence patterns, rather than trait‐convergence patterns, provide better insights into the functional composition of weed communities, emphasizing the importance of disruptive filters in weed community assembly and the need for improved methods to detect such effects.","Pinke, Gyula; Gunton, Richard M.",J Veg Sci,233,28

In this paper, the influence of harvest time and cultivar on the chemical and nutritional composition of almonds (Prunus dulcis (Mill). D.A. Webb) were evaluated. Ten cultivars were considered, grown in the same orchard and subjected to the same agronomical regime. Almonds were collected at two different harvest times: (i) when the fruits were unripe, but already edible, and showed green and moist hull; and (ii) when the fruits were ripe, with dry brown hull. The analyses of proximate composition, fatty acid profile, total phenolic compounds, and antioxidant activity were carried out. RESULTS: Lipid content increased (P < 0.001) during ripening, while both protein and carbohydrate content decreased (P < 0.01). Fatty acid composition showed a not univocal behavior during ripening and was highly influenced by cultivar. Total phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity varied among cultivars but increased during ripening with the exception of cv Marcona. The ‘Genco’ and ‘Francolì’ cultivars were found to be phenolic rich. CONCLUSION: Harvest time and cultivar significantly influenced the chemical and nutritional composition of almonds. Genotype strongly influenced fatty acid composition and total phenolic compounds.

Negative-pressure wound therapy can enhance drainage and reduce the empyema cavity, potentially leading to early recovery. This therapy is not currently indicated for bronchopleural fistulas because of the risk of insufficient respiration due to air loss from the fistula. CASE PRESENTATION: A 73-year-old man, who was malnourished because of peritoneal dialysis, was referred to our hospital for the treatment of lung cancer. Right lower lobectomy with mediastinal lymph node dissection was performed via posterolateral thoracotomy, and the bronchial stump was covered with the intercostal muscle flap. His postoperative course was uneventful and he was discharged. However, he was readmitted to our hospital because of respiratory failure and diagnosed as having bronchopleural fistula on the basis of the bronchoscopic finding of a 10-mm hole at the membranous portion of the inlet of the remnant lower lobe bronchus. Thus, thoracotomy debridement and open window thoracostomy were immediately performed. After achieving infection control, bronchial occlusion was performed using fibrin glue and a polyglycolic acid sheet was inserted through a fenestrated wound. Bronchial fistula closure was observed on bronchoscopy; therefore, a negative-pressure wound therapy system was applied to close the fenestrated wound. The collapsed lung was re-expanded and the granulation tissue around the wound increased; therefore, thoracic cavity size decreased and thoracoplasty using the latissimus dorsi was performed. CONCLUSIONS: This bronchopleural fistula was treated successfully after a right lower lobectomy using an extra-pleural bronchial occlusion and negative-pressure wound therapy.","Iwasaki, Masashi; Shimomura, Masanori; Ii, Tsunehiro",Surg Case Rep,233,11

Core fucosylation, which is catalyzed by α1,6-fucosyltransferase (Fut8) in mammals, may play a crucial role in PF development. This study aims to assess the effects of inhibiting core fucosylation of epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor on PF rats. METHODS: PF rats (established by 4.25% glucose dialysate) were treated with either an adenovirus-Fut8 short hairpin RNA (Fut8shRNA) or adenovirus-control. Masson’s staining and net ultrafiltration were performed at week six. Fut8 level and core fucosylation of EGF receptor and collagen I in the peritoneal membrane were assessed, and EGF signaling was detected, including signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and their phosphorylation. Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) in peritoneal effluent was examined. RESULTS: Fut8 was upregulated in PF rats but decreased after Fut8shRNA treatment. EGF and EGF receptor expression was upregulated in PF rats, while core fucosylation of EGF receptor decreased after Fut8shRNA treatment. Masson’s staining results showed an increase in peritoneal thickness in PF rats but a decrease after Fut8shRNA treatment. Fut8shRNA treatment increased net ultrafiltration, reduced the expression of collagen I and MCP-1 compared to PF rats. Fut8shRNA treatment suppressed phosphorylation of STAT3 and NF-κB in the peritoneal membrane of PF rats. CONCLUSIONS: Fut8shRNA treatment ameliorated the fibrotic changes in PF rats. A potential mechanism may be that Fut8shRNA treatment inactivated EGF signaling pathway by suppressing the phosphorylation of STAT3 and NF-κB.","Yu, Changqing; Yang, Ning; Wang, Weidong; Du, Xiangning; Tang, Qingzhu; Lin, Hongli; Li, Longkai",,233,28

Though MS was initially considered to be a white matter demyelinating disease, myelin loss in cortical gray matter has been reported in all disease stages. We previously identified microRNAs (miRNAs) in white matter lesions (WMLs) that are detected in serum from MS patients. However, miRNA expression profiles in gray matter lesions (GMLs) from progressive MS brains are understudied. METHODS: We used a combination of global miRNAs and gene expression profiling of GMLs and independent validation using real‐time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT‐qPCR), immuno‐in situ hybridization, and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Compared to matched myelinated gray matter (GM) regions, we identified 82 miRNAs in GMLs, of which 10 were significantly upregulated and 17 were significantly downregulated. Among these 82 miRNAs, 13 were also detected in serum and importantly were associated with brain atrophy in MS patients. The predicted target mRNAs of these miRNAs belonged to pathways associated with axonal guidance, TGF‐β signaling, and FOXO signaling. Further, using state‐of‐the‐art human protein–protein interactome network analysis, we mapped the four key GM atrophy‐associated miRNAs (hsa‐miR‐149*, hsa‐miR‐20a, hsa‐miR‐29c, and hsa‐miR‐25) to their target mRNAs that were also changed in GMLs. INTERPRETATION: Our study identifies miRNAs altered in GMLs in progressive MS brains that correlate with atrophy measures. As these miRNAs were also detected in sera of MS patients, these could act as markers of GML demyelination in MS.","Tripathi, Ajai; Pandit, Ishani; Perles, Aaron; Zhou, Yadi; Cheng, Feixiong; Dutta, Ranjan",Ann Clin Transl Neurol,233,1

Globally, about 15 million infants are born preterm every year. However, there is a lack of data on the nutritional-related predictors of preterm birth among Ethiopian women. The objective of the study was to identify nutritional-related predictors of preterm birth among women who gave birth at North Shewa public Hospitals in central Ethiopia. METHODS: A case–control study was undertaken in public hospitals in the North Shewa zone, central Ethiopia. Interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to gather data, which was then entered into EPI INFO version 7 and then exported to SPSS version 23 for analysis. Data were presented using texts, tables, and proportions. To find predictors of preterm birth, researcher used binary and multiple logistic regression models. The presence of a relationship between PTB and predictor factors was determined using the adjusted odds ratio (AOR), 95% confidence interval (CI), and p-value <0.05. RESULTS: A total of 161 cases and 322 controls participated in the study making a response rate of 97.6%. Unable to get iron folic acid (IFA) (AOR=2.26, 95% CI: 1.22, 4.18), not eating additional meals (AOR=2.63, 95% CI: 1.1, 4.62), restriction of foods (AOR=2.85, 95% CI: 1.58, 5.12), not taking dark green leafy vegetables (DGLV), (AOR=4.46, 95% CI: 1.72, 11.61), and mid upper arm circumference of mother (MUAC) <23 centimeters (AOR=3.7, 95% CI: 2.25, 6.11) had statistically significant association with premature birth. CONCLUSION: IFA supplementation, additional meals, food taboo, frequency of DGLV, and MUAC were identified predictors of preterm birth. Encouraging such women to eat additional meals, varieties of diets like vegetables, and fruits during pregnancy, and adhering to culturally appropriate nutrition education to reverse food taboo is compulsory.","Deriba, Berhanu Senbeta",Pediatric Health Med Ther,233,8

It is the etiologic agent of bovine tritrichomonosis, a sexually transmitted disease in extensively managed herds throughout many geographic regions worldwide. The same trichomonad species is also regarded as the causative agent of chronic diarrhea in the domestic cat, although more recent studies observed molecular differences between bovine- and feline-derived T. foetus. Trichomonosis in cats has a worldwide distribution and is mainly present among cats from high-density housing environments. Other trichomonads are found as inhabitants of the gastrointestinal tract in birds, such as Trichomonas gallinae. Particularly, Columbiformes, Falconiformes, Strigiformes, and wild Passeriformes can be severely affected by avian trichomonads. Diagnosis of trichomonosis is often complicated by the fragility of the parasite. To ensure valid test results, it is essential to collect and handle specimens in the right way prior to analysis. Cultivation tests, the specific amplification of parasites, or a combination of both test methods is the most efficient and most commonly used way to diagnose trichomonosis in animals. Bovine tritrichomonosis is mainly controlled by the identification and withdrawal of infected animals from bovine herds. The control of feline and avian trichomonosis relies mainly on preventive measures.","Collántes-Fernández, Esther; Fort, Marcelo C.; Ortega-Mora, Luis M.; Schares, Gereon",Parasitic Protozoa of Farm Animals and Pets,233,9

Respiratory viruses, alone or in combination, are the most common cause. The course f illness can be complicated by bacterial agents, causing pharyngitis or sinusitis, but the are a rare cause of cold and flu-like illnesses (CFLIs). Our understanding of CFLI epidemiology has been enhanced by molecular detection methods, particularly polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing. PCR has not only improved detection of previously known viruses, but within the last decade has resulted in the detection of many divergent novel respiratory virus species. Human rhinovirus (HRV) infections cause nearly all CFLIs and they can be responsible for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations. HRVs are co-detected with other respiratory viruses in statistically significant patterns, with HRVs occurring in the lowest proportion of co-detections, compared to most other respiratory viruses. Some recently identified rhinoviruses may populate an entirely new putative HRV species; HRV C. Further work is required to confirm a causal role for these newly identified viruses in CFLIs. The burden of illness associated with CFLIs is poorly documented, but where data are available, the impact of CFLIs is considerable. Individual infections, although they do not commonly result in more severe respiratory tract illness, are associated with substantial direct and indirect resource use. The product of frequency and burden for CFLIs is likely to be greater in magnitude than for any other respiratory syndrome, but further work is required to document this. Our understanding of the viral causes of CLFIs, although incomplete, has improved in recent years. Documenting burden is also an important step in progress towards improved control and management of these illnesses.","Mackay, Ian M.; Arden, Katherine E.; Lambert, Stephen B.",Common Cold,233,28

Nowadays, various environmental public settings worldwide, from hospitals and health care facilities to shopping malls and airports, are considering implementation of UV disinfection devices for disinfection of frequently touched surfaces and circulating air streams. Moreover, the general public utilizes UV sterilization devices for various surfaces, from doorknobs and keypads to personal protective equipment, or air purification devices with an integrated UV disinfection technology. However, limited understanding of critical UV disinfection aspects can lead to improper use of this promising technology.

The translation of the HCV genome depends on an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) located within the 341-nucleotide 5'UTR, while RNA replication requires a smaller region. A question arises whether the replication and translation functions require different regions of the 5'UTR and different sets of RNA-binding proteins. Here, we showed that the 5'-most 157 nucleotides of HCV RNA is the minimum 5'UTR for RNA replication, and it partially overlaps with the IRES. Stem-loops 1 and 2 of the 5'UTR are essential for RNA replication, whereas stem-loop 1 is not required for translation. We also found that poly(C)-binding protein 2 (PCBP2) bound to the replication region of the 5'UTR and associated with detergent-resistant membrane fractions, which are the sites of the HCV replication complex. The knockdown of PCBP2 by short hairpin RNA decreased the amounts of HCV RNA and nonstructural proteins. Antibody-mediated blocking of PCBP2 reduced HCV RNA replication in vitro, indicating that PCBP2 is directly involved in HCV RNA replication. Furthermore, PCBP2 knockdown reduced IRES-dependent translation preferentially from a dual reporter plasmid, suggesting that PCBP2 also regulated IRES activity. These findings indicate that PCBP2 participates in both HCV RNA replication and translation. Moreover, PCBP2 interacts with HCV 5'- and 3'UTR RNA fragments to form an RNA-protein complex and induces the circularization of HCV RNA, as revealed by electron microscopy. This study thus demonstrates the mechanism of the participation of PCBP2 in HCV translation and replication and provides physical evidence for HCV RNA circularization through 5'- and 3'UTR interaction.","Wang, Linya; Jeng, King-Song; Lai, Michael M C",Journal of virology,233,7

The application of molecular biology and immunocytochemistry to the study of cell types involved in renal morphogenesis is leading to a better understanding of nephrogenesis, which requires a fine balance of many factors that can be disturbed by various prenatal events in humans. The aim of this paper is to review human kidney organogenesis, with particular emphasis on the sequence of morphological events, on the immunohistochemical peculiarities of nephron progenitor populations and on the molecular pathways regulating the process of mesenchymal to epithelial transition. Kidney development can be subdivided into five steps: (i) the primary ureteric bud (UB); (ii) the cap mesenchyme; (iii) the mesenchymal-epithelial transition; (iv) glomerulogenesis and tubulogenesis; (v) the interstitial cells. Complex correlations between morphological and molecular events from the origin of the UB and its branching to the metanephric mesenchyme, ending with the maturation of nephrons, have been reported in different animals, including mammals. Marked differences, observed among different species in the origin and the duration of nephrogenesis, suggest that morphological and molecular events may be different in different animal species and mammals. Further studies must be carried out in humans to verify at the morphological, immunohistochemical, and molecular levels if the outcome in humans parallels that previously described in other species.","Faa, Gavino; Gerosa, Clara; Fanni, Daniela; Monga, Giudo; Zaffanello, Marco; Van Eyken, Peter; Fanos, Vassilios",Journal of cellular physiology,233,27

Previously, we found that dynamic matrix compression in vivo potently regulated revascularization during bone tissue regeneration; however, whether matrix deformations directly regulate angiogenesis remained unknown. Here, we demonstrated that load initiation time, magnitude, and mode all regulate microvascular growth, as well as upstream angiogenic and mechanotransduction signaling pathways. Immediate load initiation inhibited angiogenesis and expression of early sprout tip cell selection genes, while delayed loading enhanced microvascular network formation and upstream signaling pathways.

The purpose of this study was to quantify the amount of unintentional energy (electromagnetic interference [EMI]) transferred to an implanted cardiac defibrillator by common surgical energy-based devices. METHODS A transvenous cardiac defibrillator was implanted in an anesthetized pig. The primary outcome measure was the average maximum EMI occurring on the implanted cardiac device during activations of multiple different surgical energy-based devices. RESULTS The EMI transferred to the implanted cardiac device is as follows: traditional bipolar 30 W .01 ± .004 mV, advanced bipolar .004 ± .003 mV, ultrasonic shears .01 ± .004 mV, monopolar Bovie 30 W coagulation .50 ± .20 mV, monopolar Bovie 30 W blend .92 ± .63 mV, monopolar instrument without dispersive electrode .21 ± .07 mV, plasma energy 3.48 ± .78 mV, and argon beam coagulator 2.58 ± .34 mV. CONCLUSION Surgeons can minimize EMI on implanted cardiac defibrillators by preferentially utilizing bipolar and ultrasonic devices.","Paniccia, Alessandro; Rozner, Marc; Jones, Edward L; Townsend, Nicole T; Varosy, Paul D; Dunning, James E; Girard, Guillaume; Weyer, Christopher; Stiegmann, Gregory V; Robinson, Thomas N",American journal of surgery,233,31

METHODS Electronic databases (PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, TRIP, LILACS, and CENTRAL Cochrane) were searched up to Jan 2021. Clinical trials that compared the quality of root canal filling of endodontically treated primary teeth using lentulospiral with other instruments were included. Two reviewers independently selected the studies, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. Two outcomes were considered: inadequate root canal filling (under or overfilling) and presence of voids. Conventional meta-analyses were performed using a fixed-effects model. Statistical analyses were performed using RevMan5.3 at a significance level of 5%. RESULTS Of the 68 potentially relevant studies, eight were selected for full-text analysis, and three were included in the systematic review. The use of syringes resulted in a lower risk of presence of voids in the root canal filling compared to the use of lentulospiral (RR: 0.62 95% CI 0.45; 0.85). However, there was no difference between lentulospiral and bi-directional spiral (RR:1.17 95% CI: 0.90; 1.51). There was no significant difference between lentulospiral and syringes (RR: 1.37 95% CI 1.00; 1.87) considering the length of the root canal filling. The use of bi-directional spiral had a higher risk of inadequate root canal filling compared to the use of lentulospiral (RR: 1.75 95% CI: 1.12; 2.74). Two studies were at ""high"", and one study at ""unclear"" risk of bias in the key domains. CONCLUSIONS There is insufficient scientific evidence showing the superiority of using lentulospiral for the root canal filling in endodontically treated primary teeth. Due to the limited level of evidence, professionals may opt to choose the instrument based on their preferences.","Arduim, Andressa da Silva; Gonçalves, Débora Plotnik; Casagrande, Luciano; Lenzi, Tathiane Larissa",European archives of paediatric dentistry : official journal of the European Academy of Paediatric Dentistry,233,16

This study aims to estimate the prevalence of food insufficiency (often the most extreme form of food insecurity), the correlates of food insufficiency, and the associations between food insufficiency and symptoms of poor mental health in the U.S. during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS Cross-sectional data from 63,674 participants of the U.S. Census Household Pulse Survey were collected and analyzed in 2020. Multiple Poisson regression models were used to estimate associations with food insufficiency. RESULTS Food insufficiency rose from 8.1% to 10.0% from March to June 2020. Factors associated with food insufficiency included lower age, Black/African American or Latinx race/ethnicity, being unmarried, larger household size, recent employment loss, income below the federal poverty line, and lower education (all p<0.001). Food insufficiency was independently associated with all symptoms of poor mental health, adjusting for socioeconomic and demographic factors (adjusted RRs ranged from 1.16 to 1.42, all p<0.001). The association between food insufficiency and poor mental health was attenuated among people who received free groceries or meals. CONCLUSIONS Food insufficiency has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic and affects vulnerable populations, placing individuals at higher risk for symptoms of poor mental health. Particularly in the current crisis, clinicians should regularly screen patients for food insufficiency and mental health outcomes as well as provide support in accessing appropriate resources.","Nagata, Jason M; Ganson, Kyle T; Whittle, Henry J; Chu, Jonathan; Harris, Orlando O; Tsai, Alexander C; Weiser, Sheri D",American journal of preventive medicine,233,1

All data are registered prospectively in cooperation with the Institute for Quality Assurance in Surgical Medicine at the Otto-von-Guericke University Magdeburg, Germany. METHODS Data are registered in an online database. Data collection on obesity and metabolic surgery is voluntary, and was started in 2005. In addition, follow-up data are collected once a year. RESULTS Since 2005, 8,293 sleeve gastrectomies, 10,330 Roux-en-Y gastric bypass procedures, and 3,741 gastric banding procedures have been performed in Germany, according to the data of the GBSR. Mean age and mean body mass index of female patients with gastric banding, sleeve gastrectomy, or Roux-en-Y gastric bypass were significantly lower than those of male patients. The incidence of relevant comorbidities was significantly higher in male than in female patients. CONCLUSION Metabolic and obesity surgery is becoming more and more popular in Germany. Data from the GBSR study show significant differences in preoperative comorbidities and postoperative complication and mortality rates between male and female patients. There is a need for further evaluation of gender-specific aspects to optimize patient selection and reduce specific postoperative complications.","Stroh, Christine; Weiner, Rudolf; Wolff, Stefanie; Knoll, Christian; Manger, Thomas",Viszeralmedizin,233,31

Admittedly, telomeres progressively shorten with age that can also be significantly accelerated by pathological conditions, which are often considered as potential contributors for cellular senescence. It is commonly believed that constant accumulation of senescent cells may lead to dysfunctional tissues and organs, thereby accelerating aging process and subsequent occurrence of age-related diseases. In particular, epidemiological data has indicated a significant association between environmental pollutants exposure and a high incidence of age-related diseases. Moreover, there is growing evidence that environmental toxicity has a detrimental impact on telomere length. Overall, a consensus is emerging that environmental pollutants exposure could lead to accelerated telomere erosion and further induce premature senescence, which may be responsible for the acceleration of aging and the high morbidity and mortality rates of age-related diseases.","Liu, Yaru; Wang, Jiequan; Huang, Zhaogang; Liang, Jun; Xia, Qingrong; Xia, Quan; Liu, Xinhua",Environmental toxicology and pharmacology,233,16

Due to the insidious and complex nature of the disease, the list of symptoms is rapidly expanding. So far, few studies have reported sudden sensorineural hearing loss as a possible symptom of coronavirus disease 2019. CASE REPORT A 60-year-old woman with a complaint of sudden sensorineural hearing loss and subjective severe tinnitus presented to the ENT clinic. Coronavirus disease 2019 was subsequently confirmed with a polymerase chain reaction test. At the time of presentation, she was treated with intra-tympanic dexamethasone. Improvements in hearing threshold and speech perception, and a subjective reduction in tinnitus, were observed after treatment. CONCLUSION This case report supports evidence from other case reports of a possible association between coronavirus disease 2019 and sudden sensorineural hearing loss. Sudden sensorineural hearing loss may be a symptom of this disease that behaves as an underlying aggravating factor. Intra-tympanic injection of corticosteroids is recommended for managing these patients during the pandemic.","Rahimi, V; Asiyabar, M K; Rouhbakhsh, N",The Journal of laryngology and otology,233,16

The objective of this analysis was to determine whether RYGB causes greater improvement in glucostatic parameters as compared with laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) or low calorie diet (LCD) after equivalent weight loss and independent of enteral nutrient passage. Study 1 recruited participants without type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who underwent LAGB (n = 8) or RYGB (n = 9). Study 2 recruited subjects with T2DM who underwent LCD (n = 7) or RYGB (n = 7). Insulin-supplemented frequently-sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test (fsIVGTT) was performed before and after equivalent weight reduction. MINMOD analysis of insulin sensitivity (Si), acute insulin response to glucose (AIRg) and C-peptide (ACPRg) response to glucose, and insulin secretion normalized to the degree of insulin resistance (disposition index (DI)) were analyzed. Weight loss was comparable in all groups (7.8 ± 0.4%). In Study 1, significant improvement of Si, ACPRg, and DI were observed only after LAGB. In Study 2, Si, ACPRg, and plasma adiponectin increased significantly in the RYGB-DM group but not in LCD. DI improved in both T2DM groups, but the absolute increase was greater after RYGB (258.2 ± 86.6 vs. 55.9 ± 19.9; P < 0.05). Antidiabetic medications were discontinued after RYGB contrasting with 55% reduction in the number of medications after LCD. No intervention affected fasting glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1, peptide YY (PYY) or ghrelin levels. In conclusion, RYGB produced greater improvement in Si and DI compared with diet at equivalent weight loss in T2DM subjects. Such a beneficial effect was not observed in nondiabetic subjects at this early time-point.","Plum, Leona; Ahmed, Leaque; Febres, Gerardo; Bessler, Marc; Inabnet, William; Kunreuther, Elizabeth; McMahon, Donald J; Korner, Judith",Obesity,233,1

Twenty-eight Contingency Plans were analyzed in full, one national, 26 at state level, and one from the Federal District. The Public Policy Cycle's theoretical framework was used, specifically governmental pre-decision and decision to face the pandemic. The evidence revealed convergences between the national and state levels concerning proposals for reorienting care flow, detecting cases, and indicating referral hospitals. However, the state agendas revealed weaknesses in acquiring mechanical ventilation devices, sizing human resources, and regionalizing hospital care. Moreover, few states have established a method for calculating back-end beds, mainly regarding the outlook of opening hospitals of reference or contracting additional ICU beds. We can conclude that the heterogeneous actions explained in the plans show the complex process of coping with COVID-19 in Brazil with its regional inequalities, weaknesses in the state health systems, and reduced coordination by the Ministry of Health.","Santos, Thadeu Borges Souza; Andrade, Laise Rezende de; Vieira, Silvana Lima; Duarte, Joseane Aparecida; Martins, Juliete Sales; Rosado, Lilian Barbosa; Oliveira, Juliana Dos Santos; Pinto, Isabela Cardoso de Matos",Ciencia & saude coletiva,233,1

Additionally, solid bolus swallows, solid test meal, and/or pharmacologic provocation can be used to identify clinically relevant motility disorders and other conditions (eg, rumination) that occur during and after meals. The acquisition and analysis for performing these tests and the evidence supporting their inclusion in the Chicago Classification protocol is detailed in this technical review. Provocative tests are designed to increase the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of HRM studies for disorders of esophageal motility.

The incidence of tracheal complications in ventilated patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is unknown. Objective To evaluate whether patients with COVID-19 have a higher incidence of full-thickness tracheal lesions and tracheoesophageal fistulas than matched controls and to investigate potential mechanisms. Design, Setting, and Participants This is a retrospective cohort study in patients admitted to the intensive care unit in a tertiary referral hospital. Among 98 consecutive patients with COVID-19 with severe respiratory failure, 30 underwent prolonged (≥14 days) invasive mechanical ventilation and were included in the COVID-19 group. The control group included 45 patients without COVID-19. Patients with COVID-19 were selected from March 1 to May 31, 2020, while the control group was selected from March 1 to May 31, 2019. Exposures Patients with COVID-19 had severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection diagnosed by nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabs and were treated according to local therapeutic procedures. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary study outcome was the incidence of full-thickness tracheal lesions or tracheoesophageal fistulas in patients with prolonged invasive mechanical ventilation. Results The mean (SD) age was 68.8 (9.0) years in the COVID-19 group and 68.5 (14.1) years in the control group (effect size, 0.3; 95% CI, -5.0 to 5.6). Eight (27%) and 15 (33%) women were enrolled in the COVID-19 group and the control group, respectively. Fourteen patients (47%) in the COVID-19 group had full-thickness tracheal lesions (n = 10, 33%) or tracheoesophageal fistulas (n = 4, 13%), while 1 patient (2.2%) in the control group had a full-thickness tracheal lesion (odds ratio, 38.4; 95% CI, 4.7 to 316.9). Clinical and radiological presentations of tracheal lesions were pneumomediastinum (n = 10, 71%), pneumothorax (n = 6, 43%), and/or subcutaneous emphysema (n = 13, 93%). Conclusions and Relevance In this cohort study, almost half of patients with COVID-19 developed full-thickness tracheal lesions and/or tracheoesophageal fistulas after prolonged invasive mechanical ventilation.

In several studies, solid-organ transplant recipients were reported to have higher risk for COVID-19. Here, we aimed to determine the frequency of COVID-19 in our kidney and liver transplant patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS Our study included 583 transplant patients who were admitted to our outpatient transplant clinics and emergency departments between March 1 and May 1, 2020. Seventy-four of them were liver transplant recipients (46 male, 28 female, of which 14 were pediatric and 60 were adult patients) and 509 of them were kidney transplant recipients (347 male, 162 female, of which 16 were pediatric and 493 were adult patients). We retrospectively evaluated demographic characteristics, currently used immunosuppressant treatment, present complaints, treatment and diagnosis of comorbid diseases, and results of COVID-19 tests. RESULTS Of 583 transplant recipients, 538 were seen in our outpatient transplant clinics and 45 were seen in our emergency departments. Of these, 18 patients who had had cough and fever were evaluated by respiratory clinic doctors, and nasopharyngeal swab samples were taken. One kidney transplant recipient had a positive COVID-19 test; he was followed with home isolation. He received treatment with hydroxychloroquine (400 mg/day). The other 17 patients had negative tests. There were no mortalities due to COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS Transplant patients also got affected during the COVID-19 pandemic. According to the data of our centers, this effect is not much more different from the normal population. We recommend that transplant recipients should be warned in terms of personal hygiene and should be closely monitored by organ transplant centers. If there is an indication for hospitalization, they should be followed in an isolated unit, with no aggressive changes made to immunosuppressive doses unless necessary.","Akdur, Aydincan; Karakaya, Emre; Ayvazoglu Soy, Ebru H; Alshalabi, Omar; Kirnap, Mahir; Arslan, Hande; Ulubay, Gaye; Hekimoglu, Koray; Moray, Gokhan; Haberal, Mehmet",Experimental and clinical transplantation : official journal of the Middle East Society for Organ Transplantation,233,6

We identified 114 patients for inclusion in the study. Of these, 43 with osteonecrosis received a significantly higher cumulative and peak methylprednisolone-equivalent dose than 71 patients with no osteonecrosis identified by MRI. We confirmed that the number of osteonecrotic lesions was directly related to the dosage of steroids and that a very high dose, a peak dose of more than 200 mg or a cumulative methylprednisolone-equivalent dose of more than 4000 mg, is a significant risk factor for multifocal osteonecrosis with both epiphyseal and diaphyseal lesions. Patients with diaphyseal osteonecrosis received a significantly higher cumulative methylprednisolone-equivalent dose than those with epiphyseal osteonecrosis.

Colonization has affected indigenous peoples' levels of trust with institutions, and their world view tends to be distinct from that of nonindigenous people. Building on a programme theory for SDM, the present research aims to refine the original programme theory to understand how the mechanisms of trust and world view might work differently for indigenous patients. DESIGN We used a six-step iterative process for realist synthesis: preliminary programme theory development, search strategy development, selection and appraisal of literature, data extraction, data analysis and synthesis, and formation of a revised programme theory. DATA SOURCES Searches were through Medline, CINAHL, and the University of Saskatchewan iPortal for grey literature. Medline and CINAHL searches included the University of Alberta Canada-wide indigenous peoples search filters. DATA SYNTHESIS Following screening 731 references, 90 documents were included for data extraction (53 peer reviewed and 37 grey literature). Documents from countries with similar colonization experiences were included. RESULTS A total of 518 context-mechanism-outcome (CMO) configurations were identified and synthesized into 21 CMOs for a revised programme theory. Demographics, indigenous world view, system and institutional support, language barriers, and the macro-context of discrimination and historical abuse provided the main contexts for the programme theory. These inspired mechanisms of reciprocal respect, perception of world view acceptance, and culturally appropriate knowledge translation. In turn, these mechanisms influenced the level of trust and anxiety experienced by indigenous patients. Trust and anxiety were both mechanisms and intermediate outcomes and determined the level of engagement in SDM. CONCLUSION This realist synthesis provides clinicians and policymakers a deeper understanding of the complex configurations that influence indigenous patient engagement in SDM and offers possible avenues for improvement.","Groot, Gary; Waldron, Tamara; Barreno, Leonzo; Cochran, David; Carr, Tracey",Journal of evaluation in clinical practice,233,14

Measurement of the volume and chemical properties of sweat via dielectric detection and colorimetry demonstrates some capabilities. Here, inductively coupled sensors consisting of LC resonators with capacitive electrodes show systematic responses to sweat collected in microporous substrates. Interrogation occurs through external coils placed in physical proximity to the devices. The substrates allow spontaneous sweat collection through capillary forces, without the need for complex microfluidic handling systems. Furthermore, colorimetric measurement modes are possible in the same system by introducing indicator compounds into the depths of the substrates, for sensing specific components (OH(-) , H(+) , Cu(+) , and Fe(2+) ) in the sweat. The complete devices offer Young's moduli that are similar to skin, thus allowing highly effective and reliable skin integration without external fixtures. Experimental results demonstrate volumetric measurement of sweat with an accuracy of 0.06 μL/mm(2) with good stability and low drift. Colorimetric responses to pH and concentrations of various ions provide capabilities relevant to analysis of sweat.

The influence of these stretch-induced changes on muscle function at submaximal forces is unknown. To address this gap in knowledge, we estimated the changes in neural drive to the plantar flexor muscles after a static-stretch intervention. Neural drive to the plantar flexor muscles during a low-force contraction increased after repeated static stretches. These findings suggest that adjustments in motor unit activity are necessary at low forces to accommodate reductions in the force-generating and transmission capabilities of the muscle-tendon unit after repeated static stretches of the calf muscles. ABSTRACT Static stretching decreases stiffness about a joint, but its influence on muscle-tendon unit function and muscle activation is unclear. We investigated the influence of three static stretches on changes in neural drive to the plantar-flexor muscles, both after a stretch intervention and after a set of maximal voluntary contractions (MVCs). Estimates of neural drive were obtained during submaximal isometric contractions by decomposing high-density electromyographic signals into the activity of individual motor units from medial gastrocnemius, lateral gastrocnemius, and soleus. Motor units were matched across contractions and an estimate of neural drive to the plantar flexors was calculated by normalizing the cumulative spike train to the number of active motor units (normalized neural drive). Mean discharge rate increased after the stretch intervention during the 10% MVC task for all recorded motor units and those matched across conditions (all, p = 0.0046; matched only, p = 0.002), recruitment threshold decreased for motor units matched across contractions (p = 0.022), and discharge rate at recruitment was elevated (p = 0.004). Similarly, the estimate of normalized neural drive was significantly greater after the stretch intervention at 10% MVC torque (p = 0.029), but not at 35% MVC torque. The adjustments in motor unit activity required to complete the 10% MVC task after stretch may have been partially attenuated by a set of plantar-flexor MVCs. The increase in neural drive required to produce low plantar-flexion torques after repeated static stretches of the calf muscles suggests stretch-induced changes in muscle- and connective-tissue properties.

Current T1 cancer treatment does not differ according to anatomic location. We therefore compared the disease-free survival of T1 cancer arising from rectum versus colon. METHODS The hospital-based study included subjects with T1 cancer at National Taiwan University Hospital from 2005 to 2014. Clinical, colonoscopy, and histopathology were reviewed for patients with a mean follow-up time of 7.1 (0.7-12.9) years. We conducted Kaplan-Meier analysis to compare the risk of recurrence by cancer location and Cox-regression analysis to identify risk factors for T1 cancer recurrence. RESULTS The final cohort included a total of 343 subjects with T1 cancer (mean age, 64.9 ± 11.7 years; 56.1% males), of whom 25 underwent endoscopic resection alone. Of the subjects who underwent surgery, 50 had lymph node metastasis and 268 did not. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the risk of recurrence was higher in T1 rectal cancer than T1 colon cancer (p =0.022). Rectal location, and larger neoplasm size were independent risk factors for recurrence, with hazard ratios (95% confidence interval) of 4.84 (1.18-19.92), and 1.32 (1.06-1.65), respectively. The occurrence of advanced histology did not differ between T1 rectal and colon cancers (p = 0.58). CONCLUSION T1 cancers arising from the rectum had less favorable recurrence outcomes than those arising from the colon. Further studies are needed to examine whether adjuvant radiotherapy or chemotherapy can reduce the risk of recurrence in T1 rectal cancer. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE Current T1 colorectal cancer treatment and surveillance do not differ according to anatomic location. Clinical, colonoscopy, and histopathology were reviewed for 343 T1 cancer patients with a mean follow-up time of 7.1 years. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the risk of recurrence was higher in T1 rectal cancer than T1 colon cancer. Moreover, the rectal location was an independent risk factor for recurrence. T1 cancers from the rectum had less favorable recurrence outcomes than those arising from the colon. It is critical to clarify whether adjuvant therapy or more close surveillance can reduce recurrence risk in T1 rectal cancer.","Chang, Li-Chun; Shun, Chia-Tung; Lin, Been-Ren; Sanduleanu, Silvia; Hsu, Weng-Feng; Wu, Ming-Shiang; Chiu, Han-Mo",The oncologist,233,22

The objective of this case series is to describe early neonatal outcomes and inpatient management in U.S. hospitals. STUDY DESIGN We solicited cases of mother-infant dyads affected by novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from the Better Outcomes through Research for Newborns (BORN) Network members. Using a structured case template, participating sites contributed deidentified, retrospective birth hospitalization data for neonates ≥35 weeks of gestation at birth with mothers who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 before delivery. We describe demographic and clinical characteristics, clinical management, and neonatal outcomes. RESULTS Sixteen U.S. hospitals contributed 70 cases. Birth hospitalizations were uncomplicated for 66 (94%) neonates in which 4 (6%) required admission to a neonatal intensive care unit. None required evaluation or treatment for infection, and all who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 were negative (n = 57). Half of the dyads were colocated (n = 34) and 40% directly breastfed (n = 28). Outpatient follow-up data were available for 13 neonates, all of whom remained asymptomatic. CONCLUSION In this multisite case series of 70 neonates born to women with SARS-CoV-2 infection, clinical outcomes were overall good, and there were no documented neonatal SARS-CoV-2 infections. Clinical management was largely inconsistent with contemporaneous U.S. COVID-19 guidelines for nursery care, suggesting concerns about the acceptability and feasibility of those recommendations. Longitudinal studies are urgently needed to assess the benefits and harms of current practices to inform evidence-based clinical care and aid shared decision-making. KEY POINTS · Birth hospitalizations were uncomplicated for late preterm and term infants with maternal COVID-19.. · Nursery management of dyads affected by COVID-19 varied between hospitals.. · Adherence to contemporaneous U.S. clinical guidelines for nursery care was low.. · Breastfeeding rates were lower for dyads roomed separately than those who were colocated..","Congdon, Jayme L; Kair, Laura R; Flaherman, Valerie J; Wood, Kelly E; LoFrumento, Mary Ann; Nwaobasi-Iwuh, Eberechi; Phillipi, Carrie A",American journal of perinatology,233,6

The present study of covert naming in Chinese is distinctive in testing the ERP effects of regularity and consistency in a fully orthogonal design. We found that consistency, but not regularity, affected the N170, P200 and N400 as well as pronunciation transcription accuracies, demonstrating a more prominent role of consistency than regularity in character naming, consistent with conclusions from English word naming.

This study delineates the diversity of clinical presentations based on different serotypes and different groups [human enterovirus (HEV)-A and HEV-B] of enteroviruses (EVs) during the 2008 epidemic in National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH). METHODS We retrospectively identified patients younger than 18 years who had positive isolates of non-polio EV in throat swabs, rectal swabs, or cerebrospinal fluid, in NTUH from January 1 to December 31, 2008. For serotyping, immunofluorescence assay and polymerase chain reaction followed by viral structure protein-1 sequencing were applied. We analyzed and compared their clinical features among different serotypes and different groups of EVs. RESULTS Among 172 patients who were enrolled, 16 serotypes were identified. The major serotype in NTUH was EV71 (25.6%) followed by coxsackievirus A (CA)16 and coxsackievirus B (CB)4. EV71 manifested mostly as HFMD (89%) and was complicated with encephalomyelitis in three patients. Serotypes of HFMD included EV71 (70%), CA16 (27%), CA4, and CA6. Serotypes of herpangina were heterogeneous, and the major serotype was CA2 (35.7%) followed by CB4 (23.8%). Aseptic meningitis was entirely caused by HEV-B and mostly infected by echovirus 30 (50%). Among children with EV-related respiratory tract infection, CB4 (32%) was dominant in upper respiratory tract infection, whereas echovirus 4 (71%) was the major cause of lower respiratory tract infection. Cases of HEV-A were significantly younger than the cases of HEV-B (p = 0.04). Multivariate analysis revealed that the most significant factor associated with hospitalization is HEV-B (odds ratio, 2.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-4.2; p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS At least 16 serotypes circulated in northern Taiwan in 2008. EV71 is the predominant strain in this outbreak. All patients with HFMD were infected by HEV-A, but HEV-B was associated with a higher rate of hospitalization and aseptic meningitis, which should be a cause of alert regarding public health.","Hsu, Chien-Hui; Lu, Chun-Yi; Shao, Pei-Lan; Lee, Ping-Ing; Kao, Chuan-Liang; Chung, Ming-Yi; Chang, Luan-Yin; Huang, Li-Min","Journal of microbiology, immunology, and infection = Wei mian yu gan ran za zhi",233,29

METHODS Retrospective before-after study using multiple electronic health record data sources. Natural language processing algorithms were developed to rapidly extract indication, Glasgow Coma Scale, and CT outcome from clinical records, creating two datasets: one based on all head injury CTs from 1997 to 2009 (n = 9109), for which diagnostic yield of intracranial traumatic findings was calculated. The second dataset (2009-2014) used both CT reports and clinical notes from the emergency department, enabling selection of minor head injury patients (n = 4554) and calculation of both CT utilization and diagnostic yield. Additionally, we tested for significant changes in utilization and yield after guideline implementation in 2011, using chi-square statistics and logistic regression. RESULTS The yield was initially nearly 60%, but in a decreasing trend dropped below 20% when CT became routinely used for head trauma. Between 2009 and 2014, of 4554 minor head injury patients overall, 85.4% underwent head CT. After guideline implementation in 2011, CT utilization significantly increased from 81.6 to 87.6% (p = 7 × 10-7), while yield significantly decreased from 12.2 to 9.6% (p = 0.029). CONCLUSIONS The number of CTs performed for head trauma gradually increased over two decades, while the yield decreased. In 2011, despite implementation of a guideline aiming to improve selective use of CT in minor head injury, utilization significantly increased. KEY POINTS • Over two decades, the number of head CTs performed for minor, moderate, and severe head injury gradually increased, while the diagnostic yield for intracranial findings showed a decreasing trend. • Despite the implementation of a guideline in 2011, aiming to improve selective use of CT in minor head injury, utilization significantly increased, while diagnostic yield significantly decreased. • Natural language processing is a valuable tool to monitor the utilization and diagnostic yield of imaging as a potential quality-of-care indicator.","Pons, Ewoud; Foks, Kelly A; Dippel, Diederik W J; Hunink, M G Myriam",European radiology,233,24

The fixation, however, is also thought to be a source of chronic postoperative pain. We tested the new self-fixating mesh Parietene progrip vs. traditional suture fixating Lichtenstein repair in a double-blinded randomized study evaluating postoperative pain and the use of analgesics. METHODS Fifty patients were randomized into two groups: Patients of group A (24 patients) were operated with the new self-fixating Parietene progrip mesh without fixation sutures and patients of group B (26 patients) were operated with the traditional Lichtenstein repair. Postoperative course including pain and the use of analgesics were monitored. Patients were reinvestigated after 6 months regarding pain score and the amount of analgesics used during this interval. Primary end point was pain on the first operative day. RESULTS The visual analog scale pain score showed at the first postoperative day a significantly lower level in group A than in group B (mean 17.9 vs. 32.3 mm, p = 0.03). Additionally, the cumulative dose of postoperatively required analgesics was lower in group A than in group B. The operative time in group A was significantly shorter than in group B. Six months after the operation, a trend toward a lower pain score was observed in group A, but this did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS This is the first randomized study to show a beneficial effect of the new self-fixating mesh on pain score. According to our investigations, operative time is reduced, which is a considerable fact with regard to economic aspects as well as the beneficial aspects for the patients.

However, little is known about health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in RFU patients. METHODS EQ-5D, QLQ-C30 and QLQ-C29 questionnaires were distributed to CRC patients enrolled in a RFU programme. The primary outcome of HRQoL scores was analysed by year of RFU, demographics, operation-type, stoma and adherence to RFU protocols. RESULTS 428 respondents (59.3%), mean age of 71years(SD 10.1) and a median RFU time of 2.6years (IQR: 1.6-4.8years) were included. 26.6% of patients reported 'perfect health'. The median EQ-5D index score was 0.785(IQR: 0.671-1) and QLQ-C30 Global HRQoL score was 75(IQR: 58.3-83.3). Females had significantly lower EQ-5D median score of 0.767(IQR: 0.666-0.879, p=0.0088). Lower QLQ-C30 HRQoL scores were seen in stoma patients, median 66.6 (IQR: 58.3-83.3, p=0.0029). Erectile dysfunction (p=0.0006) and poor body image (p=0.001) were also reported more frequently in stoma patients. Patients undergoing right-sided resection reported a lower median EQ-5D score of 0.765(IQR: 0.666-0.879, p=0.028) and higher pain severity (p=0.0367) compared with left-sided resections. There were 128 (29.4%) patients that breached RFU protocol and were seen in adhoc colorectal clinics. However, there was no statistical difference in HRQoL between patients who adhered to or breached RFU protocols. CONCLUSIONS Overall HRQoL in patients in RFU is good, with no difference in those strictly followed up remotely.

Patients were blinded to the surgical approach preoperatively and attempts to continue patient blinding postoperatively were made by applying dressings consistent with multiple conventional laparoscopic incisions for all patients. De-identified data related to the operation, peri-operative course and postoperative follow-up were prospectively collected and compared between the two groups with an intention-to-treat analysis. RESULTS There were no significant differences between the groups when comparing operating time, estimated blood loss (EBL), i.v. fluid administration, renal allograft warm ischaemia time (WIT), length of hospital stay (LOS) and total inpatient analgesic requirements. Quantitative pain assessment was not significantly different on postoperative day (POD) #0, however, it was significantly lower in the LESS-DN group, beginning on POD #1 (P < 0.05). The changes in haematocrit and serum creatinine in the two groups were not significantly different, and there were no blood transfusions in either group, nor was there a decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate to <60 mL/min per 1.73 m² of body surface area in any patients. Two patients in the LESS-DN group were converted to conventional LDN, both because of failure to progress effectively. All allografts were functional at the time of transplantation and revascularization, with no cases of hyperacute rejection. CONCLUSIONS Peri-operative variables including EBL, WIT and LOS were equivalent when comparing Pfannenstiel LESS-DN with conventional LDN. Patient-reported visual analogue pain scale scores were significantly lower in the LESS-DN group beginning on the first postoperative day.","Richstone, Lee; Rais-Bahrami, Soroush; Waingankar, Nikhil; Hillelsohn, Joel H; Andonian, Sero; Schwartz, Michael J; Kavoussi, Louis R",BJU international,233,16

The sizeable disease burden in West Africa, numerous imported LF cases worldwide, and the possibility that LASV can be used as an agent of biological warfare make a strong case for vaccine development. There are no licensed LASV vaccines and the antiviral treatment is limited to an off-label use of ribavirin that is only partially effective. AREAS COVERED LASV vaccine development is hampered by high cost of biocontainment requirement, the absence of appropriate small animal models, genetic diversity of LASV species, and by high HIV-1 prevalence in LASV endemic areas. Over the past 15 years several vaccine platforms have been developed. Natural history of LASV and pathogenesis of the disease provide strong justification for replication-competent (RC) vaccine as one of the most feasible approaches to control LF. Development of LASV vaccine candidates based on reassortant, recombinant, and alphavirus replicon technologies is covered in this review. Expert commentary: Two lead RC vaccine candidates, reassortant ML29 and recombinant VSV/LASV, have been successfully tested in non-human primates and have been recommended by international vaccine experts for rapid clinical development. Both platforms have powerful molecular tools to further secure safety, improve immunogenicity, and cross-protection. These platforms are well positioned to design multivalent vaccines to protect against all LASV strains citculatrd in West Africa. The regulatory pathway of Candid #1, the first live-attenuated arenaviral vaccine against Argentine hemorrhagic, will be a reasonable guideline for LASV vaccine efficacy trials.","Lukashevich, Igor S; Pushko, Peter",Expert review of vaccines,233,26

While natural orifice translumenal endoscopic surgery remains experimental, the single-incision approach could be the future of gallbladder surgery. METHODS Prospectively collected data from 875 patients subjected to conventional single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SILC) or 4-port [laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC)] were retrospectively analyzed and discussed with the current literature. RESULTS Between 2008 and 2011, 201 (23%) SILCs and 674 (77%) LCs were performed. Mean age was 51.7±17.5 years (SILC: 45.1 vs. LC: 53.7 y). Patients were predominantly female (SILC: 75.1% vs. LC: 56.5%). Preoperative body mass index was 27.4±9.1 (SILC: 26.4 vs. LC: 27.8; P<0.05) and American Society of Anesthesiologists' score counted 1.67±0.57 in SILC and 1.86±0.7 in LC patients. Acute inflammation of the gallbladder (AIG) was not considered as a contraindication for SILC (AIG in SILC: 17.4% vs. LC: 35.5%). The mean operative time was significantly lower in the SILC group (SILC: 71±31 vs. LC: 79±27 min) and duration of postoperative hospital stay was shorter (SILC: 3.2±1.7 vs. LC: 4.5±2.6 d). No significant difference was observed between SILC and LC in any of the registered complications, including postoperative bleeding, trocar hernias, wound infection, abdominal abscess formation, bile duct injury, or cystic duct leakage. CONCLUSIONS In the near future SILC could overrule conventional LC as the leading technique for gallbladder surgery. Our data reconfirm an excellent risk profile for SILC that is equal to that of LC. Large multicenter randomized controlled trials will be required to finally legitimize SILC as the succeeding principal method.","Resch, Thomas; Sucher, Robert; Perathoner, Alexander; Laimer, Elisabeth; Mohr, Elisabeth; Pratschke, Johann; Mittermair, Reinhard","Surgical laparoscopy, endoscopy & percutaneous techniques",233,16

Such strand breaks may be caused by exposure to heavy metals. The aim of this study was to assess the level of DNA strand breaks caused by µm-scale solid particles of known chemical composition with elevated heavy metals/metalloids, notably arsenic, using an in vitro cell-free DNA plasmid scission assay. These samples were incubated with and without H2O2 to see whether damage occurs directly or indirectly through the Fenton reaction. Levels of DNA damage in the absence of H2O2 were < 10%, but in the presence of H2O2, all samples showed higher levels of damage ranging from 10 to 100% suggesting that damage was being incurred through the Fenton reaction. Using bivariate correlation analysis and multiple linear regression, manganese oxide (MnO), sulphur (S), copper (Cu), and zinc (Zn) concentrations in the particulates were found to be the most significant predictors of DNA damage. The mechanism of this DNA damage formation has yet to be thoroughly investigated but is hypothesised to be due to reactive oxygen species formation. Further work is required to assess the extent of contribution of reactive oxygen species to this DNA damage, but this study highlights the potential role of chemistry and/or mineralogy to the extent and/or nature of DNA damage caused by particulates.","Badri, Hatim; Polya, David A; Povey, Andrew C",Environmental geochemistry and health,233,1

METHODS All > 16 year-old, HIV-1-infected women, diagnosed in Israel in 2010-2018, (n = 763) registered in the National HIV reference laboratory were included in this cross-sectional study. Demographic and clinical characteristics were extracted from the database. Viral subtypes and transmitted drug resistance mutations (TDRM) were determined in 337 (44.2%) randomly selected samples collected from treatment-naive women. RESULTS Median age at diagnosis was 38 years. Most (73.3%) women were immigrants from the former Soviet Union (FSU) (41.2%, 314) or sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) (32.2%, 246) and carried subtype A (79.7%) or C (90.3%), respectively. Only 11.4% (87) were Israeli-born women. Over the years, the prevalence of women from SSA decreased while that of women from FSU increased significantly (p < 0.001). The median CD4+ cell count was 263 cells/mm3, and higher (391 cells/mm3) in Israeli-born women. TDRM were identified in 10.4% of the tested samples; 1.8, 3 and 7.1% had protease inhibitors (PI), nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) TDRM, respectively. The prevalence of women with NNRTI TDRM significantly increased from 4.9% in 2010-2012 to 13.3% in 2016-2018. Israeli-born women had the highest prevalence (16.3%) of NNRTI TDRM (p = 0.014). NRTI A62 (5.6%), NNRTI E138 and K103 (5.6 and 4.2%, respectively) were the most prominent mutated sites. CONCLUSIONS Most HIV-1-positive women diagnosed in Israel in 2010-2018 were immigrants, with the relative ratio of FSU immigrants increasing in recent years. The high proportion of women diagnosed with resistance mutations, particularly, the yearly increase in the frequency of NNRTI mutations, support the national policy of resistance testing at baseline.","Wagner, Tali; Olshtain-Pops, Karen; Wax, Marina; Horwitz, Olivia; Shirazi, Rachel; Gozlan, Yael; Volnowitz, Hadar; Mendelson, Ella; Levy, Itzchak; Mor, Orna",BMC infectious diseases,233,16

The study aims to effectively capture critical physiological parameters, for instance, oxygen saturation, heart rate, respiration rate and heart rate variability, as extracted from the pulsatile waveforms captured by OEPS against motion artefacts when using the commercial probe. The protocol involved 16 healthy subjects and was designed to test the features of OEPS, with emphasis on the effective reduction of motion artefacts through the utilization of a 3MA as a movement reference. The results show significant agreement between the heart rates from the reference measurements and the recovered signals. Significance of standard deviation and error of mean yield values of 2.27 and 0.65 beats per minute, respectively; and a high correlation (0.97) between the results of the commercial sensor and OEPS. T, Wilcoxon and Bland-Altman with 95% limit of agreement tests were also applied in the comparison of heart rates extracted from these sensors, yielding a mean difference (MD: 0.08). The outcome of the present work incites the prospects of OEPS on physiological monitoring during physical activities.","Alzahrani, Abdullah; Hu, Sijung; Azorin-Peris, Vicente",Biosensors,233,16

Educational interventions to raise awareness on HCV have led to identification of submerged HCV cases. Our aim was to evaluate the effectiveness of a web-based platform to assess and raise the awareness on HCV among Pakistani people living in Northern Italy. We created a website in Italian and Urdu language (https://survey-hcv6.webnode.it), and shared it to Pakistani people in Emilia-Romagna through Facebook groups. Participants had to fill a 15-item questionnaire on HCV infection, then watch a video on HCV, and respond to the questionnaire again. McNemar's chi square and negative binomial multivariable regression analysis yielding incidence rate ratio (IRR) were applied. 339 subjects from 600 (57%) participated and filled the baseline questionnaire. The knowledge on HCV infection was scanty. For instance, 32% were not aware of HCV, 42% only knew that HCV infection may be long-term, and only 14% knew the access to DAA treatment is provided by the Health Service. Independent predictors of worse knowledge on HCV were male gender (IRR 1.19), low instruction level (IRR 1.26), Urdu language preference (IRR 1.22), past use of intravenous drugs (1.2), and no previous HCV testing (IRR 1.36). The educational video significantly improved the knowledge on HCV among 67 subjects who re-filled the questionnaire, as 97% were later aware of HCV, 99% of the long-term duration of HCV infection, and 93% of the access to DAAs provided by Italian Health Service. We found a modest level of knowledge on HCV infection among Pakistani people in Northern Italy, identifying predictors of worse awareness. We provided a multimedia platform which significantly improved the knowledge on HCV infection. Consequently, this approach might translate into an improved linkage to care.","Frazzoni, Leonardo; Sikandar, Usama; Mazzella, Giuseppe; Fuccio, Lorenzo; Bazzoli, Franco; Brillanti, Stefano; Azzaroli, Francesco",Journal of viral hepatitis,233,31

Unmoderated remote research has the potential to strengthen developmental science by: (1) facilitating the implementation of studies that are easily replicable, (2) allowing for new approaches to longitudinal studies and studies of parent-child interaction, and (3) including families from more diverse backgrounds and children growing up in more diverse environments in research. We describe an approach we have used to design and implement unmoderated remote research that is accessible to researchers with limited programming expertise, and we describe the resources we have made available on a new website (discoveriesonline.org) to help researchers get started with implementing this approach. We discuss the potential of this method for developmental science and highlight some challenges still to be overcome to harness the power of unmoderated remote research for advancing the field.","Rhodes, Marjorie; Rizzo, Michael T; Foster-Hanson, Emily; Moty, Kelsey; Leshin, Rachel A; Wang, Michelle; Benitez, Josie; Ocampo, John Daryl",Journal of cognition and development : official journal of the Cognitive Development Society,233,1

Among the 3 Food and Drug Administration-approved medications used to treat opioid use disorder, many patients prefer buprenorphine. But physicians are currently required to register with the Drug Enforcement Administration and complete 8 hours of qualifying training before they can receive a waiver to prescribe buprenorphine to their patients. In this article, the authors summarize the evolution of buprenorphine waiver training in undergraduate medical education and outline 2 potential paths to increase buprenorphine treatment capacity going forward: the curriculum change approach and the training module approach. As part of the 2018 Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment for Patients and Communities Act, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration has provided funding for medical schools to adapt their curricula to meet waiver-training requirements. To date, however, only one school has had its curriculum approved for this purpose. Additionally, recent political efforts have been directed at eliminating aspects of the waiver training requirement and creating a more direct path to integrating waiver qualification into undergraduate medical education. Other medical schools have adopted a more pragmatic approach involving the integration of existing online, in-person, and hybrid waiver-qualifying training modules into the curricula, generally for fourth-year students. This training module approach can be more rapidly, broadly, and cost-effectively implemented than the curriculum change approach. It can also be easily integrated into the online medical curricula that schools developed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Ultimately both curricular changes and support for student completion of existing training modules should be pursued in concert, but focus should not be single-mindedly on the former at the expense of the latter.","Stokes, Daniel C; Perrone, Jeanmarie",Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,233,1

C5A prevents de novo HCV infection and suppresses ongoing infection by inactivating both extra- and intracellular infectious particles, and it is nontoxic in vitro and in vivo at doses at least 100-fold higher than required for antiviral activity. Mutational analysis indicates that C5A's amphipathic alpha-helical structure is necessary but not sufficient for its virocidal activity, which depends on its amino acid composition but not its primary sequence or chirality. In addition to HCV, C5A inhibits infection by selected flaviviruses, paramyxoviruses, and HIV. These results suggest a model in which C5A destabilizes viral membranes based on their lipid composition, offering a unique therapeutic approach to HCV and other viral infections.","Cheng, Guofeng; Montero, Ana; Gastaminza, Pablo; Whitten-Bauer, Christina; Wieland, Stefan F; Isogawa, Masanori; Fredericksen, Brenda; Selvarajah, Suganya; Gallay, Philippe A; Ghadiri, M Reza; Chisari, Francis V",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,233,33

In Guatemala, the first case of COVID-19 was reported on Friday, March 13, 2020, and as a consequence, all higher-level educational institutions were closed. Before the pandemic, in Universidad Galileo, all of the different engineering mathematics courses were taught traditionally following a face-to-face format. As a result, the pandemics' challenge consists of, not only the fact of having to transform the teaching and learning format but also in making the transition in the shortest amount of time possible. During the pandemic, the class sessions continued with the schedule established at the beginning of the semester, but with the help of video conferencing tools. It is important to mention that we used a set of distance teaching tools and techniques that help us fulfilling the main objective of the course: students' learning while enhancing their motivation. A test designed specifically for the pandemic situation was used to measure the students' motivation. Such a test includes sub-scales associated with the students' feelings about the current situation and it also assesses the course structure, flexibility, and content delivery in the virtual format. In this plenary, we present our experience and the main lessons learned from such a transition from traditional to virtual teaching.","Portillo, R.; Alvarado, A.; Ciampi, M.

Then we investigated the different immune phenotypes associated with high and low NE scores. We found repression of immune response genes as a shared feature between classic SCLC and pulmonary neuroendocrine cells of the healthy lung. With loss of NE fate, variant SCLC tumors regain cell-autonomous immune gene expression and exhibit higher tumor-immune interactions. Pan-cancer analysis revealed this NE lineage-specific immune phenotype in other cancers. Additionally, we observed MHC I re-expression in SCLC upon development of chemoresistance.

Temporal changes in the pandemic epidemiology and diversity in the clinical course require careful study to identify determinants of poor outcomes. We analyzed 6255 individuals admitted with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 to one of 5 hospitals in the University of Pennsylvania Health System between March 2020 and March 2021, using electronic health records to assess risk factors and outcomes through 8 weeks post-admission. Discharge, readmission and mortality outcomes were analyzed in a multi-state model with multivariable Cox models for each transition. Mortality varied markedly over time, with cumulative incidence (95% CI) 30 days post-admission of 19.1% (16.9, 21.3) in March-April 2020, 5.7% (4.2, 7.5) in July-October 2020 and 10.5% (9.1,12.0) in January-March 2021; 26% of deaths occurred after discharge. Average age (SD) at admission varied from 62.7 (17.6) to 54.8 (19.9) to 60.5 (18.1); mechanical ventilation use declined from 21.3% to 9-11%. Compared to Caucasian, Black race was associated with more severe disease at admission, higher rates of co-morbidities and low-income resident zip code. Between-race risk differences in mortality risk diminished in multivariable models; while admitting hospital, increasing age, admission early in the pandemic, and severe disease and low blood pressure at admission were associated with increased mortality hazard. Hispanic ethnicity was associated with fewer baseline co-morbidities and lower mortality hazard (0.57, 95% CI: 0.37, .087). Multi-state modeling allows for a unified framework to analyze multiple outcomes throughout the disease course. Morbidity and mortality for hospitalized COVID-19 patients varied over time but post-discharge mortality remained non-trivial. Black race was associated with more risk factors for morbidity and with treatment at hospitals with lower mortality. Multivariable models suggest there are not between-race differences in outcomes. Future work is needed to better understand the identified between-hospital differences in mortality.","Shaw, P. A.; Yang, J. B.; Mowery, D. L.; Schriver, E. R.; Mahoney, K. B.; Bar, K.

Behaviour change can have profound consequences for disease transmission, and epidemic conditions can favour the more rapid adoption of behavioural innovations. We analyse a simple model of coupled behaviour change and infection in a structured population characterised by homophily and outgroup aversion. Outgroup aversion slows the rate of adoption and can lead to lower rates of adoption in the later-adopting group or even behavioural divergence between groups when outgroup aversion exceeds positive ingroup influence. When disease dynamics are coupled to the behaviour-adoption model, a wide variety of outcomes are possible. Homophily can either increase or decrease the final size of the epidemic depending on its relative strength in the two groups and on R0 for the infection. For example, if the first group is homophilous and the second is not, the second group will have a larger epidemic. Homophily and outgroup aversion can also produce dynamics suggestive of a ‘second wave’ in the first group that follows the peak of the epidemic in the second group. Our simple model reveals dynamics that are suggestive of the processes currently observed under pandemic conditions in culturally and/or politically polarised populations such as the USA.","Smaldino, Paul E.; James Holland, Jones",Evolutionary Human Sciences,233,24

In particular, a simulation-based risk analysis approach enables scenario evaluation and comparison to guide decision making and action prioritization under uncertainty. We develop a simulation model to characterize the risks and uncertainties associated with infections resulting from aerosol exposure in in-person classes. We demonstrate this approach by applying it to model a semester of courses in a real college with approximately 11,000 students embedded within a larger university. To have practical impact, risk cannot focus on only infections as the end point of interest, we estimate the risks of infection, hospitalizations, and deaths of students and faculty in the college. We incorporate uncertainties in disease transmission, the impact of policies such as masking and facility interventions, and variables outside of the college's control such as population-level disease and immunity prevalence. We show in our example application that universal use of masks that block 40 percent of aerosols and the installation of near-ceiling, fan-mounted UVC systems both have the potential to lead to substantial risk reductions and that these effects can be modeled at the individual room level. These results exemplify how such simulation-based risk analysis can inform decision making and prioritization under great uncertainty.","Swanson, T.; Guikema, S.

BI 836880 is a humanized bispecific nanobody that targets VEGF and Ang2, and ezabenlimab (BI 754091) is an anti-PD-1 antibody. Phase I studies investigating each as monotherapies have reported safety and preliminary antitumor activity. This ongoing Phase Ib study is evaluating the combination of BI 836880 and ezabenlimab in pts with advanced solid tumors. In Part 1 (dose escalation), the combination was feasible in pts with advanced NSCLC, with a recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) of BI 836880 720 mg + ezabenlimab 240 mg IV q3w. Here, we report updated results from Part 2 (expansion phase), which is assessing the antitumor activity and safety of the RP2D. Methods: Seven cohorts are currently recruiting pts in Part 2: metastatic (m) NSCLC after checkpoint inhibitor (CPI) monotherapy (Cohort A);mNSCLC after chemotherapy (CT) + CPI (Cohort B);mSCLC after CT ± CPI (Cohort C);1 and 2nd recurrences of glioblastoma (GBM;Cohort D);immunotherapy-resistant mmelanoma (Cohort E);hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after prior sorafenib or lenvatinib ± CPI (Cohort F);and previously untreated/unresectable HCC (Cohort G).

We denote by f the fraction of A's, by y the fraction of Y's and by R_0 the average number of secondary infections from a random infected individual. We investigate the effect of non-electronic interventions (voluntary isolation upon symptom onset, quarantining private contacts) and of electronic interventions (contact tracing thanks to the app), depending on the willingness to quarantine, parameterized by four cooperating probabilities. For a given `effective' R_0 obtained with non-electronic interventions, we use non-negative matrix theory and stopping line techniques to characterize mathematically the minimal fraction y_0 of app users needed to curb the epidemic. We show that under a wide range of scenarios, the threshold y_0 as a function of R_0 rises steeply from 0 at R_0=1 to prohibitively large values (of the order of 60-70% up) whenever R_0 is above 1.3. Our results show that moderate rates of adoption of a contact tracing app can reduce R_0 but are by no means sufficient to reduce it below 1 unless it is already very close to 1 thanks to non-electronic interventions.","Lambert, Amaury",,233,29

Requirement to allocate the existing resources for SARS-CoV-2 management during the pandemic has led to significant challenges in pain management as well as in other healthcare services. Objectives: This study aimed to report the outcomes of an interventional pain management unit of a COVID-free hospital, where a fraction of medical services is being provided through telemedicine, and where patients and healthcare workers are screened periodically, in addition to the implementation of guideline-recommended key precautions. Study design: Retrospective chart review. Setting: Pain clinic of a private COVID-free hospital. Methods: A total of 83 patients asymptomatic for SARS-CoV-2 and scheduled for interventional pain management (epidural injection, epidural neuroplasty, peripheral nerve and sympathetic ganglion block, and radiofrequency interventions for non-malignant pain;celiac-splanchnic impar ganglion neurolysis and epidural-spinal port catheter implantation for malignant pain) were screened using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT PCR), Immunoglobulin G and Immunoglobulin M antibodies, and computerized tomography (CT) imaging prior to the intervention and were then followed-up for a minimum duration of 30 days. All healthcare workers of the hospital as well as the staff in the pain management center were monitored with RT-PCR tests performed every 5 days. The efficacy of pain management interventions was assessed using a 10-point visual analogue scale (VAS), while a 5-point post-intervention questionnaire was used to measure the patient satisfaction regarding telemedicine practices, where 5 indicates maximum satisfaction. Results: Patients were finally diagnosed as follows: 2 (2.4%) patients, PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection;3 (3.6%) patients, previous SARS-CoV-2 infection;13 (15.7%) patients, suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection;and 65 (78.3%) patients, no SARS-CoV-2 infection. Three out of the 517 healthcare workers (0.6%) had PCR positivity in routine screening performed throughout the study, and all these three subjects were asymptomatic. Following interventional treatment, VAS scores were significantly reduced at 2 weeks when compared to baseline (3.9 +/- 1.3 vs. 8.6 +/- 1.0, P &lt; 0.001), and this reduction was maintained until month 1. Mean satisfaction scores for the communication with the physician using telemedicine methods and for the follow-up management using telemedicine methods were 3.0 +/- 0.9 and 3.7 +/- 0.6, respectively. None of the patients had steroid-related side effects and none developed new-onset SARS-Cov-2 confirmed or suspected infection throughout the study. Limitations: Retrospective design and relatively small sample size. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that effective diagnostic tests/imaging studies aimed at detecting infected patients and healthcare workers, and telemedicine practices contribute to the provision of safe and feasible pain management practices during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","Comlek, S.; Ordu, A.",Signa Vitae,233,16

In this research, we analyzed how the changes in human mobility during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, from February to April 2020 (i.e., between 17 February and 30 April 2020), affected the daily CO2 emissions for countries having a high number of coronavirus cases at that time. Our daily time-series analyses indicated that when average hours spent at home increased, the amount of daily CO2 emissions declined significantly. The findings suggest that for all three countries (the US, India, and France), a 1% increase in the average duration spent in residential areas reduced daily CO2 emissions by 0.17 Mt, 0.10 Mt, and 0.01 Mt, respectively, during the first wave period. Thus, confining people into their homes contributes to cutting down CO2 emissions remarkably. However, the study also reveals those activities such as visiting parks and going grocery shopping increase CO2 emissions, suggesting that unnecessary human mobility is undesirable for the environment.","Aruga, Kentaka Md Monirul Islam Arifa Jannat",Sustainability,233,1

Instead of just focusing on the transport sector, the authors propose an integrated approach to housing and mobility. This approach acknowledges the challenges posed by inadequate housing and dependence on motorised transport during the COVID-19 crisis. In contrast, adequate housing and cycling became paramount resources while confronting the pandemic. Using Santiago de Chile as a case study, this research examines how different relocation scenarios for its current housing deficit cannot only affect the ability to implement stay-at-home measures, but also the potential of cycling as a relevant commuting alternative. The current location of the families suffering this deficit is compared to three scenarios: compact, pericentral and extended. In light of the learnings from the COVID-19 crisis, a housing-cycling policy becomes a tool for resilience;equity is achieved by enforcing the right to housing, by increasing job opportunities among the poor, and by reducing the dependence on expensive motorised transport;decarbonisation is achieved by promoting active transportation and reducing the dependence on motorisation.","Valenzuela-Levi, N.; Echiburu, T.; Correa, J.; Hurtubia, R.; Munoz, J.

To adapt to late spring arrival at northern latitudes, a lower photoperiodic sensitivity and therefore a higher critical photoperiod for reproductive onset is necessary in northern species to arrest reproductive development until spring onset. Temperature-photoperiod relationships, and hence food availability-photoperiod relationships, are highly latitude dependent. Therefore, we predict PNES sensitivity characteristics to be latitude-dependent. Here, we investigated photoperiodic responses at different times during development in northern- (tundra/root vole, Microtus oeconomus) and southern vole species (common vole, Microtus arvalis) exposed to constant short (SP) or long photoperiod (LP). M. oeconomus grows faster under LP, whereas no photoperiodic effect on somatic growth is observed in M. arvalis. Contrastingly, gonadal growth is more sensitive to photoperiod in M. arvalis, suggesting that photoperiodic responses in somatic and gonadal growth can be plastic, and might be regulated through different mechanisms. In both species, thyroid-stimulating-hormone-β subunit (Tshβ) and iodothyronine-deiodinase 2 (Dio2) expression is highly increased under LP, whereas Tshr and Dio3 decreases under LP. High Tshr levels in voles raised under SP may lead to increased sensitivity to increasing photoperiods later in life. The higher photoperiodic induced Tshr response in M. oeconomus suggests that the northern vole species might be more sensitive to TSH when raised under SP. Species differences in developmental programming of the PNES, which is dependent on photoperiod early in development, may form part divergent breeding strategies evolving as part of latitudinal adaptation. Summary statement Development of the neuroendocrine system driving photoperiodic responses in gonadal and somatic growth differ between the common and the tundra vole, indicating that they use a different breeding strategy.","van Rosmalen, Laura; van Dalum, Jayme; Hazlerigg, David G.; Hut, Roelof A.",bioRxiv,233,24

The construct validity has been carried out with an exploratory factorial analysis (EFA). The sample has been of 598 students of Master's Degree in Teacher Training and the last year (4th) of the Primary Education Degree from the University of Jaen (Spain). It can be concluded that there is a relationship between the different forms of teacher training, from the correlational analysis the highest coefficient is between teacher training and teacher training in ecology and teacher training in inclusive education. From the CFA it is confirmed that this correlation is a very strong one, so that inclusion and ecology should be central axes in all teacher training, on the other hand, it concludes the low relationship between teacher training and teacher training in times of pandemic, so that, at least in theory, covid-19 should not affect teacher training. © 2021 North Caucasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, State Technological University.

Career choice is a multi-factorial process that evolves over time; among all trainees, expressed interest in faculty research careers decreases over time in graduate school, but that trend is amplified in women and members of historically underrepresented racial and ethnic groups (Fuhrmann, Halme, O’Sullivan, & Lindstaedt, 2011; Gibbs, McGready, Bennett, & Griffin, 2014; C. Golde & Dore, 2004; Roach & Sauermann, 2017; Sauermann & Roach, 2012). Neuroscience as a discipline has characteristics that may exacerbate the overall trends seen in the life sciences, such as a greater growth in the number of awarded neuroscience PhDs than in other life sciences fields (US National Science Foundation, 2016b). This work was designed to investigate how career interest changes over time among recent neuroscience PhD graduates, and whether differences in career interests are associated with social identity (i.e. gender and race/ethnicity), experiences in graduate school and postdoctoral training (e.g. relationship with advisor; feelings of belonging), and personal characteristics (e.g. confidence in one’s potential to be an independent researcher). We report results from a survey of 1,479 PhD neuroscientists (including 16% underrepresented (UR) and 54% female scientists). We saw repeated evidence that individual preferences about careers in general, and academic careers specifically, predict current career interest. These statistically significant preferences mostly had medium to low effect size that varied by career type. These findings were mediated by social identity and experiences in graduate school and postdoctoral training. Our findings highlight the important influence of the advisor in shaping a trainee’s career path, and the ways in which academic culture is perceived as unwelcoming or incongruent with the values or priorities of certain groups. For women, issues of work/life balance and structural issues of academia, and for UR women in particular, lower confidence in their ability to be an independent researcher, affected their interest in academia. Both women and UR men in our study report a lower importance of autonomy in their careers. UR respondents report feeling less like they were a part of the social and intellectual community. However, they have formed beneficial relationships with faculty outside their PhD institutions that, particularly for UR women, are associated with increased interest in academia. Our findings suggest several areas for positive growth, ways to change how we think about the impact of mentorship, and policy and programmatic interventions that extend beyond trying to change or “fix” the individual and instead recognize the systemic structures that influence career choices.","Ullrich, Lauren E.; Ogawa, John; Jones-London, Michelle D.",bioRxiv,233,25

METHODS: We utilized the UK Biobank to investigate the relationships of social isolation and loneliness with dementia (n = 462,619). Neuroanatomical correlates were identified in a subset of participants (n = 32,263). The transcriptomic signatures of related brain changes were characterized by gene enrichment analysis. RESULTS: After full adjustment, social isolation but not loneliness was associated with dementia (hazard ratio: 1.28, 95% confidence interval: 1.17-1.39). Isolated individuals had reduced gray matter volumes in temporal, frontal, occipital and subcortical regions (e.g., hippocampus and amygdala). Relevant brain changes were spatially correlated with genes involved in mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative phosphorylation, and down-regulated Alzheimer's disease-related genes. DISCUSSION: Social isolation is an independent risk factor for dementia, which could be partly explained by related structural changes coupling with altered molecular functions.","Shen, C.; Sahakian, B.; Cheng, W.; Kang, J.; Dong, G.; Xie, C.; Zhao, X.-M.; Feng, J.",,233,1

Good's syndrome (GS), which occurs in approximately 6% to 11% of T patients, is characterized by hypogammaglobulinemia, few or absent B-cells (CD19+), CD4 T cells lymphopenia, abnormal CD4/CD8 T ratio and impaired T cell mitogenic response. Patients with GS have increased susceptibility to bacterial, opportunistic and viral infections related to both humoral and cell-mediated immunodeficiency. The recent Sars-Cov-2 pandemic drew attention to the clinical condition of fatal viral pneumonitis and cytokines storm. Here we reported our monocentric experience of pneumonitis in patients with T and GS before the Sars-Cov-2 pandemic. Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of T patients with associated GS referred to the Rare Tumours Reference Center of University Federico II of Naples over a 10-year period (from 2009 to 2019). All the patients with radiological and/or clinical pneumonitis diagnosis were evaluated for this report. Immunological features, histopathological diagnosis and clinical outcome were registered. Results: A total of 41 patients with T and GS were identified, including 17 patients with local disease (stage I-II according to Masaoka-Koga) and 24 with advanced disease (stage III-IV). The majority (56.3%) had B2 T diagnosis. Radiological and/or clinical pneumonitis diagnosis was assessed in 23 cases (56%). Viral pneumonitis was detected in 8 patients: 3 patients with H1N1 infection, 3 patients with CMV infection, 2 patients with EBV infection. Bacterial pneumonitis was diagnosed in 9 patients (3 patients with K. pneumoniae, 4 patients with S. aureus, 2 patients with H. influenza). Opportunistic pneumonitis was found in 2 patients with Aspergillosis infection. In 2 cases no pathogenic agent was identified. The immunophenotyping, assessed in 4 patients with viral pneumonitis, displayed very low/undetectable levels of B cells, with median % value of CD3+T cells and NKT of respectively 9.8% and 0.4% of the total leukocytes. The median % of Treg was 4.7%. CD4+/CD8+ ratio was variable, ranging from 1,2 to 0,6. Interestingly the number of B cells was extremely low, independent of CD4+/CD8+ ratio. Blood levels of cytokines, chemokines and growth factors revealed elevated IL-4, Eotaxin, CCL2 / MCP-1 and CCL5 / RANTES ad strong reduction of IL-10. PDGF-BB levels were also elevated. 15 patients required admission to intensive care Six patients died for fatal pneumonitis. Conclusions: The management of T patients with GS is extremely challenging. Clear diagnostic algorithms do not yet exist and immune-profiling and quantitative immunoglobulins should be considered a part of diagnostic search in these patients. The coexistence of cancer, infections and immunosuppression may trigger lifethreatening conditions, such as fatal pneumonitis, which often require intensive care and multidisciplinary approach.","Ottaviano, M.; De Placido, P.; Pietroluongo, E.; Tortora, M.; Picozzi, F.; Mucci, B.; Riccio, V.; Formisano, P.; Daniele, B.; De Placido, S.; Giuliano, M.; Palmieri, G.",Journal of Clinical Oncology,233,1

Our objective was to develop a risk score that can accurately quantify a patient's probability of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods This observational study enrolled consecutive adults who presented to the emergency departments of 32 hospitals participating in Canadian COVID-19 Emergency Department Rapid Response Network (CCEDRRN) and were tested for SARS-CoV-2. We divided our study population by randomly assigning study sites into derivation (75%) and validation (25%) cohorts. We pre-specified predictors and used multiple imputation for variables with incomplete data. In the derivation cohort, we fit models using logistic regression, with spline functions for continuous variables, to predict the primary outcome of a positive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test. We used a fast step-down procedure to select a concise model. The final reduced model had points allocated to each variable based on their predictive strength. We then validated the model in the geographically distinct validation cohort. Findings We derived a ten-item CCEDRRN COVID-19 Infection Score using data from 21,743 patients. This score included variables from history and physical examination, and an indicator of local disease incidence. The score had a C-statistic of 0.838 with excellent calibration. We externally validated the rule in 5,295 patients. The score maintained excellent discrimination and calibration, and had superior performance compared to another previously published risk score. Interpretation The CCEDRRN COVID-19 Infection Score uses clinical characteristics and publicly available indicators of disease incidence to quantify a patient's probability of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The score can identify patients at sufficiently high risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection to warrant isolation and empiric therapy prior to test confirmation, while also identifying patients at sufficiently low risk of infection that they may not need testing.

Crowded indoor environments, such as schools, represent possible hotspots for virus transmission since the basic non-pharmaceutical mitigation measures applied so far (e.g. social distancing) do not eliminate the airborne transmission mode. There is widespread consensus that improved ventilation is needed to minimize the transmission potential of airborne viruses in schools, whether through mechanical systems or ad-hoc manual airing procedures in naturally ventilated buildings. However, there remains significant uncertainty surrounding exactly what ventilation rates are required, and how to best achieve these targets with limited time and resources. This paper uses a mass balance approach to quantify the ability of both mechanical ventilation and ad-hoc airing procedures to mitigate airborne transmission risk in the classroom environment. For naturally-ventilated classrooms, we propose a novel feedback control strategy using CO2 concentrations to continuously monitor and adjust the airing procedure. Our case studies show how such procedures can be applied in the real world to support the reopening of schools during the pandemic. Our results also show the inadequacy of relying on absolute CO2 concentration thresholds as the sole indicator of airborne transmission risk.","Stabile, L.; Pacitto, A.; Mikszewski, A.; Morawska, L.; Buonanno, G.",,233,28

MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective review of a prospectively maintained testicular torsion database was performed. Patients ≤ 18 years of age evaluated in our emergency room between 3/11/2020 to 10/1/2020 (during-COVID-19) and the same period in 2018 and 2019 (pre-COVID-19) with US diagnosed and OR confirmed testicular torsion were included. Basic demographics, timing of presentation, referral rate, time to OR and orchiectomy rate were extracted and compared. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS A total of 82 torsions were included in the study; 55 pre-COVID-19 and 27 during-COVID-19. The incidence of testicular torsion remained the same; 3.93 cases/month pre-COVID-19 versus 3.86 cases/month during-COVID-19 (p = 0.791). However, there were significantly fewer delayed (> 24 hours) presentations (11.1% versus 45.5% , p = 0.003), shorter time from onset of symptoms to presentation (median 15.5 hours versus 8 hours, p = 0.001), and a lower but not statistically significant overall orchiectomy rate (33.3% versus 50.9% p = 0.1608) during-COVID-19. Among those presenting acutely with torsion (< 24 hours from onset), no statistical differences were found in the median time from US diagnosis to OR, from ED to OR, referral rate, or orchiectomy rate between the two groups. Lastly, SARS-CoV2 testing did not delay median time from ED to OR. CONCLUSIONS There was a notably less delayed presentation of testicular torsion and shorter ischemia time on presentation during-COVID, however, no significant change of time to OR or orchiectomy rate in those with acute testicular torsion were observed.","Lee, Albert S; Pohl, Hans G; Rushton, H Gil; Davis, Tanya D",The Canadian journal of urology,233,22

Its economic performance has been solid despite the recession that began in 2008. Life expectancy in Canada continues to rise and is high compared with most OECD countries; however, infant and maternal mortality rates tend to be worse than in countries such as Australia, France and Sweden. About 70% of total health expenditure comes from the general tax revenues of the federal, provincial and territorial governments. Most public revenues for health are used to provide universal medicare (medically necessary hospital and physician services that are free at the point of service for residents) and to subsidise the costs of outpatient prescription drugs and long-term care. Health care costs continue to grow at a faster rate than the economy and government revenue, largely driven by spending on prescription drugs. In the last five years, however, growth rates in pharmaceutical spending have been matched by hospital spending and overtaken by physician spending, mainly due to increased provider remuneration. The governance, organization and delivery of health services is highly decentralized, with the provinces and territories responsible for administering medicare and planning health services. In the last ten years there have been no major pan-Canadian health reform initiatives but individual provinces and territories have focused on reorganizing or fine tuning their regional health systems and improving the quality, timeliness and patient experience of primary, acute and chronic care. The medicare system has been effective in providing Canadians with financial protection against hospital and physician costs. However, the narrow scope of services covered under medicare has produced important gaps in coverage and equitable access may be a challenge in these areas.","Marchildon, Gregory",Health systems in transition,233,19

It is done to maintain plasma concentration of the drug under therapy within a specific target range for maximum therapeutic efficacy without unnecessary exposure to adverse effects. Objective This study aims to evaluate necessity of therapeutic drug monitoring in Phenytoin, Carbamazepine and Lamotrigine therapy among epileptic patients. Method A prospective, cross-sectional study was conducted for a period of one year at BP Koirala Institute of Health Sciences, Dharan, Nepal. After taking detailed history, blood samples were collected from epileptic patients on monotherapy with the selected drugs. Plasma levels of these drugs were analyzed using High Performance Liquid Chromatography technique (HPLC). Out of total 42 selected patients, 21 were tested for phenytoin, 17 for carbamazepine and four for lamotrigine. The result was categorized into therapeutic, sub-therapeutic and above-therapeutic groups based on reference range. Result Out of total 21 samples tested for phenytoin, 15(71.4%) had plasma drug level within therapeutic range, 5(23.8%) had within subtherapeutic range and 1(4.8%) had above therapeutic range. Analysis of carbamazepine plasma level showed 14(82.3%) at therapeutic level, 1(5.9%) at sub-therapeutic level and 2(11.8%) at above-therapeutic level. Lamotrigine testing in four samples showed 2(50% in) both within therapeutic range and above-therapeutic range. Conclusion Therapeutic drug monitoring of phenytoin, carbamazepine and lamotrigine showed variation in plasma level irrespective of the therapeutic dose. It is suggested that dose adjustment of antiepileptic drugs should be done after establishing 'individual therapeutic range' following regular plasma monitoring.","Mandal, N K; Rauniar, G P; Rai, D S; Pradhan, B; Poudel, P; Sapkota, N",Kathmandu University medical journal,233,1

To address this we developed a Multidisciplinary Operating Room Simulation (MORSim) intervention to improve teamwork in the operating room (OR) and piloted it with 20 OR teams in two of the 20 District Health Boards in New Zealand prior to national implementation. In this study, we describe the experience of those exposed to the intervention, challenges to implementing changes in clinical practice and suggestions for successful implementation of the programme at a regional or national level. METHODS We undertook semi-structured interviews of a stratified random sample of MORSim participants 3-6 months after they attended the course. We explored their experiences of changes in clinical practice following MORSim. Interviews were recorded, transcribed and analysed using a general inductive approach to develop themes into which interview data were coded. Interviews continued to the point of thematic saturation. RESULTS Interviewees described adopting into practice many of the elements of the MORSim intervention and reported positive experiences of change in communication, culture and collaboration. They described sharing MORSim concepts with colleagues and using them in teaching and orientation of new staff. Reported barriers to uptake included uninterested colleagues, limited team orientation, communication hierarchies, insufficient numbers of staff exposed to MORSim and failure to prioritise time for team information sharing such as pre-case briefings. CONCLUSION MORSim appears to have had lasting effects on reported attitudes and behaviours in clinical practice consistent with more effective teamwork and communication. This study adds to the accumulating body of evidence on the value of simulation-based team training and offers suggestions for implementing widespread, regular team training for OR teams.","Weller, Jennifer; Civil, Ian; Torrie, Jane; Cumin, David; Garden, Alexander; Corter, Arden; Merry, Alan",The New Zealand medical journal,233,9

The screening levels in the current protocol were based on the 1997 prevalence study by Wong et al. In the study, it appeared that there was a significant increase in prevalence rates between 9- and 11-year-old girls (i.e. between Primary 4 and Primary 6) but there was no data on the prevalence rates of scoliosis in 10-year-old girls (Primary 5) and in 12-year-old girls (Secondary 1). In order to decide on whether to make changes to the screening levels, a review was conducted to determine the prevalence of scoliosis among the 10-year-old girls (in Primary 5) and 12-year-old girls (in Secondary 1). MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 93,626 female students, aged between 9 and 13 years old were screened. The study covered all of the 183 primary schools and only 83 of the 165 secondary schools due to a disruption of health screening in schools during the outbreak of SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome). In mid-2003, schools in Singapore were closed because Singapore was one of the countries affected by SARS. Scoliosis screening was done for all female students in the Primary 4, 5 and 6 levels as well as in the Secondary 1 and 2 levels. Male students were routinely screened for scoliosis in the Primary 6 and Secondary 2 levels. Scoliosis screening was done by measuring the angle of trunk rotation (ATR) using a scoliometer. All students with ATR >or=5 degrees were referred to the Student Health Centre (SHC) where second-tier screening was done. At SHC, if ATR >or=5 degrees , postero-anterior radiograph of the spine was done. Of the 3186 female students in the primary level, aged between 9 and 13 years old who were referred to SHC for the second-tier screening, 2438 attended, and for secondary students aged between 12 and 13 years old, 1587 out of 1720 students attended. RESULTS The prevalence rates of idiopathic adolescent scoliosis for the 9- to 13-year-old female students were 0.27%, 0.64%, 1.58%, 2.22% and 2.49%, respectively, which showed an increasing trend in the prevalence rates with increasing age. There was a significant increase in the prevalence rates of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) in the 10- to 11-year-old females compared to the 9-year-old females (OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.1-2.4; P = 0.010). There was also a significant increase in the prevalence rates in the 12- to 13-year-old females (OR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.4-3.3; P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS The study showed a significant increase in the prevalence rates of scoliosis in the 10- to 11-year-old female students and again a significant increase in the prevalence rates in the 12- to 13-year-old female students. Since the prevalence rate for the 9-year-old females was quite low (0.27%), and there was a significant increase in the prevalence rates in the 10- to 11-year-old and 12- to 13-year-old females, it was recommended that screening for females be performed every year commencing at 10 years old (Primary 5) until 13 years old (Secondary 2).","Yong, Flordeliza; Wong, Hee-Kit; Chow, Khuan-Yew","Annals of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore",233,4

A minimally invasive approach is currently applied to the procedure. The two major steps are dissection and stapling. For dissection, several tools have been developed. The goal of this study was to compare the efficiency and the ergonomics of two ultrasonic devices during the sleeve gastrectomy. MATERIALS AND METHODS Thirty patients were randomised for the use of a cordless Sonicision™ (Covidien, Mansfield, MA) or a cord-containing HARMONIC ACE®+ (Ethicon Endo-Surgery Inc., Cincinnati, OH) during dissection. Both devices were assessed for objective and subjective measures. RESULTS There was no significant difference in duration of the procedures. The assembly and installation time of the Sonicision™ were significantly shorter; however, the dismantle time was not. No difference in plume formation or dissection failures was found between the devices. Scrub nurses scored the Sonicision™ significantly clearer and easier in use and more reliable. The surgeons, however, did not find one of the devices easier in use, more reliable or precise, but they did report better manoeuvrability of the Sonicision™. CONCLUSION In comparison to the wired HARMONIC ACE®+, during sleeve gastrectomy, the cordless Sonicision™ was considered easier to use, faster during assembling and installation, and more reliable with better manoeuvrability. Surgeons scored both devices equally effective. Both ultrasonic devices can be used easily and safely for a sleeve gastrectomy.","van Rutte, Pim W J; Lup, Sandra L; Luyer, Misha D; Jakimowicz, Jack J; Goossens, Richard H M; Nienhuijs, Simon W",Surgical technology international,233,1

In this study, we characterized the soluble factor involved in MHC antigen induction, quantitated induction of MHC antigens, and analyzed the central nervous system cell type involved in the production of the factor. The H-2-inducing factor, most likely produced by astrocytes, was found to be nondialyzable, heat- and trypsin-sensitive, but resistant to treatment at pH 2.0. The m.w. of the factor was estimated as 50 to 100 kDa. Studies on fractionation by ultrafiltration and sucrose density gradient along with antibody-blocking experiments indicate that the factor is not interferon or virus particles.","Suzumura, A; Lavi, E; Bhat, S; Murasko, D; Weiss, S R; Silberberg, D H",Journal of immunology,233,9

As a stringent model we tested the topologically complex epithelial ion channel CFTR. Initially an attenuated vaccinia virus was found capable of transferring CFTR in a properly folded, functional and regulatable form to CFTR negative cells. Next we generated viruslike particles (VLPs) composed of retroviral structural proteins that assemble and bud at the host cell plasma membrane. These particles were also shown to mediate functional ion channel transfer. By testing the capacity of complex membrane proteins to incorporate into viral envelopes these experiments provide new insight into the permissiveness of viral envelopment, including the ability of incorporated proteins to retain function and repair defects at the cell surface, and serve as a platform for studies of ion channel and membrane protein biochemistry.","Curlee, Kimberly V; Hong, Jeong S; Clancy, J P; King, Scott A; Hunter, Eric; Berdiev, Bakhrom; Benos, Dale; Sommerfelt, Maja A; Sorscher, Eric J; Sakalian, Michael",Journal of molecular medicine,233,16

While several medications are beneficial, achieving optimal guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) is challenging. COVID-19 created a need to explore new ways to deliver care. METHODS Fifty consecutive patients were taught to identify fluid congestion and monitor their vital signs using BP monitors and electronic scales with NP-led telephone support. Quantitative data were collected and a patient experience interview was performed. RESULTS The majority (76%) of the cohort (male, 76%; Māori/Pacific, 58%) had a new diagnosis of HFrEF, with 90% having severe left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. There were 216 contacts (129 (60%) by telephone), which eliminated travelling, (time saved, 2.12 hours per patient), petrol costs ($58.17 per patient), traffic pollution (607 Kg of CO2) and time off work. Most (75%) received contact within two weeks and 75% were optimally titrated within two months. Improvements in systolic BP (SBP) (124mmHg to 116mmHg), pulse (78 bpm to 70 bpm) and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) (292 to 65) were identified.

The enigmatic expression of histocompatibility in vertebrates, the manifestation of natural chimerism, autoimmunity, malignancy, and other puzzling outcomes hint that immunity did not arise in evolution to fight infections and that this capacity is a late evolutionary appendage, owing its appearance to the redeployment of a system developed for other reasons. Allorecognition in the colonial tunicate Botryllus schlosseri serves here as a platform for a contending paradigm, advocating that immunity has developed as a surveillance machinery against and for purging of nascent selfish cells (stemmed from a kin organism or from transformed cells within the organism of origin). Defense against pathogens (always representing xenogeneic aliens) appeared later, revealing the multiplicity of newly developed phenomena. Allorecognition events characteristic of the Botryllus primitive immune system, such as fusion versus rejection, the morphological resorption with its expressed hierarchy, and the somatic/germ-cell parasitic outcomes, provide clues to the evolutionary basis of allorecognition.

The assay was applied to the screening of 329 nasopharyngeal aspirates sampled from patients suffering from respiratory tract disease. These samples were negative for other common microbial causes of respiratory tract disease. We were able to detect hMPV sequences in 32 (9.7%) samples collected from Australian patients during 2001. To further reduce result turnaround times we designed a fluorogenic TaqMan oligoprobe and combined it with the existing primers for use on the LightCycler platform. The real-time RT-PCR proved to be highly reproducible and detected hMPV in an additional 6 out of 62 samples (9.6%) tested during the comparison of the two diagnostic approaches.

Electrolytic brine was an optimal oxidation gel breaker and molecular sieve loaded with Fe/Ni as catalyst for the treatment of fracturing flowback. Fe/Ni catalyst was characterized by SEM, EDS analysis, TEM and XRD, and the catalytic effect of the Fe/Ni proportion was explored. Fracturing flowback that dealt with catalytic oxidation was mixed with polyaluminum chloride (PAC) and polyacrylamide (PAM) for flocculation and sedimentation, through a filter, and was continuously treated for 20 days to simulate on-site operation. Finally, the suspended solids (SS) content of the fracturing flowback was steadily less than 15 mg/L, which meets the reinjection standard of fracturing flowback (SY/T 5329-2012 (China)).

Reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) targeting the SARS-CoV-2 genome on nasopharyngeal swab samples is currently the reference test. While displaying excellent analytical sensitivity and specificity, this test is costly, often requires a substantial turnaround time, and, more importantly, is subject to reagent and other material shortages. To complement this technology, rapid antigen tests have been developed and made available worldwide, allowing cheap, quick, and decentralized SARS-CoV-2 testing. The main drawback of these tests is the reduced sensitivity when RT-PCR is the gold standard. In this study, we evaluate Visby an innovative, portable, easy-to-use RT-PCR point-of-care (POC) diagnostic device. Our retrospective analysis shows that overall, compared to the Cobas 6800 RT-qPCR assay (Roche), this RT-PCR POC technology detects SARS-CoV-2 RNA with 95% sensitivity (95%CI = 86.3-99%) and 100% specificity (95% CI = 80.5-100%). For samples with cycle-threshold values below 31, we observed 100% sensitivity (95% CI = 66.4-100%). While showing an analytical sensitivity slightly below that of a standard RT-qPCR system, the evaluated Visby RT-PCR POC device may prove to be an interesting diagnostic alternative in the COVID-19 pandemic, potentially combining the practical advantages of rapid antigen tests and the robust analytical performances of nucleic acid detection systems.","Renzoni, A.; Perez, F.; Ngo Nsoga, M.

Therefore, we sought to characterize the peritherapeutic HRQOL of contemporary patients using the well-validated EQ-5D-5L questionnaire. METHODS: All patients receiving radiotherapy for H&N cancers between July 2019 and November 2019 at the University of Freiburg Medical Center who completed the first two follow-ups were included. HRQOL was assessed by the validated EQ-5D-5L questionnaire before radiotherapy, after therapy completion, and three and six months following radiotherapy. The changes from baseline to six months for HI and EQ VAS scores were recorded. RESULTS: All 49 patients completed the questionnaires at all time points of data collection, yielding 196 total questionnaires. Twenty-eight patients (57.1%) received definitive, 20 (40.8%) adjuvant, and one 2.1%) patient palliative radiotherapy. The mean EQ-5D-5L index score of the overall population before radiotherapy, after radiotherapy, and three and six months following radiotherapy was 0.837 (standard deviation, SD 0.17), 0.828 (SD 0.16), 0.855 (SD 0.15), and 0.856 (SD 0.14) respectively. The respective mean EQ VAS scores were 63.88 (SD 20.72), 63.67 (SD 21.81), 63.67 (SD 21.81), and 65.20 (SD 22.41) respectively. The respective changes of the HI and EQ VAS score over time for this cohort were not significant (Friedman test p=0.273, p=0.618). CONCLUSION: Despite the known therapy-related toxicities, no significant permanent deterioration of HRQOL in this cohort was observed. Sub-populations at relatively higher risk of HRQOL deterioration may allow for increased clinical monitoring.","Sprave, Tanja; Zamboglou, Constantinos; Verma, Vivek; Nicolay, Nils H; Grosu, Anca-Ligia; Lindenmeier, Jörg; Tscheulin, Dieter K",,233,25

METHODS AND RESULTS: Retrospective observational study. Patients taking statins were 11 years older and had significantly more comorbidities than patients who were not taking statins. A genetic matching (GM) procedure was performed prior to analysis of the mortality risk. A Cox proportional hazards model was used for the cause-specific hazard (CSH) function, and a competing-risks Fine and Gray (FG) model was also used to study the direct effects of statins on risk.Data from reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction-confirmed 2157 SARS-CoV-2-infected patients (1234 men, 923 women; age: 67 y/o (IQR 54-78)) admitted to the hospital were retrieved from the clinical records in anonymized manner. 353 deaths occurred. 581 patients were taking statins. Univariate test after GM showed a significantly lower mortality rate in patients on statin therapy than the matched non-statin group (19.8% vs. 25.4%, &#967;2 with Yates continuity correction: p = 0.027). The mortality rate was even lower in patients (n = 336) who maintained their statin treatments during hospitalization compared to the GM non-statin group (17.4%; p = 0.045). The Cox model applied to the CSH function (HR = 0.58(CI: 0.39-0.89); p = 0.01) and the competing risks FG model (HR = 0.60(CI: 0.39-0.92); p = 0.02) suggest that statins are associated with reduced COVID-19-related mortality. CONCLUSIONS: A lower SARS-CoV-2 infection-related mortality was observed in patients treated with statin therapy prior to hospitalization.

There is a major effort underway to develop antithrombotic drugs that have a smaller impact on hemostasis. The plasma contact proteins factor XI (FXI) and factor XII (FXII) have drawn considerable interest because they contribute to thrombosis but have limited roles in hemostasis. Here, we discuss results of preclinical and clinical trials supporting the hypothesis that the contact system contributes to thromboembolic disease. RECENT FINDINGS: Numerous compounds targeting FXI or FXII have shown antithrombotic properties in preclinical studies. In phase 2 studies, drugs-targeting FXI or its protease form FXIa compared favorably with standard care for venous thrombosis prophylaxis in patients undergoing knee replacement. While less work has been done with FXII inhibitors, they may be particularly useful for limiting thrombosis in situations where blood comes into contact with artificial surfaces of medical devices. SUMMARY: Inhibitors of contact activation, and particularly of FXI, are showing promise for prevention of thromboembolic disease. Larger studies are required to establish their efficacy, and to establish that they are safer than current therapy from a bleeding standpoint.","Srivastava, Priyanka; Gailani, David",Curr Opin Hematol,233,20

We show that the size distribution has a Pareto upper tail, with exponent equal to the unique positive solution to an equation involving the spectral radius of a certain matrix-valued function. We illustrate the use of our results by applying them to the wealth distribution in a heterogeneous-agent general equilibrium model, in which agents engage in private enterprise and trade risk-free bonds while subject to Markov-switching productivity and mortality risk.

Fifty-nine percent of spondylosis patients who underwent cervical facet procedures reported significant improvement in neck and head symptoms. Of patients with both head and neck complaints, 82% had both migraine and spondylosis, which, when combined with the high response rate to injections raises the possibility of cervicogenic headache.

DESIGN: This descriptive ecological observational study. SETTING: 224 cantons (geographical area) of Ecuador with secondary data sources of hospital information. PARTICIPANTS: The unit of measurement was 224 cantons of Ecuador, in which analysed morbidity and lethality rates for SARI using hospital release data (2016-2018). MAIN MEASUREMENTS: Eight sociodemographic indicators were structuralized, and correlation tests applied for a multiple regression model. The priorization index was created with criteria of efficiency, efficacy, effect size (IRR) and equity. Using the sum of the index for each indicator, the priorization score was calculated and localized in a territorial map. RESULTS: Morbidity associated factors where: school attendance years, urbanization and population density; for mortality resulted: school attendance and ethnics (indigenous) IRR: 1.09 (IC95%:1.06-1.15) and IRR: 1.024 (IC95%:102-1.03) respectively. With lethality where related cantons, with population older than 60 years, IRR: 1.049 (IC95%: 1.03-1.07); 87 cantons had high priority mostly localized in the mountain region and the Morona Santiago Province. CONCLUSIONS: Morbidity and mortality of SARI in Ecuador are associated to social and demographic factors. Priorization exercises considering these factors permit the identification of vulnerable territories facing respiratory disease propagation. The social determinants characteristic for each territory should be added to known individual factors to analyse the risk and vulnerability for COVID in the population.","Ríos Quituizaca, Paulina; Calderón, Lilian; Piedra, Santiago; Guerrero, Jhon; Narváez, Alberto",Aten Primaria,233,24

However, the public's concern by now is to find answers for two questions; (1) When this COVID-19 pandemic will be over? and (2) After coming to its end, will COVID-19 return again in what is known as a second rebound of the pandemic? In this work, we developed a predictive model that can estimate the expected period that the virus can be stopped and the risk of the second rebound of COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, we have considered the SARIMA model to predict the spread of the virus on several selected countries and used it for predicting the COVID-19 pandemic life cycle and its end. The study can be applied to predict the same for other countries as the nature of the virus is the same everywhere. The proposed model investigates the statistical estimation of the slowdown period of the pandemic which is extracted based on the concept of normal distribution. The advantages of this study are that it can help governments to act and make sound decisions and plan for future so that the anxiety of the people can be minimized and prepare the mentality of people for the next phases of the pandemic. Based on the experimental results and simulation, the most striking finding is that the proposed algorithm shows the expected COVID-19 infections for the top countries of the highest number of confirmed cases will be manifested between Dec-2020 and Apr-2021. Moreover, our study forecasts that there may be a second rebound of the pandemic in a year time if the currently taken precautions are eased completely. We have to consider the uncertain nature of the current COVID-19 pandemic and the growing inter-connected and complex world, that are ultimately demanding flexibility, robustness and resilience to cope with the unexpected future events and scenarios.","Malki, Zohair; Atlam, El-Sayed; Ewis, Ashraf; Dagnew, Guesh; Alzighaibi, Ahmad Reda; ELmarhomy, Ghada; Elhosseini, Mostafa A; Hassanien, Aboul Ella; Gad, Ibrahim",Neural Comput Appl,233,24

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), an important component of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), displays circadian rhythmicity. Studies have shown that over-expression of human ACE2 increases the replication of SARS-CoV-2, which may lead to disruptions and tissue damage due to the suppression of the brain and muscle ARNT-like protein-1(Bmal1) gene and high pro-inflammatory cytokines expressions in the tissues. Therefore, understanding and regulating the circadian rhythm and expression pattern of the key components of RAAS can prevent or reduce the severity of acute kidney injury that may occur with COVID-19 infection.","Mercan, Merve; Sehirli, Ahmet Özer; Chukwunyere, Ugochukwu; Abacioglu, Nurettin",Med Hypotheses,233,1

This is the first case in Europe, an unexpected one. This paper focuses on the issues that the arrival of CWD raises in Northern Europe, especially regarding the Indigenous Sami reindeer husbandry in Sweden. The study offers a diagnosis of the situation regarding the management of the disease and its risks. We present the importance of the involvement of the Sami people in the surveillance program in order to understand better the diseases and the reindeer populations, movement, and behavior. However, the implementation of new European health standards in the Sami reindeer herding could have tremendous consequences on the evolution of this ancestral activity and the relationship between herders and reindeer.AbstractChronic wasting disease (CWD) is the most transmissible of the prion diseases. In 2016, an unexpected case was found in Norway, the first in Europe. Since then, there have been 32 confirmed cases in Norway, Sweden, and Finland. This paper aims to examine the situation from a social and political perspective: considering the management of CWD in the Swedish part of Sápmi—the Sami ancestral land;identifying the place of the Sami people in the risk management–because of the threats to Sami reindeer herding that CWD presents;and understanding how the disease can modify the modalities of Indigenous reindeer husbandry, whether or not CWD is epizootic. Based on interviews with various stakeholders and by examining the social sciences literature, this paper shows that the health risk management is structured by a politico-scientific controversy about the recognition, or not, of atypical and classical CWD. The Sami herders are currently cooperating with the state authorities in the surveillance program to sample their herds. This involvement takes place in a situation where the balance of power between the Sami people and the state, or the European Union, is framed by its colonial context. This has consequences with respect to the definition of a common interest and to implementing sanitary measures. The particular features of reindeer herding are seen as a challenge to managing CWD risk, compared with European health standards. We argue that CWD will greatly modify the modalities of Indigenous reindeer herding, whether there are positive cases or not in the Sami reindeer. By implementing new health guidelines, the authorities will create a cascading effect in Sami land and its use. The CWD situation in Fennoscandia is full of uncertainty but may cause a major shift in the organization and the governance of Sápmi. In September 2020, the identification of a new CWD case in a wild reindeer in Norway started a new episode in the disease management in Fennoscandia. Our paper raises various questions linked to understanding this new step in this crisis which is not only epidemiological, but also socio-cultural and political.","Roturier, Samuel",Animals,233,16

BACKGROUND: The rapid diffusion of the SARS-CoV-2 together with the need for isolation for infected patients might be responsible for a suboptimal treatment for SARS-CoV-2 ACS patients. Recently, the group of Sichuan published a protocol for COVID/ACS infected patients that see the thrombolysis as the gold standard of care. METHODS: We enrolled 31 consecutive patients affected by SARS-COV-2 admitted to our emergencies room for suspected ACS. RESULTS: All patients underwent urgent coronary angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) when required except two patients with severe hypoxemia and unstable hemodynamic condition that were conservatively treated. Twenty-one cases presented diffuse ST-segment depression while in the remaining cases anterior and inferior ST-elevation was present in four and six cases, respectively. PCI was performed in all cases expect two that were diagnosed as suspected myocarditis because of the absence of severe coronary disease and three with apical ballooning at ventriculography diagnostic for Tako-Tsubo syndromes. Two patients conservatively treated died. The remaining patients undergoing PCI survived except one that required endotracheal intubation (ETI) and died at Day 6.

BACKGROUND: The rapid diffusion of the SARS-CoV-2 together with the need for isolation for infected patients might be responsible for a suboptimal treatment for SARS-CoV-2 ACS patients. Recently, the group of Sichuan published a protocol for COVID/ACS infected patients that see the thrombolysis as the gold standard of care. METHODS: We enrolled 31 consecutive patients affected by SARS-COV-2 admitted to our emergencies room for suspected ACS. RESULTS: All patients underwent urgent coronary angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) when required except two patients with severe hypoxemia and unstable hemodynamic condition that were conservatively treated. Twenty-one cases presented diffuse ST-segment depression while in the remaining cases anterior and inferior ST-elevation was present in four and six cases, respectively. PCI was performed in all cases expect two that were diagnosed as suspected myocarditis because of the absence of severe coronary disease and three with apical ballooning at ventriculography diagnostic for Tako-Tsubo syndromes. Two patients conservatively treated died. The remaining patients undergoing PCI survived except one that required endotracheal intubation (ETI) and died at Day 6. ETI was required in five more patients while in the remaining cases CPAP was used for respiratory support.

The most fatal complication of SSc is scleroderma renal crisis (SRC), the incidence of which is 2-3%. SRC usually occurs in the first 5 years from disease onset in diffuse-SSc patients with anti-topoisomerase 1 (ATA) or RNA polymerase 3 antibodies [1]. Other risk factors for SRC are pericardial effusion, tendon friction rub and steroid use. We report herein a case of scleroderma renal crisis (SRC), following covid-19 infection, in a limited-SSc patient who was in long remission prior to the infection without any risk factors for SRC. the temporal relationship and lack of other risk factors combine to suggest covid-19 infection as a possible trigger for SRC. We discuss the shared pathophysiology of covid-19 infection and SRC, including, vasculopathy, endothelial activation, hypercoagulability, cytokines release as interleukin 6, that may explain the possible role of covid-19 infection, as a trigger for SRC in SSc patients.","Rimar, D.; Rosner, I.; Slobodin, G.",Journal of Scleroderma and Related Disorders,233,20

Here we consider a structure to be tantamount to the noncrossing Watson-Crick and \pairGU-base pairings (secondary structure) and additional cross-serial base pairs. These interactions are called pseudoknots and are observed across the whole spectrum of RNA functionalities. In the context of studying natural RNA structures, searching for new ribozymes and designing artificial RNA, it is of interest to find RNA sequences folding into a specific structure and to analyze their induced neutral networks. Since the established inverse folding algorithms, {\tt RNAinverse}, {\tt RNA-SSD} as well as {\tt INFO-RNA} are limited to RNA secondary structures, we present in this paper the inverse folding algorithm {\tt Inv} which can deal with 3-noncrossing, canonical pseudoknot structures. Results: In this paper we present the inverse folding algorithm {\tt Inv}. We give a detailed analysis of {\tt Inv}, including pseudocodes. We show that {\tt Inv} allows to design in particular 3-noncrossing nonplanar RNA pseudoknot 3-noncrossing RNA structures--a class which is difficult to construct via dynamic programming routines. {\tt Inv} is freely available at \url{http://www.combinatorics.cn/cbpc/inv.html}. Conclusions: The algorithm {\tt Inv} extends inverse folding capabilities to RNA pseudoknot structures. In comparison with {\tt RNAinverse} it uses new ideas, for instance by considering sets of competing structures. As a result, {\tt Inv} is not only able to find novel sequences even for RNA secondary structures, it does so in the context of competing structures that potentially exhibit cross-serial interactions.","Gao, James Z.M.; Li, Linda Y.M.; Reidys, Christian M.",,233,6

Manufacturer information indicates a specificity of about 95% and there is a growing interest to use these tests area-wide. Therefore, it is necessary to clarify whether AgPOCT can be used safely for ""rule-in"" (detection of positive patients) and for ""rule-out"" (valid negative testing). Two thousand three hundred and seventy-five patients received polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing and AgPOCT for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) regardless of symptoms. The positive predictive value of symptomatic and asymptomatic patients was compared with a cut-off threshold cycle (C t ) value of &#8804;30 and in total. Five hundrded and fifty-one patients tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus by PCR, of whom 35.2% presented without symptoms. In all patients, regardless of their symptoms or C t values, a sensitivity of 68.9% and a specificity of 99.6% were calculated for AgPOCT. In patients with C t values &#8804;30, a sensitivity of 80.5% (95% confidence interval: ±1.62) and a specificity of 99.6% were shown for all tests (symptomatic/asymptomatic). Highly infectious patients (C t &#8804; 20), regardless of symptoms, were reliably detected by the AgPOCT. In infectious patients with C t values &#8804;30, the test has a sensitivity of about 80% regardless of COVID-19 typical symptoms, which is apparently less than the 96.52% specificity indicated by the manufacturer. Relevant improvement in test sensitivity by querying the patients who are symptomatic and asymptomatic is also not feasible. We strongly suggest that we critically question the use of AgPOCT for ""rule-out,"" as they only provide a supposed safety.","Holzner, Carola; Pabst, Dirk; Anastasiou, Olympia Evdoxia; Dittmer, Ulf; Manegold, Randi Katrin; Risse, Joachim; Fistera, David; Kill, Clemens; Falk, Maximilian",J Med Virol,233,1

Methods From 12.2017 to 12.2020 we performed 191 single operator cholangiopancreatoscopies (SOC) in 188 patients(m-83, f-108;ranged 25-89 years;average age 57.2±32 years) using SpyGlass (Boston Scientific) in 4 leading Russianhospitals. All patient and cholangiopancreatoscopy data were recorded in the national registry. There were 164cholangioscopies and 27 pancreatoscopies. The indications for cholangioscopy were: undifferentiated strictures (97/188-51.6 %), large stones (42/188-22.3 %), “difficult strictures”, when it was impossible guidewire installation with traditionalway (15/188-8 %), postoperative benign strictures with ligatures and clips (11/188-5.8 %);for pancreaticoscopy-undifferentiated pancreatic strictures (13/188-6.9 %), morphologic verification of IPMN (3/188-1.6 %), large virsungolites(8/188-4.2 %) and assessment of the spread of major papilla adenoma on pancreatic duct (2/188-1.1 %). Results The overall technical success of SOCs was 96.3 % (184/191). Intraductal biopsy was successful in 85/87-97.7 %cases. Cholangiocarcinoma was obtained in 52(61.2 %) cases, benign strictures-in others. Therapeutic interventions weresuccessful in 64/70-91.4 % cases (laser lithotripsy of bile duct stones-14/15, electrohydraulic lithotripsy of bile ductstones-14/15 and of pancreatic duct stones-4/7, guidewire placement under visual control and further stenting-22/22,removal of ligatures(7) and clips(4) of bile duct-11/11). We had 7(3.8 %) complications-acute pancreatitis(3),bleeding(1) and cholangitis(3). Lethal outcomes after retrograde interventions not directly related to the SOC itself occurredin 2(1.1 %) patients at 5(ongoing pancreatic necrosis) and 3 day(multiple organ failure associated with COVID-19) afterERCP. Conclusions The opportunity of widespread use of SOC system in daily work for direct endoscopic examination of ductalsystems and performing invasive interventions under direct visual control provides new opportunities for increasing thelevel of diagnosis and the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions up to 96.3 %, without increasing the number of side effects during retrograde interventions.","Fedorov, E.

COVID-19 is not a nudge; it is a tidal wave. Engaging with and understanding complexity science allows us to examine the internal rules of our health care system and recognize our own role as agents that can systematically and deliberately disrupt the status quo. The intertwined and interdependent complex relationships that exist in health care between persons, business, academia, and government buffer the system from rapid and drastic change. COVID-19, however, swiftly disrupted many of the rules keeping the system in its previous state. Some would describe this sudden and dramatic systems change as a Black Swan. This column will examine the role of the Black Swan, as it relates to this pandemic. The Black Swan is a term coined in the 2nd century by Roman poet Juvenal's description of something being rara avis in terries nigroque simillima cygno, Latin for ""a bird as rare as the black swan"" (Taleb, 2007, p. xxxi). At this time, reference to a black swan was meant as a statement of impossibility, because all historical records of swans had been white. In 1697, Dutch explorers discovered black swans living in the wild in Western Australia (Taleb, 2007, p. xxi), and the black swan became a metaphor for events that come as a surprise, have major implications, and can often be understood only with the benefit of hindsight. This theory of the black swan was further articulated by Nassim Nicholas Taleb in his books Fooled by Randomness (Taleb, 2001) and The Black Swan (Taleb, 2007).

Bronchial alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and plasma from mild and severe cases of COVID-19 have been profiled using protein measurements and bulk and single cell RNA sequencing. Onset of pneumonia and ARDS can be rapid in COVID-19, suggesting a potential neuronal involvement in pathology and mortality. We hypothesized that SARS-CoV-2 infection drives changes in immune cell-derived factors that then interact with receptors expressed by the sensory neuronal innervation of the lung to further promote important aspects of disease severity, including ARDS. We sought to quantify how immune cells might interact with sensory innervation of the lung in COVID-19 using published data from patients, existing RNA sequencing datasets from human dorsal root ganglion neurons and other sources, and a genome-wide ligand-receptor pair database curated for pharmacological interactions relevant for neuro-immune interactions.

The GRAVID study aimed to describe clinical characteristics, outcomes, and predictors of poor outcome in patients with lung cancer and COVID-19. METHODS: Prospective observational study that included medical records of patients with lung cancer and PCR-confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis across 65 Spanish hospitals. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality; secondary endpoints were hospitalization and admission to intensive care units (ICU). RESULTS: A total of 447 patients with a mean age of 67.1 ± 9.8 years were analysed. The majority were men (74.3 %) and current/former smokers (85.7 %). NSCLC was the most frequent type of cancer (84.5 %), mainly as adenocarcinoma (51.0 %), and stage III metastatic or unresectable disease (79.2 %). Nearly 60 % of patients were receiving anticancer treatment, mostly first-line chemotherapy. Overall, 350 (78.3 %) patients were hospitalized for a mean of 13.4 ± 11.4 days, 9 (2.0 %) were admitted to ICU and 146 (32.7 %) died.

Those who experience health, social, and/or structural vulnerabilities due to pre-existing mental health conditions, disability, income, ethnicity, sexuality, and/or gender are more likely to endorse mental health deterioration, challenging emotions, and difficulties coping. This monitoring study highlights the differential mental health impacts of the pandemic for those who experience health, social, and structural inequities. These data are critical to informing responsive, equity-oriented public health, and policy responses in real-time to protect and promote the mental health of those most at risk during the pandemic and beyond.","Jenkins, Emily K; McAuliffe, Corey; Hirani, Saima; Richardson, Chris; Thomson, Kimberly C; McGuinness, Liza; Morris, Jonathan; Kousoulis, Antonis; Gadermann, Anne",Prev Med,233,16

Surprisingly, a broad range of symptoms has been reported since COVID-19 emergence. Individual variations in susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 can be due to non-genetic and genetic factors. Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is an inherited condition that is associated with an increased risk of liver and lung diseases which may increase susceptibility to COVID-19 infection. At the same time, there could be a possibility of developing non-hereditary AATD. DISCUSSION: In addition to some evidence showing the role of vitamin D deficiency in COVID-19 pathology, it has been recognized that there is a biological link between AAT and vitamin D. Therefore, here we offer a new perspective that lower vitamin D levels in COVID-19 patients can cause acquired AATD that provide a condition with more disease severity and a higher risk of death. As a consequence, COVID-19 individuals with vitamin D deficiency may have a higher risk of morbidity and mortality. CONCLUSION: Therefore, early vitamin D and AAT assessments and optimal interventions could be helpful to prevent severe COVID-19 outcomes.","Shimi, Ghazaleh; Zand, Hamid",Inflamm Res,233,26

Many viruses can significantly alter host chromatin1, but such roles of SARS-CoV-2 are largely unknown. Here, we characterized the three-dimensional (3D) genome architecture and epigenome landscapes in human cells after SARS-CoV-2 infection, revealing remarkable restructuring of host chromatin architecture. High-resolution Hi-C 3.0 uncovered widespread A compartmental weakening and A-B mixing, together with a global reduction of intra-TAD chromatin contacts. The cohesin complex, a central organizer of the 3D genome, was significantly depleted from intra-TAD regions, supporting that SARS-CoV-2 disrupts cohesin loop extrusion. Calibrated ChIP-Seq verified chromatin restructuring by SARS-CoV-2 that is particularly manifested by a pervasive reduction of euchromatin modifications. Built on the rewired 3D genome/epigenome maps, a modified activity-by-contact model2 highlights the transcriptional weakening of antiviral interferon response genes or virus sensors (e.g., DDX58) incurred by SARS-CoV-2. In contrast, pro-inflammatory genes (e.g. IL-6) high in severe infections were uniquely regulated by augmented H3K4me3 at their promoters. These findings illustrate how SARS-CoV-2 rewires host chromatin architecture to confer immunological gene deregulation, laying a foundation to characterize the long-term epigenomic impacts of this virus.","Wang, Ruoyu; Lee, Joo-Hyung; Xiong, Feng; Kim, Jieun; Hasani, Lana Al; Yuan, Xiaoyi; Shivshankar, Pooja; Krakowiak, Joanna; Qi, Chuangye; Wang, Yangyu; Eltzschig, Holger K; Li, Wenbo",,233,20

Samples were collected from health settings in Curitiba, Brazil, between July and December 2020. A literature review was conducted using PRISMA. A total of 711 environmental surface samples were collected from outpatient areas, dental units, doctors' offices, COVID-19 evaluation areas, and hospital units, of which 35 (4.9%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The frequency of environmental contamination was higher in primary care units than in hospital settings. The virus was detected on doctors' personal items. Remarkably, the previously disinfected dental chair samples tested positive. These findings agree with those of other studies in which SARS-CoV-2 was found on inanimate surfaces. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA on surfaces in public health settings, including those not meant to treat COVID-19, indicates widespread environmental contamination.

Nine people with chronic SCI (six motor complete; three motor incomplete) participated in an 8-week intervention, incorporating three training sessions per week. Participants received either tSCS combined with sit-to-stand training (STIM) or sit-to-stand training alone (NON-STIM). Outcome measures were carried out before and after the intervention. Seven participants completed the intervention (STIM N = 5; NON-STIM N = 2).

Patients without COVID-19 symptoms and isolated musculoskeletal injuries were redirected to the OAU. METHODS: We prospectively reviewed patients throughput during the peak of the global pandemic (7 May 2020 to 7 June 2020) and compared with our historic service provision (7 May 2019 to 7 June 2019). The Mann-Whitney and Fisher Exact tests were used to test the statistical significance of data. RESULTS: A total of 1,147 patients were seen, with peak attendances between 11am and 2pm; 96% of all referrals were seen within 4h. The majority of patients were seen by orthopaedic registrars (52%) and nurse practitioners (44%). The majority of patients suffered from sprains and strains (39%), followed by fractures (22%) and wounds (20%); 73% of patients were discharged on the same day, 15% given follow up, 8% underwent surgery and 3% were admitted but did not undergo surgery. Our volume of trauma admissions and theatre cases decreased by 22% and 17%, respectively (p=0.058; 0.139). There was a significant reduction of virtual fracture clinic referrals after reconfiguration of services (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Rapid implementation of a specialist OAU during a pandemic can provide early definitive trauma care while exceeding national waiting time standards. The fall in trauma attendances was lower than anticipated. The retention of orthopaedic staff in the department to staff the unit and maintain a high standard of care is imperative.","Lim, J W; Rehman, H; Gaba, S; Sargeant, H; Stevenson, I M; Boddie, D E",Ann R Coll Surg Engl,233,22

However, there is limited information on the characteristics and use patterns of these tools in practice. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study are to describe the characteristics of people who use digital health tools to address COVID-19-related concerns; explore their self-reported symptoms and characterize the association of these symptoms with COVID-19; and characterize the recommendations provided by digital health tools. METHODS: This study used data from three digital health tools on the K Health app: a protocol-based COVID-19 self-assessment, an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven symptom checker, and communication with remote physicians. Deidentified data were extracted on the demographic and clinical characteristics of adults seeking COVID-19-related health information between April 8 and June 20, 2020. Analyses included exploring features associated with COVID-19 positivity and features associated with the choice to communicate with a remote physician. RESULTS: During the period assessed, 71,619 individuals completed the COVID-19 self-assessment, 41,425 also used the AI-driven symptom checker, and 2523 consulted with remote physicians. Individuals who used the COVID-19 self-assessment were predominantly female (51,845/71,619, 72.4%), with a mean age of 34.5 years (SD 13.9). Testing for COVID-19 was reported by 2901 users, of whom 433 (14.9%) reported testing positive. Users who tested positive for COVID-19 were more likely to have reported loss of smell or taste (relative rate [RR] 6.66, 95% CI 5.53-7.94) and other established COVID-19 symptoms as well as ocular symptoms. Users communicating with a remote physician were more likely to have been recommended by the self-assessment to undergo immediate medical evaluation due to the presence of severe symptoms (RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.02-1.32). Most consultations with remote physicians (1940/2523, 76.9%) were resolved without need for referral to an in-person visit or to the emergency department.

In this review, we discuss the most updated evidence on the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of the coagulopathy of COVID-19. Prophylactic anticoagulation is recommended for all in-patients with COVID-19. Those with a higher risk of developing thromboembolic events or who have already developed venous thromboembolism should be treated with therapeutic anticoagulation.

METHODS: We obtained and analyzed anonymized data on psychiatric admissions (n = 4550) from 12 general hospital psychiatric wards (GHPWs) in different Italian regions (catchment area = 3.71 millions of inhabitants). Using a mixed-effects Poisson regression model, we compared admission characteristics across three periods: (a) March 1-June 30, 2018 and 2019; (b) March 1-April 30, 2020 (i.e., lockdown); and (c) May 1-June 30, 2020 (i.e., post-lockdown). RESULTS: During the COVID-19 lockdown, there was a 41% reduction (IRR = 0.59; p < 0.001, CI: 0.45-0.79) in psychiatric admissions in the enrolled GHPWs with respect to the 2018 and 2019 control period. Conversely, admission rates in the post-lockdown period were similar to those observed in the control period. Notably, a consistent and significant reduction in psychiatric hospitalizations of older patients (aged >65 years) was observed in the lockdown (40%; IRR = 0.60; 95% CI: 0.44-0.82) and post-lockdown (28%; IRR = 0.72; 95% CI: 0.54-0.96) periods. Long-stay admissions (>14 days) increased (63%; IRR = 1.63; 95% CI: 1.32-2.02) during the lockdown and decreased by 39% thereafter (IRR = 0.61; 95% CI: 0.49-0.75). A significant 35% increase in patients reporting suicidal ideation was observed in the post-lockdown period, compared to the rate observed in the 2018 and 2019 control period (IRR = 1.35; 95% CI: 1.01-1.79). CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 lockdown was associated with changes in the number of psychiatric admissions, particularly for older patients and long-stay hospitalizations. Increased admission of patients reporting suicidal ideation in the post-lockdown period merits special attention. Further studies are required to gain insight into the observed phenomena.","Boldrini, Tommaso; Girardi, Paolo; Clerici, Massimo; Conca, Andreas; Creati, Chiara; Di Cicilia, Giuseppe; Ducci, Giuseppe; Durbano, Federico; Maci, Carlo; Maone, Antonio; Nicolò, Giuseppe; Oasi, Osmano; Percudani, Mauro; Polselli, Gian Marco; Pompili, Maurizio; Rossi, Alessandro; Salcuni, Silvia; Tarallo, Federica; Vita, Antonio; Lingiardi, Vittorio",Prog Neuropsychopharmacol Biol Psychiatry,233,16

Limb and digit ischemia have been associated with COVID-19 infection. This systematic review includes primary studies of COVID-19 limb ischemia to identify risk factors, comorbidities, case characteristics, and treatment strategies to better understand the nature of this disease and its effects on the extremities. Methods: A literature search for studies detailing COVID-19 infected patients with limb or digit ischemia was performed, identifying 157 articles, 12 of which met inclusion criteria, accounting for 47 patients. Inclusion criteria were (1) primary studies, (2) positive disease diagnosis (3) limb ischemia, (4) reported treatment. Demographic data, case characteristics, treatments, outcomes and mortality were collected and pooled. Results: The average patient age was 67.6 years, predominantly male (79.6%). Of the 44 cases discussing treatment, 13 (30%) patients underwent medical treatment alone, while 23 (52.3%) patients underwent medical plus surgical treatment. Four patients (9.1%) were treated with observation. In 10 of the 12 studies, lab findings, thrombosis, or conclusions supporting a hypercoagulable state as a cause of limb/digit ischemia were cited. Five patients (10.6%) were on vasopressors and 8 patients (17.0%) were on a ventilator. Of those treated with observation alone, there was 100% resolution of symptoms. Of those treated medically without surgical intervention (17 patients), 6 patients (35.3%) were reported to have revascularization, 6 patients (35.3%) died, and the remaining outcomes were not reported. Medical and surgical treatment resulted in one limb amputation (4.4%) and altogether 74% of patients achieved revascularization of the affected limb/digit. Mortality rate was 45%. Conclusions: COVID-19 infection may be associated with increased risk of limb or digital ischemia, although the quality of evidence supporting this theory is limited. Evidence of inflammatory-mediated thrombosis and endothelial injury are possible explanations which would support the use of immunotherapy in addition to anticoagulation for treatment or prevention of thromboembolic events.

The causative agent of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread worldwide, resulting in a pandemic of unprecedented magnitude. To date, several clinically safe and efficient vaccines (e.g., Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson, and AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccines) as well as drugs for emergency use have been approved. However, increasing numbers of SARS-Cov-2 variants make it imminent to identify an alternative way to treat SARS-CoV-2 infections. A well-known strategy to identify molecules with inhibitory potential against SARS-CoV-2 proteins is repurposing clinically developed drugs, e.g., antiparasitic drugs. The results described in this study demonstrated the inhibitory potential of quinacrine and suramin against SARS-CoV-2 main protease (3CLpro). Quinacrine and suramin molecules presented a competitive and noncompetitive inhibition mode, respectively, with IC50 values in the low micromolar range. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments demonstrated that quinacrine and suramin alone possessed a moderate or weak affinity with SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro but suramin binding increased quinacrine interaction by around a factor of eight. Using docking and molecular dynamics simulations, we identified a possible binding mode and the amino acids involved in these interactions. Our results suggested that suramin, in combination with quinacrine, showed promising synergistic efficacy to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro. We suppose that the identification of effective, synergistic drug combinations could lead to the design of better treatments for the COVID-19 disease and repurposable drug candidates offer fast therapeutic breakthroughs, mainly in a pandemic moment.","Eberle, Raphael J; Olivier, Danilo S; Amaral, Marcos S; Gering, Ian; Willbold, Dieter; Arni, Raghuvir K; Coronado, Monika A",Viruses,233,25

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate maternal and perinatal outcomes in high- and low-risk pregnancies complicated by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. STUDY DESIGN: This was a multinational retrospective cohort study involving women with laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection from 76 centers from 25 countries in Europe, the United States, South America, Asia, and Australia from April 4, 2020, to October 28, 2020. The primary outcome was a composite measure of maternal mortality and morbidity, including admission to the intensive care unit, use of mechanical ventilation, or death. The secondary outcome was a composite measure of adverse perinatal outcome, including miscarriage, fetal loss, neonatal and perinatal death, and admission to the neonatal intensive care unit. All outcomes were assessed in high- and low-risk pregnancies. Pregnancies were considered high risk in case of either preexisting chronic medical conditions in pregnancy or obstetrical disorders occurring in pregnancy. The Fisher exact test and logistic regression analysis were used to analyze the data. RESULTS: A total of 887 singleton pregnancies who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction of nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens were included in the study. The risk of composite adverse maternal outcomes was higher in high-risk pregnancies than in low-risk pregnancies (odds ratio, 1.52; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-2.24; P=.035). In addition, women carrying high-risk pregnancies were at higher risk of hospital admission (odds ratio, 1.48; 95% confidence interval, 1.07-2.04; P=.002), presence of severe respiratory symptoms (odds ratio, 2.13; 95% confidence interval, 0.41-3.21; P=.001), admission to the intensive care unit (odds ratio, 2.63; 95% confidence interval, 1.42-4.88), and invasive mechanical ventilation (odds ratio, 2.65; 95% confidence interval, 1.19-5.94; P=.002). When exploring perinatal outcomes, high-risk pregnancies were at high risk of adverse perinatal outcomes (odds ratio, 1.78; 95% confidence interval, 0.15-2.72; P=.009). However, such association was mainly because of the higher incidence of miscarriage in high-risk pregnancies compared with that in low-risk pregnancies (5.3% vs 1.6%, P=.008); furthermore, there was no difference in other explored outcomes between the 2 study groups. At logistic regression analysis, maternal age (odds ratio, 1.12; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-1.22; P=.023) and high-risk pregnancy (odds ratio, 4.21; 95% confidence interval, 3.90-5.11; P<.001) were independently associated with adverse maternal outcomes.

Here, a collective ensemble of multimicrosecond molecular dynamics characterizes the key dynamic determinants allowing nucleic acid processing in CRISPR-Cas12a. We show that DNA binding induces a switch in the conformational dynamics of Cas12a, which results in the activation of the peripheral REC2 and Nuc domains to enable cleavage of nucleic acids. The simulations reveal that large-amplitude motions of the Nuc domain could favor the conformational activation of the system toward DNA cleavages. In this process, the REC lobe plays a critical role. Accordingly, the joint dynamics of REC and Nuc shows the tendency to prime the conformational transition of the DNA target strand toward the catalytic site. Most notably, the highly coupled dynamics of the REC2 region and Nuc domain suggests that REC2 could act as a regulator of the Nuc function, similar to what was observed previously for the HNH domain in the CRISPR-associated nuclease Cas9. These mutual domain dynamics could be critical for the nonspecific binding of DNA and thereby for the underlying mechanistic functioning of the DETECTR technology. Considering that REC is a key determinant in the system's specificity, our findings provide a rational basis for future biophysical studies aimed at characterizing its function in CRISPR-Cas12a. Overall, our outcomes advance our mechanistic understanding of CRISPR-Cas12a and provide grounds for novel engineering efforts to improve genome editing and viral detection.","Saha, Aakash; Arantes, Pablo R; Hsu, Rohaine V; Narkhede, Yogesh B; Jinek, Martin; Palermo, Giulia",J Chem Inf Model,233,16

We found that SARS-CoV-2 isolates replicated in the respiratory tracts of 12-month-old (aged) mice and caused pathological features of pneumonia upon intranasal infection. In contrast, rapid viral clearance was observed 5 days following infection in 2-month-old (young) mice with no evidence of pathological changes in the lungs. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 elicited significantly upregulated production of cytokines, especially interleukin 6 and interferon gamma, in aged mice; whereas this response was much weaker in young mice. Subsequent challenge of infected aged BALB/c mice with SARS-CoV-2 resulted in neutralized antibody responses, a significantly reduced viral burden in the lungs, and inflammation mitigation. Deep sequencing showed a panel of mutations potentially associated with the enhanced infection in aged BALB/c mice, such as the Q498H mutations which are located at the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike (S) protein. We further found that the isolates can not only multiply in the respiratory tract of mice but also cause disease in aged mice. Overall, viral replication and rapid adaption in aged BALB/c mice were associated with pneumonia, confirming that the age-related susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 in mice resembled that in humans.ImportanceAged BALB/c model are in use as a model of disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. Our research demonstrated SARS-CoV-2 can rapidly adapt in aged BALB/c mice through causing mutations at the RBD of the S protein. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2-infected aged BALB/c mice indicated that alveolar damage, interstitial pneumonia, and inflammatory immune responses were similar to the clinical manifestations of human infections.

Fortunately, for SARS-CoV-2, the genome sequence and protein structure have been published in a short period, making research and development for prevention and treatment relatively easy. In addition, intranasal drug delivery has proven to be an effective method of administration for treating viral lung diseases. In recent years, nanotechnology-based drug delivery systems have been applied to intranasal drug delivery to overcome various limitations that occur during mucosal administration, and advances have been made to the stage where effective drug delivery is possible. This review describes the accumulated knowledge of the previous SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections and aims to help understand the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, it elucidates the achievements in developing COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics to date through existing approaches. Finally, the applicable nanotechnology approach is described in detail, and vaccines and therapeutic drugs developed based on nanomedicine, which are currently undergoing clinical trials, have presented the potential to become innovative alternatives for overcoming COVID-19.","Yang, Dongki",Int J Nanomedicine,233,1

Lightweight portable oxygen concentrators (POCs) are a valid alternative to traditional systems such as portable compressed oxygen cylinders. However, patient preference and the possible psychological implications related to the use of both devices have been poorly assessed. We sought to evaluate patient preference between the ambulatory oxygen systems (ie, a POC or a small cylinder) for patients with COPD and interstitial lung disease experiencing exertional desaturation in a rehabilitation setting. Furthermore, the use of one device in comparison with the other was related to specific mechanical characteristics and related to perceived quality of life, anxiety, and depressive symptoms. METHODS: 30 subjects with COPD and interstitial lung disease, who demonstrated exertional desaturation on room air during 6-min walk test (6MWT), were recruited. Each subject performed 2 6MWTs, in random order: one breathing oxygen via a POC and one with a portable compressed oxygen cylinder. Both devices were set up to ensure oxyhemoglobin saturation between 92% and 95% during the 6MWTs. All subjects completed a questionnaire assessing anxiety, depression, and quality of life. Each device was randomly assigned to each subject for 1 week, and then replaced with the other in the following week. At the end of the trial period, all subjects completed a questionnaire evaluating several aspects of the oxygen therapy devices. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in oxygen saturation or the mean distances achieved during the 6MWTs between the 2 portable oxygen devices. The subjects expressed greater preference for the POC (73.3%), basing their choice mainly on ease of transport and lower weight. Subjects' age also correlated with preferences: younger subjects were more negatively focused on the weight of the portable compressed oxygen cylinder, whereas older subjects considered the POC easier to manage. No significant differences in preferences were present between COPD and interstitial lung disease. CONCLUSIONS: The POC and the portable compressed oxygen cylinder performed in a comparable manner during 6MWT for subjects with COPD and interstitial lung disease and exertional desaturation. Subjects preferred the POC because it was associated with better mobility.","Moretta, Pasquale; Molino, Antonio; Martucci, Michele; Fuschillo, Salvatore; De Felice, Alberto; Guida, Pietro; Motta, Andrea; Vitacca, Michele; Maniscalco, Mauro",Respir. care,233,1

METHODS: Two months before the first case of the COVID-19 in Serbia, we obtained the Serbian Version of Quality of Life Inventory for Epilepsy 31 (SVQOLIE-31) and Neurological Disorders Depression Inventory for Epilepsy scores (SVNDDI-E) for another study. We retested the same patients one year after in COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to SVQOLIE-31, and SVNDDI-E we used a generic questionnaire compiled from items related to the COVID-19. RESULTS: We retested 97 out of 118 patients (82.2%) for the follow-up analysis. The average age was 36.1â¯±â¯12.2 (range: 18-69), and 49 were women (50.5%). The median duration of epilepsy was 13â¯years (range: 1.5-48). The structural etiology of epilepsy was noted in 41 (42.3%), unknown etiology in 41 (42.3%), and genetic etiology in 15 (15.4%) patients. Fewer patients (27.8%) experienced at least one seizure three months before follow-up testing when compared to patients who experienced at least one seizure three months in initial testing (36.0%) (pâ¯=â¯0.15). All patients reported full compliance with anti-seizure medication in the follow-up. The SVQOLIE-31 score during the COVID-19 pandemic visit (64.5â¯±â¯14.6) was significantly lower than the SVQOLIE-31 score before the pandemic (pâ¯<â¯0.001). The SVNDDI-E score during the COVID-19 pandemic (10.5â¯±â¯3.5) was significantly higher than the SVNDDI-E score before it (pâ¯<â¯0.001). Multiple linear regression analyses revealed fear of seizures, and fear of a reduction in household income, significantly associated with SVQOLIE-31 and SVNDDI-E overall score. These variables accounted for 66% and 27% of the variance of SVQOLIE-31 and SVNDDI-E overall score. SIGNIFICANCE: Lower quality of life, higher prevalence of depression, healthcare availability issues, and perceived fears during pandemic all suggest COVID-19 has negatively impacted lives of patients with epilepsy.","Strizovic, Selena; Vojvodic, Nikola; Kovacevic, Masa; Pejovic, Aleksa; Bukumiric, Zoran; Sokic, Dragoslav; Ristic, Aleksandar J",Epilepsy Behav,233,10

Social distancing, face masks and other rules have reshaped our way of living during the last year. The impact of these measures for indoor establishments, such as education or hostelry businesses, resulted in a considerable organisation problem. Achieving a table distribution inside these indoor spaces that fulfilled the distancing requirements while trying to allocate the maximum number of tables for enduring the pandemic has proved to be a considerable task for multiple establishments. This problem, defined as the Table Location Problem (TLP), is categorised as NP-Hard, thus a metaheuristic resolution is recommended. In our previous works, a Genetic Algorithm (GA) optimisation was proposed for optimising the table distribution in real classrooms. However, the proposed algorithm performed poorly for high obstacle density scenarios, especially when allocating a considerable number of tables due to the existing dependency between adjacent tables in the distance distribution. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce for the first time, to the authors’ best knowledge, a Memetic Algorithm (MA) optimisation that improves the previously designed GA through the introduction of a Gradient Based Local Search. Multiple configurations have been analysed for a real hostelry-related scenario and a comparison between methodologies has been performed. Results show that the proposed MA optimisation obtained adequate solutions that the GA was unable to reach, demonstrating a superior convergence performance and an overall greater flexibility. The MA performance denoted its value not only from a COVID-19 distancing perspective but also as a flexible managing algorithm for daily table arrangement, thus fulfilling the main objectives of this paper.","Ferrero-Guillén, Rubén Díez-González Javier Martínez-Guitiérrez Alberto Álvarez Rubén",Applied Sciences,233,20

This study was designed to determine event-free survival (EFS) for adolescents with GCTs and compared them with children and young adults. METHODS: An individual patient database of 11 GCT trials was assembled: 8 conducted by pediatric cooperative groups and 3 conducted by an adult group. Male patients aged 0 to 30 years with metastatic, nonseminomatous, malignant GCTs of the testis, retroperitoneum, or mediastinum who were treated with platinum-based chemotherapy were included. The age groups were categorized as children (0 to <11 years), adolescents (11 to <18 years), and young adults (18 to &#8804;30 years). The study compared EFS and adjusted for risk group by using Cox proportional hazards analysis. RESULTS: From a total of 2024 individual records, 593 patients met the inclusion criteria: 90 were children, 109 were adolescents, and 394 were young adults. The 5-year EFS rate was lower for adolescents (72%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 62%-79%) than children (90%; 95% CI, 81%-95%; P = .003) or young adults (88%; 95% CI, 84%-91%; P = .0002). The International Germ Cell Cancer Collaborative Group risk group was associated with EFS in the adolescent age group (P = .0020). After adjustments for risk group, the difference in EFS between adolescents and children remained significant (hazard ratio, 0.30; P = .001). CONCLUSIONS: EFS for adolescent patients with metastatic GCTs was similar to that for young adults but significantly worse than for that children. This finding highlights the importance of coordinating initiatives across clinical trial organizations to improve outcomes for adolescents and young adults. LAY SUMMARY: Adolescent males with metastatic germ cell tumors (GCTs) are frequently treated with regimens developed for children. In this study, a large data set of male patients with metastatic GCTs across different age groups has been built to understand the outcomes of adolescent patients in comparison with children and young adults. The results suggest that adolescent males with metastatic GCTs have worse results than children and are more similar to young adults with GCTs. Therefore, the treatment of adolescents with GCTs should resemble therapeutic approaches for young adults.","Shaikh, Furqan; Stark, Daniel; Fonseca, Adriana; Dang, Ha; Xia, Caihong; Krailo, Mark; Pashankar, Farzana; Rodriguez-Galindo, Carlos; Olson, Thomas A; Nicholson, James C; Murray, Matthew J; Amatruda, James F; Billmire, Deborah; Stoneham, Sara; Frazier, A Lindsay",Cancer,233,27

In late March 2020, the aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt arrived at port in Guam after numerous U.S. service members onboard developed COVID-19. In April, the U.S. Navy and CDC investigated this outbreak, and the demographic, epidemiologic, and laboratory findings among a convenience sample of 382 service members serving aboard the aircraft carrier are reported in this study. The outbreak was characterized by widespread transmission with relatively mild symptoms and asymptomatic infection among this sample of mostly young, healthy adults with close, congregate exposures. Service members who reported taking preventive measures had a lower infection rate than did those who did not report taking these measures (e.g., wearing a face covering, 55.8% versus 80.8%; avoiding common areas, 53.8% versus 67.5%; and observing social distancing, 54.7% versus 70.0%, respectively). The presence of neutralizing antibodies, which represent antibodies that inhibit SARS-CoV-2, among the majority (59.2%) of those with antibody responses is a promising indicator of at least short-term immunity. This report improves the understanding of COVID-19 in the U.S. military and among young adults in congregate settings and reinforces the importance of preventive measures to lower risk for infection in similar environments.","Payne, Daniel C; Smith-Jeffcoat, Sarah E; Nowak, Gosia; Chukwuma, Uzo; Geibe, Jesse R; Hawkins, Robert J; Johnson, Jeffrey A; Thornburg, Natalie J; Schiffer, Jarad; Weiner, Zachary; Bankamp, Bettina; Bowen, Michael D; MacNeil, Adam; Patel, Monita R; Deussing, Eric; Gillingham, Bruce L",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,233,24

In particular, contact tracing mobile apps provide a means for governments to manage both health and economic concerns. However, public reception of these apps is paramount to their success, and global uptake rates have been low. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we sought to identify the characteristics of individuals or factors potentially associated with voluntary downloads of a contact tracing mobile app in Singapore. METHODS: A cohort of 505 adults from the general community completed an online survey. As the primary outcome measure, participants were asked to indicate whether they had downloaded the contact tracing app TraceTogether introduced at the national level. The following were assessed as predictor variables: (1) participant demographics, (2) behavioral modifications on account of the pandemic, and (3) pandemic severity (the number of cases and lockdown status). RESULTS: Within our data set, the strongest predictor of the uptake of TraceTogether was the extent to which individuals had already adjusted their lifestyles because of the pandemic (z=13.56; P<.001). Network analyses revealed that uptake was most related to the following: using hand sanitizers, avoiding public transport, and preferring outdoor over indoor venues during the pandemic. However, demographic and situational characteristics were not significantly associated with app downloads. CONCLUSIONS: Efforts to introduce contact tracing apps could capitalize on pandemic-related behavioral adjustments among individuals. Given that a large number of individuals is required to download contact tracing apps for contact tracing to be effective, further studies are required to understand how citizens respond to contact tracing apps.

In these facilities, viral transmission can be facilitated by shortages of human and material resources, which can lead to suboptimal application of infection prevention and control (IPC) procedures. To improve the dissemination of COVID-19 IPC guidelines, we developed a serious game called ""Escape COVID-19"" using Nicholson's RECIPE for meaningful gamification, as engaging serious games have the potential to induce behavioral change. OBJECTIVE: As the probability of executing an action is strongly linked to the intention of performing it, the objective of this study was to determine whether LTCF employees were willing to change their IPC practices after playing ""Escape COVID-19."" METHODS: This was a web-based, triple-blind, randomized controlled trial, which took place between November 5 and December 4, 2020. The health authorities of Geneva, Switzerland, asked the managers of all LTCFs under their jurisdiction to forward information regarding the study to all their employees, regardless of professional status. Participants were unaware that they would be randomly allocated to one of two different study paths upon registration. In the control group, participants filled in a first questionnaire designed to gather demographic data and assess baseline knowledge before accessing regular online IPC guidelines. They then answered a second questionnaire, which assessed their willingness to change their IPC practices and identified the reasons underlying their decision. They were then granted access to the serious game. Conversely, the serious game group played ""Escape COVID-19"" after answering the first questionnaire but before answering the second one. This group accessed the control material after answering the second set of questions. There was no time limit. The primary outcome was the proportion of LTCF employees willing to change their IPC practices. Secondary outcomes included the factors underlying participants' decisions, the domains these changes would affect, changes in the use of protective equipment items, and attrition at each stage of the study. RESULTS: A total of 295 answer sets were analyzed. Willingness to change behavior was higher in the serious game group (82% [119/145] versus 56% [84/150]; P<.001), with an odds ratio of 3.86 (95% CI 2.18-6.81; P<.001) after adjusting for professional category and baseline knowledge, using a mixed effects logistic regression model with LTCF as a random effect. For more than two-thirds (142/203) of the participants, the feeling of playing an important role against the epidemic was the most important factor explaining their willingness to change behavior. Most of the participants unwilling to change their behavior answered that they were already applying all the guidelines. CONCLUSIONS: The serious game ""Escape COVID-19"" was more successful than standard IPC material in convincing LTCF employees to adopt COVID-19-safe IPC behavior.

Colorimetric sensor array system produced a characteristic color difference map upon its exposure to volatile compounds of rice. Discrimination of rice varieties was subsequently achieved using principal component analysis, hierarchical clustering analysis, and k-nearest neighbors. Rice varieties from same geographical source were clustered together in the scatter plot of principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering analysis dendrogram. The k-nearest neighbors algorithm delivered optimal results with discrimination rate of 100% for both calibration and prediction sets using sensor array system. The smartphone-based colorimetric sensor array system and gas chromatography technique were able to effectively differentiate rice varieties with the advantage of being simple, rapid, and low-cost.","Arslan, Muhammad; Zareef, Muhammad; Tahir, Haroon Elrasheid; Guo, Ziang; Rakha, Allah; Xuetao, Hu; Shi, Jiyong; Zhihua, Li; Xiaobo, Zou; Khan, Moazzam Rafiq",Food Chem,233,16

However, the number of confirmed cases depends on the testing policy, and it is important to understand how the number of positive cases obtained using different testing policies reveals the unknown ground truth. We develop an agent-based simulation framework in Python that can simulate various testing policies as well as interventions such as lockdown based on them. The interaction between the agents can take into account various communities and mobility patterns. A distinguishing feature of our framework is the presence of another 'flu'-like illness with symptoms similar to COVID-19, that allows us to model the noise in selecting the pool of patients to be tested. We instantiate our model for the city of Bengaluru in India, using census data to distribute agents geographically, and traffic flow mobility data to model long-distance interactions and mixing. We use the simulation framework to compare the performance of three testing policies: Random Symptomatic Testing (RST), Contact Tracing (CT), and a new Location-Based Testing policy (LBT). We observe that if a sufficient fraction of symptomatic patients come out for testing, then RST can capture the ground truth quite closely even with very few daily tests. However, CT consistently captures more positive cases. Interestingly, our new LBT, which is operationally less intensive than CT, gives performance that is comparable with CT. In another direction, we compare the efficacy of these three testing policies in enabling lockdown, and observe that CT flattens the ground truth curve maximally, followed closely by LBT, and significantly better than RST.","Gopalan, Aditya; Tyagi, Himanshu",J Indian Inst Sci,233,16

Gaps in the process result in missed opportunities to prevent COVID-19. Objective: To quantify proportions of cases and their contacts reached by public health authorities and the amount of time needed to reach them and to compare the risk of a positive COVID-19 test result between contacts and the general public during 4-week assessment periods. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study took place at 13 health departments and 1 Indian Health Service Unit in 11 states and 1 tribal nation. Participants included all individuals with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and their named contacts. Local COVID-19 surveillance data were used to determine the numbers of persons reported to have laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who were interviewed and named contacts between June and October 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: For contacts, the numbers who were identified, notified of their exposure, and agreed to monitoring were calculated. The median time from index case specimen collection to contact notification was calculated, as were numbers of named contacts subsequently notified of their exposure and monitored. The prevalence of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test among named and tested contacts was compared with that jurisdiction's general population during the same 4 weeks. Results: The total number of cases reported was 74â¯185. Of these, 43â¯931 (59%) were interviewed, and 24â¯705 (33%) named any contacts. Among the 74â¯839 named contacts, 53â¯314 (71%) were notified of their exposure, and 34â¯345 (46%) agreed to monitoring. A mean of 0.7 contacts were reached by telephone by public health authorities, and only 0.5 contacts per case were monitored. In general, health departments reporting large case counts during the assessment (&#8805;5000) conducted smaller proportions of case interviews and contact notifications. In 9 locations, the median time from specimen collection to contact notification was 6 days or less. In 6 of 8 locations with population comparison data, positive test prevalence was higher among named contacts than the general population. Conclusions and Relevance: In this cross-sectional study of US local COVID-19 surveillance data, testing named contacts was a high-yield activity for case finding. However, this assessment suggests that contact tracing had suboptimal impact on SARS-CoV-2 transmission, largely because 2 of 3 cases were either not reached for interview or named no contacts when interviewed. These findings are relevant to decisions regarding the allocation of public health resources among the various prevention strategies and for the prioritization of case investigations and contact tracing efforts.","Lash, R Ryan; Moonan, Patrick K; Byers, Brittany L; Bonacci, Robert A; Bonner, Kimberly E; Donahue, Matthew; Donovan, Catherine V; Grome, Heather N; Janssen, Julia M; Magleby, Reed; McLaughlin, Heather P; Miller, James S; Pratt, Caroline Q; Steinberg, Jonathan; Varela, Kate; Anschuetz, Greta L; Cieslak, Paul R; Fialkowski, Veronica; Fleischauer, Aaron T; Goddard, Clay; Johnson, Sara Jo; Morris, Michelle; Moses, Jill; Newman, Allison; Prinzing, Lauren; Sulka, Alana C; Va, Puthiery; Willis, Matthew; Oeltmann, John E",JAMA Netw Open,233,22

This study examined changes in and predictors of adolescent mental health from before to during the COVID-19 pandemic in the Southeastern and Midwestern United States. METHODS: Participants include 238 adolescents (132 males; ages 15-17; 118 with ADHD). Parents and adolescents provided ratings of mental health symptoms shortly before the COVID-19 pandemic and in spring and summer 2020. RESULTS: Adolescents on average experienced an increase in depression, anxiety, sluggish cognitive tempo, inattentive, and oppositional/defiant symptoms from pre-COVID-19 to spring 2020; however, with the exception of inattention, these symptoms decreased from spring to summer 2020. Adolescents with ADHD were more likely than adolescents without ADHD to experience an increase in inattentive, hyperactive/impulsive, and oppositional/defiant symptoms. Adolescents with poorer pre-COVID-19 emotion regulation abilities were at-risk for experiencing increases in all mental health symptoms relative to adolescents with better pre-COVID-19 emotion regulation abilities. Interactive risk based on ADHD status and pre-COVID-19 emotion regulation abilities was found for inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity, such that adolescents with ADHD and poor pre-COVID-19 emotion regulation displayed the highest symptomatology across timepoints. Lower family income related to increases in inattention but higher family income related to increases in oppositional/defiant symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The early observed increases in adolescent mental health symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic do not on average appear to be sustained following the lift of stay-at-home orders, though studies evaluating mental health across longer periods of time are needed. Emotion dysregulation and ADHD increase risk for sustained negative mental health functioning and highlight the need for interventions for these populations during chronic stressors. Results and clinical implications should be considered within the context of our predominately White, middle class sample.","Breaux, Rosanna; Dvorsky, Melissa R; Marsh, Nicholas P; Green, Cathrin D; Cash, Annah R; Shroff, Delshad M; Buchen, Natalie; Langberg, Joshua M; Becker, Stephen P",J. child psychol. psychiatry allied discipl,233,16

However, no studies have been conducted to examine the effect of simulation on nursing students' knowledge and confidence in performing critical care skills in Jordan. Purpose: This study aimed to test the effect of simulation on university nursing students' knowledge and confidence in performing critical care skills for patients with cardiac, respiratory and neurological health problems. Method: A randomized controlled (pre-test-post-test) design was implemented. The experimental group (n=38) attended 9 simulation scenarios, theoretical lectures and clinical training in hospital about cardiac, respiratory and neurological health problems, while the control group (n=38) attended only the theoretical lectures and clinical training in hospital. Knowledge and confidence were measured using knowledge exam and self-confidence scale respectively. Results: A paired t-test indicated that mean knowledge and confidence regarding implementing critical care skills were significantly higher P< 0.001 in the post-test than that in the pre-test, in both the experimental and the control group. However, independent t test revealed that the students in the experimental group scored significantly higher P< 0.001 than control group in both knowledge and confidence regarding performing critical care skills. Conclusion: Theoretical and clinical training is valuable teaching strategies that help enhance knowledge and confidence in applying critical care skills. However, adding simulation has a more significant effect than theoretical and clinical training in improving nursing students' knowledge and confidence in performing critical care nursing skills. Author strongly recommended considering simulation as alternative effective educational approach for clinical training especially during COVID-pandemic.","Issa Tawalbeh, Loai",Int J Afr Nurs Sci,233,24

Generic antiviral drug remdesivir has been found to reduce time to clinical recovery but with insignificant clinical benefits and the antimalarial drug, hydroxychloroquine has been red flagged by USFDA for use as a prophylactic measure due to its cardiotoxicity. There is an acute requirement for a drug candidate that has significant clinical benefit with minimal to no side effects. With restricted access to wet laboratory techniques, an alternative approach is to engage in computational screening of lead molecules that could inhibit SARS-CoV-2 at different stages of its infectious cycle. Several in silico studies on natural derivatives, especially that present in daily refreshments (tea and fruit juices), staple food (black rice, red onions, soy beans etc) and traditional medicines (extracts of herbs, leaves and flowers) have been identified as potential drug candidates that bind efficiently with the key viral proteins. However, oral bioavailability of these nutriments is considerably low due to either poor permeability or loss of structure and function due to digestion in the gastrointestinal tract.

The adequate management of these patients depends on the comprehension of factors such as temporality, clinical presentation and etiology. We hypothesize there is an important temporal relationship between COVID-19 severity and stroke onset. METHODS: a systematic review of the available literature was conducted using Pubmed and Scopus, studies reporting patients with Coronavirus disease 19 and stroke were included. Clinical, sociodemographic and laboratory characteristics of patients were extracted and analyzed. RESULTS: Forty-seven studies and 176 patients were included, with a mean age of 63.1 years (SD= 16 n=122), most of them were males (63.2% n=171). The most frequent etiology was cryptogenic 40.9% n=66), and a mean National Institute of Health Stroke Scale of 14.4 points was found (SD= 8.6 n=73). Large vessel occlusion was reported in 65.9% patients (n=91) and these patients were younger with greater stroke severity. D-dimer, C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, ferritin and lactate dehydrogenase were elevated in most patients with reported findings. Most patients had severe Coronavirus disease 2019. The mean time from onset of respiratory symptoms to stroke was 9 days (SD=9.9), the shortest time was noted in those with mild and moderate disease. CONCLUSIONS: There is a trend between the severity of Coronavirus disease 2019 and time to stroke onset. Also, age and stroke severity were found to be related to the development of large vessel occlusion. Inflammation and hypercoagulability markers are elevated in this disease, we propose to not discard hypercoagulability secondary to severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 as an underlying cause of stroke in these patients.","Valencia-Enciso, Natalia; Ortiz-Pereira, Mónica; Zafra-Sierra, María Paula; Espinel-Gómez, Laura; Bayona, Hernan",J Stroke Cerebrovasc Dis,233,16

She was found to have a significantly elevated D-dimer, prompting imaging that showed thrombi in her right ventricle and aorta. She had rapid clinical deterioration and eventually required tissue plasminogen activator with subsequent durable clinical improvement. This case highlights a rare co-occurrence of venous and arterial thrombi in a patient with severe COVID-19. Further studies are needed to clarify the molecular mechanism of COVID-19 coagulopathy, the utility of D-dimer to predict and stratify risk of thrombosis in COVID-19, and the use of fibrinolytic therapy in patients with COVID-19.","Afari, Henrietta; Tefera, Leben; Rosovsky, Rachel P",BMJ case reports,233,16

At the time of our project, local and national recommendations for PPE were based on supply rather than provider or patient safety, and we intended to give providers a better option than scarves and cloth masks. Our objective was to utilize in-house 3D-printing capabilities to make 3D-printed face masks for our orthopaedic trauma providers that use filters that were verified to be nearly equivalent to the filtration material that is found in N95 masks. To meet this goal, we used open-source face-mask design files from the National Institutes of Health with use of an Ultimaker S3 desktop printer. We printed 50 reusable face masks with replaceable filter inserts and distributed them to physicians, physician assistants, and residents in a midwestern level-I trauma center.

However, the PRODIGE 7 trial that randomized 265 colon cancer patients to surgery plus HIPEC vs. surgery alone after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) did not confirm benefit. These data were published as an abstract and not as a peer-reviewed manuscript. One concern is that prior drug exposure may select for drug resistance and blunt HIPEC efficacy. METHODS: A database query identified colon cancer specimens evaluated for chemotherapy sensitivity by ex-vivo analysis of programmed cell death (EVA/PCD), a primary culture platform that examines drug-induced cell death (apoptotic & non-apoptotic) by morphologic, metabolic and histologic endpoints. RESULTS: Of 87 fresh colon cancer specimens, 54 (62%) were untreated and 33 (38%) had received prior folinic acid, 5-fluorouracil, oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) or capecitabine and oxaliplatin (CAPOX). In an apoptosis assay, the lethal concentration of 50% (LC50) in untreated patients was significantly lower than in patients treated by FOLFOX (p = 0.002). Then to approximate PRODIGE 7, treated patients were separated by having received oxaliplatin treatment less than or greater than 2 months before EVA/PCD analysis. The degree of resistance increasing significantly for patients who received treatment less than 2 months prior to EVA/PCD (p < 0.002). Activity for mitomycin and irinotecan was not significantly different for untreated vs. treated patients, but 5-FU was more resistant (P = 0.048). CONCLUSIONS: The failure of PRODIGE 7 to improve survival with surgery plus HIPEC following NACT may reflect diminished oxaliplatin cytotoxicity in patients whose residual disease has been selected for oxaliplatin and 5-FU resistance.","Nagourney, Robert A; Evans, Steven; Tran, Peter H; Nagourney, Adam J; Sugarbaker, Paul H",Eur. j. surg. oncol,233,16

To date, it has spread to more than 200 countries and has been declared a global pandemic. For appropriate preparedness, containment, and mitigation response, the stakeholders and policymakers require prior guidance on the propagation of SARS-CoV2. METHODOLOGY: This study aims to provide such guidance by forecasting the cumulative COVID-19 cases up to 4 weeks ahead for 187 countries, using four data-driven methodologies; autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), exponential smoothing model (ETS), and random walk forecasts (RWF) with and without drift. For these forecasts, we evaluate the accuracy and systematic errors using the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE), respectively. FINDINGS: The results show that the ARIMA and ETS methods outperform the other two forecasting methods. Additionally, using these forecasts, we generate heat maps to provide a pictorial representation of the countries at risk of having an increase in the cases in the coming 4 weeks of February 2021. CONCLUSION: Due to limited data availability during the ongoing pandemic, less data-hungry short-term forecasting models, like ARIMA and ETS, can help in anticipating the future outbreaks of SARS-CoV2.","Ahmad, Ghufran; Ahmed, Furqan; Rizwan, Muhammad Suhail; Muhammad, Javed; Fatima, Syeda Hira; Ikram, Aamer; Zeeb, Hajo",PLoS One,233,10

Encephalitis is an inflammatory condition of the brain that has been described as a severe neurological complication of COVID-19. Despite a growing number of reported cases, encephalitis related to COVID-19 infection has not been adequately characterized. To address this gap, this systematic review and meta-analysis aims to describe the incidence, clinical course and outcomes of patients who suffer from encephalitis as a complication of COVID-19. METHODS: All studies published between November 1, 2019 and October 24, 2020 that reported on patients who developed encephalitis as a complication of COVID-19 were included. Only cases with radiological and/or biochemical evidence of encephalitis were included. RESULTS: In this study, 610 studies were screened and 23 studies reporting findings from 129,008 patients, including 138 with encephalitis, were included. The average time from diagnosis of COVID-19 to onset of encephalitis is 14.5 days (Range: 10.8-18.2 days). The average incidence of encephalitis as a complication of COVID-19 was 0.215% (95% CI: 0.056% to 0.441%). The average mortality rate of encephalitis in COVID-19 patients was 13.4% (95% CI: 3.8% to 25.9%). These patients also had deranged clinical parameters including raised serum inflammatory markers and CSF pleocytosis. CONCLUSION: Although encephalitis is an uncommon complication of COVID-19, when present, it results in significant morbidity and mortality. Severely-ill COVID-19 patients are at higher risk of suffering from encephalitis as a complication of the infection.","Siow, Isabel; Lee, Keng Siang; Zhang, John J Y; Saffari, Seyed Ehsan; Ng, Adeline",Eur. j. neurol,233,1

This was accompanied by the suspension of the surgical programme. The aim of the survey was to determine the effects of COVID-19 on surgical care in non-university hospitals in Germany. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was based on an anonymous online survey, which was accessible from April 24th to May 10th, 2020 for surgeons of the Konvent der leitenden Krankenhauschirurgen (Convention of leading Hospital Surgeons) in Germany. The analysis comprised of 22.8% (n = 148/649) completed surveys. RESULTS: Communication and cooperation with authorities, hospital administration and other departments were largely considered sufficient. In the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, 28.4% (n = 42/148) of the respondents complained about a short supply of protective equipment available for the hospital staff. 7.4% (n = 11/148) of the participants stated that emergency operations had to be postponed or rescheduled. A decreased quantity of emergency surgical procedures and a decreased number of surgical emergency patients treated in the emergency room was reported in 43.9% (n = 65/148) and 63.5% (n = 94/148), respectively. Consultation and treatment of oncological patients in the outpatient clinic was decreased in 54.1% (n = 80/148) of the surveyed hospitals. To increase the capacity for COVID-19 patients, a reduction of bed and operating room occupancy of 50.8 ± 19.3% and 54.2 ± 19.1% were reported, respectively. Therefore, 90.5% (n = 134/148) of all participants expected a loss of revenue of 28.2 ± 12.9% in 2020. CONCLUSION: The first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on surgical care in Germany. The reduction in the bed and the operating room capacity may have lead to considerable delays in urgent and semi-elective surgical interventions. In addition to the risk of worsening patient care, we anticipate severe financial damage to the clinics in 2020 and beyond. National and supranational planning is urgently needed to ensure the surgical care of patients during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","Stöß, Christian; Steffani, Marcella; Kohlhaw, Kay; Rudroff, Claudia; Staib, Ludger; Hartmann, Daniel; Friess, Helmut; Müller, Michael W",BMC Surg,233,16

Estes sinais foram obtidos em dois diferentes músculos, bíceps femoral e vasto lateral, em duas raças de cães (Labrador Retriever e Golden Retriever), durante a locomoção ao caminhar em velocidade padronizada. A partir destes dados foram realizados dois experimentos para os processamentos. No experimento 1, foi realizada filtragem com Butterworth de segunda ordem passa-banda de 0,8 a 5 Hz no sinal de EMGs e também no sinal do acelerômetro, gerando dados para análise em funções de correlação e assimetria. Como resultado foi verificada a eficácia do emprego dessas funções para determinação de padrões nos sinais analisados, sendo possível a identificação de sinais de cães saudáveis e com displasia coxofemoral. No experimento 2, a filtragem foi realizada com filtro Butterworth de segunda ordem passa-baixa de 6Hz, apenas no sinal de EMGs. Aplicou-se algoritmo para identificação das fases da locomoção, por meio da determinação de um limiar, e foram estabelecidas correlações entre os sinais provenientes de ambos transdutores.

The article provides a critical reflection on the incentives and deterrents to the UGS use of participants while social distancing measures were in place. The results show that in Mexico City: (1) participants' lack of access to UGS has hampered their use, mainly among those of low-income neighborhoods; (2) UGS size did not directly impact participants' UGS use during the pandemic; and (3) women were deterred from accessing UGS due to safety concerns related to the fear of violence. Overall, the results suggest that UGS use has served as a coping mechanism to decrease the effects of stress and isolation caused by the pandemic, increasing users' physical and mental well-being.

Patients have been reported with multi-organ dysfunction along with acute respiratory distress syndrome which implies a critical situation for patients and made them difficult to breathe and survive. Moreover, pathology of COVID-19 is also related to cytokine storm which indicates the elevated levels of interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, IL-12, and IL-18 along with tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α. Among them, the proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 has been reported to be induced via binding of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS)-CoV-2 to the host receptors. Methodology: Interleukin-6 blockade has been proposed to constitute novel therapeutics against COVID-19. Thus, in this study, 15 phytocompounds with known antiviral activity have been subjected to test for their inhibitory effect on IL-6. Based on the affinity prediction, top 3 compounds (isoorientin, lupeol, and andrographolide) with best scores were selected for 50 ns molecular dynamics simulation and MMGB/PBSA binding free energy analysis. Results: Three phytocompounds including isoorientin, lupeol, and andrographolide have shown strong interactions with the targeted protein IL-6 with least binding energies (−7.1 to −7.7 kcal/mol). Drug-likeness and ADMET profiles of prioritized phytocompounds are also very prominsing and can be further tested to be potential IL-6 blockers and thus benficial for COVID-19 treatment. The moelcular dynamics simulation couple with MMGB/PBSA binding free energy estimation validated conformational stability of the ligands and stronger intermolecular binding. The mean RMSD of the complexes is as: IL6-isoorientin complex (3.97 Å ± 0.77), IL6-lupeol (3.97 Å ± 0.76), and IL6-andrographolide complex (3.96 Å ± 0.77). In addition, the stability observation was affirmed by compounds mean RMSD: isoorientin (0.72 Å ± 0.32), lupeol (mean 0.38 Å ± 0.08), and andrographolide (1.09 Å ± 0.49). A similar strong agreement on systems stability was unraveled by MMGB/PBSA that found net binding net ~ −20 kcal/mol for the complexes dominated by van der Waal interaction energy. Conclusion: It has been predicted that proposing potential IL-6 inhibitors with less side effects can help critical COVID-19 patients because it may control the cytokine storm, a major responsible factor of its pathogenesis. In this study, 3 potential phytocompounds have been proposed to have inhibitory effect on IL-6 that can be tested as potential therapeutic options against SARS-CoV-2.

Given the shockingly high rates of infections and deaths in nursing homes, staying in the community appears to be a good option for older adults in this crisis, but in order for some older adults to do so much assistance is required. This situation draws attention to the need for benevolent intervention on the part of the state should older adults become ill or lose their sources of income and support during the crisis. This essay provides a brief overview of public support and the financial and health benefits for older individuals who remain in the community during the pandemic. It reports the case example of Austin, Texas, a city with a rapidly aging and diverse population of almost a million residents, to ask how we can assess the success of municipalities in responding to the changing needs of older adults in the community due to COVID-19. It concludes with a discussion of what governmental and non-governmental leadership can accomplish in situations such as that brought about by the current crisis.","Angel, Jacqueline L; Mudrazija, Stipica",J Aging Soc Policy,233,16

Our objective was to compare treatments, acute care resource utilization, and outcomes of COVID-19 patients presenting to Emergency Departments across two pandemic waves. MethodsThis observational study enrolled consecutive eligible COVID-19 patients presenting to 46 Emergency Departments participating in the Canadian COVID-19 Emergency Department Rapid Response Network (CCEDRRN) between March 1 and December 31, 2020. We collected data by retrospective chart review. Our primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. We used logistic regression modeling to assess the impact of pandemic wave on outcomes. ResultsWe enrolled 9,967 patients in 8 provinces, 3,336 from the first and 6,631 from the second wave. Patients in the second wave were younger, fewer met criteria for severe COVID-19, and more were discharged from the Emergency Department. Adjusted for patient characteristics and disease severity, steroid use increased (odds ratio [OR] 8.0; 95% confidence interval [CI] 6.4 - 10.0), while the use of invasive mechanical ventilation decreased (OR 0.5; 95%CI 0.4 - 0.6) in the second wave. After adjusting for differences in patient characteristics and disease severity, the odds of hospitalization (OR 0.7; 95%CI 0.6 - 0.8) and critical care admission (OR 0.6; 95%CI 0.4 - 0.7) decreased, while mortality remained unchanged (OR 1.0; 95%CI 0.7-1.4).

METHODS: This article is based on an invited lecture by the first author at a conference-the eHealth Summit (""Pediatric Rehabilitation in a Digital Space"")-organized by the other authors and their colleagues in May 2020. RESULTS: The first author offers his own experiences and perspectives, supplemented by comments and observations contributed by many of the 9000+ attendees at this talk, as curated by the second and third authors. The basic messages are that while life for families of children with developmental disabilities, and for service providers who work with them, is significantly altered, many important lessons are being learned. CONCLUSIONS: The comments from participants support the currency of the ideas that were presented, and encourage childhood disability professionals to reflect on what we are learning, so that we can seize the opportunities they afford to do things differently-and we believe better-moving forward. IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION Ideas generated by colleagues and parents suggest that there may be alternatives to ""business as usual"" in childhood disability services after the COVID pandemic is over. People are recognizing opportunities, and benefits, to offering services virtually, including being able to see children in their natural environments, saving parents time, money and hassles to attend clinics in person, and perhaps increasing the availability of services. Many issues remain to be investigated systematically, including, among others, what services (assessments and interventions) require hands-on connections, what payment structures can accommodate new models of services, how professionals can work together in a virtual world, and what families will want. Regardless of the final answers to these issues, we believe that we should not simply ""go back to normal""; rather, we should expand the range, nature and locations of our services for children with developmental disabilities and their families.","Rosenbaum, Peter L; Silva, Mindy; Camden, Chantal",Disabil Rehabil,233,25

Cardiac iron dysregulation has been recently implicated in cardiomyopathy. Here we investigated the protective effects of caloric restriction on cardiac remodeling in impaired leptin signaling obese mice. RNA-seq analysis was performed to assess the differential gene expressions in the heart of wild-type and ob/ob mice. In particular, to investigate the roles of caloric restriction on iron homeostasis-related gene expressions, 10-week-old ob/ob and db/db mice were assigned to ad libitum or calorie-restricted diets for 12 weeks. Male ob/ob mice exhibited LVH, cardiac inflammation, and oxidative stress. Using RNA-seq analysis, we identified that an iron uptake-associated gene, transferrin receptor, was upregulated in obese ob/ob mice with LVH. Caloric restriction attenuated myocyte hypertrophy, cardiac inflammation, fibrosis, and oxidative stress in ob/ob and db/db mice. Furthermore, we found that caloric restriction reversed iron homeostasis-related lipocalin 2, divalent metal transporter 1, transferrin receptor, ferritin, ferroportin, and hepcidin expressions in the heart of ob/ob and db/db mice.

Crystal structures of Nsp15 from different coronaviruses have shown a common hexameric assembly, yet how the enzyme recognizes and processes RNA remains poorly understood. Here we report a series of cryo-EM reconstructions of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp15, in both apo and UTP-bound states. The cryo-EM reconstructions, combined with biochemistry, mass spectrometry, and molecular dynamics, expose molecular details of how critical active site residues recognize uridine and facilitate catalysis of the phosphodiester bond. Mass spectrometry revealed the accumulation of cyclic phosphate cleavage products, while analysis of the apo and UTP-bound datasets revealed conformational dynamics not observed by crystal structures that are likely important to facilitate substrate recognition and regulate nuclease activity. Collectively, these findings advance understanding of how Nsp15 processes viral RNA and provide a structural framework for the development of new therapeutics.","Pillon, Monica C; Frazier, Meredith N; Dillard, Lucas B; Williams, Jason G; Kocaman, Seda; Krahn, Juno M; Perera, Lalith; Hayne, Cassandra K; Gordon, Jacob; Stewart, Zachary D; Sobhany, Mack; Deterding, Leesa J; Hsu, Allen L; Dandey, Venkata P; Borgnia, Mario J; Stanley, Robin E",Nat Commun,233,24

Methods: Up to two issues each of RQES published in 1999, 2009, and 2019 were randomly sampled, and references for articles were verified for accuracy. A total of 1,341 references from 50 articles were verified: 1999 (439 references), 2009 (396 references), and 2019 (506 references). Results: The overall error rate was 40% across the three years (i.e., number of references with at least one error divided by the total number of references and multiplied by 100). Chi-square analyses indicated no significant differences between years for the overall error rate (p > .05): 44% (1999), 38% (2009), and 39% (2019). Chi-square analyses indicated significant differences between years for at least one reference with an error related to author(s) names (p > .05). Chi-square analyses indicated significant differences between years for at least one reference with an error related to the article title. Conclusions: In the author's opinion, an overall error rate of 40% across the three years for RQES is simply too high. Ultimately, it is authors' responsibility to ensure reference accuracy. However, given the unacceptable error rates across fields of study, journals, and publication years, it may be prudent to explore supplemental options to increase reference accuracy in peer-reviewed articles. Reference accuracy is an important issue for authors, editorial offices of journals, and the scientific community.","Logan, Samuel W",Res Q Exerc Sport,233,5

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Clinical data were collected from 981 patients from a multi-institutional international cohort with real-time polymerase chain reaction-confirmed COVID-19. Radiomics features were extracted from chest CT of the patients. The data of the cohort were randomly divided into training, validation, and test sets using a 7:1:2 ratio. A ML pipeline consisting of a model to predict severity and time-to-event model to predict progression to critical illness were trained on radiomics features and clinical variables. The receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (ROC-AUC), concordance index (C-index), and time-dependent ROC-AUC were calculated to determine model performance, which was compared with consensus CT severity scores obtained by visual interpretation by radiologists. RESULTS: Among 981 patients with confirmed COVID-19, 274 patients developed critical illness. Radiomics features and clinical variables resulted in the best performance for the prediction of disease severity with a highest test ROC-AUC of 0.76 compared with 0.70 (0.76 vs. 0.70, p = 0.023) for visual CT severity score and clinical variables. The progression prediction model achieved a test C-index of 0.868 when it was based on the combination of CT radiomics and clinical variables compared with 0.767 when based on CT radiomics features alone (p < 0.001), 0.847 when based on clinical variables alone (p = 0.110), and 0.860 when based on the combination of visual CT severity scores and clinical variables (p = 0.549). Furthermore, the model based on the combination of CT radiomics and clinical variables achieved time-dependent ROC-AUCs of 0.897, 0.933, and 0.927 for the prediction of progression risks at 3, 5 and 7 days, respectively. CONCLUSION: CT radiomics features combined with clinical variables were predictive of COVID-19 severity and progression to critical illness with fairly high accuracy.","Purkayastha, Subhanik; Xiao, Yanhe; Jiao, Zhicheng; Thepumnoeysuk, Rujapa; Halsey, Kasey; Wu, Jing; Tran, Thi My Linh; Hsieh, Ben; Choi, Ji Whae; Wang, Dongcui; Vallières, Martin; Wang, Robin; Collins, Scott; Feng, Xue; Feldman, Michael; Zhang, Paul J; Atalay, Michael; Sebro, Ronnie; Yang, Li; Fan, Yong; Liao, Wei Hua; Bai, Harrison X",Korean J Radiol,233,1

Their paper reflects criticisms that have been made of face coverings policies more generally. Method Narrative rebuttal. Results I address charges that my coauthors and I had misapplied the precautionary principle; drawn conclusions that were not supported by empirical research; and failed to take account of potential harms But before that, I remind my critics that the evidence on face coverings goes beyond the contested trials and observational studies they place centre stage. I set out some key findings from basic science, epidemiology, mathematical modelling, case studies, and natural experiments, and use this rich and diverse body of evidence as the backdrop for my rebuttal of their narrowly framed objections. I challenge my critics' apparent assumption that a particular kind of systematic review should be valorised over narrative and real-world evidence, since stories are crucial to both our scientific understanding and our moral imagination. Conclusion I conclude by thanking my academic adversaries for the intellectual sparring match, but exhort them to remember our professional accountability to a society in crisis.

In this study, we aimed to compare the outcomes of spontaneous and induced breech deliveries and to describe variations in induction rates. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study comprising 1054 singleton live fetuses in breech presentation at Trondheim University Hospital from 2012 to 2019. The main outcome was intrapartum cesarean section, and secondary outcomes were postpartum hemorrhage, anal sphincter ruptures, Apgar scores, pH in the umbilical artery and metabolic acidosis. All data were obtained from the hospital birth journal. RESULTS: Induction of labor was performed in 127/606 (21.0%) of women with planned vaginal birth. The frequency of intrapartum cesarean section was 48.0% for induced labor vs 45.7% for spontaneous labor (p=0.64). We found no differences in the frequency of postpartum hemorrhage or anal sphincter ruptures between induced and spontaneous births. The median pH in the umbilical artery was significantly lower in neonates with induced labor compared with neonates with spontaneous labor (7.22 vs 7.25; p=0.02). The frequency of pH <7.05 was 7.0% for induced labor vs 2.9% (p= 0.05) for spontaneous labor, but the frequency of pH <7.0 was not significantly different: 2.6% vs 0.8% (p=0.14), respectively. Three neonates with planned vaginal birth had metabolic acidosis: two with spontaneous labors and one with induced labor. Three fetuses with planned vaginal birth died during labor: two with spontaneous onset of labor and one with induced labor. All three were extremely preterm: two were delivered in week 23 and one in week 25. We did not observe any significant trend in induction rates in either parous or in nulliparous women. CONCLUSIONS: The induction rates were stable during the study period.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: The research reviewed 1196 patients with spinal tuberculosis who received treatment at six hospitals from January 2000 to January 2016. A total of 623 patients who had spinal tuberculosis were included in the study. All patients underwent debridement, decompression, allograft bone grafting, and instrumentation. Postoperative treatment consisted of a combination of anti-TB drug treatment for 18 months and brace fixed braking for 3-9 months. Clinical outcome, laboratory indexes, and radiological results were analysed. RESULTS: The average follow-up time was 34.1 months (12-60 months). Pain was relieved postoperatively in all cases, and 87.8% of patients were painless at the final follow-up. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) significantly decreased and returned to normal at the final follow-up. The fusion rate of allografts was 30.2% and 98.4% at the 9- and 12-month follow-ups, respectively. At the final follow-up, the fusion rate was 100%. CONCLUSION: The application of allografts in the surgical management of spinal tuberculosis is safe and effective. Allografts can replace autografts in surgeries for spinal tuberculosis.","Sen, Yang; Wenjie, Wu; Fei, Luo; Zehua, Zhang",Turkish neurosurgery,233,24

Myocardial injury and thrombo-embolism are known complications for those with severe forms of disease. The incidence and risk factors for these complications for those patients who are asymptomatic or with mild forms of COVID-19 is unknown. Case summary: In this report we describe the case of a 35-year-old man with no past cardiac history who presented with chest pain and a high-sensitivity troponin level of 386 ng/L in the context of an unspecified mild viral illness 1 month previously. Diagnostic evaluation revealed a new cardiomyopathy, left ventricular thrombus, and mid right coronary artery thrombosis. The coronary thrombosis was treated with thrombectomy. SARS-CoV-2 antibodies returned positive. He initially did well post-procedure; however, prior to discharge, he developed a second arterial thrombo-embolism event, a middle cerebral artery stroke. He was treated with thrombectomy and remains hospitalized. Discussion: Recognition that mild COVID-19 can be complicated by subsequent cardiac injury and/or coagulopathy is important. As more people recover from this viral illness and return to normal activity levels, discussion among cardiac experts has begun regarding screening for occult myocardial injury in those who plan to resume competitive athletic activity. This case highlights the need for investigation regarding (i) the duration of thrombophilia after recovery from illness; (ii) the population that should receive thromboprophylaxis; and (iii) the duration of thromboprophylaxis therapy for COVID-19.","Ranard, Lauren S; Engel, David J; Kirtane, Ajay J; Masoumi, Amirali",Eur Heart J Case Rep,233,1

Methods We categorized countries worldwide into three groups with <25%; 25-45%; >45% of active male smokers with data expressed as median and interquartile range [IQR] and extracted data on SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19 deaths per million inhabitants. We also applied multivariate regression techniques to adjust for several epidemiological factors. Results COVID-19 mortality was 13 (5-24) per million inhabitants in countries with male smokers >45% and 33 (4-133) in countries where male smokers were <25%. SARS-CoV-2 infection rates were 436 (217-954) and 1139 (302-4084) with data confirmed when dividing data for each continent and when controlling for confounding factors. Conclusions We found a counterintuitive low COVID-19 mortality and SARS-CoV-2 infection in countries with high prevalence of male smokers at the global level and within each continent, suggesting that active smoking habit is protective.

Facial plastic surgery has significant exposure to these areas during craniomaxillofacial trauma procedures and rhinoplasty. Methods: Airborne particulate generation in the 1-10 µm range was quantified with an optical particle sizer in real time during cadaveric-simulated rhinoplasty and facial trauma conditions. Procedures tested included mandibular plate screw drilling, calvarial drilling, nasal bone osteotomy, nasal dorsal rasping, and piezoelectric saw use. Particulate generation was measured both adjacent to the surgical site and at surgeon mouth level (SML). Results: Mandibular plate screw drilling without irrigation generated significant particulate both adjacent to the surgical site and at SML (p < 0.01). Irrigation mitigated particulate generation at SML to nonsignificant levels. Calvarial drilling additionally produced substantial particulate above baseline adjacent to the surgical site (p < 0.01). Standard nasal osteotomies and dorsal rasping did not generate detectable airborne particulate, whereas piezoelectric saw use was associated with significant particulate generation both adjacent to the surgical site (p < 0.001) and at SML (p < 0.01). At SML, smaller particulate represented a significantly higher proportion of total particulate detected. Conclusions: The majority of craniomaxillofacial trauma procedures involve particle generation that may be limited in spread by the use of local irrigation. Most bony work involved in rhinoplasty can be safely performed without a high degree of particle formation. The use of piezoelectric instruments in rhinoplasty should be avoided when concerned for particulate generation.","Gadkaree, Shekhar K; Derakhshan, Adeeb; Workman, Alan D; Feng, Allen L; Quesnel, Alicia M; Shaye, David A",,233,26

METHODS: The superficial (SF) and deep macular VD of 50 patients with SARS CoV2 pneumonia who had positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests and who recovered after receiving treatment and 55 healthy age- and gender-matched controls were compared using OCTA. Blood inflammation parameters were also recorded. RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in terms of age and gender (p = 0.147 and p = 0.504, respectively). Nor was there a difference with respect to smokers between the two groups (p = 0.231). In COVID-19 patients, the VDs in superior hemi quadrant, superior quadrant and inferior quadrant, were significantly lower (p = 0.033, p = 0.029 and p = 0.042, respectively) in superficial plexus. It was also significantly lower in parafovea, superior hemi and superior quadrants (p = 0.026, p < 0.001 and p = 0.004, respectively) in deep plexus. In addition, white blood cell and neutrophil counts were significantly negatively correlated with the VD of the deep parafovea, deep superior quadrant and deep superior hemi quadrant (p < 0.05).

While the influenza virus is a known contributor to human morbidity and mortality, the question of how a coinfection between COVID-19 and influenza might manifest is of utmost concern. The aim of this study was to review the limited cases of COVID-19/influenza coinfection currently available in the literature, along with cases in the community of El Paso, TX, to determine whether any patterns of clinical presentation and morbidity emerged. An international review of the literature was conducted. Six published articles describing COVID-19/influenza coinfection were identified, with a total of 13 patients described therein. Three additional patients were identified from the El Paso, TX data. The most common presenting symptoms were fever and cough. The most common laboratory findings were elevated C-reactive protein and lymphocytopenia. Thirteen patients presented with viral pneumonia findings on CT, and nine had findings of ground-glass opacity. Finally, complications were reported in six patients, with most common complication being acute respiratory distress syndrome. The results of the review indicate that, due to the similarity in presentation between COVID-19 and influenza, further analysis will be required to understand the effects of coinfection on morbidity and mortality. However, the limited number of coinfection cases in the literature indicates that the implementation of COVID-19 control measures may continue to play a role in limiting the spread of these human respiratory pathogens.","Antony, Suresh J; Almaghlouth, Nouf K; Heydemann, Emily L",J Med Virol,233,32

The simplicity of in vitro transcription of mRNA suggests potential for fast, scalable, and low-cost manufacture. RNA vaccines are safe in theory and have shown acceptable tolerability in first clinical trials. Immunogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines in phase 1 trials looks promising, however induction of cellular immunity needs to be confirmed and optimized. Further optimization of RNA vaccine modification and formulation to this end is needed, which may also enable single injection regimens to be achievable. Self-amplifying RNA vaccines, which show high immunogenicity at low doses, might help to improve potency while keeping manufacturing costs low and speed high.

Diabetes, especially when uncontrolled, is also recognized as an important risk factor for COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, certain inflammatory markers [i.e. C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and ferritin] were reported as strong predictors of worse outcomes in COVID-19 positive patients. The same biomarkers have been associated with poor glycemic control. Therefore, achieving euglycemia in patients with diabetes is even more important in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Understanding the immune cell states shared between COVID-19 and other inflammatory diseases with established therapies may help nominate immunomodulatory therapies. METHODS: To identify cellular phenotypes that may be shared across tissues affected by disparate inflammatory diseases, we developed a meta-analysis and integration pipeline that models and removes the effects of technology, tissue of origin, and donor that confound cell-type identification. Using this approach, we integrated > 300,000 single-cell transcriptomic profiles from COVID-19-affected lungs and tissues from healthy subjects and patients with five inflammatory diseases: rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and interstitial lung disease. We tested the association of shared immune states with severe/inflamed status compared to healthy control using mixed-effects modeling. To define environmental factors within these tissues that shape shared macrophage phenotypes, we stimulated human blood-derived macrophages with defined combinations of inflammatory factors, emphasizing in particular antiviral interferons IFN-beta (IFN-ß) and IFN-gamma (IFN-Î³), and pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF. RESULTS: We built an immune cell reference consisting of > 300,000 single-cell profiles from 125 healthy or disease-affected donors from COVID-19 and five inflammatory diseases. We observed a CXCL10+ CCL2+ inflammatory macrophage state that is shared and strikingly abundant in severe COVID-19 bronchoalveolar lavage samples, inflamed RA synovium, inflamed CD ileum, and UC colon. These cells exhibited a distinct arrangement of pro-inflammatory and interferon response genes, including elevated levels of CXCL10, CXCL9, CCL2, CCL3, GBP1, STAT1, and IL1B. Further, we found this macrophage phenotype is induced upon co-stimulation by IFN-Î³ and TNF-&#945;. CONCLUSIONS: Our integrative analysis identified immune cell states shared across inflamed tissues affected by inflammatory diseases and COVID-19. Our study supports a key role for IFN-Î³ together with TNF-&#945; in driving an abundant inflammatory macrophage phenotype in severe COVID-19-affected lungs, as well as inflamed RA synovium, CD ileum, and UC colon, which may be targeted by existing immunomodulatory therapies.","Zhang, Fan; Mears, Joseph R; Shakib, Lorien; Beynor, Jessica I; Shanaj, Sara; Korsunsky, Ilya; Nathan, Aparna; Donlin, Laura T; Raychaudhuri, Soumya",Genome Med,233,16

These products induce changes in pH around electrodes and cause dehydration resulting from electroosmotic pressure, leading to changes in microenvironment and thus metabolism of the tissues, yielding apoptosis. The procedure requires adequate time for electrochemical reactions to yield products sufficient to induce apoptosis of the tissues. Incorporation of electroporation into electrolysis can decrease the treatment time and enhance the efficiency of electrolytic ablation. Electroporation causes permeabilization in the cell membrane allowing the efflux of potassium ions and extension of the electrochemical area, facilitating the electrolysis process. However, little is known about the combined effects on apoptosis in liver ablation. In this study, we performed an immunohistochemical evaluation of apoptosis for the incorporation of electroporation into electrolysis in liver tissues. To do so, the study was performed with microelectrodes for fixed treatment time while the applied voltage varied to increase the applied total energy for electrolysis. The apoptotic rate for electrolytic ablation increased with enhanced applied energy. The apoptotic rate was 4.31 ± 1.73 times that of control in the synergistic combination compared to 1.49 ± 0.33 times that of the control in electrolytic ablation alone. Additionally, tissue structure was better preserved in synergistic combination ablation compared to electrolysis with an increment of 3.8 mA. Thus, synergistic ablation may accelerate apoptosis and be a promising modality for the treatment of liver tumors.","Kim, Hong Bae; Chung, Jong Hoon",Technol Cancer Res Treat,233,1

Using individual-level voting data from the primary along with county COVID-19 rates, I test the interactive effects of the prevalence of COVID-19 and voter age on the probability of voting in person or not voting at all. I find that for both Democrats and Republicans, voters were more likely to not vote in any manner as the county COVID-19 rate and their age increased. This effect is more pronounced for Republicans. No differences in probabilities of in person voting occurred for Democrat voters based upon age, but older Republicans were less likely to vote in person as the county COVID-19 rate increased.

This paper will analyse the implications for insurance investing. We start by showing the impact of the severe drawdown in the equity markets during the initial phase of the crisis in March/April 2020 on a typical insurer's balance sheet. We then look at the effects of the dislocations in fixed income, which make up the largest share of exposures in insurance companies' portfolios. We track the performance of investment grade credit during the year while paying special attention to the impact of downgrades on insurers' solvency capital. We finally study alternative investments with particular focus on private markets. These investments are a faster-growing part of insurance companies' exposures and pose specific challenges as they are complex, more difficult to access, have limited liquidity and are often harder to price, especially during times of high market volatility. Yet, compared to their equivalent public market exposures, private investments provide additional income, which allows insurers to charge lower rates on their products to policyholders. As the sophistication and complexity of investments keep growing, companies as well as regulators need to find a good balance between policyholder protection and market efficiency.","Liedtke, Patrick M",Geneva Pap Risk Insur Issues Pract,233,1

Unfortunately, these are often diagnosed at a late stage of the disease process, after tissue loss has already occurred. PURPOSE/HYPOTHESIS: To evaluate longitudinal changes in knee articular cartilage and knee function in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) basketball players and their evolution over the competitive season and off-season. STUDY TYPE: Longitudinal, multisite cohort study. POPULATION: Thirty-two NCAA Division 1 athletes: 22 basketball players and 10 swimmers. FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: Bilateral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using a combined T1&#961; and T2 magnetization-prepared angle-modulated portioned k-space spoiled gradient-echo snapshots (MAPSS) sequence at 3T. ASSESSMENT: We calculated T2 and T1&#961; relaxation times to compare compositional cartilage changes between three timepoints: preseason 1, postseason 1, and preseason 2.

The basketball players had significantly lower KOOS measures in every domain compared with the swimmers: Pain (P < 0.05), Symptoms (P < 0.05), Function in Daily Living (P < 0.05), Function in Sport/Recreation (P < 0.05), and Quality of Life (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that T2 and T1&#961; MRI can detect significant seasonal changes in the articular cartilage of basketball players and that there are regional differences in the articular cartilage that are indicative of basketball-specific stress on the femoral cartilage. This study demonstrates the potential of quantitative MRI to monitor global and regional cartilage health in athletes at risk of developing cartilage problems.

It is emphasized that the direct target of the virus is ACE2 underlining the obvious difference with ACE. Nevertheless, we hypothesized that a back load build up effect on Ang II may usurp the ACE capacity and subsequently leave the bradykinin system unabated. We think there are clinical clues for dry cough and the presumed aggravating role of ACE inhibitors like captopril on the disease process. Thereby, we speculated that inhibition of bradykinin synthesis and/or blockade of bradykinin B2 receptor using Aprotinin/ecallantide and Icatibant, respectively, may hold therapeutic promise in severe cases and these molecules can be advanced to clinical trials.","Ghahestani, Seyed-Mohammad; Mahmoudi, Javad; Hajebrahimi, Sakineh; Sioofy-Khojine, Amir-Babak; Salehi-Pourmehr, Hanieh; Sadeghi-Ghyassi, Fatemeh; Mostafaei, Hadi",Iran J Allergy Asthma Immunol,233,1

Based on empirical data, patients with sarcopenia are speculated to have increased infection rates and dismal prognoses amid the current 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic. COVID-19 infection also aggravates sarcopenia because of the increased muscle wasting caused by systematic inflammation and the reduced physical activity and inadequate nutrient intake caused by social isolation.

Although the knowledge base surrounding COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 has grown rapidly, significant gaps in our knowledge remain and inaccurate information continues to circulate. This review will discuss the interaction between asthma and COVID-19 to provide a comprehensive understanding based on the currently available published data. RECENT FINDINGS: Non-SARS human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are a significant cause of asthma exacerbations, but SARS-CoV-2 does not appear to exacerbate asthma. Data thus far strongly suggest that patients with asthma are at no increased risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2 or more severe disease if infected with COVID-19. Although the data are extremely limited on inhaled corticosteroids and biologic medications, there remain no data suggesting that these therapeutics positively or negatively impact the severity or outcome of COVID-19. SUMMARY: Data are rapidly evolving regarding COVID-19 and asthma. At this time, asthma does not appear to positively or negatively affect outcomes of COVID-19; however, it is imperative that practitioners keep abreast of the changing literature as we await a vaccine and control of this pandemic.","Timberlake, Dylan T; Strothman, Kasey; Grayson, Mitchell H",Curr Opin Allergy Clin Immunol,233,26

More than this, they imposed the heaviest restrictions in the EU. For more than a month, during the lockdown period, everything stopped: schools and universities had only online classes, national and international flights and gatherings were forbidden, and many restrictions for travel were imposed. This paper analyzes the changes that occurred in electricity consumption linked with economic growth, during the pandemic, in Romania. For a better understanding of the correlations between gross domestic product (GDP) and electricity consumption (EC) in different economic contexts, the period 2008–2020 was divided into three series: the 2008–2012 financial crisis and the post-crisis recovery period, the 2013–2019 period of economic growth, and the Q1–Q3 2020 pandemic period. Using correlation coefficients and regression analysis, the authors found that the GDP decoupled from EC in the first period. The increase in GDP led to an increase in the consumption of electricity and the electricity produced from RESs in the second period. In Q3 2020, the real GDP is different from the calculated GDP, due to the pandemic. In Romania, the electricity consumption decreased within the first nine months of the pandemic due to the economic contraction. The electricity that comes from coal and hydropower plants suffered the biggest decrease. If the electricity that comes from NRESs can be adapted to the economic demands, the quantity of electricity that comes from RESs will be influenced by the climate conditions.","Iancu, Ioana Ancuta Darab Cosmin Pompei Cirstea Stefan Dragos",Energies,233,21

The pathogenesis of this virus is not yet clearly understood, but there is evidence of a hyper-inflammatory immune response in critically ill patients, which leads to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi-organ failure. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A literature review was performed to identify relevant articles on COVID-19 published up to April 30, 2020. The search resulted in 361 total articles. After reviewing the titles and abstracts for inclusion, some irrelevant papers were excluded. Additional relevant articles were identified from a review of citations referenced. KEY FINDINGS: SARS-CoV-2, directly and indirectly, affects the immune system and avoids being eliminated in early stages. On the other hand, the secretion of inflammatory cytokines creates critical conditions that lead to multi-organ failure. SIGNIFICANCE: The immune system which is affected by the virus tries to respond via a cytokine storm and hyperinflammation, which itself leads to further multi-organ damage and even death.","Yazdanpanah, Fereshteh; Hamblin, Michael R; Rezaei, Nima",Life Sci,233,24

This study aims to develop a formative structural equation model (SEM) of the Matthew effect in talent. management. Design/methodology/approach: This study develops a formative SEM theoretical model. Training and development (T&D) are the two antecedents of the latent construct – talent management strategy (TMS). This study frames the latent construct (TMS) in the proximal context of reducing burnout (cynicism and inefficacy), the distal context of subjective and intangible outcomes (job and life satisfaction) and the omnibus context of objective, tangible and financial rewards (the sales commission). The study collected data from multiple sources – objective sales commission from personnel records and subjective survey data from 512 sales employees. Findings: The empirical discoveries support the theory. Both T&D contribute significantly to the TMS, which reduces burnout in the immediate context. TMS enhances job satisfaction more than life satisfaction in the distal context. TMS significantly and indirectly improves boundary spanners’ sales commission in the omnibus context via life satisfaction, but not job satisfaction. The model prevails for the whole sample, men, but not women. Practical implications: Our discoveries offer practical implications for the Matthew effect in talent management: policymakers must cultivate T&D, develop TMS, facilitate the spillover effect from job satisfaction to life satisfaction, concentrate on the meaning in their lives and take their mind off money. TMS ultimately helps ignite these boundary spanners’ sales commission and their organization’s bottom line and financial health. The rich get richer. Originality/value: It is life satisfaction (not job satisfaction) that excites boundary-spanning employees’ high level of sales commission. Our model prevails for the whole sample and men, but not for women. Job satisfaction spills over to life satisfaction for the entire sample, for men, but not for women.

The main quality control parameters, such as specific activity and radiochemical purity, were evaluated by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Radiochemical concentration was determined by radioactivity calibrator. Metabolic kinetics and the level of 18F-deoxy-thiamine in brains of mice and marmosets were studied by micro-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT). In vivo stability, renal excretion rate, and biodistribution of 18F-deoxy-thiamine in the mice were assayed using HPLC and Î³-counter, respectively. Also, the correlation between the retention of cerebral 18F-deoxy-thiamine in 60 min after injection as represented by the area under the curve (AUC) and blood thiamine levels was investigated. RESULTS: The 18F-deoxy-thiamine was stable both in vitro and in vivo. The uptake and clearance of 18F-deoxy-thiamine were quick in the mice. It reached the max standard uptake value (SUVmax) of 4.61 ± 0.53 in the liver within 1 min, 18.67 ± 7.04 in the kidney within half a minute. The SUV dropped to 0.72 ± 0.05 and 0.77 ± 0.35 after 60 min of injection in the liver and kidney, respectively. After injection, kidney, liver, and pancreas exhibited high accumulation level of 18F-deoxy-thiamine, while brain, muscle, fat, and gonad showed low accumulation concentration, consistent with previous reports on thiamine distribution in mice. Within 90 min after injection, the level of 18F-deoxy-thiamine in the brain of C57BL/6 mice with thiamine deficiency (TD) was 1.9 times higher than that in control mice, and was 3.1 times higher in ICR mice with TD than that in control mice. The AUC of the tracer in the brain of marmosets within 60 min was 29.33 ± 5.15 and negatively correlated with blood thiamine diphosphate levels (r = - 0.985, p = 0.015). CONCLUSION: The 18F-deoxy-thiamine meets the requirements for ideal PET tracer for in vivo detecting the status of cerebral thiamine metabolism.","Wang, Changpeng; Zhang, Siwei; Zou, Yuefei; Ma, Hongzhao; Jiang, Donglang; Sheng, Lei; Sang, Shaoming; Jin, Lirong; Guan, Yihui; Gui, Yuan; Xu, Zhihong; Zhong, Chunjiu",EJNMMI Res,233,16

A cross-sectional online survey was conducted in Norway, UK, USA and Australia during April/May 2020, and 836 participants in the relevant age groups were included in the analysis. Multiple regression analyses were conducted to examine associations between the use of video-based communication tools and loneliness, mental health and quality of life within age groups, while adjusting by sociodemographic variables. Video-based communication tools were found to be more often used among participants aged 60-69 years (60.1%), compared to participants aged 70 or above (51.8%, p < 0.05). Adjusting for all variables, the use of video-based communication was associated with less loneliness (ß = -0.12, p < 0.01) and higher quality of life (ß = 0.14, p < 0.01) among participants aged 60-69 years, while no associations were observed for participants in the oldest age group. The use of video-based communication tools was therefore associated with favorable psychological outcomes among participants in their sixties, but not among participants in the oldest age group. The study results support the notion that age may influence the association between the use of video-based communication tools and psychological outcomes amongst older people.","Bonsaksen, Tore; Thygesen, Hilde; Leung, Janni; Ruffolo, Mary; Schoultz, Mariyana; Price, Daicia; Østertun Geirdal, Amy",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),233,30

It can cause several effects on thyroid functions as well. We aimed to assess the lasting sequelae of COVID-19 on thyroid hormone and the clinical course of the disease as a result. METHODS: Out of 76 patients, 48 patients of COVID-19 positive and 28 patients of COVID-19 negative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were assessed for thyroid functions, IL-6, and Procalcitonin between moderate, severe, and critical pneumonia on HRCT. RESULTS: Seventy-five percent of patients with COVID-19 had thyroid abnormalities and higher IL-6 levels (76.10 ± 82.35 vs. 6.99 ± 3.99, 95% CI 52.18-100.01, P-value <0.01). Logistic regression analysis suggested TT3 (P-value 0.01), IL-6 (P-value <0.01), and Procalcitonin (P-value 0.03) as independent risk factors for COVID-19. ROC curve demonstrated IL-6 as the most sensitive marker (P-value <0.01), and TT3, and Procalcitonin as the predictor for COVID-19 disease. CONCLUSION: This pilot study from Pakistan demonstrates that changes in serum TSH and TT3 levels may be important manifestations of the courses of COVID-19 pneumonia.","Malik, Jahanzeb; Malik, Asmara; Javaid, Muhammad; Zahid, Tayyaba; Ishaq, Uzma; Shoaib, Muhammad",PLoS One,233,17

RESULTS: In NHANES-III, after adjustment for sex, race/ethnicity, education, body mass index, serum cholesterol, hypertension, and NHANES phase (or cycle), the HR comparing influenza or pneumonia mortality among participants with creatinine-corrected urinary cadmium in the 80th vs. 20th percentile was 1.15 (95% CI: 1.05, 1.26; p=0.002) in the population as a whole and 1.27 (95% CI: 1.12, 1.43; p=0.002) among never smokers. In NHANES 1999-2006, adjusted HRs for the 80th vs. 20th percentile of blood cadmium were 1.14 (95% CI: 0.96, 1.36; p=0.15) for the overall population and 1.71 (95% CI: 0.95, 3.09; p=0.07) in never smokers. DISCUSSION: Among middle-aged and older adults in the United States, higher cadmium burdens are associated with higher mortality from influenza or pneumonia. This raises the possibility that cadmium may worsen outcomes from COVID-19 infections. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP7598.","Park, Sung Kyun; Sack, Coralynn; Sirén, Matti J; Hu, Howard",Environ Health Perspect,233,6

Limited research has evaluated if, and how, pandemic-related stressors are associated with changes in alcohol consumption and binge drinking. Objectives: This analysis aims to identify COVID-19-related stressors associated with changes in alcohol consumption and binge drinking since the outbreak of the coronavirus. Methods: Data were collected on sociodemographics, alcohol consumption, and COVID-19-related stressors (household composition, job status, essential worker, stay-at-home duration, and depression) using a web-based, self-report survey to US adults from mid-March to mid-April 2020. Multivariable logistic and multinomial regression models were used to assess associations between COVID-19-related stressors and binge drinking and changes in alcohol consumption. Among 1,982 participants, 69% were female and 31% male. Results: Thirty-four percent of the sample reported binge drinking during the COVID-19 pandemic. More binge drinkers increased alcohol consumption during the pandemic (60%) than non-binge drinkers (28%). After adjusting for sociodemographics, for every 1-week increase in time spent at home during the pandemic, there was 1.21 (95% CI: 1.08-1.35) greater odds of binge drinking. Additionally, binge drinkers with a previous diagnosis of depression and current depression symptoms had greater odds of increased alcohol consumption compared to those reporting no depression (AOR = 1.80, 95% CI: 1.15-2.81). Conclusion: Specific COVID-19-related stressors are related to alcohol consumption. This highlights the ancillary and unintended effects of the COVID-19 pandemic which could have long-lasting population health consequences.","Weerakoon, S M; Jetelina, K K; Knell, G",Am J Drug Alcohol Abuse,233,16

Blood samples were obtained from the patients along with the initial laboratory tests for clinical outcomes upon their first admission to hospital. In the first and third trimesters serum zinc level was lower (p:0,004 and p:0,02), serum copper level was higher (p:0,006 and p:0,008), the Zn / Cu ratio decreased(p < 0.0001 and p < 0.0001) and the serum magnesium level was higher(p < 0.0001 and p < 0.0001) in the COVID-19 group.In the second trimester COVID-19 patients had lower serum zinc (p:0,05) and copper levels (p:0,0003) compared to controls.

They generally take a unidirectional perspective and explain panic buying and stockpiling by considering buying behavior as only a reaction to panic and uncertainty. We conducted 18 qualitative interviews in Brazil and Germany to gain insight into changes in buying behavior and consumers’ feelings on the changed circumstances, which provided a bidirectional perspective on perceived risk, adapted buying behavior, and emotional self-regulation.

These variants harboring diverse mutations in the gene encoding the spike protein raise important concerns about their immune evasion potential. Here, we isolated infectious B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 strains from acutely infected individuals. We examined sensitivity of the two variants to SARS-CoV-2 antibodies present in sera and nasal swabs from individuals infected with previously circulating strains or who were recently vaccinated, in comparison with a D614G reference virus. We utilized a new rapid neutralization assay, based on reporter cells that become positive for GFP after overnight infection. Sera from 58 convalescent individuals collected up to 9 months after symptoms, similarly neutralized B.1.1.7 and D614G. In contrast, after 9 months, convalescent sera had a mean sixfold reduction in neutralizing titers, and 40% of the samples lacked any activity against B.1.351. Sera from 19 individuals vaccinated twice with Pfizer Cominarty, longitudinally tested up to 6 weeks after vaccination, were similarly potent against B.1.1.7 but less efficacious against B.1.351, when compared to D614G. Neutralizing titers increased after the second vaccine dose, but remained 14-fold lower against B.1.351. In contrast, sera from convalescent or vaccinated individuals similarly bound the three spike proteins in a flow cytometry-based serological assay. Neutralizing antibodies were rarely detected in nasal swabs from vaccinees. Thus, faster-spreading SARS-CoV-2 variants acquired a partial resistance to neutralizing antibodies generated by natural infection or vaccination, which was most frequently detected in individuals with low antibody levels. Our results indicate that B1.351, but not B.1.1.7, may increase the risk of infection in immunized individuals.","Planas, Delphine; Bruel, Timothée; Grzelak, Ludivine; Guivel-Benhassine, Florence; Staropoli, Isabelle; Porrot, Françoise; Planchais, Cyril; Buchrieser, Julian; Rajah, Maaran Michael; Bishop, Elodie; Albert, Mélanie; Donati, Flora; Prot, Matthieu; Behillil, Sylvie; Enouf, Vincent; Maquart, Marianne; Smati-Lafarge, Mounira; Varon, Emmanuelle; Schortgen, Frédérique; Yahyaoui, Layla; Gonzalez, Maria; De Sèze, Jérôme; Péré, Hélène; Veyer, David; Sève, Aymeric; Simon-Lorière, Etienne; Fafi-Kremer, Samira; Stefic, Karl; Mouquet, Hugo; Hocqueloux, Laurent; van der Werf, Sylvie; Prazuck, Thierry; Schwartz, Olivier",Nat Med,233,12

It argues that feminist economic geography provides a starting point for examinations of working from home during and after COVID-19. This situates writing on social reproduction, and informal and unpaid work in the home, within the purview of our understanding of pandemic response. Following this review, the paper demonstrates this argument by interrogating Canada's ""telework capacity"" discourse and the decisions by white-collar offices regarding the continuation and abatement of ""digital by default"" policies. The pandemic will radically shift our understanding of the meanings of both home and work, and this paper, through a critical review of key literature, suggests that feminist economic geography provides one starting point for theorizing the implications of that shift in the Canadian context.","Cockayne, Daniel",,233,7

However, the factors contributing to its disparate racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic effects are part of an expansive and continuous history of oppressive social policy and marginalising geopolitics. This history is characterised by institutionally generated spatial inequalities forged through processes of residential segregation and neglectful urban planning. In the USA, aspects of COVID-19's manifestation closely mirror elements of the build-up and response to the Flint crisis, Michigan's racially and class-contoured water crisis that began in 2014, and to other prominent environmental injustice cases, such as the 1995 Chicago (IL, USA) heatwave that severely affected the city's south and west sides, predominantly inhabited by Black people. Each case shares common macrosocial and spatial characteristics and is instructive in showing how civic trust suffers in the aftermath of public health disasters, becoming especially degenerative among historically and spatially marginalised populations. Offering a commentary on the sociogeographical dynamics that gave rise to these crises and this institutional distrust, we discuss how COVID-19 has both inherited and augmented patterns of spatial inequality. We conclude by outlining particular steps that can be taken to prevent and reduce spatial inequalities generated by COVID-19, and by discussing the preliminary steps to restore trust between historically disenfranchised communities and the public officials and institutions tasked with responding to COVID-19.","Ezell, Jerel M; Griswold, Delilah; Chase, Elizabeth C; Carver, Evan",Lancet Planet Health,233,20

In this work, we propose lifelong learning of hate speech classification on social media. To alleviate catastrophic forgetting, we propose to use Variational Representation Learning (VRL) along with a memory module based on LB-SOINN (Load-Balancing Self-Organizing Incremental Neural Network).

First, she underwent a laboratory examination, which showed a high proportion of atypical lymphocytes (19%) and an increase in hepatic enzyme activities, and was then hospitalized with a diagnosis of infectious mononucleosis (IM). However, the blood examination did not show any increase in anti-Epstein-Barr virus VCM-IgM. Subsequently, she developed tonsillar hypertrophy with purulent plugs. An additional examination for infection of other pathogens revealed positivity only for SARS-CoV-2 in a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) test. The patient was transferred to the COVID-19-specific isolation ward, and none of the ward staff, patients, or either of the two otolaryngologists who had directly examined this patient showed positive signs for SARS-CoV-2 in a LAMP test.

Although this has reversed some of the progress made in reducing the global burden of tuberculosis (TB) disease, there is an opportunity to incorporate lessons learned to improve TB programmes going forward. APPROACH: We use Pakistan as a case study to discuss three important adaptations in light of COVID-19: bringing care closer to patients; strengthening primary health care systems; and proactively addressing stigma and fear. FINDINGS: COVID-19 control in Pakistan has restricted people's ability to travel and this has forced the TB programme to reduce the need for in-person health facility visits and bring care closer to patients' homes. Strategies that may be useful for providing more convenient care to patients in the future include: : remote treatment support using telemedicine; collaborating with private healthcare providers; and establishing community medicine collection points. As part of the response to COVID-19 in Pakistan, the out-patient departments of major tertiary and secondary care hospitals were closed, and this highlighted the importance of strengthening primary healthcare for both better pandemic and TB control. Finally, stigma associated with COVID-19 and TB can be addressed using trusted community-based health workers, such as Lady Health Workers in Pakistan.","Fatima, Razia; Akhtar, Nasim; Yaqoob, Aashifa; Harries, Anthony D; Khan, Mishal S",Int. j. infect. dis,233,24

In such scenarios, telecollaboration and virtual exchange have gained increased attention as powerful pedagogical strategies to allow for the continuity of intercultural exchanges and understanding the trends of this growing field can be of high significance to practitioners when planning future related initiatives. Although telecollaboration and virtual exchange are not new phenomena, to the best of our knowledge, a thorough bibliometric study of the area, considering the characteristics of its publications and its scientific community, has not yet been developed. This study carried out a bibliometric analysis of the telecollaboration and virtual exchange research field using a set of 254 articles from the Web of Science and Scopus databases with the objective of characterising the area as well as identifying research tendencies. In particular, this study uses four analytical scientometric tools: co-citation, co-authorship, keywords co-occurrence analysis and identification of research trends. This study identified emerging and declining themes in the field of telecollaboration and virtual exchange, confirming that the practice is increasingly adopting diverse formats and cutting across different knowledge fields. In addition, results showed that international collaboration so far involves few countries and there is much space to widen co-authorship networks to enhance intercultural exchanges. The review also explores the benefits and drawbacks of the technological tools adopted in the studies from our sample database.

The analysis employs a two-stage SEIR model with different reproductive numbers pre- and post-lockdown. These parameters are estimated from data on the daily number of confirmed cases in a process that automatically detects the time at which the lockdown became effective. The model is evaluated by considering its predictive accuracy on current data and is then extended to a three-stage version to explore relaxations. The results show the extent to which each country was successful in reducing the reproductive number and demonstrate how the approach is able to model recent increases in the number of cases in all six countries, including the second peak in the US. The results also indicate that the current levels of relaxation in all five European countries could lead to significant second waves that last longer than the corresponding first waves. While there is uncertainty about the implications of these findings at this stage, they do suggest that a lot of vigilance is needed.","Glass, David H",Math Biosci,233,24

While these treatments can improve patient's recovery and survival, these therapeutic strategies do not lead to unequivocal restoration of the lung damage inflicted by this disease. Stem cell therapies and, more recently, their secreted extracellular vesicles (EVs), are emerging as new promising treatments, which could attenuate inflammation but also regenerate the lung damage caused by COVID-19. Stem cells exert their immunomodulatory, anti-oxidant, and reparative therapeutic effects likely through their EVs, and therefore, could be beneficial, alone or in combination with other therapeutic agents, in people with COVID-19. In this review article, we outline the mechanisms of cytokine storm and lung damage caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus leading to COVID-19 disease and how mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and their secreted EVs can be utilized to tackle this damage by harnessing their regenerative properties, which gives them potential enhanced clinical utility compared to other investigated pharmacological treatments. There are currently 17 clinical trials evaluating the therapeutic potential of MSCs for the treatment of COVID-19, the majority of which are administered intravenously with only one clinical trial testing MSC-derived exosomes via inhalation route. While we wait for the outcomes from these trials to be reported, here we emphasize opportunities and risks associated with these therapies, as well as delineate the major roadblocks to progressing these promising curative therapies toward mainstream treatment for COVID-19.","Chrzanowski, Wojciech; Kim, Sally Yunsun; McClements, Lana",Front.

Thus, there was a striking increase in the: (i) frequency of CD14+CD16+ inflammatory monocytes;(ii) concentration of IFN- y in the plasma, which correlated with enhanced pSTAT3 and pSTAT1 levels in monocytes and T cells;and (iii) transcriptional signatures of innate responses characteristic of antiviral vaccine responses against pandemic influenza, HIV and Ebola, within 2 days following booster vaccination compared to primary vaccination. Consistent with these observations, single-cell transcriptomics analysis of 242,479 leukocytes demonstrated a ~100-fold increase in the frequency of a myeloid cluster, enriched in a signature of interferon-response transcription factors (TFs) and reduced in AP-1 TFs, one day after secondary immunization, at day 21. Finally, we delineated distinct molecular pathways of innate activation that correlate with CD8 T cell and nAb responses and identified an early monocyte-related signature that was associated with the breadth of the nAb response against the B1.351 variant strain. Collectively, these data provide insights into the immune responses induced by mRNA vaccines and demonstrate their capacity to stimulate an enhanced innate response following booster immunization.","Pulendran, B.; Arunachalam, P.

Three main indicators are screened out to measure the development of agricultural economy, that is, gross regional product, gross output value of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry and fishery, agricultural product production price index. Based on the quarterly data of indicators from 2001 to 2019 from the National Bureau of Statistics, three indicators in Hubei Province in the first quarter and the second quarter of 2020 are predicted by using the deep learning-based time series ARIMA model, ARMA model and LSTM neural network model. By comparing the predicted data with the real data, the impact of COVID-19 is measured on the agricultural situation of Hubei Province. It was found that COVID-19 had a great impact on the agricultural situation of Hubei Province in both of the first and second quarters of 2020, with the impact in the first quarter being greater than that in the second quarter. At the same time, the prediction accuracy of the two methods is compared to find that the time series model is more effective and reliable in predicting the agricultural product price index. The LSTM neural network model with a long and short term memory has a good prediction effect on the regional gross product and the total output value of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry and fishery.","Zou, Yonghong Wang Jiaojiao",Journal of Physics: Conference Series,233,21

This selection is based on confounding variables that affect the treatment assignment and the outcome. Propensity score methods aim to correct for confounding. However, not all covariates are confounders. We propose the outcome-adaptive random forest (OARF) that only includes desirable variables for estimating the propensity score to decrease bias and variance. Our approach works in high-dimensional datasets and if the outcome and propensity score model are non-linear and potentially complicated. The OARF excludes covariates that are not associated with the outcome, even in the presence of a large number of spurious variables. Simulation results suggest that the OARF produces unbiased estimates, has a smaller variance and is superior in variable selection compared to other approaches. The results from two empirical examples, the effect of right heart catheterization on mortality and the effect of maternal smoking during pregnancy on birth weight, show comparable treatment effects to previous findings but tighter confidence intervals and more plausible selected variables.","Jacob, Daniel",,233,16

METHODS: This retrospective observational study included all adult patients hospitalized with a laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection from March 1 to March 25, 2020. We extracted data from electronic health records. The primary outcome was the need to mechanical ventilation at day 14. We used multivariate logistic regression to identify risk factors for mechanical ventilation. Follow-up was of at least 14 days. RESULTS: 145 patients were included in the multivariate model, of whom 36 (24.8%) needed mechanical ventilation at 14 days. The median time from symptoms onset to mechanical ventilation was 9·5 days (IQR 7.00, 12.75). Multivariable regression showed increased odds of mechanical ventilation with age (OR 1.09 per year, 95% CI 1.03-1.16, p = 0.002), in males (OR 6.99, 95% CI 1.68-29.03, p = 0.007), in patients who presented with a qSOFA score &#8805;2 (OR 7.24, 95% CI 1.64-32.03, p = 0.009), with bilateral infiltrate (OR 18.92, 3.94-98.23, p<0.001) or with a CRP of 40 mg/l or greater (OR 5.44, 1.18-25.25; p = 0.030) on admission. Patients with more than seven days of symptoms on admission had decreased odds of mechanical ventilation (0.087, 95% CI 0.02-0.38, p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This study gives some insight in the epidemiology and clinical course of patients admitted in a European tertiary hospital with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Age, male sex, high qSOFA score, CRP of 40 mg/l or greater and a bilateral radiological infiltrate could help clinicians identify patients at high risk for mechanical ventilation.","Regina, Jean; Papadimitriou-Olivgeris, Matthaios; Burger, Raphaël; Le Pogam, Marie-Annick; Niemi, Tapio; Filippidis, Paraskevas; Tschopp, Jonathan; Desgranges, Florian; Viala, Benjamin; Kampouri, Eleftheria; Rochat, Laurence; Haefliger, David; Belkoniene, Mehdi; Fidalgo, Carlos; Kritikos, Antonios; Jaton, Katia; Senn, Laurence; Bart, Pierre-Alexandre; Pagani, Jean-Luc; Manuel, Oriol; Lhopitallier, Loïc",PLoS One,233,16

We aimed to develop a risk score to identify patients with increased risk of COVID-19, allowing proper identification and allocation of limited resources. A retrospective study was conducted of 338 patients who were admitted to the hospital from the emergency room to regular floors and tested for COVID-19 at an acute care hospital in the Metropolitan Washington D.C. area. The dataset was split into development and validation sets with a ratio of 6:4. Demographics, presenting symptoms, sick contact, triage vital signs, initial laboratory and chest X-ray results were analysed to develop a prediction model for COVID-19 diagnosis. Multivariable logistic regression was performed in a stepwise fashion to develop a prediction model, and a scoring system was created based on the coefficients of the final model. Among 338 patients admitted to the hospital from the emergency room, 136 (40.2%) patients tested positive for COVID-19 and 202 (59.8%) patients tested negative. Sick contact with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 case (3 points), nursing facility residence (3 points), constitutional symptom (1 point), respiratory symptom (1 point), gastrointestinal symptom (1 point), obesity (1 point), hypoxia at triage (1 point) and leucocytosis (-1 point) were included in the prediction score. A risk score for COVID-19 diagnosis achieved area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.87 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.82-0.92) in the development dataset and 0.85 (95% CI 0.78-0.92) in the validation dataset.

Objective: To examine the association between county-level sociodemographic risk factors and US COVID-19 incidence and mortality. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study analyzed the association between US county-level sociodemographic risk factors and COVID-19 incidence using mixed-effects negative binomial regression, and COVID-19 mortality using zero-inflated negative binomial regression. Data on COVID-19 incidence and mortality were collected from January 20 to July 29, 2020. The association of social risk factors with weekly cumulative incidence and mortality was also examined by interacting time with the index measures, using a random intercept to account for repeated measures. Main Outcomes and Measures: Sociodemographic data from publicly available data sets, including the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Social Vulnerability Index (SVI), which includes subindices of socioeconomic status, household composition and disability, racial/ethnic minority and English language proficiency status, and housing and transportation. Results: As of July 29, 2020, there were a total of 4â¯289â¯283 COVID-19 cases and 147â¯074 COVID-19 deaths in the US. An increase of 0.1 point in SVI score was associated with a 14.3% increase in incidence rate (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 1.14; 95% CI, 1.13-1.16; P < .001) and 13.7% increase in mortality rate (IRR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.12-1.16; P < .001), or an excess of 87 COVID-19 cases and 3 COVID-19 deaths per 100â¯000 population for a SVI score change from 0.5 to 0.6 in a midsize metropolitan county; subindices were also associated with both outcomes.

This juvenilization of blood properties represents a canalization of an acclimatization response to hypoxia that has been well documented in adult goats and sheep.

Experienced docking experiments using the newly released coordinate structure for COVID-19 protease as a receptor and thoughtfully selected chemicals among antiviral and antibiotics drugs as ligands may be leading in this context. We selected nine drugs from HIV-1 protease inhibitors and twenty-one candidates from anti bronchitis drugs based on their chemical structures and enrolled them in blind and active site-directed dockings in different modes and in native-like conditions of interactions. Our findings suggest the binding capacity and the inhibitory potency of candidates are as follows Tipranavir>Indinavir>Atazanavir>Darunavir>Ritonavir>Amprenavir for HIV-1 protease inhibitors and Cefditoren>Cefixime>Erythromycin>Clarithromycin for anti bronchitis medicines.

Here, we report isolation of four human-origin monoclonal antibodies from a convalescent patient, all of which display neutralization abilities. The antibodies B38 and H4 block binding between the spike glycoprotein receptor binding domain (RBD) of the virus and the cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). A competition assay indicated different epitopes on the RBD for these two antibodies, making them a potentially promising virus-targeting monoclonal antibody pair for avoiding immune escape in future clinical applications. Moreover, a therapeutic study in a mouse model validated that these antibodies can reduce virus titers in infected lungs. The RBD-B38 complex structure revealed that most residues on the epitope overlap with the RBD-ACE2 binding interface, explaining the blocking effect and neutralizing capacity. Our results highlight the promise of antibody-based therapeutics and provide a structural basis for rational vaccine design.","Wu, Yan; Wang, Feiran; Shen, Chenguang; Peng, Weiyu; Li, Delin; Zhao, Cheng; Li, Zhaohui; Li, Shihua; Bi, Yuhai; Yang, Yang; Gong, Yuhuan; Xiao, Haixia; Fan, Zheng; Tan, Shuguang; Wu, Guizhen; Tan, Wenjie; Lu, Xuancheng; Fan, Changfa; Wang, Qihui; Liu, Yingxia; Zhang, Chen; Qi, Jianxun; Gao, George Fu; Gao, Feng; Liu, Lei",Science,233,1

The present study showed that the potential therapeutic natural compound auraptene (AUR) enhances junction assembly in cerebrovascular endothelial cells by inducing antioxidant enzymes and the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (mtUPR). Treatment of mouse cerebrovascular endothelial cells with AUR enhanced the expression of junctional proteins, such as occludin, zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin), by increasing the levels of mRNA encoding antioxidant enzymes. AUR treatment also resulted in the depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential and activation of mtUPR. The ability of AUR to protect against ischemic conditions was further assessed using cells deprived of oxygen and glucose. Pretreatment of these cells with AUR protected against damage to junctional proteins, including occludin, claudin-5, ZO-1 and VE-cadherin, accompanied by a stress resilience response regulated by levels of ATF5, LONP1 and HSP60 mRNAs. Collectively, these results indicate that AUR promotes resilience against oxidative stress and improves junction assembly, suggesting that AUR may help maintain intact barriers in cerebrovascular endothelial cells.","Lee, Min Joung; Jang, Yunseon; Zhu, Jiebo; Namgung, Eunji; Go, Dahyun; Seo, Changjun; Ju, Xianshu; Cui, Jianchen; Lee, Yu Lim; Kang, Hyoeun; Kim, Hyeongseok; Chung, Woosuk; Heo, Jun Young",,233,20

Their distinct pathogenic properties have established entomopathogenic nematodes as supreme biocontrol agents of insects as well as excellent models to simulate and dissect the molecular and physiological bases of conserved strategies employed by parasitic nematodes that cause infectious diseases in humans. The extreme infectivity of entomopathogenic nematodes is due in part to the presence of certain species of Gram-negative bacteria that live in mutualistic symbiosis during the infective juvenile stage, which forms the central part of the nematode life cycle. Both nematodes and their mutualistic bacteria are capable of interfering and undermining several aspects of the insect host innate immune system during the infection process. The mutualistic bacteria are also able to modulate other biological functions in their nematode host including growth, development, and reproduction. In this review, we will focus our attention on the mutualistic relationship between entomopathogenic nematodes and their associated bacteria to discuss the nature and distinct characteristics of the regulatory mechanisms, and their molecular as well as physiological components that control this specific biological partnership.","Eleftherianos, Ioannis; Heryanto, Christa",Results Probl Cell Differ,233,33

However, data are limited on how SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, enters and spreads in a population. METHODS: We targeted testing to persons living in Iceland who were at high risk for infection (mainly those who were symptomatic, had recently traveled to high-risk countries, or had contact with infected persons). We also carried out population screening using two strategies: issuing an open invitation to 10,797 persons and sending random invitations to 2283 persons. We sequenced SARS-CoV-2 from 643 samples. RESULTS: As of April 4, a total of 1221 of 9199 persons (13.3%) who were recruited for targeted testing had positive results for infection with SARS-CoV-2. Of those tested in the general population, 87 (0.8%) in the open-invitation screening and 13 (0.6%) in the random-population screening tested positive for the virus. In total, 6% of the population was screened. Most persons in the targeted-testing group who received positive tests early in the study had recently traveled internationally, in contrast to those who tested positive later in the study. Children under 10 years of age were less likely to receive a positive result than were persons 10 years of age or older, with percentages of 6.7% and 13.7%, respectively, for targeted testing; in the population screening, no child under 10 years of age had a positive result, as compared with 0.8% of those 10 years of age or older. Fewer females than males received positive results both in targeted testing (11.0% vs. 16.7%) and in population screening (0.6% vs. 0.9%). The haplotypes of the sequenced SARS-CoV-2 viruses were diverse and changed over time. The percentage of infected participants that was determined through population screening remained stable for the 20-day duration of screening. CONCLUSIONS: In a population-based study in Iceland, children under 10 years of age and females had a lower incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection than adolescents or adults and males. The proportion of infected persons identified through population screening did not change substantially during the screening period, which was consistent with a beneficial effect of containment efforts.

There are no reports of seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in these patients. AIMS: To investigate prevalence of COVID-19 cases and seroprevalence among rheumatologic patients and the risk factors for infection. METHODS: A cross-sectional study in a rheumatologic population. An online questionnaire was sent on 31 April 2020. Blood samples from 20% sample of patients were drawn for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Patients were divided based on autoimmune (AI) diagnosis. Prevalence of COVID-19 by nasopharyngeal swab and by serology (seroprevalence) was compared to national data. Risk factors for infection of SARS-CoV-2 were assessed. RESULTS: The study group included 1204 patients, 74.5% had an AI diagnosis. The prevalence of COVID-19 was 0.16% in the rheumatologic patient population and 0.22% in the AI group, which was not different from prevalence in Israel on 4 May 2020 (0.18%, P = 0.912 and P = 0.759 respectively). Serologic tests were performed in 242 patients, of which five were found positive pointing to a seroprevalence of 2.07%. Exposure to a known COVID-19 patient was the only significant risk factor for being positive by swab or by serology. AI diagnosis, immunosuppression, corticosteroid, hydroxychloroquine did not influence the risk. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of COVID-19 in a population of rheumatologic patients was similar to that of the general population. Mild/asymptomatic cases may be prevalent according to serologic tests. The major risk factor for infection is exposure to a known case of COVID-19, and immunosuppression did not play a role in the risk of infection.","Eviatar, Tali; Elalouf, Ofir; Furer, Victoria; Goldstein-Lahat, Yael; Paran, Yael; Pel, Sara; Nevo, Sharon; Zisapel, Michael; Alcalay, Yifat; Elkayam, Ori",Intern Med J,233,21

Most cases are in Mainland China with international spread to 25 countries. The novelty of the virus, the rapid national and international spread, and the lack of therapeutic and preventative strategies have led the WHO International Health Regulation emergency committee to declare the disease as Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on January 30, 2020.

Depending on the control group used, cytokines have been found to be higher, similar or even lower in COVID-19 compared to critical illnesses associated with elevated cytokine concentrations. However, most of these studies do not take into account critical illness severity. Hence, we decided to compare cytokine levels in critically-ill COVID-19 patients and critically-ill patients of a general intensive care unit (ICU), who did not have sepsis or septic shock, but had an equal disease severity. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-10 and tumour necrosis factor-&#945; (TNF-&#945;) were measured on ICU admission in mechanically ventilated, COVID-19 (N=36) and non-COVID-19 (N=30) patients, who had not received dexamethasone, and had equal critical illness severity. Non-COVID-19 patients did not have sepsis or septic shock. RESULTS: In our case control study, circulating IL-6 and IL-10 were lower, while TNF-&#945; and IL-8 levels were higher in critically-ill COVID-19 patients, compared to critically-ill non-COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSION: It is difficult to infer whether the cytokine storm seen in COVID-19 differs from other critical conditions.

To address these questions, we conducted a longitudinal survey among European and American respondents. Wave 1 (N = 501) was conducted on March 27, 2020 and Wave 2 (N = 326) on July 1, 2020. We assessed COVID-19 knowledge, endorsement of COVID-19 conspiracy theories, media use, Need for Cognition (NC), Need for Cognitive Closure (NCC), and self-reported adherence to governmental measures taken. Results showed that nearly three-quarters of our respondents actively searched for information about COVID-19. Most at least once a day. Information seeking behaviour was not influenced by cognitive motivation (i.e., NC and NCC). However, cognitive motivation was related to (1) knowledge about COVID-19, (2) conspiracy rejection, and (3) change in knowledge over time. Respondents with more knowledge on COVID-19 also indicated to adhere more often to measures taken by their government. Self-reported adherence to measures was not influenced by cognitive motivation. Implications of these findings will be discussed.","Boot, Arnout B; Eerland, Anita; Jongerling, Joran; Verkoeijen, Peter P J L; Zwaan, Rolf A",Sci Rep,233,20

This concern is fueled by limited available studies on this subject. In this study, we tested our hypothesis that HFNC treatment is not associated with increased aerosol formation as compared to conventional oxygen therapy. METHODS: We used laser light scattering and a handheld particle counter to detect and quantify aerosols in healthy subjects and in adults with acute respiratory disease, including COVID-19, during HFNC or conventional oxygen therapy. RESULTS: The use of HFNC was not associated with increased formation of aerosols as compared to conventional oxygen therapy in both healthy subjects (n = 3) and subjects with acute respiratory disease, including COVID-19 (n = 17). CONCLUSIONS: In line with scarce previous clinical and experimental findings, our results indicate that HFNC itself does not result in overall increased aerosol formation as compared to conventional oxygen therapy. This suggests there is no increased risk of respiratory pathogen transmission to health care workers during HFNC.","Bem, Reinout A; van Mourik, Niels; Klein-Blommert, Rozalinde; Spijkerman, Ingrid Jb; Kooij, Stefan; Bonn, Daniel; Vlaar, Alexander P",Respir Care,233,26

All maternity services have undertaken significant changes in relation to policies, service delivery and practices and increased use of personal protective equipment. AIMS: The aim of this study was to explore and describe doctors' experiences of providing maternity care during the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia. METHODS: A national online survey followed by semi-structured interviews with a cohort of participants was conducted during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia (May-June 2020). Participants were recruited through social media networks. Eighty-six doctors completed the survey, and eight were interviewed. RESULTS: Almost all doctors reported rapid development of new guidelines and major changes to health service delivery. Professional colleges were the main source of new information about COVID-19. Most (89%) doctors felt sufficiently informed to care for women with COVID-19. Less than half of doctors felt changes would be temporary. Doctors described workforce disruptions with associated personal and professional impacts. The ability to access and process up-to-date, evidence-based information was perceived as important. Doctors acknowledged that altered models of care had increased pregnant women's anxiety and uncertainty. All doctors described silver linings from sector changes. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides unique insights into doctors' experiences of providing maternity care during the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia. Findings have immediate relevance to the maternity sector now and into the future. Lessons learnt provide an opportunity to reshape the maternity sector to better prepare for future public health crises.","Szabo, Rebecca A; Wilson, Alyce N; Homer, Caroline; Vasilevski, Vidanka; Sweet, Linda; Wynter, Karen; Hauck, Yvonne; Kuliukas, Lesley; Bradfield, Zoe",Aust.

Yet, the question regarding the possible role of these arthropods as SARS-CoV-2 passive/biological transmission vectors is still poorly explored. In this study, we performed in silico structural and binding energy calculations to assess the risks associated with possible ectoparasite transmission. We found sufficient similarity between ectoparasite ACE and human ACE2 protein sequences to build good quality 3D-models of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike:ACE complex to assess the impacts of ectoparasite mutations on complex stability. For several species (e.g., water flea, deer tick, body louse), our analyses showed no significant destabilisation of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike:ACE complex, suggesting these species would bind the viral Spike protein. Our structural analyses also provide structural rationale for interactions between the viral Spike and the ectoparasite ACE proteins. Although we do not have experimental evidence of infection in these ectoparasites, the predicted stability of the complex suggests this is possible, raising concerns of a possible role in passive transmission of the virus to their human hosts.","Lam, Su Datt; Ashford, Paul; Díaz-Sánchez, Sandra; Villar, Margarita; Gortázar, Christian; de la Fuente, José; Orengo, Christine",Viruses,233,16

Methods We investigated a cohort of 12,863 UK Biobank community-dwelling individuals &gt; 65 years old (1814 individuals &gt;= 80 years old) tested for COVID-19. Individuals were stratified by age to account for age as a confounder. Risk factors were analyzed for COVID-19-positive diagnosis, hospitalization, and death. Results All-cause dementia, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and Parkinson's disease (PD) were associated with COVID-19-positive diagnosis, and all-cause dementia and AD remained associated in individuals &gt;= 80 years old. All-cause dementia, AD, or PD were not risk factors for overall hospitalization, but increased the risk of hospitalization of COVID-19 patients. All-cause dementia and AD increased the risk of COVID-19-related death, and all-cause dementia was uniquely associated with increased death in &gt;= 80-year-old patients.

Data collection took place from mid-January through July, with half of the interviews being completed in the first three months of the year. Most of the key metrics that we measure-including premiums and cost sharing-reflect employers' decisions made before the full impacts of the pandemic were felt. We found that in 2020 the average annual premium for single coverage rose 4 percent, to $7,470, and the average annual premium for family coverage also rose 4 percent, to $21,342. Covered workers, on average, contributed 17 percent of the cost for single coverage and 27 percent of the cost for family coverage. Fifty-six percent of firms offered health benefits to at least some of their workers, and 64 percent of workers were covered at their own firm.

This study assesses COVID-19's impact on ophthalmology gender authorship distribution and compares the gender authorship proportion of COVID-19 ophthalmology-related articles to previous ophthalmology articles. METHODS: This cohort study includes authors listed in all publications related to ophthalmology in the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset and CDC COVID-19 research database. Articles from 65 ophthalmology journals from January to July 2020 were selected. All previous articles published in the same journals were extracted from PubMed. Gender-API determined authors' gender. RESULTS: Out of 119,457 COVID-19-related articles, we analyzed 528 ophthalmology-related articles written by 2518 authors. Women did not exceed 40% in any authorship positions and were most likely to be middle, first, and finally, last authors. The proportions of women in all authorship positions from the 2020 COVID-19 group (29.6% first, 31.5% middle, 22.1% last) are significantly lower compared to the predicted 2020 data points (37.4% first, 37.0% middle, 27.6% last) (p < .01). The gap between the proportion of female authors in COVID-19 ophthalmology research and the 2020 ophthalmology-predicted proportion (based on 2002-2019 data) is 6.1% for overall authors, 7.8% for first authors, and 5.5% for last and middle authors. The 2020 COVID-19 authorship group (1925 authors) was also compared to the 2019 group (33,049 authors) based on journal category (clinical/basic science research, general/subspecialty ophthalmology, journal impact factor).

We evaluated whether ambulance dispatch calls of highest urgency reflect the circulation of influenza A virus, influenza B virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus, adenovirus, coronavirus, parainfluenzavirus and human metapneumovirus (hMPV). METHODS: We analysed calls from four ambulance call centres serving 25% of the population in the Netherlands (2014-2016). The chief symptom and urgency level is recorded during triage; we restricted our analysis to calls with the highest urgency and identified those compatible with a respiratory syndrome. We modelled the relation between respiratory syndrome calls (RSC) and respiratory virus trends using binomial regression with identity link function. RESULTS: We included 211 739 calls, of which 15 385 (7.3%) were RSC. Proportion of RSC showed periodicity with winter peaks and smaller interseasonal increases. Overall, 15% of RSC were attributable to respiratory viruses (20% in out-of-office hour calls). There was large variation by age group: in <15 years, only RSV was associated and explained 11% of RSC; in 15-64 years, only influenza A (explained 3% of RSC); and in &#8805;65 years adenovirus explained 9% of RSC, distributed throughout the year, and hMPV (4%) and influenza A (1%) mainly during the winter peaks. Additionally, rhinovirus was associated with total RSC. CONCLUSION: High urgency ambulance dispatches reflect the burden of different respiratory viruses and might be useful to monitor the respiratory season overall. Influenza plays a smaller role than other viruses: RSV is important in children while adenovirus and hMPV are the biggest contributors to emergency calls in the elderly.","Monge, Susana; Duijster, Janneke; Kommer, Geert Jan; van de Kassteele, Jan; Krafft, Thomas; Engelen, Paul; Valk, Jens P; de Waard, Jan; de Nooij, Jan; Riezebos-Brilman, Annelies; van der Hoek, Wim; van Asten, Liselotte",Influenza Other Respir Viruses,233,23

Effective biosurveillance systems can primarily support appropriate responses to biological threats and consequently save human lives. Nevertheless, biosurveillance systems are costly to implement and hard to operate. Furthermore, they rely on static infrastructures that might not cope with the evolving dynamics of the monitored environment. In this paper, we present a reorganizing biosurveillance framework for the detection and localization of biological threats with fog and mobile edge computing support. In the proposed framework, a hierarchy of fog nodes are responsible for aggregating monitoring data within their regions and detecting potential threats. Although fog nodes are deployed on a fixed base station infrastructure, the framework provides an innovative technique for reorganizing the monitored environment structure to adapt to the evolving environmental conditions and to overcome the limitations of the static base station infrastructure. Evaluation results illustrate the ability of the framework to localize biological threats and detect infected areas. Moreover, the results show the effectiveness of the reorganization mechanisms in adjusting the environment structure to cope with the highly dynamic environment.","Al-Zinati, Mohammad; Alrashdan, Reem; Al-Duwairi, Basheer; Aloqaily, Moayad",Multimed Tools Appl,233,25

In addition, individuals with DS demonstrate pronounced speech and language deficits. However, little is known about the linguistic correlates of impaired adaptive functioning in DS. Method Using the Adaptive Behavior Assessment System-Second Edition and the Children's Communication Checklist-Second Edition (CCC-2), this study investigated the unique variance in adaptive skills accounted for by speech and language impairments in individuals with DS (N = 29, M age = 13.46). Results Pearson correlations revealed that a composite of CCC-2 structural language scales, but not pragmatic language scales, was significantly correlated with the Adaptive Behavior Assessment System-Second Edition Global Adaptive Composite, Conceptual, and Practical domains. Further investigation utilizing hierarchical regression analyses identified only the Speech scale on the CCC-2 as contributing unique variance to the prediction of adaptive behavior scores in the Global Adaptive Composite, Conceptual, and Practical domains. Conclusion Speech impairments may serve as flags to identify children with DS who are at risk for adaptive behavior deficits and reinforce the need for speech-language therapies that focus on speech for these individuals.

Published guidance documents vary in their recommendations for monitoring and managing these potential adverse effects. Accordingly, we set out to conduct a systematic review of the arrhythmogenic effect of short courses of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine. We searched on MEDLINE and Embase, as well as in the gray literature up to April 17, 2020, for the risk of QT prolongation, torsades, ventricular arrhythmia, and sudden death with short-term chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine usage. This search resulted in 390 unique records, of which 41 were ultimately selected for qualitative synthesis and which included data on 1515 COVID-19 patients. Approximately 10% of COVID-19 patients treated with these drugs developed QT prolongation. We found evidence of ventricular arrhythmia in 2 COVID-19 patients from a group of 28 treated with high-dose chloroquine. Limitations of these results are unclear follow-up and possible publication/reporting bias, but there is compelling evidence that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine induce significant QT-interval prolongation and potentially increase the risk of arrhythmia.

In this study, we observed that MERS-CoV nucleocapsid (N) protein suppresses type I and type III IFN gene expression. The N protein suppresses Sendai virus-induced IFN-ß and IFN-&#955;1 by reducing their promoter activity and mRNA levels, as well as downstream IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) is known to recognize viral RNA and induce IFN expression through tripartite motif-containing protein 25 (TRIM25)-mediated ubiquitination of RIG-I caspase activation and recruitment domains (CARDs). We discovered that MERS-CoV N protein suppresses RIG-I-CARD-induced, but not MDA5-CARD-induced, IFN-ß and IFN-&#955;1 promoter activity. By interacting with TRIM25, N protein impedes RIG-I ubiquitination and activation and inhibits the phosphorylation of transcription factors IFN-regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and NF-&#954;B that are known to be important for IFN gene activation. By employing a recombinant Sindbis virus-EGFP replication system, we showed that viral N protein downregulated the production of not only IFN mRNA but also bioactive IFN proteins. Taken together, MERS-CoV N protein functions as an IFN antagonist. It suppresses RIG-I-induced type I and type III IFN production by interfering with TRIM25-mediated RIG-I ubiquitination. Our study sheds light on the pathogenic mechanism of how MERS-CoV causes disease.IMPORTANCE MERS-CoV causes death of about 35% of patients. Published studies showed that some coronaviruses are capable of suppressing interferon (IFN) expression in the early phase of infection and MERS-CoV proteins can modulate host immune response. In this study, we demonstrated that MERS-CoV nucleocapsid (N) protein suppresses the production of both type I and type III IFNs via sequestering TRIM25, an E3 ubiquitin ligase that is essential for activating the RIG-I signaling pathway. Ectopic expression of TRIM25 rescues the suppressive effect of the N protein. In addition, the C-terminal domain of the viral N protein plays a pivotal role in the suppression of IFN-ß promoter activity. Our findings reveal how MERS-CoV evades innate immunity and provide insights into the interplay between host immune response and viral pathogenicity.","Chang, Chi-You; Liu, Helene Minyi; Chang, Ming-Fu; Chang, Shin C",J. virol,233,2

He underwent liver transplantation 4 years earlier due to HCV and NASH-related cirrhosis with hepatocellular carcinoma. At admission he was in reduced general conditions. Nasopharyngeal smear specimen resulted positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Pulmonary low-dose CT-scan revealed bilateral subpleural ground-glass infiltrates. O2 saturation was 93%. A treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine twice daily was started. The patient received also cefepime and remained in isolation. Seven days later imaging showed a progression of the pulmonary infiltrates. Cefepime was replaced by meropenem. During the following 3 days the fever resolved, and the general conditions of the patient significantly improved. Consequently, treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine was stopped.

The safety profile of mRNA-based vaccines in patients with autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic diseases (AIIRD) is unknown. The objective of this report is to raise awareness to reactivation of herpes zoster (HZ) following the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination in patients with AIIRD. METHODS: The safety of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination was assessed in an observational study monitoring post-vaccination adverse effects in patients with AIIRD (n = 491) and controls (n = 99), conducted in two Rheumatology Departments in Israel. RESULTS: The prevalence of HZ was 1.2% (n = 6) in patients with AIIRD compared with none in controls. Six female patients aged 49 ± 11 years with stable AIIRD: rheumatoid arthritis (n = 4), Sjogren's syndrome (n = 1), and undifferentiated connective disease (n = 1), developed the first in a lifetime event of HZ within a short time after the first vaccine dose in 5 cases and after the second vaccine dose in one case. In the majority of cases, HZ infection was mild, except a case of HZ ophthalmicus, without corneal involvement, in RA patient treated with tofacitinib. There were no cases of disseminated HZ disease or postherpetic neuralgia. All but one patient received antiviral treatment with a resolution of HZ-related symptoms up to 6 weeks. Five patients completed the second vaccine dose without other adverse effects.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 binds angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 of the rennin-angiotensin system, resulting in hypokalemia. Objective: To investigate the prevalence, causes, and clinical implications of hypokalemia, including its possible association with treatment outcomes, among patients with COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study was conducted at Wenzhou Central Hospital and Sixth People's Hospital of Wenzhou, Wenzhou, China, from January 11, 2020, to February 15, 2020. Participants included patients who received a diagnosis of COVID-19 according to the criteria issued by the Chinese Health Bureau and were admitted to the hospital. The patients were classified as having severe hypokalemia (plasma potassium <3 mmol/L), hypokalemia (plasma potassium 3-3.5 mmol/L), and normokalemia (plasma potassium >3.5 mmol/L). The clinical features, therapy, and outcomes were compared between the 3 groups. Data analysis was conducted in March 2020. Interventions: The patients were given general support and antiviral therapy. Their epidemiological and clinical features were collected. Main Outcomes and Measures: The prevalence of hypokalemia and response to treatment with potassium supplements were measured by analyzing plasma and urine potassium levels. Results: One hundred seventy-five patients (87 female patients [50%]; mean [SD] age, 45 [14] years) were classified as having severe hypokalemia (31 patients [18%]), hypokalemia (64 patients [37%]), and normokalemia (80 patients [46%]). Patients with severe hypokalemia had statistically significantly higher body temperature (mean [SD], 37.6 °C [0.9 °C]) than the patients with hypokalemia (mean [SD], 37.2 °C [0.7 °C]; difference, 0.4 °C; 95% CI, 0.2-0.6 °C; P = .02) and the patients with normokalemia (mean [SD], 37.1 °C [0.8 °C]; difference, 0.5 °C; 95% CI, 0.3-0.7 °C; P = .005). Patients with higher levels of hypokalemia also had higher creatine kinase levels (severe hypokalemia, mean [SD], 200 [257] U/L [median, 113 U/L; interquartile range {IQR}, 61-242 U/L]; hypokalemia, mean [SD], 97 [85] U/L; and normokalemia, mean [SD], 82 [57] U/L), higher creatine kinase-MB fraction (severe hypokalemia, mean [SD], 32 [39] U/L [median, 14 U/L; IQR, 11-36 U/L]; hypokalemia, mean [SD], 18 [15] U/L; and normokalemia, mean [SD], 15 [8] U/L), higher lactate dehydrogenase levels (mean [SD], severe hypokalemia, 256 [88] U/L; hypokalemia, 212 [59] U/L; and normokalemia, 199 [61] U/L), and higher C-reactive protein levels (severe hypokalemia, mean [SD], 29 [23] mg/L; hypokalemia, mean [SD], 18 [20] mg/L [median, 12, mg/L; IQR, 4-25 mg/L]; and normokalemia, mean [SD], 15 [18] mg/L [median, 6 U/L; IQR, 3-17 U/L]). Of 40 severely and critically ill patients, 34 (85%) had hypokalemia. Patients with severe hypokalemia were given potassium at a dose of 40 mEq per day, for a total mean (SD) of 453 (53) mEq potassium chloride, during the hospital stay. The patients responded well to potassium supplements as they recovered. Conclusions and Relevance: The correction of hypokalemia is challenging because of continuous renal potassium loss resulting from the degradation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. The high prevalence of hypokalemia among patients with COVID-19 suggests the presence of disordered rennin-angiotensin system activity, which increases as a result of reduced counteractivity of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, which is bound by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.","Chen, Dong; Li, Xiaokun; Song, Qifa; Hu, Chenchan; Su, Feifei; Dai, Jianyi; Ye, Yinghai; Huang, Jianping; Zhang, Xiaoming",JAMA Netw Open,233,16

Since its emergence, the novel coronavirus has rapidly achieved pandemic proportions causing remarkably increased morbidity and mortality around the world. A hypercoagulability state has been reported as a major pathologic event in COVID-19, and thromboembolic complications listed among life-threatening complications of the disease. Platelets are chief effector cells of hemostasis and pathological thrombosis. However, the participation of platelets in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 remains elusive. This report demonstrates that increased platelet activation and platelet-monocyte aggregate formation are observed in severe COVID-19 patients, but not in patients presenting mild COVID-19 syndrome. In addition, exposure to plasma from severe COVID-19 patients increased the activation of control platelets ex vivo. In our cohort of COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit, platelet-monocyte interaction was strongly associated with tissue factor (TF) expression by the monocytes. Platelet activation and monocyte TF expression were associated with markers of coagulation exacerbation as fibrinogen and D-dimers, and were increased in patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation or patients who evolved with in-hospital mortality. Finally, platelets from severe COVID-19 patients were able to induce TF expression ex vivo in monocytes from healthy volunteers, a phenomenon that was inhibited by platelet P-selectin neutralization or integrin &#945;IIb/ß3 blocking with the aggregation inhibitor abciximab.

The results showed an increase in the consumption of bakery products, instant meals and fast food, while the consumption of vegetables and fruits decreased (P < 0·005). There was a significant increase in the frequency of consumption of alcoholic beverages (P < 0·001), but a reduction in the dose (P < 0·001), increased frequency of smoking (P = 0·007), an increase in sleep and screen time in hours and decrease in physical activity (P < 0·001). CONCLUSIONS: It was possible to observe an increase in screen time, hours of sleep, smoking and drinking frequency. On the other hand, there was a reduction in the dose of alcoholic beverages but also in the practice of physical activity. Eating habits also changed, reducing the performance of daytime meals and increasing the performance of nighttime meals. The frequency of consumption of instant meals and fast food has increased, while consumption of fruits and vegetables has decreased.","Souza, Tamires Cm; Oliveira, Lívya A; Daniel, Marina M; Ferreira, Lívia G; Della Lucia, Ceres M; Liboredo, Juliana C; Anastácio, Lucilene R",Public Health Nutr,233,16

The brief analysis reveals that agricultural access to bulk ocean freight, rail movement, and trucking has generally improved in the pandemic, bolstered by the reduced demand for these transportation services by other sectors of the economy. The intermodal containerized movement of grains and food products has seen some disruption from the lack of empty containers in North America. The widespread consumer adoption of physical distancing measures has vastly increased the demand for retail food pickup and delivery services to the point where these services are being rationed by long wait times. From a policy perspective, there is an apparent need for (a) continued supply chain monitoring and industry engagement, (b) the proactive development of strategies to deal with absenteeism and other potential threats to the supply chain, and (c) an assessment of the economic and health merits of providing additional public resources to provide greater access to grocery pickup and delivery services.","Gray, Richard S.",Can.

Stress is known to have a negative impact on parent–child feeding interactions;hence, the purpose of this study is to examine how COVID-related parenting stress, which was measured using a newly developed scale, is related to parent mental health, nonresponsive feeding, and children’s self-regulation of eating. 119 parents of children ages 2–7 years old filled out questions about COVID-related parenting stress, mental health, nonresponsive feeding behaviors, and children’s self-regulation of eating. A series of multiple regressions were run to predict parent anxiety and psychological distress from COVID-related parenting stress. COVID-related parenting stress was found to be a significant predictor of both parent anxiety and psychological distress. When COVID-related parenting stress was further broken down into COVID-Related Job/Financial Security Stress and COVID-Related Family Safety/Stability Stress, COVID-Related Job/Financial Security Stress predicted psychological distress while COVID-Related Family Safety/Stability Stress predicted parent anxiety. Moderation analyses were also run to test the difference across the parents of children under 5 years of age and those of children who were 5 years of age and older regarding the association of COVID-related parenting stress and either parent anxiety or psychological distress. There was no significant difference across age. Lastly, COVID-related parenting stress and nonresponsive feeding practices were simultaneously entered into a multiple regression to predict children’s self-regulation of eating, and COVID-related parenting stress and parent distrust in appetite were both found to decrease children’s ability to self-regulate energy intake. Based on findings from this study, researchers interested in improving children’s self-regulation of eating and long-term health outcomes should continue to target the reduction of nonresponsive parent feeding behaviors, but they should also aim to look beyond specific parent feeding behaviors by attempting to help parents manage stressors in their lives.

Design/methodology/approach: This conceptual paper seeks to foster the debate on the crucial role of risk reporting considering the impact and uncertainty caused by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and stakeholder information needs in this context. The authors draw upon neo-Durkheimian institutional and legitimacy theories and elements of the accounting and risk management literature to discuss the challenges that the pandemic poses to risk recognition and assessment and the subsequent disclosure decision of risk information. Findings: Risk reporting has its roots in risk recognition and assessment. To live up to their accountability in these times of uncertainty, organisations need to address their stakeholders' new and changing information needs. Ad hoc disclosures and linking risk management and reporting to their business models (BM) would improve the risk recognition and assessment practices and the meaningfulness of the disclosed information. Hence, we provide some examples and discuss potential avenues to address these challenges and adapt risk reporting accordingly. Originality/value: This conceptual paper contributes to the risk reporting and accountability research fields. Previous studies on communication during a crisis have focused on sustainability reporting. Thus, this study contributes to that literature by considering the role of risk reporting in times of an unexpected large-scale global crisis, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and by highlighting possibilities for moving risk reporting towards becoming more accountability based. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Crovini, C.; Schaper, S.; Simoni, L.","Accounting, Auditing and Accountability Journal",233,29

Six experimental conditions that combine hand appearances (abstract, mannequin, and realistic) and tactile feedback (tactile and no tactile) levels were examined. The results of our study indicated that: (1) the more realistic hand had a stronger effect on tactile sensation and external appearance, while the mannequin hand was associated with a greater ownership effect;(2) tactile feedback was associated with a stronger effect on external appearance compared to no tactile feedback;(3) the realistic hand model in conjunction with tactile feedback significantly affected the tactile sensation of the participants;(4) the participants in the lab setting rated the external appearance of the realistic hand model higher than the remote participants;(5) the participants exposed for less than one hour per week to VR rated the tactile sensation in the presence of tactile feedback higher, while they similarly rated the external appearance of the virtual hand model in the presence of a realistic hand model higher when compared to those who were exposed for more than one hour per week to VR;and finally, (6) the younger participants rated the tactile sensation higher than the older participants in the presence of the realistic hand model.

Accordingly, the Mostadam rating system for existing and new buildings was recently launched to achieve appropriate, sustainable building standards. In the medical field, sustainable healthcare facilities are an extension of the concept of sustainable buildings in terms of important sustainable healthcare parameters. Therefore, the sustainable development of healthcare facilities has great impacts on growing economic, social and environmental issues, which, in turn, improve Saudi society’s public health. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic has further exposed the urgent need for sustainable healthcare facilities to control the outbreak of such dangerous pandemics. Accordingly, the retrofitting of the existing healthcare facilities and the shift toward new sustainable ones have become an important objective of many countries worldwide. Currently, the concepts related to sustainable healthcare facilities are rapidly varying their scopes toward wider perspectives. Therefore, a new local rating system for healthcare facilities based on the potential and resources of sustainable healthcare facilities in Saudi Arabia should be developed. The present paper investigates the development of a new version of the Mostadam rating system, known here as “Mostadam-HCF”, in relation to the local Mostadam rating system and in accordance with the LEED version 4.1 (BD + C: Health-care). This important step can help the existing and the new healthcare facilities in Saudi Arabia to obtain, firstly, national accreditation and, consequently, to be internationally accredited. Moreover, the initiative of sustainable healthcare facilities can also help in fighting the current COVID-19 pandemic and the other possible future viruses in Saudi Arabia.","Balabel, Ashraf Alwetaishi Mamdooh",Sustainability,233,23

Its development is often triggered by viral infections, such as influenza A virus, but it is unclear whether it is also triggered by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). We aimed to investigated the association between SARS-CoV-2 and SCLS.Method: We present the case of a 55-year-old-woman affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection who developed SCLS. Moreover, we performed a systematic review of the literature to identify any common features with other cases and to describe clinical characteristics and outcomes.Results: We found three other cases of SCLS occurring during SARS-CoV-2 infection in 2020. Taking all cases together, the mean age was 50 years (range 38-63), with a 1:1 gender ratio. Respiratory manifestations were the most common symptom, and all patients required admission to the intensive care unit. The mortality rate was 50%.Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 infection may trigger SCLS disease, either by an overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines or by direct viral infection of the endothelium. Since SCLS may have a poor prognosis, in every SARS-CoV-2-infected patient presenting the suggestive triad of hypovolaemic shock, haemoconcentration, and hypoproteinaemia, an SCLS diagnosis should be considered and early treatment initiated.","Beber, A; Dellai, F; Abdel Jaber, M; Peterlana, D; Brunori, G; Maino, A",Scand J Rheumatol,233,21

The conserved structural and nucleotide sequence elements of these NCRs and their function in RNA replication and translation are the subjects of this chapter. The 5´ and 3´ NCRs play a role in the initiation of negative-strand synthesis on virus RNA released from entering virions, switching from negative-strand synthesis to synthesis of progeny plus strand RNA at late times after infection, and possibly in the initiation of translation and in the packaging of virus plus strand RNA into particles. The presence of conserved and nonconserved complementary nucleotide sequences near the 5´ and 3´ termini of flavivirus genomes suggests that ‘‘panhandle’’ or circular RNA structures are formed transiently by hydrogen bonding at some stage during RNA replication.","Markoff, Lewis",Adv Virus Res,233,16

METHODS: The epidemic data of three hospitals, randomly selected from different administrative regions of Wuhan, were analyzed retrospectively from 23 January to 31 March 2020. Changes in the number of confirmed cases per day (cumulative and new) of each region were tracked as a reflection of changing epidemic risk levels. The risk level map was drawn. The epidemic status, treatment protocols, and treatment efficiencies for patients with closed fracture in the three hospitals were compared. RESULTS: Overall, 138 patients with closed fracture were admitted. Each hospital had established its own protocol, according to the initial perceived risk. Based on the risk level map, over the study period, the risk levels of the three regions changed independently and were not in sync. All patients recovered and were timely discharged. No staff member was detected with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 risk level of each area is dynamic. To optimize medical resources, avoid cross-infection, and improve efficiency, changes in epidemic risk should be monitored. For patients with closed fracture, treatment protocols should be adjusted according to changes in epidemic risk.","He, Yu; Guo, Zhong-Hua; Wu, Yong-Guang; Li, Rui; Xie, Xie; Fu, De-Hao",BMC Musculoskelet Disord,233,17

We model the global pattern of reported COVID-19 cases during the primary response period, with the aim of learning from the past to prepare for the future. METHODS: Using Bayesian methods, we analyse the response to the COVID-19 outbreak for 158 countries for the period 22 January to 9 June 2020. This encompasses the period in which many countries imposed a variety of response measures and initial relaxation strategies. Instead of modelling specific intervention types and timings for each country explicitly, we adopt a stochastic epidemiological model including a feedback mechanism on virus transmission to capture complex nonlinear dynamics arising from continuous changes in community behaviour in response to rising case numbers. We analyse the overall effect of interventions and community responses across diverse regions. This approach mitigates explicit consideration of issues such as period of infectivity and public adherence to government restrictions. RESULTS: Countries with the largest cumulative case tallies are characterised by a delayed response, whereas countries that avoid substantial community transmission during the period of study responded quickly. Countries that recovered rapidly also have a higher case identification rate and small numbers of undocumented community transmission at the early stages of the outbreak. We also demonstrate that uncertainty in numbers of undocumented infections dramatically impacts the risk of multiple waves. Our approach is also effective at pre-empting potential flare-ups. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate the utility of modelling to interpret community behaviour in the early epidemic stages. Two lessons learnt that are important for the future are: i) countries that imposed strict containment measures early in the epidemic fared better with respect to numbers of reported cases; and ii) broader testing is required early in the epidemic to understand the magnitude of undocumented infections and recover rapidly. We conclude that clear patterns of containment are essential prior to relaxation of restrictions and show that modelling can provide insights to this end.

This case is an example of the clinical challenge related to pediatric NIV masks in the PICU, but also shows the potential of alternative NIV interfaces e.g., by using a widely available and relatively cheap simple anesthetic mask. Further personalized strategies (e.g., by using 3D scanning and printing techniques) that optimize NIV mask fitting in children are warranted.","Muller, Gerrit J.; Hovenier, Renee; Spijker, Jip; van Gestel, Monica; Klein-Blommert, Rozalinde; Markhorst, Dick; Dijkman, Coen; Bem, Reinout A.",Front Pediatr,233,20

We sought to understand the phenomenon of transcendent experiences. We spoke with 67 pilgrims including assisted pilgrims, young volunteers and medical staff. About two in five reported a transcendent experience: some felt they had communicated or had close contact with a divine presence, while others reported a powerful experience of something intangible and otherworldly. Transcendent experiences are an important feature of pilgrimage to Lourdes and the place offers the faithful a means of connecting with the divine, with nature and with the self.","Rahtz, Emmylou; Warber, Sara L.; Goldingay, Sarah; Dieppe, Paul",J Relig Health,233,26

Although canine CV has been identified and characterized in southern China in recent years, its epidemiology in other regions of China and its precise molecular characteristics have not been examined. In this study, we examined 141 fecal specimens collected from domestic dogs with or without diarrhea in Heilongjiang province, Northeastern China, during 2014 to 2016. A total of 18 out of 141 samples were found to be positive for canine CV by real-time quantitative PCR. In the diarrhea samples, canine CV was detected in coinfections with canine parvovirus 2. More importantly, two different canine CV strains were detected in one sample. Five canine CV genomes were successfully amplified. Sequence analysis showed that there were two unique amino acid changes in the Rep protein (N39S in the K1 strain, and T71A in the XF16 strain). Phylogenetic analysis indicated that canine CV could be divided into four genotypes, and specific nucleotide mutations could be used for confirming the four genotypes. Moreover, recombination analysis revealed that a total of eight recombination events were found in five genomic sequences. Molecular evolution analysis showed that the canine CV has been under purifying selection. This study provides evidence that at least three genotypes of canine CV are co-circulating in China. Continuous epidemiological surveillance is therefore necessary to understand their importance for the evolution of canine CV.

Prior studies revealed that undergraduates have many sexual behavior and emotion disorders, which may be impacted during an isolation period, such as the one brought by COVID-19. However, few studies have explored the longitudinal associations between COVID-19-related stress and sexual compulsivity symptoms (SCS), and the mediating effect of emotions (i.e., depression and anxiety) on this relationship. This longitudinal study aimed to investigate these associations. METHODS: We employed a cross-lagged design (2020/2/12: Time 1, 3219 participants; 2020/6/6: Time 2, 2998 participants) and recruited Chinese undergraduates through an online system to respond to a survey. RESULTS: Our results showed that COVID-19-related stress at Time 1 directly influenced SCS at Time 1, and there was an indirect influence via depression and anxiety at Time 1. COVID-19-related stress at Time 1 positively correlated with depression, anxiety, and SCS at Time 2, and the first could directly and positively predict SCS at Time 2. Moreover, albeit depression at Time 2 was negatively linked to SCS at Time 2, anxiety at Time 2 enhanced the effect of COVID-19-related stress on SCS. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings extend the literature on SCS, showing that the higher the COVID-19-related stress, the higher the SCS, and the longer-lasting effect was associated with anxiety in undergraduates. Furthermore, depression does not mediate the relationship between COVID-19-related stress and SCS.","Deng, Jianjun; Li, Tsingan; Wang, Jiali; Teng, Limei",BMC Psychiatry,233,2

Design Review of English publications in PubMed and Embase to April 6, 2020. Methods Manuscripts were screened for reports including coronavirus, reproduction, including pathophysiology and pregnancy. Intervention(s) None. Main Outcome Measure(s) Reproductive outcomes; effects on gametes; pregnancy outcomes; neonatal complications. Results Seventy-nine reports formed the basis of the review. Coronavirus binding to cells involves the S1 domain of the spike protein to receptors present in reproductive tissues, including angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), CD26, Ezrin, and cyclophilins. SARS-CoV-1 may cause severe orchitis leading to germ cell destruction in males. Reports indicate decreased sperm concentration and motility for 72-90 days following COVID-19 infection. Gonadotropin-dependent expression of ACE2 was found in human ovaries, but it is unclear whether SARS-CoV-2 adversely affects female gametogenesis. Evidence suggests that COVID-19 infection has a lower maternal case fatality rate than SARS or MERS, but anecdotal reports suggest that infected, asymptomatic women may develop respiratory symptoms postpartum. COVID-19 infections in pregnancy are associated with preterm delivery. Postpartum neonatal transmission from mother to child has been reported. Conclusion COVID-19 infection may adversely affect some pregnant women and their offspring.

We compared anxiety and depression symptoms, as indicators of psychological distress, before and during COVID-19, and investigated the role of partner, social network and healthcare support on COVID-19-related worries and consequently on psychological distress. A national survey, conducted during the first lockdown in The Netherlands, assessed COVID-19 experiences and psychological distress (N = 1421), whereas a comparison sample (N = 1439) was screened for psychological distress in 2017–2018. During COVID-19, the percentage of mothers scoring above the questionnaires’ clinical cut-offs doubled for depression (6% and 12%) and anxiety (24% and 52%). Women reported increased partner support during COVID-19, compared to pre-pandemic, but decreased social and healthcare support. Higher support resulted in lower COVID-19-related worries, which in turn contributed to less psychological distress. Results suggest that a global pandemic exerts a heavy toll on pregnant women’s mental health. Psychological distress was substantially higher during the pandemic than the pre-pandemic years. We identified a protective role of partner, social, and healthcare support, with important implications for the current and future crisis management. Whether increased psychological distress is transient or persistent, and whether and how it affects the future generation remains to be determined.","Vacaru, Stefania; Beijers, Roseriet; Browne, Pamela D.; Cloin, Mariëlle; van Bakel, Hedwig; van den Heuvel, Marion I.; de Weerth, Carolina",Sci Rep,233,1

Emergent disasters such as the COVID-19 pandemic disrupt already-strained harm reduction efforts and treatment availability. This study aims to answer three research questions. How do public health emergencies impact PWOUD? How can health systems respond to novel public health emergencies to serve PWOUD? How can the results of this scoping review be contextualized to the province of Alberta to inform local stakeholder responses to the pandemic? METHODS: We conducted a scoping review using the 6-stage Arksey and O’Malley framework to analyse early-pandemic and pre-pandemic disaster literature. The results of the scoping review were contextualized to the local pandemic response, through a Nominal Group Technique (NGT) process with frontline providers and stakeholders in Alberta, Canada. RESULTS: Sixty one scientific journal articles and 72 grey literature resources were included after full-text screening. Forty sources pertained to early COVID-19 responses, and 21 focused on OUD treatment during other disasters. PWOUD may be more impacted than the general population by common COVID-19 stressors including loss of income, isolation, lack of rewarding activities, housing instability, as well as fear and anxiety. They may also face unique challenges including threats to drug supplies, stigma, difficulty accessing clean substance use supplies, and closure of substance use treatment centres. All of these impacts put PWOUD at risk of negative outcomes including fatal overdose. Two NGT groups were held. One group (n = 7) represented voices from urban services, and the other (n = 4) Indigenous contexts. Stakeholders suggested that simultaneous attention to multiple crises, with adequate resources to allow attention to both social and health systems issues, can prepare a system to serve PWOUD during disasters. CONCLUSION: This scoping review and NGT study uncovers how disasters impact PWOUD and offers suggestions for better serving PWOUD.

Real-time RT-PCR assays for SARS-CoV2 detection can easily be adapted to different host species. U.S. veterinary diagnostic laboratories have used the CDC assays or other national reference laboratory methods to test animal samples. However, these methods have only been evaluated using internal validation protocols. To help the laboratories evaluate their SARS-CoV2 test methods, an interlaboratory comparison (ILC) was performed in collaboration with multiple organizations. Forty-four sets of 19 blind-coded RNA samples in Tris-EDTA (TE) buffer or PrimeStore transport medium were shipped to 42 laboratories. Results were analyzed according to the principles of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 16140-2:2016 standard. Qualitative assessment of PrimeStore samples revealed that, in approximately two-thirds of the laboratories, the limit of detection with a probability of 0.95 (LOD95) for detecting the RNA was &#8804;20 copies per PCR reaction, close to the theoretical LOD of 3 copies per reaction. This level of sensitivity is not expected in clinical samples because of additional factors, such as sample collection, transport, and extraction of RNA from the clinical matrix. Quantitative assessment of Ct values indicated that reproducibility standard deviations for testing the RNA with assays reported as N1 were slightly lower than those for N2, and they were higher for the RNA in PrimeStore medium than those in TE buffer. Analyst experience and the use of either a singleplex or multiplex PCR also affected the quantitative ILC test results.","Deng, Kaiping; Uhlig, Steffen; Ip, Hon S; Lea Killian, Mary; Goodman, Laura B; Nemser, Sarah; Ulaszek, Jodie; Pickens, Shannon; Newkirk, Robert; Kmet, Matthew; Frost, Kirstin; Hettwer, Karina; Colson, Bertrand; Nichani, Kapil; Schlierf, Anja; Tkachenko, Andriy; Reddy, Ravinder; Reimschuessel, Renate",J Vet Diagn Invest,233,26

We aim to identify the drivers of therapeutic aggressiveness during the first weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This cross-sectional worldwide survey (conducted April 12 to 19, 2020) was aimed at physicians who managed patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Treatment preferences were collected in five different clinical scenarios. We used multilevel mixed-effects ordered logistic regression to identify variables that were associated with the use of more aggressive therapies. FINDINGS: The survey was completed by 852 physicians from 44 different specialties and 29 countries. The heterogeneity of therapeutic decisions increased as the clinical scenario worsened. Factors associated with aggressive therapeutic decisions were higher self-perceived expertise (high vs. null, OR 1.95, 95%CI 1.31–2.89), perceived quality of COVID-19 publications (high vs. null, OR 1.92, 95%CI 1.17–3.16), and female sex (OR 1.17, 95%CI 1.02–1.33).

We have fully decoded the immune synapses for multiple TCRs from acute patients, including cognate peptides and the presenting HLA alleles. Furthermore, using a newly developed mammalian epitope display platform (MEDi), we determined that several mutations present in multiple viral isolates currently expanding across the globe, resulted in reduced presentation by multiple HLA class II alleles, while some increased presentation, suggesting immune evasion based on shifting MHC-II peptide presentation landscapes. In support, we found that one of the mutations present in B1.1.7 viral strain could cause escape from CD4 T cell recognition in this way. Given the importance of understanding such mechanisms more broadly, we used MEDi to generate a comprehensive analysis of the presentability of all SARS-CoV-2 peptides in the context of multiple common HLA class II molecules. Unlike other strategies, our approach is sensitive and scalable, providing an unbiased and affordable high-resolution map of peptide presentation capacity for any MHC-II allele.

METHODS: The Caritas Hospital St. Josef in Regensburg employs around 1330 employees and treats almost 20,000 inpatients annually. All records of the pandemic officer between 1 March 2020 and 28 February 2021 were included in the present descriptive study. RESULTS: In all, 280 SARS-CoV-2-positive patients (mean age 68 ± 19 years) were treated during the observation period; 81% (n = 227) of these were treated as inpatients between November 2020 and February 2021. In addition to the analysis of these patients, an analysis of the test concept was carried out, both for the patients (53% of the tests in the so-called 2nd wave) and for the employees; 1633 PCR tests were carried out, with 5.6% of all employees being infected with SARS-CoV‑2 in the course of the pandemic. In addition, other measures such as reducing the surgical program and other general measures were evaluated. CONCLUSION: Many established processes had to be changed in the hospital during the pandemic. Both staff shortages due to SARS-CoV-2-positive employees and the quarantine measures of contact persons led to further tension in the already tight staffing levels, especially in the nursing care sector, and made patient care more difficult. The test concept in the hospital was very complex and asymptomatic tests in particular showed a low hit rate, while being associated with high personnel costs.","Pemmerl, S.; Treml, C.; Hüfner, A.",Med Klin Intensivmed Notfmed,233,16

Currently, no effective pharmacological interventions or vaccines are available to treat or prevent COVID-19, therefore nonpharmacological public health measures are more in focus. Objectives The aim was to assess the effects of quarantine – alone or in combination with other measures – during coronavirus outbreaks. Methods Because of the current COVID-19 pandemic, WHO commissioned a rapid review. To save time, the method of systematic reviews was slightly and with caution modified. This publication is a summary of the most important aspects of the rapid review, translated into German by members of the WHO Collaborating Centre at the Danube University Krems (Austria). Results Overall, 29 studies were included. Ten modeling studies focused on COVID-19, 4 observational studies and 15 modeling studies focused on SARS and MERS. The modeling studies consistently reported a benefit of the simulated quarantine measures. For example, the models estimated that quarantine of people exposed to confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19 prevented between 44 and 81% of the cases that would otherwise have happened and 31 to 63% of the deaths, when compared to no such measures. In regard to costs, the earlier the quarantine measures are implemented, the greater the cost savings will be. Conclusion Our confidence in the evidence is very limited. This is mainly because the COVID-19 studies based their models on the limited data that have been available in the early weeks of the pandemic and made different assumptions about the virus. The studies of SARS and MERS are not completely generalizable to COVID-19. Despite only having limited evidence, all the studies found quarantine to be important for controlling the spread of severe coronavirus diseases. Looking to the coming months, in order to maintain the best possible balance of measures, decision makers must continue to constantly monitor the outbreak situation and the impact of the measures they implement.","Mayr, Verena; Nußbaumer-Streit, Barbara; Gartlehner, Gerald",Gesundheitswesen,233,1

Wedeterminedthe frequency of anti-PF4/polyanionantibodies in healthy vaccinees andassessed whether PF4/polyanionEIA-positive sera exhibit platelet-activating propertiesafter vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (n=138) orBNT162b2 (BioNTech/Pfizer; n=143). In total, 19 of 281 participants tested positive for anti-PF4/polyanion antibodies post-vaccination (All:6.8% [95%CI, 4.4-10.3]; BNT162b2: 5.6% [95%CI, 2.9-10.7]; ChAdOx1 nCoV-19: 8.0% [95%CI, 4.5-13.7%]).Optical densities were mostly low (between 0.5-1.0 units; reference range, <0.50) and none of the PF4/polyanionEIA-positive samples induced platelet activation in the presence of PF4. We conclude that positive PF4/polyanionEIAs can occur after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination with both mRNA- and adenoviral vector-based vaccines, but the majority of these antibodies likely have minor (if any) clinical relevance.Accordingly, low-titer positive PF4/polyanion EIA results should be interpreted with caution when screening asymptomatic individuals after vaccination against Covid-19.Pathogenic platelet-activating antibodies that cause VITT do not occur commonlyfollowing vaccination.","Thiele, Thomas; Ulm, Lena; Holtfreter, Silva; Schönborn, Linda; Kuhn, Sven Olaf; Scheer, Christian; Warkentin, Theodore E.; Bröker, Barbara M.; Becker, Karsten; Aurich, Konstanze; Selleng, Kathleen; Hübner, Nils-Olaf; Greinacher, Andreas",Blood,233,1

The 2019 World Health Organization report predicted that infection-related mortality will be similar to cancer mortality by 2050. Particularly, the global cumulative numbers of the recent outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have reached 110.7 million cases and over 2.4 million deaths as of February 23, 2021. Moreover, the crisis of these infectious diseases exposes the many problems of traditional diagnosis, treatment, and prevention, such as time-consuming and unselective detection methods, the emergence of drug-resistant bacteria, serious side effects, and poor drug delivery. There is an urgent need for rapid and sensitive diagnosis as well as high efficacy and low toxicity treatments. The emergence of nanomedicine has provided a promising strategy to greatly enhance detection methods and drug treatment efficacy. Owing to their unique optical, magnetic, and electrical properties, nanoparticles (NPs) have great potential for the fast and selective detection of bacteria, viruses, and fungi. NPs exhibit remarkable antibacterial activity by releasing reactive oxygen species and metal ions, exerting photothermal effects, and causing destruction of the cell membrane. Nano-based delivery systems can further improve drug permeability, reduce the side effects of drugs, and prolong systemic circulation time and drug half-life. Moreover, effective drugs against COVID-19 are still lacking. Recently, nanomedicine has shown great potential to accelerate the development of safe and novel anti-COVID-19 drugs. This article reviews the fundamental mechanisms and the latest developments in the treatment and diagnosis of bacteria, viruses, and fungi and discusses the challenges and perspectives in the application of nanomedicine.","Liu, Hengyu; Zhong, Wenhao; Zhang, Xinyu; Lin, Dongjun; Wu, Jun",Journal of materials chemistry.

AIMS: We assessed the impacts of the COVID‐19 pandemic on outpatient IBD patient care at a tertiary centre in Melbourne. More specifically, we assessed patient satisfaction with a telehealth model of care, failure to attend rates at IBD clinics and work absenteeism prior to and during the pandemic. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, qualitative analysis to assess our aims through an online survey. We invited patients who attended an IBD outpatient clinic from April to June 2020 to participate. This study was conducted at a single, tertiary referral hospital in Melbourne. The key data points that we analysed were patient satisfaction with a telehealth model of care and the effect of telehealth clinics on work absenteeism. RESULTS: One hundred and nineteen (88.1%) patients were ‘satisfied’ or ‘very satisfied’ with the care received in the telehealth clinic. Eighty‐four (60.4%) patients reported needing to take time off work to attend a face‐to‐face appointment, compared to 29 (20.9%) patients who needed to take time off work to attend telehealth appointments (P < 0.001). Clinic non‐attendance rates were similar prior to and during the pandemic with rates of 11.4% and 10.4% respectively (P = 0.840). CONCLUSIONS: Patients report high levels of satisfaction with a telehealth model of care during the COVID‐19 pandemic, with clinic attendance rates not being affected. Telehealth appointments significantly reduced work absenteeism when compared to traditional face‐to‐face clinics.","Shah, Rushab; Wright, Emily; Tambakis, George; Holmes, Jacinta; Thompson, Alexander; Connell, William; Lust, Mark; Niewiadomski, Ola; Kamm, Michael; Basnayake, Chamara; Ding, John",Intern Med J,233,1

METHODS: A set of questionnaire assessing coping patterns, coping flexibility, and depressive symptoms were administered to 428 students (234 men and 194 women). RESULTS: A total of 266 participants both completed the entire set of questionnaires and reported a frequency of two or more stressful life events (the criterion needed to calculate variance in perceived controllability). Findings showed that higher levels of depressive symptoms were significantly associated with higher levels of both event frequency (r = .368, p < .001) and event impact (r = .245, p < .001) and lower levels of perceived controllability (r = -.261, p < .001), coping effectiveness (r = -.375, p < .001), and ratio of strategy to situation fit (r = -.108, p < .05). Depressive symptoms were not significantly associated with cognitive flexibility (variance of perceived controllability; r = .031, p = .527), Gender was not a significant moderator of any of the reported associations. CONCLUSIONS: Findings indicate that Chinese university students with depressive symptoms reported experiencing a greater number of negative events than did non-depressed university students. In addition, undergraduates with depressive symptoms were more likely than other undergraduates to utilize maladaptive coping methods. Such findings highlight the potential importance of interventions aimed at helping undergraduate students with a lower coping flexibility develop skills to cope with stressful life events.","Zong, Ji-Gang; Cao, Xiao-Yan; Cao, Yuan; Shi, Yan-Fang; Wang, Yu-Na; Yan, Chao; Abela, John RZ; Gan, Yi-Qun; Gong, Qi-Yong; Chan, Raymond CK",Health Qual Life Outcomes,233,30

Vaccines for many pathogens were developed based on the display of foreign epitopes in the variable regions of the human adenovirus (HAdV) major capsid proteins (hexon, penton and fiber). The humoral immune response against the HAdV major capsid proteins was demonstrated to play a role in the development of an immune response against the epitopes in display. Through the immunoinformatic profiling of the major capsid proteins of HAdVs from different species, we developed a modular concept that can be used in the development of vaccines based on HAdV vectors. Our data suggests that different immunomodulatory potentials can be observed in the conserved regions, present in the hexon and penton proteins, from different species. Using this modular approach, we developed a HAdV-5 based vaccine strategy for SARS-CoV-2, constructed through the display of SARS-CoV-2 epitopes indicated by our prediction analysis as immunologically relevant. The sequences of the HAdV vector major capsid proteins were also edited to enhance the IFN-gamma induction and antigen presenting cells activation.

Therefore, limited data are available about the number of asymptomatic/paucisymptomatic subjects in the general population across time. To understand SARS-CoV-2 infection in the general population, we have developed a cross-sectional study (the ‘UNIversity against CORoNavirus study’) to investigate infection trends in asymptomatic/paucisymptomatic subjects in Milan (Italy), between March and June 2020. PARTICIPANTS: The study population included 2023 subjects asymptomatic at the enrolment. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: A nasal mid-turbinate swab for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and blood specimen for testing serum antibodies (immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG) were collected. RESULTS: Subjects showing positivity for the SARS-CoV-2 RNA and/or for anti-SARS-CoV-2 Ig is 237 (11.7%). Only 1.2% (n=25) of the total population had a positive nasal swab for SARS-CoV-2 and the large majority (21/25) of them were observed in March.

The rising trend to use games for physical fitness in more recent years has also provided more options and garnered more interest for their use in physical rehabilitation and motor learning. In this study, we report the results of an opinion survey of serious games in upper limb prosthetic training. OBJECTIVE: This study investigates and contrasts the expectations and preferences for game-based prosthetic rehabilitation of people with limb difference and researchers. METHODS: Both participant groups answered open and closed questions as well as a questionnaire to assess their user types. The distribution of the user types was compared with a Pearson chi-square test against a sample population. The data were analyzed using the thematic framework method; answers fell within the themes of usability, training, and game design. Researchers shared their views on current challenges and what could be done to tackle these. RESULTS: A total of 14 people with limb difference and 12 researchers participated in this survey. The open questions resulted in an overview of the different views on prosthetic training games between the groups. The user types of people with limb difference and researchers were both significantly different from the sample population, with χ(2)(5)=12.3 and χ(2)(5)=26.5, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We found that the respondents not only showed a general willingness and tentative optimism toward the topic but also acknowledged hurdles limiting the adoption of these games by both clinics and users. The results indicate a noteworthy difference between researchers and people with limb difference in their game preferences, which could lead to design choices that do not represent the target audience.

Most research is, however, centered around characterizing the epidemic based on point estimates like the average infectiousness or the average number of contacts. In this work, we use stochastic simulations to investigate the consequences of a population’s heterogeneity regarding connectivity and individual viral load levels. Therefore, we translate a COVID-19 ODE model to a stochastic multi-agent system. We use contact networks to model complex interaction structures and a probabilistic infection rate to model individual viral load variation. We observe a large dependency of the dispersion and dynamical evolution on the population’s heterogeneity that is not adequately captured by point estimates, for instance, used in ODE models. In particular, models that assume the same clinical and transmission parameters may lead to different conclusions, depending on different types of heterogeneity in the population. For instance, the existence of hubs in the contact network leads to an initial increase of dispersion and the effective reproduction number, but to a lower herd immunity threshold (HIT) compared to homogeneous populations or a population where the heterogeneity stems solely from individual infectivity variations.","Großmann, Gerrit; Backenköhler, Michael; Wolf, Verena",PLoS One,233,16

In this report, the in-silico approaches using network pharmacology and molecular docking was utilized to identify the core targets, pharmacological functions and mechanisms of metformin against obesity-related hypertension. The networking analysis identified 154 differentially expressed genes of obesity and hypertension, and 21 interaction genes, 6 core genes of metformin treating obesity-related hypertension. As results, molecular docking findings indicated the binding capability of metformin with key proteins, including interleukin 6 (IL-6) and chemokine (C-C motif) Ligand 2 (CCL2) expressed in obesity- and hypertension-dependent tissues. Metformin-exerted antihypertension/obesity actions involved in metabolic regulation, inflammatory suppression. And antihypertension/obesity mechanisms of metformin were revealed, including regulation of inflammatory and immunological signaling pathways for ameliorating microenvironmental homeostasis in targeting tissues. In conclusion, our current bioinformatics findings have uncovered all pharmacological targets, biological functions and signaling pathways of metformin treating obesity-related hypertension, thus promoting its clinical application in future.","Yang, Lu; Yang, Jianxin; Liang, Xiao; Huang, Wenjun; Zhang, Xiaoxi; Li, Rong",Bioengineered,233,30

METHODS: We compared serum Ig levels across platforms of viral antigens and antibodies with 15 positive and 30 negative SARS-CoV-2 controls followed by viral neutralization assessment. We then applied these platforms to a clinically relevant cohort of 114 individuals with unknown histories of SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: In controls, the best performing virus-specific antibody detection platforms were SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG [specificity 87%, sensitivity 100%, positive predictive value (PPV) 100%, negative predictive value (NPV) 93%], spike IgG3 [specificity 93%, sensitivity 97%, PPV 93%, NPV 97%], and nucleocapsid protein (NP) IgG [specificity 93%, sensitivity 97%, PPV 93%, NPV 97%]. Neutralization of positive and negative control sera showed 100% agreement. 20 unknown individuals had detectable SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with 16 demonstrating virus neutralization. Spike IgG3 provided the highest accuracy for predicting serologically positive individuals with virus neutralization activity [Misidentified 1/20 unknowns compared to 2/20 for RBD and NP IgG]. CONCLUSION: The coupling of virus neutralization analysis to a spike IgG3 antibody test is optimal to categorize patients for correlates of SARS-CoV-2 immune protection status.","Rathe, Jennifer A; Hemann, Emily A; Eggenberger, Julie; Li, Zhaoqi; Knoll, Megan L; Stokes, Caleb; Hsiang, Tien-Ying; Netland, Jason; Takehara, Kennidy K; Pepper, Marion; Gale, Michael",J Infect Dis,233,26

METHODS: We enrolled prospectively patients who underwent elective surgery between March and October 2020. A survey on COVID-19 and the 4-item Perceived Stress Scale (PPS-4) questionnaire were administered at hospital admission. Demographic and medical history data were also collected. Uni- and multivariate analyses were performed to identify independent predictors of higher PSS-4 values (≥7). RESULTS: A total of 200 patients were enrolled. Mean PSS-4 value resulted 6.04. Patients with PSS-4 value ≥7 resulted 43.5% (87/200). In multivariate analysis, PSS-4 value ≥7 was independently associated (p < 0.05) with female gender (OR 6.42), oncological disease (OR 2.87), high (>5 in a range between 0 and 10) fear of intrahospital transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection (OR 4.75), history of bladder instillation (OR 0.26), and current smokers (OR 0.27) CONCLUSION: High PSS-4 values at hospital admission in urologic surgical patients are positively correlated with female gender, fear of intrahospital transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and oncological disease.

Recent in vitro and electronic health record (EHR) studies suggested that certain allergy medications could prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection. We sought to carefully examine the potential selection bias associated with utilizing EHRs in these settings. METHODS: We analyzed associations of three allergy medications (cetirizine, diphenhydramine or hydroxyzine) with testing negative for SARS-CoV-2, measuring the potential effect of selection bias on these associations. We used a retrospective cohort of EHR data from 230,376 patients (18 years+) who visited outpatient clinicians in a single, large academic center at least once but were never hospitalized (10/1/2019–6/1/2020). Main exposures included EHR documentation of three allergy medications and allergy, with an intermediate outcome of receipt of a SARS-CoV-2 test, and the primary outcome as testing negative. FINDINGS: SARS-CoV-2 testing rates varied by sex, age, race/ethnicity and insurance. Increasing age and public insurance were associated with a higher adjusted odds of test negativity, while being Black or Hispanic was significantly associated with test positivity. Allergy diagnosis and use of any of three allergy medications were each associated with a higher likelihood of receiving a test (e.g. diphenhydramine - Odds Ratio (OR) 2.99, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 2.73, 3.28; cetirizine 1.75 (95% CI 1.60, 1.92)). Among those tested, only use of diphenhydramine was associated with a negative SARS-CoV-2 test (adjusted OR = 2.23, 95% CI 1.10, 4.55). However, analyses revealed that selection bias may be responsible for the apparent protective effect of diphenhydramine. INTERPRETATION: Diphenhydramine use was associated with more SARS-CoV-2 testing and subsequent higher odds for negative tests. While EHR-based observational studies can inform a need for interventional trials, this study revealed limitations of EHR data. The finding that diphenhydramine documentation conferred a higher odds of testing negative for SARS-CoV-2 must be interpreted with caution due to probable selection bias.

In this study, we tested the hypothesis that knowledge about COVID-19 correlates with the severity of psychopathological symptoms as measured by standardized questionnaires. The questionnaires were obtained using the Computer Assisted Web Interviews (CAWI) method during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Poland using the original COVID-19 knowledge questionnaire and the General Health Questionnaire-28 (GHQ-28). A series of bivariate tests and linear regression analyses were performed with a p < 0.05. All analyses were performed in Statistica 13.3. We enrolled 1,002 respondents. The rate of correct answers in the original questionnaire ranged from 44.6 to 84.1%, and the average was 60.1%. Four hundred and twenty participants (42%) met the criterion for the presence of relevant psychopathological symptoms. A significant negative correlation was found between the number of points obtained in the COVID-19 knowledge questionnaire and the GHQ-28 scores, both in relation to the total score and all its subscales. The following factors in the linear regression model were correlated with severity of somatic symptoms: knowledge about the COVID-19 pandemic (B = −0.12, P = 0.000), sex (B = 0.12, P = 0.000), use of psychiatric or psychological care (B = 0.20, P < 0.000) and chronic diseases (B = 0.09, P = 0.002). In this study, we observed a negative correlation between the knowledge about the COVID-19 pandemic and the severity of psychopathological symptoms. The results clearly indicate that the complexity of the global problem of the current pandemic is related to the development of psychopathological symptoms.

Within an inevitable revamping attention on the need for government intervention to face the challenges raised by the Covid19 pandemic, industrial policy is appearing as a central piece of the puzzle. As production dynamics in every country is highly affected by the crisis, industrial policy is considered part of the response to solve dramatic economic and social problems deriving by extraordinary levels of unemployment, deprivation and poverty. In this paper, we argue that a turning point on the connection between industrial policy, sustainability and development has been reached, highlighting the need to rethink its theoretical foundations as well as its governance and implementation processes for a new role in our post-Covid 19 societies. Therefore, the research question underlying this paper deals primarily with the nexus between the debate on industrial policy and its effects in terms of human development, social cohesion and sustainability. For this reason, we attempt at closing the gap between different strands of literature, whose integrated connection leads to a new analytical framework with real-world implications on the role of industrial policy, not only as tool for productive dynamics, but also as a leverage for sustainable human development. All in all, we aim at contributing to the debate on our post-Covid19 economies and societies in two ways: firstly, by providing a new integrated analytical framework on industrial policy to steer a sustainable structural change of our economies and societies towards sustainable human development; secondly, by identifying preliminary implications on industrial policy governance and implementation, investing in the accurate and transparent design of industrial policy in the post-Covid19 era.","Ferrannini, Andrea; Barbieri, Elisa; Biggeri, Mario; Di Tommaso, Marco R.",World Dev,233,24

The World Health Organization has declared the outbreak a global pandemic; it is reported to have spread to nearly every country in the world. However, the prevalence varies across developed and developing countries, as well as within different regions of the same country. It is not hidden that estimating the magnitude of COVID-19 infection from the community surveys is critical for public health policymakers to make decisions to deal with the outbreak, optimize measures, and design mitigation plans. METHODS: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted from 01 July to 31 August 2020 in the northeastern Ethiopia region. A simple random sampling technique was used to select study participants from the community survey, contact traces from confirmed cases, and infection suspects. After extraction of viral nucleic acid from oropharyngeal specimen, the real-time fluorescent polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) kit was used for detecting novel coronavirus. RESULTS: A total of 8752 study participants were included in this study. About 63.6% were males and 36.4% were females. Out of the total 8752 study participants, 291 (3.3%) were found to be infected with the virus. The first laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 were detected in the fourth week of the study period, that is, from July 24 to July 31, 2020, and the peak prevalence was observed in the last two weeks.

As a first step toward understanding the effect of PDCoV on host cells, we elucidated mechanisms underlying the process of apoptotic cell death after PDCoV infection. The use of a pan-caspase inhibitor resulted in the inhibition of PDCoV-induced apoptosis and reduction of PDCoV replication, suggestive of the association of a caspase-dependent pathway. Furthermore, PDCoV infection necessitated the activation of the initiator caspase-9 responsible for the intrinsic mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. Experimental data indicated that PDCoV infection led to Bax-mediated mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP), resulting in specific relocation of the mitochondrial cytochrome c (cyt c) into the cytoplasm. Treatment with cyclosporin A (CsA), an inhibitor of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) opening, significantly suppressed PDCoV-triggered apoptosis and viral replication. Moreover, cyt c release was completely abrogated in PDCoV-infected cells in the presence of CsA, suggesting the critical role of MPTP in intrinsic apoptosis in response to PDCoV infection. Altogether, our results indicate that PDCoV infection stimulates MOMP either via Bax recruitment or MPTP opening to permit the release of apoptogenic cyt c into the cytoplasm, thereby leading to execution of the caspase-dependent intrinsic apoptosis pathway to facilitate viral replication in vitro.","Lee, Yoo Jin; Lee, Changhee",Virus Res,233,24

This study aimed to assess the prevalence of symptoms of mental health problems and some related factors in Italian adolescents in 2017–2018. METHODS: The present study was a cross-sectional survey among 3002 students aged 15–16 years who resided in two Italian provinces, in North and South Italy. Symptoms of mental health problems were assessed using the SDQ and CES-DC, and students’ risk-taking behaviors and school climate perception were assessed. All information was collected anonymously. Logistic regression models were used to assess the associations of tobacco and alcohol use, screen time, bullying, and school climate with symptoms of mental health problems. RESULTS: One student out of five reported symptoms of mental health problems, with a more than double proportion among girls than boys (28.7% vs 10.4% with depressive symptoms, respectively). Thirty percent and 40% of students smoked tobacco or drank alcoholic beverages at least once in the past month, and more than 40% reported being victims or authors of bullying in the past 6 months. Smoking behavior, alcohol consumption, screen time, bullying, and negative school climate had 1.2- to 3.3-fold increased odds of symptoms of mental health problems without substantial differences between sexes and geographical areas. CONCLUSIONS: Tobacco and alcohol use, screen time, bullying, and school climate were independently associated with symptoms of mental health problems in a large sample of 15–16-year-old Italian adolescents without substantial gender and geographical differences.

It is important to predict the prostate's susceptibility to SARS‐CoV‐2 infection in cancer patients and the disease outcome by assessing TMPRSS2 expression in cancer tissues. In this study, we conducted the expression profiles of the TMPRSS2 gene for COVID‐19 in different normal tissues and PRAD (prostate adenocarcinoma) tumour tissues. TMPRSS2 is highly expressed in normal tissues including the small intestine, prostate, pancreas, salivary gland, colon, stomach, seminal vesicle and lung, and is increased in PRAD tissues, indicating that SARS‐CoV‐2 might attack not only the lungs and other normal organs, but also in PRAD cancer tissues. Hypomethylation of TMPRSS2 promoter may not be the mechanism for TMPRSS2 overexpression in PRAD tissues and PRAD pathogenesis. TMPRSS2 expresses eleven isoforms in PRAD tissues, with the TMPRSS2‐001 isoform expressed highest and followed by TMPRSS2‐201. Further isoform structures prediction showed that these two highly expressed isoforms have both SRCR_2 and Trypsin (Tryp_SPc) domains, which may be essential for TMPRSS2 functional roles for tumorigenesis and entry for SARS‐CoV‐2 in PRAD patients. Analyses of functional annotation and enrichment in TMPRSS2 showed that TMPRSS2 is mostly enriched in regulation of viral entry into host cells, protein processing and serine‐type peptidase activity. TMPRSS2 is also associated with prostate gland cancer cell expression, different complex(es) formation, human influenza and carcinoma, pathways in prostate cancer, influenza A, and transcriptional misregulation in cancer. Altogether, even though high expression of TMPRSS2 may not be favourable for PRAD patient's survival, increased expression in these patients should play roles in susceptibility of the SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and clinical severity for COVID‐19, highlighting the value of protective actions of PRAD cases by targeting or androgen‐mediated therapeutic strategies in the COVID‐19 pandemic.","Cheng, Jingliang; Zhou, Ju; Fu, Shangyi; Fu, Jiewen; Zhou, Baixu; Chen, Hanchun; Fu, Junjiang; Wei, Chunli",J Cell Mol Med,233,2

Perceived social support, active coping with COVID-19, risk perception and confidence were evaluated using self-administered questionnaires. Structural equation modeling was used to verify the direct and indirect effects between variables. The mediation model demonstrated that lower perceived social support was significantly associated with a higher level of active coping with COVID-19, and this was mediated by a higher level of risk perception.

Most coronary artery fistulae are congenital, and the acquired variant is very rare. Herein, we present a possible acquired coronary artery to pulmonary artery fistula, most likely secondary to bronchiectasis in the adjacent lung. We will analyze the hemodynamic significance of the fistula in this case and also seek to understand the outcomes of various treatment modalities. CASE PRESENTATION: A 56-year-old male patient presented with hypoxemia secondary to acute pulmonary edema during a hypertensive emergency. He developed myocardial ischemia after treatment with diuretics and nitroglycerin, due to shunting of blood from the right coronary artery to the right lower lobe branch of the right pulmonary artery, via the fistula. This resulted in coronary steal syndrome. Coronary angiogram confirmed the fistula connecting the right coronary artery to the right lower lobe branch of the right pulmonary artery. An attempt at coil embolization was unsuccessful due to the inability to advance the microcatheter beyond the fistula. DISCUSSION: The majority of coronary artery fistulae are asymptomatic as they are hemodynamically not significant and are incidentally detected by coronary angiography, CT angiogram, echocardiogram or multi-detector row computed tomography (MDCT) with 3D reconstruction. The development of congenital fistula can be explained by the Hackensellner involution-persistence hypothesis, but the anatomy in this case and the bronchiectasis in the part of the lung adjacent to the fistula makes an acquired cause very likely due to local inflammation and the age of patient at initial diagnosis. An initial diagnosis of bronchiectasis was made at age 51, which was 5 years prior to the detection of the coronary artery fistula in this patient. Symptoms have been described mostly in the elderly and include chest pain, dyspnea, fatigue, syncope, and palpitations. Such symptomatic fistula should be treated either by percutaneous transluminal embolization or surgical ligation. CONCLUSION: This is a unique case of acquired coronary to pulmonary artery fistula in the setting of bronchiectasis in a patient in which PTE was attempted and failed. More research is required to understand the pathophysiology of acquired fistula. The decision regarding the method of closure should be individualized and decided on a case by case basis.","Narh, Joshua Tetteh; Zahid, Erum; Shivaraj, Kiran; Sahni, Sonu; Kariyanna, Pramod Theetha; Khan, Abdullah",Respir Med Case Rep,233,33

The virus still spreads globally through human-to-human transmission. Nevertheless, there are no specific treatments clinically approved. This study aimed to compare antiviral activity of gemcitabine and its analogue 2′-fluoro-2′-deoxycytidine (2FdC) against SARS-CoV-2 as well as cytotoxicity in vitro. Fluorescent image-based antiviral assays revealed that gemcitabine was highly potent, with a 50% effective concentration (EC(50)) of 1.2 μM, more active than the well-known nucleoside monophosphate remdesivir (EC(50) = 35.4 μM). In contrast, 2FdC was marginally active (EC(50) = 175.2 μM). For all three compounds, the 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC(50)) values were over 300 μM toward Vero CCL-81 cells. Western blot and quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction analyses verified that gemcitabine blocked viral protein expression in virus-infected cells, not only Vero CCL-81 cells but also Calu-3 human lung epithelial cells in a dose-dependent manner. It was found that gemcitabine has a synergistic effect when combined with remdesivir. This report suggests that the difluoro group of gemcitabine is critical for the antiviral activity and that its combination with other evaluated antiviral drugs, such as remdesivir, could be a desirable option to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Jang, Yejin; Shin, Jin Soo; Lee, Myoung Kyu; Jung, Eunhye; An, Timothy; Kim, Uk-Il; Kim, Kyungjin; Kim, Meehyein",Int J Mol Sci,233,26

Methods We reviewed 85 studies (21,530 patients), published from five regions of the world, to highlight issues involved in the diagnosis of COVID-19 in the early phase of the pandemic, following the standards outlined in the PRISMA statement. All relevant articles, published up to May 31, 2020, in PubMed, BioRiXv, MedRiXv, and Google Scholar, were included. We evaluated the qualitative (9749 patients) and quantitative (10,355 patients) performance of RT-PCR and serologic diagnostic tests for real-world samples, and assessed the concordance (5,538 patients) between methods in meta-analyses. Results The RT-PCR tests exhibited heterogeneity in the primers and reagents used. Of 1,957 positive RT-PCR COVID-19 participants, 1,585 had positive serum antibody (IgM +/- IgG) tests (sensitivity 0.81, 95%CI 0.66-.90).

TRIM13, a member of the TRIM family, is a RING domain-containing E3 ubiquitin ligase which plays critical roles in diverse cellular processes including cell death, cancer and antiviral immunity. In this study, a TRIM13 homolog from orange spotted grouper, Epinephelus coioides (EcTRIM13) was cloned and characterized. The full-length of EcTRIM13 cDNA encoded a polypeptide of 399 amino acids which shared 81% identity with TRIM13 homolog from large yellow croaker (Larimichthys crocea). Amino acid alignment analysis showed that EcTRIM13 contained conserved RING finger and B-box domain. Expression patterns analysis indicated that EcTRIM13 was abundant in liver, spleen, kidney, intestine and gill. Moreover, the transcript of EcTRIM13 in grouper spleen was differently regulated after injection with Singapore grouper iridovirus (SGIV) or polyinosin-polycytidylic acid (poly I:C). Under fluorescence microscopy, we observed the tubular structure in wild type EcTRIM13 transfected cells, but the RING domain mutant resulted in the fluorescence distribution was changed and the bright punctate fluorescence was evenly situated throughout the cytoplasm, suggesting that the RING domain was essential for its accurate localization. Overexpression of EcTRIM13 in vitro obviously increased the replication of red spotted grouper nervous necrosis virus (RGNNV), and the enhancing effect of EcTRIM13 on virus replication was affected by the RING domain. Furthermore, the ectopic expression of EcTRIM13 not only negatively regulated the interferon promoter activity induced by interferon regulator factor (IRF) 3, IRF7, and melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5), but also decreased the expression of several interferon related factors. In addition, the overexpression of EcTRIM13 also differently regulated the transcription of pro-inflammatory factors.

Rapidly increased numbers of COVID-19 cases overwhelmed public health systems across the world, imposing increased working hours and workloads for health care workers. Here, we have evaluated the prevalence of health outcomes and associated factors of interns and resident physicians in Panama. Methods. A cross-sectional study was undertaken during July 23, 2020, to August 13, 2020, to evaluate the prevalence of health outcomes and associated factors in interns and residents across Panama. Snowball sampling was used to recruit participants. Then an electronic questionnaire with scales to evaluate anxiety disorders (GAD-7), depression (PHQ-9) and post-traumatic stress (IES-R) was evaluated. In addition, socio-demographic variables, clinical history of mental disorders and COVID-19 exposure were evaluated. Independent analyses for each mental health outcome were undertaken using a logistic regression analysis. Results. A total of 517/1205 (42.9%) interns and residents were nationwide recruited. Of these 274 (53.0%) were interns and 243 (47.0%) residents. The overall prevalence of depression symptoms was 25.3%, 13.7% anxiety and 12.2% post-traumatic stress. At least, 9.3% participants reported having suicidal ideation. The most parsimonious model showed females had a higher prevalence of mental health disorders, in all results and the married participants were more likely to present depression (OR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.03-2.91; P = 0.039) or at least one alteration to mental health (OR, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.03-2.68; P = 0.039). Resident physicians in surgical specialties were less likely to have post-traumatic stress (OR, 0.20; 95% CI, 0.06-0.63; P = 0.006) or at least one mental health disturbance (OR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.26-0.83; P = 0.010). A history of psychological trauma and psychiatric pathology were risk factors for most of the disorders investigated. Conclusions.

Method: This retrospective observational cohort study was based on the first 100 patients who requested recommendations on the necessity of breaking the lockdown for emergency ophthalmology consultation during the period from March to May 2020. Results: 91 patients completed questionnaires. 49 were directed to emergency consultation and 42 to differed scheduled visits or telemedicine visits. One patient sent for emergency consultation had an overestimated severity and could have been seen later, while two patients initially recommended for a scheduled visit were considered appropriate for emergency consultation. However, these patients’ management did not suffer as a consequence of the delay. The sensitivity of the algorithm, defined as the number of emergency consultations suggested by the algorithm divided by the total number of emergency consultations deemed appropriate by the practitioner’s final evaluation, was 96.0%. The specificity of the algorithm, defined as the number of patients recommended for delayed consultation by the algorithm divided by the number of patients deemed clinically appropriate for this approach, was 97.5%. The positive predictive value, defined as the number of appropriate emergency consultations divided by the total number of emergency consultations suggested by the algorithm, was 97.9%. Finally, the negative predictive value, defined as the number of appropriately deferred patients divided by the number of deferred patients recommended by the algorithm, was 95.2%. Conclusion: This study demonstrates the reliability of an algorithm based on patients’ past medical history and symptoms to classify patients and direct them to either emergency consultation or to a more appropriate deferred, scheduled appointment.

This global response has led to a burst of publications on the pathophysiology of the virus, yet without coordinated efforts to organize this knowledge, it can remain hidden away from individual research groups. By extracting and formalizing this knowledge in a structured and computable form, as in the form of a knowledge graph, researchers can readily reason and analyze this information on a much larger scale. Here, we present the COVID-19 Knowledge Graph, an expansive cause-and-effect network constructed from scientific literature on the new coronavirus that aims to provide a comprehensive view of its pathophysiology. To make this resource available to the research community and facilitate its exploration and analysis, we also implemented a web application and released the KG in multiple standard formats.

Life-skills training programs conducted within the school curriculum are effective in preventing the onset and escalation of substance use among adolescents. However, their dissemination is impeded due to their large resource requirements. Life-skills training provided via mobile phones may provide a more economic and scalable approach. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to test the appropriateness (ie, acceptance, use, and evaluation) and short-term efficacy of a mobile phone–based life-skills training program to prevent substance use among adolescents within a controlled trial. METHODS: The study design was a two-arm, parallel-group, cluster-randomized controlled trial with assessments at baseline and follow-up assessments after 6 and 18 months. This report includes outcomes measured up to the 6-month follow-up. The efficacy of the intervention was tested in comparison to an assessment-only control group. The automated intervention program SmartCoach included online feedback and individually tailored text messages provided over 22 weeks. The contents were based on social cognitive theory and addressed self-management skills, social skills, and substance use resistance skills. Linear mixed models and generalized linear mixed models, as well as logistic or linear regressions, were used to investigate changes between baseline and 6-month follow-up in the following outcomes: 30-day prevalence rates of problem drinking, tobacco use, and cannabis use as well as quantity of alcohol use, quantity of cigarettes smoked, cannabis use days, perceived stress, well-being, and social skills. RESULTS: A total of 1759 students from 89 Swiss secondary and upper secondary school classes were invited to participate in the study. Of these, 1473 (83.7%) students participated in the study; the mean age was 15.4 years (SD 1.0) and 55.2% (813/1473) were female. Follow-up assessments at 6 months were completed by 1233 (83.7%) study participants. On average, program participants responded to half (23.6 out of 50) of the prompted activities. Program evaluations underlined its appropriateness for the target group of secondary school students, with the majority rating the program as helpful and individually tailored. The results concerning the initial effectiveness of this program based on 6-month follow-up data are promising, with three of nine outcomes of the intention-to-treat analyses showing beneficial developments of statistical significance (ie, quantity of alcohol use, quantity of tobacco use, and perceived stress; P<.05) and another three outcomes (ie, problem drinking prevalence, cannabis use days, and social skills) showing beneficial developments of borderline significance (P<.10). CONCLUSIONS: The results showed good acceptance of this intervention program that could be easily and economically implemented in school classes. Initial results on program efficacy indicate that it might be effective in both preventing or reducing substance use and fostering life skills; however, data from the final 18-month follow-up assessments will be more conclusive.

Host immune responses to CoV are complex and regulated in part through antiviral interferons. However, the interferon-stimulated gene products that inhibit CoV are not well characterized2. Here, we show that interferon-inducible lymphocyte antigen 6 complex, locus E (LY6E) potently restricts cellular infection by multiple CoVs, including SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Mechanistic studies revealed that LY6E inhibits CoV entry into cells by interfering with spike protein-mediated membrane fusion. Importantly, mice lacking Ly6e in hematopoietic cells were highly susceptible to murine CoV infection. Exacerbated viral pathogenesis in Ly6e knockout mice was accompanied by loss of hepatic and splenic immune cells and reduction in global antiviral gene pathways. Accordingly, we found that Ly6e directly protects primary B cells and dendritic cells from murine CoV infection. Our results demonstrate that LY6E is a critical antiviral immune effector that controls CoV infection and pathogenesis. These findings advance our understanding of immune-mediated control of CoV in vitro and in vivo, knowledge that could help inform strategies to combat infection by emerging CoV.","Pfaender, Stephanie; Mar, Katrina B.; Michailidis, Eleftherios; Kratzel, Annika; Hirt, Dagny; V’kovski, Philip; Fan, Wenchun; Ebert, Nadine; Stalder, Hanspeter; Kleine-Weber, Hannah; Hoffmann, Markus; Hoffmann, H.

This condition is reported rarely and may be indicative of an underlying obsessive-compulsive disorder. TT may be misdiagnosed with trichotillomania or other disorders such as alopecia areata, tinea capitis, and postinflammatory scars. The diagnosis of trichotemnomania is confirmed by dermoscopic assessment, histopathological changes of hair, and correlation of these findings with clinical history. A fourteen-year-old adolescent girl presented with focal hair loss over forehead for duration of two-weeks and periodic abnormal breathing and poor sleep for 2-month duration. Besides, she had also lost some of pubic hair and hair on the forearm over preceding 24 hours. This patient was assessed by a team including a paediatrician, gynecologist, dermatologist, and psychiatrist to gather focused medical history and to perform physical examination, laboratory investigations, and dermoscopic assessment. It was revealed that she used to shave or cut regularly following stressful situations across various aspects of her life and hyperventilate as a means of relieving her stress. Eventually, she was diagnosed to have trichotemnomania and was started oral sertraline 50 mg/day for one month. Clinical features and her behaviour improved with regular cognitive behavioural therapy, and hairs were demonstrated to grow up normally with change in behaviour. Currently, she does well at school and is off medications and being followed up at the child guidance clinic. Trichotemnomania is a very rare disorder which is characterised by cutting or shaving of one's own hairs as a compulsive habit. The condition needs careful and detailed assessment by a team of specialists to identify coexisting psychiatric disorders and offer treatment.","Thadchanamoorthy, V.; Thirukumar, Markandu; Dayasiri, Kavinda; Thamilvannan, N.; Jeyakumar, Judy",Case Rep Dermatol Med,233,27

This unprecedented time prompts scholars of religion to reflect on how to strategically approach the study of religion in the time of “social distancing,” as well as moving forward. Particularly important considerations include developing heuristic, innovative approaches for revealing ongoing changes to religion, as well as how religion continues to structure social life across a wide range of contexts, from the most intimate and personal to the most public and global.

The bachelor’s degree (BA) is increasingly dividing Americans; the one-third with a BA or more live longer and more prosperous lives, while the two-thirds without face rising mortality and declining prospects. We construct a time series, from 1990 to 2018, of a summary of each year’s mortality rates and expected years lived from 25 to 75 at the fixed mortality rates of that year. Our measure excludes those over 75 who have done relatively well over the last three decades and focuses on the years when deaths rose rapidly through drug overdoses, suicides, and alcoholic liver disease and when the decline in mortality from cardiovascular disease slowed and reversed. The BA/no-BA gap in our measure widened steadily from 1990 to 2018. Beyond 2010, as those with a BA continued to see increases in our period measure of expected life, those without saw declines. This is true for the population as a whole, for men and for women, and for Black and White people. In contrast to growing education gaps, gaps between Black and White people diminished but did not vanish.

Various stakeholders have called on health care professionals, such as nurses and physicians, to be more proactive in correcting health misinformation on social media. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to identify US physicians’ and nurses’ motivations for correcting health misinformation on social media, the barriers they face in doing so, and their recommendations for overcoming such barriers. METHODS: In-depth interviews were conducted with 30 participants, which comprised 15 (50%) registered nurses and 15 (50%) physicians. Qualitative data were analyzed by using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Participants were personally (eg, personal choice) and professionally (eg, to fulfill the responsibility of a health care professional) motivated to correct health misinformation on social media. However, they also faced intrapersonal (eg, a lack of positive outcomes and time), interpersonal (eg, harassment and bullying), and institutional (eg, a lack of institutional support and social media training) barriers to correcting health misinformation on social media. To overcome these barriers, participants recommended that health care professionals should receive misinformation and social media training, including building their social media presence. CONCLUSIONS: US physicians and nurses are willing to correct health misinformation on social media despite several barriers. Nonetheless, this study provides recommendations that can be used to overcome such barriers.

The impacts of asthma on COVID-19 progression are still unclear but a modifying effect is plausible as respiratory viruses are acknowledged to be an important trigger for asthma exacerbations and a different, potentially type-2 biased, immune response might occur. In this study, we compared the blood circulating cytokine response to COVID-19 infection in patients with and without asthma. METHODS: Plasma samples and clinical information were collected from 80 patients with mild (25), severe (36) or critical (19) COVID-19 and 29 healthy subjects at the John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK. The concentrations of 51 circulating proteins in the plasma samples were measured with Luminex and compared between groups. RESULTS: Total 16 pre-existing asthma patients were found (3 in mild, 10 in severe, and 3 in critical COVID-19). The prevalence of asthma in COVID-19 severity groups did not suggest a clear correlation between asthma and COVID-19 severity. Within the same COVID-19 severity group, no differences were observed between patients with or without asthma on oxygen saturation, CRP, neutrophil counts, and length of hospital stay. The mortality in the COVID-19 patients with asthma (12.5%) was not higher than that in patients without asthma (17.2%).

The study's objective was to determine the medical students’ acceptance and perceptions of e-learning during the Covid-19 closure time in Jeddah. METHODS: A cross-sectional, web-based study was done among 340 medical students from King Abdulaziz University, 2020. A standardized, electronic, self-administered, Google Form data collection sheet was distributed. It included the E-learning acceptance measure (ElAM) containing three constructs, namely: tutor quality (TQ), perceived usefulness (PU), and facilitating conditions (FC). The sheet also inquired about the students’ perceptions of the benefits, enablers, and barriers to e-learning. Descriptive, inferential statistics and multiple linear regression analyses were applied. RESULTS: Blackboard and Zoom were the most preferred Learning Management Systems (LMS) by our medical students. The mean score of ElAM was 102.82 ± 24.102. Better achievers obtained significantly (P < 0.001) higher scores in all ElAM constructs. About three-fifths of the students confirmed that e-learning substituted classical on-campus learning and was an adaptable, and less time-consuming method. The educator's good e-learning skills, the subject, instructional design, interaction, motivation, and good LMS were agreed as enablers of e-learning. However, most students accepted that clinical teaching is the most challenging learning outcome and that exams could be affected by low internet quality.

Human/COVID-19 interactions cause different outcomes ranging from minor health consequences to death. Since social interaction is the default mode by which individuals communicate with their surroundings, different modes of contagion can play a role in determining the long-term consequences for mental health and emotional well-being. We examined some basic aspects of human social interaction, emphasizing some particular features of the emotional contagion. Moreover, we analyzed the main report that described brain damage related to the COVID-19 infection. Indeed, the goal of this review is to suggest a possible explanation for the relationships among emotionally impaired people, brain damage, and COVID-19 infection. Results: COVID-19 can cause several significant neurological disorders and the pandemic has been linked to a rise in people reporting mental health problems, such as depression and anxiety. Neurocognitive symptoms associated with COVID-19 include delirium, both acute and chronic attention and memory impairment related to hippocampal and cortical damage, as well as learning deficits in both adults and children. Conclusions: Although our knowledge on the biology and long-term clinical outcomes of the COVID-19 infection is largely limited, approaching the pandemic based on lessons learnt from previous outbreaks of infectious diseases and the biology of other coronaviruses will provide a suitable pathway for developing public mental health strategies, which could be positively translated into therapeutic approaches, attempting to improve stress coping responses, thus contributing to alleviate the burden driven by the pandemic.","Valenzano, Anna; Scarinci, Alessia; Monda, Vincenzo; Sessa, Francesco; Messina, Antonietta; Monda, Marcellino; Precenzano, Francesco; Mollica, Maria Pina; Carotenuto, Marco; Messina, Giovanni; Cibelli, Giuseppe",Medicina (Kaunas),233,16

Clinical characteristics and outcomes including ICU admission, ventilator requirement, and mortality were analyzed. RESULTS: Thirty-nine COVID-19 surgical patients were identified. Mean age was 53.9 years and there were more males than females in the cohort (56.4% vs 43.6%). Twenty-two patients (56.4%) had a confirmed positive COVID-19 test pre-operatively and the remainder tested positive after their procedure. The majority (59%) of patients had an American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class of 3 or higher. Post-operatively, 7 patients (17.9%) required ICU level care with a mean length of stay of 7.7 days.

Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and chlorogenic acid (CGA) are the major components of green tea polyphenols and coffee polyphenols, respectively, and believed to be responsible for most of these effects. Although a large number of cell-based and animal experiments have provided convincing evidence to support the anti-cancer effects of green tea, coffee, EGCG, and CGA, human studies are still controversial and some studies have suggested even an increased risk for certain types of cancers such as esophageal and gynecological cancers with green tea consumption and bladder and lung cancers with coffee consumption. The reason for these inconsistent results may have been arisen from various confounding factors. Cell-based and animal studies have proposed several mechanisms whereby EGCG and CGA exert their anti-cancer effects. These components appear to share the common mechanisms, among which one related to reactive oxygen species is perhaps the most attractive. Meanwhile, EGCG and CGA have also different target molecules which might explain the site-specific differences of anti-cancer effects found in human studies. Further studies will be necessary to clarify what is the mechanism to cause such differences between green tea and coffee.","Hayakawa, Sumio; Ohishi, Tomokazu; Miyoshi, Noriyuki; Oishi, Yumiko; Nakamura, Yoriyuki; Isemura, Mamoru",Molecules,233,29

Currently, nanotechnology research has been empowering more in agricultural sector, food process and medicinal industries. The surface area to volume ratio of nanoparticles is quite large which have 1–100nm size. Nanomaterials have superior bioavailability than larger particles, resulting in greater utilization in single cells, tissues and organs. Referable to the growing demand of nanoparticles, it is essential to build up synthetic method which is profitable, environmentally sustainable and which can substitutes with effective and competent technology to synthesis environmentally benign nanoparticles (NPs). Nanomaterials are “deliberately engineered” to direct the enhancement of special properties at the nanoscale. Nanoparticles have been known to be used for abundant physical, biological, and pharmaceutical applications. Nano-silver is the most studied and utilized nanoparticle. Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have been the topics of researchers because of their unique properties. Thus, this review presents various synthesis methods of AgNPs and its application in different sectors.","Beyene, Hayelom Dargo; Werkneh, Adhena Ayaliew; Bezabh, Hailemariam Kassa; Ambaye, Tekilt Gebregergs",Sustainable Materials and Technologies,233,6

In the context of Greco-Arab medicine, he discovered respiratory and contact contagion of Pestis and attributed its physiopathology to a lack of pulmonary cooling of the innate heat, generated in the heart and carried by the blood humor. The process described was equivalent to the oxygen transport system. Furthermore, it was supposed to generate toxic residues, such as free radicals, leading to an irreversible multiple organ failure (MOF), considered a mortality factor as in Covid-19.

COVID-19 early detection is essential for its mitigation by controlling its spread from infected patients in communities through quarantine. Although vaccination has started, it will take time to reach everyone, especially in developing nations, and computer scientists are striving to come up with competent methods using image analysis. In this work, a classifier ensemble technique is proposed, utilizing Choquet fuzzy integral, wherein convolutional neural network (CNN) based models are used as base classifiers. It classifies chest X-ray images from patients with common Pneumonia, confirmed COVID-19, and healthy lungs. Since there are few samples of COVID-19 cases for training on a standard CNN model from scratch, we use the transfer learning scheme to train the base classifiers, which are InceptionV3, DenseNet121, and VGG19. We utilize the pre-trained CNN models to extract features and classify the chest X-ray images using two dense layers and one softmax layer. After that, we combine the prediction scores of the data from individual models using Choquet fuzzy integral to get the final predicted labels, which is more accurate than the prediction by the individual models. To determine the fuzzy-membership values of each classifier for the application of Choquet fuzzy integral, we use the validation accuracy of each classifier. The proposed method is evaluated on chest X-ray images in publicly available repositories (IEEE and Kaggle datasets). It provides 99.00%, 99.00%, 99.00%, and 99.02% average recall, precision, F-score, and accuracy, respectively. We have also evaluated the performance of the proposed model on an inter-dataset experimental setup, where chest X-ray images from another dataset (CMSC-678-ML-Project GitHub dataset) are fed to our trained model and we have achieved 99.05% test accuracy on this dataset. The results are better than commonly used classifier ensemble methods as well as many state-of-the-art methods.","Dey, Subhrajit; Bhattacharya, Rajdeep; Malakar, Samir; Mirjalili, Seyedali; Sarkar, Ram",Comput Biol Med,233,20

Previously it was estimated that there were 1.2 million YLLs associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) deaths in the USA through 11 July 2020. The aim of this study is to update YLL estimates for the first full year of the pandemic. METHODS: We employed data regarding COVID-19 deaths in the USA through 31 January 2021 by jurisdiction, gender and age group. We used actuarial life expectancy tables by gender and age to estimate YLLs. RESULTS: We estimated roughly 3.9 million YLLs due to COVID-19 deaths, which correspond to roughly 9.2 YLLs per death. We observed a large range across states in YLLs per 10 000 capita, with New York City at 298 and Vermont at 12. Nationally, the YLLs per 10 000 capita were greater for males than females (136.3 versus 102.3), but there was significant variation in the differences across states. CONCLUSIONS: Our estimates provide further insight into the mortality effects of COVID-19. The observed differences across states and genders demonstrate the need for disaggregated analyses of the pandemic’s effects.","Quast, Troy; Andel, Ross; Gregory, Sean; Storch, Eric A",J Public Health (Oxf),233,10

While vaccines are effective, they have a number of limitations, and influenza strains resistant to currently available anti-influenza drugs are increasingly isolated. This necessitates the exploration of novel anti-influenza therapies. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We investigated the potential of aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA), a potent inhibitor of nucleic acid processing enzymes, to protect Madin-Darby canine kidney cells from influenza infection. We found, by neutral red assay, that ATA was protective, and by RT-PCR and ELISA, respectively, confirmed that ATA reduced viral replication and release. Furthermore, while pre-treating cells with ATA failed to inhibit viral replication, pre-incubation of virus with ATA effectively reduced viral titers, suggesting that ATA may elicit its inhibitory effects by directly interacting with the virus. Electron microscopy revealed that ATA induced viral aggregation at the cell surface, prompting us to determine if ATA could inhibit neuraminidase. ATA was found to compromise the activities of virus-derived and recombinant neuraminidase. Moreover, an oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 strain with H274Y was also found to be sensitive to ATA. Finally, we observed additive protective value when infected cells were simultaneously treated with ATA and amantadine hydrochloride, an anti-influenza drug that inhibits M2-ion channels of influenza A virus. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Collectively, these data suggest that ATA is a potent anti-influenza agent by directly inhibiting the neuraminidase and could be a more effective antiviral compound when used in combination with amantadine hydrochloride.","Hashem, Anwar M.; Flaman, Anathea S.; Farnsworth, Aaron; Brown, Earl G.; Van Domselaar, Gary; He, Runtao; Li, Xuguang",PLoS One,233,1

We sought to determine whether differences in instruction types at the beginning of the 2020-2021 school year were related to differences in COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths in Illinois counties during the first three weeks of the school year. METHODS: We divided Illinois counties into three groups based on the instruction type used for a majority of K-12 students at the start of the school year: in-person, hybrid, or online-only. We used synthetic control analysis to match counties between the three groups. RESULTS: Both majority hybrid and majority online-only counties had significantly fewer new cases than majority in-person counties. There were no significant differences in new cases between majority hybrid counties and majority online-only counties or in new hospital admissions or deaths between any of the three county groups. CONCLUSIONS: This paper adds to the growing scientific consensus that at least some forms of in-person K-12 instruction have not contributed significantly to the spread of the pandemic. However, our results suggest that there may be an important difference between fully in-person instruction and hybrid instruction.","Reinbold, Gary W.",Am J Infect Control,233,1

On molecular level this virus has been studied in detail. However, studying TGEV infection within the complexity of the porcine intestinal epithelium reveals difficulties due to limiting infection models. Here we established a new ex vivo model to analyze the enterotropism of TGEV in porcine intestinal tissue. Precision cut intestinal slices (PCIS) were produced and ATP level was measured to proof vitality of the slices. ATP measurements and HE staining revealed living tissue in culture for up to 24 h. PCIS were infected with three different TGEV strains. TGEV PUR 46-MAD is a commonly used TGEV strain that is known to be attenuated. TGEV Miller was passaged in piglets several times to reveal high infection. Finally, TGEV GFP is a recombinant strain that obtained its main body from TGEV PUR 46-MAD, but its spike protein from TGEV PUR-C11 that showed high mortality in piglets in vivo. Our results were in complete consensus of these statements. TGEV Miller mildly and TGEV GFP extensively infected the cells in the jejunum based on the amount of positive stained epithelial cells. However, for TGEV PUR 46-MAD no nucleocapsid protein was detected in the epithelial cells of the tissue.

To address this challenge, using computational fluid dynamics, we conducted a systematic investigation of airborne transmission in a classroom equipped with a single horizontal unit ventilator (HUV) and evaluate the performance of low-cost box fan air cleaner for risk mitigation. Our study shows that placing box fan air cleaners in the classroom results in a substantial reduction of airborne transmission risk across the entire space. The air cleaner can achieve optimal performance when placed near the asymptomatic patient. However, without knowing the location of the patient, the performance of the cleaner is optimal near the HUV with the air flowing downwards. In addition, we find that it is more efficient in reducing aerosol concentration and spread in the classroom by adding air cleaners in comparison with raising the flow rate of HUV alone. The number and placement of air cleaners need to be adjusted to maintain its efficacy for larger classrooms and to account for the thermal gradient associated with human thermal plume and hot ventilation air during cold seasons. Overall, our study shows that box fan air cleaners can serve as an effective low-cost alternative for mitigating airborne transmission risks in poorly ventilated spaces.","He, R.; Liu, W.; Elson, J.; Vogt, R.; Maranville, C.; Hong, J.",,233,16

Identification of host factors that interact with viral proteins is a fundamental step to understand the pathogenesis of PCV2. Our previous study reported that ORF5, a newly identified PCV2 viral protein supports PCV2 replication and interacts with multiple host factors. Here, we showed that a host factor YWHAB is an ORF5-interacting protein and play essential roles during PCV2 infection. By using protein-protein interaction assays, we confirmed that YWHAB directly interact with PCV2-ORF5 protein. We further showed that YWHAB expression was potently induced upon ORF5 overexpression and PCV2 infection. Remarkably, we found that the YWHAB strongly inhibited PCV2 replication, suggesting its role in defending PCV2 infection. By using the ectopic overexpression and gene knockdown approaches, we revealed that YWHAB inhibits PCV2-induced endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS), autophagy, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and apoptosis, suggesting its vital role in alleviating PCV2-induced cellular damage.

This study examined the impact of social support and social trust on the activities and efficacy of the public’s risk response in the case of COVID-19. We conducted an online survey over eight days with 620 Korean adult participants. Data were analyzed using structural equation modelling and K-means cluster analysis. Our results showed that public support had a positive impact on response efficacy, while response efficacy had a positive impact on sanitation, distancing, and purchasing activities. In addition, social support positively moderated the impact of public and individual support on response efficacy, while response efficacy negatively moderated the impact on sanitation activities. These results suggest that, first, amid viral risk, governments should proactively supply tools and information for infection-prevention, and deliver messages that encourage and support infection-prevention activities among the public. Second, when viral risk occurs, governments, along with all other members of society, must engage in aggressive risk response measures. Third, there is a need for risk communication that further emphasizes the importance of personal sanitation activities in the face of viral risk.","Song, Eugene; Yoo, Hyun Jung",Int J Environ Res Public Health,233,26

Clinical series and testing cohorts based upon screening of symptomatic cases provide biased estimates of susceptibility in children. The role of children and young people in transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is dependent on susceptibility, symptoms, viral load, social contact patterns and behaviour. Methods We undertook a rapid systematic review of contact-tracing studies and population-screening studies to address the question What is the susceptibility to and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by children and adolescents compared with adults? We searched PubMed and medRxiv on 16 May 2020 and identified 6327 studies, with additional studies identified through handsearching of cited references (2) and professional contacts (4). We assessed quality, summarized findings and undertook a random effects meta-analysis of contact-tracing studies. Results 18 studies met inclusion criteria; 9 contact-tracing, 8 population-screening and 1 systematic-review. Meta-analysis of contact tracing studies showed that the pooled odds ratio of being an infected contact in children compared with adults for all contact tracing studies was 0.44 (0.29, 0.69) with substantial heterogeneity (63%). Findings from a systematic review of household clusters of COVID-19 found 3/31 (10%) were due to a child index case and a population-based school contact tracing study found minimal transmission by child or teacher index cases. Findings from population-screening studies were heterogenous and not suitable for meta-analysis. Large studies from Iceland, the Netherlands and Spain and an Italian municipal study showed markedly lower SARS-CoV-2 prevalence amongst children and young people, however studies from Stockholm, England and municipalities in Switzerland and Germany showed showed no difference in infection prevalence between adults and children. Conclusions There is preliminary evidence that children and young people have lower susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2, with a 56% lower odds of being an infected contact. There is weak evidence that children and young people play a lesser role in transmission of SARS-CoV-2 at a population level. Our study provides no information on the infectivity of children.","Viner, R. M.; Mytton, O. T.; Bonell, C.; Melendez-Torres, G. J.; Ward, J.

Here, however, we report data from two experiments challenging this assumption. In the first experiment (N = 48), real-word deviants did not elicit more negative MMNs than pseudoword deviants; the acoustic difference between standard and deviant was identical across these comparisons. In this experiment, the pseudoword deviant [pʰa˨˩] differed from a real-word [pʰa˧˥] in tone only; therefore, to test the possibility that the lexicality effect is real but is restricted to pseudowords that differ from real words by at least one segment, we ran a second experiment which included different items and participants, and also included a control comparison in which the pseudoword ([tsʰei˨˩]) differs from all real words by at least one segment (there is no existing Mandarin morpheme pronounced [tsʰei] in any tone). In the second experiment (N = 36), both types of pseudowords failed to elicit less negative MMNs than real words.

OBJECTIVES: Delineate the different patterns of olfactory disorders recovery in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: This cross-sectional cohort study included 96 patients with olfactory complaint confirmed to be COVID-19 positive with recent onset of anosmia. All patients were inquired for smell recovery patterns using self-assessment questionnaires. RESULTS: Ninety six patients completed the study with mean age 34.26 ± 11.91 years. Most patients had sudden anosmia 83%. Loss of smell was accompanied by nonspecific inflammatory symptoms as low-grade fever (17%) and generalized body ache (25%). Nasal symptoms were reported by 33% of patients. Some patients reported comorbidities as D.M (16%), hypertension (8%) or associated allergic rhinitis (25%), different patterns of olfactory recovery showed 32 patients experiencing full recovery (33.3%) while, 40 patients showed partial recovery (41.7%) after a mean of 11 days while 24 patients (25%) showed no recovery within one month from onset of anosmia. CONCLUSION: The sudden olfactory dysfunction is a common symptom in patients with COVID-19. Hyposmia patients recover more rapidly than anosmic ones while the middle age group carried the best prognosis in olfactory recovery. Females possess better potentiality in regaining smell after recovery and the association of comorbidities worsen the recovery rate of olfactory dysfunction in patients with COVID19.

However, there is little information linking stunting with mycotoxin contamination of complementary foods. The aim of this study was to assess knowledge about aflatoxin and fumonisin contamination in sorghum alongside postharvest handling and storage practices among caregivers of children under five years old in Kerio Valley, Kenya. A cross‐sectional study was conducted to obtain data from 353 randomly selected caregivers of children aged 6–59 months. Qualitative data were obtained through Focus Group Discussions and Key Informant Interviews. Overall, majority of the caregivers of young children had poor knowledge (61.8%) about mycotoxin contamination of food, and poor postharvest handling and storage practices (74.5%). The caregiver's knowledge about mycotoxins was significantly associated with age [(AOR=4.629, (95% Cl: 2.530–8.472), p < .001], education level [(AOR=0.275, (95% Cl: 0.088–0.434), p = .001], marital status [(AOR=15.187, (95% Cl: 1.830–126.007), p = .012], and household monthly income [(AOR=2.623, (95% Cl: 1.550–4.439), p < 0,001]. Furthermore, the caregiver's age [(AOR=3.845, (95% Cl: 1.558–9.490), p = .003], education level [(AOR=0.196, (95% Cl: 0.088–0.434), p < .001], monthly income [(AOR=3.291, (95% Cl: 1.550–6.986), p = .002], and knowledge on mycotoxin contamination of sorghum [AOR, 5.428 (95% Cl: 2.855–10.319), p < .001] were significantly associated with postharvest handling and storage practices except for marital status [AOR, 3.579 (95% Cl: 0.403–31.775), p = .252]. In conclusion, caregivers of young children had poor knowledge about mycotoxin contamination of complementary foods and suboptimal postharvest handling and storage practices of sorghum. This increases the risk of mycotoxin exposure to young children and necessitates mitigation measures including sensitization campaigns and social behavior change communication.","Lesuuda, Lmeriai; Obonyo, Meshack Amos; Cheserek, Maureen Jepkorir",Food Sci Nutr,233,20

The effects are surprisingly fast and specific. The present review explores our current knowledge about the routes of access to the cranial cavity. ‘Direct-access-pathways’ from the nasal cavity have been described but many additional experiments are needed to answer a variety of open questions regarding anatomy and physiology. Among the IN-applied substances oxytocin (OT) has an extensive history. Originally applied in women for its physiological effects related to lactation and parturition, over the last decade most studies focused on their behavioral ‘prosocial’ effects: from social relations and ‘trust’ to treatment of ‘autism’. Only very recently in a microdialysis study in rats and mice, the ‘direct-nose-brain-pathways’ of IN-OT have been investigated directly, implying that we are strongly dependent on results obtained from other IN-applied substances. Especially the possibility that IN-OT activates the ‘intrinsic’ OT-system in the hypothalamus as well needs further clarification. We conclude that IN-OT administration may be a promising approach to influence human communication but that the existing lack of information about the neural and physiological mechanisms involved is a serious problem for the proper understanding and interpretation of the observed effects.","Veening, Jan G.; Olivier, Berend",Neurosci Biobehav Rev,233,30

METHODS: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted to determine knowledge, attitudes and practices towards COVID-19 and its associated factors among religious clerics and traditional healers in Gondar town. Study participants who met our inclusion criteria were selected using a simple random sampling technique. Data were collected by trained data collectors through face-to-face interviews. The reliability of the questionnaire was assessed using Cronbach’s alpha. Knowledge, attitudes and practices scores were calculated to give the overall knowledge, attitude and practice score. Binary logistic regression was fitted to identify associated factors and odds ratio was used to measure the strength of the association. RESULTS: A total of 410 religious clerics and traditional healers were included in the study with a response rate of 97.1%. Of the total participants, 60.7% (95%: CI (56–65%)) had good knowledge, 34.1% (95%: CI (30–39%)) had a positive attitude and 15.6% (95%: CI (12–19%)) had good practices towards prevention and early detection of COVID-19. Less than one third of the participants practiced physical distancing (28%) and facemask use (17.8%). In multivariate logistic regression, age, educational status and marital status were significantly associated with knowledge score. Likewise, age and marital status were significantly associated with the positive attitude score. In addition, age, educational status, and the presence of underlying disease were significantly associated with the good practice score. CONCLUSION: Majority of the participants had poor practice and negative attitudes. Therefore, there should be a sensitization program to fill the gap in the knowledge, attitudes and practice measures of COVID-19 especially for elderly and illiterates.","Asmelash, Daniel; Fasil, Alebachew; Tegegne, Yalewayker; Akalu, Temesgen Yihunie; Ferede, Habtamu Asfaw; Aynalem, Getie Lake",Risk Manag Healthc Policy,233,1

METHODS: This article reviews the main articles that have been published so far about the direct and indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on these particularly fragile populations. RESULTS: The pandemic associated to COVID-19 has shifted most of the health resources to the emergency area and has consequently left the three main medical areas dealing with the elderly population (oncology, time-dependent diseases and degenerative disease) temporarily “uncovered”. In the phase following the emergency, it will be crucial to guarantee to each area the economic and organizational resources to quickly return to the level of support of the prepandemic state. CONCLUSIONS: The emergency phase represented a significant occasion of discussion on the possibilities of telemedicine which will inevitably become increasingly important, but all the limits of its use in the elderly population have to be considered. In the post-lockdown recovery phase, alongside the classic medical evaluation, the psychological evaluation must become even more important for doctors caring about people with cognitive decline as well as with their caregivers.","Iodice, Francesco; Cassano, Valeria; Rossini, Paolo M.",Neurol Sci,233,18

The clinical limitation of current antiviral drugs for HBV, such as lamivudine, is the emergence of drug-resistant viral strains during prolonged antiviral therapy. Cepharanthine hydrochloride (CH), a natural alkaloid-derived compound, has been reported to possess potent activity against various viruses. The present study was performed to evaluate the in vitro activity of CH against clinical wild-type and lamivudine-resistant HBV isolates in transiently transfected cells. HBV DNA was extracted from serum samples collected both before lamivudine therapy and at the time of viral breakthrough and was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The amplicons were cloned into a novel expression vector, pHY106, which can initiate the intracellular HBV replication cycle after cell transfection. Following transfection of the cloned amplicon into HepG2 cells, a drug susceptibility assay was performed. The level of viral antigen, HBeAg, was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Quantitative real-time PCR (Q-PCR) was used for determining the amount of intracellular HBV DNA. Heat stress cognate 70 (Hsc70), a host protein required for HBV replication, was also analyzed by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) to explore the possible antiviral mechanism of CH. The results showed that CH inhibited replication and HBeAg production by either wild-type or lamivudine-resistant HBV clinical isolates in a dose-dependent manner. The Hsc70 mRNA was also downregulated significantly. In conclusion, CH is active against both wild-type and lamivudine-resistant HBV clinical isolates, and its activity may be associated with its inhibition of host Hsc70.","Zhou, Yu-Bing; Wang, Ya-Feng; Zhang, Yan; Zheng, Li-Yun; Yang, Xiao-Ang; Wang, Ning; Jiang, Jin-Hua; Ma, Fang; Yin, De-Tao; Sun, Chang-Yu; Wang, Qing-Duan",Eur J Pharmacol,233,11

METHODS We undertook a longitudinal study of 20 of 51 consecutive CVD patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) who met the study criteria. We used the Life-Space Assessment (LSA) tool to evaluate Life-space mobility and assessed QoL with the five-level EuroQoL five-dimensional questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L) in Japanese. RESULTS The LSA scores and EQ-5D-5L QoL score decreased significantly from the pre- to post-nationwide state of emergency in Japan (p < 0.01). ΔLSA was significantly positively associated with body mass index and significantly negatively associated with knee extensor muscle strength and pre-LSA score (p < 0.05). There were no significant relationships between ΔLSA and ΔEQ-5D-5L QoL scores and between ΔEQ-5D-5L QoL scores and patient characteristics. CONCLUSION The policies promoted to address the state of emergency in Japan might affect life-space mobility and QoL of CAD patients. Moreover, CAD patients in Japan who were not obese and maintained their physical function and activity tended to refrain from activity during the period between the pre- and post-nationwide state of emergency. Clarification of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the relationship between living space motility and QoL in CAD patients will require further study.","Ishihara, Kodai; Izawa, Kazuhiro P; Noto, Shinichi; Shimizu, Ikki",Reviews on recent clinical trials,233,20

However, detailed information on community- and hospital-acquired infections among patients with COVID-19 pneumonia is scarce. METHODS: We identified 220 SARS-CoV-2-positive patients hospitalized at the University Hospital Basel, Switzerland (between 25 February and 31 May 2020). We excluded patients who declined the general consent (n = 12), patients without clinical evidence of pneumonia (n = 29), and patients hospitalized for < 24 h (n = 17). We evaluated the frequency of community- and hospital-acquired infections using respiratory and blood culture materials with antigen, culture-based, and molecular diagnostics. For ICU patients, all clinical and microbial findings were re-evaluated interdisciplinary (intensive care, infectious disease, and clinical microbiology), and agreement reached to classify patients with infections. RESULTS: In the final cohort of 162 hospitalized patients (median age 64.4 years (IQR, 50.4–74.2); 61.1% male), 41 (25.3%) patients were admitted to the intensive care unit, 34/41 (82.9%) required mechanical ventilation, and 17 (10.5%) of all hospitalized patients died. In total, 31 infections were diagnosed including five viral co-infections, 24 bacterial infections, and three fungal infections (ventilator-associated pneumonia, n = 5; tracheobronchitis, n = 13; pneumonia, n = 1; and bloodstream infection, n = 6). Median time to respiratory tract infection was 12.5 days (IQR, 8–18) and time to bloodstream infection 14 days (IQR, 6–30). Hospital-acquired bacterial and fungal infections were more frequent among ICU patients than other patients (36.6% vs. 1.7%). Antibiotic or antifungal treatment was administered in 71 (43.8%) patients. CONCLUSIONS: Community-acquired viral and bacterial infections were rare among COVID-19 pneumonia patients.

Since the undetected cases are not quarantined, they are expected to transmit the infection at a much higher rate than their quarantined counterparts. That is, under the lack of extensive random testing, the actual prevalence and incidence of the SARS-CoV-2 infection may be entirely different from that being reported. Thus, it is imperative that the information on the percentage of undetected (or unreported) cases be considered while estimating the parameters and forecasting the transmission dynamics of the epidemic. In this paper, we have developed a new version of the basic susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) compartmental model, called the susceptible-infected (quarantined/ free) - recovered- deceased [SI(Q/F)RD] model, to incorporate the impact of undetected cases on the transmission dynamics of the epidemic. Further, we have presented a Dirichlet-Beta state-space formulation of the SI(Q/F)RD model for the estimation of its parameters using posterior realizations from Gibbs sampling procedure.

Although tree canopy in residential areas has been shown to positively affect psychological distress, it is not clear whether the COVID-19 epidemic played a role in this process. Elucidation of the relationship between tree canopy and the impact on psychological distress during the COVID-19 epidemic could provide valuable information as to the best methods to help individuals cope with urban mental stress events. METHODS: A total of 15 randomly selected residential areas of Beijing were enrolled in this repeated cross-sectional study. A total of 900 residents were included in the two-waves of the investigation (450 residents per wave) before and during the COVID-19 epidemic (i.e., May 2019 and May 2020). Psychological distress was estimated using the 12-question General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). Tree canopy coverage (TCC) was measured through visual interpretation based on the 2013 data sources (World View 2 satellite imagery of Beijing urban areas with a resolution of 0.5 m). The demographic characteristics, distance to the nearest surrounding green or blue space, residential area house price, household density, and construction year were also collected in this study. A multivariate logistic regression, relative risk due to interaction (RERI), and synergy index (SI) were used to explore the relationships among tree canopy, COVID-19, and psychological distress. RESULTS: The negative impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on mental health was significant, with the prevalence of psychological distress increased 7.84 times (aOR = 7.84, 95% CI = 4.67-13.95) during the COVID-19 epidemic period.

An increase in 1% of TCC, was related to a 5% decrease in the prevalence of psychological distress (aOR = 0.95, 95% CI = 0.93-0.98). An antagonism joint action between tree canopy and the COVID-19 epidemic existed (RERI = 1.09, 95% CI = 0.72-1.47; SI = 0.16, 95% CI = 0.05-0.52), and persisted enhancing only in medium (26.45%-33.21%) and above TCC level. Correlation of GHQ items and TCC significantly differed between the COVID-19 non-epidemic and epidemic periods, with the effects of tree canopy on GHQ-12 items covering topics, such as social function and depression, presumably absent because of epidemic limitations. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that the COVID-19 epidemic harmed mental health and verified the positive effects of residential tree canopy on psychological distress in Beijing. We suggest paying more attention to residents in areas of low TCC and dealing with psychological distress caused by public health stress events based on tree canopy strategies.","Zhang, Chang; Wang, Cheng; Chen, Chao; Tao, Liyuan; Jin, Jiali; Wang, Ziyan; Jia, Baoquan",Environ Res,233,16

For this purpose, they offer, among other things, a structured seminar program for post-graduate trainees in general practice (GP-trainees). During the Covid-19 pandemic the seminar program of the KWBW-Verbundweiterbildung(plus®) in Baden-Württemberg was converted to digital formats. The goal of the paper is to evaluate the acceptance by the GP-trainees and lecturers, to describe experiences with the conversion to e-learning and to derive recommendations with regard to the future orientation of seminar programs in post-graduate as well as continuing medical education. The implementation was based on a modified Kern-cycle and aimed at offering eight teaching units of 45 minutes each to a large number of GP-trainees. It tried to maintain the high quality of content and education as well as the interactive character of the previous seminars. For this purpose, the events were designed as synchronous webinars (six units) with asynchronous preparation and post-processing (two units) according to the flipped classroom method. The evaluation by the participating GP-trainees and lecturers was performed online using a multi-center developed and pre-piloted questionnaire. Results and discussion: N=101 GP-trainees participated in the evaluation of five individual seminar days in the second quarter of 2020 (response rate 97%). 58% (N=59) of the trainees were satisfied or very satisfied with the implementation. 82% (n=83) rated pre-tasks as helpful. 99% (n=100) would participate in an online seminar again. For 52% (n=53) of the trainees, the attitude towards e-learning had changed positively. The main advantages mentioned were no travel, save in time and costs as well as increased flexibility. The main disadvantages mentioned were less personal interaction and technical obstacles. The high acceptance of the new digital format showed the fundamental potential of e-learning in continuing medical education. The experiences can be a source of inspiration for other departments and KW. However, it also shows that important goals of KW, such as the personal interaction of the peer group, could not be achieved. In the future, it is important to develop a suitable mix of presence and digital formats with the aim to improve the attractiveness as well as sustainability of continuing medical education.","Förster, Christian; Eismann-Schweimler, Jessica; Stengel, Sandra; Bischoff, Martina; Fuchs, Monika; Graf von Luckner, Andreas; Ledig, Thomas; Barzel, Anne; Maun, Andy; Joos, Stefanie; Szecsenyi, Joachim; Schwill, Simon",GMS J Med Educ,233,10

While the lungs are the primary target for the SARS-CoV-2-mediated pathological consequence, SARS-CoV-2 appear to invade the brain and cause neurological deficits. In the later stage, COVID-19 can progress to pneumonia, acute respiratory failure, neurological deficits and multi-organ dysfunctions leading to death. Though a significant portion of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals has been recovering from pathological symptoms, the impact of the COVID-19 on the structural and functional properties of the lungs, heart, brain and other organs at the post-recovery state remains unknown. Presently, there is an urgent need for a remedial measure to combat this devastating COVID-19. Botulinum toxins (BoNTs) are potent neurotoxins that can induce paralysis of muscle and acute respiratory arrest in human. However, a mild dose of the purified form of BoNT has been known to attenuate chronic cough, dyspnoea, pneumonia, acute respiratory failure, abnormal circulation, cardiac defects and various neurological deficits that have been recognised as the prominent clinical symptoms of COVID-19. Considering the fact, this review article provides 1) an overview on the SARS-CoV-2 mediated pathological impact on the lungs, heart and brain, 2) signifies the therapeutic uses of BoNTs against pulmonary failure, cardiac arrest and neurological deficits, and 3) emphasize the rationality for the possible use of BoNT to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection and manage COVID-19.","Kandasamy, Mahesh",Med Drug Discov,233,5

However, select mRNAs, including the transcript encoding interleukin-6 (IL-6), escape SOX-induced cleavage. IL-6 escape is mediated through a 3’ UTR RNA regulatory element that overrides the SOX targeting mechanism. Here, we reveal that this protective RNA element functions to broadly restrict cleavage by a range of homologous and non-homologous viral endonucleases. However, it does not impede cleavage by cellular endonucleases. The IL-6 protective sequence may be representative of a larger class of nuclease escape elements, as we identified a similar protective element in the GADD45B mRNA. The IL-6 and GADD45B-derived elements display similarities in their sequence, putative structure, and several associated RNA binding proteins. However, the overall composition of their ribonucleoprotein complexes appears distinct, leading to differences in the breadth of nucleases restricted. These findings highlight how RNA elements can selectively control transcript abundance in the background of widespread virus-induced mRNA degradation.","Muller, Mandy; Glaunsinger, Britt A.",PLoS Pathog,233,7

DESIGN: This is a modelling study combining estimates of real-time reproduction number R(t) (derived from UK case, death and serological survey data) with publicly available data on regional non-pharmaceutical interventions. We fit a Bayesian hierarchical model with latent factors using these quantities to account for broader national trends in addition to subnational effects from tiers. SETTING: The UK at lower tier local authority (LTLA) level. 310 LTLAs were included in the analysis. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Reduction in real-time reproduction number R(t). RESULTS: Nationally, transmission increased between July and late September, regional differences notwithstanding. Immediately prior to the introduction of the tier system, R(t) averaged 1.3 (0.9–1.6) across LTLAs, but declined to an average of 1.1 (0.86–1.42) 2 weeks later. Decline in transmission was not solely attributable to tiers. Tier 1 had negligible effects. Tiers 2 and 3, respectively, reduced transmission by 6% (5%–7%) and 23% (21%–25%). 288 LTLAs (93%) would have begun to suppress their epidemics if every LTLA had gone into tier 3 by the second national lockdown, whereas only 90 (29%) did so in reality. CONCLUSIONS: The relatively small effect sizes found in this analysis demonstrate that interventions at least as stringent as tier 3 are required to suppress transmission, especially considering more transmissible variants, at least until effective vaccination is widespread or much greater population immunity has amassed.","Laydon, Daniel J; Mishra, Swapnil; Hinsley, Wes R; Samartsidis, Pantelis; Flaxman, Seth; Gandy, Axel; Ferguson, Neil M; Bhatt, Samir",BMJ Open,233,13

In the present work, Lipinski's rules and molecular docking have been performed to identify plausible inhibitors of M(pro) using food compounds. For virtual screening, a database of food compounds was downloaded and then filtered using Lipinski's rule of five. Then, molecular docking was accomplished to identify hits using M(pro) protein as the target enzyme. This led to identification of a Spermidine derivative as a hit. In the next step, Spermidine derivatives were collected from PubMed and screened for their binding with M(pro) protein. In addition, molecular dynamic simulations (200 ns) were executed to get additional information. Some of the compounds are found to have strong affinity for M(pro), therefore these hits could be used to develop a therapeutic agent for SARS-CoV-2.","Masand, Vijay H.; Sk, Md Fulbabu; Kar, Parimal; Rastija, Vesna; Zaki, Magdi E.A.",Chemometr Intell Lab Syst,233,29

Accordingly, the development of efficient antiviral therapies is a major goal and a challenge for the scientific community, as we are still far from understanding the molecular mechanisms that operate after virus infection. Interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) plays an important antiviral role during viral infection. ISG15 catalyzes a ubiquitin-like post-translational modification termed ISGylation, involving the conjugation of ISG15 molecules to de novo synthesized viral or cellular proteins, which regulates their stability and function. Numerous biomedically relevant viruses are targets of ISG15, as well as proteins involved in antiviral immunity. Beyond their role as cellular powerhouses, mitochondria are multifunctional organelles that act as signaling hubs in antiviral responses. In this review, we give an overview of the biological consequences of ISGylation for virus infection and host defense. We also compare several published proteomic studies to identify and classify potential mitochondrial ISGylation targets. Finally, based on our recent observations, we discuss the essential functions of mitochondria in the antiviral response and examine the role of ISG15 in the regulation of mitochondrial processes, specifically OXPHOS and mitophagy.","Albert, Manuel; Bécares, Martina; Falqui, Michela; Fernández-Lozano, Carlos; Guerra, Susana",Viruses,233,1

Brazil is the second country with more deaths due to COVID-19. We aimed to evaluate excess cardiovascular mortality during COVID-19 pandemic in 6 Brazilian capital cities. METHODS: Using the Civil Registry public database, we evaluated total and cardiovascular excess deaths, further stratified in specified cardiovascular deaths (acute coronary syndromes and stroke) and unspecified cardiovascular deaths in the 6 Brazilian cities with greater number of COVID-19 deaths (São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Fortaleza, Recife, Belém, Manaus). We compared observed with expected deaths from epidemiological weeks 12–22 of 2020. We also compared the number of hospital and home deaths during the period. RESULTS: There were 65 449 deaths and 17 877 COVID-19 deaths in the studied period and cities for 2020. Cardiovascular mortality increased in most cities, with greater magnitude in the Northern capitals. However, while there was a reduction in specified cardiovascular deaths in the most cities, the Northern capitals showed an increase of these events. For unspecified cardiovascular deaths, there was a marked increase in all cities, which strongly correlated to the rise in home deaths (r=0.86, p=0.01). CONCLUSION: Excess cardiovascular mortality was greater in the less developed cities, possibly associated with healthcare collapse. Specified cardiovascular deaths decreased in the most developed cities, in parallel with an increase in unspecified cardiovascular and home deaths, presumably as a result of misdiagnosis. Conversely, specified cardiovascular deaths increased in cities with a healthcare collapse.","Brant, Luisa Campos Caldeira; Nascimento, Bruno Ramos; Teixeira, Renato Azeredo; Lopes, Marcelo Antônio Cartaxo Queiroga; Malta, Deborah Carvalho; Oliveira, Glaucia Maria Moraes; Ribeiro, Antonio Luiz Pinho",Heart,233,15

Although the number of infected cases is increasing, information about its clinical characteristics in the Middle East, especially in Iran, a country which is considered to be one of the most important focal points of the disease in the world, is lacking. To date, there is no available literature on the clinical data on COVID-19 patients in Iran. METHODS: In this multicenter retrospective study, 113 hospitalized confirmed cases of COVID-19 admitted to university affiliated hospitals in Shiraz, Iran from February 20 to March 20 were entered in the study. RESULTS: The mean age was 53.75 years and 71 (62.8%) were males. The most common symptoms at onset were fatigue (75: 66.4%), cough (73: 64.6%), and fever (67: 59.3%). Laboratory data revealed significant correlation between lymphocyte count (P value = 0.003), partial thromboplastin time (P value = 0.000), international normalized ratio (P value = 0.000) with the severity of the disease. The most common abnormality in chest CT scans was ground-glass opacity (77: 93.9%), followed by consolidation (48: 58.5%). Our results revealed an overall 8% (9 out of 113 cases) mortality rate among patients, in which the majority was among patients admitted to the ICU (5: 55.6%).

Younger age was associated with higher susceptibility. In the future, household transmission studies will provide information on transmission dynamics including the correlation of virus shedding and symptoms with transmission, and the correlation of new measures of immunity with protection against infection.","Tsang, Tim K.; Lau, Lincoln L.

Approximately two thirds of this biome are located within Brazilian territory. There, socio-economic and environmental landscape transformations are linked to the regional agrarian economy dynamics, which has developed into six techno-productive trajectories (TTs). These TTs are the product of the historical interaction between Peasant and Farmer and Rancher practices, technologies and rationalities. This article investigates the distribution of the dominant Brazilian Amazon TTs and their association with environmental degradation and vulnerability to neglected tropical diseases. The goal is to provide a framework for the joint debate of the local economic, environmental and health dimensions. We calculated the dominant TT for each municipality in 2017. Peasant trajectories (TT1, TT2, and TT3) are dominant in ca. fifty percent of the Amazon territory, mostly concentrated in areas covered by continuous forest where malaria is an important morbidity and mortality cause. Cattle raising trajectories are associated with higher deforestation rates. Meanwhile, Farmer and Rancher economies are becoming dominant trajectories, comprising large scale cattle and grain production. These trajectories are associated with rapid biodiversity loss and a high prevalence of neglected tropical diseases, such as leishmaniasis, Aedes-borne diseases and Chagas disease. Overall, these results defy simplistic views that the dominant development trajectory for the Amazon will optimize economic, health and environmental indicators. This approach lays the groundwork for a more integrated narrative consistent with the economic history of the Brazilian Amazon.","Codeço, Claudia T.; Dal'Asta, Ana P.; Rorato, Ana C.; Lana, Raquel M.; Neves, Tatiana C.; Andreazzi, Cecilia S.; Barbosa, Milton; Escada, Maria I.

We are all aware of the profound social and economic consequences of the pandemic (WHO, 2020)”. Such consequences are the result of counter-measures such as lockdowns, and world-wide reductions in production and consumption, amplified by cascading impacts through international supply chains. Using a global multi-regional macro-economic model, we capture direct and indirect spill-over effects in terms of social and economic losses, as well as environmental effects of the pandemic. Based on information as of May 2020, we show that global consumption losses amount to 3.8$tr, triggering significant job (147 million full-time equivalent) and income (2.1$tr) losses. Global atmospheric emissions are reduced by 2.5Gt of greenhouse gases, 0.6Mt of PM(2.5), and 5.1Mt of SO(2) and NO(x). While Asia, Europe and the USA have been the most directly impacted regions, and transport and tourism the immediately hit sectors, the indirect effects transmitted along international supply chains are being felt across the entire world economy.

This is particularly important in the face of emerging viral pathogens that may pose a threat to blood recipients, as in the case of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, PRTs have some limitations, primarily related to their adverse effects on coagulation factors, which should be considered before their intended use. A comprehensive search of PubMed, Wiley Online Library and Science Direct databases was conducted to identify original papers. As a result, ten studies evaluating fresh plasma and frozen-thawed plasma treated with different PI/ PDI methods and evaluating concentrations of coagulation factors and natural anticoagulants both before and after photochemical treatment were included in the review. The use of PI and PDI is associated with a significant decrease in the activity of all analysed coagulation factors, while the recovery of natural anticoagulants remains at a satisfactory level, variable for individual inactivation methods. In addition, the published evidence reviewed above does not unequivocally favour the implementation of PI/PDI either before freezing or after thawing as plasma products obtained with these two approaches seem to satisfy the existing quality criteria. Based on current evidence, if implemented responsibly and in accordance with the current guidelines, both PI and PDI can ensure satisfactory plasma quality and improve its safety.","Wasiluk, Tomasz; Rogowska, Anna; Boczkowska-Radziwon, Barbara; Zebrowska, Agnieszka; Bolkun, Lukasz; Piszcz, Jaroslaw; Radziwon, Piotr",Transfus Apher Sci,233,1

Although the COVID-19 pandemic is expected to have had an impact on the work of anesthesiologists, the specific impact has been largely unreported. We hypothesized that the number of general anesthesia (GA) cases has decreased due to the COVID-19 pandemic. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a retrospective survey at 34 facilities in Japan as a part of the Japanese Epidemiologic Study for Perioperative Anaphylaxis. The results showed that the number of GA cases had significantly decreased, particularly in May 2020, under the government's declaration of a state of emergency. The decline in GA caseload had not fully recovered by July 2020. Furthermore, there were regional differences in the decline in the number of GA cases. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the work of anesthesiologists was greater in prefectures where there were more COVID-19 patients and where the state of emergency was declared earlier. Our study suggested a region-dependent decrease in the number of GA cases due to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Takazawa, Tomonori; Sugiyama, Yuki; Amano, Yasuhiro; Hara, Tetsuhito; Kanemaru, Eiki; Kato, Takao; Kawano, Takashi; Kochiyama, Tsukasa; Tsuji, Tatsuya; Saito, Shigeru",Anesthesiol Res Pract,233,16

Vaccination is a critical part of controlling community spread, but vaccine acceptance has varied, with some research reporting that Black individuals in the US are less willing to be vaccinated than other racial/ethnic groups. Medical mistrust informed by experiences of racism may be associated with this lower willingness. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between race/ethnicity and rejection of COVID-19 vaccine trial participation and vaccine uptake and to investigate whether racial/ethnic group–based medical mistrust is a potential mediator of this association. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional survey study was conducted from June to December 2020 using a convenience sample of 1835 adults aged 18 years or older residing in Michigan. Participants were recruited through community-based organizations and hospital-academic networks. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Separate items assessed whether respondents, if asked, would agree to participate in a research study to test a COVID-19 vaccine or to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. Participants also completed the suspicion subscale of the Group-Based Medical Mistrust Scale. RESULTS: Of the 1835 participants, 1455 (79%) were women, 361 (20%) men, and 19 (1%) other gender. The mean (SD) age was 49.4 (17.9) years, and 394 participants (21%) identified as Black individuals. Overall, 1376 participants (75%) reported low willingness to participate in vaccine trials, and 945 (52%) reported low willingness to be vaccinated. Black participants reported the highest medical mistrust scores (mean [SD], 2.35 [0.96]) compared with other racial/ethnic groups (mean [SD] for the total sample, 1.83 [0.91]). Analysis of path models revealed significantly greater vaccine trial and vaccine uptake rejection among Black participants (vaccine trial: B [SE], 0.51 [0.08]; vaccine uptake: B [SE], 0.51 [0.08]; both P < .001) compared with the overall mean rejection. The association was partially mediated by medical mistrust among Black participants (vaccine trial: B [SE], 0.04 [0.01]; P = .003; vaccine uptake: B [SE], 0.07 [0.02]; P < .001) and White participants (vaccine trial: B [SE], −0.06 [0.02]; P = .001; vaccine uptake: B [SE], −0.10 [0.02]; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this survey study of US adults, racial/ethnic group–based medical mistrust partially mediated the association between individuals identifying as Black and low rates of acceptance of COVID-19 vaccine trial participation and actual vaccination. The findings suggest that partnerships between health care and other sectors to build trust and promote vaccination may benefit from socially and culturally responsive strategies that acknowledge and address racial/ethnic health care disparities and historical and contemporary experiences of racism.","Thompson, Hayley S.; Manning, Mark; Mitchell, Jamie; Kim, Seongho; Harper, Felicity W.

However, polymerase chain reaction amplification from cDNA templates produced by reverse transcription has generally been restricted to products of less than 10 kilobases. In this paper, we report a system to effectively amplify fragments up to 20 kilobases from human coronavirus 229E genomic RNA. We demonstrate that the integrity of the RNA template and the prevention of false priming events during reverse transcription are the critical parameters to achieve the synthesis of long cDNAs. The optimization of the polymerase chain reaction conditions enabled us to improve the specificity and yield of product but they were not definitive. Finally, we have shown that the same reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction technology can be used for the amplification of extended regions of the dystrophin mRNA, a cellular RNA of relatively low abundance.","Thiel, Volker; Rashtchian, Ayoub; Herold, Jens; Schuster, David M.; Guan, Nin; Siddell, Stuart G.",Analytical Biochemistry,233,1

IPA has been recently described in critically ill COVID-19 patients (termed as COVID-associated pulmonary aspergillosis, or CAPA) that are otherwise immunocompetent. In order to describe the characteristics of patients with CAPA, we conducted a retrospective cohort study in a tertiary care center in Mexico City. We included all patients with confirmed COVID-19 admitted to the intensive care unit that had serum or bronchoalveolar lavage galactomannan measurements. We used the criteria proposed by Koehler et al. to establish the diagnosis of CAPA. Main outcomes were the need for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) and in-hospital mortality. Out of a total of 83 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in the ICU, 16 (19.3%) met the criteria for CAPA. All patients diagnosed with CAPA required IMV whereas only 84% of the patients in the non-IPA group needed this intervention (P = 0.09). In the IPA group, 31% (n = 5) of the patients died, compared to 13% (n = 9) in the non-CAPA group (P = 0.08). We conclude that CAPA is a frequent co-infection in critically ill COVID-19 patients and is associated with a high mortality rate. The timely diagnosis and treatment of IPA in these patients is likely to improve their outcome. LAY SUMMARY: We studied the characteristics of patients with COVID-19-associated invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA). Patients with CAPA tended to need invasive mechanical ventilation more frequently and to have a higher mortality rate.

METHODS: This retrospective study enrolled 16 real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction-confirmed symptomatic patients with COVID-19 and 58 COVID-19 negative patients at a medical center in Taiwan over a 3-month period. Serial serum samples were collected and tested for antibody response using four point-of-care (POC) lateral flow immunoassays (LFIA) (ALLTEST 2019-nCoV IgG/IgM Rapid Test, Dynamiker 2019-nCoV IgG/IgM Rapid Test, ASK COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test, and Wondfo SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Test). Time-dependent detection sensitivity and timeliness of seroconversion were determined and compared between the four POC rapid tests. RESULTS: The overall sensitivity and specificity of the four tests for detecting anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies after 3 weeks of symptom onset were 100% and 100%, respectively. There was no significant difference between the rapid tests used for detection of IgM and IgG separately and those used for detection of combined total antibody (mainly IgM/IgG). There was no significant difference between the four POC rapid tests in terms of time required for determining seroconversion of COVID-19. Patients with COVID-19 with pneumonia demonstrated shorter seroconversion time than those without pneumonia. CONCLUSION: Though the POC antibody rapid tests based on LFIA showed reliable performance in the detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies, the results of these tests should be interpreted and applied appropriately in the context of antibody dynamic of COVID-19 infection. COVID-19 patients complicated with pneumonia exhibited earlier anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody response than COVID-19 patients without pneumonia.","Wu, Jhong-Lin; Tseng, Wen-Pin; Lin, Chien-Hao; Lee, Tai-Fen; Chung, Ming-Yi; Huang, Chien-Hua; Chen, Shey-Ying; Hsueh, Po-Ren; Chen, Shyr-Chyr",J Infect,233,29

Participants were recruited from 16 general hospitals in Anhui province from February 2020 to March 2020. The general sociodemographic questionnaire, Nurse Job Stressors Scale, Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire, NEO Five-Factor Inventory, Perceived Social Support Scale, and Kessler Psychological Distress Scale were used in this study. Based on 723 valid questionnaires retrieved (100%), the total mean scores of work stressors and mental health of frontline nurses were (94.38±23.42) and (22.81±7.16), respectively. The results of the structural equation model showed that work stressors had an indirect positive effect (β=0.484, P<0.01), social support had a direct negative effect (β=-0.934, P<0.01), personality traits had a direct positive effect (β=0.209, P<0.01), and positive coping style had both direct positive (β=0.246, P<0.01) and indirect negative effects (β=-0.873, P<0.01) on frontline nurses’ mental health. In conclusion, nursing staff can reinforce positive influences by accepting social support, adopting positive coping methods, and weakening negative influences factors to reduce or buffer their negative mental states and further reduce work stress.","Shaohua, Hu; Dai, Qing; Wang, Ting; Zhang, Qianqian; Li, Chaoqun; He, Hongye",Ann Med Psychol (Paris),233,1

Chinese government has emphasized the importance of reducing carbon emissions and set the target of reducing carbon intensity to 60–65% of 2005 levels by 2030. Investigating the convergence of carbon intensity can identify the convergence rate, which is helpful in guiding allocations of carbon intensity reduction. The Yangtze River Delta is one of the key carbon emission regions in China, with higher urbanization levels and larger carbon emissions; thus, we employed prefecture-level panel data derived from grid data between 2000 and 2010 to examine whether the convergence of carbon intensity exists across prefecture-level cities in the Yangtze River Delta. Spatial panel data models were utilized to investigate β-convergence of carbon intensity. The results indicated that carbon intensity showed divergence during 2002–2004 and σ-convergence over other periods (2000–2002 and 2004–2010). Carbon intensity exhibited stochastic convergence, indicating that the shocks to carbon intensity relative to the average level of carbon intensity are only transitory. There was a spatial spillover effect and β-convergence of carbon intensity, suggesting that prefecture-level cities with higher carbon intensity would decrease rapidly in the Yangtze River Delta. Our results highlight the importance of considering the present state of carbon intensity, spatial factors, and socioeconomic factors such as industrial structure and economic levels during allocation planning for reducing carbon intensity.","Li, Jianbao; Huang, Xianjin; Yang, Hong; Chuai, Xiaowei; Wu, Changyan",Habitat Int,233,26

Wastewater samples were collected at eleven timepoints in Reykjavik from 2017 to 2020. The use of commonly abused illicit drugs in Iceland (amphetamine, methamphetamine, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), cocaine, and cannabis) was estimated. Solid phase extraction and ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry was used for analysis. Estimated amphetamine and methamphetamine use showed signs of an increase from 2017 to 2020 with amphetamine being the dominant stimulant on the market. MDMA use remained stable from 2017 to 2020. Results showed a large increase in cocaine use from 2017 to 2019 but interestingly, a marked decrease in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. Cannabis use was stable from 2017 to 2019 but showed signs of an increase during the pandemic in 2020. Results by WBE corresponded with data based on two other indicators of drug use, seizure data and driving under the influence cases.

Thermal protection of the oesophageal lumen by infusing cold liquid reduces thermal injury to a limited extent. We tested the ability of a more powerful method of oesophageal temperature control to reduce the incidence of thermal injury. METHODS AND RESULTS : A single-centre, prospective, double-blinded randomized trial was used to investigate the ability of the ensoETM device to protect the oesophagus from thermal injury. This device was compared in a 1:1 randomization with a control group of standard practice utilizing a single-point temperature probe. In the protected group, the device maintained the luminal temperature at 4°C during radiofrequency (RF) ablation for AF under general anaesthesia. Endoscopic examination was performed at 7 days post-ablation and oesophageal injury was scored. The patient and the endoscopist were blinded to the randomization. We recruited 188 patients, of whom 120 underwent endoscopy. Thermal injury to the mucosa was significantly more common in the control group than in those receiving oesophageal protection (12/60 vs. 2/60; P = 0.008), with a trend toward reduction in gastroparesis (6/60 vs. 2/60, P = 0.27). There was no difference between groups in the duration of RF or in the force applied (P value range= 0.2–0.9). Procedure duration and fluoroscopy duration were similar (P = 0.97, P = 0.91, respectively). CONCLUSION : Thermal protection of the oesophagus significantly reduces ablation-related thermal injury compared with standard care. This method of oesophageal protection is safe and does not compromise the efficacy or efficiency of the ablation procedure.","Leung, Lisa W M; Bajpai, Abhay; Zuberi, Zia; Li, Anthony; Norman, Mark; Kaba, Riyaz A; Akhtar, Zaki; Evranos, Banu; Gonna, Hanney; Harding, Idris; Sohal, Manav; Al-Subaie, Nawaf; Louis-Auguste, John; Hayat, Jamal; Gallagher, Mark M",Europace,233,3

Trade-offs between the threshold and the earliest times of removing lockdown restrictions are illustrated. Additionally, we consider alternative policy decisions where the population is released gradually from lockdown restrictions and illustrate the trade-offs between the rate of release of population and number of active infections.","Zhang, Y.; Hota, M.; Kapoor, S.",,233,9

Currently the reference diagnostic technique for virus determination is Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) real time analysis that requires specialized equipment, reagents and facilities and typically 3–4 h to perform. Thus, the realization of simple, low-cost, small-size, rapid and point-of-care diagnostics tests has become a global priority. In response to the current need for quick, highly sensitive and on-site detection of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in several aqueous solutions, a specific molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) receptor has been designed, realized, and combined with an optical sensor. More specifically, the proof of concept of a SARS-CoV-2 sensor has been demonstrated by exploiting a plasmonic plastic optical fiber sensor coupled with a novel kind of synthetic MIP nano-layer, especially designed for the specific recognition of Subunit 1 of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. First, we have tested the effectiveness of the developed MIP receptor to bind the Subunit 1 of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, then the results of preliminary tests on SARS-CoV-2 virions, performed on samples of nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs in universal transport medium (UTM) and physiological solution (0.9% NaCl), were compared with those obtained with RT-PCR. According to these preliminary results, the sensitivity of the proposed optical-chemical sensor proved to be higher than the RT-PCR one. Furthermore, a relatively fast response time (about 10 min) to the virus was obtained without the use of additional reagents.","Cennamo, Nunzio; D’Agostino, Girolamo; Perri, Chiara; Arcadio, Francesco; Chiaretti, Guido; Parisio, Eva Maria; Camarlinghi, Giulio; Vettori, Chiara; Di Marzo, Francesco; Cennamo, Rosario; Porto, Giovanni; Zeni, Luigi",Sensors (Basel),233,20

Methods A retrospective survey was performed comparing procedure volumes within March 2019 (pre-COVID-19) with April 2020 (during first wave of COVID-19 pandemic). Sixty-three (63) health care facilities within Oceania that perform cardiac diagnostic procedures were surveyed, including a mixture of metropolitan and regional, hospital and outpatient, public and private sites, and 846 facilities outside of Oceania. The percentage change in procedure volume was measured between March 2019 and April 2020, compared by test type and by facility. Results In Oceania, the total cardiac diagnostic procedure volume was reduced by 52.2% from March 2019 to April 2020, compared to a reduction of 75.9% seen in the rest of the world (p<0.001). Within Oceania sites, this reduction varied significantly between procedure types, but not between types of health care facility. All procedure types (other than stress cardiac magnetic resonance [CMR] and positron emission tomography [PET]) saw significant reductions in volume over this time period (p<0.001). In Oceania, transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) decreased by 51.6%, transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE) by 74.0%, and stress tests by 65% overall, which was more pronounced for stress electrocardiograph (ECG) (81.8%) and stress echocardiography (76.7%) compared to stress single-photon emission computerised tomography (SPECT) (44.3%). Invasive coronary angiography decreased by 36.7% in Oceania. Conclusion A significant reduction in cardiac diagnostic procedure volume was seen across all facility types in Oceania and was likely a function of recommendations from cardiac societies and directives from government to minimise spread of COVID-19 amongst patients and staff. Longer term evaluation is important to assess for negative patient outcomes which may relate to deferral of usual models of care within cardiology.","O’Sullivan, Patricia; Younger, John; Van Pelt, Niels; O’Malley, Sue; Lenturut-Katal, Dora; Hirschfeld, Cole B.; Vitola, Joao V.; Cerci, Rodrigo; Williams, Michelle C.; Shaw, Leslee J.; Raggi, Paolo; Villines, Todd C.; Dorbala, Sharmila; Choi, Andrew D.; Cohen, Yosef; Goebel, Benjamin; Malkovskiy, Eli; Randazzo, Michael; Pascual, Thomas N.B.; Pynda, Yaroslav; Dondi, Maurizio; Paez, Diana; Einstein, Andrew J.; Better, Nathan",Heart Lung Circ,233,12

Preventive measures were implemented by governments including the closure of universities. The aim of this study was to evaluate the student’s perspectives and experiences on the shift to remote preclinical medical education while enquiring whether there has been any psychological impact on the students. A customized questionnaire utilizing Likert‐scale based questions and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder‐7 assessment tool was distributed online to enrolled preclinical medical students at the Faculty of Medicine and Surgery at the University of Malta. Quantitative and qualitative analyses of the data gathered was carried out. Multivariant logistic regression analyses was performed to establish independent variables associated with anxiety symptoms. A total of 172 responded out of a cohort of 299 preclinical students (58%). The majority perceived a positive learning experience following the shift to remote lectures however it was not the case for small group teaching including dissection sessions. Nonetheless students reported concerns about their education, examinations, progression to next academic year and wellbeing. Less than half the students exhibited symptoms of anxiety.

The anxiety among respondents was detected and measured using a Generalised Anxiety Disorder Scale which consists of 7 questions (in English), i.e. GAD-7. Findings: Respondees were 398, and from these participants, the prevalence of anxiety was 25.4 per cent. Based on the bivariate logistic regression analysis, the predictors of anxiety were gender, religion, occupation as business/self- employed, marital status, family size, health status and sleep deprivation. Conclusion: This study reports the prevalence of anxiety among Indian population who were grounded at their homes during lockdown due to coronavirus pandemic in the country. Limitations: (1) The selection of participants through non-random sampling. (2) Because of the cross-sectional character of the study, causal conclusions cannot be drawn. Originality/Value: This paper fulfils an identified need to study the mental health status of the population under situations like lockdown, thereby helping fill a persistent gap in Indian research on this issue.

This is the first study from a Croatian tertiary care hospital describing epidemiology, risk factors and species distribution in patients with candidemia. A three-year retrospective observational study, from 2018 to 2020, was performed at the University Hospital Centre Zagreb, Zagreb, Croatia. A total of 160 patients with candidemia (n = 170 isolates) were enrolled. Candidemia incidence increased from 0.47 to 0.69 per 1000 admissions in 2018 and 2020, respectively. Ninety-five patients (58.38%) were in the intensive care unit. The main risk factors for candidemia were central venous catheter (CVC) (84.38%), previous surgical procedure (56.88%) and invasive mechanical ventilation (42.50%). Candida albicans was identified in 43.53% of isolates, followed by C. parapsilosis (31.76%) and C. glabrata (12.36%), C. krusei (5.29%), C. tropicalis (2.35%) and C. lusitaniae (2.35%). The study discovered a shift to non-albicans Candida species, particularly C. parapsilosis, and made it possible to determine the main tasks we should focus on to prevent candidemia in the hospital, these being mainly infection control measures directed towards prevention of catheter-related bloodstream infections, specifically comprising hand hygiene and CVC bundles of care. The potential benefit of fluconazole prophylaxis in certain populations of surgical patients could also be considered.","Mareković, Ivana; Pleško, Sanja; Rezo Vranješ, Violeta; Herljević, Zoran; Kuliš, Tomislav; Jandrlić, Marija",J Fungi (Basel),233,8

The high percentage of asymptomatic COVID-19 patients is significant in settings with specific vulnerabilities, such as homeless shelters, where the consequences of an outbreak may be dramatic. In this work, we briefly report our experience on residents and staff of homeless shelters in the City of Rome, Italy, with a particular focus on asymptomatic transmission, and compare it with the available evidence. METHODS: We performed routine Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nasopharyngeal swab tests in all residents and staff of homeless shelters managed by the Eleemosynaria Apostolica of the Vatican City State in the city of Rome, Italy, in addition to daily symptom screening, body temperature monitoring, and application of other prevention measures. RESULTS: We evaluated 298 persons and identified twelve positive cases (4%). Most of the positive cases (75%) were asymptomatic, while only three patients reported symptoms that included fever, diarrhea, and cough. CONCLUSIONS: Our data confirm the importance of early identification of asymptomatic carriers that could, in vulnerable conditions such as homeless shelters, spread the infection and cause outbreaks with severe consequences on individual and public health.","Ralli, Massimo; Morrone, Aldo; Arcangeli, Andrea; Ercoli, Lucia",Int J Infect Dis,233,16

This study will also provide an important opportunity to investigate the safety and tolerability of favipiravir, the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of this drug and mechanisms of resistance in the context of COVID-19 infection, as well as the effect of favipiravir on hospitalisation duration and the post COVID-19 health and psycho-social wellbeing of patients recruited to the study. TRIAL DESIGN: GETAFIX is an open label, parallel group, two arm phase II/III randomised trial with 1:1 treatment allocation ratio. Patients will be randomised to one of two arms and the primary endpoint will assess the superiority of favipiravir plus standard treatment compared to standard treatment alone. PARTICIPANTS: This trial will recruit adult patients with confirmed positive valid COVID-19 test, who are not pregnant or breastfeeding and have no prior major co-morbidities. This is a multi-centre trial, patients will be recruited from in-patients and outpatients from three Glasgow hospitals: Royal Alexandra Hospital; Queen Elizabeth University Hospital; and the Glasgow Royal Infirmary. Patients must meet all of the following criteria: 1. Age 16 or over at time of consent 2. Exhibiting symptoms associated with COVID-19 3. Positive for SARS-CoV-2 on valid COVID-19 test 4.

History of hereditary xanthinuria 5. Other patients judged unsuitable by the Principal Investigator or sub-Investigator 6. Known hypersensitivity to favipiravir, its metabolites or any excipients 7. Severe co-morbidities including: patients with severe hepatic impairment, defined as: • greater than Child-Pugh grade A • AST or ALT > 5 x ULN • AST or ALT >3 x ULN and Total Bilirubin > 2xULN 8. More than 96 hours since first positive COVID-19 test sample was taken 9. Unable to discontinue contra-indicated concomitant medications This is a multi-centre trial, patients will be recruited from in-patients and outpatients from three Glasgow hospitals: Royal Alexandra Hospital; Queen Elizabeth University Hospital; and the Glasgow Royal Infirmary. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Patients randomised to the experimental arm of GETAFIX will receive standard treatment for COVID-19 at the discretion of the treating clinician plus favipiravir. These patients will receive a loading dose of favipiravir on day 1 of 3600mg (1800mg 12 hours apart). On days 2-10, patients in the experimental arm will receive a maintenance dose of favipiravir of 800mg 12 hours apart (total of 18 doses). Patients randomised to the control arm of the GETAFIX trial will receive standard treatment for COVID-19 at the discretion of the treating clinician. MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary outcome being assessed in the GETAFIX trial is the efficacy of favipiravir in addition to standard treatment in patients with COVID-19 in reducing the severity of disease compared to standard treatment alone. Disease severity will be assessed using WHO COVID 10 point ordinal severity scale at day 15 +/- 48 hours. All randomised participants will be followed up until death or 60 days post-randomisation (whichever is sooner). RANDOMISATION: Patients will be randomised 1:1 to the experimental versus control arm using computer generated random sequence allocation. A minimisation algorithm incorporating a random component will be used to allocate patients. The factors used in the minimisation will be: site, age (16-50/51-70/71+), history of hypertension or currently obsess (BMI>30 or obesity clinically evident; yes/no), 7 days duration of symptoms (yes/no/unknown), sex (male/female), WHO COVID-19 ordinal severity score at baseline (1/2or 3/4). BLINDING (MASKING): No blinding will be used in the GETAFIX trial. Both participants and those assessing outcomes will be aware of treatment allocation. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): In total, 302 patients will be randomised to the GETAFIX trial: 151 to the control arm and 151 to the experimental arm. There will be an optional consent form for patients who may want to contribute to more frequent PK and PD sampling. The maximum number of patients who will undergo this testing will be sixteen, eight males and eight females. This option will be offered to all patients who are being treated in hospital at the time of taking informed consent, however only patients in the experimental arm of the trial will be able to undergo this testing. TRIAL STATUS: The current GETAFIX protocol is version 4.0 12(th) September 2020. GETAFIX opened to recruitment on 26(th) October 2020 and will recruit patients over a period of approximately six months.

However, the precise working mechanism of RDV when targeting the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) has not been fully elucidated. Here we solve a 3.0-angström structure of SARS-CoV-2 RdRP elongation complex (EC) and assess RDV intervention in polymerase elongation phase. While RDV could induce an “i+3” delayed termination in meta-stable complexes, only pausing and subsequent elongation are observed in the EC. A comparative investigation using an enterovirus RdRP further confirm similar delayed intervention and demonstrate that steric hindrance of the RDV-characteristic 1′-cyano at the -4 position is responsible for the “i+3” intervention, while two representative Flaviviridae RdRPs do not exhibit similar behavior. A comparison of representative viral RdRP catalytic complex structures indicates that the product RNA backbone encounters highly conserved structural elements, highlighting the broad-spectrum intervention potential of 1′-modified nucleotide analogs in anti-RNA virus drug development.","Wu, Jiqin; Wang, Haofeng; Liu, Qiaojie; Li, Rui; Gao, Yan; Fang, Xiang; Zhong, Yao; Wang, Meihua; Wang, Quan; Rao, Zihe; Gong, Peng",Cell Rep,233,20

We investigated the coagulation pattern of patients with COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), comparing patients who survived to those who did not. Methods: In this prospective cohort study on 20 COVID-19 ARDS patients, the following biomarkers were measured: thrombin generation (prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 (PF 1 + 2)), fibrinolysis activation (tissue plasminogen activator (tPA)) and inhibition (plasminogen activator inhibitor 2 (PAI-2)), fibrin synthesis (fibrinopeptide A) and fibrinolysis magnitude (plasmin–antiplasmin complex (PAP) and D-dimers). Measurements were done upon intensive care unit (ICU) admission and after 10–14 days. Results: There was increased thrombin generation; modest or null release of t-PA; and increased levels of PAI-2, fibrinopeptide A, PAP and D-dimers. At baseline, nonsurvivors had a significantly (p = 0.014) higher PAI-2/PAP ratio than survivors (109, interquartile range (IQR) 18.1–216, vs. 8.7, IQR 2.9–12.6). At follow-up, thrombin generation was significantly (p = 0.025) reduced in survivors (PF 1 + 2 from 396 pg/mL, IQR 185–585 to 237 pg/mL, IQR 120–393), whereas it increased in nonsurvivors. Fibrinolysis inhibition at follow-up remained stable in survivors and increased in nonsurvivors, leading to a significant (p = 0.026) difference in PAI-2 levels (161 pg/mL, IQR 50–334, vs. 1088 pg/mL, IQR 177–1565). Conclusion: Severe patterns of COVID-19 ARDS are characterized by a thrombin burst and the consequent coagulation activation. Mechanisms of fibrinolysis regulation appear unbalanced toward fibrinolysis inhibition. This pattern ameliorates in survivors, whereas it worsens in nonsurvivors.","Ranucci, Marco; Sitzia, Clementina; Baryshnikova, Ekaterina; Di Dedda, Umberto; Cardani, Rosanna; Martelli, Fabio; Corsi Romanelli, Massimiliano",J Clin Med,233,28

The aim of the study was to assess the risk of hospitalization for COVID‐19 and death in a cohort of patients with Parkinson's disease or parkinsonism compared with a control population cohort, during the epidemic bout (March–May 2020) in Bologna, northern Italy. METHODS: Participants of the ParkLink study with the clinical diagnosis of Parkinson's disease or parkinsonism and people anonymously matched (ratio 1:10) for sex, age, district, and Charlson Index were included. The hospital admission rate for COVID‐19 (February 26–May 31, 2020) and the death rate for any cause were the outcomes of interest. RESULTS: The ParkLink cohort included 696 subjects with Parkinson's disease and 184 with parkinsonism, and the control cohort had 8590 subjects. The 3‐month hospitalization rate for COVID‐19 was 0.6% in Parkinson's disease, 3.3% in parkinsonism, and 0.7% in controls. The adjusted hazard ratio (age, sex, district, Charlson Index) was 0.8 (95% CI, 0.3–2.3, P = 0.74) in Parkinson's disease and 3.3 (1.4–7.6, P = 0.006) in parkinsonism compared with controls. Twenty‐nine of the infected subjects died; 30‐day fatality rate was 35.1%, without difference among the 3 groups. Six of 10 Parkinson's disease/parkinsonism patients had the infection during hospitalization or in a nursing home. CONCLUSIONS: Parkinson's disease per se probably is not a risk factor for COVID‐19 hospitalization. Conversely, parkinsonism is an independent risk factor probably because of a more severe health status, entailing higher care dependence and placement in high‐infection‐risk accommodations. © 2020 The Authors.

Research on the active site of the molecule has led to development of effective inhibitors like oseltamivir, zanamivir etc, but the high rate of mutation and interspecies reassortment in viral sequences and the recent reports of oseltamivir resistant strains underlines the importance of determining additional target sites for developing future antiviral compounds. In a recent computational study of 173 H5N1 NA gene sequences we had identified a 50-base highly conserved region in 3'-terminal end of the NA gene. RESULTS: We extend the graphical and numerical analyses to a larger number of H5N1 NA sequences (514) and H1N1 swine flu sequences (425) accessed from GenBank. We use a 2D graphical representation model for the gene sequences and a Graphical Sliding Window Method (GSWM) for protein sequences scanning the sequences as a block of 16 amino acids at a time. Using a protein sequence descriptor defined in our model, the protein sliding scan method allowed us to compare the different strains for block level variability, which showed significant statistical correlation to average solvent accessibility of the residue blocks; single amino acid position variability results in no correlation, indicating the impact of stretch variability in chemical environment. Close to the C-terminal end the GSWM showed less descriptor-variability with increased average solvent accessibility (ASA) that is also supported by conserved predicted secondary structure of 3' terminal RNA and visual evidence from 3D crystallographic structure. CONCLUSION: The identified terminal segment, strongly conserved in both RNA and protein sequences, is especially significant as it is surface exposed and structural chemistry reveals the probable role of this stretch in tetrameric stabilization. It could also participate in other biological processes associated with conserved surface residues. A RNA double hairpin secondary structure found in this segment in a majority of the H5N1 strains also supports this observation. In this paper we propose this conserved region as a probable site for designing inhibitors for broad-spectrum pandemic control of flu viruses with similar NA structure.","Ghosh, Ambarnil; Nandy, Ashesh; Nandy, Papiya",BMC Struct Biol,233,16

Some airlines block their airplanes’ middle seats to preserve social distancing among seated passengers. In this context, we present six new boarding methods and compare their performance with that of the two best boarding methods used to date with social distancing. We evaluate the eight boarding methods using three performance metrics related to passenger health and one operational metric (airplane boarding time) for a one-door airplane. The three health metrics reflect the risks of virus spread by passengers through the air and surfaces (e.g. headrests and seat arms) and consider the amount of aisle social distancing between adjacent boarding passengers walking towards their seats. For an airline that highly values the avoidance of window seat risk, the best method to use is one of the new methods: back-to-front by row – WilMA, though it will result in a longer time to complete boarding of the airplane. Airlines placing greater emphasis on fast boarding times— while still providing favorable values for the health metrics—will be best served by using new methods back-to-front by row – WilMA – offset 2 and – offset 3 when aisle social distancing is 1 m and 2 m respectively.","John Milne, R.; Delcea, Camelia; Cotfas, Liviu-Adrian",Saf Sci,233,24

Characterizing return to baseline health among outpatients with milder COVID-19 illness is important for understanding the full spectrum of COVID-19-associated illness and tailoring public health messaging, interventions, and policy. During April 15-June 25, 2020, telephone interviews were conducted with a random sample of adults aged ≥18 years who had a first positive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, at an outpatient visit at one of 14 U.S. academic health care systems in 13 states. Interviews were conducted 14-21 days after the test date. Respondents were asked about demographic characteristics, baseline chronic medical conditions, symptoms present at the time of testing, whether those symptoms had resolved by the interview date, and whether they had returned to their usual state of health at the time of interview. Among 292 respondents, 94% (274) reported experiencing one or more symptoms at the time of testing; 35% of these symptomatic respondents reported not having returned to their usual state of health by the date of the interview (median = 16 days from testing date), including 26% among those aged 18-34 years, 32% among those aged 35-49 years, and 47% among those aged ≥50 years. Among respondents reporting cough, fatigue, or shortness of breath at the time of testing, 43%, 35%, and 29%, respectively, continued to experience these symptoms at the time of the interview. These findings indicate that COVID-19 can result in prolonged illness even among persons with milder outpatient illness, including young adults. Effective public health messaging targeting these groups is warranted. Preventative measures, including social distancing, frequent handwashing, and the consistent and correct use of face coverings in public, should be strongly encouraged to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2.","Tenforde, Mark W.; Kim, Sara S.; Lindsell, Christopher J.; Billig Rose, Erica; Shapiro, Nathan I.; Files, D.

Telehealth presents a safe platform for conducting health-related interventions that may have additional benefits such as widespread reach. Our pilot study sought to examine how a telehealth intervention changed activity profiles in older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: There were n = 13 adults aged 70.6 ± 4.5 years that participated in a 6 week telehealth intervention during the COVID-19 pandemic. The didactic intervention contents were shared online, and participants worked with trained interviewers over the telephone to discuss physical activity. At baseline and post-intervention, the Multimedia Activity Recall for Children and Adults examined activity profiles, while accelerometry estimated time spent sedentary and in physical activity. Results: Relative to the baseline measures, there was an 88 min/day (95% confidence interval (CI): 39, 137) increase in computer time and 36 min/day (CI: 10, 62) reduction in time spent in active transport at post-intervention. Moderate-to-vigorous physical activity participation also increased by an estimated 2 min/day (CI: −21, 26) and 12 min/week (CI: −154, 180), but this trend was not statistically significant.

Responses to this pressure are hindered in part by reliance on a limited supply of highly trained health care professionals, creating a need for scalable technological solutions. Digital symptom checkers are artificial intelligence–supported software tools that use a conversational “chatbot” format to support rapid diagnosis and consistent triage. The COVID-19 pandemic has brought new attention to these tools due to the need to avoid face-to-face contact and preserve urgent care capacity. However, evidence-based deployment of these chatbots requires an understanding of user demographics and associated triage recommendations generated by a large general population. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we evaluate the user demographics and levels of triage acuity provided by a symptom checker chatbot deployed in partnership with a large integrated health system in the United States. METHODS: This population-based descriptive study included all web-based symptom assessments completed on the website and patient portal of the Sutter Health system (24 hospitals in Northern California) from April 24, 2019, to February 1, 2020. User demographics were compared to relevant US Census population data. RESULTS: A total of 26,646 symptom assessments were completed during the study period. Most assessments (17,816/26,646, 66.9%) were completed by female users. The mean user age was 34.3 years (SD 14.4 years), compared to a median age of 37.3 years of the general population. The most common initial symptom was abdominal pain (2060/26,646, 7.7%). A substantial number of assessments (12,357/26,646, 46.4%) were completed outside of typical physician office hours. Most users were advised to seek medical care on the same day (7299/26,646, 27.4%) or within 2-3 days (6301/26,646, 23.6%). Over a quarter of the assessments indicated a high degree of urgency (7723/26,646, 29.0%). CONCLUSIONS: Users of the symptom checker chatbot were broadly representative of our patient population, although they skewed toward younger and female users. The triage recommendations were comparable to those of nurse-staffed telephone triage lines. Although the emergence of COVID-19 has increased the interest in remote medical assessment tools, it is important to take an evidence-based approach to their deployment.","Morse, Keith E; Ostberg, Nicolai P; Jones, Veena G; Chan, Albert S",J Med Internet Res,233,5

The model features heterogeneous life-cycle households, labor market search and matching frictions, and multiple industries of employment. We calibrate the model to data from New Zealand, where the health effects of the pandemic were especially mild. In this context, we model lockdowns as supply shocks, ignoring the demand shocks associated with health concerns about the virus. We then study the impact of a large-scale wage subsidy scheme implemented during the lockdown. The policy prevents job losses equivalent to 6.5% of steady state employment. Moreover, we find significant heterogeneity in its impact. The subsidy saves 17.2% of jobs for workers under the age of 30, but just 2.6% of jobs for those over 50. Nevertheless, our welfare analysis of fiscal alternatives shows that the young prefer increases in unemployment transfers as this enables greater consumption smoothing across employment states.","Graham, James; Ozbilgin, Murat",J Econ Dyn Control,233,8

As of now, no registered therapies are available for treatment of coronavirus infection. The viral infection depends on the attachment of spike (S) glycoprotein to human cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). We have designed a protein inhibitor (ΔABP-D25Y) targeting S protein using computational approach. The inhibitor consists of two α helical peptides homologues to protease domain (PD) of ACE2. Docking studies and molecular dynamic simulation revealed that the inhibitor binds exclusively at the ACE2 binding site of S protein. The computed binding affinity of the inhibitor is higher than the ACE2 and thus will likely out compete ACE2 for binding to S protein. Hence, the proposed inhibitor ΔABP-D25Y could be a potential blocker of S protein and receptor binding domain (RBD) attachment.","Jaiswal, Grijesh; Kumar, Veerendra",PLoS One,233,9

While VTE is a known complication of ECMO therapy, the rates of increased incidence of VTE in patients with severe COVID-19 make the detection of such complications even more important to reduce overall morbidity and mortality.","Garg, Akash; Goli, Himan; Yazdanpanah, Fariba",J Med Cases,233,1

Its dispersion depends on several factors: viscoelasticity of fluid, ventilation, evaporation rate, exhalations, sneeze or cough. At moment, the preventive distance to avoid the contamination has been established in 1-2 m. We believe that it is necessary to review this aspect, because the respiratory flows change with the intensity of physical activity.The ventilatory response can be evaluated in terms of ventilatory demand or ventilatory efficiency. During maximal effort tests, athletes mobilize an extraordinary amount of air arriving to 150/200 L/min. The respiratory volume follows increase in linear progression during the test in function of power developed. When the air volume is increased 10 times, we think that the distance should be around 6-7 m.","Córdova, Alfredo; Latasa, Iban",,233,27

Previous studies described significant variations in acute asthma management in children. This study was conducted to examine whether asthma management in the pediatric emergency department (ED) was improved through the use of an evidence-based acute asthma care guideline reminder card. METHODS: The Pediatric Acute Asthma Management Guideline (PAMG) was introduced to the ED of a pediatric tertiary care hospital in Ontario, Canada. Medical charts of 278 retrospective ED visits (January–December 2002) and 154 prospective visits (July 2003–June 2004) were reviewed to assess changes in acute asthma management such as medication treatment, asthma education, and discharge planning. Logistic and linear regressions were used to determine the effect of PAMG on asthma management in the ED. The propensity score method was used to adjust for confounding. RESULTS: During the implementation of PAMG, patients who visited the ED were more likely to receive oral corticosteroids (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR] = 2.26, 95% CI: 1.63–3.14, p < 0.0001) and oxygen saturation reassessment before ED discharge (AOR = 2.02, 95% CI: 1.45–2.82, p < 0.0001). They also received 0.23 (95% CI: 0.03–0.44, p = 0.0283) more doses of bronchodilator in the first hour of ED stay. Improvements in asthma education and discharge planning were noted, but the changes were not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: After the implementation of an evidence-based guideline reminder card, medication treatment for acute asthma in the ED was significantly improved; however, asthma education and discharge planning remained unchanged. Future efforts on promoting guideline-based practice in the ED should focus on these components.","To, Teresa; Wang, Chengning; Dell, Sharon D.; Fleming-Carroll, Bonnie; Parkin, Patricia; Scolnik, Dennis; Ungar, Wendy J.",Respir Med,233,1

During the initial spreading of the virus in China, we demonstrated the ensemble Kalman filter performed well as a short-term predictor of the daily cases reported in Wuhan City. Second, we used an individual-level network-based model to reconstruct the epidemic dynamics in Hubei Province at its early stage and examine the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions on the epidemic spreading with various scenarios. Our simulation results show that without continued control measures, the epidemic in Hubei Province could have become persistent. Only by continuing to decrease the infection rate through 1) protective measures and 2) social distancing can the actual epidemic trajectory that happened in Hubei Province be reconstructed in simulation. Finally, we simulate the COVID-19 transmission with non-Markovian processes and show how these models produce different epidemic trajectories, compared to those obtained with Markov processes. Since recent studies show that COVID-19 epidemiological parameters do not follow exponential distributions leading to Markov processes, future works need to focus on non-Markovian models to better capture the COVID-19 spreading trajectories. In addition, shortening the infectious period via early case identification and isolation can slow the epidemic spreading significantly.","Yang, Qihui; Yi, Chunlin; Vajdi, Aram; Cohnstaedt, Lee W; Wu, Hongyu; Guo, Xiaolong; Scoglio, Caterina M",,233,3

Pregnant women were categorised as ‘at risk’ requiring extra vigilance with behavioural guidelines. Their understanding and ability to adhere to recommendations was unknown. OBJECTIVES: To complete a behavioural analysis of the determinants of recommended social distancing behaviour in pregnant women, according to the ‘capability, opportunity, motivation and behaviour’ (‘COM-B’) model to inform the development of recommendations/materials to support pregnant women in understanding and adhering to behavioural guidelines. DESIGN: Qualitative interview study with pregnant women in the Bristol area (UK). METHODS: Semi-structured telephone/videoconference interviews were conducted following a topic guide informed by the COM-B model, transcribed verbatim and subjected to framework analysis. Infographic materials were iteratively produced with stakeholder consultation, to support pregnant women. RESULTS: Thirty-one women participated (selected for demographic range). Women reported adhering to social distancing recommendations and intended to continue. COM-B analysis identified gaps in understanding around risk, vulnerability, and the extent of required social distancing, as well as facilitators of social distancing behaviour (e.g. social support, motivation to stay safe, home environment/resources). Additional themes around detrimental mental health effects and changes to maternity healthcare from the social distancing measures were identified. Infographic resources (plus midwife report) addressing women’s key concerns were produced and disseminated. CONCLUSIONS: The COM-B model provided useful details of determinants of pregnant women’s adherence to social distancing behaviours. The confusion of what being ‘at risk’ meant and varying interpretation of what was expected indicates a need for greater clarity around categories and guidance. The loss of maternity care and negative mental health effects of social distancing suggest a growing area of unmet health needs to be addressed in future.

The ability of conventional global coagulation tests to accurately reflect in vivo hypo- or hypercoagulability is questioned. The currently available evidence suggests that markedly increased D-dimers can be used in identifying COVID-19 patients who may need intensive care unit (ICU) admission and close monitoring or not. Viscoelastic methods (VMs), like thromboelastography (TEG) and rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM), estimate the dynamics of blood coagulation. The evaluation of coagulopathy by VMs in severe COVID-19 infection seems an increasingly attractive option. Available evidence supports that COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory failure suffer from severe hypercoagulability rather than consumptive coagulopathy often associated with fibrinolysis shutdown. However, the variability in definitions of both the procoagulant profile and the clinical outcome assessment, in parallel with the small sample sizes in most of these studies, do not allow the establishment of a clear association between the hypercoagulable state and thrombotic events. VMs can effectively provide insight into the pathophysiology of coagulopathy, detecting the presence of hypercoagulability in critically ill COVID-19 patients. However, it remains unknown whether the degree of coagulopathy can be used in order to predict the outcome, establish a diagnosis or guide anticoagulant therapy.","Tsantes, Argirios E.; Tsantes, Andreas G.; Kokoris, Styliani I.; Bonovas, Stefanos; Frantzeskaki, Frantzeska; Tsangaris, Iraklis; Kopterides, Petros",Diagnostics (Basel),233,1

Two objections to this argument are considered and shown to be unsound.

To that end, the different transmission routes and their role in determining the evolution of the Covid-19 pandemic are analyzed in this work. The probability of infection caused by inhaling virus-laden droplets (initial ejection diameters between 0.5 µm and 750 µm, therefore including both airborne and ballistic droplets) and the corresponding desiccated nuclei that mostly encapsulate the virions post droplet evaporation are individually calculated. At typical, air-conditioned yet quiescent indoor space, for average viral loading, cough droplets of initial diameter between 10 µm and 50 µm are found to have the highest infection probability. However, by the time they are inhaled, the diameters reduce to about 1/6th of their initial diameters. While the initially near unity infection probability due to droplets rapidly decays within the first 25 s, the small yet persistent infection probability of desiccated nuclei decays appreciably only by [Formula: see text] , assuming that the virus sustains equally well within the dried droplet nuclei as in the droplets. Combined with molecular collision theory adapted to calculate the frequency of contact between the susceptible population and the droplet/nuclei cloud, infection rate constants are derived ab initio, leading to a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered-deceased model applicable for any respiratory event–vector combination. The viral load, minimum infectious dose, sensitivity of the virus half-life to the phase of its vector, and dilution of the respiratory jet/puff by the entraining air are shown to mechanistically determine specific physical modes of transmission and variation in the basic reproduction number [Formula: see text] from first-principles calculations.","Chaudhuri, Swetaprovo; Basu, Saptarshi; Saha, Abhishek",Phys Fluids (1994),233,16

This analysis characterizes COVID‐19 clusters among vulnerable populations housed in congregate living settings across an entire community and describes early mitigation efforts. METHODS: The Cuyahoga County Board of Health identified and interviewed COVID‐19 cases and exposed contacts, assessing possible connections to congregate living facilities within its jurisdiction from March 7, 2020, to May 15, 2020, during the first phase of the pandemic, while state of Ohio stay‐at‐home orders were in effect. A multi‐disciplinary team‐based response network was mobilized to support active case finding and develop facility‐focused containment strategies. RESULTS: We identified a cascade of 45 COVID‐19 clusters across community facilities (corrections, nursing, assisted living, intermediate care, extended treatment, shelters, group homes). Attack rates were highest within small facilities (P < .01) and large facilities requiring extensive support to implement effective containment measures.

Recent clinical guidelines have supported the use of corticosteroids and remdesivir in the treatment of COVID-19. However, uncertainty remains about which patients are most likely to benefit from treatment with either drug; such knowledge is crucial for avoiding preventable side effects, minimizing costs, and effectively allocating resources. This study presents a machine learning system capable of identifying patients for whom treatment with corticosteroids or remdesivir is associated with improved survival time. METHODS: : Gradient boosted decision tree models to predict treatment benefit were trained and tested on data from patients hospitalized at 10 hospitals in the United States between December 18, 2019 and October 18, 2020. 893 patients were treated with remdesivir, and 1,471 were treated with corticosteroids. Models were evaluated for their ability to identify patients that exhibited longer survival times when treated with corticosteroids or remdesivir. Fine and Gray models for the proportional hazard were evaluated comparing treated and untreated patients in the full COVID-19 population, in patients receiving supplemental oxygen, and in patients identified by the algorithm. Inverse probability of treatment weights were used to adjust for confounding. Models for each treatment were trained and tested separately. FINDINGS: : .Adult patients (age ≥ 18) were included in this study, with men comprising slightly more than 50% of the sample. After adjusting for confounding, neither corticosteroids nor remdesivir were associated with increased survival time in the full hospitalized COVID-19 population or in the population receiving supplemental oxygen. However, in the populations identified by the algorithms, both corticosteroids and remdesivir were significantly associated with an increase in survival time, with hazard ratios of 0.56 (p = 0.04) and 0.40 (p = 0.04), respectively IMPLICATIONS: : Machine learning methods are capable of identifying hospitalized COVID-19 patients for whom treatment with corticosteroids or remdesivir is associated with an increase in survival time.

The discovery of this enzyme added a new level of complexity to this system. The mesangial cells (MC) have multiple functions in glomerular physiology and pathophysiology and are able to express all components of the RAS. Despite of being localized in these cells, ACE2 has not yet been purified or characterized. In this study ACE2 from mice immortalized MC (IMC) was purified by ion-exchange chromatography. The purified enzyme was identified as a single band around 60–70 kDa on SDS-polyacrylamide gel and by Western blotting using a specific antibody. The optima pH and chloride concentrations were 7.5 and 200 mM, respectively. The N-terminal sequence was homologous with many species ACE2 N-terminal sequences as described in the literature. ACE2 purified from IMC was able to hydrolyze Ang II into Ang 1–7 and the K(m) value for Ang II was determined to be 2.87 ± 0.76 μM.

Ang 1–7 production associated to Ang II degradation by ACE2 may exert a protective effect in the renal hemodynamic.","Aragão, Danielle S.; Cunha, Tatiana S.; Arita, Danielle Yuri; Andrade, Maria Claudina C.; Fernandes, Adriana B.; Watanabe, Ingrid K.M.; Mortara, Renato A.; Casarini, Dulce Elena",Int J Biol Macromol,233,16

This international survey among ophthalmologists was initiated to capture what actions ophthalmologists were taking and what their opinions were on the risks of infection in their workplace, the delay in treatment, the use of telemedicine and telephone for appointments, and the regional specifications and measures implemented by the respective authorities. METHODS: An open-source web tool was used to develop an online survey, to which ophthalmologists worldwide were invited via e-mail using international mailing lists (Media Mice, Singapore; Texere Publishing Inc, USA; CGO Gerling) and incentivized using a lottery. The physicians provided their level of agreement relating to the offered statements and gave free answers to the questions regarding the actions taken (conducted November 5th 2020 to December 20th 2020). RESULTS: After 91,000 invitations, responses were collected from 1122 ophthalmologists. Despite the use of large international mailing lists, mainly doctors from Europe participated. Half of the participants expressed great concern about possible SARS-CoV-2 infection in their patients. A significant number of younger ophthalmologists (≤50 years: 76.9%, n = 313; >50 years: 69.6%, n = 181) feared the delays that COVID-19 could cause to treatment. Reductions in patient numbers were broadly observed, with more ophthalmologists of younger age reporting greater declines. Nearly all ophthalmologists indicated that they provided disinfectant and the majority also used masks and questionnaires for screening. For 60.3% (n = 412) of ophthalmologists, telephone calls reduced the risk of ‘no-shows’; 71.6% (n = 497) disagreed that telemedical evaluation is possible without slit lamp findings and fundus photos; and 57.0% of participants felt content with the governmental measures during the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly influenced the work of ophthalmologists. Based on the limited response rate, certain statements were only possible to evaluate for the European Union: with a noticeable reduction in patient numbers, delay in treatment was a major worry. Measures to protect and reassure patients should be undertaken, especially regarding those with vision-threatening diseases requiring treatment.","Kortuem, Friederike C; Ziemssen, Focke; Kortuem, Karsten U; Kortuem, Constanze",Clin Ophthalmol,233,24

The aim of this study was to identify the perceived barriers to veterinary infection control and HeV management in private veterinary practice in Queensland, where the majority of HeV outbreaks have occurred in Australia. RESULTS: Most participants agreed that a number of key factors had contributed to the slow uptake of adequate infection control measures for the management of HeV amongst private veterinarians: a work culture characterised by suboptimal infection control standards and misconceptions about zoonotic risks; a lack of leadership and support from government authorities; the difficulties of managing biosecurity and public health issues from a private workforce perspective; and the slow pattern of emergence of HeV. By 2010, some infection control and HeV management changes had been implemented. Participants interviewed agreed that further improvements remained necessary; but also cautioned that this was a complex process which would require time. CONCLUSION: Private veterinarians and government authorities prior to 2009 were unprepared to handle new slowly emerging zoonoses, which may explain their mismanagement of HeV. Slowly emerging zoonoses may be of low public health significance but of high significance for specialised groups such as veterinarians. Private veterinarians, who are expected to fulfil an active biosecurity and public health role in the frontline management of such emerging zoonoses, need government agencies to better recognise their contribution, to consult with the veterinary profession when devising guidelines for the management of zoonoses and to provide them with greater leadership and support. We propose that specific infection control guidelines for the management of slowly emerging zoonoses in private veterinary settings need to be developed.","Mendez, Diana H; Kelly, Jenny; Buttner, Petra; Nowak, Madeleine; Speare, Rick",BMC Vet Res,233,24

Materials and Methods This cross-sectional survey-based study comprised 1,000 adults residing in Pakistan. A questionnaire was formulated and circulated among adult population of Pakistan, the depression and anxiety symptoms using Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) scales were assessed. Statistical Analysis Independent t -test, cross tabulation, and regression analysis were used to identify variables having impact on PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scores. A p -value of ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results Among 1,000 participants, 573 were males and 427 were females who completed the survey. Majority were restricted to home for more than 40 days. Considerable number of participants reported depressive (540, 54%) and anxiety (480, 48%) symptoms. Gender, age, earnings, and occupation have significant relation with psychological distress, although similar was not found with education levels. Conclusion Psychological distress, a concerning yet addressable issue was found among adults arising amid COVID-19 outbreak. Currently, physical health effects of COVID-19 are being looked, while mental health effects being under-addressed. This issue should be addressed to avoid any psychological impact in future.","Lal, Abhishek; Sanaullah, Anas; M.

While respiratory viruses alone may cause viral AOM, they increase the risk of bacterial middle ear infection and worsen clinical outcomes of bacterial AOM. URI viruses alter Eustachian tube (ET) function via decreased mucociliary action, altered mucus secretion and increased expression of inflammatory mediators among other mechanisms. Transient reduction in protective functions of the ET allows colonizing bacteria of the nasopharynx to ascend into the middle ear and cause AOM. Advances in research help us to better understand the host responses to viral URI, the mechanisms of viral–bacterial interactions in the nasopharynx and the development of AOM. In this review, we present current knowledge regarding viral–bacterial interactions in the pathogenesis and clinical course of AOM.

SETTING: Outpatient neuropsychology concussion clinic. PARTICIPANTS: Fifteen patients (aged 15.40 ± 1.35 years; 33% female) with a concussion and their accompanying caregivers (n = 15; 87% female) were randomly assigned to an in-person clinic visit and 15 patients (aged 15.13 ± 1.25 years; 40% female) with a concussion and their accompanying caregivers (n = 15; 73% female) were randomly assigned to a telehealth clinic visit. DESIGN: A prospective, randomized design. MAIN MEASURES: Therapeutic alliance and patient satisfaction scores. RESULTS: Therapeutic alliance scores were not significantly different for patients in the in-person or telehealth setting, and caregiver therapeutic alliance scores were significantly higher for the in-person condition than for the telehealth condition. There were no significant differences between in-person and telehealth session satisfaction scores for patients on depth, smoothness, positivity, arousal, and bad-good outcomes. Patient and caregiver satisfaction with the clinical setting was high (ie, General Endorsement). CONCLUSION: Telehealth is feasible for assessing and interpreting clinical concussion examination, interview, and neurocognitive findings, which are perceived by patients and their caregivers to be comparable with in-person care. Positive satisfaction scores also serve to reinforce the need for healthcare providers to seek ways to actively engage with patients and their caregivers through elements of communicative skills such as active listening, building patient rapport, encouraging patient autonomy, and providing an adequate amount of time for interaction and questions. Telehealth for concussion care is increasing in implementation across health systems, and demand is likely to grow in light of the current COVID-19 pandemic and advances in telehealth delivery.","Elbin, R J; Stephenson, Katie; Lipinski, Damon; Maxey, Kristin; Womble, Melissa N; Reynolds, Erin; Covert, Kayla; Kontos, Anthony P",J. head trauma rahabil,233,16

This article explores the factors associated with an increase in domestic violence incidents during COVID-19 by applying routine activity theory (RAT) framework. Data were drawn from the incidents of domestic violence reported in newspapers. Data was analyzed using content analysis and three major themes, i.e., three principle components of RAT—motivated offender, suitable target, and absence of capable guardian—were drawn. Findings reveal that sources of motivation in domestic violence perpetrators during the lockdown were alcohol and unemployment. The symbolic value that perpetrators associated with women, lower inertia, visibility, and accessibility to the perpetrators made women suitable targets of domestic violence. Lastly, shortage of police force and travel restrictions on formal and informal sources resulted in the absence of capable guardians. We conclude that changes in the routine activities of people during the COVID-19 lockdown provided more opportunities to the perpetrators of domestic violence.","Krishnakumar, Akshaya; Verma, Shankey",Asian J Criminol,233,31

The existing IBVs continue to evolve in various geographic areas in Asia, which results in the recombination and co-circulation between IBV types. This makes it increasingly difficult to prevent and control IBV infections, despite routine vaccination. Some ACoVs have also been identified in other avian species and they may pose a threat of cross-transmission to commercial sectors. The present review provides an overview of IBV circulation and the dynamic emergence of new variants found throughout Asia via the recombination of IBV strains. In addition to commercial poultry, backyard poultry and free-ranging birds may serve as a ‘hub’ for ACoV transmission within a particular area. These birds may be capable of spreading viruses, either to areas of close proximity, or to remote places via migration and trade.","Promkuntod, Naruepol",Vet Q,233,10

Multicentre cross sectional observational study of laboratory, public health and hospitalisation data for PCR confirmed COVID-19 cases within the New Zealand Northern Region, between 12 February and 8 June 2020. Of 123,124 samples tested for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR, 579 samples (407 positive and 172 negative) from 368 symptomatic non-hospitalised individuals with PCR-confirmed infection were included. Sample positivity rate was 61.5% (8/13) for pre-symptomatic samples, rising to 93.2% (317/340) for samples collected during the purported symptomatic infectious period (days 0–10 post-symptom onset), and dropping to 36.3% (82/226) for post-infectious period samples (day 11 onwards). URT viral load peaked shortly after symptom onset, with median Ct values ranging 20.00–29.99 until 15 days post-symptom onset, and >30.00 after this time. Of samples with a Ct value of <20.00, 96.1% were collected during the symptomatic infectious period. However, of samples with a Ct value ≥30.00 and ≥35.00, 46.9% and 18.5%, respectively, were also collected during the symptomatic infectious period. At or soon after symptom onset represents the optimum time to test for SARS-CoV-2 in the URT, with median Ct values suggesting the useful testing window extends until around 15 days post-symptom onset. In asymptomatic individuals or those with unknown dates of symptom onset, Ct values <20.00 imply recent onset/potential infectivity, but Ct values ≥30.00 or ≥35.00 do not exclude recent onset/potential infectivity. Individual sample Ct values should not be used as an absolute marker of length of time post-infection or to exclude infectivity where date of symptom onset is unavailable.","Fox-Lewis, Andrew; Fox-Lewis, Shivani; Beaumont, Jenna; Drinković, Dragana; Harrower, Jay; Howe, Kevin; Jackson, Catherine; Rahnama, Fahimeh; Shilton, Blair; Qiao, Helen; Smith, Kevin K.; Morpeth, Susan C.; Taylor, Susan; Blakiston, Matthew; Roberts, Sally; McAuliffe, Gary",Pathology,233,13

With the immediate need for remote care due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many health care systems have rapidly incorporated digital technologies to support the delivery of remote care options, including medication treatment for individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD). In responding to the opioid crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic, public health officials and scientific communities strongly support and advocate for greater use of TM-based medication treatment for opioid use disorder (MOUD) to improve access to care and have suggested that broad use of TM during the pandemic should be sustained. Nevertheless, research on the implementation and effectiveness of TM-based MOUD has been limited. To address this knowledge gap, the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN) funded (via the NIH HEAL Initiative) a study on Rural Expansion of Medication Treatment for Opioid Use Disorder (Rural MOUD; CTN-0102) to investigate the implementation and effectiveness of adding TM-based MOUD to rural primary care for expanding access to MOUD. In preparation for this large-scale, randomized controlled trial incorporating TM in rural primary care, a feasibility study is being conducted to develop and pilot test implementation procedures. In this commentary, we share some of our experiences, which include several challenges, during the initial two-month period of the feasibility study phase. While these challenges could be due, at least in part, to adjusting to the COVID-19 pandemic and new workflows to accommodate the study, they are notable and could have a substantial impact on the larger, planned pragmatic trial and on TM-based MOUD more broadly. Challenges include low rates of identification of risk for OUD from screening, low rates of referral to TM, digital device and internet access issues, workflow and capacity barriers, and insurance coverage. These challenges also highlight the lack of empirical guidance for best TM practice and quality remote care models. With TM expanding rapidly, understanding implementation and demonstrating what TM approaches are effective are critical for ensuring the best care for persons with OUD.","Hser, Yih-Ing; Ober, Allison J.; Dopp, Alex R.; Lin, Chunqing; Osterhage, Katie P.; Clingan, Sarah E.; Mooney, Larissa J.; Curtis, Megan E.; Marsch, Lisa A.; McLeman, Bethany; Hichborn, Emily; Lester, Laurie S.; Baldwin, Laura-Mae; Liu, Yanping; Jacobs, Petra; Saxon, Andrew J.",Addict Sci Clin Pract,233,5

Innovative solutions are not only required but are also vital if effective, timely and equitable access to sustainable health care in rural communities is to be realised. Despite trial implementation of some alternative models of health care delivery, not all have been evaluated and their impacts are not well understood. The aim of this study was to explore the views of staff and stakeholders of a rural health service in relation to the implementation of an after-hours nurse practitioner model of health care delivery in its Urgent Care Centre. METHODS: This qualitative study included semi-structured individual and group interviews with professional stakeholders of a rural health service in Victoria, Australia and included hospital managers and hospital staff who worked directly or indirectly with the after-hours NPs in addition to local GPs, GP practice nurses, and paramedics. Thematic analysis was used to generate key themes from the data. RESULTS: Four themes emerged from the data analysis: transition to change; acceptance of the after-hours nurse practitioner role; workforce sustainability; and rural context. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the nurse practitioner-led model is valued by rural health practitioners and could reduce the burden of excessive after-hour on-call duties for rural GPs while improving access to quality health care for community members. As pressure on rural urgent care centres further intensifies with the presence of the COVID-19 pandemic, serious consideration of the nurse practitioner-led model is recommended as a desirable and effective alternative.","Wilson, Elena; Hanson, Lisa C.; Tori, Kathleen E.; Perrin, Byron M.",BMC Health Serv Res,233,24

While previous functional work has suggested roles for VPS13C and C2CD4A in disease development, none has explored the role of C2CD4B. METHODS: CRISPR/Cas9-induced global C2cd4b-knockout mice and zebrafish larvae with c2cd4a deletion were used to study the role of this gene in glucose homeostasis. C2 calcium dependent domain containing protein (C2CD)4A and C2CD4B constructs tagged with FLAG or green fluorescent protein were generated to investigate subcellular dynamics using confocal or near-field microscopy and to identify interacting partners by mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Systemic inactivation of C2cd4b in mice led to marked, but highly sexually dimorphic changes in body weight and glucose homeostasis. Female C2cd4b mice displayed unchanged body weight compared with control littermates, but abnormal glucose tolerance (AUC, p = 0.01) and defective in vivo, but not in vitro, insulin secretion (p = 0.02). This was associated with a marked decrease in follicle-stimulating hormone levels as compared with wild-type (WT) littermates (p = 0.003). In sharp contrast, male C2cd4b null mice displayed essentially normal glucose tolerance but an increase in body weight (p < 0.001) and fasting blood glucose (p = 0.003) after maintenance on a high-fat and -sucrose diet vs WT littermates. No metabolic disturbances were observed after global inactivation of C2cd4a in mice, or in pancreatic beta cell function at larval stages in C2cd4a null zebrafish. Fasting blood glucose levels were also unaltered in adult C2cd4a-null fish. C2CD4B and C2CD4A were partially localised to the plasma membrane, with the latter under the control of intracellular Ca(2+). Binding partners for both included secretory-granule-localised PTPRN2/phogrin. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our studies suggest that C2cd4b may act centrally in the pituitary to influence sex-dependent circuits that control pancreatic beta cell function and glucose tolerance in rodents. However, the absence of sexual dimorphism in the impact of diabetes risk variants argues for additional roles for C2CD4A or VPS13C in the control of glucose homeostasis in humans.

Handling of biological samples from individuals infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus requires strict biosafety measures. Within the laboratory, non-propagative work with samples containing the virus requires, at minimum, Biosafety Level-2 (BSL-2) techniques and facilities. Therefore, handling of SARS-CoV-2 samples remains a major concern in areas and conditions where biosafety for specimen handling is difficult to maintain, such as in rural laboratories or austere field testing sites. Inactivation through physical or chemical means can reduce the risk of handling live virus and increase testing ability especially in low-resource settings due to easier and faster sample processing. Herein we assess several chemical and physical inactivation techniques employed against SARS-CoV-2 isolates from Cambodia. This data demonstrates that all chemical (AVL, inactivating sample buffer and formaldehyde) and heat-treatment (56 and 98 °C) methods tested completely inactivated viral loads of up to 5 log(10).","Auerswald, Heidi; Yann, Sokhoun; Dul, Sokha; In, Saraden; Dussart, Philippe; Martin, Nicholas J.; Karlsson, Erik A.; Garcia-Rivera, Jose A.",J Gen Virol,233,1

Our research group has established a project investigating the usefulness of an Internet of Things–based system and smartwatch technology for monitoring women during pregnancy to explore variations in stress, physical activity and sleep. The aim of this study was to examine daily patterns of well-being in pregnant women before and during the national stay-at-home restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic in Finland. METHODS: A longitudinal cohort study design was used to monitor pregnant women in their everyday settings. Two cohorts of pregnant women were recruited. In the first wave in January-December 2019, pregnant women with histories of preterm births (gestational weeks 22–36) or late miscarriages (gestational weeks 12–21); and in the second wave between October 2019 and March 2020, pregnant women with histories of full-term births (gestational weeks 37–42) and no pregnancy losses were recruited. The final sample size for this study was 38 pregnant women. The participants continuously used the Samsung Gear Sport smartwatch and their heart rate variability, and physical activity and sleep data were collected. Subjective stress, activity and sleep reports were collected using a smartphone application developed for this study. Data between February 12 to April 8, 2020 were included to cover four-week periods before and during the national stay-at-home restrictions. Hierarchical linear mixed models were exploited to analyze the trends in the outcome variables. RESULTS: The pandemic-related restrictions were associated with changes in heart rate variability: the standard deviation of all normal inter-beat intervals (p = 0.034), low-frequency power (p = 0.040) and the low-frequency/high-frequency ratio (p = 0.013) increased compared with the weeks before the restrictions. Women’s subjectively evaluated stress levels also increased significantly. Physical activity decreased when the restrictions were set and as pregnancy proceeded. The total sleep time also decreased as pregnancy proceeded, but pandemic-related restrictions were not associated with sleep. Daily rhythms changed in that the participants overall started to sleep later and woke up later. CONCLUSIONS: The findings showed that Finnish pregnant women coped well with the pandemic-related restrictions and lockdown environment in terms of stress, physical activity and sleep.","Niela-Vilén, Hannakaisa; Auxier, Jennifer; Ekholm, Eeva; Sarhaddi, Fatemeh; Asgari Mehrabadi, Milad; Mahmoudzadeh, Aysan; Azimi, Iman; Liljeberg, Pasi; Rahmani, Amir M.; Axelin, Anna",PLoS One,233,20

As the epidemic appears to be waning, it is unclear whether transmission is still ongoing, which is exacerbated by discrepancies in reporting. To uncover locations with lingering outbreaks, we investigated travel-associated Zika cases to identify transmission not captured by reporting. We uncovered an unreported outbreak in Cuba during 2017, a year after peak transmission in neighboring islands. By sequencing Zika virus, we show that the establishment of the virus was delayed by a year and that the ensuing outbreak was sparked by long-lived lineages of Zika virus from other Caribbean islands. Our data suggest that, although mosquito control in Cuba may initially have been effective at mitigating Zika virus transmission, such measures need to be maintained to be effective. Our study highlights how Zika virus may still be “silently” spreading and provides a framework for understanding outbreak dynamics.

Without social distancing, the spread of COVID-19 will grow exponentially, but social distancing and people's learning behavior (isolating, staying at home, wearing face masks, washing hands, restricting the size and frequency of group gatherings, etc.) can significantly impede the epidemic spread, flatten the infection curve, and change the final outcome of the COVID-19 outbreak. Our results demonstrate that strict social distancing and people's learning behavior can be effective in slowing the spread rate and significantly reducing the total number of infections, daily infection rate, peak of daily infections, and duration of the epidemic. Under strict social distancing, the rise and fall of infections would be nearly symmetric about the peak of of daily infections, and the epidemic spread would be essentially over within 60 days. Relaxing social distancing and people learning behaviors will significantly increase the total and daily numbers of infections and prolong the course of the outbreak. These results have immediate applications for the implementation of various social-distancing policies and general significance for ongoing outbreaks and similar infectious disease epidemics in the future.","Cheng, Baolian; Wang, Yi-Ming",,233,23

In 2012, a new human disease called Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) emerged in the Middle East. MERS was caused by a virus that was originally called human coronavirus‐Erasmus Medical Center/2012 but was later renamed as Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS‐CoV). MERS‐CoV causes high fever, cough, acute respiratory tract infection, and multiorgan dysfunction that may eventually lead to the death of the infected individuals. The exact origin of MERS‐CoV remains unknown, but the transmission pattern and evidence from virological studies suggest that dromedary camels are the major reservoir host, from which human infections may sporadically occur through the zoonotic transmission. Human to human transmission also occurs in healthcare facilities and communities. Recent studies on Middle Eastern respiratory continue to highlight the need for further understanding the virus‐host interactions that govern disease severity and infection outcome. In this review, we have highlighted the major mechanisms of immune evasion strategies of MERS‐CoV. We have demonstrated that M, 4a, 4b proteins and Plppro of MERS‐CoV inhibit the type I interferon (IFN) and nuclear factor‐κB signaling pathways and therefore facilitate innate immune evasion. In addition, nonstructural protein 4a (NSP4a), NSP4b, and NSP15 inhibit double‐stranded RNA sensors. Therefore, the mentioned proteins limit early induction of IFN and cause rapid apoptosis of macrophages. MERS‐CoV strongly inhibits the activation of T cells with downregulation of antigen presentation. In addition, uncontrolled secretion of interferon ɣ‐induced protein 10 and monocyte chemoattractant protein‐1 can suppress proliferation of human myeloid progenitor cells.","Shokri, Somayeh; Mahmoudvand, Shahab; Taherkhani, Reza; Farshadpour, Fatemeh",J Cell Physiol,233,24

Inadequate access to cultural foods can create cultural stress and affect one’s identity and well-being. In particular, second-generation U.S. American student populations may have a higher risk for cultural stress due to being away from family, academic stress, environmental changes, and diminished financial stability to purchase cultural foods. Thus, an exploratory qualitative methodology was used to elicit information about second-generation U.S. Americans’ food experiences to identify how cultural foods play a role in individual identity and how individual well-being is influenced by the presence or lack of cultural foods. Sixteen semi-structured interviews were conducted with second-generation American students at the University of Nevada, Reno, who self-identified as a cultural or ethnic minority. A standard thematic analysis was conducted. The authors identified that cultural food security influenced the ability to practice foodways, which tied Second-generation American students to their cultural identities. The absence of foodways led to anxiety and depression among students, amplifying the feelings of identity degradation. Second-generation American students discussed that the ability to practice their foodways improved multiple well-being components and led to feelings of happiness, decreased stress, warmth, better digestion, and a sense of belonging, comfort, and safety. College populations continue to grow and become more diverse, and with the increasing Second-generation American students, it is essential to improve the access and availability of cultural foods to improve their overall well-being.

The annual inflation rate of the COVID price index was −0.4% by April 2020, compared to −1.1% of the equivalent CPI.

It also enables the production of vital statistics for local planning of social services. In many low- and lower-middle-income countries, however, civil registration and vital statistics (CRVS) systems do not adequately register significant numbers of births and, especially, deaths. In this study, we aim to estimate the completeness of adult death registration (for age 15 and older) in the Matlab health and demographic surveillance system (HDSS) area in Bangladesh and to identify reasons for (not) registering deaths in the national CRVS system. We conducted a sample survey of 2538 households and recorded 571 adult deaths that had occurred in the 3 years preceding the survey. Only 17% of these deaths were registered in the national CRVS system, with large gender differences in registration rates (male = 26% vs. female = 5%). Respondents who reported that a recent death in the household was registered indicated that the primary reasons for registration were to secure an inheritance and to access social services. The main reasons cited for not registering a death were lack of knowledge about CRVS and not perceiving the benefits of death registration. Information campaigns to raise awareness of death registration, as well as stronger incentives to register deaths, may be needed to improve the completeness of death registration in Bangladesh.

All three viruses were characterized by whole genome sequencing with subsequent phylogenetic analysis and genetic comparison. Phylogenetic analysis of all eight viral genes showed that the viruses clustered in the Eurasian lineage of influenza A viruses. Genetic analysis showed that H4N6 and H4N9 viruses display low pathogenic avian influenza characteristics.

As VBT does not limit spine mobility, it has been propagated that this technique allows a quicker return to physical activity than fusion. However, no data are available to support this statement. Aim of this study was to quantify how much time patients required to resume preoperative activity level and to seek possible associations between return to physical activity and demographic, radiographic and surgical data. METHODS: One year postoperatively, the validated sport activity questionnaire (SAQ) was administered to all skeletally immature patients who underwent VBT at our institution. SAQ data were analyzed and a multivariate analysis was conducted to investigate associations between SAQ and demographic, radiographic and surgical data. RESULTS: Thirty-one patients aged 14.5 years completed the SAQ. Within 3 months from VBT, 97% returned to school, 61% resumed physical education, 97% carried a backpack, 68% run, and 82% rode a bike; 70% bent within a month from VBT. Ninety-four percent of patients returned to their preoperative athletic level. Within 3 months, 63% of responders resumed noncontact, 61% contact and 53% collision sports. No relevant associations were observed between the SAQ and demographic, radiographic and surgical data. In particular, number of instrumented vertebrae, level of the lowest instrumented vertebra and postoperative Cobb angle did not influence patients’ return to preoperative activities. CONCLUSION: VBT allows patients to quickly return to their preoperative activity level, irrespectively of the postoperative Cobb angle or type of instrumentation.","Baroncini, Alice; Trobisch, Per David; Berrer, Angelika; Kobbe, Philipp; Tingart, Markus; Eschweiler, Jörg; Da Paz, Stephanie; Migliorini, Filippo",Eur Spine J,233,1

In this study, we evaluated the expression stability of ten most commonly used reference genes (GAPDH, ACTB, HSP90, HMBS, 18S rRNA, B2M, POLR2A, HPRT1, ACAC, YWHAZ) in fourteen different Peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV) infected tissues of goats and sheep. RefFinder and RankAggreg software were used to deduce comprehensive ranking of reference genes. Our results suggested HMBS and B2M in goats and HMBS and HPRT1 in sheep can be used as suitable endogenous controls in gene expression studies of PPRV infection irrespective of tissues and condition as a whole, thus eliminating the use of tissue specific/ condition specific endogenous controls. We report for the first time suitable reference genes for gene expression studies in PPRV infected tissues.

This study aimed to determine the postoperative respiratory outcomes of patients with COVID‐19 who underwent cardiac surgery. METHODS: In this retrospective study, we reviewed and analyzed the patient characteristics and clinical data of 25 asymptomatic patients with COVID‐19 who underwent urgent or emergency cardiac surgery at Tehran Heart Center Hospital, Iran, between 29 February and 10 April 2020. RESULTS: The mean age, EuroSCORE, and body mass index were 57.3 ± 15.1 years, 6.65 ± 1.29, and 25.7 ± 3.7 kg/m(2), respectively. Four patients underwent off‐pump cardiac surgery and 21 underwent on‐pump cardiac surgery with a median cardiopulmonary bypass time of 85 minutes (interquartile range (IQR, 50‐147). The overall mortality rate and the length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) were higher compared to those of a propensity‐matched group of patients who underwent cardiac surgery in the pre‐COVID era. The median intubation time was 13 hours (IQR, 9.5‐18), which was comparable to that of pre‐COVID cardiac surgery patients. The readmission rate to the ICU was 16%. In this ICU readmitted group, the mean oxygen index, FiO(2), and mortality rate were higher and the PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio was lower than those of the nonreadmitted patients. CONCLUSIONS: Although early respiratory outcomes of asymptomatic COVID‐19 patients who underwent early cardiac surgery appeared to be satisfactory, compared to the propensity‐scored matched non‐COVID group, the postoperative outcomes were worse, especially in the ICU readmitted patients. We suggest postponing cardiac operations unless the patient requires emergency surgery.","Barkhordari, Khosro; Khajavi, Mohamad R.; Bagheri, Jamshid; Nikkhah, Sepideh; Shirzad, Mahmood; Barkhordari, Sepehr; Kharazmian, Katayun; Nosrati, Marjan",J Card Surg,233,10
