17192,Association of Mobile Instant Messaging Chat Group Participation With Family Functioning and Well-Being: Population-Based Cross-sectional Study,2021-03-15,"Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common chronic sleep disorder that disrupts breathing during sleep and is associated with many other medical conditions, including hypertension, coronary heart disease, and depression. Clinically, the standard for diagnosing OSA involves nocturnal polysomnography (PSG). However, this requires expert human intervention and considerable time, which limits the availability of OSA diagnosis in public health sectors. Therefore, electrocardiogram (ECG)-based methods for OSA detection have been proposed to automate the polysomnography procedure and reduce its discomfort. So far, most of the proposed approaches rely on feature engineering, which calls for advanced expert knowledge and experience. This paper proposes a novel fused-image-based technique that detects OSA using only a single-lead ECG signal. In the proposed approach, a convolutional neural network extracts features automatically from images created with one-minute ECG segments. The proposed network comprises 37 layers, including four residual blocks, a dense layer, a dropout layer, and a soft-max layer. In this study, three time–frequency representations, namely the scalogram, the spectrogram, and the Wigner–Ville distribution, were used to investigate the effectiveness of the fused-image-based approach. We found that blending scalogram and spectrogram images further improved the system’s discriminative characteristics. Seventy ECG recordings from the PhysioNet Apnea-ECG database were used to train and evaluate the proposed model using 10-fold cross validation. The results of this study demonstrated that the proposed classifier can perform OSA detection with an average accuracy, recall, and specificity of 92.4%, 92.3%, and 92.6%, respectively, for the fused spectral images.","Niroshana, S.

17693,Efficacy evaluation of rubber cup and air polishing techniques using glycine in plaque and stain removal - A clinical trial,2021-02-27,"BACKGROUND: Hispanic/Latino sexual and gender minorities (SGM) are the fastest growing ethnic group of SGM in the United States. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among Hispanics/Latinos. SGM inequities in CVD risk have been identified as early as young adulthood, and minority stress has been identified as a potential mediator. Yet, the small number of ethnic or racial minority participants in SGM studies have precluded the examination of the intersections of sexual orientation, gender identity, and race and ethnicity. OBJECTIVE: Minority stress models conceptualize relationships between stressors in minority groups and health outcomes. In this study, we will (1) examine the influence of sexual orientation and gender identity on CVD risk among all Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL) participants at visit 3 (2021-2024; N~9300); (2) model pathways from sexual orientation and gender identity to CVD risk through stigma, discrimination, and stress in a 1:2 matched subcohort of SGM and non-SGM participants at visit 3 (n~1680); and (3) examine the influence of resilience factors on sexual orientation or gender identity and CVD risk relationships among subcohort participants at visit 3 (n~1680). METHODS: This study will leverage existing data from the parent HCHS/SOL study (collected since 2008) while collecting new data on sexual orientation, gender identity, stigma, discrimination, stress, coping, social support, and CVD risk. Data analysis will follow the SGM minority stress model, which states that excess stigma against SGM populations leads to minority stress that increases CVD risk. In this model, coping and social support serve as resilience factors that can mitigate the impact of minority stress on CVD risk. Cross-sectional and longitudinal regression models as well as structural equation models will be used to test these relationships. RESULTS: This study was funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute in March 2020. Recruitment is scheduled to begin in the first quarter of 2021 and continue through 2024. CONCLUSIONS: Understanding the influence of stigma-induced stress on CVD risk among Hispanic/Latino SGM has significant implications for the development of culturally specific CVD risk reduction strategies. Study findings will be used to build on identified Hispanic/Latino cultural strengths to inform adaptation and testing of family and community acceptance interventions.

17713,"Retrospective sequential trend analysis of neoplasms reported in a tertiary care hospital of district Etawah, Uttar Pradesh",2021-04-08,"BACKGROUND: Sedentary behaviour (SB) and low levels of physical activity (PA) are predictors of morbidity and mortality. Tertiary employees spend a considerable amount of their daily time seated and new efficient strategies to both reduce sedentary time and increase physical activity are needed. In that context, the REMOVE study aims at evaluating the health effects of a 24-week cycling desk intervention among office workers. METHODS: A prospective, open-label, multicentre, two-arm parallel, randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be conducted in office-sitting desk workers. Office workers (N = 80) who have 0.8 full time equivalent hours (FTE) and 75% of this time in a sitting position will be recruited from tertiary worksites in Clermont-Ferrand, France. Subjects will be randomly assigned to one of the two following interventions: (i) PPM6: performance of two 30 min of cycling desk (using portable pedal exercise machine—PPM) per working day for 6 months or (ii) CTL_PPM3: 3 months with no intervention (control) followed by 3 months during which workers will be asked to complete two 30 min of PPM per working day. At baseline (T0), at 3 months (T1) and at 6 months (T2) after the start of the interventions, primary outcomes; 7-day PA and SB (3D-accelerometers), secondary outcomes; body composition (bioelectrical impedance), physical fitness (aerobic fitness, upper and lower limb strength), metabolic outcomes (fasting blood samples), self-perceived stress, anxiety, quality of life at work and job strain (questionnaires), tertiary outcomes; resting metabolic rate and cycling energy expenditure (indirect calorimetry) and eating behaviours (questionnaires) will be measured. An ergonomic approach based on observations and individual interviews will be used to identify parameters that could determine adherence. DISCUSSION: The REMOVE study will be the first RCT to assess the effects of cycling workstations on objectively measured PA and SB during working and non-working hours and on key physiological and psychological health outcomes. This study will provide important information regarding the implementation of such cycling workstations in office workers and on the associated potential health benefits.

17714,Overview of e-Health initiatives in Rajasthan: An exploratory study,2021-04-08,"BACKGROUND: Current standard interventions are not universally sufficient for malaria elimination. The effects of community-based house improvement (HI) and larval source management (LSM) as supplementary interventions to the Malawi National Malaria Control Programme (NMCP) interventions were assessed in the context of an intensive community engagement programme. METHODS: The study was a two-by-two factorial, cluster-randomized controlled trial in Malawi. Village clusters were randomly assigned to four arms: a control arm; HI; LSM; and HI + LSM. Malawi NMCP interventions and community engagement were used in all arms. Household-level, cross-sectional surveys were conducted on a rolling, 2-monthly basis to measure parasitological and entomological outcomes over 3 years, beginning with one baseline year. The primary outcome was the entomological inoculation rate (EIR). Secondary outcomes included mosquito density, Plasmodium falciparum prevalence, and haemoglobin levels. All outcomes were assessed based on intention to treat, and comparisons between trial arms were conducted at both cluster and household level. RESULTS: Eighteen clusters derived from 53 villages with 4558 households and 20,013 people were randomly assigned to the four trial arms. The mean nightly EIR fell from 0.010 infectious bites per person (95% CI 0.006–0.015) in the baseline year to 0.001 (0.000, 0.003) in the last year of the trial. Over the full trial period, the EIR did not differ between the four trial arms (p = 0.33). Similar results were observed for the other outcomes: mosquito density and P. falciparum prevalence decreased over 3 years of sampling, while haemoglobin levels increased; and there were minimal differences between the trial arms during the trial period. CONCLUSIONS: In the context of high insecticide-treated bed net use, neither community-based HI, LSM, nor HI + LSM contributed to further reductions in malaria transmission or prevalence beyond the reductions observed over two years across all four trial arms. This was the first trial, as far as the authors are aware, to test the potential complementary impact of LSM and/or HI beyond levels achieved by standard interventions. The unexpectedly low EIR values following intervention implementation indicated a promising reduction in malaria transmission for the area, but also limited the usefulness of this outcome for measuring differences in malaria transmission among the trial arms.

18552,Exposure of second hand smoke in women and children: A narrative review,2021-05-31,"Dengue is a viral disease transmitted by mosquitoes. The rapid spread of dengue could lead to a global pandemic, and so the geographical extent of this spread needs to be assessed and predicted. There are also reasons to suggest that transmission of dengue from non-human primates in tropical forest cycles is being underestimated. We investigate the fine-scale geographic changes in transmission risk since the late 20(th) century, and take into account for the first time the potential role that primate biogeography and sylvatic vectors play in increasing the disease transmission risk. We apply a biogeographic framework to the most recent global dataset of dengue cases. Temporally stratified models describing favorable areas for vector presence and for disease transmission are combined. Our models were validated for predictive capacity, and point to a significant broadening of vector presence in tropical and non-tropical areas globally. We show that dengue transmission is likely to spread to affected areas in China, Papua New Guinea, Australia, USA, Colombia, Venezuela, Madagascar, as well as to cities in Europe and Japan. These models also suggest that dengue transmission is likely to spread to regions where there are presently no or very few reports of occurrence. According to our results, sylvatic dengue cycles account for a small percentage of the global extent of the human case record, but could be increasing in relevance in Asia, Africa, and South America. The spatial distribution of factors favoring transmission risk in different regions of the world allows for distinct management strategies to be prepared.","Aliaga-Samanez, Alisa; Cobos-Mayo, Marina; Real, Raimundo; Segura, Marina; Romero, David; Fa, Julia E.; Olivero, Jesús",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8211191/,692
19879,Recruitment and Retention Strategies Among Racial and Ethnic Minorities in Web-Based Intervention Trials: Retrospective Qualitative Analysis,2021-07-12,"BACKGROUND: Depression has a profound impact on population health. Although using web-based mental health programs to prevent depression has been found to be effective in decreasing depression incidence, there are obstacles preventing their use, as reflected by the low rates of use and adherence. OBJECTIVE: The aims of the study are to understand the barriers to using web-based mental health programs for the prevention of depression and the possible dangers or concerns regarding the use of such programs. METHODS: BroMatters and HardHat were two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the effectiveness of e–mental health programs for preventing workplace depression. In the BroMatters RCT, only working men who were at high risk of having a major depressive episode were included. The participants were assigned to either the control group or 1 of 2 intervention groups. The control participants had access to the general depression information on the BroMatters website. Intervention group 1 had access to BroMatters and BroHealth—the depression prevention program. Intervention group 2 had access to BroMatters and BroHealth along with weekly access to a qualified coach through telephone calls. The HardHat trial targeted both men and women at high risk of having a major depressive episode. The participants in the intervention group were given access to the HardHat depression prevention program (which included a web-based coach), whereas HardHat access was only granted to the control group once the study was completed. This qualitative study recruited male participants from the intervention groups of the two RCTs. A total of 2 groups of participants were recruited from the BroMatters study (after a baseline interview: n=41; 1 month after the RCT: n=20; 61/744, 8.2%), and 1 group was recruited from the HardHat RCT 1 month after the initial quantitative interview (9/103, 8.7%). Semistructured interviews were performed with the participants (70/847, 8.3%) and analyzed using content analysis. RESULTS: There were both personal and program-level barriers to program use. The three personal barriers included time, stress level, and the perception of depression prevention. Content, functionality, and dangers were the program-level barriers to the use of web-based mental health programs. Large amounts of text and functionality issues within the programs decreased participants’ engagement. The dangers associated with web-based mental health programs included privacy breaches and inadequate help for severe symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: There are personal and program-level barriers to the use of web-based mental health programs. The stigmatization of help seeking for depression symptoms affects the time spent on the program, as does the public perception of depression. Certain barriers may be mitigated by program updates, whereas others may require a complete shift in the perception of depression prevention.","Eccles, Heidi; Nannarone, Molly; Lashewicz, Bonnie; Attridge, Mark; Marchand, Alain; Aiken, Alice; Ho, Kendall; Wang, JianLi",JMIR Form Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8323021/,692

43789,Informed consent for telemedicine,2020-10-30,"INTRODUCTION: Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) are common complications in idiopathic inflammatory myopathy (IIM) patients, and are frequently associated with unfavorable outcome as well as prolonged antibiotic therapy. In this study, we intended to clarify whether clinical pulmonary infection score (CPIS) and multiple serum biomarkers are valuable in predicting unfavorable outcomes and prolonged antibiotic therapy in adult IIM patients complicated with CAP or HAP. METHODS: Data of IIM patients with CAP or HAP who were admitted to three tertiary centers from December 2010 to November 2019 were retrospectively collected. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis and logistic regression analysis were adopted to identify risk factors for unfavorable outcomes and prolonged antibiotic therapy in these patients. The predictive values of potential predictors were assessed using receiver operating characteristic analysis. RESULTS: The mortality rate was 60.6% in 109 IIM patients complicated with CAP or HAP. Myositis Disease Activity Assessment Visual Analogue Scales (MYOACT) score, CPIS and timely adjustment to antibiotics based on drug susceptibility test (DST-based antibiotic) were significantly associated with long-term outcome in these patients. With an optimal cutoff value of 6.5 and area under the curve (AUC) of 0.813, CPIS was a more satisfying predictor compared with MYOACT score. The peak C-reactive protein (CRP) level, DST-based antibiotics, and complication of interstitial lung disease (ILD) were also significantly correlated with prolonged antibiotic therapy. CONCLUSIONS: IIM patients complicated with CAP or HAP frequently suffer from unfavorable outcomes. Compared with IIM disease activity, CPIS worked as a better predictor of outcome in these patients. Also, the peak CRP level during hospitalization might be valuable in predicting prolonged antibiotic therapy. The existence of ILD might impede early discontinuation of antibiotics. Timely adjustment to antibiotics based on drug susceptibility testing would decrease the mortality rate and reduce the incidence of prolonged antibiotic therapy.

In crossing this gender representation threshold, we have outperformed doctors nationally.In order to embrace our highly educated workforce and support them to better serve their patients and the population, urgent debate and action aimed at reshaping current systems of dental care provision are required. In this regard, flexible working arrangements, together with reshaping professional leadership to better represent the workforce, as well as changes in terminology can all play their part; however, we will need careful discussions about how this might happen effectively.A collaborative effort between the dental profession and wider health systems is required to ensure that there are opportunities for everyone to flourish and contribute back to the profession and society.

This planning study evaluated a stereotactic boost after concurrent chemoradiotherapy (30 × 2 Gy) to improve local control. The maximum achievable boost directed to radioresistant primary tumor subvolumes based on pre-treatment fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (18F-FDG-PET/CT) (pre-treatment-PET) and on early response monitoring 18F-FDG-PET/CT (ERM-PET) was compared. Materials and methods For ten patients, a stereotactic boost (VMAT) was planned on ERM-PET (PTVboost;ERM) and on pre-treatment-PET (PTVboost;pre-treatment), using a 70% SUVmax threshold with 7 mm margin to segmentate radioresistant subvolumes. Dose was escalated till organ at risk (OAR) constraints were met, aiming to plan at least 18 Gy in 3 fractions (EQD2 84 Gy/BED 100.8 Gy). Results In five patients, PTVboost;ERM was 9-40% smaller relative to PTVboost;pre-treatment. Overlap of PTVboost;ERM with OARs decreased also compared to overlap of PTVboost;pre-treatment with OARs. However, any overlap with OAR remained in 4/5 patients resulting in minimal differences between planned dose before and during treatment. Median dose (EQD2) covering 99% and 95% of PTVboost;ERM were 15 Gy and 18 Gy respectively. Median boost volume receiving a physical dose of ≥ 18 Gy (V18) was 88%. V18 was ≥ 80% for PTVboost in six patients. Conclusions A significant stereotactic boost to volumes with high initial or persistent 18F-FDG-uptake could be planned above 60 Gy chemoradiation. Differences between planned dose before and during treatment were minimal. However, as an ERM-PET also monitors changes in tumor position, we recommend to plan the boost on the ERM-PET.","Meijer, Tineke W H; Wijsman, Robin; Usmanij, Edwin A; Schuurbiers, Olga C J; Kollenburg, Peter van; Bouwmans, Liza; Bussink, Johan; Geus-Oei, Lioe-Fee de",Physics and imaging in radiation oncology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.phro.2018.08.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33458400/,692

97575,Zika fever and congenital Zika syndrome: an unexpected emerging arboviral disease.,2016,"Synthetic glucocorticoids (sGCs) such as dexamethasone (DEX), while used to mitigate inflammation and disease progression in premature infants with severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), are also associated with significant adverse neurologic effects such as reductions in myelination and abnormalities in neuroanatomical development. Ciclesonide (CIC) is a sGC prodrug approved for asthma treatment that exhibits limited systemic side effects. Carboxylesterases enriched in the lower airways convert CIC to the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) agonist des-CIC. We therefore examined whether CIC would likewise activate GR in neonatal lung but have limited adverse extra-pulmonary effects, particularly in the developing brain. Neonatal rats were administered subcutaneous injections of CIC, DEX or vehicle from postnatal days 1-5 (PND1-PND5). Systemic effects linked to DEX exposure, including reduced body and brain weight, were not observed in CIC treated neonates. Furthermore, CIC did not trigger the long-lasting reduction in myelin basic protein expression in the cerebral cortex nor cerebellar size caused by neonatal DEX exposure. Conversely, DEX and CIC were both effective at inducing the expression of select GR target genes in neonatal lung, including those implicated in lung-protective and anti-inflammatory effects. Thus, CIC is a promising, novel candidate drug to treat or prevent BPD in neonates given its activation of GR in neonatal lung and limited adverse neurodevelopmental effects. Furthermore, since sGCs such as DEX administered to pregnant women in pre-term labor can adversely affect fetal brain development, the neurological-sparing properties of CIC, make it an attractive alternative for DEX to treat pregnant women severely ill with respiratory illness, such as with asthma exacerbations or COVID-19 infections.","Jaumotte, Juliann D; Franks, Alexis L; Bargerstock, Erin M; Kisanga, Edwina Philip; Menden, Heather L; Ghersi, Alexis; Omar, Mahmoud; Wang, Liping; Rudine, Anthony; Short, Kelly L; Silswal, Neerupama; Cole, Timothy J; Sampath, Venkatesh; Monaghan-Nichols, A Paula; DeFranco, Donald B",Neurobiology of disease,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nbd.2021.105422; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34126164/,692

120959,Identifying the Impact of Intimate Partner Violence in Humanitarian Settings: Using an Ecological Framework to Review 15 Years of Evidence.,2021-06-29,"BACKGROUND The diagnosis of peripheral pulmonary lesions (PPLs) is a challenging task for pulmonologists, especially for small PPLs. Conventional localization of these small PPLs, which are > 1 cm away from the visceral pleura in operation, is quite difficult. Currently used methods inevitably damage the visceral pleura and may cause a series of complications, such as pneumothorax and hemothorax. Hence, the present study aimed to find out an intraoperative localization method with no damage to the visceral pleura. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed 21 patients with PLLs who underwent electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy (ENB)-guided biopsy plus a new methylene blue staining with the help of massage (Massage Staining) in our department between August 2017 and December 2018. RESULTS The median age of these 21 patients was 51.3 ± 2.1 years. The diameter of the PPLs was 8.2 ± 2.3 mm. The rate of successful biopsy was 76.2%, and the rate of excellent or satisfactory of Massage Staining was 81.0%, while all lesions of these 21 cases were included in the range of staining, and the median distance from the edge of the stained site to the edge of the lesion was 29 ± 18 mm. The duration of ENB-guided biopsy plus Massage Staining was 26.7 ± 5.3 min, and the intraoperative blood loss was 3.3 ± 1.5 ml. No pneumothorax, hemorrhage, and tracheal injury occurred intraoperatively.

126928,Getting back to practice.,2020-05-01,"BACKGROUND Few studies of the healthy immigrant effect (HIE) have examined the mental health outcomes of Canadian-born individuals on a national scale compared with immigrants by admission category. This study fills this gap by examining the self-reported mental health (SRMH) of immigrants by admission category and other immigration dimensions (e.g., source world region and duration since landing) and making comparisons with Canadian-born respondents to a population-based survey. DATA AND METHODS Based on four cycles (2011 to 2014) of the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) linked to the Longitudinal Immigration Database (IMDB), odds ratios of high (i.e., excellent or very good) SRMH among Canadian-born respondents and IMDB-linked immigrants are compared using logistic regression. Among the IMDB immigrant population, high SRMH was also examined according to the above-mentioned immigration dimensions. Adjusted results were hierarchically controlled for age, sex, social and economic factors, and sense of belonging. RESULTS Age-sex adjusted results show that immigrants, especially refugees, are less likely than the Canadian-born population to report high mental health levels, but these differences disappeared after full adjustment. The odds of immigrants having high SRMH differed more by source world region and duration since landing. For example, fully adjusted results show support for the HIE, with recent immigrants (interviewed within 10 years of landing) more likely to report high SRMH than either the Canadian-born population or established immigrants. Greater odds of high SRMH among recent immigrants also holds across admission classes and for selected world regions. DISCUSSION This study provides new evidence on differences in mental health between Canadian-born individuals and immigrants by various characteristics. Results support a deterioration of the HIE in SRMH and identify factors significantly associated with SRMH. This study can also serve as a baseline for further studies on the impact of COVID-19 on immigrants' mental health by immigrant category.","Ng, Edward; Zhang, Haozhen",Health reports,https://doi.org/10.25318/82-003-x202000800001-eng; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32816413/,692

Various studies have demonstrated their association with clinical and psychological factors, including depression, anxiety, aggression, anger expression, and behavioral inhibition, and behavioral activation systems. However, these two addictions are also highly correlated with each other, so the consideration of the relationship between internet and smartphone addiction can enhance the analysis. In this study, we considered the copula regression model to regress the bivariate addictions on clinical and psychological factors. Real data analysis with 555 students (age range: 14-15 years; males, N = 295; females, N = 265) from South Korean public middle schools is illustrated. By fitting the copula regression model, we investigated the dependency between internet and smartphone addiction and determined the risk factors associated with the two addictions. Furthermore, by comparing the model fits of the copula model with linear regression and generalized linear models, the best copula model was proposed in terms of goodness of fit. Our findings revealed that internet and smartphone addiction are not separate problems, and that associations between them should be considered. Psychological factors, such as anxiety, the behavioral inhibition system, and aggression were also significantly associated with both addictions, while ADHD symptoms were related to internet addiction only. We emphasize the need to establish policies on the prevention, management, and education of addiction.","Lee, Minji; Chung, Sun Ju; Lee, Youngjo; Park, Sera; Kwon, Jun-Gun; Kim, Dai Jin; Lee, Donghwan; Choi, Jung-Seok",International journal of environmental research and public health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17165806; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32796609/,692

METHODS Descriptive and qualitative study, with 11 elders hospitalized in a university hospital, aiming to identify their needs for Comfort. RESULTS Discourses were categorized in four thematic units: Physical, Environmental, Sociocultural, and Psychospiritual. In the Physical context, several subcategories were found, namely, Symptom Relief; Daily Life Activities; Hygiene and personal care; Diet; Sleep and rest. In the Environmental context, the Comfort was considered to be superior than in the elders' home; in the Sociocultural one, family bonds were found to become more distant, triggering feelings of missing one's family and isolation, in the Psychospiritual context, spirituality and religiosity stood out. FINAL CONSIDERATIONS The Comfort needs of the hospitalized elders enable one to reflect on nursing care, offering information to improve the quality of assistance and to attend to the real needs of the elderly.","Oliveira, Sanni Moraes de; Costa, Kátia Neyla de Freitas Macêdo; Santos, Kamyla Félix Oliveira Dos; Oliveira, Jacira Dos Santos; Pereira, Maria Auxiliadora; Fernandes, Maria das Graças Melo",Revista brasileira de enfermagem,https://doi.org/10.1590/0034-7167-2019-0501; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33084827/,692

Little is known, however, about respiratory timing and breath-to-breath variability during sleep. The aim of this study was to investigate respiratory parameters across sleep stages in children with SDB before and after treatment compared with healthy children. Overnight polysomnography (PSG) was conducted in 40 children with SDB prior to and 6 mo following adenotonsillectomy. For comparison, a control group of 40 healthy sex- and age-matched children underwent two PSGs at equivalent time points but without intervention. The following variables were measured breath by breath during obstruction-free periods in stage 2 nonrapid eye movement (NREM), stage 4 NREM, and REM sleep: inspiratory time (Ti), expiratory time (Te), total time (Ttotal), inspiratory duty cycle (DC; =Ti/Ttotal), respiratory frequency (fR), and SD of the parameters Ti, Te, fR, and DC. Variability in waveform morphology was also computed using the residue of respiratory patterns. The severity of SDB was relatively mild in the study cohort (obstructive apnea hypopnea index: baseline, 5.1 ± 9.4 vs. 0.1 ± 0.2, P < 0.001; follow-up, 0.3 ± 0.3 vs. 0.8 ± 1.0, P < 0.01). Compared with healthy controls, children with SDB showed significantly longer Ti and Te and a lower fR at the baseline study. These differences were not significant after adenotonsillectomy. Sleep stages were associated with significant differences in all of the respiratory measures in both groups of children. In conclusion, children with relatively mild SDB showed prolonged inspiration and expiration indicative of chronic narrowing of the upper airway. Treatment of SDB normalizes respiratory timing. Documentation of these parameters may aid in both understanding and management of children with SDB.","Immanuel, Sarah A; Pamula, Yvonne; Kohler, Mark; Martin, James; Kennedy, Declan; Kabir, Muammar M; Saint, David A; Baumert, Mathias",Journal of applied physiology,https://doi.org/10.1152/japplphysiol.00756.2012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23019313/,692

To compare them to findings and outcomes in patients with pulmonary embolism without COVID-19. MATERIAL AND METHODS Multicenter, observational, retrospective study in 4 Spanish hospital emergency departments (EDs) from January 15 to April 15, 2020. Cases were located by reviewing all ED requests for pulmonary computed tomography angiography (CTA) procedures. Clinical, laboratory, and radiologic findings; medical histories and comorbidity; risk factors; and outcomes were compared between the 2 groups of patients (with or without COVID-19). RESULTS A total of 399 CTAs were ordered; 88 pulmonary embolisms were diagnosed, 28 of them (32%) in patients with COVID-19. This group had more men, and a history of thromboembolic disease was more common. We found no between-group differences in clinical presentation, laboratory, or radiologic findings; nor were there differences in final outcomes. In-hospital mortality was 7% (2 cases) in patients with COVID-19 and 17% (10 cases) in patients without the virus (odds ratio for death in patients with pulmonary embolism and COVID-19, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.08-1.89). CONCLUSION We found no clinically important differences in the clinical, laboratory, or radiologic findings between patients with or without COVID-19 who were treated for pulmonary embolism in our hospital EDs. Final outcomes also did not differ.","Jiménez Hernández, Sònia; Lozano Polo, Laura; Suñen Cuquerella, Guillem; Peña Pardo, Bárbara; Espinosa, Begoña; Cardozo, Carlos; Aguirre Tejedo, Alfons; Llorens Soriano, Pere; Miró, Òscar",Emergencias : revista de la Sociedad Espanola de Medicina de Emergencias,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32692002/,692

Here we use machine learning to quantify COVID-19 content among online opponents of establishment health guidance, in particular vaccinations ('anti-vax'). We find that the anti-vax community is developing a less focused debate around COVID-19 than its counterpart, the pro-vaccination ('pro-vax') community. However, the anti-vax community exhibits a broader range of 'flavors' of COVID-19 topics, and hence can appeal to a broader cross-section of individuals seeking COVID-19 guidance online, e.g. individuals wary of a mandatory fast-tracked COVID-19 vaccine or those seeking alternative remedies. Hence the anti-vax community looks better positioned to attract fresh support going forward than the pro-vax community. This is concerning since a widespread lack of adoption of a COVID-19 vaccine will mean the world falls short of providing herd immunity, leaving countries open to future COVID-19 resurgences. We provide a mechanistic model that interprets these results and could help in assessing the likely efficacy of intervention strategies. Our approach is scalable and hence tackles the urgent problem facing social media platforms of having to analyze huge volumes of online health misinformation and disinformation.","Sear, Richard F.; Velasquez, Nicolas; Leahy, Rhys; Restrepo, Nicholas Johnson; Oud, Sara El; Gabriel, Nicholas; Lupu, Yonatan; Johnson, Neil F.",IEEE Access,,692

OBJECTIVES: Describe the perceptions of health professionals in the Central Maghreb (Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco) as to the Strengths/Opportunities and Weaknesses/Threats of the national response plans against COVID-19, during the first weeks of their execution, and report their proposals for optimizing the performance of control strategies. METHODS: This is a qualitative study of the perceptions of health professionals in the Maghreb Central regarding their experience of the first six weeks of fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. The data was collected using the ""Delphi"" technique in one turn, based on an electronic form such as ""Google Form"", developed according to SWOT analysis. The respondents' verbatim was grouped into homogeneous groups of items, the occurrence of which was subsequently measured. RESULTS: A total of 382 health professionals from the Maghreb Central participated in this study, with a median age of 37 years and a median professional tenure of 10 years. The major force of the Maghreb response strategies, the most shared by the respondents, was the performance of the human resources mobilized (doctors, biologists, nurses, etc.) who succeeded in quickly learning from the international epidemiological expertise accumulated in Asia and in Europe. The fight against COVID-19 in the Central Maghreb was confronted with the general and chronic fragility of the national health systems and the low support of the general population for the recommendations of the steering committees of response, threatening the capacity of the Maghreb to confront new epidemics. CONCLUSION: The success of the national response plans against COVID-19 and of possible epidemics or pandemics in the Central Maghreb, is strongly attributed to the commitment of health professionals and to community participation, necessitating the launch of assistant motivation programs. and development of health personnel and mobilization and loyalty of civil society.","Ben Abdelaziz, Ahmed; Benzarti, Sofien; Achouri, Mohamed Yacine; Nouira, Sarra; Mlouki, Imen; Yahia, Faten; Ben Abdelaziz, Asma; Barhoumi, Tarek; Quessar, Asmaa; Ben Salem, Kamel",Tunis Med,,692

The impact of 42 mutations discovered so far on the structure and thermodynamics of SARS-CoV-2 RBD was also assessed. The binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 RBD for ACE2 is higher than that of SARS-CoV RBD. The binding of COVA2-04 antibody to SARS-CoV-2 RBD is more energetically favorable than the binding of COVA2-39, but also less favorable than the formation of SARS-CoV-2 RBD-ACE2 complex. The net charge, the dipole moment and hydrophilicity of SARS-CoV-2 RBD are higher than those of SARS-CoV RBD, producing lower solvation and surface free energies and thus lower stability. The structure of SARS-CoV-2 RBD is also more flexible and more open, with a larger solvent-accessible surface area than that of SARS-CoV RBD. Single-point mutations have a dramatic effect on distribution of charges, most prominently at the site of substitution and its immediate vicinity. These charge alterations alter the free energy landscape, while XâF mutations exhibit a stabilizing effect on the RBD structure through &#960; stacking. F456 and W436 emerge as two key residues governing the stability and affinity of the spike protein for its ACE2 receptor.

We aimed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of serological testing in COVID-19 by providing summary sensitivity and specificity estimates with time from symptom onset. METHODS: A systematic search of Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and PubMed was performed up to May 13, 2020. All English language, original peer-reviewed publications reporting the diagnostic performance of serological testing vis-à-vis virologically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were included. RESULTS: Our search yielded 599 unique publications. A total of 39 publications reporting 11 516 samples from 8872 human participants met eligibility criteria for inclusion in our study. Pooled percentages of IgM and IgG seroconversion by Day 7, 14, 21, 28 and after Day 28 were 37.5%, 73.3%, 81.3%, 72.3% and 73.3%, and 35.4%, 80.6%, 93.3%, 84.4% and 98.9%, respectively. By Day 21, summary estimate of IgM sensitivity was 0.872 (95% CI: 0.784-0.928) and specificity 0.973 (95% CI: 0.938-0.988), while IgG sensitivity was 0.913 (95% CI: 0.823-0.959) and specificity 0.960 (95% CI: 0.919-0.980). On meta-regression, IgM and IgG test accuracy was significantly higher at Day 14 using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) compared to other methods. CONCLUSIONS: Serological assays offer imperfect sensitivity for the diagnosis of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. Estimates of population seroprevalence during or shortly after an outbreak will need to adjust for the delay between infection, symptom onset and seroconversion.","Zhang, John J Y; Lee, Keng Siang; Ong, Chee Wui; Chan, Mae Yee; Ang, Li Wei; Leo, Yee Sin; Chen, Mark I-Cheng; Lye, David Chien Boon; Young, Barnaby Edward",Influenza other respir. viruses,,692

As immune checkpoint inhibitors directly affect the immune system, concerns have arisen about the safety of immunotherapy during this pandemic. However, data on the immune response in oncology patients treated with immunotherapy are still lacking. Here, we present the adaptive immune response in a SARS-CoV-2 infected patient who was treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors for advanced renal cell cancer. To evaluate the immune response in this patient, the number of T cells and their major subsets were measured according to expression of markers for co-signalling, maturation, and chemotaxis at baseline, during therapy, and during the SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, plasma samples were analyzed for IgM and IgG antibodies and the ability of these antibodies to neutralise SARS-CoV-2. Despite several risk factors for an impaired immune response to SARS-CoV-2, both T- and B-cell responses were observed. Moreover, after treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors, a sufficient cellular and humoral immune response was achieved in this SARS-CoV-2 infected patient. These findings warrant renewed discussion on withholding of immune checkpoint inhibitors during an ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","de Joode, K; Oostvogels, A A M; GeurtsvanKessel, C H; de Vries, R D; Mathijssen, R H J; Debets, R; van der Veldt, A A M",Front Immunol,,692

METHODS: A one-day audit was carried out recording: age, measured or estimated body weight (BW) and height, body mass index (BMI, kg/m2), 30-day weight loss (WL), comorbidities, serum albumin and C-reactive protein (CRP: nv < 0.5 mg/dL), hospital diet (HD) intake, oral nutritional supplements (ONS), enteral (EN) and parenteral nutrition (PN). Modified NRS-2002 tool and GLIM criteria were used for nutritional risk screening and for the diagnosis of malnutrition, respectively. RESULTS: A total of 268 patients was evaluated; intermediate care units (IMCUs, 61%), sub-intensive care units (SICUs, 8%), intensive care units (ICUs, 17%) and rehabilitation units (RUs, 14%): BMI: <18.5, 9% (higher in RUs, p = 0.008) and &#8805;30, 13% (higher in ICUs, p = 0.012); WL &#8805; 5%, 52% (higher in ICUs and RUs, p = 0.001); CRP >0.5: 78% (higher in ICUs and lower in RUs, p < 0.001); Nutritional risk and malnutrition were present in 77% (higher in ICUs and RUs, p < 0.001) and 50% (higher in ICUs, p = 0.0792) of the patients, respectively.

CONCLUSIONS: Most of the patients were at nutritional risk, and one-half of them was malnourished. The frequency of nutritional risk, malnutrition, disease/inflammation burden and decrease intake of HD differed among the intensity of care settings, where the patients were managed according to the severity of the disease. The patient energy and protein intake were at the lowest limit or below the recommended amounts, indicating the need for actions to improve the nutritional care practice.","Pironi, Loris; Sasdelli, Anna Simona; Ravaioli, Federico; Baracco, Bianca; Battaiola, Claudia; Bocedi, Giulia; Brodosi, Lucia; Leoni, Laura; Mari, Giulia Aurora; Musio, Alessandra",Clin. nutr.

253896,"Revealing Opinions for COVID-19 Questions Using a Context Retriever, Opinion Aggregator, and Question-Answering Model: Model Development Study",2021,"The recent COVID-19 outbreak and significant increase in resulting global uncertainty poses many challenges to financial sectors. Many regulators took measures to safeguard the resilience of financial institutions by requesting postponements of dividend distributions until uncertainties about further development diminished. Specifically, on 2 April 2020, the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority issued a statement requesting that re/insurers suspend all discretionary dividend distributions and share buybacks aimed at remunerating shareholders. Although the goal was to strengthen the overall financial stability of the sector, it may have negatively influenced insurers’ equity prices in the short term. Hence, this paper empirically investigates this potential effect using an event study methodology. Although negative drops were observed in some cases, the obtained empirical results suggest that they were not statistically significant for the European insurers’ equity market when considering the event windows covering several days after the statement was published.","Jakubik, Petr Teleu Saida",The Geneva papers on risk and insurance.

Controversy surrounds the circulating cytokine/chemokine profile of COVID19-associated ARDS, with some groups suggesting that it is similar to non-COVID19 ARDS patients and others observing substantial differences. Moreover, while a hyperinflammatory phenotype associates with higher mortality in non-COVID19 ARDS, there is little information on the inflammatory landscape's association with mortality in COVID19 ARDS patients. Even though the circulating leukocytes' transcriptomic signature has been associated with distinct phenotypes and outcomes in critical illness including ARDS, it is unclear whether the mortality-associated inflammatory mediators from COVID19 patients are transcriptionally regulated in the leukocyte compartment. Here, we conducted a prospective cohort study of 41 mechanically ventilated patients with COVID19 infection using highly calibrated methods to define the levels of plasma cytokines/chemokines and their gene expressions in circulating leukocytes. Plasma IL1RA and IL8 were found positively associated with mortality while RANTES and EGF negatively associated with that outcome. However, the leukocyte gene expression of these proteins had no statistically significant correlation with mortality. These data suggest a unique inflammatory signature associated with severe COVID19.","Balnis, Joseph; Adam, Alejandro P; Chopra, Amit; Chieng, Hau C; Drake, Lisa A; Martino, Nina; Bossardi Ramos, Ramon; Feustel, Paul J; Overmyer, Katherine A; Shishkova, Evgenia; Coon, Joshua J; Singer, Harold A; Judson, Marc A; Jaitovich, Ariel","Am. j. physiol, regul. integr. comp. physiol",,692

Various detection approaches have been developed involving quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) methods, CRISPR-based systems, and direct targeting of specific coronavirus proteins. However, there have only been a few reports on the detection of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP), the primer-independent RNA-replicable protein produced by the RNA genes of coronavirus. Here, we introduce a novel diagnostic methodology for COVID-19 using the RNA-directed and de novo RNA replicable function of RdRP. We devised an RNA platform for RdRP-induced transcription (RPRIT) that includes an RNA template that can be directly transcribed by RdRP. By utilizing RPRIT, the presence of RdRP can be readily confirmed within 30 min using isothermal incubation without PCR. This RdRP detection method can provide a new route for rapid diagnosis of RNA virus-infected patients.","Han, Sangwoo; Ko, Ohsung; Lee, Geonhu; Jeong, Sun-Wook; Choi, Yong Jun; Lee, Jong Bum",Nano Lett,,692

However, in many LMICs, traditional data sets on travel such as commuting surveys as well as non-traditional sources such as mobile phone data are lacking, or, where available, have only rarely been leveraged by the public health community. Evaluating the accuracy of available data to measure transmission-relevant travel may be further hampered by limited reporting of suspected and laboratory confirmed infections. Here, we leverage case data collected as part of a COVID-19 dashboard collated via daily reports from the Malagasy authorities on reported cases of SARS-CoV-2 across the 22 regions of Madagascar. We compare the order of the timing of when cases were reported with predictions from a SARS-CoV-2 metapopulation model of Madagascar informed using various measures of connectivity including a gravity model based on different measures of distance, Internal Migration Flow data, and mobile phone data. Overall, the models based on mobile phone connectivity and the gravity-based on Euclidean distance best predicted the observed spread. The ranks of the regions most remote from the capital were more difficult to predict but interestingly, regions where the mobile phone connectivity model was more accurate differed from those where the gravity model was most accurate. This suggests that there may be additional features of mobility or connectivity that were consistently underestimated using all approaches, but are epidemiologically relevant. This work highlights the importance of data availability and strengthening collaboration among different institutions with access to critical data - models are only as good as the data that they use, so building towards effective data-sharing pipelines is essential.","Ramiadantsoa, Tanjona; Metcalf, C.

368890,How to make an alternative plastic gown during the personal protective equipment shortage due to the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Endoscopic ultrasound-guided gallbladder drainage (EUS-GBD) is an alternative treatment option for patients with acute cholecystitis, especially for those who are unsuitable for cholecystectomy. Recently used luminal apposing metal stents (LAMS) in EUS-GBD has several advantages over standard metal stents. However, there is no current guideline on where to locate the LAMS when transgastric approach is required. This study reports a case of gastric outlet obstruction (GOO) by placing LAMS too close to the pyloric ring. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 79-year-old female patient was referred to our department for evaluation of a large hepatic mass on abdominal ultrasound. Abdominal pain on right upper quadrant and spiking fever up to 38â°C appeared after liver biopsy. Abdominal ultrasound showed thickened GB wall and positive sonographic Murphy sign. DIAGNOSES: Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma with multiple lung and intrahepatic metastasis, acute cholecystitis, and pyloric ring obstruction caused by flange of LAMS in EUS-GBD. INTERVENTIONS: EUS-GBD via transgastric approach was performed with LAMS. After complete deployment of stent, esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed complete GOO by flange of LAMS. A gastroduodenal metal stent was inserted to relieve the GOO. OUTCOMES: The patient recovered well. She did not complain about obstruction induced symptom such as vomiting or abdominal fullness after gastroduodenal stent insertion. CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report of EUS-GBD induced GOO. If physicians use LAMS as a transgastric approach in EUS-GBD, the puncture site should be carefully selected considering the size of the flange.","Seo, Seung Young; Lee, Chang Hun; Kim, In Hee; Kim, Sang Wook; Lee, Seung Ok; Lee, Soo Teik; Kim, Seong-Hun",Medicine (Baltimore),,692

372111,Importance of effective communication during COVID-19 infodemic,2020,"INTRODUCTION: During pregnancy, SARS-CoV-2 infection may cause an abnormal development of the placenta, thus influencing maternal and fetal outcomes. Few studies have reported data on placental morphology and histology in infected pregnant patients, although not compared with carefully matched controls. The aim of this study is to compare placental morphology and histology of pregnant women affected by SARS-CoV-2 to non-infected controls. METHODS: This is a prospective multicenter case-control study on 64 pregnant women affected by SARS-CoV-2 who delivered at term or late-preterm. Data were collected about pregnancy course, maternal and fetal outcomes, placental biometry and macro- and microscopical morphology. 64 not-infected women were identified as controls, matched by age, body mass index and ethnicity. RESULTS: Cases and controls had similar fetal and maternal outcomes. No significant differences were observed in placental macro- or microscopical morphology between the two groups. In the cases treated with antivirals, chloroquine, LMWH or antibiotics, placentas were heavier but not more efficient than the non-treated, since the fetal/placental weight ratio did not differ. Moreover, delayed villous maturation was more frequent in treated women, although not significantly. The newborns whose mothers received oxygen therapy as treatment had higher levels of umbilical cord pO2 at birth. DISCUSSION: In this prospective case-control study, SARS-CoV-2 infection during the third trimester did not influence placental histological pattern. Pharmacological and oxygen therapy administered to women affected by this viral infection could impact maternal and fetal outcomes and be associated to placental histological alterations.","Tasca, Chiara; Rossi, Roberta Simona; Corti, Silvia; Anelli, Gaia Maria; Savasi, Valeria; Brunetti, Federica; Cardellicchio, Manuela; Caselli, Emilio; Tonello, Cristina; Vergani, Patrizia; Nebuloni, Manuela; Cetin, Irene",Placenta,,692
382687,[Autoimmune diseases in the context of pandemic COVID-19],2020,"BACKGROUND: Chronic respiratory diseases (CRD) are a major public health problem worldwide. In the current epidemiological context, CRD have received much interest when considering their correlation with greater susceptibility to SARS-Cov-2 and severe disease (COVID-19). Increasingly more studies have investigated pathophysiological interactions between CRD and COVID-19. AREA COVERED: Animal experimentation has decisively contributed to advancing our knowledge of CRD. Considering the increase in ethical restrictions in animal experimentation, researchers must focus on new experimental alternatives. Two-dimensional (2D) cell cultures have complemented animal models and significantly contributed to advancing research in the life sciences. However, 2D cell cultures have several limitations in studies of cellular interactions. Three-dimensional (3D) cell cultures represent a new and robust platform for studying complex biological processes and are a promising alternative in regenerative and translational medicine. EXPERT OPINION: Three-dimensional cell cultures are obtained by combining several types of cells in integrated and self-organized systems in a 3D structure. These 3D cell culture systems represent an efficient methodological approach in studies of pathophysiology and lung therapy. More recently, complex 3D culture systems, such as lung-on-a-chip, seek to mimic the physiology of a lung in vivo through a microsystem that simulates alveolar-capillary interactions and exposure to air. The present review introduces and discusses 3D lung cultures as robust platforms for studies of the pathophysiology of CRD and COVID-19 and the mechanisms that underlie interactions between CRD and COVID-19.","da Silva da Costa, Felipe Allan; Soares, Murilo Racy; Malagutti-Ferreira, Maria José; da Silva, Gustavo Ratti; Lívero, Francislaine Aparecida Dos Reis; Ribeiro-Paes, João Tadeu",,,692

We aimed to investigate the odds of developing severe COVID-19 in health and shift workers. METHODS: We included UK Biobank participants in employment or self-employed at baseline (2006-2010) and with linked COVID-19 data to 31st August 2020. Participants were grouped as neither a health worker nor shift worker (reference category) at baseline, health worker only, shift worker only, or both, and associations with severe COVID-19 investigated in logistic regressions. RESULTS: Of 235,685 participants (81·5% neither health nor shift worker, 1·4% health worker only, 16·9% shift worker only, and 0·3% both), there were 580 (0·25%) cases of severe COVID-19. The odds of severe COVID-19 was higher in health workers (adjusted odds ratio: 2·32 [95% CI: 1·33, 4·05]; shift workers (2·06 [1·72, 2·47]); and in health workers who worked shifts (7·56 [3·86, 14·79]). Being both a health worker and a shift worker had a possible greater impact on the odds of severe COVID-19 in South Asian and Black and African Caribbean ethnicities compared to White individuals. CONCLUSIONS: Both health and shift work (measured at baseline, 2006-2010) were independently associated with over twice the odds of severe COVID-19 in 2020; the odds were over seven times higher in health workers who work shifts. Vaccinations, therapeutic and preventative options should take into consideration not only health and key worker status but also shift worker status.","Rowlands, A V; Gillies, C; Chudasama, Y; Davies, M J; Islam, N; Kloecker, D E; Lawson, C; Pareek, M; Razieh, C; Zaccardi, F; Yates, T; Khunti, K",BMC Public Health,,692

395036,"Personal protective equipment (PPE) pollution driven by the COVID-19 pandemic in Cox's Bazar, the longest natural beach in the world",2021,"The recent experience of SARS-CoV-2 epidemics spreading revealed the importance of passive forms of infection transmissions. Apart from the virus survival outside the host, the latent infection transmissions caused by asymptomatic and presymptomatic hosts represent major challenges for controlling the epidemics. In this regard, social mixing and various biological factors play their subtle, but often critical, role. For example, a life-threatening condition may result in the infection contracted from an asymptomatic virus carrier. Here, we use a new recently developed microscopic agent-based modelling framework to shed light on the role of asymptomatic hosts and unravel the interplay between the biological and social factors of these nonlinear stochastic processes at high temporal resolution. The model accounts for each human actor's susceptibility and the virus survival time, as well as traceability along the infection path. These properties enable an efficient dissection of the infection events caused by asymptomatic carriers from those which involve symptomatic hosts before they develop symptoms and become removed to a controlled environment. Consequently, we assess how their relative proportions in the overall infection curve vary with changing model parameters. Our results reveal that these proportions largely depend on biological factors in the process, specifically, the virus transmissibility and the critical threshold for developing symptoms, which can be affected by the virus pathogenicity. Meanwhile, social participation activity is crucial for the overall infection level, further modulated by the virus transmissibility.","Tadic, Bosiljka; Melnik, Roderick",Comput Biol Med,,692
412279,Correlation between immune response and self-reported depression during convalescence from COVID-19,2020,"This study explored the triggering mechanism of interstitial lung disease (ILD). We established the effects of immunogenic and neurogenic calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) imbalance on the regulation of aquaporin 5 (AQP5) expression and the repair responses that promote the transition from alveolar epithelial cell (AEC) apoptosis to pulmonary fibrosis. Newly diagnosed ILD patients (n = 60) were enrolled, whose serological levels of ß-CGRP, &#945;-CGRP, AQP5, receptor activity modifying protein 1, and receptor component protein were detected by ELISA. Th1 and Th2 cytokines and CD4+ and CD8+ cells were measured by flow cytometry method. In vivo, bleomycin (BLM) was set for modeling pulmonary fibrosis. A CALCA-HET model was set as a chronic pulmonary fibrosis model. Hematoxylin-eosin, immunohistochemistry, and Masson's trichrome staining were performed to assess the role of apoptosis in the injured lung. The concentrations of cytokines were determined by cytokine antibody arrays. Abnormal activation of serological CD4+ T lymphocytes and predominant Th2 response was established in the patients with ILD. Moreover, the ratio of ß-CGRP/&#945;-CGRP positively correlated with the increased level of AQP5 in patients with ILD. In vivo, a significant increase of AQP5 and ß-CGRP at the chronic stage of pulmonary fibrosis was induced by BLM in the mice model, whereas the expression of AQP5 protein was generally lower in the acute alveolitis phase. Moreover, the levels of AQP5 and &#945;-CGRP in the CALCA-HET rats were lower than those of the normal saline group. The high ratio ß-CGRP/&#945;-CGRP enhanced the expression of AQP5, inhibited transforming growth factor-ß1 (TGFß1)/P-Smad1/Smad4 pathway, and upregulated the NRF2 signal, whereas the apoptosis of AECs was significantly reduced in late-stage pulmonary fibrosis. The imbalance of ß-CGRP/&#945;-CGRP may be associated with the predominance of Th2 response and participate in the process of AEC apoptosis in lung fibrosis. The high ratio of ß-CGRP/&#945;-CGRP may elevate the level of AQP5 through inactivation of the TGF-ß1/smad1 signaling pathway and upregulation of the Nrf2 signaling in the chronic stage of pulmonary fibrosis.","Lv, Xiaoting; Gao, Feng; Zhang, Shuyu; Zhang, Sheng; Zhou, Xiaohui; Ding, Fadian; Wang, Jingwen; Chen, Qingquan; Chen, Min; Liu, Qicai",J Interferon Cytokine Res,,692

416780,Indonesian government dilematics in Covid-19 pandemic handling,2020,"OBJECTIVES: Green space positively influences health and well-being; however, inequalities in use of green space are prevalent. Movement restrictions enforced due to the COVID-19 pandemic could have exacerbated existing inequalities regarding who visits green space. Therefore, this study aimed to explore how movement restrictions have changed the time spent visiting green space and experience of green space in the United Kingdom (UK) and how these differed by individual-level demographic characteristics. DESIGN AND OUTCOME MEASURES: A nationally representative cross-sectional survey administered through YouGov between 30 April and 1 May 2020. Data were collected on the time spent visiting green space and change in the experience of green space, including missing social interaction, increased physical activity and feeling greater mental health benefits in green space. Demographic information was collected on sex, age, ethnicity, social grade and dog ownership. Associations between specific outcome variables and predictors were assessed using logistic regression. SETTING: UK, with population weights applied. PARTICIPANTS: 2252 adults aged 18 years and over. RESULTS: Overall, 63% of respondents reported a decrease in time spent visiting green space following movement restrictions. Lower social grade respondents were less likely to visit green space before and after restrictions were enforced (OR: 0.35 (95% CI 0.24 to 0.51); OR: 0.77 (95% CI 0.63 to 0.95)). Female respondents were more likely than male respondents to agree that green space benefited their mental health more following restrictions (PP: 0.70 vs 0.59). Older (65+ years) respondents were less likely than middle-aged (25-64 years) respondents to have visited green space following the restrictions (OR: 0.79 (95% CI 0.63 to 0.98)). CONCLUSIONS: Inequalities in green space use were sustained, and possibly exacerbated, during movement restrictions. Our findings emphasise the importance of green spaces remaining open globally in any future 'lockdowns'/pandemics. Further investigation is required to determine how visit patterns and experiences change through the different stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK.","Burnett, Hannah; Olsen, Jonathan R; Nicholls, Natalie; Mitchell, Richard",BMJ Open,,692

421595,A review on exploring evidence-based approach to harnessing the immune system in times of corona virus pandemic: Best of modern and traditional Indian system of medicine,2020,"BACKGROUND: The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes coronavirus disease (COVID-19), has been declared a global pandemic. Identifying individuals whose infection can potentially become severe is critical to control the case fatality rate of COVID-19. However, knowledge of symptoms that are prognostic of COVID-19 severity is lacking. OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to identify symptoms prognostic of COVID-19 infection severity. METHODS: We analyzed documented symptoms, including fever, cough, fatigue, expectoration, sore throat, chest distress, headache, diarrhea, rhinorrhea, stuffed nose, nausea, vomiting, muscle or joint ache, shortness of breath, and their associations with disease severity using a case series, including 655 confirmed cases from January 23 to February 5, 2020 in Henan Province, China. We also analyzed the influence of individual characteristics, including age, gender, and comorbidities, on symptoms with prognostic value. RESULTS: Fatigue (95% CI 0.141 to 0.334, P<.001), expectoration (95% CI 0.107 to 0.305, P<.001) and stuffed nose (95% CI -0.499 to -0.082, P=.006) were identified as the prognostic symptoms of COVID-19 patients from the multivariate analysis. Fever occurred in 603/655 (92.1%) of the patients but was not associated with disease severity. Fatigue accounted for 184/655 (28.1%) of the patients and was linearly associated with infection severity with statistical significance. Expectoration occurred in 169/655 (25.8%) patients in the cohort and was the sole prognostic factor for patients with cardiovascular complications, including hypertension. Shortness of breath, chest distress, muscle or joint ache, and dry cough, which occurred in 33 (5%), 83 (12.7%), 78 (11.9%), and 276 (42.1%) of the 655 patients, respectively, were significantly enriched among patients classified as severe. Stuffed nose and nausea were associated with favorable disease severity, especially among male patients. More female than male patients were documented as having muscle or joint ache. Headache was most enriched in patents aged 15 to 39 years, followed by those aged 40 to 64 years, with statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: Fatigue and expectoration are signs of severe COVID-19 infection. Shortness of breath, chest distress, muscle or joint ache, and dry cough are prevalent in severe patients. Expectoration is commonly present in older individuals and patients with cardiovascular disorders, including hypertension. Shortness of breath is prognostic of severe infection in male patients. Stuffed nose and nausea are favorable prognostic factors of severe infection, especially among male patients.","Li, Jitian; Chen, Zhe; Nie, Yifei; Ma, Yan; Guo, Qiaoyun; Dai, Xiaofeng",J Med Internet Res,,692

Although RNA viruses have been studied extensively, little is known about the processes that occur during the first several hours of infection because of a lack of sensitive assays. Here we develop a single-molecule imaging assay, virus infection real-time imaging (VIRIM), to study translation and replication of individual RNA viruses in live cells. VIRIM uncovered a striking heterogeneity in replication dynamics between cells and revealed extensive coordination between translation and replication of single viral RNAs. Furthermore, using VIRIM, we identify the replication step of the incoming viral RNA as a major bottleneck of successful infection and identify host genes that are responsible for inhibition of early virus replication. Single-molecule imaging of virus infection is a powerful tool to study virus replication and virus-host interactions that may be broadly applicable to RNA viruses.","Boersma, Sanne; Rabouw, Huib H; Bruurs, Lucas J M; Pavlovic, Tonja; van Vliet, Arno L W; Beumer, Joep; Clevers, Hans; van Kuppeveld, Frank J M; Tanenbaum, Marvin E",Cell,,692

METHODS: The Bureau of Labor Statistics Current Population Survey data was analyzed in a cross-sectional study. Percent change in number employed was tabulated quarterly for groups by race and ethnicity (Black or African American, Asian American, or Hispanic or Latinx compared to White or non-Hispanic or Latinx) and frontline occupation status between January 1 and June 30, 2020. Two-tailed two-sample tests of proportions were used to compare groups statistically. RESULTS: More dramatic declines in number employed occurred in the Black or African American, Asian American, and Hispanic or Latinx groups. When stratified by sector, greater declines were noted in the Hispanic or Latinx and Asian American frontline, and Black or African American non-frontline groups when compared to the referent groups. CONCLUSIONS: Structural racism has further affected people of Color through differential employment loss during the onset of the pandemic, both overall and by sector. However, the effect of sector varies dramatically across racial and ethnic groups.

A major limitation of existing methods has been the focus on grid-like data; however, the structure of physiological recordings are often irregular and unordered which makes it difficult to conceptualise them as a matrix. As such, graph neural networks have attracted significant attention by exploiting implicit information that resides in a biological system, with interactive nodes connected by edges whose weights can be either temporal associations or anatomical junctions. In this survey, we thoroughly review the different types of graph architectures and their applications in healthcare.

This Viewpoint of infectious aerosols is intended to inform appropriate infection control measures to protect health-care workers. Studies of cough aerosols and of exhaled breath from patients with various respiratory infections have shown striking similarities in aerosol size distributions, with a predominance of pathogens in small particles (<5 µm). These are immediately respirable, suggesting the need for personal respiratory protection (respirators) for individuals in close proximity to patients with potentially virulent pathogens. There is no evidence that some pathogens are carried only in large droplets. Surgical masks might offer some respiratory protection from inhalation of infectious aerosols, but not as much as respirators. However, surgical masks worn by patients reduce exposures to infectious aerosols to health-care workers and other individuals. The variability of infectious aerosol production, with some so-called super-emitters producing much higher amounts of infectious aerosol than most, might help to explain the epidemiology of super-spreading. Airborne infection control measures are indicated for potentially lethal respiratory pathogens such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.","Fennelly, Kevin P",Lancet Respir Med,,692

453609,Coronavirus: An emergency for healthcare professionals,2020,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, face masks have been employed as a public and personal health control measure against the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Their use is intended as personal protection to prevent infection and as source control to limit transmission of the virus in a community or healthcare setting. Yet the wearing of masks has become a catalyst for political conflict, an arena where scientific evidence is often viewed through a partisan lens. The way that anti-maskers chafe at the mask requirement evokes a time when people were advised to wear a mask during the 1918 pandemic. As the Spanish flu swept through the world causing global devastation in 1918 and 1919, face masks became ubiquitous to help in preventing the spread of disease. A century apart, medical authorities urged and urge the wearing of masks to help slow the spread of disease. Nonetheless, people were and remain resistant to this simple and common sense advice. The purpose of this article is twofold: to provide a brief literature review on the unequivocal scientific evidence that masks reduce community transmission in view of the current pandemic, review mask use in children and to compare and contrast attitudes to mask wearing during the Spanish flu and the COVID-19 pandemic, and analyse where these attitudes stem from.","Scerri, Mariella; Grech, Victor",Early Hum Dev,,692

456986,Three important events to reaffirm three important elements in global COVID-19 management,2020,"In a context where the criminal courts have been drastically affected by coronavirus, this paper seeks to demonstrate that the presumption of innocence risks becoming a further casualty of Covid-19. It will argue that prolonged pre-trial detention of unconvicted defendants has been sanctioned by the senior judiciary under the Custody Time Limit (CTL) Regulations. Following a series of important CTL decisions, a universal position of the senior judiciary, one supportive of government, is emerging: despite the case backlog resulting in defendants facing trial delays of unknown length, the exceptional circumstances of the pandemic which the executive faces, amounts to 'good cause' to extend CTLs. It will be argued that the correct approach for courts to follow is that that they must hear evidence that justifies why no court rooms are available before using that to mandate extensions. It will be further contended that these far-reaching decisions came from the senior judiciary's perceived need to mop up the problem posed by widespread refusals to extend CTLs, raising questions as to their ability to act independently of political pressure. © The Author(s), 2021.

464424,Vicarious traumatization: A psychological problem that cannot be ignored during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"Introduction: Despite the evidence provided by clinical trials, there are some uncertainties and controversies regarding the use of triple inhaled therapy. With the aim of evaluating clinical practice in specialized respiratory units, a Delphi consensus document was implemented on the use of single-inhaler fixed-dose triple therapies after 1 year of use in Spain. Methods: A scientific committee of COPD experts defined a thematic index, guided a systematic literature review and helped design the Delphi questionnaire. This was sent to the other 45 COPD experts between April and June 2019. Agreement/disagreement on 58 statements was tested in two rounds using a Likert scale. Replies were classified as a consensus when &#8805;80% of the panelists agreed; a majority when a degree of agreement of &#8805;66% was reached; and divergence if agreement was <66%. Results: After two rounds, 44.44% of the statements reached consensus, 14.81% reached majority and 40.74% were divergent. Panelists agreed that escalating from double bronchodilation should be phenotype-based and aim to prevent exacerbations but not for improving symptoms. The addition of an antimuscarinic to inhaled corticosteroids combinations achieves improvement in lung function, symptoms and exacerbation prevention. Main safety concerns included the increased risk of pneumonia as compared to bronchodilator therapies, with similar cardiovascular effects. There was no consensus agreement on patient type response based on blood eosinophil counts or obstruction severity. Conclusion: The low degree of consensus among panelists may reflect the complexity of severe COPD management. The information provided here may be useful to clinicians implementing personalized medicine for COPD patients.","López-Campos, José Luis; Alcázar Navarrete, Bernardino; Riesco Miranda, Juan Antonio; Cosío, Borja G; de-Torres, Juan P; Celli, Bartolomé; Jiménez-Ruiz, Carlos A; Casanova Macario, Ciro",Int J Chron Obstruct Pulmon Dis,,692
464875,The use of interactive technologies and methods in online practical lessons in uzbekistan during covid-19 pandemic,2020,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a pandemic infection with profound effects on human society, has been emerged recently and rigorously challenged our ability to control viral infections. Although at the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, the epidemic seems controllable in Southern Iran, the disease presents a critical pattern as of May 2020. After a few months of COVID-19 emergence, in a twisted turn of events, the severity and mortality of COVID-19 increased dramatically. It has been proposed that the antibodies obtained from previous exposure to local circulating human coronaviruses or possibly SARS-CoV-2 might contribute to the development of more severe and lethal presentations of COVID-19 possibly by triggering antibody-dependent enhancement. The binding of virions complexed with antibodies to FcÎ³ receptors on the target cells initiates receptor-mediated signaling events leading to enhanced expression of inflammatory cytokines and suppression of intracellular antiviral responses at the transcriptomic level, followed by endocytosis of the virus and subsequent activation of immune cells. The activated immune cells might accumulate in the lung and promote cytokine storm and lymphopenia. Furthermore, the formation of immune complexes can promote complement activation and subsequent tissue damage. Although there are currently no clinical data to support this hypothesis, a better understanding of these immunopathologic phenomena and their relation to disease course and severity might give insight into the development of the most efficient prophylactic and therapeutic approaches. This review demonstrates the critical pattern of COVID-19 in Southern Iran and highlights the possible interplaying factors leading to this condition.","Farshadpour, Fatemeh; Taherkhani, Reza",,,692

The survey carried out in August 2020 in the three largest cities of the state of Odisha, India. Blood samples were collected from the residents using random sampling methods and tested for anti- SARS CoV-2 antibodies using an automated CLIA platform. A total of 4146 participants from the 3 cities of Bhubaneswar (BBS), Berhampur (BAM) and Rourkela (RKL) participated. The female to male participation ratio was 5.9:10 across the three cities. The gender weighted seroprevalence across the three cities was 20.78% (95% CI 19.56-22.05%). While females reported a higher seroprevalence (22.8%) as compared to males (18.8%), there was no significant difference in seroprevalence across age groups. A majority of the seropositive participants were asymptomatic (90.49%). The case to infection ratio on the date of serosurvey was 1:6.6 in BBS, 1:61 in BAM and 1:29.8 in RKL. The study found a high seroprevalence against COVID-19 in urban Odisha as well as high numbers of asymptomatic infections.

467325,Pragmatic Recommendations for the Use of Diagnostic Testing and Prognostic Models in Hospitalized Patients with Severe COVID-19 in Low- and Middle-Income Countries,2021,"Background A significant proportion of individuals experience lingering and debilitating symptoms following acute COVID-19 infection. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) have coined the persistent cluster of symptoms as post-COVID syndrome. This has been further sub-categorised into acute post-COVID syndrome for symptoms persisting three weeks beyond initial infection and chronic post-COVID syndrome for symptoms persisting beyond twelve weeks. The aim of this review was to detail the prevalence of clinical features and identify potential predictors for acute and chronic post-COVID syndrome. Methods A systematic literature search, with no language restrictions, was performed to identify studies detailing characteristics and outcomes related to survivorship of post-COVID syndrome. The last search was performed on 6 March 2021 and all pre-dating published articles included. A means of proportion meta-analysis was performed to quantify characteristics of acute and chronic post-COVID syndrome. Study quality was assessed with a specific risk of bias tool. PROSPERO Registration: CRD42020222855 Findings A total of 43 studies met the eligibility criteria;of which, 38 allowed for meta-analysis. Fatigue and dyspnoea were the most prevalent symptoms in acute post-COVID (0·37 and 0·35) and fatigue and sleep disturbance in chronic post-COVID syndrome (0·48 and 0·44), respectively. The available evidence is generally of poor quality, with considerable risk of bias, and are of observational design. Interpretation In conclusion, this review highlights that flaws in data capture and interpretation, noted in the uncertainty within our meta-analysis, affect the applicability of current knowledge. Policy makers and researchers must focus on understanding the impact of this condition on individuals and society with appropriate funding initiatives and global collaborative research.","Iqbal, Fahad M.; Lam, Kyle Sounderajah Viknesh Clarke Jonathan M.; Ashrafian, Hutan Darzi Ara",EClinicalMedicine,,692

467845,One size does not fit all - Patterns of vulnerability and resilience in the COVID-19 pandemic and why heterogeneity of disease matters,2020,"In this paper, we investigate the relationship between adverse economic circumstances and the desire of Dutch households to move up or down the urban hierarchy. We apply three consecutive waves of the Dutch Housing Demand Survey (WoON) in a repeated cross-section setting, with data collected at the time of the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) and its aftermath. We find that households desire to move down the urban hierarchy during the volatile and uncertain periods following the GFC. This is a surprising result, given that urban areas are generally considered more opportunity rich. In order to uncover the mechanisms driving this result, we considered the impact of the economic circumstances on the general willingness to move and on the underlying motives. We find that willingness to move increased when the adverse economic consequences of the GFC hit Dutch households. Further, it appears that this willingness to move is only partially related to work. Besides work, desires to move for health, education, vicinity to family and friends, and reasons related to the dwelling, also become more prevalent during the aftermath of the GFC as well. This heterogeneity in impacts and consequences for household desired mobility serves to explain some of the mixed results in the literature, and generates lessons for current and future crises such as the Covid-19 pandemic.","van Leeuwen, Eveline S; Venhorst, Viktor A",J Geogr Syst,,692

This document is for CDC country offices, ministries of health, sub-national public health authorities, and other implementing partners in non-US settings While select adaptations may be relevant for any jurisdiction, the document focuses on adaptations that might be especially useful in low- and middle-income countries Document Rationale Contact tracing is a key component of controlling transmission of infectious diseases Contact tracing for the current COVID-19 pandemic however, is distinct from that undertaken for other diseases (e g , Ebola, HIV, TB) because in nearly all countries the number of cases and contacts has outpaced the capacity of the public health system to quickly notify and quarantine all contacts and isolate all cases As a result, contact tracing programs will need to prioritize activities to ensure that human and financial resources are utilized most effectively Necessary adaptations will depend not only on setting, but also will need to adapt over time, to best suit the current epidemiology of the outbreak Measures that are feasible when there is one case or even one cluster of cases, may not be feasible once hundreds or thousands of new cases are reported a day The following document outlines considerations for modifying contact tracing protocols to maximize efficient use of limited resources Within the following document, these adaptations are grouped into the following four categories: Workforce Adaptations (i e , who will do the case investigations and contact tracing) à Ideally existing staff from the public health agency in country (e g , Ministry of Health, National Centers for Disease Control, Field Epidemiology Training Program) would be able to implement these efforts This document will review ways to build the workforce if this is not feasible with current staff Epidemiologic Adaptations (e g , which contacts will be followed) à Ideally all cases will be investigated, all contacts will be listed, and then all contacts will be quarantined and monitored for 14 days after last exposure to a potentially infectious person This document will review how to prioritize activities and contacts if this is not feasible System Adaptations (e g , how will cases and contacts be notified and monitored) à Ideally all cases and contacts will be contacted directly by public health officers, either in person or by phone This document will review ways to improve the process if this is not feasible Financial, Logistical, and Operational Adaptations (e g , what resources will be available to support the system designed) à Ideally, financial, human, and logistical resources for contact tracing would be sufficient to meet the need This document reviews how to adapt when these resources are limited These adaptations however have trade-offs In some settings and under some circumstances, contact tracing may not be sufficient to contain transmission This is particularly true in settings of widespread community transmission, and of particular concern for this pandemic given the role of asymptomatic transmission In such as context, national or sub-national stay-at-home orders may need to be reissued, such that the whole population will be asked to quarantine (except for essential workers) The CDC COVIDTracer is a useful tool to determine modeled trajectory of COVID-19 cases under different contact tracing scale-up scenarios, to help determine an appropriate scale-up of contact tracing efforts Contact tracing is the focus of this document However, contact tracing programs cannot operate in isolation Contact tracing works to help contain an outbreak when integrated into a robust response that includes implementation of community mitigation measures (including but not limited to maintaining physical distancing in public places, limiting outings, avoiding large gatherings, wearing cloth face coverings, washing hands often, and cleaning high-touch surfaces routinely), as well as isolation of cases and testing","Prevention, Centers for Disease Control and",,,692

Frustrated by not being able to directly care for patients, medical students across the country formed diverse volunteer initiatives to help frontline clinicians. In this article, the authors describe the essential role of medical students at Weill Cornell Medicine in quickly designing and building a large registry of COVID-19 patients who presented at 3 New York City hospitals. The Cornell COVID-19 registry, which contains granular clinical information on more than 4,000 patients, informed hospital operations and guided clinical management during the first wave of the pandemic. One month after its creation, the registry led to the first published description of the clinical characteristics of a U.S.-based cohort of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Using their experience as a model, the authors propose that students who cannot participate in their clinical clerkships because of the pandemic can augment their traditional medical education by contributing to COVID-19 research. In the case described in this article, students reviewed management of COVID-19 patients, followed inpatients throughout their hospitalization (much like students would on clinical rotations), and refined their interpersonal skills through discussions with patients and patients' families during follow-up calls. The authors conclude that medical students who are displaced from their hospital rotations can further their education and provide an invaluable contribution to the fight against COVID-19 by serving as essential frontline researchers.","Alshak, Mark N; Li, Han A; Wehmeyer, Graham T",Acad. med,,692

The quarantine is a successful measure to reduce the virus’s spread through physical and social distancing, but it can also have negative psychological consequences on the population. People experience high levels of worry and anxiety and have to cope with the consequences of the health emergency. The aim of this study was to preliminarily assess the causal relations among coping, worry and state anxiety at the time of COVID-19 first wave, and the mediation role of worry between coping and state anxiety. Methods: During March 2020, 1273 Italian citizens completed an ad-hoc online survey composed of socio-demographic and preoccupation-related questions, and standardized self-report questionnaire (Brief COPE, Penn State Worry Questionnaire and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-State form). Three separate mediation models were performed. Results: The relationship between coping strategies (i.e.: problem-focused coping, emotion-focused coping and dysfunctional coping) and state anxiety resulted to be mediated by worry. Dysfunctional and problem-focused coping had a negative effect on anxiety scores and this effect was amplified by high levels of worry. Emotion-focused coping reduced state anxiety scores through its effect on reducing the levels of worry, which in turn was related to a reduction in anxiety. Conclusion: The present study offers first evidence for the mediation role of worry in the relation between coping and anxiety during quarantine caused by COVID-19 pandemic. It supports the clinical importance of investigating people’s coping strategies along with the levels of (cognitive) worry and their long-term effects on the psychological well-being during the outbreak, in order to deliver adequate personalized interventions. Psychological support should enhance emotion-focused coping strategies that have a protective effect on both worry and anxiety.

At 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months after administration, analysis of bosutinib C0 and creatinine was performed at the same time of day. Significant correlations were observed between bosutinib C0 and the change rate of serum creatinine or the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR; r = 0.328, P < 0.001 and r = - 0.315, P < 0.001, respectively). These correlations were particularly high in patients having the SLC22A2 808G/G genotype (r = 0.345 and r = - 0.329, respectively); however, in patients having the 808T allele, there were no significant differences. In multivariate analyses, the SLC22A2 808G/G genotype, patient age, bosutinib C0 and second-line or later bosutinib were independent factors influencing the change rate of creatinine. Bosutinib elevated serum creatinine through organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2). We observed a 20% increase in serum creatinine with a median bosutinib C0 of 63.4-73.2 ng/mL. Periodic measurement of serum creatinine after bosutinib therapy is necessary to avoid progression to severe renal dysfunction from simple elevation of creatinine mediated by OCT2 following bosutinib treatment.","Abumiya, Maiko; Takahashi, Naoto; Takahashi, Saori; Yoshioka, Tomoko; Kameoka, Yoshihiro; Miura, Masatomo",Sci Rep,,692

We introduced an exercise programme with the aim of increasing minutes of physical activity per week. Secondary outcome measures were weight, mood and energy levels.This project took place in the context of COVID-19 restrictions having reduced opportunities for off-ward activity and staff noting subsequent deconditioning and weight gain amongst the patient cohort. Cohort consisted largely of patients with a severe mental illness, many of whom had physical health co-mobridities.MethodThis project included all patients in the 16-bedded unit.Baseline data were collected prior to programme introduction, including weekly activity levels and weights. A questionnaire explored patient confidence and attitude towards physical activity.Focus groups were held with patients and staff in order to identify how best to introduce the programme, discuss content, and identify potential barriers.We introduced an eight-week programme of weekly, thirty-minute, mixed ability exercise sessions. These were led collectively by the multi-disciplinary team. Patients actively participated in programme design;choosing session soundtracks and contributing to content planning.Likert scales were used to measure self-report mood and energy levels pre- and post-session. Staff engaged in a weekly post session de-brief, where challenges were identified and solutions suggested. Weekly qualitative feedback was sought from participants. The sessions were thus developed and adapted according to patient and staff feedback over the programme's course.Following the 8-week programme, activity levels and weight were re-measured and compared to baseline. Pre-programme questionnaires were also repeated.ResultPatients reported increased enjoyment and confidence engaging in physical activity, as well as improved overall self- confidence and a sense of pride and ownership of the sessions.Staff reported a more cohesive team environment, greater sense of work-place fulfilment and improved therapeutic relationships.Comparing pre and post session ten-point-Likert scales showed a 153% mean increase in self-rated energy levels and a 98% mean increase in self-rated mood. This reflected a mean score increase of 3.8 in both.Minutes of physical activity per week increased for all session participants, although remained below national guidance.Weight reduction did not occur.ConclusionExercise benefits not only physical health, but also emotional and psychological well-being. This project demonstrates how introduction of a weekly ward-based exercise class can offer this as well as improving working environment, team cohesion and therapeutic relationships. Weight reduction may be observed in the longer term.","Rowland, Ruth Somerville Laura Dorman Sarah Finnerty Mark",BJPsych Open,,692

The aim of this review was to summarize the prevalence and the range of neurological manifestations associated with COVID-19, and to expose the main hypotheses about the pathogenic pathways based on available neuropathological studies. Methods: Articles have been identified by searches of PubMed and Google scholar up to November 15, 2020, using a combination of COVID-19 and neurology search terms and adding relevant references in the articles. Results: Nonspecific neurological symptoms such as headache, dizziness, pain and myalgia, have been reported in 2 to 30% of COVID-19 hospitalized patients. More severe neurological diseases affected 8 to 13% of COVID-19 hospitalized patients including various central or peripheral manifestations. Among central nervous system involvement, encephalopathy and cerebrovascular disease – especially ischemic stroke - were the most frequent, followed by encephalitis, myelitis, meningitis, and posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome. Guillain-Barré syndrome and variants were the most common form of peripheral nervous system involvement, followed by critical illness neuromyopathy, plexopathy, polyneuropathy, oculomotor neuropathy, and Tapia syndrome. Encephalopathy, ischemic stroke and encephalitis occurred 6 to 12 days in median after the first signs of COVID-19, while Guillain-Barré syndrome occured later, at 15 to 23 days in median. Taste and smell disorders affected 34 to 86% of patients and occurred 3.5 days in median after the onset of infection. Pathogenic pathways of nervous system involvement in COVID-19 remain poorly understood. Neuropathological studies highlighted the possible role of sepsis and hypoxia, endothelial infection / dysfunction, inflammation and immune-mediated disease. While the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the brain was confirmed in some COVID-19 patients, there were no definite evidence to support its direct pathogenicity on brain parenchyma. Conclusion: Neurological involvement in COVID-19 is frequent and include various manifestations. Most of them are encephalopathies and strokes, probably linked to viral sepsis, hypoxia and/or endotheliitis. A wide range of post infectious disorders were also reported, such as encephalitis and Guillain-Barré syndrome. To date no studies demonstrated definite evidence of a direct pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 on brain.","Meppiel, Elodie; Broucker, Thomas De",,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1878776221000315?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1878776221000315,692

It interacts with pathogenic moieties, infected and dying host cells and facilitates their removal through activation of appropriate innate and adaptive mechanisms. PTX3 is secreted by a diverse variety of cells, ranging from immune cells to structural cells, in response to Toll like receptor (TLR) engagement, inflammatory stimuli, and physical and chemical stress. Further, PTX3 plays an essential role in female fertility as it facilitates the organization of extracellular matrix in the cumulus oophorus. Such activity is also implicated in post-inflammation tissue repair. PTX3 is a multifunctional protein and plays a non-redundant role in providing immunity against potential immunological dangers. Thus, we assessed its role in lung immunity, as lungs are at a constant risk of infections and tissue damage that is attributable to perpetual exposure to foreign agents.","Balhara, Jyoti; Koussih, Latifa; Zhang, Jingbo; Gounni, Abdelilah Soussi",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23755050/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2013.00127,692

During December 2019, a series of pneumonia cases caused by a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak was identified in Wuhan, Hubei, China, and rapidly spread across the world. The spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 disease (COVID 19) varies from asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic forms to clinical conditions characterized by respiratory failure that necessitate mechanical ventilation and support in an intensive care unit (ICU), multiorgan and systemic manifestations, and, in terms of sepsis, septic shock, and multiple organ dysfunction syndromes (MODS) (2). Whilst many reports have characterized the clinical, epidemiological, laboratory, and radiological features, as well as treatment and clinical outcomes of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, information on SARS-CoV-2 reactivation remains unreported. Curative and eradicative therapy for COVID-19 is not currently available (3).

However, compliance with these guidelines has been inconsistent. This correlational study examined whether individual differences in risky decision-making and motivational propensities predicted compliance with COVID-19 preventative behaviors in a sample of US adults (N = 404). Participants completed an online study from September through December 2020 that included a risky choice decision-making task, temporal discounting task, and measures of appropriate mask-wearing, social distancing, and perceived risk of engaging in public activities. Linear regression results indicated that greater temporal discounting and risky decision-making were associated with less appropriate mask-wearing behavior and social distancing. Additionally, demographic factors, including personal experience with COVID-19 and financial difficulties due to COVID-19, were also associated with differences in COVID-19 preventative behaviors. Path analysis results showed that risky decision-making behavior, temporal discounting, and risk perception collectively predicted 55% of the variance in appropriate mask-wearing behavior. Individual differences in general decision-making patterns are therefore highly predictive of who complies with COVID-19 prevention guidelines.","Byrne, Kaileigh A.; Six, Stephanie G.; Anaraky, Reza Ghaiumy; Harris, Maggie W.; Winterlind, Emma L.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33983970/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0251073,692

Surgical mouth mask harboring hazardous microorganisms in dental practice,2020-02-28,"Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is an enteric coronavirus causing high morbidity and mortality in porcine herds worldwide. Although both inactivated and live attenuated vaccines have been extensively used, the emergence of highly virulent strains and the recurrent outbreaks even in vaccinated farms highlight the need of effective vaccines. Engineering of genetically defined live attenuated vaccines is a rational approach for novel vaccine development. In this line, we engineered an attenuated virus based on the transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) genome, expressing a chimeric spike protein from a virulent United States (US) PEDV strain. This virus (rTGEV-RS-SPEDV) was attenuated in highly-sensitive five-day-old piglets, as infected animals did not lose weight and none of them died. In addition, the virus caused very minor tissue damage compared with a virulent virus. The rTGEV-RS-SPEDV vaccine candidate was also attenuated in three-week-old animals that were used to evaluate the protection conferred by this virus, compared with the protection induced by infection with a virulent PEDV US strain (PEDV-NVSL). The rTGEV-RS-SPEDV virus protected against challenge with a virulent PEDV strain, reducing challenge virus titers in jejunum and leading to undetectable challenge virus RNA levels in feces. The rTGEV-RS-SPEDV virus induced a humoral immune response specific for PEDV, including neutralizing antibodies. Altogether, the data indicated that rTGEV-RS-SPEDV is a promising vaccine candidate against virulent PEDV infection.","Pascual-Iglesias, Alejandro; Sanchez, Carlos M.; Penzes, Zoltan; Sola, Isabel; Enjuanes, Luis; Zuñiga, Sonia",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31349683/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v11080682,692

EBV can directly cause infectious mononucleosis and is also associated with various malignancies and autoimmune diseases. In order to prevent primary infection and subsequent chronic disease, efforts have been made to develop a prophylactic vaccine against EBV in recent years, but there is still no vaccine in clinical use. The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and the global cooperation in vaccine development against SARS-CoV-2 provide insights for next-generation antiviral vaccine design and opportunities for developing an effective prophylactic EBV vaccine. With improvements in antigen selection, vaccine platforms, formulation and evaluation systems, novel vaccines against EBV are expected to elicit dual protection against infection of both B lymphocytes and epithelial cells.

617289,Covid-19 - The Infodemic,2020-10-30,"Understanding ozone (O(3)) formation regime is a prerequisite in formulating an effective O(3) pollution control strategy. Photochemical indicator is a simple and direct method in identifying O(3) formation regimes. Most used indicators are derived from observations, whereas the role of atmospheric oxidation is not in consideration, which is the core driver of O(3) formation. Thus, it may impact accuracy in signaling O(3) formation regimes. In this study, an advanced three-dimensional numerical modeling system was used to investigate the relationship between atmospheric oxidation and O(3) formation regimes during a long-lasting O(3) exceedance event in September 2017 over the Pearl River Delta (PRD) of China. We discovered a clear relationship between atmospheric oxidative capacity and O(3) formation regime. Over eastern PRD, O(3) formation was mainly in a NO(x)-limited regime when HO(2)/OH ratio was higher than 11, while in a VOC-limited regime when the ratio was lower than 9.5. Over central and western PRD, an HO(2)/OH ratio higher than 5 and lower than 2 was indicative of NO(x)-limited and VOC-limited regime, respectively. Physical contribution, including horizontal transport and vertical transport, may pose uncertainties on the indication of O(3) formation regime by HO(2)/OH ratio. In comparison with other commonly used photochemical indicators, HO(2)/OH ratio had the best performance in differentiating O(3) formation regimes. This study highlighted the necessities in using an atmospheric oxidative capacity-based indicator to infer O(3) formation regime, and underscored the importance of characterizing behaviors of radicals to gain insight in atmospheric processes leading to O(3) pollution over a photochemically active region.","Zhao, Kaihui; Luo, Huihong; Yuan, Zibing; Xu, Danni; Du, Yi; Zhang, Shu; Hao, Yuqi; Wu, Yonghua; Huang, Jianping; Wang, Ying; Jiang, Rongsheng",J Environ Sci (China),https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jes.2020.09.038; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33637263/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1001074220304083; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1001074220304083,692

(2) To compare outcomes from HUSH with outcomes from a historical control group which received the same program in-person. METHODS: Two-group quasi-experimental design using both within- and between-group analyses with 78 study participants, 26 in the within-group and 52 in the between-group analyses. Spouse caregivers were eligible if the wife was diagnosed within 8 months with stage 0–III breast cancer and were English-speaking. After obtaining signed informed consent and baseline data, 5 fully scripted telephone intervention sessions were delivered at 2-week intervals by patient educators. Spouses and diagnosed wives were assessed on standardized measures of adjustment at baseline and immediately after the final intervention session. RESULTS: Within-group analyses revealed that spouses and wives in HUSH significantly improved on depressed mood and anxiety; spouses improved on self-efficacy and their skills in supporting their wife. Additionally, wives’ appraisal of spousal support significantly improved. Between-group analyses revealed that outcomes from HUSH were comparable or larger in magnitude to outcomes achieved by the in-person delivered program. CONCLUSIONS: A manualized telephone-delivered intervention given directly to spouse caregivers can potentially improve adjustment in both spouses and diagnosed wives but study outcomes must be interpreted with caution.

Most common symptoms in our overall cohort were fever (80.8%), cough (79.8%), headache (66%), dyspnea (71.1%), myalgia (53.8%), joints pain (50.8%) and odynophagia (34.8%). Diarrhea was the main gastrointestinal (GI) symptom (21.3%), followed by abdominal pain (18%), and nausea/ vomiting (4.5%). Diarrhea and abdominal pain were more common in West (23.1 and 21%), followed by Southeast (17.8, and 9.8%) and Northwest (11.4 and 3.1%). CONCLUSION: Our study showed a high mortality rate likely related to high frequencies of comorbidities (hypertension, obesity and diabetes). Mortality was different across regions. These discrepancies might be related to the differences in the frequencies of comorbidities, and partially attributed to differences in socio-economic conditions and quality of care. Thus, our findings stress the need for improved strategies to get better outcomes in our population.

An accurate prognostic assessment is necessary to improve survival of patients, especially in developing countries. This study proposes to predict the risk of developing critical conditions in COVID-19 patients by training multipurpose algorithms. We followed a total of 1040 patients with a positive RT-PCR diagnosis for COVID-19 from a large hospital from São Paulo, Brazil, from March to June 2020, of which 288 (28%) presented a severe prognosis, i.e. Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission, use of mechanical ventilation or death. We used routinely-collected laboratory, clinical and demographic data to train five machine learning algorithms (artificial neural networks, extra trees, random forests, catboost, and extreme gradient boosting). We used a random sample of 70% of patients to train the algorithms and 30% were left for performance assessment, simulating new unseen data. In order to assess if the algorithms could capture general severe prognostic patterns, each model was trained by combining two out of three outcomes to predict the other. All algorithms presented very high predictive performance (average AUROC of 0.92, sensitivity of 0.92, and specificity of 0.82). The three most important variables for the multipurpose algorithms were ratio of lymphocyte per C-reactive protein, C-reactive protein and Braden Scale. The results highlight the possibility that machine learning algorithms are able to predict unspecific negative COVID-19 outcomes from routinely-collected data.","Fernandes, Fernando Timoteo; de Oliveira, Tiago Almeida; Teixeira, Cristiane Esteves; Batista, Andre Filipe de Moraes; Dalla Costa, Gabriel; Chiavegatto Filho, Alexandre Dias Porto",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33558602/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-82885-y,692

The ID NOW COVID-19 assay is a simple, user-friendly, rapid molecular biology test based on nicking and extension amplification reaction (NEAR). Objectives : The aim of this study was to evaluate the ID NOW COVID-19 assay when used as a point-of-care test (POCT) in our Emergency Department (ED). Type of study : This prospective study enrolled 395 consecutive patients; paired nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from each study participant. The first swab was tested with the ID NOW COVID-19 assay at the point-of-care by ED nurses. The second swab was diluted in viral transport medium (VTM) and sent to the clinical microbiology department for analysis by both the RT-PCR Simplexa test COVID-19 Direct assay as the study reference method, and the ID NOW COVID-19 assay performed in the laboratory. Results : Nasopharyngeal swabs directly tested with the ID NOW COVID-19 assay yielded a sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of 98.0%, 97.5%, 96.2% and 98.7%, respectively, in comparison with the RT-PCR study reference assay. When the ID NOW COVID-19 assay was performed in the laboratory using the VTM samples, the sensitivity decreased to 62.5% and the NPV to 79.7%. Three false negative test results were reported with the ID NOW COVID-19 assay when performed using undiluted swabs directly in the ED; these results were obtained from patients with elevated CT values (>30).

It is important to establish a process of psychological assessment and interventions for healthcare workers affected by epidemics. OBJECTIVE We investigated the risk factors associated with the psychological impact of each healthcare worker group, to help optimize psychological interventions for healthcare workers in countries affected by COVID-19. METHODS Participants (N = 1,787) from two hospitals in Korea, completed an online survey from April 14 to 30, 2020, by obtaining information on demographics, psychiatric history and the Stress and Anxiety to Viral Epidemics-9 (SAVE-9), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) scales. Logistic regression analyses were performed to assess contributing factors as predictor variables and healthcare workers' depression as outcome variables. RESULTS Among the 1,783 healthcare workers, compared with other healthcare workers, nursing professionals had significantly higher levels of depression (PHQ-9 score; 5.5 ± 4.6 vs. 3.8 ± 4.2; P < .01), general anxiety (GAD-7 score; 4.0 ± 4.1 vs. 2.7 ± 3.6; P < .01), and virus-related anxiety symptoms (SAVE-9 score; 21.6 ± 5.9 vs. 18.6 ± 6.3; P < .01). In the nursing professionals group, single workers reported more severe depressive symptoms than married workers (PHQ-9 score ≥ 10; 20.3% vs. 14.1%; P < .01), and junior (<40 years) workers reported more anxiety about the viral epidemic (SAVE-9 anxiety score; 15.6 ± 4.1 vs. 14.7 ± 4.4; P < .01). Logistic regression analysis revealed that the hospital factor (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.45, 95% confidence interval, CI [1.06-1.99]), nursing professionals (aOR = 1.37, 95% CI [1.02-1.98]), single workers (aOR = 1.51, 95% CI [1.05-2.16]), higher stress and anxiety to the viral infection (high SAVE-9 score, aOR = 1.20, 95% CI [1.17-1.24]), and past psychiatric history (aOR = 3.26, 95% CI [2.15-4.96]) were positively associated with depression. CONCLUSIONS Psychological support and interventions should be considered for healthcare workers, especially nursing professionals, those who are single, and those with high SAVE-9 level.

636521,The double burden of diabetes and global infection in low and middle-income countries,2018-12-04,"Underestimation of the number of cases during the COVID-19 pandemic has been a constant concern worldwide. Case confirmation is based on identification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA using real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in clinical samples. However, these tests have suboptimal sensitivity, especially during the early and late course of infection. Using open data, we estimated that among 1 343 730 people tested in Mexico since February 27th, there were 838 377 (95% CL 734 605 - 1 057 164) cases, compared with 604 376 considering only positive tests. ICU admissions and deaths were around 16% and 9% higher than reported. Thus, we show that accounting for the sensitivity of SARS-Cov-2 RT-PCR diagnostic tests is a simple way to improve estimations for the true number of COVID-19 cases in tested people, particularly in high-prevalence populations. This could aid to better inform public health measures and reopening policies.","NÃºÃ±ez, Isaac J.; BelaunzarÃ¡n-Zamudio, Pablo F.; Caro-Vega, Yanink",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.17.20197038; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.17.20197038v1?rss=1,692
636603,Masks in COVID-19 pandemic: Are we doing it right?,2020-10-30,"Despite the fact that non-viral nucleic acid delivery systems are generally considered to be less efficient than viral vectors, they have gained much interest in recent years due to their superior safety profile compared to their viral counterpart. Among these synthetic vectors are cationic polymers, branched dendrimers, cationic liposomes and cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs). The latter represent an assortment of fairly unrelated sequences essentially characterised by a high content of basic amino acids and a length of 10–30 residues. CPPs are capable of mediating the cellular uptake of hydrophilic macromolecules like peptides and nucleic acids (e.g. siRNAs, aptamers and antisense-oligonucleotides), which are internalised by cells at a very low rate when applied alone. Up to now, numerous sequences have been reported to show cell-penetrating properties and many of them have been used to successfully transport a variety of different cargos into mammalian cells. In recent years, it has become apparent that endocytosis is a major route of internalisation even though the mechanisms underlying the cellular translocation of CPPs are poorly understood and still subject to controversial discussions. In this review, we will summarise the latest developments in peptide-based cellular delivery of nucleic acid cargos. We will discuss different mechanisms of entry, the intracellular fate of the cargo, correlation studies of uptake versus biological activity of the cargo as well as technical problems and pitfalls.","Veldhoen, Sandra; Laufer, Sandra D.; Restle, Tobias",Int J Mol Sci,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms9071276; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19325804/,692

Unmasking the positives from the COVID-19 pandemic,2021-02-26,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is a worldwide pandemic and has placed significant demand for acute and critical care services on hospitals in many countries. OBJECTIVES: To determine the predictors of severe COVID-19 disease requiring admission to an ICU by comparing patients who were ICU admitted to non-ICU groups. METHODS: A cohort study was conducted for the laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients who were admitted to six Saudi Ministry of Health’s hospitals in Alahsa, between March 1, 2020, and July 30, 2020, by reviewing patient’s medical records retrospectively. RESULTS: This cohort included 1014 patients with an overall mean age of 47.2 ± 19.3 years and 582 (57%) were males. A total of 205 (20%) of the hospitalized patients were admitted to the ICU. Hypertension, diabetes and obesity were the most common comorbidities in all study patients (27.2, 19.9, and 9%, respectively). The most prevalent symptoms were cough (47.7%), shortness of breath (35.7%) and fever (34.3%). Compared with non-ICU group, ICU patients had older age (p ≤ 0.0005) and comprised a higher proportion of the current smokers and had higher respiratory rates (p ≤ 0.0005), and more percentage of body temperatures in the range of 37.3–38.0 °C (p ≥ 0.0005); and had more comorbidities including diabetes (p ≤ 0.0005), hypertension (p ≥ 0.0005), obesity (p = 0.048), and sickle cell disease (p = 0.039). There were significant differences between the non-ICU and ICU groups for fever, shortness of breath, cough, fatigue, vomiting, dizziness; elevated white blood cells, neutrophils, alanine aminotransferase and alkaline aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, and ferritin, and decreased hemoglobin; and proportion of abnormal bilateral chest CT images (p < 0.05). Significant differences were also found for multiple treatments (p < 0.05). ICU patients group had a much higher mortality rate than those with non-ICU admission (p ≤ 0.0005). CONCLUSION: Identifying key clinical characteristics of COVID-19 that predict ICU admission and high mortality can be useful for frontline healthcare providers in making the right clinical decision under time-sensitive and resource-constricted environment.","Alhumaid, Saad; Al Mutair, Abbas; Al Alawi, Zainab; Al Salman, Khulud; Al Dossary, Nourah; Omar, Ahmed; Alismail, Mossa; Al Ghazal, Ali M.; Jubarah, Mahdi Bu; Al Shaikh, Hanan; Al Mahdi, Maher M.; Alsabati, Sarah Y.; Philip, Dayas K.; Alyousef, Mohammed Y.; Al Brahim, Abdulsatar H.; Al Athan, Maitham S.; Alomran, Salamah A.; Ahmed, Hatim S.; Al-Shammari, Haifa; Elhazmi, Alyaa; Rabaan, Ali A.; Al-Tawfiq, Jaffar A.; Al-Omari, Awad",Eur J Med Res,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40001-021-00517-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34030733/,692

An analytical descriptive retrospective study,2020-11-30,"The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism of interaction between quercetin-3-O-sophoroside and different SARS-CoV-2's proteins which can bring some useful details about the control of different variants of coronavirus including the recent case, Delta. The chemical structure of the quercetin-3-O-sophoroside was first optimized. Docking studies were performed by CoV disease-2019 (COVID-19) Docking Server. Afterwards, the molecular dynamic study was done using High Throughput Molecular Dynamics (HTMD) tool. The results showed a remarkable stability of the quercetin-3-O-sophoroside based on the calculated parameters. Docking outcomes revealed that the highest affinity of quercetin-3-O-sophoroside was related to the RdRp with RNA. Molecular dynamic studies showed that the target E protein tends to be destabilized in the presence of quercetin-3-O- sophoroside. Based on these results, quercetin-3-O- sophoroside can show promising inhibitory effects on the binding site of the different receptors and may be considered as effective inhibitor of the entry and proliferation of the SARS-CoV-2 and its different variants. Finally, it should be noted, although this paper does not directly deal with the exploring the interaction of main proteins of SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant with quercetin-3-O-sophoroside, at the time of writing, no direct theoretical investigation was reported on the interaction of ligands with the main proteins of Delta variant and the present data may provide useful information for designing some theoretical studies in the future for studying the control of SARS-CoV-2 variants due to possible structural similarity between proteins of different variants.","Khan, Suliman; Hussain, Arif; Vahdani, Yasaman; Kooshki, Hamideh; Mahmud Hussen, Bashdar; Haghighat, Setareh; Fatih Rasul, Mohammed; Jamal Hidayat, Hazha; Hasan, Anwarul; Edis, Zehra; Haj Bloukh, Samir; Kasravi, Shahab; Mahdi Nejadi Babadaei, Mohammad; Sharifi, Majid; Bai, Qian; Liu, Jianbo; Hu, Bowen; Akhtari, Keivan; Falahati, Mojtaba",Arabian Journal of Chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arabjc.2021.103353; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1878535221003683; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1878535221003683?v=s5,692

Given the operational limitations of many school districts, more data is needed to determine what mitigation is required to keep COVID‐19 transmission low during bus transport. METHODS: An independent school in Virginia monitored 1154 students in grades 1 to 12 with asymptomatic PCR testing every 2 weeks from August 24, 2020 to March 19, 2021, during the highest community transmission. Fifteen buses served 462 students while operating at near capacity of 2 students in every seat, using a physical distancing minimum of 2.5 ft, universal masking, and simple ventilation techniques. RESULTS: A total of 39 individuals were present on buses during their COVID‐19 infectious period, which resulted in the quarantine of 52 students. Universal testing and contact tracing revealed no transmission linked to bus transportation. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates a model for the safe operation of school buses while near capacity.

658666,Zika virus: An overview,2016,"The seasonality of influenza viruses and endemic human coronaviruses was tracked over an 8-year period to assess key epidemiologic reduction points in disease incidence for an urban area in the northeast United States. Patients admitted to a pediatric hospital with worsening respiratory symptoms were tested using a multiplex PCR assay from nasopharyngeal swabs. The additive seasonal effects of outdoor temperatures and indoor relative humidity (RH) were evaluated. The 8-year average peak activity of human coronaviruses occurred in the first week of January, when droplet and contact transmission was enabled by the low indoor RH of 20-30%. Previous studies have shown that an increase in RH to 50% has been associated with markedly reduced viability and transmission of influenza virus and animal coronaviruses. As disease incidence was reduced by 50% in early March, to 75% in early April, to greater than 99% at the end of April, a relationship was observed from colder temperatures in January with a low indoor RH to a gradual increase in outdoor temperatures in April with an indoor RH of 45-50%. As a lipid-bound, enveloped virus with similar size characteristics to endemic human coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 should be subject to the same dynamics of reduced viability and transmission with increased humidity. In addition to the major role of social distancing, the transition from lower to higher indoor RH with increasing outdoor temperatures could have an additive effect on the decrease in SARS-CoV-2 cases in May. Over the 8-year period of this study, human coronavirus activity was either zero or >99% reduction in the months of June through September, and the implication would be that SARS-Cov-2 may follow a similar pattern.","Evangelista, A.

IBD patient conditions and treatments, such as with immunosuppressants, may result in a higher risk of viral and bacterial infection and more severe outcomes of infections. The effect of the clinical and demographic factors on the prognosis of COVID-19 among IBD patients is still a significant area of investigation. The lack of available data on a large set of COVID-19 infected IBD patients has hindered progress. To circumvent this lack of large patient data, we present a random sampling approach to generate clinical COVID-19 outcomes (outpatient management, hospitalized and recovered, and hospitalized and deceased) on 20,000 IBD patients modeled on reported summary statistics obtained from the Surveillance Epidemiology of Coronavirus Under Research Exclusion (SECURE-IBD), an international database to monitor and report on outcomes of COVID-19 occurring in IBD patients. We apply machine learning approaches to perform a comprehensive analysis of the primary and secondary covariates to predict COVID-19 outcome in IBD patients. Our analysis reveals that age, medication usage and the number of comorbidities are the primary covariates, while IBD severity, smoking history, gender and IBD subtype (CD or UC) are key secondary features. In particular, elderly male patients with ulcerative colitis, several preexisting conditions, and who smoke comprise a highly vulnerable IBD population. Moreover, treatment with 5-ASAs (sulfasalazine/mesalamine) shows a high association with COVID-19/IBD mortality. Supervised machine learning that considers age, number of comorbidities and medication usage can predict COVID-19/IBD outcomes with approximately 70% accuracy. We explore the challenge of drawing demographic inferences from existing COVID-19/IBD data. Overall, there are fewer IBD case reports from US states with poor health ranking hindering these analyses. Generation of patient characteristics based on known summary statistics allows for increased power to detect IBD factors leading to variable COVID-19 outcomes. There is under-reporting of COVID-19 in IBD patients from US states with poor health ranking, underpinning the perils of using the repository to derive demographic information.","Roy, Satyaki; Sheikh, Shehzad Z.; Furey, Terrence S.",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34389789/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-95919-2,692

674104,Seroprevalence trends of Scrub typhus among the febrile patients of Northern India: A prospective cross-sectional study,2021-07-30,"INTRODUCTION: Surgeons in practice have limited opportunities to learn new techniques and procedures. Traditionally, in-person hands-on courses have been the most common means for surgeons to gain exposure to new techniques and procedures. The COVID19 pandemic caused a cessation in these courses and left surgeons with limited opportunities to continue their professional development. Thus, SAGES elected to create an innovative hands-on course that could be completed at home in order to provide surgeons with opportunities to learn new procedures during the pandemic. METHODS: This course was initially planned to be taught as an in-person hands-on course utilizing the Acquisition of Data for Outcomes and Procedure Transfer(ADOPT) method (1). We identified a virtual telementoring platform, Proximie Ltd(London, UK), and a company that could create a model of an abdominal wall in order to perform a Transversus Abdominis Release, KindHeart™(Chapel Hill, NC, USA). The course consisted of pre-course lectures and videos to be reviewed by participants, a pre-course call to set learning goals, the hands-on telementoring session from home, and monthly webinars for a year. RESULTS: The ADOPT hands-on hernia course at home was successfully completed on October 23rd of 2020. All participants and faculty were successfully able to set up their model and utilize the telementoring platform, but 15% required assistance. Post course-surveys showed that participants felt that the course was successful in meeting their educational goals and felt similar to prior in-person courses. CONCLUSIONS: SAGES was successfully able to transition and in-person hands-on course to a virtual at-home format. This innovative approach to continuing professional development will be necessary during the times of the COVID19 pandemic, but may be a helpful option for rural surgeons and others with travel restrictions in the future to continue their professional development without the need to travel away from their practice.","Greenberg, Jacob A.; Schwarz, Erin; Paige, John; Dort, Jonathan; Bachman, Sharon",Surg Endosc,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-021-08470-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33825008/,692
674408,The importance of wearing masks in curtailing the COVID-19 pandemic,2020-06-30,"Fevers of unknown origin have been classified as classic, nosocomial, immune-deficient, and HIV-related. More than half of the 1407 human pathogens are zoonotic, making zoonotic infections an important subcategory in each of the classifications. This article describes both common and unusual zoonoses causing fevers of unknown origin. Simian immune virus is considered as a possible emerging infection. For special populations (the homeless, zoophiliacs, those whose occupation or leisure brings them in close contact with oceans or lakes, and veterinarians), zoonotic infection potentials are discussed.","Cleri, Dennis J.; Ricketti, Anthony J.; Vernaleo, John R.",Infect Dis Clin North Am,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18061085/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0891552007000773; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0891552007000773,692
675169,Periodontal disease exacerbates hospitalisation,2021-08-27,"BACKGROUND: Workers and residents in Care Homes are considered at special risk for the acquisition of SARS-CoV-2 infection, due to the infectivity and high mortality rate in the case of residents, compared to other containment areas. The role of presymptomatic people in transmission has been shown to be important and the early detection of these people is critical for the control of new outbreaks. Pooling strategies have proven to preserve SARS-CoV-2 testing resources. The aims of the present study, based in our local experience, were (a) to describe SARS-CoV-2 prevalence in institutionalized people in Galicia (Spain) during the Coronavirus pandemic and (b) to evaluate the expected performance of a pooling strategy using RT-PCR for the next rounds of screening of institutionalized people. METHODS: A total of 25,386 Nasopharyngeal swab samples from the total of the residents and workers at Care Homes in Galicia (March to May 2020) were individually tested using RT-PCR. Prevalence and quantification cycle (Cq) value distribution of positives was calculated. Besides, 26 pools of 20 samples and 14 pools of 5 samples were tested using RT-PCR as well (1 positive/pool). Pooling proof of concept was performed in two populations with 1.7 and 2% prevalence. RESULTS: Distribution of SARS-CoV-2 infection at Care Homes was uneven (0–60%). As the virus circulation global rate was low in our area (3.32%), the number of people at risk of acquiring the infection continues to be very high. In this work, we have successfully demonstrated that pooling of different groups of samples at low prevalence clusters, can be done with a small average delay on Cq values (5 and 2.85 cycles for pools of 20 and 5 samples, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: A new screening system with guaranteed protection is required for small clusters, previously covered with individual testing. Our proposal for Care Homes, once prevalence zero is achieved, would include successive rounds of testing using a pooling solution for transmission control preserving testing resources. Scale-up of this method may be of utility to confront larger clusters to avoid the viral circulation and keeping them operative.","Cabrera Alvargonzalez, Jorge Julio; Rey Cao, Sonia; Pérez Castro, Sonia; Martinez Lamas, Lucía; Cores Calvo, Olaia; Torres Piñon, Julio; Porteiro Fresco, Jacobo; Garcia Comesaña, Julio; Regueiro Garcia, Benito",BMC Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-020-05446-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33046011/,692

In this study, the virus removal properties of mille‐feuille nanocellulose‐based filter papers of varying thicknesses from simulated waste water (SWW) matrix are evaluated for drinking water purification applications. Filtrations of standard SWW dispersions at various total suspended solid (TSS) content are performed, including spiking tests with 30 nm surrogate latex particles and 28 nm ΦX174 bacteriophages. Filter papers of thicknesses 9 and 29 µm are used, and the filtrations are performed at two different operational pressures, i.e., 1 and 3 bar. The presented data using SWW matrix show, for the first time, that a filter paper made from 100% nanocellulose has the capacity to efficiently remove even the smallest viruses, i.e., up to 99.9980–99.9995% efficiency, at industrially relevant flow rates, i.e., 60–500 L m(−2) h(−1), and low fouling, i.e., V (max) > 10(3)–10(4) L m(−2).

We prospectively studied 481 hospital HCWs in China, documented risk factors for infection, including performing HRPs, measured new infections, and analysed whether HRPs predicted infection. Infection outcomes were clinical respiratory infection (CRI), laboratory-confirmed viral or bacterial infection, and an influenza infection. About 12% (56/481) of the study participants performed at least one HRP, the most common being airway suctioning (7·7%, 37/481). HCWs who performed a HRP were at significantly higher risk of developing CRI and laboratory-confirmed infection [adjusted relative risk 2·9, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1·42–5·87 and 2·9, 95% CI 1·37–6·22, respectively]. Performing a HRP resulted in a threefold increase in the risk of respiratory infections. This is the first time the risk has been prospectively quantified in HCWs, providing data to inform occupational health and safety policies.","MACINTYRE, C.

The secondary objective was to evaluate whether the mental health awareness video was feasible in professional football. METHODS: A quasi-experimental study based on a one-group pretest post-test was conducted using a questionnaire. Attitude, help-seeking behaviours and confidence were measured with validated questionnaires, including the Attitudes Toward Seeking Professional Psychological Help-Short Form (ATSPPH-SF) and General Help-Seeking Questionnaire (GHSQ). RESULTS: Sixty-five professional footballers (63% men; 37% women) were enrolled in the study. The mean ATSPPH-SF score was 18.1 at pretest and 19.4 at post-test (p=0.00). The mean GHSQ score was 47.6 at pretest and 48.9 at post-test (p=0.00). The level of confidence in helping someone experiencing mental health symptoms was 11.1 at pretest and 11.7 at post-test (p=0.00). All participants rated the mental health awareness video as relevant; 88% mentioned that it added value to raise awareness about mental health symptoms and disorders in professional football. Eighty-three per cent rated the design positively, 69% were positive about the duration of the video and 88% of participants reported an increase in their knowledge and understanding of mental health symptoms and disorders in professional football. CONCLUSION: The mental health awareness video led to a better attitude of professional footballers towards mental health. We recommend the mental health awareness video be implemented in professional football to disseminate essential information related to mental health symptoms in professional football.","Confectioner, Kaizeen; Currie, Alan; Gabana, Nicolle; van Gerven, Nienke; Kerkhoffs, Gino M M J; Gouttebarge, Vincent",BMJ Open Sport Exerc Med,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjsem-2021-001070; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34055385/,692
681776,Prophylactic dressings in the prevention of pressure ulcer related to the use of personal protective equipment by health professionals facing the COVID‐19 pandemic: A randomized clinical trial,2020-11-28,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Anterior knee pain is a multifactorial, often chronic condition, which can lead to long-term pain and disability. The purpose of this review is to examine the latest research on patient education for anterior knee pain. We will focus on how we might use patient education to increase the adoption of other efficacious treatment modalities and offer some suggestions for content and form of effective patient education. RECENT FINDINGS: New research suggests that patient education, alone, or in combination with targeted exercise therapy, can be effective in reducing pain and improving function in patients with patellofemoral pain. Addressing non-physical or psychological factors may also be an important component of patient education in many patients with chronic pain. Incorporation of new technologies into patient education, such as those available online, or through phone- or tablet-based apps, is likely to be helpful in the future, as we move more towards connecting with patients virtually. SUMMARY: Patient education has been shown to be effective in decreasing pain and improving activity in patients with patellofemoral pain. Patient education should be individualized to the patient, focus on the latest effective treatments, and emphasize those treatments that can be self-managed by the patient. Emphasis should also be placed on patient understanding of risk factors and patterns of movement that may lead to, or exacerbate, anterior knee pain. Future research should continue to further characterize the elements of patient education that offer the most efficient treatment benefit.","Bosshardt, Lauren; Ray, Taylor; Sherman, Seth",Curr Rev Musculoskelet Med,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12178-020-09682-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33523412/,692
