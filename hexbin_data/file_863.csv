63690,A monthly roundup of key articles in other journals.,2021-06-15,"Once considered a hallmark of human uniqueness, brain asymmetry has emerged as a feature shared with several other species, including chimpanzees, one of our closest living relatives. Most notable has been the discovery of asymmetries in homologues of cortical language areas in apes, particularly in the planum temporale (PT), considered a central node of the human language network. Several lines of evidence indicate a role for genetic mechanisms in the emergence of PT asymmetry; however, the genetic determinants of cerebral asymmetries have remained elusive. Studies in humans suggest that there is heritability of brain asymmetries of the PT, but this has not been explored to any extent in chimpanzees. Furthermore, the potential influence of non-genetic factors has raised questions about the reproducibility of earlier observations of PT asymmetry reported in chimpanzees. As such, the present study was aimed at examining both the heritability of phenotypic asymmetries in PT morphology, as well as their reproducibility. Using magnetic resonance imaging, we evaluated morphological asymmetries of PT surface area (mm2) and mean depth (mm) in captive chimpanzees (n = 291) derived from two genetically isolated populations. Our results confirm that chimpanzees exhibit a significant population-level leftward asymmetry for PT surface area, as well as significant heritability in the surface area and mean depth of the PT. These results conclusively demonstrate the existence of a leftward bias in PT asymmetry in chimpanzees and suggest that genetic mechanisms play a key role in the emergence of anatomical asymmetry in this region.","Spocter, Muhammad A; Sherwood, Chet C; Schapiro, Steven J; Hopkins, William D",Proceedings.

101176,A monthly roundup of key articles in other journals.,2021-02-25,"The role of pediatric rehabilitation providers during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID) pandemic of 2020 highlighted the need for improved knowledge about medications utilized in pediatric patients. Pediatric patients with cerebral palsy who were previously receiving botulinum toxin injections on a regular basis went prolonged periods of time between injections, and patients who have intrathecal baclofen pumps were called in to get refills with different intervals. The medically complex patients treated by rehabilitation providers were limited in the type and scope of care they received, and some may have developed adverse outcomes related to this delay in care. As a Pediatric Physiatrist who has advanced training and significant research experience within the realm of Clinical Pharmacology, I have seen this pandemic demonstrate the Sisyphean challenge of continuing appropriate tone management in patients with cerebral palsy while ensuring those patients with neuromuscular conditions maintain their highest level of function. Both of these clinical problems received significant attention within this issue, which I hope allows providers taking care of these populations a reference point to take to the bedside.","McLaughlin, Matthew",Journal of pediatric rehabilitation medicine,https://doi.org/10.3233/prm-200026; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33185613/,863
102728,A monthly roundup of key articles in other journals.,2020-05-25,Interruption of the aortic arch (IAA) is a rare congenital anomaly which has been infrequently documented in the adult population. Aortic dissection (AD) is an emergency often presenting as acute chest pain and warranting urgent intervention. A 32-year-old male presented to Emergency Department with acute chest pain. Clinical examination revealed feeble pulses in bilateral lower limbs with a blood pressure difference between upper and lower limbs. Two-dimensional Echocardiography was suggestive of IAA with AD in the descending thoracic aorta. This was confirmed on computed tomography scan of the aorta which revealed complete interruption of the aortic arch distal to left subclavian artery along with the presence of an intimo-medial flap in descending thoracic aorta. A diagnosis of IAA with AD was made. The patient underwent an urgent aortic repair surgery following which he has been largely asymptomatic. A suspicion of AD should always be made in any patient presenting with acute onset chest pain radiating to the back along with accelerated hypertension/feeble pulses in extremity. Occurrence of AD in an adult with IAA is a distinct rarity and has been documented only thrice.,"Kunal, Shekhar; Pathak, Pooja; Mittal, Shruti; Pathak, Vijay; Vaswani, Prateek",Monaldi archives for chest disease = Archivio Monaldi per le malattie del torace,https://doi.org/10.4081/monaldi.2021.1404; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33594854/,863
119756,A monthly roundup of key articles in other journals.,2020-08-25,"Cardiac troponins (cTn) are currently the standard of carefor the diagnosis of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) in patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with chest pain (CP). However, their plasma kinetics necessitatea prolonged ED stay or overnight hospital admission, especially in those presenting early after CP onset. Moreover, ruling out ACS in low-risk patients requires prolonged ED observationor overnight hospital admission to allow serialmeasurements of c-Tn, adding cost. Heart-type fatty acid-binding protein (H-FABP) is a novel marker of myocardial injury with putative advantages over cTn. Beingpresent in abundance in the myocellular cytoplasm, it is released rapidly (<1 hour) after onset of myocardial injury and could potentially play an important role in both earlier diagnosis of high-risk patients presenting early after CP onset, as well as in risk-stratifying low-risk patients rapidly. Like cTn, H-FABP also has a potential role as a prognostic marker in other conditions where myocardial injury occurs, such asacute congestive heart failure (CHF) and acute pulmonary embolism (PE). This review provides an overview of the evidence examining therole of H-FABP in early diagnosis and risk stratification of patients with CP and in non-ACS conditions associated with myocardial injury. Key messages:Heart type fatty acid binding protein is a biomarker that is elevated early in myocardial injuryThe routine use in the emergency department complements the use of troponins in ruling out acute coronary syndromes in patients presenting early with chest painIt also is useful in risk stratifying patients with other conditions such as heart failure and acute pulmonary embolism.","Goel, Harsh; Melot, Joshua; Krinock, Matthew D; Kumar, Ashish; Nadar, Sunil K; Lip, Gregory Y H",Annals of medicine,https://doi.org/10.1080/07853890.2020.1800075; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32697102/,863

120327,A monthly roundup of key articles in other journals.,2021-09-14,"There is widespread acknowledgement of the presence of vitamin D deficiency in the community and the pressing need to address this. From a public health perspective, emphasis has been placed on addressing vitamin D deficiency through dietary means. However, naturally rich food sources of vitamin D are few and infrequently consumed, and nutrition survey data from various countries have indicated that habitual vitamin D intakes in the community are much lower than the current vitamin D dietary guidelines. This review will briefly overview the extent of vitamin D deficiency within the community, its causes, and how our food chain, once its embraces the evidence-based practise of food fortification and potentially biofortification, can cater for meeting the dietary vitamin D needs of the community. Finally, international authorities, briefed with establishing vitamin D dietary guidelines over the past decade, have struggled with uncertainties and gaps in our understanding of the relative contribution of sunshine and diet to vitamin D status and vitamin D requirements for health maintenance. The review will also consider how emerging evidence of a possible minimal-risk UVB radiation exposure relative to skin cancer that also enables vitamin D production could greatly inform future vitamin D dietary guidelines.","Cashman, Kevin D",Photochemical & photobiological sciences : Official journal of the European Photochemistry Association and the European Society for Photobiology,https://doi.org/10.1039/c9pp00462a; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32412568/,863
180385,A monthly roundup of key articles in other journals,2021,"Background: The role of healthcare workers (HCWs) in the general public health is crucial and their decision to vaccinate against the COVID-19 can have a positive impact on the general population facilitating widespread COVID-19 vaccine uptake. Objective: To estimate the uptake of a COVID-19 vaccine in HCWs and to expand our knowledge regarding the predictors of COVID-19 vaccine uptake. Methods: An on-line cross-sectional study was conducted in Greece during August 2021. We collected socio-demographic data of HCWs and we measured attitudes towards vaccination and COVID-19, knowledge and trust. We used a convenience sample since we distributed the questionnaire through social media and e-mails. Results: Study population included 855 HCWs. The majority of HCWs were vaccinated against the COVID-19 (91.5%). According to multivariate analysis, females, HCWs without a previous COVID-19 diagnosis, and HCWs with previous seasonal influenza vaccination history had a greater probability to take a COVID-19 vaccine. Also, increased self-perceived knowledge regarding COVID-19 and increased trust in COVID-19 vaccines and government regarding the information about the COVID-19 vaccines were associated with COVID-19 vaccine uptake. On the other hand, HCWs with more concerns about the side-effects of COVID-19 vaccination were more reluctant to take a COVID-19 vaccine. Conclusions: Our study provides a timely assessment of COVID-19 vaccination status among HCWs and identifies specific factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine uptake. By understanding these factors, policy makers and scientists will be able to develop novel strategies to improve COVID-19 vaccine uptake among HCWs.","Galanis, P.

213538,A monthly roundup of key articles in other journals,2021,"The establishment of decentralized drinking water systems in urban areas is technically and financially feasible, and these ‘off-grid’ systems can complement investment in traditional piped water systems. However, users often see ‘off-grid’ systems as the second-best option, compared to citywide piped water systems. Thus, although they are designed to improve access to water and reduce inequality, they can be perceived by users as infrastructural manifestations of extant inequality. In this paper, we present original research on the perceptions of users in Cimahi, Indonesia, surrounding their access to water and willingness to use and maintain ‘off-grid’ infrastructure. The majority of respondents used groundwater and packaged water as their primary water sources, and paid approximately twice the maximum tariff of piped water service. We interpreted the survey data with the theory of planned behavior framework and determined that respondents demonstrated a willingness to pay fees for ‘off-grid’ water systems, participate in water supply programs, and switch to new water sources. These intentions were affected by their attitude towards the behavior, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control to various degrees. The findings are useful for those designing strategies to introduce novel water delivery systems aimed at improving water access for diverse and disadvantaged socioeconomic groups in urban areas in the Global South.","Prayoga, Rizky Nastiti Anindrya Schindler Seth Siska W.

This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and predictors of psychological distress, defined by the presence of either depression or anxiety, among the public in Oman during the COVID-19 pandemic. This was a web-based, cross-sectional study conducted using governmental and private institutional e-mail systems and social media platforms. Anxiety and depression were assessed using both the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 Scale and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. Logistic regression analysis was used to assess the independent predictors. There were a total of 1538 participants in this study (75% female). The prevalence of psychological distress was 30%. Being female, having financial instability, being treated for mental illness and self-medication for coping with stress were independent predictors of psychological distress among the study sample (Odds ratio [OR] = 1.69, confidence interval [CI] = 1.24-2.29; OR = 2.05, CI = 1.54-2.74; OR = 5.35, CI = 3.50-8.18; OR = 7.23, CI = 3.06-17.09, respectively). The results from this study will help public health officials in Oman to plan for and mitigate psychological repercussions of the current and future pandemics.","Sinawi, Hamed Al; Al Balushi, Naser; Al-Mahrouqi, Tamadhir; Al Ghailani, Abdullah; McCall, Roopa K; Sultan, Alya; Al Sabti, Hilal; Al Maniri, Abdullah; Murthi Panchatcharam, Sathiya; Al-Alawi, Mohammed",Psychol Health Med,,863
