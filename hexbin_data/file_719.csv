26012,A Pairwise Alignment Algorithm for Long Sequences of High Similarity,2017-10-13,"The use of viral-mediated gene transfer in animal behavioral experiments has become very popular over the last decade. Altering gene regulation and assessing subsequent behavior can be a useful tool in unraveling a specific gene’s contributions to complex behavioral processes such as depressive-like behavior. However, these types of experiments require detailed planning and designs to avoid pitfalls associated with issues such as surgical procedure or the peak of viral expression. This chapter is intended to be a primer on the design of such experiments and aims to discuss factors that must be considered in the early phases of experimental planning.","Furay, Amy R.; Neumaier, John F.",Viral Vector Approaches in Neurobiology and Brain Diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122802/,719

Twenty-six of the patients also had measles. Viruses were found in 52 of the 123 patients (43 per cent) and rotavirus occurred in 38 children (31 per cent). Enteroviruses were found in 10 patients, adenoviruses in nine and ‘small round virus’ in one (six patients had dual infection). Four patients died and only one of these children had viral particles in the stools. Breast milk formed part or all of the diet in 77 children (63 per cent) and virus isolation showed a similar pattern in breast fed infants and those not receiving breast milk. In 26 patients with measles only five were excreting viruses in their stools. Therefore no strong evidence was found to link the diarrhoea associated with measles in Tanzanian children to any particular virus. The pattern of virus infection causing infantile diarrhoea was similar in Dar es Salaam to other parts of the world.","Brookfield, D.S.K.; Cosgrove, B.P.; Bell, E.J.; Madeley, C.R.",J Infect,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7133693/,719

28013,Implementation Considerations for Big Data Analytics (BDA): A Benefit Dependency Network Approach,2020-03-06,"The development of an antiviral drug as well as of other drugs is a long process. In most programmes the screening and evaluation start using inhibition of virus multiplication in cell cultures, but in some instances the screening starts in animal models of different viral diseases. In these cases, the mechanism of action has to be analyzed after the in vivo effect has been found. It is not possible to specify precisely the time and resources required in a newly started project to find a compound active against a virus infection but 5-10 years is a reasonable estimation. For some viruses such as herpesviruses, where a number of active inhibitors are already known, the task is simpler than it is to find inhibitors of a virus such as influenza against which only a few active inhibitors have been reported. Evaluation of clinical efficacy in humans is a large and difficult part of the development of an antiviral drug. The number of uncontrolled clinical studies claiming efficacy of different drugs against viral diseases is depressingly large. It is essential to perform double-blind, placebo-controlled and statistically well evaluated studies to be able to judge the clinical efficacy of an antiviral drug. As the knowledge of the detailed natural history and molecular biology of viral diseases and viruses themselves increases, one will obviously have better opportunities to find new drugs. Methods such as X-ray diffraction measurement and NMR determinations will probably lead to a detailed understanding of the structures and interactions taking place at the active site of viral enzymes and their cellular counterparts.",,Perspect Med Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7133937/,719
43590,Inhaltsverzeichnis,2020-12-15,"OBJECTIVES: Checklists have been used to decrease adverse events associated with medical procedures. Simulation provides a safe setting in which to evaluate a new checklist. The objective of this study was to determine if the use of a novel peri-intubation checklist would decrease practitioners’ rates of omission of tasks during simulated airway management scenarios. METHODS: Fifty-four emergency medicine (EM) practitioners from two academic centers were randomized to either their usual approach or use of our checklist, then completed three simulated airway management scenarios. A minimum of two assessors documented the number of tasks omitted and the time until definitive airway management. Discrepancies between assessors were resolved by single assessor video review. Participants also completed a post-simulation survey. RESULTS: The average percentage of omitted tasks over three scenarios was 45.7% in the control group (n = 25) and 13.5% in the checklist group (n = 29)—an absolute difference of 32.2% (95% CI 27.8, 36.6%). Time to definitive airway management was longer in the checklist group in the first two of three scenarios (difference of 110.0 s, 95% CI 55.0 to 167.0; 83.0 s, 95% CI 35.0 to 128.0; and 36.0 s, 95% CI −18.0 to 98.0 respectively). CONCLUSIONS: In this dual-center, randomized controlled trial, use of an airway checklist in a simulated setting significantly decreased the number of important airway tasks omitted by EM practitioners, but increased time to definitive airway management.

43984,412. Assessment and Capability of SARS-CoV-2 Detection in the Veterans Health Administration,2020-12-31,"The adoption of Additive Manufacturing (AM) has gradually transformed the fashion industry through innovation and technology over the last decade. Novel AM systems and techniques are continuously being developed, leading to the application of AM polymers with textiles and fabrics in the fashion industry. This work investigates the development and testing of polymer–textile composites using polylactic acid (PLA) filaments on synthetic mesh fabrics using direct material extrusion (ME). An aspect of this paper highlights the appropriate combination of printing material, textile substrate, and printer settings to achieve excellent polymer–textile adhesion. Details of the printing process to create polymer–textile composites are described, as are the interfacial strength results of the T-peel tests, and the observed failure modes post-testing. The peel strengths for different ME bonded polymer–textile composites are examined and used to identify the compatibility of materials. This work visualised the potential of direct ME of polymers onto textile fabrics as a material-joining approach for new textile functionalisation, multi-material composite explorations and innovative aesthetic print techniques. This work also adds to the limited knowledge of AM polymer–textile composites, which can provide helpful information for designers and researchers to develop new applications and facilitate future research development in smart embedded and programmable textiles.","Loh, Giselle Hsiang; Sotayo, Adeayo; Pei, Eujin",Fash Text,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7781653/,719

It first considers the complications inherent in the political commitment to nuclear disarmament made by the five declared Nuclear Weapons States recognised by the NPT, before looking at the more recent P5 process, whereby these states have begun to address the issue of nuclear disarmament as a result of increasing international pressure. The chapter then looks at US, Russian, UK, French and Chinese nuclear doctrine, and at the debates and dynamics which continue to underpin their respective nuclear weapons programmes. It also considers some of the main hurdles and problems that will have to be addressed for these states to reduce and possibly relinquish entirely their nuclear weapons capabilities in the future.","Futter, Andrew",The Politics of Nuclear Weapons,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7991170/,719

Serological tests help in evaluating the spread of infection and disease immunization. The aim of this study was to prospectively examine the trends and risk factors of SARS-CoV-2 infection in blood donors. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS We screened 8798 asymptomatic donors presenting in Milan from July 2020 to February 2021 (10,680 presentations) before the vaccination campaign for anti-nucleoprotein (NP) antibodies, and for anti-spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) antibodies and nasopharyngeal swab PCR in those who tested positive. RESULTS The prevalence of anti-NP+/RBD+ tests increased progressively with time up to ~15% (p < .0001), preceded by a peak of PCR+ tests. Anti-RBD titers were higher in anti-NP IgG+/IgM+ than in IgG+/IgM- individuals and in those with a history of infection (p < .0001); of these 197/630 (31.2%) displayed high titers (>80 AU/ml). Anti-RBD titers declined during follow-up, depending on baseline titers (p < .0001) and time (p = .025). Risk factors for seroconversion were a later presentation date and non-O ABO blood group (p < .001). A positive PCR was detected in 0.7% of participants in the absence of SARS-CoV-2 viremia. CONCLUSIONS During the second wave of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Northern Italy, we detected an increase in seroprevalence in healthy blood donors from ~4% to ~15%, with a trend paralleling that observed in the general population. Seroconversion was more frequent in carriers of non-O blood groups. The persistence of anti-RBD antibodies was short-lived.","Valenti, Luca; Pelusi, Serena; Cherubini, Alessandro; Bianco, Cristiana; Ronzoni, Luisa; Uceda Renteria, Sara; Coluccio, Elena; Berzuini, Alessandra; Lombardi, Angela; Terranova, Leonardo; Malvestiti, Francesco; Lamorte, Giuseppe; Erba, Elisa; Oggioni, Massimo; Ceriotti, Ferruccio; Prati, Daniele",Transfusion,https://doi.org/10.1111/trf.16693; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34647620/,719

Keep It Simple!,2019-09-01,"OBJECTIVES To describe clinical-radiologic characteristics in a prospective series of patients having both confirmed reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS) and cervical artery dissection (CeAD). METHODS From January 2004 to December 2011, from our prospective cohorts of RCVS and CeAD, we studied patients with both conditions. RESULTS Of 173 RCVS cases and 285 CeAD cases, 20 patients (18 women, 2 men; mean age 41 years) had both RCVS and CeAD. Main associated conditions were migraine (12/20) and postpartum (5/18). Clinical features included severe headache in all patients, neck pain in 15, focal neurologic deficit in 9, and seizures in 4. Pain was the only symptom in 10 patients. All patients had multifocal cerebral vasoconstriction. There were brain lesions in 12 patients, cortical subarachnoid hemorrhage in 11, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome in 4, intracerebral hemorrhage in 3, and infarcts in 4. CeAD involved one artery in 13 patients and multiple arteries in 7. CeAD mostly affected vertebral arteries (25 of 30 CeAD). Only one vertebral CeAD was associated with a related symptomatic infarct. At 3 months, 18 patients had fully recovered, all patients showed reversal of cerebral vasoconstriction, and 21 dissected arteries had normalized, whereas 9 arteries showed residual stenosis (7) and/or aneurysm (3). CONCLUSION The association of RCVS and CeAD was found in 12% of our patients with RCVS and 7% of our patients with CeAD. Underlying mechanisms are unknown. In practice, our results point to the need for a systematic study of both cervical and intracranial arteries in the 2 conditions.","Mawet, Jérôme; Boukobza, Monique; Franc, Julie; Sarov, Mariana; Arnold, Marcel; Bousser, Marie-Germaine; Ducros, Anne",Neurology,https://doi.org/10.1212/wnl.0b013e3182a2cbe2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23884040/,719

Results showed that the MC for feedstock degradation could satisfy the need of effective conversion from feedstock to CH4 when the OLR remained below 16.4 g-TS/L/d. Furthermore, the MC for acetate, propionate and butyrate degradation increased by 73.8%, 303%, and 164%, respectively, with OLR increasing from 3.03 g-TS/L/d 12.6 g-TS/L/d. The evolution of both bacterial and archaeal communities provided additional information on the adaptation of functional microbes to environmental factors. The significant increase of abundance of Methanoculleus and Methanomassiliicoccus likely promoted the utilization of H2, thus facilitating syntrophic methanogenesis, and consequently ensuring efficient CH4 production in stable stage.","Li, Qian; Yuwen, Chaosui; Cheng, Xinru; Yang, Xiaohuan; Chen, Rong; Wang, Xiaochang C",Bioresource technology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2018.03.087; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29621685/,719

162614,Teaching software engineering during Covid-19 constraint or opportunity?,2021,"Research suggests that working during traumatic events can lead to deteriorating physical and mental health for nurses, a phenomenon that has been demonstrated during the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. However, research has also shown that there are evidence-based strategies that can be used to assist nurses in their recovery from such events. Promoting awareness among individual nurses about the effects of COVID-19 enables them to adopt positive coping strategies, both on an individual and organisational level. This article details strategies including formal and informal debriefing, taking regular breaks, and using stress mitigation strategies during shifts. The article also discusses the potential for post-traumatic psychological growth. This acknowledges that while working in a healthcare environment during COVID-19 can be extremely challenging, it also enables nurses to experience personal growth such as the development of emotional intelligence. As nurses adapt to the 'new normal' of working during COVID-19, healthcare organisations should ensure that they provide nurses with the support that enables them to recover effectively.","Jackson, Jennifer",Nursing standard (Royal College of Nursing (Great Britain) : 1987),https://doi.org/10.7748/ns.2021.e11661; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33586385/,719
162879,SeVa: A Food Donation App for Smart Living,2021,"The coronavirus pandemic has had a significant impact on the Russian media, which, regardless of their format, have been broadcasting news about the infection since the beginning of the outbreak on a regular basis. The main purpose of the research is to establish a connection between the epidemiological situation in Russia during the first wave and the nature of the change in the information agenda on the air of the entertainment “Radio Dacha”. To reach this goal the author, using the method of inclusive observation, analyzes 1 219 episodes of the news program, aired from January 2020, when radio hosts first mentioned the COVID-19, to July 2020, when the main restrictions were lifted in Russia. The article shows that depending on the epidemiological state, the number of notes about the coronavirus increased. The maximum quantity of news about the disease was noted in April and May when the country had the highest amount of cases and announced a lockdown. Meanwhile, the content analysis indicated that there was direct and indirect news coverage of the coronavirus. Their ratio is 97 to 3 % in favor of direct news. It means that despite the format of the radio station, the radio hosts only talked about political and social news with little or no entertainment content. Thus, the epidemic dynamic changed the information agenda, and the worst it was, the more news about the coronavirus went on the air. The news about the infection became the longest discussed subject on the air of “Radio Dacha”. © 2021.

Our knowledge of the true health of the construction industry under the ravage of COVID-19 outbreak is largely based on very limited data. This study aims to assess the impact of pandemic on the construction industry through an investigation in Vietnam. Data were collected through 129 respondents whose online questionnaire survey completed according to their recent direct or indirect participation in delivering construction projects during the spread. The implications of COVID-19 on the construction industry were examined based on simple percentage analysis and Relative Importance Index approaches. Three principal facets of the construction industry were considered: firms' business activities, project performance, and workforce demand. The findings highlighted the multilevel, multidimensional nature of the epidemic consequences on the construction sector. Notably, the revenue and profitability, in a general sense, have decreased during the COVID-19 period, while most of the production and business costs had remained unchanged. Further, the pandemic was argued to impair construction practitioners' incomes and mental health and sabotage projects' schedule and cost. (C) 2021 Penerbit UTM Press.

The threat of closure of educational institutions turned it into a golden opportunity to use the Internet of Things to learn and progress. This paper aims to compare traditional education and IoT-based education in learning and student participation in the classroom. A questionnaire was prepared and distributed among students participating in both educational systems to conduct this descriptive study. The data extracted from 400 returned questionnaires were analyzed using descriptive and analytical statistical methods using SPSS and MATLAB software. The paper results showed that the scores obtained by students in IoT-based tests were higher than traditional tests. The percentage of students' attendance and participation in the classroom in the IoT-based education system showed a considerable increase. The midterm exam scores, homework scores, online and quizzes, the final exam for the IoT-based and traditional education system was 2.39 ± 0.51, 2.02 ± 0.78, 2.50± 0.44, 5.20 ± 1.86 and 1.69 ± 0.83, 1.18 ± 1.05, 1.55±0.63, 3.70 ± 2.26 respectively. Statistical analysis of the results showed a significant difference in the scores of students who participated in the IoT-based educational system from students who traditionally participated in classes (P <0.05). Given the brilliant results of using IoT-based education and also some of the advantages of traditional education, it can be concluded that the combination of the two education systems can cover the weaknesses of IoT-based and traditional education methods, and students can benefit from IoT-based and traditional training at the same time. © 2021 IEEE.","Moridani, M.

Researchers have proven synchronous learning components to reduce the transactional distance that students experience in online learning environments, and such components play an important role in many information systems (IS) courses. However, students who cannot reliably access the technological resources that they need for synchronous learning remain left behind in these learning environments. We summarize strategies that individual IS faculty and institutional information technology (IT) departments can implement to assist such students. Faculty-level strategies include implementing complementary asynchronous features, clearly communicating expectations, and implementing intervention strategies to foster collaborative work. Institutional solutions include providing software applications via the cloud for students who need to access them remotely and loaning computer resources such as laptops to students who lack them and effectively training faculty and students in online learning. These measures will help higher education institutions to bridge the transactional distance that students experience as online learning becomes more prevalent in the months and years ahead.","Iyer, D.

Such studies attempt to capture population responses to differing levels of social distancing, and are used for designing policies which both inhibit disease spread but also allow for limited economic activity. One common criterion utilized for the recent pandemic is the peak of the infected population, a measure of the strain placed upon the health care system; protocols which reduce this peak are commonly said to `flatten the curve."" In this work, we consider a very specialized distancing mandate, which consists of one period of fixed length of distancing, and addresses the question of optimal initiation time. We prove rigorously that this time is characterized by an equal peaks phenomenon: the optimal protocol will experience a rebound in the infected peak after distancing is relaxed, which is equal in size to the peak when distancing is commenced. In the case of a non-perfect lockdown (i.e. disease transmission is not completely suppressed), explicit formulas for the initiation time cannot be computed, but implicit relations are provided which can be pre-computed given the current state of the epidemic. Expected extensions to more general distancing policies are also hypothesized, which suggest designs for the optimal timing of non-overlapping lockdowns.","Greene, J.; Sontag, E.

Moreover, the current Covid-19 pandemic has shifted additional attention to homeschooling. However, much of the available research is primarily concerned with the current day-to-day practice of homeschooling and little attention is paid to adult homeschool graduates. This exploratory study, based on qualitative interviews with mothers and adult children from 12 families, examines young adults' overall evaluation of their past homeschooling experience and aims to understand how parents and children view the pros and cons of homeschooling in hindsight. The data analysis revealed that homeschoolers approach education more broadly than focusing strictly on the academic side and it identified the common theme of ""gifting,""which challenges the prevailing conceptualization that homeschooling is a ""sacrifice.""Respondents viewed their homeschooling experience as a mutually beneficial process of giving and receiving rather than a unidirectional act of ""sacrifice."" © 2021 2021 Marta McCabe et al., published by Sciendo.","McCabe, M.; Beláňová, A.; MacHovcová, K.",Journal of Pedagogy,https://doi.org/10.2478/jped-2021-0006,719

Already widespread, hybrid vehicles are beginning to share the market with hydrogen-powered propulsion systems. These systems are fuel cells or internal combustion engines powered by hydrogen fuel. In this context, road tests of a hydrogen fuel cell drive were conducted under typical traffic conditions according to the requirements of the RDE test. As a result of the carried-out work, energy flow conditions were presented for three driving phases (urban, rural and motorway). The different contributions to the vehicle propulsion of the hydrogen system and the electric system in each phase of the driving route are indicated. The characteristic interaction of power train components during varying driving conditions was presented. A wide variation in the contribution of the fuel cell and the battery to the vehicle’s propulsion was identified. In urban conditions, the share of the fuel cell in the vehicle’s propulsion is more than three times that contributed by the battery, suburban—7 times, highway—28 times. In the entire test, the ratio of FC/BATT use was more than seven, while the energy consumption was more than 22 kWh/100 km. The amounts of battery energy used and recovered were found to be very close to each other under RDE test conditions.","Szałek, Andrzej Pielecha Ireneusz Cieslik Wojciech",Energies,https://doi.org/10.3390/en14165018,719

Thus, it is important to look for risk and protective factors that allow and help individuals to regulate these negative emotions and adapt to the hardships of the COVID-19 pandemic.ObjectivesThe main aims of the study were to (i) test how empathic dimensions (perspective taking, empathic concern and personal distress) and emotion regulation abilities were related to intensity of depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 lockdown in Poland, as well as to (ii) check if emotion regulation difficulties and personal distress predicted slower decrease in depressive symptoms over the two months in which the number of COVID-19 cases declined in Poland.MethodsA total of 792 participants took part in the three-wave panel study. The sample was representative of the Polish population in terms of gender, age, and place of residence. Participants completed the following online questionnaires: The Patient Health Questionnaire-9, The Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale Short Form, and Brief version of the Empathic Sensitivity.ResultsSignificant positive correlations were found between depressive symptoms and both personal distress and emotion regulation difficulties during the lockdown. Moreover, emotion regulation difficulties were the only significant predictor of slower decrease in depressive symptoms over time during the COVID-19 pandemic.ConclusionsIt seems that interventions focused on improvement of emotion regulation abilities could be particularly beneficial in reducing depressive symptoms during the pandemic and preventing potential negative long-term outcomes.","Gambin, M.; Woźniak-Prus, M.; Sękowski, M.; Holas, P.; Wnuk, A.; Oleksy, T.; Cudo, A.; Hansen, K.; Huflejt-Łukasik, M.; Łyś, A.; Gorgol, J.; Kubicka, K.; Kmita, G.; Łojek, E.",European Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1192/j.eurpsy.2021.683,719

The case study method is chosen to observe the qualitative and quantitative data based on three considerations, i.e. the technologies, goals and assessments. The results show three things: teaching innovations based on the processes and products and the evaluation. Processes here mean the variety on the technology use in teaching. During the pandemic, not only Whatsapp (WA) application is used to support the teaching but also two learning management systems (LMS), i.e. Elnino (Moodle-based) and Google Classroom (Google-based). These technologies are used simultantly to record the attendances as well as to deliver teaching and assignment materials. Meanwhile, Whatsapp (WA) application is then used specifically for discussions, Google Classroom for submitting assignment and Elnino for managing the grades. Beside the LMS, another technology, i.e. Youtube channel, is used to share teaching materials in the video format. Meanwhile products here mean innovations on the goals and assessments modifications. Goals are simplified into three (out of four) purposes only. While assessments only consist of the two (out of three) individual assignments and two (out of four) group works. As the evaluation given by students’ feedback, more teaching innovations are needed to balance the synchronous and asynchronous teaching approaches. Which means more technologies can be used to conduct online meeting (e.g. Zoom meeting, Google Meet) and interactive online quizzes (e.g. Kahoot, Mentimeter).","Iswanti, Muhlasah Novitasari Mara Suryanti Sri Raharjo Suko; en,",Journal of Physics: Conference Series,https://doi.org/10.1088/1742-6596/1940/1/012102,719

Our case study is the Galleria Borghese museum in Rome (Italy), in which we performed a real-life data acquisition campaign. We specifically employ a Lagrangian IoT-based visitor tracking system based on Raspberry Pi receivers, displaced in fixed positions throughout the museum rooms, and on portable Bluetooth Low Energy beacons handed over to the visitors. Thanks to two algorithms: a sliding window-based statistical analysis and an MLP neural network, we filter the beacons RSSI and accurately reconstruct visitor trajectories at room-scale. Via a clustering analysis, hinged on an original Wasserstein-like trajectory-space metric, we analyze the visitor paths to get behavioral insights, including the most common flow patterns. On these bases, we build the transition matrix describing, in probability, the room-scale visitor flows. Such a matrix is the cornerstone of a stochastic model capable of generating visitor trajectories in silico. We conclude by employing the simulator to increase the number of daily visitors while respecting numerous logistic and safety constraints. This is possible thanks to optimized ticketing and new entrance/exit management.","Centorrino, Pietro; Corbetta, Alessandro; Cristiani, Emiliano; Onofri, Elia",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.16830v3.pdf,719
164706,Detecting offensive content on social media during anti-lockdown protests in Michigan,2021,"Macro events like the Great Depression in the 1930s and the Second World War have triggered new departures in social policy. What about the COVID-19 pandemic and the attendant socio-economic crisis? This article analyses the social protection measures taken by governments in the global South in response to the crisis, the social protection concepts developed by international organisations, and the overall strategies of the organisations in view of future shocks. The finding is that while the measures taken by governments expectedly have just been stopgap measures of a transitory nature, international organisations are aspiring to future-oriented policies and present a range of concepts for the time after the crisis. However, these are old concepts from pre-COVID-19 times, and the main strategy is to expand rather than reform the old models, even though the international organisations themselves identify new forms of poverty and structural inequalities. Moreover, the organisations do not provide conclusive evidence of their strategy’s viability;the strategy rather reflects a belief in social progress. All in all, the crisis has hardly been used as a window of opportunity for generating new ideas of social protection. Rather, the crisis has revealed the flimsy nature of widespread thinking about building social protection in the global South. Conceptually, the article draws on world society theory, conceiving of the pandemic as a global macro event.

164865,Towards the Automatic Generation of Pedagogical Conversational Agents from Lecture Slides,2021,"−1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting (−1 PRF) is a translational recoding mechanism used by many viral and cellular mRNAs. −1 PRF occurs at a heptanucleotide slippery sequence and is stimulated by a downstream RNA structure, most often in the form of a pseudoknot. The utilization of −1 PRF to produce proteins encoded by the −1 reading frame is wide-spread in RNA viruses, but relatively rare in cellular mRNAs. In human, only three such cases of −1 PRF events have been reported, all involving retroviral-like genes and protein products. To evaluate the extent of −1 PRF utilization in the human transcriptome, we have developed a computational scheme for identifying putative pseudoknot-dependent −1 PRF events and applied the method to a collection of 43,191 human mRNAs in the NCBI RefSeq database. In addition to the three reported cases, our study identified more than two dozen putative −1 PRF cases. The genes involved in these cases are genuine cellular genes without a viral origin. Moreover, in more than half of these cases, the frameshift site locates far upstream (>250 nt) from the stop codon of the 0 reading frame, which is nonviral-like. Using dual luciferase assays in HEK293T cells, we confirmed that the −1 PRF signals in the mRNAs of CDK5R2 and SEMA6C are functional in inducing efficient frameshifting. Our findings have significant implications in expanding the repertoire of the −1 PRF phenomenon and the protein-coding capacity of the human transcriptome.","Zhou, Xia; Huang, Xiaolan; Du, Zhihua",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.23.441185,719

Recently, we investigated the humoral antibody responses of SARS-CoV-2 convalescent patients and vaccinees towards circulating variants, and identified a panel of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that could efficiently neutralize the B.1.351 (Beta) variant. Here we investigate how these mAbs target the B.1.351 spike protein using cryo-electron microscopy. In particular, we show that two superpotent mAbs, BD-812 and BD-836, have non-overlapping epitopes on the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of spike. Both block the interaction between RBD and the ACE2 receptor; and importantly, both remain fully efficacious towards the B.1.617.1 (Kappa) and B.1.617.2 (Delta) variants.

The second/third wave of virus spread in various parts of the world combined with new evidence of re-infections and inadequate healthcare facilities demand increased testing rate to diagnose COVID-19 at its core. Although traditional molecular diagnostic tests have served this purpose, there have been shortage of reagents and other supplies at pandemic frontlines. This calls for novel alternate diagnostic processes with potential for obtaining emergency use authorization and that can be deployed in the field at the earliest opportunity. Here, we show an ultra-fast SARS-CoV-2 detection sensor for detecting coronavirus proteins in saliva within 100 milliseconds. Electrochemical oxidation of nickel hydroxide has been controlled using cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry techniques for successful detection of SARS-CoV-2. Test results have proven the capability of sensors to quantitatively detect the concentration of virus in blinded analyses. The detection occurs by a process similar to that of SARS-CoV-2 binding onto host cells. The sensor also shows prospects in distinguishing SARS-CoV-2 from other viruses such as HIV. More importantly, the sensor matches the detection limit of the gold standard test for diagnosing early infection. The use of saliva as a non-invasive sampling technique combined with the portability of the instrument has broadened the potential of this sensor.","Ramanujam, Ashwin Almodovar Sharilyn Botte Gerardine G.",Processes,https://doi.org/10.3390/pr9071236,719

In addition, the resistance to azole profile was also assessed. Surface samples showed a range of total bacterial contamination between 1 × 103 to 3.1 × 106 CFU·m−2, while Gram-negative bacteria ranged from 0 to 1.9 × 104 CFU·m−2. Fungal contamination ranged from 2 × 103 to 1.8 × 105 CFU·m−2 on MEA, and from 5 × 103 to 1.7 × 105 CFU·m−2 on DG18. The most prevalent species found on both media was Cladosporium sp. (47.36% MEA;32.33% DG18). Aspergillus genera was observed on MEA (3.21%) and DG18 (14.66%), but not in the supplemented media used for the azole screening. Aspergillus section Fumigati was detected in 2 air samples (2.22%, 2 out of 90 samples) by qPCR. When testing for SARS-CoV-2 all results were negative. The present study showed that although cleaning and disinfection procedures are done regularly due to the COVID-19 pandemic, being effective in eliminating SARS-CoV-2, surfaces were often contaminated with microorganisms other than SARS-CoV-2. This can be a result of increasing resistance to biocides, and to the wide range of environmental factors that can contribute to the dissemination of microbial contamination indoors.

To tackle this problem, in this paper, the development of an Internet of things (IoT) assisted ambulatory electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring system is presented. The system’s wearable single-channel data acquisition device supports 25 h of continuous operation. A right leg drive (RLD) circuit supported analog frontend (AFE) with a high common mode rejection ratio (CMRR) of 121 dB and a digitally implemented notch filter is used to suppress power-line frequency interference. The wearable device continuously sends the collected ECG data via Bluetooth to the user’s smartphone. An application on the user’s smartphone renders real-time ECG trace and heart rate and detects abnormal heart rhythms. This data are then shared in real-time with the user’s doctor via a real-time cloud database. An application on the doctor’s smartphone allows real-time visualization of this data and detection of arrhythmias. Simulations and experimental results demonstrate that reliable ECG signals can be captured with low latency and the heart rate computation is comparable to a commercial application. Low cost, scalability, low latency, real-time ECG monitoring, and improved performance of the system make the system highly suitable for the real-time remote identification and management of CVDs in users of rural areas and in the COVID-19 pandemic.","Ali, Hassan Naing Hein Htet Yaqub Raziq",Electronics,https://doi.org/10.3390/electronics10161871,719

The main clinical symptoms include fever (temperature &gt;38°C), cough, and shortness of breath. In addition, it can be accompanied by fatigue, myalgia, gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea, and even recently found manifestations of skin disorders. Skin manifestations in COVID-19 pregnant patients are still a rare condition. Skin manifestations can be an early sign of such infection, which therefore requires clinicians’ notice to allow them to conduct early COVID-19 screening in pregnant women for better outcomes of the mother and the baby. We present a 26-year-old primigravida at 39 weeks of gestational age with premature rupture of membranes and COVID-19 infection. Her complaints included itchy maculopapular rash and urticaria, then the pregnancy was terminated by a caesarean section, and the baby was born with good conditions. The skin lesions were given a mixture of corticosteroid cream and fusidic acid. The mother and the baby were discharged in a good condition.","Sulistyowati, Sri; Anggraini, Nutria Widya Purna; en,",Jurnal Kedokteran Dan Kesehatan Indonesia,https://doi.org/10.20885/jkki.vol12.iss1.art14,719

This study evaluates the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on the growing trend of NO2 emissions in South Asia. Satellite imagery data of Sentinel-5 Precursor with Tropomi instrument was employed in this study. The analysis was performed using time series data from February–May 2019 and February–May 2020. The time frame from February–May 2020 was further divided into two sub-time-frames, i.e., from 1 February–20 March (pre-lockdown) and from 21 March–May 2020 (lockdown). Results show the concentration of NO2 pollutants over the region declined by 6.41% from February–May 2019 to February–May 2020. Interestingly, an increasing trend of NO2 concentration by 6.58% occurred during the pre-lockdown phase in 2020 (1 February–20 March) compared to 2019 (February–May). However, the concentration of NO2 pollutants reduced considerably by 21.10% during the lockdown phase (21 March–10 May) compared to the pre-lockdown phase in 2020. Furthermore, the country-specific detailed analysis demonstrates the significant impact of COVID-19-attributed lockdown on NO2 concentration in South Asia.","Hassan, Farhad Chaudhry Muhammad Umar Yasir Muhammad Asghar Muhammad Nabeel Sarkodie Samuel Asumadu",Sustainability,https://doi.org/10.3390/su13137184,719

The authors sought to introduce pre-clinical students to the importance of AI methodologies and medical applications using modular short courses focused on active learning with precision medicine as a primary use case. Materials and Methods: A short elective course was designed to introduce first-year students to how various bioinformatic and AI-related processes work and how they help classify medical data, facilitate genomic analysis and predict clinical outcomes. The course covers gene sequencing and variants, neural networks, natural language processing, medical computer vision and the limitations and ethical concerns related to use of AI in precision medicine. Online content serves as major source material. After a faculty-led introduction, sessions focus on teams of students who present course content to one another and lead discussions with faculty guidance. A related short AI course focused on gene variants was given to the entire second-year class. Results: The elective course has been taken by 74 first- year students over 8 consecutive semesters (2017-2021). The course achieved average satisfaction scores of 4.4/5.0 (n = 13) when the active learning approach became dominant in 2018. Students were able to describe accurately how bioinformatics and AI make personalized medicine possible. Students also did well on the gene variants exercise given to the entire second year class (2018), but the full class short AI course was not continued in subsequent years. Students have created a school-approved interest group in medical AI. Conclusions: This experience shows that AI-related materials can be sustainably introduced into pre-clinical medical education with precision medicine as the primary use case. This modular course design and content could be adapted easily for educational use in medical subspecialties and other health professions.","Alderson, P. O.; Donlin, M. J.; Morrison, L.

Since then, it is one of the most affected countries globally. The rise of mental health problems in the population directly or indirectly affected is now a major concern. In the present study, we show the results of the first wave of the COVIDPsiq cohort study, which started early on (April 2020). The aim of this study was to investigate and compare independent predictors of symptoms of stress, anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in Brazilians one month after social distancing measures were implemented. Methods: Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21) and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) were the two self-report instruments used to assess the symptoms. Variables related to demographics, social distancing, exposure to the news of coronavirus pandemic, substance use, and traumatic situations were also analyzed. Data was gathered through a web-based survey. Multivariate analyses were performed through hierarchical multiple linear regression models (HMLR). Result: A sample of 3,587 participants completed the questionnaire, among which approximately two-thirds considered that their mental health worsened after the beginning of the social restriction measures. Stress, anxiety, depression, and PTSD levels were highly correlated with this self-perception. The five most important predictors of psychological distress were the distress related to pandemic news, younger age, current psychiatric diagnosis, trouble sleeping, and emotional abuse or violence. Limitations: This is an internet survey-based study in which convenience sample bias may limit its external validity. It does not represent the northern regions of the country and most participants are white wealthier females. It was not possible to evaluate if symptoms are clinically relevant to infer an increased incidence of mental illness. Conclusions: These results confirm the hypothesis that a pandemic would have important impacts on the mental health of the population and indicate the level of distress related to the media as an important predictor of mental symptoms.","Crestani Calegaro, V.; Ramos-Lima, L.

167834,On the construction of course ideology and politics in online comprehensive english teaching based on cloud platform,2021,"Bridging genotype to phenotype, the proteome has increasingly become of major importance to generate large, longitudinal sample series for data-driven biology and personalized medicine. Major improvements in laboratory automation, chromatography and software have increased the scale and precision of proteomics. So far missing are however mass spectrometric acquisition techniques that could deal with very fast chromatographic gradients. Here we present scanning SWATH, a data-independent acquisition (DIA) method, in which the DIA-typical stepwise windowed acquisition is replaced by a continuous movement of the precursor isolation window. Scanning SWATH accelerates the duty cycles to a few hundreds of milliseconds, and enables precursor mass assignment to the MS2 fragment traces for improving true positive precursor identification in fast proteome experiments. In combination with 800 µL/min high-flow chromatography, we report the quantification of 270 precursors per second, increasing the precursor identifications by 70% or more compared to previous methods. Scanning SWATH quantified 1,410 Human protein groups in conjunction with chromatographic gradients as fast as 30 seconds, 2,250 with 60-second gradients, and 4,586 in conjunction with 5-minute gradients. At high quantitative precision, our method hence increases the proteomic throughput to hundreds of samples per day per mass spectrometer. Scanning SWATH hence enables a broad range of new proteomic applications that depend on large numbers of cheap yet quantification precise proteomes.","Messner, Christoph B.; Demichev, Vadim; Bloomfield, Nic; White, Matthew; Kreidl, Marco; Ivosev, Gordana; Wasim, Fras; Zelezniak, Aleksej; Lilley, Kathryn S.; Tate, Stephen; Ralser, Markus",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/656793,719

The model considers that every day is divided into two periods: high-activity and low-activity. Periodic human movement between patches occurs in discrete times. Based on numerical simulations, we show unexpected scenarios such as the disease extinction in regions where the local basic reproductive number is greater than 1.

The nutrition community has worked on building consensus on key actions, implementation platforms were put in place and financing for nutrition slowly increased. Under the strong leadership of the Prime Minister, a revolutionary program to address malnutrition was launched in 2018. As actions under the mission accelerated, the COVID-19 pandemic arrived in early 2020. Affecting health systems, food systems, nutrition programs, social safety nets, and the economy, the pandemic has the potential to exacerbate the challenge of malnutrition in multiple ways. India can mitigate some of the possible ways in which COVID-19 will affect malnutrition but will require strong leadership and continued commitment, adaptation of the national nutrition mission, strengthening of the social safety net and innovative evidence-based data to take informed decisions, implement them and ensure feedback to take necessary corrective action. In this article, we outline some challenges and key areas for action. We conclude that India's nutrition journey is too important to be derailed by a crisis like COVID-19. This is a clarion call for the nutrition community in India to rally strongly to support continued attention to malnutrition in all its forms, to generate relevant evidence, and to support and engage all of society to urgently and adequately address malnutrition in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Here, we show that recombinant IFITM3 reconstituted into lipid vesicles induces negative membrane curvature and that this effect maps to its small amphipathic helix (AH). We demonstrate that AH: (i) partitions into lipid-disordered domains where IAV fusion occurs, (ii) induces negative membrane curvature, and (iii) increases lipid order and membrane stiffness. Additionally, replacing the IFITM3 AH with AH from an unrelated protein did not compromise its antiviral activity. These effects on membrane properties correlate with the fusion-inhibitory activity, as exogenous addition of AH to insulin-producing cells reduces glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Our results thus imply that IFITM3 inhibits the transition from hemifusion to full fusion by imposing an unfavorable membrane curvature and increasing the order and stiffness of the cytoplasmic leaflet of endosomal membranes.","Guo, Xiangyang; Steinkühler, Jan; Marin, Mariana; Li, Xiang; Lu, Wuyuan; Dimova, Rumiana; Melikyan, Gregory B.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.25.171280,719

Methods: We assessed the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 infection, personal protective equipment (PPE) shortages, PPE use, and accidents involving biological material among HCWs in the Recife metropolitan area, Northeast Brazil. Using respondent driven sampling, we included HCWs attending suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients from May 2020 to February 2021. Results: We analyzed 1,525 HCWs (527 physicians, 471 registered nurses, 263 nursing assistants/technicians, and 264 physical therapists). Women predominated in all categories (81.1%). Nurses were older and had more comorbidities (hypertension and overweight/obesity) than the other HCWs. The overall prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 61.8% after adjustment for the cluster random effect, weighted by network, and reference population size. The independent risk factors for a positive RT-PCR test were being a nursing assistant (OR adjusted: 2.56), not always using all recommended PPE in routine practice (ORadj: 2.15), and reporting a splash of biological fluid/respiratory secretion in the eyes (ORadj: 3.37). Conclusions: The high risk of infection among HCWs reflects PPE shortages and younger, possibly less experienced, frontline HCWs. There were disparities in the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection among HCWs, with nursing assistants being the most vulnerable, possibly due to their longer and frequent contact with COVID-19 patients.","Albuquerque, M. d.

In this study, we applied the log-periodic power law singularity (LPPLS) methodology based on multilevel time series to unravel the underlying mechanisms of the 2020 global stock market crash by analyzing the trajectories of 10 major world stock market indexes from both developed and emergent stock markets, including the S&P 500, the DJIA, and the NASDAQ from the United State, the FTSE from the United Kingdom, the DAX from Germany, the NIKKEI from Japan, the CSI 300 from China, the HSI from Hong Kong, the BSESN from India, and the BOVESPA from Brazil. In order to effectively distinguish between endogenous crash and exogenous crash in stock market, we proposed using the LPPLS confidence indicator as a classification proxy. The results show that the apparent LPPLS bubble patterns of the super-exponential increase, corrected by the accelerating logarithm-periodic oscillations, have indeed presented in the price trajectories of the seven indexes: S&P 500, DJIA, NASDAQ, DAX, CSI 300, BSESN, and BOVESPA, indicating that the large positive bubbles have formed endogenously prior to the 2020 stock market crash, and the subsequent crashes for the seven indexes are endogenous, stemming from the increasingly systemic instability of the stock markets inherently, while the well-known external shocks, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, the corporate debt bubble, and the 2020 Russia–Saudi Arabia oil price war, only served as sparks during the 2020 global stock market crash. In contrast, the crashes in the three remaining indexes: FTSE, NIKKEI, and HSI, are exogenous and hence are perhaps the only crashes truly due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We also found that in terms of the regime changes of the stock markets, no obvious LPPLS negative bubble pattern has been observed in the price trajectories of the 10 stock market indexes, indicating that the regime changes from a bear market to a bull market in late March 2020 are exogenous, stemming from external factors. The unprecedented market and economy rescue efforts from federal reserves and central banks across the world in unison may have played a critical role in quelling the 2020 global stock market crash in the nick of time. This paper creates a paradigm for future studies in real-time crash detection and underlying mechanism dissection. It serves to warn us of the imminent risks in not only the stock market but also other financial markets and economic indexes. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Song, R.; Shu, M.; Zhu, W.",Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physa.2021.126425,719

169765,COVID-19 Pandemic Prevention Mobile Application for on Campus Classroom,2021,"In the neonatal (NRDS) and acute (ARDS) respiratory distress syndromes, mechanical ventilation supports gas exchange but can cause ventilation-induced lung injury (VILI) that contributes to high mortality. Further, surface tension, T, should be elevated and VILI is proportional to T. Surfactant therapy is effective in NRDS but not ARDS. Sulforhodamine B (SRB) is a potential alternative T-lowering therapeutic. In anesthetized male rats, we injure the lungs with 15 min of 42 ml/kg tidal volume, VT, and zero end-expiratory pressure ventilation. Then, over 4 hrs, we support the rats with protective ventilation – VT of 6 ml/kg with positive end-expiratory pressure. At the start of the support period, we administer intravenous non-T-altering fluorescein (targeting 27 μM in plasma) without or with therapeutic SRB (10 nM). Throughout the support period, we increase inspired oxygen fraction, as necessary, to maintain >90% arterial oxygen saturation. At the end of the support period we sacrifice the rat; sample systemic venous blood for injury marker ELISAs; excise the lungs; combine confocal microscopy and servo-nulling pressure measurement to determine T in situ in the lungs; image fluorescein in alveolar liquid to assess local permeability; and determine lavage protein content and wet-to-dry ratio (W/D), both to assess global permeability. Lungs exhibit focal injury. Surface tension is elevated 72% throughout control lungs and in uninjured regions of SRB-treated lungs, but normal in injured regions of treated lungs. Sulforhodamine B administration improves oxygenation, reduces W/D and reduces plasma injury markers. Intravenous SRB holds promise as a therapy for respiratory distress. New and Noteworthy Sulforhodmaine B lowers T. Given the problematic intratracheal delivery of surfactant therapy for ARDS, intravenous SRB might constitute an alternative therapeutic. In a lung injury model, we find that intravenously administered SRB crosses the injured alveolar-capillary barrier, reduces T specifically in injured lung regions, improves oxygenation and reduces the degree of further lung injury. Intravenous SRB administration might help respiratory distress patients, including those with the novel coronavirus, avoid mechanical ventilation or, once ventilated, survive.","Wu, You; Ngyuen, Tam L.; Perlman, Carrie E.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.08.031435,719
169898,Understanding Supply Chain Visibility Through Experts’ Perspective: A Delphi Based Approach,2021,"Acute kidney injury is common, with ∼13 million cases and 1.7 million deaths/year worldwide. A major cause is renal ischemia, typically following cardiac surgery, renal transplant or severe hemorrhage. We examined the cause of the sustained reduction in renal blood flow (“no-reflow”), which exacerbates kidney injury even after an initial cause of compromised blood supply is removed. After 60 min kidney ischemia and 30-60 min reperfusion, renal blood flow remained reduced, especially in the medulla, and kidney tubule damage was detected as Kim-1 expression. Constriction of the medullary descending vasa recta and cortical peritubular capillaries occurred near pericyte somata, and led to capillary blockages, yet glomerular arterioles and perfusion were unaffected, implying that the long-lasting decrease of renal blood flow contributing to kidney damage was generated by pericytes. Blocking Rho kinase to decrease pericyte contractility from the start of reperfusion increased the post-ischemic diameter of the descending vasa recta capillaries at pericytes, reduced the percentage of capillaries that remained blocked, increased medullary blood flow and reduced kidney injury. Thus, post-ischemic renal no-reflow, contributing to acute kidney injury, reflects pericytes constricting the descending vasa recta and peritubular capillaries. Pericytes are therefore an important therapeutic target for treating acute kidney injury.","Freitas, Felipe; Attwell, David",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.24.461675,719

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report from India on the psychological status of COVID-19-positive individuals. Aim: The aim of the study was to assess the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the psychological status of persons tested positive for COVID-19. Setting and Design: This was a case-control study in a tertiary care hospital setting at Mumbai. Materials and Methods: A total of 104 individuals detected to have positive COVID-19 status and admitted to the hospital from May 1, 2020 to May 30, 2020, were compared with 106 age- and gender-matched controls from the general population for the psychological impact of COVID-19 as measured by Perceived Stress Scale-10, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 Questionnaire, Insomnia Severity Index, and World Health Organization Well-Being Index-5. Statistical Analysis Used: Group comparisons on nominal variables were analyzed by Chi-square test. P &lt; 0.05 was taken as statistically significant. Results: About 58.6% from COVID-19-positive group and 76.4% from control group reported moderate-to-high perceived stress. Moderate-to-severe depressive symptoms were reported in 6.7% versus 15%, moderate-to-severe anxiety symptoms in 1.9% versus 14.1%, clinical insomnia in 3.8% versus 14.1%, and poor quality of well-being in 22.1% versus 35.8%, in cases versus controls, respectively.

170444,Why students' self-regulation is key towards the new normality?,2021,"Background: Human bocavirus (HBoV) figures as an increased risk factor of respiratory and gastrointestinal tract infections among children. A great deal of data is available to support the pathogenic role of HBoV in acute respiratory diseases. However, the association between HBoV infection and gastroenteritis remains controversial due to the ambiguous results. The present work aims to clarify the role of HBoV as a cause of gastroenteritis in children. Methodology/Principal findings: A systematic search of the literature was carried out from 1 January 2016 to 29 August 2021 in Embase, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and the Chinese bibliographic database of biomedicine (CBM). Data from included studies were analyzed by use of a random-effects model. The pooled estimates of HBoV prevalence among all cases of gastroenteritis were generated and stratified by potential confounders. The pooled odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were computed for HBoV infection in relation to the risk of gastroenteritis. The overall prevalence of HBoV in children with gastroenteritis (9.1%, 95% CI: 6.7-11.8%) was considerably higher than that detected in children without gastroenteritis (4.0%, 95% CI: 1.1-8.5%). HBoV prevalence tended to be higher in cases of gastroenteritis under five years of age (12.1%, 95% CI: 6.8-18.7%). The highest frequency of HBoV was found in Egypt (57.8%, 95% CI: 47.7-67.6%). The predominant genotypes of HBoV circulating in children with gastroenteritis were genotype 1 (HBoV1, 3.8%, 95% CI: 2.7-5.2%) and genotype 2 (HBoV2, 2.4%, 95% CI: 1.3-3.7%). HBoV infection was significantly associated with an increased risk of gastroenteritis in children (OR 1.620, 95% CI: 1.023-2.566). Conclusion: The HBoV prevalence in pediatric cases of gastroenteritis is higher than that in children without gastroenteritis, demonstrating an increasing global burden of gastroenteritis in children caused by HBoV infection. Targeted intervention to reduce the HBoV burden should be established.","Zhang, M.; Liang, M.; Li, Q.; Xian, J.; Wu, F.; Zheng, L.; Chen, Q.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.10.08.21264786v1?rss=1,719
170467,T-COFFEE Multiple Sequence Aligner on Hadoop Spark Cluster,2021,"In early 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic compelled the field of education to swiftly redesign courses for hybrid and online teaching environments. The lack of in-person learning prompted professionals to rapidly incorporate unique and previously never-seen teaching practices in numerous different fields. One of the biggest challenges that educators have been facing during these difficult times is the lack of hands-on technology-based teaching activites under hybrid and online environments. To mitigate this issue, a small, affordable, and 3D-printed visible spectrophotometer (SpectroBox) was developed to allow instructors to rapidly create a portable instrument and provide a hands-on learning experience for students. SpectroBox is mainly a do-it-yourself at-home platform specifically designed for rapid implementation;thus, instructors can deploy SpectroBox under various learning environments, such as remote and hybrid practices. Included parts are in a small package and are transportable via standard parcel delivery;consequently, students can get access to these spectrometric units rapidly and easily. In this work, detailed design, schematics, and step-by-step instructions are presented for instructors to easily incorporate this system. The SpectroBox project was implemented and tested during the Fall 2020 semester, and student assessment data indicated that the theoretical and practical aspects of visible spectroscopy were better understood by 67% of students with this hands-on learning exercise. The final learning outcome of this project was a broad skillset possessed by students, including 3D printable object design, spectrometer assembly, principles of optical spectroscopy, exploration of design components, basic electronics, data acquisition and processing. SpectroBox helped students to fully understand the fundamentals of visible spectroscopy and ultimately improved their expertise in the field of spectroscopy. © 2021 American Chemical Society and Division of Chemical Education, Inc.","Pap, L.

SBD is an important preliminary step in video processing which helps to separate video sequences into shots. Large videos (news, national ceremony, sports, movies, etc.) contain several types of shot transitions (gradual, cut), and to detect them with higher accuracy an efficient SBD method is needed. Previous researchers have proposed methods for SBD by using Supervised machine learning approaches, however, data training is a limitation for them. Some previous papers have proposed unsupervised approaches, however detection for gradual transition shot boundaries has not achieved good accuracy. This paper proposes a distance calculating algorithms for SBD by using principal component analysis (PCA) features and then deep learning method to improve the detection precision of gradual transition shot boundary frames and normal frames. Firstly, PCA is used for feature extraction of the video frames and the most significant Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues are analyzed. Secondly, a distance calculating algorithm is used on the adjacent video frames depending on their Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues to determine the shot boundaries. Finally, to improve detection accuracy, false detection boundaries are reviewed and classified using CNN.

170792,Smart 3D Simulation of Covid-19 for Evaluating the Social Distance Measures,2021,"Study Objectives: Rapid response teams (RRT) aim to reduce morbidity and mortality of hospitalized patients through early intervention on those who are clinically deteriorating. Identifying predictors of early deterioration of patients may improve quality and safety. Abnormal vital signs (VS) have previously been studied as predictors of early deterioration and increased RRT activation after admission from the ED. The primary objective is to identify these predictors of RRT activation within 24 hours of admission. Secondary objectives are to detect differences in hospital length-of-stay (LOS), admitting diagnoses, and 30-day mortality in those with and without RRT (+RRT and –RRT). Last, we examine the predictive value of physician clinical gestalt on RRTs. Methods: This was a prospective, observational case-control study by chart review of adult patients admitted at Kaweah Health Medical Center between December 2020 and March 2021. Exclusion criteria were age <18, admission to ICU, and direct transfer out of the ED. At time of admission, we performed chart review to collect eight VS used to activate a RRT at our hospital. To determine clinician gestalt, the physician was also asked if RRT would occur within 24 hours. Each patient’s hospital course was later reviewed for the occurrence of RRT, admitting diagnoses, LOS, and 30-day mortality. Categorical variables were analyzed using Fisher’s exact test. Noncategorical variables were analyzed using Wilcoxon rank sum test, independent T-test, and Pearson correlation coefficient. Predictive value was analyzed with negative and positive predictive values (NPV and PPV), sensitivity, and specificity. Results: 199 patients met inclusion/exclusion criteria for analysis (+RRT N=3, -RRT N=196). No significant differences were detected in sex, age, or level of care between our groups. The groups differed in median heart rate and respiratory rate, but the difference was insignificant. There was a marginally significant association between COVID-19 as admitting diagnosis and RRT (p=0.052). There was no significant association between RRT and 30-day mortality. Mean LOS did not differ between the groups (p=0.297). The mean number of abnormal VS in those deceased at 30 days (1.2) was significantly higher than those alive at 30 days (0.7) (p=0.047, correlation coefficient r=0.14). Analysis of clinical gestalt on RRT showed PPV 3.2%, NPV 98.8%, sensitivity 33.3%, and specificity 84.5%. Conclusion: Due to small sample size, our results did not show significant differences in sex, age, level of care, heart rate, respiratory rate, or LOS between the +RRT and –RRT groups. However, our study was significant for three findings. First, there was a marginally significant association between an admitting diagnosis of COVID-19 and RRT. Second, patients deceased within 30 days had a significantly higher number of abnormal VS than patients who were alive at 30 days, suggesting a positive correlation. Third, results suggest that the clinical gestalt of emergency physicians at predicting who will not have an RRT is reasonably good, but may not be as good at predicting who will have an RRT. Further studies determining other factors contributing to early deterioration can help craft interventions to improve patient safety. [Formula presented]","Chenpanas, P.; Wells, J.

Determining such immunity may enhance knowledge about susceptibility of HCWs to COVID-19, frequency of vaccine administration, and degree of workplace risk, and may also support enactment of better workplace policies and procedures. The present study reports on 6-months follow-up serosurveillance to determine the longevity of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in HCWs. Sub-sample (n=35) of the original serosurveillance in HCWs (n = 3,458) with baseline, 8-week, and 6-month blood sampling were analyzed. Information on job duties, location, COVID-19 symptoms, polymerase chain reaction test history, travel since January 2020, and household contacts with COVID-19 was collected. Of 35 subjects, 13 were seropositive at baseline and maintained positivity at 8-week follow-up, with 3 losing positivity at 6-month follow-up. Among 22 subjects who were seronegative at baseline and seropositive at 8-week follow-up, all but one maintained positivity at 6-month follow-up. There was no significant effect of all factors (e.g., age, gender, job duties) examined at the .05 level on seropositivity at 6-month follow-up. The observed antibody longevity was 7.0+/-0.6 months for seropositive subjects (n=13), and 4.5+/-0.8 months for those seronegative subjects (n=22), at baseline. The longest duration of seropositivity observed in this cohort was 7.9 months (236 days). With reported COVID-19-related symptoms up to 4.7 months prior to baseline blood sampling, possibly longer antibody presence is suggested. Similarly, seropositivity at 6-month follow-up further suggests greater antibody longevity than observed in this study.","Brant-Zawadzki, M.; Fridman, D.; Robinson, P.

Our Emergency Department (ED) is the only one in Jersey and it serves 40,000 attendances per year. We had unique challenges during the COVID-19 lockdown given staffing levels, paucity of resources and disruption of strategic links with the NHS. Cancellation of all water and air links left our hospital extremely vulnerable to staff sickness with the inability to access additional workers from the UK or other hospitals. Additionally, overnight a solitary FY2 and 3 nurses staff the department. To combat this, four Watches were created for safe and sustainable cover over a 24 hour period in ED. We are unaware of any other Emergency department in the UK using a similar Watch model.MethodEach Watch consisted of 1 consultant, 2 middle grades, 2 SHOs, 1 Sister, 6 Nurses, 1 HCA, and 2 receptionists. Over 12 weeks, a rota of 12-hour shifts, three days on, three days off were used. Watches did not meet each other to minimise any spread of COVID-19 with handover solely being consultant to consultant. A survey was sent to all staff after the 12 weeks enquiring how it affected morale, the treatment of critically ill patients and how much sick leave was taken in this period. Fifty of sixty people responded to the survey.ResultsOver 12 weeks not a single day of sick leave or isolation was taken. 84% of responders felt the watch system improved morale. 90% agreed it improved the treatment for critically ill patients. 88% want to return to the Watch system if a second wave of COVID-19 occurred. 86% agreed it improved communication and teamwork. 96% agreed the presence of a senior doctor 24h/day had a positive effect on the running of the department.ConclusionA watch based system improved patient and staff safety whilst simultaneously improving staff morale and teamwork during the first wave of COVID-19 at Jersey General Hospital.","Jones, Alistair Patel Vishal Wainwright James",BMJ Leader,https://doi.org/10.1136/leader-2020-fmlm.97,719

There are about a million confirmed cases of the infection, and thousands of deaths have been witnessed across 216 countries worldwide as of first week of July 2020. As no approved drugs are currently available for treating COVID-19, it is an alarming situation calling the need to develop alternative therapeutic agents. In order to address the aforementioned need, the underlying mechanism and structural information of SARS-CoV-2 at the molecular level should be understood. The computational biology approaches such as computer-aided virtual screening and molecular modelling provide a significant breakthrough in understanding the structural aspects of various molecular targets of coronavirus and identification novel lead molecules. Natural molecules are one of the probable alternatives as many of these compounds possess ideal drug likeliness and pharmacokinetic features and might probably be used as lead molecules against various targets of SARS-CoV-2. The current chapter provides an overview of different types of coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 and its genetic and structural information, the impact of COVID-19 on various sectors such as health and economy, conventional drugs currently used and their shortcomings, various anti-viral compounds present in nature, the importance of natural lead molecules, computational approaches for molecular modelling of the target proteins, major drug targets that are identified, and virtual screening of herbal-based molecules using molecular docking and molecular dynamic simulation studies.

Second, the interface of ‘soft norms’ and evolving ‘hard norms’: how the UNGPs should inform the proposed BHR treaty. It is argued that legal norms should align with Pillar II only in a ‘loose manner’. They should draw from and build on the HRDD concept under Pillar II, but not be constrained by it, because a hard alignment of Pillar I laws with Pillar II could undercut the independent but complementary status of the two pillars. Moreover, the UNGPs should serve only as a ‘starting point’ and not the ‘end point’ in the evolution of other hard or soft norms in the future. Such an approach would be desirable because the UNGPs alone are unlikely to be enough to challenge or confront the existing structure of irresponsibility and inequality.","Deva, Surya",Business and Human Rights Journal,https://doi.org/10.1017/bhj.2021.23,719

Milvus supports easy-to-use application interfaces (including SDKs and RESTful APIs);optimizes for the heterogeneous computing platform with modern CPUs and GPUs;enables advanced query processing beyond simple vector similarity search;handles dynamic data for fast updates while ensuring efficient query processing;and distributes data across multiple nodes to achieve scalability and availability. We first describe the design and implementation of Milvus. Then we demonstrate the real-world use cases supported by Milvus. In particular, we build a series of 10 applications (e.g., image/video search, chemical structure analysis, COVID-19 dataset search, personalized recommendation, biological multi-factor authentication, intelligent question answering) on top of Milvus. Finally, we experimentally evaluate Milvus with a wide range of systems including two open source systems (Vearch and Microsoft SPTAG) and three commercial systems. Experiments show that Milvus is up to two orders of magnitude faster than the competitors while providing more functionalities. Now Milvus is deployed by hundreds of organizations worldwide and it is also recognized as an incubation-stage project of the LF AI & Data Foundation.

This work presents an outbreak response tool, designed for public health authorities to effectively track suspect, probable and confirmed incidence cases in a pandemic by means of a mobile app used by citizens to provide immediate feedback. It is developed based on an already existing personal health record app, which has been extended to properly accommodate specific needs that emerged during the crisis. The aim is to better support human tracers and should not be confused with proximity tracking apps. It respects safety and security regulations, while at the same time it conforms to international standards and widely accepted medical protocols. Issues relevant to privacy concerns, and interoperability with available patient registries and data analytics tools are also examined to better support public healthcare delivery and contain the spread of the infection.","Katehakis, D.

172357,Laboratories 4.0: Laboratories for emerging demands under industry 4.0 paradigm,2021,"Injudicious consumption of antibiotics in the past few decades has arisen the problem of resistance in pathogenic organisms against most antibiotics and antimicrobial agents. Scenarios of treatment failure are becoming more common in hospitals. This situation demands the frequent need for new antimicrobial compounds which may have other mechanisms of action from those which are in current use. Limonene can be utilized as one of the solutions to the problem of antimicrobial resistance. Limonene is a naturally occurring monoterpene with a lemon-like odor, which mainly present in the peels of citrus plants like lemon, orange, grapefruit, etc. The study aimed to enlighten the antimicrobial properties of limonene as per previous literature. Advantageous contributions have been made by various research groups in the study of the antimicrobial properties of limonene. Previous studies have shown that limonene not only inhibits disease-causing pathogenic microbes, however, it also protects various food products from potential contaminants. This review article contains information about the effectiveness of limonene as an antimicrobial agent. Apart from antimicrobial property, some other uses of limonene are also discussed such as its role as fragrance and flavor additive, as in the formation of nonalcoholic beverages, as solvent and cleaner in the petroleum industry, and as a pesticide. Antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, and anti-biofilm properties of limonene may help it to be used in the future as a potential antimicrobial agent with minimal adverse effects. Some of the recent studies also showed the action of limonene against COVID-19 (Corona virus). However, additional studies are requisite to scrutinize the possible mechanism of antimicrobial action of limonene.

172461,The Impact of COVID–19 on Students’ Economic Life,2021,"The occurrence of infectious diseases may change tourists’ perceptions of a destination’s image and value. This article proposes and empirically tests a choice model to measure the effect of the risk of infectious disease outbreaks caused by climate change on tourists’ willingness to pay for holidays to island destinations. With this aim, an online survey was administrated to 2538 European frequent travellers at their country of residence. Tourists were presented with a hypothetical situation whereby they had to choose among eleven well-known European island destinations for their next holiday. The choice cards included the probability of the occurrence of infectious disease events in the context of other potential risks caused by climate change (i.e., forest fires, floods, heat waves, etc.). The results show infectious disease is the risk that more negatively affects tourists’ willingness to pay to visit islands, followed by forest fires. The results have implications for tourism policy, highlighting the importance of prevention and response strategies, and the design of climate-oriented services, which may raise opportunities to work towards the enhancement of those health and environmental conditions of tourist destinations that ensure their sustainability in the longer term.","León, Carmelo J.; Carmen García, Galindo González Hernández Matías M.",Atmosphere,https://doi.org/10.3390/atmos11101117,719

ULS-Guarda in cooperation with Portugal National Health Service, provided the population of the district of Guarda with a mental health helpline (MHHL).ObjectivesProvide a descriptive data analysis of the MHHL calls received between April 1st and September 20th of 2020.MethodsThe data was obtained through the filling out of questionnaires. It included fields for gender, age, the type of service provided, relation to COVID-19, symptoms displayed and the number calls made per patient. For the statistical analysis, Microsoft Excel TM was utilized.ResultsMHHL received 191 calls. The largest volume was received during April, which saw 116 instances of patients seeking the MHHL. The number of calls then tapered progressively throughout the following months. The services provided were split between psychiatric assistance, psychologic assistance, and the renovation of medical prescriptions, in 44%, 31% and 19% of the cases, respectively. The 101 patients who resorted to the MHHL were unevenly distributed in gender, being 74 female and 27 male individuals. Their ages were mostly between 50 and 69 years old. The most common symptoms were anxiety, depressed humor and insomnia, in 35%, 16% and 11% of the cases, respectively.ConclusionsThe largest influx of calls coincides with the home confinement period, and decreased alongside the relaxation of the confinement measures held. The MHHL had enough adherence to warrant consideration of it being an alternative means of healthcare access, especially in situations where physical access to healthcare is restricted.","Jesus, B.; Ramos, S.

A good understanding and knowledge of the disease is indispensable for the management of infection spread and for effective control measures. The aim of the study was to conduct a rapid online survey for evaluating the COVID 19 knowledge, misconceptions and practices among the non-medical college students in Tamil Nadu. An online cross sectional survey was conducted using Google forms involving 414 participants, who were college students from Tamil Nadu and were not related to health sciences courses. The questionnaire consisted of 4 sections to gauge the demographic details, COVID 19 knowledge, misconceptions and practices. The completed questionnaire was submitted by the students from the period of 6th July 2020 to 18th July 2020.The total responses received were 426 out of which 414 valid responses were taken into account. The female respondents of the study accounted for 57.2%. The Knowledge score was good except for the variable responses in case of knowledge regarding transmission from asymptomatic persons. This study reports considerable percentage of existing misconceptions and sensible practices being followed as advised by the government and health department. In general, the college students' level of COVID 19 knowledge was satisfactory, yet we could find inconsistencies in the fallacies and practices among them. Such online surveys can shed light upon the need for measures to increase the awareness and to improve practices during the rapid outbreak of COVID 19.","Dhanaraj, Vijayalakshmi Natarajan Gowdhaman Asha J.; Revathy, P.

173085,Homogeneous Student Engagement: A Strategy for Group Formation During Online Learning,2021,"HIV-1 infection gives rise to a multilayered immune impairment in most infected individuals. The crosstalk between Dendritic cells and T cells plays an important part in the induction of immune responses. The chronic presence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 during the dendritic cells (DCs) priming and activation of T cells promotes the expansion of suppressor cells in a contact dependent manner. The mechanism behind the T cell side of this HIV induced impairment is well studied, whereas little is known about the reverse effects exerted on the DCs in this setting. Here we assessed the phenotype and transcriptome profile of mature DCs that have been in contact with suppressive T cells. The DCs in the HIV exposed DC-T cell coculture obtained a more tolerogenic/suppressive phenotype with increased expression of e.g., PDL1, Gal-9, HVEM, and B7H3, mediated by their cellular interaction with T cells. The transcriptomic analysis showed a clear type I IFN response profile as well as an activation of pathways involved in T cell exhaustion. Taken together, our data indicate that the prolonged and strong IFN type I signaling induced by the presence of HIV during DC-T cell cross talk could play an important role in the induction of the tolerogenic DCs and suppressed immune response.","Svanberg, Cecilia; Nyström, Sofia; Govender, Melissa; Bhattacharya, Pradyot; Che, Karlhans F; Ellegård, Rada; Shankar, Esaki M; Larsson, Marie",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.01.458353,719

These measures have proven effective in mitigating outbreaks. As a greater fraction of the population becomes vaccinated, we need to understand what continued benefit, if any, proactive testing can contribute. Here, we address this problem with two distinct modeling approaches: a simple analytical model and a more simulation using the SEIRS+ platform. Both models indicate that proactive testing remains useful until a threshold level of vaccination is reached. This threshold depends on the transmissibility of the virus and the scope of other control measures in place. If a community is able to reach the threshold level of vaccination, testing can cease. Otherwise, continued testing will be an important component of disease control. Because it is usually difficult or impossible to precisely estimate key parameters such as the basic reproduction number for a specific workplace or other setting, our results are more useful for understanding general trends than for making precise quantitative predictions.","McGee, R.

A range of indicator-based frameworks have been developed, focusing on general city economic competitiveness, yet these are often disconnected from the actual city operation and processes relevant to the investment cycle of SE projects. This paper proposes an integrated methodology for developing a City Capability Assessment Framework focusing on city planning, financing, and implementation capacity for SE projects. A principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to the results of a European city-survey to uncover areas highly relevant for the successful implementation of local SE projects. The insights gained aid policymakers to better understand implementation barriers, leading to the development of more effective actions and policy interventions towards the implementation of SE projects. The proposed framework can further enhance cities’ efforts with the implementation of local SE projects and guide potential investors to properly evaluate city capabilities and potential, when choosing local investment projects.","Niki-Artemis, Spyridaki Kleanthis Nikos Tzani Dimitra Matosović Mia Dragović Flamos Alexandros",Sustainability,https://doi.org/10.3390/su12208447,719

At present, the problem of epidemic prediction is concerned by the whole world in this field. In this paper;a prediction algorithm of autocorrelation sequence based on transformation is proposed. It construct a reference function based on the time series of regions that have experienced the whole process of epidemic situation. The reference function coordinates are transformed with the incomplete observation data of other regions as the supervision. Under the condition that the cost of transformation is kept as small as possible, the transformed-function can effectively predict the series values that are not observed in other regions. This algorithm needs a little data and has good training stability. On this basis, we study how to use the information provided by other exogenous variables on the basis of autocorrelation prediction to make the model achieve better results. We use the covid-19 epidemic data set provided by Baidu to test our model, and the results show that it has good fitting metrics.

While mandatory mask bylaws are rooted in the interest of public safety, accessibility challenges for persons with disabilities need to be considered to ensure full participation in society. This communiqué highlights some key considerations for implementation of inclusive mandatory mask guidelines. The City of Calgary and other jurisdictions are implementing a bylaw that mandates face coverings be worn in public transit, public vehicles for hire, public indoor space and City public facilities. There are a number of important considerations for persons with disability in regard to acquisition of face masks, public participation, and enforcement of mask-wearing policies. Without inclusive design and clear communication, mandatory mask bylaws may produce numerous barriers to social re-entry for persons with disabilities. Such barriers include unequal access to face masks, social stigma, exclusion from public spaces, and disproportionate questioning or penalization (Williamson and Whaley 2020). As the economy re-opens, it is important to ensure the safety of all Albertans. While mandatory face mask bylaws have evidence to support effectiveness in slowing transmission, safe economic re-launch must be inclusive of persons with disabilities, a demographic that has been inequitably burdened by the effects of COVID-19 and unduly overlooked in pandemic response and recovery planning.","Kohek, Jessica Ash Seth Edwards Meaghan Zwicker Jennifer",The School of Public Policy Publications (SPPP),https://doi.org/10.11575/sppp.v13i0.70911,719

Evidence-based prevention and treatment strategies targeting early-life stress are emerging. Nevertheless, faculty physicians' preparation to incorporate this science into practice has not been well studied. The purpose of this study was to explore medical faculty knowledge and beliefs, timing and route of knowledge acquisition, perceived relevance and application of topics, and any associated faculty characteristics. Method The research team developed and administered a 39-question survey to faculty from six departments at the University of Illinois College of Medicine and Rush Medical College in Chicago. The team employed quantitative and qualitative methods to analyze responses. Results Eighty-one (8.8%) eligible faculty completed the survey. Of respondents, 53 (65.4%) achieved a high score on knowledge questions, 34 (42.0%) on beliefs questions, and 42 (59.1%) described high concept exposure, but only six (7.4%) through a formal route. Although 78 (96.8%) respondents indicated that survey concepts are relevant, only 18 (22.2%) reported fully incorporating them in their work. Respondents reporting full incorporation of concepts were significantly more likely to attain high concept exposure scores than those not fully incorporating concepts (17 respondents, 94.4%, vs. 25 respondents, 39.7 %, P < .001), whether reporting formal or informal exposure. Both quantitative and qualitative analysis highlighted limited awareness among respondents of trauma prevalence among healthcare workers, lack of familiarity with interventions, and challenges in addressing childhood experiences given time and resource constraints. Conclusions Most respondents had some familiarity with the impact of childhood experiences on health and perceived the relevance of this science. Nonetheless, many identified the need for additional coaching. Because results suggest that exposure supports full application of concepts, intentional faculty development and establishment of medical education competencies is pivotal to prepare faculty to include these crucial topics in patient care and teaching.","Koo, A.; Irwin, J.; Sturgis, M.

Prokaryotic expression of recombinant PDCoV partial spike (S) protein was used as detection antigen, and an indirect ELISA antibody detection method based on PDCoV S1 protein was established. The method was used to detect 570 serum samples collected from some pig farms in Hebei from January to December 2017. The results showed that the established ELISA method of PDCoV IgG antibody in this study could specifically detect PDCoV antibody; no cross-reaction with antisera against porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), classical swine fever (CSF) and pseudorabies virus (PRV) was found. The coefficients of variation (CV) of repeated in-batch test was 1.9%-5.4%, CV of batch-to-batch test was 2.3%-5.1%. In 570 blood samples, 105 were positive, and the positive rate was 18.4% (105/570), which was higher than the positive rate of PDCoV IgG antibody (11%) in Hebei from January 2016 to October 2016. It is suggested that the infection rate of PDCoV in Hebei is on the rise. The ELISA method established in this study had the advantages of high sensitivity, strong specificity and good reproducibility, and can be used for the detection of clinical PDCoV serum antibodies.Copyright © 2019, Chinese Journal of Animal Science and Veterinary Medicine Co., Ltd.

While digital contact tracing was proven to be an efficient method to mitigate transmission, the security and privacy of the user data remains a major concern. In this paper we focused on digital tracing application data privacy issues and proposed Cryptographic Accumulator based Privacy Preserving Exposure Notification module (CAPEN). In the CAPEN module we used an asymmetric cryptographic accumulator and greatest common divisor (gcd) function to provide privacy for the user data while providing accurate verification. Additionally, the CAPEN module has a significantly lower communication complexity while sharing larger datasets.

This kind of assessment is overcome some of the limitations in the paper-based assessment. One of the advantages of an electronic assessment (e-assessment) is the ability to provide feedback to the student immediately. Most of the universities around the world were providing e-learning to their students as a development option for the education process, on condition that they attend to take the exam in the universities in attendance. But in the Corona crisis, this thing was not possible, especially in subjects that have very large number of students, so (e-assessment) has become a basic option for most universities in order to achieve the principle of social distancing.

175110,IoT cloud-based framework using of smart integration to control the spread of COVID-19,2021,"Wildfire management in the US relies on a complex nationwide network of shared resources that are allocated based on regional need. While this network bolsters firefighting capacity, it may also provide pathways for COVID-19 transmission between fire sites. We develop an agent-based model of COVID-19 built on historical wildland fire assignments using detailed dispatch data from 2016-2018, which form a network of firefighters dispersed spatially and temporally across the US. We use this model to simulate SARS-CoV-2 transmission under several intervention scenarios including vaccination and social distancing. We find vaccination and social distancing are effective at reducing transmission at fire incidents. Under a scenario assuming High Compliance with recommended mitigations (including vaccination), infection rates, number of outbreaks, and worker days missed are effectively negligible. Under a contrasting Low Compliance scenario, it is possible for cascading outbreaks to emerge leading to relatively high numbers of worker days missed. The current set of interventions in place successfully mitigate the risk of cascading infections between fires, and off-assignment infection may be the dominant infection concern in the 2021 season.

175286,Teaching operating systems in the time of COVID-19,2021,"Healthcare is one of the basic needs for human beings. Unfortunately, a densely populated country like Bangladesh has always struggled to provide adequate healthcare to all of its people, especially to the rural population. To handle with huge amount of data and coordination between the doctors and patients, electronic health record system (EHR) has become a necessity. During this Covid-19 pandemic, face to face consultation between frontline workers like doctors, and nurse and patients has become difficult. As a result, many patients are having difficulty in getting treatment from doctors. In Bangladesh's perspective at this moment, a cost effective, energy efficient and portable device system is needed to build up a customized Electronic health record system. The proposed system can reduce medical errors about patient identification and treatment, increase effectiveness and timeliness of doctors and overall improve the health care of people of the rural area Therefore, an easy to use, affordable, user-friendly and customized EHR system design is proposed in this paper by utilizing recent wireless communication techniques that can give the rural people better health service during lockdown / isolated condition as imposed due to pandemic scenario. © 2021 AIUB Office of Research and Publication.

175738,Automated Contact Tracing using Person Tracking and Re-Identification,2021,"Human behaviour follows a 24-hour rhythm and is known to be governed by the individual chronotypes. Due to the widespread use of technology in our daily lives, it is possible to record the activities of individuals through their different digital traces. In the present study we utilise a large mobile phone communication dataset containing time stamps of calls and text messages to study the circadian rhythms of anonymous users in a European country. After removing the effect of the synchronization of East-West sun progression with the calling activity, we used two closely related approaches to heuristically compute the chronotypes of the individuals in the dataset, to identify them as morning persons or “larks” and evening persons or “owls”. Using the computed chronotyes we showed how the chronotype is largely dependent on age with younger cohorts being more likely to be owls than older cohorts. Moreover, our analysis showed how on average females have distinctly different chronotypes from males. Younger females are more larkish than males while older females are more owlish. Finally, we also studied the period of low calling activity for each of the users which is considered as a marker of their sleep period during the night. We found that while “extreme larks” tend to sleep more than “extreme owls” on the weekends, we do not observe much variation between them on weekdays. In addition, we have observed that women tend to sleep even less than males on weekdays while there is not much difference between them on the weekends.","Roy, Chandreyee; Monsivais, Daniel; Bhattacharya, Kunal; Dunbar, Robin I.M.; Kaski, Kimmo",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.24.432651,719

176853,Polarizing effect: Challenges of an accelerated digitalization caused by Sars-Cov-2,2021,"Many of the most common disinfectant and sanitizer products are formulations of multiple antimicrobial compounds. Products claiming to contain synergistic formulations are common, although there is often little supporting evidence. The antimicrobial interactions of all pairwise combinations of common disinfectants (benzalkonium chloride, didecyldimethylammonium chloride, polyhexamethylene biguanide, chlorocresol and bronopol) were classified via checkerboard and validated by time-kill analyses. Combinations were tested against Acinetobacter baumannii NCTC 12156, Enterococcus faecalis NCTC 13379, Klebsiella pneumoniae NCTC 13443 and Staphylococcus aureus NCTC 13143. Synergistic interactions were only identified between cholorocresol with benzalkonium chloride, and chlorocresol with polyhexamethylene biguanide. Synergism was not ubiquitously demonstrated against all species tested and was on the borderline of the synergism threshold. These data demonstrate that synergism between disinfectants is uncommon and circumstantial. Most of the antimicrobial interactions tested were characterised as additive. We suggest that this is due to the broad, non-specific mechanisms associated with disinfectants not providing opportunity for the combined activities of these compounds to exceed the sum of their parts. IMPORTANCE The scarcity of observed synergistic interactions suggests that many disinfectant-based products may be misinterpreting combined mechanisms of interaction. We emphasise the need to correctly differentiate between additivity and synergism in antimicrobial formulations, as inappropriate classification may lead to unnecessary issues in the event of regulatory changes. Furthermore, we question the need to focus on synergism and disregard additivity when considering combinations of disinfectants, as the benefits that synergistic interactions provide are not necessarily relevant to the application of the final product.","Noel, Daniel J.; Keevil, C.

Through a comprehensive literature review, we first identified two broad categories of factors, namely exhibition attributes and exhibitor perceptions, that influence exhibitor satisfaction and loyalty. Next, a meta-analysis was conducted based on 26 empirical papers studying the Chinese exhibition market to quantitatively evaluate these relationships. The results show that among the exhibition attributes, booth management, service personnel, and exhibition environment are the most important factors affecting exhibitor satisfaction, while exhibition brand is the most important factor affecting loyalty. Among exhibitor perceptions, service quality is more important for satisfaction, while perceived value is more meaningful to loyalty. This study offers insights into strategies for exhibition organizers to cultivate long-term relationships, and to better cope with the challenges of emerging forces such as the Internet.","Liu, Linyan Zheng Xiang Liu Yuyao Zach Florian J.; McGehee, Nancy",Sustainability,https://doi.org/10.3390/su12208390,719

We experienced that radical impact given that we were amid efforts to restructure one of our courses in March, 2020. That restructuring, which focused on improved cooperative learning, would have required contact-based education. The sudden COVID-based shift to online learning limited the opportunities for cooperation, mutual knowledge sharing, and inspiration. Students needed more intensive stimulus to stay involved and active. We understood that more focus on evaluation helps educators to obtain better insight into the learning progress of students and to adapt the educational processes to improve students' learning outcomes and their learning journey. We realized that traditional end-of-course evaluation alone does not suffice the new requirements of online education. We saw a need for continuous evaluations during the course to monitor the learning trajectory that students followed. In this paper, we share our experience about the changing role of evaluation due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and describe how evaluating effectiveness, success, efficiency impacts the online work with students.","Abcouwer, T.; Takacs, E.; Solymosy, J.",Communications of the Association for Information Systems,https://doi.org/10.17705/1cais.04825,719

COVID-19 infection, which seemed to be respiratory infection at the beginning of pandemic, involves different systems of organs. One of the most vulnerable systems is cardiovascular system, due to the specific mechanism of viral entrance, endothelial damage, and the immune response of the human body. The aim of our study is to present our own case report of cardiac involvement in COVID-19 and to review literature on this topic. Presentation of the case. We presents a case of COVID-associated myocarditis in a patient. The diagnosis was established after we revealed decrease of left ventricular contractility after COVID-19, elevated C-reactive protein, absence of new ischemic ECG changes. We managed the patient with anti-inflammatory treatment and anticoagulation. Discussion. In the review we analyzed mechanisms of the cardiovascular system impairment in COVID-19, possible scenario of clinical manifestation of cardiac complications, diagnostic methods and recommendation for treatment. Conclusion. Cardiovascular complications in COVID-19 are presented with 2 groups of pathology. The first is vascular pathology, due to endothelial damage and hypercoagulation (pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, stroke). Myocarditis is a different cardiac complication of COVID-19. Anticoagulation and anti-inflammatory treatment are the cornerstone in the treatment of cardiac comoplication in COVID-19. © Nelya Oryshchyn, Yurii Ivaniv, 2020.","Oryshchyn, N.; Ivaniv, Y.",Proceedings of the Shevchenko Scientific Society.

177261,Cross-disciplinary perspectives on the transition to remote education,2021,"The ecological conditions experienced by wildlife reservoir hosts affect the amount of pathogen they excrete into the environment. This then shapes pathogen pressure, the amount of pathogen available to recipient hosts over space and time, which affects spillover risk. Few systems have data on both long-term ecological conditions and pathogen pressure, yet such data are critical for advancing our mechanistic understanding of ecological drivers of spillover risk. To identify these ecological drivers, we here reanalyze shedding data from a spatially replicated, multi-year study of Hendra virus excretion from Australian flying foxes in light of 25 years of long-term data on changing ecology of the bat reservoir hosts. Using generalized additive mixed models, we show that winter virus shedding pulses, previously considered idiosyncratic, are most pronounced after recent food shortages and in bat populations that have been displaced to novel habitats. We next derive the area under each annual shedding curve (representing cumulative virus excretion) and show that pathogen pressure is also affected by the ecological conditions experienced by bat populations. Finally, we illustrate that pathogen pressure positively predicts observed spillover frequency. Our study suggests that recent ecological conditions of flying fox hosts are shifting the timing, magnitude, and cumulative intensity of Hendra virus shedding in ways that shape the landscape of spillover risk. This work provides a mechanistic approach to understanding and estimating risk of spillover from reservoir hosts in complex ecological systems and emphasizes the importance of host ecological context in identifying the determinants of pathogen shedding.","Becker, Daniel J.; Eby, Peggy; Madden, Wyatt; Peel, Alison J.; Plowright, Raina K.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.19.457011,719

178208,"A Comparative Analysis of Euclidean, Jaccard and Cosine Similarity Measure and Arabic Wordnet for Automated Arabic Essay Scoring",2021,"Background: Viral culture is currently the most accurate method to demonstrate viability and infectivity of Severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-2 CoV). Routine clinical diagnosis, however, is mostly performed by PCR - based assays that do not discriminate between infectious and non-virus. Herein, we aimed to determine the correlation between positive viral cultures and either PCR positivity, the Cycle Threshold (Ct) or the number of viral copies. Methods: A systematic electronic literature search was performed and studies that reported both viral SARS-CoV-2 culture and PCR-based assays were included. A separate search for samples from blood, urine, stool, breast milk and tears were performed. To convert Ct values reported in the reviewed studies were to viral genomic copies, calibration experiments with four different reaction performed, using quantified RNA molecules. Results: A total 540 articles were reviewed, and 38 studies were included in this review. Out of 276 positive-culture of non-severe patients, 272 (98.55%) were negative ten days after symptoms onset, while PCR assays remained positive for up to 67 days. In severely ill or immunocompromised patients positive-culture was obtained up to 32 days and out of 168 cultures, 31 (18.45%) stayed positive after day 10. In non-severe patients, in Ct value greater than 30 only 10.8% were still culture-positive while in Ct >35 it was nearly universally negative. The minimal calculated number of viral genome copies in culture- positive sample was 2.5 X 103 copies / mL. These findings were similar in immunocompromised patients. Recovering positive culture from non-respiratory samples was sporadically obtained in stool or urine samples. Conversion of Ct values to viral genome copies showed variability between different PCR assays and highlighted the need to standardize reports to correctly compare results obtained in different laboratories. Conclusion: During the pandemic phase, non-severe COVID-19 patients who are recovering and are not immuno-suppressed, can be regarded as non-infectious, within 10 days from symptom onset, or with Ct value greater than 35 (or a calculated viral load lower than 1.2X103 copies / mL). These findings have important implications for recovering patients and asymptomatic patients, with respect to isolation criteria. The conversion of Cq values to viral genome copies described herein may be useful in future work, enabling a more standardized comparison between results reported in different studies from different laboratories.","rozenberg, g.; Erster, O.; Ghersin, I.; Mandelboim, M.; neuberger, A.; Schwartz, E.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.08.23.21262162v1?rss=1,719

Furthermore, small structural variations in a single fold, which may only be a few amino acids different from the next homolog, define their molecular function. Hence, to design proteins with novel molecular functionalities, such as molecular recognition, methods to control and sample shape diversity are necessary. To explore this space, we developed and experimentally validated a computational platform that can design a wide variety of small protein folds while sampling high shape diversity. We designed and evaluated about 30,000 de novo protein designs of 7 different folds. Among these designs, about 6,200 stable proteins were identified, with predicted structures having first-of-its-kind minimalized thioredoxin. Obtained data revealed more protein folding rules, such as helix connecting loops, which were in nature. Beyond providing a resource database for protein engineering, our data presents a large training data set for machine learning. We developed a high-accuracy classifier to predict the stability of our designed proteins. The methods and the wide range of new protein shapes provide a basis for the design of new protein function without compromising stability.","Linsky, T; Noble, K; Tobin, A; Crow, R; Carter, Lauren; Urbauer, J; Baker, D; Strauch, EM",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.10.434454,719
178336,Development of interactive learning multimedia for mathematics subjects for grade 5 elementary schools,2021,"Purpose: The paper combines the systems theoretical perspective on the evolution of societal differentiation and the emergence of codes in communication. By combining the approach by Niklas Luhmann with a historical theology on the development of Christian morality split between God and Devil, it recreates a sociological point of observation on contemporary moral forms by a temporary occupation of the retired Christian Devil. Design/methodology/approach: The article combines a Luhmannian systems theoretical perspective on the evolution of societal differentiation with a concept of emerging codes in communication. The latter is based on on the development of a Christian view of morality being split between God and Devil. It establishes a sociological point of observation on contemporary moral forms through the temporary invocation of the retired figure of the Christian Devil. Findings: The proposed perspective develops a healthy perspective on the exuberant distribution of a health(y) morality across the globe during the pandemic crisis of 2020–21. The temporary invocation of the retired Christian Devil as point of departure in this sociological analysis allows for a disturbing view on the unlimited growth of the morality of health and its inherent dangers of dedifferentiating the highly specialised forms of societal differentiation and organisation. Originality/value: By applying the diabolical perspective, the analytical framework creates a unique opportunity to observe the moral encodings of semantic forms in detail, while keeping the freedom of scientific enquiry to choose amongst available distinctions in the creation of sound empirical knowledge. This article adopts a neutral stance, for the good of sociological analysis. The applications of the term “evil” to observations of communication are indifferent to anything but itself and its qualities as scientific enquiry. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Clausen, L.",Kybernetes,https://doi.org/10.1108/k-02-2021-0155,719

Results: Evaluation was made of 130 COVID-19-positive paediatric patients, comprising 69 (53%) males and 61 (47%) females, of which 54% were asymptomatic and 5.4% had severe clinical findings requiring follow up in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Of the symptomatic patients, fever was determined in 30%, listlessness in 24%, cough in 10.8%, respiratory problems in 9.2%, diarrhea in 6.2%, abdominal pain in 6.2%, vomiting in 2.3%, joint pain in 2.3%, and convulsions developed in 1.5% who had no previous history of convulsions. Of the 7 patients who required intensive care, 2 had cerebral palsy, 1 had hydrocephaly+shunt, 1 had metabolic disease (propionic acidemia), 2 had a history of trauma (struck by a motor vehicle), and in 1 there was no comorbidity. Mortality developed in 6 of the 7 patients in ICU. Conclusion: In a significant proportion of children, COVID-19 has an asymptomatic course, which contributes greatly to the spread of the disease. While COVID-19 can cause morbidities such as convulsions in the paediatric population, it may also result in mortality in children with underlying serious diseases. © 2021 by Author/s and Licensed by Modestum.","Gumus, H.; Ozcan, Y.; Kazanasmaz, H.; Demir, A.; Guzelcicek, A.",Electronic Journal of General Medicine,https://doi.org/10.29333/ejgm/11019,719

The viruses are notorious for mutations in them. Novel coronavirus is no exception to mutation and mutated into various strains according to geographical locations. Summary: The recent second and third wave which is actually a resurgence in COVID-19 cases after a steep fall is attributed to the mutation that is occurring in novel coronavirus. Various strains has been isolated and is being under study to tackle their menace. But blaming completely the mutant version of the virus is unjust as there are other factors such as lax implementation of preventive measures, negligence on account of people by not wearing masks and not following physical distancing. The impact of COVID-19 on human organ system is almost negative and affects the functioning of the organ adversely. Therefore proper care must be taken to ensure the safety of oneself. Conclusion: Mutations in viruses cannot be stopped and solution lies within us. By following preventive measures and guidelines issued by WHO and other competent authority can a key to keep oneself self. Also balance diet along with proper exercise can help in these pandemic.

180861,Bilingual Emotion Analysis on Social Media throughout the COVID19 Pandemic in Portugal,2021,"Background: COVID19 due to SARS-CoV-2 infection implies an important anti-viral immune response leading to a major inflammatory syndrome with increased pro-inflammatory cytokine levels (i.e. the cytokine storm paradigm). The impact of a preexisting interstitial lung disease (ILD) on the morbi-mortality of COVID-19 is unclear. An increased mortality rate has been identified in studies that included a limited number of patients with ILD from various etiologies. To date, no studies have investigated the severity of COVID-19 in patients with preexisting ILD in a large population of rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMD-ILD). Since March 18th, 2020, the French RMD COVID19 dataset (NCT04353609) includes patients with an RMD and SARS-Cov-2 infection. Objectives: To assess the impact of a preexisting ILD on COVID-19 morbi-mortality within the French RMD COVID-19 dataset. Methods: Patients from the French RMD COVID-19 dataset were included in the analysis. COVID-19 diagnosis was established by a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test and/or typical symptoms or chest CT scans pattern during the period of the pandemic. Baseline phenotypic characteristics of the RMD including pre-existing ILD prior to the SARS-CoV-2 infection were collected. COVID-19 evolution was characterized as benign (ambulatory care), moderate (hospitalization outside intensive care unit [ICU]) and severe (hospitalization in ICU). Association between the ILD status and the severity and mortality rate of COVID-19 was assessed using multivariable logistic regression adjusted on sex, age, body mass index and diabetes. Results: By June 26, 2020, 897 patients were included. Pre-existing ILD was reported in 27 patients (3%): 11 patients with systemic sclerosis, 8 with rheumatoid arthritis, 2 with auto-immune myositis, 2 with mixed connective tissue disease and 4 with other RMD. Among these 27 patients (11 male, mean age 63.1 ± 16.4 y/o, 56.5% having a usual interstitial pneumonia HRCT pattern), 22 had severe infection. Death related to COVID-19, was observed in 58 patients with RMD without ILD (7.1%) and in 10 patients with RMD-ILD (37%). Having a preexisting ILD was found to be independently associated with an increased risk of severe COVID-19 (adjusted OR=7.6 [2.9 -20.2], P<0.001) and an increased mortality rate (adjusted OR=12.3 [3.8 -39.2], P<0.001). Conclusion: In RMD patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, preexisting ILD was associated with an increased risk to severe COVID-19 and related mortality. Our findings suggest that RMD-ILD patients should be prioritized for COVID-19 vaccination according to the high morbi-mortality rate during SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Juge, P.

Recently, a number of imputation methods have emerged for single-cell transcriptome data, however, recovering missing values in very sparse expression matrices remains a substantial challenge. Here, we propose a new algorithm, WEDGE (WEighted Decomposition of Gene Expression), to impute gene expression matrices by using a biased low-rank matrix decomposition method (bLRMD). WEDGE successfully recovered expression matrices, reproduced the cell-wise and gene-wise correlations, and improved the clustering of cells, performing impressively for applications with multiple cell type datasets with high dropout rates. Overall, this study demonstrates a potent approach for imputing sparse expression matrix data, and our WEDGE algorithm should help many researchers to more profitably explore the biological meanings embedded in their scRNA-seq datasets.","Hu, Yinlei; Li, Bin; Zhang, Wen; Liu, Nianping; Cai, Pengfei; Chen, Falai; Qu, Kun",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/864488,719

181186,Promoting computational thinking through visual block programming tools,2021,"Background Patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are faced with severe disease-related fatigue among a range of other constitutional and spleen-related symptoms. The MPN-Symptom Assessment Form (SAF) is recommended for use to characterize symptom burden (Scherber R, et al. Blood 2011). Within the SAF, a profile of 18 symptom items are evaluated ranging in severity from 0 (absent) to 10 (worst imaginable). The SAF is often summarized to the MPN-SAF Total Symptom Score (TSS) for analysis purposes - a single computed sum of the 10 most clinically meaningful symptom scores, including fatigue (Emanuel R, et al. J Clin Oncol 2012). Though the SAF includes a fatigue item, initial deployments of the MPN-SAF TSS incorporated a 0-10 scaled fatigue item taken from the Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI;Mendoza T, et al. Cancer 1999). A subsequent version of the MPN-SAF TSS for use within myelofibrosis clinical trials (called the MFSAF v4;Gwaltney C, et al. Leuk Res 2017) employed a harmonized fatigue item. This analysis employing data from two studies was carried out to assess the use of the SAF fatigue item within the MPN-SAF TSS for consistency with the MFSAF v4. Methods Both BFI and SAF fatigue items were included in an initial online survey evaluating disease burden among patients with MPNs. Participants were assigned to survey variants as a function of their age. Survey variants included those to receive 1 instance of either the BFI or SAF fatigue item, instances of both BFI and SAF, or 2 instances of the same fatigue item. Surveying was aimed to assess the worst symptom experience in the patient's last 24 hours. Additionally, an independent survey assessing the impact of COVID-19 among MPN patients was deployed using the SAF fatigue item for the MPN-SAF TSS. This modified version was then used to test internal validity. Pearson correlation (r) and t-tests were used to assess association, Bland-Altman methods were used to evaluate systematic agreement between BFI and SAF fatigue scores, and Cronbach's alpha was used to measure internal consistency. Results There were 229 participants assigned both BFI and SAF fatigue items within the same survey. Among them, 51% (n=117) received the BFI item first and 49% (n=112) the SAF item first. No difference was seen between first and second fatigue scores (mean difference [first-second] = 0.00;95%CI -0.18, 0.17). BFI and SAF fatigue scores were highly correlated (r=0.88, p<0.001) and showed 88.7% agreement in categorizing severe versus non-severe fatigue (score ≥ 7 versus < 7). Overall concordance in severity category was 73.4% (category [score range]: absent [0];mild [1-3];moderate [4-6];severe [7-10]). Constructing the MPN-SAF TSS using the BFI and SAF fatigue components separately, the original and modified MPN-SAF TSS were nearly identical (r=0.997, p<0.001), and had equivalent internal consistency (both Cronbach's alpha=0.88). The Bland-Altman plot further indicates the 2 fatigue measures have high agreement with no evidence of directional bias and negligible overall bias (Figure 1: regression slope = -0.04, p=0.25;mean difference=0.22;95%CI 0.05, 0.39). Within the COVID-19 survey (n=1217), the modified version of the MPN-SAF TSS was consistent with known correlates among disease characteristics (Emanuel R, et al. J Clin Oncol 2012). For example, more severe MPN-SAF TSS scores were highly correlated with low quality-of-life (n=1156, r = -0.50, p<0.001), and associated with those reporting spleen enlargement (n=301) versus not (n=617) (p<0.001;mean difference=7.7;95%CI 5.4, 10.1). Conclusion The BFI and SAF fatigue items are highly consistent in raw score, severity category, and in contribution to the MPN-SAF TSS. There was no order effect seen in which fatigue item was asked first. The independent COVID-19 survey using the modified MPN-SAF TSS was validated and shows high internal consistent. In the ongoing development to capture the symptom experience, this analysis shows disease-related fatigue is equivalently measured using the SAF fatigue survey item in h rmonization with the MFSAF v4.

At the same time, we do not yet have a deep understanding of if and how communication needs amongst family and friends change as a result of physical distancing and travel restrictions and how technologies could be better designed to support these needs. For these reasons, we conducted an exploratory study to investigate the use of communication technologies and family communication needs during the first fourth months of the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada. We used contextual interviews with 18 participants and an open-ended survey with 12 respondents. Our results show that people began the pandemic with a period of shifting and trialing new communication practices;this included increased communications with family and friends. People tried to recreate in-person situations with large group video calls beyond the typical two-household connection found pre-pandemic. This created challenges related to control and participation, and saw people explore ways to increase a sense of shared atmosphere over distance with efforts to increase physicality. Yet large amounts of technology use generally did not persist as participants abandoned many forms of online interaction over time in a form of technology detachment and sometimes cleanse. These results point to design lessons for times of extreme disconnection between family and friends, such as during a pandemic, where control, participation, and atmosphere receive deep consideration. © 2021 ACM.","Heshmat, Y.; Neustaedter, C.","2021 ACM Designing Interactive Systems Conference: Nowhere and Everywhere, DIS 2021",https://doi.org/10.1145/3461778.3462022,719

It is not certain how the presence of other metabolic factors and comorbidities influences HCC risk in HBV. Therefore we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to seek evidence for significant associations. Methods: MEDLINE, Embase and Web of Science databases were searched from 1st January 2000 to 24th June 2020 for English studies investigating associations of metabolic factors and comorbidities with HCC risk in individuals with chronic HBV infection. We extracted data for meta-analysis and report pooled effect estimates from a fixed-effects model. Pooled estimates from a random-effects model were also generated if significant heterogeneity was present. Results: We identified 40 observational studies reporting on associations of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipiaemia and obesity with HCC risk. Meta-analysis was possible for only diabetes mellitus due to the limited number of studies. Diabetes mellitus was associated with >25% increase in hazards of HCC (fixed effects Hazards Ratio [HR] 1.26, 95% CI 1.20-1.32, random effects HR 1.36, 95% CI 1.23-1.49). This association was attenuated towards the null in sensitivity analysis restricted to studies adjusted for metformin use. Conclusions: In adults with chronic HBV infection, diabetes mellitus is a significant risk factor for HCC, but further investigation of how antidiabetic drug use and glycaemic control influence this association is needed. Enhanced screening of individuals with HBV and diabetes may be warranted.","Campbell, C.; Wang, T.; McNaughton, A. L.; Barnes, E.; Matthews, P.

181676,Does our collective stringency control the virus? Investigating lockdown effectiveness on community mobility data,2021,"This study examines the relationship between good governance and pandemic control using month-wise COVID-19 pandemic data within a time window from April to September 2020. The study argues that countries with better governance are more capable of adopting and implementing appropriate policies and that such governments are considered more trustworthy by their people. Combined, these factors enable such countries to better control a pandemic like COVID-19. Using several measures of good governance and two measures of pandemic spread, namely the COVID-19 positive rate and the COVID-19 growth rate, this paper tests its argument econometrically in a sample of 185 countries. The results show the existence of a significant inverse relationship between all measures of good governance, and the COVID-19 positive and growth rates. The significant inverse relationship largely persists even after controlling for continent-fixed effects and a host of geographic, demographic, and socio-economic factors. This indicates the presence of a strong systemic linkage between quality of governance and pandemic control. The findings empirically strengthen the argument of eminent medical historians concerning the importance of effective governmental intervention for epidemic control. The study reveals that the quality of governance is a key factor in a country’s success in pandemic management and encourages further investigation.","Nabin, Munirul H.; Chowdhury Mohammad Tarequl, Hasan Bhattacharya Sukanto",Humanities & Social Sciences Communications,https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-021-00876-w,719

182140,Accessibility and Response Time Analysis on the COVID19 Website in Indonesia,2021,"Wastewater surveillance of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has proven a practical complement to clinical data for assessing community-scale infection trends. Clinical assays, such as the CDC-promulgated N1, N2, and N3 have been used to detect and quantify viral RNA in wastewater but, to date, have not included estimates of reliability of true positive or true negative. Bayes Theorem was applied to estimate Type I and Type II error rates for detections of the virus in wastewater. Conditional probabilities of true positive or true negative were investigated when one assay was used, or multiple assays were run concurrently. Cumulative probability analysis was used to assess the likelihood of true SARS-CoV-2 detection using multiple samples. Results demonstrate highly reliable positive (>0.86 for priors >0.25) and negative (>0.80 for priors = 0.50) results using a single assay. Using N1 and N2 concurrently caused greater reliability (>0.99 for priors <0.05) when results concurred but generated potentially counterintuitive interpretations when results were discordant. Regional wastewater surveillance data was investigated as a means of setting prior probabilities. Probability of true detection with a single marker was investigated using cumulative probability across all combinations of positive and negative results for a set of three samples. Findings using a low (0.11) and uniformed (0.50) initial prior resulted in high probabilities of detection (>0.95) even when a set of samples included one or two negative results, demonstrating the influence of high sensitivity and specificity values. Analyses presented here provide a practical framework for understanding analytical results generated by wastewater surveillance programs.","Curtis, K.; Gonzalez, R.

We analyzed genomes of 601 B. fragilis isolates derived from 12 healthy individuals, among which include time-series isolates from 6 individuals. In addition, we analyzed 222 reference B. fragilis genomes. Three different types of CRISPR-Cas systems (Type I-B, II-C and III-B) were found in analyzed B. fragilis genomes, with Type III-B being the most prevalent whereas the Type II-C being the most dynamic with varying arrays among isolates. Our graph-based summary and visualization of CRISPR arrays provided a holistic view of the organization and the composition of the CRISPR spacers. We observed insertions of different new spacers at the leader ends of the CRISPR arrays of Type II-C CRISPR-Cas systems in different B. fragilis sub-populations in one individual, an example of B. fragilis’ adaptation and parallel evolution within individual microbiomes. A network of B. fragilis and its predicted invaders also revealed microdynamics of B. fragilis CRISPR array, with hairball-like structures representing spacers with multi-target capabilities and network modules revealing the collective targeting of selected mobile elements by many spacers.

182502,Assessing COVID-19 Impacts on College Students via Automated Processing of Free-form Text,2021,"IntroductionClozapine is an effective antipsychotic used in treatment-resistant schizophrenia. One of the serious complications of clozapine therapy is agranulocytosis, therefore regular monitoring of the level of white blood cells (WBC) in plasma is necessary. During acute inflammatory infections, including the COVID-19 infection, levels of clozapine may increase, by the CYP 450 system, leading to adverse effects such as sedation, hypersalivation and consequently to aspiration pneumonia.ObjectivesThe aim of the study is to assess the validity of continuing clozapine treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic.MethodsBrief literature review, based on research of scientific articles published in PubMed, using as keywords the terms “clozapine” and “COVID-19”.ResultsResearch studies indicate that SARS-COV2 infection in patients treated with clozapine does not significantly reduce the level of neutrophils, despite commonly observed leucopenia with lymphopenia. Due to pandemic, existing WBC scheme has been modified with a trend towards less frequent measurements. To minimize the side effects of clozapine during infection, it is recommended to reduce the dose of clozapine by half and continue lower dose until 3 days after fever has subsided. Additionally, there have been reports of psychosis recurrence after discontinuation of clozapine causing difficulties in treatment COVID-19 as also comorbid mental disease.ConclusionsTreatment of clozapine is associated with higher risk of COVID-19 complications and at the same time COVID-19 infection may increase clozapine toxicity. Therefore, the risks of COVID-19 infection present a challenge for safe clozapine use. Further research will be needed to assess these dependencies and strategies.DisclosureNo significant relationships.","Dąbrowska, E.; Galińska-Skok, B.; Zalewski, D.; Nobis, A.",European Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1192/j.eurpsy.2021.1777,719

Routine OPDs including rehabilitation centers are partially functional to minimize the risk of cross-infection. In elderly patients, rotator cuff syndrome is a common cause of shoulder pain and daily physiotherapy is the main mode of management. To minimize the risk of cross-infection (COVID-19), we introduced E-rehabilitation services via various mobile apps to our patients. In developing countries like India, E-rehabilitation is still a new concept. Methods: This study evaluated 70 patients who had been enrolled for E-rehabilitation with a minimum of 4 weeks follow-up. Every patient was asked to use the rehabilitation App as per their requirement. Results were assessed with Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH), visual analogue scale (VAS) and active ranges of movement (forward flexion and external rotation). Results: The average age of enrolled patients at the time of surgery was 55.0 years (range, 40-65 years). In 2 and 4 weeks, the range of forward flexion and external rotation has improved significantly. DASH and VAS Score has also been decreased significantly at an average of 2 and 4 weeks with P<0.01. Conclusion: In this paper, we summarized the management of rotator cuff syndrome by using various mobile apps and also the various challenges faced in the elderly population with the newer concept of E-rehabilitation in this pandemic.","Lakhani, A.; Sharma, E.; Khadayat, S.",Journal of Musculoskeletal Research,https://doi.org/10.1142/s0218957721500020,719

202857,An Introduction of FD-Complete Constraints,2020,"The Indian media's reportage of the Covid-19 pandemic has exposed the State's long-standing apathy towards low-income migrants and the structural neglect and violence faced by them in society. But how consistent were the country's print media in reporting on this population group before the crisis? This paper reports the findings of a study that examines the representation of migrants and refugees and their health in the Indian print media prior to the pandemic. A secondary objective was to examine any variations in their representation based on their social positions (for example, ethnicity, nationality, gender, religion). Using frame and content analyses, three English language newspapers were examined for the period January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2018. A total of 1,111 articles were retrieved. Analysis revealed that migrants were most frequently framed as ""villains"", posing a threat to the security, culture, health and economy in their destination states/cities, and less often as victims. On health coverage, the study found that the media frequently pathologised migrants and projected them as carriers of infection. Migrants' religion, ethnicity and class, and their proximity to the majoritarian population appeared most prominent in determining the frame imposed. The articles mostly relied on accounts of state officials and political leaders, whereas migrants' voices comprised less than a quarter of the sources of information. The media thus play a vital role in crystallising these disparities and, through acts of both omission and commission, end up vilifying migrants.","John, Ekatha Ann; Kapilashrami, Anuj",Indian J Med Ethics,,719

Methods: An interdisciplinary Task Force was constructed to develop innovative strategies for management of a novel disease. A single-institution prospective non-randomized cohort study was then conducted on patients with COVID-19 respiratory failure who underwent tracheostomy using an induced bedside apneic technique at a tertiary care academic institution between April 27th, 2020, and June 30th, 2020. Results: 28 patients underwent tracheostomy with induced apnea. The median lowest procedural oxygen saturation was 95%. The median number of ventilated days following tracheostomy was 11. There were 3 mortalities (11%) due to sepsis and multiorgan failure; of 25 surviving patients, 100% were successfully discharged from the hospital and 76% are decannulated, with a median time of 26 days from tracheostomy to decannulation (range 12 - 57). There was no symptomatic disease transmission to healthcare personnel on the COVID-19 Tracheostomy Team. Conclusions: Patients with respiratory failure from COVID-19 disease may benefit from tracheostomy. This can be completed effectively and safely, without viral transmission to healthcare personnel. Performing tracheostomies earlier in the course of disease may expedite patient recovery and improve ICU resource utilization. Creation of a collaborative Task Force is an effective strategic approach for management of novel disease.","Weiss, Kathleen D; Coppolino, Antonio; Wiener, Daniel C; McNamee, Ciaran; Riviello, Robert; Ng, Ju-Mei; Jaklitsch, Michael T; Marshall, Margaret B; Rochefort, Matthew M",,,719

This was an exploratory qualitative study, which used the theoretical-methodological framework of the Discourse Analysis of French matrix, guided by the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research. The study was conducted in Ribeirão Preto, São Paulo, Brazil. Seven participants were interviewed who were undergoing treatment at the time of the interview. The analysis of the participants' discourses allowed the emergence of four discursive blocks: (1) impact of the social determinants in the development of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, (2) barriers to seeking care and difficulties accessing health services, (3) perceptions of the side effects and their impact on multidrug-resistant tuberculosis treatment, and (4) tuberculosis and COVID-19: a necessary dialogue. Through discursive formations, these revealed the determinants of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. Considering the complexity involved in the dynamics of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, advancing in terms of equity in health, that is, in reducing unjust differences, is a challenge for public policies, especially at the current moment in Brazil, which is of accentuated economic, political and social crisis. The importance of psychosocial stressors and the lack of social support should also be highlighted as intermediary determinants of health. The study has also shown the situation of COVID-19, which consists of an important barrier for patients seeking care.

215965,Literature Review on The Use of Educational Physics Games in Improving Learning Outcomes,2021,"OBJECTIVES: Recent studies suggested obesity to be a possible risk factor for COVID-19 disease in the wake of the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection. However, the causality and especially the role of body fat distribution in this context is still unclear. Thus, using a univariable as well as multivariable two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) approach, we investigated for the first time the causal impact of body composition on the susceptibility and severity of COVID-19. METHODS: As indicators of overall and abdominal obesity we considered the measures body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), and trunk fat ratio (TFR). Summary statistics of genome-wide association studies (GWASs) for these body composition measures were drawn from the GIANT consortium and UK Biobank, while for susceptibility and severity due to COVID-19 disease data from the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative was used. For the COVID-19 cohort neither age nor gender was available. Total and direct causal effect estimates were calculated using Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs), sensitivity analyses were done applying several robust MR techniques and mediation effects of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and cardiovascular diseases (CVD) were investigated within multivariable MR analyses. RESULTS: Genetically predicted BMI was strongly associated with both, susceptibility (ORâ¯=â¯1.31 per 1 SD increase; 95% CI: 1.15-1.50; P-valueâ¯=â¯7.3·10-5) and hospitalization (ORâ¯=â¯1.62 per 1 SD increase; 95% CI: 1.33-1.99; P-valueâ¯=â¯2.8·10-6) even after adjustment for genetically predicted visceral obesity traits. These associations were neither mediated substantially by T2D nor by CVD. Finally, total but not direct effects of visceral body fat on outcomes could be detected. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides strong evidence for a causal impact of overall obesity on the susceptibility and severity of COVID-19 disease. The impact of abdominal obesity was weaker and disappeared after adjustment for BMI. Therefore, obese people should be regarded as a high-risk group. Future research is necessary to investigate the underlying mechanisms linking obesity with COVID-19.","Freuer, Dennis; Linseisen, Jakob; Meisinger, Christa",Metabolism,,719

216357,Enhancement of Medical Information Security Through Lightweight Cryptography and Steganography in the Platform of Cloud-IoT Ecosystem,2021,"The Covid-19 pandemic is burning all over the world. National healthcare systems are facing the contagion with incredible strength, but concern regarding the psychosocial and economic effects is growing quickly. The PsyCovid Study assessed the influence of psychosocial variables on individual differences from the perceived impact of the Covid-19 outbreak on the issues of health and economy in the Italian population. Italian volunteers from different regions completed an online anonymous survey. The main outcomes were the perceived impact of the Covid-19 outbreak on health and the economy. A two-way MANOVA evaluated differences in the main outcomes, with geographical area (northern, central, and southern regions) and professional status (healthcare workers or not) as factors. We then tested the relationship linking psychosocial variables (i.e. perceived distress and social isolation, empathy, and coping style) to the main outcomes through two different mediation models. 1163 responders completed the survey (835 females; mean age: 42 ± 13.5 y.o.; age range: 18-81 y.o.) between March 14 and 21, 2020. Healthcare workers and people living in northern Italy reported a significantly worse outbreak impact on health, but not on the economy. In the whole sample, distress and loneliness were key variables influencing the perceived impact of the Covid-19 outbreak on health, while empathy and coping style affected the perceived impact on the economy. The Covid-19 pandemic is a worldwide emergency in terms of psychological, social, and economic consequences. Our data suggests that in the Italian population, actual differences in individual perception of the Covid-19 outbreak severity for health are dramatically modulated by psychosocial frailty (i.e., distress and loneliness). At the same time, problem-oriented coping strategies and enhanced empathic abilities increase people's awareness of the severity of the impact of the Covid-19 emergency on economics. There is an immediate need for consensus guidelines and healthcare policies to support interventions aimed to manage psychosocial distress and increase population resilience towards the imminent crisis.","Cerami, Chiara; Santi, Gaia C.; Galandra, Caterina; Dodich, Alessandra; Cappa, Stefano F.; Vecchi, Tomaso; Crespi, Chiara",Front.

Using a simple and validated instrument of depression screening, we evaluated the incidence and severity of major depression among African American patients within 90 days of recovery from severe COVID-19-associated respiratory failure. METHODS: African American patients hospitalized and treated with invasive mechanical ventilation for COVID-19-associated respiratory failure in the intensive care unit (ICU) of Grady Memorial Hospital, Atlanta, between April 1, 2020, and June 30, 2020, were screened for depression within 90 days of hospital discharge using the validated patient health questionnaires (PHQ-2) and PHQ-9. RESULTS: A total of 73 patients completed the questionnaire. The median age was 52.5 years [IQR 44-65] and 65% were males. The most common comorbidities were hypertension (66%) and diabetes mellitus (51%). Forty-four percent of the patients had a diagnosis of major depressive disorder (MDD) based on their PHQ-9 questionnaire responses. The incidence of MDD was higher among females (69%, n=18/26) compared to males (29%, n=14/47), in patients > 75 years (66%) and those with multiple comorbidities (45%). Eighteen percent of the patients had moderate depression, while 15% and 22% had moderately severe and severe depression, respectively. Only 26% (n=7/27) of eligible patients were receiving treatment for depression at the time of this survey. CONCLUSION: The incidence of depression in a cohort of African American patients without prior psychiatric conditions who recovered from severe COVID-19 infection was 44%.

223857,Sentiment Analysis of COVID-19 Nationwide Lockdown effect in India,2021,"Shifting the public towards plant-based diets is critical for achieving environmental and public health outcomes. Increasingly news articles and organizations have begun using the saliency of the COVID-19 crisis to highlight the link between animal agriculture, pandemic risks, and other widespread public health threats. Yet, little is known about the effectiveness of this messaging strategy for motivating dietary change. We conducted a randomized trial with an online sample to examine the impact of: (1) a message that uses the saliency of the COVID-19 pandemic to highlight the risk of disease transmission from factory farms, and (2) a message that uses the saliency of the COVID-19 pandemic to highlight the threat to worker's health created by factory farms. We examine whether these messages are more effective at changing beliefs about and behavioral intentions towards plant-based eating, as compared to more traditional messages that highlight the environmental, personal health, or animal welfare implications of factory farmed meat consumption. We find that all messages differentially influenced beliefs about the various negative consequences of meat consumption. However, these altered beliefs did not differentially motivate changes in respondents' intentions to reduce meat consumption and choose plant-based alternatives. This was possibly due to the numerous other barriers to behavior change identified in qualitative survey responses, such as cost, taste, and social factors. We did find that messages that highlight the personal health benefits of reduced meat consumption were more effective at increasing public trust in the message deliverer. Our results suggest that highlighting personal health benefits in messaging and addressing the additional identified barriers to behavior change may be critical for building trust and shifting the public towards plant-based diets.","Niemiec, Rebecca; Jones, Megan S; Mertens, Andrew; Dillard, Courtney",Appetite,,719
224832,Beckett’s present moments,2021,"The new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has been wreaking havoc all over the planet. In a precautionary measure, populations have been forced and kept under quarantine to contain the outbreak of the COVID-19 disease. The quarantine primary goal is to avoid the overload to the hospitals, which should be available for the care of COVID-19 patients. However, the virus does not have a uniform spread throughout the planet, and Brazil is no different. Although all the world's attention is now on the COVID-19 pandemic, there is no similar pattern of spread, and other diseases are still a real problem. Given the risks of transmission between patients and healthcare providers, there is a great challenge for healthcare institutions who must balance resources to assure safe care to patients and professionals while they take care of other disease patients, and perform surgical procedures that need to be carried out. Under such circumstances, as COVID-19 can also present pre- or asymptomatic transmission, it can be challenging to identify patients who are carrying and spreading the virus. Studies and information on mandatory testing for who are candidates to undergo elective surgery are scarce. Thus, the authors have reviewed the literature, and discuss the need to test these patients under the current context.","Silva, Leonardo Emilio; Cohen, Ricardo Vitor; Rocha, Jaime Luis Lopes; Hassel, Viviane Maria Carvalho; VON-Bahten, Luiz Carlos",Rev Col Bras Cir,,719

Entry of the virus into host cells, most destructively lung cells, requires two host cell surface proteins, ACE2 and TMPRSS2, downregulation of which is thus a potential therapeutic approach for COVID-19. Both of these cell surface proteins are steroid regulated: TMPRSS2 is a well-characterised androgen-regulated target in prostate cancer. Analysis of sequencing data shows co-expression of the androgen receptor (AR) and TMPRSS2 in key human lung cell types that are targeted by SARS- CoV-2. We show that treatment with antiandrogens such as enzalutamide (a well-tolerated drug widely used in advanced prostate cancer) significantly reduces TMPRSS2 levels in human lung cells and in vivo in mouse lung. We demonstrate that AR binding in the region of the TMPRSS2 gene differs between lung and prostate, identifying distinct regulatory regions. Together, the data and evidence presented supports clinical trials to assess the efficacy of antiandrogens as a treatment option for COVID-19.","Leach, Damien A.; Andrea, Mohr Zwacka Ralf Giottis Stathis Yates Laura Lloyd Clare Brooke Greg N.; Bevan, Charlotte Lynne",Journal of the Endocrine Society,,719
235847,Visualization of contributions to open-source projects,2020,"The use of rapid testing offers an opportunity to contain the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic; however, the impact of false-positive and false-negative test results and population response must be anticipated and taken into consideration to avoid or mitigate harm. Untargeted use of rapid testing is associated with high direct and indirect costs and will have limited impact on the pandemic if resources are used inefficiently. We suggest using a risk-stratified testing strategy, based on targeted testing directly integrated with the Public Health Service's case and contact tracing management. According to the proposed targeted testing strategy stratified by risk of infection, all persons with acute symptoms of a respiratory infection as well as other population groups with an elevated probability of being infected with SARS-CoV-2 infection should be specifically tested to identify ""hidden"" infection networks. The strategy should include a uniform communication strategy for dealing with positive and negative test results, a targeted expansion of access to low-threshold testing opportunities, ensuring timely and free access to the results of confirmatory tests, and integration into an overarching documentation system for evaluation. This integration of a risk-stratified targeted testing strategy into case and contact tracing management embedded in a comprehensive strategy can help to reduce infection rates in a resource-efficient and sustainable manner.","Arnold, Laura; Stratil, Jan",Gesundheitswesen,,719

The objective of this preliminary report is to describe prehospital encounters for patients with a COVID-19 hospital diagnosis and/or COVID-19 EMS suspicion versus those with neither a hospital diagnosis nor EMS suspicion of the disease. METHODS: This case series evaluated electronic patient care records from EMS agencies participating in a large national bi-directional data exchange. All records for 9-1-1 responses between March 1 and April 19, 2020, resulting in transport to a hospital, with at least one ICD-10 outcome returned via the data exchange were included. Hospital ICD-10 codes used to determine COVID-19 diagnoses included B97.2, B97.21, B97.29, B34.2, and U07.1. COVID-19 EMS suspicion was defined as a documented EMS primary or secondary impression of COVID-19, or indication of COVID-19 suspicion in the prehospital free-text narrative. Comparisons were stratified by COVID-19 hospital diagnosis and COVID-19 EMS suspicion. Descriptive and comparative statistics are presented. RESULTS: There were 84,540 EMS patient records with linked hospital ICD-10 codes included. Of those, 814 (1%) patients had a COVID-19 hospital diagnosis. Overall, COVID-19 EMS suspicion was documented for 3,204 (4%) patients. A COVID-19 EMS suspicion was documented for 636 (78%) of hospital diagnosed COVID-19 patients. Those with COVID-19 hospital diagnoses were more likely to present with tachycardia, tachypnea, hypoxia, and fever during the EMS encounter. EMS responses for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were also more likely to originate from a skilled nursing/assisted living facility. EMS PPE (eye protection, mask, or gown) use was more frequently documented on records of patients who had hospital diagnosed COVID-19. CONCLUSION: In this large sample of prehospital encounters, EMS COVID-19 suspicion demonstrated sensitivity of 78% and positive predictive value of 20% compared with hospital ICD-10 codes. These data indicate that EMS suspicion alone is insufficient to determine appropriate utilization of PPE.","Fernandez, Antonio R; Crowe, Remle P; Bourn, Scott; Matt, Sarah E; Brown, Andrew L; Hawthorn, Andrew B; Brent Myers, J",Prehosp Emerg Care,,719

General dental practices are obligated by NHS guidance to remain open and provide remote consultation and referral where appropriate to patients having pain or problems. AIMS: To compare two urgent dental centres with different triage and referral systems with regard to quality and appropriateness of referrals, and patient management outcomes. METHODS: 110 consecutive referrals received by a primary care urgent dental centre and a secondary care urgent dental centre were assessed. It was considered whether the patients referred had access to remote primary care dental services, fulfilled the criteria required to be deemed a dental emergency as mandated by NHS guidance, and what the outcomes of referrals were. RESULTS: At the primary care centre, 100% of patients were referred by general dental practitioners and had access to remote primary care dental services. 95.5% of referrals were deemed appropriate and were seen for treatment. At the secondary care site, 94.5% of referrals were direct from the patient by contacting NHS 111. 40% had received triaging to include 'advice, analgesia and antimicrobial' from a general dental practitioner, and 25.5% were deemed appropriate and resulted in treatment. CONCLUSION: Urgent dental centres face many issues, and it would seem that easy access to primary care services, collaboration between primary care clinicians and urgent dental centres, and training of triaging staff are important in operating a successful system.","Shathur, Adam; Reeves, Samuel; Sameja, Faizal; Patel, Vishal; Jones, Allan",Prim Dent J,,719

However, few empirical studies have validated this finding. Our study evaluates the effectiveness of different physical distancing measures in controlling viral transmission. METHODS: We identified three distinct physical distancing measures with varying intensity and implemented at different times-international travel controls, restrictions on mass gatherings, and lockdown-type measures-based on the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker. We also estimated the time-varying reproduction number (Rt) for 142 countries and tracked Rt temporally for two weeks following the 100th reported case in each country. We regressed Rt on the physical distancing measures and other control variables (income, population density, age structure, and temperature) and performed several robustness checks to validate our findings. FINDINGS: Complete travel bans and all forms of lockdown-type measures have been effective in reducing average Rt over the 14 days following the 100th case. Recommended stay-at-home advisories and partial lockdowns are as effective as complete lockdowns in outbreak control. However, these measures have to be implemented early to be effective. Based on the observed median timing across countries worldwide, lockdown-type measures are considered early if they were instituted about two weeks before the 100th case and travel bans a week before detection of the first case. INTERPRETATION: A combination of physical distancing measures, if implemented early, can be effective in containing COVID-19-tight border controls to limit importation of cases, encouraging physical distancing, moderately stringent measures such as working from home, and a full lockdown in the case of a probable uncontrolled outbreak.","Koh, Wee Chian; Naing, Lin; Wong, Justin",Int J Infect Dis,,719

273244,GeoAI-based epidemic control with geo-social data sharing on blockchain,2021,"Introduction: Hippocampus, a medial temporal lobe structure, has significant implications in memory formation and learning. Although hippocampus activity is believed to be affected by socioeconomic status (SES), limited knowledge exists on which SES indicators influence hippocampus function. Purpose: This study explored the separate and combined effects of three SES indicators, namely parental education, family income, and neighborhood income, on adolescents' hippocampus activation during an N-Back memory task. As some of the effects of parental education may be through income, we also tested if the effect of parental education on hippocampus activation during our N-Back memory task is mediated by family or neighborhood income. Methods: The Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study is a national multi-center investigation of American adolescents' brain development. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data of a total sample of 3067 9-10-year-old adolescents were used. The primary outcome was left- hippocampus activation during the N-Back memory task (mean beta weight for N-Back run 1 2 back versus 0 back contrast in left hippocampus). The independent variable was parental education. Family income and neighborhood income were two possible mediators. Age, sex, and marital status were the covariates. To test mediation, we used hierarchical linear regression models first without and then with our mediators. Full mediation was defined according to Kenny. The Sobel test was used to confirm statistical mediation. Results: In the absence of family and neighborhood income in the model, higher parental educational attainment was associated with lower level of left hippocampus activation during the N-Back memory task. This effect was significant while age, sex, and marital status were controlled. The association between parental educational attainment and hippocampus activation during the N-Back memory task was no more significant when we controlled for family and neighborhood income. Instead, family income was associated with hippocampus activation during the N-Back memory task. These findings suggested that family income fully mediates the effect of parental educational attainment on left hippocampus activation during the N-Back memory task. Conclusions: The effect of parental educational attainment on adolescents' hippocampus activation during an N-Back memory task is fully explained by family income. That means low family income is why adolescents with low-educated parents show highlighted hippocampus activation during an N-Back memory task.

282441,Hidden Markov Model energy conservation approach for continuous monitoring of vital signs in geriatric care applications,2021,"Since the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic in December of 2019, clinicians and scientists all over the world have faced overwhelming new challenges that not only threaten their own communities and countries but also the world at large. These challenges have been enormous and debilitating, as the infrastructure of many countries, including developing ones, had little or no resources to deal with the crisis. Even in developed countries, such as Italy, health systems have been so inundated by cases that health care facilities became oversaturated and could not accommodate the unexpected influx of patients to be tested. Initially, resources were focused on testing to identify those who were infected. When it became clear that the virus mainly attacks the lungs by causing parenchymal changes in the form of multifocal pneumonia of different levels of severity, imaging became paramount in the assessment of disease severity, progression, and even response to treatment. As a result, there was a need to establish protocols for imaging of the lungs in these patients. In North America, the focus was on chest X-ray and computed tomography (CT) as these are widely available and accessible at most health facilities. However, in Europe and China, this was not the case, and a cost-effective and relatively fast imaging modality was needed to scan a large number of sick patients promptly. Hence, ultrasound (US) found its way into the hands of Chinese and European physicians and has since become an important imaging modality in those locations. US is a highly versatile, portable, and inexpensive imaging modality that has application across a broad spectrum of conditions and, in this way, is ideally suited to assess the lungs of COVID-19 patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). This bedside test can be done with little to no movement of the patients from the unit that keeps them in their isolated rooms, thereby limiting further exposure to other health personnel. This article presents a basic introduction to COVID-19 and the use of the US for lung imaging. It further provides a high-level overview of the existing US technologies that are driving development in current and potential future US imaging systems for lung, with a specific emphasis on portable and 3-D systems.","Qian, Xuejun; Wodnicki, Robert; Kang, Haochen; Zhang, Junhang; Tchelepi, Hisham; Zhou, Qifa",IEEE Trans Ultrason Ferroelectr Freq Control,,719
283833,Smart social distancing solution using bluetooth® low energy,2020,"The ongoing outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection has spread rapidly worldwide. The major transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2 are recognised as inhalation of aerosol/droplets and person-to-person contact. However, some studies have demonstrated that live SARS-CoV-2 can be isolated from the faeces and urine of infected patients, which can then enter the wastewater system. The currently available evidence indicates that the viral RNA present in wastewater may become a potential source of epidemiological data. However, to investigate whether wastewater may present a risk to humans such as sewage workers, we investigated whether intact particles of SARS-CoV-2 were observable and whether it was possible to isolate the virus in wastewater. Using a correlative strategy of light microscopy and electron microscopy (CLEM), we demonstrated the presence of intact and degraded SARS-like particles in RT-qPCR SARS-CoV-2-positive sewage sample collected in the city of Marseille. However, the viral infectivity assessment of SARS-CoV-2 in the wastewater was inconclusive, due to the presence of other viruses known to be highly resistant in the environment such as enteroviruses, rhinoviruses, and adenoviruses. Although the survival and the infectious risk of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater cannot be excluded from our study, additional work may be required to investigate the stability, viability, fate, and decay mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 thoroughly in wastewater.","Brahim Belhaouari, Djamal Wurtz Nathalie Grimaldier Clio Lacoste Alexandre Pires de Souza Gabriel Augusto Penant Gwilherm Hannat Sihem Baudoin Jean-Pierre La Scola Bernard",Pathogens,,719

285232,Which project management methodology is better for ai-transformation and innovation projects?,2021,"Reproductive health is a major concern for workers constantly exposed to chemicals at work, especially in developing countries. The problems mainly stemmed from chronic exposure to the chemicals contained in paint thinner, which is mainly toluene, used during automobile painting. Unfortunately, in Indonesia, there is no study on the reproductive health of male workers in automobile workshops, especially in relation to spermatogenesis. This study aimed to explore the possibility of reproductive problems, namely spermatozoa DNA fragmentation, among male workers in an automobile workshop in Malang. We recruited workers who have worked as automobile painters for years at an automobile workshop in Malang and have been chronically exposed to thinner. Semen samples were collected from 15 automobile workshop workers who were married and had children. Twelve office workers were used as the control group. The two groups of semen samples were tested with the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling assay combined with propidium iodide and analyzed by flow cytometry. The results showed a significant difference between DNA fragmentation of the control group and workshop workers at 14.9% and 47.66%, respectively. Risk factor analysis showed a significant increase in risk factors (p = 0.001). Taken together, chronic exposure to paint thinner in those engaged in painting at the automobile workshop increased the risk of DNA fragmentation in spermatozoa. Our study highlighted the importance of health education for the risked workers on minimization of exposure, which could be recommended to the health policy makers.","Irnandi, Dicky Faizal; Hinting, Aucky; Yudiwati, Rina",Toxicol Ind Health,,719

287865,Design Space Exploration for Aerospace IoT Products,2020,"BACKGROUND: During the past two decades, three novel coronaviruses (CoVs) have emerged to cause international human epidemics with severe morbidity. CoVs have also emerged to cause severe epidemics in animals. A better understanding of the natural hosts and genetic diversity of CoVs are needed to help mitigate these threats. OBJECTIVE: To design and evaluate a molecular diagnostic tool for detection and identification of all currently recognized and potentially future emergent CoVs from the Orthocoronavirinae subfamily. STUDY DESIGN AND RESULTS: We designed a semi-nested, reverse transcription RT-PCR assay based upon 38 published genome sequences of human and animal CoVs. We evaluated this assay with 14 human and animal CoVs and 11 other non-CoV respiratory viruses. Through sequencing the assay's target amplicon, the assay correctly identified each of the CoVs; no cross-reactivity with 11 common respiratory viruses was observed. The limits of detection ranged from 4 to 4â¯×â¯102 copies/reaction, depending on the CoV species tested. To assess the assay's clinical performance, we tested a large panel of previously studied specimens: 192 human respiratory specimens from pneumonia patients, 5 clinical specimens from COVID-19 patients, 81 poultry oral secretion specimens, 109 pig slurry specimens, and 31 aerosol samples from a live bird market. The amplicons of all RT-PCR-positive samples were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Our assay performed well with all tested specimens across all sample types. CONCLUSIONS: This assay can be used for detection and identification of all previously recognized CoVs, including SARS-CoV-2, and potentially any emergent CoVs in the Orthocoronavirinae subfamily.","Xiu, Leshan; Binder, Raquel A; Alarja, Natalie A; Kochek, Kara; Coleman, Kristen K; Than, Son T; Bailey, Emily S; Bui, Vuong N; Toh, Teck-Hock; Erdman, Dean D; Gray, Gregory C",J Clin Virol,,719

Extracellular vesicle(EVs) are recognized and endocytosed by tissue cells via specific interactions between surface membrane proteins, where after they deliver their molecular cargo. This provides the potential to modify membrane proteins at EV surfaces as a promising means for specific tissue targeting and drug delivery. In this study, we describe a VSVG viral pseudotyping-based approach to load EV membranes with the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike protein, the key domain in SARS-CoV-2 attachment, fusion and cellular entry. The RBD-tagged EVs can specifically recognize ACE2 receptor on the surface of target cells, which is required for the RBD-tagged EVs cellular uptake and targeting. Further, using the hACE2 transgenic mouse model, we show the RBD-tagged EVs accumulate specifically in the target tissues that highly express ACE2. Finally, we demonstrate that the RBD-tagged EVs that encapsulate siRNAs against SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus can specifically target lung tissues and suppress the pseudovirus infection in vivo. Together, our work presents a safe and effective engineered EV system for in vivo targeted delivery of potential antiviral agents into specific tissues which as a therapeutic potential against SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Fu, Yuxuan; Xiong, Sidong",J Control Release,,719

However, the possible risk factors for myocardial damage in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are not fully known. METHODS AND RESULTS Critical type patients were selected randomly from 204 confirmed COVID-19 cases occurring in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from February 1, 2020 to February 24, 2020. Univariate analyses were used to compare the 2 groups: the myocardial damage group and the non-myocardial damage group. A total of 82 critical patients with COVID-19 were recruited: 34 with myocardial damage and 48 without myocardial damage. A total of 30 patients died in the myocardial damage group, and 20 died in the non-myocardial damage group. In univariate analysis, the proportion of elderly patients (>70 years old, 70.59% versus 37.50%; P=0.003) and patients with cardiovascular disease (41.18% versus 12.50%; P=0.003) was higher among myocardial damage patients than among non-myocardial damage patients. Multivariate analysis showed that age >70 years old (hazard ratio [HR], 2.44; 95% CI, 1.01-5.40), CRP (C-reactive protein) >100 mg/L (HR, 1.92; 95% CI, 0.94-3.92), lactate dehydrogenase >300 U/L (HR, 2.67; 95% CI, 1.03-6.90), and lactic acid >3 mmol/L (HR, 3.25; 95% CI, 1.57-6.75) were independent risk factors for myocardial damage in patients with COVID-19.

Most of the health system capacity has been directed to COVID-19 patients, and routine outpatient clinics have been suspended. Chronic disease patients, such as inherited metabolic disorders (IMD), have had trouble accessing healthcare services. Methods An online cross-sectional survey was conducted among patients with IMDs who were present for a follow-up at our clinic to address their problems during pandemic period. Our clinic's Instagram and Facebook accounts were used to invite the participants. Three reminders were given between May 1, 2020, and May 30, 2020. Survey questions were analyzed using descriptive statics. Results A total of 213 patients completed our survey. Incomplete surveys were excluded, and 175 questionnaires were evaluated. Most of patients had a special diet, and 51% of them had some difficulty with their diet. The reported rate of using a special treatment was 38%, and most of these patients (91%) had no problem receiving these special therapies during this time. Parents who were wearing masks while caring for their child were very few (17%), but a vast majority of parents (73.7%) had high handwashing rates. None of the patients had a SARS-COV2 infection until this paper was written. Conclusion This is the first study that aims to determine the problems faced by patients with IMD during the COVID-19 period. Considering that the pandemic will not immediately pass, recognizing the problems faced by patients with chronic diseases and developing solutions would help these patients avoid long-term damage.","Oge Enver, Ece; Hopurcuoglu, Duhan; Ahmadzada, Seffa; Zubarioglu, Tanyel; Aktuglu Zeybek, Ayse Cigdem; Kiykim, Ertugrul",,,719

This systemic review summarizes and synthesizes findings from studies relevant to the relationship between vitamin D and stroke risk, severity, and outcome; potential mechanisms explaining such a relationship; and outcomes from vitamin D supplementation. The literature shows that vitamin D deficiency is a significant risk factor for ischemic stroke, with sun exposure, sex, age, race, diabetes, and genetics playing a role as well. Stroke severity and short-and long-term outcomes also worsen with vitamin D deficiency. The neuroprotective mechanisms by which vitamin D operates to mitigate stroke onset and outcomes have yet to be fully studied, but researchers have proposed several pathways, including promotion of certain neuroprotective growth factors, reduction of arterial pressure through vasodilation, and inhibition of reactive oxygen species. There is some evidence that vitamin D supplementation could lower stroke risk and improve recovery, though outcomes can also be negligible or negative. Although results are mixed and the limitations of vitamin D supplementation merit some caution, vitamin D overall plays a significant role in stroke health. Future research should further develop understanding of the neuroprotective mechanisms of vitamin D and study how supplementation could be administered effectively in stroke treatment.","Yarlagadda, Keerthi; Ma, Nicholas; Doré, Sylvain",Front.

313272,Refute the Decision of Auto-Promotion and Real Facts of Digital Online Classes during the Pandemic in Bangladesh,2020,"All atom molecular dynamic modeling was applied in order to determine water molecule and electrolyte ion concentration profiles around and inside the myoglobin molecule at various pH values. Significant penetration of counter ions into the molecule was confirmed. The electric potential distribution within and outside the molecule was quantitatively described using the non-linear Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) approach. Using this model, calculations were performed, yielding the surface and zeta potential for various physicochemical parameters, comprising pH, the electric permittivity, the ion penetration depth and the protein volume fraction (crowding effect). The theoretical results were used for the interpretation of experimental data acquired under different ionic strengths and temperatures by electrophoretic mobility measurements. It is confirmed that the experimental data are adequately reflected for acidic pH values by the non-linear PB model where the nominal molecule charge was calculated from the H++ model. The deviations occurring for larger pH values were accounted for by considering additional non-electrostatic interactions stemming from the van der Waals and ion-induced dipole forces. In this way, it is both experimentally and theoretically confirmed that the effective charge of the myoglobin molecule in electrolyte solutions is considerably smaller than the nominal, structure-based, predicted charge. As a result, under physiological conditions prevailing, e.g. in skeletal muscles, the effective charge of the myoglobin molecule should practically vanish. One can expect that the approach developed in this work can be applied for predicting charging mechanisms of other protein molecules characterized by an analogous charge vs. pH characteristic, e.g., the SARS-CoV-2 virus spike proteins, and for soft particles with pH responsive characteristics.","Batys, Piotr; Nattich-Rak, Malgorzata; Adamczyk, Zbigniew",Phys Chem Chem Phys,,719

As with a number of zoonotic pathogens, there is a risk of spillover into novel hosts. Here, we propose a hypothesized conceptual model that illustrates the mechanism whereby the SARS-CoV-2 could spillover from infected humans to naive wildlife hosts in North America. This proposed model is premised on transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from human feces through municipal waste water treatment plants into the natural aquatic environment where potential wildlife hosts become infected. We use the existing literature on human coronaviruses, including SARS CoV, to support the potential pathways and mechanisms in the conceptual model. Although we focus on North America, our conceptual model could apply to other parts of the globe as well.","Franklin, Alan B; Bevins, Sarah N",Sci Total Environ,,719

Objective: To screen for novel coronavirus related conjunctivitis among patients with coronavirus disease 2019. Methods: Prospective series case study. Eighty-one patients diagnosed as coronavirus disease 2019 in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region People's Hospital were enrolled with ophthalmological consultation and screening for novel coronavirus related conjunctivitis, including the inquiring of eye symptoms and checking for conjunctivitis-related signs. Novel coronavirus nucleic acid testing of conjunctival swabs was performed on patients with clinical manifestations of conjunctivitis. Results: Only 3 of the 81 patients (3.70%) complained of eye discomfort, which appeared on day 16.67±9.29 after the diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019. The eye signs were not typical of viral conjunctivitis. Novel coronavirus nucleic acid tests of conjunctival swabs were negative in both eyes. There was no evidence to support the diagnosis of novel coronavirus related conjunctivitis. The remaining 78 patients showed no clinical symptoms or signs of conjunctivitis. Conclusions: The occurrence of novel coronavirus related conjunctivitis may be low in patients with coronavirus disease 2019.(Chin J Ophthalmol, 2020, 56: 433-437).","Lan, Q Q; Zeng, S M; Liao, X; Xu, F; Qi, H; Li, M",Zhonghua Yan Ke Za Zhi,,719

Recently, the novel coronavirus pneumonia which was named COVID-19 by the World Health Organization (WHO) has been raised as a worldwide problem. Radiological examinations were confirmed as effective methods for the screening and diagnosis of COVID-19. It is reported that some radiologists and radiological technologists were infected when giving examinations to the patients with COVID-19. In order to reduce the infection risk of medical staff in radiology department, we summarized the experience on prevention and control measures in radiology department for COVID-19, aiming to guide the prevention and practical work for radiologists and radiological technologists.

In the present study, we demonstrate a high prevalence of infection among the Xikrin of Bacajá people (Kayapó). A sample of 100 individuals of both sexes (51 men and 49 women) with ages ranging from 2 to 82 years were clinically evaluated and tested for the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody. Among all investigated individuals, 58 were IgG-reactive (58 %) by a rapid test, and 73 (73 %) were reactive in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, with no difference between sexes. Oxygen saturation ranged from 82 to 99 %, with the lowest value observed in a two-year-old girl. The results show that as expected, SARS-CoV-2 infection rapidly reached more than 70 % of the population, most likely because of the difficulties of maintaining social distance due to cultural characteristics. These results highlight the importance of indigenous health policies as a means of minimizing the impact of the pandemic on these communities.","Rodrigues, Eliene Putira Sacuema; Abreu, Isabella Nogueira; Lima, Carlos Neandro Cordeiro; da Fonseca, Dennyson Leandro Mathias; Pereira, Sávio Felipe Gomes; Dos Reis, Laena Costa; Vallinoto, Izaura Maria Vieira Cayres; Guerreiro, João Farias; Vallinoto, Antonio Carlos Rosário",Int J Equity Health,,719

Several honeybee populations across Europe have well-documented adaptations of mite-resistant traits but little is known about host adaptations towards the virus infections vectored by the mite. The aim of this study was to assess and compare the possible contribution of adapted virus tolerance and/or resistance to the enhanced survival of four well-documented mite-resistant honeybee populations from Norway, Sweden, The Netherlands and France, in relation to unselected mite-susceptible honeybees. Caged adult bees and laboratory reared larvae, from colonies of these four populations, were inoculated with DWV and ABPV in a series of feeding infection experiments, while control groups received virus-free food. Virus infections were monitored using RT-qPCR assays in individuals sampled over a time course. In both adults and larvae the DWV and ABPV infection dynamics were nearly identical in all groups, but all mite-resistant honeybee populations had significantly higher survival rates compared to the mite-susceptible honeybees. These results suggest that adapted virus tolerance is an important component of survival mechanisms.","Locke, Barbara; Thaduri, Srinivas; Stephan, Jörg G; Low, Matthew; Blacquière, Tjeerd; Dahle, Bjørn; Le Conte, Yves; Neumann, Peter; de Miranda, Joachim R",Sci Rep,,719

Despite this there is a need to document potential adverse drug events (ADEs) to guide future decisions as limited ADE data available before COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Interrogation of WHO VigiBase® from 2015 to 2020 coupled with published studies of ADEs in COVID-19 patients. The main outcome measures are the extent of ADEs broken down by factors including age, seriousness, region and organ. Results: A total 1086 ADEs were reported from the 439 individual case reports up to 19 July 2020 in the VigiBase®, reduced to 1004 once duplicates were excluded. Almost all ADEs concerned COVID-19 patients (92.5%), with an appreciable number from the Americas (67.7%). The majority of ADEs were from males > 45 years and were serious (82.5%). An increase in hepatic enzymes (32.1%), renal injury (14.4%), rise in creatinine levels (11.2%) respiratory failure (6.4%) were the most frequently reported ADEs. Conclusions: Deterioration of liver and kidney function are frequently observed ADEs with remdesivir; consequently, patients should be monitored for these ADEs. The findings are in line with ADEs included in regulatory authority documents.","Charan, Jaykaran; Kaur, Rimple Jeet; Bhardwaj, Pankaj; Haque, Mainul; Sharma, Praveen; Misra, Sanjeev; Godman, Brian",Expert rev. clin. pharmacol,,719

347946,Automatic diagnosis of COVID-19 and pneumonia using FBD method,2020,"Information processing underlying human perceptual decision-making is inherently noisy and identifying sources of this noise is important to understand processing. Ratcliff, Voskuilen, and McKoon (2018) examined results from five experiments using a double-pass procedure in which stimuli were repeated typically a hundred trials later. Greater than chance agreement between repeated tests provided evidence for trial-to-trial variability from external sources of noise. They applied the diffusion model to estimate the quality of evidence driving the decision process (drift rate) and the variability (standard deviation) in drift rate across trials. This variability can be decomposed into random (internal) and systematic (external) components by comparing the double-pass accuracy and agreement with the model predictions. In this note, we provide an additional analysis of the double-pass experiments using the linear ballistic accumulator (LBA) model. The LBA model does not have within-trial variability and thus it captures all variability in processing with its across-trial variability parameters. The LBA analysis of the double-pass data provides model-based evidence of external variability in a decision process, which is consistent with Ratcliff et al.'s result. This demonstrates that across-trial variability is required to model perceptual decision-making. The LBA model provides measures of systematic and random variability as the diffusion model did. But due to the lack of within-trial variability, the LBA model estimated the random component as a larger proportion of across-trial total variability than did the diffusion model.","Kang, Inhan; Ratcliff, Roger; Voskuilen, Chelsea",Journal of mathematical psychology,,719

353352,Analysis of the Spread of COVID-19 in Local Areas in Indonesia,2021,"Health care workers have an increased incidence of allergic disease compared to the general public and are exposed to a variety of high-level disinfectants. While exposure to these agents has been associated with allergic disease, findings between epidemiology and animal studies often conflict respecting immunological mechanisms. Therefore, we hypothesized that previous exposure to a representative IgE-mediated sensitizer, (Ortho-phthalaldehyde [OPA]) alters immune responses to a representative T-cell mediated sensitizer (didecyldimethlyammonium chloride [DDAC]). Here, BALB/c mice were topically exposed to OPA (0.5%) for 3-days, rested, then topically exposed to DDAC (0.0625, 0.125, 0.25%) for 14-days. Co-exposure resulted in phenotypic changes in draining lymph node (dLN) cells, including a decreased frequency of CD8+ T cells and increased frequency and number of B cells compared to DDAC-only treated mice. The co-exposed mice also had enhanced Th2 responses, including significant alterations in: dLN Il4 (increased), B-cell activation (increased), CD8 T-cell activation (decreased), and local and systemic IgE production (increased). These changes were not observed if mice were exposed to DDAC prior to OPA. Exposure to OPA alone shows Th2 skewing, indicated by increased activation of skin type 2 innate lymphoid cells, increased frequency and activation of draining lymph node B cells, and increased levels of type 2 cytokines. These findings suggest that the OPA-induced immune environment may alter the response to DDAC, resulting in increased IgE mediated immune responses. This data may partially explain the discordance between epidemiological and laboratory studies regarding disinfectants and provide insight into the potential immunological implications of mixed chemical exposures.","Shane, Hillary L; Lukomska, Ewa; Weatherly, Lisa; Baur, Rachel; Anderson, Stacey E",Toxicol. sci,,719

Therefore, it is important to keep track the number of patients being affected. The current system gives the computerized data in a collective way which is very difficult to analyze and predict the growth of disease in a particular area and in the world. Machine learning algorithms can be used to successfully map the disease and its progression to solve this problem. Machine Learning, a branch of computer science, is critical in correctly distinguishing patients with the condition by analyzing their chest X-ray photographs. Supervised Machine learning models with associated algorithms (like LR, SVR and Time series algorithms) to analyze data for regression and classification helps in training the model to predict the number of total number of global confirmed cases who will be prone to the disease in the upcoming days. In this proposed work, the overall dataset of the world is being collected, preprocessed and the number of confirmed cases up to a particular date are extracted which is given as the training set to the model. The model is being trained by supervised machine learning algorithms to predict the growth of cases in the upcoming days. The experimental setup with the above mentioned algorithms shows that Time series Holt's model outperforms Linear Regression and Support Vector Regression algorithms.","Gothai, E; Thamilselvan, R; Rajalaxmi, R R; Sadana, R M; Ragavi, A; Sakthivel, R",,,719

359297,Face Mask Detection Using OpenCV,2021,"Simple SummaryInnovative advancements in lung cancer treatment have developed over the past decade with the advent of targeted and immune therapies. Yes-associated protein (YAP), an effector of the Hippo pathway, promotes the resistance of these targeted drugs and modulates tumor immunity in lung cancer. YAP is involved in autophagy in lung cancer and plays a prominent role in forming the tubular structure in lung organoids and alveolar differentiation. In this review, we discuss the central roles of YAP in lung cancer and present YAP as a novel target for treating resistance to targeted therapies and immunotherapies in lung cancer.AbstractDespite significant innovations in lung cancer treatment, such as targeted therapy and immunotherapy, lung cancer is still the principal cause of cancer-associated death. Novel strategies to overcome drug resistance and inhibit metastasis in cancer are urgently needed. The Hippo pathway and its effector, Yes-associated protein (YAP), play crucial roles in lung development and alveolar differentiation. YAP is known to mediate mechanotransduction, an important process in lung homeostasis and fibrosis. In lung cancer, YAP promotes metastasis and confers resistance against chemotherapeutic drugs and targeted agents. Recent studies revealed that YAP directly controls the expression of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and modulates the tumor microenvironment (TME). YAP not only has a profound relationship with autophagy in lung cancer but also controls alveolar differentiation, and is responsible for tubular structure formation in lung organoids. In this review, we discuss the various roles and clinical implications of YAP in lung cancer and propose that targeting YAP can be a promising strategy for treating lung cancer.","Yoo, Geon Park Dongil Kim Yoonjoo Chung Chaeuk",Cancers,,719

METHODS: This case control study aimed to understand changes in characteristics and diagnosis of patients attending a large UK Emergency Department (ED) during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic (March-May 2020) compared with equivalent weeks in 2019. RESULTS: We found a 50.7% drop in first attendances to the ED in 2020. Likelihood of attendance and admission decreased for paediatric patients and increased for patients &#8805; 46 years, and for men. Likelihood of admission increased for all Black ethnic groups and for patients from the most deprived index of multiple deprivation quintiles. This shift to an older, male, more deprived patient population with greater representation of ethnic minority groups was amplified in the 'Infections' diagnostic category.

We aimed to examine glycemic control metrics using flash glucose monitoring during insulin treatment and the clinical outcome in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Prospective, single-center cohort of adult patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes or hyperglycemia and COVID-19 infection treated with basal bolus insulin regimen. Glycemic control was assessed with the use of intermittent Freestyle Libre flash glucose monitoring during the hospital stay. Outcome of interest were time in range [TIR], time above [TAR] and below [TBR] range, glycemic variability [coefficient of variation [% CV]), and differences in a composite of complications including ICU admission, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute kidney injury. RESULTS: A total of 60 patients were included (44 known diabetes and 16 new onset hyperglycemia). In total 190,080 data points of CGM were available, of which 72.5% of values were within the target area [TIR (70-180 mg/dL)], 22% TAR (>180 mg/dL), and 3% were TBR (<70 mg/dL). During treatment, the coefficient of variation (% CV) was 30%. There were no association with TIR, but patients with TAR >180 mg/dl had higher rates of a composite of complications (22.5% vs 16%, p = 0.04).

363424,Covid-19 CT Image Recognition Based on Multi-stage Transfer Learning,2020,"OBJECTIVE: Due to shortages of N95 respirators during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, it is necessary to estimate the number of N95s required for healthcare workers (HCWs) to inform manufacturing targets and resource allocation. METHODS: We developed a model to determine the number of N95 respirators needed for HCWs both in a single acute-care hospital and the United States. RESULTS: For an acute-care hospital with 400 all-cause monthly admissions, the number of N95 respirators needed to manage COVID-19 patients admitted during a month ranges from 113 (95% interpercentile range [IPR], 50-229) if 0.5% of admissions are COVID-19 patients to 22,101 (95% IPR, 5,904-25,881) if 100% of admissions are COVID-19 patients (assuming single use per respirator, and 10 encounters between HCWs and each COVID-19 patient per day). The number of N95s needed decreases to a range of 22 (95% IPR, 10-43) to 4,445 (95% IPR, 1,975-8,684) if each N95 is used for 5 patient encounters. Varying monthly all-cause admissions to 2,000 requires 6,645-13,404 respirators with a 60% COVID-19 admission prevalence, 10 HCW-patient encounters, and reusing N95s 5-10 times. Nationally, the number of N95 respirators needed over the course of the pandemic ranges from 86 million (95% IPR, 37.1-200.6 million) to 1.6 billion (95% IPR, 0.7-3.6 billion) as 5%-90% of the population is exposed (single-use). This number ranges from 17.4 million (95% IPR, 7.3-41 million) to 312.3 million (95% IPR, 131.5-737.3 million) using each respirator for 5 encounters. CONCLUSIONS: We quantified the number of N95 respirators needed for a given acute-care hospital and nationally during the COVID-19 pandemic under varying conditions.","Wedlock, Patrick T; O039,; Shea, Kelly J; Conte, Madellena; Bartsch, Sarah M; Randall, Samuel L; Ferguson, Marie C; Cox, Sarah N; Siegmund, Sheryl S; Kulkarni, Sarah; Nash, Denis; Lin, Michael Y; Lee, Bruce Y",Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,,719

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively studied 268 COVID-19 convalescent plasma donors and 162 COVID-19 inpatients (total 430 subjects, confirmed by RT-PCR) and 2,212 healthy volunteer first-time blood donors as a control group. These were further divided into two groups: those with anti-A (blood types O and B) and those without it (types A and AB). Titres of nucleoproteins, and neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 antibody were measured in the convalescent plasma donors and inpatients. Multivariate logistic regression and non-parametric tests were applied. RESULTS: Persons having types O or B showed less infection prevalence than those of types A or AB (OR = 0·62, 95% CI 0·50-0·78; P < 0·001), but there was no difference when COVID-19 inpatients were analysed. Immunoglobulins M, G and A were lower in COVID-19 subjects of types O or B group than those of A or AB (0·16 vs. 0·19; P = 0·03, 2·11 vs. 2·55; P = 0·02, 0·23 vs. 0·32; P = 0·03, respectively). CONCLUSION: In this retrospective cohort, COVID-19 individuals were less likely to belong to blood types O and B, and also had lower SARS-CoV-2 antibody titres than A and AB individuals.

The questionnaire was conducted online. In the survey, participants were asked about sociodemographic characteristics and opinions on domestic and foreign COVID-19 vaccines, and reasons for vaccine refusal.Results: Women were more likely to be reluctant to get a domestic (p < .001) or foreign (p < .001) COVID-19 vaccine than men. There was a significant relationship between age and vaccine acceptance (p = .01). The younger the age of the healthcare provider, the higher the rate of vaccine hesitancy (r = - 0.25). Years of professional experience were correlated with vaccine acceptance (r = 0,19, p < .05), but vaccine rejection and indecision did not change (p > .05). The factors predicting vaccine acceptance were status as a doctor, more than 10 years of professional experience, and male gender.Conclusion: More than half of the healthcare providers were willing to have a COVID-19 vaccine once available. Indecision rates were found to be high, although rejection rates were not.

The current standard for accurate diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 is laboratory-based reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Here, we report a preliminary prospective performance evaluation of the QuantuMDx Q-POC SARS CoV-2 RT-PCR assay. MethodsBetween November 2020 and March 2021, we obtained 49 longitudinal nose and throat swabs from 29 individuals hospitalised with RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 at St Georges NHS Foundation Trust, London (UK). In addition, we obtained 101 mid nasal swabs from healthy volunteers in June 2021. We then used these samples to evaluate the Q-POC SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay. The primary analysis was to compare the sensitivity and specificity of the Q-POC test against a reference laboratory-based RT-PCR assay. ResultsThe overall sensitivity of the Q-POC test compared with the reference test was 96.88% (83.78%-99.92% CI) for a cycle threshold (Ct) cut-off value for the reference test of 35 and 80.00% (64.35% to 90.95% CI) without altering the reference tests Ct cut-off value of 40. ConclusionsThe Q-POC test is a sensitive, specific and rapid point-of-care test for SARS-CoV-2 at a reference Ct cut-off value of 35. The Q-POC test provides an accurate and affordable option for RT-PCR at point-of-care without the need for sample pre-processing and laboratory handling. The Q-POC test would enable rapid diagnosis and clinical triage in acute care and other settings.","Caffry, Jessica; Selby, Matthew; Barr, Katie; Morgan, George; McGurk, David; Scully, Philip; Park, Catherine; Caridis, Anna-Maria; Southworth, Emily; Morrison, Jack; Clark, David J; Eckersley, Nicholas M; Groppelli, Elisabetta; Kirwan, Daniela E; Monahan, Irene; Augustin, Yolanda; Toombs, Colin; Planche, Tim; Staines, Henry M; Krishna, Sanjeev",,,719

385201,COVID-19 Diagnosis using X-Ray Images and Deep learning,2021,"Pandemics are nothing unusual but indeed lead to devastating effects that play a pivotal role in reshaping human history. The COVID-19 outbreak is currently responsible for major educational crises globally as most of the world has been faced with a mandated lockdown, and forced closure of educational institutions, including medical colleges. Anatomists have therefore been challenged to unlock technology in effort to achieve best deliverables for their discipline, without the use of traditional teaching aids such as the cadaver, osteological banks, prosected specimens, models, and microscopic slides. At present, the virtual classroom is the only option for the anatomist, thereby omitting vital aspects of the hidden curriculum such as ethical-reasoning, empathy, respect, professionalism, interpersonal, and communication skills. As body donations dwindle, the era of teaching in a cadaverless environment is upon us. This marks the beginning of a paradigm shift in education and research for anatomists worldwide. Given the variable pathological-morphological presentation in COVID-19-related deaths, it is also likely that the autopsy component of anatomic pathology will be resuscitated to demystify the underlying mechanisms of the virus. Since COVID-19 may never disappear completely, we would like to recommend that international anatomical societies collectively reach out to statutory bodies to devise a standardized method of teaching anatomy, employing readily available cost-effective resources, in the face of pandemics. However, if anatomy as a discipline has survived a millennium, surely anatomists can fight the ""scourges"" that have plagued them as various perspectives have been bandied about to welcome in a new normal.","Naidoo, N; Satyapal, K S; Lazarus, L",SN Compr Clin Med,,719

The primary objective of the COVID-19 Ring-based Prevention Trial with lopinavir/ritonavir (CORIPREV-LR) is to evaluate the efficacy of a 14-day course of oral lopinavir/ritonavir as PEP against COVID-19 among individuals with a high-risk exposure to a confirmed case. METHODS: This is an open-label, multicenter, 1:1 cluster-randomized trial of LPV/r 800/200 mg twice daily for 14 days (intervention arm) versus no intervention (control arm), using an adaptive approach to sample size calculation. Participants will be individuals aged > 6 months with a high-risk exposure to a confirmed COVID-19 case within the past 7 days. A combination of remote and in-person study visits at days 1, 7, 14, 35, and 90 includes comprehensive epidemiological, clinical, microbiologic, and serologic sampling. The primary outcome is microbiologically confirmed COVID-19 infection within 14 days after exposure, defined as a positive respiratory tract specimen for SARS-CoV-2 by polymerase chain reaction. Secondary outcomes include safety, symptomatic COVID-19, seropositivity, hospitalization, respiratory failure requiring ventilator support, mortality, psychological impact, and health-related quality of life. Additional analyses will examine the impact of LPV/r on these outcomes in the subset of participants who test positive for SARS-CoV-2 at baseline. To detect a relative risk reduction of 40% with 80% power at &#945; = 0.05, assuming the secondary attack rate in ring members (p0) = 15%, 5 contacts per case and intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) = 0.05, we require 110 clusters per arm, or 220 clusters overall and approximately 1220 enrollees after accounting for 10% loss-to-follow-up. We will modify the sample size target after 60 clusters, based on preliminary estimates of p0, ICC, and cluster size and consider switching to an alternative drug after interim analyses and as new data emerges. The primary analysis will be a generalized linear mixed model with logit link to estimate the effect of LPV/r on the probability of infection. Participants who test positive at baseline will be excluded from the primary analysis but will be maintained for additional analyses to examine the impact of LPV/r on early treatment. DISCUSSION: Harnessing safe, existing drugs such as LPV/r as PEP could provide an important tool for control of the COVID-19 pandemic. Novel aspects of our design include the ring-based prevention approach, and the incorporation of remote strategies for conducting study visits and biospecimen collection.

METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among doctors and nurses in the medical department in Pusat Perubatan Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia between November 18, 2020 and December 18, 2020 during the third wave of COVID-19 epidemic in Malaysia. We studied the knowledge and practice of preventive measures of COVID-19 among doctors and nurses in the COVID-19 or sudden acute respiratory infection (SARI) wards and general medical wards. Data was collected using a validated self-designed google form online-questionnaire. RESULTS: A total of 407 subjects completed the study and 80.8% were females;55.8% were aged between 30-39 years;46.4% were medical doctors. The main source of COVID-19 knowledge was the Ministry of Health Malaysia (MOH) website (35.1%). Majority (97%) had sufficient knowledge and 82% practiced proper preventive measures. Doctors had a higher mean knowledge score compared to nurses (p &lt; 0.001). HCWs working in COVID-19 or SARI wards scored higher in knowledge questions compared to those in the general medical wards (p = 0.020). Nurses practiced better preventive measures (p &lt; 0.001). Good knowledge could not be predicted based on professions (OR: 0.222, 95% CI: 0.048 - 1.028, p = 0.054). Majority were unable to recall the proper steps of donning (85.8%) and doffing (98.5%). CONCLUSIONS: Although majority had good knowledge and practiced proper preventive measures, there was a poor recall in donning and doffing steps regardless of place of practice. The MOH website is a useful platform for tailored continuous medical education and regular updates on COVID-19. Regular training and retraining on donning and doffing of PPE is needed to bridge this gap.","Ng, B. H.; Low, H. J.; Nik Nuratiqah, N. A.; Faisal, A. H.; Soo, C. I.; Periyasamy, P.; Ban, A. Y.

414131,Sentiment analysis and prediction of Indian stock market amid Covid-19 pandemic,2021,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic, was identified in late 2019 and went on to cause over 3.3 million deaths in 15 months. To date, targeted antiviral interventions against COVID-19 are limited. The spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 infection ranges from asymptomatic to fatal disease. However, the reasons for varying outcomes to SARS-CoV-2 infection are yet to be elucidated. Here we show that an endogenously activated interferon lambda (IFN{lambda}) pathway leads to resistance against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Using a well-differentiated primary nasal epithelial cell (WD-PNEC) model from multiple adult donors, we discovered that susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection, but not respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection, varied. One of four donors was resistant to SARS-CoV-2 infection. High baseline IFN{lambda} expression levels and associated interferon stimulated genes correlated with resistance to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Inhibition of the JAK/STAT pathway in WD-PNECs with high endogenous IFN{lambda} secretion resulted in higher SARS-CoV-2 titres. Conversely, prophylactic IFN{lambda} treatment of WD-PNECs susceptible to infection resulted in reduced viral titres. An endogenously activated IFN{lambda} response, possibly due to genetic differences, may be one explanation for the differences in susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans. Importantly, our work supports the continued exploration of IFN{lambda} as a potential pharmaceutical against SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Campos, Guillermo Lopez; Manzoor, Sheerien; Courtney, David; Ali, Ahlam; Touzelet, Olivier; McCaughey, Conall",,,719

414822,Prevention from COVID-19 in India: Fuzzy Logic Approach,2021,"OBJECTIVES: The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic comprises a total of more than 2,350,000 cases and 160,000 deaths. The interest in anti-coronavirus drug development has been limited so far and effective methods to prevent or treat coronavirus infections in humans are still lacking. Urgent action is needed to fight this fatal coronavirus infection by reducing the number of infected people along with the infection contagiousness and severity. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak several weeks ago, we observe in GHU PARIS Psychiatrie & Neurosciences (Sainte-Anne hospital, Paris, France) a lower prevalence of symptomatic and severe forms of COVID-19 infections in psychiatric patients (â¼4%) compared to health care professionals (â¼14%). Similar observations have been noted in other psychiatric units in France and abroad. Our hypothesis is that psychiatric patients could be protected from severe forms of COVID-19 by their psychotropic treatments. Chlorpromazine (CPZ) is a phenothiazine derivative widely used in clinical routine in the treatment of acute and chronic psychoses. This first antipsychotic medication has been discovered in 1952 by Jean Delay and Pierre Deniker at Sainte-Anne hospital. In addition, to its antipsychotic effects, several in vitro studies have also demonstrated a CPZ antiviral activity via the inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Recently, independent studies revealed that CPZ is an anti-MERS-CoV and an anti-SARS-CoV-1 drug. In comparison to other antiviral drugs, the main advantages of CPZ lie in its biodistribution: (i) preclinical and clinical studies have reported a high CPZ concentration in the lungs (20-200 times higher than in plasma), which is critical because of the respiratory tropism of SARS-CoV-2; (ii) CPZ is highly concentrated in saliva (30-100 times higher than in plasma) and could therefore reduce the contagiousness of COVID-19; (iii) CPZ can cross the blood-brain barrier and could therefore prevent the neurological forms of COVID-19. METHODS: Our hypothesis is that CPZ could decrease the unfavorable evolution of COVID-19 infection in oxygen-requiring patients without the need for intensive care, but also reduce the contagiousness of SARS-CoV-2. At this end, we designed a pilot, phase III, multicenter, single blind, randomized controlled clinical trial. Efficacy of CPZ will be assessed according to clinical, biological and radiological criteria. The main objective is to demonstrate a shorter time to response (TTR) to treatment in the CPZ+standard-of-care (CPZ+SOC) group, compared to the SOC group. Response to treatment is defined by a reduction of at least one level of severity on the WHO-Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvement (WHO-OSCI). The secondary objectives are to demonstrate in the CPZ+SOC group, compared to the SOC group: (A) superior clinical improvement; (B) a greater decrease in the biological markers of viral attack by SARS-CoV-2 (PCR, viral load); (C) a greater decrease in inflammatory markers (e.g. CRP and lymphopenia); (D) a greater decrease in parenchymal involvement (chest CT) on the seventh day post-randomization; (E) to define the optimal dosage of CPZ and its tolerance; (F) to evaluate the biological parameters of response to treatment, in particular the involvement of inflammatory cytokines. Patient recruitment along with the main and secondary objectives are in line with WHO 2020 COVID-19 guidelines. CONCLUSION: This repositioning of CPZ as an anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug offers an alternative and rapid strategy to alleviate the virus propagation and the infection severity and lethality. This CPZ repositioning strategy also avoids numerous developmental and experimental steps and can save precious time to rapidly establish an anti-COVID-19 therapy with well-known, limited and easy to manage side effects. Indeed, CPZ is an FDA-approved drug with an excellent tolerance profile, prescribed for around 70 years in psychiatry but also in clinical routine in nausea and vomiting of pregnancy, in advanced cancer and also to treat headaches in various neurological conditions. The broad spectrum of CPZ treatment - including antipsychotic, anxiolytic, antiemetic, antiviral, immunomodulatory effects along with inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis and modulation of blood-brain barrier - is in line with the historical French commercial name for CPZ, i.e. LARGACTIL, chosen as a reference to its ""LARGe ACTion"" properties. The discovery of those CPZ properties, as for many other molecules in psychiatry, is both the result of serendipity and careful clinical observations. Using this approach, the field of mental illness could provide innovative therapeutic approaches to fight SARS-CoV-2.","Plaze, M; Attali, D; Petit, A-C; Blatzer, M; Simon-Loriere, E; Vinckier, F; Cachia, A; Chrétien, F; Gaillard, R",Encephale,,719

People's adherence to control measures is affected by their knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) towards COVID-19. In this study, we investigated Chinese residents' KAP towards COVID-19 during the rapid rise period of the outbreak. An online sample of Chinese residents was successfully recruited via the authors' networks with residents and popular media in Hubei, China. A self-developed online KAP questionnaire was completed by the participants. The knowledge questionnaire consisted of 12 questions regarding the clinical characteristics and prevention of COVID-19. Assessments on residents' attitudes and practices towards COVID-19 included questions on confidence in winning the battle against COVID-19 and wearing masks when going out in recent days. Among the survey completers (n=6910), 65.7% were women, 63.5% held a bachelor degree or above, and 56.2% engaged in mental labor. The overall correct rate of the knowledge questionnaire was 90%. The majority of the respondents (97.1%) had confidence that China can win the battle against COVID-19. Nearly all of the participants (98.0%) wore masks when going out in recent days. In multiple logistic regression analyses, the COVID-19 knowledge score (OR: 0.75-0.90, P<0.001) was significantly associated with a lower likelihood of negative attitudes and preventive practices towards COVID-2019.

419886,"Geospatial mapping, Epidemiological modelling, Statistical correlation and analysis of COVID-19 with Forest cover and Population in the districts of Tamil Nadu, India",2020,"Greece emerged as the EU's poster child in the fight against COVID-19 during the first few months of the pandemic. In this contribution, we assess Greece's use of soft regulation in its regulatory response to COVID-19. Using acts of legislative content, which can be broadly conceptualised as softly adopted hard law, the Greek government largely achieved flexibility and simplified adoption procedures without having to resort to soft law per se. The role of soft law was limited - it complemented hard law rather than constituting the primary basis of COVID-19 restrictions - but not completely negligible. Soft law instruments regulated the processing of personal data, and was also pivotal in clarifying the criminal sanctioning of COVID-related rule violations. Greece's success in handling the first wave of the pandemic, while effective, was arguably unfair to asylum seekers who saw their right to apply for asylum curtailed, and their right to freedom of movement restricted when limitations on the rest of the population were lifted. With a second wave of infections currently in full swing, it is imperative to keep scrutinising regulatory responses to ensure that they place the health and dignity of every individual (whoever they might be) at their core and fully respect their fundamental rights. ©","Tsourdi, E.

420423,Using twitter to predict chart position for songs,2020,"Moodle is a widely deployed distance learning platform that provides numerous opportunities to enhance the learning process. Moodle’s importance in maintaining the continuity of education in states of emergency and other circumstances has been particularly demonstrated in the context of the COVID-19 virus’ rapid spread. However, there is a problem with personalizing the learning and monitoring of students’ work. There is room for upgrading the system by applying data mining and different machine-learning methods. The multi-agent Observer system proposed in our paper supports students engaged in learning by monitoring their work and making suggestions based on the prediction of their final course success, using indicators of engagement and machine-learning algorithms. A novelty is that Observer collects data independently of the Moodle database, autonomously creates a training set, and learns from gathered data. Since the data are anonymized, researchers and lecturers can freely use them for purposes broader than that specified for Observer. The paper shows how the methodology, technologies, and techniques used in Observer provide an autonomous system of personalized assistance for students within Moodle platforms. © 2021 by the authors.

METHODS: All consecutive COVID-19 adult patients admitted between March and June 2020 to the ICU of a referral, university hospital in Northern-Italy were enrolled. MR-proADM and routine laboratory test were measured within 48 hours from ICU admission, on day 3, 7 and 14. Survival curves difference with MR-proADM cut-off set to 1.8 nmol/L were tested using log-rank test. Predictive ability was compared using area under the curve and 95% confidence interval of different receiver-operating characteristics curves. RESULTS: 57 patients were enrolled. ICU and overall mortality were 54.4%. At admission, lymphocytopenia was present in 86% of patients; increased D-dimer and CRP levels were found in 84.2% and 87.7% of patients respectively, while PCT values > 0.5 µg/L were observed in 47.4% of patients. MR-proADM, CRP and LDH were significantly different between surviving and non-surviving patients and over time, while PCT, D-dimer and NT-pro-BNP did not show any difference between the groups and over time; lymphocytes were different between surviving and non-surviving patients only. MR-proADM was higher in dying patients (2.65±2.33vs1.18±0.47, p<0.001) and a higher mortality characterized patients with MR-proADM >1.8 nmol/L (p = 0.016). The logistic regression model adjusted for age, gender, cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus and PCT values confirmed an odds ratio = 10.3 [95%CI:1.9-53.6] (p = 0.006) for MR-proADM >1.8 nmol/L and = 22.2 [95%CI:1.6-316.9] (p = 0.022) for cardiovascular disease. Overall, MR-proADM had the best predictive ability (AUC = 0.85 [95%CI:0.78-0.90]). CONCLUSIONS: In COVID-19 ICU-patients, MR-proADM seems to have constantly higher values in non-survivor patients and predict mortality more precisely than other biomarkers. Repeated MR-proADM measurement may support a rapid and effective decision-making. Further studies are needed to better explain the mechanisms responsible of the increase in MR-proADM in COVID-19 patients.","Montrucchio, Giorgia; Sales, Gabriele; Rumbolo, Francesca; Palmesino, Filippo; Fanelli, Vito; Urbino, Rosario; Filippini, Claudia; Mengozzi, Giulio; Brazzi, Luca",PLoS One,,719

Many regulatory organizations have rightfully advocated to temporarily halt enrollment and curtail all face-to-face interactions. Views and opinions of patients and their caregivers are seldom considered while making such decisions. The objective was to study older participants' and their caregivers' perspectives to participate in ongoing clinical research during the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: Cross-sectional. SETTING: VISN-16/Geriatric Research, Education and Clinical Center (GRECC), Department of Veterans Affairs. PARTICIPANTS: Older participants and their caregivers (N = 51) enrolled in ongoing clinical research studies. MEASUREMENTS: Questions about perceptions of safety to attend research visit, the level of panic among the general public, and medical center's preparedness in handling the pandemic. Other questions identified the source of pandemic information and the preference of a phone or in-person visit. RESULTS: Mean age was 69.3 (±9.4) years, 53% were male, 39% were caregivers, and 65% were Caucasian. Majority (78%) of the participants felt safe/very safe attending the scheduled research appointment; 63% felt that the extra screening made them feel safe/very safe; 82% felt that the medical center was prepared/very prepared for the pandemic. Participants split evenly on their preference for phone versus in-person visits. Family members and television news media were the commonly used sources of pandemic information irrespective of their education. Perceptions were influenced by gender and source of information, not by age or education. Females perceived higher level of panic compared to males (P = .02). Those relying on news media felt safer compared to those that relied on family members (P = .008). CONCLUSION: Even though informants felt that the medical center was prepared to handle the pandemic, only half the participants preferred the in-person visit. Pandemic information was obtained from family members or the television news media. Knowing patients' perspectives may help researchers be better prepared for future pandemics.

We use the examples of Germany and Brazil, as opposite sides geographically and concerning the pandemic, to highlight a need for greater attention to these risks and for systematic inclusion in health systems resilience. In both countries, informal work may turn into hot spots of COVID-19, thus reinforcing social inequalities on a grand scale both nationally and globally. Our two contrasting country cases thus reveal a global threat that should be treated as such.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the influence of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) comorbidity on disease expression and outcomes, and the potential underlying mechanisms in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: A total of 961 hospitalized COVID-19 patients with a definite clinical outcome (death or discharge) were retrospectively enrolled. Demographic and clinical information were extracted from the medical records. Lung tissue sections from patients suffering from lung cancer were used for immunohistochemistry study of angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) expression. BEAS-2B cell line was stimulated with various cytokines. RESULTS: In this cohort, 21 subjects (2.2%) had COPD and 22 (2.3%) had asthma. After adjusting for confounding factors, COPD patients had higher risk of developing severe illness (OR: 23.433; 95% CI 1.525-360.135; P < .01) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (OR: 19.762; 95% CI 1.461-267.369; P = .025) than asthmatics.

METHODS: As a part of an ongoing prospective study to identify the etiology of viral respiratory infections in Spain, we performed the analysis of HCoV infections in children hospitalized in a secondary hospital in Madrid, between October 2005 and June 2018. Clinical data of HCoV patients were compared with those infected by rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus and influenza. RESULTS: The study population consisted of 5131 hospitalizations for respiratory causes in children. A total of 3901 cases (75.9%) had a positive viral identification and 205 cases (4.1%) were positive for HCoV. Only 41 cases (20%) of HCoV infection were detected as single infections. Episodes of recurrent wheezing were the most common diagnosis, and 112 children (54%) had hypoxia. Clinical data in HCoV cases were similar to those associated with rhinovirus; however, patients with HCoV were younger. Other viruses were associated with hypoxia more frequently than cases with HCoV; high fever was more common in influenza infections and bronchiolitis in respiratory syncytial virus group. Although a slight peak of circulation appears mostly in winter, HCoV has been detected throughout the year as well. CONCLUSIONS: HCoV infections represent a small fraction of respiratory infections that require hospitalization in children and their characteristics do not differ greatly from other respiratory viral infections.","Calvo, Cristina; Alcolea, Sonia; Casas, Inmaculada; Pozo, Francisco; Iglesias, María; Gonzalez-Esguevillas, Mónica; Luz García-García, María",Pediatr. infect. dis. j,,719

STUDY DESIGN: Children ages 0-22 years with suspected severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection presenting to urgent care clinics or being hospitalized for confirmed/suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection or multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) at Massachusetts General Hospital were offered enrollment in the Massachusetts General Hospital Pediatric COVID-19 Biorepository. Enrolled children provided nasopharyngeal, oropharyngeal, and/or blood specimens. SARS-CoV-2 viral load, ACE2 RNA levels, and serology for SARS-CoV-2 were quantified. RESULTS: A total of 192 children (mean age, 10.2 ± 7.0 years) were enrolled. Forty-nine children (26%) were diagnosed with acute SARS-CoV-2 infection; an additional 18 children (9%) met the criteria for MIS-C. Only 25 children (51%) with acute SARS-CoV-2 infection presented with fever; symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection, if present, were nonspecific. Nasopharyngeal viral load was highest in children in the first 2 days of symptoms, significantly higher than hospitalized adults with severe disease (P = .002). Age did not impact viral load, but younger children had lower angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 expression (P = .004). Immunoglobulin M (IgM) and Immunoglobulin G (IgG) to the receptor binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein were increased in severe MIS-C (P < .001), with dysregulated humoral responses observed. CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals that children may be a potential source of contagion in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic despite having milder disease or a lack of symptoms; immune dysregulation is implicated in severe postinfectious MIS-C.","Yonker, Lael M; Neilan, Anne M; Bartsch, Yannic; Patel, Ankit B; Regan, James; Arya, Puneeta; Gootkind, Elizabeth; Park, Grace; Hardcastle, Margot; St John, Anita; Appleman, Lori; Chiu, Michelle L; Fialkowski, Allison; De la Flor, Denis; Lima, Rosiane; Bordt, Evan A; Yockey, Laura J; D039,; Avino, Paolo; Fischinger, Stephanie; Shui, Jessica E; Lerou, Paul H; Bonventre, Joseph V; Yu, Xu G; Ryan, Edward T; Bassett, Ingrid V; Irimia, Daniel; Edlow, Andrea G; Alter, Galit; Li, Jonathan Z; Fasano, Alessio",J. pediatr.

Despite these intensive research efforts, vaccine hesitancy and misinformation in many countries present substantial obstacles to achieving sufficient coverage and community immunity. Here, we report the findings of a survey regarding the likelihood of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance in a sample of physicians in Turkey. Materials and methods An anonymous web-based survey was prepared and sent to medical doctors randomly selected from seven parts of Turkey via a text message sent to their mobile phones. Demographic data were collected, including sex (male or female), medical specialty, age, professional experience, COVID-19 history, knowledge of COVID-19 vaccines and behaviours related to vaccines against COVID-19 and other diseases. The survey was conducted over a 1-week period in December 2020. Results A total of 1,557 medical doctors responded to the survey. A total of 1,065 (68.4%) respondents were considering COVID-19 vaccination, 374 (24%) were undecided and 118 (7.6%) did not want to be vaccinated. As a result of multivariate analysis, the male gender, absence of history of COVID-19 infection, and having sufficient information about the vaccine were determined as predictive factors for willingness to vaccination. Conclusion Although trials tend to focus on the efficacy of vaccines, the results of this study indicated that the most important factor affecting the preference for a given vaccine among Turkish physicians is safety.","Civelek, Burak Yazici Ozan Ozdemir Nuriye Karacin Cengiz Surel Aziz Ahmet",International Journal of Clinical Practice,,719

METHODS: We performed a systematic search resulting in 10 studies reporting stroke frequency among COVID-19 patients, which were pooled with one unpublished series from Canada. We applied random-effects meta-analyses to estimate the proportion of stroke among COVID-19. We performed an additional systematic search for cases series of stroke in COVID-19 patients (n=125) and we pooled these data with 35 unpublished cases from Canada, USA, and Iran. We analyzed clinical characteristics and in-hospital mortality stratified into age groups (<50, 50-70, >70 years). We applied cluster analyses to identify specific clinical phenotypes and their relationship with death. RESULTS: The proportion of COVID-19 patients with stroke (1.8%, 95%CI 0.9-3.7%) and in-hospital mortality (34.4%, 95%CI 27.2-42.4%) were exceedingly high. Mortality was 67% lower in patients <50 years-old relative to those >70 years-old (OR 0.33, 95%CI 0.12-0.94, P=0.039). Large vessel occlusion was twice as frequent (46.9%) as previously reported and was high across all age groups, even in the absence of risk factors or comorbidities. A clinical phenotype characterized by older age, a higher burden of comorbidities, and severe COVID-19 respiratory symptoms, was associated with the highest in-hospital mortality (58.6%) and a 3x higher risk of death than the rest of the cohort (OR 3.52, 95%CI 1.53-8.09, P=0.003). CONCLUSIONS: Stroke is relatively frequent among COVID-19 patients and has devastating consequences across all ages. The interplay of older age, comorbidities, and severity of COVID-19 respiratory symptoms is associated with an extremely elevated mortality.","Fridman, Sebastian; Bullrich, Maria Bres; Jimenez-Ruiz, Amado; Costantini, Pablo; Shah, Palak; Just, Caroline; Vela-Duarte, Daniel; Linfante, Italo; Sharifi-Razavi, Athena; Karimi, Narges; Bagur, Rodrigo; Debicki, Derek B; Gofton, Teneille E; Steven, David A; Sposato, Luciano A",Neurology,,719

We found several-fold more transcriptional changes in the olfactory bulb than in the amygdala, consistent with our own work and that of others indicating that the olfactory bulb may be the initial and most common brain region infected. To some extent our results converge with pseudotime analysis towards common processes shared between the brain regions, possibly induced by the systemic immune reaction following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Changes in amygdala emphasized upregulation of interferon-related neuroinflammation genes, as well as downregulation of synaptic and other neuronal genes, and may represent the substrate of reported acute and subacute COVID-19 neurological effects. Additionally, and only in olfactory bulb, we observed an increase in angiogenesis and platelet activation genes, possibly associated with microvascular damages induced by neuroinflammation. Through coexpression analysis we identified two key genes (CAMK2B for the synaptic neuronal network and COL1A2 for the angiogenesis/platelet network) that might be interesting potential targets to reverse the effects induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Finally, in olfactory bulb we detected an upregulation of olfactory and taste genes, possibly as a compensatory response to functional deafferentation caused by viral entry into primary olfactory sensory neurons. In conclusion, we were able to identify transcriptional profiles and key genes involved in neuroinflammation, neuronal reaction and olfaction induced by direct CNS infection and/or the systemic immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Piras, Ignazio S; Huentelman, Matt; Walker, Jessica; Arche, Richard; Glass, Michael; Vargas, Daisy; Sue, Lucia; Intorcia, Anthony; Nelson, Courtney; Suszczewicz, Katsuko; Borja, Claryssa; Desforges, Marc; Deture, Michael; Dicksond, Dennis; Beach, Thomas; Serrano, Geidy",,,719

Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) have shown its efficacy in the treatment of behaviour disorders. This study aims to evaluate an online mindfulness-based brief intervention skill named 'STOP (Stop, Take a Breath, Observe, Proceed) touching your face' in reducing face-touching behaviour. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This will be an online-based, randomised, controlled, trial. We will recruit 1000 participants, and will randomise and allocate participants 1:1 to the 'STOP touching your face' (both 750-word text and 5 min audio description by online) intervention group (n=500) and the wait-list control group (n=500). All participants will be asked to monitor and record their face-touching behaviour during a 60 min period before and after the intervention. Primary outcome will be the efficacy of short-term mindfulness-based 'STOP touching your face' intervention for reducing the frequency of face-touching. The secondary outcomes will be percentage of participants touching their faces; the correlation between the psychological traits of mindfulness and face-touching behaviour; and the differences of face-touching behaviour between left-handers and right-handers. Analysis of covariance, regression analysis, &#967;2 test, t-test, Pearson's correlations will be applied in data analysis. We will recruit 1000 participants from April to July 2020 or until the recruitment process is complete. The follow-up will be completed in July 2020.

Recently, anticoagulation has shown to decrease mortality, but it is unclear whether this contributes to increased GI bleeding. The aims of this study are: (i) to examine whether there are risk factors for GI bleeding in COVID-19 patients and (ii) to study whether there is a mortality difference between hospitalized patients with COVID-19 with and without GI bleeding. METHODS: This is a propensity score matched case-control study from a large health system in the New York metropolitan area between March 1st and April 27th. COVID-19 patients with GI bleeding were matched 1:1 to COVID-19 patients without bleeding using a propensity score that took into account comorbidities, demographics, GI bleeding risk factors and length of stay. RESULTS: Of 11, 158 hospitalized with COVID-19, 314 patients were identified with GI bleeding. The point prevalence of GI bleeding was 3%. There were no identifiable risk factors for GI bleeding. Use of anticoagulation medication or antiplatelet agents was not associated with increased risk of GI bleeding in COVID-19 patients. For patients who developed a GI bleed during the hospitalization, there was an increased mortality risk in the GI bleeding group (OR 1.58, P = 0.02). CONCLUSION: Use of anticoagulation or antiplatelet agents was not risk factors for GI bleeding in a large cohort of hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

Yet, important questions such as how deadly it is or its degree of spread within different countries remain unanswered. In this work, we exploit the 'universal' increase of the mortality rate with age observed in different countries since the beginning of their respective outbreaks, combined with the results of the antibody prevalence tests in the population of Spain, to unveil both unknowns. We test these results with an analogous antibody rate survey in the canton of Geneva, Switzerland, showing a good agreement. We also argue that the official number of deaths over 70 years old might be importantly underestimated in most of the countries, and we use the comparison between the official records with the number of deaths mentioning COVID-19 in the death certificates to quantify by how much. Using this information, we estimate the infection fatality ratio (IFR) for the different age segments and the fraction of the population infected in different countries assuming a uniform exposure to the virus in all age segments. We also give estimations for the non-uniform IFR using the sero-epidemiological results of Spain, showing a very similar increase of the fatality ratio with age. Only for Spain, we estimate the probability (if infected) of being identified as a case, being hospitalized or admitted in the intensive care units as function of age. In general, we observe a nearly exponential increase of the fatality ratio with age, which anticipates large differences in total IFR in countries with different demographic distributions, with numbers that range from 1.82% in Italy, to 0.62% in China or even 0.14% in middle Africa.","Seoane, Beatriz",PLoS One,,719

The questionnaire could only be answered once by each nurse via a WeChat account. The submitted answers were verified by 2 researchers. RESULTS The results showed that the rate of interruption of work among nurses in the isolation ward was 25%, and the rate of nurses experiencing a negative experience was 96.9%. The results of univariate analysis showed that the following factors were related to the work interruption of the nurses in the isolation ward (all P<0.05): emergency public incident training; emergency public incident treatment experience; knowledge of COVID-19 pneumonia; hours worked per shift in the quarantine area; and negative physiologic experience. Logistic regression analysis showed that negative experience, hours worked per shift, and emergency public incident training were the independent factors influencing work interruption among nurses in the isolation wards. CONCLUSIONS The incidence of interruption of work among nurses in the isolation ward was 25%. Negative experiences, long working hours per shift, and lack of emergency public incident training made the nurses more prone to work interruption.","Zhou, Xiao-Juan; Dang, Yuan-Yuan; Wang, Xia; Yang, Wen-Zhang; Lu, Wei; Zhang, Jian-Hua",Med Sci Monit,,719

With hopes for release of a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine underway, understanding parental perception of vaccines is important to design successful vaccination interventions. Methods: A web-based, cross-sectional survey was administered to approximately 900 parents in Johnson County, Kansas during the summer of 2020. Pearson chi square and Mann-Whitney U tests were utilized to assess the attitudes of Kansas parents towards a potential addition of the influenza vaccine to the required list for K-12 students and furthermore, their general perception of vaccinations, and the impact of COVID-19 on those beliefs. Results: A total of 179 parents responded. Fifty-one percent (n = 92) were in favor of adding the influenza vaccine to the mandatory list (Pro-Addition). Anti-Addition parents had significantly higher levels of distrust (2.1, p &lt; 0.001) and were significantly more concerned about vaccine adverse effects. When presented with a hypothetical situation in which a ""safe and effective"" COVID-19 vaccine was available, 24% of Anti-Addition parents indicated they would receive the vaccine or obtain it for their children (21 people, p &lt; 0.001). Conclusions: Kansas suburban parents were split on their attitudes towards the addition of the influenza vaccine to the required list for children and the effects of the pandemic. Follow-up qualitative studies of Anti-Addition parents are critical for successful vaccine distribution and coverage in the communities.","Beatty, S. D.; Villwock, J.",Kansas Journal of Medicine,,719

A structured review was conducted in PubMed, ScienceDirect, LILACS, SciELO, the Cochrane Library and Google Scholar on COVID-19 and ophthalmology. The Oxford Centre for Evidence Based Medicine 2011 Levels of Evidence worksheet was used for quality assessments. 1018 items were identified in the search; 26 records were included in the qualitative synthesis, which encompassed 6 literature reviews, 10 case series or cross-sectional studies, 4 case reports, and 6 intervention descriptions. Seventeen out of 26 records (65%) were categorized as level 5 within the Oxford CBME methodology grading system, the rest were level 4. The evidence generated on COVID-19 and ophthalmology to date is limited, although this is understandable given the circumstances. Both the possible presence of viral particles in tears and conjunctiva, and the potential for conjunctival transmission remain controversial. Ocular manifestations are not frequent and could resemble viral infection of the ocular surface. Most recommendations are based on the strategies implemented by Asian countries during previous coronavirus outbreaks. There is a need for substantive studies evaluating these strategies in the setting of SARS-CoV-2. In the meantime, plans for applying these measures must be implemented with caution, taking into account the context of each individual country, and undergo regular evaluation.","Emparan, Juan Pablo Olivares-de; Sardi-Correa, Carolina; López-Ulloa, Juan Alberto; Viteri-Soria, Jaime; Penniecook, Jason A; Jimenez-Román, Jesús; Lansingh, Van C",Arq Bras Oftalmol,,719

Studies report that the lifetimerate of developing DFU is 25% for patients with diabetes mellitus. In addition, peripheral artery disease (PAD) is seen in approximately 50% of patients with DFU. PAD increases the risk of amputation in patients with DFU and complicates treatment. This study aimed to compare the effects of cilostazol and aspirin on wound healing in patients with DFU and PAD. In the study, DFU patients with PAD were retrospectively reviewed. They were divided into two groups. One group was administeredcilostazoland the other was administeredaspirin. Patients were evaluated according to their demographic characteristics, wound characteristics, PAD symptoms, duration of treatment, and treatment grades. There were 30 patients in the cilostazol group and 20 patients in the aspirin group. Of the patients in the cilostazol group, seven(23.3%) had Wagner's grade 2, 16 (53.3%) had grade 3, and seven (23.3%) had grade 4 DFU. In the aspirin group this rate was 25%, 55%, and 20%, respectively. The mean size of the wound in the cilostazol group was 8.1 cm (2-25 cm), whereas it was 7.6 cm (5-25 cm) in the aspirin group. The mean ankle-brachial index (ABI) of the patients was 0.90 in the cilostazol group and 0.96 in the aspirin group. Five (23.3%) of the patients in the cilostazol group had triphasic, 19 (63.3%) biphasic, and six(20%) monophasic currents in the distal popliteal vein. In the aspirin group, these rates were 35%, 50%, and 20%, respectively. Of the patients in the cilostazol group, according to the Fontaine classification, six(20%) had stage 2A, 11 (36.7%) had stage 2B, 10 (33.3%) had stage 3, and three(10%) had stage 4 symptoms. In the aspirin group, these rates were 45%, 40%, 15%, and 0%, respectively. There was a complete response to treatment in 27 patients (90%) in the cilostazol group and 11 patients (55%) in the aspirin group. Partial response was present in the other patients. The mean duration of treatment was 1.31 months (1-2 months) in the cilostazol group and 1.82 months (1-2.5 months) in the aspirin group. In this study, it was observed that wound healing was faster in the cilostazol group, complete response to treatment was higher, and improvement in PAD symptoms was better compared to the aspirin group.

From there, viral genomes from all over the world have followed at an outstanding rate, reaching already more than 105 on early May 2020, and more than 106 by early March 2021. Phylodynamics methods have been designed in recent years to process such datasets and infer population dynamics and sampling intensities in the past. However, the unprecedented scale of the SARS-CoV-2 dataset now calls for new methodological developments, relying e.g. on simplifying assumptions of the mutation process. In this article, I build on the infinite alleles model stemming from the field of population genetics to develop a new Bayesian statistical method allowing the joint reconstruction of the outbreaks effective population sizes and sampling intensities through time. This relies on prior conjugacy properties that prove useful both to develop a Gibbs sampler and to gain intuition on the way different parameters of the model are linked and inferred. I finally illustrate the use of this method on SARS-CoV-2 genomes sequenced during the first wave of the outbreak in four distinct European countries, thus offering a new perspective on the evolution of the sampling intensity through time in these countries from genetic data only.","Manceau, Marc",,,719

As of February 2021, there were 107 million COVID-19 cases worldwide. As a comparison, there are approximately 38 million people living with human immunodeficiency virus (PLHIV) worldwide. The coexistence of both epidemics, and the syndemic effect of both viruses could lead to a delirious impact both at individual and community levels. Many intersecting points were found between severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of COVID-19, and HIV; among which, gastrointestinal (GI) manifestations are the most notable. GI manifestations represent a common clinical presentation in both HIV and SARS-CoV-2. The emergence of GI symptoms as a result of SARS-CoV-2 infection provides a new dynamic to COVID-19 diagnosis, management, and infection control measures, and adds an additional diagnostic challenge in case of coinfection with HIV. The presence of GI manifestations in PLHIV during the COVID-19 pandemic could be referred to HIV enteropathy, presence of opportunistic infection, adverse effect of antiretrovirals, or coinfection with COVID-19. Thus, it is important to exclude SARS-CoV-2 in patients who present with new-onset GI manifestations, especially in PLHIV, to avoid the risk of disease transmission during endoscopic interventions. Structural similarities between both viruses adds a valuable intersecting point, which has mutual benefits in the management of both viruses. These similarities led to the hypothesis that antiretrovirals such as lopinavir/Rironavir have a role in the management of COVID-19, which was the target of our search strategy using the available evidence. These similarities may also facilitate the development of an efficient HIV vaccine in the future using the advances in COVID-19 vaccine development.","Cordie, Ahmed; Gaber, Yasmine; AbdAllah, Mohamed; Vergori, Alessandra; Kharono, Brenda; Omran, Salma; Afify, Shimaa; Karkouri, Mehdi; Chakroun, Mohamed; Musa, Sherief; Moorhouse, Michelle; Esmat, Gamal",Arab J Gastroenterol,,719

We study the data in the framework of time series network data. The networks are defined by using the geodesic distances of the districts or cities specified by the latitude and longitude coordinates. We particularly restrict our analysis to all but districts in the north-eastern part of India. Unlike recent studies on the projection of the number of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the near future, in this note, the emphasis is on understanding the dynamics of the spread of the virus across the districts of India. We perform spectral and structural analysis of the model networks by considering several measures, notably the spectral radius, the algebraic connectivity, the average clustering coefficient, the average path length and the structure of the communities. Furthermore, we study the overall expansion properties given by the number of districts or cities before and after lockdown. These studies show that lockdown has a significant impact on the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in districts or cities over long distances. However, this impact is only observed after approximately two weeks of lockdown. We speculate that this happened due to the insufficient number of tests for COVID-19 before the lockdown which could not stop the movement of people infected with the virus but not detected, over long distances.","Pandey, Pradumn Kumar; Adhikari, Bibhas",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.11973v1.pdf,719

In a female patient with right sided arch transection of the lusory artery was followed by transposition into the right common carotid artery. The central stump 10 years later gradually expanded and the saccular aneurysm indicated intervention. After complete arch debranching thoracic endograft was implanted. In this group of patients with variable surgical and hybrid procedures neither complication nor mortality occurred.","Dzsinich, Csaba; Darabos, Gábor; Székely, László; Barta, László; Vallus, Gábor; Tóth, Tamás; Szentpétery, László",Magy Seb,,719

501046,Correction to: SARS-COV-2 infection in children and newborns: a systematic review,2021,"BACKGROUND: The measurement of body temperature has become commonplace in the current COVID-19 pandemic. Body temperature can be measured using thermal infrared imaging, a safe, non-contact method that relies on the emissivity of the skin being known to provide accurate readings. Skin pigmentation affects the absorption of visible light and enables us to see variations in skin colour. Pigmentation may also affect the absorption of infrared radiation and thus affect thermal imaging. Human skin has an accepted emissivity of 0.98 but the effect of different skin pigmentation on this value is not known. In this study, we investigated the influence of different skin pigmentation on thermal emissivity in 65 adult volunteers. METHODS: A reference object of known emissivity (electrical tape) was applied to participant's skin on the inner upper arm. Tape and arm were imaged simultaneously using a thermal infrared camera. The emissivity was set on the camera to the known value for electrical tape. The emissivity was altered manually until the skin temperature using thermal imaging software was equal to the initial tape temperature. This provided the calculated emissivity value of the skin. Participants were grouped according to skin pigmentation, quantified using the Fitzpatrick skin phototyping scale and reflectance spectrophotometry. Differences in emissivity values between skin pigmentation groups were assessed by one-way ANOVA. RESULTS: The mean calculated emissivity for the 65 participants was 0.972 (range 0.96-0.99). No significant differences in emissivity were observed between participants when grouped by skin pigmentation according to the Fitzpatrick scale (p = 0.859) or reflectance spectrophotometry (p = 0.346). CONCLUSION: These data suggest that skin pigmentation does not affect thermal emissivity measurement of skin temperature using thermal infrared imaging. This study will aid further research into the application of thermal infrared imaging as a screening or bedside diagnostic tool in clinical practice.","Charlton, Matthew; Stanley, Sophie A; Whitman, Zoë; Wenn, Victoria; Coats, Timothy J; Sims, Mark; Thompson, Jonathan P",PLoS One,,719

The data were analyzed by estimation of simple correlation coefficients and a Preacher and Hayes's mediation procedure. RESULTS: Participants reported elevated levels of stress (7-8 sten on the sten scale developed for the PSS-10 questionnaire). Statistically significant differences in the stress levels between nurses, paramedics and physicians could not determined. In contrast, significant association between mental health outcomes and occupational category could not be found. Coping mediated the relationship between coping strategies and mental health outcomes. A positive and significant relationship was observed between stress, dysfunctional coping strategies and mental health.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Twenty-five patients with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction confirmed COVID-19 and at least one marker of cardiac involvement [cardiac symptoms, abnormal electrocardiograph (ECG), or abnormal cardiac biomarkers] and 25 healthy age- and gender-matched control subjects were recruited to the study. Patients were divided into those with elevated (n = 8) or normal TnI (n = 17). There were significant differences in global longitudinal strain among patients who were positive and negative for hs-TnI, and controls [-12.3 (-13.3, -11.5)%, -13.1 (-14.2, -9.8)%, and -15.7 (-18.3, -12.7)%, P = 0.004].

STUDY DESIGN: Prospective quantification of aerosol and droplet generation during clinical simulation of rigid and flexible laryngoscopy. METHODS: Two healthy volunteers were recruited to undergo both flexible and rigid laryngoscopy. An OPS was used to quantify aerosols and droplets generated for four positive controls relative to ambient particles (speech, breathing, /e/ phonation, and /ae/ phonation) and for five test interventions relative to breathing and phonation (flexible laryngoscopy, flexible laryngoscopy with humming, flexible laryngoscopy with /e/ phonation, rigid laryngoscopy, and rigid laryngoscopy with /ae/ phonation). Particle counts in mean diameter size range from 0.3 to >10 µm were measured with OPS placed at 12 cm from the subject's nose/mouth. RESULTS: None of the laryngoscopy interventions (n = 10 each) generated aerosols above that produced by breathing or phonation. Breathing (n = 40, 1-3 µm, P = .016) and /ae/ phonation (n = 10, 1-3 µm, P = .022; 3-5 µm. P = .083; >5 µm, P = .012) were statistically significant producers of aerosols and droplets. Neither speech nor /e/ phonation (n = 10 each) were associated with statistically significant aerosols and droplet generation. CONCLUSIONS: Using OPS to detect droplets and aerosols, we found that office laryngoscopy is likely not an aerosol-generating procedure. Despite its prior use in otolaryngological literature, an OPS has intrinsic limitations. Our study should be complemented with more sophisticated methods of droplet distribution measurement.

OBJECTIVE: To examine relationships between suicide and acute inpatient psychiatric bed occupancy and other community, hospital and patient factors. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study using administrative and publicly available data for contextual community factors. The study sample included all veterans enrolled in VHA primary care in 2011-2016 associated with 111 VHA hospitals with acute inpatient psychiatric units. Acute psychiatric bed occupancy, as a measure of access to care, was the main exposure of interest and was categorised by quarter as per cent occupied using thresholds of &#8804;85%, 85.1%-90%, 90.1%-95% and >95%. Hospital-level analyses were conducted using generalised linear mixed models with random intercepts for hospital, modelling number of suicides by quarter with a negative binomial distribution. RESULTS: From 2011 to 2016, the national incidence of suicide among enrolled veterans increased from 39.7 to 41.6 per 100 000 person-years. VHA psychiatric bed occupancy decreased from a mean of 68.2% (IQR 56.5%-82.2%) to 65.4% (IQR 53.9%-79.9%). VHA hospitals with the highest occupancy (>95%) in a quarter compared with &#8804;85% had an adjusted incident rate ratio (IRR) for suicide of 1.10 (95% CI 1.01 to 1.19); no increased risk was observed for 85.1%-90% (IRR 0.96; 95% CI 0.89 to 1.03) or 90.1%-95% (IRR 0.96; 95% CI 0.89 to 1.04) compared with &#8804;85% occupancy. Of hospital and community variables, suicide risk was not associated with number of VHA or non-VHA psychiatric beds or amount spent on community mental health. Suicide risk increased by age categories, seasons, geographic regions and over time. CONCLUSIONS: High VHA hospital occupancy (>95%) was associated with a 10% increased suicide risk for veterans whereas absolute number of beds was not, suggesting occupancy is an important access measure. Future work should clarify optimal bed occupancy to meet acute psychiatric needs and ensure adequate bed distribution.","Kaboli, Peter J; Augustine, Matthew R; Haraldsson, Bjarni; Mohr, Nicholas M; Howren, M Bryant; Jones, Michael P; Trivedi, Ranak",BMJ qual. saf.

The aim of the study is to investigate the demographic, clinical, and laboratory characteristics in suspected COVID-19 patients in our institution. METHODS: In this retrospective study, we investigated suspected COVID-19 patients admitted to the University of Alabama at Birmingham with a request for an interleukin-6 send-out test, from March 28 to June 27, 2020. Patients' demographic, clinical, and laboratory characteristics were collected by chart review. RESULTS: Fifty patients suspected with COVID-19 were included in our study, of whom 24 patients were positive with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection and 26 were negative. During the observation period, 30 patients were discharged, 17 died during hospitalization, and three remained in hospital. Compared to non-COVID-19 patients, COVID-19 patients had older age, more comorbidities, and elevated levels of inflammation markers such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), serum ferritin, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). However, there was no significant difference in laboratory data between survivors and nonsurvivors in COVID-19 patients in our study. CONCLUSION: This study indicated that potential risk factors of older age, multiple comorbidities, and high levels of ESR, CRP, serum ferritin, and LDH could help the clinician to identify potential COVID-19 patients.

METHODS: We performed a multicenter retrospective study of 836 cases in Hubei. To avoid the collinearity among the indicators, principal component analysis (PCA) followed by partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS‐DA) was performed to obtain an overview of laboratory assessments. Multivariable logistic regression analysis and multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression analysis were respectively used to explore risk factors associated with disease severity and mortality. Survival analysis was performed in patients with the most common comorbidities. RESULTS: Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and prealbumin were associated with disease severity in patients with or without comorbidities, indicated by both PCA/PLS‐DA and multivariable logistic regression analysis. The mortality risk was associated with age, LDH, C‐reactive protein (CRP), D‐dimer, and lymphopenia in patients with comorbidities. CRP was a risk factor associated with short‐term mortality in patients with hypertension, but not liver diseases; additionally, D‐dimer was a risk factor for death in patients with liver diseases. CONCLUSIONS: Lactate dehydrogenase was a reliable predictor associated with COVID‐19 severity and mortality in patients with different medical conditions. Laboratory biomarkers for mortality risk were not identical in patients with comorbidities, suggesting multiple pathophysiological mechanisms following COVID‐19 infection.","Chen, Zaishu; Zhang, Furong; Hu, Weihua; Chen, Qijian; Li, Chang; Wu, Longlong; Zhang, Zhuheng; Li, Bin; Ye, Qifa; Mei, Jin; Yue, Jiang",J Clin Lab Anal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33112011/; https://doi.org/10.1002/jcla.23644,719

This study describes gut microbiota dysbiosis in COVID-19 patients and its implications relating to the disease. Design: A cross sectional prospective study was performed on thirty RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Bhopal, India, between September 10 and 20, 2020. Ten healthy volunteers were recruited as the control group. IFN, TNF, and IL-21 profiling was conducted using plasma samples, and gut bacterial analysis was performed after obtaining the metagenomics data of stool samples. Results: Patients with a variable COVID-19 severity showed distinct gut microflora and peripheral interleukin-21 levels. A low Firmicute/Bacteroidetes ratio, caused by the depletion of the fibre-utilizing bacteria, F. prausnitzii, B. Plebius, and Prevotella, and an increase in Bacteroidetes has associated gut microbiota dysbiosis with COVID-19 disease severity.

655117,"Editorial for the Topical Issue “Evolution, the New AI Revolution”",2021-08-28,"[Image: see text] Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the newly emerged human coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Due to the highly contagious nature of SARS-CoV-2, it has infected more than 137 million individuals and caused more than 2.9 million deaths globally as of April 13, 2021. There is an urgent need to develop effective novel therapeutic strategies to treat or prevent this infection. Toward this goal, we focused on the development of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) directed against the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (SARS-CoV-2 Spike) present on the surface of virus particles as well as virus-infected cells. We isolated anti-SARS-CoV-2 Spike mAbs from animals immunized with a DNA vaccine. We then selected a highly potent set of mAbs against SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and evaluated each candidate for their expression, target binding affinity, and neutralization potential using complementary ACE2-blocking and pseudovirus neutralization assays. We identified a total of 10 antibodies, which specifically and strongly bound to SARS-CoV-2 Spike, blocked the receptor binding domain (RBD) and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) interaction, and neutralized SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, the glycomic profile of the antibodies suggested that they have high Fc-mediated effector functions. These antibodies should be further investigated for elucidating the neutralizing epitopes on Spike for the design of next-generation vaccines and for their potential in diagnostic as well as therapeutic utilities against SARS-CoV-2.","Bordoloi, Devivasha; Xu, Ziyang; Ho, Michelle; Purwar, Mansi; Bhojnagarwala, Pratik; Cassel, Joel; Giron, Leila B.; Walker, Susanne; Kulkarni, Abhijeet J; Ruiz, Edgar Tello; Choi, Jihae; Zaidi, Faraz I.; Wu, Yuanhan; Wang, Shaoying; Patel, Ami; Ramos, Stephanie; Smith, Trevor; Kulp, Daniel; Ugen, Kenneth E.; Srinivasan, Alagarsamy; Abdel-Mohsen, Mohamed; Humeau, Laurent; Weiner, David B.; Muthumani, Kar",ACS Pharmacol Transl Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34396059/; https://doi.org/10.1021/acsptsci.1c00058,719
685867,Association of specific viral infections with childhood asthma exacerbations,2018-09-27,"BACKGROUND: During February 2020, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic in Hubei Province, China, was at its height, requiring isolation of the population. This study aimed to compare the emotional state, somatic responses, sleep quality, and behavior of people in Hubei Province with non-endemic provinces in China during two weeks in February 2020. MATERIAL/METHODS: Questionnaires were completed by 939 individuals (357 men; 582 women), including 33 from Hubei and 906 from non-endemic provinces. The Stress Response Questionnaire (SRQ) determined the emotional state, somatic responses, and behavior. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was used to measure the duration of sleep and sleep quality. RESULTS: There were 939 study participants, aged 18–24 years (35.89%) and 25–39 years (35.57%); 65.92% were university students. During a two week period in February 2020, the emotional state and behavior of participants in Hubei improved, but the quality of sleep did not. Health workers and business people became increasingly anxious, but other professionals became less anxious. The data showed that most people in Hubei Province developed a more positive attitude regarding their risk of infection and the chances of surviving the COVID-19 epidemic. CONCLUSIONS: During a two-week period, front-line health workers and people in Hubei Province became less anxious about the COVID-19 epidemic, but sleep quality did not improve. Despite public awareness, levels of anxiety exist that affect the quality of life during epidemics, including periods of population quarantine. Therefore, health education should be combined with psychological counseling for vulnerable individuals.","Yuan, Shuai; Liao, Zhenxin; Huang, Haojie; Jiang, Boyue; Zhang, Xueyan; Wang, Yingwen; Zhao, Mingyi",Med Sci Monit,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32294078/; https://doi.org/10.12659/msm.923767,719
