41036,"2020, une année pas comme les autres !",2020-10-20,"Liver fibrosis is not an independent disease. It refers to the abnormal proliferation of connective tissues in the liver caused by various pathogenic factors. Thus far, liver fibrosis has been considered to be associated with a set of factors, such as viral infection, alcohol abuse, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and autoimmune hepatitis, as well as genetic diseases. To date, clinical therapeutics for liver fibrosis still face challenges, as elimination of potential causes and conventional antifibrotic drugs cannot alleviate fibrosis in most patients. Recently, potential therapeutic targets of liver fibrosis, such as metabolism, inflammation, cell death and the extracellular matrix, have been explored through basic and clinical research. Therefore, it is extremely urgent to review the antihepatic fibrosis therapeutics for treatment of liver fibrosis in current clinical trials.","Guo, Yue-Cheng; Lu, Lun-Gen",J Clin Transl Hepatol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7562798/,741

46366,Flipped classroom in the second decade of the Millenia: a Bibliometrics analysis with Lotka’s law,2021-03-04,"Many observers worry that growing numbers of international institutions with overlapping functions undermine governance effectiveness via duplication, inconsistency and conflict. Such pessimistic assessments may undervalue the mechanisms available to states and other political agents to reduce conflictual overlap and enhance inter-institutional synergy. Drawing on historical data I examine how states can mitigate conflict within Global Governance Complexes (GGCs) by dissolving or merging existing institutions or by re-configuring their mandates. I further explore how “order in complexity” can emerge through bottom-up processes of adaptation in lieu of state-led reform. My analysis supports three theoretical claims: (1) states frequently refashion governance complexes “top-down” in order to reduce conflictual overlap; (2) “top-down” restructuring and “bottom-up” adaptation present alternative mechanisms for ordering relations among component institutions of GGCs; (3) these twin mechanisms ensure that GGCs tend to (re)produce elements of order over time–albeit often temporarily. Rather than evolving towards ever-greater fragmentation and disorder, complex governance systems thus tend to fluctuate between greater or lesser integration and (dis)order.","Eilstrup-Sangiovanni, Mette",Rev Int Organ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7914044/,741
47562,The Impact of Merger and Acquisition on Value Creation: An Empirical Evidence,2021-02-01,"The present time is characterized by constant economic, social and cultural, political changes that cover the whole world. In the conditions of globalization there are cardinal shifts in the sphere of international relations and international business, characterized by transformational, modernizing changes, and have a direct impact on the development of economies around the world, including Ukraine. Globalization has also contributed to the formation of a new era - the era of information society. By the transition to the information society, the level of social and economic development is related to the access to information resources. A new economic sector is being created, where intellectual, social and investment capital place an increased role. The aim of the study is to assess the relationship between FDI attraction in Ukraine and its main macroeconomic indicators in the context of socio-economic development of business and globalization. The novelty is the substantiation of the directions of attraction of investments in the economy of Ukraine. The study is based on the analyzed macroeconomic indicators for the period 1998–2018, which made it possible to select those that have the greatest impact on FDI. The method of modeling economic processes is used to identify the effect of global influence on attracting foreign investment as a socio-economic component of strategic business development in the economy of Ukraine. The results of the simulation showed: achieving a high level of dynamics of FDI attraction in Ukraine in recent years; the existence of a strong link between FDI and foreign trade.","Tkalenko, Svitlana; Derii, Zhanna; Zakharin, Sergii; Zakharina, Maryna; Viblyi, Petro",Advances in Digital Science,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7972086/,741
47582,The Influence of Entrepreneurial Orientation on SMEs Performance in Ghana: The Role of Social Capital and Government Support Policies,2021-02-01,"The article is aimed at developing the methodology of internal control of equity, considered from the standpoint of accounting and economic approaches through the development of a descriptive structural and logical model of internal control, taking into account the characteristics of equity. In order to achieve this goal, it is necessary: first, to determine the features of equity capital as an object of internal control from the standpoint of accounting and economic approaches; second, to develop and justify a descriptive structural and logical model of internal control of equity. Technique for Internal Control of Company’s Equity is designed through the development of a structural and logical model that takes into account the peculiarities of equity capital and considers it from the standpoint of both accounting and economic approaches based on accounting software. The results of the study can be implemented in the formation of an internal control system focused on creating value in commercial organizations. In particular, the developed structural and logical model allows us to systematize and improve such types of support within the internal control system as: regulatory, conceptual, organizational and methodological, information, technological, which contributes to a systematic approach to conducting internal control of equity and creates a basis for the development of its methods in the conditions of digital transformation and uncertainty of the external environment.","Bogataya, I.

55433,The effect of the e-mentoring-based education program on professional development of preschool teachers,2021-07-03,"The coronavirus pandemic is a global health crisis of recent times and the biggest threat we have faced after the Second World War. This viral infection (COVID-19) is not the only cause of deaths in this pandemic. A usual complication of viral infections is a secondary superimposed bacterial infection or a superinfection. Based on limited published data, the relatively high incidence of severe infection and mortality in COVID-19 patients is attributed to these infections. It is reasonable to anticipate that nearly half of the patients who have died from COVID-19 had superinfection. Patients who have severe form of the disease and those requiring prolonged stay in intensive care units (ICUs) are more prone to developing super added infection by nosocomial pathogens. The most common type of infection observed among COVID-19 patients is ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), followed by bacteremia with sepsis and urinary tract infections (UTIs). Antibiotics are commonly prescribed to keep these infections at bay which is promoting antimicrobial resistance (AMR). In developing countries like India, where there is well-established high burden of multidrug-resistant organisms in hospital settings, superinfections in COVID-19 patients can pose a biggest challenge in the treatment leading to increase mortality. There is a need of prospective studies, which should include clinical, microbiological, and epidemiological data on superinfections that can be used in forming effective antimicrobial stewardship strategies; which can have a crucial role in optimal antimicrobial prescribing.","Nag, Vijaya Lakshmi; Kaur, Navneet",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8247813/,741

We are also able confirm that most of the transportation components are well‐equipped to deal with the remainder of the pandemic and the recovery phase. Notably, innovation created new services, cost‐saving technologies, safety innovations, new institutions, networks, and channels of communication that operated effectively to address the pandemic.

In doing so, the article reveals the importance of long-standing heterodox threads, namely, the role of history, political economy, institutional structures, local culture, social psychology, and international relations. In contrast to neoliberalism’s theoretical fallacies and destructive socio-economic outcomes, it is argued here that purposeful developmental intervention is crucial as it can promote the growth, positioning, quality, and competitiveness of local industries in international markets. The line of argument of this contribution is as follows. Through a lens of political history, the first section analyzes the country’s past development efforts. Subsequently, the main sections discuss important aspects of an alternative economic development framework in the context of China; these are based on a highly interventionist, heterodox, developmental state analysis and are examined by placing special emphasis on its politico-institutional and sociocultural traits. Finally, summary and conclusions end the paper.","Arestis, Philip; Karagiannis, Nikolaos; Lee, Sangkwon",Rev Evol Polit Econ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8397864/,741

The physiological functions of SULT1C enzymes still remain to be fully understood. In this study, common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), a promising primate animal model, was used to investigate the functional relevance of the SULT1C subfamily. Gene database search revealed three intact SULT1C genes and a pseudogene in its genome. These four genes were named SULT1C1, SULT1C2, SULT1C3P, and SULT1C5, according to the sequence homology and gene location. Since SULT1C5 is the orthologous gene for human SULT1C2P, we propose, here, to revisit the designation of human SULT1C2P to SULT1C5P. Purified recombinant SULT1C enzymes showed sulfating activities toward a variety of xenobiotic compounds and thyroid hormones. Kinetic analysis revealed high catalytic activities of SULT1C1 and SULT1C5 for 3,3'-T2. It appears therefore that SULT1C isoforms may play a role in the thyroid hormone metabolism in common marmoset.","Kurogi, Katsuhisa; Manabe, Yoko; Liu, Ming-Cheh; Suiko, Masahito; Sakakibara, Yoichi","Bioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry",https://doi.org/10.1093/bbb/zbab141; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34370005/,741
163543,Development of Virtual Laboratory for the Study of Centrifugal Pump Cavitation and Performance in a Pipeline Network,2021,"Despite all scientific advancements, the spread of infectious diseases continue to pose a significant challenge to the health and prosperity of our society. Therefore, the prevention and control of infectious diseases that have the potential of becoming global threats is a central priority of public health. However, the silent emergence and uncontrolled global spread of the novel virus called SARS-COV-2 has proven that neither governments nor healthcare systems are prepared to respond to a pandemic. As an example, the coming of the coronavirus (COVID-19) has not only disrupted economies and collapsed healthcare systems, but also filled hospitals and separated people from their families and work across the globe. While the outbreak originated in China, the pandemic's epicenter moved to the US, which has more cases than any country in the world (New York accounted for nearly more than one-third of the country's coronavirus infections). As the US continues to adapt its response to the evolving situation of the virus, the nation's coronavirus pandemic has highlighted many practical uses for blockchain-based applications. Motivated by this, we present a solution for fighting the coronavirus outbreak - and future pandemic outbreaks - in the US using IOTA and QR code technology. In this paper, we propose CoviReader: a decentralized healthcare management system that shares user's data anonymously. The system is built on the IOTA tangle platform and provides users detailed, unchangeable, and easy access to their personal information. CoviReader handles authentication, confidentiality, transparency and data sharing (with crucial considerations when revising confidential information). Users interact with IOTA's tangle via a mobile application which holds a FIREBASE database. The purpose of this short paper is to demonstrate a working prototype by which we assess and analyze strategies for mitigating the consequences of the COVID-19 health crisis in the US.","Cisneros, B.; Ye, J.

To address this problem, we introduce PISCES (Protein-activity Inference for Single Cell Studies), an integrated analytical framework for the protein activity-based analysis of single cell subpopulations. PISCES leverages the assembly of lineage-specific gene regulatory networks, to accurately measure activity of each protein based on the expression its transcriptional targets (regulon), using the ARACNe and metaVIPER algorithms, respectively. It implements novel analytical and visualization functions, including activity-based cluster analysis, identification of cell state repertoires, and elucidation of master regulators of cell state and cell state transitions, with full interoperability with Seurat’s single-cell data format. Accuracy and reproducibility assessment, via technical and biological validation assays and by assessing concordance with antibody and CITE-Seq-based measurements, show dramatic improvement in the ability to identify rare subpopulations and to assess activity of key lineage markers, compared to gene expression analysis.","Obradovic, Aleksandar; Vlahos, Lukas; Laise, Pasquale; Worley, Jeremy; Tan, Xiangtian; Wang, Alec; Califano, Andrea",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.20.445002,741
183382,Coronavirus infection in the laboratory rat: immunization trials using attenuated virus replicated in L-2 cells.,1991,"The late 2019 outbreak of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) had an indelible imprint on the humanity. The world is recovering from the outbreak but there is danger of a second wave of the outbreak. To get rid of the outbreak it is necessary to prevent the viral transmission and it is need of the hour to maintain social distancing and wear masks in public areas. The governments are providing strict guidelines to wear masks in public places. It is not manually feasible to check if people are wearing masks or not. In this paper, process of detecting face masks in public places is automated using Convolutional Neural Networks by performing comparative analysis on Sequential bi-layered CNN, VGG-16 CNN and MobileNetV2 CNN architectures. Among these three architectures MobileNetV2 outperformed with a performance accuracy of 99.2%. The efficient Deep Learning architecture of detecting face masks can be achieved with the help of IoT (Internet of Things) devices and cameras, of those who are not following guidelines in public places. Such a system is very useful in post outbreak period and can be installed in public places such as Railway Stations, Airports, Parks, Schools, colleges, offices etc. to track and ensure wearing of masks by people. The contribution of this paper is not to reel-off the finding from the original paper on Face Mask detection with various architectures rather to provide results on the efficiency of using the MobileNetV2 architecture in comparison with Sequential CNN and VGG-16 architectures for crowd analysis mask detection.","Akash Manish, Lad Mishra Anubhav Rajagopalan Arul",Journal of Physics: Conference Series,https://doi.org/10.1088/1742-6596/1969/1/012037,741
185514,Efficacy of a transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus with an altered ORF-3 gene.,2001,"Wastewater-based surveillance is a cost-effective concept for monitoring COVID-19 pandemics at a population level. Here, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was monitored from a total of 693 wastewater (WW) influent samples from 28 wastewater treatment plants (WWTP, N = 21-42 samples per WWTP) in Finland from August 2020 to May 2021, covering WW of ca. 3.3 million inhabitants (~ 60% of the Finnish population). The relative quantity of SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments in the 24h-composite samples was determined by using the ultrafiltration method followed by nucleic acid extraction and RT-qPCR assay targeted with N2-assay. SARS-CoV-2 RNA signals at each WWTP were compared over time to the numbers of new and confirmed COVID-19 cases in the sewer network area. Over the 10-month surveillance period, the detection rate of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in WW was 79% (including 6% uncertain results), while only 24% of all samples exhibited gene copy (GC) numbers above the quantification limit. The range of the SARS-CoV-2 detection rate in WW varied from 33% (including 10% uncertain results) in Pietarsaari to 100% in Espoo. Only six out of 693 WW samples were positive with SARS-COV-2 RNA when the reported COVID-19 case number from the preceding 14 days was zero. Overall, the 14-day COVID-19 incidence was 7.0, 18 and 36 cases within the sewer network area when the probability to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater samples was 50%, 75% and 95%, respectively. The quantification of SARS-CoV-2 GC required significantly more COVID-19 cases: the quantification rate was 50%, 75% and 95% when the 14-day incidence was 110, 152 and 223 COVID-19 cases, respectively, per 100 000 persons. Multiple linear regression confirmed the relationship between the COVID-19 incidence and the SARS-CoV-2 GC quantified in WW at 15 out of 28 WWTPs (overall R2 = 0.36, p < 0.001). At four of the 13 WWTPs where a significant relationship was not found, the GC of SARS-CoV-2 RNA remained below the quantification limit during the whole study period. In the five other WWTPs, the sewer coverage was less than 80% of the total population in the area and thus the COVID-19 cases may have been inhabitants from the areas not covered. Based on the results obtained, WW-based surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 could be used as an indicator for local and national COVID-19 incidence trends. Importantly, the determination of SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments from WW is a powerful and non-invasive public health surveillance measure, independent of possible changes in the clinical testing strategies or in the willingness of individuals to be tested for COVID-19.","Tiwari, A.; Lipponen, A.; Hokajarvi, A.-M.; Luomala, O.; Sarekoski, A.; Rytkonen, A.; Osterlund, P.; Al-Hello, H.; Juutinen, A.; Miettinen, I.

Global warming trends predicted in the 2007 Intergovernmental Panel on Climatic Change (IPCC) report for South America are likely to change the temporal and geographical distribution of infectious diseases, including those that are vector-borne such as bluetongue, West Nile fever, vesicular stomatitis and New World screwworm. Changes in distribution will be partially modulated by El Niño Southern Oscillation events, which will become more frequent and lead to a greater frequency of droughts and floods. Active disease surveillance for animal diseases in South America, particularly for vector-borne diseases, is very poor. Disease reporting is often lacking, which affects knowledge of disease distribution and impact, and preparedness for early response. Improved reporting for animal diseases that may be affected by climate change is needed for better prevention and intervention measures in susceptible livestock, wildlife and vectors in South America. This requires contributions from multidisciplinary experts, including meteorologists, epidemiologists, biologists and ecologists, and from local communities.","Pinto, J; Bonacic, C; Hamilton-West, C; Romero, J; Lubroth, J",Revue scientifique et technique,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18819680/,741
192748,Exposure of feral swine (Sus scrofa) in the United States to selected pathogens.,2015,"The RNA replication complexes of small positive-strand RNA viruses such as poliovirus are known to form on the surfaces of membranous vesicles in the cytoplasm of infected mammalian cells. These membranes resemble cellular autophagosomes in their double-membraned morphology, cytoplasmic lumen, lipid-rich composition and the presence of cellular proteins LAMP 1 and LC3. Furthermore, LC3 protein is covalently modified during poliovirus infection in a manner indistinguishable from that observed during bona fide autophagy. This covalent modification can also be induced by the expression of viral protein 2BC in isolation. However, differences between poliovirus-induced vesicles and autophagosomes also exist: the viral-induced membranes are smaller, at 200-400 nm in diameter, and can be induced by the combination of two viral proteins, termed 2BC and 3A. Experimental suppression of expression of proteins in the autophagy pathway was found to reduce viral yield, arguing that this pathway facilitates viral infection, rather than clearing it. We have hypothesized that, in addition to providing membranous surfaces for assembly of viral RNA replication complexes, double-membraned vesicles provide a topological mechanism to deliver cytoplasmic contents, including mature virus, to the extracellular milieu without lysing the cell.","Taylor, Matthew P; Kirkegaard, Karla",Autophagy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18094610/,741

In addition to these traditionally recognized activities, the nucleolus also participates in many other aspects of cell function. The umbravirus-encoded ORF3 protein is a multifunctional RNA-binding protein involved in long-distance RNA movement, and protection of viral RNA from RNase attack, including possibly small interfering RNA-guided RNA silencing. In addition to its presence in cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein particles containing viral RNA, the umbraviral ORF3 protein accumulates in nuclei, preferentially targeting nucleoli. The ORF3 protein domains involved in the localization of the protein to the nucleolus were identified. Functional analysis of the mutants revealed the correlation between the ORF3 protein nucleolar localization and its ability to form the cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein particles and transport viral RNA long distances via the phloem. Possible mechanisms of the nucleolar involvement in systemic virus infection are discussed.","Kim, S H; Ryabov, E V; Brown, J W S; Taliansky, M",Biochemical Society transactions,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15270674/,741

In patients with COVID-19, elevated high sensitive troponin (hs-TnI) levels are frequent independent from the underlying cardiovascular disease. However, the relationship between high troponin levels and LVGLS in such patients remains unknown. We aimed to investigate the relation between troponin levels and LVGLS values in patients with COVID-19. A total of thirty-eight patients diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia who underwent echocardiography examination within the first week of hospital admission were enrolled in our study. Patients were divided into two groups according to their hs-TnI levels. Conventional left venticular (LV) function parameters, including ejection fraction, LV diastolic and systolic volumes were obtained and LVGLS was determined using 2D-STE. Frequency of hypertension, diabetes mellitus and current smoking were similar among groups.

These circumstances affect the length of stay (LOS) or degree of crowding in the ED. The processes for patients with acute critical illness, such as cerebrovascular disease (CVD), can be also delayed. Using the process mining (PM) method, this study aimed to evaluate LOS, ED processes for CVD, and delayed processes during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. (2) Methods: Data were collected from the Clinical Data Warehouse of a medical center. Phase 1 included patients who visited the ED before the COVID-19 outbreak. In Phase 2, post-COVID-19 ED patients were divided into the COVID-19 tested group (CTG) and COVID-19 not tested group (CNTG) according to whether polymerase chain reaction test was performed. We analyzed patients' ED processes before and after COVID-19 using the PM method. We analyzed patients with acute CVD separately to determine whether the process and LOS of patients with acute critical illness were changed or delayed. (3) Results: After the COVID-19 outbreak, the overall LOS was delayed and all processes in CTG patients were delayed. Registration to triage and triage were delayed in both CTG and CNTG patients. The brain imaging process for CTG patients with acute CVD was also delayed. (4) Conclusion: After a pandemic, some processes were changed, new processes were developed, and processes for patients with acute CVD who needed proper time management were not exempted.","Chang, Hansol; Yu, Jae Yong; Yoon, Sun Young; Hwang, Sung Yeon; Yoon, Hee; Cha, Won Chul; Sim, Min Seob; Jo, Ik Joon; Kim, Taerim",,,741

Silver nanoparticles (AgNP) have been studied to possess antiviral properties and are presumed to inhibit SARS-CoV-2. Due to the need for an effective agent against SARS-CoV-2, we evaluated the antiviral effect of AgNPs. We evaluated a plethora of AgNPs of different sizes and concentration and observed that particles of diameter around 10 nm were effective in inhibiting extracellular SARS-CoV-2 at concentrations ranging between 1 and 10 ppm while cytotoxic effect was observed at concentrations of 20 ppm and above. Luciferase-based pseudovirus entry assay revealed that AgNPs potently inhibited viral entry step via disrupting viral integrity. These results indicate that AgNPs are highly potent microbicides against SARS-CoV-2 but should be used with caution due to their cytotoxic effects and their potential to derange environmental ecosystems when improperly disposed.","Jeremiah, Sundararaj S; Miyakawa, Kei; Morita, Takeshi; Yamaoka, Yutaro; Ryo, Akihide",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,,741

Researchers and companies around the world are working on all the possible strategies to develop a curative or preventive strategy for the same, which includes vaccine development, drug repurposing, plasma therapy, and drug discovery based on Artificial intelligence. Therapeutic approaches based on Computational biology and Machine-learning algorithms are specially considered, with a view that these could provide a fast and accurate outcome in the present scenario. As an effort towards developing possible therapeutics for COVID-19, we have used machine-learning algorithms for the generation of alignment kernels from diverse viral sequences of Covid-19 reported from India, China, Italy and USA. Using these diverse sequences we have identified the conserved motifs and subsequently a peptide library was designed against them. Of these, 4 peptides have shown strong binding affinity against the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 (Mpro) and also maintained their stability and specificity under physiological conditions as observed through MD Simulations. Our data suggest that these evolutionary peptides against COVID-19 if found effective may provide cross-protection against diverse Covid-19 variants.","Kabra, Ritika; Singh, Shailza",Biochim Biophys Acta Mol Basis Dis,,741
273604,An SEIR infectious disease model with testing and conditional quarantine,2020,"Moped-style scooters are one of the most popular systems of micro-mobility. They are undoubtedly good for the city, as they promote forms of environmentally-friendly mobility, in which flexibility helps prevent traffic build-up in the urban centers where they operate. However, their increasing numbers are also generating conflicts as a result of the bad behavior of users, their unwarranted use in public spaces, and above all their parking. This paper proposes a methodology for finding parking spaces for shared motorcycle services using Geographic information system (GIS) location-allocation models and Global Positioning System (GPS) data. We used the center of Madrid and data from the company Muving (one of the city’s main operators) for our case study. As well as finding the location of parking spaces for motorbikes, our analysis examines how the varying distribution of demand over the course of the day affects the demand allocated to parking spaces. The results demonstrate how reserving a relatively small number of parking spaces for scooters makes it possible to capture over 70% of journeys in the catchment area. The daily variations in the distribution of demand slightly reduce the efficiency of the network of parking spaces in the morning and increase it at night, when demand is strongly focused on the most central areas.","Pérez-Fernández, Onel García-Palomares Juan Carlos",ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information,,741

Doctors, nurses, therapists and other non-care staff in clinics and hospitals are asked to be prepared to work in particularly complex and stressful situations, which makes them vulnerable to mental health problems. OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence and clinical characteristics of anxiety and depression symptoms in staff working at a health institution in Medellin, Colombia. METHODS: Observational, descriptive and cross-sectional study, based on a survey designed for the investigation, which included two scales to screen depression and anxiety symptoms, as well as sociodemographic variables. RESULTS: A total of 1,247 workers from the health institution were included. Of these, 14.6% reported symptoms of depression and 18.5% of clinically significant anxiety. A higher proportion of moderate to severe depression and anxiety symptoms was found in those working face to face. CONCLUSIONS: Anxiety and depression symptoms are highly prevalent among staff at a health institution in Medellin, Colombia, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Given the vital role of the health sector in times of pandemic, the development of mental health programmes that address the problems of this population should be considered a priority.","Restrepo-Martínez, Miguel; Escobar, Marcela; Marín, Luz Aida; Restrepo, Diana",Rev. colomb. psiquiatr,,741

Due to limited resources and inferior technological capacities, developing countries including Vietnam have faced many challenges in combating the pandemic. Since the first cases were detected on 23 January 2020, Vietnam has undergone a 3-month fierce battle to control the outbreak with stringent measures from the government to mitigate the adverse impacts. In this study, we aim to give insights into the Vietnamese government's progress during the first three months of the outbreak. Additionally, we relatively compare Vietnam's response with that of other Southeast Asia countries to deliver a clear and comprehensive view on disease control strategies. Methods: The data on the number of COVID-19 confirmed and recovered cases in Vietnam was obtained from the Dashboard for COVID-19 statistics of the Ministry of Health (https://ncov.vncdc.gov.vn/). The review on Vietnam's country-level responses was conducted by searching for relevant government documents issued on the online database 'Vietnam Laws Repository' (https://thuvienphapluat.vn/en/index.aspx), with the grey literature on Google and relevant official websites. A stringency index of government policies and the countries' respective numbers of confirmed cases of nine Southeast Asian countries were adapted from the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/research-projects/coronavirus-government-response-tracker). All data was updated as of 24 April 2020. Results: Preliminary positive results have been achieved given that the nation confirmed no new community-transmitted cases since 16 April and zero COVID-19 - related deaths throughout the 3-month pandemic period. To date, the pandemic has been successfully controlled thanks to the Vietnamese government's prompt, proactive and decisive responses including mobilization of the health care systems, security forces, economic policies, along with a creative and effective communication campaign corresponding with crucial milestones of the epidemic's progression. Conclusions: Vietnam could be one of the role models in pandemic control for low-resource settings. As the pandemic is still ongoing in an unpredictable trajectory, disease control measures should continue to be put in place in the foreseeable short term.","Tran, Thi Phuong Thao; Le, Thanh Ha; Nguyen, Thi Ngoc Phuong; Hoang, Van Minh",J Glob Health,,741
294299,Bayesian adaptive clinical trials for anti-infective therapeutics during epidemic outbreaks,2020,"The outbreak of the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to the recommended routine use of face masks to reduce exposure risk. In this study, the increase in work of breathing (WOB) imposed by face masks is theoretically studied for both normals and patients with obstructive and restrictive lung diseases at different levels of activity. The results show a significant increase in WOB due to face masks, which is more severe in higher activity levels. The added WOB is considerable during physical activity and may be intolerable for patients with preexisting lung disease and may contribute to inspiratory muscle fatigue and dyspnea. Moreover, in this study, the effects of the physical properties of a fibrous medium, including thickness, porosity, and fiber diameter, are analyzed on the particle filtration efficiency (PFE) and the added WOB. The relations between the physical properties of the fibrous medium and the added WOB and the PFE are shown on some contour plots as a quick and simple tool to select the desired physical properties for a single layer filter to ensure that the added WOB is comfortable while the PFE is sufficiently high.","Monjezi, Mojdeh Jamaati Hamidreza",Medical engineering & physics,,741

This pattern of daily water consumption is called the water demand profile. The initiatives to create these profiles are to improve hydraulic performance and to build energy conservation strategies for designed networks in Dubai. Therefore, the aim of the work presented here was to develop and analyze a domestic consumption profile for selected developments with socio-demographic factors including weekday/weekend variation, population, income, fasting during the month of Ramadan, and the outbreak of COVID-19. Data from more than 7000 smart meters were collected while water meters of more than 350 residential flats were examined manually. Water demand profiles generated from the data showed weekdays have more predictable peaks (morning 6-8 am and evening 5-7 pm) than weekends. During Ramadan, peak hours shifted to 7-10 am followed by 3-4 pm during workdays while peaks for low-income areas were higher due to a stricter working routine. The COVID-19 crisis has led to significant rise in observed consumption, with over a 30% increase during the month of Ramadan. The observed results, if compared with further end-use studies on more factors affecting demand profiles, can help in generating both cost and energy efficient networks.","Rizvi, S.; Rustum, R.; Deepak, M.; Wright, G.

324716,Simple planning problem for COVID-19 lockdown,2020,"BACKGROUND: Vaccination is crucial to limit the pandemic spread of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19. Therefore, besides the development and supply of vaccines, it is essential that sufficient individuals are willing to get vaccinated, but concerning proportions of populations worldwide show vaccine hesitancy. This makes it important to determine factors that are associated with vaccine acceptance. METHODS: 1779 adults of a non-probability convenience sample in Germany were assessed with an online survey in a cross-sectional survey period from 1st to 11th January 2021 (a few days after the beginning of vaccinations in Germany). RESULTS: 64.5% of the sample stated that they absolutely would accept the vaccination, 13.8% would rather accept it, 10.4% were undecided, and 5.2% would rather not and 6.0% absolutely not get vaccinated. COVID-19-related anxiety, and fears of infection and health-related consequences correlated significantly positively with vaccine acceptance (all p < .001). In contrast, social (p = .006) and economic fears (p < .001) showed significant negative associations with vaccination willingness. The broader constructs of unspecific anxiety and depressive symptoms were not significantly associated with vaccine acceptance. Vaccine acceptance differed between users/non-users of social media and official websites to gain information about the pandemic (p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19-related anxiety and health-related fears were associated with higher vaccine acceptance, whereas the fear of social and economic consequences showed the contrary direction. These findings highlight the need to differentiate between several types of fears and anxiety to predict their influence on vaccine acceptance, and provide important information and an essential base for future studies and interventions.","Bendau, Antonia; Plag, Jens; Petzold, Moritz Bruno; Ströhle, Andreas",Int Immunopharmacol,,741

The aim of the research is to determine if particulate matter (PM) has been the primary cause of the high CoViD-19 spread rapidity in some areas of Northern Italy. Data of PM for all the 41 studied cities were collected from the local environmental protection agencies. To compare air quality data with epidemiological data, a statistical analysis was conducted identifying the correlation matrices of Pearson and Spearman, considering also the possible incubation period of the disease. Moreover, a model for the evaluation of the epidemic risk, already proposed in literature, was used to evaluate a possible influence of PM on CoViD-19 spread rapidity. The results exclude that PM alone was the primary cause of the high CoVid-19 spread rapidity in some areas of Northern Italy. Further developments are necessary for a better comprehension of the influence of atmospheric pollution parameters on the rapidity of spread of the virus SARS-CoV-2, since a synergistic action with other factors (such as meteorological, socio-economic and cultural factors) could not be excluded by the present study.","Collivignarelli, Maria Cristina; Abbà, Alessandro; Caccamo, Francesca Maria; Bertanza, Giorgio; Pedrazzani, Roberta; Baldi, Marco; Ricciardi, Paola; Carnevale Miino, Marco",,,741

In this article, we speculate different theories why this novel agent is sparing neonates, infants, and young children. The low severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection in this population is associated with a high incidence of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic infection making them efficient carriers.

He was hospitalized and anticoagulant therapy was started. Nine days after admission, the patient appeared increasingly psychotic and suffered from hallucinations as well as paranoid thoughts. After treatment with risperidone and valproate, the patient's condition improved. At a follow-up 1 month after discharge, he was completely recovered regarding the respiratory, cardiac, and psychic situation.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the risk of COVID-19, COVID-19-associated hospitalization, and mortality among patients with psoriasis treated by IL-17I. METHODS: A population-based cohort study was performed to compare psoriasis patients treated by IL-17I (n = 680) with those treated by methotrexate (n = 2,153) and non-systemic/non-immunomodulatory treatments (n = 138,750) regarding the incidence of COVID-19 and its complications. RESULTS: The use of IL-17I was not associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 infection [adjusted HR for IL-17I vs. methotrexate: 0.91 (95% CI, 0.48-1.72); IL-17I vs. non-systemic/non-immunomodulatory treatments: 0.92 (95% CI, 0.54-1.59)]. IL-17I was associated with comparable risk of COVID-19-associated hospitalization [adjusted HR for IL-17I vs. methotrexate: 0.42 (95% CI, 0.05-3.39); IL-17I vs. non-systemic/non-immunomodulatory treatments: 0.65 (95% CI, 0.09-4.59)] and COVID-19-associated mortality [adjusted HR for IL-17I vs. methotrexate: 7.57 (95% CI, 0.36-157.36); IL-17I vs. non-systemic/non-immunomodulatory treatments: 7.05 (95% CI, 0.96-51.98)]. In a sensitivity analysis, neither secukinumab nor ixekizumab imposed an elevated risk of any of the outcomes of interests.

360076,Demographic perspectives on mortality of COVID-19 and other epidemics,2020,"Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) share a target receptor with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The use of ACEIs/ARBs may cause angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor upregulation, facilitating the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into host cells. There is concern that the use of ACEIs/ARBs could increase the risks of severe COVID-19 and mortality. The impact of discontinuing these drugs in patients with COVID-19 remains uncertain. We aimed to assess the association between the use of ACEIs/ARBs and the risks of mortality and severe disease in patients with COVID-19. A systematic search was performed in PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and MedRxiv.org from December 1, 2019, to June 20, 2020. We also identified additional citations by manually searching the reference lists of eligible articles. Forty-two observational studies including 63,893 participants were included. We found that the use of ACEIs/ARBs was not significantly associated with a reduction in the relative risk of all-cause mortality [odds ratio (OR) = 0.87, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) = 0.75-1.00;I &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 57%, p = 0.05]. We found no significant reduction in the risk of severe disease in the ACEI subgroup (OR = 0.95, 95% CI = 0.88-1.02, I &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 50%, p = 0.18), the ARB subgroup (OR = 1.03, 95% CI = 0.94-1.13, I &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 62%, p = 0.48), or the ACEI/ARB subgroup (OR = 0.83, 95% CI = 0.65-1.08, I &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 67%, p = 0.16). Moreover, seven studies showed no significant difference in the duration of hospitalization between the two groups (mean difference = 0.33, 95% CI = -1.75 to 2.40, p = 0.76). In conclusion, the use of ACEIs/ARBs appears to not have a significant effect on mortality, disease severity, or duration of hospitalization in COVID-19 patients. On the basis of the findings of this meta-analysis, there is no support for the cessation of treatment with ACEIs or ARBs in patients with COVID-19.","Dai, X. C.; An, Z. Y.; Wang, Z. Y.; Wang, Z.

It is well-known that the spread of the disease is influenced by people’s willingness to adopt preventative public health behaviors, which are often associated with public risk perception. In this study, we present the first assessment of public risk perception of COVID-19 around the world using national samples (total N = 6,991) in ten countries across Europe, America, and Asia. We find that although levels of concern are relatively high, they are highest in the UK compared to all other sampled countries. Pooled across countries, personal experience with the virus, individualistic and prosocial values, hearing about the virus from friends and family, trust in government, science, and medical professionals, personal knowledge of government strategy, and personal and collective efficacy were all significant predictors of risk perception. Although there was substantial variability across cultures, individualistic worldviews, personal experience, prosocial values, and social amplification through friends and family in particular were found to be significant determinants in more than half of the countries examined. Risk perception correlated significantly with reported adoption of preventative health behaviors in all ten countries. Implications for effective risk communication are discussed.","Dryhurst, Sarah; Schneider, Claudia R.; Kerr, John; Freeman, Alexandra L.

368122,COVID-19 and the macroeconomic effects of costly disasters,2020,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is spreading around the globe since December 2019. There is an urgent need to develop sensitive and online methods for on-site diagnosing and monitoring of suspected COVID-19 patients. With the huge development of Internet of Things (IoT), the impact of Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) provides an impressive solution to this problem. In this paper, we proposed a 5G-enabled fluorescence sensor for quantitative detection of spike protein and nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 by using mesoporous silica encapsulated up-conversion nanoparticles (UCNPs@mSiO2) labeled lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA). The sensor can detect spike protein (SP) with a detection of limit (LOD) 1.6 ng/mL and nucleocapsid protein (NP) with an LOD of 2.2 ng/mL. The feasibility of the sensor in clinical use was further demonstrated by utilizing virus culture as real clinical samples. Moreover, the proposed fluorescence sensor is IoMT enabled, which is accessible to edge hardware devices (personal computers, 5G smartphones, IPTV, etc.) through Bluetooth. Medical data can be transmitted to the fog layer of the network and 5G cloud server with ultra-low latency and high reliably for edge computing and big data analysis. Furthermore, a COVID-19 monitoring module working with the proposed the system is developed on a smartphone application (App), which endows patients and their families to record their medical data and daily conditions remotely, releasing the burdens of going to central hospitals. We believe that the proposed system will be highly practical in the future treatment and prevention of COVID-19 and other mass infectious diseases.","Guo, Jiuchuan; Chen, Shuqin; Tian, Shulin; Liu, Ke; Ni, Jian; Zhao, Ming; Kang, Yuejun; Ma, Xing; Guo, Jinhong",Biosens Bioelectron,,741

RESULTS: The final structural model was well reflected by fit indices. The research model of international students' intention to wear a mask for protection against COVID-19 was acceptable. All of the hypotheses were supported. Attitude and perceived behavioral control (PBC) were positively related to behavior intention (BI), respectively. Subjective norm (SN) also had a direct effect on attitude, PBC, and BI. CONCLUSIONS: Referring to TPB was useful in identifying determinants of mask-wearing. The strongest predictor was SN, which indicated it was deserving of increased attention.

Scopus, Web of Science and Google Scholar databases were searched for studies published during the first 6 months of the COVID-19 outbreak. 44 articles were included in the review. Narrative synthesis showed that knowledge was largely based on expert assessments of prior bereavement research and professional experience; there is so far absence of empirical evidence linking features of COVID-19 bereavement situations to health outcomes. Severe negative consequences have been consistently predicted by authors. There is still relatively little consideration of positive or compensatory processes or the possibility that these could alleviate the effect of the shocking, traumatic circumstances. With two notable exceptions, there has been lack of attention to the role of theoretical models for guiding research and practice. A theoretical perspective (the Dual Process Model, DPM) was applied to the information derived from the available articles. Two features of the DPM framework illustrated its relevance: 1. It enables systematic assessment of the range of loss- and restoration-related challenges for the bereaved; 2. It speaks for extension of psychotherapeutic intervention to manage secondary, restoration- as well as primary, loss-oriented stressors; studies have demonstrated that this may increase the effectiveness of intervention. Directions for future research and DPM application are suggested.","Stroebe, Margaret; Schut, Henk",Omega (Westport),,741

Harnessing the predictive powers of Machine Learning within a 6 dimensional infection kinetic model, depicting interactive evolution of 6 infection stages - healthy susceptible ($H$), predisposed comorbid susceptible ($P$), infected ($I$), recovered ($R$), herd immunized ($V$) and mortality ($D$) - the model, PHIRVD, provides the first accurate mortality prediction of 18 countries at varying stages of strategic lockdown, up to 30 days beyond last data training. PHIRVD establishes mortality-to-infection ratio as the correct pandemic descriptor, substituting reproduction number, and highlights the importance of early and prolonged but strategic lockdown to contain secondary relapse. Significance Statement: 1. Accurate prediction of the day-by-day mortality profiles of 18 countries, 30 days beyond the last data of data training. 2. Precise quantification of the impact of early-vs-later lockdown impositions. 3. Accurate prediction of secondary relapse timelines/ 4. Establishment of mortality-to-infected ratio as the correct pandemic descriptor substituting the popular choice of reproduction number, a proven failure in predicting future infection kinetics and secondary surge. The outcomes have potential to redefine healthy policy landscape, particularly in light of secondary relapse and possible future SARS-COV/Ebola group incursion.","Chattopadhyay, Amit k; Choudhury, Debajyot; Ghosh, Goutam; Kundu, Bidisha; Nath, Sujit Kumar",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.05280v1.pdf,741
390282,Covid-19 and the power of rules,2021,"As social distancing and lockdown orders grew more pervasive, individuals increasingly turned to social media for support, entertainment, and connection to others. We posit that global health emergencies - specifically, the COVID-19 pandemic - change how and what individuals self-disclose on social media. We argue that IS research needs to consider how privacy (self-focused) and social (other-focused) calculus have moved some issues outside in (caused by a shift in what is considered socially appropriate) and others inside out (caused by a shift in what information should be shared for the public good). We identify a series of directions for future research that hold potential for furthering our understanding of online self-disclosure and its factors during health emergencies.","Nabity-Grover, Teagen; Cheung, Christy M K; Thatcher, Jason Bennett",Int J Inf Manage,,741
391957,Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on outpatient providers in the US,2020,"Objective: To explore a modified CT scoring system, its feasibility for disease severity evaluation and its predictive value in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Methods: This study was a multi-center retrospective cohort study. Patients confirmed with COVID-19 were recruited in three medical centers located in Beijing, Wuhan and Nanchang from January 27, 2020 to March 8, 2020. Demographics, clinical data, and CT images were collected. CT were analyzed by two emergency physicians of more than ten years' work experience independently through a modified scoring system. Final score was determined by average score from the two reviewers if consensus was not reached. The lung was divided into 6 zones (upper, middle, and lower on both sides) by the level of trachea carina and the level of lower pulmonary veins. The target lesion types included ground-glass opacity (GGO), consolidation, overall lung involvement, and crazy-paving pattern. Bronchiectasis, cavity, pleural effusion, etc., were not included in CT reading and analysis because of low incidence. The reviewers evaluated the extent of the targeted patterns (GGO, consolidation) and overall affected lung parenchyma for each zone, using Likert scale, ranging from 0-4 (0=absent; 1=1%-25%; 2=26%-50%; 3=51%-75%; 4=76%-100%). Thus, GGO score, consolidation score, and overall lung involvement score were sum of 6 zones ranging from 0-24. For crazy-paving pattern, it was only coded as absent or present (0 or 1) for each zone and therefore ranging from 0-6. Results: A total of 197 patients from 3 medical centers and 522 CT scans entered final analysis. The median age of the patients was 64 years, and 54.8% were male. There were 76(38.8%) patients had hypertension and 30(15.3%) patients had diabetes mellitus. There were 75 of the patients classified as moderate cases, as well as 95 severe cases and 27 critical cases. As initial symptom, dry cough occurred in 170 patients, 134 patients had fever, and 125 patients had dyspnea. Reparatory rate, oxygen saturation, lymphocyte count and CURB 65 score on admission day varied among patients with different disease severity scale. There were 50 of the patients suffered from deterioration during hospital stay. The median time consumed for each CT by clinicians was 86.5 seconds. Cronbach's alpha for GGO, consolidation, crazy-paving pattern, and overall lung involvement between two clinicians were 0.809, 0.712, 0.678, and 0.906, respectively, showing good or excellent inter-rater correlation. There were 193 (98.0%) patients had GGO, 147 (74.6%) had consolidation, and 126(64.0%) had crazy-paving pattern throughout clinical course. Bilateral lung involvement was observed in 183(92.9%) patients. Median time of interval for CT scan in our study was 7 days so that the whole clinical course was divided into stages by week for further analysis. From the second week on, the CT scores of various types of lesions in severe or critically patients were higher than those of moderate cases. After the fifth week, the course of disease entered the recovery period. The CT score of the upper lung zones was lower than that of other zones in moderate and severe cases. Similar distribution was not observed in critical patients. For moderate cases, the ground glass opacity score at the second week had predictive value for the escalation of the severity classification during hospitalization. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.849, the best cut-off value was 5 points, with sensitivity of 84.2% and specificity of 75.0%. Conclusions: It is feasible for clinicians to use the modified semi-quantitative CT scoring system to evaluate patients with COVID-19. Severe/critical patients had higher scores for ground glass opacity, consolidation, crazy-paving pattern, and overall lung involvement than moderate cases. The ground glass opacity score in the second week had an optimal predictive value for escalation of disease severity during hospitalization in moderate patients on admission. The frequency of CT scan should be reduced after entering the recovery stage.","Li, S; Liu, S Y; Zhao, Y Q; Li, Q Y; Liu, D Y; Liu, Z C; Li, D S; Zeng, L; Ge, Q G; Ma, Q B; Shen, N",Zhonghua Jie He He Hu Xi Za Zhi,,741

We aimed to describe the clinical characteristics of hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection in Shaoxing, and provide an insight into the treatment of COVID-19 across China and elsewhere. Methods: In this retrospective, single-center, study, we enrolled 16 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to the Affiliated Hospital of Shaoxing University between February 24 and January 25, 2020. Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological feature, and treatment data were all collected. Outcomes were followed up until March 16, 2020. Results: Among the 16 patients with COVID-19 infection, 11 patients (68.8%) had traveled or lived in Wuhan or surrounding areas, and 2 (12.5%) patients had exposure to patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection. The average age of the patients was 44.1 (16.5) years, and there were 10 women (62.5%) and 6 men (37.5%). More than half had chronic diseases [9 (56.3%)]. The most common symptoms at onset of COVID-19 infection were fever [12 (75%)] and cough [8 (50%)]; 11 (68.8%) patients had lymphopenia, and 12 (75%) had elevated C-reactive protein. On admission, abnormalities in computed tomography (CT) or chest X-ray images were revealed among all patients, and 11 (68.8%) of 16 patients had bilateral involvement. All patients were given psychological counseling, 15 (93.8%) patients were administered with antiviral therapy, 8 (50%) received empirical antibiotic treatment, and 5 (31.3%) patients were given systematic corticosteroids. Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring non-invasive mechanical ventilation [1 (6.3%)], acute respiratory injury [4 (25%)], acute renal injury [1 (6.3%)], septic shock [1 (6.3%)], liver dysfunction [5 (31.3%)], electrolyte disturbance [8 (50.0%)], and hospital-acquired pneumonia [3 (18.8%)]. None of the 16 patients died of COVID-19 pneumonia. Conclusions: Compared with the symptoms of the initial patients with COVID-19 infection in Wuhan, the symptoms of the patients from Shaoxing city were relatively mild. Currently, there is no effective drug treatment or vaccine for COVID-19, and psychological counseling cannot be ignored. Drugs and vaccines against COVID-19 infection need to be developed as soon as possible.","Hu, Wenbin; Chen, Xuefang; He, Binjun; Yuan, Shunda; Zhang, Xing; Wu, Guofeng; Liu, Jingjing; Xu, Liang; Cha, Wei; Xu, Mengmin; Sun, Xiaojun; Shen, Huajiang",Ann.

409979,Beyond Bricks and Mortar: The efficacy of online learning and community-building at College Park Academy during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"Gastrointestinal infections are an important global public health issue. In the UK, one in four people experience a gastrointestinal infection each year and epidemiological research highlights inequalities in the burden of disease. Specifically, poorer children are at greater risk of infection and the consequences of illness, such as symptom severity and time off work/school, are greater for less privileged groups of all ages. Gastrointestinal infections are, however, largely 'hidden' within the home and little is known about the lived experience and practices surrounding these illnesses, how they vary across contrasting socioeconomic contexts, or how inequalities in the disease burden across socioeconomic groups might come about. This paper presents data from an ethnographic study which illuminate how socioeconomic inequalities in the physical and material management and consequences of gastrointestinal infections are generated in families with young children. The study shows how the 'work' needed to manage gastrointestinal infections is more laborious for people living in more 'disadvantaged' conditions, exacerbated by: more overcrowded homes with fewer washing and toilet facilities; inflexible employment; low household incomes; and higher likelihood of co-morbidities which can be made worse by having a gastrointestinal infection. Our findings call into question the current approach to prevention of gastrointestinal infections which tend to focus almost exclusively on individual behaviours, which are not adapted to reflect differences in socioeconomic context. Public health agencies should also consider how wider social, economic and policy contexts shape inequalities in the management and consequences of illness. Our findings are also pertinent to the COVID-19 pandemic response in the UK. They highlight how research and policy approaches to acute infectious diseases need to take into consideration the differing lived experiences of contrasting households if they wish to address (and avoid exacerbating) inequalities in the future.","Rotheram, Suzanne; Cooper, Jessie; Barr, Ben; Whitehead, Margaret",Soc Sci Med,,741

425081,COVID-19 heralds a new epistemology of science for the public good,2021,"BACKGROUND: According to expert consensus, the time interval between Hymenoptera venom immunotherapy (VIT) injections can be extended up to 12 weeks, without significant impact on efficacy and safety. However, the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic caused longer delays, and no recommendations are available to manage this huge extension. OBJECTIVES: To provide advice on how to resume VIT safely after a long delay from the last injection considering the potential risk factors for side effects, without starting again with the induction phase. METHODS: All the patients who delayed VIT because of the pandemic were consecutively enrolled in this single-center study. The time extension was decided according to their risk profile (eg, long prepandemic time interval, severe pre-VIT reaction, older age, multitreatments), and correlation analyses were performed to find potential risk factors of side effects. RESULTS: The mean delay from the pre- (7 weeks) to the postpandemic VIT interval (15.5 weeks) was 8.5 weeks. The total amount of the prepandemic VIT maintenance dose was safely administered in 1 day in 78% of patients, whereas only 3, of 87, experienced side effects, and their potential risk factors were identified in bee venom allergy and recent VIT initiation. CONCLUSIONS: In a real-world setting, long VIT delays may be safe and well tolerated, but more caution should be paid in resuming VIT in patients with long prepandemic maintenance interval, severe pre-VIT reaction, recent VIT initiation, older age, multidrug treatments, and bee venom allergy. This is useful in any case of long, unplanned, and unavoidable VIT delay.","Bilò, M Beatrice; Braschi, M Chiara; Piga, Mario A; Antonicelli, Leonardo; Martini, Matteo",J. Allergy Clin. Immunol.

Objective: To determine whether a layperson-delivered, empathy-focused program of telephone calls could rapidly improve loneliness, depression, and anxiety in at-risk adults. Design, Setting, and Participants: From July 6 to September 24, 2020, we recruited and followed up 240 adults who were assigned to receive calls (intervention group) or no calls (control group) via block randomization. Loneliness, depression, and anxiety were measured using validated scales at enrollment and after 4 weeks. Intention-to-treat analyses were conducted. Meals on Wheels Central Texas (MOWCTX) clients received calls in their homes or wherever they might have been when the call was received. The study included MOWCTX clients who fit their service criteria, including being homebound and expressing a need for food. A total of 296 participants were screened, of whom 240 were randomized to intervention or control. Interventions: Sixteen callers, aged 17 to 23 years, were briefly trained in empathetic conversational techniques. Each called 6 to 9 participants over 4 weeks daily for the first 5 days, after which clients could choose to drop down to fewer calls but no less than 2 calls a week. Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcome was loneliness (3-item UCLA Loneliness Scale, range 3-9; and 6-item De Jong Giervald Loneliness [De Jong] Scale, range 0-6). Secondary outcomes were depression (Personal Health Questionnaire for Depression), anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale), and self-rated health (Short Form Health Survey Questionnaire). Results: The 240 participants were aged 27 to 101 years, with 63% aged at least 65 years (n = 149 of 232), 56% living alone (n = 135 of 240), 79% women (n = 190 of 240), 39% Black or African American (n = 94 of 240), and 22% Hispanic or Latino (n = 52 of 240), and all reported at least 1 chronic condition. Of 240 participants enrolled, 13 were lost to follow-up in the intervention arm and 1 in the control arm. Postassessment differences between intervention and control after 4 weeks showed an improvement of 1.1 on the UCLA Loneliness Scale (95% CI, 0.5-1.7; P < .001; Cohen d of 0.48), and improvement of 0.32 on De Jong (95% CI, -0.20 to 0.81; P = .06; Cohen d, 0.17) for loneliness; an improvement of 1.5 on the Personal Health Questionnaire for Depression (95% CI, 0.22-2.7; P < .001; Cohen d, 0.31) for depression; and an improvement of 1.8 on the Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (95% CI, 0.44 to 3.2; P < .001; Cohen d, 0.35) for anxiety. General physical health on the Short Form Health Questionnaire Survey showed no change, but mental health improved by 2.6 (95% CI, 0.81 to 4.4; P = .003; Cohen d of 0.46). Conclusions and Relevance: A layperson-delivered, empathy-oriented telephone call program reduced loneliness, depression, and anxiety compared with the control group and improved the general mental health of participants within 4 weeks.

RESULTS: We were able to detect viral RNA in the bronchioalveolar cell blocks (12/12, 100%) and formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue of the lung (8/8, 100%) and liver (4/9, 44%) of patients with COVID-19. Although the peak values of the main liver enzymes and bilirubin were higher in the patients with COVID-19 compared with the control group, the differences were not significant. The main histologic findings were minimal to focal mild portal tract chronic inflammation (7/8, 88%, P < .05) and mild focal lobular activity (6/8, 75%, P = .06). CONCLUSIONS: We found that most patients who died of COVID-19 had evidence of mild focal hepatitis clinically and histologically; however, the virus was detected in less than half of the cases.","Chornenkyy, Yevgen; Mejia-Bautista, Melissa; Brucal, Melanie; Blanke, Timothy; Dittmann, David; Yeldandi, Anjana; Boike, Justin R; Lomasney, Jon W; Nayar, Ritu; Jennings, Lawrence J; Pezhouh, Maryam Kherad",Am J Clin Pathol,,741

The depth of the crisis, as well as the difficulties of developing a common recovery program, put under question the EU ability to overcome this challenge. As long as the first wave of COVID-19 is over, the stage of urgent measures responding to unexpected threats is over, the long-term anti-crisis program is negotiated, it is possible and necessary to summarize the interim results of the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the European economy. The purpose of this article is not only to assess the impact of the first wave of the pandemic on the European economy and systematize the anti-crisis measures taken, but also to analyze the role of the coronacrisis in the further development of the EU through the prism of the main integration theories. The study revealed that the coronavirus crisis has not (yet) brought the European integration to its final. Faced to a huge threat to security and well-being, European leaders managed to negotiate a recovery plan. The disadvantages of the deal are the risk of erosion of the supranational governance and the threat of politicization due to belated decisions with limited potential. However, the majority of EU citizens still support further strengthening of the integration. To maintain this momentum, it is important to quickly finalize the mechanisms for implementing the recovery program in order to reduce public discontent and prevent the replacement of supranational governance by intergovernmental interaction.","Chupina, D.

Previous research has found that air pollution is potentially affected by these unprecedented changes and it affects COVID-19 infections. This study aims to explore the non-linear association between yearly and daily global air pollution and the confirmed cases of COVID-19. The concentrations of tropospheric air pollution (CO, NO2, O3, and SO2) and the daily confirmed cases between 23 January 2020 and 31 May 2020 were collected at the global scale. The yearly discrepancies of air pollutions and daily air pollution are associated with total and daily confirmed cases, respectively, based on the generalized additive model. We observed that there are significant spatially and temporally non-stationary variations between air pollution and confirmed cases of COVID-19. For the yearly assessment, the number of confirmed cases is associated with the positive fluctuation of CO, O3, and SO2 discrepancies, while the increasing NO2 discrepancies leads to the significant peak of confirmed cases variation. For the daily assessment, among the selected countries, positive linear or non-linear relationships are found between CO and SO2 concentrations and the daily confirmed cases, whereas NO2 concentrations are negatively correlated with the daily confirmed cases;variations in the ascending/declining associations are identified from the relationship of the O3-confirmed cases. The findings indicate that the non-linear relationships between global air pollution and the confirmed cases of COVID-19 are varied, which implicates the needs as well as the incorporation of our findings in the risk monitoring of public health on local, regional, and global scales.","Meng, Yuan Wong Man Sing Xing Hanfa Kwan Mei-Po Zhu Rui",ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information,,741

The poor and those without higher education also have higher pathogen burdens. The most frequent pathogen that was measured, was the Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1). This virus can inactivate most of the elements in the immune system, that are designed to protect against the incursions of viruses, bacteria and other pathogens. HSV-1 can also damage the blood brain barrier (BBB), which prevents the entry of pathogens into the central nervous system. Without the help of HSV-1, the COVID-19 virus may not be able to cause serious illness or death in humans.

Here we report an 11-year-old girl with anti-MDA5 JDM and RP-ILD which led to a fatal outcome, further aggravated by SARS-CoV-2 infection. She was referred to our hospital after being diagnosed with anti-MDA5 JDM and respiratory failure due to RP-ILD. On admission, fibrobronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) revealed Pneumocystis jirovecii infection so treatment with intravenous trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was initiated. Due to RP-ILD worsening, immunosuppressive therapy was intensified using methylprednisolone pulses, cyclophosphamide, tofacitinib and intravenous immunoglobulin without response. She developed severe hypoxemic respiratory failure, pneumomediastinum and pneumothorax, further complicated with severe RP-ILD and cervical subcutaneous emphysema. Three real-time RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 were made with a negative result. In addition, she was complicated with a secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and a fourth real-time PCR for SARS-CoV-2 performed in BAS sample was positive. Despite aggressive treatment of RP-ILD due to anti-MDA5 JDM, there was no improvement of respiratory failure in the following days and patient developed refractory septic shock and died. Anti-MDA5 JDM patients with RP-ILD have a poor prognosis with a high mortality rate. For this reason, intensive immunosuppressive therapy is essential including the use of promising drugs such as tofacitinib.

Although it is the most popular, this route also has absorption, and consequently, bioavailability limitations. In this sense, several pharmacotechnical strategies have been used to improve drug absorption, one of which is the use of permeation promoters. Papain is a very versatile plant enzyme that can be used as a permeation promoter of various active compounds. This study aimed to evaluate the safety of papain and the formulation of native papain minitablets to promote in vitro permeation of furosemide through an innovative biomimetic triple co-culture model of Caco-2, HT29-MTX, and Raji cells. Regarding permeation, furosemide and metaprolol concentrations are determined with HPLC; those are used to calculate Papp. Monolayer integrity was evaluated using TEER and Lucifer Yellow. In the presence of papain, TEER decreased two-fold and the Papp of furosemide increased six-fold. The results suggest that native papain minitablets can be used as therapeutic adjuvants to enhance the permeation of drugs significantly improving bioavailability.","Corazza, Fúlvio G; Ernesto, Julia V; Nambu, Felipe A N; Calixto, Leandro A; Varca, Gustavo H C; Vieira, Daniel P; Leite-Silva, Vânia R; Andréo-Filho, Newton; Lopes, Patricia S",AAPS PharmSciTech,,741

Multisymplectic variational integrators are a class of geometric numerical integrators for Lagrangian and Hamiltonian field theories, and they yield methods that preserve the multisymplectic structure and momentum-conservation properties of the continuous system. In this paper, we investigate the synthesis of these two approaches, by constructing discretization of the variational principle for Lagrangian field theories utilizing structure-preserving finite element projections. In our investigation, compatible discretization by cochain projections plays a pivotal role in the preservation of the variational structure at the discrete level, allowing the discrete variational structure to essentially be the restriction of the continuum variational structure to a finite-dimensional subspace. The preservation of the variational structure at the discrete level will allow us to construct a discrete Cartan form, which encodes the variational structure of the discrete theory, and subsequently, we utilize the discrete Cartan form to naturally state discrete analogues of Noether's theorem and multisymplecticity, which generalize those introduced in the discrete Lagrangian variational framework by Marsden et al. [29]. We will study both covariant spacetime discretization and canonical spatial semi-discretization, and subsequently relate the two in the case of spacetime tensor product finite element spaces.","Tran, Brian; Leok, Melvin",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.09338v1.pdf,741

Reported median age was 57 years (IQR: 39-65) and 62.95 years (IQR: 50.5-73.5) in case series and individual patients' cases in database, respectively. The time interval from the symptom onset to TTS diagnosis was median 6.5 days (IQR: 1.0-8.0) in case series and 6.7 days (IQR: 4-10) in individual patients' database. The median LVEF was 36% (IQR: 35-37) and 38.15%(IQR: 30-42.5%-[male: 40.33% (IQR: 33-44.2)] and female [37.15% (IQR: 30-40)] in case series and individual-patients' database, respectively. Troponin was elevated in all patients except one patient. 77.2% patients of TTS with COVID-19 had an elevated C-reactive protein and/or D-dimer. Twelve out of 22 (54.5%) patients developed cardiac complication such as cardiogenic-shock, atrial fibrillation, acute heart failure, supraventricular tachycardia, and biventricular heart failure. Nineteen out of 26 (73.07%) patients were discharged, and three were hospitalized due to acute respiratory distress syndrome and needed extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or ongoing maternal age. There were 4 (14.8%) mortality. There was no major gender difference observed in development of TTS in COVID-19 unlike COVID-19 per se. Older median age group for TTS in COVID-19 patients irrespective of cardiovascular comorbidities and gender probably reflects age as an independent risk factor. Patients who developed TTS had higher mortality rate especially if they developed cardiogenic shock.","Sharma, Kamal; Desai, Hardik D; Patoliya, Jaimini V; Jadeja, Dhigishaba M; Gadhiya, Dhruv",SN Compr Clin Med,,741

OBJECTIVE: To better understand the experiences of bereaved family members of patients who died in an ICU during the COVID-19 pandemic, from the time of hospital admission until after the patient’s death. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This qualitative study used semistructured, in-depth interviews to collect experiences from bereaved family members of patients who died from severe COVID-19 in 12 ICUs during the first wave of the pandemic in France. Purposeful sampling was used to ensure the diversity of study participants with respect to sex, age, relationship with the patient, and geographic location. All data were collected between June and September 2020, and data analysis was performed from August to November 2020. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Interviews were conducted 3 to 4 months after the patient’s death and were audio-recorded and analyzed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Among 19 family members interviewed (median [range] age, 46 [23-75] years; 14 [74%] women), 3 major themes emerged from qualitative analysis. The first was the difficulty in building a relationship with the ICU clinicians and dealing with the experience of solitude: family members experienced difficulties in establishing rapport and bonding with the ICU team as well as understanding the medical information. Distance communication was not sufficient, and participants felt it increased the feeling of solitude. The second involved the patient in the ICU and the risks of separation: because of restricted access to the ICU, family members experienced discontinuity and interruptions in the relationship with their loved one, which were associated with feelings of powerlessness, abandonment, and unreality. The third was regarding disruptions in end-of-life rituals: family members described “stolen moments” after the patient’s death, generating strong feelings of disbelief that may lead to complicated grief. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This qualitative study found that during the initial wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in France, bereaved family members described a disturbed experience, both during the ICU stay and after the patient’s death. Specific family-centered crisis guidelines are needed to improve experiences for patients, families, and clinicians experiences.","Kentish-Barnes, Nancy; Cohen-Solal, Zoé; Morin, Lucas; Souppart, Virginie; Pochard, Frédéric; Azoulay, Elie",JAMA Netw Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34152418/; https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.13355,741

Both showed neurological signs mainly characterized by progressive pelvic limb ataxia, paraplegia with loss of deep pain perception in the pelvic limb, and intentional tremors of the thoracic limbs. Pathological changes affecting the central and peripheral nervous systems were characterised by diffuse, bilateral and symmetrical myelin loss, and marked astrogliosis. In the leucodystrophic areas there was perivascular accumulation of large PAS-positive, non-metachromatic macrophages (globoid cells), with intracytoplasmic accumulation of crystalloid tubular aggregates. Peripheral nerves showed demyelinating features with thin myelin sheaths, myelin splitting, and ballooning; the nerve fibres had bizarre shapes due to the presence of pale inclusions in the Schwann cells. GLD in cats shares clinical and pathological features with the disease described in other animals and human beings. The neurological signs differed from those of other feline inborn neurometabolic diseases and cerebellar hypoplasia.","Salvadori, C.; Modenato, M.; Corlazzoli, D.

COVID-19 and Influenza are both respiratory viruses and, in this study, we explore the relations of COVID-19 and Influenza with atmospheric variables and socio-economic conditions for tropical and subtropical climates in Brazil. Atmospheric variables, mobility, socio-economic conditions and population information were analyzed using a generalized additive model for daily COVID-19 cases from March 1(st) to May 15(th), 2020, and for daily Influenza hospitalizations (2017-2019) in Brazilian states representing tropical and subtropical climates. Our results indicate that temperature combined with humidity are risk factors for COVID-19 and Influenza in both climate regimes, and the minimum temperature was also a risk factor for subtropical climate. Social distancing is a risk factor for COVID-19 in all regions. For Influenza and COVID-19, the highest relative risks (RR) generally occurred in 3 days (lag=3). Altogether among the studied regions, the most important risk factor is the Human Developed Index (HDI), with a mean RR of 1.2492 (95% CI: 1.0926-1.6706) for COVID-19, followed by the elderly fraction for both diseases. The risk factor associated with socio-economic inequalities for Influenza is probably smoothed by Influenza vaccination, which is offered free of charge to the entire Brazilian population.

In particular, under the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic context in China, it is of great significance to reduce the health risks to the public and environment. In this study, technologies of different types of hospital wastes and wastewater disinfection have been summarized. Liquid chlorine, sodium hypochlorite, chlorine dioxide, ozone, and ultraviolet irradiation disinfection are commonly used for hospital wastewater disinfection. While incineration, chemical disinfection, and physical disinfection are commonly used for hospital wastes disinfection. In addition, considering the characteristics of various hospital wastes, the classification and selection of corresponding disinfection technologies are discussed. On this basis, this study provides scientific suggestions for management, technology selection, and operation of hospital wastes and wastewater disinfection in China, which is of great significance for development of national disinfection strategy for hospital wastes and wastewater during COVID-19 pandemic.","Wang, Jiao; Shen, Jin; Ye, Dan; Yan, Xu; Zhang, Yujing; Yang, Wenjing; Li, Xinwu; Wang, Junqi; Zhang, Liubo; Pan, Lijun",Environmental Pollution,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32443202/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2020.114665; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0269749120310435; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0269749120310435,741

Since 1997, avian H5N1 influenza in Southeast Asia has caused several human infections and high mortality. Experts warn that the next influenza pandemic is imminent and could be severe. Prevention and control will depend on the rapid production and worldwide distribution of specific pandemic vaccines. If the vaccine supply is to be sufficient to meet global demand, issues related to the intellectual property rights for the reverse genetics technology essential for vaccine production must be resolved. In addition, candidate “pandemic-like” vaccines must be developed and tested in clinical trials to determine the most antigen sparing formulation and the best vaccination schedule. These studies must involve all vaccine companies and will require international coordination and public funding.

621055,Teaching highly mixed-ability CS1 classes: A proposed approach,2021-07-02,"Background: Infections represent highly dynamic processes, characterized by evolutionary changes and events that involve both the pathogen and the host. Among infectious agents, viruses, such as the ""Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-related Coronavirus type 2"" (SARS-CoV-2), the infectious agent responsible for the currently ongoing ""Coronavirus disease 2019"" (COVID-2019) pandemic, have a particularly high mutation rate. Taking into account the mutational landscape of an infectious agent, it is important to shed light on its evolution capability over time. As new, more infectious strains of COVID-19 emerge around the world, it is imperative to estimate when these new strains may overtake the wild-type strain in different populations. Therefore, we developed a general-purpose framework to estimate the time at which a mutant variant is able to takeover a wild-type strain during an emerging infectious diseases outbreak. In this study, we used COVID-19 as a case-study, but the model is adaptable to any emerging pathogens. Methods and findings: We devise a two-strain mathematical framework, to model a wild- and a mutant-type viral population and fit cumulative case data to parameterize the model, using Ontario as a case study. We found that, in the context of under-reporting and the current case levels, a variant strain is unlikely to dominate until March/April 2021. Current non-pharmaceutical interventions in Ontario need to be kept in place longer even with vaccination in order to prevent another outbreak. The spread of a variant strain in Ontario will mostly likely be observed by a widened peak of the daily reported cases. If vaccine efficacy is maintained across strains, then it is still possible to have an immune population by end of 2021. Conclusions: Our findings have important practical implications in terms of public health as policy-and decision-makers are equipped with a mathematical tool that can enable the estimation of the take-over of a mutant strain of an emerging infectious disease.","Betti, M.; Bragazzi, N.; Heffernan, J.

We now have extended our in vivo studies of STI-2020 to include disease treatment efficacy, profiling of biodistribution of STI-2020 in mice when antibody is delivered intranasally (IN) or intravenously (IV), as well as pharmacokinetics in mice following IN antibody administration. Importantly, SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters were treated with STI-2020 using these routes, and treatment effects on severity and duration of COVID-19-like disease in this model were evaluated. In SARS-CoV-2 infected hamsters, treatment with STI-2020 12 hours post-infection using the IN route led to a decrease in severity of clinical disease signs and a more robust recovery during 9 days of infection as compared to animals treated with an isotype control antibody. Treatment via the IV route using the same dose and timing regimen resulted in a decrease in the average number of consecutive days that infected animals experienced weight loss, shortening the duration of disease and allowing recovery to begin more rapidly in STI-2020 treated animals. Following IN administration in mice, STI-2020 was detected within 10 minutes in both lung tissue and lung lavage. The half-life of STI-2020 in lung tissue is approximately 25 hours.

Comparative evidence on the use of AirSeal® and standard CO(2) insufflator in laparoscopic general surgery procedures is scarce. The aim of this study was to compare surgical outcomes between AirSeal® and standard CO(2) insufflators in patients undergoing the most frequently performed laparoscopic procedures. METHODS: One hundred and ninety-eight patients undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy, colorectal surgery and hernia repair were randomized to either AirSeal® (group A) or standard pressure CO(2) insufflator (group S). The primary endpoints were operative time and level of postoperative shoulder tip pain (Visual Analog Scale). Secondary outcomes included Clavien–Dindo grade complications, surgical side effect and length of hospital stay. RESULTS: Patients were randomized to either group A (n = 101) or group S (n = 97) and were analyzed by intention-to-treat. There was no significant difference in mean operative time between the groups (median [IQR]; 71 min [56–94] in group A vs. 69 min [52–93] in group S; p = 0.434). Shoulder tip pain levels were significantly lower in group S (VAS 0 [0–3] in group S vs. 2 [0–4] in group A; p = 0.001). There was no significant difference in complications, surgical side effects (subcutaneous emphysema was not observed in any group) and length of hospital stay.

Hospitals in developed countries offering specialist reconstructive or tertiary services are not infrequently asked to accept civilian patients from overseas conflict for complex surgical procedures or rehabilitation. Concern about the infection prevention and control risks posed by these patients, and the lack of a good evidence base on which to base measured precautions, means that the precautionary principle of accepting zero risk is usually followed. The aim of this article is to highlight infection control considerations that may be required when treating casualties from overseas conflict, based partly on our own experience. Currently there is a lack of published evidence and national consensus on how to manage these patients. The precautionary principle requires that there is an ongoing search for evidence and knowledge that can be used to move towards more traditional risk management.

644475,Developing student connectedness under remote learning using digital resources: A systematic review,2021-06-28,"It is critical to remember details about meetings with healthcare providers. Forgetting could result in inadequate knowledge about ones' health, non-adherence with treatments, and poorer health outcomes. Hearing the health care provider plays a crucial role in consolidating information for recall. The recent COVID-19 pandemic has meant a rapid transition to videoconference-based medicine, here described as telehealth. When using telehealth speech must be filtered and compressed, and research has shown that degraded speech is more challenging to remember. Here we present preliminary results from a study that compared memory for health information provided in-person to telehealth. The data collection for this study was stopped due to the pandemic, but the preliminary results are interesting because the pandemic forced a rapid transition to telehealth. To examine a potential memory deficit for health information provided through telehealth, we presented older and younger adults with instructions on how to use two medical devices. One set of instructions was presented in-person, and the other through telehealth. Participants were asked to recall the instructions immediately after the session, and again after a 1-week delay. Overall, the number of details recalled was significantly lower when instructions were provided by telehealth, both immediately after the session and after a 1-week delay. It is likely that a mix of technological and communication strategies by the healthcare provider could reduce this telehealth memory deficit. Given the rapid transition to telehealth due to COVID-19, highlighting this deficit and providing potential solutions are timely and of utmost importance.","Zendel, Benjamin Rich; Power, Bethany Victoria; DiDonato, Roberta Maria; Hutchings, Veronica Margaret Moore",Front Psychol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.604074; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33841239/,741

On day 23 postadmission, he developed a second COVID-19 episode, now severe, and finally died. Initially, case R’s COVID-19 recurrence was interpreted as a reinfection due to the exposure to a SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR–positive roommate. However, whole-genome sequencing indicated that case R’s recurrence corresponded to a reactivation of the strain involved in his first episode. Case R’s reactivation had major consequences, leading to a more severe episode, and causing subsequent transmission to another 2 hospitalized patients, 1 of them with fatal outcome.","Pérez-Lago, Laura; Martínez-Lozano, Helena; Pajares Díaz, Jose Antonio; Díaz Gómez, Arantxa; Machado, Marina; Sola-Campoy, Pedro J; Herranz, Marta; Buenestado-Serrano, Sergio; Valerio, Maricela; Olmedo, María; Andrés Zayas, Cristina; Comas, Iñaki; González Candelas, Fernando; Bañares, Rafael; Catalán, Pilar; Muñoz, Patricia; García de Viedma, Darío",J Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jiab302; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34107025/,741
659735,Finding satisfaction: intrinsic motivation for synchronous and asynchronous communication in the online language learning context,2020-11-05,"In March 2020 schools in Austria temporarily closed and switched to distance learning to contain the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19). The resulting situation posed great challenges to teachers, guardians and students (Huber and Helm 2020). Research has shown that perceived competence (Deci and Ryan 2000) affects selfregulated learning (SRL), intrinsic motivation and procrastination, however few studies have considered these variables in context of distance learning among adolescents. This study investigated differences in students who perceived themselves as high vs. low in competence with respect to these constructs. In an online questionnaire, 2652 Austrian secondary school students answered closed questions regarding SRL, intrinsic motivation and procrastination as well as open-ended questions about challenges, successes and need for support in distance. Structural equation modeling was applied for the quantitative analysis which was complemented by thematic analysis for the qualitative questions (Braun and Clarke 2006). Results showed that students who experienced themselves as highly competent use SRL strategies (goal setting and planning, time management, metacognitive strategies) more often and are more intrinsically motivated than students with lower perceived competence. They also procrastinate less. Furthermore, qualitative analysis revealed that although all students face similar challenges (e.g., independent learning, time and task management, learning on the computer, lack of contact with teachers and peers), students who perceived themselves as highly competent seemed to cope better, and have less need for support. Implications for distance learning and future research are discussed.

Hypoxemic patients are advised to use oxygen therapy to prolong their survival, but high oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) levels can also have negative effects. Pulse oximeters are the most common way to assess oxygen levels and guide medical treatment. This study aims to assess whether wearable devices can provide precise SpO(2) measurements when compared to commercial pulse oximeters. This is a cross-section study with 100 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and interstitial lung disease from an outpatient pneumology clinic. SpO(2) and heart rate data were collected with an Apple Watch Series 6 (Apple) and compared to two commercial pulse oximeters. The Bland–Altman method and interclass correlation coefficient were used to compare their values. We observed strong positive correlations between the Apple Watch device and commercial oximeters when evaluating heart rate measurements (r = 0.995, p < 0.001) and oximetry measurements (r = 0.81, p < 0.001). There was no statistical difference in the evaluation of skin color, wrist circumference, presence of wrist hair, and enamel nail for SpO(2) and heart rate measurements in Apple Watch or commercial oximeter devices (p > 0.05). Apple Watch 6 is a reliable way to obtain heart rate and SpO(2) in patients with lung diseases in a controlled environment.","Pipek, Leonardo Zumerkorn; Nascimento, Rafaela Farias Vidigal; Acencio, Milena Marques Pagliarelli; Teixeira, Lisete Ribeiro",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-98453-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34556765/,741

The emergence of novel coronavirus disease, also known as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has presented an unprecedented global challenge for the healthcare community. The ability of SARS-CoV-2 to get transmitted during the asymptomatic phase and its high infectivity have led to the rapid transmission of COVID-19 beyond geographic regions, leading to a pandemic. There is concern that COVID-19 is cardiotropic, and it interacts with the cardiovascular system on multiple levels. Individuals with established CVD are more susceptible to severe COVID-19. Through a consensus approach involving an international group this WHF statement summarizes the links between cardiovascular disease and COVID-19 and present some practical recommendations for the management of hypertension and diabetes, acute coronary syndrome, heart failure, rheumatic heart disease, Chagas disease, and myocardial injury for patients with COVID-19 in low-resource settings. This document is not a clinical guideline and it is not intended to replace national clinical guidelines or recommendations. Given the rapidly growing burden posed by COVID-19 illness and the associated severe prognostic implication of CVD involvement, further research is required to understand the potential mechanisms linking COVID-19 and CVD, clinical presentation, and outcomes of various cardiovascular manifestations in COVID-19 patients.","Prabhakaran, Dorairaj; Perel, Pablo; Roy, Ambuj; Singh, Kavita; Raspail, Lana; Faria-Neto, José Rocha; Gidding, Samuel S.; Ojji, Dike; Hakim, Ferdous; Newby, L.

664713,COVID-19 and the problem of clinical knowledge,2021-04-01,"BACKGROUND: Insects are a living resource used for human nutrition, medicine, and industry. Several potential sources of proteins, peptides, and biopolymers, such as silk, chitin, and chitosan are utilized in industry and for biotechnology applications. Chitosan is an amino-polysaccharide derivative of chitin that consists of linear amino polysaccharides with d-glucosamine and N-acetyl-d-glucosamine units. Currently, the chief commercial sources of chitin and chitosan are crustacean shells that accumulate as a major waste product from the marine food industry. Existing chitin resources have some natural challenges, including insufficient supplies, seasonal availability, and environmental pollution. As an alternative, insects could be utilized as unconventional but feasible sources of chitin and chitosan. SCOPE AND APPROACH: This review focuses on the recent sources of insect chitin and chitosan, particularly from the Lepidoptera, Coleoptera, Orthoptera, Hymenoptera, Diptera, Hemiptera, Dictyoptera, and Odonata orders. In addition, the extraction methods and physicochemical characteristics are discussed. Insect chitin and chitosan have numerous biological activities and could be used for food, biomedical, and industrial applications. KEY FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS: Recently, the invasive and harmful effects of insect species causing severe damage in agricultural crops has led to great economic losses globally. These dangerous species serve as potential sources of chitin and are underutilized worldwide. The conclusion of the present study provides better insight into the conversion of insect waste-derived chitin into value-added products as an alternative chitin source to address food security related challenges.","Mohan, Kannan; Ganesan, Abirami Ramu; Muralisankar, Thirunavukkarasu; Jayakumar, Rajarajeswaran; Sathishkumar, Palanivel; Uthayakumar, Venkatachalam; Chandirasekar, Ramachandran; Revathi, Nagarajan",Trends Food Sci Technol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tifs.2020.08.016; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092422442030580X?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32901176/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S092422442030580X,741
664786,Underlying the triple burden effects on women educationists due to COVID-19,2021-07-16,"The outbreak of pneumonia caused by a new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) occurred in December 2019, and spread rapidly throughout the world. There have been other severe coronavirus outbreaks worldwide, namely, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV). Because the genetic diversity of coronaviruses renders the design of vaccines complicated, broad spectrum-anti-coronavirus drugs have become a critical approach to control the coronavirus epidemic. Cyclophilin A is an important protein needed for coronavirus replication, and its inhibitor cyclosporine has the ability to suppress coronavirus on a broad spectrum. CD147-S protein was found to be one route by which SARS-CoV-2 invades host cells, while CD147 was found to play a functional role in facilitating the infection of host cells by SARS-CoV. The CyPA/CD147 interaction may play a critical role in the ability of the SARS-CoV-2 virus to enter the host cells. However, cyclosporine A has immunosuppressive effects, so the conditions for its use as an antiviral drug are limited. As a result, cyclosporine A analogues without immunosuppressive side effects have attracted lots of interest. This review primarily discusses the drug development prospects of cyclophilin A as a therapeutic target for the treatment of coronavirus infection, especially coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and non-immunosuppressive cyclosporine analogues.","Liu, Chenglong; Zhu, Di",Med Drug Discov,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590098620300439?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2590098620300439; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.medidd.2020.100056; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32835213/,741

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two experienced radiologists reviewed chest radiographs of 28 patients with SARS. Each lung was divided into upper, middle, and lower zones. A SARS-related lesion in each zone was scored using a four-point scale: zero to three. The mean and maximal radiographic scores were analyzed statistically to determine if the scorings were related to the laboratory data and clinical course. RESULTS: Forward stepwise multiple linear regression showed that the mean radiographic score correlated most significantly with the number of hospitalized days (p < 0.001). The second most significant factor was the absolute lymphocyte count (p < 0.001) and the third most significant factor was the number of days of intubation (p = 0.025). The maximal radiographic score correlated best with the percentage of lymphocytes in a leukocyte count (p < 0.001), while the second most significant factor was the number of hospitalized days (p < 0.001) and the third most significant factor was the absolute lymphocyte count (p = 0.013). The mean radiographic scores of the patients who died, with comorbidities and without a comorbidity were 11.1, 6.3 and 2.9, respectively (p = 0.032). The corresponding value for maximal radiographic scores were 17.7, 9.7 and 6.0, respectively (p = 0.033).

Methods: After an extensive literature review and panel discussion to prove the face validity and content validity, the initial item pool was reduced to 52 items. In a pilot study, a sample of four hundred and twenty-four healthcare students participated, and exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) were used. Psychometric properties—construct validity, convergent validity, discriminant validity, goodness of fit, and reliabilities—were also analyzed. Results: After the use of EFA, the 52 items were reduced to 31 items in four factors, with 66.70% of the total variance explained. The Cronbach’s alpha values ranged between 0.91 and 0.93. The study also used CFA to validate the EFA model, and the results demonstrated that with the same thirty-one items in a 7-point Likert scale, the model was a better fit in four factors: “inexperience in professional knowledge and skills” (nine items; factor loadings: 0.642–0.867; 43.72% of the variance explained), “fear of death” (eight items; factor loadings: 0.745–0.831; 9.94% of the variance explained), “fear of being infected” (eight items; factor loadings: 0.678–0.866; 7.86% of the variance explained), and “interpersonal interactions” (six items; factor loadings: 0.704–0.913; 5.18% of the variance explained). The CFA model demonstrated a good model fit in the χ(2)/df ratio (1.17; p = 0.016), CFI (0.99), TFI (0.99), and RMSEA (0.02). The composite reliabilities ranged from 0.89 to 0.92, confirming the StWTA-HS scale’s stability and internal consistency. The convergent validity and discriminant validity were also confirmed.
