METHODS Five academic databases were searched supplemented by a hand search of key journals and references of included studies. Two authors independently screened studies via a reference manager (Covidence) which allowed for blinding. A third author was consulted in cases of conflict. RESULTS Thirty articles that provided empirical evidence of inclusive education implementation were included. Eight articles highlighted practices that support inclusion of children with intellectual and developmental disabilities. Using Bronfenbrenner's bioecological framework, findings revealed that inclusive education implementation is influenced by factors on the bio level, micro level, meso level, and macro level. Recommendations for promoting inclusive education implementation are provided. CONCLUSIONS Inclusion goes beyond teachers and requires strong commitment of other stakeholders such as families and governments. To guarantee the smooth inclusion of children with special education needs and particularly with intellectual and developmental disabilities, a set of practices validated through rigorous research as supportive and unique and that can be universal to Africa is wise. Implications for rehabilitation A number of strategies were identified that can improve the classroom inclusion of children with intellectual and developmental disabilities. Development of policies that support such strategies could improve implementation. Inclusion goes beyond teachers. Rehabilitation professionals (i.e. occupational therapists) and educational professionals should partner to identify practical solutions to the challenges of creating inclusive environments for children with special education needs. Committing more resources and time towards the development and implementation of special education policies can advance the successful inclusion of children with special education needs.","Okyere, Christiana; Aldersey, Heather Michelle; Lysaght, Rosemary; Sulaiman, Surajo Kamilu",Disability and rehabilitation,864,30

METHODS 54 individuals with psychosis and 103 individuals without psychosis (but experiencing other severe and acute mental health issues) were compared, and analyses of indirect effects were conducted to test specificity of thwarted belongingness, perceived burdensomeness, capability for suicide, agitation, and insomnia as accounting for group differences in suicidal ideation. RESULTS Patients without psychosis experienced higher levels of suicidal ideation, perceived burdensomeness, thwarted belongingness, agitation, and insomnia than patients with psychosis. Additionally, perceived burdensomeness and agitation emerged as robust explanatory factors for the relationship between psychosis status and suicidal ideation. LIMITATIONS Future work should include longitudinal analyses to understand temporal relationships between study variables. Additionally, stability of patients' psychotic symptoms was required and therefore may not reflect those at greatest acuity. CONCLUSIONS Although several studies have investigated suicide-related variables among those with psychosis as compared to the general population, the present study is novel in that the severity of these symptoms in those with psychosis is compared to that of those in other acutely ill populations (e.g., major depression, substance use).","Lieberman, Amy; Rogers, Megan L; Graham, Adam; Joiner, Thomas E",Journal of affective disorders,864,27

METHODS Seven databases were systematically searched for relevant literature. We included both quantitative and qualitative studies of psychological interventions designed to improve the adjustment of SCCs. RESULTS Our database searches yielded 19 publications. We found a range of psychosocial interventions being used among SCCs, with group interventions being the most common. The primary outcomes focused on the SCCs' depression, anxiety, and quality of life. Quantitative studies provided insufficient evidence to draw definitive conclusions about the interventions' effects, whereas the qualitative studies indicated that SCCs can derive benefits from these interventions, including an enhanced sense of belonging and bonding, improved family relationships, increased self-awareness and confidence, increased cancer knowledge, and decreased somatic symptoms. CONCLUSIONS Although a growing number of psychosocial interventions have been developed to improve the adjustment of SCCs, research evidence of the effects of these interventions on SCCs' adjustment remains limited. Future research needs to rigorously evaluate the effects of these interventions.","Guan, Ting; Chapman, Mimi V; Qan'ir, Yousef; Song, Lixin",Psycho-oncology,864,1

Viewing health care and public health policy through the lens of comparative federalism highlights some serious structural flaws in EU health policy. The regulatory state form in which the EU has evolved makes it difficult for the EU to formulate a health policy that actually focuses on health. Of the three faces of EU health policy, which are health policy, internal market policy and fiscal governance, health policy is legally, politically and financially the weakest. A comparison of the EU to other federations suggests that this creates basic weaknesses in the EU's design: its key powers are regulatory and its redistribution minimal. No federal welfare state so clearly pools risks at a low level while making markets so forcefully or creating rights whose costs are born by other levels of government. This structure, understandable in light of the EU's history and development, limits its health and social policy initiatives and might not be stable over the long term.","Greer, Scott L","Health economics, policy, and law",864,7

However, radial access failure is not uncommon, leading to crossover to a different access site. The CHA2DS2-VASc score is used to estimate stroke risk in patients with atrial fibrillation. Our study aimed to assess the CHA2DS2-VASc score in predicting failure of the transradial approach, resulting in crossover to transfemoral access (TFA) for coronary angiography. METHODS: We performed a single-center, non-randomized, retrospective study. The study included 1775 patients who underwent coronary angiography with or without subsequent percutaneous intervention between July 2018 and October 2019. The study population was divided into three groups based on the CHA2DS2-VASc score: low (&#8804;2), intermediate (3-4), and high score (&#8805;5) groups. The association between the CHA2DS2-VASc score and radial access failure was evaluated and compared between the groups. RESULTS: A total of 197 patients (11.1%) had crossover to the femoral artery. A large percentage of patients (19.2%) had radial access failure in the high CHA2DS2-VASc score group (&#8805;5) compared with 12.5% in the intermediate score group (3-4) and only 6.3% in the low score group (&#8804;2). The highest crossover rate (42.9%) was observed in patients with a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 8. Higher CHA2DS2-VASc scores were also associated with increased fluoroscopy time, contrast administration, and radiation exposure. CONCLUSION: The CHA2DS2-VASc score can predict failure of the transradial approach, with a score of &#8805;5 having the highest correlation of failure requiring crossover to TFA.","Tahir, Hassan; Livesay, James; Fogelson, Benjamin; Coombes, Tyler; Patel, Chirag; Baljepally, Raj",Cardiovasc. revasc. med,864,20

Methods: First, the main chemical components of Compound Houttuynia mixture were obtained by using the TCMSP database and referring to relevant chemical composition literature. The components were screened for OB ≥30% and DL ≥0.18 as the threshold values. Then Swiss Target Prediction database was used to predict the target of the active components and map the targets of COVID-19 obtained through GeneCards database to obtain the gene pool of the potential target of COVID-19 resistance of the active components of Compound Houttuynia mixture. Next, DAVID database was used for GO enrichment and KEGG pathway annotation of targets function. Cytoscape 3.8.0 software was used to construct a “components-targets-pathways” network. Then String database was used to construct a “protein-protein interaction” network. Finally, the core targets, SARS-COV-2 3 Cl, ACE2 and the core active components of Compound Houttuyna Mixture were imported into the Discovery Studio 2016 Client database for molecular docking verification. Results: Eighty-two active compounds, including Xylostosidine, Arctiin, ZINC12153652 and ZINC338038, were screened from Compound Houttuyniae mixture. The key targets involved 128 targets, including MAPK1, MAPK3, MAPK8, MAPK14, TP53, TNF, and IL6. The HIF-1 signaling, VEGF signaling, TNF signaling and another 127 signaling pathways associated with COVID-19 were affected (P &lt; 0.05). From the results of molecular docking, the binding ability between the selected active components and the core targets was strong. Conclusion: Through the combination of network pharmacology and molecular docking technology, this study revealed that the therapeutic effect of Compound Houttuynia mixture on COVID-19 was realized through multiple components, multiple targets and multiple pathways, which provided a certain scientific basis of the clinical application of Compound Houttuynia mixture. © The Author(s) 2021.","Wu, X.

Since papillary carcinoma was the preoperative diagnosis in all cases, radioactive iodine ablation (RIA) therapy was also planned 3-4 weeks following surgery after withdrawing thyroxine and achieving a thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level > 30 mU/L. Thyroxine withdrawal is the routine method applied for RIA in Jordan as it is less costly compared to the rapid method of exogenous stimulation using recombinant TSH. All surgical procedures were performed without delay since all patients were asymptomatic per flu-like illness and came from a region of low COVID-19 prevalence. These included total thyroidectomy (n = 11), bilateral therapeutic central compartment neck dissection (n = 7), lateral compartment neck dissection (n = 5).

To examine the current status of non-pharmaceutical preventive behaviors practiced during the COVID-19 outbreak and factors affecting behavioral activities, we compared to the 2015 Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) outbreak in Korea. METHODS: This was a serial cross-sectional population-based study in Korea with four surveys conducted on June 2 and 25, 2015 (MERS-CoV surveys), and February 4, and April 2, 2020 (COVID-19 surveys). Of 25,711 participants selected using random digit dialing numbers, 4,011 participants (aged &#8805; 18 years) were successfully interviewed, for the 2020 COVID-19 (n = 2,002) and 2015 MERS-CoV (n = 2,009) epidemics were included. Participants were selected post-stratification by sex, age, and province. The total number of weighted cases in this survey equaled the total number of unweighted cases at the national level. We measured the levels of preventive behaviors (social distancing [avoiding physical contact with others]), and practicing transmission-reducing behaviors such as wearing face mask and handwashing. RESULTS: Between the surveys, respondents who reported practicing social distancing increased from 41.9%-58.2% (MERS-CoV) to 83.4%-92.3% (COVID-19). The response rate for the four surveys ranged between 13.7% and 17.7%. Practicing transmission-reducing behaviors (wearing face masks and handwashing) at least once during COVID-19 (78.8%, 80.2%) also increased compared to that during MERS-CoV (15.5%, 60.3%). The higher affective risk perception groups were more likely to practice transmission-reducing measures (adjusted odds ratio, 3.24-4.81; 95 confidence interval, 1.76-6.96) during both COVID-19 and MERS-CoV. CONCLUSION: The study findings suggest markedly increased proportions of non-pharmaceutical behavioral practices evenly across all subgroups during the two different novel virus outbreaks in Korea. Strategic interventions are needed to attempt based on preventive behavior works.","Jang, Won Mo; Jang, Deok Hyun; Lee, Jin Yong",J Korean Med Sci,864,1

The present paper reports data obtained from a survey relating to the Italian mental health system conducted during the first phase of the Covid-19 epidemic. METHODS: Two online questionnaires regarding Community Mental Health Centres (CMHC) and General Hospital Psychiatric Wards (GHPW), respectively, were sent to the Heads of all Italian Mental Health Departments (MHDs). Statistical analysis was carried out by means of Chi Square test with Yates correction or the Fisher Exact test, as needed. RESULTS: Seventy-one (52.9%) of the 134 MHDs and 107 (32.6%) of the 318 GHPWs returned completed questionnaires. Less than 20% of CMHCs were closed and approx. 25% had introduced restricted access hours. A substantial change in the standard mode of operation in CMHCs was reported with only urgent psychiatric interventions, compulsory treatments and consultations for imprisoned people continuing unchanged. All other activities had been reduced to some extent. Remote contacts with users had been set up in about 75% of cases. Cases of COVID positivity were reported for both staff members (approx. 50% of CHMCs) and service users (52% of CHMCs). 20% of CMHCs reported cases of increased aggressiveness or violence among community patients, although only 8.6% relating to severe cases. Significant problems emerged with regard to the availability of personal protective equipment (PPE) for staff members. A reduced number of GHPWs (- 12%), beds (approx.-30%) and admissions were registered (87% of GHPWs). An increase in compulsory admissions and the rate of violence towards self or others among inpatients was reported by 8% of GHPWs. Patient swabs were carried out in 50% of GHPWs. 60% of GHPWs registered the admission to general COVID-19 Units of symptomatic COVID+ non-severe psychiatric patients whilst COVID+ severe psychiatric patients who were non-collaborative were admitted to specifically set up ""COVID-19"" GHPWs or to isolated areas of the wards purposely adapted for the scope. CONCLUSIONS: The pandemic has led to a drastic reduction in levels of care, which may produce a severe impact on the mental health of the population in relation to the consequences of the expected economic crisis and of the second ongoing wave of the pandemic.","Carpiniello, Bernardo; Tusconi, Massimo; Zanalda, Enrico; Di Sciascio, Guido; Di Giannantonio, Massimo",BMC Psychiatry,864,16

There is an urgent need to identify medications that would treat and prevent novel diseases like the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Drug repurposing is a promising strategy to discover new medical indications of the existing approved drugs due to several advantages in terms of the costs, safety factors, and quick results compared to new drug design and discovery. In this work, we explore computational data-driven methods for drug repurposing and propose a dedicated graph neural network (GNN) based drug repurposing model, called Dr-COVID. Although we analyze the predicted drugs in detail for COVID-19, the model is generic and can be used for any novel diseases. We construct a four-layered heterogeneous graph to model the complex interactions between drugs, diseases, genes, and anatomies. We pose drug repurposing as a link prediction problem. Specifically, we design an encoder based on the scalable inceptive graph neural network (SIGN) to generate embeddings for all the nodes in the four-layered graph and propose a quadratic norm scorer as a decoder to predict treatment for a disease. We provide a detailed analysis of the 150 potential drugs (such as Dexamethasone, Ivermectin) predicted by Dr-COVID for COVID-19 from different pharmacological classes (e.g., corticosteroids, antivirals, antiparasitic). Out of these 150 drugs, 46 drugs are currently in clinical trials. Dr-COVID is evaluated in terms of its prediction performance and its ability to rank the known treatment drugs for diseases as high as possible. For a majority of the diseases, Dr-COVID ranks the actual treatment drug in the top 15.","Doshi, Siddhant; Chepuri, Sundeep Prabhakar",,864,11

Micro-droplets can easily pass through ordinary respiratory masks. Therefore, the SARS-COV-2 transmit easily in conversation with a regular mask with 'silent spreaders' in the most physiological way of breathing through the nose, indoor and at rest condition. The results showed that the amount of deposited micro-droplets in the olfactory epithelium area is low. Also, due to receptors and long droplet residence time in this region, the possibility of absorption increases in the cribriform plate. This phenomenon eventually could lead to brain lesion damage and, in some cases, leads to stroke. In all inlet flow rates lower than 30 L/min inlet boundary conditions, the average percentage of viral contamination for upper respiratory tract is always less than 50% and more than 50% for the lungs. At 6L/min and 15L/min flow rates, the average percentage of lung contamination increases to more than 87%, which due to the presence of the Coronavirus receptor in the lungs, the involvement of the lungs increases significantly. This study's other achievements include the inverse relationship between droplets deposition efficiency in some parts of the upper airway, which have the most deformation in the tract. Also, the increased deformities per minute applied to the trachea and nasal cavity, which is 1.5 times more than usual, could lead to chest and head bothers.","Mortazavy Beni, Hamidreza; Mortazavi, Hamed; Aghaei, Fatemeh; Kamalipour, Sanam",,864,14

Cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes and chronic lung disease have been identified as the main COVID-19 comorbidities. Moreover, despite similar infection rates between men and women, the most severe course of the disease is higher in elderly and co-morbid male patients. Therefore, the occurrence of specific comorbidities associated with renin-angiotensin system (RAS) imbalance mediated by the interaction between angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and desintegrin and metalloproteinase domain 17 (ADAM17), along with specific genetic factors mainly associated with type II transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS2) expression, could be decisive for the clinical outcome of COVID-19. Indeed, the exacerbated ADAM17-mediated ACE2, TNF-&#945;, and IL-6R secretion emerges as a possible underlying mechanism for the acute inflammatory immune response and the activation of the coagulation cascade. Therefore, in this review, we focus on the main pathophysiological aspects of ACE2, ADAM17, and TMPRSS2 host proteins in COVID-19. Additionally, we discuss a possible mechanism to explain the deleterious effect of ADAM17 and TMPRSS2 over-activation in the COVID-19 outcome.","Zipeto, Donato; Palmeira, Julys da Fonseca; Argañaraz, Gustavo A; Argañaraz, Enrique R",Front Immunol,864,1

Patients were overall very supportive (4.67) and found the quality of the visits to be as good as, or better, than their prior in person weekly OTV (3.75). Physicians participating in the vOTVs felt very comfortable in their ability to manage patients though this platform (5.0), and on average did not report any difference in terms of efficiency of visits (3.0). Conclusions: Virtual OTVs were easy to implement and well received by patients and participating physicians. Our experience suggests that vOTVs can be implemented rapidly using available technology, and with a high degree of patient and physician satisfaction during this pandemic with similar efficiency to in person OTVs.","Roof, Kevin S; Butler, Jerome M; Thakkar, Vipul V; Doline, Robert M; Kuremsky, Jeffrey G; Konefal, John B; McCammon, Robert J",,864,26

METHODS: Data was collected for consecutive patients with ITM receiving lesional therapies from 2008 to 2018 in a retrospective review. Included patients did not have metastatic disease at time of starting on lesional therapy and were not on systemic therapy. The primary outcome was complete pathologic response (pCR). RESULTS: Of 83 patients, 57 (69%) started treatment with IL-2, 10 (12%) with DPCP, 12 (14%) with CLT, and 4 (5%) with imiquimod. pCR was achieved in 34 patients (41%) overall, including 44% starting on IL-2, 20% on DPCP, 58% on CLT, and none on imiquimod (P = .024). With a median follow-up of 45 months, cumulative one-year overall survival was 86%, with the best survival in the CLT group. Forty-eight percent experienced common terminology criteria for adverse events grade 1 or 2 toxicity. A quarter of patients on DPCP discontinued therapy due to toxicity (P = .002).

Despite its benefits in suppressing the spread of the virus, publicizing contact trace data raises concerns about individuals' privacy. In view of this tug-of-war between one's privacy and public safety, this work aims to deepen the understanding of privacy risks of contact trace data disclosure practices in South Korea. Method: In this study, publicly available contact trace data of 970 confirmed patients were collected from seven metropolitan cities in South Korea (20th Jan–20th Apr 2020). Then, an ordinal scale of relative privacy risk levels was introduced for evaluation, and the assessment was performed on the personal information included in the contact trace data, such as demographics, significant places, sensitive information, social relationships, and routine behaviors. In addition, variance of privacy risk levels was examined across regions and over time to check for differences in policy implementation. Results: It was found that most of the contact trace data showed the gender and age of the patients. In addition, it disclosed significant places (home/work) ranging across different levels of privacy risks in over 70% of the cases. Inference on sensitive information (hobby, religion) was made possible, and 48.7% of the cases exposed the patient's social relationships. In terms of regional differences, a considerable discrepancy was found in the privacy risk for each category. Despite the recent release of government guidelines on data disclosure, its effects were still limited to a few factors (e.g., workplaces, routine behaviors). Discussion: Privacy risk assessment showed evidence of superfluous information disclosure in the current practice. This study discusses the role of “identifiability” in contact tracing to provide new directions for minimizing disclosure of privacy infringing information. Analysis of real-world data can offer potential stakeholders, such as researchers, service developers, and government officials with practical protocols/guidelines in publicizing information of patients and design implications for future systems (e.g., automatic privacy sensitivity checking) to strike a balance between one's privacy and the public benefits with data disclosure.","Jung, Gyuwon; Lee, Hyunsoo; Kim, Auk; Lee, Uichin",Front.

Strong, Th1-skewed T cell responses can drive protective humoral and cell-mediated immune responses2 and might reduce the potential for disease enhancement3. Cytotoxic T cells clear virus-infected host cells and contribute to control of infection4. Studies of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 have suggested a protective role for both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses in recovery from COVID-19 (refs. 5,6). ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222) is a candidate SARS-CoV-2 vaccine comprising a replication-deficient simian adenovirus expressing full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. We recently reported preliminary safety and immunogenicity data from a phase 1/2 trial of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine (NCT04400838)7 given as either a one- or two-dose regimen. The vaccine was tolerated, with induction of neutralizing antibodies and antigen-specific T cells against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Here we describe, in detail, exploratory analyses of the immune responses in adults, aged 18-55 years, up to 8 weeks after vaccination with a single dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 in this trial, demonstrating an induction of a Th1-biased response characterized by interferon-Î³ and tumor necrosis factor-&#945; cytokine secretion by CD4+ T cells and antibody production predominantly of IgG1 and IgG3 subclasses. CD8+ T cells, of monofunctional, polyfunctional and cytotoxic phenotypes, were also induced. Taken together, these results suggest a favorable immune profile induced by ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine, supporting the progression of this vaccine candidate to ongoing phase 2/3 trials to assess vaccine efficacy.","Ewer, Katie J; Barrett, Jordan R; Belij-Rammerstorfer, Sandra; Sharpe, Hannah; Makinson, Rebecca; Morter, Richard; Flaxman, Amy; Wright, Daniel; Bellamy, Duncan; Bittaye, Mustapha; Dold, Christina; Provine, Nicholas M; Aboagye, Jeremy; Fowler, Jamie; Silk, Sarah E; Alderson, Jennifer; Aley, Parvinder K; Angus, Brian; Berrie, Eleanor; Bibi, Sagida; Cicconi, Paola; Clutterbuck, Elizabeth A; Chelysheva, Irina; Folegatti, Pedro M; Fuskova, Michelle; Green, Catherine M; Jenkin, Daniel; Kerridge, Simon; Lawrie, Alison; Minassian, Angela M; Moore, Maria; Mujadidi, Yama; Plested, Emma; Poulton, Ian; Ramasamy, Maheshi N; Robinson, Hannah; Song, Rinn; Snape, Matthew D; Tarrant, Richard; Voysey, Merryn; Watson, Marion E E; Douglas, Alexander D; Hill, Adrian V S; Gilbert, Sarah C; Pollard, Andrew J; Lambe, Teresa",Nat Med,864,1

However, no data are available on its role in elderly patients. AIMS: The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic role of LUS in elderly patients hospitalized for severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pneumonia. METHODS: Consecutive elderly patients (age >65 years) hospitalized for COVID-19 were enrolled. Demographics, laboratory, comorbidity, and the clinical features of the patients were collected. All patients underwent LUS on admission to the ward. LUS characteristics have been analyzed. Uni- and multivariate analyses to evaluate predictors for in-hospital death were performed. RESULTS: Thirty-seven hospitalized elderly patients (19 men) with a diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection were consecutively enrolled. The median age was 82 years (interquartile range 74.5-93.5). Ultrasound alterations were found in all patients enrolled; inhomogeneous interstitial syndrome with spared areas (91.9%) and pleural alterations (100%) were the most frequent findings. At univariate analysis, LUS score (hazard ratio [HR] 1.168, 95% CI 1.049-1.301) and pleural effusions (HR 3.995, 95% CI 1.056-15.110) were associated with in-hospital death. At multivariate analysis, only LUS score (HR 1.168, 95% CI 1.049-1.301) was independelty associated with in-hospital death. The LUS score's best cutoff for distinguishing patients experiencing in-hospital death was 17 (at multivariate analysis LUS score &#8805;17, HR 4.827, 95% CI 1.452-16.040). In-hospital death was significantly different according to the LUS score cutoff of 17 (p = 0.0046).

METHODS: In this study, we retrospectively collected data from 99 hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) between 19 January and 17 February 2020 in Zhejiang Province, China. We classified them into 2 groups based on whether the virus test results eventually became negative. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to evaluate factors associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) shedding. RESULTS: Among 99 patients, 61 patients had SARS-CoV-2 clearance (virus-negative group), but 38 patients had sustained positive results (virus-positive group). The median duration of SARS-CoV-2 excretion was 15 (interquartile range, 12-19) days among the virus-negative patients. The shedding time was significantly increased if the fecal SARS-CoV-2 RNA test result was positive. Male sex (hazard ratio [HR], 0.58 [95% confidence interval {CI}, .35-.98]), immunoglobulin use (HR, 0.42 [95% CI, .24-.76]), APACHE II score (HR, 0.89 [95% CI, .84-.96]), and lymphocyte count (HR, 1.81 [95% CI, 1.05-3.1]) were independent factors associated with a prolonged duration of SARS-CoV-2 shedding.

METHODS: In June/July 2020, Spine Intervention Society members were queried about practice demographics, perception of COVID-19 prevalence, financial impact, and implementation of new tools and procedures when re-opening practices. RESULTS: Of the 2,295 members approached, 195 (8%) completed the survey. A majority (71%) reported using risk stratification tools and changing scheduling patterns. Nearly 70% performed initial assessments via telehealth and 87% for follow-up encounters. More than 80% performed symptom/temperature checks upon in-person clinic/facility entrance, and 63% screened patients via phone. Most (58%) did not test patients for COVID-19 for office visits, while 38% tested only if symptomatic. For epidural injections, intra-articular injections, and radiofrequency neurotomy procedures, 43% reported not testing patients, while 36% tested patients only if symptomatic. Most (70%) required patients to wear a mask upon entering the clinic/facility. For nonprocedure encounters, respondents used surgical masks (85%), gloves (35%), face shields/goggles (24%), N95 respirators (15%), and gowns (6%). Some (66%) discussed unique COVID-19 risks/complications and 26% provided written information. Most did not make changes to steroid dosage (67%) or peri-procedural anticoagulation management (97%).

ACA+ patients without anti-SS-A/Ro antibodies require salivary gland histopathology to fulfill the ACR/EULAR criteria for diagnosis of SS. We reviewed salivary gland histology among ACA+ patients referred for the diagnosis of SS using the ACR/EULAR and Japanese criteria which does not require biopsy. METHOD: Data from 147 ACA+ patients with dry eyes and/or mouth who visited our department were retrospectively analyzed. Clinical, immunological, and histological data were collected and statistically analyzed. RESULT: Sixty-five patients (44%) had undergone labial salivary gland biopsy. The frequency of dry mouth was higher in ACA+ patients who had undergone labial salivary gland biopsy than in those who had not (P = .046), while there were no differences in biopsy rates between patients with and without sclerodactyly (P = .51). According to the current ACR/EULAR classification criteria, Greenspan grade of 3 or 4 for labial salivary gland histopathology is required in patients without anti-SS-A/Ro antibody for the diagnosis of SS. Four patients with Greenspan grades <3 and anti-SS-A/Ro antibody met the criteria for SS. In 54 patients in which the ACR/EULAR criteria were met, 53 patients were diagnosed with SS using the Japanese criteria. CONCLUSION: In ACA+/anti-SS-A/Ro- antibody patients, agreement between ACR/EULAR and Japanese criteria sets was excellent. For easily classifying ACA+ patients as SS cases, salivary gland biopsy should be performed in ACA+ patients with dry symptoms to identify ACA+ patients.","Tsukamoto, Masako; Suzuki, Katsuya; Tsunoda, Kazuyuki; Ikeura, Kazuhiro; Kameyama, Kaori; Takeuchi, Tsutomu",Int. j. rheum. dis,864,10

An impediment to identifying novel pharmacotherapies is the incomplete understanding of paracrine signalling. Oxytocin has been highlighted as a potential paracrine mediator of BPH. To better understand oxytocin signalling, we investigated the effects of exogenous oxytocin on both stromal cell proliferation, and inherent spontaneous prostate contractions using primary models derived from human prostate tissue. We show that the Oxytocin Receptor (OXTR) is widely expressed in the human prostate, and co-localises to contractile cells within the prostate stroma. Exogenous oxytocin did not modulate prostatic fibroblast proliferation, but did significantly (p < 0.05) upregulate the frequency of spontaneous contractions in prostate tissue, indicating a role in generating smooth muscle tone.

Individual tissue responsiveness to both exogenous oxytocin (R2 = 0.697, p < 0.01) and atosiban (R2 = 0.472, p < 0.05) was greater in tissue collected from older men.

To provide possible directions for future research, this report explored the impact of the Belgian COVID-19 lockdown measures on patients with bulimia nervosa (BN). METHODS: The data of 15 female patients with BN from an ongoing experience sampling method study were analyzed. Mixed effects models compared surroundings, social context, negative affect (NA), positive affect (PA) and binge eating before and after the implementation of the lockdown measures. RESULTS: After the implementation of the lockdown measures, significant changes in surroundings and social context were found as well as an increase in NA and decrease in PA. Patients who experienced a higher binge eating frequency during the lockdown also experienced a stronger change in NA and PA. CONCLUSIONS: Future research should also look at changes in surroundings, social context, affect and how these interact with factors such as personality traits and coping styles when investigating why some patients are more susceptible to the negative effects of lockdown measures than others.","Leenaerts, Nicolas; Vaessen, Thomas; Ceccarini, Jenny; Vrieze, Elske",Eat Behav,864,16

However, thorough quantitative analyses of the pandemic's effects on energy use and emissions are still lacking. This is largely because well-known published datasets of greenhouse gas emissions are based on annual statistics that commonly become available one or more years after they are gathered. A high temporal resolution emission dataset is critical to capture the immediate effects of an event such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Such an improved resolution might also allow policy makers to more quickly observe the effects of policies aimed at decreasing CO2 emissions, facilitating rapid adjustments. Here, based on a newly developed, near real-time global emission dataset, Carbon Monitor, we estimate China's daily energy consumption and associated CO2 emissions and use this dataset to estimate the impact of COVID-19 on CO2 emission trends. Such a near-real-time CO2 emission database based on activity data quantifies both anthropogenic CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion and cement production. We show that the higher-resolution emission dataset can be used to assess the impact of COVID-19 (and similar future disruptions) within a reasonable range of uncertainty. This study finds that China's CO2 emissions in the first four months of 2020 decreased by 6.9% compared to the same period in 2019, with a total emission reduction of 234.5 million tons of CO2. The provinces of Jiangsu, Hubei, and Zhejiang were most severely affected by COVID-19, accounting for 19.4%, 17.0% and 12.5% of the total reduction in CO2 emissions, respectively. The reduction of CO2 emissions from Shandong, Hebei, Anhui, Henan and Chongqing provinces is more than 10 Mt CO2, and the sum of the reduction from these five provinces accounts for 28.8% of the national total reductions. CO2 emissions in Yunnan Province, Gansu Province, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, Shaanxi Province and Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region increased slightly compared to the same period in 2019. In addition, COVID-19 has a little effect on CO2 emissions from Qinghai Province and Tibet Autonomous Region. This decrease in atmospheric pollutants is the largest decrease recorded and is consistent with the decrease in air pollutants observed by ground observation stations. This study finds that China's national economy has recovered rapidly. In April 2020, China's carbon emissions returned to the same level observed last year. This study predicts that China's full-year CO2 in 2020 will be 2% lower than in 2019. This will be the first time China has experienced a decline since 1997. China's carbon emissions have not rebound significantly, and the dynamic changes in China's CO2 indicate a rapid recovery of the Chinese economy. Regarding long-term trends, it is still unclear how much China's CO2 emissions will change at the end of this year and how fast the economy and industry will return to normal. With policy support, the economy will be stimulated as the pandemic fades. The IMF predicts that the global annual economic output will decrease sharply by -3.0% in 2020, which is worse than the financial crisis in 2008, based on the assumption that COVID-19 will fade globally in the second half of this year. Based on current emission dynamics, China's emission decline is estimated to be less than 5%, and the future trend will be affected by whether there will be another pandemic in the future. Current statistics are still not capable of comprehensively capturing the dynamics of CO2 emissions during the COVID-19 pandemic, and further monitoring, observation and data collection are urgently needed. © 2021, Science Press.

We aim to quantify excess stroke-related deaths and characterize its association with social distancing behavior and COVID-19-related vascular pathology. METHODS: United States and state-level excess cerebrovascular deaths from January to May 2020 were quantified using National Center for Health Statistic data and Poisson regression models. Excess cerebrovascular deaths were analyzed as a function of time-varying stroke-related emergency medical service (EMS) calls and cumulative COVID-19 deaths using linear regression. A state-level regression analysis was performed to determine the association between excess cerebrovascular deaths and time spent in residences, measured by Google Community Mobility Reports, during the height of the pandemic after the first COVID-19 death (February 29). RESULTS: Forty states and New York City were included. Excess cerebrovascular mortality occurred nationally from the weeks ending March 28 to May 2, 2020, up to a 7.8% increase above expected levels during the week of April 18. Decreased stroke-related EMS calls were associated with excess stroke deaths one (70 deaths per 1000 fewer EMS calls [95% CI, 20-118]) and 2 weeks (85 deaths per 1000 fewer EMS calls [95% CI, 37-133]) later. Twenty-three states and New York City experienced excess cerebrovascular mortality during the pandemic height. A 10% increase in time spent at home was associated with a 4.3% increase in stroke deaths (incidence rate ratio, 1.043 [95% CI, 1.001-1.085]) after adjusting for COVID-19 deaths. CONCLUSIONS: Excess US cerebrovascular deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic were observed and associated with decreases in stroke-related EMS calls nationally and mobility at the state level. Public health measures are needed to identify and counter the reticence to seeking medical care for acute stroke during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Sharma, Richa; Kuohn, Lindsey R; Weinberger, Daniel M; Warren, Joshua L; Sansing, Lauren H; Jasne, Adam; Falcone, Guido; Dhand, Amar; Sheth, Kevin N",Stroke,864,16

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of Boozebuster, a self-guided mobile app based on healthy lifestyle-related components that aim to develop and maintain low-risk drinking habits among young adults. METHODS: This two-arm, parallel-group randomized controlled trial will investigate whether a 6-week self-guided mobile intervention (Boozebuster) targeting drinking behavior is more effective than a minimal intervention consisting of an educational website on alcohol use and its consequences for young adults. We will recruit 506 young adults (aged 18-30 years) from the Netherlands via an open recruitment strategy by using an open access website. All outcomes will be self-assessed through questionnaires. The primary outcome is the quantity and frequency of alcohol consumption in standard drinks (10 g ethanol per standard drink) per month (timeline follow-back [TLFB]). Secondary outcomes include binge-drinking sessions per month, alcohol-related problem severity (Rutgers Alcohol Problem Index), cannabis use frequency and quantity in grams (TLFB), depressive symptoms (Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale), perceived stress (Perceived Stress Scale), engagement (Twente Engagement with eHealth Technologies Scale), readiness to change (Readiness to Change Questionnaire), mental well-being (Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale), trauma and COVID-19-related trauma (Short-Form Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition), impulsivity (Urgency, Premeditation, Perseverance, Sensation Seeking, Positive Urgency Impulsive Behavior Scale), study or work performance (Individual Work Performance Questionnaire), and treatment adherence.

The authors presented 4 adult immunocompetent patients with acute aseptic meningitis with VZV infection diagnosed by next-generation sequencing (NGS). CASE PRESENTATION: Four patients were admitted to the hospital with headache and fever between March 2018 and August 2019. The median ages were 37 years (range 22-52 years). The median symptoms onset to clinic time was 3.5 days (range 3-6 days). Two patients had signs of meningeal irritation. Rash occurred after the meningitis symptoms in 1 patient (time from meningitis symptoms to rash, 2 days). No other sign or symptom was reported. The brain Magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography were normal in all patients. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were obtained at a median of 4 days (range 3-7 days) from the meningitis symptoms onset. Opening pressure of lumbar puncture after admission were high in these cases (median 256 mm H2O; range 165-400 mm H2O). White blood cell counts and protein levels were significantly elevated in CSF samples (median 317 × 10^6/L, range 147-478 × 10^6/L; median 1.41 g/L, range 0.57-1.79 g/L). The cytology of CSF demonstrated a lymphocytic pleocytosis, and most multinuclear cells. The culture of CSF was negative for all 4 cases, while T-cell spot test was positive for 2 cases, who were administrated with anti-tuberculosis treatment for suspicious tuberculous meningitis. NGS of CSF (the Vision Medical Research Institute) detected specific sequences of VZV in the 4 cases within 72 h after admission. The inappropriate treatment were stopped while acyclovir were continued intravenously for 10-14 days. All patients recovered completely. CONCLUSIONS: VZV is an infectious agent that causes aseptic meningitis in immunocompetent adults and could not be accompanied by skin manifestations. The NGS of CSF is a rapid detection for the identification and differentiation of meningitis in patients, which is of great importance for providing the rapid and accurate diagnosis and the targeted antimicrobial therapy for central nervous system infection.","Chen, Lanlan; Xu, Yao; Liu, Chunfeng; Huang, Hong; Zhong, Xingxing; Ma, Cancan; Zhao, Haina; Chen, Yingzhu",BMC Infect Dis,864,1

Older age (odds ratio [OR], 18.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 9.2-36.5), male sex (OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.1-2.4), history of asthma (OR, 8.9; 95% CI, 3.6-22), allergic rhinitis (OR, 3.6; 95% CI, 1.8-7.4), and smoke exposure by a caretaker (OR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.2-4.4) were predictors of bronchiolitis episodes. Bronchiolitis episodes were associated with higher severity score (P = 0.040), increased number of atopic factors (P < 0.001), and higher number of hospitalizations (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies Puerto Rican children who may present a severe clinical course of disease without traditional risk factors. Atopy-related factors are associated with frequency and severity of bronchiolitis. Puerto Rican children present risk factors related to atopy earlier in life, some of which may be modified to prevent the subsequent development of asthma.","Rivera-Sepúlveda, Andrea; García-Rivera, Enid; Castro, Mario; Soto, Fernando",Pediatr. emerg. care,864,1

has the potential for serious negative consequences on work, home life and patient care The ESMO Resilience Task Force collaboration set out to investigate wellbeing in oncology over time since CV-19 Methods: 2 online surveys were conducted (survey I April/May;survey II July/August 2020) Statistical analyses were used to examine group differences, associations and to explore predictors of key outcomes: 1) wellbeing/distress (Wellbeing Index (WBI-9)), 2) burnout (1 item);and 3) CV-19 job performance (2 item CJP;standard of care and job delivery compared to pre-CV 19) Results: Survey I had 1520 participants from 101 countries Responses indicate that CV-19 is impacting the oncology workforce resulting in a number of changes to work and personal lives 25% were at risk of distress (poor wellbeing, WBI ≥4);38% reported feeling burnout and 66% were not able to perform their job compared to pre-CV-19 Higher CJP was significantly associated with better wellbeing and not feeling burnout (p&lt;0 01) Differences were seen in wellbeing and CJP between countries (p&lt;0 001) and related to CV-19 country mortality rate (p&lt;0 05) The main predictors of wellbeing, burnout and CJP were resilience and changes to work hours Others frequently identified were coping strategies, ethnicity, concern about training/career, worried about current wellbeing, and working conditions In Survey II, results from 942 participants are undergoing analysis Overall, comparisons between surveys show overall wellbeing and burnout rates have worsened overtime but CJP has improved Among 272 participants who completed both surveys, WBI scores ≥4 (indicating higher risk of distress) and burnout rates were higher in survey II compared to survey I (22% vs 31% p=0 01;35% vs 49% p=0 001 respectively) suggesting wellbeing and burnout may be worsening overtime CJP improved (38% vs 54% p&lt;0 001) Conclusions: In the largest global survey series, COVID-19 is impacting on the wellbeing and job performance of oncology professionals Risk of distress and burnout has increased over time Urgent measures to address wellbeing and improve resilience are essential Legal entity responsible

As compared to transient transfections, this platform generated viruses with a 1000-fold higher titer. &#916;S was 15-times more efficiently incorporated into VLPs as compared to S, and that was not due to steric interference between the cytoplasmic tail and the MLV capsid, as similar differences were also observed with extracellular vesicles. The amount of &#916;S incorporated into VLPs released from producer cells was high and estimated at 1.25 µg/mL S2 equivalent (S is comprised of S1 and S2).

Affected patients test strongly positive in PF4/polyanion enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) and serum-induced platelet activation is maximal in the presence of PF4. We determined the frequency of anti-PF4/polyanion antibodies in healthy vaccinees and assessed whether PF4/polyanion EIA-positive sera exhibit platelet-activating properties after vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (n=138) or BNT162b2 (BioNTech/Pfizer; n=143). In total, 19 of 281 participants tested positive for anti-PF4/polyanion antibodies post-vaccination (All: 6.8% [95%CI, 4.4-10.3]; BNT162b2: 5.6% [95%CI, 2.9-10.7]; ChAdOx1 nCoV-19: 8.0% [95%CI, 4.5-13.7%]). Optical densities were mostly low (between 0.5-1.0 units; reference range, <0.50) and none of the PF4/polyanion EIA-positive samples induced platelet activation in the presence of PF4. We conclude that positive PF4/polyanion EIAs can occur after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination with both mRNA- and adenoviral vector-based vaccines, but the majority of these antibodies likely have minor (if any) clinical relevance. Accordingly, low-titer positive PF4/polyanion EIA results should be interpreted with caution when screening asymptomatic individuals after vaccination against Covid-19. Pathogenic platelet-activating antibodies that cause VITT do not occur commonly following vaccination.","Thiele, Thomas; Ulm, Lena; Holtfreter, Silva; Schönborn, Linda; Kuhn, Sven Olaf; Scheer, Christian; Warkentin, Theodore E; Bröker, Barbara; Becker, Karsten; Aurich, Konstanze; Selleng, Kathleen; Hübner, Nils-Olaf; Greinacher, Andreas",Blood,864,20

The sexual function was assessed using the Polish version of the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI). Every patient filled out the survey concerning socio-demographic characteristics as well as the influence of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on their lives. RESULTS: The overall FSFI score before the pandemic was 30.1 ± 4.4 and changed to 25.8 ± 9.7 during it. Scores of every domain: desire, arousal, lubrication, orgasm, satisfaction and pain decreased as well (p < 0.001). There was statistically significant association between the workplace and the change of FSFI scores before and during COVID-19 pandemic (p < 0.01). We noticed the biggest decrease in FSFI score in the group of women who did not work at all (5.2 ± 9.9). Religion had a statistically important impact on level of anxiety (p < 0.01).

In this study, a replication-deficient human adenovirus 5 (Ad5)-vectored vaccine, rAd5-G-H, expressing RABV glycoprotein (G) and CDV hemagglutinin (H) protein was constructed. The RABV G and CDV H protein of rAd5-G-H were expressed and confirmed in infected HEK-293 cells by indirect immunofluorescence assay. The rAd5-G-H retained a homogeneous icosahedral morphology similar to rAd5-GFP under an electron microscope. A single dose of 10(8) GFU of rAd5-G-H administered to mice by intramuscular injection elicited rapid and robust neutralizing antibodies against RABV and CDV. Flow cytometry assays indicated that the dendritic cells and B cells in inguinal lymph nodes were significantly recruited in rAd5-G-H-immunized mice in comparison with the mock and rAd5-GFP groups. rAd5-G-H also activated the Th1- and Th2-mediated cell immune responses against RABV and CDV in mice, which contributed to 100% survival of a lethal-dose RABV challenge without any clinical signs. In foxes, a single dose of 10(9) GFU of rAd5-G-H could elicit high levels of neutralizing antibodies against both RABV and CDV in comparison with the mock and rAd5-GFP groups. All foxes in the rAd5-GFP and mock groups died, while the foxes inoculated with rAd5-G-H all survived and showed no clinical signs of disease after being challenged with a lethal wild-type CDV strain. These results suggested that rAd5-G-H has great potential as a bivalent vaccine against rabies and canine distemper in highly susceptible dogs and wildlife animals.","Yan, Lina; Zhao, Zhongxin; Xue, Xianghong; Zheng, Wenwen; Xu, Tong; Liu, Lele; Tian, Li; Wang, Xianwei; He, Hongbin; Zheng, Xuexing",Front Microbiol,864,12

A systematic review of the scientific literature on people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) was carried out, with the aim of identifying personal outcomes that can be translated into specific and measurable items for each of the CRPD Articles aligned to the eight QOL domains. Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, the systematic review was conducted across the Web of Science Core Collection, Current Contents Connect (CCC), MEDLINE, KCI-Korean Journal Database, Russian Science Citation Index and SciELO Citation Index, for articles published between 2008 and 2020. A total of 65 articles focusing on people with IDD were selected. The results were grouped into four broad categories: conceptual frameworks used to monitor the CRPD; instruments used to assess the rights set out in the CRPD; recommendations on the use of inclusive research; and indicators or personal outcomes associated with specific rights contained in the CRPD.","Gómez, Laura E.; Monsalve, Asunción; Morán, Mª Lucía; Alcedo, Mª Ángeles; Lombardi, Marco; Schalock, Robert L.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,864,18

We conducted a prospective study to figure out the viral epidemiology of bronchiolitis in Taiwan. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From January 2009 to March 2011, a total of 113 children with bronchiolitis, aged <2 years, hospitalized in Chang Gung Children’s Hospital were randomly selected for viral etiology investigation. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were obtained from each case and sent for viral detection by tissue culture, antigen test, and polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: A total of 120 viruses were detected from 113 children. Positive viral etiology was identified in 86 (76%) children. Mixed viral pathogens were found in 28 cases (25%). Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was the most common pathogen and was identified in 43.4% of the cases. Human bocavirus (hBoV) was the second most common identified virus (in 19.5%), followed by human metapneumovirus (hMPV), rhinovirus, influenza viruses, and coronavirus OC43. In terms of clinical characteristics, no significant difference was found among the children with bronchiolitis either caused by different single or mixed viral infection. CONCLUSION: RSV was the most common etiologic agent for children with bronchiolitis in Taiwan. Newly identified viruses, including hMPV and hBoV, were also among the common causative agents. Clinical characteristics were not significantly different among the children with bronchiolitis caused by different viruses.","Chen, Yu-Wen; Huang, Yhu-Chering; Ho, Tai-Hua; Huang, Chung-Guei; Tsao, Kuo-Chien; Lin, Tzou-Yien",J Microbiol Immunol Infect,864,24

However, timely initiation of high-quality research may launch during an emergency under the right conditions. These include an appropriate context, clarity in scientific aims, preexisting resources, strong operational and research structures that are facile, and good governance. Here, Nebraskan rapid research efforts early during the 2020 coronavirus disease pandemic, while participating in the first use of U.S. federal quarantine in 50 years, are described from these aspects, as the global experience with this severe emerging infection grew apace. The experience has lessons in purpose, structure, function, and performance of research in any emergency, when facing any threat.","Brett-Major, David M.; Schnaubelt, Elizabeth R.; Creager, Hannah M.; Lowe, Abigail; Cieslak, Theodore J.; Dahlke, Jacob M.; Johnson, Daniel W.; Fey, Paul D.; Hansen, Keith F.; Hewlett, Angela L.; Gordon, Bruce G.; Kalil, Andre C.; Khan, Ali S.; Kortepeter, Mark G.; Kratochvil, Christopher J.; Larson, LuAnn; Levy, Deborah A.; Linder, James; Medcalf, Sharon J.; Rupp, Mark E.; Schwedhelm, Michelle M.; Sullivan, James; Vasa, Angela M.; Wadman, Michael C.; Lookadoo, Rachel E.; Lowe, John-Martin J.; Lawler, James V.; Broadhurst, M.

Increased CSF/serum ratios for Ig in the context of an intact BBB were never seen in the absence of intrathecal synthesis of virus-specific antibodies. Affinity-mediated immunoblot analysis revealed a broad pattern of virus-specific antibodies with embedded clusters of restricted heterogeneity, but no signs of oligoclonal Ig production carrying non-viral specificity. From these data it was concluded that BN rats do control the intracerebral spread of JHM virus effectively by a strong local virus-specific antibody response, thereby preventing a clinically apparent disease.","Dörries, R.; Watanabe, R.; Wege, H.; ter Meulen, V.",Journal of Neuroimmunology,864,16

Similarly, to previous coronaviruses leading to past pandemics, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS), a growing body of evidence support that a substantial minority of patients surviving the acute phase of the disease present with long-term sequelae lasting for up to 6 months following acute infection. The clinical spectrum of these manifestations is widespread across multiple organs and consists of the long-COVID-19 syndrome. The aim of the current review is to summarize the current state of knowledge on the pulmonary manifestations of the long COVID-19 syndrome including clinical symptoms, parenchymal, and functional abnormalities, as well as highlight epidemiology, risk factors, and follow-up strategies for early identification and timely therapeutic interventions. The literature data on management considerations including the role of corticosteroids and antifibrotic treatment, as well as the therapeutic potential of a structured and personalized pulmonary rehabilitation program are detailed and discussed.","Boutou, Afroditi K.; Asimakos, Andreas; Kortianou, Eleni; Vogiatzis, Ioannis; Tzouvelekis, Argyris",J Pers Med,864,16

The aim of the CRC COVID study is to describe the changes in colorectal cancer services in the UK and USA in response to the pandemic and to understand the long-term impact. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study comprises 4 phases. Phase 1 is a survey of colorectal units that aims to evaluate adherences and deviations from the best practice guidelines during the COVID-19 pandemic. Phase 2 is a monthly prospective data collection of service provision that aims to determine the impact of the service modifications on the long-term cancer specific outcomes compared to the national standards. Phase 3 aims to predict costs attributable to the modifications of the CRC services and additional resources required to treat patients whose treatment has been affected by the pandemic. Phase 4 aims to compare the impact of COVID-19 on the NHS and USA model of healthcare in terms of service provision and cost, and to propose a standardised model of delivering colorectal cancer services for future outbreaks. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study is a service evaluation and does not require HRA Approval or Ethical Approval in the UK. Local service evaluation registration is required for each participating centre. In the USA, Ethical Approval was granted by the Research and Development Committee. The results of this study will be disseminated to stakeholders, submitted for peer review publications, conference presentations and circulated via social media.
