Patients with inflammatory arthritis are more vulnerable to pain, depression, anxiety and sleep disorders. These complaints are linked in a cyclical pattern that may negatively affect daily-life activities (2-4). To our knowledge, the impact of pandemic on sleep disturbances in patients with inflammatory arthritis has not been evaluated yet. Objectives: The aim of this study is to establish the COVID-19 related impact on sleep disturbances among patients with inflammatory arthritis who experienced the COVID-19 quarantine in Italy. Methods: Data about chronic inflammatory arthritis (rheumatoid arthritis [RA], psoriatic arthritis [PsA] and ankylosing spondylitis [AS]) were retrieved from a large nationwide online survey involving patients affected by different rheumatic diseases. From May to September 2020, eleven patients' associations sent a call to rheumatic patients asking them to complete an anonymous online survey with specific questions also about sleep disturbances and pre-and post-lockdown self-reported use of psychopharmacotherapy. Data were analysed by a binary logistic regression model having the presence of sleep disturbances during COVID 19 pandemic as dependent variable. Results: 375 of 507 (74%) of patients had inflammatory arthritis: 249 RA, 77 PsA and 49 AS. 291 (77.6%) were females with a median (IQR) age of 54 (44-63) years. There was an increase in the use of psychiatric compounds after quarantine period (59 [15,7%] vs 65 [17,3%]), especially for sleep medications (23 [6,1%] vs 28 [7,5%]) and anxiolytics (15 [4%] vs 18 [4,8%]). 246 (65.6%) of patients had trouble staying asleep, 238 (63.5%) had trouble falling asleep, and 112 (29.9%) had dreams about pandemic (Figure 1 below). Conclusion: These results confirm that sleep disturbances have been a relevant concern in patients with inflammatory arthritis after COVID-19 national lockdown. Changes in daily life related to confinement have influenced psychological distress leading to a significant impact on sleep difficulties such as inability to fall early asleep or to maintain adequate sleep. Furthermore, older patients who had coronavirus infection and were previously treated for psychiatric disorders were at higher risk developing sleep disorders.","Ingegnoli, F.; Buoli, M.; Posio, C.; Di Taranto, R.; Caporali, R.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,940,1

The peer support model has since been recognized as an important component of institutional wellness and follows a well-described and structured method. Although peer support programs have traditionally been established to support caregivers involved in adverse medical events, the relevance and applicability of these programs have found substantial traction across broader crisis domains. Interventions, including peer support, help mitigate the 3 components of burnout: emotional exhaustion, depersonalization (cynicism), and reduced efficacy.","Pelt, Maria van; Morris, Theresa; Lilly, Allison C; Pian-Smith, May C M; Karasik, Lisa; Pelt, Frederick van",AANA journal,940,5

To compare laparoendoscopic single-site (LESS) and conventional multiport adrenalectomy in patients with aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA). Material and Methods. We retrospectively reviewed patients who had been clinically confirmed with unilateral APA and who underwent LESS or multiport adrenalectomy between 2009 and 2014. Perioperative data were obtained for all patients. Blood pressure and the levels of serum aldosterone, renin, and potassium were checked periodically. Results. We identified 45 APA patients in the LESS group and 71 in the multiport group. The baseline characteristics were matched between two groups. All adrenalectomies were completed successfully, except one with laparoscopic conversion in the single-port group and one open conversion in the multiport group. After a mean follow-up around one year, there were no significant group differences in the improvement of hypertension, number of types of medication taken, and cure of hypokalemia after operation. Conclusions. Our study confirm that LESS adrenalectomy achieved similar clinical and functional outcomes as conventional multiport adrenalectomy for management of unilateral APA.","Wu, Che-Hsiung; Er, Leay-Kiaw; Hu, Ya-Hui; Lin, Chia Da; Chueh, Shih-Chieh; Tsai, Yao-Chou",BioMed research international,940,24
